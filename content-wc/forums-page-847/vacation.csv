As long as your family is expecting fisherman type accommodations(plain, rustic, functional) then I'm sure it will suit you fine. For the extra room & stability, I suggest to upgrade to a 16 ft. boat if the 3 of you are using camp boats. Also, be sure to bring your own boat seats to save your backs. I didn't go with the American plan so I can't comment on the meals, but I believe McQ gave his opinion recently if you want to use the search engine here. If u have any more specific questions, feel free to email me at [email protected] & I would be happy to help u if I can. PK"

I am indebted and I owe you at least a lunch on our way through Ottawa, Nemio and McQ are also invited. We had some bad expierences 30 years ago on fishing trips to Quebec, price gouging,unwillingness to speak English, Ect..THATS ALL CHANGED NOW! The treatment we received during the last 2 years fishing trips to this area of Quebec have been fantastic. Everyone made us welcome and we overcame the sometimes language barrier,the fishing wasn't always good but the people were great."

Keep in touch.... PK"
