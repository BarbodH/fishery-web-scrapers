Stove Top stuffing, Rice a Roni, Macaroni and cheese anything you can add water to works well. any kind of Noodle that you like works well with fish, You can also buy boxed milk that you keep out of the frig until you open it to go with pancake mix we take. Good luck. Steve"

We take a print out of our list and make notes of what we used and didn't use and redo it for the next years trip. Send me your email path and I will forward you our list. I also have a dummy list I got at a show somewhere along the line that is a good starting point. My email is [email protected]."
