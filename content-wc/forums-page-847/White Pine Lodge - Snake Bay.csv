I've notice there are a lot of Musky from recent reports. Any info/tips on this area (Snake bay) will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! Pathfinder:-)"
534699,Guest,2003-08-29 00:10:00,0,Hi pathfinder. We are going to be up there on the 15th. I hope you get some responses. We stayed at sioux narrows the first week of june and the fishing was somewhat tough then. I dont think water level was a problem it was the warm water that was the problem. Any experienced snake bay folks out there? thanks
