534620,Guest,2003-08-25 13:46:00,0,We are heading to the island the second week of sept. and would like to know how the fishing is? We could try the North Channel also. Is the salmon fishing going strong and any suggestions on musky or pike. Thanks.......

Went to Meldrum Bay one day the first week and only picked up 2 , both under 15lbs. Caught on silver/green NK. Fished Providence Bay most of the time and also West Bay for Rainbow but again things were a little slow. Might have been the weather, it was hot as hadies and next to no wind most days."
