533765,Dman,2003-07-24 06:13:00,179,I was just invited by a coworker to do some fishing for the week of 9/2 - 9/6. I've never been up there and wondering where to start. I believe his place is at St. Paul Bay?. Sound right? Very close to the town of Red Lake. We'll be fishing for 'eyes and other toothy critters. What shall I use for Northerns/Musky and possible locations for some walleye would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Again. Dman

This is my first trip to Red Lake as well so it should be interesting. I received alot of good information from others on this board so I am hoping it is a productive trip. Steve"

533873,Guest,2003-07-28 07:54:00,0,"Dman, A good friend of mine guides on Red lake and better yet, some of the less fished surrounding lakes. He is the best trophy pike fisherman I know and he grew up on Red lake and he knows the lake as well as can be expected. I think he charges $125.00 U.S. per day. Let me know if yo want his contact info. Either good luck and stay out of the local pubs at night!!!"

I like casting for Pike and wasn't disappointed. Some of the go-to lures were: F18 Rapala - Silver & Black Daredevel Clicker - 1oz Red & White Cabela's Canadian Spoon - Hammered with Orange side-stripes The biggest pike was a 39"" taken on a Chartreuse-green jerkbait doing some dawg-walking on a breezy morning. I don't know about any Muskie up there but the pike were all over the shallow to medium bays and all of the channels. Have fun up there! - Rick"
