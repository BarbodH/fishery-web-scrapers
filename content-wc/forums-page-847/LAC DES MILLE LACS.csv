THREE BOATS WITH US ONE BOAT ALWAYS FIGHTING A FISH. CAUGHT AND RELEASED ALOT OF 18,19,20 INCH FISH. BIGGEST WAS ONLY 23 INCHES. I ALWAYS STAY AT PINE POINT RESORT. THE NEW OWNERS ARE GREAT DOWN TO EARTH PEOPLE. OUR BEST LUCK WERE THE ISLANDS OUTSIDE BOLTON BAY. GREAT FUN GOOD LUCK!"

534573,Guest,2003-08-22 16:39:00,0,Fishing has been great. There is always the chance of big Northern over 45in . The fish are running larger now and will continue into the fall.
534578,PJM,2003-08-22 22:11:00,3516,"Mike C Mike I am not an expert on Northern fishing but when I was on LAC DES MILLE LACS around July 25 I learned something about the lake which might help you. The lake does not have a good lake map so any time I run over a rock pile I mark it. It seem like all the rock piles we found had fish on them. The Walleyes were on them at various depths depending on the time of day, but morning and late evening seem to be the best. One of the days we were there I decided to pull crank baits over the rock piles coming from the deep water and going over the top of the rock pile. We were using a number 9 deep diving shad rap with about 65 feet of line out at about 2.5 mph. when that Shad Rap started coming ip the side of the rock pile between 18 and 11 feet we started picking up nice northerns and this was in Bolton Bay.. They ran between 22 to 38inches with the largest being 42inches. The only problem with using deep diving shads is when you hit the top of the reef they start banging off the rocks so you have to raise your rod up. We tried this on several rock piles and caught northerns but not as big as the ones in Bolton. Along with the northerns you also caught Walleyes on the crank baits. What I have found out is that those northerns seem to lay on the sides of those rock piles at different depths and I suppose at sometime they go on top of the reef feed."
