But, when I first bought and used fusion, I was looking for a mono alernative, and it's great. It's limp, without a lot of the tip-tangles associated with the ultra-limp braids. I think it is a good middle of the road line....not too limp, but very stong and has no memeory. The only knock on it is that when it gets a bit old the coating can frey a bit. But it never compromises the strength. I've used line that looks like it is shreded, and it has never broken. Worth a try. J"

534625,BabeLinder,2003-08-25 18:25:00,112,I havent used power pro and since using fusion dont need to try others. Fusion works great for me trolling. I havent used it jigging. Zero stretch. I have had to double the strength of my leaders because I was snapping so many fish off. I also heard that braids werent abrasion resistant. I couldnt even chew through this stuff and have to use a knife to cut it. It will be visible under water because it is awfully thick.
