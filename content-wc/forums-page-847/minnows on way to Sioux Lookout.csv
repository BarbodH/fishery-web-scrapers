534389,eyewitness,2003-08-14 08:38:00,680,Personally I'd salt my own and bring them with from home. When jigging the fish don't know the difference anyway. Lots cheaper too. Just make sure when you freeze them that you portion them in smaller bags so you only take out what you need at the time. Otherwise once thawed they will get soft and be tough to use. You can buy minnows by the gallon at home. Up there they count every one.....

I am not sure what exactly he used, but it was a thick salt (with some garlic salt) and just put the minnows in it. We used maybe one dozen of them, with hardly any success, so we tossed the rest. Nightcrawlers are the way to go. You can get a flat of nightcrawlers (500 - in worm bedding) for $40.00 to bring with. We couldn't keep nightcrawlers on our hooks the walley were hitting them so hard - they were the hot item when we were up there. Best of luck."

Put in about 25 or so..Then when you go fishing take a bag or two with you.They seem to stay firm on your hook and the fish still love em Roy"
