Hard to tell how much but some rocks that were exposed in May are now under 3 to 4 ft of water. The reports of the lake being down 8 to 9 ft sound like what we saw in May, it looks like Lac Seul may be down 3 to 4 ft now, at least at the north end. Ear Falls had heavy rain on Tuesday but I don't know how far south this went so it may not effect the lake level much. Other than the heat, it was a great trip and the fishing was very good."

534470,Guest,2003-08-18 20:28:00,0,Try this site...http://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html. I'll be hittin the water @ 7am 8/24. Good luck
534472,Guest,2003-08-18 21:05:00,0,"We flew over Lac Seul Just this Sunday morn. It looks like they have a lot of beach front\shoreline showing,lots of sand. I thought we were flying over Florida. I was told it was 8-9 foot low by the camp owner we flew with."
534481,Guest,2003-08-19 12:38:00,0,"We were up from the 3rd to the 9th fishing out of Mahkwa. Water is very low in this area. I would guess at least 6 to 7 feet, which sounded like was an improvement over June. There is a sand and rock bar that was very visible right in their bay that supposedly they drove a pickup across earlier in the season to dig out a path so boats could get in. Didn't have much trouble out in the bigger parts of the lake, but I would recommend being very careful."
534494,Guest,2003-08-19 23:08:00,0,"We were just up their fishing Lac Seul south of McKenzie Bay by Manitoba & Stoney Point, August 2nd-8th and the water levels on Lac Seul are still down about 5 feet. There are a lot of reefs and rocks that are showing this year and some that if you don't know where you are going could take out your lower unit cause they are only 1-1.5 feet below the water surface in the middle of the lake. So you have to be extremely careful this year if you have a GPS and are going to be down in that area of Lac Seul I have the coordinates for some of the rocks and reefs. Even though the water levels are low, the fishing was still very good especially for Walleyes. Good Luck and have fun."
534496,Guest,2003-08-20 08:17:00,0,Thanks for the information.......how can I contact you for the coordinates????
534502,Guest,2003-08-20 10:24:00,0,"I'm on lunch right now and don't have my GPS, send me an email to [email protected] and I will send you the coordinates tonight"
534572,Guest,2003-08-22 13:06:00,0,We just got back yesterday. We were also up for the opener and it looks like the water is up about 1 1/2' since May. You can get through the rags with your electric now. Still there are hidden rocks so be carefull
534596,Guest,2003-08-24 09:22:00,0,This past week the dam was opened to allow an additional 50 cubic meters/second through to help ship power south. Thus don't expect levels to rise much further in the near future. We are in desperate need of a heavy snow winter.
534601,nemio,2003-08-24 18:22:00,96,I read a lot on WC about Lac Seul. But I would like to know how's fishing there. If it's so good can I bring back some fot a tasty lunch with my family and friends or it's only a matter of catching 2 or 3 a day. Just for my info. Thank you.
