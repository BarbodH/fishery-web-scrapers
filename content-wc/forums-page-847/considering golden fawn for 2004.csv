534581,Guest,2003-08-23 08:37:00,0,Hi. We stayed there for about 5 years. The cabins we stayed in were nice enough and the boats were plenty big for the 2 of us and everything we put in it. the outboards seem like they were 2 cycle but they might be 4 by now. Barb is the owner. give them look at there web site. If its just you and your wife get the honeymoon cabin its the nicest or was back then. good luck. alan
