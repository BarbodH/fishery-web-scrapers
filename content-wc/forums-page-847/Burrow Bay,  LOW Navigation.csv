I am aware of the unmarked reef NE of the small island with the marked reef in the south part of the bay, just north of the Elm Portage map designation. Are these reefs showing? I usually go about 1/2 way between the island and the point on the east, thinking maybe of going through by going south of that island. Also, has anyone experienced a no water problem at the entrance to Obabikon? I understand it is possible to get in, just wondering what happens with a strong north wind sort of sucking all the water away from the entrance. Back in the '60's, after a strong wind, where the channel was at Turtle Portage, I had to wait a day for the water to come back, so I could get into Whitefish, it literally dried up. Thanks for your comments"

They ranged in size from 16-18 ft. tillers to 18ft. counsels. Did not try it myself as I had my in-laws boat (Lund Barron 2100). I would say give it a try but be very carefull. I would stay close to the point on the east. Did not try Obabikon for the same reason. Father-in-law did get in but said it was not fun. Keep Your Rod Bent !!! GrandPops"

534606,GrandPops,2003-08-25 04:40:00,31,Did not do as good as the trip we took two weeks before. Fish were moving off the rocks. We were catching them in 10-20 feet of water on minnows and red jigs about 2 in the afternoon. They may be in the bays by the time you get there. Keep Your Rod Bent !!! GrandPops

They are obviously braver than I. Most everything that can get you is out of the water. Fishing was good on Sat., fish near and drop offs into deep water. Sunday, couldn't find them. Good luck."
