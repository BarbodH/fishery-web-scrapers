534598,Guest,2003-08-24 09:53:00,0,In the interest of good sportmanship and the hope that other members of my group will not be persecuted of held responsible for my comments I hearby withdraw all previous posts regarding my experiences at Lac Seul Outpost. I may have been a bit to quick to put all the blame on the camp and camp operators/employees. I hope this retraction puts this matter to rest.
