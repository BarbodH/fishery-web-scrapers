We have heard about the fire south of there, and I was wondering if it is still burning, and what the status is. I would also like some information about how the fishing is in the area if anyone has been there in the last week or so. We are leaving tomorrow morning, and are counting the hours. Thanks in advance, IAeyeguy"

I'm here in Ankeny wishing I was in your shoes and ready to head up north too! Our annual fishing hole is in the Kenora/Minaki area also. Good luck!"
