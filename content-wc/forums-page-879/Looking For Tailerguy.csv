530950,Stu,2003-05-12 14:38:00,472,I will be up at Wabaskang on the last week of July. I was wondering if I could contact you and get a fishing report. I was looking for you in the profiles but you are not registered. We will be staying at tall pines if you get free I'll buy you a beer!
530951,Trailerguy,2003-05-12 15:36:00,1407,"I don't know if I'll be up there that week. We'll be up over the 4th for sure, and my son's have a trip planned the first week of August. But I'll be happy to share any info I can."
