However, licensed dealers and harvesters continue to be able to do so. The rationale for these laws and a new proposal to completely ban the importation of leeches into Ontario, effective 1 Jan 2004 under the Ontario Fishery Regulations (OFR) is copied (from Ontario's EBR site) below:""The use of live bait presents a risk of introducing aquatic species to new waters. For several decades, the OFR have prohibited the import of baitfish, crayfish and salamanders to prevent accidental introductions of undesirable exotic species.In recent years, the use of leeches as live-bait for angling has become increasingly popular. There were no restrictions on the import of leeches into Ontario for use as bait prior to 1999. This unrestricted import posed a risk of introducing new species of leeches to the province, as well as additional animals and plants that can be carried in leech holding water.To address these concerns a ban on the importation of leeches for non-commercial purposes was put in place in 1999. Licensed dealers and harvesters were able to import leeches but anglers could no longer bring them across the border into Ontario.By restricting the import to licensed dealers and harvesters only, it enabled the ministry and the industry to develop protocols for importing leeches that would assist in preventing the introduction of exotic species until a complete ban was in place.The new proposal to completely ban the importation of live leeches satisfies Ontario's conservation concerns to reduce the risk of the importation of exotic species into Ontario, allows the bait industry in Ontario time to prepare for the ban on importation of leeches andencourages the economic development of the leech industry in Ontario."""
