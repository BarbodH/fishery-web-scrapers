530814,Guest,2003-05-13 13:34:00,0,"You could meet up in Sawmill Bay, which is where alot of fishermen from the Ear Falls area camps fish anyway. The fishing is great there, and it is kind of in between your camps. We will be up at Golden Fawn that same week, and we fish Sawmill alot. Have had great success there the past 18 years."

530808,Guest,2003-05-11 04:06:00,0,Not to worry there are alot of good spots to meet on the lake and not far from each other. Cell phones work if you are with verizon. For $10 a month you can add Canada to your package. Gary can assist you when you get to camp just ask.

530809,Thumper,2003-05-12 07:05:00,133,"Wow, Pat. Your post suprises me. Are you saying that cell phones work on most of the lake? or just near Ear Falls and the highway? Anyone know about AT&T coverage there (roaming charges would be OK).Bill,The GPS and 2-way radio would probably be a good idea, but they have limited range, 2 miles across the water, less with islands and peninsulas in the way. I believe that the GRMS (5-mile) band is restricted in Canada.Look at the Garmin Rino 120. It's got the 2-way radio built in to the mapping GPS. You could talk to your brother and see where he is on your screen, when you're within range.If you got one of the topographical maps from the Can government, or a good baythometric map (see Red Lake Digital Media http://www.redlakedigital.com/html/map_list.html) you should be able to agree on a place and set them as waypoints on your gps."

530810,2 DOGS,2003-05-12 07:59:00,361,"Verizon will work for sure in Ear Falls, you have to add the Canandian coverage, as Pat says it's $10 extra a month, but I believe you can add or drop that coverage during year. We just added it to ours. Hopefully it'll have a range of 20-30 miles out on lake. You'd have to check with AT&T to see if their coverage is available up there. Good luck!"

530803,Illini Bill,2003-05-10 12:59:00,53,"The good news is that both my brother and I will be at Lac Seul for the first time ever this year. The bad news is that his group is at Evergreen and mine is at Lac Seul Lodge. We'll be there the week beginning June 7 and would like to know of a place we could hook up for a shore lunch. I'm wondering if anyone can think of a spot somewhere in between the two camps where we might be able to get together. Considering the size of the lake, maybe this is too much to ask for, but does anyone have any suggestions? We'll have cell phones, but don't know if they'll work."

530804,Boots,2003-05-10 13:09:00,19,each one of you should get a GPS so you can meet at the exact place. Also get a pair of FRS radios to talk to one another.

530807,Illini Bill,2003-05-10 16:33:00,53,Thanks for the help. The driving won't work because we need the boats. Thought we could all fish the same general area and then hook up for the shore lunch. I'm sure we'll figure something out once we get up there. Illini Class of'60
