530877,Guest,2003-05-12 13:11:00,0,"Thumper, thanks for answering a question I've had for years. I've considered going on fly in trips before but have always wondered how to get enough beer in without exceeding the weight limits. Do most of the outpost camps have the same arrangment you described?"
530870,Guest,2003-05-12 13:49:00,0,Nemio:If you're going to let your outfitter od lodge owner bring the beer in for you make sure you agree upon a price. We got taken to the cleaners last year with a 20% premium over beer store prices plus they added 7% and 8% pst and gst (taxes) on top of the inflated prices.
530875,Guest,2003-05-12 17:57:00,0,Thanks! - I'm all set. Any place in Ft. Francis to buy Cuban cigars?
530879,Dave,2003-05-13 04:43:00,258,"Thumper,How much does Viking charge you per case of beer?"
530880,Thumper,2003-05-13 09:46:00,133,"Dave,Viking just charges whatever the beer store does. Right now that's about $25(US)/case.- Rick"
530878,Thumper,2003-05-13 09:49:00,133,"RockPt,I don't know how wide spread this practice is, but I really like it. I recall seeing at least 1 other camp with a similar policy, but don't remember who they are.So far, Viking has been first rate in my experience in arranging the trip. I leave in 10 days, I'll post my experience when I get back.- RickAww, 10 whole days away!!"
530866,Guest,2003-05-10 20:46:00,0,"Does anyone have any experience with bring Liquor over the border?I know we are each entitled to bring 1 case.But we would like to bring extra and pay the duty... is this a big hassel?Normally we would buy any extra after crossing the border, but this year we will be crossing the border at 2:00 am and flying out at approximatly 6:00 am. I am just affraid that we wont be able to find an open liquor store when we are driving through town.any help would be appreciated.AVS"
530867,lobo1,2003-05-10 21:27:00,734,not a big deal at all. depending on how much extra they may let U pass with no additional duty at all. Honesty is very important - cant stress that enuff. when we take approx double the free limit - 2 bottles or cases per man they usually wave us thru. any more than that and they just have you pull in a stall and go inside to pay. no biggie.if i remember correctly - the duty on booze was REALLY high compared to beer.good luck
530868,BD,2003-05-11 04:31:00,739,"It's cheeper to buy your booze and beer in the US and pay the duty. You will save a little money compared to buying those supplies in Canada. I have a friend that tried to take extra booze across without paying the duty. Just his luck he was stoped and searched. The booze was confiscated, then he was allowed to go on his way. Every trip since he has been stoped and searched even though he had learned his lesson. In fact after seven years of being torn down every time he crossed, he stoped going. Those computers at the border never forget."
530869,nemio,2003-05-11 04:54:00,96,Why don't you asked the outfitter to get some for you? I'm sure he will be glad to help his clients.
530871,Guest,2003-05-11 04:57:00,0,"why would you want to bring american beer anyway, the reason its so cheap to buy before you come here is cause american beer is ****ty canadian beer is premium and your dollar is worth $1.50 on this side. get the people that are flying you out to get you some beer before you get there."
530873,Guest,2003-05-11 06:28:00,0,Question for the Canadians:I will be passing through Fort Francis on a Sat. around 11:00am. Is the Beer Store open on Sat. at that time?Bear
530874,rpieske,2003-05-11 11:33:00,1276,Absolutely!
530872,Guest,2003-05-11 12:19:00,0,To canadian:I hope the Canadians that think Americans have a monopoly on arrogance or stupidity read your reply.To answer the original post: yes you can take up to 5 cases per person total and pay duty of about $7-10 Cdn. per case. Take your beer receipt with you. Duty is based on the cost you paid in the US.
530876,Thumper,2003-05-12 06:30:00,133,"Talk to your outfitter. They probably get this same issue all the time.I'm flying out with Viking Outposts in a little over a week. I don't mean this to be a commercial, but thought how they do it is pretty neat: They keep a whole $h!+load of beer up at their cabins. While you're up there you just drink what you want. At the end of the trip, you pay up your ""tab"". That way the beer doesn't go against your weight limit (22lbs a case!) and you don't have to worry about bringing up too much or too little. Only drawback is that the selection is limited to Canadian and Blue, but that's no problem for me! :9 11 days from now... yeah :)"
530881,Guest,2003-05-12 11:33:00,0,"After our group paid duty on our extra booze for 15 years, we were still unable to figure out just what the charge rate was. Out of pure frustration, I called about 4 government agencies at the border and in Winnepeg to find out just what the rate for duty is, and never got a straight answer, but was shuttled to another phone no., with the same answer again. PLEASE let us know if you can figure it out.We have decided it is no more expensive to buy our beer in Canada now."
