531033,IaDave,2003-05-13 08:44:00,476,Heading up Sat for the opener. Is there much road work on I-35 south of the Twin Cities and 52 from Rochester to the Twin Cities? We got caught last year just south on I-35 for about an hour delay. We are not sure which road to take so any advice is appreciated.
531034,Thumper,2003-05-13 13:24:00,133,"Looks like a pretty good shot going up I-35, until you get to Duluth.check out the MN-DOT's construction site:http://www.511mn.dot.state.mn.us:8080/MN_TRIP/index.jspHave fun up there and save me some fish ;-)- Rick"
531035,IaJoe,2003-05-13 14:24:00,25,"IaDave,The river I was telling you about is the Vermilion,flows out of Lake Vermilion,we go in on the end,off Pelican lake.My brother informed me that from the hwy bridge NW on is Pelican,the other way is Abrams,we fish both.You might be to early to find many reed beds,but give it a try.If you have a day to try Vermilion,they told us at the baitshop in Sioux Lookout that it is full of Perch.Good luck and have a good time!"
531036,IaDave,2003-05-13 14:27:00,476,IaJoe-Thanks for all your help. Can't wait to get up there. They tell me the lakes are really low.
