We drive 12 hrs. to Mattawa Ontario, spend the night there then drive 6 more hrs. on Saturday morning to Lost Lake Lodge near Gowganda. 820 miles one way. We've been going up there for 7 years. We used to go for 1 week until 3 years ago, now we go for 2 weeks. We go up the last week of Sept. first week of Oct. Is it worth it? You betcha! It's worth every mile."
530981,Trophymuskie,2003-05-13 15:25:00,254,Wow fishermen must be a sick bunch or we just love the outdoors so much. :+I tought the guys driving 13 hours from IL to fish with me were coming a long way. We are much closer for the eastern guys but our walleye fishing isn't as good as NW Ontario but our muskie fishing is better. ;)Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com
530982,Vitreum,2003-05-13 16:10:00,221,it's refreshing to hear you admit that about walleye. don't know anything about muskie fishing and don't care. i'll take your word.
530983,JackSalmon,2003-05-13 16:25:00,169,"Six of us are going to LOTW in mid-June. We live in northern Arkansas and make a trip north every year. Wouldn't miss it. My 13 year old son has made every trip since he was seven and it is the highlight of his, and my, year. JackSalmon"

530986,Guest,2003-05-14 04:02:00,0,I would go I55->I39->I90->I35->US53...depending on where you live in St. Louis driving West to hit I35 appears 20-40 miles longer.Bob
530987,Guest,2003-05-14 06:12:00,0,My Godson is coming home from the war in Iraq and joining his Father and I for some Walleye fishing in Canada. Its not the longest drive but it could have been the bumpiest road.
530988,downriverbob,2003-05-14 06:28:00,880,"This will be the 7th year go to Lake of Woods, Whitefish Bay, Sanctuary Resort. Aprroximatley 1000 miles from southeast Michigan. Going 900 miles to International Falls day one, the rest the next day. Coming home Sioux Narrows to Marquette, Michigan day one the rest the next day. The area has excellent fishing and the people that run the resort are the ""salt of the earth"". Last year went through the Soo across the northern route of Lake Superior, 200 miles further but a great trip and opportunity to see some beautiful scenery."
530989,Mr Twister 1,2003-05-14 12:48:00,5,800 miles from my front door to Nakina and it must be worth it cuz trip seventeen ic coming up in two weeks and two days! But who's counting??!!
530970,Guest,2003-05-13 06:03:00,0,"Our group takes off from St Louis and drives to Lac Seul. Two guys drive to SL from Dallas,one from Nashville and one all the way from Florida. None of us would miss this trip. The week of fishing is our best week of the year. We will be there June 14."

530974,Guest,2003-05-13 07:13:00,0,PS. I forgot to say in the above that we drive from west central Ohio
530975,duffy,2003-05-13 07:27:00,49,I drive 40 miles to the airport and fly 1300 miles to red lake Ontario and then fly out form there. It's worth it!!!!!!!!!!!
530976,Guest,2003-05-13 08:01:00,0,Duffy If I may be nosey what does it cost to fly to Red Lake?
530978,phishfearme,2003-05-13 10:01:00,1242,"o.f., for years we drove to from pittsburgh to northeastern ontario and quebec for our annual trip but now that almost all the lakes above sudbury and north bay are road accessible, we've been driving to northwestern ontario where the fishing is much, much better. it's worth the 2 day drive.bob"
530977,duffy,2003-05-13 11:34:00,49,WWDepending on the departure city it should be between $450 and $600.00 US dollars. Contact red lake travel at 1-800-465-3305 and speak to karen Veal. She specializes in getting fisherman to red lake on commerical airlines.
530979,Guest,2003-05-13 12:09:00,0,"I posted on the other board but if you going to make that long drive head for Lac Suel. Mahakwa Lodge is a thought although not very fancy. Lake of the Woods and Rainy Lake do not compare. I have fished all three and Lac Suel is the best; even better then some of the fly in lakes. We were there in Late July and caught hundreds of Walleye. But the best was catching 5 Northern between 16 and 22 lbs; three on my old Green Jitterbug. Unlike the states fishing stays good in July/August, although you need to fish a bit deeper for large Walleye."
530960,Ohio fisherman,2003-05-12 17:53:00,989,"Hi Guys: I posted this on the general discussion area and someone wisely suggested that the replies may be better on this area. I really would like to try fishing in the NW region of Ontario. The stories about the fishing are very attractive. Recently on the Outdoor channel, there was a program about walleye fishing on Dogtooth Lake. The scenery was fabulous and the fishing looked good too. (Yes, I know not to rely on that promotion!) The only concern is that I live in Ohio and the drive to that area is FAR! Maybe too far for one week. So, who has found it to be worth the drive from afar?What about the Nakina area? Any lodges or lakes worth looking at in that region?Thanks, O F"
530961,Vitreum,2003-05-12 18:05:00,221,"i drive from maryland. eastern ontario, lake erie, quebec are lots closer for me. you're gonna have to break down and take a couple of extra days of vacation. i thought you were gonna go up around toronto or wawa for the opener with your son."

530963,Guest,2003-05-12 18:45:00,0,"My group drives from SE Indiana to Lake of the Woods(near Kenora). It makes for about a 20 hour drive(about 1100 miles each way). This will be my 14th year and the 28th for my dad and a couple of the other guys who started the trip. It is well worth the drive for me and if I moved to Florida, I would still drive to Indiana to meet them on the thursday before the 3rd week of June to make the drive. Wouldn't give it up for anything."
530965,Guest,2003-05-12 19:35:00,0,Drive from portsmouth ohio (southern ohio) to manitou lake(1 hour above fort francis) 2-3 times per year. 1200 miles each way. WELL WORTH IT!! a week is ok if you leave on friday afternoon and drive all night. you get 6 days of good fishing in. I bought a diesel truck just to do this drive. I am leaving may 23 with my 13 year old son and a group of 11(3 vehicles). I would not miss this trip for all the tea in china. Good luck and good fishing. Eric

530967,Stehle,2003-05-13 04:22:00,95,"I drive from Parkersburg, West Virginia to New Haven Indiana where I join a group of family and friends. We rent a motorhome with a U-Haul and drive to Savant Lake (1100 miles from New Haven) I leave Thursday to get to New Haven, we leave Friday morning and arrive Saturday morning near Savant Lake. We are fishing Saturday afternoon. We start the return trip the following Friday and I make it home (West Virginia) Saturday evening. It is well worth my time. My brother fishes Erie often and he would not trade this trip for any Erie trip."
530968,Guest,2003-05-13 05:36:00,0,"I drive from southern Indiana to 25 miles north of Red Lake at least twice a summer, thats 1250 miles one way, and sometimes go to the Savant Lake area,about the same distance it takes about 24 hours. Also last September I drove to the Lynn Lake area of Northwestern Manitoba, that was 1850 miles one way, and and yes the drives were all grueling, but once i'm there i'm in heaven. I have made those drives to spend just one week, but usually try to spend two. I'm like a kid when it comes time to take one of those trips, pumped up, full of anticapation, don't even worry about the distance, just gas her up and point it north. Life is short! go where you really want to go, don't let a few more miles stop you. You don't want to waste your trip at some drive to lake in the southern part of Ontario that has been hit hard for years, and i'm sure there are some good fishing still left in that area, but the fishing cannot compare to Northwestern Ontario."
