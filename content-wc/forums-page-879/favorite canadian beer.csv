530694,Guest,2003-05-07 19:02:00,0,My favorite is Blue. As for the drinking in the boat. Two years ago another boat in our group got a ticket for having an open beer. They just got done fishing and were headed back to camp. They had just cracked open the first of the day and only had 4 beers in the boat. Got a $135.00 Canadian fine.
530692,retire55,2003-05-07 19:37:00,1029,"Duffy:Just in case you want the references for Ontario laws about drinking and boating, I provided such references in a thread at:https://www.walleyecentral.com/cgi-bi...0&forum=canadaThe Canadian coast guard version of things is at:http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/obs-bsn/facts/foreign_e.htm#3"
530695,Guest,2003-05-08 11:36:00,0,ask a simple question about drinking beer while fishing in canada and you get john q. law telling everyone it is against the law to drink in the boat!!!! have been drinking in canada for 20 years. never had a problem.
530697,Guest,2003-05-08 13:45:00,0,I'm partial to Kokanee
530696,Guest,2003-05-08 19:12:00,0,"I agree, why is it some dork always has to go on the defensive. if they dont like what is being asked, just ignore it, don't spew it on us, we know the law!!!!!BTW,,, Labatts Maximum Ice is the most discusting poo ever!Crystal rules"
530698,jcass,2003-05-09 08:52:00,255,"Not a big beer drinker, but tried some ""Grasshopper"" from a rocky mountain brewery and liked it alot - as did the people who shared the pack."
530699,Guest,2003-05-09 12:06:00,0,Wildcat for sure. I believe it's a Labatts product.
530700,Ryan,2003-05-09 12:40:00,135,Molson Canadian. It rules.
530701,Guest,2003-05-10 07:12:00,0,"They are all wonderful and refreshing, but maybe Labatts and Molson are standouts? Hard to make a decision on that!"
530702,iamwalleye1,2003-05-11 05:09:00,1589,Blue light!!
530683,Guest,2003-05-07 08:41:00,0,"All,what is your favorite canadian beer to drink on the lake other than a cold one??? I am partial to blue or blue light. Let me know--so I can try some others this year."
530684,winchester70,2003-05-07 09:29:00,0,"Kokanee...for me,it's not a headache the morning after type of beer.Worst brew has to be O'keefe's Extra Old Stock....yeeeech!!!!!"
530685,Guest,2003-05-07 09:31:00,0,I'd for sure go with Carling (light) and Carlsberg.....big noon Slemans.
530686,Guest,2003-05-07 09:42:00,0,I believe in Crystal Light and It believes in me.
530687,Guest,2003-05-07 09:44:00,0,"Down with ""OV"" (Old Vermon) Yuck!!"
530688,Guest,2003-05-07 11:29:00,0,What!!!! How dare you suggest that someone drink beer on a Canadian lake??? Don't you know that it is against the law? If you have such a wanton disdain for Canadian laws then may I politely suggest that you crawl back under whatever rock you came out from. Thanks for listening:)
530689,duffy,2003-05-07 12:14:00,49,What is the law with regards to beer in the boat for ontario? Thanks.Duffy
530693,Mr Twister 1,2003-05-07 13:43:00,5,Kokanee is fantastic!
530690,Guest,2003-05-07 14:35:00,0,Duffy.....you can't have an open container of alcohol in the boat in Ontario. If you get stopped by the OPP and he looks in the cooler and you have five unopened beers and one empty he/she can ticket you...pretty much -0- tolerance. I by no means would even consider driving my boat loaded up there but I still pack a few cold ones in the cooler and take my changes.
530691,Guest,2003-05-07 15:38:00,0,"I know what the law says, but who in their right mind would stop honest fishermen from enjoying a brew while pulling in walleyes! We don't get drunk, we just want to have a few beers while enjoying the wonders of the lake. My beer... Corona and lime, or Dosequies lager and lime (I know, you asked for Canadian beer). The Mexican beer and lime helps take the fish smell away from shore lunch."
