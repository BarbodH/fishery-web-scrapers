531004,Stevie B,2003-05-13 08:08:00,157,How did everyone do this last weekend in Man for the opener? Weather was terrible so we ended up casting in the weeds for northerns. Caught a few. But it was nice to be able to go fishin' finally. How did everyone else do?Fish ON!!
531005,Slayer,2003-05-13 08:15:00,41,"Fished Big Whiteshell Lake for the Opener. Did pretty good considering the weather kept us trapped in one part of the lake for most of the day. Caught 'eyes shallow in 4 to 7 week of water in weed to rock transition areas. 8 keepers for 3 guys, had to release a number of oversized fish. Lots of small Northerns as well.""Slayer"""
