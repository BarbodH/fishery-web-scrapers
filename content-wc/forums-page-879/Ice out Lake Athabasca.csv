530551,Atlanta Dave,2003-05-14 15:16:00,323,Doc The lucky thing for you is we are at the other camp or your fishing would be severly curtailed as most fish you could catch would have a sore mouth from our week. Less than 30 days left I am ready.Dave

It's not 100% accurate since there can be actual haze/fog/etc.. over top an open lake and the satellite photo will interpret it as ice, or as in this example ---> haze.I'm no expert, but perhaps cold water will show up as white as well, I don't know. It's a visible picture not an infrared. But I do know from observations last year, when one lake wasn't white anymore, and I knew it was clear skies over that one lake, the ice was off."
530541,Atlanta Dave,2003-05-05 06:47:00,323,Does anyone reading this web site have any information on Lake Athabassca. I am wondering how the ice is melting hopefully it will not be like last year in mid June. Thanks in advance.Atlanta Dave
530542,Guest,2003-05-05 16:53:00,0,"The weather has been decent in Saskatchewan for the past while. If it stays like this, the ice should be gone from Athabasca by the end of May. In the central and southern areas of Saskatchewan, most lakes are already ice free... about 3 weeks sooner than last year."
530543,Atlanta Dave,2003-05-06 06:00:00,323,napatak Thanks for the info we go up the 12 of June . Last year we only got 2 days we could leave the bay the camp is on the rest of the time were were iced in does not make for great fishing. Am hoping to get the ice out and have time to get a little weed growth which helps the pike fishing a ton.Atlanta dave
530544,winchester70,2003-05-06 09:03:00,0,I don't know about lake Athabasca but the Athabasca river which flows into it broke up about two weeks earlier than last year.That may be a good sign for you.
530545,Atlanta Dave,2003-05-07 05:54:00,323,Thanks Winchester. I see from the forcasts I get it is supposed to warm up this week Im sure that cant hurt.Atlanta Dave
530546,Atlanta Dave,2003-05-13 06:53:00,323,Just updating to find out if any new info on the ice at Lake Athabasca. Only have 4 weeks left till trip.Atlanta Dave
530547,Guest,2003-05-13 16:06:00,0,"I don't know how well this will turn out for you, but here's a satellite photo for western Canada. http://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/data/s...isible_100.jpgAs you can see in the picture, all the lakes that still have ice will show up like clouds on their surfaces. If you check out this photo day to day you should start to notice other lakes become ice-free and then eventually Athabasca will too. For example, Lake Winnipeg in the botttom right portion of the map is starting to break up from the south.Hope this helps you out."
530548,gms,2003-05-13 18:26:00,91,How old is this photo? I was at Gimli on the weekend and the lake is wide open?
530549,Atlanta Dave,2003-05-14 06:29:00,323,How far north is Lake Grimli.Atlanta Dave
530550,doc,2003-05-14 10:37:00,143,"Hey Dave, I'm thinking the ice won't be out until about June 19th. You might want to bring your ice auger and tipups just in case! Ha!Good Luck!Minneapolis Dave"
