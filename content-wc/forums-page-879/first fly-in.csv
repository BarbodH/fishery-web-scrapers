Your body will thank you for providing this support for the hours you're on the water....let's face it, nobody usually is used to sitting hours a day ,for an entire week, in a small boat -w- no back rest. Believe me, it's worth the extra pounds!"
530317,Guest,2003-05-02 11:50:00,0,"More comment on trolling. A good source of information is Buck Perry on Spoonplugging. Spoonplugs are a metal cranbait that come in a number of sizes from small for shallow depths to larger ones for deeper depths. Spoonplugs are designed to run on 5 foot glass rods with ""No Bo"" monofilament fishing line or wire. The technique was developed before depth finders were in vogue. You could learn a lot about fishing and catch a lot of fish by using the Spoonplug method. It can tiring on your arm especially when running the larger lures. Its worth reading about, especially the fishing and trolling techiques, even if you don't Spoonplug. Buck Perry's motto is; ""knowledge is the key.""

530319,Steve CO,2003-05-02 13:36:00,267,"Good rain gear and footgear first and foremost! Plenty of layers to pile underneath. Doesn't matter how good the fishing is if you are cold and wet and miserable. For pike, I'd say we catch 90% on #4 and 5 Mepps and #4-6 Vibrax spinners; I like the fluorescent red bodies with silver blades, red eye spoons (1 oz size- my favorite) and a few big husky jerks. Don't forget the wire leaders."
530320,bullfroglabat,2003-05-05 04:49:00,226,"Jigs, power baits, red-eye spoons, top notch rain gear, johnson silver minnows, good bug dope, and my all time favorite for fly-ins---baby wipes!!!! ""A clean butt is a happy butt""!!!!"

530307,Guest,2003-04-30 12:28:00,0,I think it's leuenbergers but I'm not sure what lake.....sometime in July.
530308,Guest,2003-04-30 12:35:00,0,thanks for all the info so far!! keep the advice coming! it's a big help
530309,Vitreum,2003-04-30 15:52:00,221,"my brother-in-law has been going north for about 25 years and loves to pike fish. poor fella. he takes next to nothing with him. mostly number 5 mepps spinners in chartreuse variants. a few spoons also in chartreuse. for walleye on a flyin, i'd take a flat of crawlers and some leeches. minnows are hard to keep alive in july. someone earlier said plain unpainted jigheads. i agree. i would also look into bottom bouncing or lindy rigging the deeper water at that time of year. here are some web sites i'd familiarize myself with. http://www.justfishontario.com/bouncing_a_to_z.htm http://www.lindylittlejoe.com/fishingtips/lindyrig.htm http://sportfisherman.net/sportfish/...ig-fishing.htm best of luck to you. oh, and yes, a portable fish finder would be a must."
530310,Guest,2003-05-01 04:13:00,0,We keep minnows just fine in July. We keep them in a cooler and remove half of the water everyday and add new lake water. The next important thing we do is to use a floating device that spins out water on the surface of the cooler water instead of an air pump that pumps the warn or hot ambiant air into the water. Bass Pro and Cabelas sell them.
530311,jigman 2003,2003-05-01 09:27:00,981,"WW we are flying in to Pringle Lake on the 4th of July, where are you going to? Have you gone with MLO before? Great outfitter."
530312,jigman 2003,2003-05-01 09:32:00,981,"One more thing to consider. For years I took live bait with me on fly-ins. Took care of the leeches, and crawlers and minnows. I just couldn't leave them behind. Then one year I decided to go without them, I now catch just as many fish if not more. If you are fishing jigs any curly tail will catch fish. If the bite is tough, go with a Power Bait. Cranks will also put fish in the boat in the summer. If you feel more confident with live bait, then by all means take it. However, I don't feel it is necessary on fly-ins."
530313,Guest,2003-05-01 11:08:00,0,"Jigman We are going to the Ogoki Reservoir. I shouldn't say this in public but, we just can't stay away from there. Found it on a canoe trip. Yes we have been with MLO numerous times for fly-ins and canoe trips. I would hate to have to try to find another outfitter as good as them!!! We have been like you as far as artifical baits until we hit a slow period after a severe storm . On that trip we got ahold of live minnows and now my wife won't leave the dock without them. At times when they are really biting we have experimented and tried both artifical and live. Sometimes it makes a difference and sometimes doesn't. Since the Reservoir is full of wood we last many dollars worth of crankbaits on the first trip and that is when we went to jigs ONLY. I know a group that went to Pringle a couple years ago and liked it.Have Fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
530314,Guest,2003-05-01 12:50:00,0,the lake isn't that deep in the middle (25 feet) what's my best bet when using cranks? what should I run and what time of the day? how can I use cranks to find those fish in the middle of the day?thanks again for the help....
530315,Guest,2003-05-02 08:20:00,0,"I don't know about you but trolling-especially at depths over 10 feet-requires me stop and think about line diameter, length of line out and trolling speed. I understand there is a publication called ""Precision Trolling"" that is available for $20 to $30. I think you can get it from Walleye Central Products or from Cabela's etc. This should really help you get your lure where you want it. I believe Rapala has a guide for its lures-maybe even free. I'd be more tempted to try bottom bouncing with a crawler in deeper water humps or irregular bottom features."
530316,jigman 2003,2003-05-02 08:42:00,981,"I'll second that. If looking for walleyes on deeper structure during the day I would definitely go with bottom bouncers and spinner rigs. I have gone to Power Crawlers with good results. However, you may want to use leeches or live crawlers."
530297,Guest,2003-04-30 05:12:00,0,"I'm in need of some help:I am doing my first fly-in to northwest ontario in July and need some advice on what to fill my tackle box with. The lake we are going to is somewhat small and it's deepest point is 25'. I have the basic jigs and a few cranks, but what should I get that isn't going to have me spending $500 and would be effective for walleye and pike?Any help is appreciated....."

530299,Eric,2003-04-30 05:31:00,114,"You don't need to spend a lotPike will hit about anything: recommend a husky jerk or two, a few assorted spoons, a rattletrap or other rattlebait about 3/4 or 1 ounce and a topwater such as a zara spook or similar for some fun if they will hit on top.Walleye: they are some real authourties on this board but for my fly ins we did well with jigs 1/4 to 3/8 ounce with a minnow if you can bring them (or leeches)or plastic grubs white or chartreuse. You can also troll them up with shad raps or smaller rattle baits or other rapalas. The tendency(guilty as charged)is to fill your box or boxes with hundrds of dollars worth of items and only use a few baits. Other important fishing related items for pike include wire leaders and mouth spreaders and needle nose pliers and a camera. Also a good pair of waterproof boots are nice also. Have fun Eric"
530300,Guest,2003-04-30 06:46:00,0,"Take a few weedless spoons (3/4 to 1 1/4 oz.)for pike. Johnson's Silver Minnow, Weedless Daredevle. Usually provide entertainment at some point in the week.Jigs/tails/bait for walleye."
530301,Guest,2003-04-30 08:10:00,0,"I suggest 3 or 4 dozen night crawlers in worm bedding, gel (ice)pack and a soft cooler to hold the worm box and gel pack (assume you have refridgerator in the cabin where you can put worm box at night and refreeze gel pack); a portable depth finder if not supplied or if you cannot rent one; some bottom bouncers and 3 foot snelled crawler harness for the Walleyes and some large Doctor Spoons (about 1.25 to 1.5 ounce); possably a collapsable net too."
530302,Guest,2003-04-30 08:25:00,0,Take plenty of Beer and a couple of bottles of Canadian Whiskey....the fishing will take care of it self.
530303,Guest,2003-04-30 08:38:00,0,I have spent a fortune on artifical baits in years past. I have come to the conclusion that if you want numbers of walleye a sure fire bet is cheap unpainted jigs and live minnows. Just my thoughts after 26 fly-in trips. Be sure you are allowed live bait in the area that you will be fishing. We have even found the slow fishing days a not as slow with live minnows.
530304,jigman 2003,2003-04-30 09:59:00,981,"Lots of orange and green chartreuse jigs with silk chartreuse tails. The Berkley Power Bait Tail in bright yellow is a killer also on the same color jig head. I have seen a real difference in numbers on this combination in my last 4 fly-in trips. I have never found this combination commercially, you gotta find someone to make the jigheads for you. Orange for the base color, green charteuse on top. Good luck, and don't worry. You will catch more fish than you will believe! What outfitter are you using? I am going out of Mattice Lake Outfitters the first week of July."
530305,jigman 2003,2003-04-30 10:04:00,981,"Oh yeah, I forgot. Don't spend a fortune on lures, but do spend a good amount on quality rain gear, including footwear. That time of the year it can rain alot. A native Canadian once told me ""Always take your rain gear in the boot(boat). Good piece of advice."
530306,Guest,2003-04-30 11:46:00,0,Jigman what lake are you going to? We are also going with MLO first week of July!!
