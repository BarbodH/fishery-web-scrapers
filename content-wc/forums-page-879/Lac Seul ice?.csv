529968,Guest,2003-05-04 08:37:00,0,"Talked last night with guys on south-central shore of Lac Seul. Ice is out on back bays but still on the main lake. Right now, guess for it all gone is Wednesday-Thursday, possibly sooner with rain and/or strong wind.Winnie,The comments in my post all directly or indirectly affect fishing and the fishery. They are not about PC, eco-communism (whatever that is) or liberal garbage. As we continue to push the resource frontier further north with greater development and increased foreign visitors, many intelligent people realize the time for broad land use planning and proper resource management is NOW! It has been proven countless times in the US and many times in southern Canada that a failure to develop such planning and management tactics causes severe damage to the natural ecosystem (that includes the fishery by the way). Why the ##### do you think everyone is coming up here now??? If you have any concern for the long-term sustainability of the fishery on Lac Seul, or anywhere for that matter, maybe you should pay better attention to the initiatives being set in place by very knowledgable professionals, and not just pass them off as political garbage. I want my children and grandchildren to enjoy the same opportunities I have!! Don't you???Jay"

529971,Winnie,2003-05-06 21:00:00,375,"The point was about the ice on Lac Seul. Where did you get confused?BTW, I don't consider the opinions of knowledgable professions as ""political gargabe,"" I was refering to your post."
529972,Guest,2003-05-12 09:43:00,0,"What is the word on Lac Suel, is she open and ready? If so when did it open up."
529973,Winnie,2003-05-14 21:05:00,375,For about a week now.
529957,Winnie,2003-04-21 08:18:00,375,Any reports on the current state of the ice on the lake? What about any long range forecasts for the month of May in NW Ontario? Any help is very appreciated.
529958,Mike KS,2003-04-21 08:57:00,18,Talked to our outfitter last week and he said ice was breaking up around shore line and some places on lake were getting thin. He thought everything would be fine by opening day.
529959,Guest,2003-04-21 10:03:00,0,"We had some beautiful warm weather last week in NW Ontario, but it has since got cold, snowed, and then rained for three days. Ice has started to get thin on many lakes, but Lac Seul still has a fair bit. That said . . . things are looking much better than they were a month ago. Right now, it seems like the ice will be gone by opener, but a cold May could change that. A more crucial point for fishing this spring on LS could be the water level. There are low water levels across the region, and LS being a reservoir, winter drawdown has lowered water levels to their lowest point in at least five years. In 1999, fishing at the opener was slow, and many felt the low water level was at least partially the reason. Apparently, water levels are below that right now. This rain may significantly improve runoff and overall water levels. LS Guide"
529960,Guest,2003-04-22 18:17:00,0,I just flew in and all the lakes are ice covered but dark. I predict May 10th for complete ice out. With the earlier opener we should get a good shot at the post spawn. Let the big ones go guys.....
529961,Guest,2003-04-25 11:39:00,0,go to Just Fish Ontario. Go to fishing reports. Click on Evergreen Lodge. Gary does a good job of explaining the current situation.
529962,Guest,2003-05-01 19:58:00,0,Hey im heading up to lac seul later like the last week of june. Will the water levels be fine by then. n whats the opening date on lac seul.
529963,Winnie,2003-05-02 09:56:00,375,The guy at Evergreen Lodge says the current levels are about 5-6' lower than last summer. Much rain is needed in the next few weeks.
529964,Guest,2003-05-03 09:10:00,0,"In a controlled reservoir, such as that of Lac Seul, water levels can rise quite rapidly with any significant rainfall. I have seen Lac Seul rise several feet in a little over a week with a significant rainfall. That said . . . because we continue to abuse our atmosphere and downplay important initiatives like Kyoto, our climate is getting so erratic a month of extreme dryness or extreme wetness is quite possible. Look at last year on Lac Seul . . . several continuous days of rain in June when water levels went up significantly . . . one month later in mid-july we went on a full fire-ban.What does all this mean? It means we realistically can't predict the water level throughout the summer, other than in general it will slowly rise as the season progresses to allow for next winter's drawdown period. Ontario Power Generation, and other water flow and water level controllers, are now in the process of completing newly-legislated Water Management Plans, which are very similar to the already existing Forest Management Plans. These strategic plans govern the operations of any water control structure, so as to preserve the aquatic ecosystem and enhance socio-economic benefits. In the case of Lac Seul and other reservoirs, these plans are very important, as they incorporate up-to-date science into their water management strategies, and as such should inevitably maintain or enhance the long-term sustainability of the fishery.Jay"
529965,Vitreum,2003-05-03 15:51:00,221,the sky is falling and the lake will be all dried up by july. better sign that kyoto treaty and quick.
529967,Winnie,2003-05-03 23:20:00,375,"Why don't we stick to fishing and not pc, eco-communism, liberal garbage."
