531046,Ohio fisherman,2003-05-13 11:20:00,989,"Hi Guys: Due to a change in plans, my brother is still looking for a place to go for later this summer. Does anyone have a recommendation for a ""drive-to"" or ""boat-in"" lodge or remote camp near Nakina? We do not want to fly in. We desire to take our own boat. Thanks, O F"
531047,Pooch,2003-05-13 18:13:00,4619,Try searching for O'Sullivan's Rainbow. Between Nakina and Gerldton. We have not been there for a few years but it is a good camp. I'm thinking that it is about 25 miles off of the main highway. On a (good) gravel road.Pooch
531048,Mondo,2003-05-13 18:37:00,61,"Although I have never been there, I have researched it ALOT, and I second O'Sullivans, just let us know how you did if you decide to go there"
531050,Guest,2003-05-14 03:38:00,0,Haven't been to O'Sullivan's but know a large group that's been going there every year for quite some time. They love it there and speak very highly of the camp and fishing.
531051,Ohio fisherman,2003-05-14 05:48:00,989,"Well guys, thanks for the info. I searched NOTO last evening by region and found O'Sullivans Rainbow. I then called and spoke with them on the phone. They sound like nice people with a good camp. They gave me the name of one reference who i called but no answer. Hopefully, this will be a good place to go. My brother is thinking of going in September. I may go too if work permits. Thanks for the help. O F"
531049,Ohio fisherman,2003-05-14 05:50:00,989,"Hi Pooch: Thanks for the info. When were you last there? Did you stay in the main camp or at the outpost? We are interested in the outpost. What time of year have you been there? How was the fishing?Thanks, O F"
