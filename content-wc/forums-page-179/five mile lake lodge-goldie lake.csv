PM if you prefer. Also, if anyone has ever gone on a train-in trip, I'd like some feedback on the baggage rules. Checked on-line and they seem a little complicated. I checked on line they seem a little complicated. Thanks"

5742745,Guest,2017-08-28 18:47:00,0,Stayed at main lodge a few years ago. Fished main lake and also did day trips to the back lakes. David and Christina took good care of us. Described the type of fishing we were looking for on the back lakes and they delivered.
5743305,dosxx,2017-08-29 06:55:00,60,"I have fished with Five Mile twice, once at the Wenebegon outpost and once staying at the main lodge/lake.Our trip to Wenebegon was good. The cabin was a typical outpost and was more than adequate. I was there about 4 years ago so it may have been updated. We went in mid July and caught size and decent numbers. It is fairly remote but there were other people on the lake camping and some with good sized groups, so it has an outpost feel, just not a fly in outpost.Our stay at the main lodge was in one of the bigger cabins during the third week of August in 2015. We caught fish (some smallies and a few walleye for dinner) but the fishing was a bit disappointing so we set off on our own adventure and found a phenomenal lake a ways away.Feel free to PM for details. A friend of mine also stayed here in June of 2015 and did much better fishing. He also did a back lake adventure with his kids and had a ball catching pike.The hosts were great, the price was reasonable and I felt satisfied with both of my trips. Good luck!"
