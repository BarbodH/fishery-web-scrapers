Trip number 26 (on many different lakes) for me and my son and #2 (first fly-in) for my 8 year old Grandson AJ. He's got the bug and is already obsessed with catching walleyes! Like my Grandson I love CATCHING but look forward to our annual FISHING trip more than anything. I LOVE to fish!!! However unlike many others that post on the board I love to CATCH (unapologetically) much much more. To me walleye fishing is much like hunting. The biggest challenge to me is finding fish. Catching them is a measure of success and a reward for hard work(LOL) This year's trip provided lots of both. We maintain a counter so we can record our 100 walleye days. This year we were 4 for 7. Caught quite a few pike while fishing for walleyes with biggest at 34"". Of course AJ caught that. Fished only on Ara Lake but did some exploring on Meta. Averaged only about 6-8 hours/day on the water vs pre-Grandson hours of about 12. Spent some very enjoyable/relaxing time playing catch, swimming, roasting marshmallows and playing other assorted games. Felt a little guilty not fishing more and also felt guilty for enjoying it so much. But my AJ was in his glory!!! Buck and Adam Smith are the new owners of ARA Lake Camp and Buck made us feel welcome immediately. We arrived with our Ara Lake camp shirts that he sent early in the summer and AJ was happy with the new hat Buck gave him. We were also surprised and happy with the pan of brownies that awaited us on our return the evening of day 1. The midweek peanut butter pie was also a great treat. Buck and Adam have already made improvements including new cabin roofs and internet access with VOIP. Boats are comfy with swivel seats and 9.9 Yamahas. Cabins have propane fridges,and stoves with solar powered electric. We stayed in a two bedroom with a nice front porch overlooking the lake. There's a nice fish cleaning house next to the water. Planned improvements include indoor toilets and showers. There is currently a nice two stall shower house and several outhouses around the property. Overall a great week fishing and some quality time with my son and Grandson. He already wants to know when/where we're going next year. Ara is hard to beat. Forgot to mention we were thrilled to see a nice caribou swimming across the lake and got some nice pictures when it hit the shore."

5736705,Juls,2017-08-24 16:05:00,13414,Glad you had a great time! Our group was over at Meta Lake Lodge during the same time frame. We also fished over on Ara most of the time too.
5737137,Mike Borger,2017-08-25 03:29:00,1554,Sounds like a fantastic trip! Nice to hear that the new owners of Ara Lake Camp are on the ball!
5737473,mroyle,2017-08-25 08:14:00,74,Juls- We probably saw you a few times....trolling in Walleye Alley and elsewhere. Did you guys do any walleye fishing in Meta? Are you still doing your charter business? Since I sold my Erie boat maybe I'll try to book a charter next spring. Mike
5744241,theishaveit,2017-08-29 14:12:00,2,I was not able to go to Ara this year. First time I've missed in over 20 years. Was just wondering if Brad is still working in camp.
5745449,Juls,2017-08-30 02:52:00,13414,"No, while we caught some walleye there, we were there to target Pike. I get enough walleye here on Erie. And, yes, I'm still chartering, but don't wait too long for an April date...I only have 7 days available in April."
5749505,mroyle,2017-09-01 18:15:00,74,"Yes, Brad is still there."
