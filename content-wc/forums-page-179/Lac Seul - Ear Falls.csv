The jig bite was phenomenal! 400+ boated that week for my 2 boys and I. Didn't think that was too bad for never fishing that body of water and not hiring a guide. I can only hope it repeats itself!

As a result, I'd be fishing jigs and big minnows, moving quickly until fish are located, then slowing down. Not too late to work sunken islands offshore, but windblown points, inside turns, and classic walleye structure is going to be the place to be. To me, fall is far and away the BEST time to fish Canada. Oh, and there are a lot fewer groups, since kids are in school, and the cooler weather cuts down on the bugs!!"
