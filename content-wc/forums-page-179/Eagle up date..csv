Seems yr after yr we find ourselfs catching more and more slot fish and over The 1st drop on the Son's Lindy rig he caught a 27 1/4 "" very next was a 26"" . Musky Pt. and Portage Bay was good to us ."
5742889,prov1800,2017-08-28 19:53:00,5010,Theres lots of spots were there are eaters only.fishery is awesome.but also seems very busy all over.lot of eaters being taken out.plus lots of fish being caught to deep and dying.it all takes it toll.plus all the shorelunches.good thing its not a 12 month season.
5742937,fishinnut 3446,2017-08-28 20:10:00,638,"I hear ya there,couple yrs.ago our family was fishing with another,we were in 24' and were catching and then I heard my buddy yell ""Hey I got 1 but he's spiting something up"" I knew right a way it was his stomache,he was in 45' ! I try not to fish any deeper than 30'. Clearwater was just ok for us this yr. had to bust up 1 Beaver dam then smooth sailing. Keep updates flowing John, may come back up in Oct. Musky fishing again."
