523819,Guest,2002-08-27 14:12:00,0,"I just wanted to put out a warning about Northern Comfort Wilderness Adventures on Lake Minnitaki. We had wonderful time fishing but the worst service and accommodations I had ever seen. The website and brochure advertises gas if you rent the cabin and boat yet when you get there he tells you that all you get is 15 gallons of gas for the week and leaves you only and extra 5 gallons and charges you for it! Well on 45,000 acres of water, boating several miles just to get from the mainland to the outpost cabin, and trying to get to the fish sanctuaries at least a couple of times a week, requires way more than 15 gallons of gas! The cabins were a mess, nothing had cleaned (i.e. bed sheets) from when the last renters were there, and there was no screen door so as you went out the skeeters came in! The little propane refrigerator did not work and we had an electrician and refrigeration guy in our group who could not even fix it. Thus we had to live out of coolers, which is a huge pain in the summer heat. Without gas and ice we had to make several long trips into town for these provisions losing out on precious fishing time. We knew the owner was trying sell the island and two cabins but we did not realize that he moved from Sioux Lookout to some far off city and the only time he comes back to the area is to on the first day you show up in order to collect your money. Other than that day, he is gone and you are left alone to resolve any problems on your own. Needless to say we stopped payment on one of the guys checks to compensate for lost time and the cost of ice and gas. We promptly e-mailed the operator when we got back and he never responded (which was a common occurrence when trying to get answers from him when setting up this trip). Then out of the blue he e-mailed us several months letter about the stopped check that he had just found out about and accused us of lying about our problems, he also said we dinged up his boat on the rocks when docking (He had no docks on the island and he had told us to pull them up on the rock island as the lake was way high and the natural bay was under water), he also said that the refrigerator should have worked as there were no problems beforeyeah right! We are honest fishermen that are willing to pay our fair share and help out anyone in need. We never had any intention of screwing people out of their share nor are we ever disrespectful when renting other people's cabins so I was insulted by his comments and felt stopping the check for one guy's payment was very reasonable. We pay those high prices to fish not to run into town every other day to get supplies. I highly recommend to any fellow fishermen never doing business with Northern Comfort Wilderness Adventures nor buying the overpriced island. Go with a reputable provider that you can get recommendations for. Best of luck!"

And you'll need lantern fuel. $5.00/gal."" ""Oh no, boat cushions/life preservers aren't included in the package.

There is also N.O.T.O. which is the active organization up there for lodges, I am sure they would review complaints."

Terrible facility and equipment; boats/motors very bad condition, fridge didn't work, shower broken, and an infestation of carpenter ants to go with the traditional bugs. What pissed us off was when we told him of the problems they either didn't exist (in his mind) or they were our fault.some of these camp owners are real jerks.lobo"
523832,Guest,2002-08-31 14:21:00,0,Go to Pickeral Arm camp and stay there you will not be disappointed at all. It is very nice and well run you won't have to go far to the fishing. Any troubles you have Lee helps get you fixed up so you can get back to fishing. They have outposts too but I have never been to any. Prices can't get anymore reasonable then they are and they have everything you need and if you need something they don't have they you can order it and they will pick it up in town for you. I hope this helps also they get booked real fast so hurry if you want to try them.
523833,retire55,2002-09-02 09:35:00,1029,"FellowFishermen:Sorry to read about your poor experience. There should be methods available to easily report on poor outfitter service for the benefit of other fishermen. There is a web site for the Northwestern Ontario area (http://www.justfishontario.com/) This web site provides an opportunity to identify outstanding outfitters. Unfortunately, it doesn't presently provide opportunities to highlight outfitters that don't excel at what they do. I have posted there today suggesting that they consider providing such an opportunity. We'll see. Jay"
523834,Guest,2002-09-03 05:22:00,0,"Of 800 and some views, there were two or three that dealt with bad service. It really doesn't seem to be a common thread when you look at the thosands of great hunting and fishing trips provided each year by northwestern Ontario outfitters. These guys are the best. As far as Just Fish, I think there are more enjoyable issues to deal with and that's how's the fishing."
523835,WillieB,2002-09-03 07:35:00,292,"As far as www.justfishontario.com, I've found more postings and chest thumping from the operators and owners than by customers, under both the ""Guest Fishing Reports"" and the ""Fly-In Fishing Reports"" (which are dam near non-existant). I wonder if there are provincial ""Better Buisness Bureaus"" or an equivalent? Maybe some of our Northern Brethren could enlighten us..."
523836,Guest,2002-09-03 08:36:00,0,Who else can we bash today?
523838,Walleye Wacker,2002-09-03 08:40:00,6,Ouir group has made it a ritual to fish different lakes and outfitters on at least one of our trips every year. We have had the best results by asking the outfitter to send us at least six customers names from the week before and after we want to book from previous years. This way we dont get his chosen references but we do get ours. This has been very effective and we have not been stung during the last 15 years useing this process. We call the other fisherman and the information about the lodge is helpful and we can get a good idea of what to expect fishing also. We have heard some bad storys and we of course avoid those outfitters. But overall the reports are good and very accurate.
523839,Guest,2002-09-03 09:06:00,0,Sounds to me like a much better method of determining the suitability of an outfitter then bashing the outfitter or the web site that won't print that crap. My hats off to you for your great idea. Our group is going to do the same thing for next year. Appreciate it.
523840,Walleye Wacker,2002-09-03 09:12:00,6,"Tom, Hope it works as well for you as it has for us. Be happy to share any outfitters information. We like to go to fly in outposts. If i can be of any help email me [email protected]"

523829,Rat,2002-08-28 07:26:00,102,Thanks for reporting on this shyster. Most resort owners are great people to do business with as this page frequently points out. However there are a very few jerks that think they are getting away with something and we very much need to report on them. Most of us live all year for one or two weeks in the heaven we call Canada and we don't need to be getting screwed around. I'm wondering if you should maybe write to the Onatario DNR about this guy. I know the province has standards that need to be kept by operators.
523830,Guest,2002-08-28 12:55:00,0,I will agree 100% that the vast majority of camp operators are hard working people that do a great job-- the lesson here is to do your research and ask around on message boards like the great one to see if anyone can tell you info on the area you want to go to. Pickeral Arm Camp has gotten rave reviews from everyone I talked to and I should have went with them when I had the chance-- I have learned the hard way about ignoring other people's suggestions. Best of luck to all of you and God bless Canada fishing!
