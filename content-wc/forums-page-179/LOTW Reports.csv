5731561,mrpike24,2017-08-22 07:25:00,54,Heading back up for a Labor Day trip and curious if anyone has any reports to share? Will be staying up in the Ash Rapids/Shoal area. Will be my second time up this late in the year so looking for advice and tips as well. Will report when I return!
5732713,BRP,2017-08-22 15:15:00,77,"I spent the last 10 days fishing north and east of Ash Rapids. S-island, Crow Rock, etc. Anywhere with 22 to 28 feet of water, live minnows on a 1/4 ounce jig of any colour, it was hard not to limit out in an hour with 14 to 18 inch fish. Nothing bigger than 20 but I wasn't complaining."
5735057,MN_Moose,2017-08-23 19:42:00,964,Hi Matt! Meant to send you a note. Wife and I went up for a second trip this year. Second week of August. Pretty much the same results as June. A few walleye but not real concentrated. Few pike and a few smallies. water was warm.
5735265,Obabikon,2017-08-23 21:51:00,2370,Walleye on the southern side of the lake are deep and off points/sides of reefs (20-25 ft)

5738129,Obabikon,2017-08-25 15:27:00,2370,"Musky have been spread out on every type of structure. It has been very good over the past month + I would guess September will be rocks and beaches mostly. As long as there isn't a monster cold front, it should be a great bite that time of year."
5742097,mrpike24,2017-08-28 13:45:00,54,Looks like cooler temps start this weekend should start cooling the water back down pretty rapidly. Still not real sure what to expect but looking forward to whatever that is. Will report back when we return. Thanks for the reports!
5742649,martinbns,2017-08-28 17:59:00,1520,"Well, it was a bit cooler yesterday on the lake water temps 68-69, but we are scheduled to have four very hot days in a row. It's 30*C here in Winnipeg which is mid to high 80's. We have found fish off the sides of humps all over the southern part of the lake, Oliver, near the entrance to Ash Bay, Crow Rock, Andrews Bay. We generally get near the edge, toss out jigs out a few yards over the edge and pop them back to the boat slowly and it's working really well. My wife and I have caught close to 50 a day the past few weeks with several up into the 20's, yesterday 4 over 20 and a big pike in the same area also caught on a jig/minnow in 25-30 feet of water."
