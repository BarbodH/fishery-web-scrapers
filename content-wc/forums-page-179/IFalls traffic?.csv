Saturday's wait is just too long for me - I'd pee myself! I'm going back to Canada this coming weekend - Saturday or Sunday, haven't decided yet. For those of you who have made the trip recently, or made the trip in late August or early September in other years, what's the traffic situation at the IFalls border this time of year? Thx"

I've frequently travel through the I-Falls border crossing in late summer, Labor Day weekend and in the fall. I don't think I've ever had a line longer than 15 minutes."
