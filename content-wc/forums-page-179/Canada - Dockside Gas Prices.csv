5743841,Baseline,2017-08-29 10:34:00,3207,I just got back from the Lake of the Woods and stayed at a resort on Whitefish Bay. Dock price for fuel was $1.29 Canadian per liter.
5744081,Wall-i-Lama,2017-08-29 12:33:00,1524,"Thanks for the feedback! I found what I needed, $1.65 per liter CAD is on the high side! This resort is located near town and other resorts that are charging $1.21 to 1.36."
5744361,BRP,2017-08-29 15:09:00,77,"Best deal is if you are near Kenora - Devils Gap Marina is also a roadside gas station so they charge street prices in all pumps, and they have regular fuel. $1.05 for regular last weekend. Also lots of turnover in inventory."
5744833,thawk9455,2017-08-29 17:48:00,343,We paid $1.61 CAD / Liter for premium a few weeks ago.
5745633,tv4fish,2017-08-30 06:24:00,2694,"Maybe not all the guys will be interested in this - but I thought I would give kudos to Mike and Andrea at Lac Seul Floating Lodges. This year we followed through on a ""bucket list"" item that my group has had for a few years. We were able to get on a houseboat from Lac Seul Floating Lodges. We were concerned about what price we would pay for any gas used. We were pleasantly surprised when we were told that the price would be the same as we would pay at a gas station in Sioux Lookout. We thought that was very fair and could not ask for a ""better deal."" BTW - We had a GREAT trip."
5746009,Obabikon,2017-08-30 09:14:00,2370,"I encourage my guests to bring as much gas as they would like, and I'm happy to store extra for them at no charge. They are also free to run into the marina or to anyone else that might save them some money. For most of the summer, I have charged $1.50 US per litre for premium. That is actually the highest I've seen here. However, the 8mile barge trip is very expensive. I understand the idea of saving some money on gas. However, unless the camp is forcing you to buy it from them at whatever price they choose... I hope nobody is too judgmental about prices. If you buy gas from me (the most expensive) at $1.80 Canadian/litre.... in the course of a week, you might save yourself $40 from the cheapest gas prices. Also... for those worried that a camp might be making ""too much"" off of their gas prices.... used gas pump $2,000 plus delivery extension hose to fill docks $400 double wall containment for a minimum of 1,000 gallons $2,000 plus deliver Someone to pump the gas isn't free, insurance isn't free, maintenance isn't free.... also pointed out that fuel delivery and costs can often depend on how much storage and/or where they are located. Be happy that they provide the service, not bitter that they charge more than the guy down the road. We certainly don't know why some wants/needs to charge more or less. If they refuse to let you leave to fill up somewhere else... that might be a problem. Aside from that enjoy the ease of on site gas!"
5746161,fishmanric,2017-08-30 10:05:00,219,They should make some money for providing fuel on site as they are in business to make money. I hope I didn't come across negatively as I'll pay what the going price is. It's a great perk at many camps and I couldn't have made it home on time without them.
5739353,Wall-i-Lama,2017-08-26 15:44:00,1524,"Not looking to get into a debate it, just wondering what everyone else paid this year for gas while at your resort. We paid $1.65 CAD per liter for premium in July."
5739577,Pooch,2017-08-26 18:30:00,4618,Just got home from Mahkwa and we paid $1.20 USD per liter from camp service center. I thought that was quite fair.Pooch
5739713,martinbns,2017-08-26 20:35:00,1520,My Marina in Kenora is $1.40 cdn/litre or about 30% more than a gas station.
5741401,fishmanric,2017-08-28 08:01:00,219,Lac Seul Floating Lodges charged us $1.06 a liter back in July. Our total gas expense was $305 up to Taylor Island and back. Very reasonable I thought.
5742857,Wall-i-Lama,2017-08-28 19:32:00,1524,Was that cad or usd?
5743081,fishmanric,2017-08-28 21:23:00,219,American dollars.
5743273,martinbns,2017-08-29 06:24:00,1520,"I was going to say, if that was CAD that was cheaper than gas station prices. Works out to about $1.36/litre CAD or 25% higher than the regular pump. Overall a tiny portion of the cost of your trip."
5743409,fishmanric,2017-08-29 07:35:00,219,They definitely aren't losing money on gas or anything else for that matter.
5743529,Huntindave,2017-08-29 08:47:00,2194,"And you know this because???????????????I have no idea if the resorts make a profit from fuel sales. I do know that delivery prices are higher on small volume deliveries on the wholesale end of it. I know insurance for a dockside fuel pump is higher than for a roadside gas station. I imagine there are higher upkeep expenses as well. So again, I have no idea if the resort is making money or losing money on fuel revenues."
5743793,v-bay gord,2017-08-29 10:21:00,3168,So true. The alternative is the resort sells no gas and you have to trailer your boat to town to refuel. Sometimes convenience is worth a few extra cents.
