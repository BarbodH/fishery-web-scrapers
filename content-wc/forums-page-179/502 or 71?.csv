Reason I avoided route on return trip was new walleye rig getting pasted with mud, rocks. I have a Rock Guard trailer protector, and even taped trailer sides to prevent chips....but she was a mess after that run. There was a lot of gravel back in early August. Watered down heavily to also be mud. When they get it straightened out...to where there is little to no gravel...i'll be back on it. May be close to finished now."

Now I am trying to decide if I should wash it before heading to Flinflon on Monday. Wonder how much construction is in that part of the country? Seems like every time I wash it, it immediately gets trashed. LOL"
5751633,kevinvjacobs,2017-09-03 19:48:00,48,Heading to Sioux Lookout on Saturday the 9th. What kind of condition is 502 in? Would it be better to take 71? Thanks!
5751817,btyreprich,2017-09-04 05:08:00,1067,"Lots of posts on this site about 502 and the road construction delays and much dirt and tar cars have on them when driving through these same sites.In full disclosure, there are sections of 71 under construction as well - but it's not bad at all.Even if both roads had their resurfacing done, we prefer 71 for a number of reasons:You drive through a few towns with services in case you need to stop for gas or car problemsThis road has no where near the amount of tall hills and sharp bends that 502 hasI've seen people driving in such a way that it reminds me of scenes from the movie ""Road Warrior""! On 502 that is.71 adds about 30 minutes to our trip to Ear Falls, but we feel it's worth it.Just our opinion and travel safe."
5751865,Thumpr50,2017-09-04 06:51:00,139,"Agreed. Don't think I will ever drive 502 again. 71 is safer, better road and well worth the small amount of extra travel time,"
5752009,kevinvjacobs,2017-09-04 09:09:00,48,Thanks!! Looks like 71 it is!
5752729,Bstar,2017-09-04 18:38:00,564,502 wasn't that bad when we went trough last month. Just have to take your time through the construction areas and heed the ORANGE bump signs. 71 will add a lot of time if your going to Sioux Lookout. Besides traffic will probably be light at that time.
5753593,Habitual Eyer,2017-09-05 12:07:00,144,"as I said in the other post. Took both routes in mid august to Hudson. Cleaning up vehicle and trailer from 502 will take FAR longer than the extra miles 71 takes you...even if going East from Dryden. They watered the gravel on 502, it was sloppy, and that mud seemed to stick like glue."
5753609,wooglin,2017-09-05 12:34:00,371,"I have always taken 502 in the past (2002 - 2007), but last year on my first trip back in a while, Google maps took me up 71. I thought it looked different, but it turned out to be a nice little trek to the west and was nice to see the upper NE side of LOTW. Didn't seem to add any time to my trip, granted I was going 30 over in a Camry (the boys went up a day before me). Heading up Friday night to Eagle Lake, so I'll be on 502 - if there is anything to share, I will when I get back."
5753721,Bakefish,2017-09-05 13:16:00,1077,I must be the only person who likes driving 502.
5753801,wmd,2017-09-05 14:01:00,388,"Nope I like it too. We will be on it Friday going to Sioux Lookout. Had a friend go up last Friday and he texted that a few miles of gravel South of Dryden but no delays, he recommended to drive it. wmd"
5754065,bearfvr13,2017-09-05 17:52:00,174,"I LOVE 502,.....I like when I see everyone complain about it, because I know that's less traffic that I will see on it!!! Next year I think I'm gonna start a new thread and say that 502 is HORRIBLE,....then maybe I'll have it all to myself!! I'm just thankful that there is another road headin north besides 71. With that being said,....I have an '02 Dodge Ram that has seen many winters in Illinois, (She's lookin rougher these days)...I don't have a boat to worry about,....so I can understand why people do not want to tear up their boat/truck investment!! That's a lot of money in both purchases,...for me,....it's no big deal that more rust falls off on my 502 drive!! I think the best thing in this is the fact that we have 2 options!!!! And I'm also thankful that we have sites like this that everyone can stay in touch with each other to pass on info about roads and delays and much more. (Ok,...maybe I won't start that rumor/thread!!) Chuck bearfvr13"
