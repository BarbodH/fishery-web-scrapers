5750777,Bill Krejca,2017-09-03 05:51:00,6107,"Will be coming back from Cedar end of the month,and would like to stop in/near Vermilion Bay for breakfast. Will be heading west from the intersection. Stopped last year at a nice small bakery type shop, but would rather have a larger choice of food. Anything available? Thanks, Bill"
5750841,HeHooksHimself,2017-09-03 06:40:00,725,"Bill, there is a nice little traditional breakfast restaurant just west of the intersection on 17 in Vbay, on the south side of the road. We have stopped there the last two years and have no complaints. For the life of me, I cannot remember the name, but I bet Gord or somebody else does! Good luck. By the way, I really enjoyed your book. Fish On! Hooks"
5750865,v-bay gord,2017-09-03 07:02:00,3168,"Must be thinking of ""Quackers"". Doesn't seem to be open every day, but it might be your only option."
5751033,NARDA 1,2017-09-03 08:52:00,636,Checkout The Tree House Cafe at Fort Vermilion www.fortvermilion.ca 807-227-2640 They are located just before The Comfort Table Bakery on the 17. They are also on Facebook.

5752129,Bill Krejca,2017-09-04 11:08:00,6107,"Thanks for the info, guys, we'll see what's open when we pass through, thanks also for the book compliment, Hooks! Bill"
5752609,fishinnut 3446,2017-09-04 17:27:00,638,Bill I think the Fort opens at 9:00am
5752657,Bill Krejca,2017-09-04 17:46:00,6107,"Yeah, thanks, the web site does say 9:00, might be a little late for us. Seems sort of late to start serving breakfast, but I suppose this time of year, locally, the tourist traffic slows down enough to warrant not opening earlier. Logically explains why few places were open last year, same time. Thanks again, folks. Bill"
