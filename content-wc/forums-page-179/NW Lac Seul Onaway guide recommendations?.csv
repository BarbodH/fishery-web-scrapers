5742897,thehack,2017-08-28 19:54:00,78,Four novice anglers are headed to Onaway Lodge/NW Lac Seul in a couple of weeks. None of us have been on the lake before. Can anyone recommend a guide? Thanks!
5743041,rather-be-fishin,2017-08-28 20:57:00,429,"prov1800 is a guide for NW Lac Seul area. He is on Walleye Central. Also ask Blair & Cathy owners of Onaway for recommendations of a guide. Very wise of you to hire a guide to have them show you safe travel routes, fishing patterns & bait & tackle to use. That will put you on fish & make your trip successful! We use primarily jigs & spinners with minnows with great success. Lac Seul is a Walleye factory & you won't be disappointed! Onaway is an awesome resort with nice cabins, dock, fish cleaning house & good service! It's located in Scout Bay & there is good fishing close by in case wind & weather are bad & close to good fishing in Bay of Islands & McKenzie Bay areas. Have a fantastic trip! RBF. ‚ù§Ô∏èüé£üòé"

Love Onaway, you will not be disappointed, great place and owners. Note this Rbf is correct, LS is NOT a bowl lake. You need to know safe travel routes and stay on them, there are 100's of ways to take out a prop or lower unit and ruin your trip. When traveling with the guide PAY ATTENTION to where he /she is going and make notes on your map or use a GPS to set a track. Have a great time!!"
5746529,vaquero01,2017-08-30 14:32:00,101,I am at Onaway now. Fishing is very good. An Iowa couple hired a guide thru Onaway Monday and Tuesday. They are more than satisfied. The guide is a First Nation guy that grew up on the lake named Jimmy. Talk to Blair.
