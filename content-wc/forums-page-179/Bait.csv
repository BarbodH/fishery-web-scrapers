Wondering about getting crawlers and some kind of minnows, frozen, etc.....any suggestions on good places to get bait, and any baits better than others this time of year? Thanks in advance"

5753041,Pooch,2017-09-05 06:14:00,4618,There used to be several bait shops north of Vermilion Bay. At least one in Ear Falls that I remember. A lot depends on when and what time you are traveling through. I wouldn't wait until the last minute to find one open.prov1800 could probably list numerous shops in the area. I've not been that way for a couple years now.Buying your minnows at home and salting them might be a viable option for you. It works on occasion for our groups.Ask your outfitter for advice.Pooch
5753977,PRO-V16,2017-09-05 15:50:00,454,Don't forget Gulp minnows. If the bite is any good at all that's all you need.
5754233,hoppy63,2017-09-05 19:42:00,367,"Thanks for replies. I bring gulps but some of our guys like live bait sometimes. Like I said, this is our latest trip. Wasn't sure if bait would get harder to come by."
5754313,Pooch,2017-09-05 20:19:00,4618,"Live minnows are always good, but crawlers are also pretty hard to beat when them fishies want real food and get picky.Crawlers offer the most bang for the buck IMO. Not my favorite bait for handling and keeping healthy. Jig them or troll them. Trolled minnows not so good for me. Would rather troll plastics than minnows.Just some more thoughts. Depends on the fishing pressure sometimes as to what we can get away with for bait. Uneducated and or hungry fish on a hot bite like plastics. Fish that are getting hammered everyday get pretty fussy.Have a good trip. Where are you headed?Pooch"
