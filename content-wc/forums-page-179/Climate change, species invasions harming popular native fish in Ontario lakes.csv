5747737,Catch'nRelease,2017-08-31 11:16:00,342,"Makes me wonder, to what degree has the ""invasion"" of smallmouth bass contributed to the much publicized decline of walleye numbers in Lake Mille Lacs here in Minnesota? Or is the whole causation effect completely overblown?https://phys.org/news/2016-10-climat...tive.html#nRlv"
5747873,Bill Krejca,2017-08-31 12:54:00,6107,"Some time ago, it was a fairly commonly held belief by some biologists that the introduction of bass to walleye water resulted in less fertility of walleye eggs. It had something to do with the eggs being harmed (not eaten by the bass) in some way, but I do not remember the exact circumstances, but even a quoted percentage of expected loss was printed. After bass tournaments started becoming popular in Ontario, the hue and cry over stocking turned into a whisper/lost echo(coincidence?). I don't know whether the idea was proven wrong, or immaterial, or what ever, but I haven't personally seen any mention of this for perhaps 25-30 years. Maybe the belief became a theory, and was incorrect. Or maybe not. I think of LOW, which had small mouth introduced around maybe 1926 or so, and then surprise, surprise, large mouth suddenly unofficially appeared, with no explanation, in the 1980's. If the introduction of bass disrupted the walleye population, it hasn't been shared very openly with the general public (lately). An interesting scenario, to say the least. Bill"
5747993,clearis,2017-08-31 13:59:00,47,"The cause of the actual or perceived decline of walleye in Lake Mille Lacs is still undetermined. Recreational fishing, bass, muskies, and zebra mussels probably have all had an affect. A body of water can support a certain mass of aquatic life. Lake Mille Lacs has experience a redistribution mass from walleye to other species. The introduction of zebra mussels and the increase in muskies may actually have had a greater impact on the walleye population than bass or recreational fishing. The change in Mille Lacs is up to the fisheries biologists to determine. I believe that in northern Ontario, direct human intervention is responsible for expansion of smallmouth bass just as much as any other factor."
5748449,martinbns,2017-08-31 21:07:00,1520,"When I was a kid in Ontario, nobody would have eaten a Walleye caught in Lake Erie, I remember hearing the zebra mussels cleaned up the lake and the Smallmouth Bass population went way up. Fast forward never being anywhere near Lake Erie in 40 years imagine my surprise that the best Walleye fishery in North America is the same lake. I think there are ebbs and flows to all populations in the wild and we can almost never predict what will happen. In LOTW, the Rusty Crayfish has exploded over the past decade and it's pretty hard to find traditional weed beds and cabbage around in Bays, but we still catch bass in the same areas."
5748665,MrSimon,2017-09-01 06:40:00,922,"I agree, there are so many variables it's hard to nail down exactly why things happen in lakes. Some lakes support healthy populations of both smallies and eyes ... but others don't. Sometimes bass and pike compete and don't do well together ... but sometimes it works fine. From my personal experience, the best walleye and the best pike fishing I've ever experienced have been on lakes that DON'T have smallies. I don't know for sure if there is a correlation, but it makes me wonder."
5749945,fishingfever,2017-09-02 07:54:00,85,We fish a lake near LOW and the Rusty Crayfish has decimated most of the weed beds there also. We were very surprised this year when a walleye puked up 4 of them in the livewell. We are trying to figure out how to use this to our advantage. The walleye seem to have adapted to the invasion. However a weed bed that used to have the best musky fishing no longer exists. There is no way to adapt to that.
5750089,fishron,2017-09-02 10:05:00,317,"I think pike are far more an influence on walleye than smallmouth. Most of us have experienced a pike grabbing a walleye on the way in. There always seems to be a pike presence around a school of walleye and when the bite slows the next catch is usually a pike. In the Delaware river in Pa the walleye fishing got better over the years despite it being a river largely populated by smallmouth. Interestingly a river guide, giving a seminar observed that he was catching more walleye during daylight hours and attributed it to the invasion of flathead catfish who are active nightime predators of all smaller fish. From what I have heard, they are the most disruptive species that have recently been introduced into waterways. The invasion of Eurasian milfoil in many lakes makes fishing harder but has to provide a lot of cover for small fish. I don't know what rusty crayfish would do to the milfoil beds but the danger to the good weeds would cancel out any benefit. The effects of climate change may effect water temperatures over the long haul but the population of walleye in any lake that I've known is more tied to the available favorable spawning areas, be it rocky shoals of inflowing streams. Other species except for salmonoids seem to have more adaptability."
