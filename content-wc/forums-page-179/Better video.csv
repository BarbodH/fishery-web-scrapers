Very close to were he unloaded is a lake that pike and only pike breed in and you cant fish it. In the spring when the snow melts the water rises and they can get into and out of the main lake. Its so full of pike you will get sick and tired of catching them. Also that lake is spring fed and stays really cold all summer. He should have went for these, that walleye is from the same lake and tougher to catch. Lake trout are also in there and i know of one person who has seen one caught."
