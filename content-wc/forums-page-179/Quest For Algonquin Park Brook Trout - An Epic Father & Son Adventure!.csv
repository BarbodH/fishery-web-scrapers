5572233,Moosebunk,2017-05-26 14:05:00,211,"Fishing looked phenomenal. Well beyond usual park standards that's for sure. Although they wouldn't likely complain, don't think my daughters would ever go for this kind of slogging through the bush. Brandon is a real trooper of a lad!"
5572297,Mike Borger,2017-05-26 15:12:00,1554,"Thanks man. I've been fishing Algonquin for 35 years and never done that well, definitely above park standards!I think kids in general (or at least some) would respond to a challenge like that. I think your daughters might surprise you. I'll bet they would enjoy the whole adventure aspect of a trip like that.Bren is cool. 10 years old going on 30."
5576801,fishron,2017-05-29 16:05:00,317,I know this is a walleye site but I have to salute you on your recent trip into the park. I've been in for a couple of trips later in the season when the trout are deep. What you and your son accomplished rivals trips to northern Quebec and Ontario for brook trout for a fraction of the cost and a great more sense of doing it on your own. To be able to cast off the shore of your campsite and take beautiful trout is a dream most of us would never experience. Even that pales in comparison to the adventure you shared with your son. I hope you have a bunch more of those trips in the future.
5577353,Mike Borger,2017-05-29 20:12:00,1554,"Thank you, sincerely. For many reasons this was the best trip I've ever done. Because my son was along, certainly the size of the trout, and also because it was Algonquin. I had a park bio suggest to me that no one has done as well in that park since the year 1900 LOL! Perhaps a stretch, but it is exceedingly rare.My background is as a paddler and I spent many years of my adult life paddling solo in pursuit of brook trout. Many, many really long expeditions. Introducing my son to what I truly love before I'm not able is very important to me.Yes, going forward I will be doing more canoe trips with Brendan. He's scheduled to join me at two different remote outposts in northern Manitoba this summer. Burnie Lake with Gangler's in July and Edmund Lake in August. He was begging me to cancel one so we could go canoeing again. Love that kid LOL!Next year we will do a spring trip for trout, then I'm probably going to take the entire month of August and do a 4 week canoe trip to either Quetico or Wabakimi with him."
5582905,Ohio fisherman,2017-06-01 07:38:00,989,Mike - that is a great movie of a great trip! You and your son remind me of me and my son 25 years ago. My son now is a guide in Alaska. Ho flies a beaver on floats and is part owner of a beautiful lodge. I paddled all over Algonguin 40 some years ago. Never saw fish like that. Can I go with you next time? Best wishes.
5741185,tracybaker,2017-08-28 03:57:00,1,"Hey That was cool. My hubby loves canoeing and he will love the video. In fact, our family has been planning for a trip when my hubby comes from the US. So that definitely we will be choosing the Algonquin park as our trip destination. We want to enjoy the time and looking for some Algonquin Park reservation. Want to stay there for 10 days and enjoy the beauty."
5564218,Mike Borger,2017-05-23 14:04:00,1554,Thanks!! Yes we just got back this past Saturday. Trip was May 9-20.

5565034,Shortline,2017-05-23 18:37:00,234,Perhaps the most enjoyable YouTube video I have ever seen. Great job being a dad!And I must note that your boy acts far beyond his age.....he is an old salt in a young mans body!
5565154,Mike Borger,2017-05-23 19:18:00,1554,"Pat, it was in a plastic bottle, what do you think? LOL!Quote: Originally Posted by ShortlinePerhaps the most enjoyable YouTube video I have ever seen.

That's really high praise.Like every dad I'm proud of my son, but I do agree. He's such a great fishing partner."
5565346,DeBo,2017-05-23 19:59:00,211,Great vid Mike! Fantastic looking water up there and some whopper brookies! Enjoyed the prep vids too. Are those seat backs in the canoe removable?
5565506,kona77,2017-05-23 20:33:00,236,Very neat adventure with your son !!!! Those were some beautiful brookies.
5565522,Mike Borger,2017-05-23 20:51:00,1554,Thanks! Yes they both have straps with buckles underneath that go around the canoe seats. Easily removable. Quote: Originally Posted by kona77Very neat adventure with your son !!!! Those were some beautiful brookies.Thanks! It was and they sure were.
5570809,Mike Borger,2017-05-25 21:31:00,1554,"For the guys that messaged me, my apologies. I was forced to edit the video a bit. It's live again now.Cheers"
5571009,gordy28,2017-05-26 04:54:00,437,Awesome vid and looks like a great trip Mike. I think I am jealous of your son. He's a fishing machine and gets to do a lot of cool trips lol
5571161,Mike Borger,2017-05-26 06:13:00,1554,"Thanks Gordy. Including my son is the best part of what I do, it means everything to me."
5562394,Mike Borger,2017-05-22 22:25:00,1554,"I have been in the fortunate position to have traveled all over Canada to fish, but at my core I am and always will be a paddler.Since the kids were born my canoe trips dwindled, but I've never lost the desire. For me this was the first trip of substance in quite some time. For my 10 year old son Brendan it was his very first.We spent 12 days tripping deep into the interior of the park carrying heavy loads for many miles over rough portages and paddling for days on end. For a kid this wasn't simply getting his feet wet, he jumped right into the pool! He is definitely my son because he never gave up once and handled the hardships without complaints. I was incredibly proud.Along the way we caught numerous large wild brook trout, several well over 5 pounds. That is something I've never done before in Algonquin Park, and it was a big surprise. For a kid's first trip, well, he hit the lottery!For many reasons this was the best trip I've ever done in my life. I've pieced together an almost 50 minute video chronicling the entire adventure.Have a look and come along for the ride! https://youtu.be/i9OSV-Q24F4?t=1s"
5562618,walleye22,2017-05-23 05:28:00,59,"what a great post. excellent trip. As i love to fly fish, my goal some year is to find a place where i can fly fish for brookies some days but also get in a boat and fish for those walleyes. that would be my perfect trip. Any reccomondations from folks on places to go for this and not break the bank...i am all ears. Great trip!!!"
5562674,fishron,2017-05-23 05:58:00,317,"What a great adventure, Mike. Great trout and a lifetime of memories. I took two canoe trips to Algonquin fifty years ago. Later in the season it was smallmouth and chub when I did fish. My companions...my brother and the scouts were more into the canoeing and camping than fishing. Thanks for sharing."
5562706,Bstar,2017-05-23 06:08:00,564,What a fantastic trip for both you and your son and great fishing to boot! Thanks for sharing. I'm sure neither of you will forget this trip for many years to come.
5563394,Mike Borger,2017-05-23 09:23:00,1554,"Thanks, very glad you liked! Your question is an easy one to answer. The Trident Lake outpost on a widening of the Esnagami River north of Nakina. It has everything you're looking for and is quite reasonably priced imo.http://nakinanorthoutfitters.ca/trident-lake/Here's a trip report from last year in late May:http://www.canadafishingguide.net/tr...trout-bonanza/"
5563410,Mike Borger,2017-05-23 09:25:00,1554,"Very glad you enjoyed it! Fact is the vast majority of the people who canoe trip in Algonquin are more eco-tourists and paddler's rather than fishermen, thank goodness."
5563418,Mike Borger,2017-05-23 09:26:00,1554,"Thanks, and you are correct. It will be remembered for a long time."
5563498,pjshorthorn,2017-05-23 09:43:00,5654,Thanks for posting the video of your trip Mike. That is a trip of a lifetime with your son. My best trip ever to Canada was when my son was 10. Last year was a very close 1st......let's call both trips equal......when was 21. You will have so many more great trips together !!!! Tell Brendan that we now know what a Canadian Sherpa looks like I bet he felt like he was climbing Mt. Everest carrying that pack. I about spewed my coffee when you said you had run out of gas on day 1. How does a guy run out of gas on two different trips with his son ?...... PjShorthorn
5563802,Mike Borger,2017-05-23 11:43:00,1554,You are sharp as a tack aren't you? LOL! Thanks Pat
5564090,Shellback,2017-05-23 13:35:00,8083,Really great video. What a fantastic trip with your son! What was the date of your trip? I'm assuming recently?
