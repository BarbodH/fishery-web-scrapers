We added a few extras to the first design and came up with a spinner version as well. The hard part was remembering not to bend the cap when cracking a brew. If anyone is interested, I'd be happy to send a list of the compenents used.A word of advice. Recruit some friends to help collect caps. A person could end up in a 12 step program trying to do it on their own.Enjoy trying to improve the design!!!Tight Lines,PJ"
