2100490,Golden Eagle,2013-09-13 05:52:00,2642,"Bought the short stay license only one time, in 1959. Have purchased an annual license every year since, except 1965, 1980, and 1982 when I didn't make it up yonder.Buying through the internet works great for me."
2097297,Joek3,2013-09-11 13:43:00,244,"For those buying the 8 day version, do you typically buy online before going up or stop in Canada and buy it?Thanks"
2097345,Lovetofish,2013-09-11 14:22:00,458,"Buy ours on-line, same with an Outdoors Card renewal. Saves a stop."
2097393,sped28,2013-09-11 14:53:00,18,bought ours there so we could pick up a regulation book at the same time
2098626,REG,2013-09-12 06:46:00,445,"We buy it up there. Thought about on-line but what if something happens last minute and we can't make it? It's never happened, but those licenses aren't cheap. We just try to start the trip a little earlier and then enjoy our stops along the way - including our first stop in Canada at the Big Bear Shell before getting on 502."
2098674,bigdaddyguns,2013-09-12 07:10:00,608,We buy them on-line. I find the on-line process to be much more convenient and a time saver for our situation.
2098794,stjoeguy,2013-09-12 07:54:00,979,"We always stop to get a license at Rainy Lake Sports in Fort Frances, ON. It's our traditional first stop in Canada. Wandering through the bait shop while everyone gets a license is just part of the trip for us."
2099026,1860Angler,2013-09-12 09:16:00,2642,"Buy online, print it, sign and in my wallet it goes, 5 minutes or less. This year I had to get a new Outdoors Card, same thing it all prints on one page and you are good to go. One less thing to worry about when getting to Canada. Ontario has a great online license system that I wish MN would go to."
2099617,wallydave,2013-09-12 14:44:00,2151,"I like the security of having the card and license in my hands before leaving. Less things to worry about, plus less waiting in line!"
2099945,packpro,2013-09-12 18:07:00,695,"We buys ours on line. It takes an hour to get all the licenses written when we arrive, and everyone is jumping out of their skin to get on the water after the drive. Our camp owner is writing less every year and told us to get them on line for next years trip as they may not offer it in camp."
2100073,Pawchaser,2013-09-12 19:09:00,31,We stay at a camp on Red Lake that includes 8 day licenses in their packages. We spend 4-5 wks a yr there; a wk or 2 in the spring and then back for 3 wks in the fall (we just got home). The camp includes yearly license for us due to the length of our stay and we are not charged extra for it. Takes our camp owner less than 5 minutes to run both Outdoor cards and print 2 license. If I remember correctly the camp did not raise pkg prices when they made this change but did it to promote conservation licenses.
