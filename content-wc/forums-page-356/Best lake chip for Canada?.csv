2098249,Mrnovice,2013-09-11 20:53:00,75,I have a Humminbird 597 ci HD and in the market for a lake chp. Any thoughts on the lakemaster or navionics for a unit like this? Thanks
2098634,bigdaddyguns,2013-09-12 06:47:00,608,I have the same unit and did this search a few years back and found Lakemaster does not provide any internal Canadian lake coverage. Navionics does provide selected Canadian lake coverage. The lakes supported are published on their web site.
2098986,KHedquist,2013-09-12 08:52:00,4367,"Look at the Navionics + chip, you select the lakes you want and download it to the chip. You can download both US and Canadian lakes to one chip Compatibility chart http://www.navionics.com/sites/www.n...ilityGuide.pdf Nav + link http://www.navionics.com/en/navionicsplus"
2099641,downriverbob,2013-09-12 14:47:00,880,I downloaded the Lake of the Woods mapping for my Lowrance HDS-8 with the Navionics +. I was totally happy until I saw the Lakemaster chip another guest at the resort had on his Hummingbird unit. The detail was superior to the Navonics +. BOB

2100586,Mrnovice,2013-09-13 06:33:00,75,"I'm from MN and bought the lakemaster chip just for the MN lakes, haven't really tried it out much. I mostly fish Lac Seul and Tobin Lake in Sask. I didn't know you can just download the lakes you want with the navionics program. Digging deeper, it appears lakemaster doesn't have a lot of Canadian lakes.....unless I am missing something"
2100610,KHedquist,2013-09-13 06:37:00,4367,"Look into the Navionics + you can have one chip that you can add or download Canadian Lakes and US lakes all on one chip, until its maxed out at 2GB which is a lot of lakes I will be happy to answer your questions"
