2102377,pjshorthorn,2013-09-14 09:07:00,5654,Anyone going to Lac Seul Outposts 9/22 - 9/27 ?I'll be glad to share any information I can on areas that have been successful fishing for myself over the years while I'm in camp.PJ
2102505,jimirjr,2013-09-14 10:15:00,1149,"Hi, We are planning a ""houseboat"" trip for the Fall of 2014.... I'd appreciate any info You might gather from Your trip THIS year... Thanks ahead, JIMI R."
2102617,pjshorthorn,2013-09-14 11:06:00,5654,"Jimirjr.I've used Sioux Lookout Floating Lodges. Good outfit. Lac Seul Floating Lodges is nice as well from the feedback I've heard.We have used the houseboat experience for a number of years and enjoyed it quite a bit. The only thing to consider is that it can be quite a bit of work to beach and tie off when you find your spot. Same when it comes time to leave. We have left the houseboat thing to younger fellas who don't mind pulling on the ropes and lugging all their own gear. It can be quite a bit of work, but not something I wouldn't do again.Great way to see the lake at a leisurely pace ( 10 mph wide open). If you haven't navigated the lake yourself, you may want to consider using a guide. Limits your liability and you get to enjoy the ride. I navigated our boat for 10 years and liked the challenge. It was a little nerve racking at times, but we always faired well with no major mistakes. We have seen guys drop a lower unit in the Rags, get hung up on a reef in a narrows and just be silly.Two words of advice for any houseboater:- Make sure you find a sturdy stick to plunge the toilet and have the youngest guy on the trip take care of it every day as part of their daily chores.- Make sure no one allows the flush handle on the toilet(s) to get hung up. The water will run , fill the holding tanks and then you have one heck of a mess on your hands. Learned that from a fella who came back to his houseboat at lunch only to find one heck of a problem. Make sure the young guy is in charge of checking toilets every time before the group runs off for their ""next best fishing day...ever"". My son became the ""stickman"" at 10. It was a right of passage.....I'll be sure to post a fishing report after I return....Tight Lines,PJ"
2102737,milfish,2013-09-14 12:55:00,249,I'm Going in on Friday night the 27th for a week. They'll pick us up at deception landing at 5:00. Been doing the trip for 20 years. Pretty hard to beat this time of year. We would love to chat with you upon our arrival to get any helpful tips and share a few beers.Milfish
2102745,jimirjr,2013-09-14 12:55:00,1149,"PJ......I'm laughing as I read Your post.....We have done HB trips on LOW before... We have driven ourselves... back in the ""OLD"" days BEFORE GPS... all You had was a map. Once You got off the ""main marked channels"" it was a bit tricky.Now with GPS, its basically follow the red line till you deviate from the marked main channel and You wanna park the HB... At 63, I'm still nimble enough to tie off the ropes.... thank goodness. We hope to bring a couple of ""youngsters"" next year..!We usually do a 10 day trip with 4 guys and 2 boats... AND YES, we have watched the ""poop pile"" coming closer to the bottom of the toilet a couple times... till We figured out that You just needed to move the HB a bit and make it ""shake"" somewhat to lower (spread out) that pile... lol!AND Yes, We have gotten the HB stuck before on rocks, reefs, sandy beach, etc.... always figured out how to get off though. As it is, the FALL is the best time to go, NO BUGS, great weather, (usually) and more solitude..."
2102793,pjshorthorn,2013-09-14 13:42:00,5654,"Milfish,I'm gonna miss you by a few hours on the 27th as I'll be going out in the morning. Should be in Winnipeg for my flight home by the time you fellas are heading up the lake.Best of luck and tight lines,PJ"
2102801,pjshorthorn,2013-09-14 13:53:00,5654,"jimirjr:I can only smile as you've done it all in regards to the ""hole"" HB experience.If you fellas are considering a trip next year to the NE section of Lac Seul on a HB, send me a PM and let me know your thoughts. I would consider being the captain and deckhand dujour. I can still pull the ropes as well.....if I have to...I think. Most of my group won't make it next year.We don't need no stink'in GPS where we are headingPJ"
2106202,milfish,2013-09-16 10:39:00,249,"PJ, sorry we'll miss touching base with you. If you can post any reports from camp that would be greatly appreciated. I will post results when we get back. I'm sure it will be great for you and for us as it seems that Lac Seul gets better every year. More and Bigger Fish! I've been told that Going up into China Lake from Scaler is great this time of year. Might give it a try this year. Never needed to before but a change of scenery might be fun and I'm told the beauty is fantastic up there.Good luck, be safe, have fun!Milfish."
2107394,pjshorthorn,2013-09-16 19:16:00,5654,"Milfish:No posts when I'm there...sorry! That's why I go to Canada......completely ""off the grid"" for 7 days......on purpose. The wife doesn't get it, but as I tell her...""it's a fishing thing, you wouldn't understand"".Send me a PM with your name and I'll be sure to leave notes with Brenda on my trip this year for you. I've kept a log for quite some time on most areas you would fish while in camp. I would be happy to share what I figured out while there this year.If you fellas make it into China Lake I would love to hear about it. I haven't done that before but seems shallow all the way there. I ran downstairs to the basement to look at the map on the wall - yes I have a 4' x6' map on the wall of the entire Lac Seul system..,kinda crazy. I've always caught decent size fish on the right shoreline when entering Scaler. Don't forget about the SE side of the island. Goes from 10-40 ft quick.Best of luck.Tight Lines,PJ"
