Something within a days drive would be great. We are most interested in catching big pike and some walleye for dinner if possible, but we are open to anything really. I've done a lot of fishing in Ontario but never been to Alberta. Any recommendations would be much appreciated.Cheers!"

Can supply a number of names if interested,good luck Chico."
