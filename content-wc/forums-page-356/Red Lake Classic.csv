2062289,tboying,2013-08-27 11:41:00,6,"Soulfulcry, I will be with a couple other guys on our annual Gullrock trip Sept 14-whenever and have never fished in the lower Red Lake area. We are talking about spending a day possibly in that area. Any tips on weed beds for Northern or walleye spots in that area."
2063361,SoulFulCry,2013-08-27 17:21:00,158,well dependas on what areas ur are goin to target the northern section to wards chukuni river n east bay the long straight past slate bay to martin bay and well maybe farther west towards potato island wolf narrows piepstone trout bay theres alot of area to go through if ya narrow it down for me im sure i can figure out somthing for ya
2065242,tboying,2013-08-28 11:29:00,6,Thanks for the response Soulfulcry. We will be traveling from Gullrock thru Keg so I would say anything within a few miles of Keg would be great. I haven't ever been into Red Lake fishing even though the first year I started going to Gullrock was in 1969 with my parents. missed a few years in there when my kids were small but it has been a yearly event for quite a while now. I love northern in the weeds and the guys fishing with me love walleyes so anything would be great.Thanks
2066634,SoulFulCry,2013-08-28 21:29:00,158,lets see i guess that from there ya can go to behind mckenzie island n then go across to the weed bed island its about 30 minutes from keg to there lots of pencil reeds on a long point i guess of them n slate bay ususally has some big gators this time of yr ummm every so often the upper chukuni has some big monsters in the current n down by the red marker bouy just insice the mouth of the river the islands in hoyles n reeefs ussually have alot of big gators n east bay to ummmm i guess thats a bout it hope this helps a lil tc have a great dfay nite or trip lol
2067786,tackleman,2013-08-29 10:31:00,444,"Hey soulfulcry, given that the thread is titled, red lake fall classic, I thought you would be putting up some hot walleye spots for the contestants, I know I could use some, out behind Mckenzie Island,"
2068170,tboying,2013-08-29 12:57:00,6,"Thanks, Soulfulcry. I am getting a map from a frend to make some copies so I can find out the places you are talking about. If you see a sparkly skeeter walleye rig come over and say hi, That is what a buddy of mine has and what I get to fish in. Thanks again, can't wait to get there."
