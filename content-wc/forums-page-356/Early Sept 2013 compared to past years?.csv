2103473,forgop,2013-09-15 05:36:00,880,"I just returned from my first fly-in trip in Ontario on Friday night and was quite disappointed in the walleye fishing. Water levels were quite high compared to years past evidently and weather was quite variable with quite a bit of rain. I've talked to a couple of people who fished literally the same week we were out or within the last couple of weeks with the same outfitter and reported walleye just weren't hitting with the same abundance and in some cases, reported to have some of their worst fishing in 30+ years. I recognize you'll have your good/bad days with any fishing as it pertains to weather, water levels, type of baits, etc, but wondered if anyone else who has gone recently could confirm they had some difficulty this year meeting anywhere close to the numbers of walleye caught in prior years. The lake we went to was highly recommended and we're talking about a return trip in 2 years and have already discussed going to a different lake. One person who has fished the same lake several times said not to take this year's results and shy away from it because this is a ""bad year"" so to speak. How did your results this year differ compared to the past?"
2103585,SinOrSwim,2013-09-15 07:16:00,1528,"Where did you go? I'm trying to remember but was curious if it was Gull? I know someone was going recently?We went on the same fly-in for over 12 years and there were definitely some years better than others. We went to Lac Seul last year and ran into the same thing you did. Fishing was blah! But, everyone in camp was saying the same thing. Temps in September were in the 80's and possibly low 90's. Just such big swings. We just got back from Lac Seul again and had great fishing up until about 1pm. Then, after that we should have just gone back to the cabin or gone golfing or something. The bite turned off completely. You would get some small ones but that was about it."

2104489,Pooch,2013-09-15 14:15:00,4619,"Jim's 2013 Labor Day Mahkwa Report (Ghost writer Gary) Day one meeting point at Little Vermilion didn't work out well as it was raining quite hard. Bob and Gary had arrived at eleven AM and were doing well back trolling spinners and leeches. Their total was 34 small mouth with largest being eighteen inches with several doubles. They were driven off lake by hard rain at five PM. As they were leaving they met Bill, Brad and Joe on road coming into park (timing is everything) and were told that night at Lamplighter had been cancelled in lieu of going straight to camp for the night. That worked out great as Mike picked up minnows and everyone met at camp Boats were put in that night allowing for an early start the next morning gaining a half day fishing over the original plan. Good, No, Great call Mike! Boat crews were set up with Dick, Brent and Joe fishing out of Jim's boat. Bob and Gary stayed together in Gary's while Mike, Bill and Brad fished out of Mike's freshly reset up Lund. A special thanks goes to Jim for putting Dick and Brent in his boat for the trip. You were missed Jim! Bill joined the group for the first time. Welcome Bill. A major change was implemented in the daily schedule. We came in at between noon and 1 PM for lunch leaving the option up to each boat as to go right back out after lunch or rest for a couple hours during the high sun of the day. This left the late afternoon and evening bite open for a longer fishing evening. This worked better than the former years schedule and everyone agreed it was a good change.Day one on LS saw wind and rough water with comfortable temperatures. It was a jig bite. Spinners were not working as well as jigs. Live minnows were working well, but to Brad's chagrin; Bill was smoking hot on salted minnows. Brad set the bar high right away by putting a 27 walleye in the boat. Mike's boat fished First Island and did really well on numbers and great size. Gary picked up an eighteen inch smally on a jig tipped with plastic minnow and salted/boraxed leech. Walleye were hitting the same rig. Home preserved leeches left over from past trips did as well on spinners as live leeches. Didn't get report from Dick and crew. Fish counts for the day were: Gary's boat 98 W & 1 SM / Dick's boat 69W / Mike's boat 137W. Overall, a really good start to a great trip.Day two started calm, but wind picked up forcing Gary's boat off Dominion. G&B killed time fishing islands a mile south away from the open water for two hours until wind slowed down then returned to Dominion area. Wind settled down and it became hot and nearly flat water. Fish didn't seem to care and were cooperative. Mike's boat stayed on fish at First Island. Dick moved around fishing numerous spots including the Archie's landing bridge. Counts for the day were: Gary's boat 68W / Dick's boat 39W / Mike's boat 105W. A little slower day, but still a good day.Day three woke from an overnight storm and quite cold and windy conditions. Gary's contraband electric heater and Mike's open stove door a welcome addition to the cabin this morning. There seemed to be a lack of enthusiasm for leaving the cabin this morning. Mike stirred up blueberry pancakes and sausage. Another good call Mike. Pancakes seemed to fortify the group to get on the water. Gary's boat to Eagle fishing deeper water. Mike's boat to their honey hole for starters. Dick and crew to Emerald Reef and maybe Windigo. Fishing was better than expected for given conditions. Counts were: Gary's boat 115W & 37N / Dick's boat 46W / Mike's boat 121W.Day four brought a really nice morning with light winds out of the north. Brad and Bill went to Archie's bridge at daylight and caught a dozen nice fish including (I think) a 23 & 24W before returning to cabin for breakfast. G&B back to Dominion's. Fished all around the area and found two new spots to fish. Fish were located in probably never fished areas and were no doubt virgin fish. Gary claimed to probably have lost the walleye of a lifetime. Had fish on for several minutes, but was lost before seeing it. Any more information than that will cost you money . Gary's boat had fifty walleye by ten o'clock in the morning. A first for G&B. Mike's boat showed up and fished several spots including rock piles south of Chambers Island. Didn't get a report on location from Dick, but it was rumored that they fished M,B and Bill's honey hole. Gary's boat came in early to pack. Totals were: Gary's boat 107W / Dick's boat 55W / Mike's boat 149W.Note: Joe picked up a thirty seven inch northern and Bob did the same, but I don't know which day it was. Mike caught his first small mouth on a spinner. A recap of the fish quality and numbers is that it was a fantastic year for both. Many, many fish in and over the slot were caught by all boats. I can't say how many, but there were many 24, 25 and 26 fish brought into the boats. As an example, In Gary's boat the third day out of 115 walleye, fewer than a dozen were under the slot. I believe the same ratio was probably experienced by all boats at some point during the trip. It was just a very high quality trip for size and numbers. Maybe a little divine intervention on Ray's part? Three fish dinners were served by Mike. The last fish day he tried lemon pepper batter using milk with a little dab of sour cream for a rinse. Andy's seasoning was used on all the rest of the fish. The lemon pepper was nice change and good. Made the fish oil quite dirty though. Probably should not do the lemon pepper thing it until the oil is nearly used up. Camp dogs seemed to approve of the new flavor as they upset the cooker while it was cooling after lunch. Made themselves quite scarce the rest of the trip.Bait: Three bags of ten dozen (very nice) minnows each were purchased at J&B's. Dick kept his in a bucket in the lake. Gary's and Mike's boat kept theirs in a large white cooler with Gary's filter pump / large aerator and large stone / small aerator and small stone. Minnows were left at room temperature and did really well the entire trip. With water incrementally changed every day they should last indefinitely. Bags of O2 minnows were allowed to soak in the cooler to acclimate them to the coolers water temperature which hovered around 68 degrees the entire trip. On the hot days a frozen half gallon milk jug of water was put into the cooler without the lid to maintain temperatures slightly cooler. Cooler lid must be kept closed to prevent minnows from jumping out. Insulated and aerated boat bucket kept minnows far better than floating minnow bucket. Lake water temperatures hovered around the high sixties to low seventies. Temperatures inside the floating minnow buckets probably soared. Leeches were bought at Larry's in Kakabeka Falls by Gary and Bob at $38 a pound. Gary's boat 1#, Dick and Mike's each ½ pound. PRETTY MUCH ALL BAIT WAS USED UP. Brad bought a few minnows at the Mahkwa service center and they were nice minnows. Same price as J&B? If Bill hadn't of been using salted minnows, Mike's boat would have ran short of minnows quite early in trip. In Gary's boat leeches were more or less as good as minnows on a jig. Other boats experience?Jig colors: Everything seemed to work. G&B stayed with home painted medium blue and there was no reason to change. Mike and Dick's boat using all colors. Bill favored gold while Brad took a liking to the Cotton Candy colored jig. Others were less verbal about their best colors.Spinner colors: Blue beads and a purple blade was a constant producer. G&B had two out of four days that it was a good spinner bite. Both were too windy to jig in. Boat control was all but nonexistent those days. Those days if you moved out of the rough water you didn't catch fish.Trip costs: Mike has all information, sorry.Trip high lights and surprises! #1 Bob lost three bottom bouncers first day to knot failure #2 Dick's boat lost minnow bucket, but was able to retrieve. #3 This group can eat a lot of fish. #4 No WIFI available in cabin area. (Probably not a surprise) #5 Bill's salted minnows out fished live minnows. #6 Changed eating schedule worked great. #7 Mike's reel fell off rod while catching a fish. He was able to hand line reel and fish back to the boat. #8 Does #7 sound vaguely familiar like it is a twist on another Mike incident two years ago? #9 Small window air conditioner in kitchen window when we arrived. Appreciated! #10 Hail hurts. #11 Looking at pictures of the 2008 trip we realized that we all look older, but for Joe. #12 Mahkwa furnished trash bags are just that . Trash. #13 We all bring too much stuff to camp. (Probably also not a surprise) #14 Dick and Joe vying for smallest walleye. #15 Mike was accused of hiding Brad's smokes. #15 Bill whacks his own head/hat with jig. #16 Mike's trailer has short in running lights, blowing fuses. #17 Mahkwa had a Labor Day fishing contest that we didn't know about. Probably could have won it. #18 Bill brings a mini mart on the trip. Might need a venders license next year. #19 Every boat caught a Rock Bass this year. #20 Very few small mouth caught while targeting walleye this year than past years. #21 Two new cabins under construction this year. One six man next to large one on end. Smaller one on south end. #22 Many, many sauger caught this year. #23 Windigo pretty much a no producer. Few boats seen there from other groups as well. #24 Most of the usual spots were not working this year. #25 Need to find more spots to have more options when fishing gets tough. #26 Group appears to be more inclined to hunt fish and try new tactics than past years. #27 Small electric heater a good addition to the trip along with a good high volume fan. #28 This group is tough! No one is safe from harassment. Thin skinned folks need not apply! #29 Brent is the only sane person in this group. #30 And the winning surprise is: Mahkwa gave us the first night free.Some suggestions for Christmas gifts: Brad could use a door closer Bob and maybe Dick could use a book on knots Bill could use an off switch as none of us could find it. Gary would like a larger volume for storage Suburban Mike could use a lockout for the fridge temperature controlPAGE DOWN IIIV Winner of the first annual Ray Kruse Memorial is? The Brad! 27 Walleye"
