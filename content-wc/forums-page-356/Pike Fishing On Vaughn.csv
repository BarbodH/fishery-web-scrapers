Has anyone fished Vaughn in the fall for pike? If so, any tips on best places on that lake. He is expecting the pike to be moving into shallow water before he arrives."

Didn't target pike, but caught several half decent (fun) thirty seven inch pike while trolling spinners and jigging minnows from 15 to 35 foot deep.We didn't even consider going into Vaughn this time of year. Pike might be there, but I suspect they could still be deep. Surface temps were 68 last week.How about a trip report when you get back. This past Labor Day trip was on of the best we have ever had for walleye. Usually catch quite a few small mouth while fishing for walleye, but only a couple this year.In case you are interested, there are a half dozen pictures of the trip on my albums page under Pooch.Have a good trip.Pooch"
