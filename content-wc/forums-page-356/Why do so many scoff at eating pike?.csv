2094266,port1042,2013-09-10 06:51:00,509,First ate pike after my first Ontario trip last fall. Came home with a limit of walleyes and a limit of pike. Both fried up to make terrific dinners. I wouldn't come home without both! What's the point of trying to figure out which is better? It's not like you have to make a choice. The limit is isn't 2 fish -- it's 2 of each. I'm learning to filet the pike. The lodge we stay at cleans the fish and they can filet a pike as fast as a walleye and I've never found a bone in a filet. They are happy to show me how it's done but it does take some practice to master the art. I've tried to explain to my wife that if I made a few extra trips I could learn to do it. She's not buying it.
2094290,octanehi5,2013-09-10 07:01:00,1104,"Its all in the care of the fish you harvest,keeping your area clean were you clean your fish has alot to do with taste. Five nice fillets can be had from pike without bones, It is very differant cleaning a pike from a walleye and not getting bones. Pike is a little darker meat,thicker,More time to clean, Fresh in a pan of hot peanut oil,coated with beer batter, Are very hard to tell from walleye. When we are in camp, many fish get fried no one asks what kind it is , all good. My personal favorite are walleye cheeks,walleye and pike in that order.Our group waits all yr to go to the lake we fish(fly in),Any fish that gets hooked comes in the boat. we have had a few guys that did not want to boat big pike,They do not fish with us any more. Lac Hebert In northern Quebec has its own slot limit on fish 14 to 20""on walleye and 28"" on pike that can be harvested. A fish that is 8yrs old will not be as good as one that is only 4 yrs old,age old saying closer to the bone sweeter the meat, is very true.We eat fish in camp 4 times a week never had a bad pike or walleye,The labatts blue and cubin cigars go very well with those meals. Only nine monthes to go back"
2094746,Steve Ediger,2013-09-10 11:05:00,97,"I think the real reason people scoff at eating pike is they have not yet mastered filleting a pike and won't bring themselves to admit it. It's not the easiest thing to do, and takes some practice,but you also get a feeling of satisfaction when you figure it out. Oh, they taste pretty good too."
2097305,lawson2343,2013-09-11 13:49:00,459,"We love both walleyes and pike. I would much rather fillet a walleye than a pike. I have learned how to take the Y-bones out of a northern, but there is always some waste with that. Here is one way we like to eat our pike. Grill 'em. Don't even take the Y-bones out. After they are cooked, it is easy to feel the line of bones with your finger. Run your fork or knife down the line of bones and twist to separate. The bones stick right out and are easy to pick. No waste of meat either. I use a fish grill plate. Remove all skin from the fillet and rinse very well to make sure you have no slime anywhere. I baste both sides of the fillet in a butter/olive oil mix. Season to your taste! Don't over cook it. I fed four couples a meal this summer after our Canada trip and every one loved it."
2097961,brochet,2013-09-11 19:11:00,88,"dosent anybody fish for fun and exciement anymore?forget about which one tastes better.there is absolutely no comparison between catching pike or walleye.id rather catch one pike than 100 walleye.keep the walleye for eating,release the pike ."
2098017,Gipper,2013-09-11 19:32:00,76,"The only thing I would add is the larger the pike the easier it is to filet. I filet only a few a year and it takes me more time to do it right. and get the most meat. I find it to be firm, tasty meat."
2098834,octanehi5,2013-09-12 08:06:00,1104,"Brochet, the post is about weather or not people like to eat pike or walleye.Perhaps a posting on your part as to what you like to catch,your view of your c&r of pike, This is Walleye central,Pike and walleye still taste great. We love the art of fishing my crew of 6 guys caught 2250 walleye and 150 pike on our week of fishing the great north,98% of these fish are back in the lake"
2099170,BreezyPoint,2013-09-12 10:15:00,1581,"I'm with you on this one...too much waste removing y-bones when they are so easy to remove after cooking. I think fresh northern tastes great and we grill them too, with hickory chips. One thing I've noticed is that northerns don't seem to keep well in a freezer and we only eat them fresh."
2100602,doubleheader,2013-09-13 06:35:00,2652,"Not that much waste when done correctly, I know, I've watched experts, I'm not one. To me there are three types of fish, those that taste excellent, those that taste very good, and those that suck. Freshly caught eater size walleye are excellent, fresh pike are very good. Frozen eater size walleye are very good, frozen pike sucks. Personally I prefer fresh perch to anything that swims in fresh water."
2102217,orchard frank,2013-09-14 07:42:00,1900,"Always catch some good-sized pike during fall walleye fishing. A fat 32-36"" out of the cold Oct.-Nov water will make a great chowder, I like that size for the thick chunks. The secret (Shhh!) is to throw in some smoked salmon right at the end."
2073345,Fish_Heads,2013-09-01 06:30:00,154,"Because a Muskie fillet will fit a 3' sub bun just perfect for that game day get together. You can also use a pike too if you get one 42"" or over to get the same fillet size. Garnish with deep fried hard boiled bald eagle eggs (bread 'em up like hushpuppies) for a special treat !"
2073489,ohiojmj,2013-09-01 07:51:00,1262,"I could care less what others eat and it's none of my business if the fishing regs are followed. I enjoy fresh fried pike as much as walleye and perch, perhaps because it's so fresh when I filet eater sized pike and have them in the fryer within the hour. Everyone has different taste and I respect that. I'm well past the 3rd grade era of knocking someone with different ideas."
2074017,Campcountry,2013-09-01 10:08:00,164,"Many people have been turned off to eating pike by the horrible childhood experience of the annual family summer vacation. They camp or rent a cabin at a shallow lake in the middle of summer and dad proceeds to go fishing (his once a year outing) and catches a few of those yellow squishy fleshed hammer handles that you find in the shallow weedy lakes in the hot summer. Fish for supper kids! Never mind taking out the y bones, the kids are lucky if the ribs are taken out! That experience scars them for life and they in turn warn their friends...."
2074385,adempsey,2013-09-01 13:03:00,963,Lol! No doubt.
2075041,Guest,2013-09-01 20:19:00,0,As its been put to me many times Pike are for guys who don't know how to catch Walleye. But if done right are ok just take to darn long when the bugs are trying to carry you away. I can do 5 eyes in less time then a 4 lb Pike...
2075713,ohiojmj,2013-09-02 07:56:00,1262,Maybe walleye are for guys that can't learn to make boneless filets of pike.
2076025,elkman99,2013-09-02 09:09:00,180,"LOL! You just haven't lived (or almost died) until you have had a mouth full of Y-bones Fresh pike and Bluegill are my 2 favorite fish. Walleye, Perch, Crappie are not far behind. Man, get me a hot skillet and some cold Labatts!"
2076369,brochet,2013-09-02 11:09:00,88,"pike are very slow growing,and the small ones have small y bones.these y bones can get stuck in your windpipe.this happened to me and believe me y don't want this to happen.releace all pike ,so they can grow and give you an experience no walleye can.eat the walleys."
2076449,drlee,2013-09-02 11:36:00,409,"Much prefer walleye. I find the meat to be more firm, slightly sweet tasting, and not strong or unpleasant fishy taste. I like them baked or fried. As to NP, I think they are actually less firm, stronger fish flavor, and yes, the cleaning process influences my behavior. I certainly don't hate northerns, as to eating them, but any fisherman who brings one into my boat is subject to a $5 fine."
2094170,roscoe33,2013-09-10 01:15:00,653,"Nothing wrong with northern pike. Yes they are a bit tougher, especially the back mean, and more so if frozen or over cooked. It helps to put them on a stringer, and cut their throats so they bleed out. After 5 minutes, pull them in the boat and put them on ice. just for grins, I ate a smallmouth on our spring trip this year. It was delish !!. Massively thick filets. 4x the meat than off an equal length walleye. walleye, northern, perch, or smallies, they are all good eating."
2070633,Hawkfan,2013-08-30 13:10:00,237,"I brought my first one home last year to do just that. I need to tweak the recipe a little, but it turned out pretty good."
2070825,Kansas Bound,2013-08-30 15:05:00,152,Fresh they taste very similar to me but coming out of the freezer the pike just don't taste nearly as good as the eyes.
2071073,hogridnfool,2013-08-30 17:34:00,349,"De-bone them, cut into shrimp sized pieces, coat and deep-fry, serve them up as an appetizer with Hoffman House Shrimp Sauce and ice-cold LaBatts while waiting for the main course of Walleyes....PRICELESS!!"
2071121,btmbncr,2013-08-30 18:54:00,492,"I learned years ago how to fillet the Y bones out of pike.Ate them for a while.Don't like the taste,fried,baked,steamed,etc.Now there is a horrible fine for bring ""snot rockets"" in my boat!Fished Lac Seul for a month and only had 3 pike boat side and two had to be netted.Pike in the boat brings bad""juju"".Bill"
2071289,chevtow,2013-08-30 20:45:00,691,I like pike as long as its fresh. Just don't like it after its been frozen.
2071361,Moondog,2013-08-30 21:28:00,362,I would forget about eating pike. And I would forget about poaching them and getting the rest of the freakin' bones out. And I would forget about using........ PAULA DEAN'S politically incorrect CRAB CAKE RECIPE....... Best crab cakes I have ever had. IMHO.
2071377,kidsfishing,2013-08-30 21:32:00,12,"We eat pike all the time. They taste fine, but you have to keep the meat out of the slim when cleaning them. If the meats touches the slim it will taste terrible."
2073042,walleyeguess,2013-08-31 20:46:00,20,I like Pike. It tastes better than Walleye if you catch them in colder water. I caught a nice 10 lber in Northern Quebec a few years ago. There was 8 guys in our group and it was a feast. a trick to deal with the slime is to hang them in a tree in the shade for about half hour and all the slime dries up. Then go to work on them. Cut into bite size chunks beer batter and deep fry. Totally amazing.
2073169,gregk9,2013-08-31 22:53:00,625,Why eat Pike or Walleye when you can eat delicious Bass????
2073265,bob888,2013-09-01 05:12:00,244,The only northern pike I eat come out of Lake of the Woods. Excellent tasting fish. Much prefer pike to walleye when baking them as the flesh holds together better and the nutty flavor comes thru vs using a batter mix. Pike baked with lemon butter and chopped almonds on top my favorite..
2070185,HeHooksHimself,2013-08-30 09:25:00,725,"Why would you even consider eating pike when God gave us the most delicious fish in great abundance, with bit size pieces right off of the filet. we don't even bother bringing pike home, but we always bring home our limit of walleye. Yep dem eyes is some good eatin'"
2070201,jimirjr,2013-08-30 09:30:00,1149,"I like Pike.... filleting them is a PIA though. I can turn a 30"" pike into two 8"" fillets.... and be thankful...."
2070233,hawg,2013-08-30 10:14:00,2008,"The never ending debate if pike tastes as good as walleye. I can tell you this-when we have shore lunch with the pike guys they always eat the walleye first, the pike is last or leftover. I think they taste horrible."
2070297,tv4fish,2013-08-30 10:46:00,2694,I think there is a message/lesson there.............
2070329,troutwater,2013-08-30 10:51:00,299,"I totally agree with this, the Y bones and slime/odor give them a bad rap. A friend has a cabin up in Ontario and they eat pike all the time. Funny thing is one of their friends comes over for fish fries every few weeks. He cusses pike up and down and says how much he hates them, but turns out he has been eating them for years without even knowing it...they just tell him its perch or walleye and chunk it up small. They say it's really hard not to laugh when he compliments them on how good it is."
2070345,MrSimon,2013-08-30 11:00:00,922,LoL! That's funny.
2070401,DMella,2013-08-30 11:28:00,32,"We did a blind taste test with walleye and pike prepared pan fried and baked in foil exactly the same. 10 people took part and 4 of them were kids so they had less bias (I think ) They were each given while blindfolded a taste of both fish baked with a drink of water between and they chose the best and why... then given the two species fried.Pike won 10 to 0 in the baked preparation and 9 to 1 in the fried prep!In both cases the reasons were two...1- The testers liked the firm texture of the Pike over the slightly mushy texture of the walleye2- The testers thought the Pike flavor was less ""fishy"" than the walleyeI'm selling all my walleye tackle! Just Kidding I love figuring them out."
2070425,MC620,2013-08-30 11:37:00,91,"Shhhhhhh!!!!Pike taste awful. Dont bother eating them. Keep repeating this, over and over............."
2070601,Bigfish10702,2013-08-30 12:50:00,60,"We cut our Pike Filets into chunks, then boil them in Sprite. Then melt some butter with pepper and garlic and dip away. . . .spectacular !"
2070609,troutwater,2013-08-30 12:55:00,299,"OH man that sounds awesome. We did the ""poor man's lobster"" on the Manitou this year and really like that. We also wrapped some in tin foil along with butter, garlic, butter, onions, and some more butter and put it on the grill...amazing!"
2069841,troutwater,2013-08-30 07:50:00,299,"If there is one thing I've found over the last few years of fishing Canada is that a majority of fisherman look down on eating pike. I've found this interesting as I am one to not eat fish that much because I generally don't like it, but I do like pike...more so than even (gasp) walleye. I've fished clear deep water lakes to shallow meso lakes at all times of the summer and fall, and they all tasted just fine to everyone in our group. Just curious to see if there are any other fellow pike eaters out there."
2069873,v-bay gord,2013-08-30 07:57:00,3168,"For sure.....they are great eating fish. They are firmer textured than a walleye, and actually have a better flavor in my opinion. The ""y"" bones, and slippery exterior has earned them a bit of a bad rap."
2069881,lassh,2013-08-30 08:00:00,553,"I think many don't prefer pike because they don't have experience for removing the Y bones. Another factor may be that they are slimy and somewhat stinky to clean. I do like eating pike from up north, they are delicious, but still prefer walleye. I'd definitely rather clean an eye."
2069905,Fish_Heads,2013-08-30 08:10:00,154,"Most probably don't like them because, pike while close, they are a bit of a letdown after eating fresh muskie, especially the larger ones !"
2069913,SinOrSwim,2013-08-30 08:18:00,1528,"We hadn't eaten any pike for many years, not because what it did or did not taste like. We just didn't want them and their slim in the boat. We did everyting to keep them in the water and out of our boat. We have now changed out tunes a little a do clean a few. But, I'd rather clean 10 walleye to 1 Northern. Just my opinoin"
2069921,troutwater,2013-08-30 08:19:00,299,Heresy!!!
2069985,adempsey,2013-08-30 08:32:00,963,"I love eating Pike. Taste just as good as Walleye, IMO. I usually try to keep a couple smaller ones for my fish frys. My last couple of trips we had problems catching Walleye <18"", so the Pike made up for that.However, I am still working on cleaning them. It's not that difficult, but it takes some practice. Especially since I don't do it that often. I really do think it's a deterrent for many people. The fact that they can really smell doesn't help either.Also, I do believe they have a reputation as being poor table fare. That actually may be true from some water, but in my experience that's not the case for the more Northern lakes."
2070025,MrSimon,2013-08-30 08:44:00,922,"Pike are delicious! I love them. Everyone says cleaning walleye is easier, cleaner, and faster. While that is true to a point, someone with a lot of experience can clean and de-bone a pike almost as fast as a walleye ... and you usually get twice as much meat off an eater pike (24"") than an eater walleye (16"")."
2070113,Gregking,2013-08-30 09:04:00,2658,"Lmao I don't mind pike at all, I'm going to try my hand at pickling some this year. Very excited"
2070121,Hawker,2013-08-30 09:04:00,3967,"I'd just as soon eat a Pike as Walleye as long as it's ""fresh"" and hasn't been frozen. If I could freeze them in water (my preference) with no skin patch, that might be a different story, but I know from several trips home from LOTW with frozen pike, cleaning them with skin patch attached in a long clear plastic bag to be identified, just does not have the same ""zing"" as fresh! Seems to me the meat is ""mushy"" after thawing, and of course the stench of the slimy skin patch doesn't do much to enhance the experience.IMHO, fresh Pike is some good eating, baked or fried and will gladly dive into a plate full as long as some fried taters & onions are available too!!"
