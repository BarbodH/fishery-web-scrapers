2099154,NP4ME,2013-09-12 10:04:00,378,"Just wondering if any of you guys had trouble cashing/depositing your HST rebate checks. My bank said they now have to send the check to a collections agency to get the funds and said they were going to charge me $30 to do it. I'm curious why they did not want to just take the whole check from me, seeing as how my rebate wasn't much more than the $30 fee they were going to charge.Thanks for the help."
2099194,new hips,2013-09-12 10:17:00,498,"I also had to pay.....I thought $25 but it was the whole refund for the group, so it was worth it."
2099250,Steve Ediger,2013-09-12 10:59:00,97,I only had to pay the normal fee for exchange rate.
2099258,onetimedave,2013-09-12 11:02:00,502,I also had to pay a fee. I think it was $25.00 US. At the time of taking check to bank to deposit US $$$ were better than Canadian.
2099441,NP4ME,2013-09-12 12:32:00,378,"Steve,Any idea how much that was? Last year that's what my bank did, and I think it was about $8. I was not happy when they told me it was going to be $30 this year. However, seeing some of the other posts, maybe that is the new norm."
2099465,WallyNut,2013-09-12 12:49:00,79,"The reason the fee is so high is when the check is processed it has to be in an individual batch when sent to the Federal Reserve for processing. The cost to financial institution for the batch is $15.00 plus $5.00 for each item in that batch, plus other charges. The minimum cost to the institution would be $20.00. The more Canadian checks the institution processes they can afford to decrease their fee."
2099489,NP4ME,2013-09-12 13:00:00,378,"WallyNut, Thanks for the info. I just checked and I was only charged $2.51 in exchange rate fees when I made my deposit last year. Just trying to figure out the drastic jump this year. I know last year some guys said their banks did not charge anything at all. Just wondering if that is the case for people this year."
2099681,WallyNut,2013-09-12 14:58:00,79,The Federal Reserve just changed their pricing within the last year. Typically these fee change at the beginning of the year.
2099833,TIGHTLINER,2013-09-12 16:35:00,223,I also have had to pay the fees charged by the local banks in years past. For the last two years I have taken the check back to ontario and cashed it there with no problems. If the check is made out for $291.15 that is what I got back from the teller. I have been told the check is good until you cash it. If someone in the group is not going back figure out his share give it to him and then keep his part when you cash it. You will need two Id's to cash the check. It is so much easier and you are money ahead. This year i cashed the check at the soo and it was service with a smile. If you are not going back then you have to take your lumps and suck it up.
2100145,NP4ME,2013-09-12 19:46:00,378,"Well, luckily I won't have to ""take my lumps and suck it up."" I spoke to someone with the main branch of my bank, and they told me the teller got the whole situation mixed up. They deposited my check and only charged me the difference in the exchange rate...as they have done in the past. Thanks for the info."
