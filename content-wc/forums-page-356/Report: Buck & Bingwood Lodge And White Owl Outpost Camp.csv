2093017,Redear,2013-09-09 13:40:00,40,"Mike great post on Buck,we were looking at them for next yr also PK resorts.WE have been going to Nagagami 4 yrs and love the numbers and big eyes but might try a smaller lake for a change.I know never leave great fishing to find better fishing but you sound like an explorer from your posts.If you ever go to expeditions north lodge on nagagami you will be greeted by the camp dog a yellow lab named SOLO!!!!!Fred"
2093081,Mike Borger,2013-09-09 14:02:00,1554,"Granitehill lodge looked nice, I checked it out when I was over there. The deluxe boats that Buck and Bingwood has are really nice though, that was a huge factor for me.A lab named solo? HAHA! Expeditions North has been on my radar for a while now, maybe one day..."
2093145,adempsey,2013-09-09 14:38:00,963,"I wouldn't consider Buck or Granite Hill to be small lakes. I think I traveled more on Buck than I did on Nagagami. Of course, Buck and Granite Hill aren't big basin lakes like Nagagami, but I would guess they have far more shoreline.I think the fishing on all three lakes is probably comparable. The number of big eyes I caught on Buck were similar to my experience on Nagagami. However, I much preferred Buck in terms of how the lake was structured.I think David Zuhl runs a great camp and the fishing on Nagagami is great. Still, I'd recommend giving Buck a try just for something new."
2097329,Mike Borger,2013-09-11 14:13:00,1554,"Adam, I realize you said the fisheries are similar, but as someone who's fished both lakes, what's the biggest difference between the two? Why did you prefer the structure on Buck?Just curious as Nagagami is always universally praised."
2098354,adempsey,2013-09-11 22:53:00,963,"Well, what I was referring to was the structure of the lake itself.Nagagami is a basically a big round basin. That's somewhat boring if you ask me. A bit more susceptible to wind as well. Not many islands or bays to fish and explore. It's almost like heading out into one of the Great Lakes. Not really my vision of a Northern Canadian lake.I don't know why, but for me, it's just not that same thing as a lake that has plenty of islands, narrows, points and bays. The added benefit of plenty of wind protection this type of lakes provides surely helps too. That being said, the fishing on Nagagami was spectacular. Actually, we probably did better overall on Nagagami than on Buck. The quality of fish was similar though.Again, don't get me wrong. I'd head back to Nagagami without question. The camps and fishing are outstanding. However, for me there is just something about lakes with erratic shorelines, plenty of long narrow bays and dotted with islands that I find special."
2086233,Mike Borger,2013-09-06 08:47:00,1554,"In late August my entire family flew to Buck and Bingwood on Obakamiga lake west of Hornepayne. Joining us was a good friend and his family and they stayed in the cabin next to us.It was a long anticipated trip, and in every way it exceeded our expectation.We stayed at the Buck location, and it was a truly outstanding facility.Fishing with 4 kids it wasn't your normal kind of fly in trip, but still it was very good and we caught plenty of fat walleye throughout our stay.My wife Joanne caught her largest fish ever, a thick 43"" pike which she was quite proud of. I followed up with a 38"" fish of my own. Considering how little we actually fished for pike the results were pretty surprising!The highlight for us was a short one night jaunt at the end of the week to a new outpost that they'd recently aquired on White Owl lake.It had been sitting more or less vacant for a number of years so we were pretty eager to fish it.In less than one full day of fishing we easily landed 100+ fish between our two boats. It was fantastic! The camp itself was very nice and with a couple of minor improvements (a new deck and a water system) it will be absolutely primo. I definitely plan on going back to White Owl for a more extended stay in the future.All in all it was maybe in the top 3 fly in's I've ever done. The biggest testament to that is my entire family wants to go back next year. They've been to a lot of places with me and this is the first time they've said that.I've written a detailed report complete with photos and video. If anyone's interested you can see it here:http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...howtopic=71407Cheers, Mike"

2087457,new hips,2013-09-06 19:33:00,498,Thanks for sharing.......a great family trip.
2087609,kona77,2013-09-06 21:00:00,236,Another great report.. Thanks for all the effort that goes into your reports.
2089642,beer slayer,2013-09-07 21:56:00,33,"Hey Mike - Wow another great report! Fantastic pics & video, I have drove the Hornpayne road before, nice area for sure. Glad you and your family & friends had a good trip. And as per usual thank you very much for the trip report, you are a good guy! By the way I have booked again for June 2014 with Brad at 7 lakes. I am bushwacking my way down stream to get to those Albany river Brookies, come heck or highwater. I hope! I will be sure to let you know how that goes. Good fishing, Kenny"
2089769,Mike Borger,2013-09-08 04:30:00,1554,"Thank's gent's, very glad you enjoyed!Thanks Kenny, and it's nice to hear you enjoyed Marshall so much you're going back!I do think we need to talk though...the brookies aren't downstream, and you're no where near the Albany river LOL!"
2090889,schandm,2013-09-08 14:12:00,18,"Hi Mike. Great report. We fished this lake in 2004 with another outfitter. Great little lake for walleyes. If you ever return, you should try to find the portage to another small lake that was loaded with huge walleyes. As i recall, we had to go right from the dock down the lake into a small bay. The portage began at the back of the bay and was perhaps a quarter mile to a small lake. Couple old leaky boats there and you had to carry a motor in if you wanted one. We would leave in the early AM darkness and get on the lake before sunrise and paddle out from shore in the dark. We then set up with slip bobbers and minnow rigs and would catch huge walleyes, (24"" up to 30"") until the sun came up and then they seemed to quit. Another story about the creek to the lake you found. Water was low when we were there so we actually had to walk the boats through this creek to the lake. The first trip over, we were approaching the lake and started to smell a decomposing animal or fish.. Very strong. As we came around a bend right before the small lake, we found a dead pike in the water. It was the biggets pike we had ever seen and we assumed it had died of natural causes. Alas we did not have the camera and couldn't take pics. We took the pike head and hung it on a tree to dry and I vowed to return for it before we left. I brought it home with us and the lower jaw is still out in the shop. We take it along on our Canada trips for a conversation piece. I might take the guys back now that White Owl is open again because I know that small lake at the end of the creek has some HUGE pike around after 10 years."
2090921,Mike Borger,2013-09-08 14:36:00,1554,"Thanks so much for taking the time to reply! I knew about the other lake as the outfitter mentioned it, but boats/motors aren't set up on it yet. Very interesting though. Frankly even if we were able to fish that lake we didn't have enough time though. It's definitely something to look forward to maybe next year.The small lake I accessed via the creek was pretty interersting. VERY deep, with a couple of basins over 60' deep. Average depth was probably 30 I'll bet. Very unusual for such a small lake and probably why there's such large pike in there!Cheers"
2091977,Mike Borger,2013-09-09 06:01:00,1554,"What you wrote just sunk in LOL!That is truly remarkable. I'm amazed that you would make the trek into that lake so early in the dark! What prompted you to do that the first time?Equally as amazing the size of the walleyes and the way that you caught them.Hardcore is the word that comes to mind, very impressive!With the two adjacent lakes to fish White Owl is a pretty interesting destination. Now I want to go back there more than ever.Here's hoping John Moffat clears the trail into that other lake and puts a boat and motor over there.Once again thanks for chiming in!"
2092129,schandm,2013-09-09 07:26:00,18,"We were pretty crazy to do that early AM walk, but we had a tip from an earlier guest who actually figured out the walleyes on the minnow/slip bobbers. I vividly remember one morning when we came very close to colliding with a moose in the shallows in that bay in the moonlight. Just take big minnows with you. Those walleyes should still be there and be bigger than ever. Good luck and always looking forward to your trip reports."
