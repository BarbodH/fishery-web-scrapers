I fished with them a couple of years ago on Short lake and had a great trip. We are looking at booking through them again but Short Lake is booked for our dates. they did have openings for Mojikit,"

We went twice and did very well on 3 to 4 lb walleye and also numerous big pike. Only thing you have to watch is the wind can make it rough in a hurry. That can happen on any big lake. I named my Lab , Mojikit and call her Moji. We love the lakes on the Ogoki River . Headed up next week to fish and moose hunt. If you go I can give you a little more info. If you go be extremely careful at the outlet as the current is very swift."
