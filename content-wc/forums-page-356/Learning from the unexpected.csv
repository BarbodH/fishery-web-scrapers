Among other things I learned, I had two great examples of the need to be flexible, to expect the unexpected, and to sometimes abandon the old tried and true habits for some out of the box experimenting.1) While looking for jumbo perch one hot, cloudless, windless afternoon my boat partner and I were moving around slowly with small jigs/crawler pieces and slip bobbers w/ a crawler piece. Unbeknownst to me he had tied on a very, very small crawdad lure and began catching 'eyes. I dug around a tackle tray and found small two Diawa CS Shiners that were never in the water (see picture below), tied one on and started to pick up 'eyes, also. In the next two hours we caught 18 or 20 eater 'eyes, keeping just a few. All the walleyes were caught in 4'-5' FOW under a blazing sun!!2) While jigging for lakers and whitefish one afternoon - not on Eagle but and adjoining lake - we found thick pods of fish stacked 40'-60' down on the edge of a drop off that went to 70'. I tried the jig-above-the spoon technique that several folks had told me about. The small floating jighead in the picture was tied 18"" above my jigging spoon. It was not tipped with plastic or anything else. Two of the three lakers I caught were caught on the bare jig, not the spoon!!Moral of the story - - - fish do unexpected things. When the catching slows down while doing what worked before, change it up. Even try something crazy.P.S. As before, Vermilion Bay Lodge proved to be absolutely top notch, the very best in terms of facilities, equipment, hospitality, and service. And, I can attest to the fact that VBay Gord, in addition to being master of the fillet knife and hook remover par excellance, is a pretty good outboard mechanic, too."

I was able to pry two away from his clutches by begging mercilessly on his porch....apparently he didn't see the sign in the cabin to not feed the dogs, or Gord.! Thanks for the eggs and the fishing tips Jay."

Said, well they aren't where they are supposed to be so why not try where they aren't supposed to be. We caught about 5 or 6 walleye. None of any size but a couple eaters."
