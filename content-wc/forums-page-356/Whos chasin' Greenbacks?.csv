2097649,Guest,2013-09-11 17:07:00,0,Since no thread has shown up yet I though Id start one. We've been going up for about 10 years now and I still find the month of September to just drag on forever. Were heading up in the middle of October. Sounds like some are already being caught at the EOM.
2097721,mrwalleye5,2013-09-11 17:56:00,1922,I may be heading up this Sunday just to feel it out. Heading out on Lake Winnipeg. Will be spending most of the last week of September at Pine Falls. Really looking forward to it. I'll report on how I do.

Talked with a guy at the launch who commercially fishes for shiners. He said when the temp dropped a couple of weeks again there were some greenbacks in the system. There are lots of shiners and a good flow in the Winnipeg River but he felt as I do that until the water temp drops to 60, the walleye action will be slow."
2101362,Guest,2013-09-13 13:50:00,0,Thanks for the replies. Were heading up in the middle of Oct so that should give some time for temps to come down some. Can anyone give and update on the EOM ramps? Do they plan on putting in docks ever this year and if not is there a fee for launching now?

I was catching them in front of Hillside beach, on the west side of Elk Island and along the North shore of Traverse Bay. The only thing I caught at the mouth of the river were trophy drums."
