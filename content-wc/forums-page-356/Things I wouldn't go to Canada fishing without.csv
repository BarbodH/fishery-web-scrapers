2086441,Jig Man,2013-09-06 10:04:00,95,If popcorn pops at 350 degrees will it not also pop at 400 or 450 degrees. How do you tell if it is too hot? Do you bring temperatures up slowly and then cut back the heat? Just wondering.
2086545,tooski,2013-09-06 10:27:00,393,"When it pops I throw in the fish. As long as I keep adding fish after removing the initial batch the oil seems to stay perfect. This is with a cast iron skillet, can't speak for those that deep fry..."

2091017,port1042,2013-09-08 15:42:00,509,I always take an electric fry pan. It's just seems a lot easier for frying fish than whatever might be in the kitchen at the lodge cabin and its lot easier to clean.
2091409,Tylumps,2013-09-08 19:01:00,73,"Hi Jig Man. Throw the kernel in before you start heating the oil. When it pops then you know you are at 350. Since I have used the deep fryer so much I can keep the oil pretty regulated by just watching how the oil rolls when the fish is added. To much roll, turn it down a bit."

2083986,Tylumps,2013-09-05 10:11:00,73,Hey just a little tip regarding deep fry thermometer.A popcorn kernel pops at 350 deg. Use it to know when your oil is up to temp.

We haven't been able to find anything that stops him from getting attacked. Did you buy the White Mountain locally or order from their website?"
2072338,btmbncr,2013-08-31 11:41:00,492,I ordered it from their website.
