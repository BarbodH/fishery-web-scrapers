One question I would like answers to is some examples of extraordinary fishing, the once in a decade type I am talking about, and what were the conditions were that led to it. For Example; I recently moved and live on a lake in Virginia. I had lived here a few weeks of hot weather, spending my time moving and fixing things up so hadn't made but a few casts, so the other evening it was cool and rainy so I went out to fish for bass with a torpedo surface lure. Everything was just right and I started catching them, strikes on every cast, mostly smaller fish but one 6 lb 6 oz fish. As it got darker I moved to the inlet of the lake and began catching bass, large ones on every cast in the same spot. They were running up to 6 pounds or so but all were at least 3 pounds there. I had never had topwater action like that and probably landed 20 more bass in 20 minutes. I knew I was ""in the zone"" and doubt I can ever duplicate this, but I will try. I lost some pigs as well and probably had 50-55 bass total. It would be nice to hear some more stories, not just loading the boat in the middle of nowhere, but the ones where it was just ON and never duplicated again in your experience. I have about 4 or 5 of these total in my career covering trout, salmon , pike and walleye, maybe steelhead one day in BC too."

In about 2 hours, two boats (4 guys) boated about 100 walleyes. about 50 of them were 5lbs or bigger. Biggest was 8.5lbs. This was all in a stretch of about 100 yards of shoreline. We were trolling spinners with leaches and crawlers. 12-16 FOW. To cap it all off, a very large Black Bear wondered out of the trees and meandered along the same shoreline. Best two hours of fishing that I have ever seen."

Fishing was only what fishermen only dream about"
2099114,vteye,2013-09-12 09:39:00,812,"I did a unguided float fishing trip with father, brother and 2 sons in SW Alaska. We had a couple days of sight fishing where almost every cast was a fish. We quickly determined we could target individual species of salmon or trout/dolly/char/grayling as varied pool to pool. We literally would skip one pool as full of chum (dog) salmon and then next pool as full of dolly varden only to fish the third pool full of rainbow/graying. We hada couple days mid trip like that."

2100930,tuiflies,2013-09-13 10:08:00,158,"Back in 2006 I was flying a Beaver up at a Echoing Lake Lodge (owned by the Sachigo Lake First Nations Band) 300 miles north of Sioux Lookout. It was just staff up getting the lodge open for the summer and we decided to take the plane over to Yelling Lake to pick up some walleye for dinner. We anchored the plane at the base of the falls and myself and three native guides fished right off the floats. Using only jigs and twister tails we brought home 12 fish in half an hour and more than half were over 26"". We often had massive pike latching on to the walleye as we tried to bring them in but this is the only place I've every had a monster walleye grab the 22"" walleye I was bringing in. At the time, Yelling saw maybe a dozen boats a year.The same year, the Sachigo Lake Reserve was hosting the elections for Grand Chief and they asked the guides to catch some lakers for their feast. So two boats (including myself) went out on Echoing to an area of underwater hills that all run parallel to each other. The tops of the hills are about 40-60' deep and the valleys are about 90-110' and stacked with lakers. We would add bell weights to the split ring on big spoons (with single hooks only) and just drop them down and wind up as fast as you could. There were so many that you could feel your lure hitting fish on the way down and back up! The two boats (four fishermen) kept about 50 fish total mostly 3-5 lbs in an hour. We caught one probably every 2 out of 3 drops. At the time, Echoing saw probably three weeks of guests a year. The lodge had been closed for a number of years and was just starting to operate again."
2102010,Ranger319,2013-09-13 21:30:00,166,"Back bay in Lac Seul, wind picked up and started howling into this bay. Came around a point and into the wind and decided to make a couple casts into the bay. 3 of us in the boat and honestly for the next 45-60 minutes caught a walleye on every single cast. It was cast, reel, hookset, power crank, quick release, repeat. We were throwing traps and burning them back as fast as possible. The feed was ON! My arms/shoulders felt like they were on fire. Slot fish were getting treated like dinks as they lost their luster since we were catching so many so fast. For the last 12 years since that day I have probably 100+ runs in that area and I bet I've caught less than 20 walleyes. Its tradition now to at least make a few casts in memory of that one historic event. Looking back, we should have stayed on that pod of fish just to see how long we could've gone catching them. However, the smallie bite was insane that year and were we fish at home, we don't have the luxary of many smallmouth bass. It was worth leaving as the other two guys in the boat shattered their personal best smallies. Whole day felt like a dream."
