Understand that the $30 RBCP is good for 2 Birthdays not 2 years. Don't do what I did. I wanted to make sure I got my permit renewed for this year so I applied in Jan for the renewal. My birthday is in Feb. My new permit is good from Jan (Date of application)to my Birthday in 2006, 2 birthdays. Or ONE fishing season. Had I waited and renewed on Feb 19th the new permit would be good for 2 birthdays 2006 & 2007 or 2 fishing seasons. Now I have to renew again next year for another $30. Will be sure to hold off until MArch so I get 2 fishing seasons out of it next time. For those of you that don't know what the Remote Border Crossing Permit is it is a permit that you apply to Canadian Immigration for. If you are granted the permit you can cross into canadian waters from Minnesota waters from I believe West of Pigion River to Lake of The Woods in order to fish without checking in at Canadian customs. I.E. remote area lakes. Mac"
