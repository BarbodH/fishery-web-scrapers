A lot of resorts highlight in their web sites that you get FREE use of their fish cleaning house. Am I missing something here? I have been going to resorts for 30 years, and I have never seen a resort without a fish cleaning house, and have never had to pay to use one. Are there resorts out there that charge?"

I've seen locals and campers help themselves to a fish cleaning house, leave the mess there, then go on their way. Not spending a nickel at the resort."
