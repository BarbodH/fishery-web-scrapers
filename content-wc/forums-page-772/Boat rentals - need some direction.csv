Does anyone know of any boat rental shops in northern WI or near Sioux Lookout/Hudson (or anywhere in between), that has basic fishing boats for rent, AND at a decent price? If so, can you post in this thread? We're hoping for a 16ft with a 25HP or better. Thanks!"

Only place I could find was I believe it is called Abrahms Lake Lodge as you come into Sioux Lookout. $100 Canadian a day but not sure if they truly do rentals or he was just being nice to me."
546042,IaDave,2005-03-03 10:24:00,476,Wooglin- Does Judy H. still own the camp? If so I bet she could arrange to have another boat for you. Even if someone else owns the camp I would call them to see if they could find a boat for you.
546043,Guest,2005-03-03 10:32:00,0,"Yes, Judy still runs the camp. I spoke with her regarding this, and I could get a boat through her for $35 per day, and I could rent a motor through Bruce, a person Judy directed me to, in Sioux Lookout. I think it came to $75 per day. I am still thinking about taking my dads boat, just might get his motor looked at... Plus, its nice to haul a boat, a lot of extra storage! Thanks guys!"
