546168,Guest,2005-03-09 10:48:00,0,"Make a few using wire-line harness for times when the toothy critters start tearing up the mono. Also, check your local craft/hobby stores. They usually have a wide assortment of beads in all sizes, colors and shapes. Usually cheaper also and perform the same function."
546170,Guest,2005-03-09 13:02:00,0,"In terms of beads for spinner rigs, anyone using rattle beads? Any opinions on whether they make a difference? I know a guide who claims rattle beads will out-produce solid beads on live-bait rigs 2 to 1."
546178,Guest,2005-03-09 16:56:00,0,i have often wondered what would make them rattle. is the rotation of the blade enough?
545714,Guest,2005-02-11 08:10:00,0,"I usually buy spinners, but might try to make my own this year. For Canada what hooks, blade size and what knot do you guys use to make your live bait spinners?"
545716,Guest,2005-02-11 09:16:00,0,http://www.walleyesinc.com/walleyeinc3/howtotie.html here's a good starting point tutorial. do not use the little metal fold over clevises. get the quick change plastic type. lots less storage issues. there have been lots of good discussions here on this subject. try searching. here's a good thread from 2 years ago.https://www.walleyecentral.com/dc/dcb...=&topic_page=1
545755,jigman 2003,2005-02-14 10:05:00,981,"Tie up some two hook rigs for crawlers and single hook rigs for minnows or leeches. On the two hook rigs use an 8 or 6 on the trailing hook and a 4 or 2 on the front hook. I use size 3,4, and 5 Indiana and Colorado blades in many colors. Usually can't go wrong with some variation of orange, chartreuse, green. Throw in some purples and blues, and you should be set. `For me personally, learning to snell the hooks was the only hard part. Looking back at it now it seems foolish, but it took me awhile to get the hang of it. Now I think I could do it in my sleep :) BTW:I use the folded metal clevises because they are cheap and I like to have the chance to change bead colors as well as blade colors. The inter-change clevises are about $3 for 25. The metal are $1.50 per hundred."
545757,Guest,2005-02-14 10:38:00,0,"Whit, Thanks for the link! That is slick and tells you everything you need to know. Its getting copied as we speak. I do have one quick question. Once made, if you use them some.... how long are they good for. Do you retie every year? I have some that are a couple years old and have been used. Should I retie(sp) them?"
545760,Guest,2005-02-14 13:50:00,0,"i use fireline, so i do not worry about them going bad. i once used mono and found i doubted them the next spring and retied them. i would guess that if they are not exposed to sunlight or extreme temperatures while in storage, they will be fine for a few years. i really am not sure. have fun."
545900,NateW,2005-02-23 11:53:00,96,"We use the metal folded clevis' as well. They function the same and are cheap. As was stated earlier the basic orange, chartruese or lime colors always seem to work best for us. We also stock a plenty of 3"" twister tails in those same colors. Last three trips to Lac Seul we've used twister tails on our spinner rigs instead of live bait and caught as many fish as we did with bait. Plus one plastic bait will last several strikes as opposed to a minnow lasting one or two. Since using the twister tails we started tying our rigs with baitholder hooks. These help hold the plastic on a little better. We tie several spinners in the weeks before we leave--mostly to get rid of some anxious energy. But then we also have an entire spinner-making kit that we haul along and we usually spend a couple evenings tying more in the cabin after dinner. It has become one of those little traditional things that we do on each trip."
545917,Guest,2005-02-24 05:03:00,0,I tie mine with SilverThread and have plenty of bite-offs from the pike. I don't get so irked to lose a metal stirrup clevis from the bite offs. I also run size 2 Gamakatzu (sp) Octopus hooks. That size works well when running plastics like Gulp or Powerbait Grubs.
545926,Guest,2005-02-24 09:58:00,0,"Don't scrimp on hooks either! If you make your own, they may as well be premium! You can get 10 red gamakatsu's for relatively cheap....besides, you don't have to make a thousand of them. Make batches of 20 or so...you'll realize once you make a few and start using them that you may want to alter your design. ie. bigger hooks, different line, longer leaders, different spinners etc. Making hundreds isn't the way to go. I highly recommend metal spinners....copper, silver and gold. About the size just bigger than your thumbnail. I found the big spinners are unnecessary and can be a turnoff to the fishys."
546133,doubleheader,2005-03-08 09:58:00,2652,"This post may be dead, but on the slim chance you check it again, let me pass on some information that may help. I purchase my blades, usually #3 or #4 from a company called Stamina. They have an excellent assortment at a much better price than the big guys, and you can buy on the internet. In Canada I fish stained water. The chartuse works really well combined with white, chartruse, and/or orange beads. I usually use 3-5mm beads. I like the inexpensive plastic beads as they are lighter than glass- usually less snags. I tie with 10lb. Fireline (Canada) or 14lb. flurocarbon (Lake Erie) depending on water clarity. If you're fishing edges shorten your leader and/or add floats to your harnesses. I only use the best hooks, which for me are Gamakatsu. Usually my crawler harness rigs are two hook deals, a #4 with #6 trailer. Bigger on Lake Erie. I do use the replacable plastic clevices- the mini size from Stamina. I also add one very small red bead above the blade which helps minimize weed pick-up. It's fun building your own spinner baits, you can experiment, a bunch and react quickly to hot bites. Be prepared to take apart much of what you initially tie as you will become more proficient after you tie a few. I didn't care for the snelling instructions on the one website you were referred to in an earlier reply. Your best bet is to find someone willing to show you. You can find other instructions on the internet, you can also tie your front hook in a way that it will slide back to your trailer if you get a bite, increasing your chances of a good hookset. I don't use it but I have a buddy that swears by it. Good luck."
