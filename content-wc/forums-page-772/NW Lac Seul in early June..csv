545976,Winnie,2005-02-28 08:41:00,375,Our group has been going to Goose Bay in late May for the last several years. This year we've pushed our trip back a couple weeks to early June. Noramlly we'd always fish in the Sawmill Bay area catching post spawn fish. I'm wondering how our pattern might change by waiting a couple more weeks. I assume most of the fish will have moved further out into the lake by then. Does anyone with any experience fishing NW Lac Seul in early June have any suggestions on locations and patters? Thanks.
545981,Guest,2005-02-28 10:54:00,0,I am by no means an expert but I have fished this area in early June twice. I think alot of what you are talking about will depend on things like ice out and water temps. in the spring. One year we did great in Sawmill and the next year at the same time we did poorly. One year the Wenasaga River was hot and the next very slow. I would run up to McKenzie Bay a couple of times if you have the horsepower. Fish the big and small sandbanks in this area. Andrea at Goose Bay usually knows what is going on as well. On our first trip there she put us on fish until we found a few spots of our own. Good luck.

We have done very good in the river, sawmill and the area around camp. I take my parents with and they can not take that long ride to Mckinzie bay so we stay up by camp most the time. You just have to look for the fish. One year we found a place in the river that held fish all week. Four of us caught over 500 fish from an area of about 5 acres."
546003,skrut,2005-03-01 08:41:00,52,"We go the second week of June. Like the previous posts have said, weather is a big factor along with water levels. Remember this year all fish sanctuaries in Ontario do not open until June 15. Back to your question. At this time of year, we have never fished in more than 8 feet of water, regardless of where we were on the lake. At this time of year the fish are more scattered, but one you locate them, they are plenty of trophy fish to be had."
546016,Guest,2005-03-01 20:21:00,0,Will be headin up for another 2 week stay @ GB for the 11th year. The time is ripe to smoke the walleyes. McKenzie always produces if you can make the trip. Depending on the weather/water level-temps will determine where the fish are. Here this year gone next year.... Don't fret the small stuff... A week or so before you head up come back and see if anyone is willing to provide feedback that is current. The fish are there... just got to locate them! Dynimite works great! Last week in June is a loooooooooooooooong way off!!
546028,Winnie,2005-03-02 12:36:00,375,"You say the ""area around camp."" Where exactly do you mean? I've read other places that at some point in the year Goose Island holds fish. Have you fished there?"
546052,Guest,2005-03-04 07:05:00,0,"It is hard to really tell you where 'around camp' might be. It always changes. Last year we found a spot about 1 mile east of GB camp on the south side of the lake that held fish. We would run out there in the evening and bobber fish. Caught lots of fish, the biggest was 5 lbs. We do a lot of fishing up the river and that is only about 4 miles away or so. Sawmill is another good place in the spring but it is more like 7 or 8 miles away. There are lots of places you can try without making the 18 mile run down to McK bay."
