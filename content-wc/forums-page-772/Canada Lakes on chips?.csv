All I can find is an occasional reference to a ""tiff"" between Canadian chart makers and the Navionics folks. I live in Colorado and don't really need all those detailed maps of the Great Lakes (now, when I retire in a couple of years THAT might change!) but sure would like to get detailed views of places like LaRonge. Any chance of that happening? Jim"

It does not show depths but does accurately show shore lines and islands. This comes on a chip so there is nothing to download to the GPS. I know Magellan also has maps that can be downloaded. The ones I have seen are quite detailed but require you to buy the software to download them. I don't know if either cover the area you are looking for. Rich J
