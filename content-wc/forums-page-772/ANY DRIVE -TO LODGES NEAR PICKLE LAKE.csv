546243,Guest,2005-03-12 21:01:00,0,Thanks Len. Sounds like you are an adventuresome sort. Maybe some year I will give it a try. Good luck this summer. I will be going back to Lac Seul. I really love NW Ontario. It is an incredibly special place. Skinny
546166,Guest,2005-03-09 09:54:00,0,"I AM LOOKING FOR A DRIVE -TO OR BOAT -IN LODGE NEAR THE PICKLE LAKE AREA....NEVER BEEN THAT DIRECTION AND CURIOUS WHAT PICKLE LAKE MAY HAVE TO OFFER. THANKS, BOB"
546167,Fred_G,2005-03-09 10:31:00,908,"There are two drive to lodges in this area, Camp Lake St. Joseph & The Old Post & Village. Camp Lake St. Joseph is a bit more primitive, ie: community showers & restrooms, etc. The Old Post is, IMHO, close to a Five Diamond hotel. I've been going the The Old Post for 8 years and like it very well. Another difference, if you plan to use a camp boat, is The Old Post uses 30 hp motors, compared to 15 hp motors at Camp Lake St. Joe. Lake St. Joe is a big lake, so the extra hp makes it a little easier to get out further. Here's the websites for both:http://www.lakestjoseph.com/index.htmhttp://www.oldpost.com/"
546171,Guest,2005-03-09 13:40:00,0,"Hello Bob Before you decide to go to the Pickle Lake area I would advise that you check to see the condition of your arm and shoulder etc. My first trip there I pulled in so many fish--eyes--- that it taxed every movable joint I have. We go north of town about 100 miles to a drive in lake but we were the only ones there. We tent or sometimes take the camper, depending if we stay at the campground or go up the river. If we go up the river we tent to save the roundtrip each day. len clare michigan"
546174,Guest,2005-03-09 14:27:00,0,ANY LODGES WHERE YOU GO LENRAYS??? SOUNDS GOOD AND I HAVE PRETTY STOUT SHOULDERS.LOL
546175,Guest,2005-03-09 14:49:00,0,"Hi Bob My people came to Mi. from Kendallville area in 1890's and my wifes people came from Columbia City area in 1918. I don't go to where there are lodges. Have been accused of being cheap ,but that is not the case. I just plain like the piece and quiet of having water pretty much to myself. Do most of my fishing north of Terrace Bay north of Lake Superior. We travel 80-100 miles on gravel then go a few miles with the quads and go from river to lake to river etc. We have drug 5 boats 12-14 into those lakes and leave them there. We have never seen others or signs of others being there. This lake north of Pickle Lake is Horseshoe Lake up the Pipestone River. This is the only lake I go to where I can drive to. It is 1100-1200 miles one way but worth the trip and if I were to see others it would be fine with me. My wife goes on some trips and she can camp out etc. I just have never had any desire to go to a lodge. Frying my own fish under the stars is what works for me. I never fish here in Michigan don't even buy a lic. I guess fishing is just a little part of the trip for me. If ya go to the Pipestone bring a few extra props. I took an older guy 70 plus in 02 he had caught one eye in his life. We kept track for one hour out of the day and not using a net and not trying to get the fish in the boat hoping they would come off after being out of the water we still had boated 52 and probably hooked 80+"
546177,IaDave,2005-03-09 16:05:00,476,North of St. Joseph there are no lodges only the ones for fly-ins. I have gotten to know the owner of one outfitter and he let us stay in one of his cabins at the main base for $25.00 a night and we took our own boat and fished some the lakes north of Pickle Lake like Lenrays said. It was a lot of driving back and forth though. Camping is the way to go up there.
546191,Guest,2005-03-10 08:58:00,0,Lenrays: I posted a response to you in another post and I guess you didn't see it. I've been going to the Pickle Lake area since 1976 and would like to swap stories with you.
546194,Guest,2005-03-10 10:38:00,0,Hello Wetvette I really would enjoy hearing from you. Do you have a vette. I have a low miles red 85 that I get out in the summer. You truly are a veteran of the Pickle Lake area. I am sorry that I didn't see your other post. Getting cabin fever here in Michigan and really enjoy hearing stories of that region and what other explorers have to say about it.[email protected]
546237,Guest,2005-03-12 14:21:00,0,"Lenrays, Is there a boat ramp on the pipestone river? If so, how big of a boat do you run up the river to get into horseshoe Lake? Are there any restrictions on camping in that area? I doubt if I will ever go camping like that in Ontario, my companions would probably not be interested. Sure sounds like fun though. Skinny"
546241,Guest,2005-03-12 17:34:00,0,Hello Skinny Where I put the boat in there is old chain link fence laid on the ground back the boat in over that. I have an 18 footer with a 70 HP Johnson. Where you put the boat in is Indian property and you get a permit at the township office in town for 3.00 per night--if you camp there. Only thing there is an outhouse. If you camp up in the lake it is Crown land and it costs 10.00 per night. Probably would want a 4X4 to unload da boat. There are 2 ploaces to put your boat in--not sure what the other one is like. They are about a quarter mile apart. The fella that put me on this lake fished it with square back canoes. Lots of bear and moose. I asked the locals in Pickle if they fish here. They said we have ST.Joseph in town why would we drive another 100 miles--that is for you tourist. Glad to answer any questions if I can. len in michigan
