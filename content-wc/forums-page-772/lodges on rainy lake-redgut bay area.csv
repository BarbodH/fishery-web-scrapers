546038,Guest,2005-03-03 08:51:00,0,"Rainy Lake is almost like 3 lakes combined. There is the north arm, south arm and Red Gut Bay. Each are different. The south arm is bigger water and more open. It is the best area for walleye numbers. Red Gut is a good mixture of fish. Walleye, northern, bass, and crappie. The north arm is the best area for smallmouth and northern. The walleye population is getting much better in the north arm. You don't catch the numbers you do in the south arm or Red Gut, but the fish are much larger on average. The smelt population in the north arm is the biggest, which in tern, means girth to the fish. The Walleye probably average about 21"" and the northern average around 32"". Smallies average around 16 -17"" with lots over 18"". A 171/2"" smallie in the fall weighs close to 4 lb's. Thanks to the smelt."
545745,Guest,2005-02-13 12:40:00,0,i'm looking for suggestions of where to stay in the redgut area of rainy in late july.there will be several adults and a couple kids.
545746,Guest,2005-02-13 13:18:00,0,Try the Fisheries Resort. I'm heading up there in June. Prices are reasonable.
545804,Guest,2005-02-17 14:04:00,0,"We have been staying at Coppen's for 15 years. Reasonable price, decent cabins, and a great location. Right where redgut dumps into swell bay. The owners are good people that make you want to come back."
545832,Bx2(IL),2005-02-19 18:29:00,62,I second the motion on The Fisheries Resort. I'll be up there in August. Sent my deposit in today. www.thefisheries.com Check it out.
545834,Guest,2005-02-19 19:32:00,0,I've stayed at Coppens also and if you check their website www.coppensresort.com you will notice that their 3 bedroom (air conditioned) cabin is less expensive (both resorts price lists are in canadian dollars). Very close to each other and the people and fishing at Coppens were great. To be fair I haven't stayed at the Fisheries but I don't have a reason to look elsewhere if I want to fish Rainy. Good luck and have a good trip!!
545851,Guest,2005-02-21 10:47:00,0,how far is rainy lake from fort francis? are there as many rocks in this lake as the others in canada? thanks alan
545852,Gary_IA,2005-02-21 12:21:00,144,"Rainy Lake is huge and its level is controlled and varies. You can get maps of the segment(s)that interest you. Yes there are rocks and because of the varying water level different rocks come into play at different levels. A safe route at a high level may not be safe at a lower level. You can definitely lose a lower unit due to carelessness or bad luck. Research the maps, ask the resort operators, etc. and proceed cautiously-that doesn't slow trolling speed everywhere but there are times when slow is the way to go."

545987,Ia Walihntr,2005-02-28 19:16:00,320,"Rudy, I will stop at the store and bring the brochures. Have 3 in the North Arm, 3 in Red Gut Bay and three others that I'm not exactly sure of the location but will bring them over for you to copy. Marv"
