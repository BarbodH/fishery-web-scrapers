545953,AB,2005-02-25 23:24:00,61,"30 Stranded Anglers Rescued About 30 ice fishermen have been plucked from a huge chunk of ice that broke away and drifted four miles into Lake Erie. There were no injuries. The Coast Guard used boats and helicopters to rescue the anglers, who had to leave their vehicles behind. One person fell into the water and was rescued by other fishermen. The ten-mile-wide ice floe broke away about ten miles east of Toledo. One of the stranded fisherman used a cell phone to call the Coast Guard for help. Ice fishing is popular on the lake and draws anglers from all over the Midwest, but shifting winds and warming temperatures have caused the ice to crack on numerous occasions.
