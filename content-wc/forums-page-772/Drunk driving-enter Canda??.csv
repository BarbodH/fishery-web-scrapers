545978,jigman 2003,2005-02-28 10:27:00,981,"One more thing I forgot to mention. I too was disappointed at first about the potato thing, but have found that frozen potatoes are easier and less time consuming to cook. I am pretty sure the Canadians sell them there too. Probably get a 50lb. bag for $6.00."

You cannot even bring a pizza into the states because the peperoni has beef in it. Don't complain about it. It happens at them all. There was a fungus found on some US potatoes. They stop them from coming in. It is a disease thing. It is not customs, it is Agriculture Canada that tells customs to stop them. Try bringing a mandarin orange back into your country and see what happens."
545980,Guest,2005-02-28 10:42:00,0,"If you get a convictions in Canada and try to cross the border into the US they will stop you. I have lived on the border all my life. It is the same either way. There is the waiver system on the US side as well. If you get a conviction in canada and you want to go to the states you have to get a waiver. The fee is around $200.00 US as well and takes a long time to get. I guess they are just trying to get our good earned canadian dollars also.lol The problem is, and I do not see it as a problem, is that a DUI is a felony in Canada. A FELONY. It does not matter if it is not in the state that you come from. It is in Canada. If it is on your record they will find it.They are checking more ID's at the border every year. Why? Because of the US Government pressure to do so. One minute people are complaining Canada is to soft at the border and ""letting all the terorists in"" and the next they are complaining that we are checking everyone. You cannot have it both ways. Custom's and Immigration has now been combined. This should help with line up's at the immigration counter. Before you may only have had one immigration officer working at Fort Frances, now anyone can check you through. Do not lie to them. And be prepared."
545982,Guest,2005-02-28 14:48:00,0,"I was joking a little. I know the whole potato thing is an agriculture thing. We don't buy their beef, they don't allow our potatoes. When we start buying beef again, we will suddenly be allowed to bring idaho spuds over the border. Buying potatoes over the border does not affect the whole trip. Just a very minor bump in the road. Remember, I was pointing out that invasive searches take place when crossing any border. If you do not want to be searched, or abide by the rules of a foreign land, then stay in the states. A few years ago I was coming back from Italy and had to spend a night in Amsterdam because I took a voluntary bump on my connecting flight on KLM airlines. The red-light district is something else!!! You think crossing the border into Canada is bad...try taking a lay-over in Amsterdam and try getting back into the US. They searched and drug-dog sniffed everything and took forever. I thought I was going to have to bend over and cough."
545983,Guest,2005-02-28 15:46:00,0,"We stayed at a Flyin resort with a crew last summer and ran out of Spuds. The resort owner kept a whole stash of spuds for his American guests. We laughed like crazy at the stories the Americans told about having their spuds taken away. Even they were laughing at the ""criminal act"" of importing spuds. There was no charge for the spuds by the way."
545986,Backwater Eddy,2005-02-28 18:16:00,3871,"When is the last time you seen a member of the Tater Talaban with a backpack full of spuds detonate himself in a crowd in Canada? The instances of Potato Flake overdose are way down in Canada now. So...the spud ban must be working. I hear they can now spot a Tater Tot in a backpack from space. :D Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""ED on the RED"" ><,sUMo,>"
546111,Guest,2005-03-07 09:24:00,0,I called customs at int'l falls and talked to an agent... Was told that a dui conviction 13 yrs ago is not going to be a problem when crossing the border.... Just thought i'd add a little follow up on my previous post
546115,Guest,2005-03-07 13:34:00,0,"I was the one who got this started in the first place. As of now our plan is to get passports. That way you do not even have to give them a drivers license. That is what one of the resort owners told me. nevertheless if someone has a phone number to call customs or a helpful number, that would be greatly appreciated. thanks"
546117,Drift Sock,2005-03-07 16:04:00,302,"<<Where do you think we got the science to develop the A-bomb?>> Well, we didn't get it from the Nazis we let stay in the U.S. after the war. We developed the A-bomb using American, British, and European refugee scientists (none of whom were Nazis - quite the opposite) DURING the war. Many German rocket scientists came here after the war...perhaps that is what you were thiking of. DS"
546118,Drift Sock,2005-03-07 16:07:00,302,"Just having a passport isn't going to matter. Canandian immigation / customs can check you anyway for your criminal background. They will just use your passport for your ID and not your driver's license. They will still enforce their law against anyone who has a DUI on his record. Take the advice of the first poster, go the Canada customs website, read the regulation for yourself, and FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AND THE LAW. Then you can get in without worrying. DS"
545940,Guest,2005-02-25 09:34:00,0,"Don't be foolish...if you are worried and you still have plenty of time, call the Canada Customs office that you are going to cross at and ask them what you should do. I think that everything says under ten years, but if you had been put on probation for a few years, then it might show less that ten years on their computer. If all you have is a DUI 13 years ago, you should get in no problem you just might have to be a little proactive and fill out some forms now."
545943,Guest,2005-02-25 11:20:00,0,"cool, thanks for the info...it's much appreciated."
545947,Guest,2005-02-25 14:43:00,0,I would not lose any sleep over it. I truely would guess that any stories you hear about someone not getting in with one dui has to do with a larger record then they are admitting to or not being respectful at the border.
545956,Guest,2005-02-26 10:14:00,0,"They are strict but if you are honest and call and fill out paperwork ahead of time, you are fine. If the conviction on his record was a felony stealing of hubcaps, he could have got in if he had been a little proactive. He actually could easily get that expunged off his records in the US and never have to worry about it again."
545966,Guest,2005-02-26 16:58:00,0,"Ain't life a ####? Those Canadiens and there prickly laws on drinking, et al. Anybody who has a sheet for anythin--A-N-Y-T-H-I-N---should do the paperwork before they pile in the truck with their buddies and just to get gigged at the border. I think it is delusional and incredibly stupid to think that, if you look like Wally Cleaver and take your sunglasses off and say ""sir"" repeatedly they'll be waiving you through. Do the paperwork, pay the fine (200 Canadien) and you'll get absolution in the form of a letter saying you are swell and allowed in. I know, I got rejected one year for an 18 year-old DUI and it hurt--and really sucked for my buddy who was in my car. So don't take chances and don't think they'll not be able to access your records. Your name and DOB is all they need to get in to the US Criminal Records database that US Customs maintains and then...voila'... Dude...that bust for smoking a joint at the Foghat concert in '77 is right back in your face... Catch fish"
545969,Backwater Eddy,2005-02-27 07:01:00,3871,"I had a DUI conviction over 14 years ago. When asked about if I had any at the border I said yes and when. They did a check, and from that point on I have had no complications on the matter. The best bet is being up-front with them. Because if you are not, and they catch it, you will be treated accordingly and it many be a long time if ever when you see Canada again. Be respectful and work within there system and all will go fine. Just an FYI. There is a very good chance that in 4 years or less a DUI (Driving under the influence) here in the USA will be prosecuted as a felony conviction. There is a very strong lobby for this now. I personally expect it to go through when/if it is introduced into law. Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""ED on the RED"" ><,sUMo,>"
545970,Guest,2005-02-27 07:43:00,0,"They will not prosecute first offenses of DUI as a felony. Not gonna happen. They have lowered the limit to .08 in many states, and have made many accidents situations where the police can do non-consent blood draws, so the politicians can run for re-election claiming to be tough on DUI, but first offense felonies are not gonna happen. Secondly, Judges generally do not give a conviction on your first DUI, they give you conditional discharge, or court supervision, so you can after a few years get the DUI expunged."
545972,Guest,2005-02-27 15:21:00,0,Interesting reading. Let me get this right...You good ole boys are visiting a Foreign country with a different set of laws and you want to test the system. I say go for it. Best bet is to lie to the Officer and everyone in the vehicle stick to the story. That way you can all go to jail and have the vehicle impounded and sold. The lack of respect by some posters for a sovereign country and a neighbour is terrible. Follow the lead of some of the posters...prepare now and follow the rules. Good Luck

545977,jigman 2003,2005-02-28 10:24:00,981,"Wow, I sense a little hostility here. First of all, if you are not going to Canada why are you monitoring a ""Canada"" board? Second, Canada isn't the only country to allow Nazis to stay here after the war. Where do you think we got the science to develop the A-bomb? Why do the Canadians have to do things the way we want? If our fishing was good and they came here they would have to follow our rules. Why is it any different for us? American arrogance is why most of the rest of the world hates us."
545359,rebelrn2001,2005-01-24 22:16:00,1563,Be sure you aren't taking HIS vehicle. They look at (and take a picture of) every license plate that goes throught there.
545361,Guest,2005-01-25 06:56:00,0,Had a DUI in 2003 and have been to Canada 3 times since and drove my truck twice they didn't ask and I didn't bring it up either. I got a deferred judgement so no criminal record. I do have a question if anyone KNOWS when they ask for ID or request your drivers license do they check the DMV for your state or the national data bank on criminal confictions??
545368,Guest,2005-01-25 10:11:00,0,Hi. I guess what we need here is someone from the canadian customs from fort francis to let us know what we can get away with and how slack amd imcompetant they are regarding criminals and drunk drivers getting into their country on probably a daily basis.
545369,Reels,2005-01-25 10:18:00,2876,Maybe Perchjerker can set up a chat night with one... <{{}}><
545370,Guest,2005-01-25 12:15:00,0,Do you think they agree to answer those questions?
545381,tly,2005-01-25 18:51:00,1900,"Yes, a guideline would be appropriate. But are they incompetent? How can you judge? Whatis your agenda, are you suggesting they should improve the inspection or reduce it? Both our posts are a waste. TLY"
545391,Guest,2005-01-26 12:29:00,0,"Bor is correct. We got through with a first-time offender for $200C/$135A. But that was only the first time. We got turned around on subsequent trip because he didn't take care of the paperwork he was issued the first time, along with the threat of ""warrant for his arrest"" if he tried to sneak in. I believe the correct thing to do is obtain a ""Waiver of Exemption"" from the Canadian Consulate in the U.S. ahead of time. This, we were told, takes quite some time, so start early. The Customs Officer told us that a fee is required, and that the fee may not be returned even if the request is denied. Also, always tell the truth. If they take your friend into the back room, tell him to tell the truth especially. I don't know where the info comes from that they have, but our guy said she had all the pertinents on his DUI right there on her screen. In addition, be sure you have decided upon and agree to what you all will do if the worst happens. Drop him and continue on, telling him you will pick him up on the way back, or meet him back home? All of you turn around? If you decide to all turn around, you might want to have some fishing spots in mind in the states. We hadn't made any contingency plans, so it was a poor trip overall. And, make sure your signatures on your driver's licenses are completely legible. She had a problem with one of our guys for that, too, but since we decided that if one got turned back, we all would turn back, it didn't turn into a problem for us. Good luck, but don't expect to get away with anything."

545937,Guest,2005-02-24 16:26:00,0,This is scaring the heck out of me. My trip is the last week of May ...so I have some time to get things in order. Plus my father in law is a cop so I'm going to have him run my license to see if anything comes up. think a dui from 13 yrs ago will be a problem? What if I have a buddy drive my truck while in canada?
545939,Guest,2005-02-25 07:24:00,0,"13 years seems to be far enough out - BUT, don't give them anything more than they ask for. When arriving at the border, take your hat off, take your sunglasses off, give them your license if they ask for it, be polite, answer their questions and you'll be on your way in no time. If you give them a reason to do a background check on you, it may cause a problem."
545319,Guest,2005-01-23 21:00:00,0,"We are coming to Canada from Wisconsin with 8 guys for fishing in May. One of our members got a drunk driving citation about 3-4 years ago. His first and only one and no one else in our group has one.We know that he cannot drive in Canada, but will they let him in. The last thing we want is to drive 500 miles and get turned back at the border and drive 500 miles back. Can he get some type of permit from Canada or locally that will eliminate any chance for problems at the border. Any help will be very much appreciated as this is goingto be my first Canadian trip.

545321,Guest,2005-01-23 23:41:00,0,Hi. its a good thing he mentioned it. I think with a group of guys to discover this at the border I would have to say sorry charlie we are going north and you can figure out how to get yourself home. No point in ruining everyones vacation because of one drunk driver. This country is still not hard enough on its drunk drivers.

545341,Guest,2005-01-24 07:23:00,0,"You can contact Canadian customs, and pay a fee and they will let him in. The DUI might have to be from 5 or more years ago to do it though. Start working on it now, and you might be able to get him in. It just might cost a few hundred in fees."
545346,Guest,2005-01-24 12:15:00,0,"Show up at the border, hat and glasses off, have reservations and paperwork to show it, speak respectfully, no smart alleck comments from the back, and be honest. Very high percentage chance you will go right through. If they ask for everones ID, ask to speak with the immigration official on duty. Explain to him the situation, that you have reservations and are only going there, be respectful and courtious, and they will let you in with a $200 fee if it has been less than 5 years. If it is 5 or over, you can handle the paperwork in advance. Make sure the person isnt lying about there record, if there is more than one or any type of firearms or violence convictions, you will get turned around. One DUI, and you will drive through, maybe 200 bucks lighter in the wallet."
545352,fishmaster,2005-01-24 16:43:00,209,Like mnfishingfan said take off the glasses and hats and be nice and if they ask for ID's they rpobably will not look them up if everyone's looks good and will let you pass with out question. As long as he is not driving don't worry about it so much but like one of the others said make sure you have a back-up plan for him in case they turn him back.
