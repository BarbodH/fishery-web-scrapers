We stay for 7 days all American plan for around $925-$950 US. This includes a day on the lake with the guide, boat ( nice 17 foot with Livewell, Depthfinder, front troll and electric start Honda 4 stroke 40-50 HP) All Gas and Bait and the lodge has Satellite TV in each room so that you can wind down before you go to sleep. Food is awesome and the owners are great people. Great Walleye, Smallmouth Bass, Lake Trout and Pike. www.whitepinelodge.ca Email me at [email protected] if you have any questions"

Great people with Housekeeping cabins, No disrespect intended but there are only T.Vs and phones in the main lodge cuz I prefer not to have them when my kids are with, I couldn't get them to do anything else."
545862,Guest,2005-02-22 07:05:00,0,"Sorry; The trip with a family of five, us bringing our own boat and food runs right at a thousand for the week, if your interested in fishing it just can't get any cheaper..Hope you have fun wherever you go!!!! Eric"
545863,Guest,2005-02-22 07:30:00,0,"Depends on what you are looking to do. Do you want a boat/gas provided, do you want a cabin, do you want meals provided...etc.? I personally pull my own boat, camp, clean my own fish, cook and bring my own food, and I do this all on about $400....and this is including poker money. If you are a do-it-yourselfer, checkout:www.countrycamping.net for a great place to stay and great fishing near Lac Seul. >Lets hear from the WC gang about the best fishing Resort >under $1000."

545865,Guest,2005-02-22 09:26:00,0,"This is true. Last year I burned a guy out of all his gas money. He had to borrow cash from his driving partner for gas until they got home... >Wooglin, > >You guys need to raise your Poker Stakes."

We've been going there for 12 years now and the fishing has consistent and the lakes are remote and beautiful. The $40.00 a night price tag is probably the easiest thing to swallow. Thanks Dave"
