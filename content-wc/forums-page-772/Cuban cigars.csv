545963,Guest,2005-02-26 15:04:00,0,"I would highly recommended not bringing or trying to bring them over. Last year a friend bought 5 or 6 cigars. I had smoked a few of them during the week. On our trip back they asked if I had any cigars. I told them I think there are 2 or 3 in my boat. Wasn't even sure if they were cuban? They wanted a specific number, it's either 2 or 3. Since I had no idea I had to tear the camp supplies apart in the boat and of course only 2. Where's the 3rd? Got hassled over it quite abit. Signed a release and watched them destroy them and I was on my way. Could of just said ""no"" when asked and been on my way, but have no reason to lie about it I didn't know they were Cuban seed cigars."
545964,Guest,2005-02-26 15:52:00,0,I had one left over and in the glovebox. she asked and I showed it to her. She kinda joked about it and said I was lucky she didn't smoke and gave it back.

If you think Cuban Cigars are THAT much better than the other stuff than go ahead and try it, but be willing to face the consequences you just might regret trying!"
545989,Guest,2005-02-28 20:22:00,0,"As a matter of fact, they are much better, but not good enough to take the risk of being caught with something illegal. I only smoke cigars when I am in Canada. I don't believe I implyed that I tried to smuggle."
546025,Guest,2005-03-02 07:22:00,0,"There are a lot of very good cigars made in the Dominican Republic and Honduras that are perfectly legal to bring into Canada. IMHO that the Cuban cigars are over priced at $8 each or whatever they are. Most of the tobacco grown in the D.R. and Honduras are from original seed of Cuban origin. I can legally bring 50 cigars into Cananda. I purchase them over the internet at www.jrcigars.com. They sell five-packs of a variety of brands that are valued at a box price. The favorite amongst our group are El Rey Del Mundo Rectangulares. These particular cigars are $10 per 5-pack with $2 shipping charge. These cigars are priced at about $5 at local cigar shops. But if you really want to burn $8 bucks a cigar, have at it..."
