You have to boat in a long way, over 30 miles. You don't need guides, you can find them easily yourself. We take our own boats."
545613,Guest,2005-02-07 05:56:00,0,"We had a similar experience in 96, never did get to meet Ken but had a great discussion with him over the radio about our bill. We booked a standard cabin and after one day they moved us into VIP. We told them that is not what we wanted but they said they needed the larger standard cabin. We disagreed about being charged the higher rate. We did get it resolved but we now rent a houseboat and go to the same area. Lot's of posts with good things to say so we may have just had a bad week also. The fishing is great!"
546026,Guest,2005-03-02 08:22:00,0,"Michael, I am about to book here for a week in August. My friends and I had a few questions that they gave vague answers to on the phone. Their boat in package does not include fuel. How much do they charge, and about how much gas do you use for the week? I got screwed a few years ago when a camp charged us over $8 per gallon. Do we get a boat on the first day we get there, or do we have to wait for the next morning. Are the boats and seats they provide nice, or a little run down?"
546031,eyeman_1,2005-03-02 18:15:00,690,"When I was there the gas prices rocked our socks off, and they were imperial gallons/liters not us gallons. Boats were available when we arrived...w/20hp mercs...pull start. Boat were in decent shape and everything worked ok..seat were just clamp on swivel seats nothing fancy. That was in 95'..."
546074,WIPP,2005-03-03 15:09:00,75,"We use our own boats and bring our own gas. Two years ago I had to buy a tankful and it was $5 to $6 per gallon. I have never rented one of their own boats, though I assumed that the gas was included on those (I may be wrong). I know you pay substantially more if you boat in with them and rent one of their boats. The boats were 16 foot Lunds with 25 hp Mercs. When you use your own boat they will still haul your gear (except the gas)."

546066,Guest,2005-03-05 14:19:00,0,"looking at their web site, it appears that there a lot of things they don't provide as part of the package price. these include bedding, life jackets, bait and gasoline. add to that the fact that their rates are nearly double the lodges in the ear falls area and i think i'll stick with the ear falls. isolation is nice, but it has it's downside. got that supply and demand thing going on down there."

544692,Guest,2004-12-19 23:51:00,0,thats a big problem these places want big groups and have very little accomodations for husband and wife. or not enough anyway.
545062,Guest,2005-01-14 16:52:00,0,"I have no trouble believing that all the small cabins are booked. This is a top notch facility with a good reputation and is the only camp on the northeast part of the lake. So take it as gospel. Just get two more guys to go with you and you got it made. Otherwise check out Silver Water Wheel Lodge. This place lands more big fish per person than any camp in northwestern Ontario. They are not cheap, but how can you put a price on world class. Good luck."

545144,Guest,2005-01-17 07:57:00,0,"I called them in September about booking with them next year. They could not accomdate my group of 6-8 in June, July or the first of August. They had end of May, and late August available. He said that many people put money down for the next year when they are leaving. They must be doing something right to book up that fast."
545160,Thumper,2005-01-17 17:25:00,133,"I was talking to one of their guys, a young pup, this weekend in St. Paul. Their camp is on the North East corner of the lake, I think the area is called McKenzie Narrows. It where the 3 rivers enter the lake (Root, English and Vermillion, I think). They leave from Deception Bay, a lake a few miles North of Sioux Lookout. If you bring your own boat, then you follow one of their boats from the launch back to the camp, about 30 miles including through some ""fast water"" that's supposed to be rather interesting. I looked at their rates, and it wasn't cheap for a boat in. About $1K a week. I'd expect a fly-in for about that price. But, as Bor said ""they must be doing something right""! An alternative might be to do a fly-in with Pickerel Arm Camp. They have a cabin on Tuktegweik Bay on Lac Seul, near the narrows where Ojibway is located. Their rates are about $860us for a week on Lac Seul. Now, I can't vouch for Pickerel Arm yet, but I booked a different lake with them for May. So, I guess you could say I'm eating my own dog food. :-)"
545379,Guest,2005-01-25 18:23:00,0,"This coming July will be our 10th year at Ojibway, and to answer everyones questions they are doing something right. Ken and Brenda(the owners) are both exceptional people. Here is the quick run down on Ojibway... On your first day you meet Ken and his staff at Deception Landing about 10 miles from Sioux Lookout. You have the choice of bringing your own boat or using boats from their fleet. If you bring your own boat I believe you need to have at least a 70hp outboard (if you don't have at least 70hp it would take you forever to get there). Ojibways fleet is composed of 16 ft. lunds, 25 hp merc, and two swivel seats. The boats go 20 to 25 mph according to my gps. If you do bring your own boat be sure to sit down with Ken and have him show you where to steer clear of. There are many areas in the middle of the lake where rocks are just under the surface. At Deception Landing you will either launch your boat and follow Ken and his staff to camp (about an hour ride) or you will load up Ken's boats with your gear and your party. They have a barge they use for transporting fuel and gear to the camp so don't be afraid to bring that extra rod tube. We normally bring a large Uhaul packed 4 ft high front to back. If you plan on bringing a lot of stuff make sure he brings the barge. After the hour ride, relax!! Wonder up to your cabin and get your stuff ready as the camp staff brings it all to your door step. Then head down to the dock or fish around camp for the remainer of the day (the dock consistantly produce quantity and quality). As for the fishing 100+ fishing per boat is common. Most of the fish will be in the 2-4 pound range, but 8-12lb walleyes are not uncommon. Expect to catch a few pike while walleye fishing (our biggest is 44""). This is a great location for muskie fishing too, I am not much of a muskie fisherman but many people come to the lodge for muskie alone. To answer the questions about camp bookings... They always have a one or two 2 person parties in camp. I have even seen a one person party a few times. I believe Ken said that 75% of his clients are repeats. I hope this helps. If you have any other questions regarding the lodge I would be happy to help out."
545380,tly,2005-01-25 18:45:00,1900,"All of the above posts are accurate. This has become a well organized operation, having improved over a couple years of not so great service many years ago. We have been dealing with Ken since early 1980's and have had absoutely no problems in all this time. The post on catching from the dock is right on. Have some good pics of folks catches from the dock even as float plane is taking off. We, of course, gotta motor around but is nothing to catch 100 in a day. Yes, they fill up fast. I have wondered why the sports shows are attended other than a good write off to get to 'warmer' climates. We will be there again this spring, and as many as we can do. TLY"
545435,eyeman_1,2005-01-30 06:22:00,690,"I was up to Ojibway back in the mid 90's...right after they're big write up in the In-Fisherman mag. I will say this; the fishing was excellent for eyes, pike and muskie. But, I was less than impressed with their staff, the cabin, Ken and Brenda. I may have caught them on a bad week but I would hesitate to go back unless I knew things had changed. Our trip got off to an interesting start as Fishing Hotspots had a group coming into camp that week as well. In order to not have to deal with us Ken flew us in.(Great!) Initally we were in a cabin with no facilities... not what we were told would be. Then we were put in to the cabin farthest away from anyone...not a bad thing except the mice had over run the place. Front door didn't come to the floor and we had the little fellows running across counters, putting holes in bags of chips etc.. we had to keep our duffels closed at all times, food stowed in containers. One fellow had a mouse run across his face in the night...made for an interesting evening. The staff was less than...helpful. There was a big parachute used for a tent when we were there and the boys were sometimes difficult to find ... they were in the tent sending smoke signals if you will. The camp manager had gone into town for a few days so all bets were off. One staff member we located to fill our tanks came over and while he was filling it spilled a qt. of two stroke oil into my muskie box. That was just great. His eyes looked like a road map too. We also had a heck of a time getting resupplyed with bait... we should have brought more in but were told that getting more wouldn't be an issue when we left. They forgot us in the AM ... that occurs. The guy in camp said that since they forgot, that it would be on them so great.. we get back to the outfitter at the end of our trip and Brenda goes ballistic. I've never heard a woman curse quite the same. Said that wasn't true... then she decided to take it out of the guys pay..or so she told us. So...if it's gotten better that would be wonderful. It's a tremendous location, unbelieveable fishing, and from what I've been told all rebuilt. Our group just may have had a bad week there. Other people I know have had good experiences... ours was not."
545439,Guest,2005-01-30 12:02:00,0,isn't this the place with the pack of camp dogs that keep the fishermen up all night?
544495,Guest,2004-12-11 06:15:00,0,I am thinking about going to Lac Suel this summer and staying with Ojibway Outfitters. The idea of 40 mile boat ride is interesting!! How is the fishing? Camp? Owners? Anything else? Thanks
544501,Guest,2004-12-11 15:56:00,0,We have been there three times. Have done very well fishing each time and the Camp is clean and the service is excellent. The thing that I like best about it is it is on Lac Seul but not in a big water area. Lots of great structure and top notch fishing close to camp.
544511,Mike Kansas,2004-12-13 07:18:00,1463,We have been looking at this Camp for several years. All of the referencs we have got have been excellent and the fishing reports have been very good. my wife and I and another couple are going to give it a shot next July.
