Camp is fairly basic, couple cabins have inside johns, others you use the outhouse. Very clean, good 15hps motors and clean boats. Nothing fancy though. Simply a good clean place with friendly service, and low cost structure. Most customers are repeats. It connects to several rivers and two other lakes, so usually you can fish even if there is a heavy wind. I have not been there last two years, but only because I have been taking my own boat to Canada. Call Keith, he will steer you right. (I have no connections of any sort, just been there a lot and like it) Good luck. I'm actually trying to find some time to go back up there, except the lure of your own boat and camper to sleep in is too big!"
