546030,Guest,2005-03-02 18:05:00,0,Here is a stupid question but what is wrong with bringing a GPS to mark the spots the guide takes you to? You are paying for his help. I would imagine the guide should know lots of areas on a big body of water like Lac Seul. I don't mean to start an arguement but am curious why some think its not appropriate to mark spots on a GPS that a guide takes you to. Is it any better if the client has a good memory and can find their way to those spots by memory as opposed to a GPS? Just wondering.
546032,Guest,2005-03-02 19:07:00,0,"There was a huge argument about guides and GPS a few months ago. If you want to take a GPS, check with the guide first when booking. If that guide says you cannot take one, take another guide that will if a GPS is important to you. I agree that a guide has the right to tell me no GPS, just as I have the right to pick a different guide."
546033,Rich J,2005-03-02 20:50:00,65,"Nope, superior technique all the way. I have the depth finder and trolling motor up front and keep the front of the boat over the fish and the back has to take the left overs. Besides, I always count each bite, isn't that why they call it fishing, not catching. I've done that ice thing in a 20' duck boat before, that's not something I want to do in a fishing boat. It would be nice not to see any ice or snow this year but that's the chance we take by going early. Do any good down south of the border? 75 days Rich J"
546034,2 DOGS,2005-03-02 21:09:00,361,"Senor B and I slapped them around a little. Got yellow-fin and albacore, plenty to eat. We learned some new fishing techniques with the latest Mexican equipment which you'll have to get him to tell you about. Have him show you the unloading procedure from a boat in 3 feet of water just before a 4 foot roller hits and trying to keep the camera dry!"

546001,Guest,2005-03-01 07:12:00,0,"I'M GOING TO NORTH WEST LAC SEUL IN MAY FOR THE FIRST TIME, I NEED SOME HELP, MAPS ? FISH LOCATIONS ECT. THANKS"
546004,Guest,2005-03-01 09:19:00,0,"Spend $120 and hire a guide for the first day. Bring a bunch of 1/4 ounce jigs, and bottom bouncers with spinners. Bring your GPS and have fun. Not a hard lake to catch a hundred fish a day. The guide will put you on the pattern for that time of year. I usually buy a couple pounds of leeches. There is a Four Seasons Bait Shop in downtown Ear Falls that will have maps, bait, and plenty of spinners and weights for you."
546005,Guest,2005-03-01 09:57:00,0,THANKS FOR THE INFO. TERRY
546007,Guest,2005-03-01 10:30:00,0,"Hi. On the days when the lake is too rough to venture out, and it happens we always had good luck around the bridge pilings that the logging trucks go over and the shoreline goingfrom there to the corner toward the dam. if the water is high even that little inlet next to evergreen."
546008,Guest,2005-03-01 10:32:00,0,"If you want special favors and you are from the Chicago area, the owner of the Four Seasons Bait Shop loves Lou Malnatis Pizza. If you were to bring him one of Lou's half baked frozen sausage pizza's he may reward you a little."
546015,Guest,2005-03-01 20:01:00,0,"Terry from Iowa, This is Pat from Evergreen Lodge. Most camp owners will give you a marked map of the known hazards and put you onto fish. 1/4 oz jigs will propably do you just fine. 95% of our guest tip them with a minnow especially early in the season. Leeches are so, so until the water warms up. We have one party from Des Moines that come up opener every year and one uses leeches and one fishes with minnows its a toss up. Another post on here suggested you brong a gps and I would ask you to respect the guide and not use it with him. He will show you structure to look for and areas you can fish on your own. Have a great time on Lac seul and once you have fished it you'll be back. Pat"
546018,Rich J,2005-03-01 22:12:00,65,"Actually, I think it was more like 60/40 with leaches winning, but that was probably attributed to my superior technique! Many people prefer minnows, I just happen to like leaches. 76 more days Rich J"
546023,2 DOGS,2005-03-02 06:18:00,361,Superior technique??? I had always attributed it to the fact that you were the one keeping score! 76 Days - will that ol Lund be up to breaking ice that soon?
546024,Guest,2005-03-02 06:27:00,0,"We haven't fished Lac Seul yet, but can't wait patiently! In the past, in Canada, we have been strictly, spinners, Lindy rigs, and just a hook and a bead, backtrolling with minnows and crawlers. Normally hate to jig and bottom bounce. Are we going to have to change our technique?"
546027,Guest,2005-03-02 11:12:00,0,"No, you won't HAVE to change, but like going anywhere there seems to be a few ""best"" techniques over just the ""good"" techniques. Others on here are right . . . you need to know the general pattern happening at that time of year (and every year is different). If a guide shows you the pattern, you can often find many spots with similar depth and structure which should also hold 'eyes (barring a major weather change-usually in the form of a large cold-front, particularly in May). Of course, your best bet is to just keep the guide for the entire trip. What else? . . It is interesting to see the guide-GPS issue coming up again . . . this is really it's own discussion. Minnows will outproduce leaches in the long run, I've tested it many times. The advantage of leaches over minnows is their lifespan, but in the cold water of spring, you lose very few minnows, so stick with the minnows. If you want an even better fishing experience, try the south-central area of the lake. NWO Fishing Bum"
