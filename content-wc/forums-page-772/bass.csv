545930,Guest,2005-02-24 11:24:00,0,"Hi. OK thanks for all the great advice. yes you are right those tourney guys are all beating the shore with lures and none around where we are fhishing for walleyes or northerns. we were in area aggested for bass so tried the worm on the hook jigging thing and they would hit the bait so quick and hard there was no time to react, they were gone. I will try some of your suggestions this july when we are up there again. thanks alan"
545949,Guest,2005-02-25 16:11:00,0,"Alan, If you are fishing up to mid July, the smallmouth will be in the top 8 feet of water. Shoreline with up to basketball size rocks, with some weeds and deep water not to far away is best. For soft plastics, I use Tender Tubes from BPS with 1/8-1/4 ounce tender tube jigheads on 8 pound gold stren. I leave the last 1/8-1/4 inch of the tube with air in it for better action. Try to arrange the skirt of the tube to be balanced around the hook shank to give a back and forth retrieve like walking the dog, working it on the bottom. Colors I recommend are shad and avocado green. #11 minnow rapalas work very well also. Bandit crankbaits are effective casting in up to 6-8 FOW, just make sure they are tuned. You can also troll the Bandits with 8 pound mono with 35 yards of line out on the bottom in 13-14 feet of water to catch smallmouth, walleye, pike and muskie. You might want a 14-20 pound flourocarbon 12-14 inch leader tied to a barrel swivel to decrease bite offs. Fishing rapids is good also, with any of the above lures. Good luck, Don"

545767,Guest,2005-02-15 00:54:00,0,Hi. As long as we have been going to canada to fish we have never even caught a bass accidently. this is at lac saul or LOTW's. i would have thought that even accidently we would have caught some using the walleye rig or trolling. what do I have to do to catch bass? we were up there during the sioux narrows bass contest so I guess there are plenty of them. thanks alan
545778,Guest,2005-02-15 09:35:00,0,"My one question: Do you see any of those tourney anglers fishing where you are targeting walleye? I mean, any even in the general vicinity? Or are they on completely different parts of the lake? In general terms, there are areas of LOTW that hold bass and those that don't. Very simplistic, but fish a tourney and you'll find that out in a hurry. Those bass aren't too easy to catch either....just ask the tourney boys. Takes a considerable amount of skill to catch....especially during a tournament when the fishing pressure is through the roof. My advice is to watch the tourney guys and see what they are doing and where they are fishing. You'd probably do better sticking to shallow areas near shore, but some shallower hump and reefs offshore hold smallies. Just so you know...the opposite is also true....over the 4 years I've fished the Sioux Narrows tourney, I've only caught ONE incidental walleye. We bass anglers are out there thinking the same thing....where are all those darned walleyes all the resort guys are catching? ;-)"
545781,Guest,2005-02-15 17:56:00,0,"Whitefish Bay has very clear water. Years ago, when I wanted to catch smallmouth there, I used 6 lb line and a heavy lure such as (believe it or not) a small black and white spoon. The idea is to stay as far from shore as possible and stil be able to place the lure next to shore. Back when I had a little more energy than I do now, and wanted to catch bass, I exprimented with wearing different colored clothing. Wearing bright clothes, and with the use of polaroid glasses, I could see the bass heading for deep water as I approached the shore. Wearing drab, etc, clothes, made a difference, as I could get closer before I spooked them. The folks on TV have to wear all the pretty clothes in order to look cool on the set, you do not. In water that is stained, color is less a factor. Good luck, Bill Krejca"
545787,bronzeback77,2005-02-16 16:02:00,97,Its funny that you mention Whitefish Bay. I have fished it a lot the past 7 years and have caught many Smallmouth while our boat is right on top of them ( not on purpose). In fact many times I have been shocked at how brave and unafraid they were acting.
545793,Guest,2005-02-16 20:06:00,0,"Have fished NW side of LS for 10+ years. Each year it seems like I encounter more and more of those elusive bronzebacks. Most of them are caught on spinner rigs fishing for walleyes. Have chunked cranks around reefs and pulled a few doing that. Did catch one 17""er throwing a 1 1/2 oz blk/wht daredevil. That stump sucker got a taste of all 3 hooks! Bet it didn't eat for a few days! Most of these fish were caught in McKenzie Bay."
545798,Guest,2005-02-17 09:50:00,0,last year was my first year so I don't have much experience but we tageted the smallmouth on LOTW in June and caught a couple hundred between the 2 of us. The key at that time was simple...broken rocks. We were around the N/falls area but I have heard Kenora has even better bass fishing?? good luck.
545799,Stu,2005-02-17 10:02:00,472,"We have fished Wabaskang exclusively for the past few years. We usually fish for smallies in the fast water narrows. We have the best luck using green ""chompers"" (scented grubs) w/ a stand up jig head. 4-6 lb. test w/ clear or green line. During the spawn, we catch them here (in KS) in about 12 ft. of water using the same method. Good luck - Stu"

Try a differant lake like Rainy.I used to fish l.o.t.w. lots untill my party started going to lac seull about 9 or 10 yrs. ago,We had good times at both untill one of the guy's mentioned trying a bass trip to rainy,the next year we fished 3 day's on rainy then a week on lacsuell.For the last 5 yrs we have been enjoying rainy lake twice a year.It's an amazing mixed fishery,awesome bass fishing,huge crappies,tons of big pike+ the odd musky,and more and more walleyesevery year thanks to there slot size.I have found the walleye fishing better on the south arm for #'s especialy,but with any wind you're blown off the water even in my 2025 lund.We now stay on the north arm,much quieter and not as many cabins as the south.The fishing is much better up north exept for the walleye #'s,what they lacks in numbers they make up for in size,in stead of boating 80 to 100 eyes a day you might catch 40 to 60 fish but your average weight will be much greater. Rainy has even converted a few of our hardcore eye guy's to smallies but thats the great thing about it walleye lovers,smallmouth fanatics,northern hunters and crappie killers all in the same group,and lovin it."

545848,Guest,2005-02-21 08:46:00,0,"Hi Alan, I've been fishing Dryberry for the last twelve seasons and by far it is one of the best smallmouth fisheries I have ever been on. I'm usually more of a musky fisherman but sometimes I need a break and the smallmouth fishing on that water has been outstanding. You might want to give them a try. Thanks Dave"
