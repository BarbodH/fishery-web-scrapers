6655926,pjshorthorn,2022-05-14 05:30:00,5654,The best part is that half of the group has never fished this lake before on been on a HB adventure. This will be my 11th trip piloting the HB so it is going to be fun to give the group a fun way to see a large part of Lac Seul. I have never slept better than on HB trips. Something about hearing the water lap against the pontoons of the boat at night .hypnotic for sure. Lots of pictures for sure. PjShorthorn
6655928,pjshorthorn,2022-05-14 05:33:00,5654,"LOL we have a few of those guys already on the trip, but a couple more would be better PjShorthorn"
6655934,Eckohlt,2022-05-14 05:46:00,3685,"Pj hope you have a light chop every night to slap those pontoons,otherwise your going to be tired by weeks end.the rookies I'm sure will be amazed by the great outdoors on seul."
6655958,pjshorthorn,2022-05-14 06:53:00,5654,There is always a walleye chop on this lake ..giant water with a lot of narrows ( wind tunnels) to help fishing and sleeping. PjShorthorn
6655992,Eckohlt,2022-05-14 09:55:00,3685,Do you get up as far as perch ripple or no need to that far?
6656020,Yellowfin123,2022-05-14 13:20:00,2182,if all people had to sleep on boats the sleeping pill industry would go bankrupt and there would be alot less anxiety in the world
6656022,pjshorthorn,2022-05-14 15:03:00,5654,"I have fished all the way up to Jackfish Narrows and Pickerel Narrows. Perch Ripple is about the end of the road on the NE section. Never needed to go that far. Might poke my nose ,this year , up to where the Wapesi River comes into Wapesi Bay. Beautiful waterfalls there. PjShorthorn"
6656024,Eckohlt,2022-05-14 15:07:00,3685,As long as the boats not the titanic!l life ending sleeping pill.
6648468,Eckohlt,2022-04-16 14:51:00,3685,"For me,nothing better than having the wife along on a Ontario fishing trip,she loves it up there,in fact we are doing a 3 cpl's trip next year,just gotta find a place to fly into."
6650762,pjshorthorn,2022-04-25 10:39:00,5654,"Flew down to NC this past weekend to meet Mojo-NC and the rest of the crew for a bit of trip planning on our upcoming houseboat adventure on Lac Seul. We had a blast hanging out and fishing Lake Gaston for bass and then catfish at night. Such a solid group of guys, we are going to have a ton of fun. The Philly Cheesesteaks were the bomb , cooked on a Blackstone grill. I'm thinking we can do that again in Canada using a big Ol cast iron skillet. We are still looking to fill our sixth spot on the trip. If you have an interest, PM myself or Mojo-NC for more info. PjShorthorn"
6650764,Eckohlt,2022-04-25 10:42:00,3685,Looks like a lot fun to me.I'm sure you guys will have a blast on seul.
6655802,pjshorthorn,2022-05-13 09:33:00,5654,Still looking for a couple of folks to join us on a Lac Seul houseboat adventure. Dates are 7/8- 7/16. Departure would be out of the Sioux Lookout area. PM myself or Mojo-NC if you would have an interest. PjShorthorn
6655840,prov1800,2022-05-13 13:01:00,5010,Hope you find your fisherman PJ. Seems a lot of guys are unvaxxed so ive found out and hearing.

6655866,walleyecheek,2022-05-13 15:47:00,2231,Heck yeah ! Just cost ya a little more ! No biggy
6655868,prov1800,2022-05-13 15:47:00,5010,I can imagine.
6655894,Yellowfin123,2022-05-13 19:06:00,2182,"i've seen alot of trips advertised about various lakes and outpost and i gota admit i don't think any of them compare to this trip, a houseboat beached in the ne waters of seul is the dream!! if you get sick of catching walleye you can cast for the 65"" musky thats under the houseboat.. gonna need to see a whole album of pictures of this trip"
6655902,Golden Eagle,2022-05-13 19:25:00,2642,I suggest that you require him to have a sharp fillet knife that he's willing to use.
6648364,That Minnesota guy,2022-04-16 07:21:00,8293,Maybe I could smuggle myself down the river into LOTW and head North. I think I could get most of the way there by water.
6648366,prov1800,2022-04-16 07:28:00,5010,That would be a uphill battle going upstream on the English river.
6648372,tandm,2022-04-16 07:36:00,679,"Going up July 24 to fish the Tuk Bay area for the umpteenth time. It's a guys only trip and we're leaving on my wife's anniversary. I wouldn't have to worry about that anniversary, or any other, if I committed to your trip. Haven't been up in the Wapesi area, keep finding new spots where we are staying. Have fun. Be good. Take pictures. Alright, just have fun. the rest is optional."
6648374,Eckohlt,2022-04-16 07:42:00,3685,Is it your wife's anniversary or yours also??
6648402,pjshorthorn,2022-04-16 09:11:00,5654,That would be a pretty trip for sure. PjShorthorn
6648406,pjshorthorn,2022-04-16 09:18:00,5654,I'm sure you have fished 3 sisters and Ski Doo point then. We have caught some really nice pike off of Ski Doo point over the years like in your picture. Just south of that point there are a few islands that have historically help some nice walleye too. You have a safe trip as well. Send me a PM if you would like and I can give you some other spots to try not far from where you will be. PjShorthorn
6648412,ia bhtr,2022-04-16 09:45:00,212,"Our guys only trip starts June 4th , which happens to be our 45th wedding anniversary , I was going to not go , Wifey says after 2 years missing out , you are going !! Dang I married a good woman"
6648420,Eckohlt,2022-04-16 10:02:00,3685,"They'll be many more anniversary to come,god willing,you need a fishing fix and the wife is all in for ya.Good luck"
6648464,tandm,2022-04-16 14:44:00,679,"If I forgo the trip, we will mark our 51st year, together. I've fished and hunted thru many of our birthdays and anniversaries, without complaint from her. I'm starting to think I need to share more of them with her. Have a good trip pj. We'll be in touch. Oh, to answer your question, Echohlt, Yes it is."
6648466,eyecatcher1,2022-04-16 14:47:00,323,We've been together 53 years and had many anniversaries right up there on Lac Seul. We even got up there twice last year after the border opened. I'd say she's a keeper!
6642340,pjshorthorn,2022-03-23 03:55:00,5654,Looking for an adventurous and ardent fisherman to fill the last spot on our houseboat trip to the the NE section of Lac Seul through Sioux Lookout Floating Lodges. We will be heading north out of Sioux Lookout and fishing in a general area from Bear Narrows up to the Wapesi Bay Area and possibly the Pickerel Narrows area. Of course we will be fishing all of the areas in between. The HB will be home base for the trip and we would be utilizing camp boats for our daily fishing excursions. The trip dates are July 9th-16th. We should be able to sleep on the HB the evening of the 8th and launch early the morning of the 9th. For more details PM myself or Mojo-NC. PjShorthorn
6642402,eyecatcher1,2022-03-23 07:41:00,323,"Sounds like a great trip! If I wasn't heading up on the 18th with my wife I'd be really tempted to join you. That's a great part of Lac Seul. Then again, where isn't Lac Seul great?"
6642416,prov1800,2022-03-23 08:09:00,5010,Sounds like a hoot PJ.
6642510,nitroman,2022-03-23 12:30:00,368,You the same PJshorthorn i used to see posting on snowest?
6642532,bigwalleye1,2022-03-23 13:54:00,2632,"Dang. If I wasn't running my own trip to Lac Seul the same week, I'd be interested!! Safe travels, PJ, on the roads and on the water!"
6642854,pjshorthorn,2022-03-24 19:01:00,5654,"I can't be the same guy....an uncle gave me that nickname back in the 1990's on a HB trip to the same area I posted about for this year's trip. I'm kinda scared to ask, but what is snowest? PjShorthorn"
6642922,Hook_settr,2022-03-25 04:45:00,127,If that wasn’t right in the middle of quarter-end at work I would be very tempted. The fishing would be fantastic but I can only imagine how great the stories and shenanigans would be that week!Good luck finding your extra body!Hook_sette!
6643970,nitroman,2022-03-29 06:41:00,368,It's a snowmobile forum for mountain riders. I just remember the name from there. Been awhile as i gave up riding the mountains in 2018.
6643974,Carnhzkr,2022-03-29 07:14:00,964,"Bad timing for me too, Pat. I get back from the NW part of LS on July 2, then head up to LoTW on July 21. The only way I could make it would be to spend the summer at That Minnesota Guy's place. Hmmmm..."
6648360,pjshorthorn,2022-04-16 07:07:00,5654,"We are still looking to fill one more spot on our houseboat trip this summer to the NE section of Lac Seul. We will be fishing in the Chamberlain Narrows area and many other areas as well. Dates are July 8th- July 15th If anyone has an interest, PM myself or Mojo-NC. PjShorthorn"
