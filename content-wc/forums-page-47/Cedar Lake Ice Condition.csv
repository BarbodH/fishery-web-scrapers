6656204,nitroman,2022-05-15 11:55:00,368,We brought one up there a few years ago for a friend with one leg to help him get in and out of the boat. When we left we left it attached to the dock. Ray got quite a few compliments on it and the next year had some made for all the docks! very handy indeed!
6656566,Bill Krejca,2022-05-16 15:41:00,6107,"Yeah, probably one of the best ideas for dock improvement! Made it so much easier with in/out. Bill"
6655114,WalleyeTherapy,2022-05-10 16:22:00,49,Much appreciated. If you have any openings left week of July 3 send me a PM
6655118,prov1800,2022-05-10 16:39:00,5010,Stopped at Cedar Point Lodge launch.There dock is way out from spread water is really high.Current from the pipes is opening up some ice in middle.
6655956,nitroman,2022-05-14 06:51:00,368,Ice this weekend? This is Cedar Point resort last night.
6655960,prov1800,2022-05-14 06:55:00,5010,Looking good.Be all gone soon.
6655962,WalleyeTherapy,2022-05-14 07:00:00,49,That's very encouraging. Thanks for updating.
6656016,nitroman,2022-05-14 13:12:00,368,Gone? Looks like it eh?
6656026,prov1800,2022-05-14 15:17:00,5010,There you go.and a week to spare
6656054,WalleyeTherapy,2022-05-14 18:46:00,49,"Beauty eh! Thanks for updating again. Let's bring on some dry, warm weather up there. Hard to believe after being there last Fall fishing in pretty slow and low water how high water is this Spring."
6656100,Bill Krejca,2022-05-15 06:19:00,6107,"Good to see ice vanishing. A picture reminded me of something which My fellow fishermen and I have appreciated at Cedar Point. This being the vertical grab posts install on the docks. It make it so much easier to get into the boat with something to hang onto. Also, wish all docks had them, as my somewhat shortened radio antenna would testify! Bill"
6656104,prov1800,2022-05-15 06:36:00,5010,Those are definatly handy Bill.High water will help getting out of a boat to lol.
6654948,WalleyeTherapy,2022-05-09 19:58:00,49,Anyone seen recent Cedar Lake ice condition? Wondering if the float planes will be able to fly for opener.
6654978,nitroman,2022-05-10 05:52:00,368,https://manotak.com/dock-cam/ it's coming along nicely. Looks like the ice shifted last night and pushed docks up to the shore. Not that i watch this cam a lot or anything lol! This is on perrault lake.
6654986,jambi,2022-05-10 06:24:00,504,Dock in trouble here too:http://www.fishredpine.com/

6655026,Eckohlt,2022-05-10 08:53:00,3685,"Looks like really bad ice,won't be long."
6655046,prov1800,2022-05-10 09:59:00,5010,10 days to go.
6655054,7 Mag,2022-05-10 10:16:00,1887,Looks like a few docks need repair work.
6655056,WalleyeTherapy,2022-05-10 10:24:00,49,Thank You. Ice is definitely looking pretty dark.
6655080,prov1800,2022-05-10 12:53:00,5010,Wife and I are heading up to Perrault Falls shortly for a drive.Going to check out Cedar and Cliff along the way.Let you know later.Will take some pics.
