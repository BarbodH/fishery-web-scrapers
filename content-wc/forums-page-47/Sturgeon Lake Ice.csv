6655072,guidedfishing,2022-05-10 11:29:00,531,"Well just talked to one of the camp owners this morning by chance on the north end. She was pretty sure the ice would be out in the bay that their camp is located on but highly doubted the ice would be out on the main lake. She is a second generation owner of the camp lived their her entire life so she has a pretty good read of the situation. On the positive side she indicated the lake is coming up very nicely with the run off, and they still have snow melting yet so that is great news considering it was down almost 3ft when I was there last August. Wish I could give you better news on the ice situation. There is some warm weather ahead, and they have rain in the forecast so keep the faith your still a week and a half out, a lot can happen. However, have a back up plan. good luck"

6656634,iman63,2022-05-16 18:34:00,91,We stay at Whiskey Jacks and that bay is open. Camp owner doesn't think main lake will open until end of week.
