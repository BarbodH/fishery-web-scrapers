6655998,Eckohlt,2022-05-14 10:41:00,3685,Maybe hard to tell if it's still full of ice.

Of course it alway comes up in the spring, but I hope this is a sign that the lake will return to somewhat more normal levels by June. In the attached picture the yellow area represents the lake level between the 25th and 75th percentile, in other words average. The red lines are the upper and lower 10%.This screenshot was taken two days ago. The lake level is even higher today.

Same as $$$ Early March 2020 my outfitter and his wife visited me in Tennessee on their way home from vacationing in Florida. I gave him deposit checks for 20 guests some for May 2020 and the rest for July 2020. After he returned home I sent a message asking if I could tell my guys that he would hold the checks until Covid got figured out. Too late. Returning to Red Lake his first stop was at the bank to deposit the checks while our dollar was at $1.48 CA. I took him to the range at the gun club where I'm a member. He shot a box of shells with a handgun, giggling the whole time. Wishing the guys on my side of the border weren't working so hard at weakening our dollar. Too much water in the soup."
