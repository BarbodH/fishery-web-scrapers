6656278,clarksresortsandoutposts,2022-05-15 18:40:00,4,"Hello! Not sure who you talked to, but we have LOTS of flats of crawlers ready to go! We would recommend calling 807-223-5210 to reserve! We also have leeches and minnows too."
6656328,walleyecheek,2022-05-16 05:18:00,2231,Called yesterday morning about 10:30. Talked to a girl that said no flats just styrofoam containers with quite a few crawlers inside&#x1f914; I said what's quite a few ? She said 2 dozen 10 bucks !
6656406,prov1800,2022-05-16 08:29:00,5010,Are they available up at Northern Lights Resort also for the hwy 105 travellers.I'll mention here again anyone travelling up hwy 105 will have to take the detour
6656810,clarksresortsandoutposts,2022-05-17 11:05:00,4,Sorry that they misinformed you... not sure why that happened. Please rest assured we have LOTS of flats... I'm literally looking at them as I type. Please call to reserve one if you wish.. thanks!
6656816,vteye3,2022-05-17 11:32:00,496,"I was quoted $100-120 a flat based on last years pricing for this years trip. Hmm, thought it sounded pricey, being retired i handle a lot of the logistics for our group. One young lady on Trans-Canada RT 11 quoted me either $79 or 69 per flat. She said she was down stairs away from the computer. I said thats fine i'll take 2. She repeated its either $79 or 69 and clearly said, ""she preferred 69 with the giggle that made no mistake about the price of worms"". My ancestors migrated to the states 100 years ago, not sure if Canadian women were the same back then. How difficult is it to migrate back?"
6656146,Eckohlt,2022-05-15 08:05:00,3685,One of my favorites.
6656150,Eckohlt,2022-05-15 08:19:00,3685,"So I usually on a fly in take roughly 80 doz crawlers,so at 18 crawlers per carton to equal 80 dozen at 4.50$ I would have to sell all my fishing gear to buy them,no fishing for me,you figure the total give you something to do today cheeks."
6656170,walleyecheek,2022-05-15 09:45:00,2231,This dont sound like too bad of deal ! Considering there $110 a flat in Nestorfalls.......Just so happens they dont even have any right now ! So the WallyWorld crawlers are looking pretty darn good right about now &#x1f60f;
6656172,walleyecheek,2022-05-15 09:47:00,2231,sorry i forgot to add picture !
6656174,Eckohlt,2022-05-15 09:55:00,3685,Dryden right around $73 a flat US dollar.
6656178,Eckohlt,2022-05-15 09:59:00,3685,"It's only a bad deal if they don't let them in,then you have to go back to the falls n stand on a street corner n try to sell them to someone else trying to cross,see if they can get them across."
6656192,walleyecheek,2022-05-15 10:52:00,2231,Yeah if you can get em ? Just called Clark's.....No flats !!!
6656194,Eckohlt,2022-05-15 11:08:00,3685,Season's not open yet I'm sure they'll have flats soon.
6656234,walleyecheek,2022-05-15 14:31:00,2231,Well i hope so !!!!........or its Walmart here i come !!!!!
6656236,Fisherman Ted,2022-05-15 14:43:00,461,"Sunset baits will have flats available. Leeches probably not, at least in the short term. I was talking to the owner and they said the trappers were not able to get to their traps. -FT"
6655528,Eckohlt,2022-05-12 09:55:00,3685,Right on!then that money can go towards paying the bridge off that we been shelling out cash for years n years.
6655684,dschiebel,2022-05-12 17:39:00,85,"i have a fat fishing partner named Keister Williams, I wonder how many pounds of salted shiners he could swallow if the minnows were in plastic garbage bags. Or ......"
6655690,Eckohlt,2022-05-12 17:57:00,3685,"The salt will give him high blood pressure,he won't make it through the trip,it's a death sentence,poor keister."
6655704,Golden Eagle,2022-05-12 18:24:00,2642,Would like taking Magic Emerald Shiner Minnows into Ontario. Wondering why they are not allowed.
6655708,Eckohlt,2022-05-12 18:26:00,3685,It's a mystery!
6656098,walleyecheek,2022-05-15 06:10:00,2231,Am i allowed to bring these Walmart crawlers packed in Dirt Back Into Canada ?
6656134,Eckohlt,2022-05-15 07:31:00,3685,"Probably not if they smell like garlic,they probably put the garlic in the dirt here in the states,so I say nope not going back cnd,I wouldn't mind trying one on the grill though."
6656138,walleyecheek,2022-05-15 07:35:00,2231,How about the non-garlic ?
6656140,Eckohlt,2022-05-15 07:38:00,3685,"I'll buy some try to get them in,do they have any chocolate flavored crawlers?I'll eat those on the way up."
6656144,walleyecheek,2022-05-15 07:55:00,2231,"No , the closest thing i can come to on that is ......Black licorice"
6653524,Riding high,2022-05-03 18:24:00,69,So I'm gona ask because someone just told me you can bring worms and frozen minnows this year. I know we could not last year and I thought we couldn't this year. Didn't know if it just changed???
6653526,Eckohlt,2022-05-03 18:28:00,3685,"No worms no minnows no eggs,just bring lots of cash.have fun."
6653538,Riding high,2022-05-03 18:37:00,69,Thanks that's what I thought. I told him he was wrong.
6655442,walleyecheek,2022-05-12 04:54:00,2231,I also read that you or i can bring 5 dozen eggs
6655460,Bill Krejca,2022-05-12 07:24:00,6107,"Also ruled out are the live chickens which so many of us have gotten used to bringing, hoping this will change in the future!!! Bill"
6655470,Eckohlt,2022-05-12 07:53:00,3685,"Ya gonna miss traveling with them,I like bringing a rooster for alarm clock."
6655476,nitroman,2022-05-12 08:07:00,368,"I'll still bring mine. Let him out at the Holiday station in IF and pick him back up at Tim's across the border. Do the same with the trained minnows, drop em in in MN pick em up on the Canada side."
6655482,Eckohlt,2022-05-12 08:16:00,3685,"You got a smart rooster,mines brain dead."
6655488,walleyecheek,2022-05-12 09:04:00,2231,Here ya go !
6655514,stjoeguy,2022-05-12 09:39:00,979,"The duty free shop in Int. Falls should start selling worms, minnows and eggs. Pick them up, along with the booze and beer, right before you cross the bridge!"
