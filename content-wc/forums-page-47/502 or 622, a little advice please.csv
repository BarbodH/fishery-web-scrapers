6656772,stumcfar,2022-05-17 08:21:00,451,"We are doing a fly in and fly out near Savant Lake. Can anyone make a recommendation on getting there from International Falls. The quickest route on paper says take 622 to Ignace, but no one seems to know that road. Is taking 502 to Dryden and then to Sioux Lookout the best route? Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
