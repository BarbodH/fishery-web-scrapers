6654656,Beach33,2022-05-08 12:04:00,11,"Yes, that's when we are scheduled as well. We have a back up date to go to Little Miniss in June. Unfortunately, I'm more focused on that."
6656102,schoolofhardknocks,2022-05-15 06:20:00,29,After a week of warm days and todays high wind the ice went off PAC base camp at 5 p.m today! Water levels are really high. Hope to see a few outposts and check out the ice situation on Monday.
6656130,Eckohlt,2022-05-15 07:27:00,3685,Be up there June 12.
6656152,Beach33,2022-05-15 08:41:00,11,Ya I saw that yesterday. Unbelievable it went out that fast. Mother Nature still proves to be unpredictable.
6653892,danvan18$,2022-05-05 11:52:00,67,You lucky- it's been on our wish list for years- always full when we want to go. I have fished the adjoining lake many times and the pool after the rapids from shore only. Maybe PAC needs to get a boat on each side of the rapids???
6653896,rosh1,2022-05-05 11:55:00,275,"Was ice fishing Sunday, still a couple of feet. Water crossing 502 north of Fort Frances yesterday. Things should change fast with the warmer temps."
6653902,Beach33,2022-05-05 12:31:00,11,"Ok, thanks for the info"
6653904,Beach33,2022-05-05 12:32:00,11,Yes I know what you are talking about.
6654198,Beach33,2022-05-06 13:35:00,11,This is encouraging
6654212,RRK285,2022-05-06 14:25:00,44,Im flying out to Keike with PAC in a few weeks. Bringing my 10 and 9 year olds on their first ever trip to Canada. Hoping to have a good experience. I am used to all the big bodies of water so this smaller lake and fly-in hopefully will be fun.
6654214,Eckohlt,2022-05-06 14:26:00,3685,"Heading there in august,hope you guys have a blast."
6654234,danvan18$,2022-05-06 15:48:00,67,I sent you a PM
6654240,Beach33,2022-05-06 15:55:00,11,That will be awesome for them. I have 7&5 yr old girls. Tough to talk them into that trip ha
6654650,schoolofhardknocks,2022-05-08 11:23:00,29,"Hi we are scheduled to fly into Keiki on the 18th or 19th. They posted a report yesterday on Facebook. Yes, I am nervous. We have an off grid place on Greenwood (Cook County) and are going there first and they have major snow pack up there as of yesterday. https://www.facebook.com/pickerelarm"
6653836,Beach33,2022-05-05 06:43:00,11,Any one have a ice report for the Sioux Lookout area specifically lake Minnitaki? Flying out of there for the opener. We do have a back up already planned but would like to go to the same lake we've been going to for 15 years.
6653840,prov1900,2022-05-05 07:01:00,544,"Donneley's FB page posted a video not too long ago. Looks like it will be a close one. Fished the opener there many years in a row and had to go around a few ice flows here and there. He had a backup for us one of the years as it was locked in two days prior to our arrival. Opened up the night before we rolled in, through some kind of miracle lol. It is a stress filled feeling."
6653842,Beach33,2022-05-05 07:11:00,11,Ya that's what I'm expecting.. gonna come down to the wire. Thanks for the info. Fingers crossed
6653858,rockape,2022-05-05 09:07:00,215,"LOVE Minnitaki. Close to Lac Seul minus Muskies (which I love to catch). I've fished Minnitaki about 20 years now. ALWAYS catch fish too. I am up there the last week of June. Really missed the last 2 years. Anyway, tell us about your trip and how the water levels are!"
6653870,IaDave14,2022-05-05 10:18:00,99,Take a look at fishredpine.com they have a web cam on Abrams Lake connected to Minnitaki.
6653872,Beach33,2022-05-05 10:18:00,11,Ya I've heard Minnitaki is great fishing. We fly out of there from Pickerel Arm Camp. The good thing is the outpost is a close smaller lake so I'm not worried about ice out on that as much as I am Minnitaki
6653880,danvan18$,2022-05-05 11:19:00,67,Which lake are you flying to? Sounds like Keike or Kabi- both great lakes. I have been flying with PAC since 1995.
6653884,rockape,2022-05-05 11:20:00,215,"I bet it is gone in 10 days. Crazy late, but I love late ice out for when I head up there."
6653888,Beach33,2022-05-05 11:47:00,11,"Yep- flying into Kabi. Awesome lake, been our go to for years. Of course, there are many many awesome lakes."
6653890,Beach33,2022-05-05 11:49:00,11,I've actually been keeping an eye on that. I was just curious if anyone had a decent idea on ice thickness. If we have a shot or should just focus on Plan B. Crazy year but good weather coming.
