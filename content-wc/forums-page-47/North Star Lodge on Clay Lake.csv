6655842,prov1800,2022-05-13 13:03:00,5010,It's shut down and being worked on.
6655700,prov1800,2022-05-12 18:19:00,5010,Fishing is great in spring on this system as it is all seasonRod.If you know where to go.Have fished to high water for years and have had water this high a few times before.
6655764,Walleye2242,2022-05-13 06:16:00,263,This was my 1st camp I ever went too. 1979. the Gettings owned it at that time. We heard there were mercury issues in the lake?
6655768,Pooch,2022-05-13 06:46:00,4618,Wife and I fished Clay lake many years ago. Back then the water was coffee with cream colored. Is it still like that? Always figured that was why it was called Clay Lake?Incidentally I met a guy who had just lost his fishing partner and was also there with his wife. We became friends and fished together until he passed away a few years ago. Life is just a series of coincidences sometimes...Pooch
6655776,Walleye2242,2022-05-13 07:09:00,263,This was 1979 so might not be quite as clear and I was 8 at the time. I know we portaged into another lake.....Mink lake maybe?????? There was another boat on the lake and they came over and asked us if we had a Dr. in the group...actually we did but was not in our boat...one of the guys in the boat had 3 huge treble hooks just buried in the middle of his back. He was in the middle seat and was overhead casting for muskies. They flew into the lake for the day and were not getting picked up till late. Guy had to sit there all day with 3 huge treble hooks buried in his back.
6655782,prov1800,2022-05-13 07:23:00,5010,Mink is a fantastic lake and its still unreal for walleye and pike.No muskies in there.there are a couple of portage lakes into some muskie waters.Smaller fish but good action.Black lake ring a bell.Fluke Lake can get into off deer lake road and wilderness air flies into it strictly muskie lake.
6655796,Walleye2242,2022-05-13 09:12:00,263,Yes...Fluke lake. We went into Mink lake as well. Wow...memories. Mink lake was a walleye factory back then. Can you drive to mink lake?
6655798,prov1800,2022-05-13 09:15:00,5010,Yes.we cut trail years ago and got in.Now logging rd goes close and can bring a small boat.Still a walleye factory.not busy.
6655818,Knutson21,2022-05-13 10:31:00,348,"John, I fish that area often, I stay at the Red Ivy Cabin. We have fished Sequise, Fluke, Black and No Name, I do not know which one Mink is. Where is that in relation to the others?"
6655832,prov1800,2022-05-13 12:29:00,5010,If you go up north arm on Clay just past cabin we had portage trail to mink on left as you went in roward carter lake.Or we went down deer lake rd and came up another logging rd.its just east of sequise lake.if you look on map.far from you guys.

6655644,prov1800,2022-05-12 15:20:00,5010,Drove up to camp to check things.With water high on Wabigoon River Clay Lake on most years rises and this year it rose a lot.Have seen the water up to the store before but number of years ago.Took pics andAlso couple of pics from Wayne Clark shows what it looks like from the air.
6655656,7 Mag,2022-05-12 16:11:00,1887,"That’s a lot of water, hope you don’t get any rain for a few days."
6655658,Eckohlt,2022-05-12 16:29:00,3685,"Water looks very brown,is it always that color?"
6655660,walleyecheek,2022-05-12 16:34:00,2231,I'd say its muddy !
6655668,Eckohlt,2022-05-12 17:03:00,3685,"Maybe that's where the music man muddy waters got his name,from clay lake."
6655670,prov1800,2022-05-12 17:05:00,5010,Clay Lake is stained water as it is on Wabigoon lake but right now lot of mud being taken of the shorelines all the way from dryden with the high water.Lots of debris also
6655672,prov1800,2022-05-12 17:10:00,5010,"[QUOTE=7 Mag;6655656]That’s a lot of water, hope you don’t get any rain for a few Unfortunately we are expecting around 2"" in next 2 days.Bad deal"
6655678,v-bay gord,2022-05-12 17:25:00,3168,"I feel for the folks at North Star right now. Opening up tourist camps in a normal spring can be stressful enough.....this is over the top. With the amount of ice still on the lakes, and liable to move with the next big blow, there is the possibility for a lot of damage in the next week or so. If you're a seasonal cottager up here I hope you fastened everything down way above high water mark...otherwise it's on the move right now. I hope we all make it through this mess and have a great 2022 season!"
6655682,prov1800,2022-05-12 17:34:00,5010,Eventually it will stop flooding unless it's a wet seasòn.Lets hope not.
6655696,Eckohlt,2022-05-12 18:06:00,3685,Fishing on a river system up there may not work very well at the start.
