6655966,v-bay gord,2022-05-14 07:04:00,3168,As of yesterday Eagle Lake water levels were at 1191 feet above sea level...the highest it's been since 1947. The top of the dam in Eagle River is 1192.
6655968,That Minnesota guy,2022-05-14 07:11:00,8293,"Water levels on Rainy are approaching the 2014 flood levels. Docks all have barrels to keep them from floating away. Sandbagging operations are under way. They expect the level to rise another 13"" if we don't get anymore rain. They put no wake restrictions of 300 feet from the shoreline on yesterday. Gord did you get the big rains Wednesday night into Thursday?"
