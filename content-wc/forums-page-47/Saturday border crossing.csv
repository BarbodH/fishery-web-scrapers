6656518,MikeAnkeny,2022-05-16 13:21:00,67,If staying in Dryden Friday night we usually go bowling from 5 to 7 in International and by then the crossing is a breeze. Latley though we have getting to camp late Friday and pay the camp for the extra night.
6656530,Eckohlt,2022-05-16 13:49:00,3685,Your the first I've ever heard of going bowling on a trip and I've been going up since 1961.don't throw your fishing shoulder of the socket trying to fire the ball down the alley 100mph.
6656808,KevinSB,2022-05-17 10:46:00,73,Thanks to all for the helpful replies. I've booked early each year except the first year (that's a story for another time) so have the lodging covered. Rather than booking in IF we elected to cross on Friday and stay in FF on Friday this year. Hopefully that will prove a good decision! Thanks again.
6656822,SweetD,2022-05-17 11:39:00,243,The only downside I see is no Border Bob’s Pizza for dinner Fri evening &#x1f60e;
6656890,bushead11,2022-05-17 15:19:00,151,My recommendation would be to call some lodges just outside of Rainy and see if you can pay them to use an empty cabin for the night. Or do what we did back in 2015-16 and tell them to keep the kitchen open and that you'll for 8 hungry and thirsty guys if they let you stay for free... Our group ate a ton of steaks and drank a ton of beer. It was about a $600 hotel room if I remember correctly...
6655854,That Minnesota guy,2022-05-13 14:38:00,8293,It's only a hour run to the Falls from Orr so plan accordingly.
6655856,walleyecheek,2022-05-13 14:42:00,2231,"I think 502 is classified as ""anything goes"" &#x1f923;"
6655860,Ricky Spanish,2022-05-13 15:20:00,1298,I get passed A LOT on 502 coming and going to Eagle. I typically go a bit over whatever the speed limit is everywhere but it seems like a lot of others think 80kph and 80mph are the same thing on 502.
6655878,Eckohlt,2022-05-13 17:28:00,3685,Anything goes on the 502 until you hit something hard.
6655932,tv4fish,2022-05-14 05:44:00,2694,OR - Something a little softer ---------------like a moose......
6655990,Beege,2022-05-14 09:15:00,3,"We always stay at the Voyager Motel. Shop, Pack and prep, cross border 4 am, no wait"
6656446,KevinSB,2022-05-16 10:11:00,73,"We've typically gotten in line in International Falls around 6:30 a.m. on Saturday (week 3 of the season) each year and been across within 20-25 minutes. I don't pretend to know what 2022 will bring but in the past 6:30 has been fine. On a related note, my group is looking to cross on Friday between 2-3pm and stay in Fort Frances this year. Does anybody have a sense for likely wait time? We've seen the long lines at 5pm and later but hoping crossing a little earlier brings some relief. Best of luck to all new and returning fishermen in 2022! Kevin"
6656450,Eckohlt,2022-05-16 10:36:00,3685,"I'm thinking Friday afternoon could be crazy at the border,but I just know fishing not border stuff."
6656474,That Minnesota guy,2022-05-16 11:23:00,8293,This isn't like last year where the border opened late and everybody had been locked out for a year or longer. There are less people going (if you believe what you read on-line) plus everybody knows what is expected / needed to cross. Allow yourselves time to cross and get to your camp. Water is crazy high and the fish aren't going anywhere. Treat this year like you would any other year prior to Covid.
6656494,guidedfishing,2022-05-16 12:24:00,531,"Yup, totally agree, there certainly will not be more going than had went typically at this time of year in the past so plan accordingly. You know the border busy times will be Friday afternoon through Saturday. Plan accordingly. I don't think there is any need to over think it. If you needed a hotel reservation for a Friday night or Saturday you probably should of already had it booked if your going in June."
6655070,10point,2022-05-10 11:20:00,102,"Thanks, we got a room in Orr for a good price. Family owned motel that has good reviews. Just have to drive further on Friday. Driving up with my 81 year old Dad so we might be a little slow."
6655168,pjshorthorn,2022-05-11 03:44:00,5654,I call those motorists  rabbits. I'll chase them all night long down a highway ..just far enough back that I have plenty of time to stop if they lock em up. PjShorthorn
6655170,Eckohlt,2022-05-11 03:55:00,3685,"May 20 n 21 be a great time for mr.police man to get the radar gun out on the 502,he would be a busy guy.Be lots of jack *** rabbits."
6655210,Hook_settr,2022-05-11 07:09:00,127,Ugh! I can't imagine the congestion that would cause. Not a lot of room to get off to the side on that stretch of road and the heavy traffic that weekend would be a nightmare. Nice revenue generator though! LOL
6655214,prov1800,2022-05-11 07:13:00,5010,Been up and down 502 a lot and don't think I've ever seen a cop.
6655242,Eckohlt,2022-05-11 09:35:00,3685,"There rare,but I've seen them."
6655736,alanexpup,2022-05-12 21:35:00,278,"Stop for the night in fort Francis. We tried international fall a couple times but that's a bad idea. Then we started stopping for the night in fort Francis. The best place and safest is la place randevous. Great rooms, great parking and great food. No rifraf here. Plenty of room for parking with boats. You won't regret the stop. Good luck."
6655770,10point,2022-05-13 06:50:00,102,We will be staying in Orr on Friday night June 3rd. Say we get to Fort Frances about 7 am what type of wait at the border should we expect?
6655808,SweetD,2022-05-13 10:08:00,243,Been awhile but early June following 2 years of trips being shut down it will be a zoo is my guess. We always go through Fri evening or an alternative day if we can line our trips up right. Saturday mornings in early June from prior experience have always been the worst I have experience in terms of wait to cross. I personally would get my rear-end up and in line at 4:30am on Saturday morning. Not trying to be doomsday’r and if you are not on a tight timeline by all means can sit it out and burn that $5 gal gas while sitting for 2+ hours!!!Good Luck
6655812,Ricky Spanish,2022-05-13 10:19:00,1298,Same recommendation
6655018,Bakefish,2022-05-10 08:37:00,1077,Stay on I80 west and go north on I39. Only one toll and no crazy Chicago traffic. Started doing that several years ago and never looked back.
6655030,Yellowfin123,2022-05-10 09:01:00,2182,"yea what a nightmare in chicago plus the people paying with cash have to weave over 5 lanes to hit the right pay booth.. houston same way.. the main problem with toll roads is the inner cities, but the more wide open freeways i think tolls roads are great, its the only way possible to get new roads built now days"
6655032,prov1800,2022-05-10 09:32:00,5010,I'll take 502 in the dark and the moose anytime.
6655034,Bakefish,2022-05-10 09:39:00,1077,I'm with ya.
6655036,prov1800,2022-05-10 09:44:00,5010,Blew through a few. Was using Clarks SUV.Dont know if they sent him a bill.Lol.
6655038,Golden Eagle,2022-05-10 09:54:00,2642,"Gotta watch for dead moose on the road, also. They are harder to spot, especially when approaching a dip in the road."
6655040,prov1800,2022-05-10 09:55:00,5010,Have made a lot of trips on 502.we always leave in dark from our house to get a good start.Mostly in winter.My wife and i have oretty keen eyes for spotting wildlife as all our roads are like 502.#105 is worse for wildlife.My son works in Red Lake at the mine and drives back and forth every 2 weeks and sees moose all the time.Just life here.Have I had close calls yup but never any damage as I don't drive fast and can slow down.Drove through a dozen moose once slowly but one got close enoufh to put some nose goop on my mirror and window.They wouldn't move.Always a adventure.
6655044,prov1800,2022-05-10 09:58:00,5010,Yup.Have pulled a couple off center of the road.
6655052,7 Mag,2022-05-10 10:12:00,1887,"I've gone that way a couple of times, it does add some time to the trip but you're right it's an easier drive. Lately i've been taking 80-355-88-39, it's not bad just expensive."
6655060,That Minnesota guy,2022-05-10 10:33:00,8293,"I pulled RV's from Elkhart area for a while, always went across to 39."
6654930,Eckohlt,2022-05-09 18:38:00,3685,Lots of fish to hammer n eat!
6654932,btyreprich,2022-05-09 19:18:00,1067,"We always stay at the Hilltop Motel and leave their parking lot just a few minutes after 6 am. The lines to cross the border haven't been bad at all in our opinion. We enjoy going out for dinner in town / having a few drinks / play a few hands of cards before calling it a night. With regards to highway 502 - we've seen enough scary things - in the daytime let alone at night - to ever consider going on that road. Some of the driving / passing moves I've see over the years reminds me of the movie ""The Road Warrior""! We know that highway 71 will add 30 minutes to the trip and plan accordingly. Whatever you decide to do - travel safely and enjoy the drive."
6654950,valley366,2022-05-09 20:25:00,193,Thanks for all the pointers guys. La Place had a room when calling that was not showing on the website. This makes it nice as we like to time our crossing for early evening on Friday when the lines are minimal. We can have dinner at the hotel with a beverage or two and relax for the evening. Get up and make the final stretch to camp. Check in time isn't until early afternoon so no need to rush.Good luck on the trips this year.
6654952,WalleyeTherapy,2022-05-09 20:28:00,49,"Good Poutine, Cold beer and comfy beds with a view of Rainy Lake. Lots to like there. Good luck fishing"
6654954,SweetD,2022-05-09 20:38:00,243,"I had 2 buddies that actually stayed in this joint in Fort Frances one night. I personally would have turned around and gone back to International Falls or taken my chances with the Moose but they braved it. To each their own I guess. With children no way! With a steel sword and body armor (and one &#x1f441;&#xfe0f; open) maaaaaaube if I had not slept for 4 days straight………and no, I don’t have the name or # for this joint!!!! Good luck."
6654972,pjshorthorn,2022-05-10 05:08:00,5654,"I drive slower on 502 starting at dusk. If there is an energetic motorist that wants to pass, have at it. I figure they can clear the moose out before I get to them myself. PjShorthorn"
6654994,REG,2022-05-10 06:50:00,445,"I've driven 502 and 105 in the dark plenty of times in the past 30+ years. Never went very fast. Always saw the moose in plenty of time to avoid them. But I still remember many years ago coming back south on a Saturday morning and seeing a boat, trailer, and conversion van wrecked in the ditch on 502 - but all 3 of those things were no longer connected, not even the boat to the trailer or the van to the trailer. A little farther south was the dead moose they had hit as they were heading north. The last time I drove up there in the dark was 2018. I started south down 105 dark and early on the way home, taking it easy, until a big cow moose decides to lope out of the woods right in front of me from my left, going right. Never saw her till she hit the left shoulder of the road. I steered a bit to the left and hit the brakes hard but she ended up busting off my right side rear view mirror and glanced off the side of my boat. The right hand mirror was the only casualty - by some miracle she didn't even hurt the fender on my boat trailer -but there was moose hair in what was left of the busted mirror and even in the rub strip on my boat. That is way too close for my sphincter... If you choose to drive at night, be careful, and you'll probably never come as close as I did. But now I don't drive in Canada when it's dark. Scared of the dark? A little, yes. More like giving the dark the respect it deserves.. I'll take a little extra time now to avoid something that would definitely ruin my trip."
6654996,Eckohlt,2022-05-10 06:54:00,3685,"That's the way to do it pj,most are energetic,70 to 80 mph even on the curves."
6655006,prov1800,2022-05-10 08:19:00,5010,Went throufh in 2019 and couldn't get over how many times we had to stop and pay.

6654888,That Minnesota guy,2022-05-09 16:25:00,8293,Yes but if I recall you live where there are shooting all the time. I'm pretty sure thats what you said. So tempting fate at night isn't new to you right?
6654890,Eckohlt,2022-05-09 16:32:00,3685,"Right.I'll drive at night on the 502 if I have to doesn't bother me.like I say been done lots,years ago befor they did plenty of work on the road,I was more worried about hitting 2ft deep pot holes on the road at night."

You have the Hilltop motel, the Falls Motel, plus a couple of new ones that should be open. Get some rest and then cross, it would be a shame to travel that far and then have a accident because you are tired."
6654812,10point,2022-05-09 12:11:00,102,I am finding hotels in Duluth for June 3rd about double what I was expecting compared to what we have paid in Sault St Marie for out past trips. Is $200 for anything decent typical or is another factor of inflation?
6654822,That Minnesota guy,2022-05-09 12:33:00,8293,"To me it's a reflection of what they are having to pay for cleaning people. Resorts are paying $25-$30 an hour up here to change over the cabins and they still are struggling to find help. You can also check the motels in Orr, they might be cheaper."
6654836,elway12,2022-05-09 13:43:00,335,$200 a night for a good motel/hotel is the going rate for Duluth. I have gotten rates as low as $130 but that's when a reservation is made 8 or more months in advance. Duluth is a summer destination so they can & do charge more during that season.
6654840,valley366,2022-05-09 14:04:00,193,Thanks for the pointers. We usually get to the border in the evening and like others have the thoughts that 502 is best traveled during the day.Will call La Place and see what they have. Could also give the kid the experience of one of the economical places if can find one. Always good to give the kid an experience to remember.I remember my first trip to Canada. Stayed at a place in Sioux Lookout I believe. Year was about 1982. Was a two story motel with outside walkway. Every time someone walked by outside the room would shake. Being a layover location there was a ton of foot traffic starting at about 3am.Thanks again.
