6656298,PRO-V16,2022-05-15 21:20:00,454,That should flush some more mercury out of the neighborhood.
6656322,Skywagon,2022-05-16 05:04:00,1106,"Wait until they put in a high-level nuclear waste dump upstream of Dryden, that will take your mind off of the odor of the mill and the mercury in the Wabigoon river that dumps out in Clay lake and eventually runs into Lac Seul. There is still time to express your opinion on that before it actually happens."
6656386,PRO-V16,2022-05-16 07:56:00,454,I would imagine they don't care what a nonresident thinks.
6656388,prov1800,2022-05-16 07:56:00,5010,That's for sure.All the way into Hudson Bay along its route through NWO and into Manitoba.Then it will meet up with some more crap from the Rainy River into LOT W and out the Winnipeg Ŕiver that's not talked about much.

6656496,prov1800,2022-05-16 12:30:00,5010,Boat fired up in yard.Probablý heading out for trout tom on Cliff.Think launching is going to require rubber boots as prop hole is about 50 ft away from water line.

6656526,Eckohlt,2022-05-16 13:46:00,3685,"Hope ya stick a few,give them a jab of the john Jakob vax,then another day give them a booster right in the live well."
6656536,prov1800,2022-05-16 14:21:00,5010,Anything that goes in livewell won't need a booster just hot oil.lol.
6656710,Skywagon,2022-05-17 05:52:00,1106,"Don't discount how important your tourist $ are to the area. The government doesn't want any more flack from the the tourist industry than they have already been getting over the border restrictions and now attempting to bring in a high-level radioactive waste dump to the area. They have been trying to sugar coat this thing, the mayor of Ignace even said the dump would be a tourist attraction, (get in line and buy your tickets). Ask John, your input is important."

6656128,Eckohlt,2022-05-15 07:23:00,3685,Big arse mess by the looks of that much water.Dirty water
6656132,prov1800,2022-05-15 07:30:00,5010,Wabigoon Lake is like that all year.Then comes toward Clay Lake which is also normally dirty and now dirtier with all the mud/clay being pick up on its 60 mi journey
6656136,Eckohlt,2022-05-15 07:34:00,3685,"Gonna have to snag the fish there,there eyes are going to be alittle cloudy."
