Today with some doing I got my boat out of my backyard and that was a messy situation but it's out on dry ground.The bad is for a lot of camps having dock problems as water is way beyond the docks up on shore and have caused damage to some.Many problems with flooding and wash outs so hope those problems ease up as we get travellers coming up next week.You will be amazed at the amount of water headed north.Fishing will be good but very different with the high water if you have never done it.was at Eagle Lake this morning and a bit of floating around still but that will be gone in couole of day.Just getting my boat ready and hope to get out Mon/teus for some lake trout.
