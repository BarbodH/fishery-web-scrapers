Can anyone provide tips on best areas, baits for this time of year. Interested in walleyes but pike or muskie would be welcome. I also need to obtain a map. Any recommendations on where to get a good one?"
509364,Guest,2000-08-03 09:46:00,0,"Early September walleyes on Lac Suel should still be on the late summer structure. Cox'x island in the main bay is a good place to start. Steamboat Bay along the north shore after you go through the narrows. Actually any island point or main shore point will hold walleyes. Some bigger fish may be migrating toward the entrance of Sancturary Bay. Worth a try, but if you start getting small fish, leave. McKenzie bay is good, but it's a little far. Also, McKenzie is huge and has a lot of islands and the W's can be harder to locate. Sawmill bay may also hold some fish. Any basic walleye presentation will catch fish. Baits are jig with minnows, spinners with minnows or crawlers. Crank baits generally can produce the trophys, but I found that they don't produce as many fish. As far as muskies go, the west side of the lake is not known for a large population of muskies. If you want muskie fishing go to the Lake of the Woods. Northerns are all over the place. I think that spending a day casting and trolling for the big critters is worth it. I've never had a huge northern, but I have caught many in the 15lbs range. They average 5 to 8 lbs. One thing I've learned about Lac Suel is that the weather always sucks. Be prepared. Of the 10 or so trips I've taken to Lac Suel we've always had at least one day that we couldn't get out. It's big water, and those waves can get dangerous, so practice safe seamanship. I was wondering where you are going to stay?TGG"
509365,Guest,2000-08-03 10:40:00,0,I think the resort is Timberline Lodge.
509366,TGG,2000-08-03 11:30:00,3,I've never stayed at Timberline. Most of the resorts on the westside are nice. Good Luck and Be Safe....
