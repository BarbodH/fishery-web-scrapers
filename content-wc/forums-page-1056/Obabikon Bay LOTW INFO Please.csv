DO you suggest reefs or points? What depth? Crawlers, leeches,or minnows and would you go with a jig or harness? Any information would be appreciated. Thanks"

Obabikon Lake has some great northern fishing. Any good structure, reefs, points, islands will produce. My go to bait would be a jig and a minnow but all of the other things you mentioned work well. Have a good trip."
