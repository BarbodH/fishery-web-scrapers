509348,Beeg,2000-08-01 10:39:00,9,Which area has has less fishing pressure on fly-ins? Should we stay with the bigger lakes for quality fishing? Any suggestions???
509349,Guest,2000-08-01 16:43:00,0,"We have flown out of Pickle lake to several awesome lakes; none of which have seen any fishing pressure and this year we were the third group in to a new camp. Next year we are trying a fly in out of Red lake that looks outstanding.I know there are lots of camps out of Nakina and Armstrong and am looking for feedback as you are. The areas of Chapleau, Wawa, and White River have a ton of camps and I would like to find a couple in this area as well. You can email me for the camps I have been to and am going to. I am looking forward to some responses in the areas east of Thunder Bay, when we dont have time for the two day hike to Pickle or Red lakes.Lobo"

509351,Guest,2000-08-02 05:58:00,0,"I would focus on Red Lake becasue the thats where the roads end. The lakes north of Red lake are virgin waters and produce trophy eyes, pike, and trout. I have been fishing the same place for 5 years in a row and the fishing is so good for 20lb plus pike and eyes up to 12lbs. that I don't see a need to go anywhere else. If it isn't broke don't fix it is what I live by. If you want more info. on the place I go to, feel free to e-mail me. Good luck and great fishing!!!"
509352,Guest,2000-08-03 07:34:00,0,I fish in the Red Lake area but on a drive in. Where do you go out on a fly-in?ThanksJeff
509353,Guest,2000-08-03 10:58:00,0,"Duffyd, Sir,I am pretty happy with our place 30' no. of Ignace--can take our own boat and with my 4x4 have a 22x8 mile lake to ourselves. The area around the lake is all owned by a paper co. Its not catch and release. Anyhow, I owe my sons a fly-in outing and your spot sounds just great. So, please tell me your thoughts. Thanks.
