On Aug 11, we will be puting in at Kipawa, heading north 9 miles, east past Corbeau Lodge another 7-8 miles to get back onto Hunter Lake. Third year going there...have enjoyed greatly. Know of another group just there last week...done quite well in an area known as Echo Bay...white jig head with chartruse body and half a worm seemed to produce the most fish. Water runs as deep as 230' in Hunter...half to be lots of trout although I'm there primarily for 'eyes. Cooler weather this year I'm told. Good Luck...be well!"
