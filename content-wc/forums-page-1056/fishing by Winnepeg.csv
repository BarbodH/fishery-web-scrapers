For Walleye the Lake of the Woods 2.5 hours east, Lake Manitoba Narrows 2 hours north, Whiteshell area 1.5 hours ENE and if you are interested in Channel Cats averaging 20-30 lbs. go 30 minutes north on the Red River at Selkirk. Both the Red and Assiniboine Rivers flow through Winnipeg and also contain lots of Channel Cats although the average size is only around 10 lbs. or less. The Assinboine from where it enters the Red for about a mile upstream is probably the best bet and also has some Walleye and Sauger. It can be fished from shore but a boat would make things much better. Take bug dope, Winnipeg is being eaten alive by mosquitos this summer."

For a tackle shop visit the ""Fishing Hole"" on Main Street, they'll tell you good places to fish, you can go past Selkirk and hit Netley Creek which enters the RED. In Selkirk there's a tackle shop ""Outfitters"" past MacDonaldsIf you're bringing a boat, launch at Selkirk, you could launch at ""Cats on the Red"" at the locks at Lockport, but the current may make it difficult, besides the locks are about 15 min from SelkirkLots of great fishing here just be patient and enjoy yourself. Netley has a boat launch also.I know you want to try for walleyes, and the Red has some monsters in it, but try for catfish just for the heck of it, you'll be surprised."
