The water is crystal clear so sunny daytime fishing will have to be done deep or way back in the weeds. Walleye have really come back the last few years especially in the Shawanaga River area a couple of miles up the channel, you have to go deep for them until late evening. Bass fishing, both large and smallmouth are present, can go from incredible to impossible. When it gets tough, fish for largemouth and pike the in the weed edges and weed/boulder combos with a spinnerbait tipped with a chub or small perch (perch are legal as bait in the great lakes). I have been fishing the area for years, if a cold front comes in take a ride to town or check out my little boy's favorite Science North in Sudbury.Hope this helps."
