509198,cranker',2000-07-21 09:10:00,41,A good friend of mine is heading up to Eagle Lake next week and I was wondering how the fishing's been lately. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Looking for smallmouth & walleye action mostly.

Seems strange as we have experienced an improvement on the lake where our cabin is..since 1959. The efforts over the last few years have paid off. Did they not make the same effort on Eagle?"
