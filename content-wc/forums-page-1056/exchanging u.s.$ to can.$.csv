509336,Guest,2000-07-31 16:30:00,0,is it worth exchanging us dollars to canadian dollars?? if so how and where can it be done??
509337,Guest,2000-07-31 18:00:00,0,"IF you take US $ in, the exchange rate varies widely from merchant to merchant. The best bet is to buy Canadian travelers checks or else use a credit card wherever possible. either of these options only takes a percent or two from the ""real "" exchange rate. Some merchants may take a 6 to 8 percent cut from the exchange rate.If you're going to be spending several hundred $, it's probably worth the extra effort."
509338,DaveIN,2000-08-01 13:07:00,191,Many US banks keep Canadian money that you can exchange before you leave home.I usually get a couple of hundred exchanged for gas and food purchases before we go.
509339,GregK,2000-08-01 15:33:00,113,"I always find it convient to change money once at the border. It saves a lot of time and confusion for buying gas, groceries, bait, etc. You can get favorable rates at the Ontario tourist office in Ft. Francis. You will be looking right at it when you cross the bridge. As the other guys said, all the merchants get to vote on the exchange when you do business with them."
509340,Guest,2000-08-01 19:58:00,0,"I always exchange money at a bank in Sioux Narrows,Ontario, Canada. They give me a fair exchange rate and it make it so much easier to buy when you have canadian in hand. I think you get a fairer deal with merchants if you use canadian money to buy. I have been to certain merchants and they add if you use a credit card. Be careful about exchanges at the border, I have been ""ripped off"" with their exchange rates..."
509341,RANGER,2000-08-02 09:32:00,4341,"I have been to Canada more times than I care to say. I always exchange several hundred dollars when I go. It makes life sooooo much easier when you're there.I exchange at one of the natioanl banks in the nearest city I can find after crossing the border. You'll get the BEST rate that can be made, no hidden surcharges. Doing a little math you can figure your expense needs so when you return there is very little, if at all any, Canadian monies to re-exchange. One way I get rid of all the leftover money is to fill my tank with the exact amonut of money I have left, to the penny.RANGER"
