1060458,Guest,2008-10-15 07:08:00,0,"I've been looking for a trip next August for some musky and walleye fishing. I was wondering if anyone has had any experience w/ Moosehorn Lodge by Sioux Lookout before. I've heard it's pretty close to Lac Seul for good musky fishing, and that the walleye fishing is also pretty good there. Any information would be appreciated. Thanks."
