1056988,mrwalleye5,2008-09-23 20:04:00,1922,Nothing changes. Fished Nipawin lots in the mid 90's. Long snelled lindy rigs with leeches and cranks. Longs snelled bottom bouncers and leeches did the trick also. W5
1057397,Guest,2008-09-25 17:48:00,0,Fishing was great lots of fish and some big ones last few days. 81 cm was the biggest we caught it right in the mouth.LOL.But the bite is on big time. Not in the derby but it will be great fishing . Best have big bait cause the stuff up there is SAD. Some big ones coming at the Dam at night seen a 84cm 15.7 lb brute heading to get mounted. Nice eye.
1060344,uzzi,2008-10-14 11:51:00,349,"I'm hoping that fish was actually over 86cm, because thats the slot.......55-86 cm goes back in!"
1055540,laker taker2,2008-09-16 09:55:00,28,"anyone fished the river in the last week or so? Heading up this Saturday, Sunday and Monday hoping to see the ""fat girls"" have arrived at the dance! I have been paying more attention to my big leeches for the last month than my kid in anticipation of this outing!"
1055556,Dave Q,2008-09-16 10:33:00,1003,Hi Im just 3hrs away from the nip and can tell you 100% for sure the river(and lake) but mostlly the river turn on and off like a light switch. We just go and ya get what ya get. But this is a good time of year.
1055658,laker taker2,2008-09-16 18:38:00,28,"I know that river is funny sometimes that way. Must be current related. With the full moon last night, stable weather on the horizon and cool nights the odds seem to be good.........I sure hope the fish co-operate with my short window and my 10 hr drive from Calgary! I spend most of my time between the first weed bed past the launch and eagles nest. Anything further to the lake mouth I'm missing out on? My Navionics chip starts to show break lines at eagles nest but I'm to time challenged to spend hours in dead water this year. I know guys fish the power dam at night as well, but I'm not that hard core yet."
1055768,Dave Q,2008-09-17 08:12:00,1003,"sounds like you got it coverd. we fish the same area's as do 90%. of ppl. trolling and rigging is almost imposable in a lot of the lake ...to much wood. hec a guys gets snags ancored and jigging in the lake lol. best of luck. oh and we also do not fish the dam, crazy enough in the day yet alone at night."
1055907,Gooch88,2008-09-17 19:00:00,58,"I was there last weekend doing some pre pre-fishing for the Vanity Cup and well the ""fat Girls"" didn't want to eat. I marked big fish in the flats just around the corner from Twin Marina (east) just past the bridge...speaking of the bridge I had one big girl (11lbs) hit me right beside the pillars of the bridge. There were 20 or so boats on the water and we were one of the only boats hittin ( lots got ZERO) so it's bound to have gotten better since last weekened. Bottom bouncers, 6 foot snells, small blades and worms worked best. You could try rigging with your leeches but they should be just horny enough to start hitting faster more aggresive presentations."
1056499,Guest,2008-09-21 09:49:00,0,Gooch 88 never been there. want to go. How heavy are the bouncers and do you go with or into the current. Any other tips would be great.
1056546,Gooch88,2008-09-21 17:10:00,58,"I use a 2 ounce bb. I usually run my Terrova at min speed running with the current. You will be running around 1.5 to 1.8 MPH that way. Spinners rigs with ""slow death"" worm hooks and crawlers worked really well. Jigs with buzz bombers in the deeper holes work really well, as well try jigging around the pillars just down from Twin Marina 25 feet there and can be a goog spot for big eyes. Good luck, that place can make you feel frustrated or on top of the world. Good fall bite should be on now."
1056686,Guest,2008-09-22 14:14:00,0,Do you try any blades and where do you get those hooks.Short snells ?
1056742,Gooch88,2008-09-22 18:17:00,58,"you can get the hooks from Cabela's or your local shop(s) should have them. They are usually labeled ""slow death"" most of the hook mfgs make them...so there is a selection out there. As for blades & snells I use the various shapes of blades but thend to stick to ones with orange, yellow and green in them and will run 4 foot to 10 foot long snells, 75% of the time it's as long as the rod I am using. Good Luck"
1056926,laker taker2,2008-09-23 16:29:00,28,"just got back from Nipawin. Weather was good, fishing is SLOW! We only managaed two 6lbers in 2 full days plus a few smaller ones. Lots of boats got skunked! It is nasty. If the bite doesn't turn on soon, the vanity will loose some steam for sure. My partner did boat a 51 inch sturgeon with a 25 inch girth though. Fought it for half an hour on a light rod with 6 lb test. 49lbs is what the online table says. Lots of fun on an otherwise poor outing. Anyone reading this that is fishing the vanity, take leeches! The ones they are selling there look like black maggots. Hope it gets better. No luck with slow death rigs, long snell leech rigs or cranks!"
