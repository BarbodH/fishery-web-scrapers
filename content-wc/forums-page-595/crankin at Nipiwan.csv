1056767,stingernd,2008-09-22 19:41:00,25,I am fishing the river in mid Oct for the first time. Does anyone have any tips on what cranks have worked for them in the past? Thanks for your help.

1056913,stingernd,2008-09-23 15:38:00,25,Thanks uzzi! I know my ?'s are poorly timed with the vanity around the corner. Thought I'd try!

I'm heading up there tomorrow night, with a group of 12 guys, 4 boats, hopefully the bite will pick up, I'm expecting a number of boats on the river doing prefishing as well, hoping that sometime this weekend the system will ""light up"" and the piggies will start to bite. Last year the bite on Vanity weekend was unreal. We're only about a week away from that now too. Hering the bite is still slow"
