1060577,SinOrSwim,2008-10-15 20:31:00,1528,"We use Slate Falls Outposts out of Sioux Lookout. I would highly recommend them for many reasons. First, we don't have weight limits. In addition, his facilities are top notch. Fishing is very very good as well. Sometimes it's the small things that make a difference and he makes sure all that is taken care of."
1056011,Guest,2008-09-18 09:26:00,0,Just curious what others pay their outfitter per case (24 bottles) of Blue flown in to camp ahead of time?
1056028,jigman 2003,2008-09-18 10:16:00,981,I think ours was around $40 this year.
1056044,deputy dog,2008-09-18 11:17:00,305,"the new outfitter at our lake all but did away with weight limits this year so we could take what we wanted, thank goodness because it was always a hassel, one year we had to fork out $500 for an extra flight for the rest of our gear and he flew in supplies for the camp on our flight that we paid for! thank god for the new owner!"
1056071,Crede,2008-09-18 13:59:00,134,$44
1056072,phishfearme,2008-09-18 14:05:00,1242,24 cans of Blue was 40.00. Labatts Genuine Draft was 30.00
1056637,Jig Man,2008-09-22 09:53:00,95,Most outfitters that I have used will not fly in bottles for you do to the extra weight and I would assume possible breakage. This year we paid $58 for Blue. Last Year with a different outfitter it was $75/case and that trip involved a double flight to get us to the lake.
1056805,SinOrSwim,2008-09-23 04:57:00,1528,"We bring our own over the border and then pay the duty when we get to the border. We used to buy it up there but then we have to re-pack the trailer etc. Easier.We take A LOT of beer and do not pay extra to fly it in. They are always making a couple flights whether it be that morning, later that day or even on our check flight. But, we don't have weight restrictions. This, along with the very well maintained cabins and equipment are a big reason we stay with our outfitter.Heck, if you find a place you like, negotiate with them. If they want your business try to come to an agreement."
1057033,Guest,2008-09-24 05:49:00,0,"Our outfitter allows 150 lbs/person and charges $1.00 U.S./lb. for overweight. With advance notice, he will fly in our order so it does not count as part of our weight allowance. This year he charged us $48 U.S./case (24 bottles). I think some mark up is reasonable, but this price prompted to post my inquiry as to what others pay."
1058174,Hammerhead Herb,2008-09-30 22:16:00,259,"Our outfitter charges $44.50 per case of Blue. Never had a problem with weight even though each case weighs about 19#. However, keep in mind that they also keep the return deposit monies (which I don't mind)."
