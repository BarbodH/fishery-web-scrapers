1058418,Golden Eagle,2008-10-01 20:05:00,2642,I've fished the Cobham River Outpost several times. What do you want to know?
1058528,Jig Man,2008-10-02 10:35:00,95,"I used them in 2006 and would not use them again. Vee lake was ok but outfitters themselves were the most unfriendly, disrespectfull peaople I have ever used. Do a search and see previous posts."
1058543,Guest,2008-10-02 11:48:00,0,"thanks for the reply.just wondering about general conditions of camp,boats and motors,service and of course fishing.we are planning a trip to findlay lake in june 2009.have done many fly ins out of nakina,armstrong and pickle lake and wanting to look at some new areas.many thanks again,tim jias"
1058544,Golden Eagle,2008-10-02 12:01:00,2642,"I fished Cobham while Brett Geary owned the outpost. It was fine then, but don't want to speak about the new owners. I know the price is lots higher now. Don't believe many outfitters are making a profit these days when long flights are involved. My last trip was for 14 days in August 2005. Everything was in good shape then and fishing was great."

1058642,phishfearme,2008-10-03 08:05:00,1242,"i think there's two canadian flyin fishing businesses - one in red lake - http://www.canadianflyinfishing.net/ and one that used to be in ear falls but looks like now they're in red lake - http://www.canadianflyinfishing.com/ -- jigman and i had this confusion before. tim - the one you're going with used to be in ear fall as they have findlay lake outpost - they also have vee lake and the cobham river. the other one in red lake has a totally different group of lakes. also the one that used to be in ear falls is a combination of lac seul airways and amik outposts. we did an 11 day trip to their springpole lake and had a very nice trip - they actually gave us an extra day since nobody was coming in after us. their northern camps though are just too expensive for our tastes but i think you'll get what you pay for with them. kinda surprised to hear that jigman had a less then excellent trip with them. they are clearly the high price spread and are not afraid to say so. we looked into loree and shearstone (we had spent 10 days portaging into shearstone from the lake below before they built the cabin there and the fishing was incredible) but the prices were just way too high. do a search on springpole and you should be able to find some of my posts. best of luck, phish"
