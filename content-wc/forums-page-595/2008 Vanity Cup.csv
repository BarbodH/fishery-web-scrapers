This year is the 15th annual I believe. 160 boat limit at $1000 per boat (and there is a waiting list), 1st place is $50,000 cash, 2nd is a Lund ProV package. Checkout the website www.vanitycup.ca Have always wanted to fish in it, maybe someday.........."

Amazingly....we weighed in 2 fish around 12lbs., and all perfect 21.5"" slots and didn't win! I look forward to fishing it again sometime. Jim Chute should be proud of the Vanity Cup history.

There were a lot of boats floating around with not much going on. We caught 3 over 8 1/2 lbs but overall was not a success. Weather has gotten nice again, hopefully things pick up for those guys. There were many teams putting in a week of prefishing! Must be nice."

I was reading some reports over at sloughshark.net that said the fishing is picking up, apparently they cover the vanity. From what i read fishing is getting better at night (i guess not much help to the tourney guys) on crankbaits up on the flats. During the day like most here have said live bait rigs and leeches or bouncers and spinners. Apparently right on the channel edge is good. Not sure how much this helpsm maybe i'll have to get up there myself."
1059764,Guest,2008-10-09 20:58:00,0,just read the winning weight was 62 pounds. Not bad for 2 days walleye fishing. Must havehad some hogs to win the 50 000.
