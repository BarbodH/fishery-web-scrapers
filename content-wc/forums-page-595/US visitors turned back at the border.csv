1055272,Backwater Eddy,2008-09-15 03:23:00,3871,"If we turned back everyone headed to the US from up North with any and all Drug offenses..I wonder how that would empress the various agencies and entity's in Canada?Overall they are much more lenient on drug offenses (What would be a felony drug offense there often gets a pass to a lesser charge), and much like our USA/CA DUI felony situation, it would soon raise some hackles in the Canadian government.Don't get me wrong, I am not against tough DUI laws...just not certain if the ban is reasonable as it stands now. Why should someone who is not even driving but has an old DUI get turned away? As the felony ruling is applied to this as well.FYI: In full disclosure, I have had DUI's in my younger days, and have not drank now by the grace of God, for over 15 years. I had to jump through some hoops with the border crossing officials to regain permission to enter even after 10 years. But once that frustrating process was completed I have had no further complications with it today, and I visit Canada often."
1056653,Guest,2008-09-22 11:32:00,0,"I find it interesting that Americans want us Cdns to loosen our laws, but meanwhile us Canadians are having all sorts of travel hurdles imposed on us because of the USA. Case in point ........ Passports to cross the border into USA by car coming very soon. This is a major pain in the butt for rural Cdn's to obtain, and requires either us driving to 600 miles to Toronto or Thunderbay to get to a passport office , or risk mailing our original documents and waiting a few months for return of same........etc etc. But if we want to shop across the border, we need to get passports ( I live in border town Soo) But those that want to visit the USA jump thru these hurdles.... this because Americans are afraid of terrorists. So everyday we have 70 year old greyhaired women and business people like me, taking our shoes off in Canadian airports, and packing tiny bottles of hairspray and no nose clippers ! We might stab a pilot with. But everyone , whether they are wearing a turban or wearing support hose , must adhere to the rules to keep the USA safe. Even though I don't live in the USA. So then why should you expect Canadians to not be able to have their rules to keep them safe from felons ? From other countries ? I am quite certain your USA rules dramatically have effected your tourist dollars, but your country chose to take that hit to prevent other ""hits"" So Canada also makes those choices too. Just a other side of the border point of view. jake"
1056730,Guest,2008-09-22 17:39:00,0,"Jake, You make a good point. However, it's a tit for tat point. I think it's stupid that you can't bring nose clippers on a plane... or you can't bring tube of toothpaste because it could be terrorist plot. Most US citizens agree that these are silly rules. The passport one is a rule that I hope never actually happens. (but I fear it will) Anyhow, my point is... one countries stupid rules isn't really an excuse for another country to make it more difficult to come in. I would guess that many tourism locations in the US adamantly oppose some of the new ""rules""... Also, I'm a Canadian citizen..."
1057519,Flip Silverlake,2008-09-26 11:14:00,645,"I'm a not Canadian, but have been able to position my self to be able to enjoy most of the summer on Lake of The Woods. That being said I get to see a lot of stuff. This year for example four fellow Americans came into camp and were complaining about this very issue, in that some in the party had to pay the $ 260.00 fee ( not sure if thats the amount) becasue of a DUI on their driving record. Now you would have thought they would have been very careful when it came to drinking and operating a ""motor vehicle"". That didn't seem to be the case because for the week they were in Canada they would fill a cooler with ice and beer. So much beer that when the group would return to camp in the evening it was nearly impossable for them to get out of their boat. In fact one evening there had to be a mini rescue because one ended up in the water between the boat and the dock in 15 feet of water. It must not have bothered him much becasue he never changed clothes after his little bath. Drinking is not the problem. To much drinking is. I support the Canadain position when it comes to trying to reduce deaths involving operating while intoxicated. It seams that old habits are hard to break. Here in Wisconsin there are reports of deaths cause by someone driving drunk or stoned on drugs and the person that caused the death has 3,4,5 or more convections on his record. I guess if fishing or hunting in Canada is important to you may be you need to contorl the things that would stop that activity. I'm not a big fan of sitting in a boat and have someone who is loaded heading at me at 80mph in a scream and fly bass boat or even someone in a 16 ft with a 20 on the back. The results are the same. You want to drink stay home it a whole lot cheaper."
1057638,stumcfar,2008-09-27 08:25:00,451,"I do not have a problem with Canadians making it difficult for Americans with DUI's. I do find it a little humerous though that a DUI felon is not as bad to the Canadian officials if he pays the fee and gets his paperwork. Are we worried about the DUI or do we want to make a little money, I am a little confused there. Terrorism is a reality of our world. Some rules seem ridiculous, but I want to be as safe as possible when I get on an airplane and I don't want illegals driving through our borders. I do realize the border is pretty porous and most people who are up to something illegal probably will find a place to sneak across. Bottom line, get a passport, it just makes travel easier. It is not the Americans fault that Canada doesn't have offices more convenient for their citizens to get Passports. I travel to Canada to fish 25-30 times a year, have the right paperwork, live with the rules and regulations and everything goes fine."
1057897,lenray,2008-09-29 08:43:00,467,Here is what I saw this year at the border. In May two of us in a truck with boat and trailer. Gave the guard our driver's lic. they held them and asked a few questions and handed them back--no computer check. Last week same deal this time four of us. We had our info. in hand ready to hand over. Were asked the regular questions and then told to have a good time in Canada. Never took our info. lic. etc. A good guard has the good sence to tell a lot about who is coming in. It was a very good experience for us. We had nothing to hide--it was a good feeling to see how we were treated. Coming back we had to show everything and that was ok also.
1059265,Guest,2008-10-07 10:52:00,0,Americans view impaired driving or DUI in a much different way than Canadians do. Americans also have 2-3 times the per capita conviction rate than Canada and have states that allow driving to .10. This is a common thread here about the lost economic thing and Buddy can't come. Bottom line this is Canada and we make the rules. Don't like it stay home. Americans have a long history of the mightier than though attitude and feeling they are doing us a favour by coming here to Canada and then making up their own rules as they go along. The conviction rates for fisheries violations show that.
1059270,Golden Eagle,2008-10-07 11:17:00,2642,"""Cadadian"" Guy, you're using a pretty broad brush to paint me with and you don't know me. Thanks for participating in the thread."
1059622,Guest,2008-10-09 08:54:00,0,"It's interesting to see the remarks about Canadian LOTW resorts getting very little business from Canadians. The place that we were at last year must have been invaded by Americans that someone got Manitoba license plates for the vehicles and Manitoba registrations for their boats. Way, way more Manitobanians than Americans."
1059628,v-bay gord,2008-10-09 09:15:00,3168,"Like I mentioned earlier.....it is a self fullfilling prophecy if you go into it with the attitude that it is impossible to attract Canadian guests. Obviously some have had a more aggressive marketing strategy that targets Canadians than Obabikon. Sending out information with your rates in U.S. dollars is a sure way to turn off prospective Canadian buyers. Only marketing in the U.S. is a sure way to by-pass this market. Maybe it will never fill up camps in NW Ontario, but if it picks up the slack from the declining US traveller, well that is a win-win situation."
1059648,Obabikon,2008-10-09 11:15:00,2370,"Was this offensive? I did not mean it to be at all, if you found it so, I appologize. As tourist destinations, they made the most sense to me. Anyhow... I would agree that the Kenora area probably has a lot more Manitoba guests. My area (Morson), is nearly impossible to get to from Manitoba. Unless you cross the border twice each way, or you boat all the way across the lake. If you don't mind, which camp did you go to? I'd be interested in looking into how they do things, and where they do their promotions. V-Bay... you're right that if you don't try, it won't happen. However, my point is just that the pie is much smaller on the Canadian side. NWOntario is a HUGE area, and for those resorts close to the border, it's increasingly difficult to attract Canadian guests. As I've said several times, Canadians don't head South. My resort doesn't target Canadians because it would be next to impossible for us to fill the camp that way. It is not because I neglect or fail to acknowledge Canadians. I definately don't shun them from coming."
1059668,stumcfar,2008-10-09 13:01:00,451,"No one has still answered my question and no I have never had a DUI nor has anyone in my fishing party. Why does filling out some paperwork and paying a fee make a US felon DUI'er less of a felon and then can be welcomed into Canada. By reading this thread, one is to beleve that every past American with a DUI will automatically drive drunk in Canada, but evidently not if they pay a fee. I am a little confused on this one???"
1059678,Obabikon,2008-10-09 13:49:00,2370,"Your question is rhetorical, and those typically aren't going to get answered. How does paying a speeding ticket make you less likely to speed? It doesn't, but it allows the government to capitalize... It also sends the message that Canada takes DUI's very seriously, and it would behove someone not to operate a motorized vehicle while impared."
1059694,v-bay gord,2008-10-09 14:54:00,3168,"[QUOTE=stumcfar;1059668] Why does filling out some paperwork and paying a fee make a US felon DUI'er less of a felon and then can be welcomed into Canada. QUOTE] I'm no expert, nor do I agree with throwing up barriers to people who pose no threat, but I would say the purpose of the paper work is to do a more detailed background check. If there are no hidden skeletons discovered then permission can be given to enter the country. I suppose the cost is compensation for some government official to read the paperwork, do any follow-up and make the decision. Might be reasonable if it was applied consistently across the border, which it isn't, and if the goal was to mitigate a threat. Somebody with a couple dui's going on a fishing trip is not a threat."
1059317,Guest,2008-10-07 16:18:00,0,We all depend on each other American Guy. Thats the spirit of team work and cooperation. Tourism will be very tough in the next years on both sides. Many Minnesota and Wisconsin outfitters rely on Canadian tourism as well and the passport thing will effect them as well. Americans I understand will require a passport as well to enter their own country. This will by far make the largest impact. The only winners in this whole thing is guys like me who live here and fish extensively. Little competition means more fish for me.
1059327,Obabikon,2008-10-07 18:12:00,2370,"I've been sucked back in this thing... lol. Canadian Guy, almost ZERO Minnesota/Wisconsin resorts rely on Canadian tourism. Canadians, for the most part, fish Canadian waters. The fisheries are stronger, the fish are bigger. You almost never have people go South to fish... unless they go WAY south to Mexico/Texas/Florida... or even fish the Mississippi. As a Canadian run resort, I have had zero Canadians in two years. I had one family book and cancel in my two seasons. NONE of the resorts on Lake of the Woods rely on Canadian Tourism. Almost all of the camps are 100% US tourism (not just 80 or 90... but much closer to 99-100% US). Canadians around Toronto (and other high population areas) fish lakes close by. Why drive 12 hours south to fish a lake that isn't any better than the one 30minutes away? ""Bottom line this is Canada and we make the rules. Don't like it stay home."" Tell that to all the Canadians out of work and the many resorts that have been shut down the past few years. I agree that in Canada, our rules are ours... Americans and others should follow them. The only thing I would suggest, is to get creative so that the economy near the border isn't completely crushed."
1059335,JAY221,2008-10-07 19:03:00,877,"Obabikon, I believe you have a very good grasp of reality, at least as far as this subject goes. But, I am here to tell you that you can not get through to some people that don't begin to understand the issues. Canadian Guy, If you are worried about being able to catch fish on a canadian lake I have to question your ability!! I for one am done with this subject as the powers that be will do what they want no matter who it hurts or what we say. Later, Jay"
1059590,v-bay gord,2008-10-09 07:01:00,3168,"Obabikon brings up the point that there are no resorts on Lake of the Woods that rely on Canadian tourism. Is this a self fullfilling prophesy? Traditionally resorts in this neck of the woods have been owned by Americans, marketing has been directed primarily at Americans, prices have been in American dollars, and the camps have been full of Americans. Basically the Canadian market has been ignored. With the issues revolving around the border, exchange rates, etc. there is an opportunity that is being overlooked, but it takes a change in attitudes."
1059596,Guest,2008-10-09 07:15:00,0,I guess I'll be more specific. American retailers and hotels rely heavilly on Canadian tourism. I am bombarded steasilly with shop Minnesota.com. We go regular to the states for shopping and holidays and on Canadian holidays there is no room at the Americans inns because of this influx. . Lots or if not most boat and snowmachine purchases are in the states because of choice and volume. Canadians have been ignored at resorts in the good years when your exchange rate was favourable. A lot of Canadians have been shunned in their own country especially with the practice of accepting US dollars for payment. I wonder if this is still common. Marketing to Canadians makes a lot of sense. We all want to move forward and grow.
1059599,Obabikon,2008-10-09 07:29:00,2370,"Actually, I know several Canadian owners on LOTW's. There's a ton of them. They all market in the United States. There isn't a Canadian market that's capable of sustaining a resort. The area around LOTW's is not well populated... (in terms of available tourism). Even if it were, those are usually one day trips... http://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&tab=wl If you would... take a look at that google map. Zoom in on Ontario. There's a million lakes that provide great fishing for all species of fish. People from ""cities"" in Ontario, fish areas right next to their homes. They don't drive 5+ hours to fish areas that look exactly the same and have the exact same type of fish. I say 5+ hours... because that's the nearest Ontario city to me. (Thunder Bay) While I would love to be able to market to fellow Canadian Citizens... it isn't realistic nor profitable."
1059603,Obabikon,2008-10-09 07:45:00,2370,"It's never been an issue of ""exchange rate"". The US citizens enjoyed the exchange rate, but it didn't affect the resorts. We charge in US for convenience of our guests. If I have a Canadian guest some day, I will happily charge in Canadian. (simply using the exchange rate, I'll get the same amount of money) If I get a pound of small apples from one guy, and a pound of big apples from another guy... I don't care about the number I received, I got a pound either way. All resorts do their banking in Canada. So, it's not an issue accepting Canadian checks/money. They just have to know the exchange rate (or set their own). Marketing to Canadians would make a lot of sense... if Canadians spent money at fishing resorts. They do not... so it does not. I'm not trying to argue with you, I'm just telling you this is how it is. From the eyes of a Canadian that owns a Canadian resort... you can't survive on Canadian tourists. It's like Mexico saying they need to market to only Mexicans. Or Disney Land saying they need to market to Floridians.... there's no money doing that. Mexicans don't go to San Juan for vacation... everyone else does."
1059609,v-bay gord,2008-10-09 07:59:00,3168,"There are over half a million people about four hours driving time from Lake of the Woods.....and they don't have to cross ""the border"". Isn't that a Canadian market? You can't compare the ""product"" that is offerred in the north west to what is offerred in the north east. The quality of our fishing and overall experience is much, much better. I don't think tourism is doing what it could to let them know the difference."
1059617,Obabikon,2008-10-09 08:21:00,2370,"No... half a million people is not a market at all. That's almost nothing. Chicago, Minneapolis, Omaha, Toronto... cities that have several million people are good markets. 500,000 isn't enough to fill one camp for a season... (apx. 500 people) Secondly, I'm not saying that the fishing is great everywhere... I'm saying that the ""marketable areas"" have great fishing closer by. Let's use Lac Seul as an example. Anyone who does a little research knows Lac Seul's one of the best lakes in the world for Walleye fishing. So... if you had an option of driving 4 hours to Lac Seul or 5 hours to Lake of the Woods... it's a no brainer. Anyone in the Dryden area... it's even worse. It's a great idea, and would be awesome if it were doable. But, it just isn't possible."
1059618,Guest,2008-10-09 08:23:00,0,I agree that marketing to Canadians would be a good idea. The least that could be done is a survey for market in the area. There is a lot of money available from our government for this type of thing. I would be interested igf this has ever been done. I have sat at OMNR meetings where Canadians were classified as tin boat owners with cases of beer. This comment was by a resort owner in NW Ontario. Resrt owners are in a hard sell these days and the impact is felt across the board. Moving forward and using the resources available is good for everyone. Obabikon I understand the intent of the Mexican and Florida example but you could use different examples.
1059286,dutchboy,2008-10-07 12:49:00,5717,"While his response may be a little rough around the edges he does make a valid point. When in Rome do as the Romans do. Canada has the right to make and enforce the rules as they see fit. I have no problem with that. We do the same thing in the States. I believe the intent of the original post was he wanted consistency at the border crossings. His feeling (hope i'm right here) was that business was being hurt in Canada because of the DUI violations being stopped at the border. I agree with the one poster who suggested those with a prior conviction have to sign off stating they won't operate a motor vehicle in Canada, even a boat motor. Where I disagree is if they violate that agreement then lock them up. Fines are a great deterrent for those who can't afford to pay them but do little to those who may be flush with cash. I believe past mistakes are just that.........past mistakes, and should be treated as such. However as guests in their country we must expect to have to follow their rules."
1059292,Guest,2008-10-07 13:44:00,0,"Canadian Guy has always had a chip on his shoulder about Americans. He stereotypes them all into the same group and then claims his moral superiority. You'd think he'd grow up eventually. And I doubt that he speaks for all Canadians when he says tells us to stay home. Thousands of his countrymen depend on US tourists/fishermen for a living and they are the ones being affected by the border policies. But in any case, the state of the US economy will put more Canadians out of work than the border policies. Many outfitters are hurting this year and next year will be worse."
1053824,King Canada,2008-09-07 16:48:00,27,I've been sober for 27 years. I visit Canada as often as I can. I have had conversations with several Lodge owners ( Canadian Citizens) who have actively lobbied to have this rule modified as it effects their business. I could care less for myself as the odds of me getting a DUI are pretty slim but there seems to be a real crisis in the areas I visit concerning the future viability of the Tourism Industry. As volume of clients drop the resorts have to raise their rates even more.
1053826,Guest,2008-09-07 17:03:00,0,"Oba, I give up, no mass....your even a better speller. Good luck, your gonna need it!"

1053835,2746,2008-09-07 17:54:00,3206,"An interesting debate that, as an American, I've not thought about. While it does not affect me,(I don't drink) it would be interesting to know how many non-Canadians are involved in drunk driving arrests in Canada and then, how many that came to Canada from their home country with DUI's. I would suspect the number to be almost nil. I can understand the Canandian's desire to control the potential problem, given their admirable fight against drunk driving, but it sounds like they may be accomplishing little at a very high cost to their own economy. (we do things like that here in the States as well!) While I have no sympathy for a drunk driver an automatic reprieve after two or three years might make sense."

Why not just charge a 200.00 fee @ the border & have you sign off that you won't drive anything while in Canada if you have a DUI? If you are caught doing it it is a huge fine $5,000-10,000?? & it is in black & white on the forms you sign. I know a lot of guys that would pay the extra 200.00 & stand by what they signed to come up & fish. Later, Jay"
1053869,Guest,2008-09-07 20:54:00,0,A DUI and you are classing them with rapists and sex offenders. Every one knows drinking and driving is wrong. Lots of us are not perfect. Few of us get rabid over a 10 yr old mistake. What is it that is REALLY making you so angry?
1053981,rpieske,2008-09-08 12:24:00,1276,"Real Mad: As others could tell you, I have been a defender of the Canadian point of view on alcohol related offenses. However, there is much to be said about the capricious manner in which the border crossings have been enforced. At some crossings, people with offenses that happened 20 years ago are still turned away, even though the law says they are deemed rehabilitated ten years after the completion of their sentence without any subsequent offenses. Obabikon is certainly entitled to discuss what has become a divisive issue with American tourists. Discussion is to be valued....name calling and insulting don't help your argument at all. I, too, have quoted the statistics on drunk driving deaths in the USA when discussing this issue on this and other boards. The way you conduct yourself impacts the way folks view the issues. Why not argue the facts instead of attacking people?"

From 2002-2006 these are the costs of turning away people at the border. (DUI's being the primary reason) NORTHWEST ONTARIO Reported Loss - ($10,740,811) Economic Activity - ($7,213,601) Labour - ($3,505,122) Full-Year Jobs - (113) Direct Taxes - ($2,989,138) Total Taxes - ($3,900,671) THE REST OF ONTARIO Economic Activity - ($3,315,061) Labour - ($2,307,402) Full-Year Jobs - (58) Direct Taxes - ($773,863) Total Taxes - ($1,680,696) I'm not sure how accurate these numbers are, however, it really shows what kind of damage the difficult border causes. These numbers do not include people who just did not come up because of the law. It seems to be strictly for people turned away at the border. It's one of those issues where a lot of people from different areas of Ontario are making decisions that dramatically affect only one area of Ontario. An area that most of them have probably never visited... lol. (just being the Devil's Advocate with all this, take it for what it's worth)"
1053738,Guest,2008-09-07 08:46:00,0,"Lets talk about real damage. 3 to 4 deaths per day in Canada, related to drunk drivers. In 2005, it was estimated that 3,226 individuals were killed in motor vehicle crashes in Canada. MADD Canada estimates that at a minimum 1,210 of these fatalities involved impaired driving. Moreover, in MADD Canada's opinion, the 1,210 figure is a conservative estimate, due to the underreporting that results from the inability to test surviving impaired drivers and reliance on police reports. As well, the 1,210 fatalities do not include individuals killed in impaired crashes on the waterways. In 2002, it was reported that there were 167 water-related deaths involving alcohol (many of these may not be included in the 1,210 number). Given the limits on the 1,210 fatalities figure, and adding in water-related deaths, MADD Canada estimates there are somewhere between 1,280 and 1,500 impaired crash fatalities in Canada each year (3.5-4.1 deaths per day)."
1053763,Obabikon,2008-09-07 10:18:00,2370,"How many of those deaths involve US citizens operating a vehicle while impared? Drunken driving is a serious problem all over. I in no way feel sorry for the people turned away at the border. However, I do feel sorry for the 100's of people in NWOntario that can't find jobs. I also feel sorry for all the resorts that couldn't fill their camps, but 10 years ago were having to turn away guests because of overbooking. The stats weren't meant to show sympathy for drunken drivers. They were meant to show that the economic affect on NWO is VERY drastic. Not just some rule that people are complaining about."
1053783,Guest,2008-09-07 11:13:00,0,"So what are you saying here in your post and response? Do you want NWO to change the rule and let convicted DUI folks from the US in so that even more can die on Canadian roads? You know as well as I do, these people lack judgment and have complete disregard the safety of others. This is a serious problem and WE need to get these DUI people completely off the road, regardless of employment. You should be embarrassed that you even made the original post that advocates a change in a rule that has and will continue to save lives.......possibly yours.

But let's face it, there's doing your job and then there's doing your job ""with attitude"" just because you think your badge gives you the right to.What I'm getting at, does it seem that the Fort Frances crossing is less customer friendly than other places, say Baudette?"

I'm not ever going to advocate allowing drunken drivers (especially repeat drunken drivers) onto Candian roads. NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER!!!! However, to say there aren't alternative measures that can be taken to prevent this is idiotic. Removal of driver's licenses at the border, with the warning a mandatory 1 year jail sentance will be inforced if you're caught operating a motorized vehicle. Reduction of the years it stays on your record from 10 to 5. A friend of mine was dumb and got a DUI when he was 22. He's 30 now, married, with two little kids. He can't come. Do I think he's a threat to drink and drive in Canada (or the US for that matter)? Absolutely not. Or, change what has to be done to prove rehabilitation. Right now, it's a very difficult process. I believe an FBI background check has to be done. Along with a note from the arresting officer. What about changing that to actual proof of a rehabilitation program (as almost all DUI cases are forced to do)... with a minimum 5 years without a violation on the record. Anyhow, I'm just trying to suggest alternatives. Some way that would completely eliminate the possibility of the person drinking and driving/boating in Ontario, but at the same time, allow large groups to still come."

What are YOU taking that's clouding your moral compass? It is a fact that a DUI in Canada is a felony. This is law, regardless of how YOU see it. Hey I know, using your same logic, lets loosen up the rules to allow other felons like robbers, rapists and sex offenders to visit Canada in big groups. Heck, lets open up the US prisons and ship them to your lodge. We can work on it together, there has to be a better way to increase the traffic at your lodge. BTW: I didn't think that commercial interests were supposed to be on this board."
1053821,Obabikon,2008-09-07 16:35:00,2370,"I don't have ""elastic morels"". Morels are a type of mushroom... My morals are just fine, and I try to be an excellent Candian citizen. Thank you for the repeated insults though. Makes it easy not to take you very seriously. I know that DUI's are a felony. (as well they should be). What are the punishments for DUI's in Ontario? 1st offense you lose your license for 3 years - plus possible prison time 2nd offense you lose your license for 5 years - plus possible prison time But, if you're not a Canadian citizen, you're not allowed in the country for 10 years... even if you're not driving. There's a logic here that I disagree with. Not the intention, but the enforcement. You can aply for reinstatement or proof of rehabilitation after 5 years, however the problem is the difficulty in the requirements. This debate has actually informed me quite a bit. I've been doing a lot of research into this. My main problem is with the 6-10years ago DUI's. I wouldn't mind seeing a zero tollerance for 5 years, and then after 5 years zero driving in Ontario. This would actually be LEGAL under Candian law. Since the government could deem them ""rehabilitated""."
