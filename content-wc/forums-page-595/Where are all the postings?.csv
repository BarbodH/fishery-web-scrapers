1059693,Bill Krejca,2008-10-09 14:54:00,6107,"Yeah, besides Rose and Obabikon, Agate is/was another of my favorites. I don't believe he has posted most of the summer. Bill Krejca"
1059923,Guest,2008-10-10 20:27:00,0,Another long time poster was Trailerguy...where was/is he? Even Bud from Red Lake has very few post this year. Craig
1060384,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-10-14 16:27:00,116,"It's been a long time!! With having dial-up at the camp, it seems like I never had the time to keep up with you guys. Not to mention the site was done for a while. Year one. We got here May 17th and there hasn't been a day, ever since, that I don't stop for a moment, look around and I'm in awe of my environment. Like the 2nd day, it was about 40 degress and I was outside gazing around. I heard an odd sound. Here it was the ice/ snow melting and crackling from a bank. It's so peaceful and quiet here. When was the last time you heard the snow melting? To sum it up, it was everything we expected and then some. Every single guest was a pleasure. Really. Not one bad fish in the pond. Of course we need to keep building up, but Canada wasn't built in a day. We have a new ""deluxe"" cabin and a new fish cleaning/bait house done. Yet this fall we have a huge garage/building to take done and that will be it for the year. I cannot believe it's time to go next month. The time flew by. As for the fishing, we have little to gage it against. At least next year we can reflect back to 2008. Our regulars, one group in particular said, "" this year, out of 12 years, we had one of our best days and one of our worst"". To our knowledge, biggest fish sizes for the season; Walleye 31"", Northern 39"", Musky 46"", Smallie 5 lbs and lake trout 36"". All but the lake trout were released. Personally for me, Walleye 21"" Northern 36"", no musky for Rose and a 20"" smallie. Speaking of Musky, I bet [no fish story] that 50% of our guests inadvertantly caught Musky on 6-8 lb test using jigs with minnow, leeches and crawlers. The biggest boated being 40+ inches. That's crazy isnt it? Some now some think musky fishing is easy. We had to remind them that musky are ""the fish of 1000 casts"" Sorry to have written so much but it's been such a pleasure to be here that sometimes I ramble on. I will be asking for your help in the future, I have more questions to ask so thanks in advance...Rose"
1058994,Guest,2008-10-05 22:15:00,0,"I understand it is October and the snow is about to fly in NW Ontario, but since the new message board reared its ""ugly head"", I would say the quantity and quality of the fishing report have diminished. What say all? Craig"
1059031,Bill Krejca,2008-10-06 07:35:00,6107,"Craig, Yeah, the drop in posts has been quite noticeable. Several factors may account for it: - This is a transition period for the Canadian posts, swinging from soft water to hard, or to hunting. - Some slowdown in travel to the north country, due to the economy. - Folks have a natural tendency to want information before the trip, and then get caught up in ""normal business catchup"" when they return home, and neglect to post the results of their trip. - Preoccupation with the political scene, and the economy. Bill Krejca"
1059067,Golden,2008-10-06 09:34:00,2172,"Actually the postings have increased since the new board reared it's ""ugly head"".Traffic as a whole has increased.It's just that time of year for Canadian travel (like Bill K said)"
1059076,rebs,2008-10-06 09:49:00,7587,"I don't think the new board has an ""ugly head"", I like it just fine"
1059088,joeman79,2008-10-06 10:12:00,417,"I personally like the old message board better, but the new look is ok. 302 days to Lac Seul. And I don't know about traffic in the fall as I am usually busy getting ready for the hunting seasns and kids ballgames."
1059334,prov1900,2008-10-07 18:53:00,544,"I am just sitting at home, rotting, since I don't get to get in a Fall Canada trip for the first time in a long time. But I visit this site often, living vicariously through those that are there."
1059352,Guest,2008-10-07 20:06:00,0,"Not being a computer person, I find the new system more difficult but I assume there is a reason? I sure notice that it is hardly worth logging on for new entries though. Over the years I have learned a lot from listening to your comments and especially your complaints and I like the fact that it is strictly anglers talking to each other. Obabikon's entry changed things a bit but as long as it works I'll keep reading and appreciating the info I get. I wish outfitters had a similar forum to discuss their probs and solutions. Hope you get over the change and keep communicating"
1059390,Backwater Eddy,2008-10-08 06:12:00,3871,"You always see a seasonal slow down in postings in early fall, folks are busy. It will pick up again soon.WC.com is a great site and has a wide fan user base. Many post, many more are lurkers and read but do not often post.The new boards has nothing to do with it, folks adjust soon enough. I happen to like it."
1059400,Obabikon,2008-10-08 06:34:00,2370,"I like the new board. It does make it a little more inconvenient to post without being logged in. I think that's a good thing, but that's just me. Another huge advantage is hiding all the posts. Some of those longer topics would take up the entire page. Just my 2cents"
1059484,2 DOGS,2008-10-08 12:45:00,361,"I miss the postings of "" Rose from Cliff Lake"", Often wonder how the first season went for them. She was certainly upbeat this spring."
