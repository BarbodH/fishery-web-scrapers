With the exchange rate at that time, the trip was going to cost us $1,147 per person. This fall we received a notice that our $300 deposit was due. My dad gave me a check in mid September. I held onto it because no one else had sent me their deposit. When I checked the exchange rate on Wednesday I noticed that with the stronger dollar our trip was now down to $929 per person. I called to tell him that I made him money by not sending in his check. Saturday, I checked the exchange rate again and found that our trip had dropped another $40 and was down to $885 due to the dollar gaining another 4 cents on the Canadian dollar. Now I am wondering if I should pay for the trip in full, or take a chance on the dollar gaining more strength."

I'm gonna wait it out and watch, hopefully the crude price rebounds and the dollar follows suit. Its been a government conspiricy for 2 decades to keep our dollar as low as they can, being that were an export nation. I think it will climb back up to that 88 cent mark. ( I hope) Have fun on your fishing trip."
1062202,Obabikon,2008-10-26 14:25:00,2370,"Pay the trip in full ASAP. The US dollar is ""artificially"" strong. Honestly, the economy stinks, but people are putting money in the US. We all hope it holds, but I seriously doubt it does. I doubt even more that it drops another significant amount. Anyhow, just my opinion. Could save you several hundred bucks."
1062204,Roddy,2008-10-26 14:33:00,488,I am leaning towards paying in full. $879 is an excellent value for a 5 day trip.

1062332,Tim_Kelly,2008-10-27 12:17:00,710,"Buy now. I bet it will start creeping up again after the election, whoever wins."
1062334,Obabikon,2008-10-27 12:34:00,2370,"This doesn't really affect the resorts income wise. We pay our bills, taxes, payroll etc... all in Canadian funds. All our money eventually gets converted to Canadian. So, if you have a resort that charges in Canadian, then it benefits you to exchange your money at the lowest time. If you have a resort that charges in US... it doesn't matter, because your rate is set."
1062336,Obabikon,2008-10-27 12:35:00,2370,"I should add, if anything, the resort will be happy to have the extra cash flow."
