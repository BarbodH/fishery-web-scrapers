1061725,Guest,2008-10-22 18:58:00,0,"Laurent, How many boats are entered so far? And also have you heard how the fishing has been recently? Is the bite picking up since the Voyageur? Are the big girls moving in?"
1061852,Guest,2008-10-23 15:00:00,0,"As of right now we have 40 boats 10-20 walk up and we will reached our goal. Lots and lots of 20-24 in fish, big mamas are around but not in big numbers. The morning bite is really good"
1061896,freespoolin,2008-10-23 18:45:00,472,And how's the supply of Pineview Shiners at Clark's Corner?
1061899,mrwalleye5,2008-10-23 19:15:00,1922,"The shinners are very poor. Two different brands, both are very small. I was in most cases doubling and tripling up. It's not Clark's fault. Some of these came out of Winnipeg retails also. Seems that the shinner harvest possibly just came in as smaller shinners. W5"
1061922,Bobby,2008-10-23 23:16:00,211,"Stock might be low at this time if the minnow/shiner run isn't hot while demand is high. Some minnow fishermen will package small minnows, perch minnows, and other crap in their tubs, while other minnow businesses will wait and keep trying until quality minnows run. I may be biased (because it's my inlaw's business - but I don't work for them) but I do know that Lake Winnipeg Shiners ensure that they don't package small minnows in their tubs. They have lots of customers, no advertising, are reputation based, a mom and pop business, etc, and have been in business for three decades. I do know that fishermen generally regard them as the best of the bunch when it comes to local frozen minnows... I won't say where they're all sold at (probably against forum rules?) and I'll leave my post at that."
