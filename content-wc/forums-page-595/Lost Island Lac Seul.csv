I was wondering since I have never been to Lac Seul how tough it will be for me to find good fishing without a guide? Will be using camp boats with 50 hp. Feel I am accomplished walleye fisherman and Have never had a guide before, and have heard conflicting posts and need for a guide on Lac Seul. All guides I believe are already booked for week. I know they travel quite a distance to primary fishing grounds, but wondered there was any good fishing closer to lodge? Any tips or advice would be great. Or any waypoints. Also want to fish for Smallies and spots and patterns that time of year would be great. Thanks, Big Joe"

I also go in the spring so take my spots with a grain of salt. Smallies might be a bit tough though but there are pockets here and there. I've typically found some if you go try the south shore from the boat ramp near hudson all the way over to the east where there is a weedy bay with a bunch of dead tree debries stacked up. Other than that I always find smallies in random pockets on rocky shores with a somewhat steep drop off.You can also start of with the shore straight north of the island and troll west. We've caught some nice fish there.Our typical strategy is pick a likely shoreline (5-20 feet) and troll up and down it 3 times. If we get hits around the same spot, jig.If anyone says they know a pattern to the lake I think they're on crack. I've always found each day you go out and kind of figure out what kind of structure fish are biting off but by the next day it's changed. Sometimes there is some consistancy so it's not a bad idea to go back to the same spot, but just cause you find a good spot the first day doesn't mean you're set for the trip. The good news is that if they're not in a spot, go somewhere else and you'll find em eventually.From what I read on this board, you're going to have a better chance of catching bigger fish if you take the hour trip up toward the big part of lac seul, but I almost never go too far east of the island and do just fine.Of course this coming year I'm planning on finding some shipmates who want to explore up toward the big part of the lake so if anyone knows any places up there I wouldn't mind some advice too My best advice is just ask Shane or Bazzle (sp?). If the guides are all spoken for I'm sure they'll try to describe where to go (though never having been to the lake if might be a bit tricky for you). Even when they weren't spoken for they'll let us in on some different spot each time.Good luckBrian"
1059976,joeman79,2008-10-11 14:22:00,417,Thanks Brian. I figured there would be good fishing closer to lodge. Thanks and I would still appreciate any other tips. Joe

A little direction from the lodge and you'll figure out what to look for pretty quick. We have also been up in August although later in the month. It's a big lake so a GPS is in order. If you have a GPS that accepts the navionics chips their Canandian one covers Lac Suel and is really helpful."
1060137,orchard frank,2008-10-13 07:59:00,1900,"You'll do just fine at Lost Island, everyone will do their best to get you on fish. My wife and I went there for many, many years, best run lodge you can imagine. You can travel as far or as little as you want. We spent a whole week one year staying real close, just to see if we could, and we did fine. Many great spots within sight of the lodge, folks catch a bunch casting off the docks or in front of their cabins. They will mark a map for you. Kewatin Bay is about 5 minutes away, great fishing in August. Fish ""Picnic Point"" on the left as you enter the bay, or enter the bay and follow the right hand (eastern) shoreline till it ends, fish the point that extends underwater. Want closer?, go down to the far right hand dock, look to your right and fish the 2 smaller islands you are looking at. That's a couple to get you started, there are tons more. A day with a guide is a whole experience, I would recommend it to anyone going. Great day of fishing, shore lunch, see a lot of the lake, learn what works best at the time you are there. Basel is just a great person and a good friend, but anyone there will give you a day to remember."
1060162,joeman79,2008-10-13 10:57:00,417,"Thanks Frank I am really looking forward to the trip. Shane said Basil may be available later in week and want to go with him one day if possible. Our group has no problem going on a long boat ride but would also like to fish close as to get a feel for the lake a little at a time. 2 yrs ago on a flyin out of Ft Frances we flew over Lac Seul, for a 1/2 hour so we saw how massive the lake was. Somewhat intimidating compared to lakes we have fished. But have read to much good about Lac Seul not to try it. Also have never read anything bad about Lost Isaland except for the common Privy, which won't bother our group of rednecks a bit."

1061460,Mike Kansas,2008-10-21 10:19:00,1463,"joeman, We have been to Lost Island the last three years and it is a great place. You will get all the help you need from Shane and his crew to put you on fish. If you want to make the long run up lake I would recommend that you use your GPS and spend some time before you go acquanting yourself with a good lake map of the NE section of the lake. Best of luck and if you have any questions that I might be able to help you with let me hear from you. email [email protected] Mike Kansas"
