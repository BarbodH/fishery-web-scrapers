I intend to make up for lost time next year. Feel free to PM me for any fishing information about the lake."

I think we would like to do mostly Northern/smallmouth fishing with some walleye for eating. Im familiar with the minaki area type fishing but willing to look elswhere, but my question is do camps offer discounts to teens and have you guys had any good experiences at any of these camps? Thanks"
1057362,Golden Eagle,2008-09-25 12:59:00,2642,"In 2008 my favorite fly-in charged $895 U.S. plus tax, per person for 7 days and 7 nights. The family price for 1 adult and 2 under 16 is $2000 plus tax. Also $2000 plus tax for 2 adults and one under 16. I believe the family plan is for July and August, but pretty sure the owner would come through during another month if there happened to be an open cabin. It's a family plan, but I'm sure a father, child and friend would qualify. Outfitters are in business to make a profit and to make customers happy.No sm, but tons of walleyes and huge pike.I appreciate seeing youngsters get started fishing and would be happy to assist with information, if needed, no matter where you end up fishing with your son.Wolverine fan, Bo was my neigbor, but didn't fish with me. He was always working."

1058325,Guest,2008-10-01 13:34:00,0,"Sorry guys, I have just returned from a fishing/golfing trip to the Outer Banks with 6 friends. Took me all day yesterday to get caught up at work and today im back, sorry. Thank you for the input, we are trying to figure out which week to go as I normally have gone before he gets out of school and now i have to wait till second week of june at least. by the way the fishing and golfing were horrendous as the winds never got below 40 mph! hit some long shots though.Ha. Any other ifo greatly appreciated"
1058417,Golden Eagle,2008-10-01 20:03:00,2642,It's good to hear from you. Be sure to take your son fishing and have a great trip. You're making a great investment.
1060048,Tonyo,2008-10-12 07:44:00,212,"I know one thing if you are planning a trip for early June, looking now is a great idea since most of the camps are full that early in the spring. We stay at Five Lakes Lodge on Gullrock lake and have been for several years. They are great people to stay with and they have extended a discount for our teens that go with. I am not sure what the cut off age is but you can ask and see. This lake is mainly a walleye and northern lake. They do have access to portage nothern and small mouth lakes. If you are looking for a great walleye lake this is one of the best in my opinion. Hope you find what you are looking for and have a great week in Canada. Tonyo."
