I'm just wondering what extra costs there are that go along with this? How is it taxed? Are there any different safety regs it has to meet? What do i need to get it accross the border? Any help would be very much appreciated! Travis"

Make sure the owner/dealer has clear title to the boat/motor/trailer etc. decide how you are going to pay for it, cash, bank transfer, bank draft, or however. My bank wanted a name to put on the bank draft when I went to get one. Being I was looking at 3 boats, I could not supply a name, so ended up taking cash. If you are taking more than $10,000 out of Canada, including cash, travellers chegues, etc, you have to stop at the Canadian customs and declare it. also make sure you declare at the Amercian Customs how much money you have. They will probably take you and your party in and count every penny you have on you, including anyone travelling with you. this is due to money laundering, drug deals etc, so they are just doing their job. If you have ever been arrested, be up front about it, as they check your id and records. Even if the charges were dropped, confess, as they probably know about it. Make SURE you get a separate bill of sale for the trailer, as well as a separate bill that covers the boat, motor and contents included in the deal. These bills should include serial numbers. Make SURE that the trailer has a compliance sticker on it, which should show serial number, date of manufacture, tire size etc. It is usually located on the left inside of the frame, up near the front of the Y. As of last week, you still need to get a ""notice of recall"" from the trailer manufacturer, stating that there has been no recalls on the trailer. I hae dwelt with Shoreland'r twice and have received excellent service, they wil fax you or email you the notice. this notice is required when you take it to Canadian Tire to get inspected. At the border you will pay gst on the value of the trailer, and will fill out a RIV form with the customs agent. This will be sent into the gov't. YOu can either pay the $204.75 trailer inspection fee at the border or you can send it in by mail or you can go to RIV.com or riv.ca(not sure which right now) I emailed mine in and had the paperwork emailed back to me within about 4 days. they have been very busy, so it may take longer. There is a transaction number on the form you fill out at customs, that is required on your riv application, along with the customs port code. once you get your paperwork back from Riv, then you can make arrangements to have the trailer inspected at CT. Nobody cares about the boat and motor. You will pay gst and gst on the value of the boat and contents. You can go to SGI and get a 7 day insurance that is good for any 7 day period which will cover you while you are trailering the boat home, with no plates on it. it costs $11 so well worth it. All in all a very simple process, as long as you play by the rules. Email me, at [email protected] and I can give you a couple of money saving pointers as well. barry"
