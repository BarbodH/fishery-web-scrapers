This year just my wife and I are going. We will be there the last week of July. Can any of you who have been there at that time of year give me any help on how you did, what did or didnt work. Any thing we need to know? Thanks"

We've always done well but it changes every year depending on water temp, wind direction etc. We have a few spots that traditionally produce but do find some new spots every year. One thing that is common, fish the windy side. Set up a milk run of reefs and points and work them until you find the active fish. Depth varies year to year but is usually 15-25'. Again, depth will change based on conditions."
