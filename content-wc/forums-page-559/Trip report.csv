The guy on the US side did try to trip me up which I thought was kind of funny. He asked me where we'd been etc. Asked if I was bringing any fish across. Said, No. Then, asked a few other questions and then said..........okay, other than the fish you have, did you bring anything else???? I said, ""I didn't bring any fish"". LOL Nice try border dude!Weather: Ugh! I know most people would have thought we had great weather and I shouldn't really complain but **** was it hot! We go up late August/Early Sept because we like nice cold nights and decent days. It had to be in the upper 70's and possibly low 80's most of the time and SUNNY. Sorry for those who had cold rainy trips most of the year. I would have taken a nice cold rainy day in the middle to break up the sun and wind burn at the end of each day. I like sitting in the cabin at night with a fire vs. sweating. Flights: Both flights were about as smooth as they possibly could have been. We did have a close call with a bird strike on the way out. Not sure what they were? Pilot thought they might have been Swans? They should stick to the ponds in the cemetary. Fishing: Fishing was very very good. Very sporadic but when they turned on they really turned on. Normally, we have slower periods but this year seemed to almost be an all or nothing. But, had 2 x 28 inchers, several 26 inchers and too many to count between 22 and 24 inches. One 28 incher was caught on a silver walleye harness and the other a jig. We all had the best luck using some sort of spinner though. Had one afternoon and the following morning that it seemed as if nothing that was caught in any boat (9 guys) was under 20 to 21 inches. And, it was not slow at all.Biggest Northern (which we try not to catch) was 33 inches. Did I mention it was hot?"

1136423,SinOrSwim,2009-09-16 21:07:00,1528,Verne sold about 1/2 his cabins and the main lodge in Sioux Lookout. It seems as if they are still running somewhat together as Verne still uses the bunkhouse etc. We haven't seen any changes in operations since the switch either. Which is very good news as Verne runs a very good operation. John seems to have taken over and kept things very consistent. The fishing was very very good this year even with the water up about 4 feet. Most of the bigger fish came in about 30 to 35 ft of water and seemingly little to no structure. We were hitting a point off an island and drifting away from the island. Once the bottom flattened out and stayed about 30 feet or so is when they hit. Very good trip as always.
