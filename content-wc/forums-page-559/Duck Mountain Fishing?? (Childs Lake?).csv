Anyone have some insight into good walleye lakes in Duck Mountain ...or should I just stick to LOTP???"
1135293,Guest,2009-09-11 12:04:00,0,If your heading to the duck mountain go for trout. Wellmen in the north end of the park has good walleye But the Ducks is better know for it's trout

For eyes there are few places on the prairies better than LOTP. Wellman would be the best bet for consistent walleye action in the ducks, but I do much much better fishing lake dauphin and lotp."
