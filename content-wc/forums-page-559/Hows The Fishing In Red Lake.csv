1134470,Enid Elizabeth,2009-09-08 09:47:00,59,"I'm on Douglas Lake, west of Red Lake and the water was up 3 feet. It's gone down 20 inches in the last week and a half. Still the dock is destroyed.....needed a new one some day...... guess it is now. Strange that with such high water, the fishing has been great!! I mean lots of hungry large and small fish....just in different places. We are seeing more small walleye than usual... good sign for lake health. They were of course at the mouth of the fast flowing creeks but also on the points and narrows of the lake. A small northern took up residence in the flooded gas shed. A beaver knawed through the phone line. finally out of rubber boots....."

1132813,Tony Shirley,2009-08-31 13:05:00,211,Peoples mouths in red lake are tighter than a walleye after a cold front lol
1132838,Golden Eagle,2009-08-31 14:38:00,2642,"Hey Tony, do you suppose they might be out on the water since fishing has been going well and they're having nice weather this week. I'll be up there either for 9 days in mid September or two weeks in early October. There may be only two people in our camp and we might be the only ones in the neighborhood out on the water. Would like to have another boat fired up so we can be sure to get back in at night. Without being up there right now I can still tell you that fishing is better than good. I believe the Red Lake Tournament is being held next weekend. Check the results. PM me for the site."
1132839,tackleman,2009-08-31 14:38:00,444,"hey, 3 days befor the tournament, nobody wants to share. but i'll tell you this, I tried red lake yesterday and I was by potato island and probably 25 boats went passed me and headed to pipestone bay. what does that tell you?got a number of little fish (10 -15) inches and a few that were 22 inches but nothing over the magic number of 23 inches.I tried several spots in different areas of the lake with the same results.the web site is redlakefallclassic.com"
1132891,Skywagon,2009-08-31 18:20:00,1106,Flying up there tomorrow (Tuesday) to ride along with a team that is pre-fishing for the tournament. Water has to still be high. Check out the CKDR website for Red Lake high water pictures.
1132894,Golden Eagle,2009-08-31 18:41:00,2642,"Hey Steve, take your GPS along and mark some good spots. Maybe buzz my friend Brett on Little Vermilion. Camp is just north of the Middle Narrows. Watch out for flack."
1132903,Golden Eagle,2009-08-31 19:23:00,2642,"Tackleman, are you entered in the tournament? If so, good luck."
1132913,Guest,2009-08-31 19:38:00,0,Tony your Internet Prefishing?
1132948,Moondog,2009-08-31 22:03:00,362,I like that concept...........Pre-fishing. Isn't that what this forum is about??? I wish I was pre-fishing Gull Rock. rats.
1132973,Skywagon,2009-09-01 04:56:00,1106,"Golden Eagle, I think you are on to me. My job is to fly around and mark spots on the GPS when I see someone catching a fish. No, not really, but I did have to sign a document in blood about not sharing spots, or my jigs would be taken away for a year."
