I looked at Best Western, Holiday Express and Comfort Inn and they are all $120+. Any other suggestions as to a decent place to stay this weekend. We'll be needing 6 rooms. Thanks, Pat T"

A bed to sleep in and a shower. This spring when we stopped at their resturante I saw ""rooms starting at $40"" posted. Resturante is good. Phone number is 807 223 2251. Right on 17 on Wesdt side of Dryden. (think it's just down from the Chalet you spoke of."
1135838,nebrfred,2009-09-14 15:18:00,4,I stayed at the Trans Canada Motel last week on my way to a resort on Lac Seul. The price was only $44 a night and the restaurant was great. The phone # is 807-223-2251.

Town and Country can be found with a Google search. We stayed in the Best Western, which is good but pricey.The IGA Grocery Store is a good place to buy groceries.Good luck.Gary"
1136063,plogsdon,2009-09-15 12:09:00,14,You might want to contact Indian Point Lodge about 5mi out of town. We stayed overnight before a flyin. It ran about 25/fisherman. They put you in an empty cabin if available.

McDonalds is right beside the Town and Country. Tim Hortons is afew blocks away which is good too. Indian Point Camp is a place to consider as its a place to stay on the lake, good rates and will also cook a evening meal for you."
