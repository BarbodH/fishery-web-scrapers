1135612,skap,2009-09-13 17:41:00,58,Quick question for all of you Canada experts out there. I am heading up to Sioux Lookout next Saturday (19th) and noticed when reading the Sioux Bulletin online that on the 15th a new law takes effect requiring boaters to have in their posession a boater operators card. The article was pretty vague however if it applied to resident boaters/non-resident boaters or both. Anyone familiar with this requirement? Any information would be greatly appreciated.Thanks!

Non-residents only need to obtain a Pleasure Craft Operator Card if they are operating their powered boat in Canadian waters for more than 45 consecutive days or if the boat they are operating is registered or licensed in Canada (this includes rented boats). Boater Education Cards or equivalent certifications are recognized in Canada. Proper identification should be kept on board at all times to provide proof of residency."

Any DNR sponsored course will work for you if you are up there for that long of a time. If you rent a boat the contract the guy gives you when you rent one works also.
1136451,deputy dog,2009-09-17 06:20:00,305,"doin week long fly-in in '10, i don't need the operators card correct?"
1136491,Flip Silverlake,2009-09-17 09:16:00,645,No you don't. Since your not going to be there more than 45 days and your renting a boat it's not required.
1136579,J-Man,2009-09-17 15:24:00,191,"I spoke with Transport Canada to verify the 45 day rule. This applies to the boat; not the person.If the boat is in Canada more than 45 days, then an operator card or proof of competency from home state (is US resident) is required.Also, if the boat is registered in Canada (taxes paid, imported, etc) then the opertor will need a card or proof of competency regardless of how long it has been in Canada or where the operator is from.The above poster is correct in that most places renting boats will now have a rental checklist that will pass as proof of competency for the duration of your rental. There are different places you can take the test and a study guide is available in PDF format online as well. You are given 1 hour to complete and must get 27 correct answers out of 36 questions. The test isn't super hard, but it's not a cake walk either so if you write a Canadian test, make sure you have actually studied the material.Contacting your state DNR office (US residents) to ask about what type of boating safety certification they offer would likely be easier in most cases.''The fine will be over $200 if I'm not mistaken so it's not worth fooling around with. The newspapers up here also reporting that Canadian insurance will be invalid in the case of a claim involving an operator that does not have a card or equivalent proof of competency. Happy boating!"

1136595,Skywagon,2009-09-17 16:37:00,1106,You can also take the test online. There are several different sites that do this and the prices vary. The one I used was $39.
