1133061,ole timer,2009-09-01 09:51:00,34,"I just purchased an inflatable belt pack designed to be worn like a fanny pack, but in front. US Coast Guard Type III approved. I assume this is a legal PFD in Ontario. Do I assume correctly?ot"
1133248,Opti-Mist,2009-09-01 19:50:00,1402,"If you are legal based on your local requirements you will typically be O.K. with Ontario (reciprocity). On this end of the U.P. we are in and out of Ontario waters. Any time I've been checked by MNR, OPP, etc, we have been O.K. because we conform to Michigan and USCG requirements for the Great Lakes. So, long answer short, Yes!"
1133261,fisherman 1,2009-09-01 20:24:00,39,You are legal as long as you are in a vessel that is licenced in the US and is not in Canada over 45 days. If this is the case you are required to have the proper safety equipment ie: pfd's approved by your state. If you are in Canada over 45 days you must have pfd's that are CSA approved along with all safety equipment required by the Canadian Coast Gaurd for that vessel.fish on!
1135603,Five Lakes Lodge,2009-09-13 16:54:00,4,"Hi Ole Timer....just one point of interest that I recently found out: If you use an inflatable PFD in Ontario you must wear it at all times when you are in the boat. Unlike the typical PFD (or life jacket) which you are not required to wear (just have one in the boat).One of our guests was recently checked by the Red Lake OPP (Ontario Provincial Police) on Gullrock Lake and he was given a ""verbal warning"" in this regard. He was told the reason for this distinction is the inflatable type vest may not be accessible (ie. may not float free in the event the boat capsizes or sinks). I have not personally confirmed this with the OPP - so I would be interested to know if anyone else has heard about it."
1135641,Jimmy Jig,2009-09-13 19:36:00,1905,In Iowa you have to wear these type of vests at all times in the boat to be legal.
1135913,fisherman 1,2009-09-14 19:27:00,39,"You are correct, the inflatable pfd's must be worn at all times while boating."
