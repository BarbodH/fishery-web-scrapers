1135425,Guest,2009-09-12 07:41:00,0,Sounds like it would be better to drive down and put in at Morson or just try to find some crappies around Sioux Narrows.
1135656,1700SS,2009-09-13 20:36:00,104,"Bill,Could not find any over by hay today. Made the trip up to Obab. lake. Out of the 3 of us we kept 1 nice limit, off of the trees. Buddy of mine got into them in the elbow pretty good after we left to go after some walleye. Water temp was 74 up there today. Very warm for this time of year. Jared I will be stopping by in the next couple days, talk to u then.Brett"
1135662,Bill Krejca,2009-09-13 21:00:00,6107,"Brett, As I said in an earlier post, I'll be coming up on Sat., Sep 19, so if you are still up, please stop over. This warm water temperature is starting to bother me a bit, I think if it is warm, they may delay stacking up in the deeper water. The crappie fishing at Hay is different than at the elbow. You really have to find the spot on the spot, as they say, in order to have good results, at least that's the way it has been for me, at this time of the year. Many times one end of the boat will be catching and the other end will not. One explanation is the more abrupt water depth changes around Hay. Accompanying snags sometimes make it a challenge to not get hung up, really have to keep an eye on the depth finder, and change line length accordingly, and quickly. Add a little wind, and it gets even more challenging. (Also, the wind direction seems to determine where the fish are -- wind change=location change.) Good luck, Bill Krejca"
1135663,Obabikon,2009-09-13 21:03:00,2370,"The warm weather slows the move, that's for sure. The last 10 days have been by far the nicest stretch of weather we've had in 12months. Too bad duck hunting is right around the corner, the hunters will hate to see all this sun!"
1136567,Guest,2009-09-17 14:32:00,0,"Any more updates on the crappie bite. Will be up on Sat 19th for a week. Hopefully things start to pick up. I am interested in Miles Bay,Hay Island or Obabikon lake bite. Thanks Jon"
1136660,congo,2009-09-17 22:38:00,42,"Super slow in Miles today. Lucked out yesterday in Miles, got near limit including 2 14inchers. Found a large amount of minnows jumping in a shallow bay jumping out of the water and found out that the crappie were on persuit on the minnows, and caught them as fast as you could get them. Only lasted for about an 1/2 hour. Went back today and couldn't find but 6 or 7 crappie. Very warm and sunny the entire week. Good luck Bill and to all. Duane"
1134195,Bill Krejca,2009-09-06 19:38:00,6107,"Yeah, I expect to find them 20-30 feet down (Water may be deeper than that) in Sabaskong by mid Sep. I usually just use tubes, with a little scent squeezed into the hollow, seems to make a difference when they are tentative. IShoot - Thanks for the the temp check, seems rather warm. Bill Krejca"
1134321,1shooter,2009-09-07 16:21:00,1493,It was a little warm but when we left the area this morning it showed 68 degrees.
1134360,Obabikon,2009-09-07 18:37:00,2370,70 degree is what I had in Myles Bay today.
1134731,Obabikon,2009-09-09 08:15:00,2370,"The crappies appear to be in the elbow. I was up there yesterday, and could see the schools. However, they were not biting. We caught maybe 5 up there in a couple hours."
1134943,fishncamp,2009-09-09 20:34:00,49,I will be visiting at Youngs (Steven's Bay) over the next few days. I usually muskie fish but may try my hand at the crappies there. Thanks for the update and I will post back when I return. Cheers.
1134986,Bill Krejca,2009-09-10 06:32:00,6107,"Fishn, I'll be at Young's a week from Sat. for crappies, also plan on a trip or 2 to Obabikon for crappies. There is pretty good crappie fishing around Young's, ask them to point out the spots. Use your depth finder to locate the crappies and try to maintain a very slow movement when you find them. I use tube jigs. Bill Krejca"
1135294,Guest,2009-09-11 12:12:00,0,I will be at Red Indian Lodge Sept 18th-20th. Are there crappies in the Sioux Narrows area? I have fished them in Obabikon a few times but how far is Obabikon from Sioux narrows? Never came in from that direction before.
1135328,Bill Krejca,2009-09-11 15:28:00,6107,"It's a long, long way, unless you portage for a mile across Boot Bay! (you don't want to do that!) Bill Krejca"
1135346,Obabikon,2009-09-11 16:58:00,2370,"The portage from bootbay isn't that long... more like 1/4 mile. If you're interested in renting a boat for the day, I can drop it off at the entrance. But, you'll need to call me to set it up."
1135348,Obabikon,2009-09-11 17:06:00,2370,"But, Bill's right... portaging across the portage is not something to be done. Drive down and use the turtle lake portage, but you're looking at a LONG boat ride."
1132950,Red Tail Chub,2009-08-31 22:07:00,17,When does the crappie bite on LOTW start to pick up? I've heard stories of piles of monster crappies up there. Any tips? Thanks
1132986,Obabikon,2009-09-01 06:17:00,2370,"crappies? nope no crappies.... They're biting right now in Obabikon lake, but they're on sunken trees. I suggest hiring a guide in the area for crappie fishing. They will probably start moving into their fall spots within the week."
1133025,1shooter,2009-09-01 08:14:00,1493,How are the eyes biting right now?
1133034,Obabikon,2009-09-01 08:42:00,2370,"I fished for walleyes yesterday... we caught a TON of 13-14 inchers. Only two walleyes over 20... and one in the 17-18 range. So, lots of action, but couldn't find the bigger ones."
1133122,Bill Krejca,2009-09-01 12:46:00,6107,"Jared, What do you have for surface temperature? Thanks, Bill Krejca"
1133437,Obabikon,2009-09-02 15:48:00,2370,"I really haven't been paying attention Bill... I just know they're on the deeper trees. That always means the next stop is deep water. The crappies on the big lake have already moved from the big trees, and are arriving in typical fall spots."
1133769,1700SS,2009-09-04 06:25:00,104,"Keep the reports coming Jared, will be up your way on the 11th thru the 19th. Staying at Red Wing, will stop in and check your place out this time. Bill you going to be up the same week?Brett"
1133827,Bill Krejca,2009-09-04 10:50:00,6107,"Brett, We going to miss again - I'm not going this year until Sep 19 -25. One of these years, we'll get together. Be sure to do a report when you get back, I'll do the same. I'll be at Young's Wilderness Camp again, planning on a trip or 2 to Obabikon. Have a safe trip, Bill Krejca"
1134164,way2goofy,2009-09-06 15:09:00,22,We were on LOTW several weeks ago out of Sioux Narrows. We fished for crappie in our normal spots. Cross Inlet and Blueberry. We had a hard time finding the slabs and finally realized after loosing a few dozen minnows to small perch the crappies were deeper. We found them in Blueberry in 17' to 19 ' . Normally they are in the 14-16' range or shallower. It was very cool and rainy while we were up also. Not normal weather for that week. We also tried Tiny Tubes and other small crappie jigs. They didn't respond to artificial for some reason.
1134167,1shooter,2009-09-06 15:22:00,1493,Today the water temp was 73.
