1128141,chevtow,2009-08-11 18:55:00,691,10-15 lbers are normal? Lots of BIGGER ones? Freakin how much bigger do eyes get? I gotta go now.
1128157,mike0212,2009-08-11 19:53:00,5,"Love BOQ in the fall... running planer boards with cranks in 25' 30 fow. Yo zuri and Manns baits (stretch series).. Lots of 30""+ fish lots of specific info on fish hawk or the quinte board.http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y11...00/quinte3.jpg"
1128221,Superdad,2009-08-12 06:27:00,64,"Al the info in the replies to the question are tight on the mark. I'm not sure if the Tip of the Bay is still operating at that time(they close down) There are cottages at Merland Park and there is a motel in Picton also. When you are fishing in Quinte, once you are past the ferry at Glenora you are able to use two rods per person, Planer boards are derigeur and many use lead core to get those shallow runners down to the fish. If you looking for a PB, then Quinte in November and December is the place to fish. Cheers"
1128428,bluedog,2009-08-12 21:09:00,14,there is also a motel just a little past merlands on the right side called the Sportsmans motelthey have efficentency rooms [stove sink etc ]nice people have stayed there a few trips up in the fallbluedog [a quinte fisher nut ]
1135036,keek,2009-09-10 10:15:00,1003,"In regards to November winds... are there areas of the BOQ that would be sheltered enough to use a 16' Lund Alaskan? Would these areas, if they exist, hold fish?thanks"
1135127,FISH HUNTER,2009-09-10 17:13:00,161,"It really depends on the day. Some days its crazy windy and other days aren't too bad. There are places you can go to get out of the wind but in general the hot spots are in the Picton area and its pretty open . That isn't to say you won't catch decent fish in some of the more sheltered spots. The alaskan is a pretty decent boat and alot of the days you could fish the Picton area in it no problem. I've seen much smaller boats out in some pretty good wind, but I'd say use your judgement and don't go out in waves you don't feel comfortable in. FISH HUNTER"
1135140,keek,2009-09-10 18:04:00,1003,"Thanks for your reply Fish Hunter, that's what I was looking for. Do you or anyone else know of an area (preferably free) that I can park a pickup with a slide-in camper and a boat for the few nights I'm in the area?"
1135213,FISH HUNTER,2009-09-11 03:40:00,161,I'm really not to sure where you would be able to park for a couple nights. Pretty much all of the campgrounds will be closed for the season and I don't think you are supposed to park at a conservation area over night. Not sure if some of the larger stores like Canadian Tire or Walmart would let you park overnight in their parking lot or not. I have seen motor homes and such at Walmarts but don't know how that works. Sorry I couldn't be of much help. FISH HUNTER
1135997,keek,2009-09-15 08:01:00,1003,"Thanks FH,I'll keep looking."
1136007,rebs,2009-09-15 08:43:00,7587,"walmart welcomes campers and truckers over night, you just have to go inside the store and let them know you are staying over in the parking lot"
1122154,Kino,2009-07-19 11:53:00,101,Wanting to hit the famed Bay Of Quinte and need to know when would be the best time to consider a fall trip to there for a huge eye for the wall???
1122156,FISH HUNTER,2009-07-19 11:57:00,161,November and December are the best 2 months to come up here. It's cold and windy but its worth it. FISH HUNTER
1122177,rebs,2009-07-19 14:32:00,7587,"place to stay, has anyone stayed there latelyhttp://www.tipofthebay.com/"
1122181,Mark Komo,2009-07-19 15:00:00,867,"Wow, nice find. I am curious to hear some experiences also."
1122192,rebs,2009-07-19 15:53:00,7587,we stayed there a few years ago
1122205,northern walleye,2009-07-19 17:15:00,152,"i think the last two weeks of november and December, windy and cold for sure but there is nothing really like it catching those fish....."
1122273,Kino,2009-07-19 21:50:00,101,"Thanks for the post guys.....What is typically the program then??? I would assume pulling cranks deep?? Is day or night fishing better?? Also, how rough does the water get??? Can you pretty much fish every day? I know it depends probably on how big your boat is. Mine is an 1825 Lund Explorer. Also, how many fish do you usually boat that time of year??? THANKS again guys!"
1122287,FISH HUNTER,2009-07-20 03:40:00,161,"Pulling big cranks like reef runners and stretch 20+ is what most people do however some people do well jigging. The bite is usually pretty good for most of the day. You'll be fine for the most part in your 1825 but there are days when even with that I'd stay on shore. If you look on The Next Bite website or you tube Gary and Keith did a show up here called bay of pigs. This will give you a pretty good idea of size, numbers and what the wind will be like this time of year. FISH HUNTER"
1122330,Mark Komo,2009-07-20 08:01:00,867,This looked like an interesting sitehttp://www.quintefishing.com/
1128101,mojo1,2009-08-11 16:41:00,4,"As stated already, November/December are your best bets for huge Walleye. We usually head there about the 3rd week of Nov. for an extended weekend. Cold weather gear is a must (ie. Survival Suits). You can keep fishing until the boat ramps freeze over. That will vary from year to year. You also are quite likely going to yet big wind on the bay during this time, drift socks can be handy some days to slow the troll down to a working speed. The website mentioned in a earlier post about Quinte is a good source of all you need to know about the area. It's hardy fishing, but worth the effort. 10 - 15 lbers are normal with lots of bigger ones out there. cheers and good luck"
