A lot of big fish this year with the biggest being 28"" caught in Butterfly lake. Most fish were caught in the 30' range on jigs with minnows(larger the better) and crawlers. It seemed to be a morning and early evening bite with the afternoons left for casting. The northern fishing was not as good in years past with a lot of smaller fish. I have been up this time of year-before Labor Day quite a few times and I have never seen as many boats as I did this year. It was a good trip made even better by the weather- a couple of days it probably was too calm. We had 4 bear hunters in camp who got their 4 bears by the 2nd day with bows. We traded some walleye for some back strap and I do believe that might just rank up there with filet mignon."

I was up the first week in June and it was pretty miserable out there at times with snow, rain, and cold. Still better than a day at work though!!Heading back up on the 19th for another quick trip. I try to do a couple of short 4 days trips a season as opposed to a full week etc. Thanks for the fishing info! Minnitaki is usually pretty consistent in the fall with fish in that 30 foot area so its nice to hear it is similar now even with the cold and rainy summer weather. Thanks for the post. Love hearing about Minnitaki!!"
