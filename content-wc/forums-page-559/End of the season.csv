No problems or delays at the border, infact, in 15 trips we have never been searched or delayed in any way, coming or going.We had basically good weather for our July trip except on the day of the tornado. We all know how sad and unfortunate that day was. In August the weather was great. Only had 2 mornings of rain and it cleared off by mid-morning and the sun came out. We actually had a couple of days that got into the 80's. The people at our resort said we had picked the only 2 weeks of summer type weather they had up to that point.We found the fishing to be good during both trips, infact, they both fall into our top 5 in total fish and walleyes caught. The eyes were scattered on both trips and we had to move around to find them. In July water temps were cold so we fished mostly shallow, weedy bays. Had a few days that were fantastic in 4'-6' of water. By Aug. the water had warmed some but we still found them fairly shallow in 4'-15'. In July we caught a few more total eyes but in Aug. a lot more slots and overs.We love fishing Lac Seul and never feel like we have a bad day on the water. Afterall, a bad day on LS is still better than the best day at home."
