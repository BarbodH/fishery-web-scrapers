1134966,CrossinEYES,2009-09-09 22:23:00,139,Just wondering if anyone has tried this lake lately. We made the trip 6 years in a row but havnt been up there since 2002. Wondering if the campground has improved at all or still primative. THANKS FOR THE HELP!! Dale
1135149,Bigfishhunter,2009-09-10 18:33:00,803,Still primitive and that is the way we like it up here. Keeps it nice and quiet. Fishing is worth while to say the least. heading there in about another week. Of course for me it is only 45 min down the road.
1135200,CrossinEYES,2009-09-10 21:57:00,139,"THanks for the response! How has the water level been, I heard it was low a few years ago?? Also wondering if there is still a good Lake Trout bite in the spring? I want to get my 2 young boys into that action if I can. Thinking first full week next June. THanks again!! Dale"
1135417,Bigfishhunter,2009-09-12 06:22:00,803,"The water level was on the low side last fall. Not super low but lower than normal. Our wet cool summer brought it back up. The june laker bite is usually hot. However if you had tried to go this year the first week of june you would have had to break ice. It was a very late ice out on the bigger lakes. That is abnormal though, ice is usually off early to mid may. I am heading there in a week or two to hit some fall trout action."
1135670,CrossinEYES,2009-09-13 22:06:00,139,"Thanks SO much for the info. Next spring would it be ok to contact you to see if you could help me make sure the ice is off. We USUALLY try to time it so we are there shortly after the Ice leaves, thats when we have had the best luck for the Lakers and nice Northern. Walleye usually come pretty easy that time of year as well. GOD I MISS THE NORTH COUNTRY!!! thanks again!! Dale"
1136636,Bigfishhunter,2009-09-17 20:15:00,803,Yeah for sure pm me and I will give you my email address. There is also a website where a bunch of us northern manitoba die hards post. The mod for it has a seasonal campsite on reed and he is very in tune with all of its goings on. www.xtremesportfishing.com go to the message boards.
