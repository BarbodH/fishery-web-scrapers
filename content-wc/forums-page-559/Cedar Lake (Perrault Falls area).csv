Where to stay Friday night, beer prices, when to cross border...etc.etc. Read it all, great stuff!!I read everything ehrn I searched fro Cedar Lake (great advice) on the forums and somewhere I read about the differences between the East and West leg of Cedar. (Most of this from Lonewolf, Nitro and Glenman12 ....thanks!!)A little intimidated about traveling too far the first couple of days and was wondering what y'all thought about the West leg. We are staying on the southern tip of the west leg (Northern Lights.) Virgin trip to Canada for most of us. If y'all have any tips for the West side they would be grealy appreciated. Headin up June 26th '10.Thanks and tight lines.Terwalleye"
