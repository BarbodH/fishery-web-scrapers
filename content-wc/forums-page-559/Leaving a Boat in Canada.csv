1135088,JinxCanada,2009-09-10 13:54:00,1306,if you do that and CBSA finds out about it the boat will be seized and possible charges laid. not good advice

1127948,Steve of Madison,2009-08-11 07:10:00,230,"I'm not sure if this is the correct forum, but I have a question....My brother owns a boat he would like to take to Canada and leave at another relatives property in Ontario, forever! There will be no money changing hands, just taking the boat across the border and leaving it in Ontario. We don't want any problems at the border, and also don't want to cause any problems for the retired relatives.My thoughts are re-title the boat in thier names, and register it in ontario when you get to Ontario, am I correct or is there additional paperwork?Thanks"
1128064,cbprov,2009-08-11 14:17:00,1010,"you will have to pay pst and gst on boat 12% for declared value paid at border crossing ,a $206 charge for a trailer inspection and 5% gst on declared value on trailer at border crossing and another 7% pst tax on trailer value when trailer registered for plate hope this helps"
1128177,Steve of Madison,2009-08-11 21:13:00,230,"Holy #%$*, all that to ""Give"" the retired folks a boat."
1128182,SinOrSwim,2009-08-11 21:24:00,1528,"I have no idea but could you sell them the boat while the boat is still in the US, have a bill of sale stating it was sold for say $100 and then they hired you to transport it for them? Essentially, play with the numbers so you are paying as little as possible. Might be worth the time to have them ask a local dealer or a dealer at the border who has experience transferring boats from one country to another. But, if they charge me $10.00 extra per case of beer, I can't imagine what they'll do with a boat! Oh, and make sure it's not full of potatoes"
1128184,cbprov,2009-08-11 21:30:00,1010,"i have bought many of boats in the US and brought back into Canada so i know of this first hand ,good luck ,just go up fishing for a weekend with the boat and forget it there"
1128208,Skywagon,2009-08-12 05:01:00,1106,"cbprov, that was my initial thought too, but what if they ( the retired Candian residents) are stopped on the lake while fishing and must produce the registration? Canadian residents are not allowed to operate a US registered car in Canada, I would assume the same holds true for a boat. It would be interesting if someone could make a discreet inquiry on this."
1128225,Guest,2009-08-12 06:40:00,0,"Why don't you just keep the boat in your name, keep it registered in Wisconsin and leave it up there for your folks. I keep my boat in Canada year around. Canada won't know any different."
1128568,Steve of Madison,2009-08-13 13:58:00,230,"Thanks guys, the boat has been delivered, and the folks took thier first slow stroll around the lake last night...slow...being the main theme here.The Customs agents in Canada where very helpful, understanding, and accommodating."
1128602,alanexpup,2009-08-13 17:11:00,278,"can explain fully what you mean by the customs folks being acomodating , helpful and understanding. I might need some of that some day. thanks"
1129275,Steve of Madison,2009-08-17 07:53:00,230,"We made a call to the Customs people in IF before the trip was made and explained what we wanted to do. They were very helpfull and told us exactly what to do. I will not go into detail, but suffice it to say, it was actually very simple seeing as how we were claiming the boat and trailer as $0 value and gifting it to relatives.In all of my travel's across the border, I have never been searched, or given a hard time. I always have my paperwork in order, answer the questions with a smile, be polite (not a smart @##), and keep the others in the vehicle quiet unless they are addressed. It is interesting how so many others are picked out of the line, what are they doing to put themselves in that situation."
