1115373,Mich_Fisherman,2009-06-21 20:22:00,292,"Spent last week at Lake Nagagami at Expeditions North fishing lodge. Our fishing group's first time flying into there. What an awesome fishing lake and lodge. Our party of four caught in excess of 200 fish a day with many eyes in the 23""-27"" range. There were fish taken every day in 27""-30"" range by the other groups in the camp. Some days the fishing was such that it would have been difficult to fill the limit with fish being under the 18.2"" slot. Accommodations and boats/motors were top notch with a very well run camp. Thank you David Zuhl for your hospitality. We even had a visit from the friendly CO and road check just outside of Hornepaye driving home. All and all, what a great time and great fishing!!!! Can't wait for next year...... only 51 WTWBF (Weeks Til We Be Fishing). :-)"
1116460,michmarbleeye,2009-06-25 16:50:00,11,Our paths must have crossed at the dock--we were at Expeditions North the week before you. Sounds like our quantity of fish caught may not have been as good as yours but we did catch several 27-29 inch walleyes. Outstanding fishing and camp.
1117159,Guest,2009-06-29 08:43:00,0,"Been fishing Ontario almost every year for 30 years an tried different spots. Had been on the Nagagami when Liddles had a place. Started going to Expeditions North 5 years ago. Great place, best kept secret/value we have ever found."
1118375,Ruddiger,2009-07-04 09:56:00,649,"Howdy, First, let me state that I am fortunate enough to spend five to six weeks a year going on fishing trips and have been doing so for the last 16 years. In that time I have been able to travel all over Ontario, Quebec and the mid-west and have fished on some of the most legendary lakes that the province has to offer including Lake of the Woods, Eagle, Nipissing, Kipawa, Lake St. Clair, lake Erie, the Kawarthas Lakes and numerous fly in lakes throughout north central Ontario. In that time I have focused primarily on pike, walleye, muskie and bass. Like many of you I have seen everything from great fishing at great camps to lousy fishing on over harvested lakes. I have stayed at great resorts that come as advertised as well as the ones that are run by fly by night crooks whose facilities make Saddam's spider-hole look like the Taj Mahal. In short, Ive been around. I have been fishing on Nagagami since 1995. In fact, my wife and I actually went there for our honeymoon and stayed at the Liddle's housekeeping camp. At that time it was the best fishing that I ever experienced. Since then it has only gotten better. Since 2003 I have stayed at the Expeditions-North Fishing Camp operated by Dave Zuhl. The camp is, without a doubt, the nicest place that I have ever stayed at in Canada. The cabins are amazing for a fly in and are actually nicer than most of the boat in and drive to camps that I have stayed at. That says a lot when you consider that everything needs to be flown in at great expense. The rest of the facilities at the camp are fantastic and the staff, boats, motors and dock are top notch. The corian counter top in the fish house says it all. Seriously, a corian counter top in the fish house. The fishing is the best that I have ever seen. It was great the first time I stayed on the lake in 1995 and has only gotten better since then thanks to slot limits, catch and release, and the closing of a couple of the other camps on the lake. For walleye, 100 fish days are possible at peak times. As are fish that exceed 30 inches. For pike, fast action and fish over 42 inches can be had if you know what your doing. Like anything in fishing, seasonal patters, timing and weather will impact your results and you need to be flexible throughout the open water season to experience the best of what the lake has to offer. As stated earlier, the lake really is one of the least known gems in Ontario. Furthermore, Expeditions-North is one of the best run camps in the province. For the money there is no better place to fish when it comes to a Canadian fly in experience. While I am sure that you can have world class fishing that may put Nagagami to shame on lakes like Nueltin, Reindeer, Silsby or Knee, I am also sure that you cant do so for less than $849.00 US and a 12 hour drive from Cleveland. For the average family on an average budget, this is as good as it gets. Over the last 14 years I have stayed at every resort on the lake. While they are all nice, none of them compare to Expeditions-North for overall accommodations, equipment, attention to detail, friendliness and proximity to great fishing for pike and walleye. If I didn't own a boat, and if the camp didn't have to have a two person minimum due to the aforementioned expense of flying everything in (I often fish alone), I wouldn't go anywhere else for my fishing trips. It really is that good. If you do go there be warned that karma is real so please practice catch and release, especially on the big pike with my name on it. Take care, Ruddiger"
1118472,Mich_Fisherman,2009-07-04 21:37:00,292,"Ditto, Ditto, Ditto, Ditto Ruddiger. Our group was very cautious leaving our drive in lake of 8 years for a fly-in that cost us only $100 more in total than it was in previous years at the drive in. I echo all of your comments (except for the big pike, it's mine ;-) ). I have been fishing in central northern Ontario for 25 years and never experienced the combination of fishing, accommodations, equipment, atmosphere and hospitality as experienced at Expeditions North. When we booked the trip at the Ultimate Fishing Show in Novi last year David Zuhl (camp owner) said all of the things mentioned above, and delivered. David has thought of everything from fish clean rags for the boats everyday to a hot dry sauna, equipment that is in tip top shape and everything works, chopped wood for the wood burning heater in the cabins. Adam and Mark, the dock hands are there to make the trip so enjoyable greeting you as you come in to dock the boat, filling minnow buckets, making sure you had a good day fishing and offering tips. This is truly one of the fishing gems of Ontario. 49WTWBF"
1118668,ohrings,2009-07-05 20:52:00,1,"2009 was the 4th year and 5th trip that we have made to paradise. For the last 20 years we have bounced from one lake to another, brought up one nephew and a son until they moved away, and have now started on a new generation of kids. The first trip up was monumental for me. I caught the biggest walleye in 20 years. The link to the picture of my 31' walleye is: http://www.ontarioanglerawards.com/E...m?EntryID=7414 . We also caught 82 walleye, with a few whitefish, perch and pike sprinkled in on the 2nd night in 2 1/2 hours less that a mile from the lodge. This year was Dylan's (my grandson)(the next generation of diehard fisherman) 3rd trip up. He is now 9 years old. I want to share his link to his biggest fish....a 29"" walleye that he caught on a Gander Mountain Youth rod with a closed face reel. http://www.ontarioanglerawards.com/E...?EntryID=25340 . This kid caught more fish than his dad did. Guess he takes after his grandfather I think I have created a monster fishing machine!! His younger brother is biting at the bit to come up in 2010.I reallly would like to pass on my kudos to the Zuhl family who own Expeditions North Lodge. They have done everything possible to make out trips the best we have ever had. They have the cleanest, most up to date cabins with all the anemities in them. They even have a sauna that has the greatest shower and is a great place to end the day. Their boats and electric start motors cannot be beat. Everything in the camp is connected by a wooden boardwalk. No more muddy feet on a rainy day! I thought the corian countertop at my previous home was nice....wait till you go into the fish cleaning house and use the stainless steel sinks with a corian countertop. The staff.....Mark and Adam are the greatest and go out of their way to make your trip memorable. If there is anyone who reads this and is searching for a great lake, a great lodge to stay at and many fish, this is it. Sandy Aronoff"
1131912,jigpig50,2009-08-27 08:10:00,9,"I spent a week in July on Nagagami but not at Exp. North. I found Pullens Lodge on the north end of the lake for even less money. The accomodations are very good and the hosts are some of the finest people Ive met. Ive been to 5 other places all fly ins in Ontario. If you are looking for the total solitude only cabin on the lake package, then this place is not for you. But if you want great fishing with a few other cabins at the lodge then I would highly recommend them. Their location on the north end allows fishing even on the windiest days because you can fish in the channel. And wind is a big factor on 18,000 acres. The 18 ft cedar strip boats allowed us super stability. As far as the fishing, the walleye are numerous and run up to 30"". We didnt get into any big pike but then again we really didnt fish hard for them. There are tons of places on the lake to explore with lots of structure. With only 2 other lodges on the lake pressure is light except for the 2 guys who cut us off one evening near the island .......still LMAO over that one. Overall the value and whats offered for the price we paid could not be matched. Am definetly going back."
1135364,Seanik,2009-09-11 18:38:00,218,"Jigpig50, I am looking for more information about Pullen's Lodge. We are tentavily booking a July 2010 trip and asked them to provide a modified meal plan(supper only), haven't heard back from them. Is it necessary to pack a sleeping bag or is bedding provided. You have a private message in your INbox. Seanik"
1121293,Guest,2009-07-15 20:36:00,0,"Just a note to echo the sentiments you guys have posted so far. I've known Dave and Kris a long time and knew they would do an outstanding job with their Lodge on Nagagami. Dave has a long history of fishing in Canada, and both of them have the drive to excel at whatever they do. The accomodations are outstanding, the fishing was already good and is getting better and the hospitality is second to none. What a great job they have done up there!! If you a looking for good fishing, great people and excellent accomodations, you cannot go wrong with this place. The lake is big, but with the boats and motors they have, you don't get ""lost or bored with open water fishing"". There are plenty of islands, rock piles and some great streams to fish and explore while you are there. Note: If his guests will take quality fishing to heart, and really release breeding size fish (regardless of slot limits and not just Walleye, Pike too), that fishery could be nothing short of outstanding. We were up there the third week of June this year and I have never caught and released so many large moon eye's despite the heat (kinda sunny and hot for a good part of the week). I bet we boated at least a dozen in the 24-29"" class, and probably a hundred or more below 24. We quit counting after the second day and we really only fished at night! The large pike were a little harder to find, but then the weed beds weren't up yet. If you have been looking for a new place, this one comes VERY highly recommended by us!! Great site and threads by the way, Rick & Samantha Wengert"
1125313,Guest,2009-07-31 09:18:00,0,"This was my first time to a fly in camp and it really has set the standard. Dave Zuhl runs a top notch facility: motors are flawless, the cabins are ""log cabin"" charm, and the fishing was great. I describe myself as a person that really likes to fish but not that good at it, and my buddy & always had to toss back fish. It's Walleye heaven. Some old timers in camp were routinely hooking into big northers. I didn't have that type of luck. It's the sort of place that you can comfortably take your kids (or wife) and be sure of a good/relaxed time. I highly recommend Expeditions North."
1125809,pike50plus,2009-08-02 15:31:00,584,What's the pike fishing like at this lake?? Thanks
1127616,Ruddiger,2009-08-10 07:55:00,649,"Howdy, To answer your question, yes, the pike fishing is very good. Again, its not northern Manitoba or Saskatchewan, and you have to know how to target the fish throughout the open water season, but it is very good if you know what your doing. Like most of the better lakes in Ontario is has a strong population of fish in all size classes. You fish through the smaller and medium pike as you target the larger ones. For me, a good rule of thumb is smaller suspending baits in the spring, moving up to larger muskie lures in the late summer and fall. Don't overlook using Suicks and other glide-baits in August and September. They are absolutely deadly on that lake and, for the most part, under utilized. As I stated earlier, it truly is one of the least known gems in north central Ontario. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for pike and walleye, particularly if your from Ohio, western PA, or Michigan. If you go, Expeditions-North is, by far, the best place to stay on the lake. Take care, Ruddiger"
