It is what keeps us going for the year until next time. This year we are taking a bona fide Texan with us (and of course plan to have some fun with him). The point is that we keep coming back because it is such a relief to us from ne Wisconsin. The place is a treasure - thank you, Canada, for the trip! We go because we need to iron out the wrinkles in our souls."
