I have fished a lot of the lakes around Sioux Lookout, including Lac Seul, but have never been to this end of the lake. Sounds like it is walleye & pike heaven. Bringing 3 young rookies with me - they are in for a treat. Here is my question. Are there any smallmouth on this end of the lake? I love to fish for walleye & pike but I just can't help it - I love smallmouth. They are my favorite. Any info would be appreciated."

Last year in 2 week caught about 6-7 without trying with the biggest being about 17"" most were around the 12"" mark. You will probally be better off going to another lake close by if ya just gotta have em."

531344,BuckeyeWilly,2003-05-21 17:50:00,41,"Ia Boy, going to be there the week before you. I have heard real good things about Whitewing. Have you been there before or fished this area of Lac Seul?"
531345,Guest,2003-05-21 19:16:00,0,I went to evergreen when I was 11 I am now 15. Never been to whitewing but its looks like the nicest resort on the lake cabins wise. We hammered the walleyes n pike. The thing I remeber most was when i was walking around on a island n and big moose crashed threw the woods n stomped at me n snorted.

That was bad enough, I can't imagine having a big ole moose giving me a hard time. I would have probably had to go back to the cabin and change. LOL Hey, you guys have a great trip and enjoy the beauty and wonder of Canada."
