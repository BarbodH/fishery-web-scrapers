Go 1 block eastthen turn left go through the next two lights and then you will come to a underpass, keep going under and as soon as you get to the top turn right and its third from the corner. Its called ""The Beer Store""and is open till 6pm cst time."

531289,Guest,2003-05-20 14:26:00,0,I think they roll up the sidewalk in Fort Frances around 4pm daily!!If Fort Frances has a beer store it should be open until 9 or 10 pm daily...except on Sunday's it closes at 6pm. As for the liquor store...Monday-Thursday it closes at 6pm...Friday and Saturday it closes at 9pm and Sundays it closes at 4pm.Those are the only two outlets where one can buy booze. As for gas stations...I'm sure they have a late night gas bar...not sure about a 24 hour gas station though...Good Fishing.

Don't know about across the border, I've never noticed one open when I went through at 3 or 4 am, but that just means I didn't _notice_ one.Good luck,- Rick"
