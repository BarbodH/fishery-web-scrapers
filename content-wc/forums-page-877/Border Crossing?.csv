This the camp owner sent a special note to bring Birth Cert., I.D. etc. Anyone had problems. We have no OUI's, DUI'S, (Drunk Drivers) going, so not worried about that. Will be crossing through North Dakota, heading to Lac Laronge.... Thanks for the info..... SWeed"

If you answer their questions honestly and openly, you probably will not even get checked any more than that. We were spot checked for ID verification one year, 18 people, which took about an hour at the border, but nothing to hold us back.If you have all your ducks in a row (birth certificate and permission from one parent if only one parent is going is needed for minors). Make sure your ID is handy and that is about it. Should be smooth sailing for you if nobody has any sort of mark on record. They will run the ID and send you on your merry way.Good luck on your trip!!Steve"
