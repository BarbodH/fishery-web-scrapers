530907,Guest,2003-05-11 08:35:00,0,I know a good place in Sioux Narrows. The Maple Leaf Motel telephone number 888-229-0405. We have had good bait from them in the past if you call ahead.
530908,guide7,2003-05-13 19:30:00,70,we bought them rite in ft francis last year. i think the place is calle rainy lake sports. rite on highway 11 as you are ready to leave town toward sioux lookout. We got 6 pounds for $141.00 US. price was a bit high last year with late spring crop.We have also stopped quite often in dryden at the little shop by the first lights as you come in from the south. Riverside Bait and Tackle. 807-223-2113. We paid $58.00 US for 3 pounds in 2001.I would call ahead and put your order in to be sure they can cover you when you arrive.Good Luck Guide7

530910,Karl,2003-05-21 07:49:00,63,Check out Fred & Dee's Corner convenience store/gas station. It's located 5 miles south of Sioux Lookout where the road to Hudson branches off highway 72. They are very competitivly priced.
