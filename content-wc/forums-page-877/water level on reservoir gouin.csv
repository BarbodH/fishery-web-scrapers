531348,PRD1,2003-05-21 06:32:00,458,I don't know where Gouin is but if it's in the English River or Winnipeg drainage you will get a feel for it's level at this site:http://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.htmlPaul
531349,McQ,2003-05-21 06:46:00,615,"The Gouin Reservoir is in Quebec, a couple of hundred miles north of Ottawa or Montreal. There was a special drawdown on the system this winter to allow some maintenace work. Unfortunately the spring run-off has been poor and the Gouin is about 10' below normal pool. This is causing some problems for shallow access and might make travel between certain sections difficult.I won't have a full report on the complete reservoir for a couple of weeks. This is the opening weekend and it'll take 10 - 15 days before I get sufficient reports to be able to give a total picture. One of my buddies who flies into the Gouin regularly is giving me some input and a couple of guys who are on different sections will be supplying their input too.I did have a converstion with a fellow yesterday who just came out from checking his fishing cabin in preparation for the season. He is located on Baie Adolphe and reports the level is off by at least 7'.My experience with low water on the Gouin is the spectacular fishing just gets better - they stack-up, you just have to be careful navigating around."

We fish adolph every june.How low in feet was the reservoir in june 2001, thats as low as i have seen it but we could still get out to the big water ""du Male"".I also agree with low water and good fishing , 2001 was great!"
531351,McQ,2003-05-21 11:01:00,615,Early indications are that this year is possibly the worst low water deal in seventy years. You may have to haul your boat over sand bars in some parts. I'm not sure about the pass out to Lac Du Male but the charts seem to indicate some real shallow water and maybe a blockage.
531352,nemio,2003-05-21 16:48:00,96,You're right MQ fishing will be great. Just be more careful; I spoke this morning with one of my friend and his 18 years old son went for a ride on the reservoir and he said we gone be very careful.But fishing will be fabulous.Don't spread the word...shut.... let those guys fish in western Ontario.
