530902,Northern Manitoban,2003-05-20 19:39:00,195,"Hey North of 55 i think i saw you not far from the turn into Reed lake,you have a newer ford truck your boat looked blue? i was driving a friends truck and had my white ice shack on top and pulling my Alaskan.I got into Reed lake around 11 or so in the morning.Yes the wind was nasty both days.My friend didn't enjoy the ride much.But he loved the fishing was the best he ever had.Its going to be busy at Reed this year.NM"
530903,North Of 55,2003-05-20 22:28:00,0,"Yep, that was my truck.I had site # 10.I would have stayed & fished but some blood is thinner than others!"
530892,Northern Manitoban,2003-05-19 15:22:00,195,"Kilroy i just got back from Reed lake.Blowing like crazy but was able to fish the open water for about anhour in the afternoon then gave up due to the whitecaps,caught one laker out a devils gap while there,we tried to get out of the wind so headed to the grassy where it flows into Reed fished around the outside of the river and caught one nice Pike was 38 inches but had a huge stomach probably close to 20 pounds if not all of that?wind died down a bit in the evening so fished the open water for 3 hours or so caught 15 Lake trout all were over 27 inches,biggest was 34 all were released.Headed back to camp tired of bouncing around in the high waves.This morning fished for 3 hours in behind the islands by fourmile was way to windy we were the only ones on the lake today and yesterday afternoon.Rocks all over the place be careful on your routes.Boat launch is tricky,i broke both my tail lights on my trailer launching,two big rocks my lights hit launching.I was not very happy.So looks like the bite will be good for you when you arrive water is very cold 39 in the deep spots and 44 in the shallows.Bring lots of warm clothes tryed to snow at the lake today,suppose to warm up again though.Good luck! i'll be there on the 6th can hardly wait. NM"
530893,Kilroy,2003-05-20 04:10:00,59,"Thanks for the info Dave, We have the boat all packed and ready to go except for a few odds and ends. We are going to try and get out of here some time Wed. or early Thursday, that should put us up there by Friday. You are not going back until the 6th, looks like I will miss you, as I have to be back by the 6th. Boy it must be pretty low if you busted a tailight, I cant say that I ever seen it that low, with the new rocks it will be like the first time all over again,lol. Devils gap is pretty deep if I remember right, that is one of the places I have yet to get to, we have worked most of the islands to the south of there and caught some pretty good Pike in the past. The year they had that big fire going, we hammered lots of nice pike up there. When the wind is really bad we do the 4 mile Island thing quite a bit. I seen a bunch of old timers doing some dead bait fishing by the mouth of the Grassy one year and they caught a 45"" Pike, same year we caught a 40"" pike up the river the first day the Walleye season opened on the Grassy, I suppose he was looking for some good lunch,lol.I plan on doing more Lake Trout fishing this year, I was pretty impressed with the fight that they can put up for their size. One more day of work, it is going to be the longest of the year,lol. Thanks again for the updates, I will catch up with you one of these times I am sure. We usually try to get # 43 I believe, it is right by the pump if you get there before, we will have a Black Suburban, and a Skeeter Bass boat. Good luck with them Lakers!Kilroy"
530894,Atlanta Dave,2003-05-20 05:20:00,323,Kilroy How far north is reed lake just want to use it as a gauge for Lake Athabasca. We go the 12 th of june. Thanks.
530895,Kilroy,2003-05-20 06:25:00,59,"Atlanta Dave, Reed is about 410 miles North of Winnipeg give or take if I remember right. Good Luck!Kilroy"
530896,Northern Manitoban,2003-05-20 09:46:00,195,Good luck and maybe one day we will hook up on Reed.Who knows maybe next week wednesday or thursday i have off i can take a run out there?i placed my ice shack on my site 38 have beds inside so works great.Good people running the camp office this year.NM
530897,Guest,2003-05-20 16:09:00,0,How deep did you fish for the lakers? What lure did you catch them on?
530898,Northern Manitoban,2003-05-20 16:51:00,195,"We were in 80 feet of water fishing down around 15 feet.Using a deepsix #1 diver and a Northern king silver spoon.Did catch some in the shallow bays and shorelines but they are always smaller there,the bigones seem to stick with staying over the deep water.NM"
530899,Guest,2003-05-20 17:12:00,0,I may have to give that a try. I was planning to fish Simonhouse next week. Any thoughts about Reed vs. Simonhouse??
530900,Northern Manitoban,2003-05-20 18:07:00,195,"Why not both? i have yet to fish Simonhouse as i hear its good for walleye and pike,thought about doing it this year as i'll be at Reed most of the summer as i have a seasonal site there and Simonhouse is not far away.If you decide to fish Reed for Lakers you don't have to go far get a map even checkout the big map on the board beside the boat launch it will show you the whole lake head for the bigwater past fourmile island towards devils gap thats where the deep water is troll right out in the middle,its full of bait fish (ciscos) and along the islands its all up and down and deep.I would recomend if your there in june when the water is still cold get some deepsixes or dipsys for getting your lines down.Downriggers fished at the same depth don't catch anywhere near the same amount of Lake trout.I don't know why but it happens every year.The guys using the deepsix divers catches more then the guy using the downrigger even fished at the same depth.Its weird but has been that way for the last 5 years fishing there and happend again this last weekend.The only time the downrigger out performed the deepsix was middle of summer when you need to be right on the bottom.Change your speeds while trolling fast and slow and make turns.Try and fish around 10 to 20 feet that seems to be where they were.Once you find them the action is steady.Reed also has great walleye and huge Pike so you can fish for everything.Its worth the try,but be careful for the rocks.good luck.Let us know what you decide and how you do. NM"
530901,North Of 55,2003-05-20 18:51:00,0,"Hey NM,missed you at Reed this weekend!Weather was a bit too chilly for the girlfriend so i didn't get alot of fishing time in.Actually fished for two hours on Saturday & caught a couple lakers down at the SW end near the Krug.Marked some lunkers at 40' but couldn't stay on top of them because of the wind.On the way back to camp waves were 4-5' range.The boat handled like a dream & took the big water no problem,but the girlfriend on the other hand,was pretty much on the floor hiding!Still a big icepack at the NW end about 2 miles long if anybody needs ice for beverages.Think i might wander to Reed next Monday for some serious fishing(without the better half).Was out at Paint today & got my limit in the N.Grassy.The spawn still isn't over.Males only & full of milk.Lots of good size northerns.2-39ers today & a buddy of mine released a 41"" two days ago."
530882,North Of 55,2003-05-10 22:04:00,0,"I heard today that Reed Lake is breaking up.I am calling a friend in Snow Lake tommorrow to find out for sure.I cancelled my trip to Athapap,so i'm going to Reed next Friday.Can't wait to boat my first fish of the open water season!Had my new Lund out on the Burntwood river today breaking in the new Opti.At 3/4 throttle i'm getting 49 MPH ground speed on the Gps.Running a 19 pitch on 135 Opti/MR.PIKE 18 & at 5500 RPM i still have about 4"" left on throttle.Going to try another pitch prop to prevent over rev."
530883,Northern Manitoban,2003-05-10 22:10:00,195,Hey Chad sounds like a nice boat? I think Reed should be almost open i heard Simonhouse was and last week Wekusko was open along ways off shore from the highway side.I'm at Reed on Sunday setting up camp.NM
530884,North Of 55,2003-05-10 22:31:00,0,"Freaked me out to hear my real name.Who is this?Anyways,the boats a dream.Going out again tommorrow at around 1:00 if you want to see her!"
530885,Kilroy,2003-05-12 03:15:00,59,"You guys save me a fish will you, I plan on being on Reed Lake Friday the 23rd, Lord willing and the creek dont rise,lol. Kilroy"
530886,Northern Manitoban,2003-05-12 18:02:00,195,"Chad its me Dave,the Refinery guy lol.I heard the guys talking at work about your boat then i seen the posts here from someone from Thompson with the same boat so i figured it out.Darcy from the smelter was telling me on Sat,you were trying her out on the Burntwood river.Kilroy good luck for those Pike on Reed,watch for Reefs going to be a bad year for those on the lakes this year,we need the RAIN! NM"
530887,North Of 55,2003-05-13 04:07:00,0,"Hey Dave,talked with natural resources in Cranberry Portage yesterday & Reed Lake still has ice on it & will need some luck to fish there on Saturday!They told me to call back today to get more details as they had staff there getting the campground clean.Athapap is also unboatable right now.I was out canoeing on Paint Lake yesterday.Ice was 40' off shore & if the weather keeps up it could be boatable by Sunday.Talk to ya later."
530888,Bobby,2003-05-14 11:15:00,211,"OK, guys, that's enough about the lakes up north, I'm starting to get really jealous. Since I've been transferred down to southern MB things haven't been the same... Looking forward to my trip to Clearwater first week of June. Still thinking about Reed later in the summer, especially after seeing that 35"" laker Dave caught. I went out and bought a bunch of the bigger Northern King spoons after that!!!Was at the Duck Mtns this past weekend and caught a MA Rainbow and MA Splake. Heading back up this weekend for Browns. If I get up to Reed for lakers this July or August, are there a lot of reefs to watch out for? I bought a map and it looks like a minefield.""Hold on to the boat, boys, she's gonna ram us!"""
530889,Northern Manitoban,2003-05-14 19:56:00,195,"Yes there is allot of reefs.just off the boat launch by the Islands.And they are scatterd throughout the Lake.Take it slow your first day talk to the people there they are always willing to help out an angler,maybe even me lol? definetely get yourself a map.And if your around Reed this summer stop in at my seasonal site #38 if i'm around and i'll maybe even have some cold ones? a GPS would really come in handy also. NM"
530890,Kilroy,2003-05-16 15:11:00,59,"Well, 2 more working days, then the 2 week vacation, looks like maybe the Ice will be off this weekend. That means the Pike should be biteing pretty good and the Lakers will be shallow for awhile. It is so close I can taste it. If anybody makes it out there to Reed this weekend, give me a jingle back here and let me know if the ice is all gone for sure. I am kinda interested to hear how that New Lund Pike handles the rough waters, it is my plan to buy a new one next year, I really like the size,and layout of the 17' Pike.Kilroy"
530891,Northern Manitoban,2003-05-17 19:30:00,195,"Lakes are ICE FREE! i'll be at Reed lake in the morning setting up my camp and will stay overnight coming back monday afternoon.Hope those Lake trout are hungry and might try for some walleyes,just hope the wind dies down been gail force winds all ##### week,fire hazards high no fires until after 8:00 P:M,had one wicked forest fire just on the edge of town here Thompson Manitoba 4 water bombers all day to put it out cooled off now and trying to rain.NM"
