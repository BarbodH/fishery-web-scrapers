531294,Guest,2003-05-19 20:11:00,0,"In case you change your mind, we usually stop at the LCBO on Dawson Rd/Hwy 102 near the mall. If you can't find what you want there, just cross Hwy 11 and Dawson becomes Red River Rd. I think that the Beer Store is within a couple of blocks. http://ca.maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?...t=&mag=9&off=w"
