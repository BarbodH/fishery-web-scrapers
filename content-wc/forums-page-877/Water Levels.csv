Very little improvement will be seen until the basin starts to receive some significant rainfall. While Lake of the Woods had record high inflows in June and July last year, which resulted in high water levels, conditions since then have been very dry. Over the period November 2002 through May 15 of this year, precipitation over the area draining into Lake of the Woods was the second lowest on record since the early 1900s. As a result, in spite of reduced outflows, Lake of the Woods is the lowest it has been since 1981. Lac Seul is also at its lowest level since 1981. The current level of Lake of the Woods is 322.38 m (1057.7 ft). The level rose less than 1 cm (0.4 in) over the previous week and is expected to change little over the next week. Lake of the Woods outflow is 150 m3/s. The level of Lac Seul is 354.55 m (1163.2 ft). The level rose 5 cm (2 in) over the past week and is expected to rise 3 to 5 cm over the next week. Lac Seul outflow is 50 m3/s. If further information is required, please call toll-free to the Board's Secretariat at 1-800-661-5922."
