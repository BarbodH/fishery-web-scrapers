I am thinking of bringing maybe 1 1/2 cases of beer and a 6 pack of 8 pack of the ""Ice's"". Will I be able to cross w/o paying duty? Thanks.:)"
530914,Guest,2003-05-13 14:20:00,0,"A wine cooler is consider to be hard booze to the customs agent and will be treated as such. So one person could bring one of the following: Here's what you are allowed to bring in with you duty-free [no extra charge]: 200 cigarettes 50 cigars 7 ounces of tobacco 1.1 liters of wine, wine coolers or liquor [21 or over] 24 12-ounce bottles of beer [21 or over] Gifts valued at no more than $60 CDN So you can bring your beer and she can bring up to 1.1 liters of wine coolers before you ahve to pay duty. The duty is not that much more to pay anyway."

530917,Guest,2003-05-14 11:12:00,0,They got the same wine coolers in Canada. Buy it there. That way you can bring 2 cases of beer for yourself.
530918,Guest,2003-05-14 12:23:00,0,They might consider wine coolers to be hard liquor.. But your smirnoff Ice is a malt beverage there for a beer! 5% alcohol by volume so just tell them it is a beer! We brought up a case of them last year. The problem for us is it just weighs to much for the plane!!
530915,Guest,2003-05-19 15:46:00,0,"Actually each can bring 1.5 liters of wine. (=2 750ML bottles of wine.) http://www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca/E/pub/cp/...html#P129_4845 Most ""wine coolers"" arent really wine coolers any more. They are pretty much all malt beverages. Even the old original Bartles and James brand,who I believe were 1st to market wine coolers many years ago."
530919,TangledAngler,2003-05-20 07:12:00,65,"Smirnoff Ice is not a wine cooler. Check the label. It is a malt beverage and, believe it or not, is a beer. Now, getting the authorities to believe that is a different question."
530920,Thumper,2003-05-20 08:05:00,133,"Yeah, about 22lbs a case for cans (beer). Even more for bottles."
530921,phidelt157,2003-05-20 08:37:00,191,a case of beer weighs 22 lbs??????????
