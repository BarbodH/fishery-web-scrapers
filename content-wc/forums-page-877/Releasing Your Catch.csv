I know many of you will plan to release many of the fish you catch. I just wanted to review a few points on the proper release of your catch when you choose to do so. Please feel free to add any points that I might miss.1) Use a net only when it's the best way to control your fish, otherwise ""cradle"" it and lift it with your hands.2) Release the fish back into the water carefully as opposed to throwing it back in.3) To calm a fish that you are holding, turn it on it's back. Otherwise cradle large fish with one hand at the front and the other hand supporting the tail. Never put you fingers in the gill or eye sockets, and don't squeeze the fish.4) Handle the fish with wet hands in order to do less damage to its protective slime.5) Be quick about it. A fish can hold its breath about as long as you can. On top of that, your fish has just fought their way to the surface, so that's kind of like you and me running around the block and then being asked to hold our breath. Have that camera ready for those Kodak moments.6) Bottom line, be careful and be quick. I've seen many angelers posing with their catch, only to drop it in the bottom of the boat. Without the support of water, that's like you and me being dropped from a ten story building.It's our ""reuseable"" resource. Please take care of it.Good luck on the water!"
