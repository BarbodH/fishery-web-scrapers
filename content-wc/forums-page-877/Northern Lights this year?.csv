The best odds and most numerous occurances are usually during the peak of the 11 year sunspot cycle,as the solar activity that causes the lights is quite high. We are on the downside of that cycle,going towards a null. But Solar flares can occur any time and cause lights. The closer you are to the north pole the better the odds of viewing when they occur."
531006,Hammerhead Herb,2003-05-13 08:23:00,259,"Does anyone have an idea where we are on the Northern Lights cycle this year. The best display that I saw was in early June of 1991. I understand that they are on an 11 to 12 year cycle; yet in the past 2 - 3 years I haven't seen a display as sectacular as the 1991 display.Articles that I've read lead me to believe that the peak for this cycle was in the year 2000; yet I didn't think that they were anywhere near as great as '91. My location is right on the 51st parrallel; about 20 miles east of the Manitoba/Ontario border. If it is a good year, I might take up some photography equipment to take time exposures."
531007,phishfearme,2003-05-13 09:55:00,1242,"herb - i bought a new camera about 9 years ago in order to take some borealus shots and we haven't seen anything since. according to our local observatory, that cycle thing is just a theory and is based on observations that vary widely. we can only hope this year. the observatory gave me some camera settings if you're interested - these are for the average brightness of the borealus (f-stop setting, exposure - in seconds - for 200 asa film, exposure for 400 asa film): 1.4,5,3; 1.8,7,4; 2.0,20,10; 2.5,40,20; 3.5,60,30. good luck,bob"
531008,Guest,2003-05-13 10:50:00,0,"Last September, Lynn Lake area of Northwestern Manitoba, they were fantastic, the best i've ever seen, almost every night I was there, which was the first week in September. But that is close to the 56th ."
531011,Karl,2003-05-13 18:28:00,63,"There is a major and a minor cycle of solar flare activity which causes to ""northern lights"". You are correct with the 11 year cycle and I don't remember the other cycle. Check NASA's website.Last year was the first time I went in August (Sioux Lookout, 51 north latitude) and was also the first time I saw northern lights. It never gets dark (past twilight) in June, and in July not until after 1:00AM. Too late for me. It was also the week before the peak of the Perseid meteor shower and I never saw so many and so many big ones. It was impressive."

531013,Guest,2003-05-14 19:01:00,0,"Best time to see the Northern Lights is during the fall, not really sure why but this is the most active time I see them and they seem to be far superior at that time of the year."
531014,Guest,2003-05-14 20:57:00,0,"Believe this or not. We had a power outage a few weeks ago here in my area of Kenora. at 3am. I got up and looked off my balcony and saw the best Northern Lights I have ever seen in my life. The very best I ever saw was in Thompson Mb. years ago. Then the Arctic also. I spend a few weeks out on the lake LOTW, and they are visible very well from August on..A fantastic sight even if seen a million times."
531009,Guest,2003-05-16 20:35:00,0,"hoosiercanadian I saw them last year in the first week of Sept too. Aperently it was part of a big solar flare from the sun that hit the atmosphere all over earth. I follow the lights pretty close on www.spaceweather.com, it's a great site, lots of pictures too.Cheers and good fishing!!!!!CoolB"
531010,Guest,2003-05-17 17:38:00,0,"Since it was my first trip to the Lynn Lake area, I thought seeing them almost every clear night was normal, apparantly I just happened to get lucky, anyway I stood on the dock and watched them as long as I could. I love watching the sky, and these were the most incredible things i've ever seen, coming in waves, and changing colors, I was awestruck, i've seen them before in northwestern Ontario and even a little here in southern Indiana in the winter. Can't wait to get back up there!"
531015,Northern Manitoban,2003-05-17 19:24:00,195,"The Northern Lights here in Northern Manitoba can be seen all summer,Reed lake is one place that i have seen one of the best shows,i can imagine Lynn lake area would be awesome also,You will see them around here all year.I just hope the skies are clear tommorrow when i'm at my camp at Reed lake for one night.Lake trout time."
