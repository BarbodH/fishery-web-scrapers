531260,Stevie B,2003-05-20 07:16:00,157,"I fish Longbow about 4-5 times a summer. I find that it is a really easy lake to fish. There is really no chance of getting lost. But if you are looking for a good map then go to www.canadamapsales.com. I just picked up a map of that area. Which includes LOW and has depths, rocks, etc. It was waterproof and coastgaurd approved. It was only $20.00can I believe.When are you heading up that way?Fish ON!!Fish ON!!"
531261,Stevie B,2003-05-20 07:19:00,157,"Tony, I just checked your profile, are you any relation to John Jerina? I have been coresponding with him about the same lake. Just wondern'.Fish ON!!"
531262,tjsker,2003-05-20 20:29:00,301,"John Jerina?Yes, he's my cousin. But try to keep it a secret. We don't like to associate with such rif-raf. LOL"
531263,BD,2003-05-21 05:07:00,739,"I second the post for www.canadamapsales.com It is a government of Manitoba internet store. You can get lake maps for Manitoba and Ontario there, and quads for all of Canada."
