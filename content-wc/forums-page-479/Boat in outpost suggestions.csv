Cabins are complete with indoor plumbing. You can bring your own boat or use the ones they have. You need a 40HP to boat in. The only drawback for you would be all the cabins are at the same spot. It's still really remote (40 miles from town) and you can find places to fish with no company. Check out their website. Ken and Brenda and their crew are A+ in service."

1257611,WalleyeWally28,2010-12-24 12:58:00,298,BigsaugerHow many are in your group?
1258395,Bigsauger,2010-12-29 20:22:00,12,Walleyewally28 - we will most likely have between 4-6 guys going.Thanks everyone for all of the advice. I'll look into each of the options recommended. If anyone else has any thoughts I would appreciate it.
1258644,WalleyeWally28,2010-12-31 07:48:00,298,"Bigsauger - I asked about the number in your group because, based on your criteria, I had an idea that you might enjoy. My Wife and I stay at Whitewing Resort near Ear Falls on Lac Seul. They have a houseboat (floating lodge) available that looks really cool for a group. It's completely self contained with all the comforts and conveniences of a cabin. They pull your fishing boats behind to the parking spot. The boat is parked in a very protected and secluded area right in the middle of the best fishing areas in the western half of Lac Seul. The boat is tied fore and aft and they set up a ramp to walk on to the shore. I've talked to several people that were just coming back from spending a week and they all raved about the great fishing and how much fun it was. There is a minimum charge so you would have to determine if it would work for your group. If I can be of anymore help, just ask.www.whitewingresort.com"
1259298,Mike Kansas,2011-01-03 13:09:00,1463,"Lac Seul Lodge....Has two great boatin outposts. Have been fishing their Black Bay Outpost for years and it is awesome fishing. Call early they may already be booked up with repeat customers. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1323187,winston123,2011-06-27 12:24:00,13,"I am not a huge fan of Whitewing. The deckhand Terry was difficult to work with. I don't think he is there anymore but not sure. Also, the owner didn't really want to give you the time of day. He made it seem that customers we a bother with his ability to get things done. We are not high maintenance people at all so I am confident the issues were with him."
1323199,wolverine fan,2011-06-27 12:38:00,71,We stayed at Sand Lake Outpost in Minaki a few years ago and really enjoyed the solitude and fishing. Good luck
1323215,teddi,2011-06-27 13:14:00,349,try skline lodge on florence lake. they have a boat in outpost on cristene lake off lac seul. the fishing is great and the rates are cheap.
1323245,camp chef,2011-06-27 14:10:00,915,Anglers Kingdom on Nungesser Lake north of Red Lake. I was there in the fall of 2007 and look forward to going back again sometime
1323255,The Donger,2011-06-27 14:22:00,48,Goose Bay Camp in Ear Falls has a boat in outpost on Nungesser Lake. We had a group of 6 in there in late May last year. Nice cabin and the oputfitter was super accomodating. Walleye and Northern fishing were very good. That said there are a number of lodges and outposts on Nungesser so you are going to have company but the outpost cabin is in a secluded location.
1324624,Bigiver,2011-06-30 19:16:00,94,"Ditto on what Wolverine Fan had to say about Sand Lake Outpost on Big Sand Lake at Minaki. We have only been staying there for three years but we have been fishing there for over twenty and the fishing has always been good. But the solitude and views from the outpost cabins makes it better than five star. And to top it off, Rob is a just a wonderful and accomadating person."
1256482,Bigsauger,2010-12-19 16:13:00,12,"Does anyone have any good boat in outpost suggestions? My group likes to get away from people but one of the guys is a little reluctant to fly. We like outpost cabins, not camps, as the solitude associated with having the place to yourself is one of the best parts of the trip.Any thoughts or recommendations would be appreciated.Thanks."

1256595,Gary from Iowa,2010-12-20 04:27:00,74,"A while ago there was a discussion about a boat in cabin on St. Joseph's Lake operated by Winoga Lodge. I believe its a newer cabin and requires 6 people and can be accessed by air or by the operator's barge. It is tricky finding your way, so the operator takes you in. St. Joseph's is a barbless hook and 1 hook (a treble hook counts as a single hook) fishery. There are other outposts on St. Joseph's-one by Slate Falls Outfitters- but I don't know if they are boat in or flyin. Good luck fishing.Gary"
1256626,wallydave,2010-12-20 06:56:00,2151,"Check out www.winelakecamp.comThey have a boat-in cabin. Ghost River is another boat-in but they have quite a few cabins, but they offer quite a few lakes to fish also. ""google boat-in camps for more sites. Good luck!"

1257366,Guest,2010-12-23 07:44:00,0,I was very happy with Discovery Lake Lodge near Sioux Lookout. They have two boat in modern outposts that are wonderful (and the only cabin on the lake). One has great walleye and pike fishing and the other has excellent Lake Trout (Zarn) and Pike fishing with a short portage to another lake for fantastic walleye. The prices are very reasonable as well and the fishing and average size of fish was better than any of the flyins.
1257369,Guest,2010-12-23 07:48:00,0,To add to the above......I meant fly ins that I've been on in Northern Ontario with other outfitters.
1257603,GNO,2010-12-24 12:06:00,153,We have a boat in outpost on Pipestone Lake that offers a some great multi species fishing. http://www.gatewaynorthoutfitters.net/pipestone.html There are also some outposts on Jackfish Lake that might fit what you are looking for too.
