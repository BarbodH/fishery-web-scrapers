My buddy and I caught over 650 Pike, Walleye, Lake Trout, Grayling, and a bonus Brown trout. From the time we hit the lake, first Pike was 45 inches, and real thick, we caught fish after fish. Our Cree Indian guide, had us moving from one hot spot to another the entire trip. The lodge was great, cabins were a bit RUSTIC, and needed upgrading, but the accommodations were comfortable and clean. The meals were great, outfitter was great, would return just to experience the fishing. The Lures of the week, were the Williams Wobbler(Any color) Blue Fox#6 gold, and the ""Secret Weapon"" were 10"" white worms on a bass or c hook. What a memorable trip.."
