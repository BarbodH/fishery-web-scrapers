I know that it is on the Great Lakes chip which I happen to have and only discovered on the last day of a trip 3 years ago when I saw someone on the next dock over looking at the map.....the Great Lakes chip is $300 for the Plat Plus. A friend of mine just bought a new HDS unit for his first trip to Minaki with us next month (first time to Canada actually) and I didn't have the heart to break the news to him about the map. So, is the Great Lakes chip the only answer? If so, can Navionics SD card chips be copied? Of course, I am only asking that question simply because I am curious. I would never suggest or attempt to try to copy a chip because it WOULD BE ILLEGAL!!! I'm just sayin. Steve"

It has the Winipeg River up to and including Big Sand and Little Sand. And the N-5 is less money. It also jumps up and covers some of the West of Lac Suel. If you run a search you can find more discussion on this from last year."
