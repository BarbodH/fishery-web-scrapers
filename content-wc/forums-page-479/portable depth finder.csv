1325413,Walleye Wanderer,2011-07-02 23:36:00,101,"A couple of years ago I spotted a great deal on a new Humminbird that I just couldn't pass up. Luckily I had an old Eagle portable which I quickly cannibalized and used the box to mount the Humminbird on. I mounted the base of the Humminbird by drilling four holes in the Eagle case and attaching the base with stainless hardware including some large flat washers to provide support and also sealed everything with silicone. The Eagle case holds two square 6 volt batteries which last a entire week plus if you use it all day. The Humminbird base swivels and tilts so the display is always easy to read and the transducer cord is long enough to move the finder to the bow in case my boat mate gets bored and wants to watch the TV. Last tweak was to solve the suction cup issue. I took a Tit-Lok transducer mount and drilled and tapped it for 2 stainless bolts to attach a Berkley rod holder. Although the picture doesn't show it, the rod holder swivels to any degree in a 360 degree fashion to allow the proper angle and height for trolling. I have been looking at the next step, mounting a side imaging GPS/Finder combo to something like a Pelican waterproof box. I'll keep you posted how that goes..."
1325479,rnnonmt,2011-07-03 08:43:00,992,I have had favorable results from Humminbirds 570 portable for a few years on Lac Seul. I recently upgraded to the 597 ci hd di and converted it to the portable back pack bag that the 570 came in. Its a good little setup. Very portable an no tangle of wires. One wire for the transducer comes out of the backpack. Thats it. The 570 lasted about 2 days on the 7AMP battery. The 597 about a day and half. If you are half mechanically inclined like most fisherman are you can convert any model to portable (within reason) Good Luck

1304607,tight line,2011-05-09 10:12:00,37,Solopaddler If are tackle boxes look the same I might as well have the same depth finder but Cabelas is sold out of that model.I guess I'll have to buy something different.Only 7 weeks to go I cant wait.Thanks again for all the help.Good luck and post some pictures if you get time.

1308330,MorganMan,2011-05-17 22:56:00,341,"I have used a couple units over the years, most recently an X85 Lowrance...I'm sure its not made anymore. I have come to realize that the biggest need for any unit up there is for depth, not any sort of accuracy with marking fish for the most part. We are not usually in deep enough water for many fish to enter the cone. We can find the fish if we find the structure we are looking for. I'm sure others may argue, but any unit that is light and gives you accurate depth should work just fine. We bring a small inverter and recharge batteries off the battery bank from the solar setup at our outpost....doesn't drain our lights or any power. Also, DO tie your transducer cord to the handle on the back of the boat or something to keep it from not only going into the drink, but more importantly, the prop!"

1308769,phishfearme,2011-05-18 19:34:00,1242,morganman is right on the money - find the structure and you've found the fish - no need for exotic electronics up north. 240 verticle pixels are plenty and the cost of these is reasonable given that 320 pixels is common now. borrow somebody's and give it a try. phish
1309118,fishman10,2011-05-19 16:44:00,226,"i have switched to a wood mounted transducer and c-clamp it on thr transom. my suction cup fell off once with a 50hp and even though it was tied on, it ripped the transducer off, leaving the wires. expensive lesson learned."
1303984,tight line,2011-05-07 12:41:00,37,we are going to Beteau lake with Eddie North outfitters in late june.I have a 110 fishing buddy depth finder.I was thinking of buying a new unit.Anyone have any advice on what to buy or is what I have good enough.
1303993,Jack77,2011-05-07 13:21:00,168,The only problem with your model is that it doesn't work that well when the boat is moving even at normal trolling speeds. There are several portable fish finders that start around $150.00. We use a couple Hummingbird portables that works very well. Take a look at Cabelas-http://www.cabelas.com/catalog/searc...h-All+Products
1303995,polaris-pete,2011-05-07 13:45:00,343,I have used my Humminbird Piranah Max for the last 5 years on Canadian trips. It has worked flawlessly and at all boat speeds.Very easy on the rechargeable batterty also. I can get 2 full days on a single charge ( providing you have electric). Good Luck.
1304157,tight line,2011-05-08 05:56:00,37,I was looking at the Piranha max 230.They talk about the wireless remote I am assuming that is the device that looks like a small green sub.What purpose does this serve?
1304206,GOBIG,2011-05-08 08:13:00,126,"I use the humminbird 140c for the past 3 years. Works well trolling, or just sitting still. I used coupons form dick's sporting good and paid around 200.00 for it. No suction cups, easy to read, easy to operate. The others in the party now all have them for this year. I do not thing you will be sorry for buying this one, just look for coupons or a deal...it works well for us.."
1304456,TIGHTLINER,2011-05-09 03:59:00,223,Going to eddie's north late august would like a report on wc as to fishing and and set up he has. I bought a fishing buddy 140c saw several others in a camp last year and they were all very happy with them. No heavy batteries no wires in the boat and easy to operate. Might be a big improvement over the 110 . Have a great time looking forward to the fishing report.
1304461,Mike Borger,2011-05-09 04:39:00,1554,"I've fished Eddie's camp twice before. Most of your fishing is visual: casting weedy back bays for pike and fishing current/rapid areas for walleye. You could fish that camp effectively without a finder. That said I wouldn't be caught dead up there without one. They're invaluable for a whole bunch of reasons. Word to the wise. For whatever reason suction cups don't work that great on Eddie's boats. Mine popped off last trip at high speed and dragged my entire unit into the river. My buddy stripped down, jumped in the icy water and retrieved it thank goodness. I highly recommend screwing the transducer to a small piece of strapping and clamping it to the boat with a couple of C clamps. As far as finders go I bought this unit late last year and love it so far. Cheap and works like a charm for my purposes:http://www.cabelas.com/product/Eagle...h-All+Products My group is heading up to Eddie's May 20th, first group in camp. Can't wait."
1304475,phishfearme,2011-05-09 05:30:00,1242,"suction cups don't work because the aluminum boat surfaces are scratched - we always bring some sandpaper and steel wool and a minute's work improves things significantly. BUT - the suction cup can still come off - that's why there's a cord on the suction cup to tie off on the boat handles. then if (when) the cup comes off, it only flops around and doesn't drag the unit into the drink. once burned, twice learned! for flyins where there's typically no power, rechargable batteries are not that practicle - the 8 D-cells needed for my eagle last our entire 10 day trip - and then the rest of the year back home. phish"
1304498,Mike Borger,2011-05-09 06:56:00,1554,I always wondered what that cord was for. For those that are wondering Eddie's camp is wired with electrical outlets and has generators. No problems charging anything.
1304513,Larry S,2011-05-09 07:26:00,665,"My Depth finder uses 8 AA Batteries,you can take an extra set with you,no problem. Good suggestion on bringing steel wool and sandpaper fish. Will bring them on our trip to Kearns Lake"
