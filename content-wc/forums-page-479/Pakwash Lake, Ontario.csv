1325927,Plaidpooka,2011-07-04 19:47:00,3,"Hello all!My fiancé and I are all set to leave on Thursday for a fishing trip in Ontario. I've been going through my tackle box, buying new line, and reading about fishing online. Basically just getting all excited about the trip and wishing we were leaving right now! That's how I stumbled upon Walleye Central.I've been going to fish in Canada every year or so since I was 10. For the past 14 years or so we've been going to Pakwash Lake. It's in the Red Lake/ Ear Falls area. Snake Falls Camp is great; the folks who run it are friendly and hospitable.I'll make sure I let you all know how the fishing is when I get back. We usually go up a little earlier than this, but we had to postpone this year until July. Here's hoping we don't get 95 degree weather, as happened to us once before when fishing this late. So far, it looks like mid 70's, which sounds all right to me.Anyone else ever fished in the area? I see someone is going to Lac Seul, which we pass on the way up. We've talked about trying Lac Suel sometime for Muskies, but we like the less strict fishing regulations at places like Pakwash. We are all for conservation to keep the waters hoppin with fish, but we aren't sportsmen, we like to catch and eat rather than catch and release.Pakwash is great for northern, walleye, and perch. Bass as well. But not much for muskie. There's actually a pic of a small muskie caught on Pakwash this June, and I think it's the first proof I've seen of one there! I don't care one way or the other. I'm a northern and walleye girl, myself. But my fiancé's never seen a muskie, and he'd like to catch one someday.If anyone's been in the area recently, let me know how the fishing was! It's so close to our trip that I just want to talk about fishing!Julianne aka Pook"
1325962,jkwildhunting,2011-07-04 21:45:00,361,Good Luck. We are headed up Friday and will be north of ya at Gull Rock!We fished pakwash my first year ever in Canada. Probably 8 years ago. Caught ok ammount of fish but didnt really get to fish the way I wanted to which is pulling spinners had to many in boat. We got talked into tryin Gull Rock the next year and the numbers of eyes and quality of fish seemed to be better so we have Stuck with Gull Rock.Good Luck with your trip and hope to see a report/pics from your trip!

Now we know the lake well enough that we know the good spots, which is a benefit of fishing the same lake for years. Either lake, it's a beautiful part of the country. Have an awesome time at Gull Rock, and bring back lots of pics!"

Fishing started out a little slow for our week but we were finding them and caught plenty - just not as many bigger ones. The fishing was picking up toward the end of the week and should be great for you. There was a rather annoying - and unusual - runoff of some sort from storms before we got there and the water was murky coming out of the trout river. That messed up a lot of our go-to spots on the north end of the lake. When we got into clear water, the fishing was better. And the Chukuni was running pretty clear by the middle of our week. It sounds like you have some good spots but I can share a couple of mine if you want to private message me. Have a great trip!"
