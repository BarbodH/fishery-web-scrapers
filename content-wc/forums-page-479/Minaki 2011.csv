1311191,DonC,2011-05-25 13:53:00,93,"ChuckE, That is amazing to me that some fish 5 a.m. to 8 p.m. straight. I get to go fishing here in TN alot, and have a place on Lake Barkley in KY also, so I am not motivated to push it to the limit in Canada. I will fish up to lunch, have a break and nap, fish from 2 to 6 p.m. or so, and fish 1 1/2 hours after dinner at times. Most persons who know I fish think I am a fishing nut. I am not in the same league as your first crew though. I am more like your second group. You must be the ""tour guide"" for organizing the trips. I hope they appreciate what you do. I serve that function also. If I did not do it, the trips would not happen. I am constantly searching for people to go on the trip. I request they bring someone to fish with and be considerate of those who want to sleep. I have often wondered what having a place up there would be like. I think Aaron or someone who posts here does have a place. Sounds like a great time you all have though, Don"
1312252,Guest,2011-05-28 18:45:00,0,"Don, good to hear you are still going even if your group has gotten smaller. I will be heading up the week prior to the Labor day weekend. Our group is usually around 5-6 guys but this year we may have 2-3 new [younger] guys coming. Guess who gets to carry the trolling motor and battery down to the boat? I will watch for your report when you get back. To bad you can't use some of those Tennessee Cicida's for bait."
1312769,DonC,2011-05-30 17:29:00,93,"Randy, Good to hear your group is going. We are supposed to have a banner cicada year in Tennessee. I wonder what customs will think when they hear 200 cicada's buzzing in the gear. They probably never heard that sound in the far north. Wonder what I should say to the custom officers. Do you fish smallmouth late August at all? Don"
1313050,briand,2011-05-31 12:34:00,48,"For those who are interested the water is up about 18"""
1325821,Guest,2011-07-04 13:00:00,0,"Don, We have a well defined plan for fishing Minaki. I have made a detailed spread sheet for what we need. Cabin items, boat items, personal items and everyone gets a copy. When we finally get there we find the following always happens. We throw every lure we have. We use the wrong lure for the type of fish that are biting. We forget to bring at least one important/critical item like charcoal lighter fluid, had to use half of my bottle of rum. Somebody is going to get very wet. And the guy with the oldest/cheapest fishing gear will catch the biggest fish. And we can't wait to come back next year. We have never targeted smallmouth bass. Caught some last year though, lots of fun. I was in Middle Tennessee in late May and the cicada were real bad. It was like hitting a small bird when they hit the windshield. Felt sorry for the Harley guys on I-40. For some reason they all seemed to have a green tint to their teeth. Think what it would be like if they crossed a cicada with those black fly's in Canada."
1309046,DonC,2011-05-19 13:49:00,93,"Well, Myself with 2 other fisherman will make our annual trip to Minaki June 11 at Birch Island Resort. Looking forward to the smallmouth, with some walleye and crappie also. I have made 50+ trips to Ontario since 1988. I have been the one to get the trips together. Times have changed. I usually have 10-16 going, but this year only have 3. At one time I had around 30 possible for this trip, with 10-12 ""definites"". Anyway, it is great to get back to the Winnipeg River and spend a week fishing. I will post a report when I get back. Any reports from others going to Minaki are fun to read. Hope all have a great trip. Don"
1309107,Guest,2011-05-19 16:20:00,0,"Glad to hear you got a group heading that way. Well be there the following 2-1/2 weeks. We are down to 3 the first week as well, but jump up to 5 after that. Family and health issues seem to be affecting the group the past few years. I guess that's to be expected the older we all get."
1309343,briand,2011-05-20 09:35:00,48,"We were up there last weekend, but only to put the boat in to head to little vermillion.The lakers were in 5' - 10' of water in the sandy shallow bays.Perhaps this weekend, but not likely until the water warms will we go for walleye.But something about walking 1 km at times in 8"" of mud, over fallen trees, bugs, and it always seems like your going up hill ( both ways ) for a shot at some trout.....anytime !"
1309352,Walley Guide,2011-05-20 09:50:00,67,"DonC....understand the loss of people heading north. Largest group I planned for had about 25, only 8 short years ago. Down to about 3 very good friends and family these days. I have noticed less traffic in the past few years as well. After 35 years, still the best vacation place I have found. Happy Fishin' Walley"
1310057,DonC,2011-05-22 18:19:00,93,"ChuckE and Walley, I hope you both have great trips. I have never stayed more than one week. ChuckE stays longer. I wonder if you would fish every day or take some time off in the event of staying 2 or more weeks. After 6 days of straight fishing, I get played out. I like to go in at lunch, eat and take a 30-60 minute nap. I am 56 and after a nap it seems like a new fishing day. Briand, thanks for fishing report. There are some other names from the past that I have not seen comment on going this year. I hope the regulars can make the trip. Don"
1310099,Reels,2011-05-22 19:48:00,2876,"Hey Don, good to hear from you. We are going last week of June this year. Look forward to your report when you get back. It always helps us get on a pattern quickly."
1311007,Guest,2011-05-25 06:02:00,0,"Don, The 1st week is a lot harder than the rest of the trip. That week is with a group of guys who typically get on the water by 5:00 a.m. and come in around 8:00 p.m. That makes for a long day, so you get tired toward the end of the week. About the only time you get to rest with these guys, is when you go walleye fishing -- but lately we've been known to beat the banks relentlessly all day. These guys also like to watch the sun go down and stare at the northern lights if they are out, ...and then start playing cards. The other group that comes up, gets to fish MN/WI a lot, so they are a little more ""laid-back"". If they get on the water by 8:00 after a big breakfast, that's O.K. They seem to fish for walleye a bit more too, but if the smallie bite is on, they'll want to catch every one that's in the Winnipeg! But in general, things are a little easier and you do get more sleep that part of the trip; they like big meals and are usually off the water by 7:00 p.m. for dinner. No breaks during either week and no time off -- one group leaves the boat ramp on Saturday morning, as the other group arrives. If it was the other way around, I don't think I could make it the whole time.... [Some of the guys in the last group, have accused me of falling asleep while we were talking in the living room during the evening. What's up with that????] ChuckE"
1311025,Aaron-IN,2011-05-25 06:51:00,500,I'm heading up with my wife and kids for a week (July 4th). Won't be hitting the fish like I would normally do but it will be fun just the same. Looking forward to some Kokanee and smallmouth fishing.BrianD.....will you have the Vermillion portage in good shape for me when i get there? Have you ever used the lower (shorter) portage to get in there?
1311129,briand,2011-05-25 10:35:00,48,"Aaron, for you I'll bring in a paving crew, make it all nice, and fog for bugs I've walked the lower 3 years ago.It looked like it could be a problem getting the big boat into shore. Also, and this is hard to believe but in the lower parts looked more swampy. Plus you can't beat the scenery taking the top trail in."
1311155,Aaron-IN,2011-05-25 12:01:00,500,"Thanks! When it's wet that lower portage can get pretty messy. Interestingly enough, the last time I used that portage I ran into a rather unpleasant guide/resort owner who seemed to think he owned the portage. He even went as far as to tell me not to be surprised sometime if my boat was gone when coming out. I told him life was too short and to just get over it already."
