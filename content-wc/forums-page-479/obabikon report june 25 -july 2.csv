All you want on walleyes. Lots of them and some real pigs too. We all had muskies and landed some smaller ones. The smallmouth bite was really good at the end of the trip as well. Watch out for the rocks. The lake level is at that menacing lower unit shearing level. We saw some people make some dumb moves. The walleye were best on chunck rock shorelines,no reef action. We did best with jig spinners gold blades, 1/4 oz bright colors and red green flake yamamoto grubs during the day, bright charteuse grubs at night / evening. We did get some pig walleyes on deep diving cranks, crawdad patterns 15-20 feet deep. The stay on the island was great. Wish i could be confined there. I would give tristian a run for his money !"
