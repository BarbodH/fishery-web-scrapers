I ended up at uchi lake and couldn't have been happier. I am one of those guys who stops breathing over 80 times an hour, so not an option for me to skip the machine. I was asked to go last minute on a trip when someone canceled out of a grouip and I had to decline when I found out no way to power it. I have the dc adapter but the heated water tank takes a lot of juiice and if I don't use it I instantly have a sore throat the next day."

1325234,tammybrian2,2011-07-02 11:14:00,12,"thanks everyone for your reply's. I emailed the outfitter again, to verify what we were being charged for. which turned out to be a good idea. I found out that even though he had included the weight of the generator AND gas in his replies to me, which made me assume we would be charged, he was only giving me those weights to plan accordingly with our packing. in short, as long as we are not excessively over with our gear and food, (which we never are) we are not being charged for the weight of the generator or gas. I can sleep easy now! thanks again for your input! -- Brian"
1324601,tammybrian2,2011-06-30 18:29:00,12,"wondering if anyone has been to a camp (remote outpost) where a generator was available? or the outfitter had generators for use if needed? is it the norm to have a generator? i ask because the last four years the outfitter we've gone with has provided a small generator for us and provided the gas as well for a cpap machine at no extra cost. this year we are going back to an outfitter my dad/uncle/grandfather had flown with some thirty years ago, and the owners remembered them as well! I explained the situation (to the outfitter) about the generator and needing it for a cpap machine, and they want to charge us to rent it for the week, charge us (weight) to fly it in, charge us for the gas (which i told them we would be happy to pay for), however I didn't realize they would be charging over seven dollars a gallon, and they also want to charge us to fly the gas (weight) in to the camp as well. to the toon of about $450. to me, that seems just a bit overboard! I know our options at this point is either to say the heck with it and not use the generator at all, or suck it up and pay the extra hundred bucks a man and be done with it. I guess the fact that our family is going back to this outfitter and spending the money we are, it seems a bit overboard with what they want to charge us. anyone have thoughts or suggestions on this? --Brian"
1324607,Mondo_)H,2011-06-30 18:39:00,91,$450 seems a little on the high side but then again its not free for the outfitter as well.
1324620,Outfitter17,2011-06-30 19:05:00,127,"Generators are getting to be the norm, both my outposts have them and a buddy of mine has generators at all his outposts. Sounds like your outfitter is just trying to find a way to squeeze a little more money out of you."
1324622,Skywagon,2011-06-30 19:10:00,1106,"Here is my more inexpensive solution and you don't have to listen to a noisy generator: Most c-pap machines can go either 110 volt or 12 volt. You can either buy a 12 volt plug-cord from the c-pap company, or do what I did and go to an electronics store and buy one that will work (it is a common small round plug like most 110 to 12 volt converters use). Take along either a 12 volt trolling motor battery, or a good 12 volt jump start unit. Since you will probably be out there for at least a week, I would take a small solar panel to trickle charge the battery, these are very small in size, maybe 12 inches sqare and weigh nothing, so don't panic about that. I have taken a good jump start unit that I use for the plane and it has run my machine a couple of days with no problems without recharging. If you have to buy a battery or a jumpstart, that will be your major expense, the solar trickle charger can't amount to much, or the C-pap plug-in, not sure if, or how much they would charge to haul a battery in. Good luck on your trip."
1324639,Mike Borger,2011-06-30 19:55:00,1554,"$450 is ridiculous imo. As far as skywagon's suggestion goes it's not a bad idea, but many air services will refuse to fly in deep cycle batteries. Besides that they weigh a ton, probably more than a compact generator would."
1324643,GNO,2011-06-30 20:04:00,153,"If you are going to fly a 12 volt battery in, rememeber is has to be a gel cell battery. Liquid batteries are considered dangerous goods and most air services won't fly them in. Ifthey do, they have to use a special container when transporting them."
1324657,joeman79,2011-06-30 20:45:00,417,I think I would just take my chances without the machine and just wake up less rested. Who knows maybe while you are up there You will be so at peace with the world you won't need it. Got a buddy who goes on 10 day pack trips every year and does not take it and he is still alive. Your outfitter sounds like a money hungry I could give a crap less about customer service kind of guy. IMHO Or you could buy a cordless on for 279.00. cheaper than the ungodly amount he wants to charge you. I just googled cordless cpap.
1324704,Skywagon,2011-07-01 05:02:00,1106,"I have went without the C-pap machine on a few occasions when I forgot to take it on overnighters, not a restfull sleep and for a week, would be a deal breaker for me. The gel cell battery has a longer life anyway. If one purchases a different C-pap with a battery pak, it will need to be charged, so the solar trickle charger would still be required."
1324760,Ogoki,2011-07-01 07:09:00,291,My wife and I use Mattice lake Outfitters and they have large generators at Ogoki Reservoir. Sometimes they shut the generator off at night. Camp attendant told me one trip that the generator would run day and night as someone had a cpap machine . That had to cost some extra bucks in fuel but in all my trips with Don Elliot I have never been hit up for extras . I do realize it does cost to have a generator flown in but $450 does seem excessive to me . From what I read here you are expecting to pay but not that much . I feel the same .
1324767,Mohleye,2011-07-01 07:25:00,368,"If you get it set up for DC, couldn't you run it off the batteries/solar charging system that's already there for the lights, etc? (Assuming the place has solar lighting.....)"
