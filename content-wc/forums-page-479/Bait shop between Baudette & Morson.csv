1324814,ret-ro,2011-07-01 10:12:00,41,Can anyone suggest a good bait shop between Baudette & Morson?Looking for leeches by the pound or half pound for the weekend.

We used to buy leeches in Baudette when you could still bring them across the border. Your best bet for a bait shop would be to cross the border at International Falls and buy leeches in Ft. Francis. With enough advance notification, Justin at Mylie's Place Resort near Hansons Bay, may be able to supply them for you. [email protected] 1-866-395-3449 tolll-free. Marv"
1324973,J-Man,2011-07-01 16:47:00,191,"There are a couple of resorts and a marina that have bait available, including us as Marv pointed out (thanks Marv.) We keep minnows and leeches available at all times unless there is a severe shortage from suppliers. It's the same situation with BV and Morson Marina. There is no bait shops between Rainy River and Morson. The resort community as a whole is happy to provide bait for our visitors and I know I speak for all operators in saying we appreciate your support up here.Thanks."

1325274,Tomv,2011-07-02 14:57:00,21,The Marina in Morson has very good leeches. Was there last weekend. They sell by the pound and 1/2 lb.
