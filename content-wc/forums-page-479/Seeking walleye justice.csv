1324315,SinOrSwim,2011-06-29 23:45:00,1528,"There is no right or wrong answer. It is the FISH of whoever is telling the story. This is clearly a court case that will be decided over time over many beer and many fishing trips. The story starts.........so there I was........And, what is better than some good quality bickering and smack talk over a beer after a day of fishing. LOL That is awesome by the way. One of the best fishing stories I've heard. AND, I've heard ""a lot"" of stories since I fish with my brothers."
1324361,Stu,2011-06-30 07:16:00,472,"Great thread! This is an interesting issue. We too have held court numerous times on hunting and fishing trips. The tie breakers are usually decided by the ""old man in camp"". IMHO, the son gets credit and is allowed the prestige of humbling his dad until such time that the father becomes sick of the ridicule and whacks him with an oar or similar tool of justice. Btw, we need a ""like button"" at the end of each post. Thanks for the entertainment"
1324492,SteveJ715,2011-06-30 13:20:00,59,"Thanks all for your fun feedback on this issue. I was glad to see people take the question in the lighthearted spirit in which it was intended. To address a few questions or thoughts: the fish was released, so it couldn't be confiscated (Gord!) or divided in two, Solomon-style. In fact, we each took a photo with the debated fish, with the unspoken thought that if we ever do actually sort this out, the rightful owner of the title of largest walleye of the week will have the photo to prove it. Oh, and of course I'm thrilled to be able to spend this special time with my Dad every spring, and I know that there are many who would love the chance to do the same, if only one more time. The annual Canada trip is something we both look forward to for 51 weeks a year. But that doesn't mean this can't be the source of a years-long father-son debate, as some have pointed out. So thanks for taking the time to read this and throw in your two cents -- even if you side with my Dad. I thought the judges would beat me up pretty severely on this one, but I've been pleasantly surprised to see that it's about 50-50. That's probably for the best, anyway.Finally, Juls, are our egos really that big? Come on, of course they are!Thanks again,- Steve"
1324537,eyemike,2011-06-30 15:29:00,233,"[Heck, I would be happy just fishing with my dad.] Boy that says it all right there! I fished with my dad for 20 years in Canada, until 2005 when he passed away. For one more trip he could catch ALL OF THE FISH and I would be one happy camper watching. Life is too short for the who caught what stuff. Your Dad caught the fish because it was his pole and your his too! Mike"
1324539,Juls,2011-06-30 15:33:00,13414,LOL....Enjoy the debate for years to come...Juls

I think you may have taken that a little too seriously or you need to put out an APB for your sense of humor.I suppose it could also be that you value your time on an internet message board a little too much......OR!

1324073,Rich D,2011-06-29 13:01:00,75,"It doesn't matter the situation - dad wins! Me and a friend were fishing with my dad and my friend snagged a line and reeled in a hot-n-tot. My dad claimed the lure and proceeded to outfish us! He still uses that lure today, mostly to mock my buddy. He'll toss the lure behind the boat on a drift and catch fish!"
1324078,v-bay gord,2011-06-29 13:10:00,3168,It's illegal to fish with an unsupervised rod.....you are both guilty and the fish has been confiscated. Any beer on board?.....I'm giving you a fine for that as well. No boater safety card? Another $250....
1324097,wallydave,2011-06-29 13:41:00,2151,"As a member of an Ethics committee, this is an interesting case study! The rod belonged to the father, yet it was left unattended. The son prevented the rod from being lost in the water, and then reeled in the fish, to be netted by the father. King Soloman would have announced the spliting of the fish intwo parts, to see who react the most dramatically! If the fish was over slot, this approach would work well, in not the MNR would have to offer a ruling on the case! Seriously, both had a hand in catching the fish, and as many posters have mentioned, to have the chance to fish with your father, is very special! Those of us whose fathers have passed on would love to have this debate! The movie version could be called ""Lake of Dreams"""
1324104,NemegosendaRiver,2011-06-29 13:55:00,66,So noted.
1324119,Juls,2011-06-29 14:20:00,13414,"Hehehe...Quote by the OP: "" I look over the side and spot a large walleye swimming lazily.""Thus, the rod was in no danger of going overboard at that point.Just say'n....Juls"
1324140,Bill Krejca,2011-06-29 15:22:00,6107,"Sort of reminds me of the time during the spring of 1983 when my dad, my son, Nate, and I were anchored, still fishing with bait for lake trout on Sturgeon Lake, Ontario. I got a bite, set the hook, and quickley handed over the rod to my son (he was 9 years old at the time). He fought the fish for several minutes before we landed it. It was about 8 pounds. Dad and I both congratulated Nate on his fine catch. That smile on his face was worth anything, I still have the picture with him holding the fish, and showing a grin almost as big as the fish. If a picture of dad and me had been taken at that time, we also would have been grinning. Catching fish is supposed to make all of us smile, if it doesn't we probably should rethink our reason for being out there. Bill Krejca"
1324141,Legend115,2011-06-29 15:24:00,39,"what if you were both in the woods hunting and your father put is rifle down to go take a leak...then a beautiful 160 class buck emeregers from the alders and you shoulder your rifle only to discover it misfires. BUT, by the grace of god you have time to pick up your fathers rifle and put one in the boiler room and bag a very nice buck. who's deer is it? your father's because it was his rifle..or yours because you shot it?"
1324207,rnnonmt,2011-06-29 18:30:00,992,"Great responses from all! Definately entertaining.""I motion for a continuance."" ""This court is adjourned and should proceed at next years fishing trip!"""
1324272,Rich D,2011-06-29 20:47:00,75,"Again, the father's. He most likely taught the son to hunt and shoot. The son should have paid better attention during the lessons about cleaning and maintaining the gun. ;-)"
1324001,SteveJ715,2011-06-29 10:54:00,59,"Please try on your judge's robe here and render a verdict on two issues. First, the facts: My Dad and I were fishing together during our annual trip this spring. For some reason we switched spots in the boat, so that I was now driving and he was in the front. During that process, he left his rod leaning against the side of the boat in such a way that his jig and minnow were dangling in the water about a foot down (we were just floating). He switched to a different rod. Then his rod in the back of the boat next to me starts moving and I grab it. I look over the side and spot a large walleye swimming lazily. Dad asks for the rod, but I told him the fish is essentially on the surface and asked him to just net it, thinking I didn't want to lose the fish in the hand-off. He scoops the fish, and it turns out to be our largest of the week (only 22Â”, but it's the principle we're after here). So the two questions for the judges are as follows:1) Was I wrong to keep the pole and ask him to net the fish?2) Who gets credit for the fish, which ended up being the largest walleye of the week? Thanks for your input. And no, we don't have a major cash pot waiting on the answer to #2, I'm just curious where people will come down on it. Good luck to those of you who have yet to take your trip, and to those like me, who already are eagerly anticipating next year.- Steve"
1324004,Juls,2011-06-29 11:01:00,13414,"Good grief, are your egos so big that you can't just smile and say, ""nice fish"" and let it be? Some one has to take credit for it?Seems to me, the ""boat"" caught the fish since neither of you were actually using the rod at the time the fish caught itself on the jig that was hanging over the side.In a ""dead rod"" scheme of things, since it was your Dad's rod, and he left the jig hanging, essentially it would be HIS fish.The fact that you picked up the rod AFTER the fish was already on, and wouldn't hand it off, doesn't change that fact.Still HIS fish.There, that's my opinion, but I still think it's silly to even have to ask the question.my .02 cents....Heck, I would just be happy to be fishing with my Dad and let him take credit for ALL the fish...if it were me.Juls"
1324008,Hot Runr Guy,2011-06-29 11:09:00,16061,"Upon cross examination; 1) Is it true that you failed to honor the request from your Father, to give him the pole that was rightfully his? 2) If I understand the scenario, he was asked to net the fish, so YOU didn't lose it? 3) Who's boat were you in, who would have been the ""Captain"" of record? You un-grateful little snot, give your old man the buck, and be thankful he's still alive to fish with you! Hahahahaha! Mine passed away 39 years ago, I've got to think REAL hard to recall a fishing memory with him. HRG"
1324016,Ralfeee,2011-06-29 11:17:00,33,Sounds like who was taking credit from it might have been in violation of the law by using more than one fishing line. Check your regulations before you claim the fish.
1324024,NemegosendaRiver,2011-06-29 11:30:00,66,"Oh, we have held court many times in camp. This is a good one as without precedence, you really only have the facts to work with.Let me ask you this question. Would your Dad have been mad at you if you had let the fish drag his rod to the bottom of the lake? The answer is probably yes and if so, you saved him about 150 bucks in order to win, what, 40 bucks?My verdict is in...Son keeps the fish and the money....and yes to the fellow up above, it is that important. The story is going to be told 100 times over the next twenty years so a verdict needs to be determined."
1324033,Mark R,2011-06-29 11:48:00,1538,you were right to keep the pole and have the old man net it. It's your fish
1324035,HeHooksHimself,2011-06-29 11:50:00,725,"Reminds of a story from many years ago when my brother-in-law (is and always has been my best fishing buddy) were fishing in a reservoir in Colorado called Reudi Reservoir. We were fishing off the bank with salmon eggs for a hybrid rainbow trout that is in the lake. Fishing was slow and he left his ""Commander Cody"" reel propped on a stick with a tight line as he went down the bank to cast a lure. A moment to explain the ""Commander Cody"" designation- While we have never been ones to be able to afford the best in fishing rods and reels, this one was particularly decrepit. It was a closed faced reel on a 5' lightweight rod. As it turns out, the darn thing would not even reel the line in. I was engaged in a conversation with an old geezer from Basalt, Colorado who was telling me stories of the old days and life in the mountains when suddenly the Commander Cody gets whacked off the pole and is being drug into the water. I was a lot faster back then and I grabbed the pole as it was entering the water and began to reel, but the line would not come in and it was obvious that the fish on the end of the line was big. I put the pole over my should and began walking up the bank. I hauled out this monstrous rainbow hybrid trout that measured 24"" At this point my brother in law had run back to the scene and we both marveled at the size of this monster. From that day, I am guessing it was in the late '70s to this, we have argued about who should receive the credit for that fish. His take is, ""it was my setup, I am the one who attracted the fish."" Of course, it is my contention that, ""it might have been your setup, but I overcame the crappy equipment and you never felt the power of the pull!"" I am sure during our fishing trip together in Sept., the subject will come up again. So, in my opinion, the son gets the credit!"
1324041,Juls,2011-06-29 12:05:00,13414,"For the record, while many think of me ""as one of the guys"", I am not a ""fellow"". Juls"
1324055,NARDA 1,2011-06-29 12:30:00,636,Give your dad credit for the fish and tell him that the next time it happens you won't touch the rod he abandoned and the rod can go over the side.
1324066,LOW1,2011-06-29 12:51:00,2828,Both parties are found to be at fault. No verdict for either party. Court costs of one case of Labatt's are assessed equally to the parties. Send it to the court within ten days. /s/ The Judge
