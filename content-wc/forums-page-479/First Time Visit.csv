Planning a first time trip to quebec from upstate NY...sort of settled on deer horn lodge or cabonga res...bringing my boat, not worried abt the tow or roads really. but after doing a search here and other forums the issues of theft, low water levels, bad fishing for years, not what its cracked up to be, etc not at this lodge per say, but the quebec lakes in general? i skipped baskatong for those reasons above...should i worry or just go and see what plays out..thought it was a good fit driving wise at 4.5 hrs above montrealplanning on late july early aug..thanks for your help in advance"
1322893,jdoaks,2011-06-26 15:52:00,89,welcome i go by valdor some years are better than others weather dependant just go and try it we always have a good time we always catch some fish just getting away is great. I go with bast 3 people (wife and 2 cousins).
1322907,Freytown,2011-06-26 16:53:00,770,I would suggest driving a few miles further north to the Gouin. Better fishing and lot's of outfitters to choose. I was up two weeks ago & the road through Parent was great. The Kruger papermill starts back up this July & they maintain the roads very well.

Low water tends to concentrate the fish. The last time we saw the water that low was in the 90s. My father and I have been going up there, off and on through the years, since 1981. It's now down almost 2 feet so it will be interesting to see what the fishing is like. I started tracking the water depths on my blog: http://eatsleepfish.blogspot.com/p/c...ter-level.html Here are my posts from Last Year's trip: http://eatsleepfish.blogspot.com/sea...0%20DHL%20Trip Won't matter for lakers, which we always go after. Walleyes might be a little tougher to catch. We find the best way to catch them is to troll worm rigs through weed beds. Jigging works but don't have the patience for it, however, I did catch a 7lb walleye jigging. I am headed up on Friday so check my blog for fishing updates and pictures, I take a lot, and I might try a few movies this year."
