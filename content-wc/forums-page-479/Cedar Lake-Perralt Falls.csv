1315336,mdoehling,2011-06-07 05:30:00,81,Leaving on June 24th for week. Never fished on this lake in the past. Anyone wth thoughts to share would be appriciated. Thanks
1315518,UKBDM,2011-06-07 11:45:00,178,Going to be across the road on Wabaskang that same week. Was on Wabaskang same week a year ago. Weeds = walleye on Wabaskang. (Perch too!) Jig + minnow. What little I have seen of Cedar looks similar but there are many on here who know more than I do. Memory says we had above normal temps last year so I am hoping for a little cooler weatherthis time. Have a great week!
1316917,JBwvu,2011-06-10 16:06:00,18,"Going back for our third year 0n 9 July. In the past we went in late June. Two years ago we caught Walleye nearly every where we fished. Last year we ran into the Mayfly hatch and it was more difficult. Still caught a bunch. Also last year had numerous Musky follows but none hooked other than 3 small ones while fishing for Walleyes. Loads of Smallmouth and Perch also. One reason we decided to go later had to do with the Musky. Thought our chances might be better. Weather this year has apparently been tough, but is improving from what I read. You may be hitting it at the right time. Think you will love the lake. Easy to navigate, sheltered pretty well from the wind and not much pressure. Have a ball and as a old fellow told me once, ""Hope you catch a bunch of 'em!"""

1317163,Rich B,2011-06-11 16:38:00,1081,"We just got back a week ago from our 3rd Spring trip up to Cedar Lake - the ""rocks"" and ""shoals"" are fairly well marked by the camps, and if you stay out in the middle of the bays, you're good to go all over the lake. Keep an eye on your depth finder and don't cut the corners of points, islands and you'll have a great week on Cedar.....just wish I was going back this year. Great lake to fish.....for our group, the water was still too cold and the fish had not moved up when we were in camp. As you'll be up in 2 weeks, be sure to spend time in some of the smaller bays with weed beds....if the timing is good, you could get into an almost all day bite. We caught jumbo crappie, good sized perch, walleyes up to 21"" (the big ones weren't hitting - at least not for us) and some pike and Musky......going back into Nelson lake is worth checking out for the crappie and large perch, as well as nice Walleyes. Don't know which camp you're staying at, but I would think they would mark a lake map for you and advise you of any shallow or rocky areas......follow their advice and have fun. Rich B"
1317237,MikeZ,2011-06-11 20:27:00,115,"I was at Cedar Lake once in 1993, first week of June. There was a small adjacent lake we got to with a short portage that we spent half a day on. The Northern fishing was crazy hot. Not an ""every cast"" bite, but darn near close. I wonder if that lake is still fished today? We stayed at the island camp for that trip - 14 guys, 10 from Newton, Iowa and four of us from the Chicago area. Lots of good memories. I hope your trip is as good as mine was. -Mike"
1317808,JBwvu,2011-06-13 13:03:00,18,Ditto on what was said above re. rocks. Never had a problem although there can be some logs sticking out in the bays. Good luck. Let us know how you did.
1317899,mdoehling,2011-06-13 16:20:00,81,Thanks everyone. We leave in 11 days...I'll let you all know how we do.
1317901,mdoehling,2011-06-13 16:24:00,81,"Have any of you made the run up to perrault lake. We stayed up there about 10 years ago, and did ok. Wondering how it is nowadays?"
1318044,Muskie Bob,2011-06-13 22:29:00,45,"Not sure about the fishing, but when going from Cedar to Perrault there is a burnt bridge area where I would go fairly slow as I've seen a couple of rocks that might give you a little trouble.I doubt if you will need to go to Perrault, as Cedar should provide all the fishing you need. Good luck."
