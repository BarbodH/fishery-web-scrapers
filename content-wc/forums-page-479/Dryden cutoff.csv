1324296,bigtimeelectric,2011-06-29 21:40:00,174,has anyone taken the cutoff from 502 to eagle river. it looks like it would save some time if your headed to vermilion bay. my brother in law took it 15 years ago and said he barely made it through the mud road pulling with just his pickup. we went down it a couple years ago for about 5 miles and turned around because we thought for sure we were on the wrong road. any info would help looking for the quickest way to ear falls from bemidji to get on the eyes...

1324330,Skywagon,2011-06-30 05:14:00,1106,"No, you would not want to miss the Dairy Queen. 594 is a good road."
1324335,HeHooksHimself,2011-06-30 05:38:00,725,"Went through there first of June, no problems. The road is paved all the way now unless you go through the reservation, there is still some dirt there and it was like a washboard. We came back on the all paved road."
1324345,Blue Lk,2011-06-30 06:26:00,269,"If you turn left on hwy 594 at the end of 502,stay on 594 it will take you to hwy 17 at Eagle Junction,the road has been paved in the last couple years.Ojibway Dr thru the reservation is mostly unpaved & wash board.The back road from Eagle River to Waldof is also unpaved.Stick with 594 & you are good to go."
1325066,Limeyangler,2011-07-01 23:09:00,563,"594 is your best bet. If you want to deviate try turning off at Adams Road about 4 kms along the 594, brings you out onto hwy 17 again."
1325067,Bigfish10702,2011-07-01 23:11:00,60,"I go on Oxdrift, a little rough but no biggie. Saves time."
