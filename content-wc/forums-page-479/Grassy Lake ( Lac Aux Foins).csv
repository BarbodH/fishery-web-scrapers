The outfitter who runs the cabins on the lake is or was located in Kipawa just as you get in town, turn right and runs that flying service. We flew in in 1965, and have driven in since several times. It's not an easy drive, but possible thru redpines chutes or coming in from Belleteere. The lake is an on again and off again lake. We camp at the gravel pit diggings on the northwest end of the lake. There are also indian grounds there. A New York resident also had a cabin there, but it was in dis-repair on the last trip, leaving me to believe he no longer used it. The fly-in camps, 5 at last count, are scattered around the lake, and on the islands.It has been 5 years since I went there, so if you need any more info, locate another who has."
