As a Canadian resident (not from Saskatchewan), I have a choice of either a 3-day for $30 or a seasonal for $60. That's the same price as a non-resident (someone who lives outside Canada). We are planning on meeting some friends in Saskatchewan, do some camping, and stay about a week or 10 days. Now I would think that someone travelling from out of provice would stay more than 3 days. So what's the use of a 3 day license?? I'm pretty much forced to purchase a $60 license. They don't even offer some type of conservation license. What's up with that?"
546279,Guest,2005-03-14 12:18:00,0,That sounds fairly normal compared to many other places?
546283,Guest,2005-03-14 17:01:00,0,When i bought mine last year the guy told me they were going up to $85 for the 05 season.....I didn't think $60 was all that bad for the season.
546294,Mike M (Sask),2005-03-15 07:46:00,374,"It was $60 last year and will be $80 for non-Canadian residents in 2005. The way I read it, it will remain $60 for Canadian, non-Saskatchewan residents. I think the point the guy in the original post was making is the fact that I, as a Saskatchewan resident can go into Manitoba and purchase a licence for $20. I know this was the price I paid last year and is also the price for 2005. Last year as a resident here in Saskatchewan I paid $30. There is no question our licences have taken a big jump in price. I don't mind providing the money is being put back into the fisheries... But we all know how that works!"
