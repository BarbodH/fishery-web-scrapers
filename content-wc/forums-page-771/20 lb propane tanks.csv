546201,Ia Walihntr,2005-03-10 16:36:00,320,October fishing in northern Saskatchewan can be pretty cold. Can you take 20 lb propane cyliners into Saskatchewan legally? I'm thinking you probably can take them over the border but want to make sure we are legal. Does anyone know for sure? Thanks in advance.

Kidding....yes it is fine providing the canister is in good shape.You cannot refill a propane tank here if it is more than five years old."
