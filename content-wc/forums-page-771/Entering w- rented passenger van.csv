546234,Guest,2005-03-12 11:02:00,0,"Mates: someone told me that customs won't allow rented 12 and 15 passenger vans into Canada b/c of 9-11 security issues. This doesn't sound right to me, so if anyone could shed some light on this I'd appreciate it. Thanks BW"
546265,Guest,2005-03-14 06:38:00,0,"Had not heard that one before. Hopefully this is not true, because we are planning on doing the same. If we can find a 15 passenger van to rent."
546268,Guest,2005-03-14 07:49:00,0,"hard to imagine that's the case. i've entered with rental cars, no problem there. some lodges round up groups in chicago and haul them up there in a bus. you may get a little extra scrutiny, but i cannot imagine you getting turned away because of your vehicle."
546269,Trailerguy,2005-03-14 09:13:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b] This question can be answered by someone in customs. The general inquiry number for Fort Francis is 807-274-3655.
546272,Guest,2005-03-14 10:32:00,0,"We rent a Motorhome with a tow behind U-Haul and don't have any trouble. They inspect us more often than not, but at least they are trying to get the bad guys."
546274,Fishoil,2005-03-14 11:09:00,1277,I've gone up with a group for several years with two 15 pass. vans that were rented with no problems crossing at Fort Frances.
546281,Guest,2005-03-14 13:01:00,0,I rented a Big Van last year on one of my trips and even told the border crossing people it was rented because he asked about the license plate not matching my drivers license (states different). I told him it was a rental and he handed our drivers licenses back and wished us a nice trip.
546292,ONE TIME DAVE,2005-03-15 06:04:00,110,We have used a 15 passenger rental van the past 4 years with no problems.
546295,Guest,2005-03-15 09:01:00,0,Can I ask where you guys have rented these 15 passenger vans from? I am having a hard time finding one here in S. Ohio. Can 8 people + gear drive comfortably for 18 hr drive?
546296,Seanik,2005-03-15 09:32:00,218,"We are located in northwest Pa and have been renting Vans for Canadian fishing trips for many years. The 15 passenger vans are not comfortable on long trips, the seats are close together, not padded very well and difficult to remove back seats for gear storage. We rent the Ford Travel van, It has 4 very comfortable captain chairs that recline almost flat and a removable back bench seat.The cost is quite high but worth the comfort on a long trip. The cost for 10 days with 1600 miles is 1100.00 that includes supplimental insurance that covers everything your personal auto insurance does not cover. Most Ford Dealerships offer vans for rental and leasing. Hope this helps,"
