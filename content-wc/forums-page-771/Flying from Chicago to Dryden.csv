546431,Guest,2005-03-20 01:45:00,0,About 10 of us will be driving 3 trucks and should arrive at our camp on Lac Seul near Ear Falls about noon on Sat July 23. We will unload our boats and at about 3:30 one of the fellows will drive to Red Lake to pick up the fellow at the Red Lake airport at 4:45. He should be back at Ear falls about 6:PM and should be able to get in some evening fishing.
546068,Guest,2005-03-06 18:28:00,0,One of the fellows from our group will not get out of work untill 7 Am on Sat July 23 and we will just be getting up from our motel in Dryden about that time. He is thinking about flying from Chicago to Drydon for about $425.00 one way and we could wait a few hours in Dryden and pick him up. Does he have to apply ahead of time for a passport or what must he apply for to fly from Chicago to Dryden? Thanks for any help.

546104,Guest,2005-03-07 06:18:00,0,I have not flown into Dryden but last year I did fly into Montreal. I needed a certified birth certificate or a passport and a picture ID. I would guess Dryden would be the same. The airline should be able to tell you.
546106,Guest,2005-03-07 07:25:00,0,"So far, both Mexico and Canada require either a Certified Birth Certificate and picture ID or a Passport."
546151,Reels,2005-03-08 18:10:00,2876,"We have had people fly into Kenora before, and only needed a B-Cert. But, I would call and check just to make sure. Maybe try a travel agent, they are up to speed on the current lawss. <{{}}><"
546192,Guest,2005-03-10 09:13:00,0,Could someone give me some flight info on Chicago to Dryden ? I have flown to Int. Falls . Thank's in Advance.
546193,Guest,2005-03-10 09:29:00,0,I checked on the internet and the best rate is to fly from Chicago to Winnipeg or Thunder Bay and then board a Bearskin Airlines flight to Dryden. In my friends case his best way to go is to Winnipeg and then to Red Lake as we will be fishing at Lac seul.
546422,Guest,2005-03-19 16:38:00,0,How many hours from Chicago to Red Lake? The last time I looked into that option is would have been as quick to drive. May be better now.
546423,Guest,2005-03-19 17:21:00,0,My friend is leaving Chicago July 23 at noon and arriving in Winnipeg at 2 PM. I think there will be a layover for 2 hours and leave at 4 PM in Winnipeg and in Red Lake at about 4:45. Can you drive from Chicago to Red Lake in 5 hours? And stop for 2 hours for gas and eats?
546427,Guest,2005-03-19 20:20:00,0,"Hey Mercuryguy, you said you were flying to Red lake, what lake are you going to stay at, will be Red lake or are driving some where else."
