546336,tlars,2005-03-16 08:22:00,137,My wife and I are heading to Lost Island Lodge north of Hudson on May 28. I'd like to talk about the experience of others at this resort. All reports I can find on the web are good. Email me at [email protected]. Thanks. Lars

You should have a great time and the fishing in that section of the lake is 1st class. Walleye should be shallow and hungry. Fish slow and you and the wife will have an awesome trip. Good Luck, Catch and Release"

We fished primarily Sen Bay which is phenominal for numbers, and some real hogs taken...28-30""....Also great areas to and from Sen.... Would go back there, but our group has decided to explore other areas, but I know we will be going back.... When you see Basil, ask him about the ""skeg award"" he so richly and honestly won.....Say Hi from Joe, Terry and Tom and tell him the Hondas will still beat the pants off him....He will painfully know what you are talking about!!!!!!!!"
546341,verlund,2005-03-16 11:29:00,32,"I stayed at Lost Island Lodge for a week last July. The lodge is now owned by Jim's brother Shane and his wife. We had a great time there. Caught many fish and size as well. Biggest walleye was 31"" inches caught by my 16 yr old son. We had a group of 8 and had a guide for 3 days. We tried to get Basil but couldn't, he was completly booked. We ended up with Brad (he is related to Shane). A nice guy but kind of no nonsense - hard to kid around with where Basil is a real character and enjoys a good laugh. The only true negative we had with Brad was he was more interested in his own fishing then making sure we were catching fish ourselves, not that we didn't but the number priority of a guide should be the client. As far as food goes, it is generally very good but portions tend to be rather small especially dinner (when you are the hungriest)- there are no seconds on the American Plan. Many times I left hungry from dinner. Bring up alot of your own snacks and drinks. One other real negative we ran into was there is no ice machine at the resort. I have stayed at many fishing resorts before and this is the first one that didn't have ice. This is a big negative especially since fish that are kept have to be killed right away. I would recommend bringing a stringer along or plan to make alot of your own ice blocks in tupperware bowls, etc. to keep a livewell/drinks cold. One more thing you should be aware of, there are no toilets in the cabins. The toilets are kept in the middle of the resort. You do have your own but can be a hassle to get to in the middle of the night. Overall, I would say it is a nice resort, run by genuinely very nice people, but for the price of the American Plan the amenities can be better. If you are on the housekeeping plan I guess it would be fine. Just my honest opinion."

Catching a fish and putting it on a stringer I believe would violate the kill all fish right away regulation. Best thing to do is bring up empty milk jugs, fill'em with water and freeze them."
546346,verlund,2005-03-16 15:52:00,32,"What I meant by that is when you gill the fish, you could put it in a stringer and leave it in the water to keep (somewhat) cold. If you rely on making ice for your livewell and/or cooler, you will be making ice every night. Not a big deal but if I paying a decent amount of money to stay on an 'island' resort (no access to other ice), I would expect them to have an ice machine."
546347,Tyee Guy,2005-03-16 15:55:00,717,We never had a problem with ice....They would always have it for us for our day trips as well as for the nightly libations.....
546371,Guest,2005-03-17 12:25:00,0,"I too have stayed at Lost Island Lodge for the last five years. Unfortunately we will no be going back for a sixth year. The resort is in a nice location, and the fishing is very good. Cost is more than what we have found while searching out another resort, but not bad. Basil is the guy, although our group never used him. Scotty was always there to help as well. We were asked to leave a day early due to a scheduling conflict; I can honestly say there is no worse feeling than to be asked to leave Lac Seul a day early. For our group we thought we could have been treated a little better or at least honor our reservation. It did not work out, so we will move on. As for the ice, yes they have it on the island. I would recommend you bring as much as you can. Other than that you should have a great time fishing. Email me if you wish to hear more. [email protected] Wade Gens"
546402,Tyee Guy,2005-03-18 11:05:00,717,"Sorry to hear about your scheduling problem....In my years there Jim and Marlene would have never done that....Haven't been there for a couple of years, but they charged us $88.00/day for the American plan...What is the going rate now????"
