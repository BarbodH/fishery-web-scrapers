546418,sabreman,2005-03-19 11:48:00,7,Looking for a new camp that's relatively isolated and that I can take my boat to. Good fishing is a must and I really don't want to drive too up to far. Any good suggestions?
546419,Ia Walihntr,2005-03-19 12:16:00,320,What's too far? Where do you live?
546425,sabreman,2005-03-19 19:24:00,7,not too much more than a few hours from Ft. Frances
546429,MN_Moose,2005-03-19 23:37:00,965,You could try Jim's Caviar Camp south of Sioux Narrows. It's a drive to / boat in. You park at reservation and boat to camp. Very remote. Good northern and smaalie fishing. Only walleyes are on portage lakes.
546430,Guest,2005-03-20 01:26:00,0,"We go to Camp Manitou on lower manitou lake. Its only about 1.5 hrs to the landing and then a 15 minute boat ride to camp. Awesome Muskie, Lake Trout, and Smallmouth, The northern is pretty good also. We go in late july, with a bunch of guys. Never had a bad trip. It is easy to get to, but yet remote, we hardly see another boat. if you want info e-mail them at [email protected] I think its a great place."

If you go early in the year you might find some crappie. Its a pretty remote area and you can bring your boat. They also have a fishing program which teaches you how to find and catch fish. They have great service, food and knowledgable fishing pros to help you find the fish quickly. Hope this helps, Wingman"

546441,Guest,2005-03-20 19:34:00,0,Haven't been to LOW so can't comment on that. I think the extra drive to Lac Seul or Gullrock chain is worth it compared to some more southern waters. Would recommend Five Lakes Lodge on Gullrock chain. Not many navigational hazards on Gullrock compared to some waters.
