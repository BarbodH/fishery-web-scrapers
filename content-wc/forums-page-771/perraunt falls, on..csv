546312,Trailerguy,2005-03-15 19:19:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]King Fisher changed hands last year, I haven't heard much feedback on the new owners, which probably is good. The camp is not as new and nice as some on the lake but is adequate I beleive. Wabaskang has plenty of fish, but you may have to travel farther up the lake, depending on when you plan to go. Usually the walleye move through the narrows to deeper water after spawning. The large part of the lake holds most of the fish later in the summer. There are plenty of pike, they like the weedbeds later on as well. Jumbo Perch are often plentiful by mid-August in the bays and weeds, and smallies are often hag around the rock piles."
546314,Guest,2005-03-15 19:43:00,0,"I agree with the comments above. Wabaskang is a good quantity lake. We never had a problem finding something that would bite. Be it pike, walleye, smallies, or perch. We did stay at Kingfisher under the former owners (last time was about 4 years ago). Staying at Kingfisher gave me the Canada fishing bug... got it so bad we bought our own place. Now we are fishing lodge owners! (not Kingfisher) A trip to Wabaskang is a good choice, have a great trip! All the best, Agate"
