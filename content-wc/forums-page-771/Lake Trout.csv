However they are in some lakes that have some 90 feet of water where they spend their summers. In last week of May we drive to city of Red Lake and fly onto Trout lake just 17 miles east. It has 90 feet of water and like all trout lakes the trout move into shallow water, like ten feet deep. they get up to 30lbs. but you mostly catch them around six lbs. You zig sag fast troll with any spoon or plug. My all time favorite is a Lur-Jensen 3"" J-plug with a blue top and silver belly. They are a lot of fun to catch, it's just BANG and their on. In later summer they go very deep,then I try and find them with depth finder sometimes suspended in 30 to 90 feet,and drop down Sonors (??? is that spelled right) and reel yank them back up, but this can be very slow fishing. Hot fishing them in May and early June. Of course we Walleye fish at this time also but there back in the shallow bays spawning this time of year."
