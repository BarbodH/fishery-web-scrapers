It's very large and the maps that used to be available were not very good--the basins were shown but few of the reefs. Fishing pressure is very light, at least in the main basin."

The lake trout fishing can be fairy good early in the year, since the fish are shallow we usaully just soak with ciscos to get our fish. Walleye fishing can be a little tougher since the water temp is always really cold, but we always get our walleyes in Cobb bay every year. The northern fishing is always really good in the shallow bays, alot of action with a fair number in the 8-13 pound range, the biggest we have had so far is 23 pounds. The lake is huge and really deep, so you really need to know where to fish. Need any more info, let me know. Good Luck!"
