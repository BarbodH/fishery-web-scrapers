546266,Larry S,2005-03-14 07:13:00,666,Are you talking about Black Birch Lake flying out of Armstrong or Red Lake? I believe Amik Outposts has the lake out of Red Lake. As Tim was saying the other lake is out of Armstrong and we cancelled out this year due to not enough people. If you are going to this lake post a report after you return Larry S
