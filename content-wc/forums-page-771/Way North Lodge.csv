546409,Guest,2005-03-18 17:04:00,0,I see that Way North is for sale. Does this mean they will not be operating this year? Anyone out there have any info on this subject?
546424,oltim,2005-03-19 18:40:00,10,We were there 6 years ago and the place was sold since then and now it is apparently up for sale again. We liked the place and one of my buddies said that the old owner was the current owner without the blonde foul mouth. When were you there last? Sorry I cannot answer your question direcly but did you try to contact them via e mail?
546426,Guest,2005-03-19 20:12:00,0,We will be operating at full capacity this year. Don't worry one bit. Please call if you are concerned. Way North Lodge
