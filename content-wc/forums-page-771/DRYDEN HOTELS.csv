546404,Guest,2005-03-18 11:06:00,0,"they sell beer at these government stores which are only open limited hours. seems like i remember that they are open when people are working and close when they get off. typical government. buy the legal allowable amount in international falls, because you may well arrive after they close. i think liquor is the same deal, but at another store if memory serves."
