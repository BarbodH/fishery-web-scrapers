3890161,mickr,2015-05-20 16:13:00,74,"it is illegal to have beer in the boat in Ontario unless you have a functioning head. it you are operating the boat and are impaired, that's a DUI charge. in Quebec you can have beer in the boat."
3890241,youngknight,2015-05-20 16:40:00,228,"Ontario Liquor Licence ActIt is illegal to transport beverage alcohol in a boat unless it is in a container that is unopened and the seal unbroken, unless the alcohol is reasonably stowed (in baggage or a closed compartment) and is not readily available to anyone. No alcohol can be consumed by anyone on board while a boat is underway. Consumption is only permitted if the following requirements are met: The boat is fitted with permanent cooking, sleeping and washroom facilities (built into the boat); and, The boat is at anchor, tied to a dock or grounded. Once you pull anchor, all alcohol must be put away There should be no argument with the fact that impaired driving of any vehicle should not be tolerated by the law nor anyone in your group. However, this is the law on transporting alcohol. I live near huge body of water with many people accessing their cottage by boat, and thus transporting all manner of alcohol...they have to follow these rules. HOWEVER, if this is the law, then an unopened beer container should be fine to have in the boat. A shore lunch is drinking on public land and thus technically illegal, however, having an unopened alcohol container should not be considered illegal...a sticky situation if you have beer on board and are just out fishing...probably a sticky situation and if you were charged, you probably could fight it but who wants that sort of hassle and expense. If you have unopened booze on board the obvious question is: where and when were you going to consume it...why bring it with you if you can only drink it back in the cabin? Still, I suggest it doesn't make it illegal.I once got pulled over in a work truck by a CO to check my fishing license...I was not fishing, had not been fishing - had just gone to a Crown land dump (those were common at the time)...I wasn't within a mile of a lake. The idiot followed me for 4 km out a forest access road, waited until I got until a highway (with no shoulders) then pulled me over...but I digress."
3890281,Shellback,2015-05-20 17:20:00,8083,"Okay, so you bring a beer or 2 with you for a shore lunch. They are unopened and stowed away. What do you do with the can or bottle after the beer is consumed and lunch is over? It's a definite no no to have an opened container on board. I fish on the St Lawrence, and have been advised not to even pick up an empty thinking I'm helping clean up litter. Lots of recreational boaters on the St Lawrence, so I'm sure they enforce to the letter of the law."
3890313,youngknight,2015-05-20 17:26:00,228,"I hear ya on the empties...yeah, that is a bit of a puzzle. If that is entirely the case though, there are thousands of water access cottages with piles and piles of empties...HOWEVER, if stowed properly the same as an opened beverage container, it should be fine. Tied up in a bag, under a seat or in a bag or something...i.e. something that an approaching boat or plane would not be able to see you do...i.e. trying to hide it as they are approaching you, you technically should technically be okay. However, technically doesn't mean you will be okay and depends on the individual you get. As I said, even if you are in the legal right, it could be a sticky situation that is best to just avoid altogether."
3890425,rnnonmt,2015-05-20 18:05:00,992,Save the beer for back at camp when it is time to tell lies about the fish you caught and laugh about it. Don't get me wrong beer and fishing kind of go hand in hand but if you get checked why do you want to hope the MNR officer is lenient having a good day? my two cents. Getting busted for consumption/possession is probably more serious than having over your limit on fish.
3891425,pjshorthorn,2015-05-21 05:29:00,5654,"I'll preface my thoughts by saying that I am no longer a "" fish all day"" guy. Did that for years......dark to dark. For the last number of years, I've come to enjoy taking a break during the day to relax in other ways......naps, take pictures at camp, meet and talk to others in camp, catch up with our group on how their morning went, have lunch,etc.... Last year was no exception. Our entire group would come in for lunch, sit on the porch and just talk while eating and having a beer. This was our version of shorelunch without having to sit in the August heat while cooking and eating. We would go back out for a couple of hours in the afternoon and back in for dinner at 5 pm. Have a beer with dinner if you liked...... back out at 6 pm for the evening bite. Couple of beers around the campfire at night listening to new stories and old stories from folks you had never met before; and watching the northern lights and stars. Relaxing on all fronts and legal. My last trip to Lac Seul in 2012 a large group of 12 fellas came in to camp around noon while I was eating lunch. I went back out before they were rigged up and on the water. As I'm fishing, here comes the Armada of 6 boats going by with everyone drinking their ""opening day"" beer. I thought, to each their own. At dark you could hear the aramada heading back to camp from quite a ways away.......motors wide open, laughing and loud talking, beer cans bouncing off the bottom of the boat as it hit waves. The ding ding ding of cans being thrown into a garbage bag lasted 10 minutes while the camp attendant cleaned out the 6 boats. All I could think was that these guys were lucky to get back to camp without being stopped or in an accident. I've had my beer in the boat back in the day when it wasn't as focused on by the MNR or OPP like it is today. Back then, you worried about the Ministry checking you for fish and not the OPP. Today, I would be more concerned about the OPP checking you as they are looking specifically for shenanigans like I described above. I've also come to realize that the odds are now likely to find myself being checked by the MNR or OPP as I've never been checked since going to Canada starting in 1984. Just isn't worth it to myself........ PjShorthorn"
3892049,tv4fish,2015-05-21 07:26:00,2694,"Pj: You and I have been going up to Canada for about the same number of years (my first trip was in 1985). We fish Lac Seul also. Back then, there was no slot limit, there was no rule about having beer in the boat, etc. I think the focus of the MNR officers was ""safe boating"", i.e. - making sure you had PFDs for everybody, throwable cushion, etc. THEN the slot limit came into existence, we were checked quite often by the MNR (not only on the water, but also at the dock or boat landing) with their trough with the metal ruler to make sure we had ""legal"" fish. Even then, the alcohol in the boat wasn't a BIG issue. Then, the alcohol DID become an issue and we were checked fairly often about that - but even the camp operator would tell us that if we had beer in the boat for our shore lunch, we ""probably"" would be OK. Then the funding for the MNR was cut and it seems like we just don't get checked as often as we did before. Just my observation(s)."
3892121,pjshorthorn,2015-05-21 07:40:00,5654,"TV: You reiterated my experiences over the years dead on including the slot. Talk about guys being hacked off when that came into play.....I wouldn't have it any other way now. It has improved the fishery so much that generations to come will have a lifetime of memories to make and enjoy. When I know that I will be taking my last fishing trip to Canada, I will take my beer in the boat that last trip. Someone may have to carry the beer for me to the boat, but it is going to make it in the boat. I'll toast the fish, my family/friends and Canada one last time. PjShorthorn"
3940569,Bstar,2015-06-06 07:07:00,564,"Just curious, did you have to pay the fine on the spot?"
3941097,BreezyPoint,2015-06-06 11:52:00,1581,"I've been told a story that I am not sure is true. What a Canadian told me was that an officer (don't know if OPP or game officer) had one of his family members was killed by a drunk boater on Lake of the Woods and enforcement has been tough ever since. I did see the OPP arrest a couple of guys for BWI on the lake and they took them, their boat and cars away. They towed the boat with their truck. That would be the end of fishing trips to Canada for those guys. Funny thing was I warned them about drinking in the boat that very morning. The two of them had at least 30 empties in the bottom of their boat.I also underwent a 'boating safety compliance' check on Lake of the Woods. Similar to a post above, they parked a large boat in a narrows with a second chase boat. They stopped everyone. We had kool-aid in a canister type cooler and they actually asked for a sample to taste to see if there was liquor in the kool-aid. If I were an officer, I wouldn't sample anyone else's pop or kool-aid but they did.For me, it's black and white. The law says no beer in the boat so I don't.For those who choose to take a chance, be careful not to get a BWI. That would end future fishing trips for a long time.Frank"
3941161,Aspencreek,2015-06-06 12:15:00,2911,"A new guy to our group a few years ago, but who had gone on several fly-ins with others, was bound and determined to have his beer while fishing on LS. You can guess the rest of the story, the OPP stopped us to do a safety and fish check. The rest of us, 2 other boats, were good to go, but our beer drinking friend and his boat partner were given the ticket. At dinner that night the 2 that got the ticket expected the other 4 of us to share in paying the fine. I reminded him that we had warned them of the possibilities, that none of the rest of us had committed the offence and I for one was not going to share. The other 3 had the same feelings. Those 2 actually left camp the next morning after some heated discussions the night before, moral of the story ""if you do the crime, fully expect to do the time!!!"
3941233,Little Pine,2015-06-06 13:07:00,26,When we go up to lotw we stay in the angle on the MN side and boat into Canada during the day. A few years ago when I called before entering Canada the lady on the phone asked if we had any beer in the boat. I was honest and told her yes. She told me you know its illegal to drink in the boat in Canada. I told her I knew that and she says well that's ok we really don't enforce that. So who knows. If I have beer in the boat and get a ticket its my own fault.
3943001,LoDo,2015-06-07 08:36:00,721,"Our party hasn't fished a drive up camp in years. I'd be skeptical with beer in the boat on drive in trips. I firmly believe whomever is caught with beer in the boat or operating a boat under the influence should pay the penalty. Making others ""chip in"" is ridiculous. Not that one can't get caught on fly-in trips but less likely. 9 weeks and counting!"
3916834,BRP,2015-05-29 13:42:00,77,"Hey guys, first post here so I'll try not to be too controversial Seems people are stressing about Canada's draconian liquor laws. That is not my experience. Yes, it is illegal in a boat unless moored and a proper head etc. Same on shore unless you meet some criteria as a temporary residence (ie a camp site). The reality is they (police or resource officers) aren't really looking for guys enjoying a cold one while they fish or eat. They will usually not look, or overlook it unless you give them reason, like being drunk, being an idiot, unsafe boating, littering, over your limit of fish, no license, etc. Even if the overzealous rookie cop having a bad day decides to give you a ticket, it will be maybe $150, and it will probably be just one for the group. Split that 3 or 4 ways and it really doesn't add much to the cost of a fishing trip. So not condoning drinking and boating, but a couple of beers per person and one for batter, don't overthink it up here in the great white north. Cheers and happy fishing!"

They also checked to make sure we had all of the required safety gear on board, including paddle, flashlight, horn, and throwable with rope."

Times change, and in most places in Ontario that I have fished in the last 30 years or so I have heard stories of someone getting fined for beer in the boat. As I recall, the fellow staying at our camp several years ago got fined around $150+/-. It can be easy to logic out that when in the middle of the wilderness, there is no/ almost no law, so the chances of being fined are unlikely, but this thought can quickly be set aside when suddenly it is the warden's time to use your lake as today's assignment. Bill"
3900522,northshoremb,2015-05-24 09:04:00,492,As far as I can ever remember you were never allowed to have a open beer in the boat. In all reality you can't even have non opened beer in a cooler in a boat unless in the original unopened box. Sucks it that's the law here in Ontario
3900866,alanexpup,2015-05-24 11:56:00,278,"I suppose if you were really using the beer for the batter in a shore lunch you could put the beer into one of those plastic bottle they put tea in and no one would know the difference, it going to be flat anyway. we always take a number of bottles of the green tea with."

We went as far as we could to the base of the rapids, threw anchor, and were just having a good time enjoying the scenery and throwing some spinners. Little did we know that the MNR access trail for the lake came in about 200 yards away. Well, while we sat there the MNR officers came in on ATV's pulling their boat. We had each had a beer or two at that point but were in no way intoxicated. I was fully expecting to get raked over the coals and maybe even fined...easy pickins. Sure enough, the officers came up and talked to us, checked our licenses, looked in the coolers, saw the emptys and a couple full ones, closed everything up and went on their way. Never said a word about the beer."

Of course a boat full of empties and signs of intoxication will likely not be overlooked."
3903258,Further North,2015-05-25 11:47:00,2008,"I guess I don't get why this is an issue...it's pretty plain to me that Canadians don't want people drinking while operating a boat and are willing to enforce that. At that point, it's up to the individual whether they want to risk getting caught or not. I don't, no beer in my boat in Canada. Don't need the hassle. Don't want the fine if we get caught. Fishing is expensive enough already."

CO asked ""are those for shore lunch?"" I could totally tell she was hinting at me to say yes. So I said yes, and that was it. Then there was the time when it was rainy and cold all week. We drank a few the first day and really didn't want to drink out in the boat due to the conditions. CO comes up and sees the empties. Didn't seem to care. Then I stopped drinking on the water for years. Kind of got back into it the last couple of years. I guess I'm willing to pay up if I do get cited."

Its not allowed where we go in Canada. I'm not that big of an alcoholic that I have to break the law and drink in the boat or have them in the boat while up in Canada. If beer batter for shore lunch is that important, mix it up ahead of time. The potential headaches that come with having beer don't even come close to making it worth it to sneak it with."

I have been taken when I was a kid or gone up to Canada since the 50s from my folks to us being parents and now retired taking ourselves up there. in the 50s my older brother did the trolling motor thing with oars. luckily I was still too young. beer became a problem when the number US residents were starting to drown in record numbers. it was funny when I read the story that these folks that did die of drowning were always found with their Zippers down meaning that they were peaing off the boat and slipped into the water without their life jacket on. on the point of coming in for lunch we always did that also to clean the slough of fish we caught and for some afternoooon delight!!!. then after recovering we would go out in the evening again. we will be up on Perrault lake for 2 weeks now that I have retired and there is no need to fish ""dark to dark"" as someone used to do, but just to enjoy the ability to rest and relax and enjoy the atmosphere on the lake."

I just cannot understand the annual discussions about beer in the boat. Have nothing against beer nor those who drink responsibly, but the regs are pretty clear. Why gamble on being checked by a CO or OPP officer who might be lenient and overlook one or two? I worked hard long ago to teach my kids that the important question is not, What are the odds of getting caught? but, rather, What are the rules? And don't get me started on the case/person/day reports.Several days ago I came within a whisker of starting a thread on ""What I do not need for a week of fishing in Canada."" My list would have started with:1) Eggs2) Beer3) Potatoes4) Any kind of meat products5) 3/4 of all the tackle I brought6)7)Right now I'm packing my truck to leave tomorrow for NW Ontario. Six guys in the group, all NWO veterans of many years. I'm taking the group's beer supply for the week (everyone bring their own distilled liquid of choice).

Never had any beer in the boat because we knew it was illegal but we asked about shore lunch. One CO said he would not question 1 beer for shore lunch batter the other time there were 2 CO's and they talked it over and said while it was against the letter of the law they would judge it on a case by case basis.

I believe the only time you can legally have alcohol in the boat is when you are transporting gear to or from a lodge or outpost. This comes up a lot on this board. Even a beer for shore lunch is illegal, but may be overlooked by the MNR."
3889265,MrSimon,2015-05-20 11:29:00,922,"That is true, and from what I've experienced and read on here, it is likely you'll be checked at least once or twice if you fish in Ontario regularly ... even guys at outposts have been checked. Fines can be pretty severe, or the officer might not care - you just never know. Based on the many pics that get posted on forums like this though, tons of people ignore the rule and take a decent amount of beer in the boat anyway."
3889753,dkrusin,2015-05-20 14:05:00,97,"It is NOT legal to even have 1 beer in the boat, unless you are on your way to a residence like an outpost cabin. Have been stopped twice in the last 6 years on the water while fishing and had beer in boat both times and they checked the coolers. We were reminded that beer is not legal but that was it. One officer even mentioned it would be a shame not to have a cold one at shore lunch. If you decide to have beer in the boat, don't get drunk, don't have beer cans laying all over, be very polite to the officer and you MAY be OK but no guarantees. No different then if you get caught speeding you have to be prepared to pay a fine, cuz it's not legal."

When they pulled up beside us, they saw the Goose Bay painted on the side and said, ""Goose Bay uh?!"" They looked at each other as if to say, ""we allready got one boat from there."" We got a lecture, one even suggested I be taken in for a breathalyzer test, I wasn't even driving the boat! Any way, we dont take beer on the boat anymore... except for this one flyin......Its not worth the hassle to try to sneak a beer or two much less the fines!"
