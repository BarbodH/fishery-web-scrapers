3760065,walleyestalker,2015-04-12 21:35:00,9,Herky I've been going to Ojibwa outfitters for years and love it. My only advice is watch where your going there are rocks that will take your skag off..
3763281,bigwillies,2015-04-13 18:16:00,515,There r rocks out there that will do more than that.some will absolutely ruin your trip.lac seul or any other bigger bodies of water in the area u better know we're u r goin.a guide just to teach u the travel routes would be a good idea. Pro v 1800 would know the routes and keep u off the rocks.
3763481,prov1800,2015-04-13 19:17:00,5010,Thx for that vote of confidence.lac seul definatly has some hidden surprises.and thats on both the east side as well as the west side.boaters should definatly know there currents and buoy colors for the ones that are left out there.the way things look right now i dont think the wster will be high unless we get a lot of rain.
3764073,Lmbkiller,2015-04-13 21:51:00,639,"I've been goin to lac seul for quite some time so for me navigation isn't an issue, but I'm curious, your statement of ""for the ones that are left"", what do u mean? Only reason I ask is that over the years bouys have been affected with. By that I mean, they have been moved, removed, switch of colors for direction of travel, floated away and washed up on shore who knows where, not removed before ice up prior year and get affected the following spring by a multitude of things maybe? Isn't the ministry supposed to remove/put out buoys? Good thing most people have good graphs and chips that give a ""general"" idea of the safe line of navigation from one end of the lake to the other"
3764105,Pooch,2015-04-13 22:28:00,4619,"I think I was told several years ago that the MNR or whomever is responsible for buoys didn't have the funds for buoy replacement. In the central area around the Mahkwa area, there are not many buoys left from when we first started going there.prov1800, I thought you guys had good snow this winter?Pooch"
3764289,prov1800,2015-04-14 05:25:00,5010,Actually the coast gaurd was responsible for the navigation buoys.but due to money they stopped maintaining them.up in the west end there are not many buoys left.on my lowrance chip there is a route placed on it that goes from earfalls to siuox lookout and up to chamberlaine narrows.it is the safe route. as far as getting a lot of snow.we did toward the latter part of feb.but with the gradual melt we had here it all just evaporated.there was little run off.and that with very low water last fall will probably have a low water start unless a lot of rain falls.
3950465,Mark Oakley,2015-06-09 14:04:00,21,i would recamend a guide. you have follow the fish. where you going what part. i am a guide that lake. feel free to ask me questions
3950953,Aspencreek,2015-06-09 16:07:00,2911,"Herky.....for a first timer I would without question hire a guide. It's a tremendous body of water, BUT not one you want to just take off and fish all day. Reasons are 1) It is not a bowl lake, there are underwater structures that will ruin your day if you don't know where they are and MOST are not marked, 2) It's a very big body of water with islands, bays, turns, etc. Getting lost without a good GPS and knowing how to use it is really easy, spending a night on one of those islands is a reality show I would watch. 3) Sometimes anything you throw and anyplace you go will produce fish, other days, not so much."
3951489,prov1800,2015-06-09 18:57:00,5010,I have fished the east side and they still have a lot of the navigation markers in place.but on the west side there are markers missing due to ice moving them out.sometimes someone puts a jug there and it gets rough and its gone.on my navioncs chip.the canada one.they show up on your unit where they are supposed to be.but those arecthe navigation markers.you get away from going to point A to poibt B and thats where you have to be carefull.but taking your time would be in your best interest.pick a area you want to fish and work it slowly.once youve mastered that area mive on to another section.you will get to know where and how to navigate through areas.
3715874,rnnonmt,2015-03-31 17:54:00,992,+1 on making sure you have a lake map of the section you are going to be staying/fishing. If you are a good navigator a paper map with you in the boat will do. If you aren't so good I recommend taking along a handheld gps. Lac Seul is very very large and has a lot of open water and a lot of river type arms that can get you turned around. It can be easy to get turned around if you are not a good navigator. If you have a GPS FF capable of displaying a lake map that will most likely be cheaper than a HH GPS. Finding walleyes is fairly easy on Lac Seul if you have fished for walleyes before so a guide is not a necessity but if you haven't then a guide for the first day or two will be to your advantage. Most camp owners want you to enjoy fishing and come back to their place so they will give you areas to mark on a map. I have been fishing north of chamberlain since the early 80's and know that area pretty well. I just recently started fishing the SE section the last 3 years or so. One thing I am confident is that you will enjoy the fishing.
3715890,rnnonmt,2015-03-31 17:58:00,992,I forgot to mention I always go the first/second week in June so the walleye habits I am used to are going to be a little different in July. Im guessing not too much different other than they will be deeper. We are usually fishing 7-14 FOW. I'm sure some of the guys that go in July can provide better info.
3715978,Aspencreek,2015-03-31 18:20:00,2911,"Hiring a guide is a personal preference, but they will not only show you some new techniques but get you on patterns that may take the entire week to get on without a guide. But most importantly for me, when I was new to LS was the confidence I got for traveling around out there after being with the guide. This IS NOT a soup bowl lake. Travel routes need to be learned and obeyed. There are mid-lake reefs and boulders that can and do take all the fun out of a day on the lake if you are not careful, and the lake maps and GPS lake maps are somewhat accurate with some structure obstacles but certainly not all. And finally, you would not believe how easy it is to get turned around on some parts of this lake, and you are lost. GPS will get you there and back but without one ""be a good map reader, and keep track of where you are. Spending a night on an island would not be my idea of fun."
3722002,CMesserschmidt,2015-04-02 13:23:00,1006,"Jig and a minnow in July hasn't failed me in July, August, or September. I have tried everything and still just tie on a jig. Last year I even tried trolling crank baits for fun. 1 fish in a half hour, said screw it and went back to jigging haha! Firetiger stand up jig, or a school bus yellow jig always works."
3722210,Aspencreek,2015-04-02 14:39:00,2911,"One thing that also needs to be shared about LS. Because of the stained water, although some of the fish will move deeper during the hot mid-days not all will. I concentrate on mid-lake humps (deep water coming up to humps), points with rocky shorelines, and weed lines along soft shore. Now that being said I backtroll inline spinner rigs (minnow, leech or worms), and floating stickbaits behind bottom bouncers. I try to stay close to the weed lines and if I find a concentration we will then jig or slip bobber. My biggest walleye was caught during shore lunch, simple floating jig with a minnow with a split shot about 2' above, from shore, in July, in about 12' of water, came in at 29 1/2"". And Yes, I pinched the tail to get there, still looking for that 30""."
3726162,Baseline,2015-04-03 17:54:00,3207,"A good place for a first timer to go in July or August is Chamberlin Narrows Lac Suel Outposts. It's on the Sioux Lookout (East) Side. They have about 10 cabins and usually have an opening in mid summer, but I wouldn't wait too long. They have American Plan or Housekeeping. The cabins are located about 30 miles from the landing and they lead you in your own boat or transport you if you use their boats. The only boats you will see are some from the resort and maybe a houseboat or two. Walleyes are easy to find and they provide information on where to go. Not hard to navigate around. Pike fishing is also very good. Good luck."
3726242,pjshorthorn,2015-04-03 18:14:00,5654,"I've stayed at this camp 6 or 7 times over the last 10 years. Nice camp on a great area of Lac Seul. Cabins are nice, boats are in great shape with new motors. Fishing spots are close and at the end of the evening you can fish off of the dock and catch a number of fish .. some as large as you may have during the day. There is no American plan at this camp unless it has changed in the last year or so. PjShorthorn"
3727930,fishman10,2015-04-04 09:55:00,226,"I lived in Sioux lookout, and fish the Hudson area ( lost lake) I use my 14 foot boat and 20 hp. Nice to have a bigger outfit, but I don't go far, no need to. As stated above, rocky points bottlenecks, reefs, islands, buoys etc. you will have no problem catching fish. Also, look for other boats, they will be fishing a spot for a reason. Ask other fisherman or lodge owners, they will be happy to point you in the right direction. Pm me and I can provide you with a map."
3737610,cuamb,2015-04-06 21:50:00,203,I am from Wisconsin and have fished this lake over 25 times. I went in July for the first time 3 years ago. I tried to hire a guide but couldn't find one. I really believe if you can afford it a guide will save you a long learning process. We caught fish but burned a lot of gas searching the first couple of days. You don't need one to catch fish but they will get you on a pattern right away and you can search on your own after that. We have some great guides on the site who contribute to these discussions. I encourage you to use them. Good luck and you will have a great time.
3745218,prov1800,2015-04-08 17:18:00,5010,"Actually when you come out of the williams bay creek there is a lot of traffic in that area.you get all thectraffic from people putting there boats in atcwilluams bay, silver water wheel boats and boats from earfalls, scout bay.etc."
3713442,Herkyhawk00,2015-03-31 07:50:00,36,"I was thinking about heading to Lac Seul this July as it is talked about very highly on here. I've never fished it before. Because of a busy schedule, I will have to make arrangements closer to that time frame. Though I realize that limits where I can go, I was just curious if Lac Seul demands a guide to become better acquainted with the water or if one can still be very successful possibly getting tips from people on this site, at the camp, and using one's own gut instincts? Thanks in advance."
3713570,LoDo,2015-03-31 08:11:00,721,"The first question most are going to ask is where on Lac Seul will you be going? The lake runs 100+ miles, stretchy from Ear Falls to the far northwest to Sioux Lookout and beyond to the far east. I can help in the Ear Falls to MacKenzie Bay area within the lake. I don't know much about Sioux Lookout and the Chamberlan Narrows area. LoDo"
3713626,Herkyhawk00,2015-03-31 08:24:00,36,"Yeah, that's a good question. I guess that will be something I need to ask as I get closer to the time. I have no idea where I will be staying yet as I can't commit to a time. Just hoping a site will have availability. Thank you!"
3713682,Guest,2015-03-31 08:37:00,0,"Try Williams Lake Lodge on Lac Seul, they have openings in July. The owners are nice and they have a guide Brian who will put you on fish. The lodge is clean and organized, with nice boats and motors."
3713938,SinOrSwim,2015-03-31 09:38:00,1528,Can you get to the main lake easily from williams lake lodge?
3714970,Guest,2015-03-31 13:00:00,0,In July the creek from Williams lake to Lac Seul will take 10-15 minutes to traverse. This part of the lake will have fewer boats and you may see the LIMEYANGLER on the water.
3715034,Fisher-man,2015-03-31 13:18:00,422,"You won't need a guide. If you have done any walleye fishing at all, just hit points and reefs and islands in the wind. Start at 30' and work up. All of the rental boats should have some kind of depth finder. Go to Lake maps, get a map of the lake and take a compass. You will catch fish."
3715242,Timing,2015-03-31 14:12:00,95,Well stated
3715322,Herkyhawk00,2015-03-31 14:25:00,36,Thanks all for taking the time to reply. I will probably ask further questions when I have a better idea of where I am staying.
3715642,LoDo,2015-03-31 16:46:00,721,This ^ You'll be fishing in deeper water so be sure to have enough weight to get your bait down. Best of luck!!
