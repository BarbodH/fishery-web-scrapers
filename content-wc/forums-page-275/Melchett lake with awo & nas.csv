Most eyes between 16 & 21"". Melchett Lake is a fish factory. Most fish caught by jigging. Weather good except for day leaving. Plane had to try 3 times to pick us up. Very bad fog. Now back in Ohio and will start planning next year's trip."

This time later in the year so we make sure we can get to the camp. Does Remi end up flying u guys in and out now since he sold the other camps? Or does he use nakina air still?Steve
