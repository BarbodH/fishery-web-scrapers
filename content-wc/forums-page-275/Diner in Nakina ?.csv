3946945,onetimedave,2015-06-08 15:06:00,502,No place to eat in Nakina. Must eat in Gearldton. We at at a place on right side of road when entering town. Sorry but I can't remember name but a lot of local vehicles parked there.
3947121,Clemmer,2015-06-08 16:30:00,1,"The place in Geraldton is the Crown and Anchor. Good food, popular with us locals. The place in Nakina closed last fall. Then in the winter the building ran out of propane and pipes froze. Water damaged a good par of the building. It has been all fixed but no one has come forward to lease and re-open the diner."

It is on the right side of the road going up, smack dab in the middle of metro Geraldton. Bill"
3952097,Travis Schallock,2015-06-09 21:48:00,37,"There is still no restaurant open in Nakina. But Friday, Saturday, Sunday mornings there is hot breakfast sandwiches, and sausage out at Nakina Air Service sea plane base. Local guy, everything done fresh on a BBQ. I haven't had it, but supposed to be good."
