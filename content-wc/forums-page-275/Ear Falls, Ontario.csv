3947113,team walleye,2015-06-08 16:28:00,336,"I'm heading up to Perrault Falls to Perrault Lake early Saturday morning. We pull the boat out and take it up to Ear Falls once during the trip to fish the English river for a morning. Always catch some nice walleye. Last trip a guy in our group caught a 27"" Walleye. Fun river to fish! Also.. I can't remember what it's called but they have a pretty nice bait shop up there too. Hope you have a good trip! Make sure to report back how you do! Maybe I will see you up there!Bryan"
3947401,Pooch,2015-06-08 18:07:00,4619,"Bait shop you are probably referring to is ""Four Seasons"" (I think). They used to have some tackle and a little clothing. Have not been there for years.Pooch"
3947473,team walleye,2015-06-08 18:33:00,336,"Yes, I believe that is the one. I haven't been there since June of 2013 but they did still have tackle and clothing. They were very helpful of what to use and where to go on the English to hook into walleye."

3948449,Bstar,2015-06-09 05:16:00,564,"You had to bring up the Packers! Well, the Bears are coming at you this year. We finally have a respectable coaching staff and I guarantee that Jay Cutler will complete at least 4 passes.......to the Packers!"
