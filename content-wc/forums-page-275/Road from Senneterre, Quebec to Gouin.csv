3949225,tshea,2015-06-09 08:18:00,36,I was on it a couple weeks ago - its in perfect shape all the way up to R1009. R1009 sas closed just west due to bad road conditions and there was an alternate way top get into Martins. An easy 2 hours of gravel from Senneterre to R1009 and none of the Parent Road excitement.
