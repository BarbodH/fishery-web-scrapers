3938113,emma17,2015-06-05 07:24:00,436,"Thanks Mr P.I've always wanted to explore the western end but run into the same problem every year. With only 4 days to fish, it's hard to justify passing up good fishing spots to see new things. One of these years I hope to get a week or even two up there. Take the pressure off a bit. Best to you and the others making trips up this year."
3944689,MuskyMaster,2015-06-07 19:25:00,79,"Up here now. To make it short and sweet the yellow perch xrap is on fire. Smallies on the shores with walleye mixed in, pike are in the weeds. Pretty typical fishing. The evening bite has been better for walleyes bit we're only on day 2. Seen quite a few 40+ musky and pike cruising real shallow. Biggest is 30 on the xrap. No big eyes yet just plenty of eaters. Still debating a trip to shoal later in the week."
3928953,mrpike24,2015-06-02 12:54:00,54,"I leave towards the end of next week and just curious if anyone had any first hand reports. Looks like the water temp in the main basin south of Kenora is holding around 55 degrees, I'm assuming the water level has been coming up with the rain they have been having over the past 3 weeks. We typically just fish the Western Arm, didn't know if anyone had anything else to pass along. Happy fishing to all....can't wait!"
3929649,Dog,2015-06-02 15:52:00,210,I was talking to a guy yesterday that has a cottage in that area and he said water temp was up to 59 and the water level is still down about 2 1/2' but slowly coming up in the last 10 days.
3930161,MuskyMaster,2015-06-02 18:28:00,79,"I leave Friday morning for lotw, haven't seen many reports but all the ones have been decent."
3930193,JMKC,2015-06-02 18:43:00,238,"Posting this from camp on Northeast corner of LOW. Bigstone Bay was 56 degrees yesterday with a pretty good wind out of the south/southeast. Fishing spotty but excellent today. Raining pretty steady right now, probably stay in and go out early tomorrow, forecast looks a lot better. Air temp at 8 PM is 60 degrees. JJ"
3931105,deadhead1,2015-06-03 07:12:00,193,I am in the same part of the lake (Storm Bay)and I would say it has been as good as I have ever seen it but fish are starting to move. Sometime you have to look for them but usually can find good numbers. Starting to catch on some humps. Weather has been windy and cool so not many boats out but If weather is better I expect lots of boats on weekend.
3934041,MuskyMaster,2015-06-04 00:54:00,79,"I'm leaving in 26 hours staying by moore bay. Seems like we have some good consistent weather coming up, fishing should be great. We plan on fishing a lil bit of everything. Hear the channel to shoal is good, plan on hitting that one day. Will post when I get back."
3934793,mrpike24,2015-06-04 07:57:00,54,"MuskyMaster- I have heard anything from Above Average - Very good reports as well....I leave a week from today. Have also had a couple reports come back with no issues to Shoal Lake, I'll enter through the rapids at least twice for the week I'm there. I'll also be attempting to target just about everything up there this year, guessing walleyes will be both shallow and on some humps by the time we get there, will target the shallow areas first. They may need some warm days coming up to really get that weed growth going, haven't heard much in regards to that this year. Best of Luck to you!"
3935521,emma17,2015-06-04 10:55:00,436,"Mr. Pike, I'm curious as to where you are heading on LOW. I know you said you spend your time on the Western Arm. Are you going to the NE side of LOW this time and then boating to Shoal Lake? If so, how long of a boat trip is that?"
3936073,mrpike24,2015-06-04 13:31:00,54,"Emma17- I'm just a couple miles from Ash Bay, so it's a very easy run to the entrance for me. Once your through, i'll still run about 10 miles down to where the narrows open up until the main lake. From Kenora the entrance to the Rapids is probably right between 15-20 miles, so it's a pretty good haul unless you're comfortable with the route and like to burn gas! I know we see Wiley Point boats up there almost every day, which is probably pretty close to the same distance as Kenora to the rapids. WE did see one Wiley Boat being towed by another Wiley boat last year, at about 5 miles per/hour. Couldn't tell if they had engine problems or hit a rock, lower unit was still attached. Needless to say, it was a long night for them. Be careful and study your map in detail before going. Good fishing and even less boat traffic then the other parts of the lake."
3937529,MuskyMaster,2015-06-04 20:56:00,79,Man I'm excited!! Like a lil kid on Christmas eve! Doubt I'll get much sleep but I'm not driving atleast to start. Still haven't seen any bad reports but I don't expect to. Everything should be shallow and on the drops. shall be fun. Anyone know what am station I can pick the hawks game on up thete? I'm 2-0 going on fishing trips during their stanley cup.
