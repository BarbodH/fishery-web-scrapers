3951313,Bstar,2015-06-09 18:06:00,564,"Drove 502 and 105 in the dark twice and that was enough. The first time was in '88 my first trip to Canada. My wife and I went to Keystone Lodge on Wabaskang. Midweek we found out that my father-in-law was not doing well so we decided to head back home that evening. We were driving on 502 coming down a hill with a curve to the right and a ravine on both sides. We were towing a boat and it was dark, really dark when a huge bull moose decided he wanted to cross the road in front of us. It was like like slow motion. He could not decide which way to go and by the time we passed each other we were parallel and he was taller than our vehicle! If we would have hit him it would have been over. Needless to say, every shadow from that point on was a moose, a deer, Sasquatch or any other animal imaginable until we hit 11 outside of Fort Frances. It turns out that my Father-In-Law passed that night. I like to think it was around the time we met that moose. The second time was 3 years ago. We went on a fly-in with Amik Outposts out of Red Lake and they asked us if we would like to fly in a day early because they had a group that wanted to come out on Friday. They flew us in a day early at no extra charge to save on fuel. We couldn't pass up an extra days fishing which was awesome. So we drove up 502 & 105 through the night to be at their dock by 6:30. Although the drive was uneventful we were all burned out from the night driving. Never again. Too old for that crap!"
3951329,Bstar,2015-06-09 18:13:00,564,"Forgot to say I'm with Dstar because he's my brother. Drive to IFalls on Friday, get a meal and a few barley pops and a good nights rest. Drive the rest of the way Saturday. I do like the idea of staying in Fort Frances to avoid the border on Sat. Maybe next time."

3923705,MrSimon,2015-06-01 06:48:00,922,"We've done it many times, but always arriving at the border at dawn. We always had four or five drivers and switched every three hours. Guy in passenger seat had to be awake at all times. It wasn't too bad. Coming home is horrible! We won't drive in Canada at night. Too dangerous. Now we just leave REALLY early in the morning and get there at dark. Works great."
3926281,10lbeye,2015-06-01 18:54:00,61,"Before my wife and I tied the knot (26 yrs ago), she instituted the ""2 hour rule."" I was skeptical at first, but as with most things, she was right. Here's the rule: we stop every 2 hours and switch drivers. 5-10 min stop to relieve the bladder and/or stretch/get the blood re-circulating, and I'm telling you it does the trick. nice to have some down time to rest the eyes and refresh. Of course, you can modify to 3 or even 4 hrs, but it works."
3926737,bthomas3333,2015-06-01 20:43:00,465,I think staying awake is only a small part of the battle. The govt of Canada does a pretty good job of cutting back the forest so they have pretty wide clearcut shoulders. When you drive at night time you just can't see the shoulders well. Two weeks ago I was driving back from Kenora and had a Coyote run out of the forest which I saw because it was 6p. It ran straight towards the road and I was able to stop but only because I saw the whole shoulder. Driving in remote areas at night with limited visibility of the shoulders when there are so many different animals is really just gambling with mother nature.If you could guarantee me you could stay awake all night I still wouldn't want to drive at night.B-
3927193,Baseline,2015-06-02 05:30:00,3207,"After reading this thread I'm glad I live in Northern MN. We can leave the house at 7am and drive to lakes just north of Ignace and Dryden in time for several hours of fishing in the afternoon. I used to have the night driving experience driving south to KY and Tenn to visit my family. Most of the time I would work most of a day then take off south around 4 or 5 PM. I usually did pretty well until about 4 or 5 am when I would feel the crash. From then on it was just toughing it out. Several times I had no choice, but to pull into a rest area and sleep for a couple hours. Then, after I arrived, it was tough day because the family wanted to visit and do things. I took me two or three days to get back in sync. I finally just quit doing it. I would either add a travel day or shorten the stay."
3927217,octanehi5,2015-06-02 05:52:00,1104,"Our crew from Virginia leaves two days early, stopping just shy of the boarder the first night,driveing to the plane base the next day stay over night and fly out fresh in the morning. Driving far all night just makes you exhausted, for your valuable fishing time. As a few guys have stated There are alot of Critters out at night, a Moose or a Bear is not something you want to run into"
3927617,HeHooksHimself,2015-06-02 07:25:00,725,"We leave from Indiana at different times, depending upon the situation. However, we almost always drive through the night going. Our group size ranges from 2-8, so the situation changes based upon what week we go and how many vehicles are included. Usually the problem is the driver doesn't want to admit they are getting heavy eyed. We have a pact that no matter how quickly the driver fades, they have to own up to it and rotate in another driver or, if everyone is zoned, we must just pull over and sleep for however long it takes. While driving through northern Wisconsin and Minnesota, the copilot must help look for deer and wildlife if it is dark. There are some great advantages, like crossing the border at 4 am. This year they didn't ask us about anything but poultry. It literally took 30 seconds and there was no one in line. As I get older, I get less and less sleep anyway, so we haven't had great problems. On the way home, we hit V Bay about 9 am and without stopping at the Village Corner (Gee, I miss that place) we get back to South Bend about 2 am. Tired, but still engaged. This works for us, but I know there is some risk."
3946625,pastorted,2015-06-08 12:31:00,19,"We have two phases to our trips up to Ear Falls. We start from Louisville, Kentucky and drive to Cedar Falls, Iowa, or Chicago, IL, (depending upon who is going). We gather the rest of the group there, rest a little, eat supper and head on out around midnight. This way we are traveling on 4 lane interstates all the time through the night and puts us in International Falls sometime after dawn. Usually there is little traffic at the border. Then the trip through Canada is all day light. Total drive time is about 23 hours, but it goes really fast this way. We rotate drivers every 2 hours. But no matter what time of the day or night you have to stay alert. Last trip, coming down Interstate 35, middle of the day, encountered a women heading north-bound in the south-bound lanes. How she managed that, I will never know, but it very nearly caused what would have surely been a fatal crash."
3946761,dstar49,2015-06-08 13:47:00,33,We do our trip in 2 stages. First day leave Chicago area about 4am drive to International Falls arrive about 4pm have nice dinner relax and still get to bed decent hour. Next day can't check into camp in Ear Falls area till 3pm so we don't have to leave early stop do our shopping for perishables and then only have a 5 hour drive to our camp. we are well rested and ready to go fishing.
3918513,Draco1206,2015-05-30 04:25:00,175,Thanks for all your helpful suggestions.
3918785,10point,2015-05-30 06:47:00,102,I would think we would have a better chance of hitting a deer if we left early morning from here in Indiana. The population in northern Michigan really isn't that great. We normally hit the border about sunrise and aren't in moose area during dark horse.
3918921,Obabikon,2015-05-30 07:20:00,2370,I love driving in the night. Less traffic. Audiobooks are amazing. They keep your mind working which (for me at least) keeps me from even getting sleepy. Find a good book or two and download them or buy on CD.
3919185,Ogoki,2015-05-30 08:34:00,291,"I try , especially since I have gotten older, to avoid any all night driving. We do leave from here in Ohio very early , like 3 a.m.. Seems like I don't have any issues then. One BIG THING that I especially avoid at night is driving using the cruise control. I stay more alert when I have to control the speed myself. When we did the all nighters , we were draggy the next two days . Took away from the trip."
3919265,rnnonmt,2015-05-30 09:02:00,992,"We used to drive through the night all the time when we were only driving a car or truck and not towing a boat. We had plenty of drivers and who ever was riding shotgun had to stay awake to make sure the driver had someone to keep them occupied with conversation and help keep on the look out for deer and moose. That's when were driving from Chicago. Now that I'm living in Phoenix we started taking our RV and towing our boat we stopped night driving. It takes way too long to stop 60ft of RV and a boat in tow when a deer, elk, bear, mountain lion, moose, or who knows what else is spotted on the shoulder or road way. Not only do you have to worry about animals what about breakdowns and flats. Are you prepared to deal with a disabled vehicle, change flats in the pitch dark etc etc?? If you absolutely have to drive through the night you need to keep your wits about you and be prepared for the ""what-if"" situation."
3919729,JAY221,2015-05-30 13:57:00,877,"Back when various members of the group couldn't get out of work to leave early Friday we would have to drive all night to get there. I am happy that those days are over & we leave early & get up to Dryden way before dark. It makes for a much better trip in my opinion. I have done it but don't miss it one bit. Later, Jay"
3920593,Live to jig,2015-05-30 22:19:00,159,We time it so we start our trip in the dark when we are so giddy about being on the road there is no sleeping at all!!!
3920705,forgop,2015-05-30 23:31:00,880,I work nights. No problem at all.
3920753,roscoe33,2015-05-31 00:30:00,653,"There are no tricks. Being INVOLVED in an active conversation can help keep you awake, but will distract you from the driving. When your brain decides to shut down, it is time for a nap. 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 3 hours, whatever, TAKE A NAP !!! Wayside, parking lot, gas station, side street, anywhere you can. I worked 3rd shift for years, but when away from work, my brain would shut off at 3:30- 3:45 every night. Didn't matter how much coffee I drank, or how loud the music was, or how much fresh air was blowing in my face. A few years ago, I got 8 hours sleep, got up, threw the cooler in the truck and headed up to Canada. Only made it 45 miles before I had to pull over and take an hour nap. Yep, it was 4 am, and my brain went fizzle. If you are tired, pull over, or have someone else drive. Plan for it."
3920977,pjshorthorn,2015-05-31 06:37:00,5654,"rnnonmt brings up a good point about having to deal with the unexpected when it is dark out. On the way home a number of years ago I was driving,son riding shotgun and an uncle in back. I told my son (13 at the time) if he was riding shotgun he had to stay awake and help look for deer. The son and uncle both fell asleep shortly after dark and at 9:30 pm I drilled a deer at 65 mph. I'm not sure how the boat didn't end up jackknifed or in the bed of the truck. Both guys woke up pretty quick.It was a complete pain to try and figure out if the truck was drivable, were any parts going to fall off if we drove it, was the boat still secure on the trailer, find a gas station close by to where we were, call the DNR to report the deer kill etc. Etc. Felt terrible about the whole situation as it was my uncle's truck,but no one got injured. Haven't driven all night since......... PjShorthorn."
3917409,muskyman73,2015-05-29 16:37:00,402,The fear of hitting a moose or deer is what keeps me awake........... or winding up like thishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhlR3vidvp0
3917681,bthomas3333,2015-05-29 17:54:00,465,"Hey, We have done it a few times and I can say out of like 6 times we had near misses with a moose and deer at least three times. I highly suggest you don't do it. Awake or asleep if an animal darts out of the bush while you are going 60-65 mph you are in a very bad spot. If you have to do it. I concur about the 2-3 hr nap at dawn. The hardest time to stay awake is around 4a-5a. B-"
3917769,LoDo,2015-05-29 18:42:00,721,Our group rides up in a 1978 Forrester RV. Classic! Two drivers up front must stay awake while the others slowly fade around 2-3am. Switch drivers a few times throughout the trip.
3917977,Richard B,2015-05-29 19:58:00,735,I drive solo 900+ miles pulling my boat. I drink lots of coffee and water. If I get hungry I do not anything that is heavy or greasy. I normally eat cereal and beef jerky. Once I get tired I may have a candy bar. A GPS that talks is a good thing if you are driving by yourself. The occasional voice will jolt you a little bit when you are not ready for it. Open the windows and do not listen to easy listening music!
3918033,Fishin Fun,2015-05-29 20:33:00,218,We don't do it. Used to do it. But one too many trips at 65 mph in the ditch with everyone including the driver sleeping. Lucky to still be here.
3918089,bfish,2015-05-29 20:52:00,1096,"Let the night owls and/or 3rd shift workers drive through the night. Driver and Co-piliot awake at all times. If one fades, then switch drivers or find a place to sleep through the night. I like staying up an hour or two extra for a couple nights before the trip (and sleep in too), if I am the one pulling night shift duty. Easy to over do it on caffeine and crash, test your reaction before taking it."
3918113,Ranger319,2015-05-29 20:57:00,166,"Rotate drivers, ice cold bottles of water, stop/switch as soon as one starts to get heavy eyed. No one sleeps in my truck that last turn to Sioux Lookout. Dead tired but once you make that last turn, crank up with Doors cd and jam out the last stretch. Frog rapids is such a great sight"
3918177,Draco1206,2015-05-29 21:25:00,175,"Amen to that! Nearly happened to me last year. We don't seem to have a problem on the trip up to Nakina, everyone is hyped up, we leave at 5-6am and drive to Geraldton and spend the night. Our problem staying awake is on the trip home. Everyone is tired from a long week of fishing and no one is excited about the long drive home. Last year on the way home driving east on hwy 11, we had just stopped in Longlac for some snacks and a bathroom break maybe a half hour earlier. I was driving my truck with my daughters boyfriend and his father with me. My older brother was driving his truck right behind us with my son and younger brother. Both of my passengers fell asleep and I remember putting in a CD with my favorite mix of songs. I dozed off and the next thing I see is the face of a man driving a pickup coming head on. I managed to swerve to the left to the far shoulder of the road but nearly lost it on the gravel and almost went over the edge down a steep embankment. How I managed to keep from going over I'll never know. Anyhow I did get back on the road and over to my side just as my passengers woke up. It was surreal. The one thing I remember most was ""Fred Bear"" my favorite song was playing on the CD when I woke up. I don't know if it was Devine Intervention that that song was playing and I woke up in the nick of time, but I'd like to think someone was watching over me. There are so many semis on that stretch of hwy it's a miracle we didn't get smacked by one. And can you imagine what my son and two brothers were going through? They could do nothing but watch. A couple things we will change this year is that a co pilot must stay awake, change drivers more often, take more breaks, and if you are driving more than one vehicle, two way radios always on in each vehicle."
3918193,btyreprich,2015-05-29 21:27:00,1067,"When our group was young, we'd leave the Chicago area after 3 pm and drive straight through till we got to our lodge. Later on we tried to sleep in the car while parked in a pulp check area. Very, very uncomfortable. Finally I put my foot down and said we now wil leave our homes early on Friday and overnight in Int Falls. Initially we'd arrive at the hotel after most of the restaurants had closed for the evening. This year we will leave ""crazy early"" so as to be in Int Falls in time for a 5 pm dinner followed by cards and beer in our hotel room. I We like the night in the hotel as we arrive relaxed and ready to fish hard that first day. It's also nice to socialize with everyone on Friday evening at dinner. I agree with all the previous post on not driving through the night. It's just too dangerous as you get tired and the wildlife are far more active at night. Be safe on your trip up to Canads. If you must drive straight through, consider doing it on the way home."
3918497,dutchboy,2015-05-30 04:01:00,5717,I seems to me that if you can afford to trip you should be able to come up with time to get there and back home again without killing yourselves.
3917010,10point,2015-05-29 14:58:00,102,Any tricks for staying awake while driving through the night to Canada? I don't drink coffee. I have never tried an energy drink and I was wondering about that.
3917073,dutchboy,2015-05-29 15:14:00,5717,"Biggest trick is don't do it. It will mess up your trip big time if you fall a sleep and kill yourself or others. If you insist on doing it.........................stop around 4 am and sleep for 2-3 hours, even if it's in the front seat. The period of ""dawn"" is the killer. More people fall a sleep with the sun coming up then in the middle of the night. Windows down, radio up, catch a BIG sugar rush (Mountain Dew, chocolate ect)"
3917161,Blades-n-Beads,2015-05-29 15:32:00,484,"X2 with dutchboy, it's not worth it. Even if you don't kill yourself hit a moose and your travels are done. Plenty of places to hold up at for a few hrs."
3917217,10point,2015-05-29 15:40:00,102,We do it every year. I'm not sure we could stop with everything in the boat and all. Not sure we could carry it all into a hotel room.
3917233,Freytown,2015-05-29 15:46:00,770,Well then...what's your question??? Let me ask...how do you stay awake????
3917249,revitup,2015-05-29 15:47:00,140,"I always have sunflower seeds to eat. Keeps me busy and always works if I am starting to get tired. Gotta have them in the shell. It's the cracking of the shell and activity that helps keep me alert. And besides hardly any calories as opposed to candy, peanuts, etc."
3917257,Lovetofish,2015-05-29 15:48:00,458,I tried the 5 hour energy once. When it kicked in I was stopping every half hour to pee.
3917273,flntknp17,2015-05-29 15:58:00,151,"I leave central Iowa around 3pm.....hit the border around 1am.....head towards Dryden and typically stop at one of the unimproved boat ramps (normally Jackfish Lake) and nap for about 2-3 hours....then I'm in Ear Falls for a full day of fishing Saturday. The short nap is a very good idea and better IMHO than any energy drink, though a couple sugar free Red Bulls are always part of the trip. The BEST way to stay awake is to have the #%@×! scared out of you by a moose standing in the ditch on a highway without shoulders! Just my $0.02 Matt"
3917297,10point,2015-05-29 16:04:00,102,I don't really know. I think the excitement of the trip keeps me awake. I share driving duty with my Dad. I was hoping my Son would be available to drive this year but he hasn't got his permit yet and can't get it till we get his passport in the mail with his birth certificate. We have 2 weeks. If passport doesn't we will have a bigger problem.
3917345,Bill Krejca,2015-05-29 16:14:00,6107,"We used to do it when younger. Sunflower seeds are good, coffee and/or coke, Mt. D, etc, help. Before stopping it completely, we would stop for several hrs and sleep in car, that helped. In the last 20 years or so, the deer population increased from what it was when we used to do this, so that should be a consideration. Last time I drove into the evening, 1-1/2 years ago, north of Deer River, MN( where'd they come up with that name?!), I 'd guess we saw 50 -60 deer along the side of the road - they seem to like feeding on the roadside grass after dark. We hadn't planned on driving through there after dark, but start plans got delayed. The question comes up, when alternating drivers - should the shotgun catch some sleep, so he can relieve the driver, or should he stay awake to keep a conversation going? Pretty easy to doze off if no one is keeping your mind fresh. As an afterthought, I remember several years during the 70's when many gas stations either closed completely, or closed after dark, due to the gas shortage. We filled up our cans and emptied into the vehicles as needed. We were able to do this, which enabled us to get to the next open station before running out. I guess this another story. I wouldn't do it, we don't want to be reading about you here except in the trip report. Take care, Bill"
