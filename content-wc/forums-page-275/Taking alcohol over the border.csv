3940849,Bayou,2015-06-06 08:54:00,52,"Well that makes sense, thanks."
3942401,forgop,2015-06-07 00:22:00,880,"It's discretionary whether they want to impose the duty. Back in fall of 2007, I took my dad on a road trip to Windsor because he really liked Caffrey's Irish Ale and wanted a keg (Coors had restricted the sale in the US). His cancer had completely spread through his abdomen by this point. I arranged for the purchase of a keg through The Beer Store and the agent asked what we'd done in Canada and if we had anything to declare. I explained the reason for the trip with receipt in hand. The guy really didn't seem to get the level of sanity one would really have to drive 300 miles+ each way for a keg of beer, but just waved us through without charging anything. I often think that if you're polite and you're not declaring enough to make too much of an issue, they'd rather just avoid the paperwork altogether, no matter which direction you're headed."
3942441,alberta bum,2015-06-07 04:08:00,312,"The Windsor/Detroit border also has 15000+ vehicles a day go over it. It's not worth their time to take up that parking spot for $15.. Returning to Canada at that crossing. I regularly declare up to $5-600 in taxable goods and get told to have a nice day. Crossing at Portal North Dakota where there is 500 vehicles a day crossing, exact to have your vehicle searched every time you cross."
3942977,LoDo,2015-06-07 08:19:00,721,"One case (24beers) or one 1L bottle of liquor is allowed from the US to Canada duty free. All additional beer or liquor will be charged a duty tax. Present your receipt of all booze to border crossing agents, go inside, pay the tax and continue on your trip. I highly recommend presenting all your booze to the agents rather than trying to hide booze in the boat, camper, vehicle, etc... I've seen too many times people caught up trying to get away with not declaring additional booze and your time at the border triples. Might be a fine in there too!"
3943777,drlee,2015-06-07 14:55:00,409,"I went across with a couple of guys a few years back. We had some duty responsibility, took care of it and moved on with no problems. Found out later that one of the guys had loaded water bottles with vodka. Last invitation he received to go to Canada with me."
3938345,KoolBlue,2015-06-05 08:50:00,23,"So, I know you are limited to one bottle of liquor going over but my question is, are you allowed to take more if you are willing to tell them you have it and pay the duty on it? The reason I ask is we are heading up next week and I want to take a few bottles over. I can buy them here for 20 bucks each but in Maniwaki the same bottles are 45-50 each which is crazy. I'm willing to tell them what I have and pay it but don't want to get turned around or in trouble either."
3938489,SinOrSwim,2015-06-05 09:21:00,1528,"You will be fine. Just report what you have. We write a list and hand it to them. They will calculate the duty you owe, you pay and you are free to go. If it is a large quantity they may ask you more questions and be aholes about it but thats about it."
3938537,Carnhzkr,2015-06-05 09:36:00,964,"I don't bring more than my legal allotment, so I've never had to pay duty, but some guys on here say they keep their receipt to show how much you paid for the booze. If you search the site, you may find a link to a web page on which you can calculate the amount of duty. As I recall, the duty is based on the alcohol content, amount, and $$ paid. Incidentally, if it's liquor you're bringing over, I'd bet you could save a lot of money buying at the duty free, over the price you'll pay at your local liquor store. Usually, Crown Royal is dirt cheap."
3938585,tv4fish,2015-06-05 09:51:00,2694,I THINK we paid $26.00 a liter last year. For my group - that's a MUST buy.
3938609,bigwalleye1,2015-06-05 09:57:00,2632,"If you're bringing a mix of liquor and beer, claim the liquor, pay duty on the beer. Cheaper that way."
3939161,KoolBlue,2015-06-05 12:58:00,23,Do you pay the duty right there at the checkpoint or do you have to pull in and walk inside to pay?
3939209,ftfarms,2015-06-05 13:11:00,444,They'll tell you to pull over and you go inside and pay it.
3939505,djk50164,2015-06-05 15:49:00,370,"Doesn't matter how you claim they will automatically make you pay on the lesser amount. Just an FYI you can only bring 5 liters or cases per person. This doesn't affect me but I had to ask the agent what is the most you have seen people bring, she said there was a group of 4 guys bringing 30 cases of beer I said well what did you make them do she said made them pay the duty and sent them on there way. So I guess the rules bend a little depending on the officer. Usually even if it is busy you can pull over pay duty and be back on your way in less then 10 mins."
3940201,Bayou,2015-06-06 01:32:00,52,"Well I thought it was 1 case of beer per person, didn't know you could bring 5. I'm more then good, lol."
3940321,pjshorthorn,2015-06-06 05:44:00,5654,"I think the previous post was indicating that a person was allowed to take 5 cases of beer across the border,but you would have to pay duty on 4 of the cases. PjShorthorn"
