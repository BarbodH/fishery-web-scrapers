3945569,DeBo,2015-06-08 07:01:00,211,I am fishing out of Morson for a week in July and at the end of that week I am headed up to Minaki to meet up with my dad for our annual week. What's the best route to take over to 71 from Morson? I did some google map searching and it is hard to tell which roads are paved. I will drive further on pavement than take shortcuts on gravel. Thanks

Its blacktop from Rainy River to Bergland but I never took it past 621. Sorry I can't help more but if I had to guess, I would say its paved all the way to 71."
