They are increasing outflow so the water will come up a bit at Minaki but looking like a low water year unless more rains continue.According to https://icepatrol.wordpress.com/Ice out for LOTW was May 3. I would guess big sand was very close to that. They took pictures from the Winnipeg river in mid April but I didn't see any later than that and they never flew over big sand. Big Stretch was about as far north as they showed.I'm hoping the water is up a couple feet from where it is now by the time I get there in July. Unless there are some major rains it will be quite the departure from last years crazy high water and fast current."

3949881,iowaeyes,2015-06-09 10:49:00,13,Headed to Minaki on the 20th of June. Was just wondering if there were any fishing reports or water levels reports? This will be my first trip to the Winnipeg river. One other in our group has been once. Any advise on this body of water is greatly appreciated. Most of the 5 man group will be walleye fishing a majority of the time but we will be trying our hand at Muskie. 10 DAYS TO GO!!!!
