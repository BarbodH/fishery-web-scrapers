Always enjoy staying there with their nice cabins and great boats. Anyone have reports of the fishing up in that area so far this year? 3 weeks to go!!"
3938385,stumcfar,2015-06-05 08:57:00,451,"We stayed at Golden Eagle, right next door, over Memorial weekend. Obviously things will have changed by the time you get there as I am sure the fish will be in different locations, but the mouth of the river was fantastic when we were there. We tried Sawmill a little, but didn't do as good. We stuck to areas we know well, because the water was quite low and we didn't want to bend up too many motors or props."
3938553,Carnhzkr,2015-06-05 09:40:00,964,"I've never fished LS early enough that the mouth of Wenasaga produced, but it's really a beautiful area. How's the boat traffic up there at that time? I can only imagine it's bumper to bumper."
3938705,jkrawchu,2015-06-05 10:15:00,26,Never fished the mouth of Wenasage before. Is it just an early season spot or decent later as well?
3938777,Knoxabilly,2015-06-05 10:34:00,225,I stay at Evergreen also and posted a trip report after opener! Look it up!
3939121,wallydave,2015-06-05 12:36:00,2151,"The mouth of the river is an early season hot spot for sure! Back in the day, the Wenesaga was closed until June 1st, as a sanctuary. My boat/cabin buddy's birthday was the same day! We celebrated with fish after fish! AHHH.... the good old days, later in the season humps and wind blown points will hold fish. Check with your outfitter and here for reports! Happy fishing!"
3939145,stumcfar,2015-06-05 12:47:00,451,"We have had luck at the mouth at times well into June. I have never been up the river, but that opens June 14th, I believe and I have heard there can be some fantastic fishing in the river too. The boat traffic Memorial weekend wasn't terrible. I think there were 10 boats at the mouth one afternoon. We were never alone there, typically a half dozen boats. That doesn't bother me if I am catching fish and people aren't rude. If you are going to fish the mouth of the river, just make sure you have an anchor that can hold you in the current and wind. The biggest problem I see there is people with not enough anchor and they are constantly resetting and then moving into people and having to move again. If you are in a camp boat, I would request an extra anchor."
3941753,beckaj1973,2015-06-06 18:05:00,12,"Just got back from a week fishing Lac Seul out of the Ear Falls area. - water levels went up a foot or two during our stay and are at normal levels for this time of year. - water temps were in the upper 50's in the morning and rising to the mid 60's in the afternoon. - we fished 5 days in the Sawmill Bay area. Typical areas in the back of Sawmill weren't producing. Most of our fish came out out of the front half of Sawmill. Herb's Point was good early in the week, but faded as the week went on. Lots of fish in this area of Sawmill; however, average size was down considerably from previous years. - fished McKenzie Bay for two days and the fishing was good and the walleyes were much bigger. - Heard Lunker Point was solid, but didn't fish it. - averaged 115 fish a day for the trip with the largest just under 27 inches. - white was the best color for jigging tipped with a frozen shiner or minnow. Night crawlers were ineffective. - trolled crankbaits quite a bit in depths below 6 feet. Hot steel shallow diver was the best as was the Rebel Tiny Wee Craw. - weather was stable with highs near 70 and no rain except for one night. - both border crossings were smooth with no long waits. Did get the chicken, turkey, and egg question on the way into Canada (IFalls). - stayed at Gold Pines and they were awesome as usual. Good luck to all!!!!!"
