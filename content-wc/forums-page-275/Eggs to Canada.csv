3947641,team walleye,2015-06-08 19:13:00,336,Why take the chance in taking eggs up? It's not going to cost you that much more money to buy your eggs up north. Plus.. why risk infecting Canada?
3947777,SpoonieLuv,2015-06-08 19:55:00,16,My thoughts exactly...just buy them in Canada and save us all the hold up at the border. Have some respect for the country you are planning on vacationing in. smh
3942817,JAY221,2015-06-07 07:36:00,877,"I didn't know how far they went when they quarantine one of these chicken or turkey farms until I was up in northern Iowa the other day. They even close the public roads that can get you to the farms. Later, Jay"
3943329,billy weaver,2015-06-07 10:14:00,470,I asked about the egg ban being lifted because I have a friend who is going to Canada in another group. Our group will buy our eggs in Dryden (no problem). My friend tells me that there is no egg ban at this time and challenged me to show him a official notice of the ban. I think he is asking for problems. I would like to be there when he has to throw 5 dozen eggs in the trash hopper.

3943369,billy weaver,2015-06-07 10:34:00,470,I am going to copy this notice and pass it along to my friend. Thanks for this info.
3943769,drlee,2015-06-07 14:49:00,409,"Our outfitter has it posted on the camp website that we should NOT try to bring eggs into Canada. I am sure they are playing it safe, which makes sense to me. We buy our eggs in Ignace on the way to camp every year, anyway. Then they only have another 2 or 3 hours of road trip to get broken."
3945601,fish007,2015-06-08 07:13:00,120,I just got back from a trip to Smooth Rock lake last week and they did ask if we had any poultry products. As we are going again in August I'm wondering if egg beaters or other processed egg products are ok ?
3946209,smbrickner,2015-06-08 09:53:00,276,I hope my gallon jar of pickled eggs will be ok....
3946857,Freytown,2015-06-08 14:31:00,770,"""For assistance with determining whether the eggs that you wish to import is permitted into Canada we recommend contacting the CFIA Import Service Centre directly at: 1-800-835-4486 or 1-289-247-4099"".As long as the eggs are NOT PACKAGED in banned states, you are allowed to bring them into Canada. I spoke to the CFIA today and was told the carton must ID where the eggs were processed. PA is fine, so I'm bring them. FT Banned states:http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/.../1421341727507"
3947257,TIGHTLINER,2015-06-08 17:22:00,223,Just read on AOL that Michigan is now on the list with bird flu.
3947353,pjshorthorn,2015-06-08 17:55:00,5654,Just checked the CFIA website and Michigan is not listed.......yet. Could be a timing thing as the list hasn't been updated since 5-13-15. PjShorthorn
3941945,billy weaver,2015-06-06 19:51:00,470,Getting ready to leave for Canada this coming Friday. I have just been told the egg ban to Canada has been lifted. Is this true? I would like to take my eggs from home but don't want a problem at the border.
3942073,Guest,2015-06-06 20:32:00,0,"Leave your eggs at home and cross the border. After you leave the border checkpoint, drive over to Safeway and pick up as many as you need. May cost you several bucks but, it may keep you from getting an ulcer over it."
3942201,billy weaver,2015-06-06 20:52:00,470,"Yes your probably right, but its always something, first it was invasive species stickers then no eggs across the border. I guess the days are gone where you just loaded up and went. I like to play by the rules but d__m!"
3942233,pjshorthorn,2015-06-06 21:06:00,5654,Just curious where you got the information that the egg/poultry ban has been lifted by the CFIA ? There are a lot of folks who have trips planned for the remainder of the summer so any info on this being correct would be appreciated. PjShorthorn
3942321,ftfarms,2015-06-06 21:29:00,444,That would be hard to believe when thay just killed 1000s of more chickens last month in Iowa.
3942353,jigman 2003,2015-06-06 21:38:00,981,Thousands? Millions of dead poultry in MN...avian flu in poultry is no joke. Lots of folks have lost their jobs and the impacts ($$$) will be felt by all of us who consume eggs/chicken/turkey
3942489,onetimedave,2015-06-07 05:38:00,502,"Crossed at the ""SOO"". Did not get asked about eggs. We did not bring any but purchased them in Ontario."
3942529,TIGHTLINER,2015-06-07 06:09:00,223,Also crossed at soo never even ask about eggs or anything close to it. Talked with someone else that crossed in soo they said samething. If it were me i would leave them at home and buy in canada.
3942537,CI_Guy,2015-06-07 06:13:00,2118,We were asked about eggs & chicken last week crossing at I Falls. My wife asked the woman officer at the border a few questions and was told that if the state on the license plate is on the banned list has a lot to do with whether they ask about eggs & poultry.
3942785,pjshorthorn,2015-06-07 07:30:00,5654,"Now, that is quite interesting and sheds a little more light on the subjectivity of border crossings PjShorthorn"
