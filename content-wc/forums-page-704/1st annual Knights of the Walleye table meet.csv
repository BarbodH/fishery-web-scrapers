After having my secretary, (her name is gurdi, she is chocolate in nature and loves to bird hunt) coordinate with other walleye secretaries, I set up an evening at our place on Sunday to get together for some beers, campfire, some really good lying, i mean stories and what ever else the bears drag in the yard that day. If i get a pike in by then i will stuff an apple in his mouth and roast him in the pike pit. Was looking at Sunday June 18th. evening 7pm or later. I have parking for about 10 vehicles and we are just about 15 minutes outside of sioux lookout on 664 towards Hudson just around the corner from . For direcions email me. [email protected] counting down the days."
557443,Guest,2006-05-20 03:22:00,0,That sounds like a wonderful plan... I wish I could attend but I will be entertaining friends that weekend. But the concept of having walleye members getting together sounds interesting. I have a friend in our area that owns a camp up here... He'd probably be willing to hold some sort of Walleye fishermans event. Maybe have some sort of Tournament and Bar-B-Q ... He has approx. 5 acres and 7 units for cabins... I think that would be a great time... I'll mention to him and I'll post later. If anyone has other Ideals on this subject please post.... Mista Walleye
