We have stayed at Holly lake the first year and Carillon this year and last. Both cabins and accomodations were nice. Fishing in both lakes was excellent. Not alot of big fish, not that they weren't there, but we just didn't find them. Lots of numbers though. Don't think you will be disappointed with NWO. Good group of people."
