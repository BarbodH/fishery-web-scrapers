Especially if a trial hasn't been scheduled as of yet??"
557394,jigman 2003,2006-05-18 09:52:00,981,Computers man. Anything that is docketed for a trial can be had through the internet. I can find anything civil or criminal in the state of WI.

Just got off the phone with an immigration officer at the border we will be going to and he said that if he hasn't yet been convicted and is contesting it that he is NOT inadmissable and to come on up. Phew.... Now, next year may be a different story for him."
557405,jigman 2003,2006-05-18 14:43:00,981,Good to hear that you shouldn't have any problems this year. That sure goes against what the link that CH47 posted says. Hope the guy you talked to is the same one who is in the booth when you get there.

I agree. We've made 2 different phone calls and had the same answer. We're making one more to verify. I think they were impressed that we bothered to call. The U.S. Consulate told us that he didn't want to guarantee anything, but that if he hasn't been convicted it shouldn't be an issue. He then gave us the number of the officers to call to be sure. I sure hope this is what happens when we get there. If not, it's a long ride home alone."
557410,bigfish1965,2006-05-18 20:59:00,3210,You may want to check if you are allowed to leave the country with a pending trail on the horizon.
557319,Guest,2006-05-17 05:11:00,0,What happens if ou received a DWI last week and a court date has yet to be set. Can you still get into Canada? We are supposed to be leaving next Monday. Thanks

557340,Guest,2006-05-17 07:08:00,0,"I would say that right now your accused of but not convicted of it, I would say that your okay"
557342,Guest,2006-05-17 08:01:00,0,"If you were printed at the police station on one of the computerized fingerprint systems, you will instantly be in the system showing an arrest for DUI. If you are in the system, you might have problems. If you were fingerprinted the old way with ink, it might take a few weeks or even months to get into the system. If I were you, I would call the border crossing that you are going to be at and talk to a supervisor about this. You should be a little proactive."

557367,Guest,2006-05-17 14:59:00,0,I believe the law says you can be refused entry if you were charged with a crime. Thus even though you aren't convicted you could be refused entry if you have been arrested but not convicted. One of the questions on the Can-Pass is have you ever been arrested.
557379,jigman 2003,2006-05-18 06:48:00,981,"Yep, ""innocent until proven guilty"" may work in the States, but the rules are different when you go to a foreign country. We're VISITORS there, we have to follow THEIR rules. Just as we expect visitors to the States to follow ours."
557381,Guest,2006-05-18 07:28:00,0,"I have crossed the border several times in recent years, and a few time we had some pretty rought looking characters in the vehicle with us. Was never given and problems or asked any questions about criminal pasts etc. I know there is always alot of talk on here about it but, I have never witnessed it. Crossed a Niagra and St. Saint Marie."
557383,CH47,2006-05-18 07:48:00,29,"Sorry, Bones, but according to this Canadian website you are considered inadmissable.http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/f...ity.html#note3 Regards,"
