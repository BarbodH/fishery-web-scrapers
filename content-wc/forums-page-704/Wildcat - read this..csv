But, I'd like to hook up for a cold one and maybe a fillet or two. We'd like to possibly see your cabin for future trips, or at least get directions to it. Also need to get info. on 'what's hot, and what's not' in that neck of the woods. Hope to hear from you."
557457,Guest,2006-05-20 23:42:00,0,We are going to be heading way north into lac seul thursday and crashing on the boat until friday. will be back at the camp friday afternoon to close out the week on BigV. Friday evening looks good to get together. catch me on email or you can leave a message on my cell as i check it at least once a day. had a phone hooked up this year as well if you guys want to call before or after we head out. cant wait to get out there.

We'll be at Country Camping in the corner two campsites, so if you're in the area, stop on by, or get me directions to your place and we'll come down - we want to check out your place. We'd all like to get together to see whats hot/not on Lac Seul that time of year. There is another guy on this board too that will be at Country Camping the same week as us - maybe we can have a little 'board get together'. We plan on arriving at camp around 7:00 pm Friday. Interesting that you stay over on your boat. Do you just beach it for the night? That sounds like a great time actually."

557487,wooglin,2006-05-22 08:06:00,371,"Sounds great, we'll try to make it happen. We've got to set up our camp and such before th sun goes down, so we'll try to hook up. I'll keep an eye out for your e-mail. Later."
