557416,bugsy,2006-05-19 05:12:00,49,Yes...Hwy 29 complete from Green Bay to I-94.
557418,wiggle,2006-05-19 05:59:00,400,"Yes, the bypass is half done. When you head north out of Eau Claire on Hwy 53, take a right(east)turn onto the ""north crossing"". Then take the left(north) turn onto the new bypass. It is the easiest and quickest way to get back on open hwy, and don't have all the lights and traffic to contend with. If anybody wants exit numbers or hwy numbers, I can post them??? This fall the bypass should be done......sure will be nice!!!!!!!!! Brad"

557435,north_alabama,2006-05-19 18:55:00,172,"I'll be travelling up past Madison heading towards Duluth en route to Thunder Bay. Would love to know a way to bypass Eau Clair, even if only partially this year. I remember it seemed like there was a lot of construction going on around there last summer, and on the way back we may have accidentally taken a section of the bypass. Any help would be appreciated."

Just bring hwy 53 north thru Eau Claire, to right(east) at the ""North Crossing"". Then you will go about 2 miles to left(north) on the new bypass, then your off and running again. It is 65MPH as soon as you get onto the hwy 53 bypass. A year from now, you will go almost directly from I-94 to the Hwy 53 bypass. That will be nice for all of us. Brad"
