Northern Chowda In a heavy stock pot, cook ½ pound of bacon, medium dice, until crispy. Stir in:  1 cup chopped sweet yellow onions  ½ cup chopped celery  ¾ cup diced carrot Sauté until the veggies start to wilt. Season with salt and pepper. Add:  3 bay leaves(bring them with)  1 Tablespoon (or 1 tsp. dried) chopped fresh thyme  Stir in ½ cup flour and cook 2 minutes Add:  1 pound potatoes(buy em after you cross the border), diced  4 cups clam juice(bring it with) Simmer until the pots are tender. Add:  2 cups heavy cream (be still my aching arteries)  Northern cut in chunks  2 Tablespoons finely chopped parsley or dried 2 teaspoons  re check and season with additional salt and pepper if needed Simmer until heated thru and serve. DO NOT over cook. Northern doesn't take that long/Bone-ap-i-teet!!!"
557479,Guest,2006-05-21 21:48:00,0,My dad and I go up every year and found that we don't want to mess with cooking....but we like to eat good food. So we go with premade dinners from a company called Family Chef. Good food and EASY..no clean up either.http://www.familychef.com I think thats it. Good Luck
557486,jigman 2003,2006-05-22 07:18:00,981,"Family chef is great if you have a LOT of money. In line with the above poster about fish, fish, fish. I agree. We love to have walleye and eggs a couple times. Instead of deep frying it we dust them in flour, dip in egg, and roll them in crushed Ritz crackers. Then they get pan fried in butter. Unbelievable. 33 days to Ogoki Reservoir!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

557369,Guest,2006-05-17 15:39:00,0,"As someone said in a similar post, why would you want to eat anything but fish? Sure a hamburger or steak one night taste good, but nothing beats fresh walleye and pike. Learn to cook it different ways!"
557370,IaCraig,2006-05-17 17:00:00,434,"I have 2 non-fish evening meals I bring that have become traditions. #1 - Hobo Dinners - (basically 1/3 lb burgers, diced potatoes, onions & carrots all rolled up in foil and placed on the fire/grill/oven for about 45 minutes). #2 - Turkey Pot Pie - I assemble a home-made turkey pot pie at home in a 9"" aluminum pan, I only partially cook it then I freeze it. When we pack for the trip I put it in the cooler instead of ice to help keep the other food cold, then I put it in the fridge when we get to the cabin. By day 2 or 3 it will be completely thawed, just stick it in the oven for 30 - 45 mintues. (even my kids like it) (I also freeze the gravy for biscuits and gravy and put that in the cooler. Between the gravy and the turkey pot pie I don't really need ice) IaCraig"
557372,north_alabama,2006-05-17 19:28:00,172,"We tend to have a very light breakfast, fish all morning, have our big meal at noon, a quick power nap, fish 'til dark, then warm up some leftovers. We boat-in, so weight's not too much of a problem, and we tend to take a lot of canned stuff - chili, beef stew, chicken/dumplings, etc. First night in we have burgers and I cook a bunch of extra hamburger and set it aside for spaghetti a few days later. Our favorite is when we fix ""breakfast"" at lunch or supper - pancakes, bacon, eggs - a pain to cook but worth it for us. We also like to bring along a half dozens cans of pilsbury bread dough (""french loaf"" I think). It's not great bread by absolute standards, but a walleye sandwich with bread warm from the oven is pretty awesome. No harder to cook than a pizza. For really quick and easy we like things like Ramen noodles or Mac and Cheese (the deluxe kind that you just squeeze out the sauce after you boil the noodles). Last year we brought up a tube of cookie dough and consoled ourselves one rainy night. Crumbled bacon in the little plastic bags is an easy way to dress up a lot of things. Of course I should provide some context. My formative trips to Canada were in Quetico Provincial Forest where we'd have to exist for 12 days on freeze-dried everything. After about 6 days of that one becomes very unimpressed with NASA. Constipation never, ever, an issue. So with what we eat now we feel like we're eating like kings. Sounds like we eat a lot less fish than most, usually only 2-4 meals."
557373,Guest,2006-05-17 22:05:00,0,"here are some things we have tried over the years to feed 6 to 10. none of these take more than 10 mins prep time. let me know if you want the brew details for them i agree as well, we find that the monster dinner works better at 5pm rather than 1030 pm. 2 day mountain man oatmeal Pike in a pit Walley Florantine Deer chilli we also began make big, hearty sandwitches to eat on the lake with energy bars. made a big difference to out days. good fishing, good eatin"
557374,sidewinder,2006-05-17 23:19:00,96,"We started early dinner also 3-5 We cook up a big pot of something chili,spag,chicken and noodles,all with haevy seasoning esp garlic. then use as needed throughout week. leftovers get better every day. we also bring a smoked pork tenderloin for luches etc sidewinder"
557376,jerry bark,2006-05-18 05:59:00,822,"????? 1/2 CUP cayenne pepper??? might want to rethink that ingredient a bit,LOL. us beginners would opt for 1/2 teaspoon to 1 teaspoon. but them ""some like it hotter...."" jerry"
557442,Guest,2006-05-20 03:00:00,0,"O.K. Boyz, This is what I've been doing for those late night story tellings. We usually have one night where the evening is just beautiful and the fire pit is going well... I pull out my marinated steaks...I use those grills that hold the steaks and lock em tight. Keep turning for a spell and man oh man you can't beat it. I pour the hot sauce on them because if I didn't the boyz would finish them off in seconds... We've done moose, deer, caribou... mmmmm Also I enjoy the shrimp and Hot wings... Oooh butt the morning after kinda hurts a little...Hehehehe.. Try it you'll like it.... M.W."
557445,Guest,2006-05-20 10:00:00,0,"Fish. Fish. We eat fish. Morning, noon and night. Fish sandwiches, Fish and eggs, Fish and potatoes. Fish and steak. Fish and beer. Fish, fish, fish. It's great."
557273,Guest,2006-05-15 15:10:00,0,"Well, headed north in a couple weeks. We have always followed the traditional meal schedule with our big dinner (late) after the evenings fishing is done. Decided to mix it up this year and have a big mid-day meal, and than opt for a lighter dinner. Basically a flip-flop. Anyway, we are debating what to have as the late food, outside of say, soup/sandwiches. I am leaning towards a pizza night... we used to have a friend of my fathers years ago whose mother in law made the best pizza I've ever had...they are now both deceased so I can't ask them.....Anyone pre-make the dough and take it with you. Recipes? Or other options for the ""new"" dinner? Goal is fast/easy..... Thanks. John"
557279,Guest,2006-05-15 17:03:00,0,Camping or cabin w/ range and oven?
557281,Guest,2006-05-15 17:44:00,0,"We do pizza every year, it's pretty easy. I bring up premade crust you buy in the store, I think their called Degerno's (bad spelling), Also the small cans of pizza sauce, black olives, pepperoni and per cooked sausage. I also bring the tin foil pizza pans. It takes about 10 minutes to throw two pizza's together then cook them. Not bad, either. I like to keep meals as simple as possible, I don't want to waste a lot of time cooking while in Canada but I do like to eat good. Other quick easy meals are beef stew, chile, barbequed pork sandwiches and brats. Do as much preperation as you can at home and enjoy more time fishing or relaxing."
557282,phishfearme,2006-05-15 18:43:00,1242,"pizza with boboli shells have become a standard on our menu. the only other non-walleye meals are spagetti, shrimp on the barbie (first night) and marinated pork tenderloins that are very easy and great on the grill. - phish"
557284,biggeorge50,2006-05-15 18:51:00,128,"There is a bakery near me that makes only Italian bread. I go there and buy their dough - makes fantastic pizza. If there is a bakery near you, I would go that route."
557292,jigman 2003,2006-05-16 07:20:00,981,"Homemade pizza does sound good, but we have opted to take frozen pizzas the last couple of years. I got this ""tip"" from Mr. Walleye. Kind of nice to come back from fishing, fire up the oven and make a pizza. We have gone to having our ""big meal"" around 2:30 or 3 in the afternoon. We fish up to that time having some snacks in the boat or whatever, come back make the big meal and clean up. Sit around for awhile to let the food digest and then go back out and hit it until dark (or til our arms get tired from catching fish). Sometimes we'll make a snack or light meal when we get back in, but that's usually around 11 or so. We've found this method works great. Not all tired trying to cook and then clean up."
557294,Guest,2006-05-16 07:41:00,0,"jigman: That's exactly the change we are making this year. Just seemed like by the time all the guys get in, then its ""tonic"" time, which invariably leads to a second tonic, its like 10:30 and we haven't even started dinner yet. Plus the lodge we are at shuts off the generator at 11, so you end up trying to cook by lantern... I think its the way to go.... Also thanks for the tip on the bakery...never thought about it, but I play hockey with a guy that owns a pizza shop...I bet he could get me the dough! John"
557300,retire55,2006-05-16 10:24:00,1029,"We're up each morning at 4:30 AM for toast and coffee before the morning fish. Everyone is back at camp for a big breakfast at 10 AM. Only other meal of the day is a big dinner at 5:30 PM before the evening fish. As to your question, finger food/hors d'oeuvres might do the trick (e.g. jumbo shrimp and a dipping sauce or smoked oysters and caper berries or smoked salmon and capers or chicken fingers)."
557301,Frankm,2006-05-16 10:38:00,154,"We bring chili which is an easy dinner when we arrive. We bring soup too. Usually for lunch we do snacks (jerky, cheese and crackers, etc) and a quick bowl of soup. We like to do bigger dinners. We bring a small bucket of Portillos Italian beef. Very simple. We do also do burgers and fries. We make every thing a little easier by bringing paper plates and utnesils. Our last night we do steak night and use the real stuff."
