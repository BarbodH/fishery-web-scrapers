I get concerned about the weather reports every year, and hope no cold fronts will hit. The 2 buddies and myself in our boat will hit the smallmouth hard, and I am sure after plenty of ribbing from them, to fish some crappie. We are going to give Rough Rock Lake a going over. My wife will go, though she does not fish. She most likely will see the countryside, shop and relax around the lodge with the other non-fishing wife who is going. After this trip, it is off to the Upper French River with 2 brothers and another father/son combo in late June. Smallmouth again, though I can not find anywhere that the Upper French has crappie. It is wonderful to be able to fish down here in TN/KY and go to Canada every year. Hope everyone has a great season, Don C"
