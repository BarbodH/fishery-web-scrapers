557438,Hawker,2006-05-19 19:54:00,3967,"Thanks Bob! Do you know or hear if they were jigging/trolling by any chance?? Will be headed that way next Thursday morning, arrive sometime Friday afternoon/evening. If you would, drop me an email with a phone # so I can holler at you when we get there and situated! Would love to meet ya and chat over a cup of java for a bit if the opportunity would arise, maybe even wet a line for a bit. The owner of Scenic Tackle is going to meet me up there for a day of trout fishing on Crow if he can, we might have to drag you along too! Thanks! Steve King aka the ""Hawker"""
