557187,Like2Fish,2006-05-12 21:20:00,210,"Wingmann, Thanks for your suggestion on Duck Bay Lodge. Duck Bay looks to be a quality resort. Unfortunately it doesn't appear that their camp boats have bow mounted trolling motors. My friends and I are used to standing on the bow mounted trolling motor casting the shoreline a good portion of the day. Casting the shoreline is a bit more cumbersome with the trolling motor mounted on the transom. Camp boats with a bow mounted trolling motor are a must for us. Your right about Witch Bay. I don't think we could go wrong with booking a trip with them again. I've been there twice and enjoyed my time fishing out of their camp. We've also houseboated out of Kenora and Morson over the past ten years as well. There is just so much water to fish on the Woods that I think some of us are willing to look at other areas of the lake to fish. Thanks again Like2Fish"
557190,Slimeball,2006-05-12 23:07:00,56,Yes Duck Bay Lodge does have bow mounted Minnkota Maxxum's. click on RATES and it describes their boats. Jason
557195,Like2Fish,2006-05-13 08:58:00,210,"Jason, Thanks for pointing this out to me. I was looking under their facilies link. They don't mention the bow mounted trolling motor in their equipment description. Thanks again, Like2Fish"
557218,Guest,2006-05-14 09:53:00,0,look into Hook n Bullet. They are building a new operation on the river. I do understand they will have 2 new cabins and new boats and motors. Plus exp. guiding service if needed. http//:wwww.hooknbullet.ca
557239,Ia Walihntr,2006-05-15 06:49:00,320,Duck Bays's camp boats are 18 foot Lunds with livewells bow mount trolling motors and depthfinders. Marv
557475,Guest,2006-05-21 20:59:00,0,"Thanks to all that responed to my original post. I have requested brochures from most of the resorts and am looking forward to their arrival. I am still interested to know if anyone has been to Frolanders Island Resort in Monuement Bay. I believe the resort is near the Northwest Angle. I would be interested in any comments you may have if you have been to Frolanders in regards to lodging, camp boats, and of course the fishing. Thanks Like2Fish"
556924,Like2Fish,2006-05-05 21:03:00,210,"The group of friends that I fish with have houseboated on LOTW for a number of years and have always enjoyed our houseboat experience. However, we are looking for a change and I thought someone could help me out. We are looking for a resort that offers comfortable accomodations and good camp boats. One of our favorite methods of fishing is casting the shoreline. It is important that the resort we find has camp boats for rent with bow mounted trolling motors, a depth finder and livewell. Several members of our group have fished out of Witch Bay Camp and have nothing but good things to say about the camp owners, accomodations and boats. However, it might be nice to try another part of the lake. If we can't find anything else we are more than happy to go back to Witch Bay. Does anyone have any suggestions for resorts with the the type of camp boats we are looking to rent? Has anyone been to Frolanders in the Northwest Angle? Thanks in advance for you replies.

556926,Hawker,2006-05-05 22:53:00,3967,"Been going to Young's Wilderness Camp for the past 12 years and they have exactly what your looking for in accomodations and boats. They offer American and Housekeeping plans! Great place, great food, great folks, great fishing! Camp is on an island, five minute boat ride from the landing, five miles north of Nestor Falls on Stephens Bay. Here is the link to their website: http://www.youngswildernesscamp.com/ Hawker"
557068,Like2Fish,2006-05-09 22:01:00,210,"Hawker, thanks for your response. I will give them a good look over. How is the bass fishing in that part of the lake? Does anyone else have any suggestions based upon my original post? Like2Fish"

557075,Hawker,2006-05-10 05:27:00,3967,"Actually (shhhhhhhhhhh) the bass fishing in that area is one of the things that keep me coming back time and time again!! Loads of eyes, perch, pike, crappie & musky within just a few minutes boat ride from the lodge! Luv it there, wouldn't even consider trying any place else!!!!! Hawker"
557079,Bill Krejca,2006-05-10 07:17:00,6107,"Like2, Young's is a nice place, very friendly. Bass fishing can be terrific."
557087,rpieske,2006-05-10 08:59:00,1276,"If you like clean cabins, great boats and nice hosts, the place to go is Canadian Haven in Nestor Falls, On. on Sabaskong Bay of LOTW. Here is a link to their website:http://www.canadianhaven.com/index.shtml"
557090,Guest,2006-05-10 09:24:00,0,"We use Montlongs Rod and Reel right at the bridge in Sioux Narrows, contact Chan at, mailto:rodandreelresort.com clean cabins and good boats."
557107,MoWalleyeguy,2006-05-10 15:52:00,409,"Check out www.witchbay.com They use Lund 17 1/2 foot LUND outfitter boats (tiller) or Crestliner Fish Hawk console steer boats. Both are equiped with 50HP Four Stroke Yamaha motors. (the web sight might show honda or merc... but they are Yamaha now) Front AND rear Lowrance fishfinders (not many give you 2) and the trolling motor is a Minnkota 24V top of the line. I dont bother taking my own boat as theres works awesome! Food is simply fantastic, dock & cabin workers are 1st rate. Its not cheap, but for a remote secluded camp with great fishing, great boats, wonderful camp owners then take a look. We have been to others and they didnt compare. We have taken 5 trips to this place now."
557117,Guest,2006-05-10 21:51:00,0,"My first choice would be Witchbay but since you are looking for alternatives, I would recommend Duck bay Lodge www.duckbaylodge.com out of Morson. Excellent accomidations, service, boats and guides. Hope this helps. Wingmann"
