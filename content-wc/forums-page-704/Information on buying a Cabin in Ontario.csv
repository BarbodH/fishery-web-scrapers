557176,Guest,2006-05-12 16:11:00,0,"We picked up a place about 8 years ago on Big Vermillion lake just outside of Sioux Lookout. it has been a great thing for me and guys, me and the kids and the wife, well lets just say she likes the lake. very true though in the previous posts, it is not the same vacation anymore, i add a day to open and close the place and there is usually a few in the middle to keep things up. i do have passers by that use it for what i hope is emergencies. now with gas prices, my 15 hour drive to get there is taking out of my vacation fund. we have rented it to help with the expenses and i really enjoy sharing our good times with others. contact me directly for anything you need or find[email protected]"
557182,Sutsgold,2006-05-12 19:32:00,219,"We own, so I agree that there are times when unseen expenses occur. However, realty prices are rising. I looked at a 1 acre island on LOTW 13 years ago. It was 17thousand. An acre now goes for over 100k. Watch the prices on rainy. They are going fast. The world is getting smaller, and the willingness for people to travel farther for good fishing is increasing. This summer, my family and I will enjoy being at the lake for three weeks. To me to do this through an outfitter would cost close to 2800 dollars per week. Multiply that by 3 and you can see that the 8400 would be out of the question. Next summer my inlaws will spend two weeks with us, followed by my parents for two weeks. We are both teachers, so we are blessed to have the summers off and the time to make it all worth while. I have also set it up so that the house drains of water and all electricity can be turned off. Helps keep things down. Best of luck"
557389,Guest,2006-05-18 09:03:00,0,Has anyone ever rented a remote cabin from an individual? Is there a web site you have found that has for rent by owner listings.
557413,Guest,2006-05-18 22:45:00,0,"i host mine at www.cottagesincanda.com i have a couple links out there at other sites as well, but it seems that this site attracks the right kind and just the right amount of folks i can help out. we do it to cover costs and not as an outfitter. there are a couple outfitter sites out there as well. good luck."
557081,Guest,2006-05-10 07:25:00,0,A friend of mine has a cabin for sale on Red Lake at least it was for sale on Sunday . They are going fast.
557105,Guest,2006-05-10 15:00:00,0,"I know of a house for sale on Eagle Lake....3.5 acres, 250 ft. shoreline with potential to subdivide the house off and have about a 2 acre lakeshore vacant lot remaining. www.latitude50.on.ca"
557121,Sutsgold,2006-05-11 08:35:00,219,"We own a house on Eagle Lake. There are many sites i followed until we found one my wife would approve. The purchase was as easy as buying in the U.S., with a few exceptions. You will need to open a checking account in Canada. Easy to do, just make sure you do it when you are up there instead of finding a place and than having to do it. If you are going to get a mortgage, you will need to put down a substantial amount on the property. If it is a boat to only you may be required to put down 50 %. I have a good lawyer up there, who did everything for us. For redlake the following sites work/www.austinrealty.on.cawww.latitude50.on.ca For all over usewww.norealtyfee.com For the sioux lookout area usewww.siouxlookout.com for dryden usewww.screalty.on.ca There is a place for sale on red right now for 80 U.S. If you want more info email me at [email protected]"
557123,Guest,2006-05-11 11:10:00,0,CAN YOU EMAIL ME SOME INFO ON THE CABIN ON RED LAKE...?[email protected] THANKS SO MUCH.
557124,Guest,2006-05-11 11:12:00,0,HOW ABOUT OLD TRAPPERS CABINS OR CABINS ON GOOD WATER THAT NEED ASOME RENOVATION? WHERE CAN A GUY FIND OUT ABOUT THOSE TYPES OF PROPERTIES?
557129,Trailerguy,2006-05-11 14:40:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Most of the trapper's cabins exist because the trapper was a native, who can legally build on crown land. Occasionaly you see a cabin built on railroad land and leased from the railroad in remote locations that are cheap. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
557139,Guest,2006-05-12 01:13:00,0,"Hi. I checked into it for a couple of years too. what it comes down too is this. are you going to spend enough time up there to justify the maintenance and taxes,insurance and worring about who is living in your cabin while you think it is locked up for the season. and time spent working on the cabin instead of enjoying yourself fishing. It sounds great if you live up there through the season but otherwise it will be more work and worry than its worth. In my case it was better to rent and leave the problems to the owner. my 2 cents"
557152,Guest,2006-05-12 10:08:00,0,"That's right, Even when you live up here, maintaining a cabin and your own house is a bit of a pain. Your doing twice the work and not spending that quality time sipping on magaritas. Time is precious, your better off spending a little cash every year and trying different places. You'll truly enjoy it more and not have to worry about the little things. Now on that note if you need a place to stay let me know...lol The problem up in Red Lake is that we don't have too many cabins available. Most people don't rent out there cabins. But there are some out here... Mostly word of mouth... If you are thinking of buying up here, let me know. Mista W has big ears...Not my fault, I had a teacher that enjoyed dragging her students around by the ears... Mista W"
557155,millerltman,2006-05-12 10:21:00,12,"Thanks Mista W, I will definatly let you know. We are going to Sportsmans Lodge again this to fish with Brett and Judy Geary. I really like the Red Lake area. Wish I could find an older cottage/cabin on a small lake in that area that needs some work. Or even some land to buy. Let me know if you see know of any. Thanks again."
557157,Guest,2006-05-12 10:35:00,0,I know the Gearys well... e-mail for info :[email protected]
557036,millerltman,2006-05-09 11:38:00,12,"I was wondering if anyone out there owned their own cabin in Ontario. Looking for advice and any helpful info on how you acquired it, and the best areas to look around. Would like to be around the Red Lake area...Thanks in advance."
557045,Trailerguy,2006-05-09 15:06:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I own a cottage on Wabaskang, which is about 1/2 way between Red Lake and Vermillion Bay. Buying in Ontario is similiar to the states, you use a realtor, or a lawyer, get a title, you pay taxes, nothing that hard about it. The exchange rate is not as favorable as it was a few years ago, but values keep going up anyway. I'm in an unincorperated township, which means you can do about anything your neighbors will put up with. ;) Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
557050,grt1,2006-05-09 16:27:00,259,"it depends on what you want to pay for a cabin, some go for as little as 25,000 up to the cost of a new house at 270,000 and sometime you can deal directly with the current owners and save the real estate fees. there are some for sale in the area now."
557051,Guest,2006-05-09 16:58:00,0,I too am interested in this area and would appreciate any info or realtor info that anyone might have.
557061,Guest,2006-05-09 20:47:00,0,Try going to www.norealtyfee.com or pulling up the classified ads in the Red Lake or Dryden newspapers.
557067,Guest,2006-05-09 21:42:00,0,Well good luck on finding a cabin up in Red Lake. Your hard press to find a house up here... The place is booming. You might want to put an ad in the local paper. Wanting to buy a cabin. Your looking at around $100.000 if your lucky.. You might be better off to buy a lot and build yourself a cabin. And lots are doubling in price every second year...

557076,Skylane,2006-05-10 05:35:00,101,Milleritman: Like Trailerguy said it is not a big problem and taxes don't amount to much compared to here in the states. We are building a new home to move to permanently and will have our cottage (6 years old) for sale after completion. It is located 20 miles east of Dryden.

557080,Guest,2006-05-10 07:19:00,0,"Thanks to all for the info, how hard is it to lease land, or do you have to be a canadian citizen to get a lease? I really like the idea of buying/leasing the land and building our own place."
