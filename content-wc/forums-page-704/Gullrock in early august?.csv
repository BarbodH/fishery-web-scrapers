I should be sleeping because I'm going fishing in about 5 hours...But the weather Isn't looking good for this morn. I'll probably sleep in today and hit the afternoon run...It's tough when you live in the great white north.. Gullrock in Aug.. Best fishing if your looking for the big ones. Always use those medium to big minnows...I love that Walleye chop.. a little wind will bring you great results. If it's windy, hit the shore line where the waves are bouncing off. The waves are pushing the bate fish on the shore line and those big walleyes are feeding well. Bright colors... if your jigging..Hope that helps you... Mista W might be available for a little guiding this summer...If you need any more info ... [email protected] I love catching those big ones in September..... M. W."
