Also it may be changed so that we only need some sort of special ID card, yet to be designed, instead of a passport. Does anyone know if this is fact?"

If you want to extend the passport issue call or email your U.S. Senator to support the Leahy amendment to the immigration bill. If passed in the Senate than it will go to congress for a vote. And your support will also be needed there as well. IN WASHINGTON Canada has scored two important victories in its opposition to the looming passport crackdown at the U.S. border - a Senate delay in the States and a major North American meeting due to take place in Manitoba at the end of the month. The U.S. Senate has agreed to push back the implementation of tough new restrictions on the Canada-U.S. border by 17 months, backing a Vermont Democrat who called the new rules ""a train wreck on the horizon for the northern border.'' Although the move is an important step for those backing efforts on both sides of the border to delay or modify restrictions enshrined in U.S. law, yesterday's Senate move has a long way to go before it is passed by the full U.S. Congress. The decision to back Senator Patrick Leahy's amendment comes as a top-level, North American meeting on border issues is taking shape in Canada. The summit, slated for the end of this month in Gimli, Man., will include most of the country's premiers, U.S. governors, ambassadors for Canada, the U.S. and Mexico - and perhaps Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Canada's ambassador to the United States, Michael Wilson, confirmed yesterday that he'll probably be at the Gimli meeting, as did Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty. The U.S. ambassador to Canada, David Wilkins, hasn't announced his plans, but is expected to attend, too. ""I think I'll be there,"" said Wilson, who appeared in Ottawa yesterday to discuss the passport issue and other Canada-U.S. irritants at a Commons committee hearing. ""Any time you get premiers and governors together it's important."" It will take place on May 31, at the end of the Western premiers' gathering and will see most of Canada's top political leaders converging on Gimli. ""It's a big deal,"" said one provincial source yesterday, who expects that the formal announcement of the meeting will emerge next week from Manitoba. Premier Gary Doer, host of this year's premiers' meeting, has expanded the invitation list, his aides say, because recent controversies over softwood lumber and the passport issue have convinced him that premiers and governors have to be part of Canada-U.S. discussions, too. At last week's meeting of Atlantic premiers and New England governors, the political leaders all agreed that they have to redouble efforts to fight the crackdown or at least try to get the deadline extended because of the economic damage it will cause. In yesterday's voice vote in Washington, the Senate backed the amendment by Leahy, who said federal agencies on the American side of the border will not be ready to implement regulations requiring all those crossing the 49th parallel by land to carry a passport or similar secure identity card by Jan. 1, 2008. Leahy also said the Bush administration has not properly co-ordinated plans for the new rules with the Harper government. The amendment, which was co-sponsored by a senior Republican, Ted Stevens of Alaska, would push the date for implementation to June 1, 2009. It will become part of an immigration bill the Senate hopes to cobble together by the end of next week when it breaks for the U.S. Memorial Day holiday, but it could be a bartering chip when the Senate attempts to reconcile its immigration measures with much tougher measures adopted last year by the U.S. House of Representatives. ""We're cautiously optimistic but there is still a law on the books we must prepare for,"" said Bernard Etzinger, a Canadian Embassy spokesman.""This will head off the turmoil that this poorly developed plan would impose on our citizens and on our economy, especially in border states,"" Leahy said. Leahy said it is not realistic to have the measures repealed, but he said because Ottawa is nowhere near having proper documentation ready to meet U.S. demands, a delay would head off chaos at the border"
