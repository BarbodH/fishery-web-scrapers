Great Western also has Honey Wheat, Lager, Brewhouse and Gold, but Pilsner is my favorite. For a dark beer, try Rickards Red by Molsons. Great in the bottle, excellent when on tap. Dave D(SK)"

Our fridge is stocked with the following: Molson Canadian LaBatt's Blue Kokanee LaBatt's Crystal Honestly, it's all good after a day on the water hauling in eyes. Cheers."

556591,Guest,2006-04-26 09:47:00,0,"The Sleeman Cream Ale is good also. I always buy some xtra to take back home. If you can buy Alexander Keiths beer from Nova Scotia it is good also, as others have stated. Most any beer is good!"

556693,bigfish1965,2006-04-29 00:01:00,3210,'What kinda beer should I drink?' is like asking 'What kinda girl should I marry?' ...and I leave it up to you to guess why...lol
557189,Pat-IA,2006-05-12 22:19:00,3,For something different try some Wildcat. I think it's from Labatts if my memory serves me right. Some stout stuff!

557215,Guest,2006-05-14 09:32:00,0,I am a huge Keiths Fan..... I mean huge... but recently I have found a new love.... MacLays Pale Ale.... very simalier to Keiths and it is brewed by Sleemans!!!... Ohh and here is the best part!! it is only 27.00 for a case!! vs. 39 some odd for Keiths... and to me Maclays is by far better give er' a try. Gerritt.
557228,Guest,2006-05-14 19:46:00,0,"I'd say try Alexander Keiths, or Moose Drule!!!!!"
556445,Guest,2006-04-24 16:23:00,0,What type of Canadian beer should I try this year. Cost is not an option. Taste is. I like anything from a Belgian White to beer so thick you almost have to chew it.
556460,Thunderstick,2006-04-24 18:37:00,35,"A sure sign of the season...the obligatory beer question at WC. Here's one suggested to us by a local on our fall trip to Ontario: Alexander Keith India Pale Ale. It will accompany us this June. Another favorite has been the various Sleeman beers but the day-in, day-out workhorse beer on all trips is, of course, Blue/Bleu."
556463,Guest,2006-04-24 19:11:00,0,To get the real experience go for the French stuff. http://www.thebeerstore.ca/storesand...nddetails.asp?

556480,Frankm,2006-04-25 08:09:00,154,I 2nd Kokanee.
556490,Guest,2006-04-25 09:52:00,0,"I like the Kokanee as well. When I was at the beer store last year purchasing a couple of cases the local behind me in line said he would rather drink horse piss than Kokanee, go figure."
556494,waleht,2006-04-25 11:25:00,132,I'm curious ro know how he knows horse piss taste better?
556495,River_eye,2006-04-25 11:31:00,1486,"Alexander Keiths, and Kokanee, east and west coast beers respectively, which have turned into success stories and are available in most of Canada. If I was to make a reccomendation, I'd say Fort Gary Dark, but it may only be availble in Manitoba."
