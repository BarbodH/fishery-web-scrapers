(forgive me, I'm an Okie) If so, we take I-35 north to Exit 237 at Cloquet which puts you on SH 33. Stay on SH 33 (north) and it will run right into 53 which in turn will take you straight into International Falls where we cross the border into Ft. Frances. Hope thats what you were looking for."

557429,Guest,2006-05-19 13:07:00,0,"I would agree as well. But...to be safe, take a look at the Minnesota department of transportation website and see about any possible road construction. Depending on what they are doing, it may or may not pay off to take an alternate route too... Just something to keep in mind before you go. May save a headache Steve"
