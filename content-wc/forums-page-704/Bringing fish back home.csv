557481,retire55,2006-05-21 22:39:00,1029,"The various Quebec Zones can have different walleye possession limits. Whatever the walleye possession limit is in the Zone you fish in Quebec, you can legally bring that many walleye back home with you - even if you're returning home through Ontario. You will need to be able to prove where you were fishing (in case you're asked). Also remember to package your fish properly for transportation - Quebec and Ontario rules differ but Quebec rules will apply, if that's where you caught the fish. Here's a web reference to Quebec's Sport Fishing Regulations - see http://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/english/p...g-regulations/ Here's ""some"" of the text from Section D of Quebec's regulations for transporting your fish: ""Individuals who have in their possession, other than in their place of permanent residence, fish caught when sportfishing, must keep them in a condition to enable determination of the species (enough skin must be left in place to enable identification), length and number. Where a length limit applies, the fish must be transported so as to be able to measure their length. For the enforcement of the length limit on walleye fillets in Zones 11, 12, 13 and 16, the skin must adhere totally to the flesh over the entire length of the fillets (see Length limit section L)."""

To be safe, take the most stringent transport reg's from either Ontario, Quebec or the state you will be going to and follow those rules. In Ontario each fish must be packaged seperately. Make the CO's job easy and you'll be on your way quickly."
557484,jerry bark,2006-05-22 06:00:00,822,"i'm with bigfish, make the CO's job easy. any fish that we bring back we package one to a bag and label using a permanent marker with date, species, original length, angler name and location caught. i leave the entire skin on the filet but anly attached at the front by a half inch or so. anytime we have been checked its taken less than five minutes and has been a positive experience for us having met several nice CO's. I'd rather not have to meet a mad one.... have fun, i counting down: 20 days to take off! cheers jerry"
557501,retire55,2006-05-22 11:16:00,1029,"Jerry: Last year while fishing in Quebec, I watched other fishermen leave the entire skin on their walleye fillets but only attached at the front by a half inch or so. After I returned home, I emailed the Quebec fishing regulations folks for clarification of their transportation requirements (specifically wrt skin completely on). Copied below is their response: ""Concerning the enforcement of the length limit for walleye in Area 13, the skin must adhere completely to the flesh of the fish. There is no other possible interpretation. Wildlife officers apply it thus. Consequently, separating skin from flesh even if the skin is still attached to the flesh is illegal in these circumstances and someone in possession of such fillets will certainly be charged."" I'm posting this rule interpretation only to let guys know beforehand how Quebec authorities plan to enforce their rules."
