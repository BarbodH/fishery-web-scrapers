557375,Guest,2006-05-17 23:28:00,0,Help. Would someone give me a link to a website that tells me exactly what I should have to tow boat into Canada. My insurance agent is dragging her feet getting me my boat policy and I am leaving in two weeks. She says I don't need seperate insurance on boat and trailer to cross the boarder. I say I read on this site that I do. If I can prove it to her she will rush the policy people at State Farm to hurry up. Help
557377,Trailerguy,2006-05-18 06:38:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Your trailer and it's contents are covered on the auto policy as long as it's hooked to the car. The boat should have a seperate liability policy to operate on the water, plus theft or comp/collision would be your option. No paper work other than trailer license, trailer registration, and boat registration (stickers) as required by the state you live in are required to travel by Canada. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
557378,Guest,2006-05-18 06:39:00,0,You don't need to do anything other than inform your insurance company that you will be traveling in Canada. Just have your license and current registration for the boat and trailer.
557385,rpieske,2006-05-18 08:13:00,1276,Aaron is correct.
557386,Guest,2006-05-18 08:18:00,0,Your insurance agent should give you a card of a sort that is proof that you have the necessary insurance that Canada requires. I get one every year with an up-to-date effective and expiration date. That is all that Canada requires.
557387,Cold Front Illinois,2006-05-18 08:36:00,449,Make sure your boat policy includes Canadian waters. Not all boat policies include Canada automatically. That goes for the Great Lakes also. Some polcicies exclude the Great Lakes unless requested. Better safe than sorry.
557388,dave10,2006-05-18 08:54:00,342,geezer - your agent should get you the Canadian yellow insurance cards that verify that your vehicle and boat are insured while in Canada. They must be reissued yearly. Don't forget to switch out your safety chain S hooks for hooks that snap shut. Good luck and have fun! Dave
557392,Guest,2006-05-18 09:32:00,0,"Dave10, I have never heard that you need safety chain hooks that snap shut, are you sure that is a law?"
557398,Cooker,2006-05-18 11:33:00,164,"Here is a link to the Ontario Ministry of Transportation. It states ""It is recommended that chain hooks have latches or devices that prevent accidental disconnect."" Recommended not required.http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/saf...es/trailer.htm"
557409,dave10,2006-05-18 17:19:00,342,"cooker - you're absolutely right. I looked at that same webpage two years ago before I towed the first time, and somehow came away with the idea that it was required. My bad :( :( :( Thanks for clarifying. Dave"
