518181,lobo1,2002-03-15 21:34:00,734,"I have an older version of this unit and it does what I need it to do. I bought it for our Canada trips but also use it on the in-laws pontoon.Mine doesn't work very well when running over 15 mph but I didn't really buy it for that anyhow. Shows bottom structure and fish OK but you certainly wouldn't confuse it with some of the high end fixed models. This newer unit looks to have several improvements over mine and probably is much better; that being said, I would buy another at that price with no second thoughts.lobo"
518182,tracker,2002-03-16 11:45:00,91,The Fish Easy 2 is my choice after investigating at a few at that price. The only trouble is that no one has them in Thunder Bay that I'm aware of. They all have the old version of Fish Easy.

518184,tracker,2002-03-17 08:48:00,91,I was surfing around yesterday and found a site www.lebaron.ca which just got some in. Will be ordering one shortly. I also visited the eaglesonar site. It gives you a comparison of the models. http://www.eaglesonar.com/products/sonarspecs.htm
