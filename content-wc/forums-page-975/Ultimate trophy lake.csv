517006,Guest,2002-02-19 21:00:00,0,Regardless of the talk about the Bay of Quinte if you are interested in a walleye only trophy hunt I can assure you that Nov 15 to Dec 15 is without a doubt your best shot at a trophy( or several) in Canada. Interested in [email protected].

517008,4bigfish,2002-03-09 10:09:00,25,"Saskatchewans north is the place to go.visit www.4bigfish.combest pike, lake trout, walleye, and grayling in the world!Mark[email protected]"
517009,Guest,2002-03-09 12:07:00,0,"Selwyn Lake Lodge on the border of Sask. and NWT would get my vote. Huge Lakers, Huge pike, and awesome grayling.selwynlakelodge.com.If you just want a huge laker, try great bear lake in nwt.Pikeman"
517010,bullfroglabat,2002-03-14 18:52:00,226,"For Really big pike and plenty of 22-25 inch walleyes it would be hard to beat Chippewayn lake in northern Manitoba. This is an out camp of Big Sand Lake lodge. The camp will hold 8 with a minimum of 6. They have a great set-up-a camp manager and a cook, but you fish on your own if you want. The camp mgr. gives you tips and will meet you on the lake to do SHORE LUNCH for you!!! I've been going to Canada for 20 years and I've fished Molson, athabasca, North Knife, Max Lake, Reindeer, and too many others to mention. This outpost just opened 2 years ago and you fish a river system (seal river) that has access to 4 lakes. You could fish there for a year and not cover all the good water. For more info [email protected]"
517011,Guest,2002-03-14 19:17:00,0,"http://www.nueltin.com/Nueltin has more trophy lakers and pike than probably any place in Mb. A 30"" laker or a 36"" pike is a yawn. It is also an outstanding lodge."
516996,RDbiteN,2002-02-06 21:24:00,4,"Where would you go for the ultimate fishing vacation in Canada. I am looking for the best lake(s) where numbers and size of fish can be expected. It would be nice to fish for Northern, Walleye, and Lake Trout but not manditory to have all three. I assume this would be a fly in trip but I am more concerned with fishing quality than lodging. I go to Canada every year so I am not a novice and I don't care if it would be strickly catch and release. Let me know your recommendations and if you have personally fished there and when. Thanks in advance."
516997,hksbh,2002-02-06 22:05:00,3,Looks like you found one on the reed lake post last year we did real well on northerns it was pretty slow when we where there for three years in a row. The ice has been going out so early with this goofy weather and I think that was the reason for the slow northern fishing the first week in june.
516998,Guest,2002-02-07 02:39:00,0,"http://www.nonta.net/mocinc/flash4.htmlIt would appear their website is under repair but there is a number to call to get some brochures. Talk with Jack Rezny - he'll put you in any number of camps that will put 100+ fish a day in your boat and get you a trophy or two to boot. Prices are reasonable and they fly either from Thunder Bay or Red Lake, depending on which of the camps you choose.I have been to three differant camps all in late May or early June - the fishing is unbelievable. Most of the lakes have been opened up to fishing in the last couple years and there is a new one every year.Our walleye casting record was 18 fish on 18 consecutive casts, if that tells you anything.lobo"

517000,Guest,2002-02-12 20:18:00,0,I have a freind who owns a camp on a trophy speckle trout lake its 5 miles in by snow machine. We just got back from a week up their and got some dandy specs. Also excellent spring specs his son got an 8 pounder last year. He would probably be willing to rent out to the right anglers for a week or so.If interested email me at [email protected]
517001,Guest,2002-02-13 14:08:00,0,"The lake most likely to produce the next record lake trout in Ont. Check out www.happylandingfishing.com they have boats on secluded lakes with the only entry, 13 lakes in all."
517002,JN,2002-02-13 21:45:00,47,"I would recomend Wolverine Lake Lodge. They ddon't get a whole lot of trophy walley but you get hundreds of 3 to 5 lbs. They do how ever get alot of trophy pike (just look in the master anglers report for Vandekkerckhove lake). It's an easy lake to fish. The lodge is comfortable, good food and great people. Wolverine Lodge . net will tell you more."
517003,Guest,2002-02-13 22:56:00,0,"Take a look at Molson Lake Lodge, or Knee Lake Resort. World Class!"
