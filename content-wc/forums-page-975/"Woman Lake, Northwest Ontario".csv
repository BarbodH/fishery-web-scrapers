517463,Guest,2002-02-25 14:21:00,0,One more try!
517464,Guest,2002-03-15 16:53:00,0,Been to Woman and you are in for a treat. Caught all the fish a man could want to and had some Trophies to release. The service is average to good...seen better but it works.
517465,Guest,2002-03-15 18:26:00,0,"Stayed on Confederation Lake, right next to Woman. I snuck onto Woman a few times in my years up there. The Pike fishing is great (size and numbers) but take the motion sickness pills before you hit the gravel road (30 miles of pure #####!)"
