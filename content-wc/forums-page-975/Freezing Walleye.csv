517536,Guest,2002-02-27 13:36:00,0,We have a few meals in the freezer for eating between hard and soft water and vise versa. We freeze in ice and it is important to cut out the lateral line area of the fish. We have found that cooking frozen fish with the line area left in produces sometimes but not all the time an offensive taste. With the line cut out we have never had a problem. However our fish are never held longer than 6 to 8 weeks.

We all get a kick out of looking at the fishing pictures and having an at home fish fry.Sorry if you feel that is wrong.If you think that frozen walleye taste bad, maybe you should read some of the posts on preparing it.PS-Do you think the folks from Iowa are wondering why they eat frozen corn up north?? <{{}}><"
517537,Guest,2002-02-27 18:21:00,0,"Walleye fishing in Ont. is the best it's been in years, due in large part to the slot limit. I challange anyone to prove to me that taking home 4 eater's is hurting anything.As far as tasting like crap at home, they always taste good at my house.Maybe you would rather eat granola and rice cakes, but let us make the decision on what we eat!"
517538,Guest,2002-02-27 20:54:00,0,What I have found over the years that works for me is cleaning and washing the fillets thoroughly. Then split the tail and pull out the centerline. I package one fillet per freezer bag for the trip home. After I get home I seal each fish with a Food Saver vacumn packer. I try not to bring any more home from all my trips combined than I will use in 6 months although when vacumn packed they will keep for a year or more without freezer burn. When I thaw them for cooking I double check for bones and place them in salt water in a bowl while I'm getting everything ready. I do not think there is anything wrong with bringing a few of the smaller fish home. Its all part of game management and part of why I buy a license.
517535,BD,2002-03-01 16:09:00,739,"Gee! My grandkids love the fish fry and stories also. When they are old enough I hope they are excited about going fishing with grandpa. I guess if I would follow some of the advice I have read they may follow Walt Disney and PETA instead.""What an idiot is man to believe that abstaining from (meat) and eating fish, which is so much more delicate and delicious, constitutes fasting."" --- Napoleon Bonaparte"
517539,Guest,2002-03-03 23:02:00,0,"Greentree....should maybe be ""tree-hugger"". I am all for c+r but up here in Alberta almost all lakes are zero limit for walleye. I had some walleye fillets from a previous trip to Saskatchewan in my freezer in a tupperware container for a year and a half!!!! Yes a year and a half. I simply thawed them, drained the water, and soaked them in milk for 24 hours. They tasted as if I had just caught them. Maybe you should spend less time eating your granola bars and wheatgrass, and more time learing how to cook. And yes if you didn't figure out, milk is the best way to remove a fishy or freezer burned smell/taste."
517541,eyewitness,2002-03-04 08:32:00,680,"Here's a little tip for ya. If you don't have a vacuum packer (most of us don't) then take your cleaned fillets and fill a freezer bag (not just a regular ziplock) with about a half a bag full. Lay bag on it's side and squeeze as much air out of fillets as possible. Flatten remainder of bag on counter and zip seal the bag all the way except for the last 1/2"". Carefully drain any remaining liquids from bag. Fill a bucket or large pot with cold water. It must be big enough to submerse entire bag unfolded with fish in it. Take bag and slowly submerse gently sqeezing fillets as it goes down. Being careful not to put open corner of freezer bag under water. The under water pressure will force almost all of the air from the bag. Slowly sink it till you get to that last little open corner and zip it shut right at the water line. It is as close to vacuum sealing as you can get. Remember that it is air in the bag that freezer burns the fish. Remove the air and no more problem. Freezing in a solid block of water will accomplish the same thing, the only problem is that the fillets are subjected to soaking in the water while thawing and can turn mushy real quick. Once you learn this method I think you'll be suprised at how simple and easy it is."
517540,Guest,2002-03-05 19:33:00,0,"Seems your quick to call names. You should consider what to name the folks who over fished Alberta to a 0 fish limit. I'm far from a tree-hugger; but I do support selective harvest. No problem eating all the fish you want while here at camp or taking a few home for the family to enjoy while they're fresh and at their best. But I do have a problem when we must find a way to doctor them back to near normal because they have been in the freezer for God knows how long; maybe to be found spoiled and them tossed out. As a mater of fact I have fought long and hard as a member of the regs committee here in Ontario to keep the option open for transport of fish. The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters(local sportsman groups) has long lobbied for a NO transport of game fish by non-residents law. They base there argument on the fact that fish are frozen for the potential of spoilage and waste. The attitudes shared here are also a big part of their argument. Remember that you are here in Canada for the fishing not the fish. Refer to an above posting and survey that 2 of 3 would rather visit a camp with rules that support a long term quality fishery. Look at the math; if 500,000 fishermen leave behind 4 fish each (50-50 males and females probably), that puts the potential of another million or so future spawners back in the system making for even better fishing and shorelunchs next time. Maybe Alberta fishermen should have thought of this before they lost their fishing. Remember Selective Harvest - Eat a few small ones and bad hooked fish and let the rest GO."
517542,Red Ruffandsore,2002-03-15 19:06:00,81,"Two things I do every year. One is take the family strawberry picking. We pick tons of strawberries, take them home and clean them, freeze a whole mess of them. We enjoy them the most in the heart of winter. Second thing I do is freeze some walleye and enjoy them the same way in the heart of winter. If that's wrong then I'm doing wrong and I ain't gonna stop doing it. If the lake is in trouble...shut it down all year long and everyone can move to the next lake. Hey, isn't that what farmers do with crops (rotate). Yeah yeah yeah...financial impact of buisness, land owners, and all. I pay taxes. I buy a license. I fund organizations.....and I fish. Stay off the pipe...and don't forget to wipe.Red Ruffandsore"
517523,Guest,2002-02-24 11:13:00,0,A few years ago a guy told me they dip the fillets in lemon juice then salt water or vis-versa prior to freezing and when they are unthawed they are very fresh tasting and not at all fishy. Has anyone had any experience with this or similar method? The walleye we bring home are sometimes a little fishy tasting after cooking and we are contributing that to the small portion of skin that has been left on for identification. We know the fish are in excellent shape prior to freezing as we do not let them die on the stringer. My parents are not able to make the trip to Canada and I like to bring some home to them. Thanks

517525,Reels,2002-02-24 14:34:00,2876,"Freezing in water is the best, but the MNR warned us last year when they check our cabin that we would have to thaw them if we got stopped by a road check. We didnt have too much water in the bag, and he said if he couldnt see the size of the fillets, he too would ticket us. Anyone else hear of this?<{{}}><"
517527,Guest,2002-02-24 15:28:00,0,"I agree with the previous posts that indicate freezing fillets in a Ziploc bag with water. Yes the MNR especially at the 1000 Islands crossing is finicky how fish are packed. If there is any question as to how many fillets or the length of the fillets, they keep them and give you a ticket for illegal transportation of fish. Every year I go to my favorite Lodge in Quebec, I hear the bad experiences of other visitors. Keep fillets flat-Don't ball up, and make sure DNR can easily without question identify species, measure the length, and count the fillets. This year our group intend to try the Foodsaver vacuum packer. I believe there is much info. in the archives. Hope this helps. :) :)"
517526,BD,2002-02-24 19:04:00,739,Use the FREEZER bags. The regular Ziplocks aren't as heavy and don't seem to keep the fish as well. A small amount of water in the bag is OK. You can't prevent the officers from identifing or measuring the fish though. The big thing is to get as much air as possible out of the bag. If you soak the fish in a baking soda / water mix for a few hours before frying even older filets will taste good.
517528,docIN,2002-02-26 03:47:00,120,One word... Foodsaver.Slightly freeze the fish and then use the foodsaver. This will keep the fish flat and for a much longer time. Takes up a lot less room in the freezer than those bags of water.Good luck.

517530,Guest,2002-02-27 05:01:00,0,I purchased a Foodsaver Vac 300 at Walmart for $99.00
517531,Guest,2002-02-27 11:54:00,0,Best way to keep walleye tasting fresh is to leave them in the lake for your next shorelunch. Darned fool who will take them home and leave in freezer to taste like crap. Ya - I know the law allows you to take fish home; take them fresh on ice for your mom or wife otherwise there is NO LEGITIMATE reason to spoil good fish just to be macho.
