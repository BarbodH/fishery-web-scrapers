It lacks the power of a real unit (perhaps because it runs only on 3 C batteries), so you don't mark too many fish. Also, the cone angle is only 9 degrees so it's not very useful in shallow water. The sidefinder is very useful, however, when you go by a reed bed or a dock, for example, and your wondering if there's anything there. I like the sidefinder a lot. One other thing, consider how you will mount it on the canoe. If you are using a lightweight canoe with a flimsy hull, you can't just clamp it on and go. If nothing else, the incessent wobble of the unit will drive you nuts. Perhaps someone out there has figured out a foolproof mounting scheme for such canoes."
