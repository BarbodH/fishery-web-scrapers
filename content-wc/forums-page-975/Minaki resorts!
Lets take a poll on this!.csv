517932,IaCraig,2002-03-06 12:25:00,434,Is this a poll to say where you have stayed?? OR are we ranking them in regard to luxury or cheapest or best value or the biggest or what?? Are we voting to recommend others to go to them or stay away from them?? Maybe we are voting on the 1 we want to succeed or close??
517933,Reels,2002-03-06 16:57:00,2876,"Knowing Bill, Im sure he meant were you prefere to stay or spend your money.<{{}}><"
517934,iamwalleye1,2002-03-06 17:09:00,1589,I guess it would be where would you like to stay and spend your money! For your money and the places list you can list good things!
517935,Guest,2002-03-06 19:42:00,0,Has anyone ever stayed at NorthStar Village?This is a small group of cabins managed by the the gas station owner on the river near the railroad bridge. We toured these cabins last summer and the accomodations seemed very nice. The prices also seemed reasonable.Any feedback from someone who has stayed there or has knowledge of the resort would be appreciated.
517936,DonC,2002-03-07 16:41:00,93,"I stayed there 4 years ago, and now stay at Birch Island Resort. The place is OK. It wasn't finished off, or as nice as Birch Island and the amenities and scenery also are not as good. The boats are fine (or OK). The food was average and acceptable. It certainly is more affordable than Birch Island.Don"
517937,Guest,2002-03-07 18:16:00,0,"I dont see Sunset Point on your list.I've stayed there several times & the accomadations are exceptional.Ken,the owner, is a great guy & can put you on to the fish.His private landing is the best in Minaki.The resort is located on the east side of the river just North of the bridge."
517938,Reels,2002-03-07 18:27:00,2876,"Yep, you forgot that one... I did too.<{{}}><"
517939,Guest,2002-03-09 01:29:00,0,Don't see Fergies on the poll.
517940,iamwalleye1,2002-03-09 06:06:00,1589,when I made the poll it lets you put in 6 items if you have a place just list it! Sorry!
