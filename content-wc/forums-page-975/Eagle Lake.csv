516913,ohdaddy,2002-02-19 21:01:00,21,GO NORTH.....Check out Sioux lookout Area best fishing I've ever had. i fished Eagle for 21 years way too much pressure. Hwy 17 doesnt affect the fishing. It's the fact that there are over 25 Camps on the lake.
516914,Guest,2002-02-28 12:29:00,0,"I have fished Eagle a few times and, as others have stated, it is a great trophy Muskie Lake that requires a lot of fishing per fish. About ten miles north is the Cobble Lake Chain of lakes that has great walleye, bass and, because there is no northern in the lake, Super Muskie fishing. The walleye fishing is best at night. The chain of lakes is about six lakes long with each lake getting deeper as you go south. The last two lakes have nice lake trout. Goodf luck and good fishing. Gunny"
516915,Guest,2002-03-12 11:52:00,0,"What you want is NOT Eagle Lake. Too many resorts on the lake, too big water. Go north from there to Cedar Lake or around Sioux Lookout area. Then plan on hiring a guide. Best solution for a great time and money well spent. Get to know and area."
516916,Guest,2002-03-15 18:43:00,0,I would have to agree. I fish Cedar and its not uncommon to have lodges from Eagle trailer thier boats and fish Cedar Lake. I hope their guests figure out that Cedar is better fishing and the lodges are less expensive.
516903,Guest,2002-02-03 12:00:00,0,"Does anybody have any experiences with Eagle Lake, Ontario? My group is considering our fourth Ontario Trip, probably in July or August. I just attended the All Canada show in Minneapolis and I'm swimming in pamplets. I picked up several from Eagle Lake Lodges. I'm a little concerned that the lake is so close to Hwy. 17 and what must be a lot of fishing pressure. Any experiences or suggestions would be appreciated. We're looking at drive-to, housekeeping lodges. Good fishing is the biggest concern. Thanks"
516904,Fred_G,2002-02-03 15:59:00,908,"I have not been to Eagle Lake. However, I can recommend Lake St. Joseph further up the road. There are two camps on the lake. The one we go to is The Old Post. The other is Camp Lake St. Joseph. The camps are the last drive to's in NW Ontario. We have been going to the Old Post for 5 years and the fishing gets better every year, both in terms of size and numbers.The web sites for each are:http://www.lakestjoseph.com/http://www.oldpost.com/Good Luck!Fred"

516908,Guest,2002-02-05 06:02:00,0,"I've been there a couple of times and really did not like it. It does have some great muskies but they tend to just look and not hit. Also for a true Canadian getaway I don't feel like this is the place. It is very crowded . It really depends on what exaxtly you want, but be sure you have plenty of references before you go. I have found Holinshead Outfitters 2 hours north of Thunder Bay to be the ultimate fishing vacation. Good luck."
516906,Guest,2002-02-05 15:43:00,0,Thanks for the information. I think that we'll look elsewhere. We're considering a camp on the Winnepeg River. Looks like an unlimited supply of water to explore.
516909,DarrenB,2002-02-07 09:25:00,28,"I usually head up there every other year, and I love it. It's big water in where you have to be prepared for anything weatherwise, and crossing the mainlake to get to some of the lower and more fertile bays can be a real chore on windy or stormy days. If you go in July or August however, most likely the weather will be a lot more stable than in the spring. As the above poster mentioned, the hotspots on the lake does tend to get a bit crowded for a real wilderness experience, but there are still areas on the lake that a guide can show you where you can catch fish and not see another boat all day. Plus the lake is so large and wide open that it's never really ""crowded"" to the point where it's uncomfortable and you can't find a good fishing spot. Every lodge I have been to on the lake has been very accomadating."
516907,Illini Bob,2002-02-07 10:27:00,16,"Good Choice!Our first 2 years we went to Eagle Lake, the last 8 have been on theWinnepeg River. There is no comparison.Good Luck."
516910,Guest,2002-02-10 10:14:00,0,"Spent two great years at North Shore Lodge. Great accomodations and service. Caught a ton of eyes on little joe spinners. The lake is rough at times because of its size. Walleys rock 1 and 2, and Frogs head is where we killed the eyes. Have a great time."
516911,Buddy13,2002-02-10 11:05:00,17,"For a complete listing of lodges on Eagle try http://www.justfishontario.com --------go to Outfitters then Eagle.Eagle lake can offer up some big fish and it's really not as big as some of the lakes like the Woods, Lac Seul, or St Joseph.Good luck."
