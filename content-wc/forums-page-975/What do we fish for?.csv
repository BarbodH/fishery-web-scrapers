518126,Guest,2002-03-14 07:48:00,0,Hey Jackfish...........Golfing is a real enjoyable past time.
518123,Guest,2002-03-14 08:44:00,0,I've fished muskie many times.....my experience is they fight more like a walleye that a northern....drag-in a big log
518124,eyedoktr,2002-03-14 08:46:00,2426,"I have tried it a couple of times but it seems that unless it's early spring, everyone trolls for muskie. I don't like trolling for ANYTHING (anything that swims that is). We have a couple of lakes near me that have the tiger muskies in them but I just haven't made the time to hit them. Is this an invitation ???:)"

518131,Guest,2002-03-14 12:06:00,0,Right on Starfish...there are two kinds of fish walleye and rough fish!

518135,Guest,2002-03-14 12:57:00,0,I have been fishing the deep clear blue waters of Canada for over 40 years. During that time I have been fortunate enough to catch trophy fish of many species. Nothing beats the thrill of hooking up on a trophy when you have the right equipment. I really believe that the most elusive trophy fish is the 12# plus Walleye. You catch one of those big ladys on a 6 ft med-lgt rod with 4lb test line and you better be ready to do some boat dancing. The key word to me is dancing.I have seen a lot of big Pike and Muskie brought in with oversized rods and line heavy enough to tow my SUV. Those fisherman dont dance they just dig in with their feet and start towing. To me thats not fishing....learn to land those trophys with finness not brute strength....tackle down and they all make you dance.
518115,Guest,2002-03-13 16:10:00,0,I have caught thousands of Walleye over the years and never get bored or tired of it. We may go back to camp to relax or have a drink or two but the experience of being there is what you are out there for. I especially like fishing in the Atikokan area with its large Red and White Pine stands close to some of the lakes. There is no experience like it. I can fish on days when they are slow for hours looking for them and still have a great fish even if I'm fishless. It happens even in good waters but you are still richer for the experience of just being there.
518116,IaCraig,2002-03-13 16:18:00,434,"I fish because I love being outdoors and I love boating. I started fishing walleyes because I heard & relatives talk about how much fun it is to go to Canada on walleye fishing trips. I read walleye central so I can see fisherman fight like children and call each other names. ;-) Relax people, open water is coming soon to a lake near you!IaCraig"
518117,Red Ruffandsore,2002-03-13 17:49:00,81,Hey! There are some of us who fish for a meal and when that's done we fish for a trophy. I have not seen a pike over 3 pounds put up much of a fight in near 40 years of fishing. Now muskies......
518118,Red Ruffandsore,2002-03-13 18:00:00,81,"I have to add that all you that turn your nose up at eating pike are pretty foolish. The time you save catching it you spend cleaning it, true, but I defy many (not all) to tell the difference after it's cooked and on a plate. If you use Fish Crisp, no one can tell."
518119,Guest,2002-03-13 20:35:00,0,"Gotta argue that one....when we had the lodge, I had more guests than I could count tell me the way they cook pike, I'd never tell the difference. I had to burst their bubble every time. It's a no-brainer, pike and eyes taste different.The first arguement started by stating that walleye aren't much fun because after 15 minutes it gets boring, I can honestly say the same for pike. I can catch near as many pike in a day as I can walleye. Maybe we're just blessed up here....(: Truth is I fish walleye because it takes skill, and you're always trying to learn something different. In our neck of the woods, you can catch a pike with an empty beer can tied to a treble.....lolThe way I see it, we all fish.....we're all O.K.....(:"
518120,Guest,2002-03-13 21:02:00,0,Friends don't let friends eat Pike:(
518121,eyedoktr,2002-03-14 05:30:00,2426,"I've spent more than 30 years trying to figure out walleye fishing. I do very well but I know I can do better, therefore, the study (on the water) time is extensive and enjoyable. To figure out bass, pike and other types of fishing, you need an afternoon. I have NEVER gotten tired of walleye fishing but after the 10th bass/pike in 10 casts, it no longer is a challenge. I have numerous 'eyes over 10# but am still looking for the first one over 15#."
518125,Guest,2002-03-14 06:44:00,0,"As near as I can figure; all I've learned from original post is ""us walleye fisherman fish for challenge and accomplishment "" I do that to and its called work......grab a hammer and nails and go to it. But when fishing I'm not out the pursuing the 2nd biggest fish in the lake that gives me half the fight.......you gotta fish for the strike, the pull and the fight....beat the water for the top dog on the food chain. When deer hunting do go after trophy bucks or the biggest fawn out there???"
518127,Piscatorian,2002-03-14 06:56:00,12,"Shallow water trophy lakers! There's nothing like it. Better yet when you get one casting, rather than trolling. The feeling is like setting a hook on a freight train. My biggest so far was slightly foul hooked on the side of the head. It ripped off about 150 yards of 20 lb mono in two long runs before I could turn it. My arms were cramped and knees weree knocking. The whole time, my buddy's fighting a fish, too. We both eventually land our fish -- a double header totalling 75 lbs. Had to release his to free up the cradle before we landed mine, or it would have been one ##### of a photo. Only bad thing was that mine was 35 and his was 40. I shall return to settle the score! Caught six 30 - 35 lb. range last year all in 6 - 18 feet of water. A great thrill -- even better than catching big pike to me."
518114,Guest,2002-03-14 07:43:00,0,"Whoa, Have you tried muskie fishing?"
518104,Guest,2002-03-13 06:53:00,0,"What do we fish for???????My answer is the strike and the fight. That being said; I don't understand the walleye frenzy. I've sat in boats many times and pulled up walleyes hand over fist on many Canadian lakes....in 30 minutes it's old and boring. No; there wasn't a 10 pounder in the bunch, but even if there were it still wouldn't be that thrilling. We go back to the age old question: What would you rather catch? 10 pound eye or a 20 pound Northern.......can't beleive its not a no brainer to every fisherman........see answer above. Not trying to get you boys all heated up but please for the love of fishing enlighten me..."
518105,bigfish1965,2002-03-13 09:06:00,3210,"I am blessed to live in an area with nearly every type of fresh water game fish you can think of. I have caught 40 pound salmon, 20 pound brown and rainbow trout, 7 pound bass, 30 pound musky, but the most elusive is the ten pound walleye. You are right in that you can go many places and catch a boat-load of 15 inch walleye in no time flat. However the lure of the walleye is the big guys. I am still in search of my first 33 inch fish. We grow them real fat around here so I have caught many 30-32 inchers weighing up to 15 pounds. I know the next live release record is here, somewhere, waiting for me. I also love the fact that I can catch fish that most people can only dream about. Is it some type of ego-centric obesession? ABSOLUTELY!!"
518106,Guest,2002-03-13 09:20:00,0,"Shouldn't it be Why do we fish not What do we fish for.Why do I fish? To get outside where there is no phone,TV,computer,wife etc.What do I fish for? Anything that will bite."
518108,DarrenB,2002-03-13 10:52:00,28,"I fish for walleyes not for the thrill of the fight, but for the challenge sense of accomplishment. It's a brainless technique to throw a piece of meat on a big hook and go to sleep for a while waiting for a 20 pound flathead to bite. Bluegills and crappies bite all day, and a bass will eat almost anything. Walleyes however,(at least in the Chicago area) are seasonal, moody, finicky nighttime eaters that actually challenge you. You have to outsmart them with different techniques,retrieves and tools to get them to bite. If you can do that consistently in a tough walleye market year round, thats as good an accomplishment as any."
518107,Guest,2002-03-13 12:03:00,0,you are
518109,Guest,2002-03-13 12:12:00,0,It sounds like you are looking for an excues to be a greaty meat hunter. YOu do know it is cheeper to buy fish that to hourd them from the lake....
518110,Jigger1,2002-03-13 13:38:00,234,"30 inch plus walleyes! I have one 29혬 Master Angler walleye in the photo gallery and want more. Don't get me wrong my largest northern 37혬 and largest musky at 44혬 put up one heck of a fight, but there is nothing like the head banging of a big fat trophy walleye on the end or your line. One of the biggest hits I've ever experienced was a 24혬 walleye pounding the crap out of a spoon on a wind swept point as I was casting for northern on Lac Seul. I'll be hunting for the elusive 30 inch plus on June 28th. Take a picture and let them go!"
518112,Guest,2002-03-13 13:48:00,0,"I am glad that those who like to fish walleye, generally stick to walleye fishing. If we had those non-catch and release fisherman invade muskie or pike fishing the sport would be devistated. That is why you currently catch so many 15 inchers while fishing walleye. Catching a 10 pound walleye is nothing more then luck. It is catching a big female that has escaped the hooks of the many fisherman that have tried to put them in their frying pan. If more walleye fisherman practiced catch and release you would see the amount of ten pounders dramatically increase. Mille Lacs Lakein Minnesota is an excellent example. Since imposing tight slot limits. Walleye fishing has inproved to the best its been in years and the average size has increased dramtically. These slots first received wide criticism by many walleye anglers."
518111,DarrenB,2002-03-13 14:49:00,28,"Mot sure what you mean by your post or if you are calling me a meat hawg or not but that was not the intention of my words. Basically speaking, I like catching walleyes because they are normally wary and the most difficult fish to catch. Therein lies the challenge. It's not to put every fish I catch on the table. Out of over 100 walleyes caught last year, I only kept 2. One because I was hungry, the other because it was gill hooked and bleeding."
518113,Guest,2002-03-13 15:54:00,0,"To Swimwhiz: Explain why the places I fish have imposed slot limits on Northerns also. You're making it sound like walleye fisherman are simply there to get some ""meat"". Granted, there are still to many fisherman who simply take because it's allowed, not because they're necessarily hungry. Yet those same people will take northern as well as walleye, so what are they, Northern or Walleye fisherman?? Yes, I am a walleye fisherman because I find that to be the most challenging (catching)and rewarding (releasing)type of fishing for me. That's what so great about this country, not everybody has to drive a chevy, like baseball, love apple pie or even fish for Northern to be o.k."
