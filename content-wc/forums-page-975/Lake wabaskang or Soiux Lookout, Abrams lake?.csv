Is part of the English River system, can boat upstream to Minnitaki Lake and downstream to Pelican then Lac Seul. Abram Lake itself is not the greatest fishing, it is right in town off the highway so get hit pretty hard but Lac Seul can't be equaled. If you don't have a very big boat ie just have cartopper or small aluminum with small motor may not want to bother with Abram but if you have a boat that will get you around and want to catch lots of fish, walleye, pike, smallmouth then Lac Seul is your best bet. Abram Tent & Trailer Park, Lincoln Tent & Trailer Park or Ojibway Provincial Park are three places that come to mind for RV's. Now the 1st two are on Abram Lake and provincial park is on Little Vermilion so would need to be able to trailer to Lac Seul or Abram or Minnitaki launch site, there are numerous public access points. Won't ramble on but if are interested in Sioux Lookout then write back and can give more info."
517733,Dave,2002-03-11 08:11:00,258,"Blink- We just started going to that area last year. Went the end of May & end of Sept. I thought the fishing was great especially in Sept.In May I got hooked up with a couple local guys and we drift fished the Sturgeon River that flows into Abrams Lake. Had good fishing especially around the bridges. I know the water level was high last spring and I just wondered if that same pattern works every spring.Also, Is Botsford Lake worth checking out? How about below the falls and the far end of it? Last fall we strictly fished Minnitaki and hammered them."
517737,Guest,2002-03-12 12:22:00,0,"Blink I hear minnataki and pickeral arm lake are very good fishing. Have you fished these waters. Also I have been told that their is good size perch in minnataki, can you confirm that or dont you fish for perch, I know many people dont. Also is it possible to get to Lac Seul from these waters by boat through the river system or do you need to trailer your boat to Lac Seul. Thanks Seidog."
517738,Guest,2002-03-14 07:14:00,0,"Your timing for the trip should be good for walleye fishing. In fact, Minnitaki (and Pickerel Arm of Minnitaki) offer up some great walleye fishing. Some hot spots, Redpine Bay, English River falls, Rice River, although these spots will be busy with alot of other boats. You can move between this chain of Lakes by boat (Minnitaki, Abram, Botsford, Pelican, Lac Seul) with two spots that hold some challenge. Abram Chutes seperates Minnitaki from Abram but there is a well defined channel running beside a walkway so no navigational problem here just stick to the channel. Getting into Lac Seul by boat is a little trickier but can be managed through Pelican Falls either by waiting up top and waiting for someone that knows the channel to go down then following or by using the portage trailer. This service has specific hours of operation so you will need to be back down Lac Seul before they shut down for the day. Not sure if there is any charge for this service now, it used to offered free of charge by MNR but seem to recall that a private group took it over. Or, you can trailer you boat and put in at Lost Lake (just south of Hudson)landing or Deception Bay Landing (7 mi north of Sioux Lookout). I never did any perch fishing while in Sioux Lookout (something I have only started down here in S. ONt) but would assume you may be able to find some decent sized perch in these waters (although no few jumbos as you may be used to) and any perch I ever caught up there seemed to have black spot disease or sand grain disease."
517734,Guest,2002-03-14 07:24:00,0,"Never spent any time on Botsford so can't provide any insight there but you will do well near any moving water in the spring for walleye. Buddy of mine used to fish from shore on Sturgeon R. where Hwy 642 crosses and do fairly well. Up top of the Abram Chutes on the left (going upstream) was always a great spot for big walleye in the fall evenings casting with huskey jerks or rapalas. I recall one fall (late Sept) coming out of the shallow part of Rice River after an evening duck hunt and shining my flash light into the channel to discover big walleye in the vegetation channels in 3-5 feet of water. Never did get back up there for an evening, nightfall fish to see if I could catch some of them."
517735,srj,2002-03-14 09:17:00,971,I've been on Botsford a few times and always had excellent fishing. I have yet to see another boat on the lake. It's a pretty run up the river--you can leave from Abram or there is a rough access on the river near the road crossing.
517736,Dave,2002-03-14 12:53:00,258,SRJ- When you fished Botsford did you ever try below the falls where the river comes in.

517722,Guest,2002-03-02 22:24:00,0,"This is my first trip to Canada. Will be going with my 4 brothers and elderly father. Trip of a life time. Like most, I have been talking to co-workers who fish Canada. One swears by Lake Wabaskang, and the other prefers Abrams Lake. We will be taking a motor home, so a RV campground is a must. Catching more fish is more important to us then catching fewer fish that might be bigger. Like every other wisconsinite, it would be nice if one day of the trip, we could catch a mess of jumbo perch. But mostly Walleye and Pike. Please help me with this problem. Thanks, Seidog"
517723,Guest,2002-03-04 13:49:00,0,"Can't speak about Abrams lake but can tell you alot about Wabaskang...have been going there for over 20 years and over 60 trips. Depending on the time of year, you will have excellent fishing for all species. Early June you will catch tons of walleyes and perch in the shallow water and close to upcoming weedbeds. Alot of times while fishing walleyes you will encounter northern. I actually fish northern more than the others because there are alot of nice ones in there. Late July things can slow down for the walleye unless your willing to fish early in the morning and again in the evening, but I've caught my biggest walleyes, 8 to 10 lbs this time of year up there, again, alot of fish are in the weeds. Northerns are good this time too. Finally, the end of Aug in my opinion is the best for all species, walleyes are on the reefs, easy to catch with jig and minnow, and the northerns are feeding heavily in the weed beds. Again, I cant tell you about Abrams lake but I love Wabaskang and make 3 trips a year there, 700 miles one way from home! There are several resorts in the area but I stay at Jim & Julies Wabaskang Camp, which is nice and has a large area for RV's and campers. Where are you from?"
517724,Guest,2002-03-04 16:47:00,0,Thanks for the info Big Mike. I'm from Green Bay Wi. We will be Going from June 9th through the June 15th 2002 Haven't booked a camp site yet. Because not sure where we will be heading. But it sounds like you just made a huge impact in the decision Thanks. Seidog. P.S. any more info you care to share would be appreciated.
517725,Guest,2002-03-04 16:49:00,0,"Big Mike, do you have a web address for that camp you stay at?"
517726,Dave,2002-03-04 20:33:00,258,Hey Big Mike--How is the fishing on Wabaskang the first week of July?Plan to be there that week--staying at www.kingfisherlodge.comThanks Dave
517727,Guest,2002-03-05 08:30:00,0,"Dave and Seidog: Wabaskang doesn't have a web site, but their winter phone is 319-352-5559. I will be staying their the week of June 9-15, so if you book reservations let me know, I'll share some more info with you. Dave, I've fished the lake over the 4th of July and good success on both walleye and northern. The walleyes will still be in the weeds and the northerns will also be going good. Of course the weather could dictate how great the week is but you won't have any trouble finding fish. One thing nice about that time of year is the amount of daylight. You can start fishing at 5:00 am and fish all they way until sundown at 10:00 pm!!!"
517728,Dave,2002-03-05 10:10:00,258,Thanks for the info. Big Mike this will be my first Canadian trip and really good to get positive feedback from someone that has actually fished the lake. From your experience what areas are best first week of July? What are the best presentations? Have you ever tried to catch any lake trout on Wabaskang?Thanks again Dave
517729,Guest,2002-03-05 14:10:00,0,"Big Mike , I will be on Wabaskang june 9th to the 15th also I will call and get info on camp you suggested. Thanks again, Seidog"
517730,Guest,2002-03-06 10:25:00,0,"Dave, First week of july fish the weeds. Wabaskang has several areas that have cabbage weeds, and the walleyes are in them. Probably could catch fish from 8-12 ft of water, both in the weeds and on the edges. Also try casting jigs to rocky points in the evenings, this works great also. Northern fishing will be good in the weeds as well. I don't fish for lakers but have seen some pics of some nice ones. I think that the owners of Kingfisher will show you the best spots for them if you ask. Good luck and have a great week of fishing!"
