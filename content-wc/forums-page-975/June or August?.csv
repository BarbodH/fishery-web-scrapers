My question is, should I go the third week of June, or the beginning of August? Which time would be better for walleye? I am kinda torn because if I go in June, then I my trip will be over so soon in the summer. If I go in August, I have something to look forward to all summer. What do you think?!?!?ThanksNette B"
518154,Guest,2002-03-14 17:55:00,0,"Hey there,I have gone up to Canada in June and the first two weeks of August. My experiences show that in June we catch bigger fish but we don't catch as many walleyes. The pike and bass hit very hard and give a good fight though. The first week in august is a good time to catch many walleyes but the big ones are hard to come by. The northern and bass still bit but not as often as in June. I would recommend going the first week in august. I think you have a better time and it will put a good end to your summer. Good LuckK-man"
518155,IaCraig,2002-03-14 23:05:00,434,"I ditto K-man, he explained my walleye experiences very closely. June can be great, but it can be tough too. In the spring the ever changing weather patterns, post spawn migration & mayfly hatch can all make the eyes be hard to find. So since Canada is such a long drive for me, I usually opt for August when the weather paterns are more stable and the eyes are a bit more consistent. Besides, after I jig and bottom bounce all day I like to relax in the evening by trolling crankbaits and August has been better for me when it comes to trolling. It has been a few years since I've gone in June, and now that I am a little better fisherman I'm ready to give it a try again.Whenever you go, I'm sure you'll have a good time.IaCraig"
518156,Guest,2002-03-15 07:42:00,0,"Over the years, we've tried just about every week from early June to late-August. I'd take early-August unless you are going to a shallow lake. If the lake is a shallow one where the eyes may start to hang in weed beds, then I would go in June before the beds have grown up too much. Just don't like fishing that way. Same for Pike. Its nice knowing where the cabbage is in August, but if there is too much growth in the lake, then you might wish you were there in June. If its a deeper lake, I go for early August especially that far north, mainly because of weather.Good luck either way.Jim"
518157,docIN,2002-03-15 10:44:00,120,"I have done both in years past and I especially notice less ""bugs"" in August. Just my 2 cents."
518158,Guest,2002-03-15 11:16:00,0,August is more predictable than June. Your bug situation is generally better and the weather is usually great compared to June when you can still get frost. I agree that the larger fish can be harder to come by but you have to go out looking for them. Lots of people beat up on smaller fish in shallower water and are just happy catching. Explore the deeper sections of the lake and you will be pleasently surprised. I also fish very early in the morning in the later summer and am usually back from fishing before the other campers are even up with a group of nice fish. Good luck and have a great trip.

BUT WE HIT THE PIKE HAD ALONG THE WEED BEDS A LOT IN THE 7LB TO 10LB AND SOME LARGER. 1 PIKE 16LB AT THE END OF THE DAY SO IT HAD LOST SOME WEIGHT FROM 90F+ HEAT AND 1 MUSKIE 25LB. ALSO SMALLMOUTH FISHING WAS GREAT BUT THE GUIDE DID NOT WANT TO FISH FOR THEM. BUT WE DID ANYWAY AND THAT WAS THE REAL TREAT. SOME LOOKED LIKE FOOTBALLS. GOOD LUCK ,WE CAME BACK WITH SUNBURNS. TRY TO TELL THAT TO YOUR WIFE."
518160,Guest,2002-03-15 14:52:00,0,"If you had said early June I would say you would catch more than in august, but by third week of June I would say numbers wise you should end up with about the same. August weather much stabler which has been noted-Walleyes will be deeper but once you find them you'll be able to stay on 'em. If you're taking wife or kids my experience is August is much better for lack of bugs, and water is as warm as it will get. Good Luck"
518161,Nette B,2002-03-16 21:02:00,39,"Well, thanks for all the great advice guys! Looks like August it is! It will be tough waiting longer to go but I am sure it will be well worth it.Have a great summer fishing!Nette B"
