516899,Tom,2002-03-15 13:16:00,1063,If you want to show your Grandson an awesome fishing trip and let him see what super hospitality is like try....www.peteandgeri.com....this is a husband and wife team and they run a first class operation. The fishing is the best I have had in over 40 trips to canada. I took my two grandsons there and they think that gramps is the best fisherman in the world. This is based on the fact that their arms ached every night after catching tons of fish....Good Luck

Canoe Canada is out of Atikokan, about 2 hours east of Ft. Francis and Kashabowie is about 2 1/2 hrs. east. They both have 1/2 week and full week and I think both have American plans. I also think they both have websites you can check out. Personally, my first choice would be Kashabowie, talk to Don or Fern, but Canoe Canada also has some good cabins. I think all of the cabins for both outfitters have solar panels for lighting, propane fridges, indoor showers, and all are generally well maintained. I have a 10 yr. old and wouldn't hesitate to take him to any of them. I think most have radiophones for emergency use. Gook luck wherever you end up. I'm sure you'll enjoy it."

516894,Steve,2002-02-06 09:02:00,259,I went with Kashabowie Outpost real nice people. They do not have Amer. plan. But You don't need as much food as you think when you have fish at your front door. I would go back with Don and Fern anytime I could. They have some small lakes that would be real nice for 2 people. My wife is not a camper but loved the place at Piche Lake. Good luck and I hope you catch as many fish as we did in late July early Aug. Just go somewhere!!! and FISH
