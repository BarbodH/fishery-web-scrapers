517740,WillieB,2002-03-04 07:03:00,292,"Looking for info on recent experiences with these folks, particularly their fly-in outposts.They limit # of people to 36 a year per outpost and to me that sounds great.Could only find one post in the archives about a trip with them 15 years ago, hoping for some info a little more current.Thanks"
517741,Guest,2002-03-04 07:31:00,0,What are you mainly fishing for?
517742,WillieB,2002-03-04 08:04:00,292,"We're going foe walleye and pike. This will be our 4th fly-in to a remote ""only cabin on the lake"" outpost.We've been north of Cochrane, Armstrong, and Kenora before...now we want to try north of Red Lake.I'm aware of most of the available options, but am looking very hard at Jubilee."
517743,reddog,2002-03-09 17:29:00,2158,"We flew into East Jubilee once, and tent camped at the moose hunting clearing, We were in there for 3 days, and It was probably the most memorable trip I have ever made to Ont. If I remember right, Jubilee lake is considerably bigger than East Jubilee. There is at least one portage out of East into another remote lake."
517744,Nette B,2002-03-11 20:55:00,39,"reddog,Are you talking about Jubilee lake, or Jubilee outpost and resort on Medicine Stone Lake? If you are talking about Medicine Stone, how was the fishing?ThanksNette B"
517745,reddog,2002-03-11 22:53:00,2158,I was talking about East Lake Jubilee. Sorry if you were asking about about Jubilee outfitters.
517746,Nette B,2002-03-12 05:58:00,39,Has anyone else been to Jubilee Outposts?? Has anyone fished Medicine Stone Lake? Thanks for any help.Nette B
517747,WillieB,2002-03-12 16:18:00,292,"Let me clarify...I'm looking for information on ""Jubilee Outposts and Resort"" out of Red Lake.They have a main lodge and cabins at Medicine Stone, and 3 outpost lakes...Hy-Vee, Kitty Hawk, and Trophy. I believe that Hy-Vee and Kitty Hawk are just east of the northern border of Woodland Caribou Provincial Park, and that Trophy and Medicine Stone are due west of Red Lake some 15 miles.Just wondering if anyone has any experience with these folks...their policies and set up sound great. Thanks"
517748,Guest,2002-03-15 13:00:00,0,Fished with Jubilee last year. The hosts are great and the accomadations are good ...but the fishing during our time there was below par for what we are used to. Fish were small and far between.
517749,WillieB,2002-03-15 13:38:00,292,"Craig, Which lake did you fish and when? Thanks"
