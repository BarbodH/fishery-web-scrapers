I can't complain about that but we haven't been able to land the big one. I was wondering if anybody could give me a couple hints on what to use during this time of year that would help us to land Mr. Big. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.thanksK-man"

517832,Guest,2002-03-05 16:25:00,0,Sorry the lake is not Dogtooth although I do know some people that do fish there.K-man
517833,Riceburner,2002-03-06 08:52:00,436,"You haven't given enough info on the lake--but that time of year you'll likely find feeding fish on the midlake humps, especially on top, in windy conditions. If the water is very clear, you may have to try evenings--then the largest fish come on plugs for me. Lou from Alex always said to try the big minnows under a bobber---Hey, anyone heard from Lou lately??? You'll get more help if you name the lake and practice c/r."
517834,Guest,2002-03-07 15:00:00,0,"Hey K-Man what lake you talk'n about. It could be that BIG walleye don't exist in that particular lake - I know of quite a few where your chances of catching anything over 26-27 inches is pretty much 0. There are places on LOW where it's near impossible to catch BIG walleye - parts of Sabaskong Bay area for example the fish simply don't get much bigger than 26 inches. However, if you head north to Clear water you can nail some very big fish."
517835,Rick,2002-03-15 16:48:00,226,Ditto...there are probably very few big girls avaliable. If you really want a wall hanger take some time off in October and go to Manitoba and fish the Red River. There are several rivers that are filled with hogs out of Lake Winnipeg and they come a feeding into the rivers in the fall. Me and three of my buddys have fished it the last three years and we have caught 18 Walleyes over 10lbs...biggest 14-6.....go get them!!!!!
