517983,Guest,2002-03-07 22:24:00,0,"I plan on stopping at Upper Red Lake, Mn to fish Crappies on my way to NW Rainy lake Ontario next week and am wondering if there are any restrictions on bringing fish into Canada. Can you get a certificate at customs? Do these fish count on your Canada limit?.I know when we do it the other way, ie fish Canada first then US, when you enter the US there is a sign ""If you intend to fish in the US, stop and declare any fish caught in Canada""I don't want to start a series of ""Fish Hog"" posts as the last time I went for Crappies to Ontario I only took 8 fish out of many caught.I just want to know what and if restrictions apply. I want to be able to take enough from Red to have a meal when we get ther, far from limits.Thanks in advance."
517984,srj,2002-03-08 14:17:00,971,I would suggest you call Canadian customs and ask. The number is 807-852-3341 (or was a few years ago). Knowing ahead could save a lot of time.
517985,Red Ruffandsore,2002-03-09 22:19:00,81,I seriously doubt you would get fish across the border into Canada unless stored as food in a motorhome or trailer. In a cooler in a truck or car...forget it. Your just gonna hafta chow down all them crappies beforehand.
517986,Reels,2002-03-10 04:52:00,2876,You can take the legal limit as long as you have a valid MN fishing liscence. Call though as previously suggested as laws change year to year.<{{}}><
517987,Backwater Eddy,2002-03-10 11:01:00,3871,"If you have a DNR warden from MN check your catch and certify it with customs as sealed, as a licensed MN angler, you may be ok?Canada is another deal you can only have your provincial limit in your possession. Lets say it was 10, well 10 is all you can have no matter where you caught them fish. We run into this situation every year with Goldeye as bait, but it is a game fish in MB Canada so we must only have the provincial limit in our possession to enter, or face a fine.They fish will need to be packaged in a fashion as to be conveniently counted by game officers. Also cleaned in a manner that species identification is readily and easily ascertained.It is a hassle. I recommend you try to find a place to store your US/MN catch here state side, then retrieve them once you return to the US, if at all possible.Backwater Eddy ~ ~><sUMo> ~ ><>http://home.talkcity.com/ResortRd/backwtr1/index.html"
517988,Reels,2002-03-10 13:07:00,2876,"True, they will hassle you sometimes. Even though its been a few years with the ""boarder wars with limits"" there seems to be some hard feelings still.<{{}}><"
517989,Guest,2002-03-15 11:26:00,0,"After many many telephone calls and telephone tag, here's what I found out.Calls to customs 807-852-3341 confirms no problem bringing DEAD fish into Canada. Question as to whether they are counted against your limitis a different story. Customs gave me the No. of ""Fisheries"" where a gal stated ""it should not be a problem of keeping your fish separate as long as you have some proof of where they were caught ie receipt from resort, note from DNR etc. Not a definitive answer. Then a call to Winipeg stated ""they are counted against your limit but an Officer ""may"" accept a note from MN DNR. Not a definitive answer.Finally a call to Ontario MNR 807-274-5337 stated ""they will be counted against your limit""So the bottom line is OK to bring in fish as long as the quantity is not over the province's limit (only 6 crappies in Man.) The possession limit is just that ""fish in your possesion""I've included the tel No,'s for reference.Also made the trip to Rainy for Crappies, good trip lgst 14 inches.Thanks for all the help. (even though it was not a W.E.trip)"
