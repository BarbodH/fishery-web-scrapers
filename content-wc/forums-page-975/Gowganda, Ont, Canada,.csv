516884,Dinky,2002-02-03 13:35:00,307,"Do you mean Goganda Ontario? This is close to Timmins,made a trip up there a few years back. If you fish the local lakes and dont take a fly-in you'll be disappointed. The waters down wind of Timmins have been hit by acid rain for many years. Ontario has cleaned them up and has re-stocked fish. Just starting to really recover. Nothing huge or what you would expect for being so far North."
516885,Guest,2002-02-06 16:49:00,0,"time to move on. ontario lodges destroyed their fishing through years of encouraging everyone to take all they could,,,,then they turned around and blamed the same people they encouraged! most of eastern ontario is cleaned out and you have to pray for a good week. look east or try western ontario where the pressure has not been as bad. fortunately e.ontario is on the road to recovery but it'll take years. i wouldnt even try an ontario fly-in. it's costly and not really predictably productive and when you're spending $$$ it better be. do your homework as you are doing."
516886,Red Ruffandsore,2002-03-14 19:20:00,81,Or is it Gogama near Timmins? Fished Horwood Lake many times over the years and caught plenty as well as quality walleye. Horwood Lake Lodge is well off the beaten path and great for first timers because there are no bad spots in that area. You will get fish everyday and some large ones every week.
516887,Guest,2002-03-15 10:08:00,0,"Gogama is actually west of Gowganda - there are two roads running south from Timmins, one to Sudbury, and one to North Bay. Gogama and Gowganda are almost equadistant from Timmins. If you were to form a triangle (roughly), you would see that there is a very large area that is ""off the beaten path"", between the two main highways. This area, and many of the waters in the Timmins area can yield some incredible fishing days. Horwood Lake, Lake Abitibi, and Nighthawk Lake are all excellent fisheries (resevoirs) that will only continue to thrive under new NE Ontario fishing regulations. The smaller lakes that are in the Shining Tree are just east of Gogama to Gowganda, are prime walleye lakes in the Canadian Shield class. These lakes that are back country (4x4 country) are awesome and do yield fish to 10 lbs on occasion. The lakes in this area, especialy the smaller ones that are home to outfitters are not worth the trip north - over harvest has reduced these lakes to marginal fisheries for walleye. However, if you could find local guide, or arrange to fish back country lakes it would be well worth the reward without having to resort to expensive fly-ins. As far as acid rain goes, it may have had an impact in the Sudbury area, and I know it devestated the lakes south of SUdbury down into the Muskokas, but anything north of Shining Tree in the Gogama area, or the Temgami or Gowganda areas are environmentally healthy - as long as over-fishing does not further deplete easily accessible lakes.North Eastern Ontario may not have the glamorous lakes featured in major fishing magazines, or the tourist infrastructure of NW Ontario, but it is exactly for this reason that I go north to the Timmins area to find outstanding fishing. Please practice catch and release when you go to ensure the future of the lakes and your future enjoyment of the resource.Canoehead"

New limits this year will ultimately help. My best was a 20 incher - but that was 10 years ago - numbers can be good, Gowganda itself is doing the local re-stocking thing - whether it helps is open to debate.Been going there for 18 years - never been disapointed - fishing may not always be the best - but sure is good enough.Remote - they just finished paving 560 last year :) I have a page with some local linkshttp://home.columbus.rr.com/paulhaskins/gowganda.htmEmail link on ther if ya want more.I stay on a 20 mile lake - no elec only a few cabins - LOVE it.Be there the 1st 2 weeks of July."
