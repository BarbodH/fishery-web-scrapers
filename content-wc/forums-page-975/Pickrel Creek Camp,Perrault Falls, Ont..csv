518056,Guest,2002-03-14 11:13:00,0,"Not sure what he represented to you but, if this is the camp just before Perault Falls, it is a spot just by the side of the road, not on a lake, on a small river connecting jack Fish lake to Pickerel lake but during low water/beavers up stream gets tough to get to Pickerel (small lake). Better drive on by and go north to Ear Falls, several lodges there. Suggest picking ones that are more remote and not right in town! www.justfishontario has Ontario lodges, and articles on lakes in that area. www.heartland.on.ca offers a free fishing map with tons of lodges and a good map of the area."

Pretty much all the lodges on Cedar and Perrault offer the same basic deal. Walleye, smallie, perch, and musky fishing are spectacular. This watershed is probably the most studied and most regualted in Ontario. www.cedarriverwatershed.com gives you the scoop on both Cedar and Perrault."
