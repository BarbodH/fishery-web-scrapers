517876,Guest,2002-03-15 13:52:00,0,I LIKE COLD BEER AND SOMEONE ELSE BEER. WELL MAYBE NOT IN THAT ORDER.
517867,Dirt Track Fisherman,2002-03-10 00:06:00,26,nothing like a cold Iron City Light on a warm night up north but when I run out I just go get something local from up there last year it was blue light year beerfore Molson XXX (this seperates the social drinker from the beer drinkers lol) year beerfore that Kokanee (which i thought was good) whats this crystal beer being talked about that maybe one to try this year.
517847,Guest,2002-03-10 15:07:00,0,Cheapest beer 157 is the American stuff at the LCBO stores. The cans especially. you can get american tall boys for the same price as Canadian cans at the beer store. Want a real treat..buy the imported stuff from Denmark...Fax breweries brews beer along the German line with stiff purity laws to 10%. The average is 5.5 to 7 and cost 1.85 for a half litre. That about 1.20 Can for a regular beer. Its also in cans so you don't have the weight.
517868,lobo1,2002-03-10 16:02:00,734,"The Crystal, I would say, is a lighter cleaner tasting beer (with less flavor) that leans toward the American mass produced brews. Us BUD drinkers like it as a main stay and go to the Export Ale and others for a little more guts. The Kokanee I have not tried but maybe we should this year.lobo"
517869,Guest,2002-03-11 12:10:00,0,BLUEICE cold of course
517870,Guest,2002-03-11 20:46:00,0,"My brother told the owners of the camp, where we stayed last year, after 8- 10 of those Molsons XXX I start feeling a little goofy, they said Holy smokes !! Canadians don't mess with that stuff! And they don't mess with you, if your drinking it!!!"
517871,Guest,2002-03-12 09:52:00,0,"Hey, I can get a case (24) ""Miller high life Lite"" for $10.99 on sale, that makes it my favorite."
517872,Guest,2002-03-12 10:21:00,0,"I have had all the usual suspects, Molson Canadian, Ice, XXX, LabattBlue, Etc, as well as a few less common, Brador, Molson 50 Ale, two was more than enough. Last year I had Kokanee. Great brew!! First slug made me stop and take notice! Smooth as cat sh!t! If you're looking for a new beer to try, give the Kokanee a run, you won't be disappointed :9"
517873,Guest,2002-03-12 11:40:00,0,"XXX, Brador, Ice are all head banger beers. Even a few gives you viscious hangovers. If you are so inclined have a few more rather than drink the high test beer ""specially brewed"". You won't have the hangovers. There is something in those headbanger beers that is not healthy."
517874,Guest,2002-03-12 13:42:00,0,Show me a 12 pack and I'll show you a hangover!! LOL
517875,Mike Michalak,2002-03-13 10:59:00,373,"Just in case anyone's interested...I just finished writing a book about beer! The title: ""It's Always Noon Somewhere in the World.""I explore the history of the brew, then launch into humor, toasts, recipes, the rules, stocking your bar at home, the future, it's all in there. It's fresh off the press and if you'd like more information or to purchase, please email me at either [email protected] or [email protected].It's 144 pages of fun. As one person said, ""This is far from a coffee table book...it's more like a toilet tank book."""
517859,Mahumba,2002-03-07 17:42:00,345,"I pretty much know what everyone's favorite beer is.Picture this:You are over at my place helping me shingle my garage roof. Sun has been beaming down all day. It's really hot out. It is now late afternoon and I ask if you want a beer. If you do want one you say ""yes"".Now everyone's favorite beer is a FREE one! Just kidding around. My Favourites are Black Label (cheaper too) Crystal, Canadian and Export. MGD is also good.Roger."
517857,Reels,2002-03-07 18:25:00,2876,No Hangover!! Your obviously not drinking enough!!<{{}}><
517860,Guest,2002-03-07 21:37:00,0,"My favorite is OLD MILWAUKEE, best beer around and us uppers love it"
517861,Guest,2002-03-07 21:43:00,0,Yeah! They like it in Iowa too!
517862,Guest,2002-03-07 23:47:00,0,"O.K. I'll bite,drinking beer in CANADA is a passtime. Now say you want to sip a few maybe try sleeman , kieth or walkerville, if you want too taste some good beers try rickers red ,extra stock or brador.USE CAUTION W/ ABOVE.Now, if your nuts try molson xxx, labatt maximum both are 7.3% alcohol.OUCH!!! USE XTREME CAUTION.Now if you ask me ,I perfer to be a baby and pace myself thru a 20 beer nite w/ molson canadian 5% and I do believe the molson sold in the U.S. is not 5%, therefore I prfer busch and boones farm. Be safe, everything in moderation. Sip or guzzel to taste, is spring here yet?"
517863,Guest,2002-03-08 09:33:00,0,<<<<Drinks rolling rock here in the good old usa. This year i will be buying beer in canada. Any suggestions on a comparable beer to rolling rock smooth crisp pale ale? I had some kind of draft last year the night before and it was great cant remember the name of it. If i remember correctly it is about $32 canadian for a case and a case is a 15 pack is that correct? By the way who ever was asking about how much you can bring through the border it is 1 case per adult.
517864,RIVERRUNNER,2002-03-08 10:33:00,100,"A case is 24 and it's about 34 canadian/ case bottles,cans are even more .Alexander Kieth's pale ale should be close."
517865,Guest,2002-03-09 07:57:00,0,"What, Haven't seen old mil on hte shelves in iowa in 15 years...thank goodness.Labatts Blue gets my vote north of the border, Bud South."
517866,Guest,2002-03-09 09:49:00,0,"im also from iowa, ive seen old mil, (old mud) but it is definitely not a fan favorite. Im here in Mayaguez Puerto Rico, and i could definitely go for a good canadian lager. Beer is very expensive down here, and i have only seen beer sold in six packs or 12 packs, which cost around 8 bucks!!!! They dont sell cases here, and kegs are non-existent!!!"
517848,Red Ruffandsore,2002-03-09 22:10:00,81,"They call it Labatt's 50 because there are only 50 people that drink it. Try Robinson's, a micro brewery out of Mississauga, Ontario. They make an excellent Red and dynamite Pilsner."
517838,srj,2002-03-06 14:08:00,971,"Bigfish, there used to be a couple of dark, sweet smoothies--Dow Cream Porter and Labatts Cream Porter. They haven't been available in NW Ontario for a while now. Do you know if they are still sold anywhere? Only beers I've ever tried that were almost as good half warm as pure cold."
517849,stewart,2002-03-06 14:34:00,100,Another vote for Sleemans as a beer to try.
517850,Wenty,2002-03-06 14:49:00,15,"I can't believe that I'm actually joining in on this string but I'll back the previuos mentions of Sleeman's, and you can also add in Kokanee, Molson Pilsner, and Canadian brewed Budweiser.As for the comment that you haven't drank Canadian beer until you've bought it in Canada simply isn't true. My uncle works for Molson Brewery and the imported stuff that you get in the States is the same that we get up here."
517851,Reels,2002-03-06 16:52:00,2876,"Moosehead, although I never see it sold up there...<{{}}><"
517852,Guest,2002-03-07 08:45:00,0,my favorite beer? one that is not illegal to enjoy :) sorry guys i could'nt resist!!
517853,Guest,2002-03-07 14:53:00,0,"Any of the Sleeman's products. I'm a Canadian and have been quaffing the Canadian brown stuff for many moons and I've never had a better widely distributed beer (this stuff definitely rivals the better micro brewery beers and even fares well against the better British beers - Bottington's, Double Diamond). If you like dark, try the Sleeman's Dark Ale. For something a little lighter try Sleeman's Cream Ale. If you like sweeter beer try the Honey Nut Brown. They even sell a Steam Beer. Only problem I've run into is I can't get it in cans (simpler in a boat).All of the big brewerys sell decent products but none of the big ones sell great products.:9"
517854,gofish,2002-03-07 14:59:00,24,"Ah yes, Sleeman's is a very good choice. But don't forget some of the micro-brewed beers like Fort Garry Dark & Fort Garry Pale Ale. Also, if you really want to get into the fishin' spirit, try Catfish Cream Ale from Agasiz brewery. It's not one of those ""down a couple in a hurry"" beers. More of a sipping type beer. These beers are readily available at any liquor mart in Winnipeg."
517855,Snoogans,2002-03-07 15:09:00,81,"Kokanee and Labatts 50 Ale.I swear, no matter how much Kokanee was polished off...I never got a hangover from that stuff. Tasty and ""morning friendly""."
517856,Jigger1,2002-03-07 15:34:00,234,That's what I love about Canadian beer no hangover! I understand it's the lack of preservatives that makes the difference. Looks like Sleemans and Kokanee have made the list. I love pale ale so Keith's Pale Ale has also peaked my curiosity. From what I know you only buy Canadian beer in Canada. The stuff you buy at the border is the Amerian version. The limit at the border is two cases per person correct?
517858,iamwalleye1,2002-03-07 17:17:00,1589,Blue light!
517836,Jigger1,2002-03-05 15:30:00,234,All this talk about beer has made my thirsty. Last year I tried Labatts Crystal and really liked it. What other flavors should I try? What's your favorite?
517837,bigfish1965,2002-03-05 16:28:00,3210,"Labatts Ice Beer and Molson Dry are great summer beers...served ice cold of course. If you like bold beer, try Niagara Gritstone. Sleemans is a great smooth lager."
517839,Guest,2002-03-05 17:00:00,0,"We like our beer when we are out camping and fishing. Just the thought of a beautiful evening and the campfire going after a good productive day of fishing, good friends, good food..........these thoughts are making me thirsty. Crystal and Kokannee are my favourites."
517840,lobo1,2002-03-05 17:10:00,734,"Blue, Crystal, and Molson Export Ale are the three that our group goes for. Just got a case of Crystal dropped off to my door today when a friend came home from slaying the slab perch at Simcoe - almost time to crack one !lobo"
517841,Guest,2002-03-05 23:25:00,0,"Keith's Pale Ale is the best, followed by John Labatt's Classic, then when they run out it's Blue and whatever else strikes us."
517842,Lead Bouncer,2002-03-06 05:23:00,9,..... C O L D ! .....-LB :)
517843,Guest,2002-03-06 08:11:00,0,Try some real beer like Labatt 50 or Molson Canadian - stuff that makes men - real men..........
517844,Guest,2002-03-06 08:23:00,0,"Canadian is what the kiddies drink! That's what they had at all the parties when I was in high school. When you graduate to adulthood, you can drink Export or Blue or Molson Dry."
517845,phidelt157,2002-03-06 10:52:00,191,"Along the same lines...Since I'll be buying after I cross the border, what's going to be the best case of beer for the money? I've had many Canadian beers...just never bought up there."
517846,Guest,2002-03-06 11:16:00,0,"If you haven't bought Canadian beer ""up there"" and have been drinking the American import crap, you haven't HAD Canadian beer.Labatt Blue is my favorite, and I think all beer costs the same per case. If you want a buzz, there's higher-powered malts than others...but I'm not sure what they are...I think Brador is (was?) one of them. I believe any of the ""Xs"" is potent stuff."
