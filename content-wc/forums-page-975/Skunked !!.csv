518224,Guest,2002-03-16 18:20:00,0,Spent the whole day getting into a Speckled Trout Lake today with my daughter and a good friend and his son. Took us till 1:00 with hard going to get there. Fished the rest of the day and caught 0. Not even a bite. However had a great time and lots of laughs. I guess I'll spend tomorrow checking out the equipment and the 4x4 for bruises.
