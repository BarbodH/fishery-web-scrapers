569750,Guest,2007-11-05 17:03:00,0,"I stay at Cushing Lake resort a lot (with my camper)- Walleye, pike and smallies numerous in all sizes. I usually fish the bottom of the bull, 5 sisters, burnt island areas. Take a gps and a good map. Easy to get lost on the first time(s)out. The rocks are a prop-shop dream come true (did in 2 this year in new areas) Also at times fish the north end (by the highway) Good around Poplar Bay, Coffin Island, East Bay etc. Smaller fish at this end of the lake, and harder to find deeper water (usually only 6 - 8 feet here)"

569660,trapper_john,2007-10-26 17:52:00,83,I've been there a few times and stayed at Thunderbird. I'm sure that there are spots closer and just as good but we always had good success down in boot bay. Take your GPS....
569661,Guest,2007-10-26 18:01:00,0,Big Lake with lots of islands and reefs. GPS is a must and experience on a large inland lake is a bonus. Good luck.....
569663,JDP,2007-10-27 09:55:00,1457,"I haven't been to LDML for many years. It is a very beautiful lake, with, at least when I was there, a nice walleye population. Pine Point Resort is located in the middle of the lake making it possible to fish a variety of locations easily. Also,I stayed at Open Bay Lodge. I can't comment on accomodations, service, etc. since it has been many years...here are the links:www.pine-point-resort.comhttp://www.openbaylodge.com/ JDP"
569701,Guest,2007-11-02 08:19:00,0,"We've been going to pine point for 10 years now and the lake has produced both numbers/quality fish for us. We do not use a GPS but we also know the parts we fish fairly well. I'd say for your first time on it, it would be very helpful. Lots of rocks in the lake, but if you're smart about it, you should be fine. Just ask about the hazards as much as possible and keep clear of areas that look bad. Also a good map can help if no GPS is available."
