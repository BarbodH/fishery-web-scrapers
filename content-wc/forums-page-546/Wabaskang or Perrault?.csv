1182016,teddi,2010-03-25 16:33:00,349,i agree.
1182053,WalleyeWally28,2010-03-25 17:55:00,298,I'm with you guys. I've fished Lac Seul for the past 13 years and don't know where else you could go in the area to experience better fishing.
1182575,trapper_john,2010-03-26 19:27:00,83,I've not yet fished it but have heard good things about it. However isn't that an awfull lot of water to learn?
1182696,WalleyeWally28,2010-03-27 07:48:00,298,LS is broken up into many sections with a lot of islands and bays. Most camp owners should be able to put you on the fish without having to travel very far.
1163160,ILScott,2010-01-25 15:22:00,139,rookies. Just curious what portages you did from peffleys? I have heard good things about wabaskang but never fished it. Maybe some year.
1163295,Guest,2010-01-25 20:04:00,0,"Scott, We portage the outlet falls into the Anishinabi and Cedar rivers. We fish primarily Wine and Beaver lakes. Good average size fish there, but better numbers for us on Wabaskang. Pretty, scenic trip down the river too. The place where we really killed the 'eyes was Peffley's private walk-to C &R lake. Lot's of walleyes and almost every one over 18"" with many in the 20-24"" range."
1164764,Kevin R,2010-01-31 05:11:00,305,Both are good. Some days are better than others just like some fisherman. I fish most lakes in the area when they turn on fishing is great. 2009 had more hot & cold fishing than past years but when it was on it was as good as it gets. Perrault has better bass fishing but Wabaskang is good. More Pike in Wabaskang but much larger pike average size in Perrault. Walleyes about even but bigger fish in Perrault. Both offer many miles of beauty to take in.
1172702,trapper_john,2010-02-27 18:18:00,83,"This summer will be our fifth trip to Wabbie. We have stayed at Thunderbird the last couple of times and the new owners, (Gerry and Linda) are super. They do everything they can to make sure that you get on fish. Like anywhere else, you have to catch um. They don't jump into the boar. We've had great success with wallies and SM Bass. Didn't get any big pike but the smaller ones are every where you would expect them to be. Wabbie is an easy lake to fish. Can't wait till June.."
1172801,teddi,2010-02-28 05:44:00,349,never heard of thunderbird befor. where on the lake is it?
1173086,team walleye,2010-02-28 18:45:00,336,"I have been going up to Perrault Lake since 2003. Our group has had some really good luck up there. Every year we have gone someone has caught a walleye in the 8-10lbs range. We have even had a few days of catches 50 plus... The walleye can get pretty hard to find and it seems like they are always in a different spot each time. As for Northern, I have never had any issues catching good sized pike. Last year we caught numerous ones in the 35-38 inch range.We have always stayed at Rocky Shore and love it there. The owners are great and will do anything they can to help you locate the fish. They also have a guide there that knows the lake real well and always puts people on big walleye.Honestly between the two lakes I dont think you can go wrong. You will have a heck of a time at either.check out the Rocky Shore website and shoot them an email...www.rockyshorelodge.com Good luck and have a great time up there!"
1173287,Tbum,2010-03-01 12:16:00,12,"Pretty sure he's talking about Kingfisher...this May will be my fifth visit to Wabaskang and Kingfisher. Gerry and Linda run a great camp. We've talked about trying other places, but year after year we have great fishing so it's tough to go anywhere else."
1174091,jka333,2010-03-03 13:30:00,14,"Bill, Don't know if you made up you mind yet....but I'd agree Perrault isn't the one to go to. I've been to Gawley's Parkview on Waubasgang...our of perrault falls...about 5 times. We've done very well on the species you are after. Ray Gawley is a great guy and runs an excellent camp. jka"
1176558,trapper_john,2010-03-10 12:30:00,83,you're right TBum. King fisher it is. Thunderbird is on Lac Des Melle Lacs. My bad..
1181916,warrior2090,2010-03-25 12:14:00,12,"I've been going to Peffley's on Wabaskang every year since 1985 and started going twice a year in 1998 or so. Great lake and a great camp. My group goes up for opening week and then again the last week camp is open. Have also been in mid June and early July, but like the first and last week best. Dave does a great job and runs a first rate camp. Can't wait for May 15th!"
1162897,BillFish52,2010-01-24 17:46:00,1,"Just heard about this forum and after reading a few of the posts looks to be a knowledgeable board, so I thought I would solicit some opinions. Our group this year is looking at the Perrault Falls area and are debating two options, one on Wabaskang and one on Perrault Lake. What info can anyone share with us regarding the general fishing quality of both lakes, we are primarily walleye fishermen, but like to catch pike, smallies and do a little dinking for perch.Thanks for any and all info!"
1162912,bpetersen,2010-01-24 19:29:00,251,I have fished Perrault out of two different resorts in June. Perrault is very spotty lake and can be very challenging to locate walleye of any size. We had our best luck traveling to Church Lake. I stayed at Rocky Shores and Rainbow Point. Bass fishing was poor and pikes were slow. Again walleye in the 3 to 5 pound range were hard to get but we were able to find good eaters.
1162955,go dart,2010-01-24 21:52:00,77,have also stayed at rockyshore. The owners are great. As many times as I've been I still hire a guide the first day. One year the dockhand was a local and also a heck of a fisherman. He told us Wabaskang was a better walleye lake but personally between Perrault and Cedar theres some excellent water.
1162980,BELKER 1,2010-01-25 05:50:00,16,HERE IS A WEB SITE FOR A GREAT CAMP ON WABASANG.peffleyscamp.com. GREAT FISHING AND NO GUIDE NEEDED.GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR SEARCH.
1162986,teddi,2010-01-25 06:06:00,349,if it was me i would go to cedar lake. better all round fishing.
1162996,Glenman12,2010-01-25 06:49:00,762,I would agree with Teddi about fishing Cedar Lake but Im biased as Ive fished it for over 25 years now..since you are new to the site try using the search feature to gather info on the lakes you are thinking about and then make your decision from there...
1163019,Guest,2010-01-25 07:41:00,0,"As my handle implies, we are relative rookies to Canada, last year being our fourth trip. We stayed at Peffley's in August and our trip was excellent. We caught a lot of fish (mostly walleye fishing) on Wabaskang and very close to camp. We also did both portages and the fishing was excellent there as well. Although the walk to C&R lake was more like incredible with four of us catching 88 walleye in just over 4 hours with almost everything larger than 18"". Can't opine on the other waters, but we are returning to Wabaskang."
1163048,WallerChief,2010-01-25 09:00:00,83,"We stayed at Sleepy Dog Cabins (www.sleepydogcabins.com) last year and fished Wabaskang for a week. Between the four of us we caught over 600 fish for the week. Had a great trip. We were having so much fun catching nice sized eaters that we didn't really go after the big one's, although we caught plenty of decent sized walleye's (18"" -22""). Next year we're going to be sure and take at least one day looking for the big one's.We enjoyed it so much that we vowed to go back to the same place year after year. Our thought was, why experiment when you know you have all the makings of a terrific trip on Wabaskang at Sleepy Dog Cabins. Tom and Margaret are excellent hosts!"
1163122,teddi,2010-01-25 12:32:00,349,tom runs a class operation. i would stay there if i was going to fish wabaskang. tom knows how to look after his guests.
1163146,CAFish,2010-01-25 14:19:00,3,"Our group fished Perrault once-so I can't really make a strong comparison, but I can say our first year on Wabaskang was much, much better than Perrault. (same time of year-but I do recognize that many variables play into the fish bite)Since then we have been going to Wabaskang and staying at Peffley's since the early 90's (actually was Lundy's then before Dave bought the camp about 6 years ago).We have never had a ""bad"" trip on Wabaskang out of this camp. Every year for us has been in the above average to good to excellent range. Dave runs a good camp and is very active and personable with us and other camp guests. The boats are spotless, come with nice cushioned seats and have almost brand new Yamaha four stroke outboards.To be honest, I have heard lot's of good things about all the camps on this lake. We like Peffley's because it is so close to where everyone catches fish.Wabaskang has always treated us well--so as they say if it ain't broke don't fix it!"
