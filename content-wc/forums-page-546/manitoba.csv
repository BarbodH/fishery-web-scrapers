1178327,Bigfishhunter,2010-03-15 15:38:00,803,"Mid August, I do a lot of fishing in the weedbeds, as well as the deeper reefs. I really find that there is a morning and evening bite more so at this time of year, but agin weather pending. Lindy rigs and a frozen minnow have caught a lot of fish for me. I like to troll with cranks or bb's t find them, cranks more so cause a little faster and find more active fish with the reaction bite. Pickeral bay on Athapap is pretty hit and miss at that time of year, and more miss than hits. That place gets hammered by locals, there are other places to fish on athapap for eyes, yeah, it is a slower bite than other lakes, but trophy potential is very very good. Try the are through mink narrows, in and around the islands. First Cranberry is another lake for really good trophy potential. if you are up for a little bit of a juant, you can catch more fish on third cranberry and really good fishing up the river into elbow. But that is a 100+ mile round trip, bring the camping gear, unless your boat is really fasst. Fishing is never slow up here, just need to keep changing and looking till you find them. Reed lake is also very good, also up near Snow Lake (the town) there are some great walleye lakes, Tramping and Wekusko are great, Tramping can be a blast when it is on. Don't forget our amazing lake trout and pike fishing, I mean a guy can only have so much fun fishing for eyes."
1178697,millerjr,2010-03-16 14:49:00,5,Thanks for the helpful info. We will be throwing for pike as well. I was told the lakers will be really deep by then. I have a down rigger....never used it....might try. Thanks again.
1178784,Bigfishhunter,2010-03-16 18:18:00,803,no rigger necessary and actually not the most effective technique. Chumming and jigging is the best way to go.
1183474,millerjr,2010-03-29 13:39:00,5,any easy way to describe where or how to get to mink narrows?
1184904,sptrix,2010-04-02 05:00:00,175,"Mink Narrows is the area, generally, between Little Athapap and Big Athapap. As you go through the narrows, there's one REALLY narrow spot with a steel post. That is what we've always defined as the beginning of Mink Narrows. Good luck. And try jigging for trout. You'll love it."
