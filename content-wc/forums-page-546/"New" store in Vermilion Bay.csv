Ray and Denise Elliot from Bobby's Corner have purchased it and plan on making some changes there. I'm not sure of their long range plans but I was told for this year they would have live bait and a gift shop at that location. I wish them all the best with the new location and am happy to see things turn around for that corner!"
1181896,38bill,2010-03-25 11:33:00,331,Are they moving the bait shop out of the existing location?
1181901,v-bay gord,2010-03-25 11:47:00,3168,"I'm not really sure on that, but my impression was that it would be a second location."
1181909,teddi,2010-03-25 11:55:00,349,"maybe to catch the east traffic going up 105. it,s a good location right on the corner."
1181945,DanM57,2010-03-25 13:51:00,135,So at which store do you suppose Bobby will be holding court this year?
1181956,Blue Lk,2010-03-25 14:04:00,269,"Good to hear about this,I wish them well."
1182014,teddi,2010-03-25 16:32:00,349,who cares.
1182036,Blue Lk,2010-03-25 17:19:00,269,He is loud enuf 2 B heard at both stores
1182072,v-bay gord,2010-03-25 18:48:00,3168,"Al, or ""Bobby"" is a good judge of character. He's a great guy, perhaps you just don't understand where he is coming from. He is definately one of a kind. For those that have never met him, you really need to check out the store..........."
1182144,38bill,2010-03-25 21:01:00,331,"Been fishing around VB for years. Last summer Al was sitting outside ""on break"" and didnt really want to come in just to fill out a couple of licenses. As we walked through the door I told him not to worry about it as I knew where the licenses were kept. I have never seen him move so fast."
