1183186,TIGHTLINER,2010-03-28 18:03:00,223,Yes i have a trip planned may 15 th.. Been there for 26 th time i think.. I just heard from the b & b i stay at that there is no snow in the bush. Lakes are low at this time.. Rivers and creeks are starting to break up. The ice on the lakes are all black and the temps are suppose to go up close to 70 this week. Looks like the ice could be gone around the 10 of april.
