1181249,rigger1,2010-03-23 19:44:00,35,"Thanks for the report Chad, and Nolte. Just heard from them. They drilled and moved all day long. Caught 2 short fish all day long. Finally at 5:30 tonight they found a school. They said it was about a 100 yard area that the fish were in. No depth change at all. They marked baitfish from 2' below the ice to 13' below the ice and the eyes were in that same range. They said they pounded until dark. Nothing big though - all 15"" - 18"". Will there be a big fish mixed in once in a while? Their planning on starting in this same area in the Am. Thanks again."
1181369,Chad,2010-03-24 07:33:00,3523,"Heard a report from yesterday. Fishing slowed a little. They caught 20-30 fish w/ largest being 24"". My buddies are trying to decide what to do today. There was a 2' crack that widened to 3' today. They also busted up their planks to get across."
1181792,Backwater Eddy,2010-03-25 07:54:00,3871,"Chad word is farther West/North and out has been better. Cleaner the water, the better the bite. The Red is pushing silt in preaty hard now, and ramping up.Wind and what may happen with the stress cracks from day to day is another story? If the ice sheet shifts, might be a long detour to find the home base and the trucks again."
1181843,Tony Shirley,2010-03-25 09:38:00,211,I can fix your truck lol.what happened? How u been doing?
1181888,LeeMB,2010-03-25 11:14:00,83,fishing has been great lately. Access can be a problem is your not familar with area. If your coming up bring quads
1178550,walleyedude2001,2010-03-16 08:51:00,76,Any current Lake Winnepeg reports out there ? Planning on going up this weekend. Ice conditions/mobility info would be great. thanks.
1178817,Bandit,2010-03-16 19:49:00,140,"Fishing Great 28.5"",29"" & 30"" inchers this weekend plus many fish from 12"" to 24"" ( Lots of fish at 21""-22"" ) Ice could get tough after this weekend if we don't get some cool nights. Quad or 4x4 trucks works well right now."
1178883,manitobawalleye,2010-03-17 04:38:00,885,they say cold weather is coming..... if so trucks may be ok if the shore holds up apparently a big hole has formed on the east side at balsam bay at the access point.... if i was coming up from the states i would be sure to bring a quad
1179201,I Fish GS,2010-03-17 20:58:00,290,Thanks for the report guys. I'm planning on Sunday and staying in the Winnipeg Beach area. Sounds like cooler weather for the weekend. Red is flooding here have to beat The water to the lake. Brian
1179270,Backwater Eddy,2010-03-18 06:56:00,3871,"Reports of melt holes on access points onto Lake Winnipeg are filtering in. Salt and mud has taken it's toll and trucks will not be advised to venture out from now on. ATV's are a better bet, and a safer bet. 1 truck reportedly went in yesterday. Fishing is good, access onto the lake is becoming more tenuous. Caution required."
1179309,Tony Shirley,2010-03-18 08:27:00,211,Hey Bandit were u in a red ford with a polaris ranger on lake wpg?
1179501,Bandit,2010-03-18 20:28:00,140,No but I would like you to fix my truck?
1180803,rigger1,2010-03-22 19:15:00,35,"Where are the eyes at right now? Three friends just got up there today. They are hard workers, and some good fisherman. Had 2 augers going all day long and never stopped moving. I heard from them after 7 hrs of fishing and they only had 12 eyes with the biggest being a 24"". This is their first time on Winnepeg. Should they be fishing closer to shore this time of year? Any general areas that the walleyes migrate to this time of year?"
1180832,Chad,2010-03-22 20:04:00,3523,My buddies were up there today and will be fore a few. They are out a ways and found clear water. Gotta find clean water.
1181115,Nolte,2010-03-23 13:54:00,3,Let me save them some time. Heat to the West side and go about a mile off Chalet. You will see a bunch of other people in the area. If they keep bouncing around that area they will pick up decent numbers of fish. We didn't pop any turbos but saw a few landed. Fishing on the east side and in front of the red was tough for us. We just got back yesterday.
