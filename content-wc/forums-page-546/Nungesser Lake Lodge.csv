Take plenty of jigs and rigs. Tip either one with a minnow and you'll catch hundreds of walleye on wind blown points. Get ready for great walleye fishing. Tim"

The staff was very friendly and they can put you on fish, but it is difficult not to get on fish in this lake. Our group has been going every other year since 2001 and always stayed at NLL. You should have a great time. The first couple of trips we used a lot of live bait, but over the past couple of trips we have been more successful using plastics. I don't know why, but it could be we have continued to learn the lake. I wish we were going this year, but can't wait until 2011."
