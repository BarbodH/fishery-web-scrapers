1182063,ILScott,2010-03-25 18:26:00,139,Looking at staying in Vermillion Bay on the way to camp. Just seeing what motels are available in town. Thanks
1182120,v-bay gord,2010-03-25 20:15:00,3168,There are two motels........the Northside Motel....807-227-5339 or the Pine Grove Motel.......807-227-2013.
1182218,rebs,2010-03-26 06:31:00,7587,"what are these two motels like ? I mean as far cleanliness and facilites, is there a boat launch close by or a place to get a sliup and leave the boat in the water ?"
1182266,v-bay gord,2010-03-26 07:41:00,3168,"They are both the ""mom and pop"" type of motel. I have not stayed at either but just from my observations the Northside seems to be the busiest, if that means anything. I have not heard anything negative about either one. There is a boat launch in Vermilion Bay, onto Eagle Lake. There is parking for your truck, but no docking to leave your boat in the water. Some of the area lodges may offer overnight accomodation, if they have openings, or a short stay option if you wanted to fish for a day or two. You could pm me if you needed more information. For those that are not familiar with Vermilion Bay, there are two good restaurants (Buster's BBQ and The Village Corner), a grocery store (Co-op), an interesting bar (Bayview Hotel), the liquor and beer store on the highway (LCBO), several good tackle shops (Bobby's Corner, The Village Corner) and a credit union if you needed to exchange some $. Overall a nice place to spend a night........or a week!"
1182268,JDP,2010-03-26 07:48:00,1457,The view of Eagle Lake from the highway as well...Awesome!
1182288,Blue Lk,2010-03-26 08:19:00,269,"There are lots of lakes to fish on a day trip basis out of VB,Indian Lk chain,Corner Lk,Ord & Thadeus,Cedar,Lac Seul & more.These are all within an hours drive & have landings."
1182338,38bill,2010-03-26 09:49:00,331,When we were doing fly outs we used to stay at the Pine Grove Motel. Its been a fair amount of time since we stayed there last and they may have upgraded but back then it was not so great. The rooms were better than the cabins but the fact that the train tracks were only a few yards away didnt add to the ambiance. The very first night I was sure the train was coming right through the cabin.
1182361,Muskie Bob,2010-03-26 10:47:00,45,"Pine Grove Motel has always been clean every time I have stayed there. And yes, there is a railroad track close. However, much to my surprise, it hasn't bothered me.There is a boat launch on Eagle Lake about a couple of miles from the motel, but no boat slips.I usually make my reservation by calling (800)-567-LAKE(Northwinds Canadian Outfitters).Since I usually stay only one night, other facilities aren't important to me."
