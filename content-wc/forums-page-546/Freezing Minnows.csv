1182312,Guest,2010-03-26 09:07:00,0,"If you are on an agressive bite, I would agree. But my experience the last two years is on a light bite the salted minnows are 2 or 3 to 1 over gulp, I know I'm the one fishing gulp, like you said less hassle..but not always better."
1182379,LoDo,2010-03-26 11:50:00,721,"dkrusin,I went to the site you advised and can't figure out where to do the frozen minnow search? Little help please...Thanks,"
1182385,LoDo,2010-03-26 11:54:00,721,"Nevermind I found it.http://www.lakemichiganangler.com/ti...ed_minnows.htmThanks,"
1182406,SSH,2010-03-26 12:25:00,526,"For the guys in our group that need the confidence of some meat on their jigs, we salt/sugar minnows that we purchase in bulk (either half or full gallon). Just put 1/3 cup salt and 1/3 cup sugar in quart ziplock along with 1 1/2 cups of minnows. Close ziplock and shake to mix the salt and sugar around in the ziplock. Then, freeze them. Then, take a bag or two each outing. These work well when trolling spinner rigs, too.The sugar helps minimize the salt's drying of the hands."
1182761,drlee,2010-03-27 11:58:00,409,"I have used salted minnows in a variety of lakes in Canada and have fished next to partners who are fishing with live minnows. Although I can notice some advantage with live minnows on rare occasions, the salt minnows seem to produce equal numbers of fish with less hassle. But, of course this is not exactly pure research. Just passing along my experience. Now, a question: Has anyone used the minnows that Cabelas sells? I would mostly be concerned about size...are the ""large minnows"" big enough for walleye fishing? Do they keep as well as salted minnows? Do they stay on the hook (jig or little joe spinner rig) pretty well? How about comparative cost? Would appreciate feedback. Finally, in past years I have purchased about 60 dozen salted minnows; I use a bunch of them in mid June; then, I keep them in a cool, dry place (basement) and continue to use them for a two week period in mid July through Aug. 1. And, I usually leave the ""leftovers"" at the camp for others, who still have success using them. Unusual? These are minnows that I have purchased in Wisconsin and they are packed in salt/borax. When you pull a handfull of salt out of the bag they are in, you will likely get about 15 -20 minnows per handfull...Just to give you a rough idea of how much salt is used. Now, if you will excuse me, I have to get ready to leave on March 31 for a month in a log cabin in northern Arkansas, where I will fish the White and Norfork Rivers for trout, and Lake Norfork for small mouth and walleye."
1181932,LoDo,2010-03-25 12:56:00,721,"Hello,What are some best practices with freezing minnows? Salted, unsalted, seasonings, how to freeze, packaging, where to hook'em, etc...Thanks,"
1181936,Bill Krejca,2010-03-25 13:17:00,6107,"Well, Lo, You should get a lot of good advice, most of which should work for you. After maybe 55 years of trying different methods, I have found that what works best for me is what I just finished doing 10 minutes ago - simply put the unused 2-3"" minnows in a plastic bag, add enough salt (I use pickling salt) to cover them, shake around a bit (the bag, that is), and place the bag in a freezer. That's it. Use as you would a live minnow. The results normally can last for 2 trips, if refrozen. (Assuming you don't use them all.) Bill Krejca"
1181942,LoDo,2010-03-25 13:38:00,721,Thanks Bill!
1181964,eye-hunter,2010-03-25 14:16:00,435,How well do frozen minnows work?
1181987,Bill Krejca,2010-03-25 15:03:00,6107,"For me, sometimes really good, sometimes, really bad. I guess about like every other fishing technique, about the time I get everything figured out, something changes! Bill Krejca"
1182051,phishfearme,2010-03-25 17:54:00,1242,hey bill - every time i've tried this (sometimes with borax) when i use the minnows (typically fatheads) their bellys blow out from the freezing. this happen to you? phish
1182095,LoDo,2010-03-25 19:35:00,721,The lake I'm going to is extremely remote with only 5 cabins and the only way to get minnows in is to freeze them. I was told to use borax and salt. The owners of the cabins say it works well. This will be my first trip to this lake and my first time using frozen bait.
1182107,Golden Eagle,2010-03-25 19:52:00,2642,Borax will preserve them and a little garlic powder gives them extra stink. I dry mine in the sun before freezing. It's quite possible that I over do my preparation.
1182226,speckeye,2010-03-26 06:42:00,61,I use a product called Bionic Bait for lots of bait preservation in saltwater.It's a powdered salt-like substance and it preserves color and doesn't shrink or wrinkle baits the way salt does.I think it toughens bellies better than anything else I've used.
1182249,Bill Krejca,2010-03-26 07:19:00,6107,"I haven't had this happen to me. When I used to use borax, tho, it seemed that I would get a real bad drying action, which sort of shriveled up the bait. Larger baits, such as chubs and really large minnows will soften in the belly to the extent that they usually (for me) just tear up in that area. Sometimes it helps with the big ones by dumping a bunch of salt into the minnow bucket, and let them swim around in it until dead - it seems to absorb better this way, then place in salted plastic bag.
