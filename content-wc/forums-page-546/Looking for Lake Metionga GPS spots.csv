Anyone out there been to this lake and if so might you have some hot spots you could share? Be great to get some GPS coordinates that I can program in to help speed up the catching process (its a large lake!).ThanksFisherman Ted

When we fished it in early June the walleye and northern were piled up near these. We never looked for any structure in the middle of the lake because the fishing couldn't have been any better than it was near the moving water. Get a map and you can see where the inlets and outlets are. There is very good fishing where the Brightsands river enters on the southwestern part of the lake, right near the Ignace outposts cabins. Some of the fastest action I have ever had, I was only there once but it sounds like this type of action is normal for this lake."
