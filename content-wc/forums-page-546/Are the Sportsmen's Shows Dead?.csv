1181388,Obabikon,2010-03-24 08:39:00,2370,"Both good points. There's definately a balance between being ""that guy"" and being outgoing and agreessive in sales pitches. The thing I don't like is when people don't appear to enjoy what they're selling. EX: I love fishing, I love talking about fishing, I love posting on fishing message boards... so, it's fun for me to go to shows and talk about how great Lake of the Woods (and Obabikon) is. Because I truly believe it's one of the best places in the world. Some booths just dont' believe in the product they're selling... that might include the Prostaff guys."
1181399,onetimedave,2010-03-24 09:03:00,502,"Attended the show in Hamburg NY and at the IX center in Cleveland. Both left a lot to be desired. Very few exhibitors and more flea market junk. Manufactures were almost non exisitant. The cost ate the Cleveland show is extremely high, $9.00 entry and then $8.00 parking. No wonder attendance is down. Outfitters would do better by upgrading their web site and doing a FAST reply (4 TO 6 hours after receiving internet request)."
1181401,dutchboy,2010-03-24 09:13:00,5717,"I'm not sure the web site is the only way for them to go. There are nearly 300 million people in this country and WC had it's record users on-line at just under 700. While that number (700) is impressive it shows not everyone knows how to find fishing web sites never mind how to find camps you have never heard of.They have to have the shows, augmented with a good web site I agree will help them promote.BTW, Mpls show is $10 and the ramp is $10. But what are you going to do?"
1181402,Peffley'sCamp,2010-03-24 09:18:00,37,"Excellent point. If anything, I probably am often viewed as too ""over the top"" as I think show guests often misinterpret my overall passion for camp ownership, the sport of fishing, talking about fishing etc. as an in your face sales pitch. While everyone is of course ""pitching"" their product, part of what we are doing is just just expressing our passion for the overall Canadian fishing experience. Like many, I am just one of those guys who went to Canada the first time (for me early 1980's) and fell in love with it. It's been in my blood ever since, and now I am blessed to be able to call our camp home for the summer."
1181471,PIKEMAN330,2010-03-24 12:45:00,101,"I think the shows are dead or dying.I think its a shame.they used to be a lot of fun,this time of year. I have gotten a lot of good information from shows in the past.Once people stop going it will be very hard to get them back.Just one more thing we enjoyed,but I fear they are gone. Good Fishing; Pikeman"
1181481,Peffley'sCamp,2010-03-24 13:08:00,37,"Unquestionably the dynamic of sport shows have changed in recent years. Most of the change in my opinion is attributable to the internet and the wealth of information available on it. Whereas the sport shows used to be the venue to gather all the information about a prospective camp you needed, most of that can now be done online.I think the shows still have a place for now in that some consumers do their research in advance of attending the show, with the desire to still meet and talk face-to-face with the camps on their short list before ultimately making a decision. I know for us, the sport shows serve the purpose (just as it does for many sportsmen) of getting us out of the house and talking some fishing. Like I have said many times, ""if I can't be fishing, at least put me someplace where I can talk about it"". Taking a booking or two from a show is always a plus and what the ultimate goal as an outfitter is, but regardless the offseason is WAAAAYYYYY too long for me to go the whole year not talking about our camp and some Canadian fishing!"
1181524,Enid Elizabeth,2010-03-24 15:05:00,59,"I agree with Obabikon, Websites, blogs and such are a must. Sport shows could be optional. We still go to shows because we think it is part of the ""package"". Surely, fishermen want to meet the outfitter. Old guests come to visit and think about another trip. If we keep going to the same shows, we become recognized in that area. I have cancelled print media (ads in magazines). Saw not results.BUT without return guests and word of mouth, we would not be in business!!!"
1181530,v-bay gord,2010-03-24 15:27:00,3168,"Some good views from both the aisle perspective and those manning the booths. In my view the shows are going through a tough spell for all the reasons mentioned, plus add in the poor economy and the reluctance of folk to want to spend. I also think there has been a glut of shows. Perhaps the shake-down over the next few years will leave a few good shows to survive. I personnally would rather spend my advertising $ in other areas.........plus the time away from family, ice fishing, and the wonderful view I have out my front window is worth more to me than any money I might generate at a show. It took me a while to realize that. Others would disagree and I am sure many actually enjoy the show circuit. Have fun!"
1181949,doubleheader,2010-03-25 13:53:00,2652,"I attend the Harrisburg PA Show annually. It is a huge show, but this year unfortunately the weather was horrible and walking around the show on Saturday was like being at a mall at 8:00am in the morning. I was talking to this one boat dealer, they had quite a decent size area and they sold Lund and Skeeter as I recall. Anyhow he told me they spent over $50,000 for their space. He told me they consider it advertising, but no wonder the marine industry representation was way down from previous years. While we talked, for 30 minutes or so, only an occaisional customer even looked at their display boats, and they probably had 20 boats on display. I'll bet overall there were less than 1/2 the boats of previous years."
1181002,Obabikon,2010-03-23 07:50:00,2370,"Actually... several of the All-Canada shows were up this year. St. Louis was way up St. Charles was up (previous year was aweful weather) Indianapolis was up quite a bit Those three off the top of my head I know attendance were up. They mentioned a couple others to me, but I can't remember. The Minneapolis one was REALLY bad."
1181045,teddi,2010-03-23 09:11:00,349,they were up compared to what? last year or the year before. i see you are not going to be at the northwest show in mpls.
1181269,1shooter,2010-03-23 20:23:00,1493,I hope they are not a thing of the past.......where else am I going to get my Leech Lake knife sharpened.
1181300,Steve of Madison,2010-03-23 22:22:00,230,"Don't you guys use the shows as a way to ""scratch that itch"" in the middle of the winter, gather some reading material, and talk fishing....But really already have a place to go or have reservations done some place?I would think that a ""Great"" website is the best way, along with repeat and word of mouth, DUH, of getting new business.Not that I know anything about building a website, which I do not!!! But marketing is something that I believe alot of the resorts and camps are way behind the times! The same old tired websites, expensive brochures that all say the same thing, and shows that cost camps alot of money, ""just to break even""! Really! there must be a better way to do this."
1181310,Obabikon,2010-03-23 23:31:00,2370,"Actually... I will be at the NW Sportshow. I'm in the hotel right now. Yes, up from the year before."
1181311,Obabikon,2010-03-23 23:34:00,2370,"Steve, I agree that there are better ways to market. Many owners need to get creative with the way they run their resorts. By ""just breaking even""... we plan on our guests returning at a rate of over 85%. So, breaking even at a show year in and year out helps a business grow in following years."
1181312,Obabikon,2010-03-23 23:39:00,2370,"Our camp name is under ""amason's obabikon"""
1181368,dutchboy,2010-03-24 07:32:00,5717,"I agree with scratching the itch! I'll be at the NW show this afternoon unless work gets in the way. Here is what those who go will most likely see.Lots of pro staff huddled around each other shooting the bull.Lots of booth staff either on-line or talking to the next door neighbor.Lots of potential business strolling past without so much a a smile towards them.What you won't see in many booths is people trying to sell.Seems the lost art of ""hello, would you like a flyer? Can I answer any questions?"" in out the door.But hey what the heck. If people filled their camps and sold tons of product what would they have to complain about?Remember the old saying...............""You have one chance to make a first impression."""
1181375,Peffley'sCamp,2010-03-24 07:57:00,37,"Dutchboy,While I would agree with you to an extent, I would also offer you my personal observations from years of doing shows from behind the booth.There are many show guests who absolutely do NOT want to be addressed in any manner. I have pleasantly greeted many show guests thru the years as they begin to approach the booth, only to have them turn on a dime to AVOID talking to you. A simple greeting such as ""Good Afternoon or ""Hi, how are you doing"" is sometimes met with either a sneer and the ""What are you doing talking to me"" look or just simply walking away most of the time without even a simple reply such as ""Fine, thank you.""I have also encountered the following. I will deliberately leave my booth unattended and as you mentioned go down the aisle a couple of booths to visit with another outfitter. A group will approach our booth, and stand there for 10 minutes looking at photos. Watching this, I make the decision that they appear somewhat interested in what they are seeing so I head back down the aisle to the booth and greet them with "" Hello, can I answer any questions for you gentlemen?"". I would honestly say that at LEAST 75% of the time, they will walk away without a word, OR walk away after saying ""No"".From BEHIND the booth, after years of this, you get gun-shy as an outfitter even to attempt to greet some people. At certain shows (in some markets) I have honestly found it more productive to not say a word until the show guest addresses you first. Obviously this is not a blanket statement-as we also encounter many, many pleasant and sociable show guests who are interested in your product or at least a brief social encounter, but I think it prudent to see both sides of this story."
1181385,dutchboy,2010-03-24 08:17:00,5717,"I understand completely. I have been there behind the counter (not in this industry) and I know how it feels to have people just walk away. But, I don't see how you can sell if you don't make the attempt. Kind of a catch 22 thing I guess. I also think part of the problem may be that the same people are manning the booths show after show. If you have a camp you may not have any choice but to be at 8 shows. That said it gets real hard to have any enthusiasm by the 4th show.I know for me I stop at booths that have a interesting picture or a map of where they are at. I have no intention of booking a trip but I'm still curious enough to stop. Even though I'm a waste of time I did see the booth and may talk to somebody who will be interested.I guess my main complaint should have been more directed to the booths that use pro staff. The vast majority of these guys are there fulfilling a obligation and have little more knowledge of product or selling ability then the average Joe who fishes.In any event. In years past I have attended all the shows around the twin cities. This year the NW show will be it. The only one. Best of luck to all the vendors. Hope the show turns out to be profitable."
1180474,wishinfishin,2010-03-21 20:52:00,6,"Went to a couple this year; higher ticket prices, higher parking fees, fewer lodges, more junk."
1180485,Pooch,2010-03-21 21:45:00,4619,"Twenty years ago the ""All Canada"" shows were great, but over the years numerous lodge owners have to me that they were getting too expensive and not producing the bookings that they did in the early days.My guess is that the web killed them or at least has them on their heels. They were fun to go to in the late 80's and early 90's.Too many lakes and not enough time left for us old toads.Pooch"
1180605,phishfearme,2010-03-22 10:41:00,1242,pooch is right on the money!! outfitter just can't justify the costs - they would do MUCH better by providing a discount to one group for referring another group to the outfitter. phish
1180615,rebs,2010-03-22 11:16:00,7587,"the sportsman show in Buffalo was about 905 hunting and 10% fishing. The majority of all was flyin trips and a few lodges. No manufacturers, hardly no booths selling fishing stuff, not many boat dealers, only one seminar and only given at one time on one day only from Southtowns Walleye. There was not very much there for a fisherman other than a flyin trip possibly. As far as hunting there was not a whole lot there other than flyins or long drives out west.That show used to be great with all the manufacturers there for everything from fishing line to sonar units. As well as hunting manufacturers.This show has definately lost appeal over the years."
1180868,Fish_on,2010-03-22 21:15:00,1856,"Sports shows are going the way of the dinosaur. There was a time when they were the perfect thing for the need that was there. The need is no longer there and they have gotten really expensive both for the dealers and the visitors. Parking, gate fees, the price of gas, big pricey foods, etc. You could easily drop $100 per family of four just on the show itself then how much do you have left for buying soemthing from the dealers? For the dealers, the booth prices, motels, travel costs, etc. has gone way up and the ones who are selling stuff have to sell more to make it pay so lees of them are going. Lodges can better invest their money in flyers, mailings, twitter, facebook, and especially the internet. Within ten years most sports shows will be a memory."
1180880,Obabikon,2010-03-22 21:51:00,2370,"Sports Shows are a completely different service these days. Most resorts go there to break even... if they can add enough guests to pay for the show/meals/hotels, it was a decent show. Most resorts bank on return guests, and that's where the money is. There's people out there that still want to meet face to face. I'm not sure the shows will ever completely disappear, but they are definately smaller. Also, I think attendance ""overall"" was up this year. The Milwaukee Journal show was attended very well all five days. Some shows are hurting, and a couple shows are making come backs. The shows will be around for many years to come, but never will they be like the ""old days""."
1180903,counterguy,2010-03-22 23:02:00,84,"They are dead in only a few states. here they are. Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Iowa, Wisconson, Michigan, Nebraska, Illinois, Missouri, Montana, California, New Mexico, Manitoba, Ontario, Chechnia, Iraq, Bosnia, Venezuala, Brazil, and definately Haiti."
1180939,teddi,2010-03-23 04:49:00,349,"the northwest show starts tomorrow in mpls. it should be good,lots of exibitors. the all canada shows suck big time,high prices and not much there."
1180966,Glenman12,2010-03-23 06:33:00,762,I worked the All Canada Show in St Charles for our lodge on the Thursday and Saturday..did you ever hear what the attendance figures were for that show?..the opener was decent but attendance was solid on Saturday..the week before we worked at the Chicago Musky Expo and they set attendance records for all 3 days...
1180976,teddi,2010-03-23 06:51:00,349,the numbers were down for all the all canada shows this year. they were also down for most of the rest of the shows. lots of interest but no money.
