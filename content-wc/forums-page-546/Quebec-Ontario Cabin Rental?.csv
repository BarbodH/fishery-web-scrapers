1181467,serino,2010-03-24 12:23:00,1,Hi Everyone:Was wondering if anyone could recommend a driveable cabin rental located in Quebec/New Brunswick/Maine/Ontario with good Smallmouth/Walleye/Northern fishing. Private/remote and kid friendly would be a big plus! Travelling from upstate NY...Thanks!Dave

Things that I think would be helpful for you to provide to get some good input are: Do you have your own boat? What is your price range? Do you want meals to be provided or will you cook yourself? What fish is your priority? (See reason below.) How far are you willing to drive? I can speak to your search for smallmouth/walleye/northern fishing. To find numbers for each species at one spot is really tough. From my knowledge, Maine and New Brunswick will be out due to not much walleye and very limited pike fishing. Quebec and Ontario have some spots but I need to know a little more before giving specific locations. Chris"
