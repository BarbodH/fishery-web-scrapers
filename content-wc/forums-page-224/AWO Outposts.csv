4924745,hoppy63,2016-06-13 19:50:00,367,Thanks plumber. I believe melchette and kayedon are all awo have now. Have a great trip.
4925697,onetimedave,2016-06-14 07:17:00,502,"Just returned from Melchett. At this time Melchett and Kayedon are the only two AWO operates. Retirement time. Cabin and boats in good shape. Weather not so. Heavy rain, fog, high winds and cold. Caught just short of 2,000 fish with largest eye being 28.5 inches. Largest we have ever caught in Melchett. Large pike scarce but did hit the 40"" mark with one pike. Party after us had worse weather but had a good fishing trip."
4925889,vteye,2016-06-14 07:49:00,812,Hoppy - Kayedon was fine last year. He had 4 boats with 3 decent motors. One motor was shot. Maybe One time can respond to that. Hey Onetime - how were the water levels at Melchett & Kayedon? Thank you
4928673,onetimedave,2016-06-15 07:00:00,502,Water level about normal. Maybe just a little low. Only place we ran into trouble was in the outlet river(No Go River} coming back from the lower pool just above where the bad rapids are. Many rocks just under water. Already planning for next year.
