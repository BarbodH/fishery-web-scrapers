If I find out that my host can make a profit charging an entire class of customers 20% less than they charge me I'm going to feel like I'm over paying. I get that some people, friends or large groups on extended visits, can negotiate a better deal and have no problem with that. A discount for kids is seeding for the future. Those are small exceptions. A blanket policy that a certain class of people can pay less rubs me the wrong way. And when the lodge gets more Canadians visiting because of the price break am I going to start paying 50% more to cover the subsidy? Set a price in the fall for the next year and let me pay it then. If I wait to pay I run the risk that the price may fluctuate because of the exchange rate. I'll take the risk the same as the owner does."
4957625,LOWSKEETER44,2016-06-29 22:13:00,3,"I believe there is a difference in the way they are processed. The American credit card machine posts in US dollars and deposits US dollars into his bank account which he then converts to Canadian dollars to pay his bills, suppliers etc that are Canadian. The Canadian is processed through a Canadian bank and if he ran my American credit card through that machine I would receive the conversion rate. And that is why the staff explicitly asks what type of credit card you will be using ( American or Canadian). Very discreet and innocently asked. If paid in cash then no questions asked that I'm aware of.After reading all the comments I believe everyone has made some valid points. Me, I'm going to run my credit card through the Canadian machine next time or pay in Canadian cash. I have travelled enough and get all the nuances of airfare, hotel stays etc. but I still feel I was gamed as we all received the same food, drinks at the same exact moment and one group paid more on the spot. That's sneaky no matter how you cut it because it wasn't disclosed at all anywhere in print or prior to ordering."
4957865,Guest,2016-06-30 05:55:00,0,"I think the whining about someone getting a better price is silly. It is marketing plain and simple . I remember a few years back when I downhill skied , A Michigan Ski Resort (Boyne) had a annual ""Canada Week "" near the school March break, and even though Canadian dollar was low (like now) they took our money as par to the Michigan skiers . So Canadians were given a 15% or more break to get us to go down there and spend. I don't remember seeing any American skiers complaining how they should get a discount too, they were happy that the resort was full and viable and we all enjoyed the skiing camaraderie. The extra numbers of Cdn tourists allowed the resort to be able to have more events and employ more staff."
4958113,Shellback,2016-06-30 07:24:00,8083,"Offering discounted or par package deal prices is one thing, but when you start charging different prices for meals to a group dining together, that ain't right! Hope it bites them in the A**."
4958257,BornToFish,2016-06-30 08:20:00,1224,"Many thanks Shellback for your response. As I watched this thread evolve, I thought that my views were beginning to stand alone.I understand that fishing lodge's need to market their product. They can do this by providing incentives (discounts) to underdeveloped segments of their market. For example, lodge owners can offer discounts to father/sons, families or groups that book in September. For example, a father and his son in the next cabin would pay less than my wife and I. I'm okay with this arrangement.What bothered me about the original post was that different people within the SAME group were paying different amounts for their vacation. I respect everyone's opinion on this matter as stated above, but I am certain that if that were to happen to me, I would not return to that lodge."
4958697,Wawajake,2016-06-30 10:48:00,413,"Seems to be ""much a do about nothing"" . Many times the guy sleeping in the same hotel room two doors down is paying half the price you are ...get over it. Life is too short."
4959249,Crede,2016-06-30 15:08:00,134,My opinion: I would be unhappy if I thought that I was subsidizing the discounts to others. I wouldn't care if I thought the owner was subsidizing the discounts to others.
4955489,farmnfish,2016-06-28 18:38:00,130,In the US it is illegal to discriminate on price based on national orign. I would think Canada's laws would be fairly similar?

4955793,wellpastcold,2016-06-28 21:52:00,1351,Nonsense. When I golf in Vegas we pay full fare. Locals get the same round for 40% less. There are always deals for locals in every resort location. The lodge we stay at in LOTW charges me in Canadian $. We are usually the only Canadians there any time we have been in camp. The lodge owner is American. He would desperately love to get more Canadian business.

4955945,Thompmd,2016-06-29 05:29:00,320,It's pretty simple in my eyes. If you like the Resort but not the situation then discuss it with the owners. If you don't like their reasoning then tell them your going elsewhere. Ask any of the business owners here and I think they would all tell you that if enough people leave they will make changes. Your money matters.
4956489,Guest,2016-06-29 10:48:00,0,"Wow ...........similar to the airline seat comparison , every hotel you sleep in someone is probably getting a better rate then you . The lodge owner decides what demographic he needs to increase and provides a discount........good for him its called marketing . Whats next........hey that guy over there across the street is making two dollars an hour more than me and we are doing the same job .....he should have to take a pay cut so we are all the same..........quit whining and enjoy the situation , your fishing not working at the stock market !"

4957001,farmnfish,2016-06-29 15:12:00,130,"I don't necessarily blame the lodge owner for doing what they can to expand their business and maximize their profits. Price discrimination is a well studied science. Some practices are legal some not. Personally, if a business is charging the nationality, race, sex, age, hair color, or attractiveness level that i belong too more than others they better be offering something unique in exchange. Like ladies night at a bar drawing in females, better service, or a base price that is still better than the competition. For the most part i have no idea what others groups are charged at the places i go, don't think about it at all, but i don't know a person who would not be shocked if they walked in a McDonald's and the prices listed were different for different nationalities. And I am just about postive that if your nationality was charged more you'd walk out without the cheeseburger. And if a gas station was offering a better price to some of their customers, a group i was excluded from because the circumstances of my birth, while the station across the street offered me and everyone the same price, I'm going to the one across the street. So, I'd think basing price on nationality would be dangerous territory for a lodge owner to tread."
4957105,fooch1199,2016-06-29 16:31:00,10,"As a Canadian who has been on a few fly ins, why do I have to pay rates based in US funds? I know the answer. If the Canadian dollar was higher, the rates would be in CAD. Seems a little greedy to me. A special on ribs at a hotel in Wawa was $30 CAD last year. Yes a great deal for Americans but not for the person who lives here. The outfitter I am going with converted their price list to US funds this year while keeping their numbers the same . Will they change it if the dollar goes the other way?"
4954489,3M TA3,2016-06-28 11:00:00,2846,Back to the OP. I meant to ask. Is there a difference in an Canadian issued Credit Card versus an American issued Credit Card? When I scan at a pump or restaurant or hotel in Canada I am always charged in Canadian Dollars with my US issued Credit Card. The card company then makes the conversion for that day and I see it on my bill at the end of the month. I don't get it.
4954505,v-bay gord,2016-06-28 11:02:00,3168,"Huh? Are you saying I can pay for stuff in the U.S. with my Canadian dollars? At par? Let me know where.. ...and no, I'm not one of ""those"" lodge owners that discriminate. I charge in Canadian $......for all my customers. It just so happens the U.S. guests are getting a discount....but not from me."
4954537,BreezyPoint,2016-06-28 11:20:00,1581,It is possible to charge a U.S card in Canada in U.S. Dollars. I know a resort owner who does precisely that. Frank
4955081,kzoofisher,2016-06-28 14:40:00,5144,"Hmm, it's illegal in the US to discriminate in employment based on national origin. Don't know about providing goods or services but I wouldn't be surprised. If my lodge chose to charge Canadians less I would have to be confident that the rate I was paying was very competitive with comparable lodges. Otherwise, I would feel like I was subsidizing Canadians and paying for someone else's vacation. I would feel exactly the same if I went to New Orleans and found out that Kansan's paid 25% less then me for the hotel."
4955265,Guest,2016-06-28 15:35:00,0,"Yes it is. All depends how your merchant account is set-up with the credit card company. I charge in US dollars and take cards from all countries. The merchant account charges that card in US dollars and it is up to that card to determine what or how to convert it, or if it even has to be converted. -Fisherman Ted"
4955345,BreezyPoint,2016-06-28 16:45:00,1581,No it is not illegal to discriminate when setting prices. It's done all the time. Easiest example is the senior discount at Culver's. Online merchants set different prices based on your personal characteristics you reveal to them. Then there are resident and non-resident rates for a plethora of items.Check out this link:http://lifehacker.com/5973689/how-we...an-do-about-itFrank
4955369,AMPHIB206,2016-06-28 17:10:00,191,I am a Canadian; live in Manitoba. I frequent LOTW quite often to fish. I'd love to stay at a lodge for 2-3 days. Most lodges charge in US funds. There is no way I could fork over 150 dead presidents to stay in a lodge in Ontario. I understand a lot of lodges are owned by Americans or cater to American clients. I get that. I don't think there's too many Canadian families that would pay US money to stay in their own country. I could be wrong..... I'll be at the Cheesecake Factory next week in Edina and Cabela's in Rogers. I have no problem paying US.
4955385,Shellback,2016-06-28 17:14:00,8083,"Well, we have resident and non resident prices for licenses. I might go along with a different rate for a fishing package, resident versus non resident. But if I'm reading the OP's post correctly, they were paying for a meal and the lodge owner charged residents is CA dollars, and US resident in US dollars. Now that would pi** me off! I was at a Canadian lodge that charged in US dollars, and when you bought an item in the lodge store, they took US dollars and gave change in CA dollars. Needless to say I wouldn't go back there."
4955441,Obabikon,2016-06-28 17:56:00,2370,"They might be getting a discount when compared to what was being charged 3 years ago, however, they pay the exact same as your Canadian guests, so there's no discount. The entire point of this is that resorts need to either charge in US or charge in Canadian... or do a fair exchange rate. Anything else is gaming the system."
4955481,3M TA3,2016-06-28 18:36:00,2846,That sums it up nicely. Thanks
4954089,kcguy68,2016-06-28 08:26:00,51,"I think this is an interesting topic. When we make our trips North, we have a good idea as to how much we are going to spend for the week. I've never given much thought to what we may be paying as opposed to what Canadians may be paying. I think if I were to find out, that they were given a discount, it really wouldn't change things. That small discrepancy is not going to have an impact on how much I enjoy being on the water, catching fish, and spending quality time with my friends."
4954233,3M TA3,2016-06-28 09:31:00,2846,"On one of my Canadian get-a-ways there are 3 of us from the US and 3 from Ontario. If the lodge charges each of us differently because of where we are from than I am not staying. Period. I suppose for some of you this doesn't matter but for me it does. Say two of you are from the US, get the same service, stay in the same cabin. Your friend looks better than you so he always gets a 25% discount. You pay $1000 and he pays $750. Are you OK with that? Knowing this up front, I won't be staying there, even if I'm the better looking dude:-)"
4954265,v-bay gord,2016-06-28 09:34:00,3168,"Yes, but if your Canadian friend comes down to visit you he will end up paying 25% more for everything than you. To your main point, yes, obviously Canadians are better looking........"

You still fly on the airplane, despite different rates being charged to different people.Would you rather your Canadian friends pay $1000, because that is what you are saying, if $1000 is the regular rate. I would be more likely to go if some of my group was getting a discount.The way we agree to price our trips is the entire bill is split amongst the participants so it would, in our case, be a discount for everyone. We split too many hairs in our life and sometimes end up punishing ourselves in the process.Frank"

4954409,Golden Eagle,2016-06-28 10:31:00,2642,How has the camp owner handled pricing when Canadian dollar is stronger than US? Other owners have been doing the same for a number of years and it hasn't posed a problem for me.
4954425,Shellback,2016-06-28 10:33:00,8083,"Not sure about Canadians paying 25% more. I spend about 4 to 5 weeks a year in eastern Ontario. So many things are much more expensive in Canada. Gas, booze, fishing gear and lots and lots of other goods can be had in the US for a 25% savings. Saw an Offshore planer board in Canadian tire, $59.95. Frank's Outdoors in MI sells a pair for $69.95. I recently bought a Weber gas grille for a friend's cottage in Canada. $400 in the US, $600 in Canada plus the 11% or 12% tax. I did buy it in Canada to save any trouble bringing it across. Sure a couple years back the Canadians were enjoying a sweet exchange rate, but overall I think goods can still be cheaper in the US for them. Well except when the tax man gets you bringing them home. As an outsider, I see the biggest problem for the Canadian consumer is lack of competition. Here in the US every business is out to steal the others. I guess a good example is the lodge in question using the reasoning that he's losing Canadian customer to US resorts using par."
4954433,BreezyPoint,2016-06-28 10:43:00,1581,You can charge them whatever you like. Just make sure they only pay what was agreed upon. I once stayed with a Russian in a Russian hotel. They charged a different rate for the Russian. Clearly stated when I booked the hotel.Frank

Truly."
4953417,LOWSKEETER44,2016-06-27 20:51:00,3,"Fished a major resort in Canada this past week with some Canadian buddies. It is a Canadian Resort that states all prices are quoted in U.S. dollars. After our meal my Canandian friends paid in Canadian cash and credit card and I paid in US credit card. My card was charged in U.S. dollars but the Canadians paid in Canadian dollars. Spoke to the owner and he said yes he is letting the Canadians buy goods, meals and rooms at par with the U.S. while there is clearly a .23 cents different in exchange rate, to the U.S. dollar advantage. He said he had to do this to compete against U.S. resorts that were accepting the Canandian dollar at par as they were attracting his clientele. I'm calling (not so fast) as I think he is just taking advantage of the American exchange rate. looking for other opinions on this marketing ploy by this resort. He acutally has two different credit card machines as well. One labeled Cannadian and the other American....."
4953449,3M TA3,2016-06-27 21:29:00,2846,"Very Strange. I use my American issued Credit Card in Canada and pay in 'Canadian funds, funds that are converted to American Funds by the Credit Card Company. I use my American issued Credit Card in America and get charged American funds. Go figure. Sounds to me your Lodge owner is out fishing for 'Suckers and has caught a few from the sounds of it. I'd be looking for a new lodge and I'd be paying the same as the 'Canadians. What difference does it make where you're from? If you had Canadian Dollars only what would you pay? Help us all out here and name this lodge so that we can all make an educated decision about staying with someone who wants to discriminate about the color of my money. Reminds me of a scumbag I met in Windsor."

I bought $200 of fuel at a marina and it was converted to ~$140 in American as well as every other Canadian place I went to. If he truly is quoting all rates in American dollars then the Canadians are getting a great break. The funny part is I believe he caters to primarily Americans. I'm sure all his suppliers and banking is Canadian. So he's hitting a home run. I don't feel comfortable on giving out the name but it's on lake of the woods and there are three different facilities. I'm just a bit peeved by the whole set up and so was my Canadian buddies. (And they are the ones who got the deal supposedly) But I believe you should be able to figure this Guy out, if you fish LOW. He is the biggest operator. One of the facilities is on property with boat access only, from his two main lodges just north of Sioux Narrows.

I also charge in USD's, but if I were to have a group of Canadians wanting to pay in Canadian money... I would personally convert it. I do give discounts, but those are usually to families or father/son trips. As a father of 3, I get how expensive it becomes to take everyone somewhere. So, those are the people I feel most comfortable giving the discounts to. As a business owner, I think its up to him who he gives discounts to. However, its always a fine line. It would be bad to upset your paying customers because you gave a discount to someone else."

I know of many lodges that offer discounts to father/sons, father/daughters or families. As you mentioned, it gives a break to families that might not otherwise fish together. Such discounts also promote a noble tradition of enjoying the great outdoors - something that is largely disappearing in today's high-tech and fast-paced society. There have been instances when I felt as though I was being taken advantage of when fishing in NW Ontario. When this happens, I try hard to not be taken advantage of again. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

The man can choose as he pleases. but I think the customer deserves to know up front about what dollar is accepted by their residence.

4953953,LOW1,2016-06-28 07:36:00,2828,As long as you received what you were told you would get for the price that you agreed to pay it's hard for me to see why you would be bothered by this.No different than if the resort owner gave out a few 25% off coupons and you didn't get one but some Canadian friends did.Or think of it as an extension of the Canadian fishing regulation which allows Canadian residents in border waters to keep more fish than nonresidents.Interesting observations about the state of the resort business on LOTW. I have always thought of resorts as farms and if you have a long time family farm with low debt you always seem to do fine but if you bought your land at a market peak you always seem to have difficulties.If I was in the market to buy a resort in Canada now might be the time to do it.
