Used tubes and rapalas for the smallies, jigs for walleye, most fish 20 fow or less. Don't know how well that pattern will hold as the water warms but I would count on the eyes continuing to move west."

We fished almost exclusively for smallmouth and they were scattered in shallow water rocks but not hot and heavy like we had two years ago in early June. It seems everyone there except for me fished ""the narrows"" every day with minnows or leeches. I just felt there was too much water to explore and didn't want to fish one spot all week. Based on the bucket in the cleaning station there was no lack of walleye being caught despite the weather. A friend of mine went the following week and instead of cold they had hot weather with bluebird skies. They caught walleye and smallmouth but he said fishing was on the slow side. It is an awesome fishery based on past trips and I bet you will do well and have a good time. My guess is that my report won't help much because the weather has probably changed several times since then as it always seems to in Canada. I hope you have a great trip!"
