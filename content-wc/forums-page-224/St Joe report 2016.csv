Our 6th guy knew a year ago that there was a military exercise scheduled that he couldn't miss. About a week before our trip he emailed that there was a 50% chance that he could get out early and come Monday. As the week went on the likelihood increased until we left on Friday with the plan that unless we heard otherwise, we would meet him at the landing on Sunday evening. So, Saturday morning 5 of us boated in 25 miles, fished Saturday and Sunday, and then two of us headed back to the landing and retrieved our 6th guy. He was glad to be back in Canada and we were happy to pick him up. This year's trip was 5 regulars and a new guy who proved to be a fun addition. The weather was the usual mix for a week in Ontario. The wind varied from windy to very windy. The wind determined where we could fish on at least 4 of the 7 days. Fortunately, it subsided to make the trip in Sat., the round trip Sun. and the trip out on Sat. good. One day was warm and sunny, but the rest ranged from occasional nuisance rain to downpours with huge raindrops. Temps ranged from shirt sleeve fishing to waking up to 44 degrees and building a fire in the cabin stove for the first time. Weather never forced us off the lake, however. Even the hard rains didn't have lightning, except one evening around supper time when a boom of thunder shook the cabin and had to have been pretty close. When we arrived at Winoga on Friday evening Dick said the mayfly hatch was pretty strong and we might want to get some crawlers. I was reluctant but got a 1/2 flat. We've never used crawlers before. Dick was right, however, and the mayfly hatch was going strong. I didn't experiment much without crawlers, but once I got the first walleye with a crawler just kept on using them. The group before us left a bunch of crawlers and we used them all week and left our crawlers for the next group. Fishing was slow by St. Joe standards (it'd be terrific at home). We did find a new rocky flat in the middle of the lake that topped out at about 4 feet and produced our best fishing for the week. I had a rocky point that produced a bunch of fish twice but was hard to fish in the strong winds. Other than that most of the fish were scattered. As usual we got fish anywhere from 4-30 feet with most being in the 8-12 foot range. The walleyes seemed bigger and fatter this year with the exception being the few small fish that came from 30 feet. The biggest fish for the week were 25"" walleye and 39"" northern, both caught by hewhocookstomuch. Hewhocookstomuch also got a double with a northern latching onto a small walleye and getting both in the net. Glenn had a huge northern trolling with spoons that I saw twice before it managed to break the 6# mono. It was in an area that has produced big northerns in the past so we always troll it or cast spoons at least once or twice per trip. There were some mid-30's northerns that were very fat, also. Walleyes were mostly in the 17-19"" range. Animal sightings were a couple moose and bear on the way up, a caribou, moose and otter out on the lake and the usual assortment of eagles, gulls and pelicans. Then there's the grouse I hit on the way back, sorry about that, Ontario. The guys behind us were just commenting that they hadn't seen any wildlife on the way back when the driver said ""Look, there's a grouse"" and boom...feathers were flying. All in all a pretty good trip. There could have been more fish, but the ones we got were good sized. We could have had better weather, but it was never so bad we couldn't fish. It was a good group with everyone pitching in. There were no rocks hit or other boat mishaps and no one got hurt. I could have won more cribbage games, but had fun trying. Looking forward to next year already."

You could take any of our guys our yours, mix them up and the composition of the group would probably change very little!I'm beginning to think that we are all clones.................... of old guys. I really enjoy looking at other groups pictures. We all seem to thrive on the same thing. Thanks for the report.Pooch"

4965233,pjshorthorn,2016-07-03 17:54:00,5654,Nice report ! It sounds like your group made the best of the weather and caught some solid fish. I do appreciate the generous offer to join you fellas on your trip. I was very humbled by the offer. I'm especially glad to hear that your 6th man was able to make the trip. He is invested in the group based on his effort to get there . One doesn't find group members that committed very often. PjShorthorn
