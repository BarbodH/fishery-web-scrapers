Where the Arm REALLY necks down abd the big bay on the left offers VERY deep depths. Perhaps another 1/2 mile or so down the Arm is a set of 3 Islands. I've caught Trout mostly around the middle Island of the 3. I havn't been to Minnitaki in a while, but, I'm sure the same oppertunities are present day. Gr8 luck to all!!!!!!!! What ah fishery EH!!!!!!!!! J"
4940513,Guest,2016-06-20 21:26:00,0,"Any recent reports from Minnitaki? Heading up there Fri 24 June. Will post my own trip report when I get back. We stay at Timber Edge on Butterfly Lake, how was the water level in the channel goin out into Lyons Bay?"
4944025,smbrickner,2016-06-22 12:51:00,276,"You can get through the channel on plane, I did all week. Just don't corner too wide or you will do some dredging.Majority of our fish were caught in 8ish feet of water on leeches. Did ok on crawler harnesses and never touched a minnow. Did really well by the Red Pine on a rainy day."
4966401,Guest,2016-07-04 13:24:00,0,"RSH8 responds: Got back from Minnitaki 2 July. Fish were still shallow 7 to 10 ft. A number of fish were suspended at 10 ft in 15 to 30 ft of water. No idea what type of fish the suspended one were, we tried but did not catch a single one of them. Redpine was the exception, the walleyes were on the bottom in 17 to 20 ft there, all slotters or overs as usual. The eyes at Redpine would only hit minnows, crawlers were better everywhere else we tried. Weed growth was very odd, places that usually have tall plumes of cabbage weed, like the weed bed by the houses on Butterfly, had only scrawny weeds on the bottom. BTW the Willinks, the new owners at Timber Edge, treated us very well. Kevin and Diana Lillie even came by for a night."
4894281,walleye/musky,2016-06-02 20:34:00,47,wondering if anyone has any info on good walleye spots never been there before
4894377,prov1800,2016-06-02 21:12:00,5010,I would suggest hiring a guide becworth it.i know a couple there.might have a day.cheaper than taking a lower unit out. Colin gose ben beatty both work at moosehorn lodge.
4895161,tv4fish,2016-06-03 07:33:00,2694,"A lot of times you will find walleyes on the south end (top) of the ""chutes"" - just off to the east and west sides (in the more quiet water)."
4903673,smbrickner,2016-06-06 08:16:00,276,"I'm leaving Friday night to head up. The only thing I have heard so far is that the lake is about a foot below full. Which is good because we stay on Butterfly and if waters low getting through the channel is a b*tch.The sanctuaries open up on Wednesday while we are there. Before that I am sure I will spend most of my time in Troutfish. May make a run to the chutes and frog rapids, but that is a LONG haul from butterfly."
4905049,rockape,2016-06-06 13:35:00,215,"Tons of great spots on Minnitaki. You might be there when the sanctuaries open up, which can be a fish every cast. Most are smaller in size, but the action is amazing. We have had luck on some of the deepwater humps too where it comes up to like 20 feet from 100 feet. Depends on water temps though. Best of luck to you. It is a great system to fish."
4906689,Guest,2016-06-06 20:34:00,0,How do you get into Minnitaki from Butterfly at all if the water is a foot low? Tilit your engine up and set your trolling motor to run very shallow to pull through the shallowest sections of the channel?
4907297,smbrickner,2016-06-07 06:52:00,276,"A foot down from full is ok, the channel won't be a problem. I won't be able to go through on plane like I usually do but that's ok.A number of years ago we had to use a different launch or have the camp owner pull us through with a mud motor.Just idle through with the motor up and I will be fine."
4909545,Guest,2016-06-07 20:52:00,0,Thanks that's reassuring.
4909593,scar,2016-06-07 21:07:00,196,If you are willing to share where do you fish in Troutfish or what do you look for in there. Have fished the lake for 10 years and always drive past but never went in. I am going up on Sunday for a week. Red Lund Explorer with windshield and black Merc.
4910217,smbrickner,2016-06-08 07:43:00,276,"I usually just troll harnesses along the wind blown shorelines until I find the right depth. Seems to me if you can find the right depth with some sort of bottom transition, rock to sand with weeds, then you find the fish. But I'm no expert.I will be in a red Lund Pro Guide with a black merc and a red Talon.I am also going to dedicate a day to lake trout this year if anyone has any tips."
