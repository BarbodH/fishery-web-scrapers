4955601,prov1800,2016-06-28 19:29:00,5010,Thx breezy i just tell it like i see it.there all great lakes.iam glad i get to spend time time on them.
4957033,v-bay gord,2016-06-29 15:43:00,3168,"I agree with pretty much everything you say although my 4 word tongue in cheek response hardly qualifies as self promotion. I'll just point out that if the only criteria for a great fishing experience was size and quantity of walleye then we would all be fishing Lake Erie. The question posed by the OP was not about average size, or quantity, but a chance at walleye over 30 inches. Not sure if LS is the best in that regard......but you've been fishing it for ten years....what's your opinion?"
4957121,prov1800,2016-06-29 16:56:00,5010,"Like i said in my post. It would be tough to come up with a 30""on lac suel NOW.it used to be a common ocurance 10-13 years ago.now the chances are much better on most of the other lakes in the area.eagle, clay, cedar, cliffand wabaskang would all stand a better chance.but jd just rather go fishing at any lake and just enjoy the day and really couldnt care less about size."
4959761,walleye/musky,2016-06-30 20:11:00,47,i agree guys we are fortunate in north western ontario i fish lac seul cause i live in ear falls but i would love to fish eagle for muskies just gotta find some time and some pointers where to start. i fish cedar for muskies and cliff for muskies and trout I'm like 'prov1800' just happy to be out fishing
4959793,prov1800,2016-06-30 20:25:00,5010,Launch in vermilion bay and work both sides of the dock about a 100-150 ft from dock.great weed bed.good start.
4960217,396ranger,2016-07-01 06:34:00,105,"Will be heading up Saturday to eagle lake. I've been going to eagle for 10+yrs and started with a guy trip for opener than switched to a cousin trip June-July and now my family around June -July. Opener was fun but the weather can be ruff and we would catch lots of fish (really miss that trip). Now for June -July it is better weater but mayfly hatch can screw thing up. We stay out of pine beach lodge and fish around that area. I have cought bigger walleye's above the slot a few times, a few in it, and a lot under. Which tells me the lake is producing fish so a chance at a big walleye is their just need to find the correct water. I grab a lodge board with the slot marks so I don't have to rember all the slot numbers so sorry for not giving exact measurements. I've been taking my boat up for the past 5 trips and starting to figure out some structure. Hard to do with only one week a year. I would suggest trying eagle what is the worst that will happen you catch a walleye."
4960745,Duflebag,2016-07-01 09:08:00,218,"I have fished both Lac Seul and Eagle for over thirty years now. I normally go to Lac Seul for walleye fishing as I think the numbers and average size is better on Lac Seul on average over many days. However, when one of my party wants to specifically fish for a thirty inch walleye we always go to Eagle. There are certain spots on Eagle where your chances of catching a thirty inch fish are better than anywhere else. I agree completely with Gord on this point."
4962345,prov1800,2016-07-01 21:24:00,5010,"Canada day turned out to have some nice weather.took the wife out on eagle today for some muskie fishing.got outca little late 9:30.fished 5 spots and we raised 4 fish.one brute but no hook ups.decided to fish for some walleyes for supper.the first couple of dozen fish were all slot sized.Nice problem to have.changd spots and ended up finding some 15-17""fish mixed with some more slots.bigger fish definatly shallower and smaller fish deeper.still catching slot fish in areas i have been catching them for the last month.get to go tomorrow again for some muskies in the morning first.will go little earlier then hit some walleyes on way back.next week i guide on lac suel.looking forward to that."
4966361,Northpoint,2016-07-04 12:48:00,38,We have been blessed to have a great guide and I have been with him when he caught two 30s and lots of 29's. I have yet to get the 30 but have got a few 29's and lots of 28's. Thanks for all the replies. We hope to give Eagle a try soon.
4946217,Northpoint,2016-06-23 14:47:00,38,"We have fished with some great guides on LS for about the last 10 years and generally found the fishing for walleye to be excellent. However, I want to keep a open mind for something that may be even better. Every year we see the signs for Eagle Lake and I thought I would ask if anyone has a basis to compare the two for walleye only. We love those 23+ walleye and are willing to catch fewer fish if the average is bigger. Muskie or northern are not considered. Thanks for any thoughts!!"
4946385,prov1800,2016-06-23 16:51:00,5010,"I guide on both lakes.mostly eagle and although we catch lots they tend to be 15-16"" average.we do catch slot fish through out the day (18-23"").but i always look forward to my lac suel trips as the fish definatly are bigger on average.but a shot at 30 plus inch fish on lac suel has dwindled over the last 10 years.where on eagle a 30-34""are a possibility. I have guided all week on eagle this week and most walleyes have been in the 17"" range.biggest so far 26.5""but i have tomorrow yet.lol."
4947361,Guest,2016-06-24 09:41:00,0,"Never Fished LS but have fished Eagle for last 13 years and never a shortage of over slot eyes and have been privileged to catch a 31 1/2"" in 2013 (also had a 29"" the same day). Last year 3 of us in the boat at 1:00pm on a sunny day had 3 fish on at the same time all over the slot, 25"", 26 1/2"", 29"" off a big rock marked with a milk jug marked by the resort owners. We have always had great luck fishing out of Temple Bay Lodge. 100 fish days are not a rarity nor BIG walleyes. Good luck."
4947489,Northpoint,2016-06-24 11:06:00,38,What time of year have you experienced your best luck with the bigger fish? We have 3 29s and lots of 26-28 on LS spread out over time. The majority of the bigger ones came in May Were you fishing with a guide? Jigs or lindy rigs or other? Thanks
4947673,v-bay gord,2016-06-24 12:21:00,3168,Eagle in 3 rounds with a knock-out.........
4947937,Guest,2016-06-24 14:56:00,0,"We have taken the Temple Bay Lodge bus out of central Wisconsin the last week of June for my years and the other guys I go with have 23 years. We leave on Tuesday on the bus and fish Wed, Thur, Fri & Sat, and come home Sunday. They provide a guide and shore lunch for one day, the other days we are on are own. A new group say want to hire for an extra day or so. After all our years together we are pretty much able to fish on our own. GPS is a must as there are so many hidden humps in this lake as we find new ones every year. All our fishing is jigs and minnows. Chartreuse with red eye and a little orange on belly have been hot the last couple years along with just plain lead jigs and minnows. Have tried worms and leeches with no where near the success of minnows. Lindy rigs have been tried but we always go back to jig and minnow.We leave this Tuesday the 28th at 6:00am. We have caught big fish with guides and by ourselves. I have posted before on websites that Eagle Lake fishing is spectacular and that taking the bus and having everything taken care of by TB is truly a vacation for me. Sit back fish and enjoy the 4 days. The lake is 60,000 acres and 400 miles of shoreline and I don't know how many islands, I have heard anywhere from 200 to 400 islands. Rock bars, mud flats, weed beds, bays and hidden bays are everywhere. We don't target northerns, muskies or small mouths but always manage to tangle with some while there. Once and awhile when we are full up the last night with Walleyes we will hunt for the jumbo perch to bring home. Anything else I can help you with let me know. The experienced guides on this lake know how good it is. Gord has posted a positive for Eagle out of his western basin area of Vermillion Bay and we fish the eastern basin. Many times we see few boats from other lodges during the week and usually not on our GPS spots. They all must have there own spots. Good Luck and make sure it's a fun trip."
4954289,Ricky Spanish,2016-06-28 09:58:00,1298,"I haven't been to LS for about five years now, but have been going 1-2x a year to Eagle since 2002. My wife and I took several day trips to LS from Temple Bay Lodge and definitely caught more fish on LS. I recall a day where we caught 200 between the three of us in about six hours. From what others have posted, it appears that the numbers out of LS are down recently. We were at TBL 5/25 - 5/30 and again 6/16 - 6/25 this year and the fishing seems to get better on Eagle every year, both in numbers and size. We bring our own boat after about six years of being guided the whole week. I caught my personal best walleye, 30.5"", throwing a regular bulldawg for muskies last week. A half hour later I caught my best pike, 42"", on a jig/minnow. The muskies do not seem to like me at all. Honestly, though, I think you can't go wrong with either lake."
4954721,Guest,2016-06-28 12:23:00,0,"Fished them both, first eagle, for at least five years, good fishing, then went to LS, been fishing LS for 10 years and really NO PLACE is as good as LS, it is a fish factory. Numbers aren't down and I don't think people who own camps on eagle or guide on eagle should be self promoting their lake( v-bay gord &prov1800) there is not another lake that even comes close to LS, I'll take Devils lake, ND over eagle any day!!"
4954785,BreezyPoint,2016-06-28 12:55:00,1581,"I would hardly classify prov1800, Gord (and Obibakon for that matter) as promoting their lakes. They seem to adhere pretty closely to forum rules. They do answer questions about fishing, but so do you and I. Prov posts about Lac Seul, Cedar and all of the lakes in the area."
4955073,PeteyK,2016-06-28 14:32:00,7,"Fished both lakes the past 10 years and it's not close. LS is a far better lake for walleyes in my opinion. Pike too for that matter. Eagle is a better lake if you are looking for Muskie in numbers. A few guides I have fished with say that LS may have a world record muskie in it though I guess that can be said about a lot of lakes. As far a competition, again LS is less populated with fewer lodges and more water. And when it's on, there are very few waters that are close to LS in sheer number of fish and bigger fish.When I first went to LS the lodge owner that I stayed with on Eagle called me and asked why I didn't renew for the next year and I told him that I was going to try Lac Suel and he said ""well I won't be seeing you again!"" He was right."
