My group has downsized our packages of salted minnows to comply with the 120 minnow/person limit. Has anyone recently taken salted minnows across the border at Fort Frances? If so, what was your experience at the border? Many thanks...."

4959169,Lovetofish,2016-06-30 14:32:00,458,It's a good thing they didn't check Fishoil when he crossed. He'd still be in jail. He was waaaay over his 120 salted minnow limit.
4959337,BreezyPoint,2016-06-30 15:52:00,1581,If you want an easy crossing just follow the rules. Unfortunately thawing and refreezing the salties turned them to mush. We jettisoned them early in the trip. Too bad because I have had really good luck on the salties.Frank
4959393,Golden Eagle,2016-06-30 16:12:00,2642,Adding a bit of Borax might help. I dry mine in the sun before packaging and they last a long time without being frozen. Leave them in the sun too long and they become too stiff.
4960593,mwh624,2016-07-01 08:34:00,183,"The key is to not freeze them. Salt them and keep them cool in the fridge, they will last awhile."
4961545,Bill Krejca,2016-07-01 15:09:00,6107,"I have some in the frig which have never been frozen from last fall. They appear to be questionably OK. Next make pizza night, I'll check them out. Bill"
