4961561,Bstar,2016-07-01 15:14:00,564,You might want to check out Slate Falls Outpost. You can do a five day trip to their Miniss Lake outposts for $990 after July 1. $125 for each additional day. We are booked to go to their Miniss East outpost for six days in mid Aug. of next year. This will be our 1st trip with Slate Falls. It looks like their cabins and equipment are top notch. They are highly recommended by posters on this forum. www.slatefallsoutposts.com
