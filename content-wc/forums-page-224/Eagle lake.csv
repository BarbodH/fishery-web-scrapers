I guess I don't understand why a US/Canada card is NOT preloaded ? Side note we hammered the Lake Trout in Clearwater yesterday"

Pj,we fished in 35'-52' around the little island,tried long lining with 3oz. weights but ended up doing better with downriggers so we knew exactly how deep we were. I sure that wooden boat of gord would have no problems getting back that"
