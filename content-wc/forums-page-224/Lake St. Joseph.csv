Agree with you that the lake produces real numbers of Walleye and we never had a bad day of fishing. With that being said, our group always caught larger Walleyes on Lac Seul. Wouldn't mind going back, but a few of our guys point out that Lake St Joe is a few hours of extra driving time versus where we now go on Lac Seul. Yes, you will likely catch more fish on Lake St Joe, but the extra travel time and gas expense is not something we want to take on at this time. Still, you have to like how remote the lake is and the sheer numbers of Walleyes."

On the way up, we got a late start and wound up in Chicago rush hour traffic. That didn't help. As you said, the remoteness is one of the cool features. You can fish all day and not see another boat. Anyway, just a trade-off, I guess. I think either lake is a good choice"
