4958777,sauvain,2016-06-30 11:11:00,63,I have done numerous fly-in's but have never had rain on the day of going in or coming out. What is the general rule for outfitters...rain means no fly? Just curious...

To fly VFR, weather has to be above minimums as to height of ceiling above ground level, miles of visibility, etc., etc. So, you can fly in the rain if all the VFR minimums are meet. Other than getting wet while loading your gear, rain alone isn't a problem.(Disclaimer: it's been many years since my private license was active. )"
