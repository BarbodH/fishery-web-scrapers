4966561,Sportdog,2016-07-04 16:12:00,6735,"My first two trips to fish in Ontario I had an emergency kit that contained fire starter, signaling devices, first aid kit, spare prop, tools, water purifying tabs, etc. etc. and we also left our planned itinerary in the cabin along with a hand held CB radio with our channel of choice already on. I know others sometimes let the camp owners know where they will be. The past two years I left the radio and itinerary note out of the mix as two years ago it was a river system with only a couple small lakes in the mix so being found would be pretty easy. I'm thinking that is a mistake as this year my buddy and I were gone for so long on the large lake that it concerned some of the others in camp. So do you do anything to insure your safety, not counting normal boating safety gear? Am I concerned about nothing? What do you think?"
4966577,rnnonmt,2016-07-04 16:29:00,992,I carry the same stuff but include a HH GPS. All good recommendations you have there. What fire starter do you have. I have a magnesium stick. Pretty cool stuff. I had to practice with it for a while before I got good at it. Made my younger boys learn how to use it as well.
4966601,Bigredmf,2016-07-04 16:36:00,129,We were on Lac Doda in QC a number of years ago.It's a pretty big piece of water.Really beat up camp with old beat up motorsWe got back to camp and the other boat didn't show up. Once it got dark we went looking for them and they launched a flare from the middle of the lake.Same trip we lost a prop even though we didn't hit anything and got lucky when a passing boat dragged us back to campWe were no way as well prepared as you and it could have been a cold dark night wAiting for help.Best to have and not need.Be safe!RedSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

You are always within reach of help if you need it. There is a help button if you are in trouble/hurt that contacts the authorities and it has text capabilities that can go to e-mail, cell phone, or another inreach if you just want to send a message of any sort. There are various packages available, cheap insurance in case you run into trouble, if I did not always have a Sat phone on board I would have one."
4966641,Sportdog,2016-07-04 17:25:00,6735,"Fire starter in my dry box kit is made of of several butane lighters, a Zippo lighter, fire starting gel, waxed lint, matches, and those fireplace starter sticks. I figure something in that combination should work, not to mention ""boy scout juice"" in my boat portable tank......unless I ran out of gas. I also have a 8 x 12 foot fairly heavy painters plastic drop cloth to shed rain if needed. It's surprising how much important stuff I have in that dry box that is about the size of an ammo can."
4966713,Nimstug,2016-07-04 17:59:00,2605,"In the triangular bow compartment I keep a couple shiney reflective blankets, energy bars, fire starting materials which include wax soaked rolled strips of newspaper. Our trips are in the fall so we already have extra top layers. One of the layers is a hooded sweatshirt. Elsewhere in the boat but not exclusively for emergency are a chart of the area we are fishing, handheld gps, flashlight, spare AA batteries, about 25' of rope, water, crackers- the usual boat snacks, and rain wear. Life jackets can we be worn under an outer layer to help stay warm. The best source of firewood is from the top of a beaver lodge. I have an anchor in the boat but we have never used it for any reason on our trips north. I'm thinking of taking it out of the and using that space for a spare prop. Thoughts? NimstugMany men go fishing all their lives without knowing it is not fish they are after. -Thoreau"
4966721,rnnonmt,2016-07-04 18:06:00,992,Nimstug - Definitely carry a spare prop if you travel may miles away from camp in your boat....even if it is a cheap steel prop plus a spare hub/nut kit.

4968833,mms3rd,2016-07-05 16:08:00,148,I have my wife in the front of the boat and hope she can swim for help in case of disaster.
