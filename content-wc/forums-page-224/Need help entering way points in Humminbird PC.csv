When I do, they are in this format: N49째16.862' W094째21.676' The owner of a lodge I'll be staying at provided their Long/Lat and I want to create a new waypoint. The format they provided is like this: 49.2778 N and 94.3673 W I can't seem to get HB PC to accept the long/lat in the format she provided. To confuse me even further, I can see the lodge marked on Google Earth and when I check the properties, it shows me this long/lat: 49째16'40.38""N 94째22'1.12""W, but I can't get HB PC to accept that format either. Anybody know what I should be entering to create this waypoint, for either the long/lat that the owner provided or the one shown on Goggle Earth?"

I see there's a difference between long/lat and GPS coordinates, and even then there are different long/lat formats. Like I said, I don't know a lot about longitude and latitude, but I'm learning."
