4960753,SterlingArcher,2016-07-01 09:19:00,92,"As always, Lake Savant delivered. 10 guys this trip, including four newbies (two adults and two kids). Fish were in different spots - deeper water - than usual for this time of year, but with a bit of poking around we were able to hammer them just like always. Best year ever for numbers of pike, although we didn't get any giants. Borderline ridiculous numbers of 30-34"" gators, with a couple of 40"" class fish getting off near the boat (hooked on light walleye gear). Great numbers of eaters (of course) and probably the second-best year for our group for larger (24-26"") fish. If it had been a grown-ups only trip and we had spent more time making longer runs to the big fish spots, I have no doubt it would have been the best trip ever for big fish, but kiddos have a limited appetite for long runs in those slow little boats. A couple of 27 inchers were the big eyes of this trip, and that's a pretty good fish for Savant. Cliff (of Cliff and Roma's) says in the decades he has been running the camp, he has only seen two or three legit 30 inchers, so when you get around 27"" that's doing well. 1/4 oz glow-white jig was the ticket for walleyes. We caught them everywhere from 2' to 45' of water, but the best action was in 16-22' most days. They also bit pink and gold pretty well, but as always, glow white was the king. Pike were crazy active. Best two lures were a blue & chrome doctor spoon and a big firetiger stickbait (don't know the make). We caught em both casting and trolling, but trolling - fast - was better by far. Has a couple of really fun boatside strikes figure-eighting followers. Always fun. And of course we had several heartstopper where big pike came up and clamped onto a hooked walleye boatside. Always fun to see. One bonus whitefish, which the hosts smoked for us, rounded out the fun. As always, the Sawyer clan were incomparably gracious and helpful hosts. Best customer service you will find anywhere, and what really sets Cliff & Roma's/Cat Track apart from most other Canadian lodges. We have already booked next year's trip, heading up June 24 2017. Can't wait to get back."
4960785,Lovetofish,2016-07-01 09:35:00,458,How was the water level? I'll be just north of there in two weeks.
4961257,Pooch,2016-07-01 12:42:00,4619,"Thanks for the report. ""Bobo"" and I will be on Savant in two weeks, but at Wildewood. ""Elway"" will also be in camp with his family same time.I have not seen Cliff for two years since he kind of retired. Used to stop and visit him when we saw him on the lake. Always a great guy. I still consider him King of Savant.""Love to fish"", which camp are you staying at? Sounds like we might be there the same time. Would be nice to say hello. I've met several guys here on WC and now routinely chat and on occasion fish with them. Website has been good to many of us.""Pooch"""
4961297,Lovetofish,2016-07-01 12:52:00,458,"Not fishing Savant Pooch. Savant flows north into a couple of the lakes we fish, Mc Crea and East Pashkokogan. Just wondering what the water level was on Savant. We stay at North Albany Lodge about 30 miles up the road."
4961777,elway12,2016-07-01 16:27:00,335,A big thanks for the report from me too. Can't wait to drop a line in Savant! Did anyone in your group or others up there try for/or catch any Lakers of note?
4962913,Pooch,2016-07-02 10:21:00,4619,"Lake Trout huh, Elway?! (Blue jig and sucker minnow...... but don't tell anyone else)Will be seeing you guys in two weeks. Appreciate it if you leave a few for Bobo and me.Pooch"
4963121,Jigs88,2016-07-02 12:36:00,1,"Going to wildewood end of July. Curious on big pike? This will be our second trip up and have had no problem finding walleyes, but pike we struggled with. I want to target pike this trip and would really appreciate any tips ect. Thanks Jigs"
4968033,SterlingArcher,2016-07-05 11:19:00,92,"Water level seemed down a tad when we were there, but not massively so. Not to the point where it affected navigation or ability to access any of our spots. Lake Trout bite was better at the south hole than over at the wall, from what I heard. It was pretty breezy most of our time there, so we didn't try for lakers much...just a couple of hours on one afternoon. One group from Cat Track went to the south hole and brought back some really nice fish. Pike were VERY active...moreso than most years. Tons of 30-34"" fish, with 37"" being the biggest boated. I had follows from a couple of fish that would have pushed 40 but couldn't get them to bite. Firetiger stickbaits and spoons with silver or chrome in them worked the best. Lots and lots of good action even though no giants boated."
