4952465,ziggyzag,2016-06-27 10:33:00,125,"Windy Boys: We visited Abamasagi May 28th thru June 4th for the first time on this lake, we also used TLO and stayed at cabin #3 see our trip report here on walleye central. We also fished walleye mainly 90% with a little pike fishing. First I would say TLO did a very nice job with the Flights, accommodations, boats, motors, dock where all up to par and in most cases better than a lot of outpost we have visited in the past. Abamasagi is no doubt a walleye factory and you guys will surely fill your boats with fish. 1/4 oz. Pink jig heads with white 3' paddle tail minnows was our best producer but I believe other combination would work as well but this combo was working so well I did not switch up to often except for the last day when I tried to catch a fish on all the different combinations in my tackle box which produced fish on just about every one and I would only have a combo on for no more than two drifts over hot spots. I would definitely recommend this lake and Twin Lakes Outfitters to anyone headed up to Nakina. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me."
4964321,falconman,2016-07-03 10:28:00,12,We are heading up to Ankcorn in August using Twin Lakes Outfitters and was wondering if you used any live bait such as worms or minnows?
4964369,ziggyzag,2016-07-03 11:11:00,125,I did use 1/2 of a night crawler on jigs but some guys did not use any and still did well. For the cost of worms I would take some we never take minnows to expensive and pain in the you know in my opinion.
4964401,falconman,2016-07-03 11:38:00,12,"Good deal, thanks. I think Ill take some worms also ""just in case"". Once you fly in, there is no turning back for things I wish I had."

For us worms are a must as we use them on our jigs and slow death crawler set ups...8 guys, we go thru approx 1000 worms. This trip was maybe our best....each boat(4) hit the 100+ fish mark easily, every day.....crazy good fish this yr"
