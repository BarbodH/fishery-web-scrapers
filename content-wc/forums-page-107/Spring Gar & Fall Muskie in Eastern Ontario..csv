The thought of it back then was rather scary because as everyone knows, Northern Ontario's fishing is exceptional! But happy wife, happy life eh!?! Moving home what would come next? Pike and walleye fishing in the east pales by comparison to the north; Bay of Quinte pigs maybe the only exception. But being in the east actually opened up fishing to sooo many new species and waters that for the first couple years I was overwhelmed by options. As well, those options, the climate and ease of travel now allowed 365 days a year to fish. For springtime fun I found gar. For these past ten years more time than anyone has been spent chasing these awesomely unique fish. With summer's mostly consumed by northern travel for work and play, when fall arrives the gears began to switch to muskie. A great challenge, there are few fish if any that require more time and effort to consistently catch, and once you catch a biggun, you're ruined, you can't stop! Gotta make the best of it wherever the wind takes ya!
