6367054,billy weaver,2019-10-27 14:06:00,470,I happened to check the Sleepy Dog Camp's website and the pictures of Wabaskang and the water levels surprised me. The water is as high as I have seen in many years. At this time of year I would expect the level to carry over till spring.
6367132,JAY221,2019-10-27 19:13:00,877,"I saw those also. I would guess it is up at least three feet as it is lapping at the top of the dock cribbing. It could be as much as 4 feet up from mid July and Tom says the rain just keeps coming. It could be a problem if it turns to snow and continues coming down!! Later, Jay"
6367942,sheepman,2019-10-31 17:00:00,98,I saw those. WOW! never seen it that high! Lots of water makes the rock hazards less of a problem.
6367958,JAY221,2019-10-31 21:03:00,877,"Lots of NEW rock hazards that use to be up out of the water that are now under water!!!! Later, Jay"
6370754,ILScott,2019-11-13 19:15:00,139,I saw on Sleepy Dog Cabins facebook that the lake was up 34 inches. They have a picture of the portage into Wine that they took below the portage. Must have been an easy portage. Never have seen it that high.
6371152,WALI4VR,2019-11-15 14:45:00,68,"Is this lake as loaded with underwater rock hazards as you guys make it sound. Don't the camp, lodge, resort owners give maps as to where these below surface lower unit, transom, and Hull destroyers are located?"
6371156,WALI4VR,2019-11-15 14:59:00,68,"Maybe I should just stick with Eagle, Pipestone, low and a couple other ""safe"" waters!!"
6371236,ogilville,2019-11-16 05:29:00,262,"I have been going to Wabaskang since 1986. They do a good job of marking underwater hazards. Of course after all the years I know where most of them are anyway. With the water up that high there will be new hazards where a boat will be able to go that couldn't before. Depending on the water level I assume some of the new hazards will be marked next season. So, like usual some common sense and caution will go a long way in avoiding hitting them and damaging your boat and/or motor. I mean who isn't going to go fishing just because of some more water in the lake?"
6371280,Bill Krejca,2019-11-16 07:47:00,6107,"Generally, new hazards are created due to the previously noted above water level rocks becoming submerged. Normally, those above water do not get hit, and sometimes with high water get forgotten after ""being out of sight,out of mind"". Also, new folks to the area haven't been aware of them. Nothing like checking a good map before venturing forth. Bill"
