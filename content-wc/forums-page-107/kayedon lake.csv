1333427,Guest,2011-07-24 16:55:00,0,"bait was mainly mr. twister jig tails 3inch. did use 2 dozen crawlers to change the tactics one afternoon,it was like shooting fish in a barrel23 fish in about 30 drifts thru a current seam. my partners told me to quit using bait so iwent back to 1/4 oz jigs and brown tails and proceded to go 4 for 4. then they got mad and pulled anchor and moved us to another drift and put me in the back of the boat. We also trolled rapalas 'flo orange .' deep blue divers rap. dive tos. also same in purple. we were told going in that it was tough to get a limit.it was to finish our 4 fish limit we went thru about 60+ fish to get 5 under 18in on thur evening.that's tuff fishing .but enjoyable!! ready to go back.been fishing nakina area since 1979 . you are right it is adrive but my friends drove up to my place from richmond va. it's 22 hrs for me they have another 4 hrs.on that. that alone speaks for AWO!!! .. My group started out with 8 and3 have pasted on to a better fishing ground ."
