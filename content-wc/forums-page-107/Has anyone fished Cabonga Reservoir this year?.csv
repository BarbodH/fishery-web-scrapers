6371172,fishron,2019-11-15 15:51:00,317,I'm considering a trip to Cabonga next year. It has been a great lake to fish when they don't mess with the water level. I would appreciate a report on the lake. Thanks!
6371668,retire55,2019-11-17 09:32:00,1029,I took a look at the fish Quebec web site (https://forum.pecheqc.ca/) - its all in French. I read a very positive report about fishing at Pavillion Bark Lake (https://www.pavillonbarklake.com/en/) in the Cabonga Reservoir.
6371772,fishron,2019-11-17 18:06:00,317,"Thanks for the reply, Retire 55. I've never fished Bark Lake on the Cabonga. Several years we fished out of Deerhorn Lodge in the northwestern part of Cabonga and had some great trips. My first 30 inch walleye and 40 inch pike came on those trips. I know that section very well and when the level of the reservoir was stable could always find great walleye, pike and lake trout fishing. We also enjoyed taking our own boats. I may have taken my last fly-in in June 2019. It was very successful and a good one to finish with. I know you have taken the fly-in to Hebert and nothing tops that for walleye. My group is not as ""flexible"" as we once were and probably will fish Cabonga or out of Land o Lakes lodge in the future. If Cabonga has remained stable for several years, it may once again be a great fishery."
