From what I can see based on information online, this appears to be a numbers lake for walleye, but anything 20""+ is very hard to come by. Has anyone fished this recently that can confirm or deny?"

Overall impression was positive and I do believe spring would be worlds better fishing than I had in late September. (although September was okay)It's definitely a numbers walleye lake, and I doubt there's many surprises. Lots of 11/2-21/2 pound fish.If big pike are important I'd say go elsewhere.Camp was nice, there's two cabins on site with a deck separating them and a great view of the lake.Boats were okay, not great.No detailed story as of yet, but here's a 20 minute video of the trip:https://youtu.be/RxRj11WkXZg?t=1"
