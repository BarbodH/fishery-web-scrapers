6372388,hoppy63,2019-11-19 13:37:00,367,"We used Remi (AWO), in the past and know he had a place on Kag at one time and got rid of it when they pared down before retiring and Jason and Sue taking over. Now BFO has bought out Mattice on Kag. My question is which of the cabins on Kag is/are the ones run by Remi (AWO) in the past? Our group will be at Kag June 13 2020 although with a different outfitter this year!"
6372390,vteye3,2019-11-19 13:41:00,496,"They bought 6 camps previously owned by Mattice Lake Outfitters. If you check on MLO site, you can see where the camp is located on Kag."
6372396,hoppy63,2019-11-19 14:15:00,367,"Yes, I was at Kag this year with Mattice so I know the camp well. My question is which camp did Remi /AWO have before they sold it? There are several camps and a lodge here. I'm guessing it is the one with two cabins at south end of lake??"
6372450,Namegosikaa,2019-11-19 18:09:00,61,I believe the AWO kag camp is the camp at the north end at the Opichuan outflow now owned by seven lakes. I think they also took on the kapikotongwa lake camp at the same time.

6372568,hoppy63,2019-11-20 10:55:00,367,"Thanks for response. Not sure I like that location. We messed around up and down the river a few times, mostly exploring, and was a beautiful evening ride, but our success was limited. Maybe (probably) was operator error!! Does anyone have any experience in that river, good or bad?"
