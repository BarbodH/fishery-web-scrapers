Owner John Small and his wife Kim acquired the camp along with a handful of others a couple of years ago and have spent a considerable amount of time upgrading all of them including Studd - the camp was great! Really nice log cabin with a covered porch, new beds, new roof, new shower house, covered fish cleaning shack, new dock, new 9.9 motors, pretty much everything on that end was excellent. Studd had lain dormant and unfished for the most part for a number of years before John and his wife bought it, so we expected good fishing, and that's precisely what we got. This was one of the few trips I've been on where the focus was mostly walleye and we caught them almost at will using pretty much any method we wanted. Jigging plastics and blade baits, pulling crankbaits and bottom bouncers - it all worked. We tried to keep a rough tally and the number at the end of the week was 1800 fish. It would have been way way higher if my boat partner and I hadn't trolled as much as we did. (Jigging with light tackle produced fish non stop). Size-wise endless numbers of 18-22 inch fish with a couple dozen in the 24-26 inch range. My boat partner had a beastly walleye that I'm guessing was pushing 28 inches boatside before it got off. He also lost what was undoubtedly a gigantic pike trolling a deep diving crankbait. We caught tons of pike as well, but that was the only larger one we came in contact with. Studd isn't a massive body of water but there's more than enough water to keep you occupied. The camp is actually located on Little Studd which is connected via a navigable creek to Big Studd. From Big Studd you have access to three more unnamed lakes to the west via another navigable channel. It's a single cabin location so you've got it all to yourself which is nice.All in all it was a heck of a good trip and I was super impressed with our host John Small who's new to this outfitting business. I wouldn't hesitate to use them again.If you'd like to read the lengthy detailed report on the trip complete with photos and video you can see it right here:https://www.canadafishingguide.net/s...ye-wonderland/Cheers, Mike"

6375302,Mike Borger,2019-12-02 18:58:00,1554,Thanks Bill!
6375718,kona77,2019-12-04 11:48:00,236,Mike- Always enjoy your gator trips but I am really a walleye guy at heart so this was a great read for me.. Agree that blade baits can be a really great walleye bait and we always have some in our box. Shore lunches are always a highlight for our group and we also have decided to do more than one each trip.. Great that you could spend time with your lifelong friend and best wishes to him..

He wasn't able to join me last year as he had a huge set back with his health so it was great having him along this year.He just had an MRI done last week, and if the results are positive he's going to be joining me at Gangler's next summer along with his son. Am praying it happens."
