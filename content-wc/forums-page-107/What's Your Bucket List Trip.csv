6375036,bthomas3333,2019-12-01 15:45:00,465,"I have been very blessed to take a number of bucket list trips in the last few years. I am honestly embarrassed to list them all but health issues in my personal life have made me reevaluate priorities a bit so I continue to plan 2-3 trips for 2020 like Alaska, N SASK, and NWT. I guess my point is so many guys put SO much into a 'bucket list' trip that I worry maybe they are looking for perfection which is almost impossible on these trips. Even my best trip which was probably NWT TR had a few hiccups. For instance at one point I was so sick of my guide I want to drop him off at the nearest island and drive away. I still have the self guided background that makes fishing with guides a challenge. Just be careful to be very honest with yourself about what you want. Think about accommodations, types of fishing, size and quantity, and overall experience before you put all your eggs in one expensive - once in a lifetime trip. Make sure that for you maybe you'd just prefer to take 2/3 trips in a season to a well known lake and experience it in a different seasons??? If you still want to sign up for a very expensive trip realize that sometimes the wind still blows and the fishing sucks and maybe the water pump goes out. Paying big bucks does not guarantee anything. I guess I have seen a LOT of guys disappointed at these 4-5k a week places. They definitely do a great job 95% of the time but the nature of the beast still says it is very difficult to deliver a perfect trip. Sorry to be a downer. I have just seen more than a few disappointed guys at fantastic lodges who just put too many eggs in one 3/4/7 day trip. Brett"
6375044,Mike Borger,2019-12-01 16:10:00,1554,"Bang on Brett. As someone who's been on an awful lot of these bucket list type trips I can't tell you the number of times I've seen people disappointed because of grossly overblown expectations. There's always this huge build up especially among people who do these types of trips rarely, then when things don't go exactly right they get bent out of shape.I still believe that with proper planning and the correct choice you can have an incredible trip, if I didn't I'd be undermining everything that I do. But I always caution people to temper their expectations, take joy in simply being there, and don't sweat the small stuff.To answer the question, I'm a paddler at heart and for 20 years now I've had a 2 month route mapped out in western Labrador. If I could ever swing it that would be my dream trip. I'd love to do one more lengthy expedition before age catches up with me."

I would do it in late May through June probably for five weeks. Just think of the fishing to be had between Red Lake and Eagle Lake. It would be hard to plan with the great number of choices. I would have a couple of my good fishing buddies (son and grandson) with me. Fish when we wanted to fish, rest when we wanted to rest and just take it easy."

6377316,bthomas3333,2019-12-12 08:50:00,465,You severely misjudged Ted here. He owns and operates a lodge that I have fished 6 times so I have seen the guy in action and feel like he is a friend. What I have seen is a guy that is up at 6a and shuts the main lodge at 10p or 11p 7 days a week. He regularly takes his guests out on his own time for the evening walleye fishing in his boat and helps them catch more fish. He also offers an open bar every night with top shelf booze. All of this while offering a fantastic lodge experience and probably not exactly getting rich. 6 months of 112 hr weeks is def worth a few weeks of fly fishing.If his way of recharging is spending a week or two fighting the wind to catch a big trout in SA good for him.Brett

As mentioned, these trips are not for the faint of heart. There are no bounds about what is said or done throughout the week.....it can be brutal after making one small mistake or just saying something that opens up the slightest opportunity to razz a person incessantly , just like when growing up when we were kids. If one doesn’t bring their big boy pants with them, someone is going home with a severe case of butt hurt -it is.

6376232,Guest,2019-12-06 18:15:00,0,Lots of good responses. One thing I'd add is that for these expensive AK fly-in lodge trips that have daily fly outs is to make sure that the lodge has good homewater as weather or equipment issues may impede flying out. A money no object trip would be Tropic Star Lodge in Panama. Another would be king salmon/steelhead fishing in Pa

6376832,Fisherman Ted,2019-12-10 13:27:00,461,"Patagonia is absolutely epic. Gone there the last 2 seasons for 17 days each trip. The way to describe it is like its Montana was 200 years ago. Scenery is stunning. Dirt roads. Gouchos. Sheep. Rolling hills. Glaciers that are mezmorizing. Fishing under a glacier as its clear water rips down from the melting ice and under your feet as you wade the lake is unreal. The glaciers are 100s of feet deep and just ginormous. The lakes are beautiful. Crystal clear and I mean like diamonds. On a clear day you can see 80 feet straight down. The rivers and streams are like nothing you have ever seen. Stalking BIG browns holding in a stream no wider than a picnic table. Accuracy is critical. With strong winds known for that part of the world your fly fishing expertise will be put to the test. I fished with master fly-fishermen and hosts from fishing shows and some days we were all on our knees. By the end of our trip I was throwing flies I had no business doing 3 weeks earlier. The browns are big. Many in the high 20 inches. Rainbows too. And last year I caught a 20 lb brown, on a 6 wt fly-rod. 18 minutes to bring it in. I will never do that again in my lifetime. The scenery is stunning. And I do this for a living. The fishing can be epic. Keep in mind that assuming you are fly-fishing (which you should be) the winds can be very tough. It was common to have 25-30 mph winds each day. Several days we had winds of 60+. Therefore your casting has to be spot on as its technical to say the least. You can have great days and crummy days (dont go for a short trip). But what I found is that I was experiencing a place so beautiful, undeveloped and pristine it was an honor just being there. The fishing was secondary. -FT"
6376840,vteye3,2019-12-10 13:43:00,496,"Hey Ted - Sorry dude but most bucket list fishing trips are all about the fishing. Glad you enjoy Patagonia and happy you are a pro but your post struck me like a heavy bat. I will take a river/lake full of fish, ""easy fishing"" on my bucket list trips any time. Wonder how many folks on this site are hard core ""fly fishing - which you should be"" types. I try to avoid Snobsville, USA an never leave home without my hand picked nightcrawlers."
6376870,Fisherman Ted,2019-12-10 16:35:00,461,LOL. Tell that to muskie fishermen. Guys going to Russia or New Zealand sight fishing for monster trout. Or Tuna fishermen in the Atlantic or Marlin fishing in Cabo. Or hiking deep into Yosemite for golden trout. How many fish you catch has nothing to do with the ultimate experience.
6376872,Yellow Fever,2019-12-10 16:55:00,1809,"Three years ago a wealthy friend flew me from Ontario to his house in Vancouver then we flew north to Bella Bella and helicoptered into a 5 star floating lodge ( Millbank Sound) for ocean Salmon, It was a pretty epic trip for me but he does it every year. In the winter he goes to Tasmania to fish Brown Trout and hop scotches in a helicopter. Pretty amazing he can catch a fish there and text me the pic 5 minutes later. I actually do my bucket list tip every year when I drive to Port Clinton and meet up with a bunch of my American friends for 2 weeks...high light of my year and the fishing has very little to do with it."
6377174,Mike Borger,2019-12-11 16:02:00,1554,"Going to stick up for Ted here. I think you read it the wrong way. When he said he does it for a living what he meant was he owns a lodge in NW Ontario, he's not a fly fishing guide or anything like that. The vast majority of the anglers who visit his lodge to catch the walleye, pike and smallmouth aren't fly fishing so there's certainly no elitist attitude.This is Ted's thing to do in the winter after a busy season of catering to anglers. Personally his description of Patagonia made me want to go, it sounds awesome. Take the comment about you ""should be fly fishing"" at face value and don't read into it. Patagonia is a landscape of rivers and lakes that are tailor made for fly fishing. Poll 100 avid fly fishermen what their dream trip would be and I'll bet many would include Patagonia.Anyhow, just thought I'd interject.Cheers"

6376048,coldtuna,2019-12-06 05:20:00,25,"This is a very interesting thread and discussion for me. I am pretty new to fishing Canada, and my son and I have really gotten into it the last few years. I used to fish solely in salt water and am fortunate to have done a number of bucket list saltwater trips for marlin, giant tuna, roosterfish, as well as trips to the northern Great Barrier Reef for a wide variety of exotic fish (which if you are looking for a bucket list' trip, this is one to think about). I have done a couple great trips to Canada now and have several planned for 2020 and in the initial stages of planning for 2021. I have had a few disappointing trips to Canada and also have been surprised at what I found to be the operating conditions at some of the camps, even when the fishing was quite good (late and incomplete meals, guides who compete with guests for trophy fish, guides who can't even read a fish finder/graph, guide with a broken transducer so no depth finder for 2 days of fishing, main guide and trip coordinator no showing at camp and not providing notice to me in advance of the trip, access to lakes that were marketed to me was actually not available, lack of reasonable rods/reels for anglers to use in remote location, owner of the charter company focusing the entire trip on a film crew on board and ignoring the remaining paying customers, etc.). Like Brett, in my experience it is not unusual on these types of trips to occasionally have a major problem. Sometimes it is weather, which is obviously uncontrollable and goes with the territory. However, sometimes in my experience it is unethical or low quality operators. One of the things that internet sites like this one sometimes can do is help traveling anglers identify operators that are more likely to provide less than was promised and less than the traveling angler was expecting. Providing this negative information is a hard thing to do, because most of us don't want to make negative public comments about another person's business or livelihood. But, I have experienced disappointing bucket list trips due to an operator who was unethical (in Mexico), simply not very good, or was merely inconsiderate or lazy, and it would have been great to have avoided that experience. I have written scathing internet reports to spare other anglers from getting ripped off like I was (again, Mexico). I have explained to several operators around the world when I was not happy with my trip (and others on the trip were also not pleased) that for a portion of their clientele, the trip was that client's once in a lifetime and that the operator did not deliver what was marketed or promised and that is in my view is inconsiderate. What I got in response was a lame excuse and I told them as much. I have not been back to patronize those businesses. I am not sure how to effectively avoid these situations, but expect many who visit this site have had a bad experience or two and can identify some red flags for Canadian outfitters who more frequently fail to deliver. And, that kind of information would be helpful to me as I plan for future trips. I also take a similar view to Brett in that I am trying to do as much of this kind of thing as I can in light of various real and potential health issues. It hurts when you are in the middle of a long anticipated trip and it is a bust and you know there were other good options you turned down. I get bent out of shape when I am traveling with my teenage son and an operator does not deliver as promised. Those are scarce times with him and when an operator does not respect our time, I get upset. I have had friends warn me off of Canada trips based on what they had heard about a particular camp or lodge, or about the lodge's guides (e.g., guides sleep while anglers fish). But, I still have had a few significant disappointments with Canadian lodges the last few years. It would be great to find a way to avoid some of these situations going forward as well as find those camps or lodges that offer a great opportunity and try very hard to deliver what is promised. In addition to traveling with my son, I have a few friends who have not fished Canada that I'd like to take with me, and I would definitely like to avoid an operator who is less likely to provide what is promised. In terms of my own bucket list trips, I'd like to do Panama for yellowfin tuna on topwater, I'd like to catch some dogtooth tuna jigging off of Papua New Guinea (or a similar location), I'd like to get in on an great fall lake trout bite, and I'd like to do a combo offshore/inshore trip in Alaska."

Blessed to have caught plenty of fish over the years in plenty of places, any chance to watch her reel in her ""fish of a lifetime"" gets my heart pumping more often than catching my own. Her favorite fish are Arctic char, lake trout and muskie so anywhere we can go for those is perfect. But on my bucket, it's fly fishing Atlantics in say maybe Ungava, a self-guided tour at Trophy Lodge on Bear for lakers if possible, casting for tarpon somewhere, probably doing the Iceland browns, and there are two lesser known spots in the remote Arctic I'd like to see and char fish.

Years ago I had the experience of a life time fishing the western coast of Costa Rica at Crocodile Bay Lodge. Catches of numerous pacific sailfish, huge mahi and wahoo along with rosterfish and giant jacks will always draw me back for a last bucket trip. Granted, you are a larger part of the pursuit on a walleye/pike trip. In Costa Rica you are dependent on a guide to put you onto fish. On that trip when a hookup was made the fight was between you and the fish standing on the stern deck with a stout rod and a shimano bait runner reel. Freespool was necessary to let the fish run with the bait feeling no resistance. I look forward to many more trips to the north for walleye, pike, bass and lakers but if I could squeeze one more trip to Costa Rico before I kick the bucket, well that's my dream."
