The lakes I see listed are West and East Arrow, Barass, and O'Dell to name a few. Anyone have some suggestions on lakes or a good outfitter they've used? Thanks."
6376760,maddogg,2019-12-10 08:00:00,178,I have thought of doing the same thing. Any idea what a one day fly in cost?
6376826,MrSimon,2019-12-10 12:34:00,922,"I've looked into this and was quoted anywhere from $2k - $4k, depending on flight times and number of people. If the outfitter can work you into an already existing schedule, prices will be a lot less, but that's a big IF."
6376834,walleyecheek,2019-12-10 13:34:00,2231,Guys I know staying in nestorfalls flew out to arrow with a guide the pilot shore lunch included for 250 bucks apiece. 3 of them went but it's been like 5 years ago

Min of 4.I have not fished any of those lakes, but if it were me I would hit O'Dell because of its size and structure. Arrow seems long, narrow and shallow. Unless you want to target some bass too. Barras might be ok too, but O'Dell is larger, but not too big for a day.Otherwise call Nestor Falls Fly-in Outposts, Gateway North Outfitters or Canadian Fly-in Fishing to see if they can offer anything. You need an outfiiter that has their own planes to make a day trip viable.Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk"
