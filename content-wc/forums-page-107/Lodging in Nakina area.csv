Also, if anyone has fished O'Sullivan during May and cares to share info about the lake I would appreciate it. Thanks. Tom"

They also have a small restaurant on site for a nice breakfast before you continue on to Nakina.Although farther out, we have also stayed at the Four Winds in Longlac a few times. It is a comfortable stay, reasonable and I think they offer a basic breakfast depending on how early you check out. Or you can get donuts across the highway.We’ve fished O’Sullivan Lake 3-4 times but always in July so I don’t have much info for early in the year. The fishing was good to great every time but it has been maybe 4-5 years since our last trip there."

Only 'problem' I suppose is if you want breakfast or dinner in Nakina, not much available. It's constantly changing though. Pennocks does have coffee and a small tuck shop though. There is also R&D Apartments in Nakina. I know people stay there, I have not yet though. Seems fine.I tried to arrange to stay at Cordingley Lake Cabins earlier this year, but it was really hard to get ahold of the owner. He has a couple basic cottages with outhouses on the lake. It's closest to the air base and is why I wanted to stay there. Never managed to arrange it though.I have never stayed in Geraldton."

They are clean, two bedroom, kitchen, living room/dining, bath apts that are just a couple miles from the airport. They are basically using it as a hotel, but it's an apt bldg. Thanks for reminding me, I have to make our reservation for August."

Restaurant / bar on site, clean & quiet, and as an added bonus you can shore fish for a few eyes about 100 yards down the road. I've stayed at a few other places in the area and I can't recommend them."
