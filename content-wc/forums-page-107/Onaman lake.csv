My regular week begins the last Sunday in July. Weather - I follow Al Linder's assessment of a week of weather in Canada. There will be two good days, two bad days, and three days that will be a nix. In September the bad days will have more wind and cooler temps. In July it's sandals. In September it's Muck boots. Bring apparel for days that are 70 and sunny and days that are 52 windy and rain. One day the wind kept us off the lake. We were also delayed flying out. Didn't get out until 2:00 pm. Keep this in mind when arriving and when leaving. September is a month of transition. Fishing - Onaman is a shallow lake with fish caught in 6' to 14' any time of the tear. Hot weather they are generally deeper. In September we found them in 8"" to 10"". If the wind is bad, there are plenty of productive spots out of the wind. One day two of us caught 96 fish. A couple of large northerns, a large sucker, and the rest were fat, chunky, hard fighting walleyes. The standard walleye on Onaman is 19"" to 24"". We refer to them as wallbass. There're walleyes, fish them as walleyes, but the fight like a bass without the jumping. Fishing is September is very good. With the cooler temperatures, you'll be tempted to burn more wood to heat the cabin. If you are going to Picnic Island, keep in mind that wood is limited - it is an island. A sweatshirt for the cabin and some hot drinks helps handle a cooler cabin. On the other side, September temps make for better sleeping that August. If you're prepared, September is a great moth for a trip to Onaman."
