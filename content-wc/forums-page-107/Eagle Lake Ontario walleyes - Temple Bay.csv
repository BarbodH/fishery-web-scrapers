The early info I've been seeing is jig and minnows, fish the cabbage, fish shallow humps, 10 to 15 feet of water. Lots of water, how do i narrow it down. Really cant afford a guide. Thanks for your help!"
6375120,BornToFish,2019-12-02 05:56:00,1224,"Greetings,The ""early info"" recited by the original poster should be an excellent starting point. The specifics of what will be encountered next July will be largely determined by weather patterns in May and June: temperatures, rainfall, wind and the like.I haven't stayed at Temple Bay Lodge, so cannot comment on their practices. Most lodge owners hold an orientation session of some sort on the day that guests arrive. If so, have the lodge owner mark up a map for you when you arrive at the lodge. If you can, attend a nearby All Canada Show in Q1 2020 and meet the lodge owner face-to-face. Take a lake map with you to the show and have him/her mark it up for you. Ask for personal references that attend the lodge when you will be there so that you can reach out to these people. Someone should be willing to help you out with basic information.Another suggestion is to make friends at dinner or at the dock. You may meet some folks that will spot you some information. Fishing a lake as big as Eagle Lake for the first time can be intimidating. I suggest trying to break the lake down into manageable portions - especially near your lodge. For example, focus on a bay or cluster of islands. Don't try to master the lake in your first week there.I will offer some other general suggestions:Look at the lake map and identify points on land and major islands. Try fishing these in the 10-15 fow range.When fishing shorelines and points, try fishing sections of the lake receiving wind today or yesterday's wind.If you want to target walleyes that have left the shorelines, look for humps that are within 1/2 mile or so of shore.During Prime Time (early morning and just before sunset), look for clusters of boats on the lake. They are likely fishing these community spots for a reason. This approach means that you will be fishing with other boats nearby.Weed beds in the lakes that I fish tend to be located in bays with shorelines that are pretty flat. Steep shorelines tend to be rocky, whereas flatter shorelines tend to have mud bottoms that can support weed growth. Cabbage weeds are often located in front of ""pencil reeds"" on the shoreline. Unlike the lakes that I fish in Wisconsin, weed beds are often relatively small or narrow on the Canada Shield. Don't count on finding acres of weeds.The fish don't always bite all day long. I suggest that you fish for what is biting at the time of the day that you are on the lake. The walleyes may not be biting in the early afternoon. If so, try casting for northern pike or target perch. The small mouth bass bite can be phenomenal in the early evening during early July.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6375350,[email protected],2019-12-02 22:22:00,7,appreciate the help! great comments! Are leeches or plastics in play at all....or stick to minnows?
6375384,BornToFish,2019-12-03 05:24:00,1224,"Greetings, The question about choice of bait is sort of like asking which is better: Fords versus Chevy. Everyone has their opinion, and everyone is right. I believe that soft plastics excel with horizontal presentations. I cast it out or drift, such that the lure is moving horizontally through the water column. Casting shorelines in spring time is a classic situation for horizontal presentations. The walleye needs to make a quick decision - either eat it or it will be gone. They don't have the luxury of time to think about it. You may find that the bite will be transitioning from horizontal presentations to vertical presentations in early July. I find that this is the time of the season when I begin using less plastics, and more relying upon live bait. The fish has the luxury of time to study the lure with vertical presentations as it's basically not going anywhere. The fish can think about my lure before deciding to eat or pass on it. I use far and away more live bait than anything else during summer and autumn. I'm a believer that all live baits (minnows, frozen/salted minnows, leeches, crawlers) have their moment of glory. I try hard to have all in the boat with me as I never know which will be producing fish at any given time, and may change several times throughout the day. That being said, I normally have some soft plastics in the boat as back-up in case we run out of live baits. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6375706,Ricky Spanish,2019-12-04 11:08:00,1298,"My wife and I have fished out of Temple Bay about 6-10 days a year since 2002. It is my Happy Place. We mostly go in mid-June and jig and minnow is our go to when walleye fishing. We have caught 100's of walleye within sight of the lodge. I would focus on the usual, windblown points/islands, and drop offs/humps from 12-18'. Early and late in the day, you can probably find them shallower. If it's been cold, they might be deeper, or they might be in shallower bays catching some sun. Are you taking your own boat? If not, I highly recommend one of their upgraded boats with Spot Lock. Being able to read a locator is a must unless you're just trolling around Temple Bay, which is BORING but works, too. A friend of ours landed a 52"" muskie dragging an inline spinner around the bay a few years ago. We have our deposit down for a trip starting on 6/13 again next year, but I am not sure we can make it up there again because my wife is still off work recovering from the stroke she had in July. Even if we don't make it, others in our group will be there that week, so feel free to hit me up via PM closer to your trip and I'll give some specifics."
6375800,[email protected],2019-12-04 20:59:00,7,You guys are awesome. I really appreciate the comments. Thanks much! We are super excited to go!!
6375824,BornToFish,2019-12-05 05:08:00,1224,"Greetings,I hope that you and your sons have a fantastic time on your upcoming adventure in NW Ontario - make some great memories together such that you are certain to return.I sense that you may not have a lot of experience fishing in NW Ontario. If that's the case, I encourage you to NOT spend a lot of money for equipment and tackle for use on this trip. Equipment and tackle for targeting walleyes can be remarkably simple if you want it to be. On the other hand, you can quickly spend a LOT of money if you want to.I wasn't sure if the mother of your sons will be accompanying you on the trip. If not, I strongly encourage you to have a notarized letter from her giving her permission for your sons to accompany you to Canada. You probably won't need to rely upon this letter, but I assure you that your trip could come to a screeching halt at the border without it - been there and done that!Good fishing and tight lines!!"
