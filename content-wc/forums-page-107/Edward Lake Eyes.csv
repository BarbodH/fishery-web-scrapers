6375864,srj,2019-12-05 08:29:00,971,Sure with it wasn't such a long haul to get up there for the ice fishing. The chain is really a fun group of lakes to fish. From shallow dishpan to deep and clear. Cobble was my favorite lake on the chain but they are all good. Lots of walleyes and lots of muskies. And sometimes whitefish and lakers. Is the chain still free of norhtern pike? Gods country ice fishing for sure.
6375870,prov1800,2019-12-05 08:41:00,5010,I'll agree.fun lake to fish in summer and winter.actually tgere is some really good pike in there.there has been for years.They came in over the dam from corner lake.Caught a small one yesterday.But this last summer and last winter I ended up catching some real quality ones.
6375872,prov1800,2019-12-05 08:45:00,5010,"Here's a small one from yesterday but have caught up to 45""."
6376498,srj,2019-12-08 08:38:00,971,Interesting on the northerns. Way back it was really weird never catching a pike. I like pike but it was pretty cool using pike style baits and only catching muskies. We never did catch any muskies in Cobble but saw a couple large ones following. You sure make good use of living in Gods Country.

6376512,prov1800,2019-12-08 10:43:00,5010,The pike came over the dam from Corner lake at high water.Still pretty easy to get muskies on smaller baits as well as some good sized pike.As for muskies there are plenty of those in cobble as well as boulder.its a good system and I don't get to fish there often.The smallmouth bass are also getting plentiful and some truely good si≈∫ed ones.
6376714,prov1800,2019-12-09 21:24:00,5010,Some guests just left from fishing at Edward Lake and some new guests are coming so i had a chance to sneak in this afternoon for a couple of hours of non stop catching.All nice eaters but big fish havnt moved in yet.Pretty much got one everytime i let my jig time.fished from 3:30-5:30.still actively biting when i left.Nice in a warm shack weather is pretty cool at -18/25c wind chill.Had my 4 eaters before the shack warmed up.Any body looking for some relaxing fishing within 100 yards of your cabin give clarks a look at KC;s landing on Edward Lake.Fishing there is awesome all through winter
