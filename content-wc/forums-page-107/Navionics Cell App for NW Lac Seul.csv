6373464,David Anderson,2019-11-23 21:31:00,2073,"Yes, it works good there as well. Was in Wapesi and a guy was lost and came up to the boat. It was easier to pull up the app on my phone and show him where we were and how to exit. I was impressed as I have the chip on my Lowrance and it is exactly the same."
6373674,bassface44,2019-11-25 08:33:00,96,Excellent! Thanks so much gentlemen. This is exactly the kind of first hand info I was looking for. If you know of any particularly awful hazards that aren't on the sonar charts let us know too please. A little less than 8 months to go.
6373738,David Anderson,2019-11-25 12:37:00,2073,"I go to LSO at least 3 and sometimes 4 times/year. Certainly the Navionics map is a critical item for safer navigation. Still last May as I was going in I hit a reef past Bear Narrows as the green buoy wasn't in it's proper place causing $22,000 of damage to my Evinrude 250HO's lower unit and my boat transom. Not all hazards are marked and not all marks are hazards however it is quite amazing how accurate it is. I always give the map any benefit of doubt. The Navionics map has a well marked houseboat trail that will assure safe passage, at least to the main areas of the lake. The other important thing is the map is Land/water accurate. 8 months is next July and the water level will be at a good level, the buoys will all be in their proper place and you certainly don't have to go very far to catch fish once your there. Also your app may show a greater detail of the depth in 1 foot increments. it is extremely unreliable and is only a representation of some of the capabilities of SonarCharts Live and can add a lot of clutter to the information you are reading."
6373856,Lmbkiller,2019-11-25 20:46:00,639,"Your nuts to trust the buoys on lac seul. It's also hard to say what water level will be in July, the last 2yrs it's been below normal. Go easy or pay the price"
6373958,David Anderson,2019-11-26 11:34:00,2073,"Boy did I learn that lesson!! If I would have been over to the right just 2 more feet I would have been OK, In June the buoy was back in 14 feet of water. Just picked up the boat yesterday and dropped $1300 on a new axle............thank you 502."
6373986,Andre (wallyandre),2019-11-26 15:12:00,2274,I know it's not miraculous but you can adjust the water level on the app
4934825,rather-be-fishin,2016-06-17 16:23:00,429,"Anyone used the Navionics Boating Map US Canada APP on their cell phone while fishing NW area of Lac Suel McKenzie Bay, Bay of Islands, & South of Manitoba & Windigo Point areas? If so how well did it work & how accurate was the map? My son is planning to use this in the camp boat when we go end of July. Any input much appreciated! RBF"
4934849,dstar49,2016-06-17 16:29:00,33,our group used it last year and it worked great was very accurate and shows most everything you need to navigate the area. also has a tracking feature you can use that saves your tracks everytime you go out and can follow each time you go out.
4934921,Carnhzkr,2016-06-17 17:12:00,964,"Yep, it works fine. The $15 download app is just as good as the $120 Navionics chip. I had wondered if it would work once you got outside cell range, but it does. Before the trip when I relied on it a couple of years ago, I called Navionics and was told that you need to be able to hit a cell tower for it to work (you're not communicating directly with satellites like a real GPS), but you can be at a much greater distance than you'd need to be to make or receive calls. I was even able to use it with no issues on a fairly remote fly-in lake. If you don't have a GPS/sonar unit, it's a good, cheap, and easy solution."
4935137,KHedquist,2016-06-17 20:22:00,4367,"Here is a tip if your going into an area without cell coverage, your phone has an internal gps typically. If you going into the menu you will see Download Map function, click on it you can download a lake or area to your mobile device. The map is downloaded and will use the GPS to track you. Another tip use airplane mode to save battery life."
4935473,muskyroller,2016-06-18 07:25:00,56,I was thinking about doing the same thing. I just found this app this week and am headed to LS in 6 days...too bad I bought the $10 version before seeing the $15 US/Canada. Looks like I'll have both.
4935969,farmnfish,2016-06-18 13:38:00,130,I've used it for several years works great. I've got it on a tablet mounted next to the fish finder. I just download any map i need before going out.
6373408,bassface44,2019-11-23 12:59:00,96,Anyone with recent experience using this app in the NE section of Lac Seul?
6373418,Andre (wallyandre),2019-11-23 14:49:00,2274,Just click on the link and this what you get with the app or thcard:https://webapp.navionics.com/#boatin...key=iverH~kqsP
6373454,bassface44,2019-11-23 19:52:00,96,"Thanks! I should have been clearer in my post. Our group is familiar with the app and has been using it for several years on LOTW but this will be our first trip to Lac Seul. We are going to be at Lac Seul Outposts. It is my understanding that there is no cell service out there. It is also my understanding that the app will need to ping cell towers to be accurate. I was just wondering if anyone has been using the app on an iphone out in that section of the lake with success. If the app is an iffy proposition out there, north of Chamberlain then we need to start thinking now about GPS units and chips etc."
6373456,Andre (wallyandre),2019-11-23 20:05:00,2274,You don't need any cell signal to use the app. I use it while I'm I'm on a remote trip
