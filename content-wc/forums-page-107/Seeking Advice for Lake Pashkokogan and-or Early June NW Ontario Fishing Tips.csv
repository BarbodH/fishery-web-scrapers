I am hoping someone on this forum has fished this lake to give me advice for patterns to look for walleye and pike. Any help or info on water clarity, forage, lure selection, structure, how deep or shallow to look for fish or just any info to help out. If you have fished NW Ontario in the early part of June but not that specific lake I'd welcome any strategies you'd be willing to share. Definitely 2 questions I have is 1: that part of the year, will the spawn be over for walleye? I'm fairly certain pike will be long done spawning by then. But I've heard pike can be lethargic post-spawn. 2: Is live bait needed for walleye? I've read that it may be too early for leeches and crawlers. Mostly a minnow bite that early in the season. Is that true? Honestly I'd rather throw cranks and soft plastics, but I'll do whatever is most successful. Thanks all, sorry for the long post."

In a ""normal"" year, by June, my experience has been that the walleyes are pretty much done with the spawn, but still relate to shorelines. Plastics and live bait can be equally effective. Crawlers and leeches aren't out of the realm of possibility, but again depends on water temps, etc. ""Normal"" is different for each angler... As far as pike, my experience has been that the real big ones are off shore by that time and the ""decent"" ones are still hanging around the shorelines. My best success on big pike has been closer to ice out and then later in the fall. Big ones like the cold water and follow the big schools of ""big"" bait. I think lots of the bigger pike that time of year (June) are caught jigging walleyes in the 15-25 foot ranges. You won't be disappointed in June, regardless of the conditions. It really is prime everywhere in NW Ont."
