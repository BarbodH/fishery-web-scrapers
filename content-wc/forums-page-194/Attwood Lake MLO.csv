This is our third trip with Mattice, having fished Guerin Lake twice. We wanted a new experience, so decided on a bigger Lake. I have done well fishing in current, but not so hot on just a Lake. Was hoping anyone that has fished Attwood, or who could offer tips on this River system could give me some pointers. Thanks guys! Wishing you all a good, safe fishing season. Kenny"

You will find great fishing on the west end of the small island in front of your cabin. If you head west from your camp, there are a couple of islands on the north side of the lake that is also very good. If you go to the NE end of the lake, there is a small channel (watch for rocks) that opens up and has good fishing on the north side. At one time there was a cabin on that end of the lake, but it is no longer there. My group will be staying at the west camp over Labor Day. I hope you have a great trip. Bfgilly"
