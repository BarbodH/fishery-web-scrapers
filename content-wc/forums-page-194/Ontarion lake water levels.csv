5566818,Pooch,2017-05-24 11:25:00,4618,This thread comes up every year and I'm surprised that no one started it already.What is the wet or dry status of Ontario? Lake levels? Forests?Lac Seul seems to be the one that changes the most thru out the season. What's it like so far this year?I wish some of this rain here in Illinois was (a lot) further north!Pooch

Looks like it's coming up about 6 in per week, and the outflow is steady, so they're trying to increase the water level in the system."
5567258,Stringbean,2017-05-24 13:40:00,279,"Also note that the outflow from Lake St. Joseph into Lac Seul using the diversion channel is way above normal. If I read the graph correctly, it stands at about 6500 cubic meters of water per second coming over the dam. That and the reduced outflow at Ear Falls, the pool level of the reservoir should come up nicely. Here is what the outflow to the diversion channel looks like."
5567426,BRP,2017-05-24 15:12:00,77,"I would agree, we are down about 15-18 inches from ""normal"" at my place near Kenora."
5570489,Skywagon,2017-05-25 17:52:00,1106,"I was with two water bomber pilots this morning when they each got a text from the MNR bomber base, stating as of that time they were in a yellow alert and were on call because of fire potential. I assume with a 70% chance of rain tomorrow and with it in the forecast for the next few days, that may change.Yesterday I flew out to a couple of lakes to check on outpost cabins that I had not been to since ice out, water levels were normal on both. Low water has not been an issue anywhere I have been."
