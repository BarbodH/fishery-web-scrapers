5544041,reddemon,2017-05-14 19:04:00,39,"Looking for info on a outpost in NW Ontario/Manitoba. Interested in remote lakes with trophy's, catch n release and take home fish. Haven't done an outpost in 30yrs. Budget is roughly around $750pp."
5544225,adempsey2.0,2017-05-14 20:00:00,612,"Not sure about MB, but for NW Ontario you will likely have to increase your budget at least $200pp."
5544730,Bstar,2017-05-15 06:32:00,564,I agree with adempsey. You will be hard pressed to find an outpost on a trophy lake for $750 unless you go with one of the outfitters in the Wawa area. Average nowadays for a seven day trip in Northwest Ontario has to be around $1200-1500 US. We are doing a 6 day trip with Slate Falls Outposts for $1115 but that's a special price they offer in July and August on Miniss Lake. Regular price is around $1500. Check them out here www.slatefallsoutposts.com. Also check out adempsey's site at www.lineonfishing.com He has a ton of info about fly-ins and outfitters in Ontario. Also check out Amik Outposts out of Red Lake. They have several outposts northwest of Red Lake on trophy lakes for around $1300. www.canadianflyinfishing.com Good luck with your search.

5545234,sbooth,2017-05-15 09:39:00,3,"Lots of great options in the Nakina, ON area."
5545386,Bstar,2017-05-15 10:26:00,564,Ditto on Nakina outfitters. Hearst air offers several outposts at around $950. Cabins might be a little more rustic but they're on some good fishing lakes. You can see some great trip reports on several outposts here www.canadafishingguide.net just click on trip reports. I see you have your own boat. You might consider a boat in camp or outpost especially if cost is an issue.
5545762,camp chef,2017-05-15 12:21:00,915,You might look at Stokes Bay Resort on Rainy lake...It is a boat in very remote.Great fishing and prices.....It is a rustic outpost camp.
