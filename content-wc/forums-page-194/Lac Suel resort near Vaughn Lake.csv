I would even consider a different area of the lake if it wasn't too far of a ride to that area.Thanks!"

We went back there searching for perch one trip and saw the cabins and a sign. Not sure if they are even still in business...this was probably 7-8 years ago. But, other than that, there is nothing on that eastern end of the lake."
