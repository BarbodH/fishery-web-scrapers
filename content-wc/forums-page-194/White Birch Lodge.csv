5576297,Redline,2017-05-29 09:51:00,73,This is just really sad. We'd been staying there for 20 plus years and last year they shut down right before our trip. I had thought the new owners were doing a nice job slowly updating the place and nobody has said the real reason why they couldn't open last year. Such a shame.
