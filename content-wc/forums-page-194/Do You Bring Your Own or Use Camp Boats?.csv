5574465,packpro,2017-05-28 07:29:00,695,"I've done it both ways and for me it comes down to the body of water. At our go to camp it is mainly a river with quite a few protected bays. There is really only one large open water area to cross. Distances from the dock are not more than 5-6 miles, and most are shorter than that. The camp boats avg 16 mph with Yamaha 25 HP. They back troll nice, very little hand bailing in the protected bays. We will fish a spot, but often, we will fish a ""stretch"". Setting up that short drift is a captains challenge, but it is part of the experience. We have also fish three in boat on large open water-Dinoric and everyone got drowned. Driving back to camp was wave after wave sucker punching the tiller captain in face. No escape. Take my own boat now and appreciate the freedom the trolling motor provides. I can set a heading and control course and speed. I can hit spot lock to net or fight a fish and not worry about washing up on near by rocks. It allows me to fish closer to that structure. I think we caught the same amount of fish either way but my own boat makes it easier. You just have to factor in addition loading/preparation/trailer maintenance into the consideration. For the type of fishing we get that week if I had no choice I would take a 12' wooden boat with oars."
5574505,kzoofisher,2017-05-28 07:56:00,5144,"I'm luckier than I knew and should appreciate the lodge more. They have three grades of boats; the mid and upper grades have live wells, pedestal seats and trolling motors with remotes. When the guy fishing the front has a fish on the guy in the back with the remote makes sure we don't blow into any rocks and the guy in the middle does the netting. We can't make 30mph, rod storage is not as good and I need my own sonar. I bring an extra anchor and a drift sock, too. A tiller would be better because we have three guys in a 16' but most people prefer consoles and that's just the way it is. I would't consider using one of the lowest grade boats because the drop-off would be too much, the upgrades are fine though. All part of the adventure of being away from civilization."
5573177,pjshorthorn,2017-05-27 06:49:00,5654,"Used to haul my boat all the way from NE PA to Lac Seul.......that was a haul. Thankfully we never had any roadside issues on those trips. If I lived close to Canada I Would probably buy another boat and use it vs. a camp boat. At this point I use camp boats and if they offer an upgrade model I spend the extra money. Currently, the upgrade boat I rent at V-Bay Lodge is an 18' Alumarine with a 40 HP Yamaha, depth finder and a Terrova trolling motor. It is a really nice boat at a very reasonable weekly rate of around $43.00/day in Canadian funds or approximately $30 US.The only thing it doesn't have is a live well or GPS. Breezy Point has fixed up one of his older GPS units so I can drop some waypoints this year on spots where I find reefs and fish. I don't need a live well......I just pee straight into the lake. I have had some beater camp boats over the years,but they always served the purpose. The boat in the foreground is the one I use when Gord has to run to Dryden for supplies.PjShorthorn"
5573185,Northwoodswalleye,2017-05-27 07:03:00,262,Always bring my own. Live in MN so it's not a long tow but I like my boat and electronics setup and want to use it as much as possible. It would be like I'm cheating on my own boat if I rented!
5573193,wallydave,2017-05-27 07:05:00,2151,You don't let Breezy pee in Gords boat I hope! Does Gords thong leave any uncomfortable wear patterns in the seat?
5573209,pjshorthorn,2017-05-27 07:17:00,5654,"Breezy is kinda a ""pee in his own boat"" type of fella. It has been rumored that Gord is an ""Au Natural "" fisherman. We keep our fingers crossed that there are no moonlit evenings while we are in camp . So far we have been pretty lucky,but the new trip is rapidly approaching. PjShorthorn"
5573713,Rich B,2017-05-27 14:27:00,1081,"If at all possible I like to bring my own rig up north, as for many years that was the main opportunity I had to use it (as I was too busy with work and raising my family, etc). Have used a nice upgraded camp boat a few years ago ('17 deep-v tiller with a 40 Yama), live well, sonar and vinyl flooring with a front foot controlled electric. My buddy and I split the cost ($200 more ea); though it included 20 gals gas so I thought the price was fair. There were 4 of us that trip, and I towed up my other friend's new Lund for him and his son, that went with us on that Canadian trip to Cedar Lake. As someone else mentioned earlier, once you have your own rig into camp and set up at the dock; it's great to go down early in the morning and head out on the lake. Camp boats are OK, though I much prefer fishing out of my own rig any day of the week. Rich B"
5573841,Terwalleye,2017-05-27 18:25:00,166,"So you tabled the question where can a guy rent a nice boat. The only answer I know of is to stay at camp with nicer boats. In fact one of the number one reason we picked Clarks on Cedar Lake several years ago was we did not want all the things you list about a camp boat. We are literally on the water more than 12 hours a day. I want to be comfortable and have nice equipment. And until I win the powerball a fully loaded Lund is not in my future. So if you're in love with the lake you fish this isn't much help. But if a nice boat matters that much (and it does to our group) I would check out resorts that offer nicer boats. Year number 8 for us going back to Clark's Northern Lights. Haven't spent much time thinking about going anywhere else soon. Good folks, and well run camp. Really nice newer cabins......yada yada yada."
5574009,muskyman73,2017-05-27 21:07:00,401,"gotta have my own boat up there, I have the top to get out of the elements and enough hp and free board in bad weather. We watch the GPS and we read the topo maps constantly and always travel slow or on the electric motor in unfamilar waters. You can never be too careful up there."
5574033,LoDo,2017-05-27 21:33:00,721,"My youth was spent in Waterloo, IA, Eau Claire, WI, MSP, MN and Grand Forks, ND. Dad went through a few lunds, rangers during those days and we'd always take his boat to LOW, Devil Lake, Leech Lake, Bemidji, Sakakawea, Lac Seul, etc...... Loved having his boat. Now that our families are in CO, we use camp boats. I think a lot depends on where you live. We try and upgrade from the 40hp to the 50hp if available. 2 in a boat. Camp boats these days for the most part are fine. 13 more days...."
5574209,fishmanric,2017-05-28 05:55:00,219,"I've done it both ways but having your own boat makes it so much nicer. My wife tends to over pack so I need the extra space. I bring up 30 gallons of gas for my 115hp and that gets me through the two week stay. In all the years, only one blown trailer tire on 502 after hitting a sharp pot hole."
5574425,Mojo-NC,2017-05-28 07:11:00,1929,"It looks like our only option is to choose another lodge on a different lake that offers an upgrade on boats if we want to fish out of something better equipped. Our current lodge provides a 16 foot Lund boat with a 15 HP outboard motor, all gas and bait, swivel seats, paddles, anchor, landing net, and bait bucket. We bring enough portable fish finders so that each boat has one. They are the only lodge on the lake. To change now would be kinda like going back to square one, as after 12 years we're finally at the point where we really know this lake well and always get on the fish quickly. If we brought our own boat, it would be a 1620 mile drive so I know that's not going to happen."
5571633,Mojo-NC,2017-05-26 08:55:00,1929,"I'm sure many if not most of you bring your own boats when you go up to Canada to fish, at least judging by the numbers we follow through customs and on our way up there. Almost everyone in our group has to fly to INL or whichever other nearby airport we end up choosing. We pack our tackle, stow our rods, bring a portable fish finder and rechargeable gel cell battery, rent a truck, and drive up to the lodge. We fish out of the camp boats and spend our week back trolling or drifting. Several of our guys aren't very good at using the tiller motors, so the others of us get to play the role of being captain all day, every day. Those of you who use your own boats don't know how good you have it. I'll admit it. I'm kinda spoiled and am used to fishing out of a fancy boat at home with all of the bells and whistles, so it is quite a change to switch to tiller motors, back trolling, bringing the fish stringer in and out of the boat each time we go from one spot to another, standing in a couple of inches of water in the back of the boat all day or hand scooping it out, having the suction cup mounted portable transducer come flying off of the back of the boat while running, etc. Don't get me wrong, we still have a great time and catch a lot of fish. Going back to the basics is not a terrible thing and can be a welcome challenge once in a while. However, on the other hand, given the choice I think I would prefer to have a foot-controlled trolling motor, electronics, a livewell, and maybe even a bilge pump. Are there any boat dealerships, individuals, or outfitters who rent equipped boats for those of us who might be willing to pay a little extra for that option?"
5571665,Lovetofish,2017-05-26 09:12:00,458,Getting old is fun isn't it? LOL
5571697,Pooch,2017-05-26 09:30:00,4618,"We do both. Depending on camp access.It's nice having one's own boat and it's easier once you get to camp. No setting up depth finders and rods laying lose and or in some cases leaky boats with worn out seats.Then again having one's own boat isn't a free ride either. Get the boat ready, bearings checked or replaced, lower unit serviced. Change fuel filters and engine oil, etc.. Added fuel towing and parking hassle. Oh yea, insurance. Probably using camp boats is cheaper and when you head home you just walk away.Then again I'll put up with the extra work of having my own familiar boat just for the comfort of fishing out of it.Many camps have a better boat than I own, but it's just not the same.Pooch"
5571729,Freytown,2017-05-26 09:41:00,770,"I take my own motor and fuel. Fuel on-site can get expensive and I'm a roamer, using about 20gal with my 20hp 4-stroke for seven days travel/trolling. Total mileage in/out for me is 320 miles of gravel road and the trailer always needed a paint job when I got home. FT"
5571785,Ricky Spanish,2017-05-26 10:26:00,1298,"I started bringing my own boat about 6yrs ago, when I was comfortable enough that I wouldn't destroy it somewhere out on Eagle Lake. One time since, I decided to leave it at home and use a camp boat but regretted it the whole time. Gas is expensive but I tend not to have to go very far, maybe 8-10 miles from camp. Some really reliable spots I can point to from a barstool at camp, which is how I learned about them. The lodge I go to has ""upgrade"" boats for an extra charge, which are brand new Kingfisher Warrior side console boats this year w/ 60 horse yamaha motor, a Helix 7 and Terrova I pilot.I never looked into rentals, so can't help you there."
5571961,GWC,2017-05-26 11:37:00,1021,"We've done both. It's nice to have the GPS maps & such that's in my boat but we drive about 2400 round trip & spend at least one night each way in a hotel. It's just far easier/safer to use a camp boat. It's a lot easier on our equipment too. The camp boats have been reliable with four cycle Yama's on 16 foot deep v's. Yea, it's more expensive but worth the money not having to tow my boat that distance."
5572041,DeBo,2017-05-26 11:58:00,211,Always bring my own boat and always will as long as I can launch it... Camp boat would be fine on a fly in but that is it. Would hate taking a camp boat out on LOTW. I roam all over creation and like the safety and comfort of a big glass boat. As much as I have invested in my own boat I feel obligated to use it as well. Not sure if that is a net good or net bad. Keeps me away from remote waters but the middle of LOTW is pretty remote too....
5572201,Richard B,2017-05-26 13:48:00,735,Have been taking our own boats for around 20 years. Before that we rented from the lodge. As far as someone not knowing how to run the tiller properly there is only one way to learn. We would switch every day. By the second or third day almost everyone had it figured out. Well except one guy and we never invited him back!!!!!!!
5572465,kzoofisher,2017-05-26 16:27:00,5144,"I've done both. Money wise it's a wash except for less wear and tear on the vehicle. I take my own sonar and a transom mount for the transducer so I can use my own waypoints. One other benefit is that the boat has no captain, makes things a little more democratic when it comes to fishing."
5573145,team walleye,2017-05-27 06:22:00,336,"We have done both. More things that can go wrong towing the boat all that way, but much more comfortable for a week of fishing with your own boat. We mostly always bring the boat along now."
