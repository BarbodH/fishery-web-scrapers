5561178,martinbns,2017-05-22 11:25:00,1520,"I use 10lb Powerpro with a 3-4 foot flouro leader. I seem to have settled on 12 pound flouro after trying several weights and brands. The 8lb berkley I tried first was so limp it was hard to tie to the PP and the spool was so tightly wound on a small spool it was just a pain. The brand name escapes me, but the package is light blue. If I get snagged as I inevitably so when jigging the leader tends to break right at the jig so I probably get 6-7 snags before having to retie. the lighter leader seemed to break nearer the PP so I was tieing it more often, may be just an impression though. I put 150 yards of PP on my reel before last season and haven't had to add any yet."
5561250,rockape,2017-05-22 12:01:00,215,"I've used 8# Trilene Sensation for over 20 years for jigging. I use 10-12 # Power Pro for spin casting small Rapala and Flicker Shads. The no stretch helps on getting a good rip and slash to get the lure moving. I also have 65# Power Pro on a baitcaster for mid-sized cranks like X-Raps (8-12). Some may laugh at the heavy line, but I've caught everything from 15 inch smallmouth to a 45 inch musky on this rig. The BIG walleyes love these bigger cranks, but so do the pike and muskies! I run a 100# Stealth Flouro leader on this. Big walleyes don't care!"
5561258,team walleye,2017-05-22 12:06:00,336,I just ordered some of this. Found a good deal from tackle warehouse. I ordered the 6lbs test in crystal clear. I will give it a shot for jigging.
5561282,JMKC,2017-05-22 12:19:00,238,"6# Berkeley XL or Sensation, would like to try others but no reason to. Excellent performance."
5561410,Larry S,2017-05-22 13:26:00,665,10LB--4LB Diameter Fireline Super Sensitive for jigging & feeling any lite bites trolling have used it for years
5561426,team walleye,2017-05-22 13:29:00,336,This will be the first time I have fished with anything other than mono. Interested to see how it goes.
5562306,Rock Hound,2017-05-22 21:36:00,51,"If going with mono, I really like Trilene 8 lb. (green in stained water). I switched to Berkley fluorocarbon a few years ago, and have tried braid this year on my jigging rods this spring with a fluorocarbon leader . . . I am getting used to it, and can see why many like it, but am not 100% sold. Fluorocarbon twists a bit more than mono and is stiffer. Braid can be an issue to tie knots as well as handle if snagged up (harder to break off and can even cut your hand). If you have time to get used to it (braid or fluoro), you might want to experiment with something new, if not, stick with your confidence line for your trip (mono) and to answer your post, I recommend Trilene XL 8 lb. for walleyes! Good luck!"
5565114,Hunts1,2017-05-23 19:10:00,123,I used mono until 10 or 15 years ago when I switched to spider wire. It is incredibly tough and supersensitive. I have made a convert of at least 10 to 15 guys who were using mono. I use 8 to 10 lb spider wire jigging and 15 casting. It is incredibly thin and durable. I will never go back to mono for jigging. I also use it for casting stick baits as now do all my buddies. It is a bit more expensive but worth it. It can be tough to tie when it is wet. It's like thread. Mono is easier by far easier to tie but that is a minor inconvenience.My two cents (worth about one and a half in Canada)Mike
5566402,bus33,2017-05-24 08:58:00,289,I made the switch to braid on my jigging rods a couple years ago and I really like it. I add a 6-8 ft leader of flouro to that via a small swivel. I make it that long so when I get cut off or snagged I can keep re-tying. When the leader gets too short I cut it and tie on another 6-8 ft length.
5559841,team walleye,2017-05-21 20:27:00,336,Heading up in a few weeks and I am looking to buy some new line. I haven't had the best luck with line in the past year. What brand and test do you all use for walleye? I am leaning towards mono. Thanks
5559953,JOE WALLEYE,2017-05-21 21:08:00,753,For mono you can't go wrong with trileene XL or sensation
5560249,Smoke_N_Finn,2017-05-22 06:11:00,437,"X2 on Trilene XL, been using it for 30 yrs. IMO, best mono line for spinning rods made. Sent from my XT1254 using Tapatalk"
5560265,port1042,2017-05-22 06:12:00,509,2X on Trilene XL. I generally spool my light and med-light rods with 6#. 8# on my medium. Have a great trip! I'm going to miss my spring visit to Perrault Lake but will be back the 1st of Sept.
5560321,walleye22,2017-05-22 06:31:00,59,yep...trilene xl for me as well. old reliable. 8# test.
5560337,Freytown,2017-05-22 06:32:00,770,"I like braid for jigging with a fluorocarbon leader but prefer mono for trolling with it's stretch properties. Braid much more sensitive for feeling the jig bite and no twisting to put up with, imo. FT"
5560537,team walleye,2017-05-22 07:48:00,336,That's where I will be!
5560553,LoDo,2017-05-22 07:58:00,721,"I've always been a mono guy, but thinking of making the change to braid. If going braid, is there a certain brand/lbs? I'm usually an #8lb mono on my jigging."
5560569,Mojo-NC,2017-05-22 08:02:00,1929,"I used to use Trilene XL but have since switched to P-Line Floroclear. It is great line and compared to mono it seems to have less stretch, less problems with line memory, and is incredibly strong. It is mono with a fluorocarbon coating, so it is supposed to be less buoyant than mono and still invisible in the water, but how would I know if the fish can see it or not. It does seem to catch 'em though. I like to use 10#. Another option is Suffix 832 braid with a P-Line Floroclear leader. It is even stronger and more sensitive. So many choices..."
5560730,Fishoil,2017-05-22 08:46:00,1277,For all my walleye jigging I went to P-line many years ago and love it. I used to use Trilene but find this stuff to be much more user friendly. I buy the 6 lb test in fluorescent green so I can see the line twitch with those light bites. http://www.basspro.com/PLine-CXX-Xtr...product/30719/
