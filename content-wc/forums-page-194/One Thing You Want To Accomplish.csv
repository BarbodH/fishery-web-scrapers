My goal is for the spirit of our Dad to live on through us, and for our boys (3 of them are making their first trip to Canada) to feel the passion for the family time and to be hooked on fishing! Fishing and hunting has always been important in our family, but my brothers and I all have very stressful jobs now, and we all need the time away (and together). Three of our sons are now in college, so this will be a rare week together. NO CELL PHONE, NO TV! I LOVE FISHING, but what I want to accomplish cannot be expressed in words.

A good friend of mine once told me that the secret to a happy life (at any age) are 2 factors: 1) having great memories with family and friends that love you 2) having good events and activities to look forward to in your future Putting aside the trappings of life (careers/houses/cars/boats/etc) the above rings true....I am blessed and thankful to include ""north of the border fishing trips"" in those memories, and having special events scheduled with family and friends on my calendar.

Also will be the first ""big"" fishing trip with both our new boat and my dad's new one.

He is 72 now, and for the past couple of years he will say this might be my last year a few times during the week. He takes his nap and then waits for us at the bar every night even though he doesn't drink. My second wish is to catch a musky, preferably over 40"", but a few smaller would be OK. They must hate me because I have been to Eagle Lake about 20x, can count them all on one hand, and the biggest was only about 36"". I've caught two pike over 40"" there on jig and minnow, geez."

Up to this point, my group has chosen to keep our Canada trips ""adult only'"" and not to allow anyone under 21 to join us. I'm cool with that considering the alcohol consumption and resulting discussions that follow. However, my son turns 21 next month and I'd like him to join us from now on whenever possible. I would really love to see him tie into a large walleye or pike to see what he'd do! You see, he's never been much into fishing but he has often joined me just to hang out together. He'd fish for a little while, then I'd look back and notice he had put down his rod and was messing on his phone or taking charge of the boat music instead. He's really fun to hang out with and has a great sense of humor. Who knows if it will ever happen. He'll be a senior in college this coming year and will likely head off to graduate school after he graduates. I might have to plan a separate trip just for the two us us. Tight lines!"

There is so much to talk about when you are in a boat ( captured audience ) that you both will have an awesome day....every day. You will find out things you never knew about your son. I took my son on his first trip to Canada when he was 10 and it was the best trip I've ever had. Over the years he has missed a few trips,but he is now going to be 22 and I'm thankful that he still wants to go this year with his old man. I'm hopeful that he will want to take me along in years to come. Before we know it, life will get busy for our sons and they won't have the time to go on a trip with us. I remember when my job got in the way for many years before I could go again with my Dad. I wish I hadn't missed those years with my Dad.

I've got the weapons, a prime lake with some excellent spots to try (thanks Mike Borger) and a good gps. I'm ready. Last but not least, I want my wife to have an especially great time.

Stay in the boat and not fall in the water 2. To not lose any fishing rods in the drink or step on any. 3. To avoid intestinal issues too far from camp 4. To make sure my BIL and best fishing buddy Doc avoids a heart attack this year. 5. To not break any ribs on the rocks (my orders are to stay in the boat- from Mrs. Hooks) 6. To not hook my fingers together (were you wondering why they call me Hooks?) 7. To avoid slamming the motor prop into rocks 8. To keep my depth finder attached to my transducer. 9. Keep it under 100 cigars for the week (Swishers) On the positive side: 1. Biggest decision of the day- you wanna fish there or over there? 2.

You could imagine, I hope to accomplish ACTUALLY arriving there and all the HOWS/WHATS that come with that.

Bring big boy pants, shorts are great unless the black flies are biting. If the flies are biting wear 2 pairs of socks. Your ankles will thank you. I can't stress quality rain gear enough.
