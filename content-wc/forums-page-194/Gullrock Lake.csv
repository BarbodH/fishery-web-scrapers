I didn't make the trip last summer, but was there two years ago and found it in good shape.I think the conservation practices have served everyone well over the years.I cannot imagine that this year will be anything short of another great trip, but I would also be interested in hearing any reports!We pull out for Canada in 25 days . . . but who is counting?Good luck!"
