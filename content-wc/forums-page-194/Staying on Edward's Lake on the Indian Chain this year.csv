I go to canada with my two buddies and their father, they've been going with him for 15 years and he's been going up there on and off(mostly on) for 35 years. They have been fishing a different lake every year pretty much that they've been going up there. They are more of walleye fisherman(jigging and back trolling) and I am more of a bass and pike fisherman(casting and jigging) even though we all enjoy fishing for all species. We are heading up to clarks resort on Edward's lake of the Indian Lake Chain. I was just looking for anything that can help us locate fish, any tips, locations, flowing water, dams, stream inlets etc would be awesome. Part of going to a new lake every year is the adventure, so we like to bounce around and explore, we will probably hit all the lakes we can on the chain and maybe some portages. We are mostly targeting Walleye, Bass and Pike during our stay of May 27th thru June 3rd.Thanks, Jack"

I haven't been there in quite a while but at that time there were NO pike. However, there was a very good population of muskies. Walleye fishing was good, as was laker fishing in Cobble. Also, a very good population of whitefish in Cobble and they bit quite well. We didn't catch any big walleyes but caught good numbers of nice ones. You should have fun. Good luck."

They got in about ten years ago.I fished the Indian chain many times up to about 8-9 years ago when I switched to staying at Clark's on Cedar lake. One of these days I am going to have to go back. I have been getting reports of very good walleye fishing with a good average size. I haven't ever fished it that early in the year. I would expect them to be mostly shallow. Weeds, wood, and rocks. Try a little of everything Trolling, casting, jigging, etc.. I've caught walleye on everything there from large musky down to small jigs with plastic or live bait.You should also find SMB and muskies."
5317681,IAWally,2017-02-06 23:42:00,38,Our group has been going to KC's for 7-8 years now great camp we will be arriving the day you leave. Talk to Jim when you check in he knows several places to go. It is relatively easy to fish you should do well. We are catching more walleye and bigger walleye every year. You will catch some Musky but the season will not be open yet make sure they are released ASAP. Never had any issues but the MNR has checked us several times over the years. There is also a sanctuary in Cobble that is not open to fishing that time of year be careful of that. Good Luck
