5561850,Bstar,2017-05-22 17:53:00,564,"Good luck to your wife, you and your family. Cancer not only affects the patient but it also takes an emotional toll on everyone around them. My wife went through breast cancer three years ago and luckily it was detected early and was a very curable type of cancer. She also went through surgery, then four sessions of chemo and then six weeks of radiation. Yeah she lost her hair and had to put up with all the stuff that goes with it but she was as strong as anyone could be while she went through the treatments. Her attitude from the get go was that she was going to beat it and she did. It also helps that we have one of the best women's cancer hospitals in the country at Northwestern in Chicago. So we just cross our fingers,knock on wood and say a prayer every time she goes for a mammogram. So far so good. So I'll say a prayer for your wife, you and your family that everything works out ok and that you make that July trip. Too bad your streak had to be broken but there are some things that are just more important than fishing. Good luck."
5563162,Golden Eagle,2017-05-23 08:17:00,2642,Thanks for the support and kind words.All is well on our end.Norma put the odds in our favor when she sought medical attention at the first hint of a problem.
5565090,515,2017-05-23 19:08:00,254,"Best advice ever is that early detection, so when you feel something is not right work the doctors and don't stop till you are convinced and happy that all is well. So many things if caught in the early stages can be dealt with. Glad everything is working out and fishing will soon follow for you. Not sure without you there who is going to bait Phil's hooks and take the fish off for him though......."
5565610,IAWally,2017-05-23 22:19:00,38,I will keep your family in my prayers.

5570177,515,2017-05-25 14:46:00,254,That's good hope you guys are having a blast up there.
5559457,Golden Eagle,2017-05-21 16:24:00,2642,"This week would have been my 33rd consecutive walleye opener on Little Vermilion Lake, but will be sitting this one out due to family medical issues.We're still planning to be there for the July 15 week.Early detection is in our favor for beating endometrial cancer. The success rate is in our favor. We met with our gynecological oncologist April 18, underwent a hysterectomy April 21 and will have a follow up visit June 1 to determine additional treatment, if any. I'm posting to strongly advise my fellow fishermen to take advantage of early detection if such problems show themselves in your family.We feel great about our situation, but waiting too long for the first doctor visit could have given us a less favorable outlook."
5559513,515,2017-05-21 16:47:00,254,Sorry to hear about the medical issues for your family and all the best towards a successful speedy recovery for her. Too bad you missed the opener but will be looking forward to your report when you make it up in the summer.
5559537,kzoofisher,2017-05-21 17:04:00,5144,"Very sold advice. Best of luck to you, oncology has come a very long way and as you said early detection makes a huge difference."

5560241,bigwalleye1,2017-05-22 06:01:00,2632,"Sounds like solid advice. As others have said, streaks can start again. Congrats on a sound decision, and on a 32 year streak. Here's hoping for the best results on both!!"
