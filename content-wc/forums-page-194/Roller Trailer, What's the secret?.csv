I had an old Crestliner Viking on a shorelandr trailer, that boat had high sides and a pretty deep V, and wanted the tops of the fenders just submerged. Current boat is a pro-v, also a shorelandr trailer, and that boat wants the trailer in until the front step on the fender gets wet, and no more. Another trick is to look at the placement of the back set of rollers. My Pro-V loaded cranky until I moved the rollers further out. (yah, I know, seems counter-intuitive, but it helped). A different Lund dealer told me that everybody thinks the keel will center better if they're close together. Separating them tends to settle the boat a little lower on the trailer and put more of the boat between the rollers."

5627418,Bobby Winds,2017-06-23 11:19:00,10817,"There are many factors that can effect your loading and most have already mentioned them. The important ones are in order: 1. Level launch pad 2. Not too deep in the water or the boat floats all over the place by the time you pull it out. AND # 3 that nobody has mentioned is - Is the boat pretty close to even weight distribution on the Port Side compared to the Starboard Side of the vessel, especially near the transom. A full livewell on one side can add over 200 lbs to that side........but their are other things like batteries, oil tank and so forth.........this side will be heavier when you load it and will go to the middle of the trailer more, making the lighter side of your boat higher on the trailer once you get it out of the water. Hope this helps you figure it out. Let us know if it improves for you. Bob"
5627594,REW,2017-06-23 12:42:00,40083,"In addition to Bobby's comments and actually similar to what he said. If you drive or float your boat on the trailer, keep the boat level by moving your self to what ever part of the boat that is necessary to level the boat. I have seen some really big dudes remain in their driver seat when driving a boat on the trailer that is listing badly due to the weight on the starboard side of the boat. Then, those same folks wonder why the trailer always loads to one side of the trailer. Move yourself so that the boat is level as it goes onto the trailer and you will be doing a better job of having a level centered boat on the trailer when done. Good luck"

5556890,reddemon,2017-05-20 05:03:00,39,"Got a new shorelander trailer, can't for the the life of me get the back end of the boat on straight, tried putting the trailer in shallow, deep, and still the back of the boat never sits right. you would think if the front comes on straight the rest would follow right? Not for me"
5556914,Clairebear,2017-05-20 05:20:00,937,It should be like you said. Try not cranking the nose strap down tight and also be backed in far enough so that the boat will self centre when you slowly drive ahead.
5557218,castnblast,2017-05-20 07:42:00,111,"You may be backing in too far. Back the trailer in, make sure it is as level as possible and make sure the rear rollers are just out of the water.I have had a shorelander roller for years and it is the easiest trailer to launch a load that ive ever had."
5557410,Guest,2017-05-20 09:26:00,0,"Guide ons and stay shallow, if your boat doesn't try to roll back in to the lake when your loading with a roller trailer your to deep."

5557937,Rock Hound,2017-05-20 17:58:00,51,"This is spot on advice! I have a Shorelander roller trailer. Great for landing in shallow water. It can be tough in a cross wind, current, or a landing that isn't level, but if you barely have the rollers in the water, you will get it dead center. Don't try driving it on like bunk trailers, you will need to crank it on, and it should center just right. I use a retractable dog leash at the landing to nose it in and pull it onto the rollers until I can clip the winch strap (usually about half way back)."
5558681,prov1800,2017-05-21 07:17:00,5010,"think its a matter of practise.but having the trailer fairly level is a must.i guide on different lakes sometimes daily so iam loading and unloading a lot.some launches are good some bad.you learn how far to back in with your mirrors according to the fenders.i mostly do this by myself.unloading I snap a rope to front take chain off,wrap rope around post then let boat back off till rope tightens andthen I take strap off.now just let the rope go and its gone.loading is very easy.just let the boat get on trailer it should line itself up.keep motor straight don't try to steer it up that will justscrew it up.just power up slowly.front will lift but gets to a certain point then front will come done.power up till you hit post.let engine run a bit to keep you from rolling back.go to front and hook your strap on.tighten .turn of engine and pull it out."
5558769,Bob/MN,2017-05-21 08:01:00,178,I installed a set of Smith side rollers. My boat is never more than one inch off of center when trailing. I run a 1600 lund fury tiller and do not power load.

5563306,mwh624,2017-05-23 08:47:00,183,As others have mentioned you are probably backing the trailer too far into the water. The back set of rollers need to contact the front portion of the boat in order to help center it.
