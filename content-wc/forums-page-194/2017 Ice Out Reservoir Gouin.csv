5574129,TheDFP,2017-05-28 04:30:00,39,I've dropped my reel handles through that dock in the last picture. Went swimming for it and got it on second try. It was no where near that high. That is the highest I have ever seen it.
5574265,tweedrules,2017-05-28 06:20:00,107,That must have been a cold swim
5575889,Doublelung76,2017-05-29 07:12:00,42,"As I posted on the gouin report,guys I went with were 30yr veterans,they said highest water ever.also toughest fishing.me and kid boated @200 eyes and 150 Pike.biggest pike 37"" eye 26 3/4"".not bad for the worst fishing ever,lol!!!dam was opened Friday and level should be dropping as we speak.good luck to all heading up this year."
5565050,Andre (wallyandre),2017-05-23 18:42:00,2274,I know this guy; he fish Baie Verreault. This is from last w-end. The 1st pic is from last week and the lake was still frozen. The water is normal for this time of the year.
5565786,Freytown,2017-05-24 05:43:00,770,"Kartman, I do know where that pic was taken and last spring there was very little shore dry. The background shore is very steep, so a vertical drop is all one would see.Despite the lower level, fishing should be very good with these conditions. Some shallow bays and short cuts may be high and dry. Watch for the rocks, I know where most are as I have hit most of them, lol. Good luck and save some Eyes for me."
5566202,Kartman35,2017-05-24 07:56:00,245,"The one thing the high water did last year was make it very difficult to get my boat out of the water. Where I fish there's a steep sandy boat ramp and not having a few feet of flat beach in front meant I couldn't get a run up and my pathfinder was unable to get the boat up. Luckily I won't be alone and if need be there's someone with a 3/4 ton diesel pick up and a length of chain that will get me out. Whether or not I return to the spot during the rest of the summer without at least one more vehicle will depend on how easy it is for me to get my boat out next week. Also, fishing was more difficult than usual last year as a result of the high water. Some guys in our group were saying it was the most difficult fishing they've seen there in 10 years. Of course difficult fishing at the Gouin is like easy fishing most other places so no big deal there. Bottom line, I hope you're right about the low water...I'm just not so sure that you are based on the photos and vids I've seen so far. When/where will you be fishing? When I get back I'll post some photos from the Baie Verreau area. BTW since I'm camping and keeping the fish in a cage, I'm going to do like you and gut them on site and filet/freeze them when I get home. Hopefully it will help the slime factor. Thanks for the idea. Kartman35"
5568625,a3dad,2017-05-25 06:27:00,115,"Just back. Water level is about 6 inches from capacity. It's the highest I've ever seen it. Water temps ranged from 48 F. (open water) to 54 F. (shallow bays) The bite was slow at first but improving. My buddy got a 37"" eye. Large pike were shut down. Largest was 36"". But lots of them. Good Week. Can't believe it's over already."
5570025,tweedrules,2017-05-25 13:31:00,107,"Do you think the water level is higher than last year? In my 10 years of gouin fishing, last year was the highest."
5570425,octanehi5,2017-05-25 16:50:00,1104,"a3dad great to hear you had a good early trip,Water level does sound high for the gouin, It will be dropping from now on. My crew is 30 days out of flying into Hebert"
5570433,a3dad,2017-05-25 16:54:00,115,"I didn't go to Gouin in 2016, so I can't compare, but attached are some pics of the high-water mark on a rock face (at Plamondon) and of camp East Saraana. Water level was still rising each day. Docks has to be raised a bit each day."
5570641,tweedrules,2017-05-25 19:11:00,107,Thanks for the pics. Looks real high. Don't think they built the fish house in the lake
5571713,Freytown,2017-05-26 09:33:00,770,"Thxs for the report. I guess the reservoir refilled with rain/snow melt, it sure looks full. Did you take a picture of the 37 inch walleye? That's a huge fish. Thx FT"
5573273,octanehi5,2017-05-27 07:54:00,1104,That's high water for the gouin. thanks for the posting

5554594,Freytown,2017-05-19 05:34:00,770,"Ron, it's the 21st century and you are still using mickey mouse sites for data. My images are from NASA and one shows ice as red and one as blue.Point out the ice for us dummies, lol. FT"
5554826,octanehi5,2017-05-19 07:29:00,1104,"I sent an e-mail to air tam to see if they are flying to Hebert, I await today's imagery also"
5554906,Freytown,2017-05-19 07:48:00,770,I reviewed your Great Lake images and you are confusing clouds for ice...black & whites images are very hard to interrupt. You should use the NASA sites in the future. Here's a link for future use. FT https://lance3.modaps.eosdis.nasa.go...hapais.2017136
5554986,octanehi5,2017-05-19 08:03:00,1104,I do know the first guys flew out this morning to the gouin's west side
5556506,octanehi5,2017-05-19 20:07:00,1104,"Just for your information Ice out on Hebert was today , There was ice on it the 16th,this was checked by float plane. Hebert will open next weekend on time Info from Air tam,This is only 2 days before last yr. A late Ice out Pre spawn,Spawn should be over by the beginning of the second week in June.about the same time last yr.Fishing in the south end of the lake in the shallows,will be good before they migrate to the deeper north side of the lake."
5563978,Freytown,2017-05-23 13:03:00,770,"I got a picture from May 16, the day the ice went off the Gouin. And as I thought, the water level is down and no where near last spring high levels. It takes a long time to refill this enormous reservoir. Plan accordingly. FT"
5564402,East coast,2017-05-23 15:07:00,32,"Hey Freytown, Looks like there is some conflicting information and pictures out there. Below is a link to a bush pilot forum (its French), in it the author says the water level is just about full and the pictures seem that way as well. I'll be there Friday so i guess either way i'm finding out Good luck!http://pilotes.quebec/forum/viewtopi...=20091&start=0"
5564530,Freytown,2017-05-23 15:42:00,770,"EC, good luck. I don't think that story is from this spring. I used a French to English translator: https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q...french+phrasesMy pic is legitimate as I know who took the pic. FT"
5564994,Kartman35,2017-05-23 18:25:00,245,"Or at least the author claims it is. (I speak french and there's no indication that this is from last year). The footage in his videos shows no beaches and water levels up to green bushes just like we had last year. And Freytown, the photo you posted doesn't really show us any signs of low water. I mean, unless you've been to the exact spot the photo was taken and recognize it as lower than usual there. I see no beaches along the distant shoreline in your photo. Looks like high water to me. Anyways I'll know for sure one way or the other Saturday morning . Won't be able to report back for solid week either."
5540609,East coast,2017-05-13 04:55:00,32,"It's looking better by the day. Some of the outfitters are starting to post some real time pics with comparatives from last year. Barrage Gouin had a plane up yesterday and took some pictures of the reservoir in the East section, closer to the dam. It looks well ahead of 2016 (by a few days). Our group targets mainly pike saving our walleye fishing for the twilight hours close to camp. Every year we land multiple 40""+ pike with the largest coming in just over 47"". Largest walleye comes in at 29"", 9 lbs. Less than 2 weeks and we'll be gator hunting....3 weeks from now, i'll be yearning for our trip in 2018! Shameless plug for our outfitter-Looking forward to seeing Francois and Martin at the Oasis du Gouin! Enjoy the opening boys!!!"
5540697,Freytown,2017-05-13 06:11:00,770,Thxs for the info East Coast. I agree we are ahead of last year. His FB site has current pic's and water levels seem normal. I hope they are? FT
5545914,Andre (wallyandre),2017-05-15 12:56:00,2274,The Gouin yesterday. Just a bit of ice on the north west side

5548530,Freytown,2017-05-16 14:21:00,770,Start Your Outboards....................YESGouin and Hebert ice free. Very early post spawn this spring. Good luck Friday 5/19 opener guys....save me some (6/8). FT

5552122,octanehi5,2017-05-18 05:51:00,1104,"sat pictures still show the gouin is frozen,as well as Hebert"
5552986,Freytown,2017-05-18 10:27:00,770,"OMG! Ron, what on earth are you saying this for? Air Tamarac won't like these false rumors you're spreading for the opener. Ice has been totally gone for 3 days now. What gives?How about a link or pic from your ""frozen"" satellite pictures."
5553082,vteye2,2017-05-18 11:11:00,123,"Hmm, people at the Gouin are saying its ice free and poster is 1000 miles away looking at outdated satellite photos."
5537257,Andre (wallyandre),2017-05-11 13:41:00,2274,In 2003 it was exceptionnal and they never will lower the reservoir that much. They lower it to do some work and combine with a winter w/o snow they got caught. I will try to find the infos but it's not easy.
5537265,Andre (wallyandre),2017-05-11 13:43:00,2274,Today:
5537305,tshea,2017-05-11 14:08:00,36,My satellite pic shows Mattawa bay open
5537321,tshea,2017-05-11 14:11:00,36,Mattawa Bay Gouin - 1985
5537401,a3dad,2017-05-11 14:57:00,115,Today's satellite image is very clear w/ no cloud cover. Air Tamarac's camps are in the western portion of the reservoir (circled area in the picture). So their report of the ice being mainly out is correct (at least for their neck of the woods). Water level is another subject. I think we're going to have to wait a week to really know the level. I'll be there 5/18-22 and will report when I'm back.
5537513,Freytown,2017-05-11 15:49:00,770,"Thxs for the input everyone. Yes, today's satellite image shows baie's Poisson, Mattawa and Saraana (partial) are opening up & before 5/19 will be clear. Day to day images can and do change alot.I'm sure Andre's quote of 82% means volume / capacity and not pool height. But based on the pic from 4/21 (attached) the reservoir is down a lot. Thxs FT"
5537913,Andre (wallyandre),2017-05-11 19:46:00,2274,"Yes, it was the lowest it ever been, almost like before it was a reservoir. I had a camp on the Nemio river close to Baie du Nord and couldn't access my camp because of the low water. In those years I had to go by boat to my camp. My god that make me realize how fast the time fly!!"
5538241,Freytown,2017-05-12 05:11:00,770,"You're going to love this location and if I was fishing that area in the spring that would be my first choice. A spawning area is at the back-end at the river mouth (from Lac Tessier) and is off limits until 5/27. There are restriction signs marking the prohibited area. If you stay in front of the signs and fish up the to Baie Saraana big water you should do very well.I fished that area with my son one spring and did good. Good luck. FT This is from the regulation book: baie Saraana (Gouin Reservoir Communal Wildlife Area) - between a straight line linking points 48°21'57"" N., 75°17'44"" W. on the west shore and 48°21'56"" N., 75°17'41"" W. on the east shore and to the west of the point 48°21'00 ""N., 75°17'37"" W. to the bottom of the bay south. 27 mai 2017 to 17 septembre 2017"
5538977,Doublelung76,2017-05-12 07:57:00,42,Thanks for the info FT.im happy to see the ice breaking up.i will follow with a report
5540129,TheDFP,2017-05-12 19:22:00,39,Doublelung. I have fished from that cabin a number of times. We did not go until early/mid June. We always did good. That time of year you can probably cast from the camp and catch walleye as they migrate out into the main lake. First class outfitter and we are going to Lac Hebert on 10Jun and will want a report on how the road is.
5522314,Freytown,2017-05-04 13:00:00,770,Opening day is going to be iffy???????
5526210,tshea,2017-05-06 10:39:00,36,I am heading up on the 19th to Mattawa bay. Major flooding along the ottawa and lievre rivers - hundreds of homes flooded - state of emergency -etc.. hopefully they will keep the water high at Gouin.
5534625,a3dad,2017-05-10 09:20:00,115,I reached out to Air Tamarac today concerned about opening day. Here's what they said.
5535433,Freytown,2017-05-10 15:03:00,770,"Too every question there are three answer: (1!)my version (2) your version and (3) the truth.My outfitter just messaged me : "" The road are ok and the water level is low. There is some snow and the ice is not gone."" So ?????????????????????????????I know from the pic I seen at the outfitter expanding his sea wall (my prior post) that the reservoir was down a lot and from satellite images it is still frozen. With 9 days to go the ice can be gone but the water level takes time to refill in a reservoir 60 miles wide and 40 miles high. I believe my outfitter and the images support what was said. FT"
5535441,Andre (wallyandre),2017-05-10 15:13:00,2274,"As for the level the person from Hydro-Quebec in charge of the dam mentionne 2 days ago that the level was at 82% full and to fill-up at the point they need to open the doors it's a question of ""weeks"". The situation is follow very closely because of the flood in the south. It's about the same thing for the Cabonga, Dozois and the other reservoirs. Luckily they lower the level just before the winter more then they do habitually."
5535817,a3dad,2017-05-10 18:53:00,115,"Hey Freetown, I posted AT's message before today's satellite image was available. I looked at it this afternoon and had the same reaction - it's still frozen!! I'm going with option #3. LOL Hoping it breaks up in the next day or two."
5536617,Freytown,2017-05-11 08:02:00,770,"Hi Andre, can you find out the current pool elevation?? Maximum capacity of the Gouin is at 405 meters or 1,329 feet. 82% of these levels would put the pool height at 332 meters or 1,090 feet....I find that very hard to believe. I was at the Gouin in 2003 spring and levels in late May were down 18-20 feet. That was unreal. Baies were connect by rivers it was so low.See if you can find current pool elevation. FT"
5536937,vteye2,2017-05-11 10:42:00,123,Freytown a huge reservoir like Gouin engolfs thousands of shallow acres -areas as it approaches full capacity. 82% sounds low this time of year but I would not presume its 82% of max height.
5536961,Doublelung76,2017-05-11 10:51:00,42,"Just signed up today,been reading threads for a while.my son and I are hitting gouin for the 1st time this yr. for the opener with AT.staying in cabins 15,16.Gonna fish walleye,but also gonna target old esox.i want a 40""+ gator for the picture book!keep the updates on ice out,lake level coming fellas!this site is a great wealth of knowledge and I appreciate all the info u veterans post on all subjects"
5536977,Kartman35,2017-05-11 11:01:00,245,First of all 405m is the measurement from sea level...not the depth of the Gouin. The reservoir is only about 60m deep max. Secondly the capacity would only be directly proportional to the depth if the shores were all perfectly vertical with a flat bottom
5511218,Freytown,2017-04-30 13:30:00,770,"Nothing gets me ready for my spring trip like watching the ice go out. I fish Baie Sud on the Gouin, last year was 5/23/16 ice out. Melt baby melt!!!"
5511354,East coast,2017-04-30 14:34:00,32,"Us too! can't wait, we arrive on May 26th. One outfitter just posted on April 28th saying there was still 4 feet of snow on the ground. Melt, baby melt! We're at the Oasis, great outfit, this is our 7th year returning. Makes the 18 hour drive from Nova Scotia worth it! Any others with information please share."
5512234,a3dad,2017-04-30 20:00:00,115,I do the same thing and was just looking at the same image on Worldview. I'm going to Plamondon Bay for the opener. Sure hope ice goes out before then! 2.5 weeks to go. Can't wait!

5517410,Freytown,2017-05-02 11:58:00,770,"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montre...094962?cmp=rssQuebec is getting a good soaking lately and flooding on the rivers Gatineau, Outaouais and St Maurice is causing majors problems for the locals. I believe the Gouin dropped quite a bit over the winter but all this rain coupled with the snow melt should fill things back up. FT"
5520154,Freytown,2017-05-03 15:24:00,770,The cloud cover over the Gouin has been daily. I like lots of hours of Sun to melt the ice pack but all we got is lots of rain and moderate temps. Maybe tomorrow will get another look. FT
5520202,Andre (wallyandre),2017-05-03 16:00:00,2274,All the doors at the dam are close since April 5th. They try to retain has much water they could to keep the St-Maurice river over flooding.
5520250,Kartman35,2017-05-03 16:23:00,245,I wonder how high the water level must be... It was already higher last year than I've ever seen. I'm sure there's some outfitters under water and hopefully Obedjiwan doesn't go the way of Atlantis.
5520298,Andre (wallyandre),2017-05-03 16:41:00,2274,They lower the reservoir in the winter. Just saw on the news: the Gouin is still frozen and they are still 3fts of snow in the wood. More rain in the w-end
5521274,Freytown,2017-05-04 06:09:00,770,"Thxs Andre, you are the Quebec expert in my book, lol. I have seen pic's from a Baie Sud outfitter page as he was extending a sea wall / breaker wall and it clearly shows that water levels dropped significantly during the winter hydro production.
