I haven't spent much time up north in June, but my uncle claims that it is around the summer solstice. He also claims that he has seen swarms of shiners around the shoreline spawning. Has anyone experienced this? Any info on the subject would be great. Thanks!Go_Fish"
509040,Tom,2000-07-14 13:20:00,1063,"They spawn early on LOW, if you are a US Citizen you are not allowed to take bait by any means."
509041,No_Fish,2000-07-14 17:23:00,6,"Dear Go_Fish, The University of toronto has a message board, that can answer questions like yours.www.zoo.utoronto.ca I know your not interested in going into bait business, only when the walleye would move inshore with them, the timing of that would be interesting. No_Fish"
509042,Go_Fish,2000-07-17 15:20:00,28,"No_Fish,Thanks for your input. You are right about the reasoning for my inquiry. I think that it would be really interesting to be on-site when the shiner spawn occurs. I did find a little info on Golden Shiners from a study done by The University of Arkansas, but this was related to commercially raising shiners, and not the wild spawn. Apparently, with this specific shiner you have to use very young spawning stock because of some ovarian parasite that is present in the older baitfish. It makes you hope that the ovarian parasite is specie specific, otherwise if it got loose on the wild population...look out!Let me know if you come up with any new ideas or sources of information.

5575121,Bill Krejca,2017-05-28 17:15:00,6107,"Back when I was a kid, and family fished the last 2 weeks in June on LOW, it was legal for non residents to trap minnows. It was also legal to use a drop net. So I did. Staying at Turtle Portage, we had all the minnows we ever wanted. We only kept shiners, was usually what the majority consisted of. Many of the shiners would spawn in the current which was present, and many of them which I ""caught"" has eggs in them, looking much like miniature bloated bass about ready to lay 'em out. Hooking a shiner sometimes resulted in getting a mess of eggs in the hand. The walleyes went absolutely crazy after these shiners. Bill"
5575145,Golden Eagle,2017-05-28 17:35:00,2642,Locate a shiner spawn. Don't share the location with anybody. Fish the area at least twice a day until spawn ends. You'll have one of your best ever weeks of fishing. Catching success will be outstanding.
5575161,Golden Eagle,2017-05-28 17:39:00,2642,"A few black flies will appear, followed by dragon flies and little yellow butterflies. That's the time to look for a shiner spawn. Fan cast the area away from the spawn, then as the bite eases up, move closer to spawning area to catch pike and walleyes.Locate a shiner spawn by casting shallow area close to river/creek mouth. If you see minnows leave the water, you've found your personal honey hole."
