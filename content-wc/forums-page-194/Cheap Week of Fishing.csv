Restaurants, bait stores, etc close by.www.facebook.com/SiouxNarrowsMotel/ I think there are grills for cooking.Nestor Falls may have similar options."

They're a boat-in and right in the heart of great walleye fishing. I can also vouch for Stokes Bay Camp on Rainy, as Camp Chef mentioned. They're a no-frills boat-in fishing camp, but I think they only have three cabins, so might be tough to get in in June."
