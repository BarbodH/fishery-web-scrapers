5573297,pjshorthorn,2017-05-27 07:55:00,5654,My apologies Pooch. Wedgie is quite the I never expected a simple request for gift ideas to take such a heinous turn. PjShorthorn
5573305,pjshorthorn,2017-05-27 07:59:00,5654,That is an awesome idea. I'm just not sure how much use it would get as he hasn't been a frequent fisherman over the years. He has heard me talk about Canada for 30 years and now actually has time to do it. I could always do the custom rod as a Christmas gift if he gets into fishing consistently. PjShorthorn

5573977,Rock Lobstar1,2017-05-27 20:49:00,134,How bout some nice rain gear? Could come in pretty handy up here and can also be used outside of fishing.
5571177,Wedge,2017-05-26 06:15:00,270,Thongs...great idea!

5571321,pjshorthorn,2017-05-26 07:15:00,5654,The backpack is an awesome idea for myself !!!! LOL Those sling backpacks are dang near hipster. Thanks for the suggestion. PjShorthorn
5571329,pjshorthorn,2017-05-26 07:22:00,5654,How much do those cute things go for ? I might need about 50 of them by June 21st.....all in XXXL. PjThonghorn

5572721,That Minnesota guy,2017-05-26 19:32:00,8293,"Have the rod custom built if you have time. Have his name, retirement date ect. put right on the rod. It's something he will cherish even after his fishing days are over. Do custom colors, colored thread, dress it up a bit."
5570921,pjshorthorn,2017-05-26 04:02:00,5654,"My BIL has recently retired and is making his first trip to Canada with me this year. I have been trying to think of a retirement gift that he would enjoy and get some use out of. He has a nice set of clubs and bag since he is an avid golfer, he has his own humidor for his cigars, he has enough Green Bay Packer gear to embarrass most anyone ( plus I can't bring myself to buy that crap ),etc...... So I'm thinking about a nice ML action rod and reel combo that he can use on the trip and hopefully for trips to come. What other ideas do you folks have in the $200 range ? PjShorthorn"

5570961,wallydave,2017-05-26 04:31:00,2151,Maybe one of Gords pink thongs? You know just for the kind of day when you want to feel the breeze! One of Breezy's boat urinals too!

5570993,gordy28,2017-05-26 04:51:00,437,Keep in mind I am talking in Cdn dollars so most likely cheaper in the US. I just bought a nice fenwick ml 7 foot rod and paired it w a shimano symetre from cabelas when they were clearing them out. All in about $225 Cdn and I love it. Also love that at that price point the fenwick has a limited lifetime warranty. CheersGordy
5571001,gordy28,2017-05-26 04:52:00,437,Edit. Rod was a Fenwick HMG

5571073,Clairebear,2017-05-26 05:30:00,937,"Maybe a little less expensive rod and reel combo, and a nice bottle of single malt Scotch that any good friend is sure to share with his best friend."
5571137,Mojo-NC,2017-05-26 06:10:00,1929,"The rod and reel combo is a great idea. If the trip up to Canada is going to become a regular thing, you might consider one of the nice backpack tackle bags and load it up with a few of the necessities like needle nose pliers, a jaw spreader, etc. These bags are really nice, especially if you have to portage. You can even hide that thong in there somewhere. A few examples in the link immediately below.https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/p...-backpacks.jsp"
