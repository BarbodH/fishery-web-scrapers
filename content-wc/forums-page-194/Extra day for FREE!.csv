Was fun calling the guys yesterday and asking. ""Easiest question I've ever been asked"" was one reply. Laughter followed by""What do you THINK, of course!"" was another. Have to bring a little more food and a lot more beer"

5566050,Bstar,2017-05-24 07:10:00,564,That's a good deal. Same thing happened to us a few years back with Amik Outposts. They asked us to fly in on Friday instead of Saturday because the group coming out wanted out on Friday. Who were we to say no? Amik saved on fuel costs and we got an extra day at no charge.
