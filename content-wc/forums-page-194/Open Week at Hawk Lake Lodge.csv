First thing first we flew into Winnipeg Friday am and made the quick 3 hour drive to the lodge. Despite the holiday weekend in Canada the traffic wasn't bad and the drive-to nature of the lodge is really easy since my dad is nearing his 77th year. As usual we arrived to the full service treatment as we were met at the lodge by Ted and our stuff was quickly taken to our room. After a quick welcome we headed to the cabin to rig up. Then we headed to the lodge for the open bar, appitizers, and dinner. The food was excellent. We especially enjoyed the baked chicken stuffed with blueberry stuffing. Fishing for Smallies Friday night was slow but we managed a couple in (20ft) deep water. Saturday the weather went to @#$%. Highs in the 40s with 15mph winds and a consistent drizzle. After searching the normal spots moving as slow as the wind would allow I decided to go ultra slow (and eat our lunch). I anchored about 20 ft off shore right on top of one of the main lake reefs in 6ft of water. We switched over to splitshots and floating jig heads with a minnow. We cast out and enjoyed our lunch as much as possible given the rain/wind/cold. Within 30 mins our patients paid off as my Dad picked up his 30. Within another 45 mins I picked up a 26.5. We took this presentation on the road and tried it in several other spots without success. Sunday was more of the same - slow fishing - a few big fish - oh and HAIL checked in for about an hour. TG the weather finally changed on Monday - Wednesday and the pattern changed over to jigs and minnows at super slow speeds. Sat 30 / 26.5 Sun 26.5 / 28 Mon 29/ (10) 26 / (3) under 21 / couple of bonus smallies / pike Tue 30 / 29 / (4) 26 / (5) under 21 / bonus fish 30"" pike / 19"" smallie / 26"" white fish Wed 28 / 29 / (3) under 21 / bonus lake trout Trophies (5 days) Walleye 2 - 30 3 - 29 2 - 28 Smallie 1 - 19 Overall for 5 days we had ~42 total fish. The trophy count was AWESOME. The staff at the lodge are excellent. The young guides are passinate fisherman and although I didn't use them I know they will be assets to the team at the lodge. The last boats off the lake most nights were the guides. I would like to thank Ted and team! I will be back next Spring! Brett"
