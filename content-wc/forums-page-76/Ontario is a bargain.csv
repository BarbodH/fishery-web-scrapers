6555766,yoopertrout,2021-04-29 11:25:00,1172,"I agree. Except for a couple days in driftboats with guides, all of my out west trips have been self guided. Ontario is a great deal."
6555768,yoopertrout,2021-04-29 11:26:00,1172,"Thanks. It sure is. I've been out a few times, but it's been too long."
6556194,krazyk711,2021-04-30 10:47:00,26,Ontario offers great fishing for the warm water species but the Far North excels in trophy pike and lakers. You get what you pay in life and the lakes in the NWT are special..hence the added costs.
6557074,RichA$1970,2021-05-03 12:21:00,1159,"I’d agree in added flight distance and then the need to be pampered with dining and guide service which I would never go for. American plans are not something I’d ever want or a guide as if the fishing is that good and you do some research, figure it out as sometimes being humbled makes you better or at least have to learn."
6557476,NM_Trout,2021-05-04 11:26:00,1094,"I don't think there is a better bargain in the world for a remote fishing trip than NW Ontario. We like to tend to our own meals and we don't need a guide. The outfitters that I have used have had awesome camps. Well built, mostly comfortable (LoL) and a hot shower is a luxury :-) We can get a week trip for less than $1500 pp. including float plane, camp, boats and gas. (quite honestly, I don't know how they do it). No ""American Plan"" for us. I love being solo with friends / family out in the middle of nowhere, and we set our own schedules (or not), sleep when tired, eat when hungry, and enjoy the ability to have completely uncensored conversations without fear of being overheard and recognized as knuckle dragging Neanderthals. Ontario trips are a bargain. I just hope that these camps can survive; in reading the new sticky on this forum section, it appears that the Canadian government doesn't fully appreciate their outfitters and the revenue that they generate. They will figure it out, and hopefully sooner rather than later. The thought of my favorite camp being permanently closed is completely heartbreaking. My family has a large emotional investment in that camp. We should be ready to see price increases for those outfitters who are able to survive. First, they will be in more demand, which will push up pricing. But secondly, I'm thinking about these operators who have taken an absolute beating WRT income. They will have loans and deferred bills that they have to get caught up on. I won't enjoy paying more, but I'm going to accept it and be grateful that I still have a camp to go to. Fingers crossed."
6557488,yoopertrout,2021-05-04 11:52:00,1172,"This was exactly my point in starting the thread. I don't know of any place in the world where you can get remote, high quality fishing for the price you can in N.W. Ontario. It's one of the best vacation bargains in the world. I really feel for the resort owners struggling through 2020 and this year. I can only imagine how tough it is."
6555084,prov1800,2021-04-27 12:09:00,5010,Sounds like a plan
6555088,Eckohlt,2021-04-27 12:12:00,3685,"or I could take 15 to 20 fly in trips in Ontario,Now that sounds like a better plan to me,just need the gates open yooper,I don't speak Russian so that's out,cruise is defiantly out,chopper fishing would be a blast,15 to 20 trips that's the way to go"
6555202,yoopertrout,2021-04-27 17:12:00,1172,Exactly.
6555308,vteye3,2021-04-28 07:34:00,496,We fished with 3 different outfitters in Quebec before committing to the much longer drive to (Nakina) Ontario. Pricing was similar for services rendered outpost camps fly in or very long boat ride in. Wollaston Lake like fishing still exists at 1/2 that price just have to figure out logistics. My unguided float fishing trips to Alaska offer world class fishing. I am not a guide other than to my buddies/sons.
6555366,Walleye2242,2021-04-28 10:17:00,263,I can fish in canada for 10 under a grand for that time. That is a cheap vacation. I love to fly fish and look at fly trips in montana and such..runs about 5 grand for like 5 days. Too rich for me.
6555378,Eckohlt,2021-04-28 10:33:00,3685,I'm heading to Montana end of nov or first week dec to get a trout fix
6555414,yoopertrout,2021-04-28 11:57:00,1172,"A friend and I keep trying to plan Montana trips, and having to cancel due to forest fires (I can't be around smoke.) Once I retire, we'll be able to go more on the spur of the moment."
6555416,Eckohlt,2021-04-28 12:20:00,3685,"Hope you make it out there yooper,it's great country out there"
6555474,phishfearme,2021-04-28 14:28:00,1242,"how many tags outfitters are allotted is not all that relevant - except for non-residents - and unlike fishing, residents (who can get their own moose tags) will pay for a moose hunt. the outfitters make their money on services to both residents and non-resident. phish"
6555574,Ricky Spanish,2021-04-28 19:11:00,1298,"Poor guy, but for some reason I'm jealous. I can't wait to get back out on Eagle. All one needs to do is pitch a jig and minnow and even a schmuck like me can land a 43"" pike or a 50"" musky while catching thousands of walleye and smallies. If I lived in the area like you, or were the least bit lucky, maybe I'd have a 48"" pike too. I've shopped around and found a lot of places have similar price points for the same amount of days but you have to look at what you're getting. A lodge that cares about it's staff as much it's customers is hard to come by and is really what we're all after. No fun fishing with a guide that just phones it in or paying for a stay at a fishing lodge that's run like a motel."
6554870,yoopertrout,2021-04-26 17:37:00,1172,"I wonder why it is that there are so many good deals on fishing vacations in Ontario compared to other provinces. Pike and Walleye camps in Manitoba and Saskatchewan seem on average to be way more expensive. Brook trout in Labrador are even more expensive. Char and Atlantic Salmon even more. I know that there are relatively fewer atlantic salmon and brook trout Rivers, and that the flights are a lot further for char. Still, I'm not sure that accounts for it. You can do a quality one week fly out in Ontario for under $2000, and a quality week long drive up for under $1000. I'm not rich, or a world traveler, but these seem like really good prices for what you get. It's hard for me to think of a better deal anywhere for a fishing vacation. What's the reason? Is it that there are more resorts in Ontario so the competition is fiercer? On a related note, I know of one lodge in Ontario that has brook trout fishing that approaches that of Labrador. They charge a lot for it, although still not as much as the Labrador Lodges. I see other Ontario camps that produce some nice brook trout, but they also tend to have pictures of full stringers on their websites. With brook trout, especially stream brook trout being as easy as they are to exploit, I wonder why more of these places haven't moved to catch and release so they can have even better brook trout fishing and maybe charge higher rates. These are not rhetorical questions, and I'm not looking to start an argument. I'm genuinely curious. I'm also grateful for the reasonable prices in Ontario, its proximity to where I live, and the memorable trips I've made there. Thank you."
6554882,That Minnesota guy,2021-04-26 17:49:00,8293,"I'll agree that prices in the past seem very fair, in some cases cheap. I would expect to see a price increase as many lodges won't survive these years. Less availability will equal higher rates I think."
6554890,Fisherman Ted,2021-04-26 18:03:00,461,Labrador lodges are all fly-ins and flights are indeed very expensive. Also the season in Labrador is roughly half as long as most in Ontario. 8-10 weeks. And most take just 6-12 rods per week. With the same overhead as a lodge that is twice that it translates into higher prices. They are not gouging or over-charging. Just the way it is. Colin McKeown could elaborate in much greater detail. -FT
6554910,KSjim,2021-04-26 19:04:00,88,"Having the good fortune to take fly-in fishing trips to many providences in Canada, value wise nothing beats a NW Ontario fly-in. Probably several factors involved, but with so many quality, walleye & northern, lakes in the region I always assumed that supply and demand was what made the pricing so competitive and reasonable."
6555004,adempsey2.0,2021-04-27 07:16:00,611,"A ""good deal"" is relative. I live in Ontario. We have 1000's of lakes all around us that we can drive to. So, if you have a boat you can go fishing basically for free. I have many friends who like to fish, but are not avid fisherman. They balk at the prices charged. I am happy to pay the $1500 to $2500 plus expenses for a great fishing trip. However, most just tell me that is more expensive than going to an all inclusive resort down south. So, they have no interest in going. Personally, I would pick a week fishing over sitting on a beach any day. I think that is part of why the industry is currently suffering. Getting local clients is difficult. As for Manitoba and Saskatchewan [and the territories as well], my observation is that most of these destinations are longer flights (that is a huge added cost) and also offer more ""perks"" such as guide services and ""5 star"" meal service. Generally just more 'luxurious' overall. Probably some of the best fishing you will ever have though, trophy lake trout and pike in particular."
6555012,prov1800,2021-04-27 07:36:00,5010,"You are right.Definatly some trophies and you get pampered.Totally diff clientele go there.Friend of mine guides at Wollesten lake.He says its pretty fancy.4 days 5000 bucks.That leaves me out. I'll have to put up with 35"" lakers and 48""pike in my neck of the woods and 50"" muskies in my neck of the woods.lol."
6555022,phishfearme,2021-04-27 08:28:00,1242,another item - as many of these NW Ontario outfitters will tell you - fishing holds us over till the moose season. check out what they charge for a moose hunting trip. break even on fishing and make your money moose hunting. you could say that moose hunting subsidizes fishing. phish
6555034,prov1800,2021-04-27 09:11:00,5010,Wrong there.Most NWO outfitters that get moose tags ony get a couple.Those tags are mostly way north to a outpost.All flying.. and tgeres only a hand full that get tags.irs not like they bring hundreds of moose hunters in like fishing.Look at a Alaska moose hunt.compared to one in ont.or check out the other provinces.Get a fishing trip to on that deal.
6555054,Eckohlt,2021-04-27 10:59:00,3685,"What's the number for that wollesten lodge? I'm going to sign up for a 16 day trip that's 20 thousand,I'll work an extra day for that,I'll let you know how it was"
6555078,yoopertrout,2021-04-27 11:58:00,1172,"Nah, go big or stay home. ;-) You can do a week of Atlantic Salmon fishing in Russia for 14k or a week on a cruise ship off the coast of Chile, helicoptering to a different river every day for 20k or so."
