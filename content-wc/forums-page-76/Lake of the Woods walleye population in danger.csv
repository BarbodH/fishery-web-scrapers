6556288,That Minnesota guy,2021-04-30 16:53:00,8293,I had assumed they did. I never have fished with one. Does Canadian DNR do spot license checks on the American charters? I'm assuming everybody would need a Canadian license.
6556312,Wallychowder,2021-04-30 18:00:00,1567,"Its MNR in CANADA. But anyway, I think the Canadian resorts on LOW should only be allowed to fish the Canadian side.......problem sovled !"
6556326,runuts2,2021-04-30 18:51:00,25,"Its really good to see the change in mentality when it comes to keeping fish. It used to be that bringing in the biggest fish possible was a badge of honor. I was guilty as well. Now I would not think of keeping any walleye over 18 inches and then only for an occasional meal, nothing goes in the freezer. Keep it up everyone, its the future of our enjoyment of a very special place in our hearts."

6557062,stumcfar,2021-05-03 11:51:00,451,I do not believe the MN Charters fish the Ontario waters. That would be quite a hassle with everyone needing Canadian license and checking to cross the border. Resorts up at the northwest angle and islands do have guides who do take people out in their guide boats and do fish Ontario waters though.
6557078,Wallychowder,2021-05-03 12:36:00,1567,The things people will do to cut 2 sides off of a walleye ?
6557252,txk4,2021-05-03 19:31:00,31,"Stumcfar- I believe you are correct. I do not know of any resorts on the south side that use the big charter boats that go into Canada. The NWA resorts customer's fish in either Minnesota or Canada. The guides in the NWA do take customers into Canada (when the border is open) In order to do so, everyone has to have a Canadian fishing license. They have to clear customs every morning, either by phone call or having an RABC. The guides have to have a Canadian Work Permit to take customers into Canada. I understand V Bay's comment. I suppose it is the same feeling when the locals in the NWA see the big charter boats from the south shore coming all the way up lake to fish. (wish they would stay on their own side of the lake!) The customers and guides in the NWA fish a small part of the lake and would have no effect on the fish counts in the Kenora, Souix Narrows or Morson areas of the lake. Obabikon would know if that statement is true or not and I would welcome his correction if it is wrong. As someone who frequents the NWA often, all I can say is that I don't make the border rules, all I can do is follow them exactly. As for MNR checking fisherman. It is a fairly regular occurrence, although we personally have been checked more frequently in the winter than the summer. In theory, in a week I could be checked by Ontario MNR, Minnesota DNR and have a Coast Guard check also."

6555988,AsianAngler,2021-04-29 19:27:00,67,"As an American who owns a cabin on LOW in Ontario, I found this thread interesting and disturbing. I fail to see how the report could be BS to get more funding. Especially, since this came from a resort owner. Surely, they must have to back up their reports with supporting data. My husband and I have been traveling to Ontario for fishing for over 40 years. We probably have not taken fish home to the US for more than 35 of those 40 years. It never tasted the same and it was a lot of trouble. And of course, eating them in the US certainly did not have the same ambience. Most years we purchased conservation licenses until they lowered the limit. We eat a lot of fish at a single sitting, though certainly not every day. As a result of the lower limits, we switched back to sportsman licenses. The end result for us was to target larger fish since we could only keep 2 a piece. We would've preferred eating smaller fish and saving larger, potential breeding fish, but if we kept the smaller ones, we might not have enough. Now, add a tough fishing day to that... maybe only one of us would eat. Since we own a home in Ontario and contribute much more to the local economy than your once-a-year resort fishermen, we do think it is a bit unfair that we are still held to the non-resident limits. This is a minor gripe.... the fishery is more important to us. I know that people are loathe to address native netting practices, but perhaps it requires an approach that gently points out that if they don't control their own practices, they will be losing a huge source of income. i understand the issue of deep water fishing, but I don't think it is well understood by the average angler. I myself, was unaware that there were devices that could help reduce the negative effects if used on fish taken from deep water. To be honest, I still don't know a lot about it. Perhaps this is an opportunity for education. Finally, I was surprised that no one mentioned stocking. Is there some reason that stocking could not be done?"
6556036,rockpt,2021-04-29 23:42:00,589,"This is right. Put the big ones back. Just having this discussion will educate some anglers and make a difference. When I started fishing in Canada in the 80s the muskie was almost a mythological creature, but after a strong C&R campaign and raising the size limits along with education about proper handling and release techniques, anyone can catch a muskie now with the right equipment and a little know how."
6556078,prov1800,2021-04-30 06:47:00,5010,"It's amazing to have seen and fished lakes back in the 80,s.Lac Suel and Eagle are 2 big bodies of water that were called the dead seas.Its really amazing how they came back and i got to watch it slowly happen.Lac suel is just amazing but in my option 10+ years ago it was better than it is now.Not so much catching quantities but size wise.Yes still can get lots of 25""+ but the larger 30"" walleyes have been hard to come by.Eagles numbers are crazy but I find there are huge numbers of 13-15"" walleyes all over the lake.Still pull up some larger fish but tons of small ones everywhere you stop.Slot size is working well though.Id love to personally see no fish kept over 18"".ive seen a lot of 23+"" hit the cĺeaning shacks."
6556088,Wallychowder,2021-04-30 07:08:00,1567,"I'd like to see no walleye over 16"" kept. A 14"" to 16"" is the best eaters anyway !"
6556106,v-bay gord,2021-04-30 07:31:00,3168,Interesting that you see a lot of 23 plus walleyes being filleted on Eagle. Must be camp specific. Most camps I am familiar with have some sort of policy in place about keeping or cleaning fish over the slot limit. I would be disappointed if a camp was turning a blind eye to it. Very short sighted.
6556112,txk4,2021-04-30 07:47:00,31,"I have found this thread very interesting. We own one of the cabins at Flag Island and for the last 10-15 years have made the trip to the Northwest Angle 4-5 weeks a year in all different seasons. We fish Minnesota and Canada (when allowed). I certainly have an interest in doing whatever can be done to protect our fishery on LOW. I do wish Minn and Canada had the same regulations. When it comes to barotrauma, I was one of the ignorant ones starting out and have become very aware of it over the years (partly thanks to Walleye Central). I found this discussion very helpful and informative about barotrauma and walleye management:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBSsJdB10_Y. If the link does not work, search for walleye behavior and science on you tube. One observation I would make as we have seen more customers and fisherman coming to the NWA is that 20 years ago, we had areas that were spring spots and than summer spots and than fall spots. This is still true to a degree, but with everyone having good electronics and GPS, many of these spots get fished all year round, the common reefs may get hit almost everyday, some multiple times. It is harder to have a ""secret spot"" and I believe this active pressure has changed these spots. Whether it affected the overall number of fish or if they just changed their patterns I do not know. I would also say that my experience is that most walleye fisherman (or crappie fisherman) are looking to get fish in the livewell. Either to eat in camp or take home. I don't think this is wrong, but this is why the regulations have to be set to protect the fishery. The bottom line is that LOW is a special place and while things are always changing, it deserves our protection and attention."
6554796,MrSimon,2021-04-26 13:23:00,922,"I'm a huge believer in slot limits and very low creel limits. I understand there are people who want to take home a bunch of fillets, but .... NW Ontario is such a special place that maintaining a good healthy population of fish is more important than filling freezers. Many lodges have moved to very conservative limit rules .... they lost a few groups, but overwhelmingly have found guests to be very much in favor of the new rules."
6554812,Canadian fisher,2021-04-26 14:21:00,97,"I don't think I will ever understand this mentality. Surely Americans can catch their walleye limit on their side of the border with ease. If they lowered it to say 1 a day on LOTW, how does that deter anyone from coming up here? You can still have your shore lunch which I understand how important that is but surely you spend $1000's to come up here for other reasons like the peace and quiet with added amazing good fishing and scenery. Like spend $25 on your way home and buy your limit. I fish Musky a lot here and cant imagine some of the stories I have heard from Americans fishing them South of the border on the weekends with boats lined up to take their turn on a spot. Barf! I agree with the above poster that fishing too deep does a lot of damage for walleye and crappie. Was on Regina bay one fall and had a convo with some yankees fishing walleye at White Birch when it was still open. They had done well with 3 big fish in an afternoon 28"",29,28. So we were chatting and I asked them how deep. They were fishing 45 feet off of a hump. Thats 3 dead trophy walleye. People just don't get it sometimes until its too late. Now all that being said netting is the major impact by far, can't tell you how many nets I have run into on LOTW with rotted fish, left unchecked and killing everything that comes its way. Horrible!"

6555008,v-bay gord,2021-04-27 07:25:00,3168,Perhaps it satisfies our inner hunter / gatherer instincts to have a freezer full of 4 year old walleye fillets....that we eventually give away to the neighbor...?
6555024,stumcfar,2021-04-27 08:39:00,451,"On the Minnesota side of LOW, charter boats by the dozens are making 25-35 mile trips to areas to get customers their fish. They are there to take limits, not catch and release. They are fishing areas that 20 years ago had very little fishing pressure. In the winter these same resorts are plowing 30 mile roads and then plowing out spots for wheel houses. It looks like summer campgrounds, from drone pics I have seen. Hundreds of wheel houses in areas that used to be only accessed by a few snowmobilers. Resorts are in the business to make money, but I have to believe all of this pressure has a negative effect on the entire lake. Time will tell. From my experience, there are loads more big fish caught now and a lot of 13"" and under caught. The 14""-18"" fish seems to be getting more scarce. I used to be in the crowd that had to take home a limit every time we went and I think that is the mentality of 90% of the MN side of LOW fisherman. I have gotten past that and our Ontario fishing trips are for getting away and for good fishing. We take a few each day for shore lunch, but keeping fish is not our point in taking the trip."
6555772,yoopertrout,2021-04-29 11:45:00,1172,"I agree with this. The last time I went, we ate a couple meals of walleye, and one person took a few fish home.

6554036,Guest,2021-04-24 13:19:00,0,Fishing on Eagle in the 80's was very tough in the 80's till they put the slot size in.
6554046,prov1800,2021-04-24 13:52:00,5010,Jared.Last 2 seasons on Eagle we had a 2 daily possession limit on walleye.This made it tough on guests to take their limits home if they chose to do shore lunch.Most wanted to do shore lunch and not bother taking a limit home so that's a positive deal.I beleive lotw has the same rule right.
6554064,Ruddiger,2021-04-24 14:43:00,649,"Howdy, I think that netting aside (which clearly has an impact despite assertions to the contrary) harvest during the ice season is also a significant factor the often goes under assessed. In some eastern ontario waters, hard water harvest is far more detrimental than soft water harvest. That said, another culprit that I see on the water is fishing too deep. When I am on LOTW in July- September I regularly see fish too deep to ethically target despite being walleye. With todays electronics, spot lock, etc, it's too easy for angles to accidentally kill fish while thinking they are practicing catch and release. After a few days of ""great fishing"" like that they have likely accidentally killed more fish in a week than they intentionally harvested in a decade. Take care, Ruddiger"
6554068,prov1800,2021-04-24 14:52:00,5010,Great topic which i mention often but it's usually a topic for a argument.So I just don't bother the minute you get a group where you get bad vibes.I just stick to my 25 ft or under.Like you said its to easy to pick off fish deep and basically there all smaller fish.2 guys in one boat catching 30-60 fish in 40 ft is 30-60 dead Fish.
6554070,Obabikon,2021-04-24 15:06:00,2370,"Yes. They have had the 2/day 4 total for 15 years or more. I find that most guys are fine eating one walleye and maybe throwing a perch in it. I'd like them to go more towards a measuring system.... like you can keep 2 - 12-13"" fish for lunch OR 1 - 17"" fish. As a fishery goes... it is easier to replace 2 small walleye than it is to do a 17""+. Rather than just slot limits or lowering limits... do something that encourages fewer fish to be taken. Also, get rid of the 1 - over 18""... all of them go back, they're the breeders. Just my thoughts."
6554084,v-bay gord,2021-04-24 15:42:00,3168,"I agree, but actually the slot limit (Eagle is none between 18-23) does in a way encourage fewer fish to be taken because very few people will bring in something over 23 to be cleaned. This is due to some fellow angler peer pressure, but also most lodges have some policy or incentive that discourages the practice. The ""one over 18"" rule seems to encourage throwing in one big fish for the limit.....not good in my mind. The 2 day limit was widened a few years ago...while I think they could have done something else I think it is positive in terms of reducing fish harvest. Now the deep water stuff is definitely something we all need to work on..."
6554126,Guest,2021-04-24 18:14:00,0,The 2 a day limit is only for non-residents. 4 for residents.

6554212,prov1800,2021-04-25 06:28:00,5010,Deep water fishing in my opinion does more damage than anything else.
6554220,LOWrider,2021-04-25 06:34:00,40,"Does anyone know if the actual risk assessment details can be found anywhere online? I did some searching and haven't found anything. Minnesota has a very detailed plan that includes their survey data, but nothing from MNR. I agree with the comment that you can't really think of LOW as one lake, hence where have they surveyed? (Have they actually done netting surveys or just creel surveys, etc.?) I've always thought the 2/4 limit system Ontario has is a good one. It seems that it is a nice balance from overly aggressive/restrictive limit systems that either damage the fishery or damage the businesses who have to attract customers willing to drive for two days and leave their thousands at the resorts and businesses. Slot limits or other mechanisms are just ways to protect spawning fish - all good with me. I won't let anybody keep anything over 17 anyway in our boat. We also religiously adhere to the Ontario rule of no party fishing. Our friends are sure to hear ""Catch your own D@mn fish"" from me at some point. All good things in my opinion, and frankly makes it more fun and challenging for them. RABC - Don't really know what restricting that would accomplish. I understand the sentiment (and don't really care either way) but if someone is going to break the rules they'll break them anyway. In the end it's just a phone call if there isn't a RABC - not too big of a deal. Who knows what the decision makers will have in store for that anyway. I too would be in favor of MN and ON having the same creel limits (2/4) to take this out of the concern category - but good luck with that!"
6553368,Obabikon,2021-04-22 18:00:00,2370,"Interesting study. I had heard some of these concerns. However, I will say that we have not seen a dramatic decline in fish caught in the area."

6553766,Bill Krejca,2021-04-23 16:48:00,6107,"Not all areas appear to be as hard hit by the netting, Obabikon's area is far enough away from easy transport of the product(fish), so little netting degradation is experienced in that area. As in all businesses, logistics play a part in delivering the product, in this case, fish, to the destination. Requirements include access to the water, ice or equivalent, vehicle to transport, some type of packing and disposition depot(in this case Kenora), etc. Reminds me, though, of how the impediments could be overcome - I used to fish Saskatchewan. One of the best walleye lakes in that area had to be portaged into. At the end opposite the portage was where the majority of walleyes spawned. An ice house had been constructed nearby, lake ice was loaded into the ice house in the winter. Come May spawning time, several families camped there for a number of weeks and ran many long gill nets. Every so often, a plane would stop by and pick up the product(fish). I remember my best day fishing in the bay, sitting in a snow storm, alternating fishing and getting out of the wind, I personally caught 63 walleyes, but none were over perhaps 18"", or whatever the net squares allowed.

As Bill mentioned, LOTW is a huge lake and could be overfished in certain areas and doing fine in others. I don't see how one report can generalize the fishery of the entire lake. But if the fishery scientists are concerned, we should take notice. I started fishing at Lake Nipissing in the late 80s. It was a thriving walleye fishery, but by the early 2000s my brother would go up for a week with the guys and the entire group would be lucky to catch a couple dozen for the entire week. Limits were too big combined with heavy recreational pressure and heavy native netting. It would be **** shame to see that happen to LOTW."

It recovered, and today is doing very well, according my understanding. Other lakes have similar histories, and. like life, seem to experience their series of ups and downs. Bill"
6553950,v-bay gord,2021-04-24 08:50:00,3168,"Actually, the most noticeable decline seemed to come in the 80's, but things happen over time and it's a cumulative effect. As shown on Eagle Lake things can turn around fairly quickly with some innovative (and controversial at the time) regulation changes. There has been a significant attitude change since then as well. No matter the reasons, we should always be trying to improve our fisheries."
6553990,prov1800,2021-04-24 11:49:00,5010,"I do remember fishing Eagle in the 80,s.Started guiding then for Bear Traik Lodge as well as Little Norway camp now of course being Vermilion Loodge.Definatly tough days on the water on both the the north and west end and the east side.Tough shore lunch days so was a good thing i figured out how to catch whitefish which seemed to be in good supply.Its amazing how Eagle has come back since those years.I regularly fish there now and its totally opposite of those days.Catches are crazy daily."
6554034,Obabikon,2021-04-24 13:17:00,2370,"To be honest, I think one of the first things should be doing away with RBC's until the US side install's a matching fish limit. Accompany that with a system that encourages people not to take limits home with them (drastically reduced cost of conservation licenses). From there, limiting the commercial fishing on the lake would also help. I have had some internal discussions about this study, and there are certainly some questions about how accurate this is. Even if it is overstated, certainly last year, and this year will help walleye harvesting. This is a manageable problem, but I am 100% supportive of tackling the issue before it gets bad."
6553244,MN_Moose,2021-04-22 12:37:00,964,"Apr 22, 2021 Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has revealed that the Lake of the Woods walleye population is in danger and that its current fisheries are not sustainable, spelling serious trouble for the local economy. The revelation follows a province-wide risk assessment done by the MNRF between 2015-2017, showing that Lake of the Woods is the most at-risk inland fishery in Ontario, both in terms of likelihood of collapse and the resulting social and economic impacts that will follow. Out of over 40 lakes surveyed across the province, Lake of the Woods was the only one to clearly fall into the danger zone of the MNRF's risk assessment. Lake of the Woods walleye population in danger The Miner first reached out to the MNRF about this story on April 9. In a response issued back April 21, the MNRF said that the current walleye population is approximately half of what is needed to sustainably support current levels of harvest. Lake of the Woods stands out quite significantly from everything else that we evaluated in the province, said Steve Bobrowicz, the MNRF's regional fisheries specialist for northwestern Ontario in a video presentation during the Rainy-Lake of the Woods Watershed Forum last month. From our netting surveys, we are seeing that the walleye population within the Ontario waters is consistently showing that it's in poor shape. The population is over-exploited and the economic value of our fishery is in jeopardy if we continue harvesting at the current rates. The MNRF told the Miner that the amount of recreational walleye fishing alone on Lake of the Woods is too high to be sustainable, before either commercial or subsistence fishing also comes into the picture. Recreational fisheries are worth a total of roughly $112 million a year to the local economy, with several First Nations commercial fisheries also ranging in the low millions. In response to the problem, the Lake of the Woods Fisheries Advisory Council was formed in late 2019 to develop fishery management plans and regulatory actions. The council consists of 21 people including local anglers, members of the tourism industry and Indigenous communities. However, COVID-19 impacted the group's ability to meet and over the course of the summer of 2020, no movement was made. Remote meetings resumed in January of this year, and by May the group is hoping to finalize regulations to be put in place on Jan. 1, 2022. We're following a pretty standard basic planning process, an adaptive management planning process, said Bobrowicz. We're currently at the stage where we're looking at what regulatory options are going to meet the objectives that we've established for the plan. In the presentation, Bobrowicz added that he is unable to share specifics about the meetings but that the group is looking at all options to reduce walleye mortality and increase the biomass of spawning-aged walleye. Bobrowicz said that the group also has socio-economic objectives in mind, including treating all recreational anglers equally, protecting the local tourism industry and providing more opportunities to fish other species. Potential options for the council include changes to catch limits and seasons, as well as non-regulatory actions like education and further research. We've undertaken a pretty aggressive approach to management planning, Bobrowicz said. It's a very tight timeline and has, frankly, never been taken on with this speed in Ontario before. But we're on track for trying to make some improvements in the long term [for] Lake of the Woods. This is an alarming situation."
6553246,Flip Silverlake,2021-04-22 12:49:00,645,"It's funny there's no mention of the amount of netting that's being done on that lake. Totally unregulated. I witnessed the setting of a 1000 foot net just east of Scotty's Island in 2019. What are they going to do drop the limit to one a day?? Between this flu and major changes in the limits they're gong to turn Kenora back into a logging and gold mining town, like it was the first time i was up there in 1962. If anyone thinks for 5 minutes that people are going to drive 1000 miles just to play with a boat when gas is $8.00 per gallon US your just kidding yourself."
6553248,MN_Moose,2021-04-22 12:51:00,964,Just spoke with a camp owner. He said all of it is B.S. MNR wants more funding.
6553258,Wallychowder,2021-04-22 12:57:00,1567,"Well, with the price of Gold ! Sign me up !"
6553262,RichA$1970,2021-04-22 13:08:00,1159,"Eliminate the netting. Also, the fishery should have low pressure again 2021 thanks to our leaders."
6553286,Wallychowder,2021-04-22 13:42:00,1567,They lower the Limits again there's going to be more to worry about than the walleye population !
6553334,prov1800,2021-04-22 16:40:00,5010,Iam sure some one looking for many.got to do studies.Everyone already knows the answers.Ill touch on another veiw.Over the last 10+ years or possibly longer ice fishing has increased like crazy.Just as many people fishing in the winter with all the ice huts that are rentabĺe.But I dont think lots can be in trouble.Slot and limits should be doing the trick.It did for eagle.and with last year and possibly this year with border closed it will be awesome next year.
6553342,Wawajake,2021-04-22 16:58:00,413,Have seen around here NE Ont. with similar concerns regarding netting and pitting Natives against recreational fishing. Native commercial fishing continues with no change. Abandoned nets left for weeks with dead fish is reported every year. But sadly Government is too afraid to challenge the supposed treaty rights. I would be very surprised to see it handled better in NW Ontario.
6553358,Skywagon,2021-04-22 17:40:00,1106,"You have the right answer Wawajake, the natives (by treaty) are allowed to take as much fish and game at any time they desire, even endangered species, there are no rules to regulate them, plus much more. Lots to be said, similar situation is happening in the US, but it is not correct to talk about."
6553366,LoDo,2021-04-22 17:55:00,721,"Seems like the natives, if they choose too, could put the entire NW Ontario fishing tourism industry out of business."
