It was going to be a sunny day with temperatures forecast to be in the upper 60's, with little wind, a perfect day to get in the water (with chest waders) to put out the floating docks and get the water line in the lake. I had hoped the water level would have come up some, as the floating docks were mostly sitting on land a month ago, fortunately the water had risen enough I was able to use a 2x4 to skid them into the float mode. After getting the docks installed I retrieved the pump from storage and ran the water line (with temperatures still getting below freezing at this time of year I did not connect the line to the cabin). The next time to the cabin there will be a load of stuff to take and more things to do, all the perishables that get taken out in the fall will have to be replenished, the boats and motors will come out of drydock and the boat ramp has yet to be installed. These are all things that are missed out on when you come up for a week of fishing, the lodge/outfitters do spend some quality time getting ready for you guys. Saying that, I am sure some of you would enjoy it, all part of the package when you have a remote cabin.My wife took a picture as I was taking off from home, the other is after the docks and water line were in at the cabin."
