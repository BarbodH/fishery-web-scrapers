6558760,v-bay gord,2021-05-07 15:54:00,3168,"Ah, Stumfar, you are a wise man...and I stand corrected. Apparently I was looking at a Labatt's bottle pre 1995. What's the world coming to when you can't hold onto tradition.?"
6558778,Wawajake,2021-05-07 16:45:00,413,"Last summer after flipping back and forth between various Canadian Beer, I stumbled on Sleeman 2.0 beer. It is a Ontario company , brewed in Guelph Ont. It is ok price and found in Beer Store and Licensed Grocery stores . I never was a Labatt drinker, preferred Molson from young age, anyone remember Molson Golden ? Excellent obviously I did not drink enough they discontinued it's many decades run awhile back ! I tried the Coors Light (Canadian version ) but around her it is called Girls Light. &#x1f642; so dropped that one . On the topic of beer, why has it become more common for people to puralize Beer to "" Beers"" . It just sounds weird "" beers"" . When I go hunting for Deer ,I don't hunt for Deers. ......oops might of started a debate !"
6558794,Wallychowder,2021-05-07 17:02:00,1567,you sure do hunt for Deers ! Are you singling out 1 particular Deer ?

6558802,Wallychowder,2021-05-07 17:06:00,1567,2.0 beer ? You might as well drink N/A beer
6558806,Wawajake,2021-05-07 17:14:00,413,"no it is 4 % beer , the 2.0 is low calorie count. I need that for the paunch control . &#x1f642;"

6558688,v-bay gord,2021-05-07 12:01:00,3168,"Interesting point of fact but it appears that the imported version of ""Labatt Blue"" is dumbed down for your average American beer drinker. Up here it's labelled ""Labatt's Blue"". I don't believe it's the same beer either."
6558690,Eckohlt,2021-05-07 12:08:00,3685,When I use to drink your beer made me fall down more
6558704,Wallychowder,2021-05-07 13:01:00,1567,So i was right ! Labatt's
6558710,Wallychowder,2021-05-07 13:18:00,1567,It's not the same beer !
6558712,stumcfar,2021-05-07 13:29:00,451,"Labatt BluePilsener-style Lager, 5.0% alc./vol.(4.9% ABV for Bleue in Quebec)Labatt Blue is the best-selling Canadian beer in the world. Introduced in 1951 as Labatt Pilsener, it was named for the colour of its label by fans of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers football team. Blue was the first brand in Canada with a twist-off cap and won the silver medal in the International Lager category at the 1998 Brewing Industry International Awards. Labatt Blue, brewed using specially selected aromatic hops, is a well-balanced, fully matured, full-flavoured beer with a fruity character and a slightly sweet aftertaste.Not sure V-bay? You may have insulted Americans incorrectly???From my understanding it is the same beer recipe but processed differently between the states and Canada. I believe Labatt's became Labatt in 1995 when the company was sold."
6558716,Wallychowder,2021-05-07 13:37:00,1567,"And by the way it's not the same beer. Different breweries, different Alcohol content, one has no preservatives, the other one doe's"
6558722,stumcfar,2021-05-07 13:49:00,451,"Both labeled Labatt Blue though. So, the Labatt Blue in Canada is brewed by us (AB), and the Labatt Blue in the U.S. is brewed by an entirely different operation. Ostensibly, they're the same recipe, but in practice that is never true."
6558728,Eckohlt,2021-05-07 14:07:00,3685,"No matter what country your drinking it in if you drink enough of it,you can become a mess"
6558584,v-bay gord,2021-05-07 09:10:00,3168,"Maybe this topic should be changed from ""Canada Eh"" to ""Canadian Wine""......"
6558594,RichA$1970,2021-05-07 09:17:00,1159,"When the borders both open, I wonder how much more time it will take to clear customs based on the probability of extra criteria the agents will have to perform.I think I will plan to hit the border at 0100 to avoid the traffic jam."
6558598,That Minnesota guy,2021-05-07 09:22:00,8293,Plan to hit it in 2022 and you will be fine.
6558602,Bobby Winds,2021-05-07 09:25:00,10817,"Years ago I was at my nephews wedding reception in Niagara on the Lake, Ont and had some of their local wine. Very good but I really didn't care for the ""Ice Wine"" as it was way too sweet for my taste. All the women loved it..........so I'm sure TMG would like it too.......LOL"
6558612,Wallychowder,2021-05-07 09:38:00,1567,Forget the wine .....I'll have a Labatts !!!
6558616,That Minnesota guy,2021-05-07 09:39:00,8293,Thought you never went to Canada or was this before they kicked you out?
6558618,v-bay gord,2021-05-07 09:44:00,3168,"Sorry, should have been more specific....""Canadian Whine""."
6558620,Bobby Winds,2021-05-07 09:45:00,10817,"TMG, you need to sharpen up those reading skills. I have said many times I have been to canada 100's of times so yes this was before they kicked me out for going the posted speed limit. When did they go to Km/h instead of MPH . . . LOL........that would be good info at the border.......LOL"
6558646,Eckohlt,2021-05-07 10:32:00,3685,Plenty negativity
6558652,3M TA3,2021-05-07 10:38:00,2846,No picking on your spelling but it's Labatt.
6557862,Wallychowder,2021-05-05 09:42:00,1567,"Well, thats enough information for me !...........I'm canceling !"
6557884,Flip Silverlake,2021-05-05 10:33:00,645,I wouldn't be putting any money down for year either.

6558136,Obabikon,2021-05-06 06:37:00,2370,lotsoffish1... please don't. All that does is get the thread deleted.
6558142,Obabikon,2021-05-06 06:44:00,2370,"https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/tour...avel-1.5415294 Everyone that wants to be vaccinated will be vaccinated by September, so we're really talking about after that, what can be done and we'll always follow the public health advice, Joly said. I would love to believe that there's a chance. Minister Joly is not the person making the decision, but she certainly is close enough to the inner circle that she should know their real goals. I don't think there's much of a chance before September."

6557854,Eckohlt,2021-05-05 09:35:00,3685,If it's a go we can work it out not a prob
6557518,@Lunker,2021-05-04 13:11:00,835,Our Ontario camp owner shared today that supposedly the government is supposed to make a determination by and share with them on May 15th what the border opening situation will be. Just sayin'....
6557522,johnboat,2021-05-04 13:27:00,2014,"I'm not real optimistic but my owner seems to think things might possibly be turning around as well.It's kind of hard to believe, but I'll go with it.He mentioned possibly August. There'll be a few hoops to jump through, but I'll sure give it a go."
6557526,kettyspanky,2021-05-04 13:34:00,271,That will hopefully be some good news for the camps and resort owners. They might finally get an idea if it pays for them to open for the year or not. Also might give them some much needed revenue. Fingers crossed.
6557532,Hookhunter135,2021-05-04 13:56:00,129,I just read Saskatchewan’s plan. They have a 5 stage system. Stage 5 being lift long term restrictions. They have themselves slated to be at stage 4 by July 21. If things go well maybe fingers crossed for August with a vacc passport.
6557536,That Minnesota guy,2021-05-04 14:03:00,8293,"Nope, won't happen."
6557542,prov1800,2021-05-04 14:10:00,5010,Only hear that they will let owners in.Don't get to excited yet.
6557564,Eckohlt,2021-05-04 15:33:00,3685,"It's a go for fall,we are back"
6557566,That Minnesota guy,2021-05-04 15:35:00,8293,"I'm not getting excited. I said months ago it wouldn't be until 2022 that the border opens. People keep hoping and the date keep moving towards fall. I understand the hope, but look at it realistically. If the border opens in August does it really save anybody? I think not. If these resorts don't get the months of June & July part of August and a bit of Sept. isn't going to save them. If that in fact is the case why would the government rush to open up? I don't see the point. Keep hoping and praying for the best but I would make alternative plans."
