We are staying on the east side of Leech at Sugar Point Resort having many years ago fished this side of Leech in the Federal Dam Area. We have hired a Guide for a day and hope to catch some walleye. We have a trip booked with Mattice at Ogoki Reservoir for August 16-23,if border isn't open by this time we will defer to a week in Sept .If border still not open will push trip back to next year"

6559514,bushead11,2021-05-10 07:53:00,151,"We're headed to Kab on Friday. First timers - group of 5. Hope to get the boat in the water and check things out before Saturday morning. We had similar thoughts as others have posted. Reset expectations, give up some of the remote outpost privacy etc. The pros are that we have electric plugs, flush toilets, save 6 hours driving each way and don't have to deal with the rationing of booze crossing the border. We like catching all species and usually pick different days to target different fish. We actually like eating early season, cold water pike better than the walleye since the meat is a little sweeter and there is more of it per keeper. We shouldn't have a problem catching them shallow. Another plus is that my brother in law got a new boat (19ft Lund) with 12 inch Mega SI/DI and he is excited to put it to use for the first time. We typically rent boats in canada so this will be nice to use his for cost savings and comforts. I will try to post a report when we get back."

6559696,rather-be-fishin,2021-05-10 18:23:00,429,Bushead11 Sounds like a great plan!!! What resort are you staying at? Good luck & hope you have a great trip! Please do post a report when you get back! üëç‚ù§Ô∏èüé£. RBF
6559700,IowaWalleyeGuy,2021-05-10 18:32:00,47,"I'll also be up Kab Friday thru Sunday, I've been on Kab a half dozen times now, would love to be on Lac Suel instead but it's not happening yet so..Great places to stay on Kab and it's a beautiful lake and we usually can get a few walleye meals, have fun !!"
6555484,ljcs789,2021-04-28 14:59:00,42,Any good Minnesota walleye resort options with another year of closed Ontario? Lake of the Woods? Kabetogama? Winnie? have our own boat. Any help is much appreciated!
6555486,Wallychowder,2021-04-28 15:06:00,1567,Forget Minnesota. Devil's Lake is your best bet.
6555508,7 Mag,2021-04-28 16:06:00,1887,It may be difficult to find something when are you wanting to go?
6555516,ljcs789,2021-04-28 16:18:00,42,"Never thought of that, good idea! Any resort suggestions to stay at?"
6555518,ljcs789,2021-04-28 16:19:00,42,Probably end of July or first part of August?
6555524,Wallychowder,2021-04-28 16:31:00,1567,"Walleye limits Devils lake is 5 minimum length 15"""
6555546,7 Mag,2021-04-28 18:21:00,1887,"Of the lakes you mentioned I would look at Winnie, check The Pines resort on the east end, you'll be close to Cutfoot Sioux as well. If you could go in late August or September the fishing will be better, I'll be on Cutfoot Sioux the end of August."
6556700,skimottaret,2021-05-02 05:07:00,40,"We went to Kab last summer due to border closure and the fishing was poor at best. Pretty lake but nothing like Ontario, rammed with boats and overfished. This year our plan B is to not even try to replicate the Canadian shield lake experience but instead are going to musky fishing for a few days then drift boat river fly fishing for smallies. Might find a new hobby last years trip report on Kab https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=714764"
6556730,andreindy,2021-05-02 06:46:00,308,"Last year, my group went to Cass Lake, Minnesota in July as our Canada back-up plan. We had to reevaluate our expectations of what was important on the trip. We wanted to recreate elements of the Canada trip, but the fishing and solitude just isn't possible in most of the stateside lakes in the summertime. The fishing was challenging and took several days for our group to get our first walleye. What we did create similar to the Canada experience was us all being together at the same place, at the same time and that checks a lot of boxes for us. This year, we are going to Vermilion mid July. With the significant cost savings from our Canada trip, I used money to book a guide the first day there. Again, it will not be the same and I am going into it thinking like that. But keeping the young fellas and my Dad together another year annually is important. Having some fishing success would be great too."
6556736,That Minnesota guy,2021-05-02 06:54:00,8293,Sounds like to have your priorities in proper order. Best of luck on your trip.
