I have so many great (and admittedly not so great) memories of the many trips we did with him - none will be forgotten. I understand there's a Facebook page ""celebration of life for Pete Johnson phish"

6563806,tooski,2021-05-26 14:00:00,393,Phish and Larry S always spoke highly of him. That's enough for me... .
6563992,chunger21,2021-05-27 09:11:00,11,Does anyone know if the business is closing or if his family is still going to run it. Only met Pete a few times but he seemed like a great person. Always had a smile on his face.
6564314,phishfearme,2021-05-28 05:57:00,1242,i think Christine and Brian want to continue with the business - their big challenge is getting pilot(s) certified on the otter - Pete did most all the flying and much of it was to service the native communities up north. I for one hope they can continue - keep Pete's legacy alive. phish
