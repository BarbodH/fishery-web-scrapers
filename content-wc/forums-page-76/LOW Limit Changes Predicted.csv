6563954,Skywagon,2021-05-27 05:46:00,1106,"There is nothing the MNR can do about Native netting, their treaty with the Canadian Government (first established in the late 1800's) is open ended and allows them to take as many fish and as much game whenever they like, even endangered species, they are untouchable. Once a treaty (contract) is established it cannot be taken away, or modified without both parties agreeing, the ramifications of this commitment made in a different time, goes way beyond netting walleye....it's consequences are being felt today in no small way by all Canadians."
6563968,Guest,2021-05-27 06:45:00,0,but we have been told numerous times they are the caretakers of the land
6563970,Jesse-WI,2021-05-27 06:46:00,534,"Wisconsin has/had similar issues with walleye. Unless all parties work together to share a strategic resource, it will disappear."
6563704,Bill Krejca,2021-05-26 06:59:00,6107,A reduction of keep on walleyes being predicted. https://www.895thelake.ca/2021/05/25...l.facebook.com Bill
6563716,Wallychowder,2021-05-26 07:31:00,1567,"""He is urging anglers to reduce the number of fish they catch this summer"" Oh it'll be reduced greatly if the border doesn't open again !!!"
6563742,prov1800,2021-05-26 09:19:00,5010,2 years of non resident fishing will keep a unreal amount of fish in the lake especially in Canadian waters.I would think local fishing doesn't impact any lake in our area the way it does when border is open.
6563756,Jesse-WI,2021-05-26 09:49:00,534,What is the current status of commercial fishing on Lake of the Woods?
6563766,Da' Walleye Assassun,2021-05-26 10:22:00,358,Is commercial fishing considered a net loss?
6563778,Flip Silverlake,2021-05-26 11:46:00,645,"There is no closed season for the Native Netting on Lake Of The Woods. I've run across abandoned nets full of dead fish more than once. When they pull the nets it's a pelican feed fest you can always tell where they are at by just watching the flock of them following their boat. The locals bought the fish processing plant in Kenora that can go through 40,000 pounds of fish week. This is done year round even during the spawn season. Now if you think a couple of guys in a boat fishing with a hook and line is killing off the Walleye population in this lake your very misguided. The netting has to stop. I talked to a couple of MNR officers in the Wholesale Foods parking lot a few years back and asked them if there were any limits on how many fish can be taken by netting and they said that there's not a thing they can do. The worst part is that when they pull the nets they only keep the 17 inch class fish because those are what the restaurants buy everything else they feed to the birds. Its time to wake up and stop this abuse of that resource! I know when Culver's were selling Canadian Walleye fish sandwiches there was a boycott of their business and they got the message real quick. I'm not a newbie to fishing that lake because the first year i was on it was 1962. I've seen a lot believe me and I've spent every summer up there since 2005. I've fished in areas where you didn't see another boat all day so don't give me that BS that the sport fisherman are cleaning out that lake."
6563846,Lazy Fisherman,2021-05-26 16:45:00,276,Flip Silverlake Well said.. I couldn't agree more.
6563864,walleyecheek,2021-05-26 17:32:00,2231,The Canadian MNR ought to be ashamed of themselves. Nothing we can do !........BS !!!!!!!!
6563870,Da' Walleye Assassun,2021-05-26 17:48:00,358,Went musky fishing in Georgian Bay. The guide said his clients would regularly catch giant walleyes while trolling for musky. First Nations started netting the mouths of spawning rivers DURING SPAWNING SEASON. After two years the guide said he never caught another walleye. Another guy told me he was approached by a First Nations teen. The enterprising youth offered to trade netted walleye for any dope the group had.
6563936,Baseline,2021-05-26 21:29:00,3207,This thread has turned into nonsense and ought to be deleted.
