6556086,That Minnesota guy,2021-04-30 06:59:00,8293,When I went we flew. Don't let the virus stop you from a bucket list trip. Nobody guarantees tomorrow.
6556090,eyecatcher1,2021-04-30 07:13:00,323,"We could fly, but we bought a travel trailer last year so we could make this trip as well as go other places. When we go to Alaska we want to be there as long as we feel like staying. Maybe a month or two. Do lots of fishing there and in Canada too."

6556110,jambi,2021-04-30 07:39:00,504,Thanks Esox. Jack Penny is a Pike master!
6556128,Shawn200m,2021-04-30 08:39:00,40,"MSTPA is amazing and a very high quality outfitter, but it is very pricy. My best friend is a bush pilot out of Wasilla, so we mitigated the cost by flying his plane out. The fishing is great with a real chance at 50"" fish. We got 3 48's and a 49. I know they lost the sleeper boat last year to a fire, but I think they rebuilt a new one this year. If you can afford it it's a must for trophy pike."
6556434,bthomas3333,2021-05-01 08:20:00,465,"Hello,Also bought an RV! Wish I could drive it up there this summer but have to fly this summer.Fishing the Innoko (western AK) in July this year. Booked for Midnight sun next summer. Assuming I lose my Aug and Sept Canada trips I will be scrambling to find a second Alaska trip. The pike fishing in Western Alaska is unreal. It is not uncommon for 4 guys to push past 100 pike over 40 inches in a week with 1/3 over 45. I know that is hard to believe but based on 9 years of trips those are the numbers. Bucket list trips and priced accordingly, the charter to Western AK is $950 a man this year on top of the fishing trip. OUCH! If you are even thinking about it...just make the leap!If you have any questions ask away.Brett"

6555796,jambi,2021-04-29 12:37:00,504,"With another year probably shot, looking at alternatives to my pike addiction. Anyone been to Midnight Sun www.mstpa.com or done any other Alaska pike/walleye trips? I know there have been alot of bigtime network shows filmed there but want to hear a real opinion! 2022 I'm clipping the big 50 and want a bucket list trip to plan now."
6555838,Eckohlt,2021-04-29 14:26:00,3685,"Don't give up on October in NWO or maybe sept,you never know"
6555842,That Minnesota guy,2021-04-29 14:34:00,8293,
6555846,Eckohlt,2021-04-29 14:44:00,3685,"Let's not talk fishing,let's talk about catching fish"
6555854,That Minnesota guy,2021-04-29 15:09:00,8293,I was laughing at your thought the border would open this fall.
6555874,7 Mag,2021-04-29 16:11:00,1887,"The part no one is talking about is; the V, supposedly is only good for 6 months, for those that got it early on, possibly will need another before entry. We shall see!"
6555878,Wallychowder,2021-04-29 16:12:00,1567,"Well, if it doesn't open i think the chocolate moose and border bobs are , well you know ?"
6555882,That Minnesota guy,2021-04-29 16:17:00,8293,Only thing that will kill the Moose is Walz.
6556016,vteye3,2021-04-29 20:40:00,496,Most watersheds have pike in Alaska but not necessary the most sought after species. Yukon is good place to start looking. I have not heard about walleye options. Sent you a pm in response.
6556044,Esoxfeign1313,2021-04-30 03:51:00,79,"Jack Penny named MSTPA #3 on his Top Ten pike outfitter list. She pricey, but I take what he said about pike as gospel, so I don’t think you’ll be wasting your money."
