6560924,prov1800,2021-05-15 16:42:00,5010,We fished for trout for few hrs today.Will go for walleye maybe during week.Rather trout fish for a while yet.Ill try Wednesday for walleye.
6560940,Eckohlt,2021-05-15 17:42:00,3685,Weather looks awesome
6560964,prov1800,2021-05-15 19:25:00,5010,Going to get hot.
6561002,Eckohlt,2021-05-16 06:02:00,3685,Along with the heat the fishing will heat up big time
6561034,gmattbruin,2021-05-16 09:00:00,174,"Curious, whats the water temp right now? Im guessing mid 50s ?"
6561038,prov1800,2021-05-16 09:21:00,5010,"Yesterday main lake was 48-49 f.Bays were mid 50,s and up depending how shallow you went.This is on a deep clear trout lake so shallower walleye lakes coukd be a few degrees higher."

6561264,Bill Krejca,2021-05-17 06:24:00,6107,"Yup, nice fish!!!! Bill"
6560502,sheepman,2021-05-13 20:09:00,98,John if we can make it up in August we want to book you again for Cedar lake crappie!! Will bring brat burgers again. How is the depth of Cedar?
6560556,prov1800,2021-05-14 05:45:00,5010,There's some .catch them fishing muskie here and there.You will end up with more muskies
6560716,RichA$1970,2021-05-14 14:06:00,1159,Thanks as I’ve seen a resort at the All Canada Show and they seem to have a good package they offer. What would you consider in your neck of the woods the best Pike lake (a mess of perch in it would even make it better hah)?
6560794,prov1800,2021-05-14 20:01:00,5010,As far as pike go I'd have to say Clay Lake and Lac Suel.
6560800,prov1800,2021-05-14 20:59:00,5010,It's down a bit like everywhere but that won't be a problem.Hope that will happen.That was a heck of a day we all had and the bbq burgers were a real treat in the boat.
6560816,Eckohlt,2021-05-15 02:55:00,3685,That will wear the knife out
6560834,prov1800,2021-05-15 06:47:00,5010,Rod that crew was staying up near Earfalls and and I think they ended up taking the fish up there to clean so i got out of that deal.haha.I would normally use my electric knife on those.about a minute per fish.
6560836,Eckohlt,2021-05-15 07:00:00,3685,"That's one mess of slab crappies,I would probably come up with not feeling good and having to go lay down at cleaning time"
6560838,Eckohlt,2021-05-15 07:02:00,3685,Can the lake withstand taking loads of crappies from it?
6560922,prov1800,2021-05-15 16:29:00,5010,Seems like there is no shortage of them if you know we're to fish for them.The spawn is so easy but then after that through summer most people give up on them as they get tough to find.So basically there untouched.With the second year of covid now and another spawn year coming iam sure their numbers will climb.Wife and I are ready for them.

6560434,Wallychowder,2021-05-13 14:27:00,1567,I heard today that only 50 percent of the Canadian population has been vaccinated 1st one ?
6560444,Guest,2021-05-13 16:01:00,0,Latest data I can find shows 42% of Canadians have 1 shot and only 3.5 % are fully vaccinated.Very unfortunate the supply of vaccine to Canada has been so limited. People do need to get vaccinated . If you don't believe vaccinations are necessary please make an effort to educate yourself. I greatly miss my trips to Canada. I do not think the border will and should reopen until at least 70% of Americans and Canadians have been fully vaccinated. Encourage everyone you know to get vaccinated as soon as they can so we can all go fishing in Canada again.
6560450,Bill Krejca,2021-05-13 16:32:00,6107,Nope
6560466,Wallychowder,2021-05-13 17:35:00,1567,Why only 70% ?
6560476,Eckohlt,2021-05-13 18:29:00,3685,"There doing a lot of unnecessary damage right now[/QUOTE] Eck, Odds are looking better after the announcement today which would be tough to keep things closed.

6557006,rosh1,2021-05-03 08:40:00,275,Thanks for the great pictures. Makes me miss being up there even more.
6560330,prov1800,2021-05-13 06:51:00,5010,Had a couple of outings on Cliff again.Got out with my son Monday and then a solo trip yesterday..Both days great weather.Have been fishing deeper water but targeting the bait schools higher up in the water column.Just need to put lure inside the school and keep it there lots of fish feeding and doesnt rake long to get hooked up.
6560334,Bill Krejca,2021-05-13 06:56:00,6107,Nice fish!!! Bill

6560354,prov1800,2021-05-13 08:04:00,5010,Most lakes are down but can get boat in most placès.
6560358,prov1800,2021-05-13 08:08:00,5010,So my son took a video and I downloaded it on YouTube.Not sure it will work.Not tgat tech savvy.here is link to it.https://youtu.be/-lgMb2Lfdvk
6560362,prov1800,2021-05-13 08:10:00,5010,So i typed it in and it worked.???
6556632,prov1800,2021-05-01 18:59:00,5010,Got out for awesome day of trout fishing with my wife today.Beautifull blue skies and no wind and temps at 20c.Couldnt ask for a nicer day.Found some baitfish and dropped our tubes down and proceeded to catch a bunch of trout.Ended up with 9 in the boat by noon.wife 7.John 2.Lol.Veiws on the lake today we're iñcredible.
6556636,prov1800,2021-05-01 19:08:00,5010,The crystell clear waters of Cliff Lake are beautifull to fish in.
6556696,Eckohlt,2021-05-02 04:38:00,3685,"Oh ya that's get'er done john n better half,beautiful to say the least"
6556732,Bill Krejca,2021-05-02 06:50:00,6107,Absolutely absolutely gorgeous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bill
6556740,Pooch,2021-05-02 07:23:00,4618,"When I look at picture #3 I can just envision watching Smallies (or snot rockets) hitting a crankbait thrown from a boat into the rocks and worked back as it nears deeper water and more round head size type of rocks. Dang...... having to wait another year is painful for an old guy without a lot of years left. Thanks, and keep our interest up with pictures. Pooch"
6556750,prov1800,2021-05-02 07:48:00,5010,Thx for the comments on the pics guys.The lake has unreal bass fishing for sure.Can get some pike but mostly you will get muskies.Those spots will come alive soon with spawning smallies.We will get out there for that as we do every year and my wife will be smoking them on her fly rod.Always fun to see that.Best part is with the clear water you can sight fish them.
6556762,lassh,2021-05-02 08:58:00,553,Your pics are making my heart pound. I can hardly believe I'm going to miss another early summer trip to God's country! I'm gad you are able to enjoy it.
6556784,prov1800,2021-05-02 10:09:00,5010,I can't imagine what it would be like not to be able to come up here.We are very lucky to have everything so close and able to enjoy it.This time of year is our favorite as everything is turning green again and having the earky open water is a bonus.
