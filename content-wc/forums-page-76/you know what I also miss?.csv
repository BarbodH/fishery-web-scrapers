6563572,Wallychowder,2021-05-25 15:36:00,1567,Especially this year ?
6563578,NARDA 1,2021-05-25 16:37:00,636,We have been taking the 71 for the last several years. Don't miss the 502 at all. It's nice to be able to stop in Nestor Falls if the need arises.
6563616,Pooch,2021-05-25 19:11:00,4618,"If we are heading north and headed for the Red Lake Road I like to go 71. Going to Sioux Lookout area then it's 502. 502 is fine for me. Seems to take forever sometimes though. Pretty drive, but people are going all speeds and that causes problems for smooth traffic flow. Crossing at Pigeon River offers the best roads, but adds well over an hour and or more to the trip. Pooch"

6563640,muskyman73,2021-05-25 22:12:00,401,Ah the smell of the pulp mill at the border. Just hits you and you know your almost there.
6563648,Eckohlt,2021-05-26 03:25:00,3685,"They should shut down the 502 racetrack completely sometime for a race from one end to the other,with carnhzkr on the poll,for me I would rather take an airplane from the beginning to the end of the boring 502"
6563700,Bill Krejca,2021-05-26 06:49:00,6107,"Although 502 is great for scenery in places, I don't care for the tiny to no shoulder, leaving scarce room for pulling over. I much prefer the Nestor Falls/ Sioux Narrows route. Bill"
6564404,Bakefish,2021-05-28 10:29:00,1077,I love 502. I even had a replica sign made and it hangs it in my basement. 502 to me is Canada.
6563398,Pooch,2021-05-25 06:14:00,4618,All the highway 502 grumbling............ two seasons of no one complaining about that stretch of road. Ontario folks have had that newly rebuilt road all to themselves and not a one of them complained about it........... :-) Pooch
6563402,pjshorthorn,2021-05-25 06:20:00,5654,I love that stretch of road for the scenery.........guys/gals pulling boats and passing ya at 80 miles an hour and then cutting you off....not so much. Rant over...... PjShorthorn
6563418,Twodogs,2021-05-25 06:40:00,115,I miss the gravel stretches where oncoming trucks going 80 would spew gravel all over you and the boat...
6563422,jambi,2021-05-25 06:42:00,504,"I miss how I end up driving, and everyone else falls asleep after the first 20 miles. Then I enjoy the quiet all to my self"
6563426,ogilville,2021-05-25 06:51:00,262,It would be nice to be able to complain about it again.
6563432,rosh1,2021-05-25 07:04:00,275,It will be soon that we will driving down that beauty! We have started to pack again.
6563446,Skywagon,2021-05-25 07:23:00,1106,"I miss going down 502 the other way, the occasional trip south to pick up those hard to get items you guys have on the south side of the border. No, I won't trade you."
6563452,rosh1,2021-05-25 07:31:00,275,Sky a couple of weeks you will be able to make that trip! I will wave as I am heading north.
6563472,Carnhzkr,2021-05-25 08:34:00,964,Was that you waving at me with only one finger as I attempted a new record of blowing by 17 vehicles on a single pass two years ago? Would have made it if that hill had been a little longer.
6563544,pjshorthorn,2021-05-25 14:06:00,5654,"I'll make a deal with you..... When I can drive the 502 again, you let me know what you need from the south side and I'll let you know how many pounds of Tenderflake lard I need for the wife to make pies. ðŸ˜‰. The best pie crusts ever are made with that lard. And I'm serious about that.....my grandfather was never allowed to go fishing in Canada unless he brought back the Flake. I learned that at age 17......and it still holds true today for me after almost 40 years......LOL. PjShorthorn"
