All of my trips have been 7d / 7n trips, with the exception of once being able to get in early, so it was 8n/7d sort of thing. Seems like as soon as we first hit camp, everybody is knees and elbows getting unpacked, rods rigged, and food stashed, with quick breaks for some test casts off the dock. Getting in the boat for the first official outing, and catching that first fish has an urgency that can not be postponed. The first night always seems to go late too. War stories, plans for attack, general nonsense + beer makes that first night a great time.The first few days are a blur. Fish after fish, variations of fish dinners, yahtzee / cards / beer, somebody falling out of a boat, outhouse jokes, and deep conversations about fishing friends who are no longer with us.Somewhere around day 4, when cleaning up after a shore lunch, or splitting firewood, I tend to pay more attention to mosquitos, or sunburn, or how to get Bob to quit snoring / farting / whatever. 6 days in, enthusiasm seems to have waned even more for the group. Sleeping bags are in need of a wash, bed feels a little more lumpy, and dang.... anybody notice how hot it is? :-) The night of packing up and cleaning camp always seems to be somber. We are all tired and ready for home, but deep down we don't want the trip to be over. A little grumpy, and ready for a break, maybe a slice of pizza and a real bed and pillow. And some quiet at night (hey Bob... put a sock in it, huh?) And then after being home for a few days, already formulating plans for the next trip which never can come soon enough."

Many bad mornings and afternoon naps to recover. As i got older...and smarter....i look back on all the time i missed fishing and enjoying the trip. Now my mindset is the same all week. I can not wait to get there. The drive from I-Falls to the red lake area is beautiful and I love every mile....especially now that i am not hungover and looking for a nap like I was 22 years old. I spend all the time i can on the water fishing and enjoying the beauty. I usually have a boat to myself as the others still enjoy the night time drinks. Many times at sunset i will boat out to the middle of the lake area and just watch the sunset and look around and listen. By the end of the week...I am never ready to go home. I do love the conversations and a couple drinks talking about the older days with the older group of guys that have passed on in life. Talking about how we use to pack everything but the sink to come up for 10 days. Now...i can pack in about 30 minutes as I buy everything in canada. Talking about my gramps and his famous cooking....waking up to the smell of bacon, eggs, fried mush and pancakes. Shore lunches and amazing dinners. You couldnt wear the same pants home that you wore up. The Uechre games at night. Having not a great day fishing and going over the lake map planning the next days strategy. The cool, crisp canadian air the revives your soul."

6562454,NWBearcatgrad,2021-05-21 08:23:00,36,"I think that is what we all feel! As one of the younger guys in our group, it has been fun to watch the ""old timers"" act exactly as described above. Now after several trips, we all have our niche we fit into, and things just click. We all enjoy the time together, without a worry! The stages are spot on. I know I use the week in the Far North to reset and recharge my life. Nothing to worry about, and great experiences to enjoy. A few beverages and lots of fish make it even better, but some of my greatest memories are just sitting in the boat and just letting the wind and water take over. Breathing that fresh pine air, after a heavy downpour is definitely good for the soul. The days when your thumb is cut up and bleeding from taking so many fish off hooks and your arm aches builds a lot of character, and makes one feel proud. Dang......I so am trying to stay positive a trip in July works out It is needed."

6563332,Bigtaproot,2021-05-24 17:37:00,900,I do some summer work fixing machinery at the local municipal golf course. This reminds me of golfers that go out all happy high-fiving laughing on the first hole by the time I see them at the turn the laughing is gone and by the time they are coming up the 18th fairway it looks like a death march

You hit the nail on the head in every aspect from the anticipation, to the feeling of a long week and the packing and cleaning of camp. Fantastic short version of typically amazing fish trip. Well done!!!!"
