When I search for new outposts to visit, that is one of my prime considerations. While getting ones' bearings on a new lake, heading for current areas is always a good way to start. It can almost be like a grocery store, a place where a guy can pick up dozens of walleyes without much effort. Man, I sure wish I was packing for another Canada trip right now. We would always leave on Memorial Day, or close to it, and that first trip was always the highlight of the year for me and my buddies. Those Northern Jacks hats you guys wear are cool. Do you offer them for sale?"

6559824,Fishquest,2021-05-11 05:53:00,89,All good starting spots. I like the adventure of a new lake and it always takes a few days to figure them out but we always do. Satellite mapping now offers some good close clear views and I have been able to pick out and GPS the co-ordinates for places of interest as well and been spot on.

6560068,gordy28,2021-05-12 06:26:00,437,"Thanks for the kind words all. Definitely figuring out the pattern is part of the fun for these trips. Map study including google earth is definitely a game changer. I know for our group we spend a fair bit of time reviewing maps ahead of the trip and like to have a map printed out with spots we feel have potential based on google earth, depth maps and pre trip research. After our trip to Ogoki followed by Lake St Joe I think a lake that has a significant inflow and outflow would rank higher on our visit list that one that does not Michigan will send you a PM re hats. I did have some for sale but my stock is pretty much depleted Thanks again all and glad you enjoyed the post Andrew"
