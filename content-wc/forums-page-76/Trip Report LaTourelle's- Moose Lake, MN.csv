Our alternative for Walleye opener was LaTourelle's resort on Moose Lake. We took advantage of the Fisherman's Package Special for opening week. We upgraded the boat which was pricey but we thought it was worth it. The system is limited to 25 hp engines and our Evinrude ran smooth. The upgrade included electric start, trolling motor, deluxe seats depth finder/fish finder, live well and roomy and uncluttered fishing deck. Our whole trip was under 1K per person. The water was very clear and we quickly found out that jigging would be difficult on the rock filled bottom. We settled for casting plastics for a few days. We caught lots of smallies and tied into some big pike near an inflow that we discovered. We hooked into a total three big ones, the first two on a double up. We didn't have leaders on and Dock got bit off first. I still had mine and we got a good look at a big brute with my lure hooked and visible on the side of her mouth until Dock snagged my lure in the net freeing the pike. Moments later I hooked into another (could have been the same one) and this one and this time I was able to get her in the boat. She measured 37"" which I thought was quite big for this system. While we caught a few other pike through the week, nothing this big. We returned to this spot a few times but could not find the big girls again. Mid week we talked with another fisherman in camp who seemed to be having walleye luck and he suggested slip bobbers to us. It made sense since the water is very clear and the bottom so rocky. We had two days of good success with walleye and ate well the last few days of our trip. We were lucky enough to secure one permit for Basswood Lake and spent a day there. Very interesting how to portage between Sucker Lake and Basswood. Mindy and her truck and trailer await your arrival and $34 gets you a ride over and back. She directs you onto her trailer and hauls your boat with you in it about 1/4 mile into Basswood Lake. You can go over anytime after 7pm and return by 7:30 pm. When we got dropped off Mindy wished us a good day and we motored over to the incoming water which we had been told to try. We caught a couple smallies right off and drifted over to an island and began to cast. At this point Mindy had returned with another group and yelled over to us to come back over the the US side! Apparently we were in Canada and at just that time I had a hit and pulled up about a 4 lb. large mouth bass! So, I am one of the few Americans who can say that I caught a fish in Canada in 2021! We went into Basswood on Tuesday and had not yet caught a walleye but finally Dock caught one casting a jighead and plastic. We spent the rest of the day casting and dragging jigheads and plastics. We caught a ton of smallies but that is all. It was a beautiful day and the lake has a shoreline in the USA and a shoreline in Canada. At one point we saw a deer swimming in the middle of the lake and took about a ten minute break as we watched her finally arrive and climb out on the Canadian shore. We finished out the week but fishing slip bobbers and catching walleye with leeches until Friday. We fished most of the day Friday but it seemed the walleye shut off for us. The accommodations are adequate but the A-Frames have a loft. At our age climbing into the loft got old. Also, it was warm for opening week and the loft was considerably warmer than the main level. The dock helpers were very good and helpful and were there to tie us up when we got home and filled our gas and changed our batteries without being asked. The fish cleaning house was great and as the cleaner I appreciated it. The down side of the experience was the boat traffic and the bugs. I am susceptible to black flies and they were ferocious. I came home with many welts and itchy bumps. We bought head nets and by the end of the week the bugs had subsided considerably. The boat traffic never subsided. Canoe haulers are constantly going by in and out and their flat bottoms create a lot of wake, especially when loaded down. There are also a lot of people fishing with several other resorts and a public boat ramp on Moose Lake. We agreed that it was the best experience we have had in Minnesota and a good alternative if we can't get back in Canada for the fall. Be sure to post a report describing your alternative! Fish On!
