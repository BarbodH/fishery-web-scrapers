6318026,toula,2019-05-05 06:43:00,54,"If your coming up via Winnipeg, there are several options for live bait and frozen (Google) that you would have to manage given you have another ~8 hrs or so drive to LA. The next best availability would be in The Pas, after that Flin Flon. Know the regulations in the waters you are fishing in, you can get more detailed information via Travel Manitoba website. Depending on where your staying around LA, the local store or lodge (Google)may have live bait, for sure they would sell frozen bait."
6317000,outdoorsron,2019-05-01 10:16:00,843,"Hello: I will be headed to Manitoba the first of June. Will be fishing for Walleyes , Northerns and Lake Trout. I was told to get salted minnows because live minnows are not legal. Never used salted minnows before. I am looking for advice on using salted minnows or any other baits or lures I might need. Good Luck . O - R"
6317004,Jwendt15,2019-05-01 10:24:00,72,"I posted a similar question about a month ago and got some great information on salted minnows. If you search for salted minnows, it should be one of the first one to come up. I plan to order them in bulk shortly from Best Bait out of Ohio. Consensus seems to suggest not freezing them upon arrival if they aren't already. Tend to get mushy after they thaw."
6317016,Honkerslayer,2019-05-01 11:04:00,238,You can buy them when u get there. They sell them at a lot of gas stations and bait stores.
6317076,BornToFish,2019-05-01 13:26:00,1224,"Greetings,I recently picked up salted shiner minnows from Best Bait in Marblehead, OH. I was very pleased with the quality of the minnows. I enjoyed a very nice chat with Chris - the owner of the business. I will almost certainly get my supply of salties from Best Bait in 2020.I can offer two suggestions regarding the use of salted minnows when jigging. First, the junction of the head and body of the salted minnow is the weakest link. I often would feel the bite, set the hook and get the head of the minnow back with the jig. I'm sure the walleye was smiling, with a minnow body sticking out of its mouth. I now use jigs with long shank hooks. I hook the minnow in such a manner that the hook point is as far back in the minnow as I can get it. I rarely ""swing and miss"" with this set-up.The second suggestion pertains to the salt that comes with the minnow. You will know before too long if you have a cut on your hands. I also found that the salt eventually transferred from my hands to my equipment. For example, I noticed some pitting on the finish of some of my reels. I overcame these issues by keeping a small container of water in the boat. I just rinse my hands every now and again.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6317136,Midwest Jet,2019-05-01 15:51:00,6,Same issue when fishing NW Ontario and great advice on how to hook already posted. Went a different route last year and bought a few pounds of leeches. Lake was cold enough in July (Trout Lake) so storage wasn't an issue. Just change the water each morning and bring a leech bag for the boat. Walleyes loved the different look! Would check the regs for Manitoba and your lake.
6317214,outdoorsron,2019-05-01 23:24:00,843,Hello Midwest Jet: I don't think leeches are legal in Manitoba. Good Luck . O - R
6317390,The tank,2019-05-02 17:33:00,340,There are parts of Manitoba where leeches are not allowed.
6317518,lassh,2019-05-03 07:43:00,553,"Another factor to consider when using salted minnows or crawlers in MB is keeping the bait on hook. You must go barbless in MB so if you are going to work your baited presentation aggressively, using a “keeper” on the bend of the hook above the bait will help keep it from coming off. Some people cut circumferential slices out of plastic worms and push those on after the bait. I use a paper hole punch to punch disks out of plastic milk type containers. I’m sure there are keepers you can buy as well."
6317660,stumcfar,2019-05-03 15:30:00,451,"Having a few wider rubber bands in the boat and cut off small pieces to thread on the hook, to hold bait, works good also."
6317796,toula,2019-05-04 07:48:00,54,"Insofar as availability goes, live minnows, frozen salted or frozen unsalted, live leeches can all be purchased locally. Depends on where your fishing in Manitoba...you may have to manage your supply ie. Frozen minnows, live minnows given your fishing waters and access to resupply. More details will enable more suggestions on where to buy your bait options in Manitoba."
