Despite brutally cold, wet and windy weather and post turnover conditions we did pretty well.This was an extra special trip. Every year we hold a draw for one lucky angler to join me on a free fly-in trip, and this was the trip. Terry, an outstanding gentleman from the Chicago area and fellow Walleye Central member was the winner. He drove up to Wawa by himself meeting me and the rest of the crew at the airbase, and we hit it off immediately. Typically once turnover happens I find the walleye often go deep and scatter on northern shield lakes and it can be a tough bite. Not going to lie, I was a little concerned we'd struggle!As it turned out once I found the fish we experienced walleye fishing that was as good as anything I've had in Ontario. Incredible numbers and really nice average size. For a northeastern Ontario Algoma country destination I was honestly very, very surprised!If you're interested in reading the full story you can see it right here:https://www.canadafishingguide.net/l...lgoma-country/Cheers, Mike"

I love this story, it captures the allure of Canadian fishing that is hard to explain to people who have not experienced it. It also captures how a common love of that experience bonds people that may not have much else in common. Thanks for a great report. Fish On! Hooks"
