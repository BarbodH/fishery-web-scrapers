I just fished there in 1984 when I was 11, and remember it well enough to keep you safe and get you on fish. All I need is travel expenses and room and board... and maybe bait and a fishing license... and beer."
6312902,Bergy,2019-04-19 09:11:00,83,"Looking for the contour detail on Gull Rock and connected lakes with the Lakemaster and Navionics Chips. Anyone know what contours they are each in? 1’, 3’, 5’, 10’?"
6315122,Carnhzkr,2019-04-25 10:14:00,964,Navionics is at 10' contours. You can see it for yourself right here:https://webapp.navionics.com/#boatin...key=__cvHzpkzP
6317988,valley366,2019-05-04 22:12:00,193,If you click on the SonarChart option on that webpage it shows in 1 foot contours. That is the little sonar looking button in the bottom left.I fished Gullrock last year and used my Navionics app on my tablet. I thought it was good around the shoreline structure but it does not show some of the mid lake structure that well. We fished some mid lake humps that were not on it.Was great for navigating the channels up to Keg lake though and all I would not leave home without it.Good luck.
6309876,Bergy,2019-04-10 20:36:00,83,I will be fishing the Gull Rock Chain of Lakes in June. I have Humminbird Helix 10’s and a Helix 7 on my boat. These are all Gen2 units. Which map chip is best detailed for the lakes? The new Lakemaster Ontario chip?
6309896,bensen,2019-04-10 21:12:00,155,Heading there myself end of June 1st time. All of my research has lead me to 2 options. The newest and best online updatable Navionics chip which I own. And the LakeMaster Ontario Canada V1 chip which I intend to buy. The Navionics map detail is very limited when I viewed on my unit and online. I have read multiple sources online stating the LakeMaster is the way to go and we both know how awesome that compatibility is with our Birds. I'll be following your thread too incase the jury has a different answer.
6310046,sagecreek,2019-04-11 08:28:00,24,are you talking about the gullrock chain of lakes south of red lake
6310130,Carnhzkr,2019-04-11 10:47:00,964,"I did not realize LM now has an Ontario chip. For the past 4 or 5 years, I've used the Navionics Canada chip in my Humminbird to navigate Lac Seul. The Navionics as most people probably realize provides only 20' contour lines so it's great for keeping you from getting lost but only so-so at keeping you off the rocks. For the non hi-def lakes (which is everything except border lakes) does anyone know if the new LM Ontario chip buys you anything over the Navionics? My guess is they're the same."
6310174,Bergy,2019-04-11 12:22:00,83,Yes. The Gull Rock Chain of Lakes near Red Lake Ontario. I am also interested in the depth contours the new Lakemaster Chip has.
6310280,sagecreek,2019-04-11 15:29:00,24,"I have units that use the navionics chip , one has the contours the other doesn't . but once you see where the other boats are, you don't really need to see the contours. on gullrock the reefs are marked with red and green markers , with the exception of the gullrock itself. usually someone puts a white marker on it. talk to your lodge owner and have him mark up a map for you and he will put you on fish and talk to the others in the camp that you are staying at, gullrock is a great lake to fish and you should have a great trip ."
6310420,Guest,2019-04-12 00:54:00,0,Based on previous knowledge of navionics in Canada. It may benefit you more if you have live mapping feature on them birds. You can easily make a map of small area you choose to pick apart. As others said the Lodge owner where you are will help with hazards . What camp you staying at?
6310444,Bergy,2019-04-12 06:33:00,83,Staying at Five Lakes Lodge.
6310488,sagecreek,2019-04-12 07:47:00,24,"you won't have any trouble getting fish , even if you don't think you bought the right chip. ian wil show you where to go and if you are still having trouble he will go out with you to see what you are doing wrong. five lakes is a great camp ."
6310624,tate05,2019-04-12 15:09:00,99,What week in June? I'll be back up there then. You won't have trouble finding fish. The V1 card works fine and the lake is marked well compared to others. Just a few spots to avoid all together and you'll be good.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
