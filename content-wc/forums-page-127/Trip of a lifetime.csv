6315502,TitanD,2019-04-26 09:00:00,43,"No doubt my most memorable trip to Canada was the first fly in trip I made with my Dad and Brother probably 25+ years ago now. We flew into Joyce lake which was operated by Booi's (Jim) on Trout Lake.............same outfit still owns the camp I believe but Jim has since passed. We arrive at fly in base in Balmertown (I think was name of it - not far from Red Lake). We check in with the flying service and we tell them where we are headed and they say ""Dueling""...........we don't have no ""Dueling"" on our schedule to fly in. Of course I had read the horror stories of fly in trips gone awry etc. and anxiety immediately set in. Well, shortly after we place a call to Jim Booi (literally carried a booi knife the length of his leg everywhere he went). He said.......hmmmm, well I will be there shortly. Probably within the hour here comes a little red and white float plane and he lands at the base and proceeds to tell us clearly must have been a mix-up with the flying service and then proceeds to take 2 of us and our gear into the lake and then has take make second trip to pick up my Dad and get him into the lake. The good news is the lake is not really very far at all from the float plane base. Soon we are getting situated in the Joyce lake cabin which is nothing more than a shack really..........no amenities relative to today's standards. There was a black rubber bag swaying from the limbs outside the cabin that would be our shower base. There was a hand water pump at the sink but as I recall it did not work so we hauled water from the lake to the cabin for dishes etc. There was a propane fridge and stove where approximately 1/3 of the propane was spewing into the cabin at all times. The good news is the cabin really had tremendous ventilation (bad windows, screens etc.) which allowed the gas to escape. I do remember sleeping much better than normal even with the well ventilated cabin. Finally, the beds, and I use the term loosely, were 4 X 4 post with scrap plywood for the frame and something that resembled a mattress. Home for a full 7 days. We packed away the food and gear and prepped our sleeping ""beds"". Now it was time to go fishing. FINALLY!!!!! We get our gear, head out to the boats which I believe there were 2 of as I recall. We load up in two boats and head out. Well, being very green to this North Country fishing we pretty much knew about Daredevle Spoons and that was what we all had on to start our trip. We proceeded to troll the shores of Joyce and it was not long until we landed a dandy Northern.........don't recall how big but 35""'ish I believe. We then proceeded to troll the 1 oz spoons and we probably caught 50-60 fish Walleye and Pike) that first day using only those spoons. We were in heaven!!!! We fished until the sun started to dip in the Western sky. We had some fish to eat that evening with our Vandecamp Beans (a staple on every trip) and then proceeded to hit the ""beds"" for some rest after a very long day. The entire evening/night I could hear things scurrying about in the cabin and wonder what the **** is running all over the floors, walls, roof etc. I finally turned on my flashlight to see multiple mice crawling all over the counters. I tried to run them off but when I hit the sack it wasn't 3 minutes later and the circus regained momentum and now it sounded like the numbers had quadrupled that were running wild all over, under, through our cabin. Oh well, off to sleep we went.Next morning we woke up to find holes in several cracker/cereal boxes and of course remaining niblets scattered all over the counters, floors etc. We were sort of a bit shocked at first and then decided, oh well, let's make some coffee, eat some breakfast and get out on the lake! So off we went. We fished and fished and fished by trolling those 1 oz spoons and continued to pound both the Walleye and Pike. That week we caught at least 6 fish over 40"" (Pike) with the largest being 43 caught by yours truly. My brother and dad also landed fish over 40 during the week. We caught walleye at will on 1 oz spoons so really never changed much as things were working........the walleye by all accounts were larger than what I think you would normally catch on many lakes in the North knowing what I know now. I'm confident we caught many in the 25"" class. This week of fishing with my Dad and Brother was no doubt the trip of my lifetime, not because of the fishing specifically and certainly not to due to the outstanding cabin/facility amenities but because we were on an absolutely beautiful North country lake with no one else around and spending time together (just the 3 of us) un-winding and just enjoying one another's company. Could not have been a more beautiful weather week which I will never forget.Now I'm close to my Dad's age (52) when he took us North on that trip. He coordinate this trip on a factory worker's salary which was not much (and honestly was probably a financial stretch for the family at the time) but he made it happen. My dad (and brother from time to time) continued to make the trips to Canada with me up until about 3 years ago. Unfortunately my dad was robbed of many of his golden years due to having severe COPD which undoubtedly was the result of him smoking for over 50+ years. He is still alive but sits on the sideline strapped to an oxygen tank and literally can't go 20 yards without being completely breathless. I have often wished the horrible disease (COPD) would go away but that is just not to be. It is progressive and no matter what you do it never goes away and certainly does not get better. I will leave you with this......take advantage of every possible opportunity to spend time in beautiful places (like the bush in Canada) with your close friends and family as one day the pieces will start to fall apart. I still make trips North every year with my closest friends on earth and we explore different lakes on a regular basis. I still get excited every year, for every trip (like a 10 year old) but can tell you without reservation that it will never match those times when I had my pops with me on those trips North. I always share my stories with him as I know he absolutely loved that trip we took together every year but he just cannot muster the strength to do it anymore. I certainly hope one day when we have both crossed the rainbow bridge we can re-kindle those trips to a beautiful North country cabin and catch fish until our arms tire....even if it means sharing the cabin with all of gods creatures! Good Luck in 2019!"
6315534,kettyspanky,2019-04-26 10:36:00,271,"Titan, very nice story. I always say its not about the catching but the memories and fun had while fishing and hunting with friends and family. I have been to Canada fishing 7 times now, I think my best trip is yet to come when I take both of my kids with me. Soon, I will be able to, like in the next year or so."
6315554,Golden Eagle,2019-04-26 11:26:00,2642,Best trip is the one on the come. 9 days beginning May 17 7 days beginning July 13 Fall trip with undetermined date
6317414,Midwest Jet,2019-05-02 18:45:00,6,"Lots of great trips over the years, but introducing two senior citizens to Trout Lake in NW Ontario was extra special. My neighbor approached me after returning from my annual Canadian trip and asked if I'd consider including him and his buddy in next year's plans. I was hesitant, but after a few beers I agreed and pitched Cat Island Lodge for fly-in quality fish along with an easier American plan stay for my new 70+ year old partners. They asked about the fishing and I caught a few ""eye rolls"" when I explained what we might experience in quality (big) and numbers (many), but they put their faith in my recommendation and plans were set. The drive up (13 hours) dinner, border crossing & overnight flew by. We laughed as they tried to top each others fishing, hunting and relationship stories (read marriage). Stories that had been fine-tuned over the 70 years that they had known each other. Thankfully, Trout Lake lived up to expectations and the smiles and laughter that came with their first 100 fish day was priceless. There were also memorable shore lunches, fish caught off the dock after dinner and long fights with lakers that never came to net. Plenty of material for new fish stories! Looking forward to more of the same and our 4th trip this July."
6317432,law57,2019-05-02 20:23:00,1147,"June of 1995. I had my father in my boat. My brother and his kid were in his boat. I had tied up some big #5 spinners and were using night crawlers. I noticed 3 huge arcs on my locator. When I went by again I caught a 34"" walleye. I went to get my brother. He said he'd never find them - so I showed him where I thought they were. I then trolled up the lake, turned and came back by him. He had a 32"" walleye in his box. Later I caught a 32"" in the same general area. I threw mine back, my brother kept and mounted his. I was a little disappointed that my brother kept his fish. I slipped some scales off of it and gave them to a friend of mine - a WI DNR hatchery manager. He sent them to the lab in Madison. They estimated the fish to be at least 16 years old. Dad and I went on to catch 13 walleye 30 inches and over before I lost him. He once said I should keep one for mounting - ""they're so old they're just going to die anyway"". I said: ""Aren't you glad we don't think of you that way?"" He said: ""You're right son. Throw it back!"" He was a great guy... I have a picture of him with a 30"" fish. There's a good story that goes with it. If I can find the picture (backup hard drive), I'll post it with the story."
6317500,SteveZ,2019-05-03 06:47:00,271,"All of the trips to Canada are special but one really stands out. 9 of us went on this particular trip in June to fish the English River below the Ear Falls dam. There was lots of flow out of the dam as they had 4 of the gates open. This was before the orange barrels were installed to limit access. We would motor up to the buoy (no longer there) and drift back. The walleyes were so stacked in there it was amazing. We were using 3/4 and 1 oz jigs with large plastics (shad bodies in 6"", large bass tubes, creatures, etc.) and the large walleyes were everywhere. In one morning, the 3 of us in my boat landed 60 walleyes over 5 lbs. For the week all 9 guys caught a walleye of 29"" or better. 3 guys set personal bests. It was a crazy good trip. 3 of those guys are no longer with us but I bet they still reminisce about that trip. Heading back up in June."
6317540,stumcfar,2019-05-03 08:42:00,451,"Two jump out at me. One was 9 years ago. I told my son when he turned 10 he would be able to start going with the guys to Canada. We were on Lac Seul, early in the season and we anchored at the mouth of the Wenesaga. My son's rod was all ready to go and he put a minnow on and dropped it to the bottom, before my buddy and I could even get a minnow on he was pulling up his first walleye with a huge smile. He was hooked immediately, just like that first walleye! Another time 15 years ago 3 of us stayed at Goose Bay. We had a camp boat, which was a nothing fancy, a 16 foot at the time with an upgrade 35 hp two stroke motor. We decided to venture to McKenzie Bay. It was a long boat ride and the water was very high with trees and logs floating all over. We found a spot by an island and began jigging. We caught more fish that day than any other over the years of fishing. We had doubles and triples steady and most were nice fish. We caught them on pieces of licorice and pretty much anything else you could put on a hook. We were well past 300 on the clicker when we finally had to start are long, slow ride back."
6317594,orchard frank,2019-05-03 09:55:00,1900,"Been so fortunate that the majority of Canada trips has been with my wife. Fanciest was for our 25th anniversary, to Hatchet Lake Lodge in far north Sask. 8 days including 6 fly-outs to remote lakes, everything from accommodations, food, etc. was top notch. Fishing was insane, tons of huge pike up to 26#, lake trout, walleye, even a few grayling. Most of my memories stem from our many years and many, many trips to Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul. All were great, stayed up to 3 weeks one time. One fun day was when I prepared, cooked and served shore lunch to Jim and Marlene Hayes, and Basil and Vivian. After all the 100's and 100's of shore lunches they had prepared, we had a blast doing it. And the verdict was, not bad for a tourist!"
6317702,Tonyo,2019-05-03 20:09:00,212,"This is a bitter sweat topic for many of us and it definitely is for me. The best trip was the last trip we shared with my brother. It was a trip that was all about getting him there and home again and all of us enjoying the time we had with him in the best place in the work, 5 Lakes Lodge and Gullrock Lake. My brother and I started this tradition in 2000 and have had many trips that are memorable but not one more memorable than this one. We have the best group including his best friend, Johnboat, Johnboat's nephew, my son, my dad, my uncle and a great group of friends that have shared many trips together. My brother was an awesome, fun loving, rum loving, great person that we lost on December 31, 2018 but this was his fairytale ending to what is one of the best things we shared together with this awesome group of guys. He was not able to make the drive so we flew him to Red Lake with my dad and the owners were gracious enough to pick them up and transport them to the camp and keep them company that first night as the rest of us finished up our drive Saturday morning. He was able to enjoy the week fishing with Johnboat and the crew and we were all able to share one last awesome trip to this amazing place. All of the trips since that trip have all been great but none more special than that trip in 2015. This years trip is going to be bitter sweat as we will all be headed up the first week of June but instead of call and face timing with him and filling him in on all of the details of the week, we will all raise a glass and toast the best brother, friend and son a person could ask for. Cheers Big Brother."
6315560,packpro,2019-04-26 11:41:00,695,"This is our 22nd Trip. The group has been as small as four and as many as 20. Each trip had its own unique highlights. Most of them to Big Canon Lake Lodge. The first trip- almost hit a moose on 502. Had never seen a moose before and our little Chevy S-10 almost drove under one. Then the take off and water landing of the bush plane. Very cool first experienceGreat Memories of special times with friends who no longer go or have passed on. Every location on the water rekindles great memories and deep belly laughs. One week in the boat with my brother and father who just passed. Perfect weather week. Biggest fish ever were caught on that trip, and I got to instruct my father on Canadian techniques after he provided me with life long fishing lessons everywhere else. So many laughs that week.Putting every rookie on the best fishing of their lives, and their sheer amazement and delight. Solving the worlds problems over cocktails on the front porch with some of the worlds most beautiful scenery in the background. Too many other memories to list. My group simply calls it the ""Best Week Of the Year."
6315614,Walleye2242,2019-04-26 14:35:00,263,"well....i cant pick 1 trip because of how time has changed the group and my age. When I was young(7-12 years) we had a huge group of older guys. 10 to 14 guys would go. My gramps and dad organized the trip. It was full course meals....huge breakfast, shore lunch, big dinners..was a big production. Now that i am 47 i look back and sure do miss those trips and all that went into it. Now the group is like 4 guys and our meals are very simple and quick. we fish more now than we did just because of the eating and meals. My first trip in late sept. a few years ago is up there. just 2 of us and we killed the fish. Meals were quick and easy. bought everything up in canada instead of hauling it all. I think i packed in 20 minutes for that trip. Long ago we would haul trailers and be packed down with food. so both ends of the spectrum...i like the way we do it now but i do miss the old group and things like that."
6315642,Mike Borger,2019-04-26 16:31:00,1554,"I've been on countless trips, all of them great in their own way, but I spent 16 nights paddling deep into the interior of Algonquin Park with my 11 year old son last May, then we did 16 nights paddling Quetico in July. Both trips were incredible, for more reasons than I can articulate they're the two best to date.I have a very busy travel schedule again this year and I'll be flying into some incredible lakes along with my boy. But the trip I'm anticipating the most is our 10 day spring canoe trip in May.I'm a paddler at heart, love the adventure of it all and including my son is the best thing ever. That was a great story, thanks for sharing! This hits home though and you're absolutely right. Hope your season is a good one!"
6315662,fishmanric,2019-04-26 17:46:00,219,"First ever trip to Canada with neighborhood friends and family. That was in 1976 and the lake was North Caribou. The fishing was like a fairytale with monster pike galore along with spots that held untold walleye. Canvas tents and a outhouse were all we had but who cared, total price for that trip was around $350 per person. The only drawback was we were the first ones in and some of the equipment (outboard motors) needed repair in order to work. I loved it si much I have been returning to Canada ever since."

I had the privilege to spend 8 days @ this camp & shared the trip with 7 others. #2. We picked-up our float plane out of Yellowknife, NWT. #3. As a group we caught between 1200 & 1300 Northern Pike for 6&1/2 days out of the 8 @ camp. Weathered for 1&1/2 days of the trip. #4. Our tally of Pike over 40"", was in the neighborhood of 350+ & several just made 50"". 100's of 36""+ Pike & only minutes away from camp. #5. The key to the trips success was the fact that the ""Whitefish"" were staging for their spawn up the mouth of the Tolston River & the Pike were in there for a feast! #6. No question for me, that it was a ""Trip of a Lifetime""! P.S. Go to the ""search"" feature here on WC & look-up the original thread: ""Fishing Trip of a Lifetime"", my post (#19) if U have any further interest in the trip with more details.

Titan - thanks for a great story of mice and men, I have many similar remembrances of tiny little scurrying feet across the cabins. Also thanks for reminding us of that which is of most importance. Perhaps my fondest memory of the wilderness goes back to a camping trip on Obabikon Lake, LOW. Three good friends and I camped in late September or early Oct., in the early 1990's. One no-wind morning we awoke to a beauty of a fog bank which shifted gently as the morning sun attempted to penetrate it. The low clouds continually shifted, but covered the sun with such magnitude that it masqueraded as the moon, an almost darker night-time occurrence. This display went on for perhaps 1/2 an hour, and I filmed much of it. It was an almost out of this world happening, and later my filming was shown on a local TV station, shown longer than the usual cameo nature picture. The fishing that trip was great, but the viewing was phenomenal. So, perhaps, it is more about friends and family, nature, and wilderness. ""And why do you go there?"" They asked. ""For the water, the land, and the sky."" I replied. ""But that's everywhere."" I heard them say. And I knew that they didn't understand. Copyright 2008 William A. Krejca"

Walleyes weren't real big, but they were hungry and not at all picky. Once I set my rod across the gunwales to do something and the jig was maybe a foot down. All of a sudden my rod tip was bouncing. Lots of nice pike that trip as a bonus.My first ice-out pike trip to Reed Lake, Manitoba was great also. Lots of 40"" plus pike back in the shallow north side bays. You could often see them chasing your bait. We also caught walleyes, pike, whitefish and lakers on the same reef."

Then, I took the family to Alaska last year... I do not think that my family will ever want to go to Canada again! Alaska was truly amazing......the scenery.....the wildlife.....the fishing...incredible!!! A person is not limited to two(2) walleye to enjoy for an entire year!! Every time we break out a couple of packages of Halibut, we recount the crazy fishing that we had in Alaska. While we did not catch a triple-digit Halibut, we did catch several Halibut over 30 pounds!!! We brought over 125 pounds of fish - multiple species - Halibut/Salmon/Rock Fish - back home.... The price for a family of five(5) was close to $3k per person, but that included a lot of sight-seeing events - dog-sledding tour/glacier hands-on tour/grizzly bear seaplane tour (walking within a 100 feet of a sow with her 2 cubs!!!)/several fishing charters/a day cruise amongst the glaciers. When I look back, the cost was minimal compared to the value that our family received. Also! No issues with border Patrol!

He and I did an out lake one day and had a blast. We saw 5 large black bears on the road during our drive to and from the lake. We had to park way up in the woods and then hike about 1/2 mile through mosquito and bear infested jungle to get to where the boat was locked up. We had a phenomenal day of fishing and caught about 80 16-20"" walleyes in about 4 hours. We decided not to keep any fish because of our hike back through bear infested woods. The fishing on our home lake was good too, but not that good. All in all it was a trip that I won't soon forget. Every year is special. It starts with a couple of flights to International Falls. We pick up our rental and get groceries. We drive to Dryden and spend the night. We finish our drive early the following morning and are usually fishing by noon or 1:00 PM. All of the planning and meal coordination come together and we have a great week each year. We are already planning for the following year as soon as we get back home. Tight lines!"

The family that own & operate the camp are great & we go to the same camp every trip. The companionship of the people on the trip with me. This is normally someone that I've known for close to 50 years & it's the only time we get to see each other. finally the fishing The only draw back is the 21 hour drive each way. He has another 10 hours from his house to mine.
