6315384,madnomad,2019-04-26 04:12:00,34,can someone please post this 45 day rule please
6315386,madnomad,2019-04-26 04:15:00,34,"ok,understood....thanks for the clarification"
6315390,madnomad,2019-04-26 05:16:00,34,so canadians still need the certificate to operate a boat any time?
6316074,JAY221,2019-04-28 13:21:00,877,"I checked with the camp that we go to & he said that he has a form to cover this so it is not an issue for us. Later, Jay"
6316332,Angler1700,2019-04-29 13:29:00,37,"Yup. At one time I think there might have been a boat size limit where you needed it if the HP of the engine was over 10HP, but now I think it's any motorized boat. don't quote me on that though. I don't believe you need one to kayak or canoe. I challenged the test 20 years ago at some snowmobile races and have had the card every since. Have never been asked for it, but have been stopped and checked by conservation for alcohol/fish, etc. So it's a bit of a joke up here."
6316342,jjunge,2019-04-29 14:33:00,179,In Nebraska any one born after 1983 needs to complete a Boater Safety Course. The course can be completed on line for $25 or with an instructor for $10. The $10 course it broke down into a 4 hour or 6 hour course. The Boater Safety Course is good for all 50 states and Canada. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

6317986,valley366,2019-05-04 21:53:00,193,My son just completed the course in MN. $25 and all online. He completed it a week of evenings.https://www.boaterexam.com/usa/minnesota/
6318208,dakota eye,2019-05-05 17:38:00,69,It's a commitment but definitely worth it. It took me 6 hours to complete in South Dakota.
6318212,jjunge,2019-05-05 18:09:00,179,I have two class coming up this Month. Going over the material. Those that have taken the class. Several insurance companies offer a discount if you take your certificate to your agent. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
6314734,reddemon2,2019-04-24 10:18:00,255,"I've been going to Canada fishing for yrs, Recently inquired about a trip to a new resort and was told I needed a certificate to operate their boats, What's the story on this?"
6314758,BornToFish,2019-04-24 10:55:00,1224,"Greetings, I assume the ""certificate"" mentioned in the original post pertains to boating competency. I do not claim to know all the intricacies/nuances of the law in Ontario, but believe that boat operators in Ontario are required to have proof of competency as boaters. My wife and I satisfy this requirement by having proof of boating competency from our home state of Wisconsin, as we completed a state DNR boating safety course. When the Ontario law was passed, we went to a license outlet in Wisconsin and paid $3 to have a stub printed that states we passed the course in Wisconsin. We keep this stub with our fishing license. I believe Ontario has reciprocity with many states in the USA. The lodges that I have fished from also satisfy this requirement of boating competency by conducting a boating safety discussion during their Saturday orientation session for new guests. Guests then take a ""quiz"" after the discussion. The lodge owner then signs/dates the form and the guests are good to go. The quiz contains questions such as: You are boating along and notice someone in the water that is frantically waving their arms. What do you do? Hint: don't answer ""wave back"". It's all common sense knowledge. I am aware that there is an internet based course that can be completed, which will satisfy the requirement in Ontario. I know a handful of folks that took this course. There is a fee to take this course. The proof of boating competency in Wisconsin entitles us to a nice discount on the insurance policy that we have for our boat. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6314762,reddemon2,2019-04-24 11:01:00,255,"Never been asked or done and quiz at any resort, hmmm"
6314778,Shorelunch,2019-04-24 11:44:00,554,"I could be off, but I believe in Ontario you need to have a boating certificate only if you're up there for more than 45 consecutive days. https://files.dnr.state.mn.us/recrea...an_boating.pdf"
6314790,dakota eye,2019-04-24 12:18:00,69,"I agree with latest post. That being said, I did take the course and exam offered in South Dakota for a small fee. It was very instructional and does offer reciprocity with Ontario. It is a lifetime certificate by the way if I'm not mistaken."
6314828,madnomad,2019-04-24 14:07:00,34,as far as i know you need to have that boater exam certificate to operate any motorboat in Canada at any time i wouldn't ruin my trip by getting caught without one
6314840,TitanD,2019-04-24 14:45:00,43,"How the Regulations Apply to Non-Residents The Regulations apply to non-residents: If they operate their pleasure craft in Canadian waters for more than 45 consecutive days or, If they operate a pleasure craft that is licensed or registered in Canada (including rented or chartered boats). The Regulations do not apply to non-residents who operate their pleasure craft in Canadian waters for less than 45 consecutive days. Please note that a proof of residence will be required on board at all times. Acceptable Proof of Competency for Non-Residents For non-residents, proof of competency can take one of three forms: A Canadian-issued pleasure craft operator card. A completed boat rental safety check-list (for power-driven rental boats). An operator card or equivalent that meets the requirements of their state or country. https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafet...sitor-1610.htm"
6314878,adempsey2.0,2019-04-24 16:27:00,611,"As above, you just need the go over the safety check-list and sign it. However, what the resort asks of you might be different. Best to call and clarify. I would provide them the link to that site as well. There is a lot of misinformation about this. It is a complete joke anyway."
6314908,BornToFish,2019-04-24 17:55:00,1224,"Greetings, In reference to Titan's post on this thread, my wife and I fell under the second bullet point as we rent a lodge fishing boat that is registered in Ontario. We prove our competency as boat operators through the sixth bullet point - the proof of having successfully completed a boat safety course in Wisconsin. Many guests at the fishing lodges fulfilled the requirement of boating competency through the fifth bullet point - the boat rental safety check list. There were many years at these lodges that guests completed the instructional class and safety quiz (ca. 10 minutes) and then went to the dock for instruction in how to operate the outboard motor and boating around the dock (ca. 10-15 minutes). This seemed unnecessary to many guests, but it fulfilled the requirement of a ""qualifying service"" which allowed guests to reclaim 1/2 of their HST paid for their stay at the lodge. These simple activities (the instruction and quiz, ca. 20 minutes) saved many people hundreds of dollars. I will note that I have never been asked by an officer of the MNR for proof of having completed a boating safety course. But, it seems as though there is a first time for everything. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6315136,Ricky Spanish,2019-04-25 10:55:00,1298,"Q. What if I don't live in Canada, but boat there? A. Non-residents only need to obtain a Pleasure Craft Operator Card if they are operating their powered boat in Canadian waters for more than 45 consecutive days or if the boat they are operating is registered or licensed in Canada (this includes rented boats). Boater Education Cards or equivalent certifications are recognized in Canada. Proper identification should be kept on board at all times to provide proof of residency."
