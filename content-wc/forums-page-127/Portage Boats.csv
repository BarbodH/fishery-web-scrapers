I'd imagine owners would grab motors at the end of the season and store, but what about the boats? Do they simply flip them over for winter time or do owners bring boats back to camp?"

There may also be conditions applied to these boat caches, such as a catch and release policy. Cache boats must display the boat cache permit number on the bow. A more recent condition is allowing only one commercial boat cache per lake.....back in the day this was different and you may find lakes that have several commercial boat caches. A similar policy exists for private residents / trappers etc who want to leave a boat on a lake. There is no requirement to bring the boats back to camp for the winter so they are flipped over."
