6240292,Pat T,2018-09-02 08:50:00,221,Are there still fire bans in Red Lake region? Leaving in 3 weeks and curious to know if we will be able to have fish fries at shore lunch.
6240310,Huntindave,2018-09-02 09:59:00,2194,"Just got back from LOTW in Ontario. Fire ban in effect there. That said the walleye guides were loading LP stoves into their boats on a daily basis for shore lunch. You can still have shore lunch with a fire ban in effect. You just have to use a stove rather than a ground fire. Same thing at the resort in the evening, no campfires allowed during fire ban."
6240320,tandm,2018-09-02 10:17:00,679,"2 weeks ago, the ban extended across most of Northwest Ontario. Maps were being passed out at Fort Francis, just past customs. Propane or other contained fuel burners are allowed, but no open fires. Several islands were burning on the west end of Lac Seul. Cause was lightning.Talked to a resort operator near Sioux lLookout Monday. He said the burn ban was still in affect and was being expanded.Take a propane stove with you, if you have to have a shore lunch."
6240352,x4flatfish,2018-09-02 11:58:00,319,Returned Thursday from Lac Suel. Heard on the radio that the fire ban had been lifted at midnight on Wed 8/29. I think this was for zone 4. Could smell smoke and see haze from fires when we were around Taylor Island with a west wind.
6240376,Golden Eagle,2018-09-02 14:01:00,2642,"Yep, lifted but I won't be having any shore lunches. Called a few minutes ago to book the September 8 week. Gives me a new moon, 1 day prior and 2 days after. If fishing and weather conditions are favorable I may stay 2 weeks. Or might stay until August. That's what one pilot said to me when he thought I had too much gear. Went in in May and he asked if I were staying until April. I had all the food for a 4 person party."
6240544,pjshorthorn,2018-09-03 07:02:00,5654,"I've always said that after each trip up north, it gets harder and harder to cross back into the US. One of these trips I'm just going to stay permanently PjShorthorn"
6240586,Golden Eagle,2018-09-03 08:31:00,2642,"And people say you and I are the crazy ones. Made a 7 week fishing trip to Chapleau area in 1960. Slept on the ground. Made 3 trips in 2005, for total of 6 weeks in camp. No regrets. Arriving at camp this Saturday for #3 this season. Fishing line likes being wet."
6240672,pjshorthorn,2018-09-03 13:14:00,5654,"I say let everyone think we are crazy!!!!! I am a ""little bit "" certifiable on my own admission. 25 years ago I told my wife that if she were to pass when the kids were young, I was taking them to Canada to open my own bait shop. She said.......over her dead body. I said......ok then, you'll never know if I did. I'm pretty sure she expects that I may not come back as planned one day....LOL. As a side note, you ought to get in touch with Breezy Point and have him give you his story about traversing all of Lac Seul from one side to the other as a young man. Pretty interesting story. PjShorthorn"
6318250,bushead11,2019-05-05 22:01:00,151,Headed up for the walleye opener near ear falls. There have been fire bans the last few years. Just wanted to check to see if there were any so far in 2019. I know the ice is still on the lakes in a bunch of places but was just curious. Thanks in advance!
