There is no easy way to tell you this, so I will just go ahead  We have resigned as a MNRF licence issuer effective immediately. As you know, the MNRF is promoting their automated approach to purchasing hunting and fishing licences online, including encouraging patrons to print their licences at home or save them in a digital format on a smartphone. Service Ontario offices also offer the service Monday through Friday. The MNRF has also changed the rules for their outside issuers  they are no longer providing any equipment. As an outside issuer, I would be required to supply my own computer, printer, paper, etc. After careful consideration of the remuneration that the MNRF would pay as issuing fees and other factors, we have decided that there is no longer enough room for us in this system. Please be advised we are still offering all of our other retail services including quality fishing tackle, live bait, ice, firearms, hunting and camping supplies and much more, and are open from 9:00AM to 6:00PM 7 days a week in season."
