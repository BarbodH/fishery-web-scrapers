Overall the experience was amazing. Debbie Alexander who's been managing that camp for 21 years is an incredible host. The camp itself was maybe the nicest remote facility I've visited. Our cabin was on a point on a broad expanse of white sand beach with an incredible view of the lake. I uploaded a couple of shots of the spot directly to this post.Walleye fishing was consistently great, with good numbers of above average sized fish. Finding larger pike was a true challenge, although we did get a couple. There's a story behind the giant my boat partner caught that is truly remarkable. Cosmic forces were definitely at play. It was the kind of occurrence that strengthens ones belief in a higher power and that's not an exaggeration in the slightest.You can see the full story here:https://www.canadafishingguide.net/s...t-of-wabakimi/Cheers,Mike"

6316728,Mike Borger,2019-04-30 17:47:00,1554,"Most of mine don't smile like that either. Steph is great, lots of enthusiasm for the sport."
6316880,kona77,2019-05-01 06:55:00,236,Mike- Good report (as usual) and I agree the amenities/cabin/location at Smoothrock look great.. Always nice to be in a boat with anyone experiencing their first outpost fishing trip.. Looks like you have another good fishing partner..
6316932,BornToFish,2019-05-01 08:20:00,1224,"Greetings, Mike: you are a fantastic story teller and a gifted writer and photographer. It didn't take long for me to feel as though I was there, in the boat with you. It looked to me as though we might be seeing Steph in future articles written by you. I hope that we get to enjoy more articles from you in the future. Kindest regards...."

I spoke with Drake one afternoon when we were delayed flying in to Auger Lake with Mattice Lake Outfitters, and Smoothrock is definitely on my short list. Next summer, my brother and I are looking at either Smoothrock or Wilderness North for our July trip. Thanks for the great report!"
