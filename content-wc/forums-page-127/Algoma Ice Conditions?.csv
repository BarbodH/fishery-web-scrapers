6316232,Mike Borger,2019-04-29 07:07:00,1554,My friends who live up there are predicting ice out around May 7-8. Time will tell I guess.
6316234,Waba,2019-04-29 07:17:00,25,"Thanks Mike. Hey are you the same Mike Borger (Canada fishing guide) that has a bunch of fishing vids on youtube? I recently watched a bunch of them. If that is you,man do you ever have a great bunch of beautiful and bountiful lakes in your back pocket! Thanks again Mike."
6316266,Mike Borger,2019-04-29 09:11:00,1554,"Yep that's me! The CFG website is really the gas that drives everything that I do though, not really the youtube videos although they're important.My 15 year old daughter says it's because I'm totally uncool, not in touch with the younger generation and apparently I'm tagging my videos all wrong. I'm reasonably sure she's right about all of that."
6316268,Waba,2019-04-29 09:15:00,25,"Right on.I'll have to check your site out. I guide up in Northern Ontario but spend the off season in the maritimes. Just waiting for the call to get back to my cabin. I really enjoyed the vids,helped pass the long *** winter.Thanks."

6316546,pjshorthorn,2019-04-30 08:12:00,5654,Thanks for vote of confidence !!! I now have another new challenge this weekend to see if paint down south dries quicker than up north where there is still snow. PjShorthorn
6295376,Waba,2019-03-04 17:17:00,25,"Hello folks, Just wondering how the ice conditions are in the Wawa area? I guide at a fly in lodge and wondering how the ice thickness compares to previous years. Hoping to be able to get into the lodge by the 10th of May or so,ice depending of course. Thanks"
6295766,Fisherman1792,2019-03-05 14:26:00,927,Really starting to look like last year at this time with lots of snow and cold weather. If this continues ice will still be made until april. There is approx 3 1/2 to 4 feet of ice as of now. Unless we start to get some warmer weather may 10th might be a little early. Fisherman 1792
