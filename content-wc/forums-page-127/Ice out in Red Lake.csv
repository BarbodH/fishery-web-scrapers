6318604,canadianflyinfishing,2019-05-06 19:34:00,72,The weather has finally warmed and it looks pretty positive with the forecast at this point. The smaller lakes in the are are open and the pond as you come into town opened up a couple days ago so the ice out seems imminent.

6318638,Golden Eagle,2019-05-06 21:41:00,2642,"Are you referring to the small pond on left as we enter Red Lake? If so, Little Vermilion lifts about 7 days after pond opens up. I'm hoping for a May 15 arrival at LV. Huge pike will be willing and ready. Walleyes might still be spawning and hard to get to due to low lake level. Nothing will prevent me from having a great trip."
6318676,canadianflyinfishing,2019-05-07 05:45:00,72,"Correct that is the pond I am referring to. On the left as you come into town, across from the hotel and Tim's. Generally the big lakes are open 7 days after the pond opens up so the season opener is looking positive. https://www.canadianflyinfishing.ca/"

6319150,canadianflyinfishing,2019-05-08 05:54:00,72,Was able to get out yesterday and our Chief pilot got this picture. Overall its 50/50 as of yesterday. Lots of ice on some lakes and wide open on others. Expecting the lakes to open up here in the coming days. You can see pictures daily on instagram or facebook as wellhttps://canadianflyinfishing.ca/
