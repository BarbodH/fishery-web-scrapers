6319190,WiRiver,2019-05-08 07:04:00,13,"I went with a group to Blackbirch lake 2 seasons ago. The lake is fairly small main body of lake was 35 feet at deepest, main body of lake seemed to have a lot of dead area, we never caught any fish not associated with weeds or shoreline structure. Walleye fishing was like catching panfish you could catch them just about at will, biggest walleye was 27 inches, biggest pike was 39 inches. Average walleye was 20 inches or so never caught any small walleyes. We got a lot of pike 32 to 36 inches. Best area was where Lake Mistassin Flows into Blackbirch there is a large pool there where the walleyes stack up, and around the big island on the southside. As for getting to lakes other than Mistassin all the rivers are blocked with rapids that you have to walk the boat up to get to them. It is a very unique place you should have a blast. Any questions feel free to ask."

6317860,adempsey2.0,2019-05-04 12:20:00,611,"The Bing Maps aerial view will provide a lot of great information.https://binged.it/2PKEHlHThere is a depth map on my site as well:https://fishingoutposts.com/lake-depth-maps/All assuming I have the right location of the camp Sometimes, it is hard to get that information."
6317984,valley366,2019-05-04 21:44:00,193,These are not as accurate as Navionics but will give you a general idea on lakes that may not be available with Navionics.http://www.canadamapsales.com/en/cat...aps/index.html

6318824,schankie,2019-05-07 11:00:00,4,Thanks for all the help. Looks like lake is pretty shallow?

6318858,adempsey2.0,2019-05-07 12:15:00,611,25 feet at the deepest based on the depth map (it is in metres not feet). I am sure it fluctuates quite a bit though.Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk
6318884,Lake Of The Woods,2019-05-07 13:44:00,124,Blackbirch appears to be a Eutrophic lake but the upside is it looks as though you will have access by way of river systems to explore other lakes that my be Oligotrophic or Mesotrophic. I'm sure Eddie can supply you with that information before you commit.
