A summary of MNRF budgets on page 294 of the 2019 Ontario Budget shows that the base MNRF budget planned for 2019-2020 is $602.4 million, which is $19.6 million less than the interim budget for the 2018-2019 fiscal year and $61.6 million less than the actual budget of 2017-2018. The Emergency Forest Firefighting budget planned for 2019-2020 is now $69.8 million, which is $142.2 million less than the interim budget for the 2018-2019 fiscal year and $47.2 million less than the actual budget of 2017-2018. It is still unknown how the budget reductions are going to affect MNRF programs, services and staffing levels. OOD did submit questions asking how the cuts would be applied within the MNRF, and was directed to find the information in the 2019 Budget, however specifics of how individual ministries will apply their funding changes are not detailed in that document. MNRF Director of Communications Justine Lewkowicz did say that the reduction in Emergency Forest Fighting budget has been misrepresented by some media sources. The Ontario government provides base funding of almost $70 million each year to support front-line efforts to fight wildland fires, she said. Funding is re-evaluated as the fire season unfolds. Last year, over 1,300 fires were recorded across the province, which was significantly higher than the 10-year average of 757 fires. Our government invested an additional $142 million for emergency firefighting in 2018 to protect our communities. We will continue to dedicate necessary resources to ensure the safety and protection of our communities. Viewed that way, the Emergency Forest Firefighting budget is at a normal level that will require adjustment depending on the severity of the fire season. Details of how the cuts will affect other aspects of the MNRF will be added as they become available.https://oodmag.com/news/provincial-b...hit-mnrf-hard/"
6317672,That Minnesota guy,2019-05-03 16:23:00,8293,I assume this was just a FYI post? I'll let Canada handle their business. There system works for them and their people have fire protection.
6317678,kzoofisher,2019-05-03 17:18:00,5144,"Yes, just FYI. Seems like there's always a couple threads every year asking about status on fires, this year some folks may want to discuss contingency plan early. Hope no one needs them."
6318252,Lake Of The Woods,2019-05-05 22:52:00,124,"Lived in Kenora for many years and worked for the MNR in the Firefighting, Forestry, Parks and Ministry of Northern Development & Mines. Budget allocations always changed from year to year in all departments. The firefighting budget was usually based on the projected weather conditions and in the event of an intense fire flap season funding was always increased to execute adequate fire suppression for areas in need of the services. During my years involved with firefighting the policy was to extinguish every fire even if it did not pose a threat to a community or area that consisted of valuable merchantable wood supply.However, policy had changed and during my last couple of years of firefighting fires that were burning in the remote areas would be categorized as ' BOB' or ' Being Observed '.The fires were left to burn as long as they continued not to pose a threat to humans and or valuable forested areas the were scheduled for logging operations.Many people think a these 'BOB' fires destroying a significant portion of the wilderness but in reality compared to the vast area of the northern land mass the percentage of burned area is small. I have been on fires that have burned up to 350,000 hectares and although that sounds massive when you fly over the area is appears small in size compared to the surrounding land mass of green forested area. It is also mother natures way of re-birthing our forests and it is amazing to see how a burned area comes back to life within months. Returning to a burned area a year later reveals just how quickly and efficiently nature restores itself with new growth and habitat.Also, there were a few summers I can remember that the fire season was so busy mostly due to lighting strikes that firefighting crews were flown in from British Columbia, Alberta, North Dakota, Idaho, Wyoming and Oregon to assist Ontario crews."
