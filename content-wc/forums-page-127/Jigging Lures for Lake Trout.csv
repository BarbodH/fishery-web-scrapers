My group used to troll Lakers utilizing Dipsey Divers for depth control along with spoons & crankbaits. Over the last few years we have really dialed in on vertical jigging for Lakers. The (2) best lures we have found are 10oz Muskie Bondy Baits and 2 to 4 oz Shimano Butterfly jigs. With these lures we can jig in 40 to 120 feet of water with no problem as they get to the bottom quickly. What are your go to lures for Lake Trout?

The other, go to bait we jigged with was a Zman 6"" Swimmerz rigged on a 2 oz Kalin Ultimate Jighead. The best color by far was the Breaking Bream. The guides on Slave also fish a lot with large 6"" white tube jigs. Nothing better than jigging a 20 pound Laker out of 100 ft. of water!"
