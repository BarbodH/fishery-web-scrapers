Has it been a wet/dry spring? What are water levels/temps like? Where is everyone finding the walleye? Thanks, and tight lines."

We're pretty much done running the falls from Pelican to Lac Seul, very low water. It's dry now in the bush, not much rain recently. This week is going to be sunny/warm. Summer is definitely here, walleye are on the main lake basin humps in 18-25' but also some fish relating to the weeds in 8-12'. Good luck on your trip."
