1328119,Further North,2011-07-10 18:42:00,2008,"Late with the report...We got back on 6/26...caught lots of fish...Harris Bay resort is a class operation, with access to tons of great lakes to fish besides Sturgeon Lake. Modern, well appointed cabins, great launch facilities, and above all, Claus Otto runs a great camp and is more than willing to give good tips on where to fish.Pictures: http://s189.photobucket.com/albums/z...011/?start=allNone of the fish in the pictures are fly-caught as the wind was absurd the 2nd through 5th days of the trip...so I got frustrated and said screw it and took the FF-ing stuff out of the boat so I didn't wreck any of them by stepping on them. I got out by myself for about 2 hours on Friday morning in the calm...caught a bunch of pike on flies a guy from the WI FF-in BBS sent me...but I left the $%&%# camera at the cabin.We tried to keep track of what we caught...until about noon on the first day, then just plain gave up. We caught 3 pike under 24"", the rest were 24""-31"". No big 'uns, but the pure numbers of fish were astonishing. At one point, in one little bay we counted 10 pike visible from the boat at the same time...my attempt to catch ""the big one"" in that bay was frustrated by a 29"" fish that I didn't see that I dropped the lure on top of...I hate it when that happens.Here's a pic of my brother: http://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z...1/DSCF1019.jpg...what's cool about that pic not the 31"" pike...but the tooth marks on it's back...they are about 5 1/4"" wide. I want a piece of that fish...All the walleyes were between 19"" and 23"", with one exception, I caught one little 14"" cigar. I learned more about catching walleye's in 6 days than I have in the previous 4 years. I confirmed to myself that it's a strategy game and a great way to take a break from 12-14 hour days throwing lures. My back and my arm thanked me for that...The smallies were kind of a weird situation for me...many were still spawning, so we left them alone...only to find some seriously aggressive fish that were clearly post spawn and really on the feed bag. We caught 2 8""-9"" and every other one with (one exception) was between 18"" and 20""...the lone exception being a 23"" slob of a fish that clobbered the wrong kind of lure in the wrong water...I still don't know what she was doing there, or what made her hit, but she darn near pulled the rod out of my hand...another very cool thing we saw was in a river between two lakes that we had to navigate, we passed through a literal 'herd"" of smallies - if there were 10 fish, there were easily 50...very cool to see.We saw one moose, to far away along the road to get a picture, and several black bears.This picture... http://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z...1/DSCF1077.jpg has kind of an interesting story to it...We were out on the main lake beating up pike about 8PM on Thursday night, and we turned to look west and saw what looked like fog rolling toward us.When it got to us, it turned out it smelled like smoke. Turned out someone had tried to burn down Canada about 90 miles west of us, north of Sioux Lookout.We were about 15 miles from camp, and could not see squat on the way back...made that trip fun....If anyone has questions about any of the pics, just ask...I'd like to be able to say that no fish were harmed during the digital recording of the pictures...but a lot of sore lips resulted from the week's trip...I will be going back."
1328139,Bill Krejca,2011-07-10 19:27:00,6107,"Good report, enjoyed the pictures. Re: the fish with the tooth marks - when I see these on a good size fish, I've always kind of felt that perhaps two critters were after the same bait and sort of collided with each other, resulting in one getting chewed a little. I will admit it's more fun to image the hungry mother of all fish out there, and maybe that's what really happened, could have been a giant laker. Again, enjoyed the report and the pictures. Bill Krejca"
1328149,Further North,2011-07-10 19:59:00,2008,"Could be...not sure how a collision between two fish would result in tooth marks across the back, and on both sides of the pike...but it's possible. We were a long way from deep water where the lakers hang out, and that cut closest to my brother's hand is awfully wide and deep...I still want a piece of whatever it was what was 5 1/4"" across the jaws..."
1328153,Catman59,2011-07-10 20:08:00,345,Looks like a fun trip. Thanks for sharing. I will be heading to Sturgeon in 2 days. Sounds real dry up there ---- there is a fire on the Northeast arm of the lake right now !!
1328185,Further North,2011-07-10 21:16:00,2008,"It was anything but dry when we were there. We had rain on the way up Saturday, most of the day Sunday, a couple of nights, and part of the day Thursday.Good luck. If it helps any, we put every one of those fish back..."
1306582,JJJMN,2011-05-13 18:01:00,153,Trappers Point has a public launch. Going north it's the next right turn after Bergmans Camp Midgard. If you miss it the next road would be to Rusy Myers. Can't remember if the road had a public launch sign to direct you or not. The launch has some parking but not much. Bergmans also for a fee.
1306599,Further North,2011-05-13 19:17:00,2008,"Thanks again, folks."
1309494,Guest,2011-05-20 16:09:00,0,"I have been going to Sturgeon for 11 years and switched to Gulp alive 3 years ago. I still use live bait because everyone doesn't all use Gulp. But, I consistent catch as many walleyes and usually bigger. Bring a bucket of 3 inch shad Gulp Alive and you won't be disappointed."
1309497,Guest,2011-05-20 16:13:00,0,"If you're up for a challenge portage to Princess Lake. It gets fished virtually never and is a small portage from Coveney Island. It takes a bit of some rough portaging, but, you will not be disappointed. huge Walleyes and tons of them and it's a small lake so it will take you about 20 minutes to find fish..Well worth it."
1309662,Further North,2011-05-21 08:23:00,2008,"Try some Trigger X this year. Locally, it works better than Gulp...I'm taking a bunch of both up with me in June."
1309665,Further North,2011-05-21 08:28:00,2008,I found it on the map...that looks like quite a hike from Sturgeon Lake...do you take a canoe in there?I'll be fishing out of an 18 ft. Lund Pro-V...so picking that up and carrying it isn't going to work....
1310527,JJJ4,2011-05-23 20:17:00,16,Has Anybody fished Sturgeon opening week? How's it looking this year.
1314344,JJJMN,2011-06-03 15:47:00,153,The opener this year was fantastic at Sturgeon. Mainly fished the bay at Trappers point and had 4 out of 5 day's of the best walleye fishing in 20 years of going to Sturgeon. Easy 30 to 50 fish per day. 16 to 23 inch range. Didn't bother to travel much except for Lake Trout. Northerns were also everywhere. Great trip.
1314777,Further North,2011-06-05 15:51:00,2008,Great to hear...we leave on the 18th...I'm ampped....
1314779,plumberjoe,2011-06-05 16:03:00,54,"We fished Sturgeon opening week with great results. Fish were up shallow. They wanted a shoreline that the wind was blowing on. Spent all of our time in the northeast arm our largest was 29"" with another 10 over 26"". Our group of 6 boated approx 600 walleye. Majority of our fish came on jig and minnow we tried gulp and other plastics with some success. Can't wait till next year."
1306224,iman63,2011-05-12 19:16:00,91,You could rent a boat from Whiskey Jack's lodge. They have several boats on this lake. I do not believe you can get into Sturgeon from Squaw without a lot of work. If you do let us know. Interesting.
1306292,Further North,2011-05-12 22:21:00,2008,"Where on Sturgeon Lake is trapper's Point, and where is Squaw Lake in relation to Sturgeon Lake?I appreciate any help!"
1306304,JJJMN,2011-05-13 00:00:00,153,"Trappers Point is at the far north end of lake, about 5 miles south of the town of Savant. Squaw I'm not sure. Maybe someone could point it out in relation to Trappers Point and Whiskey Jacks."
1306311,Catman59,2011-05-13 04:39:00,345,If you could drive straight east from the dam ( south end of horizontal ) you would find Squaw. It is east of Sturgeon and north of Vista. You can get there from Sturgeon through Nipigon but it is a pretty tough portage.
1306378,JJJMN,2011-05-13 07:44:00,153,"Is this a close estimate of location of Squaw Lake? i.e. Whiskey Jack is off of Horizantal bay, South end of Horizantal bay and then west? would put it about where the red arrow is. East of Horizantal Bay I'm not aware of anything but Sturgeon in that area. When I hear Nipigon I think of Nipigon bay on Sturgeon Lake which is about straight east on the far east side of the lake. I put in Squaw and Nipigon as estimates (this isn't fact). Map is on other computer and Navonics doesn't show anything for Squaw. Would also like some alternate locations to look into if we have a slow day and want to do some traveling. All the info here is great. Would like to check out Squaw. We have had luck going north of Rusty Myers and doing some fishing from the banks. This was a few years ago when Ice was still on the Trappers Point bay for the opener. Thanks for all the info."
1306414,JJJ4,2011-05-13 09:02:00,16,"Yes, that is where it is. I have attached a picture showing squaw lake.Sorry - I misread your map the first time -- I thought your arrow for Nipigon Bay was where you thought Squaw was. Squaw is basically just to the east of Nipigon Bay."
1306474,Catman59,2011-05-13 11:48:00,345,East of Sturgeon .. east of Nipigon Bay. oposite side of lake from WJack. JJJ4 is correct
1306517,Further North,2011-05-13 14:06:00,2008,Thank you gentlemen....Doubt I'll be getting into Squaw Lake...looks like a looong walk...Might make a run to the North end of the lake though - are there any boat launches that people can use? Either public or private for a fee?
1306541,JJJ4,2011-05-13 15:16:00,16,I have only been there once before (2003) but we are going to the same place again -- Angler's Cove. I know they have a boat launch. You could just stop in and ask to use the launch...
1306574,Catman59,2011-05-13 17:21:00,345,I think there is a public ramp on the Rusty Meyers road .......
1303202,JJJ4,2011-05-05 09:18:00,16,"JJJMN, Thanks for the reply. I was there in 2003 (first and only time I've been to Canada fishing). The group I was with was more into traveling to the outlakes every day. And since I was the ""new guy"", I just went along with the routine. We only fished Sturgeon two times (half a day or so each) and I thought we did just as well for the walley and northern as we did on the outlakes. We didn't even attempt to catch any lake trout. This time, our group will consist of some older folks (my dad and step father) and my son (13) along with 3 younger guys. The 3 of us younger guys could easily do the outlakes, but with my son and the older guys we've decided we would like to stick to Sturgeon as long as we can stay on good fishing. Based on everything I've read on this forum and other forums and what you are saying, I have a feeling there is a misconception of Sturgeon not being any good for the walleys. Thanks again for the information and good luck on your trip! You will be there opening week then? We're going the week of May 28 - June 4."
1305329,JJJ4,2011-05-10 19:42:00,16,Opinions on live bait or artificial for Sturgeon? Gulp?
1305971,JJJMN,2011-05-12 07:35:00,153,Our group of 7 bought 3 tubs of the leaches a few years ago. Still have a few guys bringing them this year. I still go between minnows and live leaches. The old standard is Chartreuse Jig head with white twister tail and minnow. Golden Boys (gold jig head) can also be a winner. We normally buy 1lb of leaches for the week and go through about 6 dozen minnows a day for 7 guys when were not after Northern's or Trout. I also like a floating lindy rig tipped with a minnow. Doesn't take as much skill! One of our guy's got us onto trolling for Northern's using 24ft collapsible poles pulling life size perch and monster size Musky lures. Something to try as there is allot of water in trappers point that hold nice size Northern's.
1305977,JJJ4,2011-05-12 07:46:00,16,"Thanks for the information JJJMN. We are going to also get leaches and minnows.I was looking on the map and it looks like it may be possible to get into the Northeast Arm of Sturgeon from Squaw lake. Do you know if that is possible? I'm thinking that if we wanted to fish the Northeast Arm for a day or two, maybe our best bet would be to drive to Squaw and fish that lake some, then get into the Northeast Arm. As opposed to trying to motor all the way from Trapper's Point to the Nothreast Arm."
1306006,Northern Exposure,2011-05-12 08:41:00,29,"The first lake I ever fished in Canada was Squaw and I saw where the river went out of squaw and into Sturgeon. It was deep at the mouth but I never tried to go up it very far so I can't answer if it is passable all the way. But I will say it is worth a shot, if you can't get thru the day is not lost, you can still fish Squaw and it has alot of walleyes and northerns. One of the best lakes I have fished in canada for numbers and size, good numbers of walleyes mostly 17""-19"" and a ton of northern with many in the upper 30's-low 40's. This was 10 years ago when I fished it and some people I know still go there and they said it isn't as good as it used to be but still a very good lake, one of the best in the area."
1306010,JJJ4,2011-05-12 08:47:00,16,"I think we will give it a try!Do you know how easy/hard it is to get a boat onto Squaw?Our group has 3 boats -- two of which (12 footer and 14 footer) could be handled fairly easily to get into pretty any landing. The third boat however is a 16 footer that would pretty much require a decent launch. We can always rent a boat from the resort for a day, so if we can't back in the 16 footer it won't stop us from giving it a try!"
1306097,Northern Exposure,2011-05-12 11:43:00,29,"The landing at Squaw is about 75 yards off the road, you have to hand carry your boat. There is a fairly steep hill you have to go down but other than that it is an easy trial. We carried 14' boats without any problems. On the west northwest side there is a long skinny bay that runs north and south, fish that for northerns, one every cast all the way up it and some good sized ones too. Good luck"
1306123,JJJ4,2011-05-12 13:07:00,16,"75 yards isn't too bad at all. We'll definitely have to rent a boat to use instead of the 16 footer, but I think we will give it a try. Thanks for the tip on the Northerns!Do you know of any other good walley/northern lakes close to trappers point that would have a decent boat landing to get a trailered boat in?"
1306188,plumberjoe,2011-05-12 17:40:00,54,JJJ4 you can't make it all the way into nipigon from squaw as there is a waterfall where it dumps in. You could portage around it about 150 yards there is a trail.
1306209,JJJ4,2011-05-12 18:46:00,16,"OK, thanks for the head up."
1274008,plumberjoe,2011-02-22 13:46:00,54,All this talk is getting me excited for the opener. Sturgeon is definitley a lake you have to get to know but in my opinion is well worth it. Ya we burn alot of gas about 50 gallons per boat per week. A small price to pay for the seclusion and top notch fishing to be had. Last year we saw two other boats during opening week. In six years we have caught four walleye over 30 and numerous over 27. I was lucky the guy who took me up is on year 20 this year. We find new walleye spots every year. The trout fishing makes it even better. Good luck to everyone.
1274070,Catman59,2011-02-22 16:13:00,345,"I guess I wish I knew the lake like the back of my hand !!! I have figured out some spots and techniques that work pretty darn good. I have had the oportunity to fish with Sturgeon lake veterans ... one with 40 years of experience under his belt. I mark the spots and I keep the presentations in my mind. The lake is HUGE and intimidating but can be figured out. What I have noticed is that very few newcomers come to fish , its mostly people with a few years under their belt. I am sure there are lots better lakes , but I would doubt there are many with less fishing pressure. I have heard the lake is 96% underfished and when you only see 4 -6 boats a week on any given year , I gotta believe it. The Turners ( White Sands Camp) are great people and run a first class camp. ................. I am getting excited too !!! Heading up that way to icefish in about 2 weeks and it cant come soon enough . Good luck with your trips guys !!"
1274114,guidedfishing,2011-02-22 18:13:00,531,"You'll be pretty happy in the big ole lund when the wind starts clipping along out there. I've been in some pretty wicked swells and chops making runs for home when I stayed just a little to long more than once. Make sure you have some trolling spoons, 3/4 to one ounce sonars, blue seem best and some 1 to 1.5 ounce jigs tipped with a white tail to pound some trout. I second Catman on the Turners at White Sands. Its a older camp but they really care that your there and they are just plain good people. good luck GF"

1288127,rnelson,2011-03-28 18:39:00,2,"We have being going to Harris Bay Resort for the last 25 years on opening weekend, very clean resort and very nice people. Walleye fishing can be tough in May, but we always get the walleyes somewhere, we usually always get them in 3 or 4 different spots in Cobb Bay and its really not that long of a ride if you have a motor 50 or greater. In June you should be able to get them in any of the bays on the lake, last year with the ealier ice off, we got them in different bays closer to Harris Bay. If you really want to catch alot of walleyes on a catch and releash lake try Young Lake just 5 miles down the road, 4 of us caught over 300 walleyes in a half day last year, once you find them its just like fishing sunfish. Also had some nice northerns and smallmouth mixed in. Any questions about the resort let me know."
1288203,iman63,2011-03-28 23:58:00,91,"We have fished out of Whiskey Jack's for 30 years. Lake is huge and underfished. As stated in earlier post be VERY CAUTIOUS of rocks and beaver sticks. Have taken a few props out over the years. We catch numbers and sizes of walleyes every year. 3o inchers every openning week with a 32 being the biggest. Northeast arm, Nipicon, and Black bay are all favorites. Fishing this lake you have to have patience at times. Some of our best spots you can go 3 hours without a bite (which could make you think lake is dead, first post of this thread) then feed bag is put on and non stop action. Huge fish of all types. Stained water is our key as well. Again cannot warn you enough about rocks. They are everywhere, midlake, off shore, in deep water you wouldn't expect such a rise. I suggest you take short trips first few times to get to know your part of lake, do not rely on your GPS alone as signals come and go up here. Visit some smaller lakes in area as well. So many bays so many potential spots."

1302987,Guest,2011-05-04 17:45:00,0,We fished at bergmans last year. Had to hunt for walleye. More lake trout then anything. Will not go back
1303009,Guest,2011-05-04 18:56:00,0,Walleye were hard to find. But bigger than average. Will not go back though
1303175,JJJMN,2011-05-05 07:54:00,153,"Weve been staying at Bergmans Camp Midgard for opener for 10+ years. Since they put a line across Trappers Point and made it a Walleye sanctuary until mid June it has changed the fishing. Going straignt out to main lake each side of the bay can be good for walleye depending on wind. You'll see the boats where the walleyes are at (start right at the No Walleye fishing signs going out). Through the bay the first channel on the right is Canoe, this can get you out to the main lake (very shallow for last 500 yards). Each side of bay holds walleye, weve trolled the north side with good success. If you go straignt past Canoe you'll see Rusty Myers (Fly-in Base Camp) on Left, the next channel will be Steam Boat, This takes you to main lake. When you think your starting into the main lake watch for the rocks (watch for rocks everywhere!) as there are a few reefs and too both sides that come up fast. When the depth goes to over 40ft is a good trout area going south kind of parellel to the island on the right. As you go past the first big island if you head west around the island it will take you towards Horizantal bay. Get a good map and get with others in the camp. Weve talked about going other places but we always do good on the walleye, northerns about anytime we want to catch them (15lb plus) and lake trout are everywhere. You don't need to travel more than 10 minutes from Trappers point to get into some good fishing. Are their better places? We use to travel to Nipigon, Black Bay... Boy Scout Island,,, that was when I was in someone elses boat. I like the gelcoat on my ranger just the way it is. Last years rock (been over the spot a 100 times) only cost me $125. Can't wait to get up there, 2 more weeks. Good luck. Our group will continue to go to Sturgeon for many years to come."

I have shot, through there lots of times , but decided to slow down and take my time for a change.......... Now I stay closer to the middle of Horizontal before I throttle back. The last couple years I have been pretty safe as there is an extra 2 ft of water in the lake with all of the rain they have had !!!!. If you stay to the west of Pirate ship I think you are pretty safe . The Northern fishing at the end of Horizontal can be unreal. Yes the lake gets rough in a hurry and its a long ways to camp when it does ."
1273070,Further North,2011-02-20 07:36:00,2008,Rough + Rocks is a bad combo...Which bay is Horizontal Bay?
1273131,guidedfishing,2011-02-20 09:59:00,531,"FurtherNorth, Harris bay is located on the southern end of Sturgeon. Just for reference Sturgeon lake is approx 55 miles long give or take. Horizontal bay would be considered to be in the norther section. I make that distinction based on Sturgeon lake narrows being the dividing line. (totally arbitrary) on my part. It must be around 25 - 30 Kilometers from Harrisbay to the narrows. Horizontal bay is located on the west side of the lake probably around 2/3 way up. from Harris bay. I'm not looking at a map so this is kind of relative. The bay is approx 7 - 9 miles long very narrow and over a 100ft in many places. Its actually one of the easier places to travel, and easy to fish for lakers. Realistically not within reasonable boat range from your location. That's okay you have a lot of good locations on the south end. Jackpot lake will be worth a look, you might be just a little late for jackpot but if its a late spring you could find some walleye action there. Cobb bay will be good but even that will be a trip. You'll have to get thru 3rd, and 2nd bay to get back to 1st bay. I'm sure the resort will get you setup, you also have some very good outlakes you could go to that they may have a boat cache on. I think Harris bay has boats on Lake of Bays but its been awhile. Lake trout look around the east wall of Mountain Island I've done well there. I've also caught trout in the 2nd bay heading back into the 1st bay (3rd, 2nd, 1st bay = Cobb bay). If your going to travel, make sure you have your GPS, and (a map and compass) in my opinion. I have a navionics lake map that I use and I can tell that it does not even come close to marking all the reefs. You can be in 150 water one second and dusting rocks the next. No need to be fearful, just be cautious if you have not traveled an area. Have a extra prop and the tools needed to change it. I must of went thru an area in cobb bay 100 times, then tink on trip 101 i clipped a rock. good luck, you'll have a good time. Don't be afraid to head to an outlake for eye's if your struggling on Sturgeon. Chances are its not you if you are. GF"
1273537,Further North,2011-02-21 11:14:00,2008,"Thanks for the info; is there any chance that either of the bays that are east or west of the green arrow on this map are Horizontal Bay?http://maps.google.com/maps?q=50.020...N&hl=en&tab=wl...or perhaps the one just south on the east side?Looks like a 45 minute run, at least, from Harris Bay."
1273546,plumberjoe,2011-02-21 11:56:00,54,"The bay to the west is Kings Bay we do well for northern in there very rocky. To the east is the northeast arm good walleye in several of the bays up there. The south side of Coveney Island can be good fo walleye, northern, and even trout in the early spring. Horizontal Bay is notrh west of your arrow long skinny bay that parallels highway. All these spots would be a long boat ride."
1273562,Further North,2011-02-21 12:44:00,2008,Thanks - that's a big help.Would it be worth (and would there be a place to put in) hauling the boat down the highway to fish any of those spots?
1273699,guidedfishing,2011-02-21 18:10:00,531,"Further Northhttp://maps.google.com/maps?q=50.020...73442&t=h&z=12Shows horizontal bay running along 599. PlumberJoe is spot on you can just see the south end of Horizontal bay to the north west in your photo.North east arm would be a long run as well, potential for some decent walleye fishing.Do you have down riggers on your boat. Not a requirement but potentially they could be between 40 - 60 feet depending on the weather that time of year. They will come up a long way to hit a crank bait or a spoon. Another real good tactic is vertical jigging. We catch them both ways. I bring this up because in my opinion trout are the number one fish we go after, if your going to fish Sturgeon lake you should be prepared to do some trout fishing, and you will be in prime water down there.I think there is a public landing a further up 599 not sure of the access. Have never paid much attention to it. good luckGF"
1273700,hoosiercanadian,2011-02-21 18:10:00,104,"A 14 foot boat in the back of a pickup would be preferable for this area, the camp owner probably has a boat on some of the smaller lakes that are up and down the road from the big lake. Like others have said this is a good lake trout lake, and a decent pike lake , but it has hard to find populations of walleye, being your first time on the lake it is highly unlikely that you will be able to go out and consistently catch walleye, the fuel consumption and the time it will take to get where they may be will not be worth the effort in my opinion. If you had spent many years fishing this lake and knew it like the back of your hand then maybe you could catch walleye whenever you wanted, like catman,, i fished this area about 15 years ago, used to go to White Sands Camp, they are great people and really became like family, but i spent most of my efforts fishing the surrounding lakes, i had my daughters with me and wanted to get them into catching numbers of walleye. A lot of the surrounding lakes do not have boat launches, some do, as to why i would recomend a carry type boat with a 9.9 you could put on it ."
1273750,Further North,2011-02-21 20:34:00,2008,"That's a good recommendation...but not in the cards for this trip as I have neither a 14 footer, a 9.9 or a pick-up.I'm stuck with my big old Lund and a Trailblazer. But I'll be comfy!"
1271866,Further North,2011-02-16 18:22:00,2008,I will be heading up that way in late June (18th through the 26th); has anyone fished the area and have any recommendations?We will be staying at Harris Bay Resort.
1271884,Needinatripnorth,2011-02-16 19:16:00,6,"There are several Sturgeon Lakes in Ontario - if it is the one just north of Ignace, I was there in the late 90's. At that time Sturgeon Lake was DEAD in terms of walleyes - not a one. We never got the full story - whether they were overfished commercially and wiped out, or if there were water quality issues because of the mine on the east side of the lake. We did catch a couple of Pike and some Lakers in Sturgeon. The lodge owner had rights to several other lakes in the area where he stored boats, so we went to these lakes most of the time. It was OK, but never went back."
1271897,Further North,2011-02-16 19:42:00,2008,That's the one.A guy I work with has been going there for close to 40 years and gave it a sound reccomendation.He says they fish Sturgeon very little and hit the nearby lakes pretty hard.
1271915,Northern Exposure,2011-02-16 20:51:00,29,"I stayed at Whiskey Jacks on the northwest arm of sturgeon about 10 years ago. I went with a group that had been there many times before and still go to the area every year. We went in early june, fishing on sturgeon was tuff for us but we only fished it 2 days. The other 5 days we spent on the smaller lakes they had boats on. On these lakes we did very good. I remember Squaw lake was the best one up there. Caught all the walleyes and northerns you wanted, walleyes ran around 18"" avereage and we caught some huge northerns but no big walleyes(didn't fish for them much). It was my first trip to Canada and I was hooked. After that I got my own group together and we went somewhere else so we weren't ""stepping on their toes"". I would highly recomend the area. The guys I went with have stayed at a couple of different camps on the northwest end and the said they are all about the same."
1271972,Catman59,2011-02-17 06:27:00,345,I guess I must be the lucky one. We have been going there for years and I have caught 100s of Walleyes on the lake. The northerns are awesome as well as the Lakers. Its a big lake with lots of hidden bays to explore. We also do some bush lakes up there also. I stay on the north end so I guess I really cant help you on hotspots. Come to think of it ...... I will be ice fishing there in less than a month !!!!!
1271997,plumberjoe,2011-02-17 07:14:00,54,"I have been going to Sturgeon for the opener for the last six years and always catch lots of walleyes. Not to mention 40"" plus northerns and trout. Last year my Dad and I had an afternoon where we caught 76 walleyes in an hour. The key with Sturgeon for us is to find stained water. We run anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes to the walleye spots."
1272022,JJJMN,2011-02-17 08:15:00,153,"Have been going up to Sturgeon Lake (North of Ignace) for almost 20 years. We stayed at what's now Whisky Jacks in the first few years and then moved to the north end of the lake (Trappers Point) when the owner ship changed. We stay at Bergman's Camp Midgard now. Our group has always scheduled the trip for the opener (3rd Saturday in May). We have been up more than once when the Ice was still on the lake. We never know if the spawn will be on or well past with the walleye moved out of the bay into the rest of the lake. The DNR made the north end of Trappers Point a Walleye Sanctuary until the end of June a few years ago. This had been a real hot spot for us, good old day's. The First Nation still nets where they want. I think this has had an effect on the Walleye bite but we still always catch fish. One of the nice things about Sturgeon is that it is so large with so many bay's that no matter what the weather you can go out 10 minutes from camp and be out of the worst of the weather and still catch fish. We spend a fair amount of time going after Northern's and maybe half a day for the week on Lakers. Exchange Rates, Gas Prices, we've discussed other options for our spring trip but we keep going back. It's a great week that we all look forward to. That reminds me, I still need to send my prop in for rebuild, killer rocks everywhere. We use to travel to mid point on the lake (25+ miles) to go after some Walleye hot spots and Lakers. But that was when I was in someone else's boat. With all the rocks I'm a little less venturous with my fiberglass Ranger on the that lake. That's unless I can get another in the group to be the leader on the longer trips. Just have to make sure you have someone with an aluminum beater in the group. Have a great trip."
1272065,Bill Krejca,2011-02-17 09:34:00,6107,"It has been many years since I fished the lake, maybe around 1985. We camped at the north end at a resort. In late May, the walleyes were difficult to find, perhaps we didn't keep coming back to ""pay our dues"", and figure the lake out. We did experience fairly good lake trout fishing, getting most while still fishing with dead bait. Most folks at the time seemed to feel the lake was great for lakers, but preferred to hit the area's smaller lakes for the best fishing for walleyes. One thing that was very noticeable at the time, was the number of rocks that were not marked on the maps we had - perhaps that has gotten better. I would suggest a careful sit-down with the resort owner to complete marking of the what I would call ""unmarked mine fields."" Man, it was close to a nightmare. It is a beautiful area, just keep in mind the rock gardens. Bill"
1272118,Catman59,2011-02-17 12:02:00,345,LOTS and LOTS of rocks. I was coming down from plane on Horizontal and took out a prop. Had no idea until it hit. I still like to take my time and GPS !!!! Last year one morning my wife and I had 50 Walleyes to the boat before breakfast break at 8:30 !!!
1272294,guidedfishing,2011-02-17 19:33:00,531,"Have fished Sturgeon for many years. Here is what I know after years of fishing it. Large lake mostly under fished by sports fisherman and usually rare to see to many other boats even during prime fishing. Now walleye fishing can be good in certain locations at certain times. Jackpot lake, Cobb Bay, Northeast Arm along with a few other spots in between. Sturgeon lake is not a consistent walleye lake except a few areas which may take some travel to get to. As much as I love to fish Sturgeon lake I can not tell you that I recommend it as a walleye lake. If you want consistent walleye numbers go to the many out lakes that border Sturgeon there are many. If you are **** bent on catching walleye's Cobb bay is the closest best consistent bet. If its a late spring get in to jack pot. If you have the time and gas run to the Northeast arm. I love fishing Horizontal bay for lake trout, and the lake will give up nice pike if that's your game. I love fishing this lake and have given up a few props to the trout gods myself. Catman did you hit the rock in horizontal bay near pirate ship or further down going out to the main lake? I might add I've been out on the main lake when the wind has come up. Its big and you can end up in some big waves fast. Enough places to stay out of them as well. good luck GF"
