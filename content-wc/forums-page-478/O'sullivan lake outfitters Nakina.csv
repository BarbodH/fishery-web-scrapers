1326905,Mr Ranger,2011-07-07 08:21:00,272,"We just got back from last week. Great week as always two 28"" walleyes and many 20 - 26. Two lakers as well 28"". Fish were very strange this year including being mainly in 20 - 40 feet of water and sometimes the leeward side not windward. Got a few trolling, most pulling harnesses and many jigging larger jigs with plastic. As always you need to search them out. They are there somewhere but do not spend too much time in one spot. This is an awesome fishery and great camp owners. Few bears in camp when we were up but being a Packer Fan we sent them scurrying Sorry. Hardly any bugs but the mayflies were just starting but should be done by the time you get there. If you are up the week of the 16th stop over to see Bill. He and his crew are a great group, super friendly and very good fisherman. Have a great trip"

1327090,tooski,2011-07-07 14:17:00,393,"It is 18 miles from Aroland to Howard and Elsies. Approximately 27 miles from 584 after the 643 turnoff. Road is fine, just don't get behind a trucker. They are on the right down a steep private drive. Heavy equipment at the top of the hill last year, signs are there. Enjoy the bunks."
