Have the fished moved off and out to the mid lake humps and structure yet? I know it's way too early to have this matter much for our trip, but I'm getting excited to go already and looking for some current info, if you have any. I'm jonesing for the tug of a nice fat Canadian walleye on the end of my line. Feed my addiction, please! Thanks! Bill"
