1325303,Golden Eagle,2011-07-02 16:29:00,2642,Are there any auto insurance companies in the U.S. that do NOT provide coverage on their auto policies while driving in Canada? Your insurance card should suffice. I don't see a need for a special card while in Canada.No coverage is provided in Mexico. Must buy additional coverage if venturing to Mexico. No walleyes down there anyway.
1325306,jiggster,2011-07-02 16:47:00,183,"I had always received a card from my insurance agent. Last year when I called, she said it was not needed anymore."
1325370,hoosiercanadian,2011-07-02 20:48:00,104,"I just got one from my insurance company which is State Farm, better safe than sorry. Takes about 5 minutes to print one."
1326645,jiggster,2011-07-06 15:27:00,183,I just got off the phone with my agent. (Allstate). I was told Allstate does not give out cards anymore. Maybe since Allstate is based in Canada. Other insurance co. might still require a card.
1326663,WalleyeWally28,2011-07-06 16:11:00,298,State Farm requires a card. I just call my agent in the spring and he sends me one to cover my summer trips to Canada.
1326990,fishingfever,2011-07-07 10:53:00,85,"I called the Canadian Border Services Agency (customs) just now since this seems to be an important question. They told me there is no customs requirement for nonresidents to show proof of insurance at the border. Vehicle registration is required if asked. The agent told me proof of insurance requirements would be an individual province issue. I then called the OPP at Fort Frances since Ontario is the province I travel to most often. The woman there that I talked to was quite sure that carrying proof of insurance from your company in the states was sufficient. She said there was no document required specific to Ontario. That being said, old habits die hard. It couldn't hurt to have one for my pickup and boat and I will likely call my agent and get a Canadian insurance card as long as they issue them as I have done in the past."
1327051,Golden Eagle,2011-07-07 12:49:00,2642,"Save the trees, cards are not required. U.S. auto policies provide coverage in Canada. Canadian authorities know this.It states in your policy that you are covered in the U.S. and in Canada.YOUR POLICY DOES NOT PROVIDE COVERAGE IN MEXICO."
1324797,GWC,2011-07-01 09:09:00,1021,Anyone know if a Canada Non-Resident Motor Vehicle Liability Card is required & if so do I need one for both the boat & car/truck that I take into Canada? I've been taking one for my Jeep. Of course I have the insurance card required by my local state for both the boat & jeep.Thanks
1324930,Shellback,2011-07-01 14:39:00,8083,I've never been asked to provide an insurance card for my truck or boat crossing into Canada.
1324955,lcwhit,2011-07-01 16:08:00,104,i get one every time i go up. ask your agent. they know what it is.
1324957,lcwhit,2011-07-01 16:09:00,104,"oops didnt see rhe part about the boat. i dont know about boats, never drag one up."
1325029,rather-be-fishin,2011-07-01 20:27:00,429,I get one every year too but have never been asked for it.
1325031,downriverbob,2011-07-01 20:33:00,880,"You are required to have Non-Resident Motor Vehicle Liability Card in your vehicle. I ahve been going to Canada for alot of years but never been asked. You are also required to have proof of insurance for your boat. Again I have never been asked. There are other things required that they don't always ask for but you better have them if they do make an inquiry. There seem to be ""hot items"" every year. I remember years ago someone said they were fined for not have snap on chain connections on their trailer in Ontario. Now you can't trailer your boat in Minnesota with the drain plug in. You just have to try to stay on top things. Bob"
1325182,3M TA3,2011-07-02 09:23:00,2846,"All of the language on this subject that I have read says you should carry. Does not say you shall carry or must carry. I will however contact my insurance rep and get the document. If I'm asked for it, for whatever reason, it will surely save time and energy."
1325215,NARDA 1,2011-07-02 10:29:00,636,When this would come into play is if you would be involved in an accident either with your boat or car. The non-resident card would make things much easier. I have my insurance company issue me one every year. It's great piece of mind.
1325229,Bill Krejca,2011-07-02 11:02:00,6107,What he said. Bill
1325293,Lazy Fisherman,2011-07-02 15:49:00,276,I agree and do the same thing.
