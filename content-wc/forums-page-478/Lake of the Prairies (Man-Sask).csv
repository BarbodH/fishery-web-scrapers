Does anyone know how accurate this is, or how good the fishing is expected to be there this year? Any knowledge would help. Thanks in advance."
512096,Guest,2001-04-23 06:16:00,0,"I was at home for Christmas (live about 20 minutes away on the SK side) and they were running the spillway pretty hard... the river was full up to the banks all along and flowing (and it was -24 degrees during the day, -40+ overnight). Really crappy ice too because of all the heaves... didn't even venture out. However, I haven't heard anything about winter kill - it's a huge body of water, and can't imagine that ""half the fish"" would die... I'll talk to my dad and some friends who are still out that way and see what I can find out. My thoughts would be that it should still be OK... the lake has some HAWGS in it.. the river and spillway is a good spot too... walleye, some HUGE carp, and I've caught catfish there as well. I'll see what I can find out.S."

512098,Guest,2001-04-26 04:40:00,0,"Talked to my father last night - some of his buddies who have cabins and such down at LOTP have heard that there was some winterkill in the lake as well... although they didn't have any numbers. Sounds like fishing may be a bit tougher there this year - I will keep my ears open, and keep you updated. I haven't had any responses on the Fishing Manitoba message board regarding this yet. I guess keeping an eye on the Spring Classic results would be somewhat of an indication as well... S."
512099,Guest,2001-05-08 10:14:00,0,"Derrek - not sure if you were keeping an eye on the Fishing Manitoba Message board, but Bob Sheedy indicates that the winter kill was not as excessive as originally thought. I will post his response here, just as an FYI:""I work with the biologist every day. At first it appeared that there was a heavy kill but that was fish trapped on flats near or above the bridge (Hwy5)> We expected that since Dissolved oxygen was pancaked. Below the powerline it improved and there's little kill below that unless its carp whom don't have enough brain power to get out of the shallow stuff. The lake is fine but until water warms and action picks up, most of the uninitiated will say it's dead. Water is back up and there's no problem launching.Bob Sheedy """

And that was north of the bridge. There is some die off every year, but does not seem to hurt the fishing. Have some fun. The Mad Fisherman Himself"
