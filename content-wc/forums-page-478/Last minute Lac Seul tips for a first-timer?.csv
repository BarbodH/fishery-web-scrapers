1327010,greg2648,2011-07-07 11:23:00,80,We will be fishing the W/NW side at the same time. Weather looks good. Good Luck. Greg.
1327017,whittsend,2011-07-07 11:41:00,14,Good luck to you guys as well! I have heard good things/reports recently - I hope that keeps up. How thick is the usual mayfly hatch on Lac Seul? I have heard that it might be going on while we are up there. Just trying to figure out what to expect. Thanks!
1327061,tv4fish,2011-07-07 13:26:00,2694,"Watch out for rocks If you have a good locator that will ""read at speed"", you WILL find the bottom ""intertesting"". What part of the ""east side"" are you hitting? We did very well last week on walleyes.edit: We saw a LOT of mayfly carcasses - even floating masses of them, still had good fishing"
1327072,greg2648,2011-07-07 13:45:00,80,"I had heard that the mayfly was all but over. I think weather will be the key. Lac Seul water is a little darker, gold has been the go to color for us in the past. Last year we had great luck with red and pink jigs and a minnow. Almost all of 26""+ walleyes were caught trolling spinners, worm and minnow were equal. ""I would rather be lucky than good"". Good Luck. Greg."
1327148,new hips,2011-07-07 17:09:00,498,"Yes Gold #4 colorado blades, and jigs work very well. Always fish were the wind is blowing in, and in between channels/islands. If wind dies, just a lindy rig with half crawler or leech, and just let it sit if you are marking fish. If fish are not active sometimes we go on our favorite point I would put on a egg sinker and a leech or half crawler and 3 cranks off the bottom. We fished Kleiners Point leading into Williams Bay, unreal fishing if the wind was coming down the channel. Awesome body of water."

1327348,wallydave,2011-07-08 07:32:00,2151,"I have never fished the east end of LS, so I can't offer any advise about walleye hot spots, but I will confirm using gold and recommend pink for jigs! Our group fished the NW end, near Ear Falls June 4-10. Gold and pink were the hot colors for us! After 10 trips to LS this was the first year the bite was slow, but gold and pink colors worked the best by far! Be patient, keep moving until you find the bite! Check with your host, they will try to get you on the fish! More fish means more smiles for thier clients, which means more repeat business!"
1327368,rnnonmt,2011-07-08 07:55:00,992,"We were at the NE end of Lac Seul from June 12-19th. Weather was great (warm) never put on the rain gear once. Yeppers on the pink jigs but we did have pretty good success with glow jigs as well. We also had chartruese skirts on the jigs tipped with small minnows. Med/large minnows seem to draw short strikes.... or really ""pre-mature hook sets"" on our part. 8 to 12 ft of water seemed the best. Most action was on a wind blown point/shore line. Although our biggest walleye of the trip was on the calm (eddy side) of a wind blown point. Good Luck. Where you staying on the East end?"
1327409,hawg,2011-07-08 09:29:00,2008,Lots of Ben Gay for your shoulders from all the fish you're going to catch!
