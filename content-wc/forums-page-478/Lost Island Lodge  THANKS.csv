Had a great week which included catching over 1200 Walleye with the biggest being 29"" and a bunch of nice Pike with the biggest being 41"". ALL FISH CAUGHT ON SIRMANSKI JIGS WITH OUR FAVORITE BEING THE CHARTRUESE GLITTER JIG. THANKS TO SHANE, BASIL AND THE ENTIRE LOST ISLAND CREW FOR A GREAT TRIP AND THEIR AWESOME HOSPITALITY.
