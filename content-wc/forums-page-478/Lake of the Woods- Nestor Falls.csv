1327661,Slushfish,2011-07-09 06:20:00,263,Heading to LOTW Nestor Falls this Friday for the second time. We did pretty well last trip but caught as many perch as walleye. Mostly jigging. Gonna spend more time venturing out further this trip for some bigger fish. We have two weeks so we might hit Sioux Narrows too. Any tips or input is much appreciated. Also wondering how LOTW compares to Lac Suel? Thanks Slushfish
