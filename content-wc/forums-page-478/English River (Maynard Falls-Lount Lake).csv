1327691,Harvey_Cochrane,2011-07-09 08:50:00,19,I just got back from a 9 day walleye trip on the English River out of Delaney Lake Lodge. Very comfortable fishing out of their 18ft Lunds/50Yamaha's...especially on this big river. Well...again the river produced the big numbers of fish with some big ones thrown into the mix throughout the trip. Walleye ere all over the place in this system due to the different types of forage for these fish..shiners were doing their thing when I first got here and alot of the walleye were still getting caught way back in the bays...these fish were hit and miss with on day being there and gone the next but if was the wind blown bay or shorelines that had the most of the fish. It was either jig/minnow or pulling spinners tipped with minnow...I also did real good one day using bobbers cause there was no wind that day and instead of running over the fish in the 4-8ft of water I was fishing. Now just in the last 5days of fishing I have noticed that the walleye are coming out of the bays now. I am finding my walleye on the points or first little flats near deep water but still inside the mouth of the bays. It also shouldn't be long before they are all out on the humps throughout the system..don't get me wrong there will still be walleye on weedlines all summer but I believe your bigger ones will come off the humps. Northern fishing is getting good out on the rocks...I'm not fishing the bays anymore for the big fish only if the winds is howling in a bay...and thats only because of the feed there...it's gone. All the baitfish that were in there are gone out now...shiners/perch and most walleye are mostly moved out of the bays. Fishing the English River out of Delaney Lake Lodge is only gonna get better over the rest of the summer....guarenteed.
