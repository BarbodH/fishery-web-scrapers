I am almost 56 and have flown in 35 times . 34 of those since I was 30 . Plus numerous drive in trips and 5 bear hunts . I am in the process now of putting a canoe rack on my atv to use on the next bear hunt which is in 4 weeks . I can't get enough of Ontario . I now work for myself and summers are my slow season so Ontario will see more of me if I can afford the high cost of fuel . Have already spent over $ 700 on gas going to Ontario so far this year . A nursing home won't get that money , Eh ??"
1327788,Pokerbill,2011-07-09 17:51:00,280,"I don't think I am that good of fisherman and I catch alot of Walleyes in Washington. The forty fish days are mostly gone, but fish hard and you'll get a limit and always have a chance for a real pig."
1326451,Bill Krejca,2011-07-06 08:13:00,6107,"I've always felt that firstly, it depends on what a person wants out of their fishing experience. If it is tying into a huge fish, and the fight that develops, in the mid-west it is hard to beat going for flatheads (mud cats). Any number of places in the US will satisfy that passion. If it is poundage of fish, along with a multitude of suppers, it is hard to beat running trot lines for channel cats. Carp fishing can take care of both of those desires. I've done that, and it is fun. The Mississippi, its tributaries, and portions of the Great Lakes give up multitudes of big and tasty game fish. The large southern lakes and other scattered impoundments can produce all the above. So, then I feel it boils down to exactly what it is we are seeking when we go fishing, particularly fishing in Canada. For me, it is great fishing, but it also is a chance to be present in the wilds and experience the entire wilderness experience - the loons and all the other wildlife, a sunset silhouetted by spruce and pine, the smell of the pine, a fragile white pine struggling to survive with it's roots semi-anchored in the moss covered rock, early foggy mist with the sun playing hide and seek as it attempts to create morning, northern lights on a clear night, drifting into a shallow bay and observing in the clear water the multitude of creatures which frequent that estuary. Although the US boundary waters probably offer up much of this world to which I consider of higher priority, I still feel the Canadian experience to be one of the best exchanges - what I have to give for what I get, and I will continue to seek to be there as long as it is physically possible. It just depends on what it is you are seeking. Bill Krejca"
1326511,NARDA 1,2011-07-06 10:09:00,636,My group has been going to the same Canadian lodge for 22 years so it is no longer about the fishing its about the friendship and the wilderness. Even with the lodge being sold last year we have a new friendship to cultivate with the new owners plus we still stay and fish with the original owner for a couple of days. We wouldn't know what to do if we couldn't go. 63 days till we leave.
1326517,camp chef,2011-07-06 10:29:00,915,We pull our boat right past a lot of great fishing water on our way to Canada. As previously mentioned it is not about just the fishing. For us it is getting away to beautiful country filled with wildlife and very gratious people.
1326923,thordoggydog,2011-07-07 08:45:00,51,"I go to canada to see the wilderness, I have been to the BWCA, but prefer to not fish out of a canoe anymore. I have a brother that won't be getting through the border so wanted to take him somewhere that had similar fishing..."
1326957,camp chef,2011-07-07 09:58:00,915,"We've had some wonderful times on the Chippewa Flowage just outside Hayward.I would be lying if I said the actual fishing is as good as Canada,but I wouldn't hesitate to go back if I couldn't cross the border."
1326971,labsrus,2011-07-07 10:24:00,557,"That is a good question In my State we have a lot of really good fishing. The Finger lakes, Niagara River, Lake Erie and Lake Ontario to name a few. I still go to Canada 2 to 3 times a year to fish. Most times it is to a Lake we have been going to since the 1970's. A friend has a cottage on it and I have a key. I can go when ever I want as long as he does not have it rented out. 2 of the trips is with both of our families. This year we are heading to a remote fly-in lake with a group of 6 guys. Is the fishing better, probably not, but the expereince is pretty good."
1327600,Mr Walleye,2011-07-08 18:57:00,29,No where!
1327603,phishfearme,2011-07-08 19:09:00,1242,i agree with mr walleye - no where! phish
1327634,whitedot,2011-07-08 20:56:00,8,Alaska
1327659,phishfearme,2011-07-09 06:02:00,1242,i don't think alaska has walleyes???
1326268,thordoggydog,2011-07-05 18:23:00,51,Where in the usa has walleye fishing close to as good as it is in canada in your opinion?
1326284,Freytown,2011-07-05 19:00:00,770,Lake Erie takes a back seat to no place. The major US river systems have large numbers also.It's the remote wilderness that make Canadian fishing excellant and there is no place in the USA with that much wilderness.
1326285,NemegosendaRiver,2011-07-05 19:01:00,66,The lack of responses in two plus hours should tell you something. I honestly don't know an answer to this question.
1326290,Mike Borger,2011-07-05 19:16:00,1554,Minnesota boundary waters.
1326293,stinkycat,2011-07-05 19:26:00,2018,Depends on the time of the year but Devils Lake ND & LOTW comes to mind.
1326318,fireboat,2011-07-05 20:15:00,752,"ND, SD & KS. Quantity & quality. Closer, able to go more often. 40+ days on the water so far. I used to fish Canada and LOW but for what it cost to go to Canada I can take 3 or more trips closer to home. I didn't work all my life just to take a week long trip to Canada. Even if I lived closer I would still fish the states. The last few times I went to Canada with my family we were treated like criminals at the border. They can keep their fish."
1326327,davenathe,2011-07-05 20:53:00,113,"which border. lol ND, MT and SD can be awesome!"
1326378,troutaholic,2011-07-06 04:03:00,827,"Come on, do you really think that someone will actually give up their ""top secret"" waters. Heck, on the Mississippi River (Pools 4 through 8) we almost have to pay the DNR to put toxic warning labels on our fish to keep the fishermen away!!! Seriously, this last winter was excellent for walleyes (second, fourth largest ever)....this spring/summer has been a challenge because of the high water.....but, in 3 to 4 years...WATCH OUT!!"
1326403,jignminow,2011-07-06 05:52:00,168,"Sturgeon bay!!!!!! You can fish huge smallies during the day. Catch big pike, salmon & trout during the day, troll for giant eyes at night and let's not forget that there are huge Muskies around too that hardly anyone targets.........."
1326423,Larry Mac,2011-07-06 07:12:00,530,"Hi Thordoggydog, If your question is strictly referring to the ""Fishing"" I believe there are several places I.E. Lake Erie, Sturgeon Bay ect. For me the Canadian Wilderness experience is far more than just the fishing and for that reason I believe it is a place unique to itself. If I would pick a place that might come close to the total package I would agree with solopaddler and say the BWCA Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Northern Minnesota. It is a very special and precious place. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
