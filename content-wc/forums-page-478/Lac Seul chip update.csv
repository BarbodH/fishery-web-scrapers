1325730,tjsker,2011-07-04 07:31:00,301,I bought my Navionics chip with the Lac Seul map on it back in early 2009. Has there been any update to that map since?

Maybe Lakemaster would do a HD chart like they did on Rainy and LOW if enough people requested it be done... Those Lakemaster map chips are friggin aweseome for Rainy/LOW, especially the HB versions since you can do shallow water highlight, depth highlight, and depth offset coloring... Here is the ""request a lake"" link for Lakemaster. Put Lac Seul in here... http://www.lakemap.com/requestalake.aspx Here is Navionics.. Can try to request a HD survey here:http://www.navionics.com/NavionicsPr...ementEmail.asp"
