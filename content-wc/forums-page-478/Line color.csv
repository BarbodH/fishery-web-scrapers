1326858,NemegosendaRiver,2011-07-07 06:53:00,66,I use clear 8 lb Trilene XL and Clear 10 lb Trilene XT.

1327203,wallydave,2011-07-07 19:03:00,2151,"I like to use Berkley Vanish Transition clear/gold and Spiderwire EZ mono lo-vis green, both 8lb test. I like the 8lb while jigging for walleye, it helps to land the pike that you catch while jigging for the 'eye;s! My biggest pike this year was 32.5 on an ultralight rigged with the Spiderwire! Big pike on ultralight, that a handful Good luck!"

They are a little pricier than trilene or stren, but worth the $$$$. Just my 2 cents. (I fish most species in WI and spend around 100 days on the water)"
