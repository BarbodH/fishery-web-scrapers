Our group is planning a fish fry this weekend to renew memories and plan for some new ones! The count down would be in the 344 day mark, but who is counting!"
1323555,wallydave,2011-06-28 08:44:00,2151,"Well it has been three weeks since we returned from our trip to Goose Bay Camp on Lac Seul. My walleyes are still in the freezer, although not for long, the fishing clothes have been washed, dried and put away until the next trip. The rods and reels are returned to storage. Now, the memories of long days on the water, the meals shared with our group, and the longing for just a few more days away from work, a few more battles with walleye and pike take up the idle moments, as few as they are, in our day to day world. Yes there is something about getting away, spending time on the water that brings a peace and relaxation, that can only be experianced and never trully explained. The promise of another trip North and the memories of trips before, help to keep the memories alive, until new memories are made again!"
1323607,turtle chain,2011-06-28 10:35:00,1398,How about drinking beer after a long day of fishing and talking stupid by the fire I cant wait until our september trip
1323683,REG,2011-06-28 13:45:00,445,"I know what you mean - we were up north the same week as you in June. What we've been doing for years is a second, mini trip up North - to N Wisconsin in October for Musky fishing. Is it the same as Canada? No. But it's a great little (relatively inexpensive) getaway that's a lot closer and has a lot of relaxation and northwoods that we love. The leaves are changing, the lakes are pretty empty of fishermen, and sometimes we even snag a nice one! And Wisconsin beer is almost as good as Canadian - plus they have curds! Gives us something to look forward to all summer and then it's not as long to wait until spring again. Plus cheer up - we've got a nice, new Bass Pro Shops coming soon in E Peoria..."
1323699,greenie,2011-06-28 14:16:00,87,And they have XLV SUPERBOWL CHAMPIONS.....GREEN BAY PACKERS!!!! WHOO WHO!! For all you Chicago Fans out there.
1323704,wallydave,2011-06-28 14:39:00,2151,"REG, where in Wisconsin? A large group of cheese heads were at camp with us. The Bass Pro will be a place to wander around and look for all the extra gear we don't really need, but a nice distraction all the same. I usaully take a Lienie 12 pak or two up North, along with the Canadian beer both pair well with fresh walleye!"
1323708,Mike Kansas,2011-06-28 14:58:00,1463,Very well said. I can tell that you realize it's about more than catching fish...so much more. All of us that climb in a boat with a friend and enjoy the bounty of mother natures beauty are truly blessed. Mike Kansas
1323718,REG,2011-06-28 15:18:00,445,"We like the Boulder Junction area - many, many lakes to choose from. We have a favorite resort - Evergreen Lodge - where we set up base and then fish a different lake every day - usually just for the 4 day license. The days are shorter in the fall so when it gets dark, we head for the Boulder Beer Bar (or wherever) for some Spotted Cows and Walleye fingers (or whatever). It's a great ""up north"" fix to end the season."
1324095,wallydave,2011-06-29 13:33:00,2151,"I just got off the phone with my old boat and cabin buddy, who now brings his wife and sons fishing. He is ready to set a date for next year's trip! I e-mailed my boat/cabin buddy from this years trip to see if he is up for another trip North! I will have to start hiding a few bucks here and there for a trip to the mighty Lac! A month before this years trip, my wife and I won a trip voucher, so we are looking at a trip to Rome, next spring, the voucher should cover flight and hotel, but we will need meal and shopping $$$! At least we have a year to plan, let the count down begin!"
1324220,rnnonmt,2011-06-29 19:15:00,992,Yep... vivid memories of being 10 years old in 1982 when my Dad first started taking me to Lac Seul. I can still see in my mind the old polaroid picture of me hugging Dad in the boat. My Dad and I went together from 82 to 92 until I left for college. After years of not being able to go we recently started our fishing trip back up in 08. Keeping old memories alive and creating the new ones I am very greatful that I have been fortunate enough to start taking my older son with me since he turned 10 just a couple short years ago. Now its the 3 gens creating memories.
1324455,turtle chain,2011-06-30 10:38:00,1398,That is awesome I hope my step son turns things around after collage and starts up some fishing with us again
