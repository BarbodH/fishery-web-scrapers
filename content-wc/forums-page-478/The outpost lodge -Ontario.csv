We were new to fishing back then and didnyt really know what we were doingb back then. There were many suprises. We got there and found out that the main lake had no walleyes, we had to take our car (loaded with gas, motor and, our tackle, a key to the boat, etc...) down the road and unlock a boat located at another lake. I remember this not being the trip that we expected and quite the work. I remember the lodge owner circllying a map with excitement advising that a group of 4 caught 20 walleyes the prior evening in a spot and everyone was very eager to find this spot. My parents tried though...now I take them fishing. I will say that the food was some of the best we ever had though (assuming that it's the same owners)."

Jim is a great chef with a wonderful dinner served each evening. Jobam (short for Jobamageeshig - sp?)is a very clear lake that is loaded with smallies. There are also some big walleyes to be caught but they are few and far between. I believe I read in a recent newsletter that they were now stocking the lake with walleyes again. Is there better fishing in Ontario - absolutely, but if you know what your doing you can slay some big smallies and you basically have the lake to yourself. My wife and I love to go to the Outpost and fish this lake. Great memories."

Biggest was just over 20"" but had lots from 17"" to 20"". Tiny torpedo was the bait of choice and it was a blast watching the bass smashing the bait in this very clear lake. Jobam has lake trout, bass, white fish, but few pike and walleyes. You need to go down the road a few miles and launch on Tunnel lake for the eyes.We (wife and I) did the breakfast and dinner plan at the lodge and the food was great. Jim is an outstanding chef. Already making plans for next years trip."

Seems like more of a quite get away not a fishing lodge. Just saying. If thats what your looking for than that would be fine. Also seemed like it was off the path enough, the ride up 129 is nice."
1326606,BuckeyeBill,2011-07-06 13:23:00,76,"Jaskonie, one of the reasons I like this lake is because of the wife. It's a smaller lake and even in real windy conditions it doesn't get that rough. She feels very safe on it. I have had her on Lac Seul and Minnitaki in rough conditions and she was scared to death. I also love the super clear water on Jobam which makes it a blast fishing topwater for smallies. I love those brown fish!! How did you guys do on Horwood?"
1327058,Jaskonie,2011-07-07 13:22:00,80,"We caught hundreds of Walleye!! More than half were under 14 inches. We did catch my best guess of 100 walleye between 14 and 18"". Only 3 fish were over 18 with one at 25. Our group was a large one 12 adults 8 kids, so most of the adults didnt fish it to hard but catching was no problem. Got about another 30 pike. All adults took home their 4 limit of walleye plus we fed the group 3 times with big shore lunches. The food at the camp and the boats were fantastic."
1327279,BuckeyeBill,2011-07-07 22:37:00,76,"Sounds like it was a great trip. Neat to see so many kids making the trip. We sure need to pass it down. I saw very few boats heading north and only 2 others at the border. If things don't improve more and more lodges, outfitters, etc will be going out of business."
