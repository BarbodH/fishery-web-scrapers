531075,Guest,2003-05-14 10:59:00,0,"I like using circles for live bait rigging and floats. I am partial to the Gamakatsu Octopus Circle Hooks. They seem to run a little large, so if you normally use a size 6, get their size 8. I primarily use their 6's and 8's. There is less of a tendency to hook fish deep, but it still happens even with the circles."
531076,lt,2003-05-14 17:19:00,13,He's right. I used Octopus Circle Hooks for the first time last year while fishing Press Lake and I really like them. Used them later in the year on Eagle and decided that is all I'm fishing with this year.#6 or#8 they both work great.

531078,rpieske,2003-05-16 16:42:00,1276,I was using them for salt water fishing all winter and decided to use them for walleye also. Seems like great minds move in the same manner.
531079,Guest,2003-05-17 09:28:00,0,"The saltwater hooks (true circle hooks) are that way, but due to operator error (the hookset reflex), I've found that you can get away just fine with a hookset with the freshwater circles that I've used. Now, that is mostly when using floats and most of that time, the terminal rig is distance away from me. Of course, the power transmitted during the hookset will be increasingly diminished the further the float is from me. For a more vertical presentation, like live bait rigs, I still try to consciously tone down my hookset. When comparing the two, you can see the ones that are geared towards freshwater fishing are more or less a modification of a standard octopus style hook, and not as radical of a circle as the saltwater hooks.I, like you, learned to like circle hooks from using them in saltwater, where they can't be beat."
