531028,Guest,2003-05-14 07:05:00,0,What does that have to do with the best route to Ear Falls?
531029,Guest,2003-05-14 08:11:00,0,"I prefer 502 if traveling in daylight, but would avoid that stretch of road at night. Last year our group crossed the border at midnight. We saw a total of 9 moose between Ft. Francis and Dryden and the driver had to swerve hard to miss 2 or 3 of those big suckers."
531030,Guest,2003-05-14 09:55:00,0,"We saw the aftermath of a Moose/Van colision on the way home last year. The large conversion van was smashed, as was the large dead Bull Moose laying on the road a ways back. This guys boat swung sideways and flew of the trailer and landed on the eadge of the woods upside down with the outbaord laying some 50 feet away. It is a very scenic route but you better watch out. I was told at the border that two of the van passengers were seriously injured. Good Fishing"
531026,Hammerhead Herb,2003-05-15 07:22:00,259,I'm flying out of Showalter's just north of Ear Falls.
531031,Vitreum,2003-05-15 13:59:00,221,"we travelled up at dusk last year and saw a large moose and deer in the ditch. neither crossed. on the way back saw 2 dead bear in the roadway. you really need to slow down through there. most guys, however, far exceed the speed limit. fishing 6 1/2 days, you will be there for 150 plus hours. that last fifty miles at 60 mph takes 50 minutes. at 50 mph, it takes an hour. what's 10 minutes in a week. nothing. slow down and enjoy the beautiful scenery."
531032,Guest,2003-05-16 05:34:00,0,"We take 502 and drive it at night. We have nick named it ""Moose Highway"". Last year we say a large service truck broke down and a dead moose. Be careful! The first and only rest area going north on 502 may provide a look at bears going through the rest area garbage cans. And when you get to Dryden, the all night gas station has some pretty good chicken on a stick."
531017,Hammerhead Herb,2003-05-13 08:35:00,259,"Going through International Falls to Ear Falls, is it better to take 502 to Dryden, then 17 to Vermilion Bay and the onto Ear Falls. Or should you take 71 N to 17 and then on to Vermilion Bay to Ear Falls. My sense is that 71 is a better road than 502 but the distance is longer. Has anyone looked at this in depth?"
531018,Trailerguy,2003-05-13 08:41:00,1407,"That is about it, in a nutshell. 502 is shorter & rougher, 71 is longer, smoother and more heavily patroled ;) ."
531019,2 DOGS,2003-05-13 10:15:00,361,"Before you take 502, fill your tank, your belly, and use the facilities. Then say a little prayer that you won't have a breakdown, cause you won't find anything for many, many miles."
531020,Guest,2003-05-13 12:30:00,0,"I driven them both, and prefer the 502 route. 502 is mostly paved now, I think it is a more scenic drive and will save you 30 - 60 minutes. You're not really going that far, so gas, etc should not be an issue."
531021,Hammerhead Herb,2003-05-13 14:55:00,259,I will be towing a trailer. Does that make a difference.
531022,rebelrn2001,2003-05-13 15:38:00,1563,"Just be sure you are able to keep your vehicle under control. I did have a moose cross my path a few years ago and have seen a couple dead ones on the side of the road. You DO NOT want to hit one of those. They may loose the battle but your vehicle will cerainly feel the pain. 502 has some areas where, if the road is bad, you cross into the other lane to avoid the pot holes so be careful you are not doing that in an area where another car/truck/semi may be coming around the curve. My boat is in the shop now to have the breaks worked on. I have a leak in a line somewhere so the fluid level drops fast. 502 is an area where I WANT my breaks to work, especially if I need them. We are leaving in 396 hours...but who is counting."
531023,Vitreum,2003-05-13 15:50:00,221,"i find 502 to be a good road. but, i was raised in illinois, so what do i know?"
531024,Guest,2003-05-13 16:11:00,0,"I have made the drive twice a year for nearly 30 years (OK so ten of those years was as the non-driver because I was young).Both routes have merits. I would put 502 only about 30 - 45 minutes faster if your pulling a boat. Every year we bet on the number of trailers off to the side of 502. Most of the issues fall in a couple of categories: (1) pulling junk. I remain amazed at the poor trailers guys try to use to pull boats. Sure the old boat does not need a great trailer when your going to lake 20 miles from home, but some of these heaps of junk are not designed to be taken 1000 miles from home and driven over interstates at 75 mph and then on 502 with potholes the size of small boulders, then (2) people that are in such a rush to get to the lake/resort that they decide their vehicle is capable of flying, even when pulling a trailer. 502 has plenty of issues, even with the work that has been done in the last two years. It is narrow, it has no decent shoulder in long streches, their are and always will be potholes, and at night and early morning, you will find deer, moose, bear, and smaller stuff using it as game trail. Point being when you combine those with guys wanting to do 70 mph while pulling a trailer (good or bad), stuff happens.502 is route we have decided to take for the last six years, but getting to the lake even a half hour earlier is not worth the way some of these folks drive, so we take our time and enjoy the moment. My best advice is go over the trailer before you go and do the maintainance it may need (repack the bearings, grease everything, check lights, brake fluid, eletrical connections, etc. If you don't know how (yes, lots of folks with trailers don't do their own maintainance) then pay somebody to do it. My point in all this is no matter which road you take, prepare before you go, take your time getting there. If you beat me today by a half hour, good for you, but break down on either road for any reason, and you lose a day or more. Loved the guy last year that lost his trailer for some reason and he was picking up pieces of his bass boat for a good quarter mile. Good luck and enjoy the trip, make it one of many great moments!"
531025,JoeUpnorth,2003-05-13 19:35:00,17,"Herb,We use the 502 every year and I really don't think it is all that bad. Yes, there are a few pot holes but if you are paying attention and not trying to break a record for how fast you get to the lodge it will do just fine. It isn't a gravel logging road after all.Where in Ear Falls are you going?Good luck fishing and have a great time."
531027,River Rat,2003-05-13 20:59:00,43,"World-wide, Illinois is known for three things: Al Capone, bad roads and crooked Chicago politicians. Now, sadly, we must add crooked Kankankee politicians (George Ryan)."
