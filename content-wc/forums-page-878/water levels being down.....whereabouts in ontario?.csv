It almost sunk 1 of our 3 boats and the other 2 boats (an 18' Alumnacraft and a brand spanking new 617 Ranger) were tied up to a different dock and the boats and dock and everything else (all tied together) got blown right off the island trailing extension cords. All was rescued but it took the rest of the day. The storm also washed out the road between Nestor Falls and Fort Frances and also washed out 502 between Dryden and Fort Frances so we had to drive all the way to Pidgeon River to come down to Duluth. It turned our nice 6 hour drive into an 11 1/2 hour drive. These lakes can go from 3 feet down to ""normal"" in 2 hours. (You just don't want to be there when it happens.) Scott"
