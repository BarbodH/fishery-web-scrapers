530936,nemio,2003-05-13 09:28:00,96,She is in fact very understanding and also she is coming 2 times with me and my 7 years old son.They also join me for lake trout fishing and lanlock salmon on Lake Champlain and also on Lake Ontario (east) and this is apart of some walleye and SM around Monytreal.I'm spoiled and I know it.Good fishing!
530940,McQ,2003-05-13 12:49:00,615,"NemioI'll be going up around the same time in June, when we get closer to the date I'll let you know.I'll be on Baie de Sud, do you think I'll be able to get through the river to your place, will be bringing the 18'er up."
530941,nemio,2003-05-13 14:07:00,96,"If your talking about coming end of june I will let you know if the narrow between baie du sud & north are deep enough to pass.; if it's 1st. week-end of june will learn at the same time. I'm actually waiting to get an answer from my friend Attikamekw to borrow his radio-phone, so if you are on the gouin same time as me I can phone in one night at your outfiter so we can make plan for the day after or I can use the outfiter's phone maybe. I mostly fish on la baie du nord & la baie du sud not far from Air Melançon and naturally I got my secret spot; if I can have access. The reservoir is free till sunday, just a few patches are remaining.Next saturday is Lake Champlain."
530937,Seanik,2003-05-13 18:51:00,218,"SkipjackDid you use leeches last year and where did you buy them? We bought ours in Maniwaki at a gas station on the way out of town. If I remember correctly they cost about 3.75 Ca. per dozen, does that price seem ok and can leeches be bought by the pound along the way to Senneterre? While at Berthelot last year we had a guide for a day and he showed us how to catch and use mullet as bait. We stopped at a shallow bay tipped 1/8 oz jigs with a small piece of night crawler and quickly would catch 2 or 3 mullets, fillet them and chunk to about dime size. Jigs tipped with mullet pieces were our best walleye bait with leeches being a close second. This was my first expierence with mullet,they kind of look like a white fish fron the side but the head is different also caught a lot of sauger another first."
530942,McQ,2003-05-14 08:23:00,615,"Just got off the phone after talking with Peekay - glad he was paying the long distance charges. Man-o-Man, now I know I'm suffering from cabin fever - half hour chatting about the fishing on the Gouin Reservoir and I'm supercharged almost like a sugar high, can't wait to get up there - those walleye are a-callin."
530938,skipjackoh,2003-05-16 11:35:00,42,"seanikmy pard and i rarely use live bait,mostly jigs with finess fish,a plastic bait,or spoons and blade baites.will use crawlers when all else fails.would like to try for sum of those bait fish u got tho.leaches just need alot of care,and were lazy.loloh well have a good tripskipjack"
530943,GR8WTHUNTER,2003-05-17 21:55:00,618,Follow the directions and you will pass through as quick and easily as we did. A big thanks again for the directions. Rich
530927,Guest,2003-05-12 07:55:00,0,"I printed out the directions you gave to GR8WTHUNDER on June 11, 2002, to get through Ottawa easily. Just wanted to double check to see if anything has changed...construction, whatever. We're headed north on June 7th , can't wait! Here were your directions:Go north on 416 till you reach 417.Go east on 417 to the Nicholas/Lees Avenue Exit, stay on Nicholas.Turn right off Nicholas onto Besserer.Go two blocks on Besserer east to King Edward.Turn left on King Edward, continue north toward Hull and stay on Rt.5 which will turn into 105, go north to Maniwaki.Thanks for the update!"
530928,Trophymuskie,2003-05-12 16:03:00,254,That still works fine. Once on Nicholas make sure to watch the sings to Quebec and you will do fine.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com
530929,retire55,2003-05-12 16:21:00,1029,"Baxter:The directions provided are still OK if you are heading for La Vérendrye Park or O'Sullivan. You didn't mention where you were heading or whether you were crossing at the Thousand Island bridge.Trophymuskie made some beneficial comments to the thread in Jun 02 about traffic patterns on the Queensway (417). During the week, morning rush period (6:30 to 9:00) going East to Nicholas (downtown) gets pretty heavy (stop and go).You can have a look at the road network around Ottawa and north to Maniwaki, Grand Remous and then La Vérendrye at:http://www.tourisme.gouv.qc.ca/angla...es/routes.htmlClick on the bottom left hand portion named Outaouais and you'll get another map entitled Nord-du-Quebec. Click anywhere in the Outaouais area to get a blown up map in pdf format. If you scroll down the vertical to the bottom and the scroll over to the right as far as possible, you'll be able to see how 416 connects to 417. Using the scrolling bars, you can see your road network north."
530930,Seanik,2003-05-12 17:33:00,218,"Retire 55We used your directions to get through Ottawa last August and they were excellent. Thanks again! We are going back to Berthelot Lake via Senneterre JUNE 13. This time 6 of us are traveling in a 31' motorhome, the trip through Ottawa could be a bit hairy during rush hour. This is the first time in many years for a June trip, usually its in August to escape the bugs. I hope to c&r that elusive (for me) 20+ Pike."
530931,retire55,2003-05-12 18:38:00,1029,"Seanik:I'm happy that I could provide help in some small way. Hopefully, your travel day will be bright and dry with the consequent less chance of fender benders. Like anywhere else, rush hour accidents can create instant grid lock. Good luck landing that big northern. Our group is back to Lake Kipawa 5-12 Jul for walleye and some lake trout."
530932,skipjack,2003-05-13 03:38:00,18,have used same directions last 5 years.they work well.will be leaving 6/6 for sennetere.will be fishing onlake parent.24 more days
530933,McQ,2003-05-13 04:15:00,615,Does anyone go up to the Gouin Reservoir? I'm curious as to who else enjoys this boundless fishery. It's about the same size as Lac Suel in NW Ontario and doesn't have a lot of road access so a bit more remote and makes for a great fly-in experience.
530934,nemio,2003-05-13 05:33:00,96,I will be on the Gouin from May 29th. till June the 02. Then again June 22-27Then again July 06-11Fishing going to be super this year because of the water low level; the fish will be regroup in the holes.If you attend one of those dates let me know and will try to get together.I'm actually starting to look at all my things to bring specially flour for shore lunch.
530935,Peekay,2003-05-13 06:40:00,7,"I'm going up to Oasis Gouin for the first time this year from June 23 - June 28.....have heard nothing but great things about the fishery there.....Nemio, either you must be doing some occassional guiding in that area or your have a much more understanding wife than I do!!!!Peekay"
530939,Guest,2003-05-13 08:46:00,0,Thanks to all for the update! I'll provide a fishing report on my return.
