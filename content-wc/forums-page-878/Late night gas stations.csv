We are driving on through this year. Not spending the bucks on a motel. Will be in Northern MN in the wee hours of the morning. Does anyone know about the availability of petrol on the U.S. side at 3 or 4 in the morning? Also, as we come up through Virginia and Orr, how late are those stations open?Thanks for the info.lt"
