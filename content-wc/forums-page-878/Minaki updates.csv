531101,Guest,2003-05-14 12:01:00,0,"Well, I'm off for the summer to God's country. Being forced to spend my summer in Minaki..... I can hear y'all sobbing for me. I'll be running the bait/tackle shop & guiding for the Minaki Lodge.SO, if yer out there please drop in & introduce yourself ! No need to purchase anything, just need to meet the faces ! I will have somewhat limited access to the net. What I plan to do is every wednesday I will be posting a report on Minaki, so that when you head up you will have a bit of a game plan ! HOWEVER when I put these posts up, on the bottom of the post I have to put the lodges web site address. I need to do this so I can keep my boss happy & maintain access to the net. (I'm using his puter) SO please don't flame me for advertising.....it's a small deal I had to make. Almost all of you that are heading up know all about Minaki, so in a sense it isn't ""real"" advertising. Have a safe trip up everybody !Good FishenRobp.s to the guys who e mailed me about guiding, I will be in touch as soon as I get a handle on what is happening !"
531102,Reels,2003-05-14 12:52:00,2876,"Thanks Rob,It would be nice to know the pattern before we get up there. We welcome the reports!You might want to think about posting here too. I know a lot of people check here to find out what is going on. Help justify the computer a bit more... ;-)http://www.justfishontario.com/We'll stop by and say hi June 6th or 7th... <{{}}><"
531103,Guest,2003-05-14 14:16:00,0,"Rob......I'm going to be up at the cabin from June 26th - July 2nd this year. If you go by Harbour stop in and say Hi. If possible could you also post water levels and temps? Also....just a little update on the smallmouth, I'm not asking for too much am I? Tell your boss to put a web cam up at the lodge. Good luck :)"

531105,iamwalleye1,2003-05-14 15:13:00,1589,ReelsYou could move the new office up there!Are you in KY this week?
531106,Reels,2003-05-14 15:16:00,2876,"I am having a hard enough time getting one open in IA, what makes you think Minaki is going to work! It would be cool though... just dont think I would get anything done...I was suppose to fly on a private plane today with Metal Tech, but weather hosed us and we were grounded, hence the posted between machine quotes...Here is a link on water levels guys.http://www.lwcb.ca/pdf/WinnipegRiver...2003.05.14.pdf<{{}}><"
531107,Vitreum,2003-05-14 15:52:00,221,"i hope you are gonna post your weekly report (not advertising) in the fishing report area. otherwise, buy an ad. also, while we're at it, is it true that you hired that virulently anti-usa college kid who posts on here under the name river-eye?"
531108,Reels,2003-05-14 17:16:00,2876,"I kinda hope he posts it here. The fishing reports are crowded, cover 95% of US waters, and most of the Minaki visiters/homeboys visit this page.You sound a little grumpy. You dont stay at Bayview do you? Have a beer and relax, life isn't that bad...If the post offends you, click to the next one. Im sure Scott and the mods are still capable of running this board without your help.<{{}}><"
531109,Guest,2003-05-14 20:50:00,0,"No matter how one looks at your posts, you are advert Minaki. I have no object, I wish you guys the best of luck. While your are at it, add your URL to my free links page athttp://www.kenoraontario.net Northern Ontario's Outdoor Network.Also, you can put your fishing reports on this site too. Just give me a call on that one too. FREE I too get reasonable hits, and I am a local site. I am in Kenora myself. Look me up if you have the time. I hide out at a resort on the Western Peninsula most of the summer. (ARC) I do not guide anymore.If you want a banner on my main site, e-mail me."
531110,Byron,2003-05-15 13:26:00,42,"Bayview! We are scheduled to do a four day Muskie trip in October, 6 through 10th.Your comment about Bayview now has me worried.
