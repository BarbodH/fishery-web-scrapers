Absolutely no problems. Roads are well marked.For the out-of-towners, once on Nicholas, first traffic light is Laurier. Second traffic light after Laurier is Besserer (turn right). Go 2 blocks and turn left on King Edward. And you're on your way (about 2 kilometers to the Quebec border - middle of the bridge over the Ottawa river)."
