531132,Sweg_1,2003-05-16 09:59:00,2,We've been fishing the Temiscaming area (Manawaki Trail) of Quebec for several years now. We do very well with the walleye and pike. My Question is are there small mouth in that area?? We've never cought one and I am wondering if there are any in that area of Quebec??
