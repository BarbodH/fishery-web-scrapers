530954,Guest,2003-05-12 19:07:00,0,"Going the first week of August, approx. the same time as last year. Jig and minnow almost the whole time. Caught lots of walleye, no real big ones. 24"" was the best last year. Did not fish much for pike but caught quite a few just on jig and minnow. Had a great time. Can't wait to go back. Go with a group of 23 guys. Stay at Pine Portage Lodge."

Catch a ton of walleyes and pike using a jig and salted fatheads and shiners although late in the year they won't touch the salted minnies. Also do really well trolling the shoreline in about 8-10 feet of water. Caught two 5 pounders on the same day and some real nice pike. Always go with Everson's, but you're right, the fishing is incredible."

The smallest jigs you can handle with minnows in the rocks in shallow water and your can't go wrong early in the year. Normally don't get big eye's but you will get alot of eye's 18 to 24 inches. Stay in water from 3 to 10 feet deep in areas where you find a small chop in the water to break the glare. Do not use wire leaders. Tie your jig right onto your mainline and retie your jig every couple of fish. Good luck and have a safe trip.:D"
