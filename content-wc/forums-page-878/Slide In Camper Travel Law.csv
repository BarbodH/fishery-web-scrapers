531097,Guest,2003-05-14 11:29:00,0,I am hoping some of you fisherman north of the border can educate me here. I am coming to Canada the 2nd week of June and have a large Slide in truck camper on my truck. Is it legal for passengersto ride in the camper while driving? We would have the sliding windows open in between the camper and cab. Is this allowed?I think its's fine in the states but don't know about north in the land of walleye. Help me out.
531098,Guest,2003-05-14 14:08:00,0,It is illegal in Ontario to travel with passengers in the camper. They are not belted in which is the law for one and the law also specifically says you cannot travel in a camper. It is however commonly done by many people. I would never put a passenger in my camper even if it was legal.
