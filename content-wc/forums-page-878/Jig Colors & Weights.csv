We will be returning again this year during the same time frame. My question is: If you could only use three colors for the jigs, day in and day out, what would be the 3 most versatile and proven colors? How about weight, 1/8 oz, 1/4 or 3/8? Am not interested in buying a bunch of unnecessary tackle and really want to narrow my focus. Thanks."

Colors....Char,Orange,White....also have had good luck with hot pink. Favorite combo....1/4, Char tipped with large minnow. I use the least amount of weight it takes to get to the bottom and feel the bottom and the bite. NO SLACK IN LINE"
531090,Guest,2003-05-14 12:55:00,0,"I think my favorite jig color is orange, thou any color will work as long as it is orange and add a chartruese twister. 1/4-3/8 oz. jigs are usefull."
531091,Guest,2003-05-14 13:59:00,0,"Orange, Pink, and Char is all you would need, 2 in. tails if any at all. I used 1/4 the first couple years up there but have been using 1/8 for a long time. It still gets to the bottom but you will not be fighting snags as much. Line Time Baby. Leaving in 8 days."
531094,Fishoil,2003-05-14 14:27:00,1277,"Chartruse green, black, white. In that order. 1/8 oz or 1/4 oz if the wind is blowing. White or chartruse green tails. It's tough to beat a 1/8 oz black jig with a white tail when the fish are shallow, you don't even need bait. Just hop the jig a little and be QUICK to set the hook. 39 hours, 35 minutes and I'm on my way (not that I'm keeping track or anything)LOL"
531092,Guest,2003-05-14 17:24:00,0,"what kind of line will you be using, and what pound test??"
531095,Guest,2003-05-15 10:24:00,0,Colors and weights are not near as important as jigging technique and being able to find fish. Make sure you have a good depth finder and a good map. Get plenty of help from the Lodge owner and other fisherman. The prettiest jig in the world wont catch fish if you are not on them. Always be in touch with that jig.....you must feel the fish before he feels you......keep a tight line.

531096,Guest,2003-05-18 12:03:00,0,I always use dark or dull colours in early spring when walleye are not always that deep. For the rest of the time I know I can rely on yellow single tailed Mr.Twister w/ 1/4 oz jig head. I prefer the unpainted heads. If they don't bite w/ slow jigging a slow steady retrieve will bring them (as well as anything else in the area) to the boat or shore.
