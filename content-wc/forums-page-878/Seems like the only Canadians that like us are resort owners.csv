530154,Guest,2003-04-26 18:29:00,0,"Dear People on this message board,I am a 21 year old who has been going up to Canada for 20 years. Since I have been going up there I have been treated with the highest respect by Canadians, and I have given the same respect back to them. People who are bashing both countries need to do some growing up, otherwise the younger generations might not get the amazing chance to experience what Canada is all about. When I have kids, I want to do what my parents have done, and what my grandparents have done, and what my great grandparents have done and that is to go to Canada, fish, enjoy the scenes and relax. I really hope the country bashers have any kids. If they do then I am sorry for them because they see and hear what their parents are saying about the opposite country and start to form the same opinions as their parents. I Love Canada and most of its people. Don't be the one to ruin the fun out of going to the great country of Canada. -Kodiak-Fishing is Life"
530155,Guest,2003-04-27 06:55:00,0,"Just out of curiousity, can you give us your definition of ""bashing""? From what I've learned in the past few years, the discussing or exposing of unpleasant or controversial facts is often termed bashing. The schools and colleges are doing a good job of turning out students that aren't allowed to discuss or even consider the idea that there are differences between the sexes, races, nationalities, etc. and that openly acknowledging these differences will get one labeled as a racist, sexist, ""basher"", etc. Hiding from reality won't make it go away.You had the misfortune of growing up knowing basically one president, Clinton, the most polarizing president in recent history. Every night on TV you heard one side claiming they were discussing the facts while the other side was crying ""bashing"".It seems that the only way to avoid being a ""basher"" is to not discuss anything other than fishing. But then there's the catch and release vs. the catch and consume crowd, the tourney fishermen vs. the amateurs, the Lunds vs. Rangers vs the Trackers, the bass vs. the walleye, etc. Any and all of these topics have evoked emotional discussions or ""bashing"" so maybe we should all heed the slogan for this website and ""shut up and fish"". Of course if we did that, this website might disappear, so it seems its our duty to keep ranting if only to keep this site alive and well."
530156,Stillwater,2003-04-27 13:35:00,87,"I don't really want to put this post back ttt. But, I have to say that I have been going to LOTW for the last 15 years and have stayed in 7 different resorts over that time and 3 of them (for a total of 9 visits) are owned by people who live in the Minneapolis/St.Paul area during the winter.So if I chose to ""Boycott Canada"" I would be punishing my fellow Minnesotans as much as Canadians for something that they don't have much say about, nor even agree with. I like Canada, I don't remember what the political situation was 15 years ago the first time I was invited to go but it didn't affect my vacation decision then, and it certainly won't now.Scott"

I have read tirades of yours on DWI, economic policies, and anything else you can complain about and blame on the USA. Some of your points are valid but, I really think you have some major issues you need to deal with. Stop blaming Americans for everything. I really do not think an invasion of Canada is in the forecast. We certainly do not want to make that idiot Michael Moore with his movie Canadian Bacon look like a prophet. Some of these posts lately are getting out of hand. Comparisons of the time it took to take over Iraq and how long it would take to overrun Canada are ludicrous. Canadian Guy you have an axe to grind with the USA and ALL Americans. I hope that someday America and, Americans can be as perfect as Canadian Guy expects. Until that day comes Canadian Guy will complain, sulk, and live in a world of bitterness and hatred. I really hope you get over it soon, it is going to eat you up inside. I apologize for some of the ignorant posts that fan the flames. I just think we need to remember who are friends are and, what we have done for each other. Here is to better days ahead for your's mine, and our's. Let's go fishing sometime and forget all this crap. I would even let rivereye in the boat so I can figure out what makes him tick. I think we better use big fish for the guide."
530157,jigman 2003,2003-05-01 09:36:00,981,"If you think Northern WI in the fall is going to compare to fishing Canada at any time, I think you are fooling yourself. Most of the lakes have a 1-3 fish limit due to Native spearing. Catching those 1-3 fish can be difficult at times, and when you do catch them they tend to run small. Good luck."
530158,IaCraig,2003-05-01 16:01:00,434,"I am tired of these US vs Canada threads too, but I can not resist adding my 2 cents. 1. Providing the Canada / US border is not closed, I plan to go to western Ontario at least once in 2003 just like I do most every other year. 2. From what I can tell the Prime Minister's opinions of the Iraqi War and Bush does accurately represent the majority of the Canadian people. As explained to me by my Canadian friends who relocated to Iowa for employment reasons ""Most the people of Canada live in the East and they favor gun control and are anti war and it was their combined votes that elect the government."" However, adding my own assumptions to that, ""most Canadians who read Walleye Central are fishermen & hunters and therefore are of slightly differing mindsets and opinions than the city dwellers who elected the government officials."" Therefore, complaining on this board is preaching to the choir. 3. Lastly, it is normal human reaction to get bent out of shape when someone makes a tactless negative comment about someone you respect. However it is childish strike out against them without thinking things through. Also, I feel that it is great that our northern neighbors have freedom of speach to say what they feel, and if the PM had made the comment about Clinton I probably would have snickered. IaCraig"

Oh and by the way, if most of the UN (which you guys have generally supported as we do)would have deemed the attacks justified and legal we would have supported you with our blood. Did you go over and fight? Or were you too busy cancelling fishing plans? We for the most part believe in our system of Gov't and support it. We also believe in the UN.

Ya you heard me I said ""OUR"" thats because Im A Canadian and have no respect for the useless Gov. we have. The UN is a joke. So that is no excuse for using that as a reason to not give what we can to help our ""Best Freinds and #1 Allies"". The UN says its does not support what they did. Thats because most of the UN is controled by four countries, we don't have to say their names. The other superpower asked for their help. They did not want to give it because they sell most of the stuff that those countries are using. They did not have to go through what the Americans did on 9/11. If they did they would not have asked for helpthey would have just took those *******s out. Now for us We lost people in the 9/11 attacks so we should be helping in this fight on those terroist. Now if the UN wants to be helpful they can start to us there power and take some of those problems out. We as Canadians can do what we can with are limited resourses by checking passports more and stop letting so many refuges in. If they can prove that they are Sane and can clear health checks then come on in, I have no problem with anybody but when you go to a new country you have to play by their rules. So its about time we made our rules stronger, or the only people welcome is Americans. Went this happens then maybe I can be a proud Canadian Too.

530143,Guest,2003-05-03 10:03:00,0,"Hey Bud Man:I am not going to go as far as saying I agree with ""Canadian Guy,"" but to me, your post exemplifies the problems many Canadians have towards American attitude. Let me ask you this: Who asked the US to become the leader of the free world and accept the responsibility that accompanies such a role? (as you so eloquently put it) The answer is nobody because there should not be such a role for one country. This is precisely why such a body as the United Nations was created!!! And we all saw what the US thinks of the UN, didn't we? I can't stress this enough. The US deliberately went against the decision of the body that was created specifically to deal with situations like that of Iraq. You are essentially saying ""this is our world and if you want to be a part of it you will learn to do things our way."" THAT IS NOT ""LEADERSHIP"", THAT IS CALLED BULLYING. Your government was adament to get into Iraq, regardless of how they justified doing so. They figured the weapon thing would work but when it backfired they simply said we are going anyway!! Once the march was on weapons took a back seat to this ""Iragi Freedom"" crap which the government used to attain the sentiment of the public. Funny how the only Iraq ministry not looted was the Ministry of Oil. Hmmm . . . now why would that be??? Don't you see? As a Canadian, the only thing I ask Americans is to OPEN YOUR EYES, because they clearly must be glued shut for many people right now. Who do you think sits at the top of all the big companies who are going to help ""rebuild Iraq?"" If you don't know the answer you are clearly blind. Canadian Guy calls you arrogant. In the Merriam-Webster dictionary, arrogant is defined as ""a feeling or an impression of superiority manifested in an overbearing manner."" At least in some regards, I think he has a valid comment.Keep your ""eyes"" open!!!"
530144,Guest,2003-05-03 12:50:00,0,"History has shown that there will always be a leader or small group of countries that will take the role of leader(s) in this world. When there is a vacuum of leadership, someone will step in. The US has once again stepped into this role after letting the UN fail so miserably at it over the past few years. All one has to do is look at who is on the UN committees for human rights and disarmament. Maybe the real goal behind going into Iraq is for the oil. This doesn't bother me and I wish they would just openly admit it. Oil is a lifeblood of all countries and having a vast supply of it in the hands of a bunch of Mideastern terrorists and dictators to me is reason enough to change regimes. Saudia Arabia should be next. Call it arrogance if you chose, but the fact remains that the US military provides the security for many of our detractors to remain free countries. You may or may not have noticed that South Korea was in the anti-US mood for a while until Rumsfeld mentioned that maybe we should re-deploy some of our forces from there to other bases around the world. Within hours, the South Korean president is backpeddling and there's been no mention of anti-US feelings from them since. America. The big bad bully everyone loves to hate until they need help.As President Bush said, the direction has changed. The US will not wait to be ambushed. We will strike first when we believe we are in danger. We sat around and went the UN route for too many years and now we have a large hole where the WTC once stood. I'm proud of Bush and support the pre-emptive strikes totally. As far as the US-Canada thing, I don't agree with Canada's lack of support but I consider that a political failure on the part of it's leaders, not of it's citizens. As to the real important things in life, the fishing trips will continue so you can look forward to at least one more arrogant American this June."

You have no inclination of how the general population of Canadians feel, nor do I believe you want to. But heres a hint, it doesn't reflect what the Gov't along with Chretien and his seals say.I like americans, but the reason why they labelled around the world sometimes as big mouthed, is because of people like who open their mouths before the brain is in gear. Most americans, are big hearted, not big mouthed.(notice I can distinquish the fact that one american doesn't speak for the rest,namely....you don't speak for them, why can't you do the same?)So please. Why don't you yourself, sit down, shutup, and think before you post, because to tell you the truth, with an attitude like your, we don't want you here, because all you do is give the rest of the good Americans a bad name.

530136,McQ,2003-04-24 15:00:00,615,"A little more muddying of the water going on here again.First and foremost Chretien is a Canadian, in fact the strongest proponent for a united Canada you could find. It's true that about 10% of the seats in the House Of Commons are separatists from Quebec but just last week a provincial liberal government was elected in Quebec under Jean Charest's leadership and he is the poster boy for a united Canada. You can expect the federal position regarding separation to disappear very soon - like just about and right around next years federal election.Personally I am a life long Conservative and have a hard time supporting Jean Chretien in any manner but this subject deserves the truth. There is just too much innuendo and out and out misunderstanding about Canada posted on this board.Take your issues with France out on France and recognize Canada as having it's ability and the right to have her own decisions made by Canadaians."

530142,Guest,2003-04-24 20:41:00,0,"I agree that the original poster has his priorities misplaced. Canada's citizens, in general, as opposed to some of its politicians have always been great hosts and guests. Staying in Wisconsin to fish will be his loss. But face it, if the US decided to rid Canada of its weapons of mass destruction, it would take only slightly longer than it took in Iraq. You might want to review some numbers: Canada armed forces - 25,000 +/-US armed forces - 2-3 million, not to mention the 100-150 million or so crazy, armed citizens running wild. Your dislike of Americans and the US is apparent in many of your replies. But the fact that the US has become the leader of the free world and has accepted the responsiblities that accompany this role is something that will irritate you for a long time. Call it arrogance if you want, but maybe you'd feel safer if France and Germany was on your southern border. The fact that the US is here allows Canada to spend more on social programs since you spend only about 10% per capita as much on defense as Americans. But you won't have to worry for a while, we still have Syria, North Korea, Libyia, and a few other minor distractions to keep us busy before we head north. I think Ontario would make a nice 51st state.BTW, I'll be coming to Canada in June for a week. As much as I disagree with your politicians, there's no sense in letting a few idiots get in the way of catching fish."
530138,Guest,2003-04-24 21:19:00,0,"Well said. While lakes are still ice covered for the most part in the Ignace area, the ice is mush.Water levels are VERY low but remember, the frost has just begun to lift and we have had next to no spring rains yet.Water levels will probably be lower than usual but a wet spring could blow that prediction right out of the water.Trout fishing is dynamite right now though. There is enough open water to cast from shore and it's been a long winter. Hungry fish make happy anglers!"

We also have a liberal party in power that uses a fairly lax immigration policy to ensure they have a steady stream of new party followers....by the way, on the morning of 9/11, what country was it that opened up their borders & their airports to ensure the skies over the U.S. were cleared of any further terrorist threats....2 weeks later, I attended a memorial in Ottawa for the victims of 9/11 where over 100,000 people tearfully stood in front of our Parliament Buildings in remembrance of those that died.If you & your buds have actually cancelled a long time annual trip based on what a couple of politicians have said or done, you haven't spent much time learning about Canada or getting to know any people of the country you are visiting.In the end, it's your loss & the loss of the lodge owners....Peekay"
530124,bigfish1965,2003-04-24 07:21:00,3210,"Well...let's first let you know the facts. Chretien did not shoot off his mouth. In fact he has said painfully little. The outcome was in no way altered by the lack of Canadian perticipation. On the sublect of Canadian participation; Canada had ships in the Gulf during the entire conflict escorting US warships. Several Canadian soldiers were embedded with US troops and saw action. Preserving Canada's role as a peacekeeper was enhanced by non-participating( even though we did more than 90% of the countries that did particpate) ensured a smoother re-building effort. ( i.e. Iraqi's will have not seen the Canadians as the invading /liberating force when they arrive and will be more able to keep order.) Non of the Ministers disrespected your President. The person that called W a moron was a press aide who was removed from her position. The MP that said she 'hates Americans' stands no chance of getting re-elected. This is a free country. People are free to shoot their mouths off at any time. You should hear what we say about our politicians. Occasionally insensitive, stupid people will say insensitive, stupid things. That's the price of free speech. You have to give it to everyone. I had hoped that the US understood these tenets of democracy. We don't believe that Jesse Jackson or Strum Thurmond speak for the whole country. They often say the dumbest things. So how about allowing people to be free and have free speech. It won't always be what you want to hear, but admire them for speaking their convictions. You went into Iraq to give the Iraqi's democracy. Yet when some Canadians use the priviledge of democracy, you want to cast them out and threaten boycotts. Democracy means having free will and free speach, not having to agree with the majority.

530127,Guest,2003-04-24 11:54:00,0,"Well put guys. I have been going to Canada for 35 years and have been in all provinces. The Canadian people have always been friendly and courteous. The Canadians have always stood by us in times of strife and I consider them as strong an ally as we have. All it takes is some loud mouthed, slack jawed, booger eating moron like master blaster or whatever he is to make Americans look bad. By the way master baster or who ever, I live in Wisconsin, and you are the people we can live without. Keep your moneyand go to Cuba to fish. I can usually keep my cool, so I have allowed myself to be lowered to his level, and for that I appologize to the others on WC. There, I feel better. God bless the USA and Canada."

Did he not say (about Bush) to the reporters outside the a Liberal caucus meeting ""The world expects someone who's the president of a superpower to be a statesman. I think he's let not only Americans, but the world, down by not being a statesman."" We, as Canadians, need to vote this left wing bunch of idiots out of government. With the exception of a few, they do NOT represent most of the people of western Canada. The Liberal gov't, as some may suggest, have not become right wing. Paul Martin will be no better - he's just another 'fence-sitter' like Chretien. They don't fund our military, they've just budgeted 100's of millions of dollars to bilingualism, and they let people like Dhaliwal insult our neighbour's leader with NO reprocussions. We need a change..."
530135,Guest,2003-04-24 13:51:00,0,"""The GAUL"" of the Canadian government?Yep, that is the problem. Chretien is definitely going to have gaul! Gual is in his veins and so too, for the rest of the seperatists. They want Canada to split in two and they can get their ""new Gaul"" back together with the ""old Gaul"".(France)Actually, I think you meant ""gall""..but, you hit it right on the head when you typed ""GAUL"".Don't lump all Canucks in with Chretien. He is acts French more than Canadian.I am a Yank and I sure would not have wanted Canadians to lump me in with Bill Clinton when he waqs our ""leader' (gag).So, don't do that to the Canadians, eh?"
