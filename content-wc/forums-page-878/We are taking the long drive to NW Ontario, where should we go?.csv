I haven't fished or stayed at Eagle Lake nor do have any association or interest in any fishing camps, lodges etc. What follows are just web sites for resorts that appeal to me:http://www.centurylodge.com/ (Osborne Bay, south end of Eagle Lake boat in)http://www.wenasaga.com (smaller lake near Lac Seul drive to)http://my.execpc.com/~womanlak/index.html (large lake near Red Lake)http://www.southshorelodge.com/ (northwest corner of Eagle, boat-in)http://www.eaglelakeisland.com/ (Eagle Lake boat in short distance)"
531063,Guest,2003-05-14 20:54:00,0,"Looking for a place in NW Ontario eh?Look into this site for a few ideas.Northern Ontario's Outdoor Networkhttp://www.kenoraontario.net it lists numerous resorts, fishing reports, has maps of LOTW, and much more."
531064,Guest,2003-05-14 23:19:00,0,"Or you can go with reputable guide with references from PWT pro's,Harvey Cochrane knows Rainy River in the mid and lower sections. He guides on your boat or his, would prefer his boat."
531065,Knutsy,2003-05-15 05:32:00,9,"If you want good to very good fishing, drive to camps are a good idea. If you want unbelievable fishing, do a fly-in. They are a bit pricey, but it is worth the money. One thing that I have done several times is stay a week at a drive to camp and choose a day during the week to go on a one day fly-in.It not as expensiveas a four day fly-in and you can check weather reports before you book your day trip. Nothing can ruin a remote fly-in more than foul weather. I stay at a camp on Perrault Lake and generally tuesday or wednesday go on a one day fly-in to another lake. The cost of the fly-in is about $115.00 per person. We drove 20 minutes to LacSeul at about 6:30 am. We were on a remote lake all by ourselves by 7:30 am. The walleye were biting on everything. We were picked up at about 5:30 pm and back at Perrault by 6:00pm."

531068,Guest,2003-05-17 10:32:00,0,"I following url is for a couple of resorts near Morson, Ontario. We seriously considered going there a few years back. I like the boat in feature and the wind protection because of the resort location. There are quite a few other nice resorts near Morson or acessable from Morson on Lake of the Woods. Some of the resorts feature a combo Duck Hunt an Crappie fishing adventure in the fall. Apparently lots of ducks and wild rice.http://www.morsonoutfitters.com/"
531052,Ohio fisherman,2003-05-13 11:37:00,989,"Well guys, after considering the replies on my post below where everyone says that the long drive is really worth it, my wife said that she wants to make the drive and experience this outstanding fishing. Now we are looking into where to go in NW Ontario. Here is what we are looking for. We will be taking our two labs so we prefer a lodge or camp that has a ""remote"" cabin so that nodoby is irritated by our dogs. They are great pals, but some people don't like other people's dogs. We prefer solitude too. We would like the cabin to have a shower facility. We can cook our own meals, or eat at the lodge. Nothing fancy; price must be reasonable. Fishing must be very good, afterall, that is why we are driving so far. We will be taking our own boat. I have heard that Lac Seul can be hard to fish because of the size of the lake and it can get very rough - maybe just to keep out newcomers. We are interested in any lake out that way.Thanks for all the help! O F"

531054,Guest,2003-05-13 11:55:00,0,"where from? Just South of Cleveland here. I will be leaving for Pakwash on June 14, but have fished Gullrock the past few years and have had great experiences. This past year was kinda slow, we were there the week that it rained all day every day. Still did OK considering. We stayed at Golden Hook Resort but this year we had to go a week later and couldn't get a cabin."

531056,Guest,2003-05-13 12:02:00,0,"Lac Suel without a doubt. Regarding the weather there are plenty of bays, etc. Regarding where to stay with the dogs I am not sure but keep plugging away on the Internet and you will find something."
531057,Guest,2003-05-13 13:42:00,0,"I think if you go to a boat in resort, American Plan or Housekeeping, you will find better fishing than stopping at a drive to at the shoreline. It is my belief that most people fish a few miles from the resort and shore based boats have to return to or near base before dark. If you are based out in the lake, you don't have to spend prime fishing time returning to base.As far as resort selection the issue is the size of the water, rocks and distance to your resort. I have traveled by car, train, boat and plane to resorts. I like them all. Boat in and rail in are cheaper than flyin. I've read of resorts on Rainy, LOTW, and Lac Seul and other Lakes as boat in resorts. I would love to fish at Chamberlain Narrows on Lac Seul but would be hesitant to take a boat unless it was large and I knew the water. I know there are many resorts only a few miles from shore that should offer good fishing. Check out LOTW arround Morson, Ontario. Also Rainy Lake has some upscale island resorts that may be of interest to you, your wife and dogs.The best fishing for me was at Cascade Camp on Rainy Lake, a basic no frills housekeeping fishing camp next to Devil's Cascade (waterfalls) caught smallmouths until our arms were sore. This is an older resort with mismatched furniture and appliances and questionable wiring. Flush toilets and hot running water work fine, lawn was mowed, clean fish house, nice resort operator and staff, daily rates.As the name implies Cascade Camp is next to a waterfall. (I always like to have waterfalls available for fishing.) The resort owner arranged pickup for us with a boat owner with a larger boat-$90 each way at that time. We took in everything we needed for five people and the five people and the boat driver and his friend. It was nice to have an experienced hand at the controls. Also the lake was calm both in and out. If there had been a strong wind, it would have been a bumpy ride. Mother nature always has an impact on the trip!!!"

531061,Ohio fisherman,2003-05-14 05:54:00,989,"Hi Guys:Thanks for the help and support. We think that Wife will be comfortable enough to enjoy the drive in our Expedition. She can ride in front or lay down and rest in the back seat. I will be sort of ""driving Miss Daisy"" all the way to NW Ontario! I checked out the link by Gary Ia - wow that outpost looks great. The 40 mile ride in sounds fun and exciting too. I will check out the other suggestions too.Thanks again, O F"
