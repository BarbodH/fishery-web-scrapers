The fire ban is still on but god disagrees. There is a big fire near us and we can see the huge pume of smoke. The smoke is actually blocking out some sunlight. Fishing is still very slow. My dad was in town tuesday, he talked to some other outfitters and they got the same issue. He ran into the local MNR officer and even he said that it is slow in this area. If you ever want an honest fishing report that isnt in my area call the local MNR office to your area. Just remember the fishermans fish is big and there tales are bigger. On the bright side the guys are marking tons of fish. The get about a 15 minute window which is around 8:30 that the fish bite. Minnows worms and leeches seem to be even on catching fish. The bass are really agressive. There was one bass that actually attacked our outpost guys. He would jump right on shore at them and flop back in the water. My dads comment was that it wasn't a smallmout it was an Asian bass, like the Asian carp they have in the Mississippi. The pike fishing has been good but nothing over 40 inches yet. Guys caught and released several fish in the high 30's. If your driving up 101 between Chapleau and Wawa you might want to call your camp to see if the road is open.Hopefully threre is a better fishing report next week."

1205804,nyfisher,2010-06-01 07:01:00,1,HiI'm heading to Lake Windemere this weekend - do you know if the roads are open and how the fishing has been in that area?
1205984,jaggersr,2010-06-01 15:35:00,44,My wife and I are headed up Saturday as well. I talked to a buddy that lives in the Soo today and he recommended going up 129 to Chapleau rather than 17 to Wawa. The fire is west of Windermere and everything I can find online says the road is open.
1206033,halfmoon007,2010-06-01 18:39:00,121,"Hi allWas at Borden lake just out side chapleau all week. Walleye fishing slow during the day time heat. Was in the 90 degree range. our only salvation was to fish small moulth during the day on the lumber strewn shore lines during the day. and fish walleye from 8pm till 2 am this was the only time the bite was on.the water was 65 degree,s at transducer when we arrived on 5/22 and 5 days later it was 75. could only find walleye,s in the 7 to 10 ft.water just outside the spawning sanctuary. never caught a eye depper than 10 ft.Ran the whole tackle box past them including crawlers and minnows. and the only thing that really worked was small silver and black rattle crank baites, ie short warts, Cordels etc troll at 5-6 ft.. run every color under the sun and silver and black was the key ? thing the rattles had something going because a a sil. and blk. rapala behind a bottom bouncer produced zip. silver and black rapalas thrown 1 ft. from shore for the small mouth still on beds. ? also check the net for wawa fire 18, it took the electric power out of all the chapleau area Thursday the 28th and I believe its still out as of 6/1Good luck ...halfmoon thanks for reports youngcandianguide"
1206120,Rich B,2010-06-01 21:53:00,1081,"NYFISHER, Be sure to post how you did up at Lake Windermere......I went there a few years ago several times and loved the lake, though didn't catch many walleyes of larger size. You're probably headed to ""Happy Day Lodge......tell Bob and Sondra I said ""hi"".....good folks and they have 2 nice sons.....very clean camp and well run with nice guests. Get yourself a GPS (if you don't have one for the boat - even a handheld unit so you can leave a track to return to camp) as it takes a few days or so to start to learn the lake. Check out the falls.....we caught a few decent walleyes by the falls, though did just as well or better on the shorelines in that same bay. If you're looking for bigger fish, go down by their outpost camp....it's a little bit of a run, but less pressured fish......lastly, watch your graph as you leave camp in that little bay, as the bay is loaded with large fish but they're deep....no one I saw was able to catch them (they may be whitefish ?). Good luck next week....let us know how you did. Rich B"

1207559,michigan fish magnet,2010-06-06 15:19:00,14,"Fished lake Windemere last week. Caught a few walleye, bass , and pike. Walleye fishing was good in the evenings after 8 pm and in very shallow water. Water temperature was 72 degrees in the back shallow bays where we had our best luck."
