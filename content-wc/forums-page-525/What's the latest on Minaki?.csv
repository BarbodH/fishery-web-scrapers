1221090,Aaron-IN,2010-07-20 20:14:00,500,The crank bite is on.
1221094,Bigiver,2010-07-20 20:30:00,94,"Aaron, I'm guessing, same time same place. Last year all white or blue chrome #9 shads were the ticket for us on the crank bite. Any new hot baits emerging this year. I really do appriciate all the info you give us. Are you up there now or is your dad filling you in? When you go up where do you buy leeches? Where do you buy them when your already up? I'll hang up and listen. Thank you some more, Bigiver"
1221337,Aaron-IN,2010-07-21 17:20:00,500,"My father is up there all summer so he fills me in. #9s in the shad or yellow/green work well. I've never bought a leech or minnow in 30 years of fishing up there so I can't help you there. Good luck, post a report when you get back."
1221400,Bigiver,2010-07-21 22:12:00,94,Thanks Aaron will post an update when we return.
