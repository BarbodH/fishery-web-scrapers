1221341,camp chef,2010-07-21 17:41:00,915,We call ahead to the bakery next to the grocery store in Nestor Falls.They have fresh bread anykind you want
1221354,GNO,2010-07-21 18:27:00,153,The big newer grocery store in Emo has a good selection of everything you want. I would say they are the next best to going to Safeway. Alot better option than Rainy River.
1221373,rpieske,2010-07-21 20:25:00,1276,"It's called the Cloverleaf. It is a very nice store with a bakery inside and its pricing is better than in Nestor Falls. Better selection, too. You will find it on the right side of the road as you head West through town. Karen's Bakery in Nestor Falls has fresh bakery goods like bread, buns, rolls, pasteries, etc. Plus she offers a good breakfast and lunch."

1221579,Tomv,2010-07-22 15:13:00,21,"Bill: There is a good grocery store in Rainy River, if coming through Baudette. At The Falls, Safeway in Fort Frances...or the grocery store in Emo...all good options. Tom"
