1220339,Kevin R,2010-07-18 15:37:00,305,I have be using flro over 10 years it is stiffer but still can be cut easy by Pike. Steel is better against cut offs. The super braid lines are about as good as steel for cut offs but not flro.
1220364,octanehi5,2010-07-18 16:42:00,1104,"I use braided line with a steel leader fishing for big pike, don't want to have a bite off of a monster pike,yes they can bite off 60lbs test braid. I fish the opposite for wally braided line to a 3'leader of vanish 8lbs .you would be amazed at how sensitive that line is"
1218995,stevensinks,2010-07-14 09:35:00,330,I see alot about using flro for leaders. I know that flro is low vis but what I dont know is it as good as steel leaders when fishing for pike. If so what lb. of line should be used so you dont get cut off?
1219000,DanM57,2010-07-14 09:49:00,135,I use 30 - 50Lb saltwater fluorocarbon leaders for pike. Never had a problem.
1219005,PIKEMAN330,2010-07-14 09:58:00,101,Florocarbon leaders are all we have used for about 5 yrs. now. We have not had one single failure.We also use them for musky.We use mostly 80 lb. test.Twelve inch for casting and thirty-six for trooling.I have at least fifty steel leaders that I don't use anymore.I make my own.
1219010,wallydave,2010-07-14 10:23:00,2151,"In a previous post walleye wranglers have used the leaders to deal with jigs getting snagged. The way I read it you could break off the leader, easier and lose less line. I will try this tip next year and see if it works. It is good to hear how this rig can be adapted for pike and muskie!"
1219024,jsmyers,2010-07-14 10:54:00,198,"I've never used florocarbon, how does it compare to a similar diameter of spectra braid or fused line in terms of abrasion resistance?In other words, If I'm fishing for walleye, but know I have a good chance of getting pike, would using a floro leader help or hurt my chances of landing pike?"
1219028,Moondog,2010-07-14 11:01:00,362,We use flouro 8# Seaguar when dragging Lindy rigs and unless that pike is caught in the mouth it will break. When jigging we use 8# Power Pro exclusively and if we hook a pike we generally land it. Rethinking making my leaders out of Power Pro next year. Never use steal leaders for pike anymore. Have my pike reel spooled with 50# Power Pro.
1219154,fisher_i_am,2010-07-14 16:36:00,498,I too am interested in flouro leaders. Can you guys give me suggestions on tools and components to make them.
1219271,rpieske,2010-07-15 06:14:00,1276,"Here is the best primer on making your own flourocarbon leaders, including equipment needed. I use them exclusively in both fresh and salt water fishing. I have never had a failure of crimp or leader material.http://www.leadertec.com/tipsandtech...echniques.html"
1219286,stevensinks,2010-07-15 07:01:00,330,OK Thanks for the info.
1219328,Golden Eagle,2010-07-15 09:08:00,2642,I sure like double barrel sleeves. You can match the inside diameter of the sleeves with the outside diameter of the line. Best to buy a line that matches your sleeves.
