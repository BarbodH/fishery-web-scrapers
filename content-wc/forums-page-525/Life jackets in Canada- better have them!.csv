While we were there the owner told us that we had better have our life jackets with us in case the MNR guys check you. He said the week before we arrived, 2 anglers got caught and did not have them with them. Each was fined $365!!! That sure would buy alot of gas!"
1215496,wallydave,2010-07-02 14:48:00,2151,"A good friend of mine has retired from trip to LOTW, after 17 years because the last couple of years the hassles had become more intrusive. My boat buddy and I alway wear our PFD's or at leats have them on the back of the seat, or if we are vertical jigging we use them for seat pads. Now that we take his sons along, we make sure we wear em. Thanks for the word to the wise!"
1215503,Aaron-IN,2010-07-02 15:33:00,500,Guess I should dig mine out of the front storage compartment and at least put them on the floor.
1215569,Pat,2010-07-02 22:33:00,203,"Always have life jackets in your boat for every passenger, it's the law virtually everywhere. Never take them out of the boat (them you can't forget them!) and make sure they are in good condition. If you ever need them you want them to work!"
1215584,81Saluki,2010-07-03 05:18:00,97,"I suggest keeping a PFD in the boat for each seat. I learned that the hard way. Normally we have 3 people in the boat and kept 3 life vests in the storage compartment. Several years ago I took a friend up the lake and her 2 friends out fishing and we were stopped by the MNR. Needless to say, I was 1 PFD short. We now carry 5 at all times."
1220995,stardaddyed,2010-07-20 14:52:00,20,Is the rule in the boat and accessible or on?
1221010,Bigfishhunter,2010-07-20 16:04:00,803,I am pretty sure they just need to be in the boat. Having them easily accessible is strongly encouraged. I leave mine clipped on to the back of the boat seat.
1221025,polaris-pete,2010-07-20 16:44:00,343,"They have to be readily available, in no contained or closed compartments or containers in the boat, jthe same rules as in the States probably. I have an inflatable Stearns waistpack PFD and you never know its on as its lightweight and small."
