It holds a lot of large walleye, however it is not your conventional walleye lake. Slip bobbering over rock reeks, similar to what folks do at Lake Saganaga on the Gunflint trail is the ticket for sumo walleyes. It is a drive to get into with a long gravel road that most likley will leave your vehicle and boat covered in a slime that can oly be removed by hadn washing. That is what has kept me from going there now with a new boat, etc....it is a mess to clean up. You absolutly must have a cover on your boat!Otherwise a great lake to go camp on and walleyes and large smallie abound on shorline structure year round."

Boci Ball at 4:00 AM by ladies in spandex hooting/hollering. A stool fell of the toilet facilities and in genral was a mess. Water was low, resort made $$$ pulling rigs from the soft sand. We did get lots of small mouth and a meager # of eyes. On the other hand, friends fished near the Sagana entry and did fairly well altho no size. I have one friend who has gone there for years and swears by it (uses a canoe and works close to shore) This was only one trip. We left 2 days early cuz of the party folks keeping us up all night."
