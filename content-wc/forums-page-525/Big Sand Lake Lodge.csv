1216624,jWN,2010-07-06 21:38:00,62,Just back from a week at an outpost camp of there's and I must say that is the most remote I have ever been. The outpost had 4 cabins 2 sleepers a cook house and a shower house all were in fine working order. My wife and I were the only2 on Jordan Lake which isn't a small lake in my experiance but not to large eaither about 4 miles long 2 wide. The fishing was good if I would have done a little more asking guides good starting points on the lake rather then rushing to get in line to fly out it could of saved alot of time in the serching for fish. Don't get me wrong though I cought fish evrywhere I tried it just took about a day or so to find the one after another that I was looking for.The average size was between 3 and 4 lbs we did catch a few that went 5lbs. In the 5 days we had around 250 walleye that was only fishing 6 hours or so a day would have been diffrent with my dad and friends we would have really cleand house on them but the wife only wanted so much and I was fine with that. We only cought a couple pike that I enjoy catching 2 about 32 inches and 1 36 incher but we never fished for them cought them walleye fishing alonong with many smaller talke buting size pike. All in all great trip great accomadations. The main lodge was amazingly built expecialy since we were over 100 miles north or more then any road I know of.
