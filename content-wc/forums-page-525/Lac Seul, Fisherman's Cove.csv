Fished Big Sand Banks for about 3 hours, caught several on gold spinner/minnow and rapalas'. Caught several nice (23""-27"") in the South Inlet, near the waterfall, but not at the waterfall. Broad was its usual great fishing, biggest was 23"". Biggest Northern was 40"". Narrows was good. Water was down about as foot, didnt seem to effect the fishing. No luck at Otter Lake, Dear Island or Little Sand Banks. Weather was hot. One storm blew in on one afternoon. Saw 11 moose 2 bears. 502 was just getting torn up as we were coming out. No problems at the border, either side."

Used crank baits and spinner rigs with minnows. Most walleyes were caught in 12-18 fow. Last day found them in 18 - 30 fow. Weather was challenging on the last 2 days with high winds so wasn't able to really get out of scout lake area. Water temps ranged from 68 - 72 degrees. Go to spots were the 2 islands east of Moose island, reef behind 1st island east of moose island, Reef south of Shanty Narrows and island on right when you leave swamp heading to scout lake/bay of islands. Enjoy the trip... Beats being back at work!"
