Lots of sizzle hot, some cool, thunder, rain, and strong winds, but the fish cooperated most of the time. Best numbers day for one boat was 68 walleyes in 3 hours, followed several days later by 62 in about the same time. We seemed to get the numbers in the weeds, 5 - 12 foot deep, and the larger ones in 15 - 20 deep. Most fish caught were over 18"", had to be selective for choosing eaters/take-homes. Largest walleye was a bit smaller this year, 26"", but we got lots 20-25. Gulp minnow, 3"" on a jig, 1/8 - 5/16 oz worked best. Our goal was to not eat/keep the nicer ones, so we didn't use the 4"" much. Probably would have gotten more bigger ones if we had. The 3"" really get torn up fast; the 4"" are much sturdier, used a lot of Super Glue to hold them together/on the jig. Water surface temp was 71-73*. Water looked to be down only about a foot. no trout this year, didn't fish for them. The guys in the next cabin used down riggers and easily limited out + eaters. An almost complete absence of mosquitoes made being outside enjoyable, even when close to the woods. One guy in camp (not our cabin) got fined by the game warden, I believe it was either $250 or $215, for beer out in the boat. As usual, Bob and Shelly were great hosts, and contributed to our enjoyment of our stay. Crossing the border on the way back at Pigeon River, after the usual, short questions, the official on duty also made us feel special, as he grinned ""Welcome back, guys"" to both vehicles, as he passed us through. Back again, next year, for sure, taking less tackle, more Gulp. Bill Krejca"
1220913,Curryale,2010-07-20 09:53:00,50,Great report.We were out on O'Sullivan the week before (July 3 - 10) and it was our third year with Bill and Shelly. As far as the fishing goes we had almost the exact same story. Smaller fish in the weeds and bigger fish out in deeper water. It seemed to us by the end of the week that more of the fish were transitioning into their summer pattern between 18 and 25 feet.We used the same baits except the 4 inch Gulps all week on 1/2 - 3/4 ounce heads (in 20 or deeper). When the lake was calm and we couldnt find them jigging we went to crawlers and harnesses. Caught fewer fish then we had in the past but our size was improved this year and we got two large Walleye (28.5 and 31). The one thing about O'Sullivan Lake that makes it different then most of the lakes in Northeastern or Northwestern Ontario is the size of the Walleye. It is hard to catch them under 18 inches a lot of the time. We will be going back.
1220974,Putzer5,2010-07-20 14:00:00,11,Thanks for the reports!We are leaving for OS(s) on Friday. Sounds like everybody is having a pretty good year. We have never been disappointed. We always start in the weed beds and work deeper off of points. Sounds like the pattern hasn't changed. I will report back when I return. Enjoy the rest of the summer!
1221098,Erie Ranger620,2010-07-20 20:58:00,74,Great report Bill glad you did so well OS is all that it is cracked up to be. Already missing the place. Putzer5 I hope your trip is relaxing and full of those wonderful marble Eyes. Is it my imagination or are these fish the toughest fighting Eyes I have ever come across?
1221186,Bill Krejca,2010-07-21 07:29:00,6107,"Yeah, Darryl, I have made the same comment myself re: hard fighting. I don't know what it is, but a 2 pounder feels like a 5 or more. They just stay down for longer than what I am used to. Must be something in the water. Bill Krejca"
