1211189,150max,2010-06-18 05:38:00,8,"I live on Butterfly Lake and the water is coming up .I have a 18"" with a 150 Merc so I take it easy going through the creek water is only 4 to 5 feet. WE just had our Sioux Lookout walley master tourament june 12&13 with 57 boats,half the boats fished the west end of Minnitaki and pickle arm,there were a lot of big fish caugth and good eaters.Friends who stayed with me used nothing but leaches and bottum wakers and did real good,I used minnows and caugth a lot of fish 10"" right down to 38 feet."
1211525,RyanG,2010-06-19 08:19:00,16,"Good info, I have never fished West of the big flat. Any suggestions on the better GPS chip? Navionics or Lake Master?"
1211868,sammax11,2010-06-20 17:32:00,6,"RSH8, my sons and I are coming up to Timber Ridge Resort the 3rd of July,would sure like to here how things went for your group. Thanks"
1214497,Guest,2010-06-29 11:14:00,0,"Dear Folks, Just got back, had a side trip to Colorado. Basically fishing was great on Friday and Sat 19 and 20 June, caught them in many places trolling cranks. Then it got bright and sunny without much cloud cover, light winds, and the wind direction changed from day to day. Fishing then got erratic, great in one spot in the morning, no fish there in the evening. We had the most luck trolling spinners and bottom bouncers on humps in the main lake and narrows between islands or between an island and the mainland. Also did well in weed beds, got a 39 and 41 inch northern and a number of eater walleyes with a small jig and minnow there. English River was mediocre, just barely enough water to go up by the rapids, then mostly very small fish and many fewer than in past years. Still got plenty of walleyes, but we did find ourselves keeping smaller ones than last year, when the fishin was fabulous. All in all the fish & lake acted as if we were there in mid-July, rather than mid-June."
1214544,WalleyeRip,2010-06-29 14:30:00,44,"Spent 10 days on Minnataki this month. Excellent fishing as expected. You need to learn the lake. If you do, you will always catch great walleye since the weather is different every year. Its make you a better fisherman. Starting going up in 1991. Not happy to see a tournament. Way too much pressure."
1214560,IaDave,2010-06-29 15:27:00,476,How was the water level of the creek/river between Butterfly and Lyons Bay?
1214807,Guest,2010-06-30 08:24:00,0,"The shallowest was about 2.0 ft. If we used the outside, more circuitous channels, we could get thru while bumping bottom gently only once or twice. We have a 16.5 Mirrocraft with a 50 hp Merc. We would stay up on plane but go thru slowly. My buddy in one of the boats from Timber Edge could zoom thru at full speed. Not a big problem, have got thru when the water level was quite a bit lower, slowed us down by maybe 5 min per run thru. One cool thing was that a loon had built a nest just off the edge of the channel and was sitting on it. Could cruise thru there and get within about 5 ft that way. There were loon chicks there the last day."
1214919,WalleyeRip,2010-06-30 14:42:00,44,"Anyone ever come across a really good frameable map of the entire Minnitaki?Also, anyone recommend a really good paper map?"
1215183,rockape,2010-07-01 11:15:00,215,Get the hydrographic map at Al's in Sioux Lookout. That thing is awesome. I think he might also have the big green and blue (land and water) map you can frame that shows the entire lake. I think he will mail the stuff to you if you call and ask.
1219791,JeffHo,2010-07-16 13:12:00,3,Any updates? I'm heading up to Pickerel Arm Camp in a few weeks and I'm jonesing for the latest action.
1207570,RyanG,2010-06-06 16:04:00,16,"We are plannig on annual trip to Minnitaki and curious if there are any recent reports.Thanks,Ryan"
1207969,prov1900,2010-06-07 20:46:00,544,"Just got back Saturday night. Fishing was really, really good. All depths. Minnows/plastics worked great. Water temps were warm from our experience, i.e. 60's and up. If it were me, I would think hard about crawlers/spinners. It was warm enough that we had to work at keeping the minnows alive. Of course, a bad pump in the rear baitwell might have had something to do with that. PM if you want/need more info, but I don't think you will have any troubles. Caught my biggest walleye and biggest pike of my life on our trip, so obviously we had some outstanding fishing."
1208411,RyanG,2010-06-09 05:51:00,16,"I will be heading up there in a few weeks and looking to get into some bigger pike in addition to the walleye.Thanks for the info,Ryan"
1210297,Guest,2010-06-15 10:22:00,0,We are heading up on Thurs 17 June. Staying at Timber Edge Camp on Butterfly. Any reports? Will post one on how we do when we return. I guess it has been raining a lot.
1210494,RyanG,2010-06-15 21:33:00,16,"Good luck, let us know how you do. We are staying at Donnelly's for the first time so we are interested in that side of the lake."
1210680,Guest,2010-06-16 12:00:00,0,"Have never been to Donnelly's, but I feel they owe us a beer. Have taken three boats who were lost back to the entrance to Pickeral Arm in the last two years. One boat had no map at all, the other just had the little map from a brochure."
1210716,IaDave,2010-06-16 13:16:00,476,"Have you heard anything about the water level in Butterfly Lake? I'm not going until Sept to TEC but I hope the water is high-helps getting thru the river into Lyons Bay quicker. I love going to Timber Edge then because only people in camp are bear hunters and sometimes Kevin & Diane's relatives. My 3rd trip this year, nice camp for the money."
1210750,Tony Shirley,2010-06-16 14:35:00,211,Fished a tournament ther last weekend Fishing was outstanding
1210756,Guest,2010-06-16 14:39:00,0,"Have not heard about the water level directly, just that it has rained a lot recently, hope this means there is lots of water there. I agree that having high water makes the trip more desirable. In our 8 years we have had such problems getting thru the channel twice. Will let you know when I get back."
1211167,RyanG,2010-06-17 22:46:00,16,Good luck thanks for the posts.
