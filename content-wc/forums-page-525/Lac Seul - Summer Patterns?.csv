1220848,tv4fish,2010-07-20 07:04:00,2694,"My opinion - definitely give the Gulp minnows AND leeches a try! I have ""experimented"" with both and when the fish are biting - both work well. If the fish are in a finicky mood, however, the REAL thing works better."
1216575,Warrior56215,2010-07-06 19:05:00,46,"Looking for predictions on summer patterns (25 + deep, mid lake, tight schools, etc.). Last year we were there in mid July and the fish were still pretty scattered. I will be on the east side (Deception Bay) July 28 and I would think they should be on their typical summer haunts by then. Wondering what people think?"
1217231,BenBeattie,2010-07-08 12:18:00,232,"The walleye have been deep for a couple weeks now. Although the hot, calm weather we had recently resulted in some excellent fishing in 10-14' along weed edges. But for the most part, expect to be fishing 25-35' by late July. Mid lake humps and points/shorelines with a quick drop off's etc. Where are you staying? Good luck and have fun."
1217255,tv4fish,2010-07-08 13:19:00,2694,"Hey Warrior: If you're going to launch at Deception Bay - Just fish off the dock right there. When we came in off the water once last week - an elderly man and 2 young people were fishing right from the dock -- One of the young people caught a 16 1/2"" walleye right as we docked the boat !!!"
1217368,fishman10,2010-07-08 19:40:00,226,we were using spinner rigs with crawlers in 18-25 feet and slayed them. we also used 3-8 jigs and leeches in bright colors. keep your hooks sharp and have fun.
1217471,Warrior56215,2010-07-09 07:34:00,46,"Thanks for the info. I am getting primed for the trip. One more question, for that last weekend in July what is your go-to bait? Crawlers, minnows or leeches?"
1218535,Bandit,2010-07-13 07:15:00,140,Just back from Deception Landing. Fished just off bolder piles in 24 - 30 feet of water. Leeches work great ( Fished was full off little 1 inch minnows )
1219893,Warrior56215,2010-07-16 18:50:00,46,Were you jigging with the leeches or rigging them?
1220141,Bandit,2010-07-17 19:29:00,140,Slow Jigging presenation 1/8 any colour. Move around fast until we mark fish ( Mark fish you Catch them )
1220539,Warrior56215,2010-07-19 07:34:00,46,"Thanks Bandit. I will definately have leeches. Also, I have a tub of gulp leeches that I have never used, do you think they would be worth a try?"
1220790,Bandit,2010-07-19 21:13:00,140,"You can give them a try, I know the gulp minnows work real well."
