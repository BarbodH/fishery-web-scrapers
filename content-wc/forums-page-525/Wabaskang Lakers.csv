1214496,jsmyers,2010-06-29 11:12:00,198,"Can anybody shed some light on the transition between the spring and summer laker patterns in lakes like Wabaskang?I understand that for a short while after ice-out, lake trout can be found cruising the shallows right next to walleye and pike. Then in the summer, they head deep, which in Wabaskang, is really only a handful of small areas. The key of course is water temperature. I've read that lakers prefer 53 degrees F. Once the shallows are above 60 degrees, there gone.But it can't be that simple. The water isn't 50 degrees one day and 65 the next; and even when it is 65 on the surface, it doesn't mean that 20 feet down is as warm on June 7 as it will be on August 7.It appears as if one of the reasons that lake trout are catchable in the summer on Wabaskang is that active fish are relatively concentrated, while it might be said that in the early spring they are catchable because all of the fish are active.I'm planning a trip for next year, and I'd like to catch some lake trout. It is looking like the 1st or 2nd week of June might be a good time for us. Walleye's should be pretty shallow, big pike will be active, and we won't have to wrestle for space with the hardcore walleye hunters during the 'eye opener. (If ice out is late, we won't have to worry about that either.)I had thought that lake trout would be easier to get early. Now I've got a theory that maybe I'm wrong. If the trout ""go deep"" by the time we are there, but that ""deep"" means areas over 25 feet, then there is a lot of potential places to find trout. The whole plan of jigging or trolling in Aerobus Bay is likely to be a bust, since the fish have a free run of about half of the lake. If that is the case, then perhaps laker fishing might be easier in mid summer?Can anybody shed any light on the transition from the springtime pattern of lakers shallow to the summer pattern of lakers near 50 feet? Having some better information will help us plan the week we want to come up...thanks."
1214531,Guest,2010-06-29 14:00:00,0,"My experience is that as trout go deeper, they also move into their summer deep water areas. In other words, even though they may only be at 25', I don't fish for them in 25' deep water, I fish in the deep water areas that hold trout all summer. I assume they are following the ciscoe. My other comment would be that I don't think you can pick a week a year from now and assume the trout might be at a particular depth. Think of the difference just between last year and this in terms of ice out, water temps, etc."
1214547,jsmyers,2010-06-29 14:41:00,198,"Thanks Mohleye-unlogged,That is helpful and encouraging. Just curious if you fish Wabaskang or if you are responding with general trout knowledge. It doesn't seem like many people target lakers in Wabaskang.I realized that you can't plan that far ahead. That is one of the reasons that I was making sure that I wasn't planning my trip for a potential lake trout black hole.I still have to hear back from a few in our party, but it looks like the 1st or 2nd week in June will be a good time. If it is a warm spring and/or an early ice-out, trout won't still be shallow in Wabaskang. But if it is a late and/or cold spring, they might be."
1214631,JayM5209,2010-06-29 18:24:00,1050,"JSM, I haven't fished for lakers in Wabbie, but every year for more than 30 yrs. I've fished for trout on Cliff and Aerobus. I'm always there the 1st or 2nd week of the season (this year the 3rd) and get lakers by trolling shallow....25' of water at the most. We'll sometimes pick one up suspened over deeper water as we move from one area to another, or cut across between two points or other structure. The shallow to deep transition is not a one day event, as Mohleye has noted. It happens in response to warming water temps and may occur over a week or two. This year, with the early ice out and warmer temps, we almost missed the shallow water action. On Cliff, May 29 or 30th, I got two in the first 30 minutes of trolling. Then our two boats did not get another laker all day. The next day two from our group went back to Aerobus and caught 10 or 12 lakers, including three caught by jigging large blade baits.If you're taking your own boats to Wabbie and really want to get lakers, it would be worth the short trip down 105 to Cliff Lake for a day. Or, go back Aerobus Road to Aerobus Lake. Our experience is that we catch more trout, and later in the early season shallow water, on Aerobus, but the Cliff Lake trout generally run a little larger.If you're there after waters warm enough for the trout to be in their deep water summer haunts, you can find them with your electronics. Some will be right on the bottom in 70' to 90' of water. Others will suspend 40' to 70' down over deeper water. The two ways to get these fish are generally with lots of lead on 3 way rigs or jigging. My usual jigging tools are heavy spoons (silver or silver with blue) or 1 oz. or 2 oz. jigs (white) with a white or pearl tube or 5"" twister tail. Some folks use 1.5 oz. or 2 oz. bucktail jigs in blue/white. A strip of sucker belly on the jig can really help.Good luck!"
1214659,jsmyers,2010-06-29 19:42:00,198,"Thanks for the tips Jay. I assume that when you say 3rd week of the season, you mean the 3rd week after ice out, not the 3rd week after the walleye opening day. We might try that; if not next year, then in a subsequent trip.I actually fished Aerobus once. I think it was the last year we went up there (c. 1995). One day my cousin and a couple of people head down the road, put in a boat, and ended up catching a handful of bigger pike (30-35""). The next day some of us went again, but couldn't replicate the success. We saw at least one monster pike, and I had a decent (~28"") fish get off near the boat. We had trolled along the following the shore to the left of the launch. All the the fish activity was pretty much in one spot, all of a sudden, after nothing for a while. If I remember hearing right, the day before, they caught all of the fish in the same spot too.I don't remember how we got hold of a boat, but I think it was a little 12' thing (one has been in the family, so it might have made the trip up--then again, maybe Raymond rented one to us). If I remember right, we had 3 or 4 in that little boat, and 2 in a canoe we towed. It ended up being to much of an adventure, because we had the boat overloaded, and we didn't stay for way to long.I think one of the rationales for taking a little boat was fear that they couldn't get a bigger one through the boat ramp. Is the Aerobus ramp a pretty good one now?I was also thinking that maybe it would be possible to take a canoe up Aerobus creek and portage over the falls, but I'd probably only give it a go when the weather is very warm, because I'd assume that you'd have to wade at some point next to the boat. Anybody know if that would be possible? Unfortunately, in order to do it when the water is warm enough to wade it would probably preclude much trout fishing on the other side, but it would be a way to explore."
1215105,Peffley'sCamp,2010-07-01 08:17:00,37,"Yea, I guess some people really do, especially if they are in reasonbable health and aren't afraid of a little work. With the right equipment even the second portage isn't that tough."
1215200,jsmyers,2010-07-01 12:09:00,198,"If all that mattered was catching fish, we'd all be better off staying south somewhere. There are more and bigger fish in many parts of the great lakes and some of the better fisheries around them, where the growing season is longer.We go to Canada for something more. It is wild; it's an adventure.Trying new lakes and making portages is a big part of that for many people. Most years I went to Wabaskang, we made the portage over Hobson/Williams falls at least once (unless it was too windy to get our boats across the Big Lake). Because we weren't as knowledgeable about where to go on the other side, we often caught fewer fish, but it was still a worthwhile trip.It is also the reason people like me try so hard to catch a lake trout out of a lake that isn't great for lakers, during a season that is even worse."
1215307,ILScott,2010-07-01 19:45:00,139,"Peffley's Camp,I have never fished wabaskang so I don't know how the fishing is. We have talked about going up one day but the Wine Lake system has 4 boat in little lakes and 3 portage lakes. I did do a portage up to a trout lake while in camp. Fished Beaver only one evening this time and just for northern. No disrespect to Wabaskang just curious.Scott"
1215368,Peffley'sCamp,2010-07-02 04:26:00,37,"Scott,No problem, just want to set the record straight as to why most of our guests do the portage.Couple of questions for you. Did you portage into Anishinabi for lake trout? If so, why? Wine Lake has a good fishable population of lakers. If you did portage into Anishinabi, did you do any smallmouth fishing while there? That is a pretty good smallie lake too."
1215378,Kevin R,2010-07-02 05:18:00,305,"The trip to Wine is a fun time it has been a long time for me, need to do it this year. The Trout in Wabby will be deep most of the time & come up on the reefs to feed mid day in summer when the sun is bright. We have caught them in the 35-45 ft range best. They like deep water close by so most ledges are sharp drops to deep water like 60-70ft same holds true on Cliff lake but Cliff has more trout so you can catch them more often deep & on cloudy days. The big ones 20lbs or better bite best at mid day.Pike will also be mixed in higher in the water but often will not bite that is what you may have seen on your graph."
1215526,ILScott,2010-07-02 19:32:00,139,PeffleysWe did not portage up to Annishinabi. Guy in my group did in the past but said it is big and hard to find the trout. We do fish for smallies at the falls and have found them all over the lake system lately. We find lakers all over Wine. Guy in my group wanted the adventure so we went to the small lake trout lake and did okay. Since they have implemented the slots the fishery has gotten a lot better. Do you have the same slots?Scott
1215578,Peffley'sCamp,2010-07-03 03:54:00,37,"Wine Lake is in fish management zone #4 which has the same MNR regulations and slots that Wabaskang does. Wine Lake Camp has instituted there own slot restrictions over and above what the MNR regulations say. Being the only camp on the lake gives you much more ability to ""control"" that than we have here on Wabaskang. What we continue to find with the vast majority of our guests (regardless of where we are fishing) is that the practice of C & R of bigger fish (all species) is becoming more and more widely accepted and practiced as sportsmen continue to gain knowledge about the importance of releasing the larger brood stock back into the water. We certainly see the benefits of it here on Wabaskang as, in addition to the tremendous population of 14-18"" eater walleye this lake has a reputation for, we see more and more trophy size fish caught and released every year.Our private walk-to portage lake is strictly C & R only and our guests see first hand every time they fish it just what practicing C & R can do for a body of water."
1215588,teddi,2010-07-03 05:49:00,349,your private portage lake is not for the use of your guests only. any one can go in and fish and your c and r rules are for your guests only. ontario residents can move a boat in and leave it there under the 21 day rule. the stories i hear about private lakes from tourist operators really upset me as there are no such things as private lakes up here.
1215633,Peffley'sCamp,2010-07-03 09:56:00,37,"Gee Teddi, didn't mean to ruffle your fur by using the term ""private"". The main point of my addition to the thread is the ongoing benefit of C & R, the reference to the walk to lake was just for illustration."
1220688,jsmyers,2010-07-19 14:55:00,198,"Back a couple of pages....A friend of mine is into marine biology and has learned some limnology (the study of inland waters). He helped me to understand some of the issues at play here:Oxygen is not present in most of the depths of Wabaskang from early summer until the turnover because algae dies and ""snows"" down to the depths, where its decomposition consumes oxygen. Because Wabaskang is relatively shallow, and it has a huge watershed, it is very fertile. While this is a good thing from the standpoint of growing numbers of pike, bass, and walleyes, it means that oxygen is consumed faster in the depths during the summer.A lake with a smaller watershed, like Wine or Anishinabi is not as fertile, and will hold oxygen for longer and into deeper water.However, the rapids and falls can greatly increase the concentration of dissolved oxygen. So the deep hole in Aerobus bay holds the most fish (compared to other deep holes) because it is right below a stream with rapids. The wind on the big lake does add oxygen to the water, but it isn't enough churning to get it down 50' fast enough to counteract the oxygen consumption due to the fertility of the water.So while the structure and the depth of McLeod Bay may be virtually identical to Aerobus Bay, it doesn't benefit as much from the falls on Aerobus Creek, and doesn't have as much oxygen.Having low oxygen doesn't necessarily mean that fish won't swim there though. There are low levels of oxygen that are sufficient for life, but fish in them will have a very low metabolism and will be very inactive. (Think ice fishing for largemouth bass.) So you can mark fish on your sonar that are uncatchable because they are very lethargic.I don't know how deep Wine lake gets, but I can bet that it isn't quite as fertile as wabaskang, and therefore holds its oxygen better, hence it has a more consistent and broad laker fishery. In other words, it is not just depth that creates a good laker fishery."
1214876,ILScott,2010-06-30 11:49:00,139,We fished a lake system by Wabaskang last week. Trout where at about 40-45 foot down. We used a bottom bouncer with a gold spinner rig tipped with a minnow. Caught plenty of trout. We also used 5 of diamonds and gold spoons behind the bottom bouncers with luck. The key for us was to get fishing around 7 and finish about 10 in the morning.Scott
1214900,jsmyers,2010-06-30 13:34:00,198,"I'd only have to assume that you had the wrong presentation for the mood the fish were in. Do you catch lakers with that set up in Lake Michigan, or only browns, steelhead and/or salmon?The difference might be forage. Lake Michigan has smelt and alewives in addition to ciscoes and whitefish. Wabaskang only has ciscoes.I've read online (in about a million different places, the article has been copied over and over) to use really light line (6#) when fishing for deep lake trout. Perhaps all of the hardware you were using scared them off? In a big clear lake like Michigan, it might help bring the fish from a distance, but in those bays, there isn't that much distance to cover."
1214903,jsmyers,2010-06-30 13:49:00,198,"I see in the current regs that trout over 22"" are partially protected. If one wishes to release larger fish but still eat a bit of trout, is this a pretty good rule of thumb""<22"" = eat one>22"" = CPR"
1214911,jsmyers,2010-06-30 13:56:00,198,"In case somebody who isn't as familiar with the area reads this thread...It is worth mentioning that Wabaskang is not a good lake for trout, but that a portage to Wine Lake puts you on better trout water. Peffley's Camp (close to the portage) or Wine Lake Camp (on Wine) are therefore good bets if you really want to get trout."
1214915,Guest,2010-06-30 14:19:00,0,"Unless the regs have changed, the rule for release of trout over 22"" is in effect after some date in Sept, during spawning season. The trout are shallow then and can be successfully released. Trout pulled up from deep water during summer fishing are not very good candidates for release. At least that's what I've been told."
1214923,jsmyers,2010-06-30 14:48:00,198,"That is what I read in the regs.Because they can release air from their bladders, they can be released.But these two links have slightly different advice:http://www.lakegeorgeassociation.org...lake_trout.htmhttp://www.ultimatefishingdirectory....Lake_Trout.pdfOne says to bring the fish in quick to release it. The other one says to pull them up slowly so they can adjust to the pressure change.I'll have to look into that more before I go out there."
1214926,Stu,2010-06-30 14:57:00,472,I have found it's better to bring them up slowly. We brought a little one up fast and it didn't make it.
1215083,ILScott,2010-07-01 07:26:00,139,"I do stay at Wine Lake Camp. We caught trout last week using gold spinner rigs tipped with minnow. We also had success using 5 of diamonds, and gold spoons. By the way I saw more Peffley boats than I ever had. 5-7 boats a day. Is fishing that bad on Wabaskang?Scott"
1215086,Peffley'sCamp,2010-07-01 07:39:00,37,"Scott,Actually the fishing has been excellent on Wabaskang too. We just tend to attract adventurous spirits that like the adventure of going over the falls and exploring and fishing even more water. The trip down the river is worth it even if the fishing sometimes isn't. My wife and I even took some friends of ours who are in camp this week back there to fish. Again, not because we can't catch plenty of fish here, it's just a neat adventure that we wanted to show our friends. Walleye fishing in Beaver was ok, nice fish as usual but we usually catch more on Wabby. Lake trout fishing was good for us even though we fished smack dab in the middle of the day.FYI, we also had a number of our guests portage the second falls and fish Sherin Lake with great success. Several weeks before we had guests taking the creek up to Dowell and catching lots of fish also. So to answer your post--nope the fishing hasn't been that bad on Wabaskang."
1215094,teddi,2010-07-01 07:57:00,349,"i don,t know why anyone would make 2 portages to catch fish if things are that good on wabaskang. the second portage is tough. i guess some people like adventure.[NOT REALLY]"
1214706,JayM5209,2010-06-29 21:48:00,1050,"My reference to the 3rd week is to the 3rd week of the walleye season. This year my group was one week later than usual. We were there from May 28 - June 4. With the early ice out, we were really late for the shallow water lakers.The boat landing on Aerobus is not too bad, and the road has been graded so it's in better shape than most years. I haul my Lund Rebel 1625 back there with no problem, as does another in our group with a 16' Alumacraft Dominator. We've caught lots of lake trout in the small bay where the creek flows out to Wabashkang. Last year another guy and I, having our four lakers in the boat, trolled big Rapala Husky Jerks along the shore of that bay and caught 35 or 40 northerns in about an hour. No huge trophies, but some sizeable fish. Our consistently most productive trout fishing is always at the far southern end of Aerobus. If you motor past Timber Point Camp then take a left through the narrows into the southern part of the lake, go to far end and troll fairly close to shore. Water will range from 30 - 90 feet and I can't remember a year when we didn't pull trout from there. If there's a chance you might make that trip to Aerobus, send me a PM and I'll try to mark up a map to scan and email to you."
1214743,teddi,2010-06-30 04:44:00,349,the boat launch at aerobous belongs to timber point camp and is private for guests only. the owners can get a little pissy about people using it as there is not a lot of room to park.
1214783,Lake Wisconsin,2010-06-30 07:16:00,1960,"I will throw in my $.02 worth and see if someone can shed some light on my experience. I was fishing Wabby June 12-19. While traveling through the lake after 2nd lake towards North Bay (don't know the name of this lake), we marked a lot of fish suspended in 40-60 fow. We came back with our trolling rods and dipseys, tied with flasher fly combos I use on Lake MI for salmon and trout. We trolled and trolled, but not a hit. I could see the fish come up off the bottom and follow our baits for some time, but never a hit. We also tried spoons. After 1.5 hours there, we moved into Aerobus Bay, fishing the south end of the island. Same thing, fish would move up to see our baits, follow and never a hit. Thoughts on what these fish might be or maybe wrong presentation for lakers?"
1214822,JayM5209,2010-06-30 09:03:00,1050,"teddi, you're correct. There used to be a sign at the launch indicating there's a $5 launch fee, payable at Timber Point Camp. We'd always stop at the Camp on our way past to pay the fee and chat a bit with whomever was around. The last two years that sign has not been up, but we stop by the Camp anyway since we always go right past on our way to our laker spots. Rumor had it that the sign was down because the Camp can't legally charge for launching. Don't know about the veracity of that. The parking is tight, especially if the Camp is full, so we always pulled our vehicles and trailers up the road beyond any Timber Point's guest trucks and hiked back to the launch. Never had a problem or issue with the owner.Years ago you could cut off on a narrow lane just before the launch and put your boat into the shallow water just to the south of Timber Point's launch. A deep washout across the trail has made that impossible for some years. As with most situations, a little common sense and courtesy goes a long way, i.e., not blocking other vehicles, leaving plenty of room for others to get to the launch to retrieve their boats, greeting the owners with a cheery Good Morning, etc."
1214871,teddi,2010-06-30 11:28:00,349,timber point camp has a lease from the government for the boat launch. there are new owners this year[old owners from 10+ years ago have the camp back]. mike is good to work with.
1199191,RayRay,2010-05-11 11:30:00,9,Does anyone know where to find the Lake trout on Wabaskang? I hear that you can find some at Aerobus Creek but not sure if you can get into Areobus Lake from Wabaskang. We were up there lost year at Gawleys and I have never caught so many walleyes in my life. Going up June 5th this year and thought if we were early enough we might find some trout action. Any help would be great! Can't wait to get there!!!!
1199198,teddi,2010-05-11 11:52:00,349,"you cannot get into aerobus lake from wabaskang. there are 2 sets of rapids on the creek. i would try the bay [aerobus bay] or mcloud bay. i have had good luck there in the past. i think it is a little late for easy trout fishing. they were up 2 weeks ago and i think they are heading deep by now. try cliff lake,about 15 miles south for trout."
1199442,Stu,2010-05-11 23:44:00,472,"We had decent luck on Aerobus Bay a couple years ago in July when even the locals said we couldn't catch any lakers. We drop frozen ciscoes into deep water and fish them on the bottom. It's pretty boring and we usually do it on our lunch break. If you're interested, I'll give you the specifics. Good luck - Stu"
1199445,RayRay,2010-05-11 23:59:00,9,I am interested in all the info you have.
1200782,Stu,2010-05-16 00:33:00,472,"It's easiest if the fish are still frozen. First, I make a ""needle"" out of a 6"" wire hanger. Then I run the line thru their butt and out their mouth with a 1/2 oz bullet weight. I tie on a small treble hook and pull it tight so it is flush with the mouth of the fish (supposedly lakers grab their prey head first). We drop them between 20 & 30 ft. of water and let them sit on the bottom. I also keep my reel on free spool. It usually only takes 5 - 10 minutes before something picks it up and runs w/ it. I usually wait a few seconds before I set the hook. If it's windy, we'll motor over to the shore. Like I said, it's pretty boring and I really don't go to Canada to bottom fish. I can do that for catfish here at home."
1200785,Stu,2010-05-16 00:53:00,472,"By the way, we have our best luck fishing off the southern tip of the little island in Aerobus Bay. Tall Pines old website had the best map, but it has been taken down. Good luck - Stu"

There is a lot of deep water in McLeod Bay and the smaller basin between these bays and the main lake. The ""big lake"" also has a large expanse of deep water.Also, does anybody has any idea how deep oxygen goes during the summer?"
1213872,Kevin R,2010-06-27 11:05:00,305,I have tried many areas but only Aerobus bay holds any good amount of catchable Lake Trout in Summer. Next would be the Island in front of Wabaskang Camp & south towards Keynote in the Moose bay area. The big lake must not have as much oxygen down deep never caught any Trout in the big lake. Halfway bay area is also dead for Trout it looks like it holds fish deep but never catch any.
1213922,jsmyers,2010-06-27 14:19:00,198,"Thanks for the input Kevin.Is moose bay the area in front of Ruby Lake?I wonder if the water coming in from Aerobus creek helps keep Aerobus Bay well oxygenated. I'd think that the waves out in the big lake would do so as well, but I guess not."
