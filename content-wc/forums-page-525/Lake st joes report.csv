As in most huge lakes there were plenty of submerged boulders. Spent Sat unpacking and a bit of evening fishing to secure our first walleye dinner. Dick (camp owner) intended to fish with us the first day but the prior group overstayed there time and he had to take them out in lieu of fishing with us. Not a big deal but on a large unfamiliar lake it cost us some time needed to get on the fish. Sun, Mon, Tues, we caught plenty of fish in 3-10 feet of water fishing windswept points mostly. Although Dick said jigging was the best method for St Joes we caught the majority of our fish trolling. Weather turned bad for the final three days and slowed the catch quite a bit. Still plenty for dinner but we did not get out as much as hoped for due to high winds. Caught a few northerns in the mid 30""range and a couple around 38. Had a hard time catching enough eater eyes under 18. Mostly 20-22 inch. I caught the largest eye of the week when I tied a Sirmanski Wallski on my 6lb test and trolled over a reef at 16'. The old wallski was definitely bouncing bottom at that depth before the walleye hit it. Only had one with me and I removed it after that fish thinking I would re-rig it with some heavier line and try deeper water later. . Never happened due to weather. Overall good fishing, excellent facilities (four year old cabin with the works) and a good outfitter in Dick. Personally I would have preferred a lake with more moving water but you couldn't complain about the fishing."
