1219606,Guest,2010-07-16 05:14:00,0,"Just returned from 5 days on the lake. Got a total of about 250 walleye and 5 pike for 2 guys. Biggest walleye was 27"" with a 26"", 2 25""'s and several 23""-24"". Biggest pike was 42"" but only got 5 the whole time. Fish were biting most days 8-12 ft. . We trolled spinner rigs with nightcrawlers mostly in the favored spots in bays and rocky points . Overall very successful for us and the other groups did well jigging worms with jigs and shad darts on there favorite spots. They had hundreds of walleyes too using this method. Got some on gulp alive as well, so it seemed to work."
1219857,Mondo_)H,2010-07-16 16:14:00,91,What cabin did you stay in? how were the docks? What was your costomer service like from the outfitter?
1219975,Guest,2010-07-17 06:46:00,0,"We stayed in Cabin 2. Docks were really large and fit 6 boats. Water is down a couple feet but we could still get in and out of there just had to oar out a few feet. Cabins are pretty good, ours had only 3 propane lights so it was a little dark in there. Might want a lantern for the 2 bedrooms, we had 3 flashlights. We checked out the other cabins too and they all looked pretty good. Vaulted ceilings mean the top is open to all bedrooms so it can get noisy in there. Service was really good, they would get anything for you and it is a 1/2 hour boat ride back to Main Lodge where you can gt more worms or drive to a town. The one group actually drove to the cabin 10. 2 area with a big yukon and trailer so they didn't have to boat everything in. One of the best things was fishing was really good around the island in front of the cabin so in the evening you could go out and troll or drift and get 40 walleye or so right there. Also a large shallow beach at the docks was good for swimming."

1220019,SinOrSwim,2010-07-17 09:31:00,1528,"Out of curiosity when people post how many fish they caught, do you really count them or are you just guestimating. Not questioning at all. I never have any idea how many I/we catch."
1220136,polaris-pete,2010-07-17 18:34:00,343,"To answer your question , yes our bunch of guys do count their fish.We all use the little counters that we all use when ice fishing.Makes it a lot easier to know when the perch limit is reached without having to go outside the hut in -10 degree weather. This year at Pasha lake we quit counting after 300 fish each on the second day.Hoping it will be as good next year."
1220210,Guest,2010-07-18 07:12:00,0,"Cost for 2 people for 6 days was 660$. I think 4 days was 600$. The owner said we should keep track of the fish we catch and the size and the numbers we ate and kept to bring home, so we wrote down what we had caught after each fishing session. We kept announcing a running total as we caught them so we were pretty close, but not exact. It would be hard to try and count every fish without counters for sure. Sometimes they were coming pretty fast."

1220394,Mondo_)H,2010-07-18 18:01:00,91,"$660 Each Andre CAN nichol and dime you IF you let him! I just looked up 09 prices $755 each, minimum 4 people Housekeeping plan"
1220511,Freytown,2010-07-19 06:21:00,770,Not listing prices on his website did raise a red flag. Variable rates for the same time frame will get him a bad rap real quick.Thxs for the info.
