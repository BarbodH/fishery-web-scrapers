4672178,Babamel2,2016-03-25 16:31:00,414,"I once used a motel booking outfit and realized how it works. I booked for multiple nights. The first was below motel regular price the following nights were more expensive plus they added taxes and fees. In the end I paid more than $180 for the additional 3 nights. They met their advertised comment as ""they found me a lower price than offered by the motel. However, that was only for the first night. The reason I know this, I got billed by the motel then later on my credit card by the booking co. It was a pain to get it all sorted out. Luckily, I did get my money back from the booking company. I will never use them again."

4667305,wmd,2016-03-24 10:24:00,388,"Where do you stay in Sioux Lookout and what rate do you pay for a double room? We go to a boat in lodge and spend the night, and have been staying at the Best western. There are no issues there but curious where others stay and what you pay. Looking on Best Westerns website they are quoting $139 CD for a double, we paid $124 CD last year. Thanks wmd"
4667569,tv4fish,2016-03-24 11:19:00,2694,This is a hotel you may want to contact. We don't stay there - but I have to believe their rates are pretty reasonable - plus they have a restaurant that has good breakfasts. You may know that they are just outside of Sioux Lookout.http://www.lamplightermotel.ca/
4667585,NARDA 1,2016-03-24 11:24:00,636,Check Expedia.com they are quoting $87 per night for a double queen at the Days Inn and $106 for the Best Western. I used the first weekend in June for the quotes.

4668169,Pooch,2016-03-24 14:05:00,4619,Ditto the Lamplighter. Old style motel that is clean and has a great breakfast and a wall long map of Lac Seul in the hallway. Parking front and back. Right on the highway south of Sioux Lookout. Been there lots of times over the years. I think they may even have a fish cleaning shack in the back? Can't remember for sure. Never used it. Always just traveling through.Pooch
4668825,Mike Borger,2016-03-24 16:23:00,1554,We stayed in the Lamplighter last summer and liked it fine. All the rooms are ground floor and you can park right in front of your room. No hauling stuff up stairs. Breakfast was pretty good too. No complaints at all.
4668977,NARDA 1,2016-03-24 16:59:00,636,"Not a problem, but I'm not cheap!!!"
4671290,Carnhzkr,2016-03-25 11:39:00,964,Expedia is quoting in USD. $139 CAD vs. $106 USD is roughly the same.
4671354,prov1800,2016-03-25 12:14:00,5010,There is also the forrest inn.
4672114,pjshorthorn,2016-03-25 15:59:00,5654,This place. Been staying there since 1982. Good breakfast and reasonable room rates. PjShorthorn.
