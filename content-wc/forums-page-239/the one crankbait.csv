4660057,zeebee,2016-03-22 13:52:00,1144,"early in the season a jointed rap....J-9 or J-11. As the season progresses and they move into depths, a Rap deep husky jerk, DHJ-12; still later in the season when they are 30' or more, a Sebile Koolie LL.....they can reach 50'+."
4580689,MrSimon,2016-02-25 07:40:00,922,"A chrome/blue rattle trap. It's not your typical walleye crankbait, but it runs fairly shallow, can be trolled fast to cover water, and in our experience it catches TONS of fish."
4580833,adempsey,2016-02-25 08:08:00,963,"For me, it's a close call between a Rapala Shad Rap, Berkley Flicker Shad and a Storm Hot'n'Tot. I'd just stick my hand in box full of these and take whatever sticks to me.I am quite surprised at the popularity of the Hot'n'Tot. Definitely one of my favorites, but I thought the Shad Rap would be the front runner for sure."
4580969,68camaro,2016-02-25 09:05:00,10,It's funny because no one normally speaks of them . Kind of a secret bait it seemsSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
4581049,Mike Borger,2016-02-25 09:34:00,1554,Early spring or trolling at dusk a #12 or #14 Rapala Husky Jerk in Tennessee Shad or Gold.Any other scenario it's a #8 or #9 deep diving Shad Rap. Purpledescent or Perch.
4598889,Hunts1,2016-03-01 19:10:00,123,"Depends on the lake regarding color, but early season smaller bait (3-5 inches) in shallower water near a break to deeper water. I like, in Lac Seul, purple, perch, or gold. But also like to jig then, slower presentation with minnow. But to each his own.....also depends on ice out. Many variables but the specific lake is important."
4598937,That Minnesota guy,2016-03-01 19:29:00,8293,For 1 million dollars you say? Looks like you might need it to buy all the different cranks suggested. I can't offer a good idea because that means taking my 5 of Diamonds off and that isn't happening.

4601801,spurs101,2016-03-02 16:25:00,635,I'd add a Storm Deep Thunderstick Jr in that close call category. If I only had one it would be the Hot-n-Tot in a black/chrome.
4608633,Guest,2016-03-04 16:00:00,0,"I only get to fish Aug. But a floating perch colored Rapala behind bottom bouncer; two big split shot or one split shot. Just enough ahead of the lure so I can land the fish once the weight is reeled in close to the front eye of my Ugly Stick Light. Whether I fly -in, boat-in, or canoe a river with 20 portages."

4571521,David Anderson,2016-02-22 14:20:00,2073,"Interesting question as I plan on being there for opener on the 20th. The guys I fish with always jig with minnows and because I am a guest, tend to be stuck with going with the flow. I would like to try and throw cranks into the shallower water as we tend to set up in about 8 feet in the spring and the #7's or 9 shad rap as well the flicker shads tend to run deeper, seems like worth a try! I have had great luck pitching Gulp as I think it's because I am covering more water than the usual off the side of the boat."

4572049,turkeyriver,2016-02-22 16:44:00,80,"I am not nearly as experienced as most of you guys are when it comes to walleye fishing. I've never done any crankbait fishing, just three ways with half a crawler or minnow. Do you troll cranks or cast? How hard is it to get them to go deep enough? Think I saw one guy on this thread talk briefly about a crankbait on a three way? Any body enlighten me a little here?"
4572977,fishpoop,2016-02-22 23:14:00,630,"Whether you cast or troll crankbaits depends upon the area and depth you're trying to fish and that's true if you're talking any other type of presentation too. If you're fishing very shallow chances are you're casting and if you're fishing deep chances are you're trolling. That's generalized but I think you get what I mean. So, yeah, you can use crankbaits on a 3 way rig in place of a livebait rig. It's a good way to present something to the fish at a little faster speed than a crawler or minnow rig. Pick a floating Rapala and tie it on and start trolling the same spots you fish your bait rigs. Crankbaits can be used to fish for suspended fish, say 10 feet down over 20 feet of water depth. They could be casted or trolled in this situation. The lip on a crankbait determines how deep the lure will dive. The bigger the lip the deeper it will dive. Where on the lure the lip is attached also determines how deep it will dive. If it's attached to the nose it will dive deeper than a lip attached under it like a Rapala minnow, which runs shallow. This is very basic info I'm posting. You can read many books and articles about crankbait fishing. There are hours of video that explain it all. You're going to have to put some time and effort into learning how to do it. Good luck, have fun, release a big one."

We all are about out of the clowns and sad to say they don't make them any longer walleye love them and the pike just cant stay off them hence the short supply!!
