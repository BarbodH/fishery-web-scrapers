4669433,ziggy6,2016-03-24 18:44:00,8,"My crew and I are having a great time getting things together..amazing how many meetings we need (at the local tavern) to discuss everything. We were hoping for some more info from some of you veterans to the area: .From many of the posts we know we should get leeches, can any one suggest a bait shop and should we try contacting them ahead of time? also with 4 fisherman for 4 days how many pounds should we purchase? amount of worms? As for hotels, the night before our drive into the lodge does anyone have any suggestions? North Bay or Temiscaming? Thanks again for all the advice we've been receiving..without it we would be definitely travelling clueless. Ziggy"
4670842,fsz,2016-03-25 09:46:00,144,"Most crews that use leeches buy them in North Bay, I believe there are a few bait shops on 63 right after the turn off from 11 (@ Wal-Mart). There is a bait and tackle on the north side immediately after the turn (shop looks pretty beat up and shadey) plus they may have leeches at Trout Lake (an actual lake) on your right hand side of 63. Both of these are directly on the way to Temiscaming, but I can't confirm if either have leeches. The store at Trout lake is nice, if they have leeches that's where I would get them. Try googling ""Trout Lake North Bay"" perhaps. There are certainly other bait shops in North Bay its a big town. Bottom line- If I wanted leeches- I would get them somewhere in North Bay and know where I was getting them before hand...for the most part don't count on finding anything in Temiscaming. As far as worms, depends on your fishing style. Jigging you can break worms in half or thirds, trolling harnesses usually requires a whole worm. I have never been to Ogascanan but I would think you would be good with a dozen per man per day if you are also using leeches. At the lake I fish (not far from Ogascanan), we use Berkley leeches on jigs (both the ""wet"" gulp and ""dry"" powerbait ones). Actually outperforms live leeches. I would bring some of these just to try. We also use Berkley power grubs 3"") on plain jig heads tipped white, yellow mainly with a small amount of crawler. These presentations may work on our lake because its a dark water lake with no outfitting operations. I believe Ogascanan is a clear water lake with some fishing pressure (not saying a lot) so the fish may not respond to artificial baits as well. As for hotels night before, depends on what you are looking for. North Bay is a big town, lots of restaurants and accommodation choices plus ""adult entertainment"" options. Temiscaming is about one hour from NB and of course is closer to your destination. This one hour may not seem like a big deal, but the bush road conditions to Ogascanan can vary quite a bit. It takes most people longer on the bush road than they anticipate, especially if not in a pickup. Temiscaming has a few motels (2 I think). One is called the ""Temrose"" I think, the other is the ""Auberage Canadien"". Both have restaurant-bars, never stayed in either motel we eat at the ""Canadien"" every year. You Temiscaming is a quiet town without traffic or major entertainment venues. Being in QC it is predominately French predominately but English is widely used. We have always had positive experiences. we see crews each year that stayed overnight at the Canadien eating breakfast getting ready to bug into Ogascanan, club trout lake, Kipawa etc. (we drive overnight and arrive temiscaming 0600). If you are going from June 1 to 30 black flies can be a big problem in that area. there is a store in temiscaming called ""stop 102"". They usually have ""bug suits"" (maybe $30) for the black flies. If those flies are out you will wish you have one. Hope this helps."

4673850,Ira,2016-03-26 09:55:00,6,"Thanks for starting this thread, Zig (I'm one of the boys traveling w/ him).I'm also interested in filling my tackle box, hopefully with stuff that will pull in fish.Just curious - suppose you only had $100 to spend on tackle. What would be your go-to purchases? I've been having a great time shopping, like a kid filling out his Christmas list.And Zig - when's the next ""meeting""?"
4592065,polaris-pete,2016-02-28 18:50:00,343,"Ziggy- check out this nice website.kipawfishing.net. When on the Home page look for trip reports. Scroll through as there are quite a few trip reports, many with nice pictures to see what the areas like and different stuff you may find useful."
4594073,Mojo-NC,2016-02-29 12:18:00,1929,"Ziggy, the first thing we always tell our new guys going to Canada for their first time is to bring a quality rain suit. I can't stress that enough. Regarding fishing equipment, we fly up so we're limited with tackle. I would recommend bringing two 6 1/2 - 7' spinning rods, one loaded with a jig and the other with a spinner rig or crawler harness. I would also bring two baitcasting rods, one loaded with a spinner bait of your choice and the other with a spoon like a Dardevle (red/white, 5 of diamonds, or firetiger) or a crankbait/stickbait. You'll catch a bunch of fish. I like chartreuse, orange, or pink colors for jigs and gold, silver and blue color patterns for the spinner rigs. If the mayfly hatch is on, we switch to brown/black colors to match the hatch. A place like Northland Tackle has a nice selection of walleye tackle available, but you can get it anywhere. I really like their Baitfish patterns for the walleye spinner rigs. Good luck!"
4597681,Paul West,2016-03-01 13:25:00,1,"Hello. I never fished this particular lake, but have fished all around it. Best lake we found in this zec is lac foise or grassy lake, Ted Watson has a lodge on it. June and August are by far the best months for walleye. No live bait allowed, and they police it well. Got a few wild stories about that. Worm harnesses (homemade) with rubber worked well as did bottom bouncers. In June fish shallow, like 4 -5 feet. At dawn and dusk is best for this depth. We made the mistake of fishing deeper and had far less hits. Be prepared for the bugs. If it wasn't for therma cells I wouldn't go back at this time. Brutal, and I'm a bush guy. Anyone fished Camp Coucoushee in this zec?"
4602313,fsz,2016-03-02 18:09:00,144,"I don't believe grassy is in zec kipawa, it is in a non-zec area of Quebec zone 13 west, although the lake's north shore does border the zec. The outfitter on the lake does not have exclusive rights as do the outfitters on Dumoine which is down the road a bit. Checked my previous Quebec zone 13 fishing regulations, I don't see a prohibition on worms or leeches (I do think minnows are not allowed at all in zone 13) for Grassy, is this perhaps the outfitters rule? As far as Ogascanan, definitely no minnows allowed but I'm pretty sure crawlers and leeches are permissible. For that region, hard to beat #11 rapalas, gold and silver, in the evening after supper, start out with a few split shot and gradually remove them as the sun starts to set."
4604529,retire55,2016-03-03 09:58:00,1029,I can verify that Lac aux Foins (Grassy lake) is not in ZEC Kipawa (I have a map of ZEC Kipawa). There are rumours about that Quebec will be changing some of its sport fishing rules for the upcoming season. The new regulations which take effect 1 April 2016 are not yet available on line.
4605449,polaris-pete,2016-03-03 15:05:00,343,There is no prohibition on Leeches providing they are purchased in Ontario or in Quebec. You just cannot import them across the border from the USA l
4605481,ziggy6,2016-03-03 15:18:00,8,"Thanks to everyone for all the info...I greatly appreciate it. I've started making a list of tackle and lures along with things such as a bug suit and themacell. PLease feel free to toss any advice you have about fishing this area ,I've been planning on this type of trip for years and finally decided to pull the trigger this year. My buddy and I are novices at this type of fishing but we have been reading the Kipawa blog and all the reports...they make for great reading and great info. I do have a question ,I have a Marcum flasher that I use for ice fishing has anyone purchased the open water transducer ? was wondering if its what I should do or purchase a different fish finder to use on the trip. Thanks again! Ziggy"
4605521,revitup,2016-03-03 15:34:00,140,I have used the tackle from www.riverwalleyes.com the last several years. Nice variety and good quality at a reasonable price. Fills orders quickly and has always been fair with my group.
4605833,spurs101,2016-03-03 16:50:00,635,"I've fished a neighboring lake since 1984, most of the time twice a year. In early June, we'd fish 5-9ft of water trolling 1/4 and 1/8 oz jigs ..twister tail and crawler. Colors....chartreuse, motor oil, green bloodline, white. Fish all day for walleye. For cranks...Hot-n-Tots and Shad Raps #5 in shad color. The majority of the large walleyes seemed to be caught during the day..just in slightly deeper water. I'd switch to Deep Thunderstick Jrs if I was targeting deeper than 9'. Black/chrome and perch."
4606321,retire55,2016-03-03 19:46:00,1029,"Since this is a trip you have wanting to do for many years, I'd recommend buying a sonar unit. If you plan to use any sonar unit only occasionally, there are inexpensive 5 inch grey scale displays available. I purchased a Lowrance Mark-5x Pro last year as my back up sonar unit for less than $200 Canadian. I purchased my primary sonar unit (a Lowrance HDS7) back in 2009. While the technology is old, it's still working fine. And don't worry about portability - any sonar unit can be made to work in a portable configuration."

Not sure I still have it though as we quit going there Years ago after finding fly-in trips at almost the same cost and way better fishing.I will say that Brad and Ginny and Boys were always gratious Hosts and they have done alot of improvements since we were there."
4585329,fsz,2016-02-26 14:17:00,144,"Never fished that lake but have in the general area. If you are going to that area in June I would recommend therma cells, head nets, 100% deet and a good bug suit. There is a two week period each year when the black flies are almost unbearable, especially if there is not much wind. Flip side is the fishing is usually at its best"
4585737,ziggy6,2016-02-26 16:15:00,8,Thanks for the fly advice..can only imagine how bad it can get up there... any other advice is greatly appreciated. Not being a successful walleye fisherman( not many of them in our general area) does anyone have a suggestion as to what type of lures we should obtain before making the trip? also Leeches are they worth the effort in obtaining? thanks Pete
4585873,retire55,2016-02-26 17:23:00,1029,"Hi Pete, Every fisherman has their own preferences for rods and reels regardless the fishing method. While I have only fished Lac Ogascanan once, I have been fishing nearby lakes every year since 2000. As for fishing methods, I think you will be bottom bouncing, dragging crankbaits, vertically jigging and/or slip bobbering. Bottom bouncing and/or dragging crankbaits permit you to cover water more quickly to locate the walleye as compared to the other two methods. Although you could get by with a bottom bouncing rod and reel and a jigging rod and reel, most walleye fishermen have multiple rods with them (a rod and reel for each fishing method and as backups). At the end of Jun, you most likely will find the walleye between 8 and 25 feet. Consequently, you won't require bottom bouncers heavier than 2 ounces. I've always had success bottom bouncing with crawler harnesses either with a crawler or with a leech. For vertical jigging or even drift jigging, because the walleye bite is usually very light, you'll require light weight jigs from 1/32 ounce up to ¼ ounce. Occasionally, heavier jigs will be required for fishing deeper water and/or current or rough water scenarios. A medium light rod (with a fast tip) and a good quality size 1000 (Shimano size) spinning reel should do the trick. Slip bobbering is a great way to fish suspended walleye or snaggy bottoms. Always have crawlers and leeches. Review and understand the Quebec Sports fishing Regulations  the new regulations will be available on-line in March. Check here for them: http://www.mffp.gouv.qc.ca/english/p...ng-periods.asp"
4586761,ziggy6,2016-02-27 04:56:00,8,Thanks... are there any colors or styles that work better? I do appreciate any info. Starting to make a list and plan on visiting Bass Pro in the coming weeks.
4591961,polaris-pete,2016-02-28 18:20:00,343,"Take lures that resemble perch , silver minnows.You don't need large lures in the early Springtime.Crankbaits in the 3- 4 inch range work good.Mister Twisters also work well, either trolling on the bottom or casting and drifting. It depends on the depth of the water which will dictate whether to use a shallow running lure or a deeper diver. We always have great luck on Rapalas, Hot n Tots, Renoskys, flicer shads. Also take an assortment of pinch on sinkers if you just want to drift using a hook and minnow or nightcrawler. We had great luck last year using the Mustad slow death hooks and a half of a worm, drifting or trolling the shorelines and bays.As for leeches, do not try and bring them across the Border as theya re illegal to bring into Canada. There is a large bait store in North Bay where we used to buy our leeches before going to camp. I am not sure what Brad has for bait but he used to have minnows. Take nightcrawlers and an assortment of worm harnesses in different colors.You will need inline trolling sinkers to get the harnesses to the bottom ( 1/4 oz to 3/4oz will do) when trolling.I always take an asortment of the trolling sinkers with the rubber core inserts to protect your line and makes removing them real easy.Water Gremlin makes the best but theyre getting hard to find now that you cannot buy leaded sinkers anymore, here in NY.E Bay usually has them but get them early as they go quickly. When trolling the shorelines the fish will be very shallow and snags will be part of your fishing experiences there. Once you find the wallies trolling, either drift or anchor and cast crankbaits or jig to catch them. We always do very well using slip bobbers.This lake can get very windy and it ususally runs right down the lake and it can get rough, and I mean rough at times. Are you staying on the mainland or one of the camps on the Lake?"
4592017,ziggy6,2016-02-28 18:43:00,8,Thanks for the advice... it is greatly appreciated. We're staying at island outpost #4. Even though its still several months away I wanted to get started getting my gear in order and figuring out what I need and so on. So all the advice I'm getting is very helpful. Not sure what to expect I guess and realize once we're there we cant run out and stock up on needed items.
