I used to carry a fairly large Rubbermaid, or other make open container. When moving to another spot, instead of throwing the stringer-ed fish on the floor, just put some water in the container and place the fish in it. It can be surprising how much longer the fish will live when their gills remain constantly wet. I never liked to clean a stone dead fish, pictures of them also suck. Bill *Stringer: A length of rope or other rope-like material which may have loop hooks on it to keep fish alive for a while in the water. Term may be unfamiliar to youngsters who grew up always having a live well in any boat in which they fished."

4663185,adempsey,2016-03-23 10:58:00,963,Y'all forgot TP and wet wipes! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10lLPlhmytc
4664369,pikeman14,2016-03-23 15:43:00,144,Maintenance wipe lol!! Sad but true
4664857,Guest,2016-03-23 17:55:00,0,This is exactly why I quit doing rentals. I haul my boat with all my creature comforts included. I'm too old to suffer in those rentals. No problem in my youth. Huge problem today.
4665945,troutaholic,2016-03-24 04:21:00,827,.............a full cooler!!!!
4657561,pikeman14,2016-03-21 17:34:00,144,"What do you bring along in the boat to make your fishing area more comfortable? In the past I have brought along little ""extras"" like small magnets for the map, bungee cords to strap things down, a piece of pool Styrofoam ""noodle"" to stick hooks into, coffee mug clip. I was thinking of a rod holder, tite loc style. Any creature comforts?"
4657809,drew59,2016-03-21 18:32:00,87,"I assume you are renting a boat like I do. I have a dedicated Rubermade type container big enough to hold ""essentials"" like rain gear, first aid, TP , bug spray, and anything else I think I might need. It's small enough to be stowed out of the way. It stays in the boat all week."
4659377,adempsey,2016-03-22 09:31:00,963,"A fly swatter so I can kill my arch enemy, the stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans. I hate those **** ankle biters."
4659505,oleJoe,2016-03-22 10:27:00,114,We do a fly in but always take 2 towels and a sponge for each boat. Also a pair of pliers and a jaw spreader on a 3 foot cord tied to the boat. I got tired of throwing the pliers in the lake!!
4659705,jkaup,2016-03-22 11:39:00,56,What about a cushion to prevent 'boat butt' on a fly in?
4659745,Bayou,2016-03-22 12:06:00,52,"I always have a boat cushion, jaw spreaders tied to a small buoy as well as long pliers tied to an additional buoy, a sponge and a rag."
4659977,prov1800,2016-03-22 13:18:00,5010,"You got that part right.when there in season its pants, socks and ankle high runners.littlectrick though is i put a dead minnow on the floor of the boat and can usually get 20 at a crack.i have also about mid day fogged my boat with yard raid.it does work and i dont care what a can costs.its worth it.freind of mine uses downy laundry softners , hangs them in stratigic spots.seems to also work.ive seen a lot of my guests doing the jig in my boat, even after ive warned them.lol."
4660177,Old Timer,2016-03-22 14:27:00,255,Some good ideas here. The older I get the more I appreciate light gear and a rod holder. And something for my back. Most fly-in camps now have swivel seats on their boats. Nice touch.
4660809,pikeman14,2016-03-22 17:36:00,144,I must be the best fishing partner when it comes to mosquitos and horse flies. I've had guys ask me if I was OK when they see me covered in bloody bites. The laundry sheet trick doesn't work for me
4661033,Blades-n-Beads,2016-03-22 18:24:00,484,Try lemon eucalyptus Repel for those ankle biting sons of ¥||>{+.'s It absolutely works wonders. I won't leave without it Bladse
