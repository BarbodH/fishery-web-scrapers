Fishing was not great but we did catch walleye, northern, and smallmouth. Let me know what questions you have and I will attempt to answer them."

This year I'm going by way of Niagara Falls and taking 3 days. Anyhow I picked a campground on the Serpent River about 12 miles west of the camp you mentioned for an overnite stay. Just seemed like a nice area, and thought if the fishing was good, I could spend a day or 2 coming and going. We have a slide in truck camper and pull our own boat, so being retired, we can spend some time along the way."
