575808,KSmithy72,2008-07-06 07:02:00,6,"I will start by saying, wow, what a trip! Our (motley) crew of 8 left Buffalo on Saturday 6/21 and headed north; crossing the border around 10am quickly and with no incident. Rain and high 60's. We made it up to North Bay around 3pm and stopped at Trout Lake Bait to find only 2 lbs of leeches....luckily we had 4.5 lbs reserved up at Kipawa Bait and we pressed on and picked them up there. Leeches ranged from small to large, with most being a medium or medium small size, but in good health. As far as finding them... a word to the wise...Figure out your leech situation beforehand or prepare to be fishing with something else! Checked into the Auberge and headed into town for onions, potatoes and beer. Provigo had some great deals on Bleue. Dinner at the Temrose was great and we headed back up to the Auberge bar around 7 or 8 to find it empty, but with free pool! We thoroughly enjoyed the round after round of pool, (and beer) and the cop in our group was kind enough to showcase the telltale signs of drunks and sobriety tests were given to all in attendance. None of us passed! Fortunately, we were walking...hit the sacks around midnight. Sunday 6/22 5:30 wake up...breakfast at the Auberge. We head down Maniwaki at 7:30. Road was recently graded wasn't too bad Until the last stretch when one in our group lost his breakfast, and another was blinded with a migraine. Jimmy James and I are riding' shotgun and feeling' fine though! Keep on trucking'! We check in around 9:30....great to see the Mullens clan again! It's always interesting to see what upgrades they make to their facilities each year. We are staying at Smith Pass Outpost which is about 5 miles form the lodge and only accessible by boat....Jeremy Mullens loaded an incredible amount of our stuff into their big boat and beat us out to our cabin by 15 minutes or so. We arrived to find all of the big stuff unloaded and carried up to the cabin...Thanks again Jer! We start fishing around 1 pm...water temp 63 deg .it's overcast and around 70 degrees....My boat partner has his huge gold/blk floating rapala in the water for all of 30 seconds (my line isn't even in the water yet) and his pole goes down! Nice 5 lb laker for officer JJ! Roughly 10 feet down. Lakers are still shallow! My father in law, Walleye Willy, boats a beauty 4.5 lb Eye after about 2 minutes in the water with a silver/black hot n tot! Holy cow, it's gonna be quite a trip. Interesting note after dinner JJ and I are heading across the main lake, 80 fow and I look off our bow 50 yards and notice what I think is a slightly submerged rock being pounded by waves. Man, I guess the Mullens haven't marked that hump yet huh? I say to JJ. But as we get closer, I'm still in 80 fow and the hump' just disappeared! Turned out to be walleye way offshore driving baitfish to the surface! Unreal never seen this before .we decide to troll the are no structure whatsoever less than 3 minutes in and Jimmy's pole goes down and he pulls in a beautiful 4 lb blue. 5 minutes later, my pole goes down hard too .unfortunately, it's in my rodholder and I can't set the hook quick enough and lose what I believe to be another 4 lbr. Promising and exhausting first day. We hit the sacks and wait for the alarm clock to chirp .at . 4:44am Monday 6/23 This is likely the only day of the trip that I don't hit snooze once or twice. Irish coffee, cereal and out the door and in the boats by 5:45. Gorgeous AM, flat and foggy all over the lake very thankful to be in my happy place this AM. Jimmy and I head up to Cigarette Creek area and I'm still looking for fish #1. I catch a handful of small eyes and a small pike on a perch colored little cleo. 1st time catching eyes on a spoon. JJ and I headed up Lescot Creek to see how far we could get .man, what a long winding creek! On the way up, I had the pleasure of watching a loon swim directly under our boat at Mach 2! We cast for pike but caught far more lumber and bushes than fish. We probably got ¾ mile up it until we came to a class 3 rapids and turned back On the way back a momma wood duck and 7 or 8 ducklings got in front of us and scurried along in front of us leading the way back to Taylor Bay. We bottom bounce for a bit, try out my new planer board, and even troll for lakers sun is getting high and it's fairly hot and cloud free. Tough on the fishing and we head in for lunch. Captain Rob (future host of RW's Canadian Adventures) radios over and tells us that they are catching fish off a favorite spot of ours, Peninsula. JJ and I head over and I pick up a nice 3.8 lbr BBing Northland Gold Shiner in 15 fow...we finish the evening throwing for Pike in a back bay not much luck for them. Great sunset. 14 fish in the boat for me on day 2. Great day all around. Other guys in the group caught a nice 38 pike and Walleye Wally (not to be confused with Willy) boats a beauty 5 lb laker and puts her down as his Keeper .first man on the board for the silver chalice that is the Keeper Cup. Tuesday 6/24 .Boat partner change and Walleye Willy and I are set for greatness today Cloudless, slight wind 5 mph or so. We catch a handful most memorable was Willy's 30 pike we end the evening bouncing a new hump we found trolling and getting a couple. Water temp is up to 69 in the main lake now. We eat like kings this night .18 lbs of fried turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy and corn. Nice work Mr. Bob. Wednesday 6/25 Last day for 5 of 8 of us. Partly cloudy 60's, good wind from the south 10-15 mph. Wally and Dave have been religiously trolling for lakers and boat a couple more this AM .yellow hot n tot seemed to get the majority. Willy and I head up to Taylor Bay and catch a couple of nice pike bottom bouncing for eyes .where are the eyes though?? Patience .it is indeed, a virtue. A couple hours in and I position us off a rock spine in Taylor. 10 -14 fow Wind is hitting them hard, and there's tons of sediment in the water .Willy pulls out a Rapala Purple Sunfire. Whatcha think a dis, Kevvy? he asks. #### pretty lure Willy! I reply. This lure of course has never hit the water til now, but my, how it glistened in the sunlight that morning; destined for greatness. Willy starts casting and within a few throws I got one! he says. Did he ever! A few nice runs later and I hardly believe my weary, lack of sleep eyes! 7 lbs 2 oz and 28of Blue Walleye! Our largest eye ever on the lake by a pound a half! She is released to fight another day. We are laughing, high-fiving and oh yeah Willy claims it as his keeper and proceeds to bump the proud, yet gracious Walleye Wally from the Keeper cup standings. Interestingly enough, this big girl was up feeding in 12 fow, but only 5 or so feet down. We finish the day off with a killer fish fry and fries. Who needs work? Willy and I head out that evening only to be chased back in by a thunderstorm. A couple guys chose to stay out and fish in it and the buckets of rain it brought with it and as a result (no they didn't perish, a painful, fiery death) they had the best night of the entire trip catching 30-40 eyes anchored at a small narrows area most small, but enough for 8 eaters and narrowly missing a 5 lbr. Thursday 6/26 Move-out day for 5 of our group and we all head back to the main lodge to say goodbye. Walleye Willy, Captain Rob (future host of RW's Canadian Adventures) and I remain to carry on the difficult task of fishing 14 hours a day. Cap'n Rob (future host of RW's Canadian Adventures) catches a solid 3 lbr this AM off a new area south of Anvil .day is bright and fairly flat. We say adieu (that's French for later on, Hosers) and start trolling lakers not far from the lodge .I've got my downrigger at 18 feet and I'm trolling New School'- Gold/black/orange Husky Jerk My release pops and it's a nice fish .but not the 8 lb laker I expected .It's a 32 pike, who just devoured my lure .I worked on her for 10 minutes, (each of the 3 trebles was hooked with the back one in her gills) before reviewing my Charles Manson scene looking boat and realizing we would unfortunately be naming her dinner'. This fish beat the heck out of my favorite lure, so much that I couldn't get it back running straight, and put er into retirement. This night, we head out to our now nightly narrows spot and Captain Dan Mullens (future star of the Dan's Outboard Maintenance' segment on RW's Canadian Adventures). Dan is truly the fish whisperer. Even though Rob had the corner the honey pot spot thru clever boat positioning, Dan catches one after the next! All up the four of us catch 30-40 or so eyes and miss a dandy pike. Highlight for me is when I'm reeling in a 10 eye to see it's being held by a 25 pike, only to have another pike attempt to grab pike #1 one right at the boat! I end up with only 1 pretty beaten up eye, not 3, as I had hoped first time ever seeing that!! Very cool. Did I mention the bugs? Holy crow! Ever see the The Perfect Storm'? It was sort of like that for bugs! Black Flies were on their way out, but still in effect. Horseflies were coming into their own! But Jimminy Crickets the skeeters were brutal when we were close to shore in the evening bug jackets and 100% deet were all that worked. These skeeters scoffed at our deep woods off and Skeeter coils! Dan, thanks for the visit. It was a night none of us will soon forget. Friday 6/27  Bright AM pretty flat and cloud free. We fish for a few hours in the AM, catch a couple deep but decide to head in for a long, well-deserved nap. It's hot the lake around our cabin is now 73 deg on the surface! Cap'n Rob (future host of RW's Canadian Adventures) sneaks out and leaves a note 'GONE FISHIN. Call me on the radio'. What a sneaky Weasel .fishin without me! It's 85 or so today and sunny with a few puffy clouds and next to no wind. Wouldn't ya know it?! while he is on the radio with me the Cap'n pulls out a beauty 5.1 lb Blue Eye trolling dead slow! .she's released at the dock after he shows her off and pontificates about his evil plan to win the Keeper Cup. We head out to our nightly spot to see the eyes and Skeeters come together this time with a brilliant sunset. Another 20 or 25 caught. Several doubles. Lights out. Saturday 6/28  Last day?! What? This isn't reality? We can't stay here forever? We have a team huddle this AM over Lucky Charms and decide to stick close to home, at known hot spots. The day is party cloudy in the AM, and Willy and I are trolling an area we call the Inlet I've broken out silver black J-11 for the first time all trip and my pole goes down. Snag? Nope. Biggun on! I look over at the friendly face of the current holder of the Keeper Cup and watch the concern in his eyes. If it's an eye, I'm gonna give you a run Willy! I say. It was. I couple nice runs and Willy nets a sweet and hungry Blue Eye. My largest to date was a 5.6 lbr last year and she is bigger than that! I zero out the scale and watch Willy twitch, knowing that the cup is nearly his! Willy escapes certain frustration I wink and and this girl measures in at 6 lbs, 10 oz. A few pics and she's still swimming today. Great fish new spot! 12 FOW. About 6-8 ft down. Later in the AM, we head over to Peninsula where we've always caught fish bottom bouncing. Willy in front, me in the back and Cap'n is in his own vessel. We are all using Northland's gold Shiner at this point, but I am the only one using a lead colored BB'r vs a painted one. Boy, what a difference! Over the next couple hours the wind picks up 10-15 mph from the east and is blasting this rocky shoreline. We are mostly backtrolling and drifting as I catch 6 - 2.5 to 3 lbrs in a row and miss a few more. Willy has yet to get a bite and the Cap'n has 1 or 2 in the boat. At this point, Willy gets snagged up, and his new baitcast reel birdsnests for good measure. He is hot. Sick of netting my fish, weary of the stringer. Tired of the rain I would imagine too. I offer to exchange rods so he can keep fishing he refuses meanwhile, I catch another one. After this, I offer again again refused. The rain continues to worsen big drops now and the ball of fireline on his reel is getting bigger. A few minutes are passed with Willy's expletives. Do me a favor, Willy? Hold this. I say handing him my pole. Willy, always helpful, looks at me a pole in each hand. Now hand me yours. I say. And he does. It's blowing harder now I put us a ways off the rocks, in deeper water, so I can work on this cluster this water was deeper than we would been fishing by at least 10 feet. Drifting. And ..I'm snagged he says as I cut dozens of yards of fireline away from his reel. I look down at the fishfinder 24 fow mud bottom. Snagged on what? Where's your line? I ask. Willy holds it up and we both watch as the snag' on the other end slowly pulls back. Willy, you got a fish there? I think I do! he replies. Sweet! I'm getting the net ready and watching in utter amazement .HUGE Walleye Monstrous. Not a bunch of fight, but enough next to the boat, to make me wet myself. Ready for this? 11 lbs 10 oz and 32 inches of Blue Walleye! This man, already legendary by catching the group record fish 3 days earlier, had just landed one 4-1/2 lbs bigger! She is as enormous, as the smiles on our faces. We unhook her some quick pics to remember her by and after a minute back in the drink, away she swam. The best part is this: Had Willy never gotten snagged and birdsnested, I wouldn't have been working on his reel and would never have been fishing that deep in these conditions. Funny thing this fishing. We press on to another double of 2.5 lb eyes and I finish the AM with a sweet stringer and a boatload of memories. That night we head out to our narrows spot the highlight for me is a 5.1 Snubnose Trout' (aka a Sucker). We boat another 25 or so and head for the bunks. We arrive back at our outpost cabin at about 10:30, and it's dark .as we're walking up the beach our headlamps review a string of garbage, heading down the beach. A bit confused, I walk over to the fish house where I had put the garbage before we left, to find the door of it ripped up and broken thru. Bears. O-Tay! I'm heading inside double time .and for the rest of the night we would look twice on the porch before heading out for a leak! The next AM we investigate further .one big set of bear prints and 2 or 3 small sets. They broke right thru the door and dragged a 30 or 40 lb bag of garbage 50 or 60 yards into the bush! The Mullens had never had a single bear incident prior to this, since 1989! It made for an exciting conclusion to our best trip yet. Hats off to the entire crew: JJ, Bob, Dave, Dave, Wally, Willy and Cap'n Rob(future host of RW's Canadian Adventures). Special thanks to Dave for doing all the shopping. To the Mullen's family, many thanks for the hospitality and great service! Key learnings for me in 2008:  Fish where they are biting a few degrees in temperature made all the difference  Lead colored bottom bouncers all the way  The wise man positions boat next to honey pot first Cheers, Kevin"
1266116,triad12315,2011-01-29 19:00:00,1,"Sounds like you guys had an amazing trip. We are planning a trip back up there towards the end of this July. I was wondering if you could give me some pointers on baits to use and where to fish, especially for the eyes, we made the trip two years ago and concentrated more on pike, but this time we were looking to get a little more involved with some walleye. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."
1308915,Guest,2011-05-19 08:33:00,0,"Hey Kevin Hope my note makes it to you... Really enjoyed reading about your 2008 fishing trip to Ogascannan. As it happens we are booked to stay at Smiths Pass this June. Your stoy gave me goose bumps! Can't wait to get there. Any tips on honey holes near the cabin (or otherwise). Plan to fish Walleye and Lakers. Our destination for 12 years was Lake Dumoine and we always did exceptionally well, but this year decided it was time for a change... Cheers!"
4674874,Ira,2016-03-26 16:41:00,6,"Kevin - Excellent story. I'm hoping to be able to write a similar one after out trip at the end of June. We'll be at the Island Outpost for a 4-day trip. New to walleye & pike fishing (any fishing, for that matter). If you have any other pointers you could share, I love to hear them."
