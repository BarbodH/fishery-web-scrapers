4470738,Bergy,2016-01-20 14:53:00,83,"Wondering if there is a good way to get ahold of Mahkwa Lodge? I have tried emailing and calling several times. Anyone familiar with their dock system and how protected it is? I am fussy with my boat and don't want waves banging it into the dock. Also, any recommendations for which cabins are nicer? Looking for my family of 4 and possibly another family of 4. Recomendations for all of us together or two smaller cabins appreciated."
4471378,Pooch,2016-01-20 17:54:00,4619,"Mahkwa can sometimes be slow to respond to inquiries. Just keep trying them.Docks are mostly new within the past couple years. No more or no less protected than other camps. Bring your bumpers if you have them to any camp you fish. I have seen the bay where Mahkwa is located get really rough in high winds. Just a matter of having your boat tied up facing the right direction if the weather turns crap.Cabins are just your regular basic fishing camp cabins on the housekeeping side. Couple of really nice cabins on the American Plan side of the camp. There are a few really old small cabins on the housekeeping side that I'd try to avoid with my family. OK for ""the guys"", but my wife wouldn't be happy in them. I think all have indoor plumbing, which is a plus. Good drinking water on the housekeeping side, too. There are several newer small housekeeping cabins near the docks that look pretty good, but I've not seen the inside of them. Remember, it's a fishing camp. Our guys go to fish.People running the camp are good folks. Fuel and bait is fairly priced at the service center.Here are couple pictures of the docks on last falls trip. They are not that clear after I posted them here on WC. If you want a little sharper picture email me and I'll resend them to you at your email address. These are the housekeeping side docks. Docks on American side are more protected and tucked in tighter to shore.Pooch"
4476186,JDP,2016-01-22 08:24:00,1457,"I echo Pooch's comments 100%.Bring your own ropes and bumpers.Write your name on the bumpers if you leave them at the dock.I have been going to Mahkwa Lodge since 2005 with my boat each year,I have never had any damage to my boat using the dock system.I understand that there is new fish cleaning house since I was at Mahkwa last June/July.Apparently the new fish cleaning house is located at the end of the dock in the first picture below.I have attached a couple more pictures of the docks. This set of docks was new in 2015.These are the docks more in the background of Pooch's pictures.I exchanged e-mails with Mahkwa Lodge today.Direct your phone calls and e-mails to Eugene Capay.Eugene has been very helpful to me in the last 3 weeks.Evelyn no longer works at Mahkwa.Mahkwa Lodge Phone: 807-582-3443Mahkwa Lodge e-mail: [email protected]P.S. The Mahkwa Lodge website is down.I do not know why."
4476250,tv4fish,2016-01-22 08:41:00,2694,It does look like they have improved the place.
4503689,NLpike,2016-01-31 23:15:00,28,"Oh that is awesome. That woman was 90% of the problem at Mahkwa. Eugene is a very nice and responsive person, when you can contact him. The new docks look amazing. I guess the rumor that the board was going to shut the place down was wrong. Now they just need to burn about a dozen cabins to the ground and rebuild, should take about 10 years at the pace they move. Really, they could just buy prefab cottages and be done in one season. We will stop by this year to check them out. We stopped going there after a very bad episode with Evelyn and a cottage that was falling apart. Nice to see some positive changes."
4523689,Woollybob,2016-02-07 09:43:00,158,Mahkwa's website is back up. And so are their prices...
4526737,Pooch,2016-02-08 10:00:00,4619,The link to Mahkwa isn't working. Might be web work in progress? Face book page has lot of interesting stuff. Good reading.Pooch
4527233,JDP,2016-02-08 12:01:00,1457,"Link to Mahkwa Lodge Website:http://www.mahkwa.ca/Mahkwa's housekeeping rates for 2016 are the same as in 2014 and 2015.You will see the website states ""2014 Rates"". The rate for my cabin this summer is the 2014 rate, as posted on the website."
4676346,Timing,2016-03-27 08:13:00,95,"This is resort for fishing, consider best location on the lake. We all know what is said about location. Definitely slow or do not return calls, however fishing is worth the hassle."
