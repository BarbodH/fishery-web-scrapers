Never found any per pound quantities advertised from any bait dealer. Not that it isn't a viable measurement,just never found anyone selling minnows by the pound.PjShorthorn."
4670346,north560,2016-03-25 07:00:00,53,If you purchase more than the allowed limit of minnows(10 doz) you must have a store receipt for the minnows to be legal.
4670410,Pooch,2016-03-25 07:35:00,4619,Local bait shop only sells by the pound or dozen quantities. I ran across this chart online.Pooch
4670762,pjshorthorn,2016-03-25 09:15:00,5654,Cool chart. Thanks for sharing. PjShorthorn.
4665081,Pooch,2016-03-23 18:29:00,4619,"I just stopped by our local bait shop and he quoted me $13 a pound for Fathead minnows 3-4"" long.Anyone have an idea of how many that size might be in a pound? I've been salting minnows I trap from a local stream, but as I get older this looks like a good option for our Canadian trips. I didn't want to hijack the salted minnow thread with this question.Pooch"
4665177,BornToFish,2016-03-23 18:47:00,1224,"Greetings Pooch, I've been salting fathead minnows the last several years. The local minnow wholesale/retail outlet has ""small"" and ""large"" fatheads. His ""large"" fatheads are not even close to 3-4 inches in length, as you mentioned in your original post. I'm thinking the ""large"" fatheads that I purchased are closer to two inches long. ""Large"" fatheads that I purchased in August tended to run 18 dozen per pound. The same ""large"" fatheads in June were 15 dozen per pound. I assume the fathead minnows in August contain young of the year minnows, thus bringing the average size down a bit. I used FishOil's method for salting - salt + borax. The fathead minnows start out pretty dark, and became much darker upon salting. They worked! I made the switch this year to salted emerald shiners, as the lake that I will be fishing has shiners as the forage base. These emerald shiners are running 2.5 - 3.5 inches in length. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4665217,Pooch,2016-03-23 18:54:00,4619,"Most of the minnows I trapped last year in a small creek on our farm are Dace. Forgot to take them with me.... figures. Anyone use Dace minnows in Canada? They are pretty little devils. They were all good sized, but threw them out when I got home from the last trip.Pooch"
4668057,bigwalleye1,2016-03-24 13:47:00,2632,"If it's what we call ""dace"" at home, got a pretty little red or yellow stripe on them. We see the occasional dace in our purchased live minnows in Canada, as kind of a mixed bag. I seek out the red stripe ones in the bucket."
4668145,Pooch,2016-03-24 14:01:00,4619,Don't think I've ever seen one in our minnow orders in Canada.Pooch
4668369,mickr,2016-03-24 14:59:00,74,in eastern ontario where I fish dace are by far the favourite minnow for walleye
4668625,eyemike,2016-03-24 15:45:00,233,Years back when it was legal for Americans to trap minnows in Canada pretty much all of the minnows that we trapped were dace. This was in the Nipigon area. Walleyes really enjoy eating them.
4669521,yoopertrout,2016-03-24 19:24:00,1172,Minnesota Bait told me 1200 fatheads to the pound. They might not have been quite as long as 3-4 inches though. Correction - that's 1200 to the gallon.
4669593,alberta bum,2016-03-24 19:36:00,312,"That would be 10 times the legal limit of minnows allowed to be possessed in Ontario, without a commercial bait dealers lic. Id hate too see what that fine would be...."
4669689,yoopertrout,2016-03-24 19:59:00,1172,"Geez, I was unaware of this rule. I certainly don't want to break the law. I checked the regs, and you are right. 120 minnows per person and 120 leeches per person. I wonder what the reason for this rule is? Also, why do outfitters offer to sell hundreds of minnows to customers? Why do I hear of people hauing pounds of leeches? Are people really only supposed to use 20 minnow (or leeches) per person per day on a six day trip??"
