This year, we want to return and would like to try a lake that contains both walleye and lake trout. Sand and Ducarney lakes seems to offer what we are looking for. I was told that sand lake can be very difficult depending on weather. I heard Ducarney is good for walleye, but unsure about lake trout. Anyone has fished these lakes? Any advice? Thanks"
