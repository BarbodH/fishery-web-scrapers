4665865,steve.a,2016-03-24 01:47:00,274,Does any one know why they lowered the perch limit to 15 from 50 a couple of years ago? It seems a drastic reduction. At the same time the crappie were reduced to 10. We had to throw back some crappie that would not live when fishing for walleye because we had our limit at the cabin. Eagles liked it though.

Used to be 100, they dropped it to 20/day 50 in possession. My recollection was that the size of the perch was falling off drastically, and lots of folks would come early, stay late, for a day, and bring 100 home without putting anything more into the local economy than a minnow purchase. This effectively either shut down the huge harvest or required at least an overnight stay to make a 40 fish total. Can't say if it was the driver for LOTW, but it may have been a factor."
4667017,steve.a,2016-03-24 09:15:00,274,Might be but it seems that they are getting bigger the last few years. I am not sure how many people keep them as I know of some that never keep any. They are sometimes a little wormy so that might be the case.
4668129,Obabikon,2016-03-24 13:58:00,2370,"I honestly think they lower limits just for the sake of lowering limits. The limits have helped a lot over the years, but the new one made no sense to me. Fish populations were as high as they've been in 40 years, and they still lowered them more."
4668857,steve.a,2016-03-24 16:27:00,274,"Obabikon, I think you are right. It shows that someone did something about something to show their worth."
4670282,Bill Krejca,2016-03-25 06:36:00,6107,Fish limit reductions are almost always the result of over-harvest. Bill
4673394,steve.a,2016-03-26 07:00:00,274,"Bill, do you think that it is the case with the perch and crappie. I heard from somebody that it might be to help with muskie forage."
