4655249,Thompmd,2016-03-21 06:29:00,320,"Just curious? I realize it will vary some from Camp/Camp but I'm retiring in early 2018 and would like to book something for a couple weeks in late June. My thought(s) are we would send a deposit now and it would work just as if we were booking this year. Lol I'm not asking about exchange rates or current rates, just wanting to book a trip and get the weeks/cabin we want as a retirement gift."
4655265,Obabikon,2016-03-21 06:34:00,2370,"I'm sure there are resorts out there that do. I personally don't do more than a year in advance. I give all my guests the first right of refusal. So, if they want to return next year, they can. But, they have to let me know when they check out to ensure they don't lose the dates."
4655441,octanehi5,2016-03-21 07:04:00,1104,"most outfitters in Canada give their people that were there the yr before first rights.What province you are looking at? The month of June is prime time,how many People"
4655545,Thompmd,2016-03-21 07:44:00,320,"Thanks for the replies, I have been to LOTW on several occasions and would definitely consider that again. I am also considering a fly-in as well as LS since I have never been there. In a lot of ways I'm pretty open. My thought(s) are it gives me something to look forward too but it also allows me to book as far in advance as possible. I understand I have to wait until the previous guests don't book when they leave. My concern is guest-X doesn't book and we book for a couple weeks and I send my deposit. I do not want moved around to a different cabin to accommodate someone if the previous guest wants to book at a later date. Our plan would be to return for those 2-weeks in the future. I assume that once I book those would be our 2-weeks until we no longer booked when we leave."
4655641,Golden Eagle,2016-03-21 08:19:00,2642,I suggest narrowing your choices down to about 3 camps and then pre-fishing each at least 2 weeks while you're waiting for retirement.
4655793,Thompmd,2016-03-21 08:59:00,320,"Excellent suggestion, this year our ""pre-fishing"" will be done in St Johns in the Caribbean. The beaches are incredible but the Smallmouth/Walleye fishing is horrible. VERY much looking fwd to retirement and working on the bucket list of trips I have read about my entire life but to do time have been unable to go. Actually want to plan a 2-week trip each year then also likely another week but it will be short notice like a fly-in or a species specific trip ie large northern or large smallmouth etc. The short-notice trip means reading/hearing about something, calling the resort(s) and see who has something available at that time. Some will work out and some will not. Also hope that the resort could even send me an email saying someone just cancelled due to an emergency and we are on our way"
4656177,HeHooksHimself,2016-03-21 10:33:00,725,"In my opinion, you have a lot of choices. You won't have much trouble finding a camp or resort that fits the bill for you within the year of your retirement. As I approach retirement, I have been fortunate to go once or twice a year. In the spring, we go to the same camp since the fishing is so good and we like the setup. In the fall, just my best fishing buddy (brother in law) and I try something new and different. To be honest, the fishing is always pretty good and when it isn't, it is because we haven't done a good job of learning how to fish that particular body of water. Honestly, it is really hard to be disappointed with any place we have ever been. There is literally something for everyone. Good luck with your retirement, I am only a couple years from it myself. Hooks"
4656305,Thompmd,2016-03-21 10:55:00,320,"Thanks, I agree. I wish I could tell you how many places/stories I have read over the years and quite a few I never got real serious since I knew I just didn't have the time available but soon we will. It will be nice for example in the fall when the big crappies are biting on LOTW/Rainy to be able to contact the owner and then take off. There will be certain times of the year when the timing won't work out but I think most times it will. The other good thing is not having to worry about how many days we have left before we have to leave as we envision if the fishing is real good being able to stay for a few more days. Good luck to you as well."
4656817,Baseline,2016-03-21 13:47:00,3207,"Trips for 3 seasons out may be difficult for some resorts or outfitters to accommodate. There are enough quality operators in northwestern Ontario that you shouldn't have much of a problem booking a trip a year or couple out. If there is one ""must go to"" body of water you are focused on then call the outfitter and make your deal."
