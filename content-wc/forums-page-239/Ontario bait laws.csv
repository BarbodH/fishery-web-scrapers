4673650,yoopertrout,2016-03-26 08:36:00,1172,Agreed.
4673666,yoopertrout,2016-03-26 08:37:00,1172,Thanks. Let us know.
4669713,yoopertrout,2016-03-24 20:03:00,1172,"Someone just pointed out on another thread, and I confirmed in the regs, that people are only allowed to possess 120 minnow and 120 leeches per person in Ontario. This makes me wonder: 1. Are we really only supposed to have 20 minnow per person per day for a six day trip? 2. Why do I hear of people taking multiple pounds of leeches? 3. Does this law apply to dead (salted minnows)? 4. Why do outfitters sell hundreds of minnows to fly out customers? 5. What's the reason for this law? Any thoughts? Thanks."
4669761,v-bay gord,2016-03-24 20:15:00,3168,Off the top of my head I believe those limits apply to residents catching their own baitfish. I think on commercially bought baitfish these limits do not apply. I could be wrong.
4669849,adempsey,2016-03-24 20:39:00,963,"Yes, that is correct Yoopertrout. The possession limit in Ontario is 120 live baitfish and 120 leeches, regardless of where they originated. It does not apply to dead bait.https://www.ontario.ca/page/fishing-live-bait#section-1I am sure there is ways around it. For example, one hypothetical could be that the outfitter flies in a lot of minnows but they are still under his possession and commercial license (?) until you actually take them from storage. As long as you only have 120 in your possession at any given point in time, you should be legal. Not saying that's true, just a possibility. Probably a grey area and the CO would likely be subjective about it. Or, maybe it's not strongly enforced unless it's obvious their is something 'fishy' (:P) going on?I think the law is there to protect those with a commercial bait license. Watch some of the videos from Clark's Resorts, they talk about their bait company in some of them. It's interesting. Possibly to protect over harvesting and the spread of VHS/invasive species as well.Not sure about pounds of leeches, but most of the time I read about that is people heading to Quebec."
4670698,yoopertrout,2016-03-25 08:48:00,1172,Thanks for the replies.
4671650,Bill Krejca,2016-03-25 13:59:00,6107,"Hmm... It is difficult for me to believe a bait dealer will refuse to sell a person more than 120 minnows. Maybe so, just seems rather unbelievable. So how do you count them. Bill"
4671674,prov1800,2016-03-25 14:10:00,5010,Your right gord.10 doz minnows for residents with a fishing license.Yoh can buy as many as you want from a dealer.just have the bill to prove it.
4671874,Candianblueboy,2016-03-25 14:58:00,189,I think they are saying that you can only have 120 minnows or leeches in the boat per person fishing and if there are more back at camp they should not be counted as they are not in possession while fishing.
4671962,3M TA3,2016-03-25 15:26:00,2846,Imagine trying to hold those buggers still so you could count them.
4673210,alberta bum,2016-03-26 05:34:00,312,"I've had a bait dealer absolutely come unglued on me for trying too buy more than 120 minnows from them.. He's had mnr sit outside his shop and check buckets of guys walking out the door. It states right in the rule,, caught or purchased 120 minnows is the limit. You are allowed too possess 120 minnows,, that means what's in your boat, what's at your cabin it mean the total of number you have. Live or dead. I'm sure most mnr officers would even look at it,, but if you get one of those newer guys that's having not such a great day......... You know,, just like a customs officer. I think a group of lodge owners should get together and ask the mnr about this one..."
4673338,Fisherman Ted,2016-03-26 06:42:00,461,"When I get to the lodge I will indeed ask my MNR guys this question. Seems a little odd. Especially when there are so many other issues they are dealing with. These guys are always excellent. They are understaffed and work exceptionally hard. In nearly every case they are polite, professional and care as much for our fisheries as we do. I'll let you know what they say. -FT"
