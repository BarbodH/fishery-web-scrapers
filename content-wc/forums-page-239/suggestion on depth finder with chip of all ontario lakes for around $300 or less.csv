4671514,CamoHunter,2016-03-25 13:14:00,363,"You could have a budget of $10,000, and you're still not going to find many Ontario lakes mapped. Unless you map it yourself. For the major mapping companies (Lakemaster & Navionics), there's much more demand, for many more lakes in the US to take care of first.I suggest saving all of your boat tracks/sonar data for any trip you make to Canada, so that you can import that data into mapping software at some point."
4626441,Guest,2016-03-10 13:42:00,0,fellow fishermen our depthfinder is 20 years old and want to upgrade to a new one with chip of all Ontario lakes could we purchase this package for $300 or under appreciate any suggestions or comments jim wolf Chicago boys
4626809,ftfarms,2016-03-10 15:26:00,444,Most chips are $150-$200 so that don't leave much room for the depth finder.
4627057,kzoofisher,2016-03-10 17:09:00,5144,Let me know when you find one with all Ontario lakes on it. My lake is paper map only.
4627697,1/4 oz Jig,2016-03-10 21:03:00,90,Just got a flyer from Cabelas and they are having a doorbuster on the Garmin 53dv unit for $279.99 this saturday from 8am-1pm. I would get there as close to 8 as you can if you want one. It comes with they're lakevu hd mapping. Should include lakes in Canada but like all chips you won't find one with every lake on it. Some lakes should have 1' contour lines some might have 10' some might show just the shoreline. Usually this unit is $499. It''s a great deal.
4627721,Guest,2016-03-10 21:12:00,0,"Good luck finding finding a chop with most Northern Ontario lakes. WOTW, Lac Suel, Lake St. Joe may be there, but other lakes north or the rail line, unlikely. Sorry for the news."
4627785,youngknight,2016-03-10 21:39:00,228,"Great price on the Garmin but don't expect much in terms of Ontario lakes. The ""3"" in 53 indicates inland US lakes. I recently purchased the 75 dv. I live in Ontario...the '5"" in 75 means inland Canada lakes...so expect you would need the 55 model to get same."
4627793,youngknight,2016-03-10 21:43:00,228,"A comment. There are thousands of lakes in Ontario and most have no mapping info other than the lake itself...ie. No depths. So, buy yourself that new Garmin 53dv and then buy then navionics app for your phone for $15 or so. Just a thought."
4628385,Obabikon,2016-03-11 07:26:00,2370,"Lowrance Elite 4's...http://www.westmarine.com/buy/lowran...tyGxoCbA3w_wcB Includes an insight pro chip. That won't be ""all"" of Ontario, but it'll cover a lot for sure. Especially since most lakes in Ontario aren't even plotted."
4630201,P&y only,2016-03-11 18:32:00,133,Good luck finding that chip. Lowrance with an sd card in it will make you a map as you drive around.
4631129,Guest,2016-03-12 06:39:00,0,"fellow fishermen thanks for all your inputs we have decided on lowrance hook #4 with insight pro chip (will have many lakes in Canada ) the best for the price much better than the 20 yr old technology we have now you guys were right talking to lowrance no one chip has ""all lakes in Canada"" for the price the best we are going to do jim wolf Chicago boys"
