However this area has many grocery stores all competing against each other for the business. I watch the sales and have no problem shopping several stores on my way home from work for the best price & selection. We eat quite well on the trip and everyone seems to enjoy the meals I plan. Haven't had to ask for an increase in the $ amount person in several years. The Safeway store in Fort Frances is nice and the Walmart in Dryden is OK but I feel the prices are better for us buying most everything locally. We also save time by buying just our eggs in Canada - grocery stores on a Saturday morning are just too crowded for me. We do put money into the Canadian economy by buying: 1. Cigars 2. Beer 3. Gas 4. Breakfasts 5. Malkin Jam!!!!
4684866,Moondog,2016-03-29 16:07:00,362,I am sure you have noticed that Malkin Jam isn't what it used to be!!!! Company sold out a few years back and now called Canadian or Canada Jam. We no longer buy it ......not nearly as tasty.
4687394,JDP,2016-03-30 10:48:00,1457,"I have a group of 9 people.We plan our Menu, 3 meals per day for 7 days.I shop for food and other supplies at home in the weeks leading up to the trip.I spend several hundred dollars each year.Everything is packed the day before we leave.We have found numerous issues when we purchase items in Fort Frances or Dryden, including time in the grocery store spent, out-of-stocks, etc.So we limit our shopping to banned (eggs, etc.) and other items in Dryden on our way.This works for us, your mileage may vary."
4689346,Guest,2016-03-30 19:36:00,0,Like the web site said. 4 kilo's per person. Our group of 8 bring 60 pounds and never have a problem.
4689866,Bobby Winds,2016-03-31 03:11:00,10817,For potatoes try the CANNED potatoes (4 lb can) from Sam's Club. They are white little potatoes that are already peeled and cooked and they are FANTASTIC for making home fries cut into small squares or just left whole and sauteed in butter and garlic for dinner. Our guys LOVE them and prefer them over fresh potatoes when we go to fishing or deer camp. Plus they save a LOT of prep time and cooking time.
4637577,strength22,2016-03-14 19:57:00,49,I love this! Exactly. So so so much easier....and we have done it both ways. Man am I glad we don't haul all that food and drink up. Such a hassle and waste of time.
4637897,Pooch,2016-03-15 05:37:00,4619,"Over the years our group(s) have bought most of our food in the states, but for fresh foods and other times we have bought most in Canada. So here are my rambling thoughts FWIW.I (personally) prefer to now buy our canned and staple foods in the states and have them compactly packed into a Rubbermaid tub and packed away in the truck with other gear before we leave home. Makes packing so much easier than throwing a dozen plastic bags of food into the back of the truck at the Safeway on the Canadian side. Then having to deal with a bunch of bags unpacking at camp. Especially on a fly in.Standing around in a parking lot trying to repack from plastic bags into a tub seems so cumbersome. When doing it at home gives one time to rethink and make everything fit to conserve space. Seems like when we used to buy a lot in Canada it was raining or we were running late and it was a cluster ****. Then we always had impulse items that really messed up packing, too. Now we pretty much just buy banned items, bread, fresh fruits, etc. on the Canadian side and plan ahead for stores that we know will be open and when.Another thing that taints my thinking is that a couple times stores were not open when we crossed and had to stop several times at small stores en-route trying to fill in what we could not find at the last little store. Once wife and I got caught looking for our food supply on the bank holiday. That was a burden driving around TB and other towns looking for staples and added hours onto an already long drive.Just some thoughts from my experiences over the years. Everyone has a system of some sort. Our group is kind of anal about planning so that explains a lot......Pooch"
4638449,strength22,2016-03-15 08:38:00,49,True statements....when gramps and the old man was alive and we would go it was a 365 day planned trip!!! huge group as well..10 -15 usually. So planning was important and buying things here and man was it a process and taken seriuolsy. Gramps had more grocery lists than you could imagine and **** did we eat well. Now the group is like 4 or 5 at the most....so 3 guys stopping at a store in canada is about as easy as it gets and we all fit in 1 truck. So alot of that is part of it too....either way...fishing in canada....nothing better.
4638969,oleJoe,2016-03-15 12:50:00,114,"We go with usually 6 and sometimes 8 people and I,m retired now. So I purchase the provisions. It a year long process with me. We buy everything in the states except the ban products. We get them when we exchange our money. The only problem we have is space in the van that we rent but so far its all fit. mmmmm tight at times but we got it. The one time we bought potatoes in Canada and then flew in, we found some rotten ones. We usually don't take in extra food in and bring very little out. Saying that I enjoy doing the planning of it. I always take towels and sponges for the boats, a can opener, grease splatter screen to filter the oil or if the fish fryers goes out to do them in a skillet. Also alu foil to cover the stove with. Sooo much easier cleaning it when you leave. But to each their own. People enjoy their trips in different ways. I like the peace and wildlife that you see, also the fish you catch and consume. Its coming close and just went over the list again today. Just enjoy it!!"
4679562,Bobby Winds,2016-03-28 09:38:00,10817,So I guess the Canadians can no longer get real Colonel Sander Kentucky Fried Chicken.......
4679978,tv4fish,2016-03-28 11:09:00,2694,We can't even get HIM...........
4680306,Shellback,2016-03-28 12:05:00,8083,"I go to Gananoque, Ontario twice a year for 2 weeks. The Dairy Queen in town only has vanilla. No chocolate, no twist! What's up with that? Is chocolate a banned substance?"
4684050,Mark R,2016-03-29 12:22:00,1538,The exchange rate being what it is u probably save $$ buying in Canada
4684314,Bobby Winds,2016-03-29 13:29:00,10817,"Actually, Canadian made ice cream is MUCH better then ours because it has a higher fat content........at least it did years ago..."
4684330,Bobby Winds,2016-03-29 13:30:00,10817,Never ! ! !
4613993,ILScott,2016-03-06 19:58:00,139,I know potatoes are banned but I read you can't bring in poultry and eggs. If poultry is cooked can it be brought in? Is their anything else that I can't bring up this year.
4614041,v-bay gord,2016-03-06 20:09:00,3168,www.inspection.gc.ca
4614057,Stringbean,2016-03-06 20:09:00,279,There are only 3 states listed on the official notice from the Canadian government. Here is a link to the page: http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/.../1421341727507
4614137,btyreprich,2016-03-06 20:47:00,1067,"Thanks V-Bay Gord for the link to Canadian customs. Interesting reading about the poultry and potatoes which makes up a good portion of the groceries I buy for our group. As we don't live in one of the 3 mentioned states, I guess it would be OK for me to buy our eggs and poultry locally and keep the receipts as proof. Just the same, I don't think it worth the bother. Going to once again buy our poultry items in Fort France's when we cross the border. I have heard about the ban on potatoes as well. Border guard said that ban applies to "" home grown"" potatoes and that if we have our commercially packed potatoes in a bag as it came from the store, there is no problem."
4616081,Baseline,2016-03-07 12:26:00,3207,"I'm not sure where you are crossing, but I just crossed at I-Falls, MN into Fort Francis. Potatoes are OK. Eggs are Not. We were specifically asked about eggs and raw poultry. No mention was made of specific states, just that eggs and raw poultry were not allowed. Potatoes were banned for a couple years, but have been acceptable for the last 2 or 3 years. No mention is made about potatoes. I would call the border station where you are going to cross and ask them directly."
4617161,campchick,2016-03-07 17:29:00,96,"I spoke to a Customs agent yesterday about this very topic. He informed me that eggs and raw poultry were not allowed to cross the border if they were purchased in North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana. Say,for example, a person showed up at the border with these products and a sales slip from another state. This would not be OK because you have to prove that the eggs,poultry were raised in that state as well and that would be difficult to do. Better solution is to purchase the products in Canada. Just sayin..."
4617273,btyreprich,2016-03-07 18:06:00,1067,"Egg cartons often say where the eggs are sourced from. Cannot say the same about chicken breasts and other parts. With that being said, I agree it's best to buy all poultry in Canada for the immediate future so as to avoid problems when crossing the border."
4617281,strength22,2016-03-07 18:09:00,49,"Just buy food up there....so much less of a hassle and also support local business in canada. We use to pack all our food and coolers and was such a pain. Now we throw a bag of clothes and some poles and small tackle in the truck and roll. I can pack for canada in 20 minutes and be on the road. We,hit the store in red lake which takes 30 minutes, stop for beer and rum takes 15 minutes and roll to camp. Easy life."
4617289,Obabikon,2016-03-07 18:12:00,2370,"Just double checking... but POTATOES are still perfectly legal to bring across, right? They lifted that ban a couple years ago, I have not heard anything about them reinstating it."
4617313,WalleyeMatt,2016-03-07 18:29:00,93,"We pack our clothes, poles and boat. Everything else is purchased in Canada. To save a couple of bucks is not worth the hassle to haul all that stuff up. Stop at Safeway in Dryden, 30 min and done. Besides, spread the wealth. Matt"
