4660129,Old Timer,2016-03-22 14:17:00,255,"Salted minnows work fine hanging on a hook. If you're sitting on the right hole any kind of fish meat will do wonders. In years past I've used gullet, eyeball and fish belly. Because I don't want to bother with the fine print anymore, I now stick to conventional bait - live or salted."
4660433,BornToFish,2016-03-22 15:08:00,1224,"Shiner minnows are a seasonal item in north east Wisconsin. Many bait dealers told me that these minnows are not very tolerant of warm water. Thus, mortality is very high when it's remotely warm. In my recent search for emerald shiners, one bait dealer told me that he discontinued handling them already this season due to mortality. The bait dealers tell me that they carry emerald shiners from late autumn through middle of spring. The bait dealers do not carry them from mid-spring through autumn. Thus, you might need to order salted emerald shiners from MBT during the autumn through end of winter time frame. Kindest regards....."
4664937,yoopertrout,2016-03-23 18:03:00,1172,I've only tried the fatheads so far.
4664977,yoopertrout,2016-03-23 18:05:00,1172,"True, I should have said iced. They weren't frozen solid."
4666233,Flag Island,2016-03-24 06:45:00,32,"I have been using the frozen fatheads for several years from MBT. I will not be using them again as the minnows are very small, and the last two batches I received would not stay on the hook. I was very disappointed in them. I suggest doing a little work and salting them yourself."
4666433,eyedrvm,2016-03-24 07:41:00,48,"Flag Island, Why do you think the last 2 batches were not as good? Not enough salting?"
4653817,yoopertrout,2016-03-20 14:44:00,1172,"When I go to Canada, I buy salted minnows from Minnesota Bait and Tackle. They are $55.00 per gallon for fatheads, and a gallon is about 1200 minnows. This is way cheaper than live minnows in Canada or the U.S. They salt them, freeze them, and ship them to you in a styrafoam cooler. They work great.http://minnesotabaitandtackle.com/"
4653913,Pooch,2016-03-20 15:17:00,4619,"You say they freeze them? Do the minnows tend to get ""mushy"" once they thaw out. Or, does the salt keep them from freezing solid?Pooch"
4654009,yoopertrout,2016-03-20 15:52:00,1172,"They weren't as solid as live minnows, but they held up really well. I've never used salted but unfrozen minnows so I can't really compare to them. We didn't find that we were losing many though."
4654625,eyedrvm,2016-03-20 20:01:00,48,I have practiced salting a few batches as I plan on doing a bunch before we leave for canada in early june. I liked the batch that I brined alive. Then put in salt borax over nite rinsed off and bagged up. The brining alive was few cups of salt in a bucket of cold water. They survived longer than I thought 24 hours plus. If they are not rinsed they dehydrate/shrivel up to much I think.
4655833,Joek3,2016-03-21 09:08:00,244,Yopper - checked out the link. Do you always buy the fatheads? Have you tried the medium or large shiners in Canada? Has anyone?
4655945,BornToFish,2016-03-21 09:44:00,1224,"I've been fishing two lakes in NW Ontario for the last fifteen years or so. The lake that I have fished the most has perch as the forage base. There are also ciscoes and various species of small minnows - but not shiners. The lodge sells live minnows that are similar to fatheads. These work very well. I have done okay with salted fatheads in this lake. I started fishing a new lake last season. This lake has emerald shiners and spot-tail shiners as the forage base. The adult shiner minnows are about three inches long. The lodge has frozen shiner minnows as a ""live"" bait. These work very well. I've noticed that it's a tougher sell to peddle a salted fathead minnow - but it can be done. It seems to me as though the walleye in this lake know what they are looking for and might be a little reluctant to take something else. I'm not sure if the walleye's preference is driven by color (silver of the shiners versus dark color of the fatheads), size (three plus inches for the shiners versus less than two inches for the fatheads) or profile (shiners are ""taller"" than the fatheads). It might be all three factors taken together? I revived this thread as I purchased several pounds of large shiner minnows from a nearby minnow wholesale operation. I am interested in seeing if salted emerald shiners out-perform the salted fatheads in this newer lake. I'm suggesting that your choice in salted minnow might be driven by ""match the hatch"" for whatever the forage base might be in your lake of choice. That's where I put my money this season! Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4656201,Joek3,2016-03-21 10:40:00,244,Your match the hatch comment is most likely spot on. Good info.
4657497,michigan walleye guy,2016-03-21 17:01:00,95,"In 3 years of buying the salted fatheads from MBT, I have yet to have found the shiners available. My guess is that they sell out very quickly, and so are rarely available online. But I could be wrong. Regarding the fatheads, they are fairly hardy and will last out the trip. The downside? They are extremely small, in my opinion. I use them with a fuzzy grub type jig so that the presentation has more ""bulk."" The VMC tinsel jigs are also excellent, but pricey."
4658609,Joek3,2016-03-22 04:09:00,244,Do you guys keep the leftover minnows and re freeze for future use ? (The ones from Minnesota bait and tackle). How long do they keep?
4659257,michigan walleye guy,2016-03-22 09:00:00,95,"Since MBT ships your order in several vacuum sealed bags, it is easy to just use one bag at a time and take the unused minnows home. I have used them for several months after with no ill effects. If there are any unused minnows (in an opened bag), I just usually ask the next group in if they want them, and the answer is yes. If not, I don't take them back. Also, I have actually never gotten ""frozen"" minnows from MBT; they pack the vacuum sealed bags in either ice or dry ice, depending on the shipping length. Then I just keep them refrigerated."
2053370,Fishoil,2013-08-23 20:55:00,1277,The fatheads I get average about 180 minnows per pound. I usually get 2 pounds per person for a week and have minnows left over. If you're worried about running out just get a couple extra pounds. When you compare the cost of getting them stateside and salting vs. buying live ones in Canada you won't even feel bad about throwing away the extras.
2053658,BornToFish,2013-08-24 06:04:00,1224,"FishOil,Many thanks for the very helpful inforamtion. I just noticed that you are from Freedom, WI. I live in nearby Appleton. Where do you buy your fathead minnows? My local sporting goods store is not keeping minnows in stock right now due to the warm weather and most anglers using other live baits at this time. I'm willing to make the drive to pick up some minnows in advance of my upcoming trip to NW Ontario. My lodge owner is presently charing $0.45 per minnow, and his price is very competitive with others in that area. Again, many thanks...."

2057650,roscoe33,2013-08-25 22:42:00,653,"So you don't leave them coated in salt? When I salt mine, I throw them out in the sun on a piece of plywood, let them there until they are dry on the outside, (about 30 minutes), then I throw them in a gallon ziplock with the salt - just enough to coat them, and store them in the fridge."
4653513,BornToFish,2016-03-20 12:16:00,1224,"FishOil, I've been using your recipe for the last several years to salt minnows. I tried something a bit different this spring. I would like to hear your thoughts as maybe you already tried this. I switched to large emerald shiner minnows rather than fatheads. I put about one pound of minnows in the one gallon ziplock bag with two cups of canning/pickling salt and one cup of borax. After twenty four hours in the refrigerator, the salt became a slurry. I poured out the slurry, leaving the minnows in the bag. I added another two cups of salt and one cup of borax. I returned the bag of minnows to the refrigerator for another twenty four hours. After a total of forty eight hours in the refrigerator, the salt and borax in most bags was a slightly damp powder. I dumped the contents of each bag into a colander and shook off the salt and borax. I put the minnows on a large sheet of cardboard for one to two hours, to finish drying. I put the minnows back in the colander to remove additional salt. The minnows were essentially, but not completely salt free. The next step is where I would appreciate your perspective. I put about fifty or so minnows in one pint plastic bags and vacuum sealed each bag. I will keep them in the refrigerator until our trip to Ontario. We will take out one or two sealed bags each morning, along with other bait. Your thoughts? Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4653601,MikeG1,2016-03-20 12:59:00,434,"Try rehydrating the minnows in Gulp Alive recharge liquid, or the liquid remaining in a container of gulp alive. Works."
4653729,Fishoil,2016-03-20 14:13:00,1277,I tried vacuum packing some of my leftovers last year. I put one pack in the freezer and left one pack on my workbench. The ones on the workbench turned to mush and I threw them out. I haven't thawed the ones in the freezer yet. I normally leave them in the fridge in a bucket all summer and they remain useable until I get sick of looking at them in fall so probably won't bother vacuum packing them. Hopefully it'll work out better for you than it did for me by just refrigerating them.
4653745,Pooch,2016-03-20 14:20:00,4619,"One of our fall LS trips guys uses fresh salted minnows exclusively and probably out fishes everyone else in our group. Granted he is a good jig fisherman, but still there is a pattern there! Now many of the group fish fresh salted minnows as they are a lot cheaper and easier to tend than buying fresh and trying to maintain them for a week.Don't freeze them. Even salted it seems to make them soft.Just our experience.Pooch"
4653793,yoopertrout,2016-03-20 14:38:00,1172,"I've used them when twister tails alone aren't enough, and they worked as well as live minnows."
2036954,Fishoil,2013-08-17 19:43:00,1277,"I thought I'd start a new thread for this since people are always asking and this should make it easy to find with a search.I've been doing them this way for several years and they keep for months if properly done and refrigerated (NOT frozen).Take a 1 gallon Ziplock bag and add 2 cups of pickling/canning salt and 1 cup of Borax (available at your local grocery store near the laundry soap). Now add about 1 pound of live minnows. Shake them up so that they all get coated well. Put the bag in your refrigerator for 24 hours.The next day dump the minnows out in a sink. Grab a handful at a time and rinse them under cold running water, shake all water off and put them in an ice cream bucket. When you get all done dump the bucket back in the sink and then put the minnows back in it. The idea is to get rid of any excess moisture, if you have liquid in the bucket the minnows won't last. Now put the bucket in the refrigerator until you need the minnows. Keep them cold, not frozen, and they will last for a long time."
2037426,fishinnut 3446,2013-08-18 08:04:00,638,"Thanks Fishoil,Will have to give that a try, Local bait shop gives me a very generous minnow count and maybe that's why some of us BH when we get 12 in a dozen ?"
2051026,BornToFish,2013-08-22 20:52:00,1224,"Thanks for the voluntary posting! I'm thinking about giving this a try when I leave for Ontario in three weeks. Two questions for you. Do they work for walleyes? This might sound like a funny question. I've seen times when the walleye bite is particularly strong, such that they will eat anything (leeches, crawlers, minnows or gulp type baits) and other times it has to be the one thing (which is most often a live minnow). I'm just wondering if they are likely to work well enough vertical jigging for walleyes to be worth the hassle of salting them.My second question is about the texture of salted minnows. Does the salting process change their texture? For example, do they get mushy? I'm wondering if they will fall of the hook when vertical jigging.Many thanks for your thoughts on the above."
2051674,Lovetofish,2013-08-23 07:47:00,458,I'll add this. Keep your salties in your cooler if it's hot out. I bring smaller zip bags each day and take a handful at a time and put them in a small platic container with lake water. Cleans and re-hydrates them and you don't get salt in the cuts in your hands or on your fishing gear. The minnows will not be mushy or fall off your hook. Been using these minnows exclusively for many years. Good luck.
2051690,Gregking,2013-08-23 08:04:00,2658,I need to try this
2051810,tooski,2013-08-23 08:29:00,393,That's really interesting. Never crossed my mind to put them back in water to re-hydrate them. You say they don't get mushy? I'm going to try it on Lake Erie for perch this fall. Thanks again for the tip.
2052090,Fishoil,2013-08-23 09:46:00,1277,"What Lovetofish said. I usually just use twister tails but there are times when the walleyes just don't want them enough. That's when I put a salted minnow on and start catching fish. The rest of the group I fish with uses them exclusively, no other live or dead bait, and we all catch plenty of walleyes. (Almost as many as Lovetofish)Be sure to keep them cool, if you leave them out in the hot sun they will get soft. They can also get mushy if you allow them to freeze. If you keep them cool they will last a long time. I have some in my refrigerator that I salted almost 3 months ago that will be taking a ride to Canada with me this weekend and they look as good as when I first made them up."
2052682,skap,2013-08-23 14:11:00,58,"Thanks for the advice everyone on this topic, always wanted to try it. Had one question. Is there a specific type or size of minnow that works better for this process? I am leaving next week for Minnitaki and thought I would give this a shot. I guess just to experiment if nothing else.Thanks again and good luck on the water!!!"
2052786,Lovetofish,2013-08-23 15:19:00,458,I use fatheads simply because that's all I have available.
2053258,BornToFish,2013-08-23 19:50:00,1224,I would like to try salting some minnows for an upcoming trip to NW Ontario. I will order some minnows from a local bait shop. I'm curious as to how many dozen minnows are in a pound of average size fatheads. Any thoughts on this? Many thanks....
