You can find them from the west end to the east end, I'm on the west end but would have to say the east end is better, not in terms of numbers but in terms of the bite, the fish on the east end are way more carefree and frisky and will zoom up to take your bait while my local piscatorial targets take a little more encouragement to commit if ya know what I mean. The east enders are to be found in 25'FOW and the west end boys (and girls) I have found so far are in 35'FOW .its all catch and keep this end as they don't survive the bends coming from deep so quick. I started fishing them with micro jigs and minnows but by accident discovered they liked the bigger 3/8 Oz jigs by far weird .especially in metallic blue/silver. You have to use a very light rod as the bite is almost undetectable except for the random big aggressive fish. Slip bobbers also work as do large blue/silver Lindy style spoons tipped with a minnow head. Anyway, have a little video to share with you of my last outing about 5 mins away from our home... ..hope you enjoy.VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/5MnMsFo-nmM"

4666249,Skywagon,2016-03-24 06:51:00,1106,"Crappie seem to be everywhere in the Wabigoon chain of lakes, all the way too and including the Wabigoon river that enters Dinorwic lake from the east. Crappie tend to stunt after the initial introduction to a lake in the south, wonder if the same thing will happen here? They are a novelty now, but another species in the system eating walleye fry cannot be a positive thing. Seems to be a lot of speculation on how crappie mysteriously showed up into the Wabigoon system in the last 1/2 dozen years, in my opinion, too bad they did."
4666345,prov1800,2016-03-24 07:19:00,5010,"Seems like it was a planned introduction as all of a sudden a number of lakes started off with some accidental catches.Not sure what or if any harm will come from them.Although if you look at lake of the woods which has had crappies in it as long as i can remember doesnt seem to be showing any ill effects.There a welcome addition with me.I enjoy being able to catch them all season.Not sure abouf thd stunting, where i fish for them have not caught lot of small fish just the odd ones mostly anywhere from 8-10""with some reaching 14"" action is nuts and gets boring and not much of a fight.If there not natural to some lakes iam surprised there is a limit on them.15 in some areas and 10 in others.Weird.like there trying to control them."
4666545,v-bay gord,2016-03-24 08:04:00,3168,"Good point about the mortality issue pulling them out of deep water. I've been told they will swim down the hole and then float up under the ice. That would be a real waste, especially if you're releasing a bunch."
4666753,SeulAreaWalleye,2016-03-24 08:30:00,100,"Being in Sioux Lookout, I personally love having this option in a lake less than an hr away. Fort Frances was too far to go fish for table fare. Not good for other species in the lake, but great for anglers looking for a delicious fish fry."
4666865,prov1800,2016-03-24 08:49:00,5010,Theres always a mortality rate when you fish deep.I personallg dont fish beyond 25'.Its not hard finding deep fish so most people target them.If iam guiding or just going for pleasure iam not going to sacrifice a bunch of fish just because they are easy.I know where there are ceappies in a number of spots but dont fish them unless iam just going to keep what ever comes up.Id rather fish them in the 18-22' range.I have found spots where they hold in that depth all winter and find them there in mid to late summer also..I hear of guys ice fishing 40 ft.for walleyes thats just stupid.any slot or over sized fish that go back are goners.Dont understand why people do that.Definatly not conservation minded and no respect.
4670338,Bill Krejca,2016-03-25 06:59:00,6107,"Limey - Thanks for the video. I believe the reason you mentioned for having better luck with the heavier jig is that it is much easier to feel the bite, the line being more straightened out, than when using a very light jig. Also, thanks again for reminding folks that the death rate is close to 100% on the deep caught fish, so not keeping is not an option. As I have mentioned in past posts, on soft water deep catches, the life rate can be increased by giving the fish a flip upon releasing. Those caught deeper than about 22 feet do not stand a good chance of survival. Fish displaying extruded intestines do not generally survive. Depth survival seems to vary a bit from day to day, depending, I think, on the ambient air pressure. Not being a scientist, this is only a guess on my part, however, I have noticed there being a difference on a day-to-day-basis. Again, thanks for the video. Bill"
4670354,elkman99,2016-03-25 07:00:00,180,"Living in Crappie country all my life, the only time that they have issues with becoming stunted is in low acreage lakes/ponds (less than couple hundred acres), where there is an issue with food, or lack of predators. I don't foresee any of those as an issue with shield lakes."
4671642,115 optimax,2016-03-25 13:58:00,650,We hammered the Crappie on the Wabigoon Cain Of Lakes yesterday.We caught all of them between 20ft-25ft of water.We were on a scouting mission for an up coming taping of Gillespie's Water & Woods.Should be a good show..
