4640033,ftfarms,2016-03-15 19:43:00,444,"I like glow jig head white or rainbow. And love parrot colored jigs. All with live bait or uncle josh worms. Bottom bouncers with spinner harnesses in pink,white,gold or chartreuse orange. I also like lindy rigs with a phelps floater and live bait. I like blue white and chartreuse orange and chartreuse blue floater colors."
4641385,HeHooksHimself,2016-03-16 08:55:00,725,"As Moss from Woman River Camp once told me, ""You need some bump."" Helicopter jigs or bladed jigs work best for me. Chartruese and orange are my go to colors."
4641793,Old Timer,2016-03-16 10:39:00,255,"If I was going to pick one color, it would be chartreuse. That goes for jigs, spinner blades and Phelps floaters. Plastic tails would be yellow and white. Bait is always better than plastic and plugs. Sure, there are days when the fish will jump all over rapalas and plastics. But day in and day out I'd stick with bait, live or salted."

4649857,Bushman74,2016-03-19 05:37:00,8,My first fly in was last August. No prior experience with stained water. The top producers were 1/4 oz jig heads with a crawler in pink and in white. Green came in at third. We caught them on other things as well like crawler harness's and spoons but nothing beats that jig drifted over a drop-off or bump on the bottom. We only used crawlers as keeping minnows alive in August can be tricky at best. As luck would have it was almost 90 degrees that week. They still slammed the jigs.
4656993,bullhockey,2016-03-21 14:33:00,41,"bushman, how deep were you fishing the jigs??? really appreciate the info. actually, we,'ve been goihg up there since the mid 60's. my sons for the last 10 yrs. started going out of hawk junction, then wawa, white river, nakina, armstrong. now back to white river. been opn some unbelievable lakes over the years. again, thanks for the info.
