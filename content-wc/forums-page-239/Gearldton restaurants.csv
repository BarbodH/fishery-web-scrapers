They always makes an excellent dinner for us, and a continental style breakfast for us in the morning. I'm not sure what the actual rates are, but we always give them 100.00 per person, because it's worth it! It's a very comfortable home, and Larry and Raylene are super nice, really down to earth, and know how to cook! You can check with them....Their names are Larry and Raylene Schallock They own the ""584 Bed and Breakfast"" 422 Aspen Drive Nakina, Ontario (807) 329-5655 She won't have any availability for Friday August 5th though....we've got them reserved again for our group. Sorry!"

4693394,Crede,2016-04-01 07:37:00,134,"Country Kitchen did not survive the winter of 2014-2015. So wasn't open when we were there in June 2015. In Geraldton: 1) Connors Pizza has decent food. However, service can be VERY slow (like walk in, sit down, and be enjoying your food 1 1/2 - 2 hours later). They seem to do a brisk carry out business on Friday and Saturday nights. 2) Mary Brown's Famous Chicken and Taters. It's everything you would expect it to be. It's mostly deep fried fast food. But it's prompt, the people at the counter are friendly, and it won't kill you (at least not immediately). We have eaten there on our way to Nakina each of the last two years after looking in Connors, seeing they were busy, and voting to not invest the time. 3) Popeye - had a decent Saturday lunch there several years ago on our way out. Would eat there but we never seem to find it open. Food was good. 4) The Chinese restaurant. Never appears open when we go by. 5) If Chill on the Corner ever reopens, go there. It was the best by far. If I was driving from the east, I would stop in Longlac. Driving from Thunder Bay, we will probably cruise up and down the Main Street in Geraldton, look inside Connors, and end up at Mary Brown's again so that we can get to Nakina before it is completely dark."
