1925914,drlee,2013-07-06 14:40:00,409,"I travel this route every summer and don't recall seeing any signs for this lake. Also, it is close in spelling to some lakes I vaguely recall, but not exact...could you have the wrong spelling? I googled your version and got no hits. I would be curious as well."

It is on the 1st Nation Indian reservation and you will need permission from the chief of the community that lives on the southern shore. He will charge you $8.00 to land a boat for the day. The best fishing is further west after hand lining small light weight 14 to 16ft boats through a small rapids. The landing is pretty good, shallow with some rocks in close that are easy to get around. Also this lake has several sets of reefs that come near the surface one near the landing and several sets more as you head west. I've fished it several times but would not consider my self overly knowledgeable. We have had decent success on walleye fair numbers in the 15 - 17in range It has fairly easy access once you have secured permission. good luck"

1927226,davis,2013-07-07 09:00:00,18,"I've a hunch that if there are lakes where a person can pull in with a pickup camper, launch a boat and spend a few days, they are not discussed on Walleye Central. Secret stuff. That said, I think those places are decreasing in number due to changes. Can't quite enjoy the cabin life. Problem is the younger generation knows no difference."
