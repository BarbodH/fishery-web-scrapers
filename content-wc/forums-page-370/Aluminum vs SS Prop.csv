1916098,Kansas Bound,2013-07-02 11:55:00,152,I got advise a long time ago to only use an aluminum prop in the rocky Canadian waters to prevent lower unit damage. With the updated hub system is that advise outdated?

1917098,btmbncr,2013-07-02 16:46:00,492,I have been able to mangle both equally.That being said I take 3 aluminum props with me to Lac Seul.I think the softer metal helps protect damaging the lower unit.

Think of it this way...You run a stainless prop to get better performance out of a motor. You're in the states and you fish in the morning, maybe again next weekend. In Canada, you're fishing hard, in the boat rain or shine all day every day. Why NOT take advantage of the better performance?? If you're that worried about damaging the equipment, follow somebody else, but if not the lead dog, the view never changes."

On a number of occasions over the past twenty years I've nicked a rock at idle speed. Only caused cosmetic damage to the stainless steel prop. Would think that if it had been an aluminum prop that significant damage would have occurred. Also, I've seen floating wood on LOW and would assume that a stainless steel prop would hold up better than aluminum if hit."
1918594,Babamel2,2013-07-03 06:21:00,414,"I noticed that some of the camps that are on lakes with a lot of rocks. the camp owners have installed Rock Hoppers on their motors. One owner told me it has almost eliminated lower unit damage. take note that he runs a fly or train in camp and the largest motor he rents is 15hp. I figured if it was good for him, I put one on mine. Bought it from the manf. google for Rock Hopper. it cost $140. Cabelas sells them for 180 take your pick."
1918914,Gregking,2013-07-03 07:54:00,2658,LOTW and I don't own an aluminum prop. I review the map each and every year for my marks. I have had an issue yet
1918970,Fishoil,2013-07-03 08:07:00,1277,These things are a great investment if you have a small motor and fish rocky lakes. I put them on both of the 25's that we use in Canada and have virtually eliminated prop. damage. It makes the day a lot more enjoyable knowing that you don't have to worry about hitting rocks as much. Since I started using them a few years ago they have saved me at least 2 props and possibly a lower unit. A very worthwhile investment.
1919466,2746,2013-07-03 09:54:00,3206,Stainless props will save you hundreds of dollars in aluminum prop repairs. That is why I use one and I have never seen a lower unite damaged because of the prop. 20 years of ss and no lower unit damage. Prior to that I was spending $120 plus each year in repair.
