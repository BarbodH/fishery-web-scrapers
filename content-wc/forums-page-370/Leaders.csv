1850721,zeebee,2013-06-09 14:57:00,1144,"Ive used the surflon in 13 lbs test and love it. Ties well, doesn't interfere with lure action and does the job. Favourable reviews on various forums too. Calling it ""garbage"" ...well perhaps you didn't tie it properly. As for being able to cut it with scissors....that's a positive and doesn't immediately suggest it wont handle NP teeth."
1851777,Mike Borger,2013-06-09 21:18:00,1554,"My comments weren't directed at you, I was simply passing along my thoughts.If you like the stuff and it works well for you that's all that matters."
1853130,rockape,2013-06-10 10:59:00,215,"I use 174# wire leaders almost exclusively. Made by Stealth Tackle. Big pike could care less about the big long wire. The staylok snap is key. They won't open. Never have had a failure. I also use Stealth Tackle's 100# flourocarbon leaders for smaller slashbaits and such. No failures there either. However, if you use jerkbaits, the wire leader has fewer fowl ups than the flurocarbon. I throw musky sized baits for pike. Big bait = big fish."
1914738,Nosebleed,2013-07-02 06:34:00,253,"I use AFW single strand titanium toothproof.http://www.afwhiseas.com/Titanium-Le...and-s/2190.htmThis is the stuff you need. I've been making my own for 3 years now with 0 break offs. I use 75lb for the heavy tackle #bull dawgs, gliders, jerks, etc..# and 40lb for the more subltle lures #swim baits, mepps, jigs, etc# Don't use huge wire. It WILL affect the action and presentation of you're bait. I was all about fluorocarbon until I had a rough trip that was largely ruined by my only 2 master anglers turned boat side and sliced the 80 flouro right in the middle of the leader..... So never again for me.... Muskie teeth must not be as sharp as far north pike. If you're not into making your own there are a few out there that are this style but they will cost you ($12.00 ea at scheels for the stringease brand) Look for some that are tied not crimped. That's Jack Penny's rule and I agree. Pinched crimped wires can fail. I've lost several fish/lures that way. Like I said I have yet to have a failure and for $3.50 e top if the line components at the end of my line.I also like to use an improved Albright knot to tie my braid (55lb diawa samurai) directly to the leader. No swivel for finesse baits. pulls through weeds great too. I use a Improved figure 8 knot when for the wire knots. finish with a little plasti-dip, liquid electrical tape, or really small shrink wrap to cover the knot and wire tag end."
1914770,rockape,2013-07-02 06:51:00,215,"174# wire leader brought this beast in the boat a couple of weeks ago. If you are fishing for pigs, you need strong gear. Believe me, fish this big don't care."
1915042,Nosebleed,2013-07-02 08:26:00,253,"I'm not saying the fish care about wire size. I'm saying some baits flat out wont work right with lbs of wire/swivel/snap running in front of it. That's why Doug stange uses 20 lb stuff with rapala glidn raps, they won't glide or pause right with a huge wire in front.... Do what works for you. Nice fish btw"
1915322,5richards,2013-07-02 09:38:00,131,I make my own 80# fluoro leaders -- have had no bite offs -- numerous fish in the 40's -- only have seen minimal nicks --
1915610,rockape,2013-07-02 10:11:00,215,"Totally agree with you. I tie some baits right on to the superline. The action of the lure is most important. Leaders can make baits sink too fast too, so that is something I always consider. Great ideas and suggestions from all. I'm just too lazy to make my own!"
1924546,rpieske,2013-07-05 20:11:00,1276,Take the advice of Gipper. I have been making my own fluorocarbon leaders in 100 lb. test for about 10 years. I fish muskies on LOTW daily from season opener to late Sept. or early October. I have never had a failure.....NEVER. Here is a link to the best primer on how to make these leaders. I have shared it with many and never heard anyone complain. Try it...http://www.leadertec.com/tipsandtech...echniques.html
1842921,tsquared,2013-06-06 10:02:00,57,"Seems like we struggle more & more with leaders. Switched to titanium leaders but they are expensive and not so sure I didn't have just as many failures with snaps on swivels, etc. Better in regards to not getting as kinked up as steel, etc. We fish for Pike and the occasional Musky. What are others doing?"
1843009,wallydave,2013-06-06 10:36:00,2151,"Leaders can be a problem thats for sure! One year many trips ago, I had some new Eagle Claw leaders for a father son trip to Lac Seul. Every single one failed!! Some while reeling in several big pike, of course tehy must have been big, because the leader broke each time!! A couple even groke just casting daredevil spoons! Not a happy camper, I threw the rest of them away! Upon returning home I called them and let then know about my less than favorable results! To my amazement, they said they had a bad production run, in crimping the swivel, the machine crushed the metal strands! He asked for the production number, I told him I pitched them rest of them. No offer for replacement, not that I would have trusted new ones, but it would have been a nice gesture! I have read several of some folks going with 50lb mono for a leader, I haven't tried that yet, maybe one of these years!Good question! I hope you get the answer your looking for!"
1843249,Opie,2013-06-06 11:38:00,129,"I use 40# Power Pro (10 lb diameter I think). Works well, doesn't prevent every bite off, but most. Stays flexible. Dean"
1843305,zeebee,2013-06-06 12:17:00,1144,This stuff is tiable (I use an improved clinch with three twists) and will prevent biteoffs. Close to same diameter as 10lbs test mono and very limp for a leader material. Best leader solution out there.http://www.afwhiseas.com/product-p/dm19-11-a.htm
1844321,new hips,2013-06-06 18:27:00,498,I use 75lb florocarbon with staylock snap..............worth the cost or make your own.
1844401,RapShad,2013-06-06 18:48:00,76,"Terminator Titanium 12"" leaders, best leader I have ever come across. Worth the $$$"
1846449,vteye,2013-06-07 11:49:00,812,"x2 tie my own leaders, I am using 40 floro and have yet to snap one. I useheavy dury snap on one end with heavy swivel on the other."
1848097,Moosebunk,2013-06-08 06:48:00,211,"For cost one can't beat 45 or 60lb black nylon coated steel leaders. Buy the Berkely spool, sleeve crimps and your preferred snaps and swivels and make your own. Only tool needed, square nosed pliers.You're talking maybe a dollar per leader and when the thing is mangled or bent, simply cut off your snap and swivel and put them on a new strand.Titanium... expensive. Some cost $12 (could make 10-12 leaders for that and be good for an entire fly-in trip) One gets bit off above the leader, what a silly waste of money. Floro... even 110lb doesn't prevent bite offs and I've had pike teeth actually greenstick (shave) floro lengthwise up to 6 inches. Dollar for dollar and best for reliability. Good ole steel."
1848137,Gipper,2013-06-08 07:04:00,76,"I used the best on the market but after 2 failures I started to build my own. I use 100# test fluorocarbon with 100# Berkeley snaps and swivels, with crimped double-barreled sleeves with a final step of melting the tag ends. Never fail and I control the quality."
1849017,Mike Borger,2013-06-08 18:01:00,1554,"I've used heavy fluoro leaders and like them, but for most of my applications the best leader I've used BY FAR is the Terminator Pro Series Titanium leader wire in 20lb test. The heavier stuff is extremely difficult to tie, but the 20 is great. It's tieable so you cut off a hunk as you need it. It stretches and with a simple 3 or 4 turn clinch knot is strong. The stuff is so incredibly thin and light it's fantastic when working lighter baits like a Husky Jerk, it doesn't interfere with the action. Great when you're trolling cranks for walleye in pike infested waters.I used this stuff exclusively on the Attawapiskat last week and caught dozens of huge pike, no issues at all.In the past I've also used the Surflon knotable leader wire as well as a similar product made by Tuff Line. Both are garbage imo. They're thicker and bulkier and not as abrasion resistant. If I can cut the stuff easily with scissors then a large esox won't have any issues slicing through it."
