I would say that the walleye fishing was at least average or above, not huge numbers boated, but many we caught were over 24"" (slot size was 14.5-21 for keepers). The first couple days were much colder & cloudier & and as would be expected, the fishing was better on those days. The last 2 days the water temperature was 68+.We stayed at Bush Country Camp, Norm & Chantale were great hosts, the camp was clean and family oriented, and the food was very good (we went on the American plan). Highlights of the trip were two trips to the portage lakes, hooking into a 28"" and 29"" pike, my son catching his first pike, and one night at one of the walleye honey-holes when the fish just couldn't stay off of the hook.I am planning to go back again, probably earlier in the year next time when the water is cooler."
