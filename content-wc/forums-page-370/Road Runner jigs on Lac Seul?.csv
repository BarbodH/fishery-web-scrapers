1926634,Rodney Bondele,2013-07-06 22:04:00,73,I have used jigs with spinners in Lac Seul. Cought so many fish hard to tell if there was a difference with spinners or not. Some times color made a difference. The biggest factor was how many snags. In real snag infested areas I used cheaper jigs. Have fun trying to figure it out.Rod

In NW Ontario I probably jig about half my walleye fishing time and about half of that is with a Road Runner. 1/8 or 1/4 oz., chartreuse, half a crawler. If the Road Runner does not have the fuzzy body, add a yellow twister tail. Give 'em a try, especially when a regular jig isn't working or the bit slows down."

1927394,LeeMB,2013-07-07 09:47:00,83,"that type of jig will work great, especially in a current situation. You may have to up size due to the extra drag the spinner offers."
1927434,tooski,2013-07-07 09:53:00,393,Easily my favorite jig style. Like them so much we bought the mold and pour our own. Pain in the arse getting those little swivels on for the spinners though.
