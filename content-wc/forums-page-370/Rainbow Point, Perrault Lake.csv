1913818,go dart,2013-07-01 19:16:00,77,Thanks for the report digjig. RockyShore man myself but I won't forget the time we ran out of gas by Rainbow Point and they gassed us up for free (happily). Great people.
1916130,digjig,2013-07-02 12:09:00,146,That does not suprise me at all. I think they are a pretty good group of owners all around the lake. -DJ
1685849,team walleye,2013-04-17 21:16:00,336,Going to be staying here for the first time this June. Anyone going to Rainbow or have stayed there with any advice or tips?? Thanks!
1688281,digjig,2013-04-18 12:21:00,146,"We will be heading up to RPL the last week in June. We have been going to RPL for 5 years now and love it. ""The Wall"" on the East side is a good section to drift. We will catch fish off the dock, in the bay camp is in, 1st bay, 2nd bay, Grassy bay, the wall, rainbow island. Plenty of spots."
1688513,team walleye,2013-04-18 13:21:00,336,Can't wait to get up there. Ever fish the Ord?
1691865,digjig,2013-04-19 10:07:00,146,"A couple times. We did OK. I think is productive early on. However, it can be a very popular place. This year may be good with the later ice out. What week are you at RPL? P.S. My picture is the view from Cabin #4. -DJ"
1692417,Shotgun,2013-04-19 12:42:00,759,"Fished out of Rocky Shore about six years ago for a week, which is on Perrault Lake. Caught the majority of our walleye right around dusk. Others fished for small mouth and were more successful. Watch for the rocks as we took out a prop. I also remember one day the wind came up blowing down the length of the lake and it got rather rough, seemed like more so than many other lakes I've been on. We did see a moose swimming across the lake and was very mad when we got within a couple hundred feet of it. Once it got where it could stand up, it turned and wanted to charge us. Beautuful area, make sure you go down by the old tressel. Enjoy!"
1693513,team walleye,2013-04-19 19:06:00,336,Awesome view!! First day up there will be June 15!
1693785,Glenman12,2013-04-19 20:44:00,762,"Ive been a veteran of Cedar Lake for the last 30 yrs...last year was the first time we ventured up to Perrault...with a strong mid June north wind blowing we decided to try all the shoreline and bays on the south side of the lake..with 4 guys in 2 boats we just nailed the walleyes..everything was in the 18-22""range...me and my partner then decided to motor on back down to Cedar...the other boat was smarter...they started back but trolled the west shoreline down to the burned out bridge...they got two 24""s and a 30""..this was with an early iceout though...who knows what a late iceout will bring.."
1694497,wallydave,2013-04-20 06:22:00,2151,I will be at Goose Bay Camp the same week. We'll be stopping at Dutchies for Canadian beer! Friday night we'll be at Boston Pizza!
1695177,team walleye,2013-04-20 09:30:00,336,I have seen some guys get some pretty nice musky by the burnt out bridge too!
1912634,digjig,2013-07-01 12:54:00,146,"Just returned from Rainbow Point Lodge (RPL) this last Saturday. Great trip. Camp was a little over half full. This was easily our best year on Perrault. Water temps were 67 - 72 depending on in bay vs main lake locations. Weather was mixed with intermittant showers. Temps were 52 F - 76 F during the week. Wind was consistantly blowing from the southwest pushing the action to the bays and shorelines along the notheast side close to RPL. We caught fish in 1st bay, 2nd bay, grassy bay, the wall and around the corner towards Whale Rock. I even took a ride to the Ord, but only pulled a couple small Walleye. Northern and Perch were plentiful when targeted as well. I even caught a Whitefish (first time). The action seemed to be from 9 - 14 feet, primarily in the 11 foot contour. Great week overall. Can't wait to go back! -DJ"
