1921858,LUCKWI,2013-07-04 08:44:00,13,"Hi Guys, Just got back from the Mahkwa area of Lac Seul. Fabulous fishing over 2400 walleyes for the week. We finally wore out our battery powered fillet knife. Anybody have any experience with the newer model of knives and their quality or is everyone staying with the tried and true regular fillet knives. We have a large group of 14 guys so its nice to get fish cleaned quickly at shore lunch. Thanks all have great fishing Roy"
1921922,Jimmy Jig,2013-07-04 09:14:00,1905,Hope you didn't clean all 2400! I have never used an electric and don't plan on it. Walleyes are the easiest fish to clean of all the fish. Real knife makes fast work of it.
1922002,revitup,2013-07-04 10:15:00,140,my brother uses a rapala and really likes it. comes with spare battery so can be charging one while using other. Costs roughly $110
1922058,LLewellin,2013-07-04 11:06:00,1790,American Angler has always been the best for me but i am not sure if they make a battery powered one or not.
1922106,Pooch,2013-07-04 11:34:00,4619,"We also fish out of Mahkwa in the fall and I have the Rapala 110volt. Works great in their fish house as it has a long cord. Very happy with it. Haven't gotten electrocuted yet............I doubt there is a lot of difference in knives, but I have had great luck with this one and also have a 12 volt version. Both are great. I used to be a die hard fillet knife guy until I used an electric on walleye and panfish. Hate to even pick up a regular fillet knife unless I have to.Buddy has the battery version and it does not have near the power of the 110 or 12 volt models. Also is heavy to work with.Sounds like a good trip to that part of LS. What cabin were you in? We are still trying to firm up our cabin for Labor Day. They (Mahkwa) are not very good communicators.Pooch"
1922506,jimirjr,2013-07-04 16:50:00,1149,"I had a GOOD Buddy that thought along the same lines as You.... till He used My Rapala Electric.He admitted he was stubborn, finally. Said he'd never use a 'hand knife' again."
1922786,Troy Mansfield,2013-07-04 21:14:00,22,"Get a wustof knife and you'll set that noise machine down. But if your going to buy an electric knife, the mister twister model is the best in my opinion"
1923194,jimirjr,2013-07-05 07:18:00,1149,"I have a ""Wustoff""AND a ""BOKER""AND a ""Henckells""The ""RAPALA"" out does em all... IMO"
1923354,Skyraptor,2013-07-05 08:20:00,291,Use a knives of Alaska Coho fillet knife. No need to use a electric knife as I practice CPR and clean/keep very few fish in order to protect or resources.
1923738,2746,2013-07-05 10:06:00,3206,I've given up on battery powered knives. To heavy and expensive. I use a 110 when in the fish house and a good sharp fillet knife when doing shore lunch.
