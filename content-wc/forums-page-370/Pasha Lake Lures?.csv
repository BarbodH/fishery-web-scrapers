That might help find some info, check with your outfitter too! Chances are they will want to put you on the fish!! Have a good trip and let us know how it went!"

They are the same walleye as in every other lake and will hit just about anything such as worm harnesses, crankbaits, Lindy rigs.Chad provides you with minnows that work good also. Good luck. Great place."
