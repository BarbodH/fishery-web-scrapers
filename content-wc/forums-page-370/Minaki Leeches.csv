1927282,Bigiver,2013-07-07 09:11:00,94,We are heading up to Minaki in two weeks and will need about 10 to 15 lbs of leeches again. Any one have a suggestion between Baudette an Minaki? Anything by Kenora? We have bought them several places in the past but things change. Someone have a recent report for me? Thanks in advance.
