1265648,Guest,2011-01-28 09:15:00,0,I have been to Swain numerous times and it is the best fishing I've ever seen. The camp is extremely primitive and has been going downhill the last several years due to Danny's declining health. He did pass this year but the camp is being run by Jim who rented a small cabin on Swain Lake and would often help Danny with day to day operations. Not sure what will come of the camp with Danny gone but last I heard it is still in operation and is a fantastic experience.
1367754,Guest,2011-11-25 10:57:00,0,"Got a letter today from Sean Anderson, 11/25/2011, about renting cabin a Swain Post. . .so they are still in business. I and friends used to canoe the Confederation/Woman Lake/Birch Lake area for years, before the mining road. Used to jump off on Bruce Lake on the Hwy.. . then it was Snakeweed Lake . .. then Confederation. First year up there was 1967. We used to sit on the lawn with Ross Ori (sp) the Swain Post owner before Dan. Met Dan many time as we were portaging from Swain Lake into Shabumeni. Dan was a great guy. . tough as they come. We would do a loop from Shabumeni into Birch Lake and then back through Grace Lake and into Swain again. Times I will never forget .. . Bill Vagts, Isabella, MN"
1368351,Mohleye,2011-11-28 08:33:00,368,"Bill, Dan spoke of you guys many times. You passed through one year when I was in camp and got some mosquito coils, I believe. Those must have been some incredible trips! I've done those portages many times, but never after paddling all day, and never with a canoe over my head. It was so dry this summer you could do the portage to Shab in tennis shoes or Keene sandals."
1368826,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-11-29 17:36:00,235,Have driven by this lodge many times on trips to Kabeelo Lodge (whose air base is on Confederation). Have always wondered about it. Just thinking about being on that long gravel road gets me excited.
1473432,Guest,2012-08-10 19:49:00,0,"hey guys, I'm currently guiding on the Woman River System here at CNL... fishing this season has been phenomenal... we are one of only 3 lodges on our 35 mile river system which contains 6 lakes (Little Bear, Loon, Middle, Big Bear, Little Woman, Big Woman) all of which have been fishing very well all summer long. We also offer 9 different portage lakes. se lakes are absolutely on fire when it comes to walleye, pike, and smallmouth fishing. 100 fish days are more than likely on these lakes. Each lake has a different ""strength"" such as big pike, big walleyes, big smallies, etc. As for accommodations here at CNL, you will struggle to find better venues. We have 24 cabins all with indoor plumbing and heat. Breakfast is cooked as ordered (if you can dream it, we can make it), lunch is done on the lake via shorelunch, and dinner is served family style in our spacious dining room (steak, ribs, thanksgiving dinner, pork chops, prime rib, grilled or fried chicken, etc). hope this was helpful! thanks, Lantz Cornett Canada North Lodge Ltd."
1497149,Guest,2012-10-20 09:44:00,0,His son Sean still operates the camp and does a great job.
1497746,Guest,2012-10-23 07:52:00,0,"I don't think the South Bay Camp is operating anymore. Unless I'm thinking of a different camp, I thought that camp had a fire a few years back. It might be operating partially for some services."
1922578,Guest,2013-07-04 17:43:00,0,"Hey everyone! My name is mike moore and i guided for the owners mike and julie hoffman for several years! I can tell you first hand that the service provided to you as a guest is 2nd to none at canada north lodge, from the accommodations to the fantastic food to the excellent fishing opportunities that await! The main system produces excellent opportunities to boat several nice fish and the numbers are above ordinary. The portage lakes like spot produce 5 lb small mouth consistently.Little walleye and R&R are excellent walleye lakes that can give you staggering numbers and good quality. If pike is your game then jump into Quarts for a pike bonanza. I have fished out of several lodges and CANADA NORTH LODGE is by far 1 of the top on my list."
507396,Randy,2000-03-16 08:21:00,53,Has anyone visited Canada North Lodge in NW Ontario? Its on the Woman Chain of Lakes a little south and East of Red Lake. I booked this lodge for a party of 7 for early June. Its not a fly-in lodge but the last 40 miles are on a gravel road and there aren't other lodges in the area.
507397,Guest,2000-03-16 20:37:00,0,"Have been there. Nice Accomodations but the Woman Lake has 5 lodges on it. They tend to boat 25-30 miles before they start fishing out of Canada North lodge. The lake is pretty but has too many people on it. Also have fished on up the road another 10 miles is a boat-in lodge, South Bay Lodge on Confederation Lake. They are the only lodge on the lake and is more like a fly-in lodge because no one else is there and the fishing pressure is much less and the cabins are beautifully restored log cabins that are immaculantly clean. Give it a try next year!"
507398,Guest,2000-03-16 20:44:00,0,"Bill, I have also been to South Bay Lodge. Great Lake Trout and big Pike lake. We were there last summer with a group of 10 and all had guides. They treated us like Royalty and we caught lots of fish everyday. The food was fantastic, fresh bread everyday! We caught 7 pike over 40 inches in our group and missed a bunch more. We were there in late July and the lake trout were deep, but they have downriggers on the guide boats and we caught trout until we were tired of catching them. We plan to be back next summer and are booking the whole camp (24)."
507399,Randy,2000-03-17 08:05:00,53,Canada North Lodge is on the Woman River and fare distance away from Woman Lake. Is this why you traveled a good distance before fishing each day? Where did you do most of your fishing? Did you try any of the portage lakes? What time of the year did you go to CNL?The information I have is that there is a small lodge called Woman River Camp that is west of Canada North Lodge (CNL) and South Bay Lodge is east of via the road but a long ways via water since the river heads North to the mid part of Confederation Lake and South Bay is on the south end of the lake. I wasn't aware of any other lodges on the river/lake.Thanks for any information you can provide.
507400,Richard,2000-03-17 17:55:00,64,"CNL is actually located on Little Bear Lake ( a large bay of the Woman River system. The whole Woman Lake/River is all one and the same. It's just that they seem to fish the north end of the lake from CNL they boat 25 miles 1 way and then start fishing. Most of the portage lakes are located on the north end too, so you spend most of the day getting to and from. Woman Lake Lodge is on the North end, another 2 miles north of there is Swain Post (actually on Swain Lake but all connected), Woman River Camp is located just south of CNL. There are several outpost cabins on the system too. Woman River Fly-outs is based there also. What it all boils down to is there are alot of boats going up and down that system everyday. Other than the traffic it's a beautiful lake (just too many people for as far north as you are).South Bay Lodge is on Confederation lake which is a totally different lake which drains into Washigomis then into Swain then into Woman River/lake. It is the only lodge fishing on the Confederation Lake and you never see another boat most days."
1059866,Guest,2008-10-10 12:48:00,0,"I am quite familiar with Swain Post Lodge, If you go there I highly recommend the 1 mile portage over to Shabamini(spelling???). The fishing hit non-stop and it's very unlikely to see another boat. Except for the house, all of the cabins were made by hand by Dan the owner himself using not much more than a chainsaw. Quite impressive when you see them. I have never been disappointed by a visit there."
1119717,Guest,2009-07-09 15:23:00,0,"Been to CNL five times and enjoy it each time. The lodge is up the logging road about 30 miles North of Ear Falls. Lodging, meals, service is all outstanding. I have fished all the lakes with great success and many of the portage lakes too. I have never had anything but an excellent time with the folks at CNL. Tons of walleye between 20 & 25 inches lots 26 - 27 and some 28s. Even a couple 29s. Smallies between 3 & 5 pounds are not rare and the northern to 40 inches. Now, 40 and 40+ are not common every day, but common every trip. Even get some lakers too. My favorite weeks are the last two weeks of June. TG"
1265029,Guest,2011-01-26 11:53:00,0,"How Long has it been since you visited Swain Post? I made 15 trpis up there between 1983 and 2004. Rumer has that Dan is sick and has not been there the last few years, I'm not even sure if the camp is still in operation. I was going up there before the board walk was laid down across the bog to get to shabumeni.Best Walleye fishing I ever had was on Shab and I have fished a lot of lakes up there. I heard Confederation was fished out of Walleyes."
1265059,Guest,2011-01-26 13:35:00,0,Dan unfortunately passed away a day or so before Thanksgiving.
