1899170,Mark R,2013-06-26 10:13:00,1538,"Gotta agree with LOW1 , we pay what ever they say with out question and we are on our way. less is more when it comes to spending time at the border crossing. However, it does come out to about $9.00 a case."
1899490,PCDOC,2013-06-26 12:11:00,410,"Whatever the duty cost is just pay it and be happy. If you run out of booze way up north it will/does cost waaaaaaaaayyy more than whatever you paid for it in the states plus duty.Last trip up we had 6 liters of crown and only two of us in the vehicle. The border agent looks at us and says ""you have 6 liters and you are staying for 5 days.......... that's more than a liter a day"" Took him a while to do the math. I then told him we were meeting a group of guys. All was good.We generally get a case of crown on our way back from the duty free store. Even with the duty it works out to roughly $20 per liter. Sometimes less. You can't touch that price in the states. They have specials every now and then. I now have two crown camping chairs that were given for free with the purchase of a case."

1926130,Dogbreath,2013-07-06 17:03:00,494,Just think what you might have had for a pallet!!!!!
1896362,troutwater,2013-06-25 10:40:00,299,Is there a website or a way to calculate the duty for bringing beer across the border? Thanks.
1896690,Aaron-IN,2013-06-25 12:40:00,500,"Not sure about a site but I can tell you everytime I pay duty on beer it's different than the time before, I think they just pull it out of their rearends!"
1896794,SinOrSwim,2013-06-25 13:21:00,1528,"This! We have been going for almost 20 years and have NO IDEA what the duty will be. We THINK it has something to do with the price you tell them you paid for the beer in the US. Cheaper you paid, the more expensive your duty is. I have no idea if that is right but I don't think you will ever find a site that shows or tells you how it's calculated."
1896802,Jimmy Jig,2013-06-25 13:31:00,1905,"I think they take the price of the US beer and price of Canada beer, take the difference in cost and thats the tariff!"
1896882,MN_Moose,2013-06-25 14:02:00,964,"We had a bit of difficulty getting through border customs a couple weeks ago. Border Patrol asked if I had any beer, and I said one. ""You mean one case?"" ""No, one pallet"" we were there for a while as they calculated the duty."

1897122,Yamagator,2013-06-25 14:52:00,28,We went through earlier this month on our way to Morson and paid about $10 per case in taxes/duty.
1897162,TJL009,2013-06-25 15:01:00,145,was through last week - paid ~$9 per case in duty. Remember they also base it on how much you tell them you paid for said case of beer. Duty Free store had them for $16 and we paid $9 in duty on the extra cases.

1898946,LOW1,2013-06-26 08:52:00,2828,"Part of the confusion and variability is related to the border officials converting the value of the goods to Canadian dollars using an exchange rate which can vary and then calculating the duty on the Canadian dollar value.I don't know what the liquor rate is. I take a fair amount of construction materials, furniture, etc across and the rate on that is 5%."
