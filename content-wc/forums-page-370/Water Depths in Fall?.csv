1925466,bftiger,2013-07-06 10:55:00,21,I'm new to Walleye fishing in Canada. In general do the walleyes feed shallower in the fall as the weather cools or do they stay in the deeper summer pattern? How about the northern pike? I fished in May and they were in 8-12 feet of water. I assume in July & Aug they will be in 20-30 feet. Where will they be in late September?

Up till then they will generally hold to deeper patterns but after turnover you can expect them anywhere in the water column but usually much shallower. Same with Northern, up till lake turnover I catch my largest in depths of + 15 ft. The first few days after turnover can result in some of the slowest fishing of the year as the fish seem discombobulated."
