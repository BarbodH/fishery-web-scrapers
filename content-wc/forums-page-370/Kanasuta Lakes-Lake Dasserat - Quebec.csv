His cabins are all excellent, but on the downside are located in the marina of the first lake. A very busy and imo not a very scenic spot. He does however have some rough water access ""outposts"" located further up the lake. Mike's Outfitter is a water access camp located in the N/E corner of Dasserat right where the river flows in. It's an outstanding facility with incredible cabins and scenery. Mike and his wife Johanne are also fantastic people. Take your pick as far as the camps go. Now, as far as fishing goes, this lake is situated very close to Rouyn Noranda, and as expected is littered with private cottages and is used very heavily by the locals. It seems more like a southern lake because of the traffic imo. That being said it's not a bad walleye lake, but they sure aren't going to jump in your boat. If you're a reasonably proficient walleye fisherman and can read and interpret a hydrogrophic map, you'll do okay. I've found pulling spinner rigs behind bottom bouncers to be my ""go to"" technique there. When things get tough an air injected nightcrawler on a Lindy Rig is hard to beat. I've also been forced to fish at night to get good fish there when the cottage traffic gets heavy in the summer. As tough as Dasserat can be, there are some decent back lakes very close by that usually always produce. Anymore questions fire away."

The fishing was average for a northern lake. Caught pickeral and several pike.There were several American people from Ohio and they were very impressed with the facilities and the Lake.There are several cottages with beautiful views of the mountans and Lake and most are very quaint.We would go back in a heartbeat.

Did some tubing with the kids today, managed to finally get the satellite dish connected so we can watch tv, and just had an amazing fish fry. Went out with my son this morning and put a couple dozen nice walleyes in the boat. All pulling a slow death rig behind a bottom bouncer. Mayfly hatch is in full swing. Life is good."
