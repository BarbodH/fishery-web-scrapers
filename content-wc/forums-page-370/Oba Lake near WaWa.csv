I have heard of Oba lake and it looks like it has 2 housekeeping lodges on it (Tatnall camp and Woods cabins). It looks like you can either fly or take the train in. We prefer housekeeping because we like to cook everything ourselves. Any information or another recomendation would be apprectiated. Trying to keep the drive to 10 hours or less due to only having 4-5 days available.thanks,1-shot"

I have friend there now and he has been there several times before, but years ago. It looks like very interesting lake with a million different options. There are two lodges there, but I was looking at one in particular that has cabins on islands ( housekeeping) which is what I prefer as well, and I believe you can drive it (saving money on plane or train). Take a look at it if you have not already....might be good option"
