1909906,Hump,2013-06-30 08:26:00,578,"Just returned from Evergreen Lodge. We had good days on Saturday and Sunday. The largest was 28""29"" and many 23-24's. An unusual amount of 18 just a hair over the slot. Monday we had 40 mile an hour winds and it was brutal. Tuesday, we went out to find Mayflies all over the lake, same with Wednesday. Thursday we did very very well. The big girls were very aggressive. Even tho the lake was up, several prop, skags and 2 lower units. Never a bad trip, we ate all we wanted and brought home a limit."

1910610,Pooch,2013-06-30 13:48:00,4619,"We got caught near the east end of Steamboat that morning and took a brutal beating to get back to Steamboat Narrows catch our breath then hug the shoreline as much as we could the rest of the way back to Goose Bay.I've been caught on bad water before, but this was about as bad as I would ever want to see again. We were not the only ones from what I saw.Pooch"
1910618,lcwhit,2013-06-30 14:04:00,104,"those are the kind of trips that you put on your life jacket, turn on the bilge and leave it on, and most important---pray. i've seen high winds up there, but 40 mph is deadly."
1911722,mswope13,2013-07-01 07:44:00,73,"Hump,Did you make it down to McKenzie? We are heading to Evergreen in 3 weeks, curious as to where you found em?"
1911762,wallydave,2013-07-01 07:59:00,2151,"I was at Goose Bay June 15-20th this year, one evening heading back to camp I hit some large waves and winds east of Goose Island. In all my years at GBC, this was the first time I had ever seen this part of the lac that rough! Nothing like a ""gentle"" reminder that on the water, safety is a constant concern!"
1919690,KC Walleye,2013-07-03 10:57:00,274,"Anyone just get back, and have a fresh report? 2 more days, can't wait!"
1921186,jkrawchu,2013-07-03 21:00:00,26,"Fishing out of Ear Falls for the last 2 days has been good. We've had many over 20"" and today our boat had a 24"", 2 25"", 1 26.5"". Best size day in 3 years. Yesterday we had lots over 20"" and many 23's and one 27"". Most fish are still in 5-10 feet. Amazing the big fish we are getting in under 8 feet of water. I'd say where, but we've tried old spots and new ones. Spots we didn't think would hold big fish are producing. Yesterday we fished in calm waters and 30 degree plus heat and had our best day. Hope the action keeps up."
