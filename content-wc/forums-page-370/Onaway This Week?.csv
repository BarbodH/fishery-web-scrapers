1913714,mswope13,2013-07-01 19:03:00,73,"Steve,How far past Steamboat Narrows did you go? We are heading up in a few weeks to Evergreen and never have been too far past Steamboat. Would you suggest hitting the first big island SE of Steamboat or go further around? Just curious as I've never been down that far. V/R,Mark"
1914434,Steve of Madison,2013-07-01 22:01:00,230,"Musky....your numbers are very close to what my expectations are. Descriptions like that are very subjective, for some guys an awesome trip means they caught 10-20 fish a day. For me that's only 1-2 fish per hour, sorry guys that's slow. We had one morning last year in an undisclosed location where we had 79 fish boated from 8am-noon with 3 of us in the boat. Then the wind kicked up, waves drove us and the fish off the reef and finished the day with about 90 give or take a few. That was a good day."
1915058,muskyroller,2013-07-02 08:35:00,56,"Steve of Madison,I didn't think I was the only one out there that thought this way. But, I think you're right. Folks catching around 30 fish a day may think that's awesome...and of course they are entitled to that. I just wonder if I should ask back at the dock, ""Awesome, huh? How many fish did you catch today?"" That will tell me a lot.It's been interesting, as the last two years I've been tracking my individual numbers and I went from averaging 40 walleyes a day last year to just 25 fish total this year. Granted, I spend a ton of time...way more than the other boats in my group, targeting big pike with my musky gear."
1915066,muskyroller,2013-07-02 08:38:00,56,"Mark,Since you get that far down through Steamboat I would just continue all the way down through to McKenzie Bay. Have Gary show you the exact route to take through the Shanty narrows, go slow, mark your ""track"" on the GPS, and then use that from then on. It's about a 45 min. boat ride from evergreen. Obviously the weather can get you that far away, so plan accordingly.Steve"
1915074,SinOrSwim,2013-07-02 08:43:00,1528,"The number of fish doesn't really make or break what I think is a good day and what is not. I have no interesting catching 75 walleyes if they are all 12 to 14 inches long. If a portion of the 40 or 50 fish etc are 12 inches but the bulk are 18 to 20+ and avove, fine. With a few scattered in there that are 22,24 etc. It's all subjective."
1916226,muskyroller,2013-07-02 12:38:00,56,Totally agree with the size of fish...I was thinking there is a balance between quantity and quality. Quality to me are those 15-25+ inchers.
1874498,muskyroller,2013-06-17 15:31:00,56,Heading up to Onaway Lodge on Friday (6/21). Anyone else fishing out of there or real close that week? Steve
1874690,WalleyeWally28,2013-06-17 16:25:00,298,We will be staying at Whitewing up by Ear Falls but mostly fish McKenzie and on south past Windigo Pt. into the main basin.
1875634,UKBDM,2013-06-17 20:20:00,178,Wabaskang Lake @ Jim and Julie's Wabaskang Camp. Reports are good for size and numbers. Pike are still slow but smallmouth are filling in nicely. I can't wait!
1906402,muskyroller,2013-06-28 15:18:00,56,"Another year has passed and just returned from the annual trip to Canada with my dad, uncle, father in-law and friends. 40 years ago my grandpa started this crazy tradition with his sons and we continue it today.6 days of fishing and tracked how many fish I caught per day. I was right around 150 fish total. That inlcudes 5 bass, northerns, and walleyes. It was tough to say the least. Went to all the usual spots and didn't hammer any consistent walleyes like we normally do. Would get 5 at one spot, 6, 2, 4, but never really get into them as a boat or group, like we usually do.Found some new stuff to try in the future and hope it was just a down year for our group. Overall, a fun trip, but did not live up to expectations of past Lac Seul performances. Biggest Walleye - 2 @ 28""Biggest Northern - 1 @ 41.5"" and 1 @ 38"" (Big northern is a new PB and I've been chasing one over 40 for about 15 years now...was very excited about that)Steve"
1907082,MOfish,2013-06-28 19:55:00,39,Our group was at Onaway the week before you. This was my fourth trip to Onaway and the fishing was ok. We caught fish but never had one of those banner 'Lac Seul' kind of days. But I'm not complaining. It still was a great trip. The only bummer was trashing a prop and skeg coming out of Shanty narrows. A word of caution for all those fishermen fishing in that area is not all the reefs are marked.
1907402,rather-be-fishin,2013-06-28 22:26:00,429,"Hmmmmmm......this is the first ""bad"" fishing report I have heard of lately from Lac Seul. All of the recent reports have been so AWESOME saying the BESTfishing ever. I sure hope it picks up again because we are heading to Fisherman's Cove Resort on Lac Seul by Onaway in just 1 month. Where did you fish? What depths? What lures/bait did you use? Trolling, drifting, anchoring? Any tips/suggestions much appreciated. By the way, we did catch a Muskie by accident last year in South Inlet by the water falls..... :-/ RBF"
1907578,bigtimeelectric,2013-06-29 06:17:00,174,"Mofish where exactly did you hit on shanty narrows? In the west part of the narrows that nav line on the GPS takes you through a stump field I always go around that island or maybe you hit the reef by the bouy on the east end? Sorry to hear that Every year We try and reproduce the bite, pattern and location of the year before ,however every year is different. Some years we'll find a spot and absolutely hammer them all week and next year will go back the same time of the year and I won't be a fish deep , shallow or anywhere in that area. There are a few spots that we have that produce every year in the right conditions. example would be the big sandbanks when the breeze is blowing in making them awesome although that is no secret spot there is plenty of fish there to go around."
1910922,MOfish,2013-06-30 18:17:00,39,I don't mean to discourage anyone about the fishing. I'm just a guy from Missouri that grew up crappie and bass fishing. We probably weren't fishing where or how we were supposed to. The fish we found were 6-10 ft deep. The reef I hit was coming out of west Shanty from the South. There's a red buoy at the entrance and a white jug marking a reef in the narrows. There's another reef marked with a white jug as you exit. The one I hit was just South of it and close to an island. No marker but it was marked on my map. You just can't be too careful on Lac Seul.
1911210,Pooch,2013-06-30 20:25:00,4619,"I drug my skag over the same rocks last Monday coming back from McKenzie. Had never been to that area and was suspicious when I saw the white jug. Was going slow and the motor went up and over, but still scuffed up the skag. No real damage other than I need to smooth up the scag a little.Sometimes you get lucky or maybe that was just a little warning from the Big Guy.Pooch"
1911746,muskyroller,2013-07-01 07:49:00,56,"I've been through that area of the narrows several times and was fortunate enough to come away unscathed...Gary from Evergreen does a great job of informing his guests where and how to navigate some of those tricky spots. Haven't been so lucky just back trolling a few areas a couple years ago. Bent up a rental's prop pretty good two years straight...oops! )My question to you guys that fish Lac Seul is this...What do you consider awesome? I heard so many come in fishing when we were there and read on the boards here that fishing is ""awesome"" or ""we did great!"" Then, followed up with, ""caught our limit"" or something to that effect. Well I say, I hope you caught your limit. I didn't drive 1000+ miles roundtrip to catch my limit. I want to absolutely hammer them and catch between 200 to 300 walleyes. To me, it looks something like this on a daily basis...75+ walleyes = Awesome50-75 walleyes = Very Good35-50 walleyes = Good25-35 walleyes = OKUnder 25 = badAre my numbers skewed and do I have too high of expectations? Have I been jaded by fly-ins and past Lac Seul trips where I've caught A LOT of fish (and big ones, too)? I really have wondered though, when I say ""awesome"" and someone else does, are we meaning the same thing? So, what is awesome to you? p.s. We fished anywhere from 4-20 FOW on a consistent basis. Occasionally we would try between 20-30, but admittedly not as comfortable fishing that deep. We used minnows and some crawlers. Used crappie sized minnows, mid size, and even suckers. We used 1/8, 1/4, and 3/8 oz. jigs. Water temps were the same (Low 60s to high 60s-similar to years past) all week. We just never seemed to find a school of fish and get into them like we have in the past. I wonder if we were too late or too early? Similar water temps to past success got me thinking we were going to do really well. Not trying to sound like a diva, but have always wondered about others perspectives on fishing.Steve"
