540980,AB,2004-06-20 19:09:00,61,"Shoe99, OK I was confused when you said there was no cabin in Mud. Looking on the map I have been to Mud. I had to bust across a beaver dam to get through to it and I remember there were leeches everywhere it seemed. The cabin I was talking about was on Ghost/Flemming back thru Turn around. I haven't been back to Beaver. It looks like a big bay."
540995,Guest,2004-06-21 07:04:00,0,Are you sure about the cabin in Ghost. As far as I know there is no cabin back in Ghost. The cabin you are probably talking about is the outpost in Dynamite Bay. Dynamite Bay is to the right when you get threw the narrows. i personnally don't fish Beaver very much but everybody in camp fishes it a lot. There are a lot of rocks back in beaver.
541032,AB,2004-06-21 21:06:00,61,It's been 20 years since I have been back into Ghost but I was thinking there was a cabin about halfway up in there on the right shoreline. It may be gone now or a figment of my imagination. Last year I went to look at Dynamite bay outpost cabin and made down to turn around.
539822,Guest,2004-05-22 10:58:00,0,I was just wondering if anybody has been to Wabaskang Lake yet and if they ventured back to Wine Lake. I am going to Wine the week of June 5 and I was wondering if there is any place close to the portage to catch smallmouth bass on wabaskang.

539947,AB,2004-05-25 23:57:00,61,"The last bay you enter before the portage has a small opening as you enter it. Boulder banks there hold smallies. You're other hope is the Cedar river falls area as you are heading to Wine. In the narrows take the other turn instead of going into Wine - this will take you to the big falls. Some smallies there. You could even wait a day or two and later take a 1/2 day to boat to the Falls after you get to camp and settle in. It's beautiful. Sorry, I have never caught a smallie in Wine (never fished for them on Wine) so I can't help you there but would like to hear back on your experience. Wine holds some nice Lakers,pike, and walleye. I believe the smallies and perch aren't as plentiful. Wine is beautiful and I'm sure you'll love it. Post when you return!"
539956,Guest,2004-05-26 07:13:00,0,"Wine is a nice lake system we fish 6 different lakes while we are there. We mainly go for walleye and trout and we pick up some pike fishing for them. 2 years ago we limited out on lakers, walleye and pike. We are just curious about smallmouth on wabaskang to try something different. If anyone is looking for a remote boat in camp this is the place to go. Just a warning no electricity, running water or indoor plumbing. It is a real peaceful place to go."
540046,AB,2004-05-27 21:41:00,61,Shoe89 At the far end of Gawley's Bay there is some smallmouth fishing also. This is the second to last bay you enter before the portage. Since you've been through there before I take it you know of the small opening I mentioned earlier for smallie fishing. Do any of the lakes you fish around Wine hold any Muskie? That is a change of pace that I would like to try. About 20 years ago I came across a dead bull moose floating in the narrows going to Wine. I went back the next day with ax to try to knock the horns off. The stench was too bad. The next year I stopped in at Wine camp for gas and was telling the camp owner my story.He pointed to the side of one of the buildings and said those are them hanging there. AB
540051,Guest,2004-05-28 07:35:00,0,"AB As far as I know their are no muskie in any of the lakes we fish just pike, walleye, and lakers. The last few times we have caught are limits of lakers. To bad you didn't get those horns off the moose. At camp he has a lot of different types of horns. Have you heard of any fishing reports from wabaskang or wine? What the weather is like?"
540103,AB,2004-05-30 01:22:00,61,"What I hear is water levels back to near normal, opener was a little slow with cooler temps and ice out a little late. Now temps are warming and the bite is better. Do you catch most of your fish on Wine or the out lakes? Would like to get into some lakers but they're usually hibernating when I go up in August. Are the lakers still shallow when you go? Have you tried for the bass at the big falls? It's strange there's some there and not up in Wine anywhere. Now that I think of it - I don't believe I've ever caught a perch or a bass in Wine. Were you clear on the spots I mentioned for bass near the portage?"
540111,Guest,2004-05-30 07:36:00,0,"AB Thanks for your advice and it is clear where those spots are because everytime we go by those spots we always metion we wanted to fish them but we weren't sure what was up there. Now we are so we might make a trip up one day. As for the lakers we catch them at all depths but they are shallow. A lot of time we are in 12 foot of water trolling for walleye and catch some lakers. But most of the time we fish the narrows, which is straight south down from the camp and depths reach over 100ft. It is a good place for lakers and you can also catch a lot of pike in this area. We use bottom bouncers and troll with sutton spoons. The thinner the better on the spoons. We catch fish all over because the lake isn't fished that heavy. I have had good success on the north end right when you leave the river system from the portage go towards the anishinabi falls entrance that whole end produces walleye and trout. But we do fish the out lakes a lot because you can get your limit relatively quick and a bunch of good eaters. If you have a chance take a day and go into turn around lake and mud both of these lakes are good walleye lakes. But the only problem from wabaskang is they are both a the far end of wine lake. I can't wait I leave in 5 days."
540891,AB,2004-06-16 19:16:00,61,What area do you fish at in Mud? I've only fished for Northerns right as you enter Mud in the reeds. Isn't there a cabin back there? I usually spend a day or two at wine fishing for Northern and Walleye but have yet to catch a laker. Maybe some day? Did catch a big whitefish one year though.
540905,Guest,2004-06-17 07:23:00,0,AB As far as I know there is no cabin back in mud. We fish for walleye at the way back end in front of the reeds. Another place is about half way down the little lake on the left there is a rock face point and this year we pulled many walleye out and one at 26.5. Hope that helps and good luck on catching that laker because they are all over the narrows. Just remember the slot limits in Wine.
