541132,Whitetail,2004-06-24 13:37:00,25,Going to fish Minnitaki with my family next week and was wondering how the bite is. Big trip since this is a family outing. Thinking about taking salted minnows along. Didn't know if I should buy a whole flat of crawlers. Was going to do some trolling and use some Gulp bait. Any and all advice is appreciated. Thank you!
