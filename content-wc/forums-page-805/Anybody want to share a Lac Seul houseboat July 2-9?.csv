541026,Guest,2004-06-21 19:28:00,0,"Steve says to post more info and $$ estimate so here goes: Thanks Steve- If three sign on for the trip( max ) - the cost per person for gas ( final gas $$ would depend upon actual gallons used by your fishing boat but the $$ amount quoted is what we usually spend for housebaot gas and ""fishing boat gas- If you bring a 300 hp monster that cost might go up...) ,accomodations, GST and licenses would cost $ 600.00 U.S pp for the week > (actually 6 days as we try to leave the dock at 11:00a.m. on Friday and have to have the boat back to the dock by 9:00a.m. the next Friday. Leave from Hudson and beach it at Taylor island. Taylor Island is a ""central "" location - I have a 115 on a 680 ranger and can fish all spots except Wapesi within 15-20 min travel time. Lac Seul should be great during the time indicated as it was a late ,cold spring and pre-summer peak should be the rule- Lake levels are at normal pool right now (1172 ' above SL) and fishing should be stable and consistent. We normally use jumbo leeches and artificials this time of year- expensive minnows are NOT NEEDED. e-mail me at [email protected] with any questions- My buddy ( just the two of us) are going regardless and if you've been thinking about fishing the walleye factory in the best part of the lake , I will share all I know and pilot the houseboat ! best regards, JBP"
