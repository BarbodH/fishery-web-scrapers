540923,Guest,2004-06-17 14:29:00,0,Got the waypoint or locatin for that great spot?
540927,Hoosier Swede,2004-06-17 16:34:00,3,"I stayed at Timberlane Lodge the week of 5-22-04 and my group had an excellent time. The cabin was clean, adequately furnished and all appliances were functional. The camp boat was a 16' Lund Stalker with pedistal seats, floor, storage compartments, bilge pump, and a ""new"" 25 hp Yamaha 4 stroke with electric start. The boat was more than adequate. Each morning we found our boat with the engine running and bait bucket full. We had one battery related problem with one boat and the issue was promptly addressed by the staff. Our group had breakfast everyday and one dinner in the lodge. We were very pleased with the food. Mrs. Webster is an excellent cook. If you are going to stay at Timberlane, I would highly recommend breakfast everyday at the lodge. I made the arrangements for our group with Dean Webster, Timberlane's manager. Dean was responsive to my emails and delivered the fishing vacation that he advertised. The basic cost was $465.00 per person-two men per boat. I felt that Timberlane was an excellent value. Our group plans on being repeat customers."
540929,Guest,2004-06-17 19:10:00,0,the price difference is about $50 in may-june. jumps up to about $150 in july and after. evergreen has nicer boats and cabins. dean and his wife are good folks and i'm sure that gary and pat do a good job also. may-june definately goes to evergreen. july and after is a tossup. totally a matter of personal preferences.
540938,Guest,2004-06-18 08:50:00,0,Thanks Hoosier Swede - looking forward to the trip Can't wait to get up there. We've done many fly-ins but are intrigued by reports of lac seul piggies and overall larger fish
541009,Rich J,2004-06-21 10:53:00,65,"Really disapointing, have a safe trip. Hopefully we will see you in August. Rich J"
541120,Guest,2004-06-24 09:53:00,0,"I stayed at Timberlane May 22 through May 29. There were six of us in the group. Dean and Megan were fantastic hosts. Our equipment was always in good working order and ready to go in the morning. The accomodations were what we needed and the price very reasonable. I would strongly recommend having breakfast at the lodge in the morning ($6/day), it was great. We all had a good time and caught a lot of fish."
540895,Rich B,2004-06-16 21:11:00,1081,"A group of our friends just returned from a week up at Timberlane lodge at Lac Seul, and they had a very nice week with good success with the walleyes, etc. Our friends rode by the Evergreen Lodge on the water and said it looked very nice. Although we may bring up our boats, it's a long two day drive up to Lac Seul (2 days from Ohio) and we will probably use the camp boats or upgraded camp boats. We're looking to book a week late May next year......are these camps in a good area of Lac Seul for Spring fishing, and if so; anyone have any experience with either lodge (or both) good or bad with the lodging, camp boats, meals, etc ? Both these camps look fairly similiar. We want to maximize our vacation time/trip at a clean camp with well performing & maintained boats, and good fishing ! I know many of you will wonder why we're driving by Lake Erie (yes, we do fish the ""Big Pond"") but as many of you know, it's just not the same trying to have a shore lunch on Lake Erie (ha) ! Thanks ! Faith, Family, Friends........and Fishing ! Rich B."
540897,2 DOGS,2004-06-16 22:01:00,361,"Don't know how rates compare but no comparison between cabins or equipment. Most of the cabins at Evergreen are either new or remodeled in last few years. Boats and motors are about the newest anywhere around. Not the typical camp boat! They are VERY conservation minded. You only keep those under slot or hang it on the wall, then they'll recommend a replica instead. I must agree."
540898,Big Fish,2004-06-16 22:27:00,138,Got to agree with 2 Dogs - no comparison.. cw
540906,Mark R,2004-06-17 07:24:00,1538,Been going to Evergreen once or twice a year for the last 8 years and all the cabins are new or remodeled within the last few years. The boats are 17 ft Alumicraft with a 40hp 4 stroke Mercury. The motors are changed every three years. Nicest fish cleaning house I have every been in. The owners are very nice and attentive to their guests. I don't think you can go wrong staying at this camp.
540912,Guest,2004-06-17 10:26:00,0,We are going to Timberlane this season(first Lac Seul trip). I understand the concensus here is that Evergreen is nicer but do I need to be concerned or have concerns about Timberlane? Hope not.
540916,Rich J,2004-06-17 11:54:00,65,2 Dogs Did you make it up there yet? I left a little something with Gary to help you catch more fish.
540917,Mark R,2004-06-17 11:55:00,1538,Don't get me wrong I'm not knocking Timberlane cause I've never stayed there or dealt with them at all. I recommend Evergreen from personal experience.
540918,Guest,2004-06-17 12:03:00,0,That's cool Mark - had me scared for a second - so far dealing with Timberlane has been just fine and I am optimistic - can't wait to start hump jumping and stickin walleyes!
540920,2 DOGS,2004-06-17 13:29:00,361,"Thanks for the thought Rich, won't make it there until the 23rd and then without a boat! Very long, disgusting story. In a nutshell, the black motor boys couldn't tell the truth if it bit them in the butt! Oh, well, that's what I get for ordering one of those ""cheap"" motors! At least now they know I meant it when I said over 4 months is long enough to wait, there's fish to be caught."
540921,Guest,2004-06-17 14:00:00,0,"First time a Timberlane this year. I visited other lodges in the past. I see there is all kinds of talk about the cabins and boats for Evergreen vs. Timeberlane. Timberlane had clean and comfortable cabins. The boats were well equipped and easy to fish with. 40 hp or 25 hp motors - what is really the difference if the staff at the lodge is not providing great service. It really comes down to service. Poor service can put a damper on any vacation regardless of the equipment and accommodations. I have not visited Evergreen and I do not want to take anything away from them. I am sure they do a great job w/ their clients as well. However, I can tell you that any hour of any day, whatever we needed, the staff at Timeberlane was there. They really took care of us. The food was outstanding! Just a great experience. Getting to that great fishing spot a minute earlier really didn't seem that important after the first day. Dollar for dollar, the best value I have experienced in Canada. Dan W."
