Males are still up in the English River. Red Pine Bay (?) had some decent sized eyes (up to 23""). Highlight of trip was 8 Pike over 38"" in a 5 hr. period. Biggest Mama was 43"" and tipped our digital scale at 21.5#"
539618,Guest,2004-05-18 08:01:00,0,"Anyone fishing on Lake Minnitaki near Sioux Lookout this spring? This is just south and east of Lac Seul, which appears often on this site. We will be there next week, at a camp near Lyons Bay. Seems like it has been quite cold there, snowed last week, down near freezing most nights. I am wondering if the walleyes will be spawning yet. Have been there in August and fished 20 to 25 feet deep. Any tips on how deep to go at this time of year? One suggestion I have seen is to fish near (not inside) the fish sanctuaries. Also look for spawning-type structure, medium-depth rock reefs, sand bars, streams flowing into the lake, bays with emergent vegetation. Thnaks very much for any advice, and also to whoever runs the site. I enjoy it and have learned a lot from it."
539672,Guest,2004-05-19 09:02:00,0,RSH- i just returned last night from minnitaki- fished the opener may 15 - 17. was really surprised when we arrived on saturday at 5am and it was 24 degrees and 6'' of snow on the ground. huge cold front came through last week and they got a foot of snow water temps in the bays dropped 10 degrees and really through the fish in a funk. we had a real tough 3 days! did manage a couple nice fish- a 25 and 26 '' walleye and 2 20 lb. pike. email me at [email protected] and i can give some advice. good news is that warm temps should have the lake turned on again by this weekend.

540069,Guest,2004-05-29 00:14:00,0,RHS - How did you do at Minnitaki? You said that you were there in August in the past. We are scheduled to be there in Late june. Any advice on location this time of year? Haven't been there before that late in the summer - I'm hoping the lake doesn't have a summer slump like the lakes in Minnesota do! Shoot me an email at [email protected] when you get a chance. thanks

540134,scar,2004-05-30 21:39:00,196,heading up june 5 - 9. i have been logging on as don but i'm back as scar (had problems logging in) was up for the opener may 15 -18 but fishing was tough due to 12'' of snow and a bad cold front. one of our owners was up may 20 - 25 and he said fishing was excellent. fish were so thick in bays you could walk across them! we will hit minnicau creek hard as well as red pine bay even though it is a sanctuary and catch and release only.. 100 fish days are common this time of year and lots of fish over 5lbs. we own a cabin on neepawa island. it is located in the center of the lake and we are right next to a big log cabin that sticks out right over the lake. ours is tan with a green metal roof. stop in if you are on the water and there are boats at the dock. coffee is always hot and beer is always cold! scar(don)
540137,johnno,2004-05-30 22:32:00,4,"scar, I will be heading up that same week. Just wandering if you ever tried around the rapids -im thinking frog, the one near abrams I dont have my map handy so unsure of i am getting the location right. I do see alot of people fishing around there but we tried it but got snagged alot. If you do fish that area, what side do you fish on- lake wise, what bait, technique? any info would be helpful."
540143,Guest,2004-05-31 09:52:00,0,"Just got back Sat 29 May. We really struggled. Had two decent days (Monday and Thursday) on Minnikau Creek, caught walleyes & northerns in holes all the way up to the rapids. The Creek was fished heavily on the days with decent weather, maybe a dozen boats were in there on Thursday. By Friday (also a bright sunny day) it had slowed down greatly. Also caught a few walleyes in Mine Shaft Narrows. None were of much size, only got one fish in the slot the whole week, none over, although others at our camp did get some fish that were over. Another cold front came thru on Tues, even got a little snow on Wed. Those days we tried to catch fish on Lyons Bay near our camp, got just a few small ones. Marked some concentrations of fish near points in 10 - 15 feet but could not get hits. Our summer spots also had fish but they just sat there. All told it was very disappointing."
540167,Guest,2004-06-01 11:08:00,0,"johno,can't log on as scar again but here are your answers.we don't fish frog rapids because that time of the year the walleyes are in the shoot real heavy. since we have to go through the shoot to get to frog rapids we never had a reason to go because lots of eyes in the shoot area. if you try it, fish the abram side and either backtroll with bottom bouncers and crawler harnasses(spinner) use the 1 hook version and only half a crawler or jigs with yellow tails and 1/2 a crawler. fish tend to be good size here as lots are in the slot or bigger. good luck and have fun.i am leaving friday and can't wait. scar"
