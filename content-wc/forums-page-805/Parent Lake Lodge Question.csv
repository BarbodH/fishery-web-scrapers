541024,jale6666,2004-06-21 18:44:00,14,the launch right at the lodge is poor on the best of days. There is an excellent public launch about a mile up the lake (Cement and deep) If you plan on fishing the northern end of the lake there is also an excellent public launch about 22 miles up the lake. When are you going? jale6666

However, I am in the process of trying to convince our ""fishing family"" (about 18 family and friends) that we should make one more trip to Parent Lake Lodge for ""old time sake."" We have fished there many, many times over the years but have not been there for about 6 years now. (I have a trophy setting in my office for having caught the largest pike (32 1/4 #'s) of the year for 1983.) Any other specific info about the current accomodations will be appreciated. I sure would like to make at least one more trip to Parent Lake before I get too old to travel 1000 miles for a fishing vacation. jljlinda"
