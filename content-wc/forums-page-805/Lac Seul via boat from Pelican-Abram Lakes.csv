On the websites of some of the resorts/camps on Abram Lake they say they have access to numerous Lakes - Minnitaki/Abram/Pelican/Lac Seul included. Looking at a not very detailed map, it appears there are some rapids/dangerous sections,that may not be navigable - so I am guessing the access to Lac Seul is via trailering boats only. If it is totally boat accessible how far /long of a trip is it??? Thanks in advance."
541014,IaDave,2004-06-21 12:28:00,476,I have never gone into Lac Suel but I think they go thru Pelican Falls. I think if the water is high enough you just stay to one side away from the rocks-alot like Abrams chute.

Frog rapids is no proplem except when there is very low water. Also there are several good launch sites near Souix Look Out for Lac Suel (e.g. Hudson and Deception Bay). You can buy permits at the local bait shops and resorts. That's the way I have always done it. Beats the long boat rides. If you are renting a boat, many of the camps keep boats on Lac Seul for there quests to use."

Deception is only (?) 30-40 miles from Chanberlain/Wapeisi and other spots. For economical day trips you only need go as far as you want. Everyone going to the above spots passes over fine fishing. We have done well from Deception to Manitou just hitting points and watching graph for structure. We just get back yesterday from Chamberlain area and did very well on quantity but size was lacking (except for Northern). Many times we had both boats with fish on. TLY"
