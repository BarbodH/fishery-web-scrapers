I was going to drive from the NW Angle to International Falls or Grand Portage thru Canada. What things are there to do in between them areas as far as site seeing? We will be doing all are fishing on LOTW and leaving the boat there for a later trip. Just thought it would be fun for the kids to see more of Canada? The kids are 6 & 10 and they ride fine in the car. Any info would be great. Thanks in advance for the replies

Both Hwy 17 thru Kenora and Hwy 11 thru Fort Frances have some great scenery but you have to look for things to do. If you go thru Fort Frances be sure you have a full tank of gas when you leave because its a long way between stations as you go East. Have fun Mac
