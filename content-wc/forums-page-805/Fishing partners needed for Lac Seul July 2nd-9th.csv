541133,Guest,2004-06-24 13:43:00,0,"I am in need of 2-3 people to fill a cabin on lac seul for the week of July 2nd-July 9th. I have been going to a resort south of Ear Falls, (Onaway Lodge) for the last 6 years but family members and friends can't go due to different circumstances. The cost is approximately $500/person if 3 fish out of a boat. This does include most gas and minnows for the week although we do quite well with artificials and night crawlers. It is a great resort with great owners with the best dock and fish cleaning house I have seen. The cabin sleeps 4-5 but 3 are needed to get the cabin. I will be pulling my 17' Tournement Pro with 115 Optimax and would sure like it if there is someone who would consider. Let me know if interested...I sure would hate to miss a year on Lac Seul. Good Fishing and Best of Luck[email protected] or call me at 641-585-5184"
