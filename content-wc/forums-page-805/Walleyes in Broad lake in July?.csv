540799,Guest,2004-06-16 07:06:00,0,Went to Lac Seul for the first time last year. Stayed at Scout Lake resort. Great fishing trip!! Was going to do a little more exploring this year & always here everybody talk about Broad Lake. Was wondering if this is only an early spring location or can you catch fish in July in Broad. I'll be fishing Lac Seul the first week ok July. Thanks for any Input.

We caught fish, but the lake is not a secret or a spot I would run that far again for. That time of the year you can fish Ghost Narrows not as far good fishing. There are a few rocks in the river to watch if you decide to hit broad Good Luck"

541006,Guest,2004-06-21 10:27:00,0,I have been going to Scout lake in August for 8 years and always fish broad lake. We always catch fish there but no more then anywhere else.
541027,Guest,2004-06-21 19:53:00,0,"If Broad Lake is the lake attatched to Sunlight Lake then I have been there several times and caught a ton. E-Mail me for three spots that we always caught fish at. One spot was the best walleye fishing spot I have ever been to for 17 to 23 inch fish. Nothing real big but we caught hundreds. [email protected] I also stayed at Scout Lake Resort, but was unhappy with the cabin and owner. Fast troll large Rapala's (Number 18 in red/gold) just outside of the weeds on Scout Lake and you will catch a ton of larger walleye and pike. Just keep making circles and you will catch a few."
