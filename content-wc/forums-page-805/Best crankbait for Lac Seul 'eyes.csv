I've gathered a lot of info from this board, but I have one question: #1 crankbait to pull for those big hens? We'll be up for a week, and plan on spending at least one full day dragging nothing but big stuff for the larger ladies. Any input as far as type/color from the people that have gone before me would be appreciated!"

Shad Raps work just as well, but I like how the Husky Jerks suspend. We did not troll but tossed cranks on wind-pounded points and shores and did well on the active fish....IA Walleye"
