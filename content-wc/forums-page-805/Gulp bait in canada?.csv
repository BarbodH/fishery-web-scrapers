Many fish with equal success and in some cases better than live crawlers. Got some watermelon color this week and will be using them over the next few weeks at Lake Opemiska and Lake Wetetnagami in Quebec. A single gulp worm will catch many fish, just remember to follow the storage instructions. Overall I find the product to be more economical than live bait and much easier to handle. I'm not big on using live bait anymore - too much hassle keeping fresh on remote trips. I'm also using the 3"" Power Leech in two colors black and pumpkin. They have also taken their share of jigged fish. My results with the Berkley products are as good or better than what my fishing partners are getting with live crawlers & leeches. There has been a ton of posts on Gulp here at WC - a search will produce a bunch of info."

I've posted a couple of questions looking for Rainy Lake info on the Red Gut area (latest fishing info), but no answers. There has to be people fishing the area. Do you have any answers? Please e-mail me at:[email protected] Will be at the ""Fisheries Resort"" next week. Thanks, John"

541102,Guest,2004-06-23 09:59:00,0,"Used some Gulp last week in a tourney with interesting results. I put on a black grub on a jighead and started pitching. First cast resulted in a 3 1/2 pound Rainbow, 2nd cast landed an 18 inch walleye and the 3rd cast with the bait was a 5 lb Northern. It seems to work with all kinds of fish. I didn't use it the rest of the tourney because we switched to bottom bouncing. Am planning on getting some Gulp worms to use on bottom bouncing rigs."
541104,McQ,2004-06-23 11:14:00,615,"Scotto, try a grub on each hook of the harness - you'll be surprised how effective it is when bouncing. Just nose hook the grub."
