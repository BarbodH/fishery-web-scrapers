540971,BuckeyeATC,2004-06-19 21:21:00,88,"Just wondering if anyone has any experience with using solar panels for their cabin? Any info would be helpful. We just bought a cabin, it has gravity fed water and propane stove and fridge. Would need solar panels to run lights and minimal household items. Also could use advice on a hot water heater. Are there any helpful websites out there?? Thanks in advance."
540973,idapaul,2004-06-20 09:12:00,82,"we used solar panels designed to charge batterys on sail boats and 2 batteries and car lite bulbs. had to chop down a couple of trees to get sunlite to roof in right areas. we only used camp on weekends and it was enough. used a car stereo and 12 volt tv. you also should be able to run a small water heater on propane. we never did that though. we had the option of regular power but did not put it in due to cost of installing poles, about 10,000 dollars. if we used the place for a week we would run low on power but we built our own generator with a car alternator and horizontal shaft lawn mower motor. run that for an hour a day and charge the batteries back up. all in all it worked pretty good."

But I am fortunate to have hydro on mine. E-bay has solar panels all the time. I bought one to keep my boat batterys topped of in the wintertime, that works OK."

541025,Guest,2004-06-21 19:23:00,0,The cabin we stayed at last week had solar patterns for the water heaters. The cabin has 2 water heaters and the the panels kept it very hot. Don't know anything about it other than that.
