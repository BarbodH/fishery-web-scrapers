I had always suspected that there was a way to do this without going through an outfitter, and paying $1000 or more USD. I called the district MNR office, and requested a ""non-resident application for a certificate of accommodation"", they mailed it out to me in the states. This left me somewhat confused, so a series of calls to the MNR, and finally talking to a conservation officer yeilded the following. 1)Complete the form, incomplete informantion wiil not be accepted. 2)Provide a copy of the deed for your property. 3)Provide a copy of an old hunting license.4)Provide a noterized affidavet that you are the current property owner. 5) Pay the non-resident license fee<$165 CND>. You then get a non-resident license good anywhere in the Wildlife Management Unit your property is located in. Good during the non-resident season <sept 15-Oct30>?? for that years hunting season. Apparently a similiar process can be followed for deer hunting. Since I already have a PAL to get my rifle into Canada and hunt with it, my next hurdle is to ""import"" it back to the USA through customs. So far they tell me this is not an easy thing to do. I may have to pay a dealer with an FFL to ""import"" it back to the states. Then there is ""importing"" the bear down to the states as well. Figuring this all out sure stirs the ""cabin fever."""

Theyve had no problems getting theyre guns back into the states after registerring them at Canada customs. They just check the numbers on the firearm and are sent on theyre way! All you need is an export permit for the bear around $30-40 and I believe you can get them at any place that sells hunting lic's."
