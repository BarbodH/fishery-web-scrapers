The guys that I am going with have been going there for quite a while now and they just swear by it. I will be taking my own boat. Would be interested in hearing your recommendations for some other lakes close by. I might want to try a different lake while I am there. I like to use my early trip to check out different lakes. You can e mail me at [email protected] Thanks."
527663,Fishing Junky,2003-02-25 09:51:00,182,"Try Kilvert also. Can access Kilvert by a river system that flows into Dogtooth. Dogtooth and Kilvert are awesome lakes to fish. With a little time and effort, you will have a crack at the fish of your lifetime. Good luck, Junky.................."
527654,Mike KS,2003-02-13 07:01:00,18,"I have a friend considering Dogtooth Lake in Early June. What works best there and how is the fishing in early June. I have heard that the average Walleye on Dogtooth are small but it does yield some nice trophys. All help will be appreciated...Thanks In Advance, mike"
527655,Guest,2003-02-13 16:01:00,0,"If your friend is considering dogtooth I would consider someplace else. I have read positive commnets about this lake. When I fished it a few years ago I would rate as the worst fishing of my twenty or so Canadian fishing trips. I would look up around Minaki, Tetu around fishing is mare consistant. If your friend is stuck at dogtooth, try leeches and split shots at night. Good luck if he is looking for a guide."
527656,Guest,2003-02-13 16:29:00,0,"Stories around Kenora indicate that Dogtoothe is one of the best trophy lakes in northwestern Ontario. Supposedly though it is clear water and very hard to fish in certain conditions such as bright calm days. If you are looking for the fish of a lifetime and not much in the way of numbers, then worth a shot, but if you are looking for numbers, eaters, and trophy potential then maybe not the best choice."
527657,Guest,2003-02-13 17:16:00,0,Never fished on dogtooth before....but i heard that there are some pretty nice muskie in there. A friend of mine stayed at a place called Ross's Camp last june he said the walleye fishing was very good and he said he caught a pile of smallmouth too.
527658,red2,2003-02-13 18:35:00,16,"Mike I took my girlfriend there a couple years ago and we caught alot of walleyes. They didn't jump in the boat but we didn't have a hard time catching fish. We were there over memorial day week. Also caught some nice small mouths, not a lot of pike thought. Yes leeches and night crawlers. Tim"
527659,Guest,2003-02-14 15:20:00,0,"Dogtooth is one of those deep, clear Canadian Shield lakes. It's very infertile and doesn't give up big numbers of walleye. During the summer, the best fishing takes place on points & reefs when the sun starts to go down. Big fish...yes. Numbers...no. By the way I've heard there's splake (brook & lake trout cross) in this lake. Anybody have any success on these?"
527660,Guest,2003-02-15 17:15:00,0,"These posts don't sound very encouraging as i have a trip planned to dogtooth in July.Does anyone know if a lake map is available for this lake, and if so how do you obtain one? I have tried almost every avenue I know. thanks"
527661,Guest,2003-02-16 09:45:00,0,"Mike, Is your friend taking a boat up with him? If yes, I know a couple of great walleye lakes up the road he can drive to for a day if D.T. isn't producing. Post your e-mail address. JJ"
527665,walleye6,2003-02-16 16:59:00,60,"I just returned from the Duluth Sport Show and attended a seminar conducted by Butch Furtman. He spoke of Dogtooth and mentioned if you want trophy walleye, this is the lake. He also mentioned it takes a lot of work and hours to accomplish this. Bottom line-nice fish if you want to spend the time to do it!!"
527664,mknoll14,2003-02-24 04:42:00,4,"Dennis, I spent a week last summer camping at Rushing River Provincial Park at the northwest edge of Dogtooth Lake. The fishing was very good. My wife and I pitched fireball jigs tipped with minnows at rip-rap rocky shores that was receiving the wind and would catch 10-20 fish daily, but what was really memorable was finding a horde of crappies suspended over about 24 feet of water and working that school for a couple of hours. Dogtooth is a barbless hook only lake, so I just cut the barbs off of a couple dozen jigs. Rushing River Provincial Park also bans lead, so if you fish that part of the lake, use Land-O-Lakes tackle bismuth jigs. I have a map I will send to you - email [email protected]"
