528030,Mike KS,2003-02-25 19:23:00,18,"Send me your $50 and I will send you my collection of Crank Baits that I have used at Lac Seul. I will replace hooks as needed and break out the old touch up paint. Even if you dont catch any fish with them you will at least know that I did.......Go with Shad Rap SRO7 or SRO9 in colors 6,11,23,25 and 56 Bass Pro Spring 2003 Master Catalog page 158. Our group has had great success with these.My personal favorite Color 11...Good Luck"
528031,Karl,2003-02-25 20:46:00,63,"I totally agree with Mike. The #7's work well both casting and trolling in <10 feet of water and the #9's are great trolling over reefs and narrows. Blue/Chrome, Perch, Shad colors.I also agree with River Rat. I've had some 50+ days and lost several each day (fishing English River rapids).Remember, the price of a #7 Shad Rap is about $5.50 here, but is about C$16.00 (with the 15% GST/PST taxes) in the bait shops in Ontario."
528032,chrism,2003-02-26 14:08:00,429,If you buy at wallmart or canadian tire they are only $6.99 - $8.99 cdn plus tax. Much more expensive at remote lodges. In my experience there are a few things that are cheaper to buy in Canada than the US (I've only been to Cabelas and Scheels) and cranks are one of them.If I'm not mistaken US residents can get their tax refunded upon presentation of receipts at the border.Chris
528033,Mike KS,2003-02-26 14:24:00,18,"If you order them at Bass Pro you will probably have them within 72 hours. This is better because you can do like I do and keep putting them in different trays in your tackle box or hold them up to the light to see how they glitter, (my favorite) tie them to your cranking rod and pull them through the aquarium to see that awesome action. I do have a recipe for Angel Fish......Dont quibble over a dollar on something as important as a crankbait ...just get them and start planning your crankbait strategy and dreaming of those Hog Eyes."
