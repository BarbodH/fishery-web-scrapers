528070,McQ,2003-02-27 10:19:00,615,"When I get the opportunity to fish clear waters I adjust my presentation to cover off natural colors, by this I mean rigs that are tied with salmon red beads and quick change clevises. My go to is nickel blades then pink, blue and sometimes white. I'll also use smaller blades in clear water. Varying trolling speed until I hit it right, I tend to move slower - just having the blade flick rather than spin. If I know for sure that the forage base is a certain minnow or if perch is predominant I will use bead colors that emulate their patterns. I'm a firm believer that a spinning blade creates a halo effect and bead choice can be critical. Others will insist it's blade color only but IMHO it's the combination that makes for a hot rig.I'll lindy rig night crawlers and/or leeches on a float and I'm also a believer in Berkley Power Worms for a harness especially watermelon & neon patterns just remember to have a few harnesses tied with #2 hooks - you'll need the larger gap.When jigging I tend to use smoke colors and the browns or greens in plastics. Smaller bodies work better for me usually 2 - 3"" grubs or 4"" minnow shapes. In Quebec we can't use live minnows and fishing with frozen or salted varieties have just been a hassle so you soon become proficient with plastic bodies."
