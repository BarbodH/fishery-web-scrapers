527890,Guest,2003-02-25 11:23:00,0,I have talked with several Ontario resort Owners because I had an OWI back in 1983. Basically they all said you should have no problem IF the offense was over 10 years ago. There apparently has been some legislation to that effect but it still is up to the discretion of the border guards. There is a government agency that you can apply (well ahead of time) for a waiver but it costs a couple hundred dollars. I'm sorry but I don't know the agency name. This may not be much help but its the best I can do.
527891,Guest,2003-02-25 12:04:00,0,I personally know someone with an OWI that was checked at the border and could have gotten through if he paid about $300 extra.You can get through unless they check you and you have one you will be asked to pay or can't get through.I would recomend calling and getting the scoop before hand ratherthan take a chance at the border. I beleive you can pre arrangeyour crossing.Good Luck
