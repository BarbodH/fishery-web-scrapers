We go in the middle of June each year and need a break from the Winnipeg River. You can email me off the board if you'd rather do it that way. We are strictly catch and release so not to worry about limits and sizes. Thanks everyone.

After you have passed the Pickerel Lake turn off which goes to the left ,it is about a 10 minute ride and on the right hand side of the road you should see a short road (1/2 a block) to the PelicanPouch boat launch. On the left hand side of the road there is a clearing for parking cars.Cygnet LakeJust before you get to Minaki there is a left turn off that takes you past Pistol Lake and heads to Caribou Falls and the White Dog Indian Reserve. Off this road you can get to Cygnet Lake which has excellent Walleye fishing."
