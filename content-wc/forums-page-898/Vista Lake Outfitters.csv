527549,Guest,2003-02-10 11:57:00,0,"I stayed with Vista Lake 2 years ago.Would recommend it to anyone.Our group of 8 had the island cabin and it was nice,plenty of room.The large screen porch was great.It had a large restaurant grillright on the porch.We did all our cooking out there.The lake isn`thuge so it doesn`t get too rough.The fishing was good.Hope this helps."
