528012,IaDave,2003-02-25 09:55:00,476,Its looking more & more like another late thaw this year. Heading to Sioux Lookout for the opener and hoping the ice is out by then. Anybody ever got caught opening week in Sioux Lookout with the ice.I know last year it was late also-around May 10th I think.

528014,Karl,2003-02-25 11:53:00,63,"Last year the last ice in the Sioux Lookout area went on Friday, May 17th - the day before opening. I was there pike fishing from the 12th and left on the 17th. Friends I talked later in the week said walleye were still in pre-spawn areas 35-40 feet down and very slow to bite for opening day. Not to worry this year though, ice will be gone before May 1st."
528015,Bruce,2003-02-25 11:57:00,48,"It is impossible to have any remote idea at this time when the ice will go out. I live in northern WI and we have about40 inches of ice now which is more than normal, but if the weather changes fast and we get warm weather and rain the ice could be gone here next week even though the norm is April 20th.Anyway I'm going to Packwash Lake (Canada) the 2nd week and amalready wondering when it will go out up there but it's too earlyto even talk about till April. Last year ice out on Packwash wasabout 2 weeks later than normal.I watch the lakes in my area closely each year anticipating ice outand 90% of the time these lakes will go out within a couple daysfrom year to year. Last year was an exceptionally late.Good Luck!!"
528016,Karl,2003-02-25 20:55:00,63,"This is a significant El Nino winter. I've been fishing NW Ontario for 11 years, and each of the last two major El Nino years produced a very early ice out, so.......wajors??????"
528017,Guest,2003-02-27 10:25:00,0,"Ice is as thick here NW ON as I have ever seen it. Forecast is below normal temps next week. My guess is at this rate we are looking at late ice out. So much for global warming. Good thing Canada signed up for Kyoto treaty, eh?"
