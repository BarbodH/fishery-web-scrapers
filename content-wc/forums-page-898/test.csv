Any pic's with animation, should be saved as a .gif file. Some hosts will auto-convert it to a still picture if it's a.jpg. It will generally look better as a .gif too."

If you are in the know of what I should do the advice would be appreciated."
527981,bigfish1965,2003-02-28 08:07:00,3210,Email me the original file and I can host it for you on one of my sites as a .gif. I'll email you back the URL for it. [email protected]
