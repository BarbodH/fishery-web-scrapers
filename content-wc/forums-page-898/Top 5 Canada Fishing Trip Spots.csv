526395,Guest,2003-01-30 23:15:00,0,"I have fished all over Wis, Minn and Onatario for 35 years. Far and away the best fishing year after year is in the Lac Seul area. Lake of the Woods is a great smalley factory but for Walleye and Northern is LS. Also, the big advantage is it is a drive in lake. You may be able to find a little better fishing if you want to drive farther north, pay more money or fly somewhere but that all costs time and mulla.If your interested in knowing more just email me at [email protected]"
526396,Guest,2003-02-21 09:17:00,0,"Try Caviar for smallies, Lake of the Woods and Lac Seul for eyes, Woods for muskies, Lake St. Joe for northerns. The Woods is every bit as good as the Seul but it's just that people don't know about the great comeback of the old girl. Plus she has bigger fish"
526397,bigfish1965,2003-02-21 22:50:00,3210,"Okay...this will sound silly, but I like to push my hometown whenever I can. Hows this sound... 15 pound walleye, 7 pound smallmouth, 30 pound musky, 40 pound salmon and 25 pound rainbow trout. I've caught one of each of these and bigger, right here at home. I rarely go anywhere else unless I'm looking for a more 'Northern' experience. Plus, if you get tired of fishing, theres a million more things to do. We're an hour from Toronto and five minutes from the NY border. Welcome to the Niagara Region. www.niagarafishing.net"
526398,McQ,2003-02-22 08:45:00,615,"I have to get my licks in for my home area too. For those of you who can afford the time and a little more expense take a look at Quebec - there are unlimited opportunities up this way that would impress any fisherman. Big water reservoirs and lakes that are very well served by some of the best outfitters in the business, natural camping in huge provincial parks for those who like to rough it a bit and all within a few hours of Canada'a capital city Ottawa."
526399,bronzeback77,2003-02-22 14:46:00,97,"Lake of the Woods is the place to go. I have been up six years in a row and plan on going every year until the day I die. The place to stay is White Pine Lodge, the place is awesome and the owners are great. Check out their website at www.whitepinelodge.caCabins run 275 per person for Housekeeping plan for a 7 day stay ( if you bring that many people) and 725 per person for American Plan. My wife and I can catch over 100 fish per day, Walleye, Smallmouth,Crappie and Pike. You can also catch Largemouth, Lake Tout and Musky but not in as large of numbers. And we both enjoy relaxing, drinking some beer and watching the sun set in the evenings. You can contact me at [email protected] if you have any questions. www.whitepinelodge.caCheck it out, it is awesome, I drive 17 hours from St. Louis to get there and it is worth it, only 90 minutes north of Intl Falls."

526385,Guest,2003-01-12 10:44:00,0,"Sounds like this is the the place to ask. A group of dedicated fishermen from work are trying to plan a trip to Canada. We number from 6 to 20 depending on the year & season.(spring/fall) We have fished the Northern Wisconsin lakes: Plum, Lac Courte Orille,Chippawa Flowage, Plum, Mantawish Flowage,Star,Long,,Tomahawk,Namekegon to name a few visits over the last 10 years. We origionally wanted to go to Lake of the Woods, or Rainly Lake that wer close to the borders 7 would take our own boats. We want to go to a place that the fish jump into the boat & We want to be to the point we are tired of catching fish. So, We cut out early & drink some beer Walleye, Northern & Smallmouth tend to the primary fish. If all of you have experienced a few places in Canada. Give us a list of Lakes & lodging you liked.(Genral cabin prices too if you have a guess-cabins of 4 to 6 would be great) Top 3 or Top 5 would be great & resons why you liked them. If we go way up we'll probalby rent boats, but you never know. Thanks in advance"
526386,Guest,2003-01-12 10:56:00,0,Oops; Should have added; Location Looking for: Ontario & within a 150-200 or so miles of the border. is my best guess to start with Jeff s
526387,Guest,2003-01-13 12:05:00,0,"I know the perfect place for you!!!! (And its only a five minute boat ride from fort frances, thats just across the border from international falls.) You need to go to campfire island lodge. It is located on Rainy Lake, the best smallmouth fishery in north america according to al linder. You automatically get guides that know the water very well, and get to cruise the lakes in 20ft Lund ProGuide Boats with 75 hp Honda's. Its a great place and you will catch a lot of huge smallmouth. I've been there many of times, Dean and the rest of the guides will do everything to make you happy. Enjoy your trip. Call (807)-274-9500 or go to there email address and www.campfireisland.comTell them CoonCain sent you."
526388,Guest,2003-01-13 13:57:00,0,"Jeff,Mahkwa Lodge on Lac Suel if your looking for a place where the fish jump in the boat. Were went late July last year and caught hundreds of walleye and some really nice northern; 4 between 17 and 20 lbs. The last day it rained so my son and I went out only a few hundred feet from the lodge and caught over 100 walleye. Much to my dismay the kid has decided he doesn't want to go back there because catching so many fish is boring so we are headed to Rainy Lake this year. He figures it will be more of a challenge.One last note, the fishing is great but the cabins so-so. Best Reagrds"
526389,Vitreum,2003-01-13 14:45:00,221,"jeff, lac seul is the only freshwater place that i truly got tired of catching fish. i've done it in the atlantic, but never freshwater. i fish for walleye exclusively. if you want to fish for pike, they will wear you out before lunch. truly a fantastic fishery. any lodge will do. some are better and costlier than others. remember, you are just sleeping there. i fished the chippewa flowage about 10 years ago. believe me, it will be like night and day. absolutely no comparison. there are also a lot of other good lakes in that area."
526390,Guest,2003-01-14 13:12:00,0,Try Buena Vista Resort on Lake of the Woods. We can handle large parties and enjoy it. The website is buenavistaresort.com
526391,Guest,2003-01-15 19:50:00,0,"Try Bonnie View Resort on Lake Kashagawigamog in Haliburton. Good food, accomodations and fishing. 9.9 and 14ft aluminum, mountain bikes, use of workout room and sauna included in the price. Rooms have fireplace, whirlpool and fridge. Food at the main lodge is awesome and the owners are the tops. Chef will prepare your catch for dinner if you wish."
526393,Guest,2003-01-16 13:53:00,0,Lac Seul is where you want to go. You can drive to it and the lake is large enough so you can always find a spot of your own. I have fished all over Minnesota and the only thing that even comes close to Lac Seul was last spring/early summer on Mille Lacs. That might have been a once in a lifetime bite but Lac Seul seems to be getting better each of the past few years. There are lots of resorts with various price ranges. Hope this helps.

526394,Guest,2003-01-30 22:43:00,0,"If you are looking for the best multi species resort in the area, check out Happy Landing Lodge.
