527717,Wally,2003-02-21 22:39:00,38,"100,000 CA....isnt that like $300 Amercian??? NOT A GOOD DEAL"
527718,nemio,2003-02-22 03:23:00,96,"Exactly 64,514$ U.S money. Still not to bad; but we got medical care, prescriptions are a lot cheaper etc...And we also as a prime minister got the best: Jean Chretien!"
527719,Wally,2003-02-23 20:33:00,38,Whoa man....We got Jerry Springer!!!!
527720,Hunter,2003-02-23 21:14:00,346,Jean Chretien the best?? I really hope that is tongue in cheek!! We need him and all his liberal crooks out of office!
527721,Guest,2003-02-25 14:04:00,0,"I'd like to fish with Jean Chretien preferably in a very deep lake, I guarantee that I would practice catch and release."
527722,nemio,2003-02-25 14:25:00,96,Yes good idea catch & release but you release it with 500 pds. of lead in his pocket.
