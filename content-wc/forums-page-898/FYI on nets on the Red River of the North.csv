Netting takes place in lakes right on our door step more and more often and it is deamed by the native community as their right to feed themselves. Their doing it only to pi## us off. I always thought of the natives of Canada as thetrue conservationists of the land, in the last 10 years or so they have been rapers of the land. Using one inch gill nets to fish withis screening nearly all fish out of our waters. Moving reefers on semi's in to areas and cleaning the moose population out in a week.What respect I had for the native population in Manitoba is going quickly just like our fish stocks. If we have to respect the treaty rights of the native then restrictions need to be placed on the catchment of these resourses. No nets, us a hook and line. Three in a hunting party, not a whole tribe. But the same old thing, we need politicians with some kahoonas tomake a stand and stick with it. If not our fisheries and wildlifestocks are going to be so depleted we might as well sell our fishing equipment our registered guns and buy our meat and fish from the Natives."
527431,Guest,2003-02-07 13:51:00,0,Seems to me that the RULES of the game need to be revisited. It was fine that the Persecuted were allowed to take game freely but dont they get checks from the Goverment for just being persecuted. Maybe its time to adjust the compensastion and supply true opportunitys for education and good employment and housing and medical care. We all need to work together to save the inviorment and the species that inhabit it. There are too many examples of how man through his lack of vision has declared laws that have dessimated Gods gifts. This is another one.

527433,Guest,2003-02-07 14:43:00,0,Eddy...Its a matter of poor laws and poor politicians. The law should be protecting the resource for all the peoples good....its always about inequity on both sides.
527434,timeout,2003-02-07 15:27:00,28,"truly a topic of hot debate. The problem here is that it is political in nature and natural resources are too scared and useless to enforce the laws. Case in point, in the article from the free press referenced, the wife of his partner stated that they GIVE people fish for $20 DONATIONS. Anyone with half a brain knows that this is a sale and is illegal and not subsistence fishing, which is their right.If you want to get right down to it, one has only to look at the political map to see where the ndp draw their support down. While i quite often question the intelligence of our politicians, they seem to know enough not to bite the hand that feeds them, in this case at least. The local mla knows that without the support of elsie and the others at the local ""friendship centre"" he would never get reelected with the changing demographics in that particular riding.Native rights are a topic which HAS to be addressed to ensure a healthy and vital enviroment, but anyone who suggests this runs a strong chance of being branded a racist and losing all credibility. We can not even get natural resources to enforce the existing status quo(see case in point above)This particular case is even more complex. A lot of the aboriginals left in the selkirk area belong to the peguis band. These are people who stayed when the government relocated the ST. Peters band to Peguis. There is little doubt in my mind that they were all screwed when forced to relocate. These locals, according to the ones I know, do not get any support from the band and therefore this is not like LOP where the band could be approached and negotiated with. I doubt very much that Chief Louis S could be negotiated with and given the past history(relocation etc.) who could blame him? It is quite a mess with the federal government responsible for establishing treaty rights and the province enforcing the game laws. The solution to this will have to political in nature, pulling and burning nets is not the answer, and with this particular A****** anyone messing with his nets take a real chance of inflaming the situation and escalating it further towards violence."

527451,Guest,2003-02-12 00:00:00,0,"If we were to take the, ""turn the other cheek"" approach and pretend that gill netting without restrictions on a ""World Class"" sport fishery was ok, could we honestly expect the resource to remain intact!If any one thinks along these lines you would have to be pretty naive.I'm not saying that aboriginal treaty rights don't have merit, I guess what I am saying is if aboriginal people need a ""few"" fish to maintain a healthy existance by law they are entilled. For many, many years there was an old aboriginal man who placed ""A"" gillnet in the Red River and harvested a few fish for substance. Nobody ever said boo over this because the vast majority of the angling public was totally unaware of his activities. Besides those of us that were aware never batted an eye simply because the old man only took a few fish for his immediate family. It was an extremely low keyed affair and nobody gave it any thought!However times have changed and there's new players involved in the aboriginal community who feel that the resources belong exclusively to them! The message that they are preaching is ""all"" resources belong to the peoples of first nations. These resources are there for them to exploit however they see fit, no exceptions, no compromises!Over the past year or so, certain idividuals from the aboriginal community have taken extreme measures to try and get their views across. They've gone as far as to threaten peoples well being and personal properties. Last spring one of these unscrupulous individuals not only uttered threats to a legally licensed comercial fisherman on Lake Winnipeg, he also threatened the mans immediate family. Told him to get off the lake it belonged to the first nations!It's only a question of time before this situation reaches the boiling point and the situation gets totally out of control. Surely common sense can and will prevail!There's a sad irony here and that is the radical approach of so few can make an entire nation look so bad. The vast majority of aboriginal people that I personally know, completely frown upon the actions of these radicles. For them it's becoming a national embarrassment. They simply do not support or condone these actions.Please remember that we all have to live together on this ever shrinking planet, it's resources are being taxed to the limit. We have to work hard together in order to protect ""OUR"" resources, if we do work in harmony our resources will remain intact for generations to come. There's little room for compromise!Fish ""Hard"" Forever!"

No one group or individual needs special protections when it comes to wildlife, that is a shared resource. When free nations carve out societies, that is exactly what happens, societies get carved out.How many of us look on the water at someone and see a caucasion, an aboriginal, an oriental, a fat germanic/viking guy with small glasses and a goatee etc. How many of us simply see a fisherman?If that person is stringing a 2 mile gill net, I simply see someone I don't think very highly of.When I see people ignoring the issue, in the US or Canada, because of political sensitivities even when they have the responsibility, I simply see a bureaucrat who should be replaced.Wasn't it the Native Americans and Aboriginals we give credit to in our schools for ""stewardship"" of resources.

527464,Guest,2003-02-25 23:35:00,0,"Today I phoned the MB Dept of Conservation and was directed to someone in Fisheries. I didn't catch the name of whom I was talking to but I asked about the netting situation on the Red. The individual doing the netting is being monitored closely. Unfortunately he is using 50 yard nets staggered down the Red. Of course the ""traditional"" right to hunt and fish is in the Charter.I stated that the Charter does not supercede any treaty or the BNA Act, and in every treaty that I have read there is a sentence or paragraph that the tribe or people will obey the laws of the crown and its successors and of the ministers appointed on behalf of the crown. But no one seems up to the task to enforce this point.I also stated that the word traditional has to be defined, does it mean that ""traditional"" means with the technology on had before the white man came to this continent? If white man's technology is used, white man's rules apply. When the word ""traditional"" is invoked by native leaders or representatives in a discussion, it seems that further discussion has to cease because the word ""traditional"" transcends all sense of logic and understanding that the non native cannot comphrehend. But it is a handy word for self appointed ""hereditary"" chiefs to hold on to power on the tribal council.I further stated my ancestors hunted and fished for sustenance. My ancestors (Scandinavian) raped, pillaged and plundered, but I don't uphold those ""traditions"".The gentleman also stated that there are problems with ""new"" Canadians and their ""ignorance"" of the rules and regulations. (But a well place phone call by cellular, while fishing, works wonders and believe there are lots of calls being made and a lot of tickets are written.)In the end I think the gentleman was taken aback by my verbal assault and hopefully has something to think about."

527455,Cat Eye Outfitter,2003-02-17 16:36:00,9,"I'm sending this one into the Media to see whether they believe it is news worthy:Lauren McNabbGlobal NewsGlobal Television NetworkWinnipeg ManitobaHi Lauren: Just thought I'd drop you a note to bring to your awareness an interesting issue/debate that is currently raging in Manitoba, Minnesota, North Dakota and other parts of the U.S.The controversy I'm referring to is the ""State of the Red River"" (and other bodies of water in Manitoba eg. Lake Winnipeg). The Red River (just north of Selkirk) is being netted at the moment by an aboriginal fishermen. There were two articles in the Free Press recently about the situation: One from the perspective of the nets (Which have been strung in a staggered fashion right across the river) perhaps doing harm to the fishery especially to the trophy class fish that many people come to fish from all over the world. The other was about the aboriginal who is doing the netting.Let it be simply put the netting issue has become very contentious. There are three different web sites/bulletin boards (one Canadian and two American) that are witness to how heated the argument has become about this issue. Have a look at the following sites to see how much of a problem this issue really is to a lot of people:http://members3.boardhost.com/fishmanitoba/ (Canadian -Manitoban/Provincial in nature)http://fishingminnesota.com/cgi-bin/forums/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Red+River,+Ot ter+Tail,+|AMP|+Bois+de+Sioux&number=16&DaysPrune= 60&LastLogin=(Minnesotan based -- but based on the Red river to the south)https://www.walleyecentral.com/cgi-bi...wmode=threaded(US based Walleye Central)Moreover there are a couple of other issues that have been either not reported upon or have been forgotten by the public: Firstly the raw sewage spill that occured last fall in the Red River and The problem with ""phosphate loading"" in the river and how little or nothing is being done about it on the Canadian side of the border. A large amount of work has been done on the US side to reduce phosphate being introduced into the Red but little of nothing has been done on the Canadian side. Another part of the debate is related to recent announcement made by Manitoba's Conservation Minister, Steve Ashton regarding fines that would be levied to those who buy or sell fish illegally and for those who net or destroy nets. I am guessing that his announcement is somewhat related to the netting controversy on Lake of the Prairies and Dauphin Lake last year as well as that which is occuring on the Red at the moment. Many of the nets that have been placed out on the Red have been poorly marked. On Lake of the Prairies some nets were even burned last year. The problem, however, is that the issue is far more complex then just increasing fines already in place... There aren't enough Conservation officers to give out the fines/or enforce the new rules in the first place! Just as an aside Lake Winnipeg the 13th biggest freshwater lake in the world has only one resource manager while Lake Erie the 12th biggest has around a dozen!Looking at the issue/debate as ""NEWS"", I'd suggest that it could be dissected into a variety of segments (I'm not presuming I know your business but consider the following): 1) Firstly there is a National issue from the perspective of aboriginal rights of one man to net for subsistence on a river that has major economic and touristic value for many more Manitobans. This one needs to be dissected with a view to what has happened recently in Manitoba in this respect. eg. Lake of the Prairies and Lake Dauphin were netted heavily last winter resulting in net burnings and lots of tension. Inky mark has been quoted in the House of Commons as saying this was a situation that could become another Burnt Church N.B.. if something wasn't done to remedy the situation. I for example have my guiding business on the Red and if the present controversy continues I'm afraid many people aren't going to want to fish the Red - because the fish won't be there! 2) The issue is also international in so far as it involves a river that flows from the US to Canada and fish do move south from Canada to the US. Many American anglers/guides to the south are very much concerned that Manitoba isn't holding up it's end of the bargain when it comes to looking after the resource. There are a lot of tourism operators in the US who depend upon a healthy movement of fish to the south --- this won't occur if already mentioned difficulties continue.3) Then of course there are the issues of pollution and harm to the environment that is at once national and international --- Winnipeg dumps raw sewage into the river everytime the storm sewers overload with a heavy rain, never mind the spill of last Fall!. In addition to the latter, don't forget to add in the controversy of the further development of the Garrison diversion and the planned bleeding off of water from Devil's lake. Basically one of our greatest natural resources ---water--- is being left to fend for itself. We all know what the latter idea of natural resouce management ends up in..... disaster. 4) Then there's the crisis that the whole lack environmental stewardship has wrought upon Manitoba's wonderful fisheries.... Don Lamont has written about it recenly in his column in the Free Press, basically there is reduction in monies, enforcement and overall planning with regards to our resources. If we're not careful we may have a situation where rivers will not have fish or people won't be there to patrol/enforce laws in place. Take a look at what a few tough environmental decisions have meant for the salmon fishery in BC. The province's salmon resources have bounced back quite nicely and to everyone's benefit.5) And finally I'll bet there could even be a human angle of looking at a person like Stu McKay of ""Cats On The Red"" (Lockport) perhaps one of Manitoba's most recognized outfitters who make a living on the Red Rivers and its ""fish"" resources .... He's got plenty to say about the issue and is in the process of planning a co-management team to make decisions on what should be looked at to keep the Red a vibrant and healthy legacy to Manitoban's who will follow ...... I'd also like to hear what Conservation Manitoba has to say about the situation (although they really can't say much for fear of political reprisal).Involved; Yes, but I feel not enough is being said or reported to the public, or what is being said by officials is being directed at people(the general public) who really don't know what is going on. News worthy stuff; You bet. The sad part about all of this is that it might be a situation where we might be saying after the fact, ""I told you so....!""Thanks very much for your time. I hope to hear from you about anything you might be able to bring to the public regarding this issue. There are certainly a lot of people interested in what a bit of ""light"" might bring to this situation.Sincerely,Dan Kiazyk"

Native commercial fishermen have alot at stake in regards to this fishery and it will be them to straighten this guy out.After a prominent native leader made some very racist and anti-Semitic remarks (including Hitler was on to something), the Canadian people are starting to get fed up with the native issue.The definition of ""substinence"" needs to be further defined and enforced.
