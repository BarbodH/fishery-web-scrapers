527935,Guest,2003-02-25 17:02:00,0,The truth is that the center of the universe is Toronto. No one in Canada is like them nor could they never rise to that lofty responsibility of being the greatest. Their attitude is like that as well. They are also a team player in that they will call in the army anytime they have a major snowfall just to let us know that they know how the rest of us rural peasants feel like.
527936,McQ,2003-02-25 17:38:00,615,T Mac as a resolved sovereign Canadian I do all I can to be happy and with my naturally bubbling personality have managed to convince sufficient numbers of my dour faced neighbors to reconsider their positions. Montreal is now officially a friendly city but the pretender National Capital-Quebec City may take me a few more months.

527940,Mark_NE,2003-02-26 18:45:00,58,"Hi Bigfish. This is probabaly not the right place for this post, but what the heck, I wanted to reply to you personally. I have been a reader of the posts on Walleye Central for some time and finally registered today so that I could be more involved. There have been some great posts on this site that I have taken advantage of both from a fishing and philisophical approach and I have to hand it to you, your posts and replies have been among the most interesting. Although I may not always agree with you, you have stated your opinions very well, so I just want to compliment you. Also, your country is great and you are right to be as proud of it as I am the USA. Perhaps sometime we can share the water in both our countries and fish like there is no tomorrow.Mark_NE"
527941,Mark_NE,2003-02-26 18:51:00,58,"On the above post, forgot to Login, rookie you know."
527942,bigfish1965,2003-02-26 21:42:00,3210,"Mark; I thank you for the compliment. I simply try to lend some balance to most situations. You are always welcome to share a boat with me and tie into some hogs. We got some real beauties up here in the Niagara Region and if you're ever going to be around, email me at [email protected] . Okay..for once I'm at a loss for words! All I can say is, I don't have to agree with a man to respect him. As long as he believes in himself and what he stands for, but is willing to listen to others, what else can you ask for?"

I apologize for any of us Americans that are as you see us but I think its obvious that after your comments that each side of the border has its share of ignorant,inbreed,uneducated,dickxxxxs.I have been fishing Canada for 47 years and can honestly say I have never had a bad experience with anybody who resides in Canada. But I havent met you so there is still a chance of having a bad experience."
527926,bigfish1965,2003-02-25 09:55:00,3210,I think Canadian guy was using sarcasm as a method of pointing out the absurdity and obviously inflammatory design of the original poster.

527931,Guest,2003-02-25 11:45:00,0,"No. That is not an accurate generalization.I have spent hundreds of days in Canada in my life. The Canadians I know (Western Canadians) are the friendliest folks I have ever known.What you need to remember is that Canada is a different country. It is different than the US. It has a different history book, different customs, traditions, holidays, and expressions. Americans need to take a little time and learn about Canada and once there, try and fit in, instead of expecting the nation of Canada to instantly turn into ""America"" just for you. Be observant. ""When in Canada, do as the Canadians do"".Be a good guest and you will be in for a fun time!"

527909,Hunter,2003-02-22 17:37:00,346,"BigFish well put!! I live in A border town and I hunt and fish with Americans every year. Ive informed them when a good bite is going on,or new fligts of birds are down! They have invited me to there spots and also notify me when a hot bite is going on or a certain area is giving up good numbers of waterfowl. Now if any of us were being jerks to each other, we would not be as succesful as we are! Heck I know for a fact there is a couple Americans who have put several pounds of perch filets in there freezers this winter because I gave them a tip on where to go! And they have put a good number of geese in my freezer! Works both ways,, you wanna be a jerk to me im going to send you on a wild goose chase and laugh about it the whole time and I dont care where you are from!"
527919,Vitreum,2003-02-22 18:09:00,221,i grow sooooo weary of these types of posts by both yanks and canucks. what purpose do they serve? i like canadians. nice folks for the most part. i like them lots better than most new yorkers or new jersey folks.
527910,Guest,2003-02-24 08:46:00,0,"Fish, I agree. We fish Dog Lake near Wawa every summer. With only a couple of exceptions (and I think they were just drunk) Every Canadian we've encounterd has been just great. I also have to say that almost all the Americans I've met there have been great, too. It's always that 5%. Doesn't matter whether they're Canadian, American, whatever. By the way, when we laugh. We are not laughing AT you. It's more WITH you--in a neighborly way. At least that's true with our group. Also, many (if not most) fishermen on this site would love to be able to spend a lot more time in Canada every year. I, for one, will not participate in a battle between Canadians and Americans. We have too much to offer each other. Let's keep it civil, Guys!My two cents worth, Trout."
527920,DLH,2003-02-24 13:02:00,1,"Been to Canada several times and in my humble opinion, wish I could be there even more. Have always been treated well and felt that the people were glad we come to Canada. Fact is, many of our U.S. operators should take lessons from Canadian operators. Bad apples exist everywhere, and at least in the camp we go to, once discovered are invited NOT to return. This is as it should be, regardless of which side of the border they choose to live on."

Maybe bring your friends from Red Lake with ya!I love Red Lake and am counting the (88) days until my next visit!- Rick"
527921,Guest,2003-02-24 19:32:00,0,"Grrrrr....... I don't see a lot of Americans where I fish. They have been turned off by the fees and the hassle of camping on crown land. They are notorious skin flints. The ones I see are mostly poor with old trucks and bad teeth. They can't afford proper medical or dental care. They are mostly extremely overweight and their kids are rude and unruly. They drink way too much and will take and keep any fish they catch. They definitely don't look like the TV Americans you see. The best looking ""Americans"" are actually Canadians. Theres something in the American gene pool that makes them like that I think."
527922,Todd_NE,2003-02-24 20:55:00,1330,"Hey! I resemble that overweight remark. I think it's the gravy on the fries that gets me.:)I can pronounce assiniboine thoughTYup, got her... feel that head shake!"
527923,Ivy,2003-02-25 07:14:00,556,"Looks like the author got a response he was looking for.Bad teeth, bad health, poor, fat, unruly kids and an old truck?Well, let me tell you a story my Canadian friend, it's a story about an American. An American named Jed. He is just like the "" American "" you are describing. Well one day ol' Jed who was poor and who could barely keep his family fed, was out hunting for some food. Jed missed his prey but hit the ground and out from the ground came bubbeling crude, Texas tea. Oil that is.Have you heard this before? After Jed found his oil,Jed became an instant Millionaire. His Kin folk told Jed that California is the place he oughta be. So Jed loaded up that old pick-up truck ( you know the ones all us Americans drive ) and he drove to Beverly, Hills that is.See what I'm saying? Ivy"
527903,Guest,2003-02-21 19:25:00,0,"After spending a little time here I think I see a picture forming. Canadian anglers, some anyway, 1) do not like resorts owned by Americans 2) do not want Americans fishing their lakes 3) and will pounce savagely on any Americamn Lodge/Lodge owner that says anything. Cool by me, if I ever go to Canada I will make absolutely sure to stay at a lodge Owned By an American. Fire away....."

527906,Guest,2003-02-21 20:17:00,0,"I stay at a camp owned by Canadians. There are not many people who are nicer and friendlier then they are. The people who work for them fit in the same category. I have never heard them complain about Americans who are guests or Americans who own competing resorts. (I have seen them post on Walleye Central) When I am at the bait store or restraunt, the Canadians are very friendly.The only people who are rude in Canada are fellow Americans who think they can only catch fish if they are casting exactly where you are. (I have to vent or a second, please excuse me) Last year we were working our way around a point casting toward shore, when this boat comes in and anchors right in front of us. 20,000 acres of water and countless miles of shoreline. While there might be a couple of native Canadians who are sour apples somewhere, they are not where I go. I definitely run into more bad apples (they are not only sour, but bad) that I run into while fishing my home state of Wisconsin.Fritz"

527907,bigfish1965,2003-02-21 22:41:00,3210,"Canadians are a different people, with a different culture and set of values. As a nation of incredible ethnic diverstiy and tolerance, we have come together to form roughly an identity. This identity, while somewhat vague and changeable, reflects an ideal we all cling to. Often times the greatest threat to this identity is perceived to be the United States. With it's 'super sized' everything, the US comes on a little strong for us sometimes. We often find ourselves criticized for our way of life by our neighbours to the south. While we welcome visitors from your fine country, we hope that while here you treat our country with the same respect and admiration you would have us do in your land. About 30% of my customers are American. 95% of them are great people with a true appreciation for what we have to offer. However, the remaining 5% ( and a very noisy 5% it is ) are incredible pains in the butt. Don't get me wrong, lots of Canucks are a pain too, but I would expect 'company' to behave a bit better than the locals. Maybe this is unfair but its how we behave when abroad, so its what we expect in return. Those noisy few come across as arrogant know-it-alls who complain about how backwards we are and how our conservation laws are too restrictive or our taxes too high( yet these two items conserve our outdoors which is why you came here in the first place.) Occasionally an American gets arrested violating those laws and are caught with a large stash of illegal fish. This plays big in the media and adds to the fray. Canadians prefer a quieter lifestyle. We are careful listeners and willingly and readily accept everyone into the fold. Many of my fondest chilhood memories are of fishing in the Kawartha Lake district and camping beside a goup of 20 or so guys from Ohio. Nightly campfire sing-a-longs and bull sessions went well past what was a suitable bedtime for a young lad like myself. But I will never forget those guys. One of them taught me to play the fiddle..sort of.We went fishing each day and had a blast the whole time. Thirty years have gone since then, yet the lesson remains. If we focus on our similarities and treat each person as an individual, there is never a problem. Fishing brings us together and is a universal calling. Each day we are bombarded by American television and politics. We know our neighbours far better than they know us. Next time you're up here, just sit back and listen and watch. Maybe after all we have learned from you, we may have something to teach you in return. And if you see me camping, there's always an extra beer ready for you."
527908,AL,2003-02-22 05:38:00,89,"Bigfish,Even some of us Americans get tired of the ""super-size"" everything enviroment, bs politics, etc....I, for one, look forward to my Canadian fishing trips more than anything else during the year. You are correct, if we just listen and observe our Canadian friends we would envy their lifestyle that much more. I have always been treated fairly and with respect while visiting Canada. 84 days and counting....."
527912,Guest,2003-02-22 06:44:00,0,"You better get your eyes checked. My Dad and I have been going to the same lodge in Gowganda, Ontario for the last 7 years. You couldn't ask for nicer people. That's one BIG reason that we keep going back every year. Everyone we have met, has treated us like family. Makes no difference if we are Americans. We have made many true friends. So I don't know what you're talking about. I can ""see"" you're just trying to stir up trouble."
