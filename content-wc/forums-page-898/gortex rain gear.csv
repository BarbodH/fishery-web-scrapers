527732,chrism,2003-02-23 18:44:00,429,"There's no free trade on clothing (or at least guidewear) - been there done that! Duty still stinks!I do agree though - get the guidewear! There's nothing close to it in Canada that I have seen that is this beefy - besides, the Guidewear price works out to be competitive(MEC) or cheaper than (TNF, Sierra Designs, Patag.) the gore clothing available up here."
527736,Guest,2003-02-24 06:13:00,0,Cabela's Guidewear is #1!!!!!!
527733,retire55,2003-02-24 08:28:00,1029,Chris:My interpretation is that there is free trade on clothing made is the USA but not on clothing made somewhere else but sold in the USA. I did a little research on this as I too was interested in Cabela's Guidewear and wondered whether I have to pony up the duty. I ascertained that Cabela's Guidewear is not made in the USA and therefore I would have to pay duty.

527734,chrism,2003-02-24 19:20:00,429,"10-4 on that. Almost everything they sell is made offshore - even North face stuff . And yes, you have to pay duty - I want to say 20% but don't hold me to that - I'll see if I can find my billChris"
