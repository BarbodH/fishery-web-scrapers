528056,Guest,2003-02-27 07:30:00,0,"Shad Raps have been around since the early 80's and are probably the best walleye bait for casting or trolling. Many big fish are taken using these great baits. You can virtually use a Shad Rap under almost all conditions. They are effective down to about 29' without some sort of device to get them deeper. I used them casting right up into the boulders on the LOTW, you just have to nurse them out slowly as they want to dig in, however if you get hung up, just relax the line and in most cases, they will float to the surface. If you learn how to use a Shad Rap with finese and versatility, you have gone along way to enhance your fishing skills."

528058,Mike KS,2003-02-27 08:43:00,18,Al....I havent used the new WALLEYE color yet ....but I have four new ones in my tackle box and they will get wet this year. Im sure they will work great just like all the rest of thier different colored Shad Rap cousins.
