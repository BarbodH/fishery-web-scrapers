526877,itry,2003-02-25 11:41:00,78,"bruce bwill definitely get with you on the beer, not sure which cabin we'll be in. can't wait to get there, my boy is asking how much longer about every other day."
526883,Guest,2003-02-26 05:39:00,0,"I forgot to mention in my earlier post that I was talking to Jerry last year and he told me the Canadian MNR people had been doing some netting on Cedar Lake to get a census on Walleye, and Jerry was asked if he'd help. In 3 days, they netted way more walleye than they expected, (healthy population) with the largest weighing in at 18.5 pounds!"
526878,Guest,2003-02-26 11:17:00,0,"ITRY:My son is all fired up too! We went to the Madison Fishing Expo this past weekend. I ended up buying 2 rods, 2 reels, and Eagle fish locator, several lures, about 50 jigs and three bags of fish batter... By August I'll probably have more gear than Bass Pro Shops!"

526868,Guest,2003-01-23 21:13:00,0,has anyone been there? thinking about taking my son for his first canada trip there.
526869,Guest,2003-01-23 22:35:00,0,"Price is right, cabins are mediocre, as is the fishing in general. By today's lodge standard, boats are mediocre. Alot of lodges on the system for not that big of a lake. If you can get a bigger group together, try and rent the 5 bedroom house. Don't get me wrong, some nice fish are popped on the Cedar/Perrault Lake, but alot of dinky ones in between. Maybe drive 25 miles further and check out Lac Seul."
526870,nitroman,2003-01-24 08:28:00,368,"A group of friends and i go to cedar point resort on cedar lake every year and we have always had a good time. we are pulling walleye up to 20 inches plus all day long with the occasional trophy, pike from 25 inches on up alot of small mouth and some musky too. if you want to catch fish i think you would like it"
526871,Guest,2003-02-21 09:19:00,0,Mediocre at best
526872,Guest,2003-02-23 07:15:00,0,"I have been to Jerry and Ellie's, and I think it would be a great place to bring your son. Our group typically only goes to fly-in or boat-in outposts, but tried Cedar Lake for a change of pace. The cabins were very suitable, well equipped and CLEAN. The boats, motors and other equipment were kept in pristine condition. You won't find harder working, or more concerned camp owners than Jerry and Ellie. Great people. No one has mentioned the Musky population in this lake -- outstanding! The FIRST fish we caught (after being on the water all of about 10 minutes) was a 30"" musky that jumped about 4 feet out of the water. Caught several more that week - no keepers, but we had follow-ups that resulted in underwear checks!Caught lots of walleyes, smallmouth and of course northerns. We also caught HUNDREDS of 10"" -15"" perch. Great place to bring a kid because it's well run, clean, safe, and there are other things to do beside fishing. Hope this helps!"
526873,Guest,2003-02-23 10:21:00,0,"I booked for the first week in Aug. Know it's not the best time of summer, but was all they had left open that fit my schedule. Anyone have any tips for that time of year? Any specific lures to take?thanks"
526874,Trailerguy,2003-02-23 12:56:00,1407,"My guess is that the eye's will be deeper, say 20' due to warm temps. and bright days. Jigging with live bait will probably work best, but if you can find a shaded point or other structure they may be shallower in the evening and early morning. By then baitfish are plentiful and the eye's don't need to be very agressive to stay full. I'm sure the lodge will know what has been working and where. I've never stayed there but everybody always told me they are good."
526880,nitroman,2003-02-24 23:40:00,368,I talked to the guy that runs cedar lake lodge this weekend at the des moines sport show and he said the same thing walleyes will be down around 20ft near rock faces and such says they have the best luck jigging with a sky blue jig tipped w/a minnow
526881,Guest,2003-02-25 09:34:00,0,"do any of you have a web address for the cedar lake,i can't find it.thank you"
526875,Guest,2003-02-25 10:40:00,0,I booked there for the first week of August also. I am taking my son and it will be our first trip to Canada. I talked with Jerry & Elly at the All Canada show in Madison a couple weeks ago. They seemed very nice. We are looking forward to the trip.
