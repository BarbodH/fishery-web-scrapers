527877,Guest,2003-02-20 18:21:00,0,Just bought acreage on Dinorwic lake because it fit most of the requirements I had been looking for. Now the question to you informed readers is this. How is the fishing in this lake chain and what remote lakes in that vacinity are good? Have always fished North of Kenora in the past. Plan to relocate on Dinorwic permenately in the future. Thanks for any insite.

Not a fish left within 50 miles.Tell you what I'll do though, I'll take that property off your hands for a couple of thou if you want to dump it. You can even throw in the boat and motor if you like.Actually Wabigoon lake is real good. Haven't fished Dinorwic, but it should be just as good. Lots of smaller lakes in the area for almost any species you like and of course, the Hudson launch on Lac Seul is only a one hour drive. It's a great area and I hope to move back there myself some day."

If you go down the channel toward Wagiboon there are 2 islands in the middle of the channel by some private homes. Fish the northern island, it is rocky and snaggy on the north side, weedy and better on the south side. I never go by this island without stopping for at least 1 pass. Turtle pond will produce nice Northerns in the mouth on spoons and spinners. Once inside the south and west wall have produced 27 to 29 inch Walleyes.Minnehaha, I have caught or been with others who have caught 4 1/2 lb Smallmouth, 20lb Northern (Jigging for Walleye) and nice Walleye all at the base of the falls. Fish the east wall below the falls in the morning for walleye. Once the sun hits the east wall they shut off.Most of the islands in Dinorwic or Wabigoon will produce at some time or another. Both of these lakes are shallow lakes with lots of weeds and rice beds and produce a varity of fish.Good luck, I'm sure you will find many more places which will be your favorites."

Are you going to be living up there for the summer? If so I would not mind getting together, spending some time sharing stories. I am currently scheduled to be there the first week in Sept.
