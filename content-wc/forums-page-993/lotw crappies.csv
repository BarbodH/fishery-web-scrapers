515200,PJM,2001-10-13 17:12:00,3516,S.F.I was up there the weekend of the 6th and the crappies we caught were down by Thompson Creek. The whole shore line on that end of the lake is where they were. We found most them in 27 to 30 feet on water but you had to move around to find the school of fish. If I was to go up there now I would try Hay Island if there is not alot of wind. When I was there it was cold and windy but the Thompson Creek area was calm.
515201,jazzman,2001-10-15 10:22:00,13,Just got back from LOW.I was there Oct 11-14. Crappie action around Hay Island was slow. Had to work hard to get a few. Thurs(oct. 11) there were about 8-10 boats around Hay with some action.Friday and Saturday (12-13) was slower with fewer boats and fish caught.I think the season is a bit early compared to last year when I was here and action should pick up. Good Luck.
