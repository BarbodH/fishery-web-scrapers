514256,Guest,2001-08-30 18:07:00,0,"Well I might as well put in my 2 cents--I've been going to Canada for over 40 years and as I recall, I've been pulled over 3 times and it was no big deal. If you act like an a__, they'll treat you like an a__. Customs officials are there to do an important job and the only information they have to go on is your license plate number and your responses to their questions. As far as the Canadians are concerned, I haven't met one I didn't like - well except for the driver of a logging truck that forced me off the road--that was in '59 and I'm still looking for him:) Everyone up there has treated me, and anyone I've taken up there, as another sportsman. You have to figure that there are miserable Canadians as there are miserable Americans. I will also say that last year I talked to some Park Police and they told me that they have more problems with Canadians than they do with Americans as far as trashing a place and illegal catches are concerned. Just my opinion."
514254,Guest,2001-09-01 15:43:00,0,"Off the subject a little. Was in Manitoba last year, as the previous 6, fishing Clearwater and Rocky Lake. Motor problems sent us to The Pas (really it was motor probs, not the Alluette). Got a speeding ticket on the way in.(oops)In a hurry to get to the bee.....I mean mechanic. Sent a check after returning home but the check has never cleared. Called the RCMP in The Pas and was told that they do not issue warrants for speeding anymore. I told the very friendly and hilarious officer that I would still like to take care of it. He said he would give me his home address and please send cash. Kidding of course but he was a card.Was given other #s to remidy and also his direct line. I have been going up there for 6 years and others in our party since the late 60s when most that road was gravel. Very few bad experiences and none that would ever keep us from returning. A true pleasure and always treated not only with the utmost respect, but like family. Thank You Manitoba.Jack, Ken,Sonny, and the rest of the Alluette crew, we will see you all on the 14th.Colorado Steve"
514235,Guest,2001-09-04 21:03:00,0,"Several states here in the good ol USA also have the chain clasp law. And it can be enforced, even if your state does not require such a device. Most times you will never have a problem, but cheeze off just one trooper, or get wrung in a speed trap and watch them add on the violations. Get Stainless steel, self closing Carabeiners like the mountain climbers use, and be done with it. I got mine at the local hardware store and they are weight rated so be sure to get the proper ones based on the weight of your rig. The tire inner tube dealy works too and I have seen similar rubber doo hickeys as standard equipment on some brands, Ranger was one of em."

Not with Northern Wisconsin, Minnesota and lake Erie or saginaw bay. I can find big fish or the total rustic experience here. But I would never begin to critisize another country for their rules. You go there, it is their soil, their rescources and their rules. Ya dont like it? Then dont go. I may go there someday, and if I do, it is their laws, I will have to deal with it. As for the beer argument, if it is commercially processed in huge batches, and then pasturized it is all swill to me. I don't care what name is on it. Sure I can name several brands I will drink, and can enjoy. But, when a high quality import or micro brewed Beer, dark beer or Lager is available, baby I am there!!"

By now everyone on this board knows you had a bad experience in Canada! If you had a problem with an outfitter up there, your beef is with him not with the entire population of Canada. If you didn't like the border officials, you'll have to take that up with them, again, not with the entire Canadian population. Guess what? I didn't think my first resort was all that hot either, so I found another one. I've since met people who love the place I left for good. It's called differenet strokes for different folks. Deal with it. Your constant posts about your bad experience and trying to argue your way past everyone else's GOOD experiences is getting quite tiresome. Give it a rest already!"
514246,bigfish1965,2001-08-24 19:51:00,3210,"Well hawgtracker..the reason I made the post in the first place, was to advise my fellow anglers about differences in the laws between our two countries. As a 'tight assed Canadian', as you so eloquently put it, let me say this. If you don't like it, stay out. I for one won't miss you. And I'm sure your fellow Americans would appreciate one less 'Ugly American' travelling the world perpetuating the stereotype. It's our land, not yours, we make the rules, not you. Maybe if your conservation laws were better, you wouldn't have to come all the way here to find some left-over wilderness. And if you think our border guys are rough, try crossing the border into the US as a Canadian. Same deal, bud. For the rest of my American friends, can't wait to see you guys again. It's much quieter the farther you get from Hawg tracker. And btw guys, I'll supply the beer!!;-)"
514247,Papi,2001-08-25 05:21:00,13,"What you guys drink is an ALE not a beer.As far as the poor fustraded lad complaining about our border personel and ""tight ##### canadians"".

Something should be used twice as much !!! Go figure."

As far as the border- the last several years, the American side would qualify as rude and unfriendly. I love Canada. Especially the rye whiskey and Labattas!!!"
514252,Guest,2001-08-25 06:08:00,0,"Leaving for Canada in 6 days. In the 12 times i've crossed the border, only once were we checked. My wife and I were going to Niagra Falls and they opened the trunk of the car and looked through a couple of suitcases. They were polite and courteous and didn't ""tear apart"" the car. Hey, they were just doing their job. You Canadians don't have to worry about Gofish being an ""American Slob"". I bring back everything I take with me in the bush. The only thing I leave out there are the fish, to be caught and enjoyed another day. Catch & Release. Try it, you'll like it!!!"

Ill tell you what, give me your address, Ill send you some money to stay home! Thousands of people wouldnt come to fish here every year, if we were all thieves, and we didnt have something to offer. Did you ever think that you had a bad time at customs because of your attitude? My wife is a customs officer and I here it every week, some fool gives her a hard time. And guess what, they are immediately sent to secondary inspection. She suspects there is nothing in the vehicle illegal, but you give her a rough time, she is going to make your life miserable! It happens on both sides of the border, Ive been stopped and searched also. But these people are doing theyre jobs in a hot little box, smelling car exhaust all day, how much would it take to pi** you off in this situation?As far as the firearms, no one has come to take mine away. We have to be licenced to own one though. Its just the same as waiting for police clearance to buy a weapon in the states. Maybe you should get your facts straight before making a comment like that!"

514248,Guest,2001-08-28 05:56:00,0,"Guys,All this talk of beer has me going.All brews are either top fermenting ale's or bottom fermenting Lagers. The lagers are fermented longer at lower temps producing a smoother crisper beer. The ales are brewed at a higher temp producing a beer with a generaly fruitier finish.The only other difference is how long the barley is roasted (color and some more flavor) and the amount and type of hops.Beer is barley malt, water, hops and yeast. How much and what type of each has produced the varety of beers we enjoy the world over.Generally, beer should be served near the temp it was fermented. Lagers about 40F ales about 50F. Cold temps are refreshing but numbs the taste buds. Do not sip, a good gulp covers the entire pallet and the carbonation adds to the total experence. If you have a good one the chug reflex will kick in and the whole thing will be gone before you know it.My favorite, the one I'm having with my freinds, regardless of where the beer or the freinds are from.Best regards,BrewhunterPS All things in moderation, clean up after yourself and be careful so we can all enjoy another cool one."

514228,Guest,2001-08-21 13:38:00,0,"Why oh why do I start...American beer outsells Canadian beer 9:1 in Canada? Assuming you are correct (and we all know what happens when you assume) it would still only be American Brand beer that outsells Canadian beer... even your ever so popular Budweiser (go figure, huh...) that sells in Canada is still ""Canadian"" beer... 5% and brewed in the Canadian style... still doesn't stand up to the standard ""American"" brewed beer.As for your other points, I think the majority of people here disagree with you and your assinine comments, so I'll just let that be... American beer better than Canadian... <GRIN>S."
514229,Guest,2001-08-21 14:09:00,0,"Funny..that the only thing you disagreed with was my comment about the beer (and in fact, I think that you really did agree that Bud outsold the stuff you call beer).I think that I have cracked the code tho....I suspect that most of the replies (even some of the intelligent ones) come from Canadians.I understand your pride...we are all proud people...proud of our heritage, our country and even the cars we drive. I am not the only one in the states who holds these views. It is easy to say...""if you don't like it stay home""...certainly I won't take that advice but I will stay out of Canada as long as the officials of your country treat even one person as trash. All...every single one of my party of seasoned, respectable, honest, hard working, fishermen who were looking for a better place to fish were totally turned off. Not one will fish Canada again. That means nothing to you folks economically because somebody will take our place but I caution you that if they treat us like that...you are next! Where do sportsmen draw the line? When they tell you that fishing is prohibited? They've taken your guns away already...what now?I suggest that someone coming from your country to ours will be treated with more welcome than we were."
514230,Guest,2001-08-21 15:04:00,0,"It goes both ways my friend... The reason I didn't respond to the rest of your comments is that I don't get into pee'ing contests on these boards... my original comments were mostly made in a lighthearted manner... my point was that even Budweiser in Canada IS Canadian beer - made by Molson. it's certainly not imported from the US. We Canadians take our beer pretty seriously.. <GRIN>Everyone I know who comes from the US and follows the rules and regulations of our country seems to leave having had a wonderful time - I would say this is at least 95% of the people. The one's I find complaining are the ones who feel that the rules are not right, and so prefer to make their own. You know what's strange though? I hear the EXACT SAME THING from Canadians who cross into the US and break their rules.The bottom line is that in some of your posts, you paint all Canadians with the same broad brush based on what appears to be a single bad experience on your part, or on heresay from others. Spend some time (at a different lodge, obviously) meeting us, talking to us (not DOWN to us), and soaking in the Canadian atmosphere... there isn't another thing in this world like it, eh?"
514240,Guest,2001-08-21 20:57:00,0,"About that beer?! A what beer. All of you don't know what a beer is all about!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!There is not even a one brand of beer, which I can drink in Canada. US ""beer"" should never be named beer, at least it doesn't taste nothing like it. Budweiser? What Budweiser? Have you ever tried a real Budd? Canadian or American Budd has only the name of the famous old European Budweiser (Germany), now that is a beer. As you might know the Czech people developed beer. Pilsner is real king of beers. That is how all beer should taste alike. I am not saying Pils, and only Pils but all that beer alike products of................... should not be named beer because it is not even close to what original beer taste like.Thank youBy the way, I'm Canadian and going to the states (I mean crossing the border) gives me creeps. You guys are jus is bad to us, so don't complain. As per your (Hawg Tracker) comment about the limits-, I witnessed how the few guys pulled 3 coolers fool of perch from the boat with OHIO numbers on its side. Now you tell me what I should think! I know there is no limit on perch but 3 coolers!!! Give me a break!!!!!"
514231,Guest,2001-08-22 11:27:00,0,"Maybe you're right in some respects...I too resent being painted with a broad brush like the comment about ""talking down"" to Canadians...I don't, and neither did my party. I think Canadians are hyper-sensitive to the Yanks percieved wealth.I originally listed my post to honestly ask the question ""Why fish Canada?""The answers I got back were...""I am proud of my beautiful country""..(OK so am I...so what?) (or) ""I love to see the Bears and eat a shore lunch""...(OK so you can't see bears in N. Wisconsin or Minnesota?)(or) ""we really love the people"" ....ok well...(we have nice people too.)...bottom line is if we had a bad experience with the border officials and the fact that the lake was drained and our trip was ruined...nobody in Canada is going to lose any sleep......yet!

514242,Hammerhead Herb,2001-08-22 15:03:00,259,"First of all, that Budweiser is a Czech beer not a German beer. Please visit http://www.budweiser.cz/.Secondly, I'm from Illinois and I think that Labatt's is great; it's the only beer that we WANT to drink when we fly out of Ear Falls, HOWEVER I love MGD (we had German guests from the Kiel area and they specifically wanted to drink MGD) and Pete's Wicked Ale. When I was in the service, I even thought that San Miguel was very satisfying. Concerning staying only in the US, I fish in Canada and Lake Vermilion in MN, but I'm from Illinois. Using some of the logic I read hear, I should just stay out of Minnesota and stay in Illinois. Luckily this is a free country and I (we) can go where ever we want."
514243,Guest,2001-08-22 15:56:00,0,Sam...The Egyptians and Babylonians developed beer over 3000 years ago. Those Bohemians from Pilsen who developed the bottom fermenting golden lager or Pilsner could never have done it without German help. They had the yeasts that allowed the process to continue.
514244,Guest,2001-08-22 16:31:00,0,"OK I did not know as much about it. I still think that US Beer should be in fridge named differently, definitely not ""BEER"". By the way, very interesting story about those Egyptians and Babylonians. I'll look in to it for my own interest."
514245,Guest,2001-08-23 08:45:00,0,"Sam...on that we agree...anyone taking that much fish from any body of water is being wasteful...wasteful like the tribes in the US, spearing Walleyes in the Hayward area and leaving them on the shore...wasteful! But if you are using that extreme example to justify the oppressive fish limits place on everybody by your government...it doesn't fly. As far as Beer is concerned, I don't ever drink anything that looks the same going ""out"" as it does coming ""in""...never touch the stuff!We have as a society always joined together in bad times..war, etc. My gripes are meant to make Canadians aware that we DO wish to fish and enjoy your country and it's benefits but, we are not a society of ""Dirty Americans"" who are bent upon ruining your land...we want to enjoy ourselves when we come up...that means treating us as paying house guests...not as burgulars.If we ""soil' your land...close the borders to sport fishermen...let the residents of Canada support your resorts."
514222,bigfish1965,2001-08-02 20:37:00,3210,"Hi guys and gals; Just two quick things if you are planning to visit our beautiful country. Remember that culling is illegal here. Rarely enforced, but illegal nonetheless. Also, recently some government lackies have been trying to nail people on a old regulation peretaining to trailer chain attachments. We all use the common 'S' hook like you guys, but some police and border cops have been interpreting a rule that state the hook must be used such that it may not be accidentally dislodged, to mean that you have to use locking clasps. Now most of us laugh at these guys when they say that, but you guys aren't really afforded that luxury, being out of your own country. Just a quick fix will help. Cut a 3"" by 5"" piece of bicycle tubing. Make a hole in either end. Feed the hook through one end. After hooking up to your vehicle just slip the other hole over the end of the hook, and voila... Tight lines!!"
514223,Guest,2001-08-03 15:06:00,0,You would think that the Gov. of Canada would step in and stop this kind of funny law. The people from the U.S. are just trying to go on vacation and have good time and bring lots of $$$ to Canada..Maybe we should stay home for a year or two and see if that might chane the thinking of these people...we just want to fish and spend a few days of looking at the great outdoors that Canada has... Hookman
514224,Snag,2001-08-05 17:57:00,78,How about the cost of booze and smokes up there? That alone should deter half of us Americans from ever going there.

514239,Guest,2001-08-20 22:32:00,0,"Hookman:What do you think happens when a boat trailer gets loose from the towing automobile. If you are lucky the tongue slides along the roadway and gets sheared in the process or at least unable to be hooked up again.If you are not that lucky the tongue digs into the pavement and the trailer rear lifts up and over onto the towing automobile and at the very least injuring the people inside as it comes through the roof. (weekest part of a car or truck)By the way, Those chains are supposed to be crossed. So that the chain from the left of the trailer fits to the right of the towing auto. That way if the ball fails the tongue will cradle itto the crossed chains. Better than having it land on the roof of your car at 65 mph.Dave"
514227,Guest,2001-08-21 10:52:00,0,"Isn't that kinda' what I said in my previous post (see ""Why fish Canada"")? These tight-assed Canadians think that we are children who deserve to be parted from our money and should be watched so we don't soil their land and steal all their fish. Why not just close their borders? They could have all the fishies to themselves and wouldn't have those boorish ""Yanks"" to contend with.Maybe they'd like it if we just MAILED our money to them....God knows they don't have much themselves.I know there are a lot of good folks living up there and my complaint is not with the average ""Joe"" (except for one resort owner) but I have a problem with their officials...those border folks who think we're bringing contraband up there and drive our SUV's with unsafe ""S"" hooks...come on! Give me a break!. These are the same folks who banned guns in Canada...could you ever imagine the uproar in the states if the ""Gunaphobes"" ever got their way? And the Canadians laid down for it!As far as American beer is concerned one guy replied that he wouldn't drink US beer if it were free...ha ha...US beer outsells Canadian beer 9:1 IN CANADA...Seems that his neighbors don't agree. THey don't have to worry about our group stealing their fish.Wanna' catch fish in a FREE country...fish Minnesota!"
