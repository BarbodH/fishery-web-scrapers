Any body have any suggestions? Also I was told by someone that I could bring nitecrawlers into canada if they were packed in moss. I was always under the asumption that no live bait could be brought across, am I wrong? thanks to all who reply.Lane"
515179,Guest,2001-10-03 13:41:00,0,Crawlers are allowed if packed in paper bedding or moss. TGG

515181,Peanut,2001-10-03 14:28:00,929,"Crawlers are fine, so long as they are not packed in dirt. Artificial bedding is the safest choice. Other live bait will likely not be allowed across. derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"

Minnows, crayfish, leeches etc. The possibility of introducing a non-native or infected species is the reason. However worms are okay. I don't know why anyone buys worms when they are free in your yard, but thats another thread, I suppose."

I guess never assume everything you read, Sometimes the weather is so cold you almost have to troll, I will be geared up for both tactics, good luck"
515184,Guest,2001-10-07 19:24:00,0,"Thanks for the feedback fellas. We Stay at a place in Steven's Bay, near Young's Resort. The last time I was up there in the Fall, casting cranks over, in and around rocks was the only way we could raise a fish. Usually am up there in the Spring chasing eyes in the weeds. Where are they this time of year (Have to eat lunch ya know)Lane"
