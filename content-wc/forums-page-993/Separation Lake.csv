515221,DaveIN,2001-10-15 19:35:00,191,We were there the last week of August of this year.This was our first time there so I can't compare it with anything but we thougt the fishing was great and have made reservations for the last week of August again next year.PS River fishing was better than the lake.
515222,Eyesore,2001-10-16 07:22:00,455,"Pikelady, how was the water level? Also, did you have any luck in storm bay on walleye? Sorry I did'nt answer your question about august, as I've only been there in june too [not this year]"
515223,Guest,2001-10-16 08:30:00,0,"Thanks for your replys, try and answer all your questions. The water level was up 7 feet. We did really good in the East side of the big rapids, in the little rapids on the east side of the island. We fished Storm Bay one day and didn't catch anything but small slimmies, no walleyes. I guess the water has gone down now, we normally go to Naughty Pines Fish Camp on the English River just South of Manatou Falls out of Ear Falls and it has gone down 6 to 7 feet there.We like to try different places and are looking for some good smallmouth lakes now.Thanks[email protected]"
