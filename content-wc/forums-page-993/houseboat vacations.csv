515332,Guest,2001-10-26 03:04:00,0,I am planning a houseboat vacation with my family this next year and would like to know how people have fared with the houseboats out of Sioux Lookout ( Sioux Lookout floating Lodges and Lac Seul Floating lodges) or Canada North Houseboat rentals out of Morson on LOW. I have fished both these areas before and am somewhat familar with the areas. How have people fared fishing the Miles Bay area in July. We really struggled a few years ago and I attributed that the the amount of bait available in the water. There were minnows and crayfish everywhere. Any help would be greatly appreciated. If we go to Lac Seul I would like to base out of the Manitou Rapids area. I know this is not the traditional Hot Spot but I don't want to boat 45 miles to Bear Narrows or beyond and I have a secluded lake that is in the area that I want to try.Thanks

I don't have my lake maps here, but we usually have motored up the lake quite a ways. Wea have always had a great time.Joe"

I highly endorse http://www.houseboatadventures.com Jeff and Lorelie are first class people and they will take good care of you. If you want to talk about hotspots for fishing, or good places to moor, just e-mail me.Paul[email protected]"
515335,BD,2001-10-28 22:42:00,739,Our group has been going out of Reed Narrows (Soiux Narrows area) for 14 or 15 years now. We use Lake of the Woods Houseboats and fish the north side of the peninsula from Yellow Girl Bay to Skeet Island. We have allways been treated to good service by Noreen and Dan. <http://www.lowhouseboats.com>
