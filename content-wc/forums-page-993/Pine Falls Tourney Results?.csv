515187,Guest,2001-10-09 17:02:00,0,Fished the tourney this weekend and the SLOW conditions continue to prevail. The results reflected the extreme conditions as teams had difficulty boating the required 4 fish each day. Keep thinking things are just around the corner and that the cold mornings on Friday and Saturday would get things stirred up but I just spoke with a friend who just got back today (ie. Tuesday 0ct 9th) and only managed to boat 3 fish.Crossing my fingers things get running before its time to put the boat to bed for the winter!
515188,Guest,2001-10-09 18:04:00,0,"I had to settle for being a spectator at this year's tournament. Watched the weigh-in on Sunday afternoon. A good number of participants struggled to find a 4 fish entry. Having said that, there were also several boats which weighed in fish in the +25"" range. A couple of guys said that they had just caught them a few minutes before the weigh-in time. I would be happy to hear others tell of the tournament and/or if they fished this area in the past couple of days. What was working well and whereabouts they caught fish."
515189,Guest,2001-10-09 19:17:00,0,"Most of those who managed to land the 25"" + you refer to were pulling Pearl Shad Raps. All my walleye were caught using Pearl #8's also...unfortunately mine were only between 5-6lbs. A lot of small (eaters) were picked up on the south side of the river mouth jigging with lime colored jigs and salted minnows. Prefishing this spot on Friday we managed to catch an even dozen there but nothing big. The bite at the mouth usually lasts from sunrise till about 9am, because of the 1.5 hr fog delay those who arrived at this spot only managed to catch the tail end of the bite."

515191,Guest,2001-10-10 17:12:00,0,"Fished Pine Falls last Thursday through Saturday. The 30 to 40 mph NW winds kept everyone off of the lake on Thursday. Friday and Saturday were calm, but fishing was still very slow.We caught a few between 25-27"" on Saturday and did manage to get one 11 lber. We didn't have any white or pearl shad raps, but found #9 gold and blue shad and risto raps to work as well as though around us. Water temp still at 57 F when we left.Good Fishing!"
515192,Todd_NE,2001-10-11 18:27:00,1330,"We fished Pine Falls sat aft late - wed early aft. Our bigs were a 33"" and a few more around 30-31"". Fishing is definitely slower than previous years for everything. We did the best trolling channel edges with Shad Raps and old Jr. Tsticks. Wed did show more fish moving into the flats and I would think it will pick up.Good luckTodd"
