My guess is if you are registered as the owner of the vehicle, your DUI will show up when they do a license check. Border crossing was extremely smooth both ways. We had a minimal look through on the way back to the US. Good Luck!"

They asked us further questions, mainly have you ever been arrested, we said no, they took our Minn licenses and did a check, my buddy had a DWI 18 years ago, it showed up and they made him pay $200 Cannadian just to enter! The lady said it didn't matter, even if he had told the truth. My buddy hasn't had a drink in 18 years! Moral of the story is if it is taken to the next level at the border you are toast, there are very few of us who don't have skeletons in our closet so brinng extra cash just in case, good luck"
