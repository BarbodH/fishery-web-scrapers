515205,Guest,2001-10-14 18:08:00,0,how did you do up at simcoe and how long was wait comming back at the bridge doug
515206,BGunn,2001-10-15 03:43:00,880,"Went last Sat. lots of perch, but you have to move around (maybe allot) and look for them. Once you find the school, you'll get your limit of 50 easy.You must have gone to the wrong section of the Lake Simcoe Board.Try Here for up-to-date messages;http://members.boardhost.com/Lake_Simcoe/We cross the bridge in Niagara Falls, zipped right thru going both directions, but they are going to check the inside of your car trunk/truck. Don't give them a hard time, and you'll be ok, their just doing their job.Bill"
515207,Gilly,2001-10-23 09:54:00,209,"Well we fished for two days at Simcoe off of Pefferlaw. They had a big wind on Wednesday which turned the water into a coffee color with lots of cream. By Saturday fishing was picking up but still slow. The big boats head out to the tip of Thora ? Island and did well. The pack wasn't doing so well and we moved over closer to shore and started filling the boat. Caught our 100 between the two of us in no time. Sunday was slow again. We marked all kinds of fish but they weren't cooperating too well. Best bite from 10:30 til 12:00. We ended up with 150 total-two days. One guy had his limit and was cleaning them up under the tent. Their OPP/DNR waited until he was done and asked him to count his limit. He was five fish over by accident. Both he and his partner were fined $75 each and the guy took all the cleaned fish, cooler and all. *%!# of a way to get more Americans to visit and funnel dollars into their economy. Overall another great trip."
515208,Wayne,2001-10-27 19:06:00,43,"5 FISH OVER BY ACCIDENT.I dont buy that,If you cant keep track of how many fish you have YOU NEED TO BE CHARGED AND FINED."
515209,BGunn,2001-10-28 03:02:00,880,"Wayne,I fish there quite often, and I agree with you. Sounds to me that one or both got a little greedy. Even one fish over is not ""OK"", but 5 ? sorry.....no excuse"
515210,eyedoktr,2001-10-29 10:16:00,2426,"It sounds like they got off easy. I don't care if it's one or twenty one, if you're over the limit, you're in the wrong. He could have (should have??) counted as he was catching and again while he was cleaning. There is no excuse for this. I would've liked to see them loose their equipment and the right to fish in the U.S and Canada for a few years. Sorry for the rant, it's just a touchy subject for me."
