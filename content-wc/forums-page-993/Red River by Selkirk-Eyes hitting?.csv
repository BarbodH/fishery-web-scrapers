515004,Guest,2001-10-07 19:57:00,0,Hi Ripstik you guys left too early you missed the cold rain on Thursday and the real cold snow flurries on Fri. But it did bring the greenbacks in .Friday was really hot fishing.
515005,Guest,2001-10-09 17:59:00,0,"Dan, sounds like you had a very productive trip. I am leaving for the red Friday Oct. 12 for 5 days. I have a great friend from Seattle flying back to Mn and a group of us are going up for the first time. We usually go to Rainy River. May I ask how you fished these walleyes you caught. I here most guys verticle jig. What size jig did you use(if you were jigging). Did you drive to Pine Falls at all? Any info would be fabulous! We are very excited!!"
515006,Dan,2001-10-09 19:00:00,325,arnie you should hit the run on greenbacks just about right .When we were there last week it seemed like the run was just starting. Try jigging with 3/8 or 1/2 oz jigs (pink or yellow) with salted shiners.We also did well on #7shad raps and#5 wally divers on certain days.. Stay away from all the big crowds we had most of the areas to ourselves when we caught our better fish. good luck

514995,Hawgeye,2001-10-03 07:38:00,1355,"I missed you at Pine Falls Chrism! I can relate, we had sloww fishing. In fact it was soooo slow, we left early. I planned on staying until wednesday but left Monday morning because of water temps and poor fishing. We caught about 10 walleyes total in 2 days. One was 28"" and the rest were between 20 and 23"" Kept some 20"" inchers and got to eat but worked hard for those few fish. Even the river was reported to be slow. Water temps were at around 58 degrees!!! Way too warm for good greenback fishing. It will be picking up after this next cold front coming through...I am confident."
514996,Guest,2001-10-03 08:28:00,0,"Hey Guys,Sounds like tough fishin' Still sounds better than work though. I'm leaving today, and will be there until the 8th. Hopefully it picks up a little. I'll let ya know how we did when I get back.Good Luck,Craig"
514990,Guest,2001-10-03 14:26:00,0,"Hey, Yes a lot of people verticle jig on the Red River, but you can also catch a lot trolling #9 shad raps along Dock Reeds' shoreline.You can also try trolling infront of the steam plant in about 15 feet of water or so. Anyway I have been fishing the Red River for the past 15 years and I get most of my big walleyes on the stretch of river where Dock Reeds is located. Use jumbo salted minnows!!!!!! Live minnows do not work as well. If you start catching saugar or small walleye move a couple feet deeper and just move back and fourth with your trolling motor. Good Luck Bud!!!"
514997,chrism,2001-10-04 06:27:00,429,"Hawgeye - I got blown off the water on Saturday!Monday we were back, and I think I saw your white boat all covered up and ready to go at the motel - Too bad about the fishing! Sounds like you did better than most!I guess some other time!Chris"
514998,Hawgeye,2001-10-04 10:58:00,1355,"Chris,That was me! How did Monday go? With this cold snap coming through, fishing will surely pick up. I am afraid it may be not soon enough for these tourney fisherman but by the next weekend it will be better. I'll be back and plan on hitting it hard in a couple weeks.GOOD LUCK and keep us posted.Thanks for your reports Chris!"
515000,Guest,2001-10-04 11:29:00,0,"ChrisMSeeing as the both of us are ""frequent flyers"" to Pine Fallsone of these days we are going to have to say HI. My Partner and I I will be fishing the Pine Falls Tournement this weekend are you participating?"
514999,Dan,2001-10-06 17:11:00,325,"Checked in on the Tourney this afternoon well before final weigh-inI was very please and kind of surprised to see quite a few big fish weighed in ...Largest was 13.7 lb with quite a few pushing 10 or more.FYI ... we had a big blow from the Northwest Thursday and Friday and it got below freezing. Yesterday places like Stead, just 20 minutes closer to Winnipeg from Pine Falls had white out conditions and 4+ inches of snow.This morning was cold and foggy on the river ... the start of the tourney was delayed 1.5 hours waiting for a heavy fog to lift."
515002,Guest,2001-10-07 16:35:00,0,We fished the the Red all last week and did quite well. Our group caught several 6-10 lb greenbacks plus 3 -11s 2-12s a 13 and a 14 -7.not to mention a bunch of small sauger a 15 lb pike and a 18 lb channel cat.The bite has finnaly started this coming week should be awesome wish we were back up there.
515003,Ripstik,2001-10-07 17:41:00,29,"Dan's braggin..His group was the only ones tearing them up..Everybody else was hit and miss on the big ones..Lots of little ones..The weather was changing so I'm sure the fishing will pick up..Just picking on ya dan...We just wished we had got into more of the big ones..If I don't see you before,I'll see you up there next year.."
514983,Hawgeye,2001-09-17 12:22:00,1355,"Any word on 'eye fishing on the Red by Selkirk? Fishing reports welcome. I fish Traverse bay and if it is too windy or fishing is way slow, frequently we will hit the Red for a day. Appreciate any information. Coming up Sept 29th for 5 days...Thanks for the reports!..."
514984,Guest,2001-09-18 18:53:00,0,Fished the Red mon. 17th. The walleye are late this year. We got few small ones but the good ones are few and far between. The water is still warm but that can change soon I hope! Hope that helps and good luck.
514985,chrism,2001-09-18 21:50:00,429,"Hey Hawgeye!I will work both places hard this weekend - the weather has cooled off a bit, but whether it is enough to start them biting, who knows. Witchin' hour is almost here!Look for a reply Sun Eve.Chris"
514986,Backwater Eddy,2001-09-19 05:23:00,3871,"Eh chrism!E-mail me after your search this weekend with the poop. I may be headed that way on the 4&5th, 17&18th, or the 24&25th of October. The 17th & 18 looks better for me and for timeing too.How was the cat action this week? Kermit still king?Thank's Chrism........><,,>"
514987,Hawgeye,2001-09-19 06:36:00,1355,"Thanks Boots and Chrism, Hey Chrism, good luck! I will be looking forward to any info after the weekend. They gotta start soon, right! My adrenaline really gets pumpin' this time of year. Fall fishing in your area is a touch of heaven! Been coming for 13 years for several weekends every fall.Backwater Eddy, I read the article in the Walleye Lines for FM Walleyes, 15+lber? What a beaut! I have even taken up a little cat action since fishing at Traverse Bay. I hope to find them again this year. By the way, how is the bait in the area? I always visit Boris to get good minnows, can I expect the same this year? Let the Hawgs go and have a great time!"
514988,Guest,2001-09-19 19:21:00,0,I plan to go to the Red this year. I usually go to Rainy. I here Selkirk is the place to go. Can any of you give me any hotel information. I plan on going up there October 18 thru the 21st. How do you think that will be? Too Late? Do most guys verticle jig in the river?Thanks for any info!!
514989,Guest,2001-09-20 10:33:00,0,"#9 shadraps, firetiger, clown, pearl, and Wallydivers are the best. Most crank, But also jig, Chartreuse, pink, pink and white, orange, orange chartreuse.Good Luck!"
514991,Backwater Eddy,2001-10-01 04:47:00,3871,"Hay chrism.......><, ,>Is it piggy time yet?;)"
514992,Guest,2001-10-02 14:23:00,0,Spent a day at Pine falls and a day on the Red last weekend.Fishing is poor. The largest I took was 5 1/2 (greenback).Otherwise all small... Would wait for better reports before going. Talk to people that said two weeks ago it was better. The south wind over several days has had a bad effect..Good luck Jim J.
514993,chrism,2001-10-02 17:27:00,429,"Hey BE!Well, just fished 4 days - two at PF and two on the Red. PF is slowwwww...Tried live/salted minnows, shallow and deep, trolled cranks in both places and caught a few in 14-16ft with both techniques.Water temps at both places are 56-58f. The Red had a few greenbacks, but no big bite yet. More saugers than I can handle!Biggest 'eye was 25"".Biggest Sauger was 10""!!!!!The weather is looking cold for the next week. Hopefully........I have to go and soak my sore elbow - tooooo mannnyyyy sauuugggerrrrr.........LaterChris"
