Was out on the weekend and never caught any trolling which is unusual for this time of year,did catch nice northerns, all muskies(nothing big)where caught casting on rock points or shelfs with reeds on the shore. Water temps are still high so the fish are scattered, hope by the weekend we get into some typical fall patterns, trolling for hogs.Good luck !D'arcy"
