I bought them from Pro-Am in Winnipeg and the question is can I take them across the boarder to the US?The Greenbacks are starting to run this week. The best day we had this week was Tuesday when the wind was calm. The 5 best so far are a 25"", 25.5"", 27.5"", 28"" and a 29"" jigging out in the bay next to the channel. Saw other boats netting some nice ones too. No problem getting enough slabs for the freezer. So far we had three day this week that it was windy so working the bay got hard to dangerous. I think it was Monday it blow from the northwest hard, Tuesday was almost calm, Wed it blow hard from the south and Thur it blow out of the west."

Today I seen 3 big fish caught, a 10#, and two that where just over 13# along with a lot of other nice walleys - so the pine falls bit is finally on. Better late then never!:)Thanks for the info, Bob"
