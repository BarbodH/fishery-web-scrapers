515230,Trophymuskie,2001-10-18 14:27:00,254,You made a great choice in going to the gouin reservoir. I remember that walleyes are caught by the hundreads there as well as some large pike but if I remember the smallies over 4 lbs were plenty as well. May is a great time to go there as well but not sure if the bass will be in season that early in the year.Catch a big one this fallKeep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com

It is by far the best walleye fishery I have ever been on. Jigs and crawlers and rapallas worked well. The only draw back is the drive from Akron, Ohio and the bouncy dirt roads. Drop a line if you have any questions. Good luck."
