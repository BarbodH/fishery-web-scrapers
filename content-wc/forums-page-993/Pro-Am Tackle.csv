I've been there,and am sure I could get back there myself, but can't remember the roads to take, etc. well enough to explain to him. Any help appreciated.Any better reports from Pine Falls?"

515214,Hawgeye,2001-10-15 14:24:00,1355,I believe that Regent is also Nairn on west side of highway 59 which is the highway you continue on to Pine Falls. Lagimidier (sp?) I think becomes 59 as you leave Winnipeg.
515215,Guest,2001-10-15 15:25:00,0,Yes Hawgeye has it correct!
515216,River_eye,2001-10-15 16:38:00,1486,"Well, assuming you can find Lagimodiere (59) which runs North/South. Travelling north through the city on Lagimodiere, you will eventually reach the intersection of Lagimodiere and Regent/Nairn, it's just north of a fairly big train track overpass. If you turn left(west) you are on Nairn, and right(east) for Regent. Pro-Am is on the north side of Nairn in a small strip mall not far from the intersection. The fishin hole is in a strip mall on the south side of Regent, a little further away from the intersection. It's hard to see the store, so you have to look for the sign."

515218,Guest,2001-10-17 15:04:00,0,Pro am tackle is on north side of nairn in stip mall across from Wendys hamburger joint
