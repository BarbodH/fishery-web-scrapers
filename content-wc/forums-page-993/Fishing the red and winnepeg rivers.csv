514836,Guest,2001-09-08 23:39:00,0,"I have a couple of questions about fishing the red/winne rivers. I have never been up there and i am getting some info on how to fish them. (crankbaits- large minnow jigging) but i have a couple of other questions.1. Does anyone use lindy rigs with crawlers in the rivers?2. How fast does one troll with crankbaits up there?3. Does one typically use any weight with the crankbaits?4. Are there adequate places and easy locatable places to buy everything I would need? (Crankbaits-bait etc)anything else you would want to tell me, would be greatly appreciated.Thanks"
514837,Guest,2001-09-09 18:50:00,0,"My suggestion is to have an assortment of Bomber Long A's , Reef runners,#9 and #8 deep Shad Raps from Rapala, Storm Thundercranks deep Thundersticks and Deep Jrs. My best colors have typically been the gold and black, blue black and clown. All of this is for the bay. If fishing in the current of the river, you will want some 1/2 oz, 3/8 oz and bigger jiggs of various sizes. Tip them with the larger minnows that you can get your hands on. There have been times when drifting on the bay with slip rigs and minnows has worked but the best historical methods are listed above...Good Luck!"

Cabela's is my stop of choice, 6-packs of shad Rap's to go please! Fleet Farm in Fargo ND or Fergus Falls MN are also great choices for Rap's. lot's of Husky's in all the colors & size's.Does anyone remember the name of the bait shop place on the edge of Winnipeg? It is just off #101 & has good quality bait? If so please share or it here or send it along to me.Thank'sEd CarlsonBackwater Guiding10409 Co. Rd SHorace ND, 580471-(701)-281-2300"

Great bait,tackle and good info too.Up there most people do one of three things: Crank, Jig or Bounce. But that doesnt mean you cant try something else. Rigging is a pretty slow presentation and would be tough in the current."
