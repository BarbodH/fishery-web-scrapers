530597,Guest,2003-05-05 14:13:00,0,I will be going on 2 Fly Ins this Summer and would like to know if any of you have used dry ice to transport and keep food. I have always packed cooler with ice and it has done the trick but just wondering if their is a better way.Thanks.
530598,Guest,2003-05-05 14:19:00,0,Dry ice works great. You won't need very much of it either. Just pack a lot of newspaper to fill up any open space.

530600,Thumper,2003-05-06 07:15:00,133,"How much are people paying for dry ice?Where are good places to buy from?How much dry ice for, say a 36 qt cooler, for 2 June NW Ontario days?"
530601,Guest,2003-05-06 07:54:00,0,"The cost isn't too much as I recall, but I can't qoute you a price. Retail butcher shops that ship nationwide or any other food retailers that ship food should have dry ice. They'll tell you how much you need. It comes in 2"" slabs and they cut off a piece using a butcher's saw."

530603,Guest,2003-05-06 09:42:00,0,I get mine at a local butcher shop that ships steaks nationwide.
