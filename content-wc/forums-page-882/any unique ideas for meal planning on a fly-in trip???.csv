Brand names will vary but is available at most major chain grocery stores in Ontario and Quebec. I would be surprised if your stores down there didn't carry a version of it. Comes in 1 liter cartons and I can't tell any difference from regular low fat homogenized milk, although if you like the odd glass of ice cold milk you'll have to chill it down. I think the brand name in Quebec is Grand Pres."

530509,Guest,2003-05-06 08:35:00,0,"Nice staples to bring along are rice, boullion cubes or granules, pasta and some tomato paste. Doesn't weigh much and gives you something to eat in case fishing isn't what you expect it to be. In other words, a food insurance policy.The jambalaya, steaks, frozen pizza, etc., sound good to me."
530510,jigman 2003,2003-05-06 09:24:00,981,Replace as many canned/fresh products with dry mixes as you can. Most outfitters really restrict your weight. I find it difficult to pay extra to bring in food when a little more planning and creativity could prevent it.
530511,Guest,2003-05-06 12:11:00,0,"Some of the outfitters will provide a food package or will fly in beer, etc., if you give them notice (and more money). This might help with weight restrictions on the fly-in. If the outfitter was flying out an earlier party before flying in a new party, he or she would have an opportunity to ""stock"" a cabin for a new party and reduce the weight of your group, food and gear."
530512,Guest,2003-05-06 19:54:00,0,"Well lots of cold beer is important. Seriously though I recommend you throw in a few cans of beans,potatoes, carrots, cereal, bread and UHT milk.Did I mention beer?"
530497,Guest,2003-05-04 15:37:00,0,we will have a cabin with limited refrigerator space....just curious if there are any unique ideas on meal planning besides the obvious>> fish !!
530498,Guest,2003-05-04 16:25:00,0,We do a steak dinner the first night with all the trimmings. Then later in the week we do pizza. You can get ones already made up a local pizzeria (little casers) freeze them and thaw them later and pop in oven and you have a great easy meal. Also chicken breast already frozen then thawed out and cooked up are always good. Sack of spuds can be prepared many ways.
530500,Guest,2003-05-04 20:38:00,0,"hi - we do a flyin each year and this work good- bake a ham at home - slice it and put in tupperware, will keep with very little cooling- make it for dinner about wednseday night and left over we use for sandwiches next two days- also take tuna helper and make with fresh walleyes later in week-great and no refrig needed. also we take alot of those rice a roni paks and stuffing mixes, also those instant hash browns work well. spaghetti also is our meal on thursday- no refrig needed, and i take lots of pancake mix- for coating fish but aslo we get a cold rainy night later in week you be suprized how good pancake taste- also we take those ramon soup paks - no refrig needed and taste great antime-also we take all our veggies in frozen paks- they help keep everthing else cold - will keep days even out of refrig and much lighter and no cans to deal with hope this helps - email me if you need more ideas [email protected]"
530501,Behle,2003-05-05 05:21:00,51,To save space in the freezer and the fridge we take up boxed side dishes that can be cooked on the stove top. You can have a wide variety of side dishes from pasta to potatoes and you only need milk and margarine.Plan to eat the chicken meal early in the week so as to not let the poultry sit around for long. It will be more likely to spoil over other meats. Brats and burgers can stay in a cooler or in the fridge and don't need freezing the whole time.We use coolers to bring up most of our meats for the week and they can be kept in the cooler for quite awhile until space is freed up in the freezer or until you use it.
530502,McQ,2003-05-05 07:51:00,615,"We do a few trips a year to remote locations and home is an 11' truck camper. Some of the articles we have come to appreciate for saving space are vacuum sealed sauces for pasta, you can get them seasoned for hot or cold dishes, this usually takes care of two days suppers and really takes up no space. Steak is the first nights supper, prepared with mushrooms and peppers, a tin of beef gravy comes in handy for a sauce, just add pepper corns (couple of teaspoons in a zip lock bag). Fish is on the menu two nights and canned sliced potatoes fried up with some onion provides the side. Breakfast will vary from bacon and eggs to just toast for some of us, again the fixin's don't take much refrigerator space. We buy milk that doesn't require cooling. Tinned stews and soups, a few tins of veggies and beans fillout the menu plan.We prepare a cooler just for lunches, cold meat, mustard, mayo, tomatoes, onion, etc. And use freezer pacs to keep them cold. It is never a strain for freezer use following this style of meal planning. Our biggest problem is storing all the junk food, chips, pretzels, cookies etc. None of the guys I fish with drink beer so that's not a problem but we all have preferrences for different pops and juices. Bottled water is also a big item, we do freeze the bottles and use them in the boat coolers to keep our other drinks cold and as the day progresses they also are consumed.As you can see, by not trying to set a homestyle kitchen we get around the refrigeration problem and still have excellent menu variety - keep the freezer for providing ice and the perishables that require refrigeration are consumed early in the week."
530503,Guest,2003-05-05 13:05:00,0,"Let's see, you are going to a fly-in...hmmmm, how about fish??Can anyone say shore-lunch??? I'd have fish for breakfast, lunch and dinner if I was you - but maybe that's because I love fresh walleye fillets so much."
530504,Guest,2003-05-05 15:20:00,0,oh yes!!!!....we will definitely have as much fish as possible..no doubts on that...kinda nice sometimes to have something else with your fish though.......
530505,Eric,2003-05-06 04:25:00,114,"We alternate our meals, fish and potatoes then we have potatoes and fish. We get up very early and go out and fish 2-3 hours, then back to camp for breakfast which includes the following and not all of this at every meal either. Eggs or egg beaters, turkey sausage,bacon, pancakes, toast, breakfast rolls, coffee, Tang, etc. Back out and fish till about 4 or so and come in for fish, potatoes ,slaw{ I planted my cabbage the last day of March so it should be ready for the end of June}. Since we go late June or early July we have very long days , then about 5:30 or 6 we go out and fish till 11-12 pm depending if it is overcast or not we have came in at mid-night. We repeate this almost everyday day except for a couple days when we take the skillet with us and eat fish on shore 10 or 15 miles from camp."
530508,fishinnut,2003-05-06 07:12:00,642,They're not unique but we always take frozen stews and chili.
530506,Thumper,2003-05-06 07:19:00,133,"Hi, McQ<<We buy milk that doesn't require cooling.>>What kind of milk is that? How's it taste/texture/etc.?"
