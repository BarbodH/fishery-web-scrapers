530563,Guest,2003-05-05 10:11:00,0,the answer is NO!!!!
530564,Vitreum,2003-05-05 10:26:00,221,"actually, it's not just an ontario board. it's primarily a northwest ontario board. there are only a handful of eastern ontario/quebec posters and a few from manitoba. and, to be honest, it's the best walleye site i've found on the web."
530566,River_eye,2003-05-05 10:32:00,1486,"The name of this website should give you a clue. The best Walleye fishing is in NW ontario and Manitoba. Sure there's lots of other fish around the rest of the country, but this is walleye central."
530567,McQ,2003-05-05 11:19:00,615,"It sure seems to be NW Ontario but a bit of a heads up. The core of the membership here is from the northern midwestern states, folks like me are in a definite minority being from Quebec - there might be 3 or 4 of us that post. In response to Eric's assertion that the best walleye fishery is in the NW sector of Ontario and Manitoba I can only say this travel a bit more and really discover what's available in other areas. I've had the opportunity to chase walleye in virtually every corner of North America that might have a population of them, in fact been at it for 40 years. If you want consistent 100 fish days then come on over to Quebec and try some of our reservoirs and lakes - the results will truly amaze you. The language excuse is just that an excuse. Now I will never say that Quebec has the best or the most or the largest because we all know certain areas have prolific fisheries. It's just that from where I live I can be on the water fishing a very remote location within a couple of hours of leaving the house. The float plane services around here are great and the outfitter hosts are the best I have ever encountered.Most of the Americans I meet up here are from Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Ohio. Those folks who can reach our area in a 6 to 12 hour drive max. Think about what you guys have to do to enjoy your trip - aren't the travel times about the same?I will add this point - Quebec has huge trophy pike, 10# plus walleye are very common and then you add in the bonus lakers and brook trout and you really have the potential for the best vacation of your life.So don't be shy, look a little further when planning your trips next year - I know you will have a great time in my province and we do have stronger beer here just look for the UNI-BREW label."
530568,winchester70,2003-05-05 11:39:00,0,"Hey river_eye,you are right.This is walleye central so let's nix all the other fish that I mentioned. Lets also nix all the talk about gas prices,value of the canuck buck,bringing bait into the country,U.S. visitors getting ripped by lodge owners,border crossing times,which beer is better,who's gov'mt is better,YADA,YADA,YADA( Oh my God ,I'm starting to sound like Sienfeld.)Vitreum said that this is the best walleye site on the net,I agree whole heartedly.You and him both mentioned Manitoba,your on the right track.BUT my ? was for U.S.fishermen,do you ever visit or fish other parts of Canada??"
530569,Vitreum,2003-05-05 12:11:00,221,"winchester, our annual pilgrimage to lac seul is kind of a family reunion. i live in maryland, my son in san diego. by brothers-in-law are from illinois and michigan. they have kids in indiana and colorado. northwest ontario is kinda central to all of us and has great fishing. plus, i think that the older you get, the more set in your ways you become. really don't have any desire to do any exploring for new spots."

530565,Bobby,2003-05-05 17:39:00,211,"I disagree that this is mostly a northwestern Ontario board. I think there's a very good representation of prairie boys here. Some days, though, it seems like a lodge/DUI/border-crossing board. I know your question was directed at the guys from the south. Personally, though, I have fished Yukon Territory for trout and grayling, norhtern BC (same) as well as Saskatchewan and Ontario for walleye. However, this is WALLEYE Central. In addition to Ontario, there is a LOT of good Canadian walleye fishing in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. In fact, the Red, Winnipeg, and Saskatchewan (including its resevoirs) rivers are probably THE best rivers for lunker walleye. ""Hold on to the boat, boys, she's gonna ram us!"""
