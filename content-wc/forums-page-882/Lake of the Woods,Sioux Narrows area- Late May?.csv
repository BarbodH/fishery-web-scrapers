Staying at someones house on the lake ,I am told sort of across from a resort they thought was called called White Moose Lodge.(???)How is the Walleye fishing likly to be at this time? Never fished Canada that early.Any tips on depths and baits would be appreciated, especially on where to get bait on the lake in this area? Would it be too early for leeches?"
530576,Guest,2003-05-05 11:40:00,0,Followup Question:Is there a night fishing restriction on L.O.W. as on Eagle Lake?
530577,wallidiver,2003-05-05 12:41:00,50,"We fish out of Nestor Falls the first week of June, the fish can usually be foun d in the sand bays with emerging weed growth. bottom bouncer and spinner combo works well in locating fish quickly. When things are abit early the fish are usually found between the transition from boulders to the sand or follow the boulders out if you can't contact fish. It might be abit early for the sand areas during your time frame, but areas with small boulders working into bays with sand should be going."
530578,RCKC,2003-05-05 13:36:00,14,There's a great Bait and Tackle store in Sioux Narrows. We buy our fishing licences their every year. Good minnows and leeches as well. We don't fish around there. We go up to Minaki so I can't tell you about the fishing. Good Luck.

530580,Guest,2003-05-05 18:37:00,0,"Long Bay has some bays in it that hold good walleyes. The bay in front of the Black River holds fish, Also as previously mentioned, Yellowgirl Bay is good, and then moving north of there is Shore Island area which is dynamite. Just watch where the traffic is going and that will tell you what is going on. If the leaves are on the Popal trees, then there will be a decent bite going on."
