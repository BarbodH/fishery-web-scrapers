530572,Guest,2003-05-05 10:30:00,0,What types of lures do people typically use when they night fish? the same as day but brighter colors or what?
530573,McQ,2003-05-05 11:30:00,615,"I do a lot of dusk to midnight fishing up here and generally get into a topwater bite for a half hour or so throwing rainbow patterns around weedbeds and reefs, just twitching the bait over the surface. As darkness sets in I'll switch to a fat vibrating 6' diving bait in hot red crawfish or black herringbone patterns, cranking and twitching the bait back to the boat. You can also expand your target area to include the shallow flats after dark or move right up and throw to the shoreline."
