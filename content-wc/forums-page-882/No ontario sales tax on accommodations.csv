The tax will still be applied to Boats and Motors and bait etc. This will be in effect until sept. This was passed may 1st, but still needs royal accent. This should not take long."

530408,Thumper,2003-05-05 08:01:00,133,Looks like it became law on 5/1/2003http://www.fortfrances.com/index.php/1/2003-05-02/13834
530409,Bruce,2003-05-05 10:04:00,48,Does this mean that we can't reimbursed at the Duty Free Storein International Falls when coming back from the states?
530410,Guest,2003-05-05 10:54:00,0,"Where is the duty free store? Is it in International Falls or Fort Frances? To claim some reimbursment, what do you need? Would the itemized bill from the lodge work?"
530411,Guest,2003-05-06 05:14:00,0,Sorry the duty free store is right before the border in Ft FrancisAll you need is your reciept from the lodge and we normally get about $50 bucks back each year.
530412,Thumper,2003-05-06 09:28:00,133,"I think that the refund you get at the border is on GST, not PST. Thus, if you paid it on your lodging and anything you'll be bringing back over the border that cost > $50(can), you can still get the refund.http://www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca/E/pub/tg/.../rc4031-e.htmlIsn't there some deal now where the lodge owners don't have to charge the full 7% GST to their guests now. In effect, giving you the tax refund before it's even collected?"
