530588,Stevie B,2003-05-06 12:45:00,157,They do have a spaning ground at the mouth of the Lee River. The local's refer to it as Willow Point. I haven't been there for a few years. I do believe that there are some date restrictions to fishing near the spaning area. So check with the regulations and the locals. Good luck!Fish ON!!
530589,Stevie B,2003-05-06 12:46:00,157,Sorry that's SPAWNING!!!Fish ON!!
