530554,Guest,2003-05-05 08:52:00,0,NA......= don't count as beer. When they ask you how much beer you have don't include the NA in the amount you tell them.
530555,Guest,2003-05-05 10:12:00,0,NA is for quitters
530556,Guest,2003-05-05 11:24:00,0,"Well for your sake I hope thats right,but A buddy of mine owned a pizza joint in Illinois and there, it was treated just as any alcoholic beverage. He could not sell it to minors."

530558,Guest,2003-05-05 12:51:00,0,"I believe you are correct,the last time I had one, I am pretty sure the label says something like ""contains 0.5% Alcohol"" which technically still classifies it as an alcoholic beverage. You just need to drink 12 of them to get the same alcohol content as 1 regular beer. Maybe customs will allow you 12 cases. Could be that if it says 0.0% it would be considered an illegal substance! (or should be). Rather go the other route with a short cut.. How bout some Shlitz Malt Liquor???!! Maybe customs only lets 3/4 of a case of that over the border at a time???"
530559,Guest,2003-05-05 13:11:00,0,"Actually, not all NAs have alcohol in them. Some are -0- %. In the event your NA beer has any alcohol in it, it is considered beer (an alcholic beverage) at the border. I just took a case across and had this same conversation with the Canadian boarder official."
