I hope you read this Northern Manitoban, you said somthing about going there ice fishing a couple of weeks ago.:-) ThanksKilroy"
530527,Northern Manitoban,2003-05-05 09:39:00,195,"Hi Kilroy.I got back from Reed lake last friday,there is still 3 feet of ice but its really rotten looking shorelines were opening up and all the reefs out there are showing through and there is open holes,and allot of pressure ridges.Very warm here now and i figure it will be open in 2 weeks,i'll be there hopefully setting up my site on the 18th site 38.Water levels will be very low this year so watch out for reefs there.Fishing last week for lakers was slow for this time of year but the 3 of us managed in 2 days of fishing land around 26 lake trout and probably about 30 Burbots! they were really being a pain.See you there! FISH ON!"
530528,Kilroy,2003-05-05 12:24:00,59,"Thank you, I was hopeing it was getting rotten around the edges. You guys need to get together and have a rain-dance up there lol. I was up there the year they had that big fire on the North-West edge of the lake, I hope not to see somthing like that again because it is dry. Thanks for the reply Northern Manitoban, I will shoot you an email the weekend before we go and see if the water is still stiff.Kilroy"
