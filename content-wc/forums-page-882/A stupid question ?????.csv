530678,Vitreum,2003-05-06 19:14:00,221,i've never lived anywhere where the ice nearly is as bad as canada. do lodge owners have to pull all of those docks out of the water in winter? just wondering.
530679,Guest,2003-05-06 21:17:00,0,"Ya most everyone has to do somthing, unless you are lucky and sitting in a protected bay. Other wise one has to do somthing with them. Pull them out or move them. What does the most damage is when the ice goes out and the wind pushes the ice into the dock. Oh the damage that can be done!!"
530680,Vitreum,2003-05-06 21:32:00,221,thanks rich. that's kinda what i figured. i know that ice out down here can play havoc with my submerged crappie logs. moves them all over the place.
