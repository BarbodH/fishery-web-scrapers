We try to take a new kid with us every year and promote the great fishing for future generations, also he has to have good dishwashing skills,lol. We usually try and go up the 3rd weekend in May, depending on opening day. Last year the lake was hard as a rock when we arrived, but we found many other lakes were open, so we had a little variety for most of the trip. The last 4 days we were there, we were able to fish Reed Lake. The Lake Trout, Walleye,and Pike we caught were some of the best we have ever caught. Nice Campground, lots of friendly people,beautiful country, great fishing.....what more could you ask for!Kilroy"

Of course Nestor Falls and Sioux Narrows have now merged into one township.The water is very low this year, but ice should be out this week or early next. I don't fish walleye much (0nly to eat!). I'm primarily a muskie fisherman, but also enjoy Lake Trout, smallies and Northern Pike.Give me an email and let me know how you do up there this year. Always like to hear from a fellow St. Louisan.

I love to fish for Smallmouth also ( I am a member of the Missouri Smallmouth Allinace), but Walleye fishing is so good around the lodge we have to split our time. I have never fished for Musky and have only caught Trout on accidnet. It is a shame to hear the water is going to be low again this year, I decided to get up close and personal with a reef last year and I don't want that to happen again.

529033,lunker99,2003-04-02 20:40:00,236,Fishing Fools is probably right cause after 18 yrs you'd think you would have caught on to enough skill to catch a walleye on Lac Seul. I have a feeling that you're staying in the cabin next to mine again so I'll make sure to have enough big red bobbers and orange floaters that you can use to catch those hammer-handles and whitefish.
528990,lunker99,2003-04-02 20:51:00,236,"The detour off the main road is the area where we saw the flooded vehicles. I think we are in cabin 5 & 6 (or 6&7). Do most of our fishing back in sawmill, but also hit wenesauga falls, the mouth, and the rivers below the dams for change of scenery. Will be crossing the dborder early also. Got caught in the big lines a couple of years ago and decided never again. Don't know if we'll be able to slow the pace once we cross the border though. Will probably get there early and either fish below one of the dams for a while or dump the stuff out of the boat into the yard while they finish cleaning and go out on the lake for a while. Stop down for a cold one this year. I'll let you have two if you can keep Fishing Fool (#49 on the list of messages) away from the hot spots by pulling his plug or something!"

Struggled a little the first year but went back, learned the lake, and have been hammering them on Perrault ever since.(all species) We're trying a fly in this year though to Severn River with Showalters, and I got some great info from some nice fellas from this site. Props to the guys who got this sight going and props to all Canadians for sharing your precious resources. ray ray hookerfox cities rugby football club"
528991,Guest,2003-04-03 19:44:00,0,"We've found that Sawmill is the usual hot spot this time of year. If it is a late thaw, they are usually up in the bay, and if an early year, they have moved out to the main points at the mouth of Sawmill, or even out in the main lake. That was why I was asking about the water temps. We've found some rock piles in the main lake that have been productive, but you have to look around for them depending on the water levels. Your prop is not the best indicator of shallow rocks!!! Fising below the big dam at Ear Falls is pretty productive - we've heard that the walleye fishing is good there, but we've never tried that. We have tried casting rattle traps for northerns, and did pretty well on 3-4 pounders. Supposedly, the walleye are in there also, but we didn't have the patience for that. I'll try to stop by this year for that cool one, but no guarantees on keeping Fishing Fool off the hot spots. You know the cardinal rule of fishing - first come, first served!!!"

529025,Guest,2003-03-31 12:48:00,0,I thought that you were talking about Vaughn on Lac Seul. I have fished it many times during our trips to lac Seul over the last 15 years. I love your sons Willeye name for Walleye. Catch a bunch and you and your son enjoy your trip.
529026,Guest,2003-03-31 13:50:00,0,It is part of Lac Seul. It is the Southwest section of Lac Seul called Vaughan. We will be there this year from June 29th until July 5th. The Cabin is all the way down Vaughan. If you are around stop by.
528979,Guest,2003-03-31 14:05:00,0,I have been going to LS for the past 15 or 16 years. I can't remember. I stay at Evergreen Lodge. It is very nice and very quiet. The fishing is very good and the accommodations are exceptional. A good family place. Sometimes hard to get reservations because they are full most all the time. But it's worth the check.

528988,lunker99,2003-03-31 19:20:00,236,"IA eye..didn't remember your handle from last year, but remember meeting you. We'll be in the same cabins again this year also, and as of right now the little girl will be going up again also. We also went home the way you went I think. Headed west out of Vermillion Bay and south through LOW and Nestor Falls. Pretty impressive seeing the trucks in the parking lot in Nestor Falls with the water all the way up to the windows. Bet there was some fly-ins that were surprised when the got back and saw their vehicles. Don't remember for sure the water temps from last year. My fish-finder has a temp guage on it but I'm bad about making notes. I think they were low to mid 50's for most of the lake and found some upper 50's in some bays, but I do know last year was colder than the norm for that time of year. We had a pretty good week last year. Seems like our biggest fish are an inch longer each year we go up. Last year we got 2 28"" and had a third break off at the side of the boat. Hopefully this pace will keep up and in a couple of years we'll get some of the 30""+ walleye everyone talks about. How did you guys end up doing? See you up the in a couple of months!"

528989,Guest,2003-04-01 20:25:00,0,"I remember taking a detour around some water over the main road, but other than that, it was a pretty nice drive. We did pretty well last year, but we ended up running back to Golden Fawn three times to beat the thunderstorms. Where do you guys fish most of the time? We ended up going to Sawmill Bay most of the time, and hitting the points on the way out of the bay if the bigger fish seem to have moved into deeper water. My son and I usually do some exploring during the week, and try some different areas. A couple of years ago we ended up 25+ miles from camp and ran across a couple of wolves swimming across the lake - an experience to remember! We have tried to get to the lake off Bannetine Bay, but ran into a beaver dam that kept us from getting to the lake. Looking forward to another year on the lake, and hope the weather is good for the week. What cabin are you guys in - I seem to remember #5 or so??? I agree that every year seems to be better than the year before - the slot seems to be working. Good luck to you this year, and stop by again. We're probably going to try to get there closer to noon as we were early last year and maybe take a snooze around LOTW somewhere. It seems best to try to cross the border around 2:00 AM or so - not so much of a line."

We crossed the border at International Falls, then we drove east about 20 miles and took a hyway north for about 100 miles. Then we went back west about 20 miles to a town( I think it was called Vermillion Bay or something like that). Then we went north about 60 miles, and just before we got to a town with the name Falls in it, we turned right down a little lane to our camp. We caught alot of nice walleye there, the 18 or so years that I have been going there!"

I think that we might go the Kanora route this year with the road to Dryden in rough shape. We came back that way last year, and it's a preety nice road - about the same time as Dryden. Any idea of what the water temps are the 2nd week of June? I've heard that they didn't have a lot of snow this year, but had a lot of cold weather and the ice is 40-50"" thick.
