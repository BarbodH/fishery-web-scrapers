Just cause I'm not going to be there this time doesn't mean you can have all the fun with out me. Don't worry I'll be down in the Caribbean maxing and relaxing with the females in small bikinis, drinking drinks with miniature umbrellas, and catching some sun. All I got to say is, that I'm going to miss this trip to Weese with a passion and look forward to the next North Woods Adventure, or whatever else is in store for me next time. Hook a big'en for me...."

I'll have a beer and a toast each night for you and look forward to you rejoining us next year. Congrats on the college degree and I'll make sure your dad takes pictures of any ""so called"" big ones."
