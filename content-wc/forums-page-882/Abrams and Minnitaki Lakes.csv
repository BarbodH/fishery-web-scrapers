530343,Guest,2003-04-30 07:02:00,0,"Will be camping near Sioux Lookout during opening week of walleye fishing. I have been there before, but never done real good. Is there any places in particular on Minnitaki that I should look for. Have only fished this lake for a couple days, so not real famaliar with it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.Thanks in advance...eyesnatcher"
530344,IaDave,2003-04-30 07:45:00,476,"We have been up there the the last 2 years for the 2nd week of the season. Never really had to go into Minnitaki, always fished below Abrams Chute and Frog Rapids and up the Sturgeon River. I think Minnitaki doesn't warm up as fast as Abrams Lake. On Minnitaki I know some people fish an area called the donut and at the mouth of a creek that flows into the east bay. Where are you camping at? We are going opening week this year and staying at Red Pine. If you see a couple guys in a Lund 1650 Explorer tiller with a 40HP Merc stop and say Hi and I can show you a couple of spots we like."
530345,Guest,2003-04-30 11:08:00,0,"Thanks IaDave...we will be at Abrams Lake Park just south of you. I will keep a lookout for your Lund. I have a 14' SSV with 25 Merc. I'm from MO so hopefully we can get together. I plan arriving on Saturday of opener. We are actually in a cabin at Abrams Park.I have heard of the Donut, but never fished it. I have maps of the area and appreciate any help.Thanks...eyesnatcher"
530347,Karl,2003-05-01 22:44:00,63,My best advice is to spend the extra dollars for a good guide - for at least a day. You'll learn more and catch more fish and in the long run do better every year.
530346,Karl,2003-05-01 22:50:00,63,"Don't know if you'll want to go to the ""donut"" this year because of the extremely low water levels. It's located near Alcona Bay at the very far extreme of Northeast Bay. The ""hole in the wall"" that separates the ""donut"" and Alcona Bay will not be navigable this year."
530348,Guest,2003-05-05 13:59:00,0,be real carefull at abrams chute big rock in chute that is showing.
530349,Guest,2003-05-05 14:23:00,0,Thanks Mike.....sounds like alot of rocks may be showing this year. Sure hope it doesn't affect the fishing. I need all the help I can get.
