Camp caretaker who gases up the boats everyday, meets you at the dock every day, helps carry your gear to and from the cabin and takes care of every little thing you need, We pool $20(US) from each guest for a week. Sometimes that may not even be enough. We also help him around the camp when he tackles a ""more than one man job"". Pilots usually get $20 total each way because it is not always the same pilot both ways. Pooch"
