557919,Guest,2006-05-31 20:25:00,0,The Co-op store in Vermilion Bay has its own butcher and excellent meat. Darcy or the other butcher will cut whatever you need. All the other stores in Dryden have there meat shipped in already cut and packaged.

The last time I was there, they wouldn't take a USA credit card or a check on the local Canadian bank, because the manager didn't ""know"" me. So I used US $ and they really scorched me on the exchange rate. Come to think of it that's why I haven't gone back. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

Do some planning in advance and bring some CDN $ or just use a card. Still have great meat and service from the butchers, which is hard to beat."
