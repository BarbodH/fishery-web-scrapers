558037,scar,2006-06-04 07:55:00,196,"question for our lac seul experts (are you out there some where nwo fishing bum?) 2 years in a row i have fished out of deception bay in may during the first week of the season and have not done very well on eyes and have seen little or no boats fishing these big areas(deception bay area to loon rapids in 05 and sen bay in 06) this year we said screw it and made the long trip to bear narrows (about 5 miles south of chamberlin and probably a 40 mile boat ride from deception) we caught walleyes so fast there we wondered why we even waisted our time at the other places. talking with other fishermen they said sen bay is good during the summer. another guy said that most walleyes in that south east area of lac suel migrate(for lack of a better word) up to chamberlin every year as 3 big rivers come in in that area and after spawning slowly move back down. Is this really true? that seams like an awful long way to go. can the same be said for the waters near the hudson landing? is that area also low in numbers of eyes this time of year? am looking for info since i have another trip planned for june 16 -22 and am hoping sen bay from deception landing and lost lake,webster bay,italian bay and english river from hudson landing will hold fish. are we better off making the long trip to bear narrows area each day? cmon experts give it up! scar"
