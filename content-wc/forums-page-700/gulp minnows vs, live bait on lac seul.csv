558058,scar,2006-06-04 21:00:00,196,"my question has been answered.fished bear narrows just south of chamberlin narrows last sunday. 4 guys in the boat on a point that held a million walleyes. one used crawlers only as he was to cheap to help pay for minnows,one used only minnows and my son and i switched off between gulp (3''pearl and smelt colored minnows) and real minnows. all of us caught fish at a fairly steady rate and no real pattern was noticable. our crawler guy would catch 3 in a row than a couple would be caught on gulp and then a couple on minnows. i guess if we were really counting i would say that if we caught 5 eyes every 15 minutes using the 3 choices we probably would have caught 6 every 15 minutes with just minnows. sure is easier though to keep crawlers alive and fresh and gulp needs to stay in a cooler or it melts!(it was 88 degrees that day!) scar"

557312,Guest,2006-05-16 18:22:00,0,"gotta agree with the last two posts live bait or borax minnows cant be beat . we did side by side minnows and gulp last year just to see and i'll take real meat any day. less than 2 weeks til i give hundreds of walleyes sore mouths at chamberlain narrows, cant wait."

When the fishing is fast (like on a good fly-in trip to Ontario) I'll outfish a guy using live bait every time. Why? My bait is in the water longer. I've tried this a number of times and each time I catch more fish per hour. I'm not stopping to re-bait or adjust my bait. Catch a fish, take him off, throw my twister tail in, catch another. No delays. Like I said, live bait is hard to beat, but it can be done."
557348,Mohleye,2006-05-17 10:52:00,368,"True.........if you catch a feeding frenzy, the live bait can be unnecessary. But a guy who has a minnow bucket can always decide not to bother with them while the bite is that good. The above posts talked about not using live bait at all, and I would always choose to have live bait with me, because on an average or tough bite, live bait will make all the difference."
557349,jigman 2003,2006-05-17 10:57:00,981,"I'll agree with you, at least while fishing drive in lakes. I have yet to experience a situation on a fly-in lake where I couldn't catch all the fish I wanted using artificials. I will admit that even on a fly-in there are times where live bait could help. To me the difference between 30-40 fish a day and 50-60 isn't that great. Sure, more is better, but not having to deal with live bait is worth something too."
557366,Mohleye,2006-05-17 14:50:00,368,"I've probably had only one day on a remote lake where the walleye were really lock-jawed, and then the only think that would work for us was a crawler on a slip-sinker rig. I agree as long as you're catching fish, a few more or less is not what it's all about. I would still like to catch that elusive 30""er someday though, and I feel like the bigger fish I've caught have been on live bait. Now since I almost always use live bait, that doesn't prove much. It's all about what you feel comfortable with. I'm just happy to have the choice to make."
557509,Guest,2006-05-22 16:12:00,0,"Here is a story that may interest you. While fishing on Lake Minnitaki last summer we found a spot where small walleyes were really hitting. We could toss a jig and a minnow and get a fish on half the casts. Some of them may have been the same fish caught repeatedly. After a while we ran out of minnows and put on white Gulp minnows. With the Gulp, we got fish on 1/4 of the casts, exactly half as often as with live minnows."
557524,jigman 2003,2006-05-23 06:43:00,981,"While this could be a good lesson in live bait use, it could also be a matter of your catching the active fish once or several times and only being left with the less aggressive fish. If you had a control in a boat next to you then maybe this could be a good comparison. Without some type of control it is pretty tough to say that Gulp only works half as well as live bait."

If you had a control in a boat next to you then maybe >this could be a good comparison. Without some type of control >it is pretty tough to say that Gulp only works half as well as >live bait. Here are the full data from our unintended experiment. We caught fish on jigs and minnows at the same rate (1 fish for 2 casts) on two different days, first Monday and then Friday. Did not try Gulp on Monday, only on Friday. On Friday, we were catching fish on half the casts right up to the moment we switched to Gulp; then and only then did the catch rate drop off. Two of us fishing together in my boat on Monday, and three folks on Friday, saw exactly the same effects. This suggests that we did not deplete the fish by over-catching them on minnnows. All but one of the fish were small, 12 to 14 inches, probably males. Got one fish in the slot, about 19 inches. We kept only one or two of the bigger fish each day. In terms of a control experiment, two guys fishing near us on Monday, but not exactly in the hot spot, caught far fewer fish on either Gulp or minnows. I could not say how they did on Gulp vs minnows, just that they caught many fewer fish, mainly because they were not within range of the same piece of structure we were fishing. Almost all the strikes came as our jig was retrieved over an obstacle on the bottom, not sure what it was, rock or tree trunk. This is one of several cases where we think we have caught the same fish, or small group of fish, repeatedly. Once my wife got the same small walleye 10 times in one night. Anyone else see this?"
557193,scar,2006-05-13 07:35:00,196,"hi guys, heading up to lac seul may 26 -30. minnows are to expensive and hard to keep. see that gulp has 3'' minnows. the pearl silver (white) and smelt (greyish silver) look like they should work. i have used the gulp leeches and crawlers before and they worked very well but that has always been when the water is warm. i know early the fish want minnows. in the past we have made up and used the salted/borax minnows that we then freeze but it's kind of a pain in the ###. anyone used the gulp minnows before? also, any good spots anyone is willing to share from either the hudson landing or the deception landing? scar"
557213,Guest,2006-05-14 06:53:00,0,I would not take ANY live bait!!! We use lots of gulp and Pink worked best!! I'm sure live bait would be helpful if conditions arrive but gulp will still be good enough if bite is tough. Don't waste your $$. DL
557234,Guest,2006-05-14 21:25:00,0,Seems like color doesnt matter with the gulp- last year we used the bright yellow gulp minnow and worked great- we had crawlers and all in all the gulp worked just as well if not better Good luck

Did they work jigging for you?"
557238,jigman 2003,2006-05-15 06:47:00,981,"I've been using the gulp minnows for jigging with good success. I think they outperform regular plastics, but I catch fish on both. No live bait here, but I do a fly-in. You may want to try the 4"" minnow with the split tail too. A little less ""action"" than the curly tail grub, could be helpful in cold water."
557267,Guest,2006-05-15 14:01:00,0,"Last year I took the smelt colored gulp minnows on a fly in in early June and tipped it with just a small piece of crawler and it worked great. Good luck, Robby"
557283,Guest,2006-05-15 18:45:00,0,tim- yes we used them for jigging- time of year was mid july fishing 15 to 25 feet hope you have a good trip next time thanks
557325,Guest,2006-05-16 15:05:00,0,Nothing beats live bait on Lac Seul. You may be able to fool some of the fish some of the time but not all the fish all the time. My personal favorite non-live bait is Dough Ball. Luv catching those CARP.
