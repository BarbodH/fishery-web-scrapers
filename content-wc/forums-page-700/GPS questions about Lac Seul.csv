A few questions: 1) Are there any handheld units or maps that are user friendly for Lac Seul? 2) Assuming I get a Fishfinder-GPS combo, what is the map to get for Lac Seul? Consensus seems to be Navionics but am curious if any anglers have first hand experience? 3) Any other GPS advice would be appreciated, specifically for this body of water Please reply with any remarks. As you can all imagine, I am getting very excited to get out on the water. Thanks Jared Michalson"

You get a very good topo map of the all the area. It looks like a paper map on the screen. Have it in a H2O and have compared it to my paper maps of the lake and it is the same. $99. on line from Lowrance. There is no depth marking on the map."
