558046,Trailerguy,2006-06-04 15:18:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b] Kansas, Well that's an intersting recolection, it just isn't correct. I travel hwy 105 at least monthly from April until October. The water from Cliff Lake runs into Cedar lake right under the hwy. It Then flows generally north/northwest through, Perrault lake, across the falls and into Wabaskang, and on to Wine Lake. That's why they referr to the chain of lakes as the Cedar River System. The gravel road you referred to (Cedar Point Road) is at least 10 miles south of Perrault Falls, and crosses the tip of Nelson Lake on the way into Cedar Point Resort. Oh, by the way I have a map in my right hand as I type. You can look at their website as well. http://www.cedarpointresort.ca/fishing.html All of Jackfish and Perrault lakes are north of that gravel road, off hwy 105, and Perrault Falls is obviously on the north west corner of Perrault Lake. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

557695,Guest,2006-05-25 16:06:00,0,Headed up to Cedar Lake from June 3rd to June 10th. Looking for a report how walleye fishing has been so far this spring. Always have fished this lake in mid to late August and have done fairly well. Any tips for June fishing would be greatly appreciated.
557698,Skyraptor,2006-05-25 18:25:00,291,"Hey Lonewolf, what resort are you staying at? Fished Cedar quite a few times about 5 years ago."
557711,nitroman,2006-05-25 22:27:00,368,"I will be there that week also. We go the same week every year so I may be able to give you a few spots to try. We stay at Cedar Point Resort how about you? Do you you like to backtroll,drift,or jig? If you like to backtroll musky bay has always been a good area along with both the the long narrows and the short narrows up past the burnt out bidge area. If jigging is your game try the small cut-thru near the south sanctuary or peephole lake between the islands right on top of the saddle. There are alot of area's around east cedar to start let me know where you are staying maybe we can meet up on the water sat afternoon and I can point out some of our favorites. It would be nice to meet a fellow WC'er that goes to the same lake. Scott"

557721,Guest,2006-05-26 08:12:00,0,We are staying at Jerry & Ellie's Cedar Lake Camp for the 4th year. They have been great hosts. We primarily fish the east end of Cedar for the most part. Normally we will either drift or jig but don't usually do alot of backtrolling. I am familiar with the saddle in Peephole Lake. That was one of the spots that I was going to head to first. Maybe we can meet up on the water....we should be in camp between 2 and 3 p.m. on the 3rd.
557788,nitroman,2006-05-27 20:43:00,368,"Lonewolf, Look for a cedar point resort boat (red) and a guy wearing a yellow bass pro hat (me) we will be in and around the east side of cedar most of the time come on over and say hi and we can trade hotspots if there are any ! See you up north and good luck. Scott"
557949,ksboy2,2006-06-01 12:59:00,38,"i fished cedar lake a few years back and was very disappointed. they had just implemented their slot and we caught very few fish. walleye were nearly impossible. we did hit smallmouth a couple of days and only a few small pike were caught. the highlight of the trip was my buddy hooking a 50+inch muskie. the best muskie fishing is strait across the lake from cedar point resort there is a small bay that most overlook. it is a real hotspot. fish both channels leading into it and don't overlook the back of the bay. in my opinion, the best fishing is right across the bay from the cedar point lodge. there is an island that you can see from the dock. fish the west side of it. there is also a huge weedbed running off the east side. we caught smallmouth on the east bank just south of the old burned bridge and on both points south of it. we headed down the lake one full day and fished big bays for pike with very little success. i don't think you need to travel far from cedar point to catch fish. hopefully the slot has helped their fishery. services/cabins/boats were all top notch. kirk miller mapleton,ks"
557985,ankorklankor,2006-06-02 06:52:00,273,Which Cedar Lk are you taking about? We fish Cross Bay on Cedar Lk Manitoba. We have made this trip the last 5-6 years and stay at Moak Lodge near Grand Rapids. We are leaving early on the 3rd also.
