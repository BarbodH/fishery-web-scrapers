557934,Skylane,2006-06-01 07:08:00,101,"Lots of northerns, the lake is shallow and you can find them everywhere, smallmouth numbers seem to be good. In my opinion the walleye fishing is very sub-par to say the least, on size and numbers. It is sad when the locals tell how the fishing used to be. Yes, you will catch walleye and maybe even a big one, but you will have to work at it. There is no real slot limit like Lac Seul and from my understanding the local camp owners don't promote conservation and appear not to encourage returning the bigger ones to the water. Your camp owners (wife) goes out relentlessly every day trying to catch enough walleye for the Wednesday night fish frey. It is a pretty lake, just to bad it is not being managed. If you get a chance, take a day trip to Lac Seul, it is about an hour north and will show you what walleye fishing should be. You will enjoy your stay on Dinorwic-Wabigoon. Please post when you get back and let us know how it went."

Go to the southeast end and take the channel into (Sp?) Kamanasa Bay. Fish west side of 1st island that you come to in the bay. It can be ok at times. Also Turtle pond has been known to produce decent fish. ALso the east side of the bay is pretty good as well. The other bay off of Dinorwic is Stanawan (Sp?) try Moose bay that comes off of that. It can yeld large dark walleyes and big Pike. Other than that I would try the river mouth on the east side of the lake and some of the islands. Graveyard, Gull, North Marker, ect. Usually fish jigs and spinners. Minnows and worms. Hope this helps. Might also want to try the Swede lakes off of Wabagoon. ON ON Sparrow"

We were only up for three days and we spent all of them fishing around a small rock island about 4 or 5 miles from camp on the east side of the lake near a point with some sort of big marker where the lake divides. We were having some luck near an island colse to there, when we saw one of the guys who were friends of the owners fishing there. We caught mostly eyes and a few decent northerns and perch. Few people in camp were catching squat, but hopefully you will do better."
