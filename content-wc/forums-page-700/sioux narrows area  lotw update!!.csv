557863,Guest,2006-05-30 13:35:00,0,"J/M, I too leave Friday. Try looking under witchbay.com. It seems to me that the reports are a little slow coming in. Must be because the fishing is so good they are not taking the time to write. Good Luck"

The 29"" walleye and the 38"" pike on a silver blue husky jerk, the other 37"" pike on chartreus crank and the 43"" muskie on a silver minnow. Jiggin with white plastic grub worked well. Cliff Island, Big Narrows Island, we caught majority of our fish. The fish were extremely aggresive, even with the 90 degree weather. Have a great time."
