557478,Guest,2006-05-21 21:47:00,0,We just recently got our first dog and plan on taking it with us to Canada. Couple of questions: 1) Is rabies vaccine paperwork all that you need? 2) Do you normally get stopped when crossing into Canada with a dog? Thanks in advance

We have crossed several times every year since 1993. The rabies certificate is needed and will sometimes be asked for. We have been asked only once what was in the dog food. We always feed our dogs food made with lamb and rice. Never had a problem. The beef issue was during dust ups between governments about Chronic Wasting Disease."
557955,1shooter,2006-06-01 14:10:00,1493,That's what I thought too but when I called my vet today they informed me they are now requiring something different that requires you to bring your dog in for a visit. Now I'm worried. Does anyone know of a number you can call to find out?
557958,Guest,2006-06-01 14:41:00,0,"Your vet is probably thinking of a Health Certificate, which requires an examination. Canada doesn't require a Health Certificate for dogs crosssing for a short vacation with their owner - just a rabies certificate. Your vet should be able to give you a rabies certificate without examining your dog, as long as the dog is up to date."
