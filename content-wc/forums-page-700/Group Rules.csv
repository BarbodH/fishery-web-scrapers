557895,jigman 2003,2006-05-31 09:09:00,981,"The problem with some guys who go to Canada is that they are used to their wives taking care of them. They don't know how to cook, and they haven't done a dish for decades. It only takes one guy to ruin the trip. You don't know that a guy is like that until you spend a week with him. That's why it's nice to get a functional group together and keep them together. I've found that's tough to do."
557896,Guest,2006-05-31 10:33:00,0,If I wanted all those rules. I would have stayed in the Navy and fished off of a big boat.
557909,Guest,2006-05-31 15:59:00,0,"I'm with ya, all those rules would drive me nuts. I've been going with the same group for years and have had no problems. Call me lucky I guess. The last thing I want to see when I get into a cabin 500 miles from home is a ""to do"" list posted on the wall. If I or anyone else in the group doesn't know what ""to do"" we should stay home. To me it's a man trip and a book a matches shouldn't be near the bathroom.................give a guy a little complimentary smell once in awhile. Your up in Canada in the middle of nowhere..........toughen up a bit. Anyone want to go to Canada with me?"
557913,Guest,2006-05-31 18:49:00,0,"Our core group of 3 guys has stayed contant over the past 25+ years, but we've had up to 14 total go a few years, and now usually keep it at 6 or 8 now. Yes, the bigger the group, the harder it seems to coordinate things. But we have learned a few things over the years about everyone sharing the load. You guys that have never had any 'slakers' on a trip are very lucky. We had case where a father and his 2 sons came on the trip and expected to be waited on hand and foot by everyone else. When everyone else was cleaning fish, preparing dinner, washing dishes, etc. these jokers were sitting in their easy chair, knocking back several cold ones, and commenting on how it would have been nice to had a salad or something else with supper, or who ever cooked the fish on the grill didn't do as well as they should have. In fact, it didn't take the rest of the group more than 2 days to start 'laying down the law', but that didn't even work with these guys--when one was asked to help clean fish one evening, the comments from all 3 were 'find someone else to do it -- we don't clean fish', then when 2 were asked by the cook to help set the table, the father said that 'they don't do womens work'; come to find out they didn't dump the trash, wouldn't start a fire for shore lunch, gather wood, change the water in the leeches, get ice for the leeches, do the dishes, didn't help share the expenses like they should have, and didn't carry a single thing into/from the cabin when loading/unloading the boats. Yet, they were the first ones to leave the table, be at the table for dinner, complain about how sickly the leeches looked at the end of the week, and how small the shorelunch fire was.... you get the picture. By the end of the week I expected to see all 3 laying face down in the water at the end of the dock. Needless to say this was the ""tensest"" trip we've ever had, and it was made clear to these 3 toward the end of the week that they were not invited the following year. We don't publish our rules, but do talk about them to newbies. If someone has a newbie in mind for joining the group, it's his responsitiblity to make sure their 'head is screwed on right', that they understand how things work, etc. before they are even asked to join the group. Tough, I guess so, but one or two 'flakes' can ruin a trip for the rest of the guys. ...just our groups policy. If you can't live by our rules, you probably won't get asked to go in the first place, or you'll be told about 'things' while you're there. If one can't live by our rules, maybe they should stay home. Chuck"
557916,MN_Moose,2006-05-31 19:01:00,965,"Chuck, That is good evidence why some rules or basic understanding is needed. Sure you didn't imvite the father and two sons the next year but I could bet it about ruined everyone else's vacation that year. For those that say they don't need to have such a list of guidelines... I will bet it's because of people like that the rules are needed."
557924,VMS,2006-05-31 21:22:00,1103,"The group that I have gone with over the past 10 years or so have been doing this for so long the rules go unwritten. Everyone has their job and things work like clockwork. Boat captains are repsonsible for having their boats ready for the day (gas filling primarily, oil, slime rags, etc). This happens while breakfast is being cooked. Those who do not have a ""job"" in the morning are responsible to get snacks and sodas for the boats. In for meal, some are cutting fish, others are cooking, others are washing fish and carrying remains away and burying them. Rookies usually get the remains detail along with moving potties as needed (we camp on an island) cooks don't clean up...other crew members do. To keep tempers at bay, non-captains switch boats every day...we try to get every person on the trip to fish with everyone else at least once. We do have to watch who is with who when, but that has become easier over the years. The only thing I miss is fishing with my father since we are both captains. For payment, ours is very similar to how it was mentioned above, but those who's big items (boat, truck, trailer, motors and spares) do get a discount since there is enough expense in readying the equipment, plus the depreciation of a vehicle that can gain miles quickly) We travel 1000 miles one way on this trip... Worth every penny too. Hard to find a good trip with good food/friends for under $500 for a 5 day on water trip... Steve"
557941,Guest,2006-06-01 09:58:00,0,So I am curious why someone didnt tell the father and two sons in no uncertain terms to get off their arse and get with the program? I know we sure would have. No help = No fishing.
557961,Smitty,2006-06-01 15:12:00,1934,"We don't have written rules, but there are a few that are understood. Don't complain about the cooking unless you'd like that honor for the remainer of the week. When we have new guys coming, it's the responsibility of the guy who invited them to 1) explain the rules before we go and 2) explain to the new guy if at any point he's not pulling his weight, irritating others, etc.. Everyone chips in doing something. It might be cooking, cleaning around the cabin, cleaning fish, getting sandwiches ready in the morning, getting bait ready for each boat each day, etc. All money goes into a kitty for trip expenses (other than license, booze, etc). We have a pretty consistent ""core group"" so everything generally goes pretty well, but on occasion a reminder is in order."
557962,Guest,2006-06-01 15:12:00,0,"We've gone for years, and now as the ""older"" guys have stopped going, I've taken over the organization. I send out a letter in early January outlining required deposits. Basically, so I don't get stuck with the cabin security deposit. SO I take the estimate per guy cabin rent, and tell the guys that I need a 3rd on 1/15; 2/15 and 3/15. Deposits are non-refundable. If someone had to cancel for a geniune emergency, we have agreed that we would discuss it on the trip, and refund afterward. Or if its far enough ahead, and we found someone else to go they would be refunded. Cabin is thus paid for. Food is bought by me the day or two before, then on the last afternoon in camp, I tell them what they owe, and any other charges (ice, bait, etc.) License and booze, you're on your own, but we do agree on how many cases per guy. Actually worked out this year, as we had a cancellation the NIGHT BEFORE (my brother no less, for a non-emergency and he is on the hook for the cash, and knows it."
557982,Guest,2006-06-01 22:16:00,0,"We did tell the father and 2 sons that they weren't doing their fair share and needed to help with things. (Several times we even gave them specific examples of what they could do to help out.) It didn't help the situation at all, just seemed to p*#@ them off. They had their own boat, and toward the end of the week they would eat breakfast and immediately go out fishing, leaving everything else to the rest of the group--kinda like kicking dirt in everyones face, so to speak. It was a bad situation, and on Friday they just packed their bags and left on their own while we were out fishing and without telling anyone--stiffing the group with their share of the bill for the cabin we had rented for the week. [That was a good lesson--another rule: everyone pays for the cabin ahead of time now.] This was the worst example of problems we've had over the years. [Who would have thought a 45 year old man, and his 19 and 22 year old sons would have acted this way.] They literally thought they were going to be waited on the whole trip, at the expense of the others. All they did was argue/complain, watch others do the work, eat, drink and fish. The capper was when the 19 year old caught a roll of TP on fire while playing with matches in the bathroom. Luckily, it didn't do any real damage and just filled the cabin up with smoke, but it sure got to some of the guys. The 3 of them thought it was pretty funny. You could have cut the tension with a chain saw--there was a lot of words exchanged over that one. Chuck"

I guarantee you those a--holes would have been starving after the first day and left on shore. I had one trip with a guy like that and had to be restrained from ""educating him."" I spend summers in a cottage on LOTW and have many people come up to visit and fish. But I let them know beforehand with a list I made up years ago what is expected. That way there are no hard feelings, no misunderstandings and everyone can have a good time. An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure."
557995,Hammerhead Herb,2006-06-02 09:31:00,259,You got that right. They didn't want to set the table because it was women's work? There would have been 3 less settings at the table at our camp.
557996,Guest,2006-06-02 10:02:00,0,"We have had a couple of new guys that are back for a third time. The rest of the group have been together for 15 years. They are younger and think their mothers are still around to clean up after them. We have never needed rules until these guys came around. They are great guys otherwise, but slobs. These new rules will be strictly enforced/ 1. If you want to sleep in a bed full of dirty dishes, do not help after dinner. I am certain that your dishes will end up there. 2. If you want to get splashed with hot oil, go ahead and decide to eat shore lunch while everyone else is still working to prepare things. 3 If you want to see if your fishing tackle floats, just leave EVERTHING behind in the boat for everyone else to carry up."
557997,Smitty,2006-06-02 10:15:00,1934,I like those rules.. :cheers:
558014,Guest,2006-06-03 05:47:00,0,"reading these posts is painful. Too many people are wound to tight and I wonder how most of you can enjoy themselves worring about details. I go with the same group of 10-14 guys every year. Not everyone can make every year but the group remains pretty constant. No rules are mentioned as everyone is kind caring and considerate. When the core of the group leaders lead by example through working endlessly on chores without complaining or asking for assistance it becomes contangeous and all is good. It great to see every year the same people are doing the same jobs. It's amazing how each year is always the same from the group who sees how much wood can be put in the wheel barrel, to the group of fish cleaners, potatoe cutters, fish cooker, chili stirrer, fire tender, brat cookers on the fire and the guys who get up first and prepare coffee and cantelope.... the list goes on. It's nearly impossible to tell one year from another. I find the group I go with very unique and special and is the single biggest factor that make the trip a blessing, more so than the fishing and walleye lunches. Everyone pitches in on some level and if one is at a lesser level, no problem there is plenty of coverage with the amount of guys, and everyone has the same intentions, no hard feelings. I am truely blessed by these friends most of whom I only see once a year on this trip."
558015,Guest,2006-06-03 06:33:00,0,Sounds like our group. One of the most special things is when that first time Canada fisherman joins us and finds the utopia he is looking for or when a son or grandson makes his first trip and sees how teamwork creates unity and organazation.
558023,Guest,2006-06-03 13:11:00,0,we usually have same fishing partner all week and use Boat Master - Minnow system. Boat Master runs the boat and makes all fishing decisions that day. Minnow is in charge of bait gas lunch beer and any thing else Boat Master requests. Found to be a good system no arguing over where to fish or how to fish just easier. A good Boat Master does not abuse Minnow as we swich positions everyday so revenge can be factor. Found to be a lot of fun and everyone gets chance to fish the way they wanna fish . Also catch alot of crap if Boat Master does not put Minnow on Fish. Minnow usally has best day catches most fish and has lots of time to drink beer. Sometimes we have 3 in boat. Third guy in is called Boat #### and sits in middle of boat and takes crap from both Boat Master and Minnow. Boat #### is not allowed to make eye contact or speak with Boat Master and is at mercy of Minnow. Of course all is in good fun and makes for a lot of good laughs on the water.
558024,Guest,2006-06-03 13:32:00,0,"Forgot one rule on coming home: No one, but no one tells the wives that someone can actually cook, or can clean up, make beds, cook, or wash dishes religiously. Don't raise false expectations at home."
557970,Guest,2006-06-01 16:19:00,0,"2 bloody marys for breakfast,a 12ver for lunch, stoli for cocktail hour,6er for dinner.. a little fishing in between. just kidding(not!!) actually outside of chores, we also designate a driver for each days fishing, as the driver decides where and how to fish for that particular day. weve had blowups (and ive had to kick some ####)because some guys wanted to jig and the other dummies wanted to troll. this takes care of all those problems. i am heading to white pine lodge on lotw in 13 hrs, and i will give a professional report on my return. everyone be safe and have fun.see you in a week.... bender out"
557728,NateW,2006-05-26 10:00:00,96,"Shortly after our second trip we made a few simple rules that we all felt would help everyone get along and spread out some of the mundane ""chores"" that are done around camp. Some make sense, some are a little strange, but I'm sure some folks have some good ones to add. Here are some of the rules our group abides by: If you didn't help cook then you must help clean-up. The cook never does dishes. At the end of the day, the guys not cleaning fish must bring beers to the guys who are. If you fall asleep anywhere other than your bed, you are extending an open invitation to be messed with. Do not be surprised if strange pictures of you materialize a couple weeks after the trip. However anybody sleeping in their own bed is off-limits for pranks. Never get another beer without asking if anyone else needs one. Whoever takes the last cup of coffee makes a new pot. TVs and portable DVD players are not allowed. Radios are permitted but must be turned off immediately after hearing the updated weather forecast. Complaining about fat, cholesterol, grease, red meat, carbs or calories is not allowed. If you have a problem with this you should have gone to the spa with the wives. Everyone must have a beer for breakfast at least once during the week. If you give away any secret spots and/or tactics to another cabin, you will be killed and eaten by the rest of the group. Never ask how much longer somebody is going to be in the bathroom. Everybody takes a turn behind the wheel on the way up or back. If we need to stop and eat while driving, the guy behind the wheel selects the restaurant. We have a couple more, but they would probably get sensored. I'm sure there are some other good ones out there, so let's see them!"
557796,Schief79,2006-05-28 08:53:00,11,"Some good ones Nate. We go to a different fly-in every year and are pretty organized. A month or so before we leave home we all (usualy 8 of us) get a letter from our organizer with our menu for the week, breakfast and dinner. We also get a listing of chores, who is the cook, helper, dish washer, cabin clean-up and boat gas fillers. And we know who fishes with who each day. Plus we know each day what type contest we are having for the fishing contest. Boat againt boat, or top bunks against bottom bunks etc. He also gives us a list of what to bring, what would be nice to have and what not to bring. Gary and I are retired Navy so we are used to being organized and it makes for a nice trip. Lists are posted in the cabin so everyone knows what their job/chore for that day is. He picks me up in Georgia on his way from Florida on Wed and we head to Canada and Lake Wastayanipi. Hope everyone has a safe and fun trip. Go Navy!"
557798,jerry bark,2006-05-28 09:50:00,822,"Great job nate! my favorite: Complaining about fat, cholesterol, grease, red meat, carbs or calories is not allowed. If you have a problem with this you should have gone to the spa with the wives. LMAO have fun jerry"
557858,NateW,2006-05-30 12:39:00,96,"I am kind of the Organizer of our group too, we also have a ""Treasurer"". Everyone pays the same amount into the kitty and that covers, food, gas up and back and any other ""group"" expenses. We get our money in to him a week before we go and het gets traveller's checks--er, I mean ""cheques"", and we buy groceries from the kitty too. Everyone is responsible for their own drinks and licenses, but other than that everything comes out of the kitty. We also do a menu well ahead of time and make a shopping list from the menu. We don't specify what dish on what night, it's just kind of what everyone feels like. We had one year where a couple guys didn't really want to do anything but catch fish and drink beer--and nothing else. So we made some rules--some serious and some not, and everyone has pitched in since then. As for the ""red meat, grease, carbs, etc....as I'm packing, my wife will ask me about ten times, ""Are you SURE you packed your Lipitor??"" She knows us too well...."
557875,Guest,2006-05-30 20:20:00,0,"Every year about a month before our trip we will send a newsletter out to everyone in the group (normally 10-12) giving details of our flight schedule, what to bring and anything else inmportant to the trip. We also include a two page section with all of the betting rules and fines. Each year we normally add a new rule or fine based on situations that arose on the trip the previous year. We have fines for being over 15 minutes late to shore lunch ($50 per boat to walleye kitty), lost or damaged motor/boat parts (expense shared by boat only), not catching a walleye over the slot....It keeps everybody honest and adds a little competition to the trip."

557878,Guest,2006-05-30 20:48:00,0,"We have similiar rules, and a few twists: Each person in our group cooks one evening meal. At the end of the meal he does not have to help with dishes, cleaning up, etc. No one is allowed to relax for the evening until all the dishes, cleaning up, etc. is done after dinner, except for the cook. That way, things wrap up pretty quickly after dinner -- you'd be suprised at how fast 5 guys can wash and dry dishes! Everyone helps load the boats at the ramp, and unload the boats when we initially get to the cabin. It doesn't matter if all the 'stuff' is in/out of your own boat or not. No one can start rigging rods, arranging boats, etc. until everything is unpacked and stowed in the cabin, and we all agree that we are settled in. We make it a point to tell newbies about the need to 'pitch in', share chores, etc. well before the trip. That way, newbies know what is expected, and what can happen if they don't meet expectations (they won't get re-invited to join the group again next year). We use real life examples of problems we've had with 'slakers' from previous trips, so they know exactly what we are talking about. Doors must always be shut after entering/exiting the cabin, because of the flys and mosquitos. The box of matches in the bathroom is not there for a purpose and not intended for play! Chuck"
557890,jigman 2003,2006-05-31 07:33:00,981,"I've got a question for those of you who have these rules. Do you post them or is it a verbal thing? Some people say they ""hear"" what you're saying, but they aren't really ""listening"". Group dynamics are a huge part of an enjoyable trip. I've found that a group of more than four gets tough to coordinate. Everyone has a different view of what their trip should be. Some guys look at it as a vacation, while others (me) look at it as a FISHING trip. Things should be coordinated so that meals, clean up, etc. all get done in a timely manner so you can get back out on the water. If everyone would pitch in, that is easier to do."
557891,Guest,2006-05-31 08:06:00,0,"My group is all family and we dont have any ""rules"". We all get along and pitch in when needed. Most of the rules cited we generally follow, but not to any extreme. Many times, we will have the fathers sit down with a cocktail while us kids (if you can call mid-30s a kid) clean the fish, etc. I don't think I would have much fun if I had to constantly worry about some rule that I might break. I can see where they are necessary if you have a big group or a group of people you dont know that well, but I am mighty selective about who I vacation and fish with. This has been an interesting read. Usually we tell the youngest guy that he has to do dishes all the time. Of course that doesnt work all that well, but it is worth a try."
