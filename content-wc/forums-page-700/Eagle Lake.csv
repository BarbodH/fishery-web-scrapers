557978,Guest,2006-06-01 21:15:00,0,Wea re leaving for Eagle lake in a couple of weeks Am info for locating walleyes this time of the year and types of bait. Thanks
557980,Guest,2006-06-01 21:27:00,0,"I would be looking for mud flats and emerging weed in the 8 to 14 foot range. A lot will depend on weather and what areas of the lake you are fishing. Wind, cloud cover and whatever insect hatch is happening at the time will also be important. Jig and minnow or crawler and spinner rigs would work, also trolling a bait such as the Rapala tail dancer in the shad color pattern has worked for me in the past. Fishing has been good so far so I think you will do well."

557989,Guest,2006-06-02 08:20:00,0,I have not found that to be the case so far as most walleyes have been quite shallow but it does seem that some of the traditional spring spots are not producing. The fish seem either clustered around micro-spots or somewhat scattered.....it seems important to pay attention to those small shoreline features that may be holding fish and are easy to overlook.

557999,Guest,2006-06-02 11:03:00,0,Sure you can. I don't myself but I see others occasionally doing it. Probably a good idea on the clear waters of the west arm.
