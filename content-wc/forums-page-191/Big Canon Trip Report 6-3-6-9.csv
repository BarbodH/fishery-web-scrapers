We always have weed edges to fish. This year even with the normal ice out, many cloudy, cold days have slowed the weed growth. Water was about 2-2.5 ft. low from normal. Water temps at the beginning of the week were 62F on the wind blown points. At the end of the week after three days near 80F the same areas had a surface temps of 72F. The weeds are emerging but still deep. Found a small pocket here and there where they reached 3'. Most of the areas are still 1' or less. This was actually a good thing for our group. Had to change our walleye strategy and fish totally new spots. It was like being on a new body of water. Big shout out to NWWalleye who was guiding a group of teens in camp. He gave us some tips/spots to try, and provided humor during the evenings. His groups did fantastic fishing for different species everyday. Nice to see a new generation enthusiastic about the outdoors, and they were with the right guide for their trip. We fished our go to spots the first day with limited success. Found out, that it was going to be more of a spot on the spot bite. If your were 5' either way you were off the5'-7' spot. Started fishing shallow-5' rock and reef structure, by pitching into those areas. At times we were catching them in 3' of water If you could find a small pocket of weeds (last years-dead) it would hold fish. By the end of the week they had moved to the 10'-12' structures and some other traditional spots. Bigger fish also. We fished those spots hard early in the week-nada. I am thinking the guys in camp for the next three weeks are going to have a field day. Not complaining, we caught plenty of fish all day, just not the absurd numbers (100-140) fish/day of past years. Had plenty of walleyes for three shore lunches and take home. Our big fish was only 25"", but two 31"" fish were CPR by other groups. That left 2.5 day of fun fishing. Hit the shallows for Northerns. Fast and easy action. They hit everything we threw- Top water prop baits, spoons, paddletails, rapalas, crankbaits, etc. Quite a few keepers just under the slot. Three over the slot-returned. Many in the slot. Only had three guys keeping them, but they filled a ticket in less than a half day. Always fun to catch fish 40 yards from the boat and then catch a follower right next to the boat. Most pike were caught off the rocks on wind blown points near weedy flat bays. Smaller ones towards shore. Bigger ones a little deeper in the middle of the bay. We didn't target smallmouth on this trip, but we caught them in rock rubble while fishing for the pike. The folks who did target them in camp had a blast and never ventured further than 10 minutes from camp. Great rock, sand, and timber structure in those areas. One boat in our group did target them on a portage lake, they did OK, but had a number of Muskie follows at the same time. The musky would stop at the boat and stare at them even when the lure was removed from the water-creepy. We caught perch while fishing for walleyes, and managed to bring home 63 of them. That'll make a nice a fish fry for some of our guys. Biggest pike of the week (37.5"") caught on 1/8th ounce jig while perch fishing at the end of the day. Saving the best for last. We have one boat that loves Lake Trout fishing. This year they were very high in the water column. Most were taken in the top 13' feet of water. All were taken trolling diving rapalas in water 25'-33' deep. Had their limit in 15 minutes the first day. Pattern stayed the same until the last day. We all followed them out one night and all had the same quick success. Ate them exclusively for shore lunch one day. That species is best eaten fresh, and the fellas had no trouble replacing them the next day. After the warmup they still caught a few high in the water, but it was obvious they were moving deep. Fishing conditions were not in our favor initially, but it was fun to successfully adapt and make it another great trip. We also have a weird event or two happen during the week. This year a pole was lost over the side and retrieved by dragging a 3/4 oz Little Cleo. All happened in 5 minutes. Also had a walleye half swallow a perch in the live well. New meaning to last meal. Hope you all have a great trip this year."

It was also good to hear that a youth group was up there. Jim Booi had camp when I was last there. Enjoy the rest of your season.
