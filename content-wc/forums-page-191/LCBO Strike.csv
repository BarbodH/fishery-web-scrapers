5611113,Rock Lobstar1,2017-06-14 21:13:00,134,Beer stores will still be open but I'm 98% positive that the lcbo is the only place to buy hard stuff.

5611857,Lovetofish,2017-06-15 08:45:00,458,"If you can, just bring it with you and pay the duty. Keep your receipts when you buy it. Cheaper anyway. If your not way over the limit they may not have you pay the duty anyway. That's my experience."
5611889,LOW1,2017-06-15 09:06:00,2828,"I would assume that the ""agency"" LCBOs would stay open. These are usually smaller LCBO outlets inside other stores. The grocery store in Nestor Falls, for example, is an agency LCBO.But a strike may dry up supplies to these agencies, especially if truckers, etc honor the picket line.Yet another reason to invade Ontario."
