Couple guys expressed interest in stopping along the way for some crappie fishing. Anyone have any suggestions on good crappie lakes along Hwy 502 or Hwy 17 that might be worth trying? Initial research via google points to Wabigoon or Rainy as decent options. Big Sawbill was brought up by someone in our group as well. But if anyone has any personal experience, would be great to hear. Appreciate any insight."
