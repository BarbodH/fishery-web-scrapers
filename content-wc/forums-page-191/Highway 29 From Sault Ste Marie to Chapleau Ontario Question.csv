But it is very picturesque and worth the drive........So after you go north of Thessalon and get out of farm country and 40 miles or so of small lakes and 50 mph driving , you eventually go down a steep hill and the highway begins to follow the Mississaugi River , this is unbelievably picturesque, if some one is behind you let them pass by so you can drive slower. Also keep to your side of road ALWAYS , this short cut highway 129 from Timmins is used by many logging trucks . But that half hour of driving along the river is great, and many sharp turns. Eventually you head back up the hill out of the valley and you are able to get speed back up to 50 or 60 MPH , long straight sections the closer you get to Chapleau........also very few gas stops so don't count on any just in case you miss the open one."

5600113,Habitual Eyer,2017-06-09 20:24:00,144,where are you headed? We went to Windermere and found wawa route much easier. took both ways that trip.
5600121,Sportdog,2017-06-09 20:29:00,6735,Yes. Headed to HDL. We went the Wawa route last time.
5600425,Habitual Eyer,2017-06-10 06:14:00,144,When you headed up Sportdog ?
5600481,Sportdog,2017-06-10 06:29:00,6735,July 8th-14th. Went early June last year but am taking two of my grandsons this year and going to try the summer fishing.

5605097,Sportdog,2017-06-12 16:16:00,6735,Are you talking about going through Wawa or the route I mentioned? Thanks
5605249,kzoofisher,2017-06-12 17:08:00,5144,Up 129 east of SSM. The hills are small but steep as you go along the river valley and on many of them you can't see the other side until you crest and start down again. More of a roller coaster than the Superior shoreline.
5605273,Sportdog,2017-06-12 17:12:00,6735,OK. Thank You
