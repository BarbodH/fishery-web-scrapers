I am planning on taking my wife, who also likes to catch fish (doesn't like fishing unless we are ""catching""). I was wondering if anyone had any input on a good fishery, at a reasonable price. I was going to bring my boat, not sure if that is a good idea or not? Let me know your thoughts on bringing your own rig. I would like to know if anyone has been to any lakes they loved. Any kind of feedback would be appreciated. PS- We are from Pittsburgh, PA-- keep this in mind for how far we may have to travel. Thanks!"

They are all operated by great people. It's quite simple. They would be out of business if they weren't on great bodies of water and operated by great people. To me, it's a question as to selecting a body of water and fishing lodge that best meets your needs. For example, you might want to ponder the following considerations when selecting a body of water and fishing lodge:Fly-in vs. Boat-in vs. Drive-ToType of water: river vs. lake - not everyone is comfortable on the other type of water.Size of water: small vs. medium vs. large. Do you want to drive your boat one hour to get to the fishing hole vs. five minutes. Do you want to keep the lodge in sight?Species of fish: What species of fish do you want to target. Not all lakes are well know for every species of fish (Size or numbers).Level of services: Do you want to be pampered or rough it?Camp atmosphere: Your wife might not be comfortable in some camps.Equipment: Know what you are getting before you book your lodge - boats, motors, electronics, linens in cabins, etc.American Plan vs. Housekeeping Plan: Do you want to cook or be provided your meals?Time of Season: Weather can be a challenge in the spring or autumn, bugs when the weather is nice.How many other lodges are on the body of water? Do you want to fish with ten other boats or one hundred?It's okay to start with blind referrals, but they are just that. A body of water and fishing lodge might be perfect for someone else, but be a poor choice for you and your wife. All lodges look great on the internet. Consider going to a trade show such as the All Canada Show and meet the lodge owners. When someone recommends a lake/lodge to you, find out why they recommend it. Ask questions!I have a very tricked out Lund Pro-V, but I leave it at home when fishing in Canada. I don't have to deal with reduced gas mileage, blown tires, wheel bearings and the like. I sleep at night during the storm, while the lodge owner is at the dock dealing with boats. I don't have to deal with battery charging, launching and dock fees. The lodge's boat is ideal for the way that I fish.I hope that above perspectives are helpful. Regards....."
5605977,Mojo-NC,2017-06-13 06:18:00,1929,"^^^^ What he said! Very sage advice indeed! ^^^ One other consideration if you choose to take your own boat. Depending on the lake you choose, you may have to travel miles and miles on gravel roads as you get near your fishing destination. Be aware of the potential for boat/trailer damage from thrown rocks."
5607057,mms3rd,2017-06-13 12:07:00,148,I have never been there but I thought about Happy Day Lodge on Windemere Lake a couple years ago.....east of Thunder Bay. I come from the west and decided it was too far to travel. Maybe someone can give you some particulars. There have been posts on this board about the lake.

Pampered-- I want plumbing, that is about it. We can cook our own stuff.Camp atmosphere: Your wife might not be comfortable in some camps. My wife is NOT high maintenance. She will help clean fish and doesn't require anything fancy.Equipment: Know what you are getting before you book your lodge. That's why I was wondering if it was worth it to take my own boat that way I have all the stuff I know. All my stuff works well and I don't have to worry. - boats, motors, electronics, linens in cabins, etc.American Plan vs. Housekeeping Plan: Do you want to cook or be provided your meals? We can cook our own stuff no problem there. Hopefully WALLEYE.Time of Season: Weather can be a challenge in the spring or autumn, bugs when the weather is nice. I was thinking Spring-Early Summer.How many other lodges are on the body of water? Do you want to fish with ten other boats or one hundred? I don't mind being around some people. Not 100 though.I know that all places aren't the same for everyone but when you go to a show they tell you how great their lodges are and they have about a dozen pictures of big fish and some mounts. I could go there and tell you how great my lodge is with some fish pictures! The websites are all the same as well, ""best fishing in Canada"". That is why I am trying referrals on a fishing forum. If you have been to a lake in Canada, tell me about it. I know my experience could be COMPLETE opposite but I would like to hear from a large group of walleye fisherman where they went and how they liked it. I don't really consider those to be ""blind"" referrals. I am hoping there is a lot of experience available on this forum!It's okay to start with blind referrals, but they are just that.
