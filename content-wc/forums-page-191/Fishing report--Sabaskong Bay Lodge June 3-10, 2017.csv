5602673,Multispecies Guy,2017-06-11 14:44:00,447,"I think I know the weed you're referring to. We found areas with that weed and a few with some scattered cabbage. We tried to find weeds and rocks in as complex a structure as we could. Some complex spots produced bass, walleye, pike, and musky all within a few minute span. I'm sure you're familiar with spots like that, where your pulse beats just a little faster as you approach, anticipating what could be lurking there. That feeling never gets old."
5602865,Roger B MN,2017-06-11 16:57:00,332,Sounds fun! What other areas in Sab did you try? Did you venture east at all or stay mostly around Morson?
5602945,Multispecies Guy,2017-06-11 17:32:00,447,"Miles Bay one day and ventured into Splitrock, Stony Portage, Matheson and Sand Bay as well as around Hay, Knoche, Horseshoe (the one in Sab), King's, Lowe's, Poplar and many of the unnamed islands. Pre-trip plan was to spend a day in Obabikon Lake but another party in camp went there and caught mostly perch and small pike with just 4 bass so we decided not to try to get my boat in there. Definitely a must do on my next trip though. Normally I would cover a little more territory but my 2 boat mates were content sticking close to camp. Actually caught some nice bass from Cedar Island where the camp is located."
5603225,Obabikon,2017-06-11 20:15:00,2370,Shhhhhh.... I love fishing weedbeds.
5603273,Bill Krejca,2017-06-11 20:21:00,6107,Bill
5604985,Further North,2017-06-12 15:32:00,2008,Thanks for the report - we'll be a little east of there starting the 8th.We'll be at Split Rock Lodge with a bunch of musky guys (though I take a decidedly multi-species approach...can't stand spending a whole day on one thing...
5605329,Multispecies Guy,2017-06-12 17:48:00,447,We did well for all species casting the NW shoreline of Sand Bay which is right out your door. Another boat trolled that same shoreline for walleyes and boated a few that we could see. Good luck and have a great trip.
5605361,Bill Krejca,2017-06-12 18:09:00,6107,That Sand Bay shore used to be fabulous for crappies in the fall. The last several times I tried it(it has been a few years) I zeroed out. Glad to see it is being productive. Bill
5605513,Further North,2017-06-12 19:32:00,2008,"Thanks folks, good to know."
5601921,Multispecies Guy,2017-06-11 07:09:00,447,"First time at SBL and first time fishing Sabaskong Bay. 3 people targeting multi species with a focus on SMB. Slow start on new water and hot sunny days. Fishing picked up considerably later in the week with increasing water temps and familiarity with the area. Overall a good bass week with no real big fish, largest at 19"" with the typical fish a hard fighting 14"". VERY pleased with the number and quality of walleyes we caught while casting for bass. Largest eye at 27"" with 2 at 25"" and several in the 20-22"" class. It was no problem catching limits of fish at and just under 18"" for a couple meals. Pike were pike, mostly small with a few decent fish. Biggest a 36"". 6 muskies incidentally caught with a 34"" and 37"" the biggest but follows from a few in the low 40s. Opening week for musky chasers should be very good with active fish on points and rapidly developing weed beds. Also bass should be good for the next week or so as they are still egg laden and we noticed a marked increase in how hard they hit and how much they fought as our week progressed. Water temps started the week in the low to mid 60s and were in the low 70s by week's end. A note on that--those are surface temps and I suspect the water temp a few feet down was 5-10 degrees cooler than that. A couple disappointing things regarding bass fishing--the topwater bite was very slow and the fish seemed to shutdown about 8 in the evening. Both those should trend more positively as the water warms. We caught a lot of our fish on RatLTraps cast to shore with bass being on the 4-6 foot rock flats late in the week. Walleyes were on similar flats but we also caught some in sandy bays. Spinnerbaits in pencil reeds provided a few bass, northerns and a couple walleyes. We also had good action on small cranks. Don't be afraid to sight cast to bigger rocks. You may snag and lose a few lures but it's worth the payoff. We did use light 6"" wire leaders with no noticeable impact on lure action or number of hits. All in all a solid week of fishing. The folks at Sabaskong Bay Lodge are great people and offer a decent product at a good price. They do not run their generator all night but did at our request as we had a couple folks with CPAP machines. Charged us $10/person for the week for the extra diesel and we were happy to pay it. Good docking and our cabin, Heron 1(a duplex), was clean and comfortable with a great screen porch overlooking the lake. I would definitely consider a similar trip to SBL in the future."
5601945,Bill Krejca,2017-06-11 07:15:00,6107,Did you do any fishing in the Hay Island area? Thanks Bill
5601953,Thompmd,2017-06-11 07:28:00,320,"Sounds like a great trip. We used to fish Sabaskong Bay and now fish near Kenora. I always heard the Bass were better in the Kenora area but I can't tell any difference, it's all pretty darn good. Your walleye fishing sounds much better than ours was(but we aren't good walleye fishermen).Thanks for the Report."
5601961,Multispecies Guy,2017-06-11 07:30:00,447,"Yes, one day. Decent bass action, no better or worse than other areas in Sabaskong. Also buzzed out to Miles Bay one day and had very good bass action with lots of walleye but the eyes were smaller with the average around 14"". By week's end, any shoreline with baseball to basketball size rock that was 10' deep under the boat when a cast length from shore and had a few larger rocks to sight cast to produced fish of all species, mostly bass. The bow fisherman casting small cranks ahead of the boat with the other 2 casting lipless cranks tight to shore was a productive technique."
5601993,Thompmd,2017-06-11 07:46:00,320,"curious about the topwater bite, did adding a feather trailer make much difference? Adding a white on or white/red always did for us. We also found the bass to be pretty nomadic, here today, gone tomorrow?"
5602009,Multispecies Guy,2017-06-11 07:46:00,447,"Interesting because I was telling the other 2 in my group that I heard bass fishing is better near Kenora. Helps to hear your experience says otherwise. As for the walleyes, I'd like to claim walleye savant status but we quite honestly stumbled on them as we cast for bass. Once we established the slight variance in walleye location vs bass location we could almost predict when we would catch a walleye. And when the walleyes hit they hammered the baits."
5602025,Multispecies Guy,2017-06-11 07:59:00,447,I didn't throw a topwater all week even though I love topwater. My partners threw them extensively several evenings. They use Pop Rs almost exclusively and I believe they had red hair tails. I wait to see if they catch fish before I switch. I have found Skitterpops and small prop baits to work well in other parts of LOTW. Never considered adding a tail but will give that some consideration. The fish were nomadic for us too. Frustrating at times. Two identical looking shorelines and one would be hot and the other dead.
5602033,Thompmd,2017-06-11 08:00:00,320,"My personal feeling is that it's the same but I think the difference is the KBI and Shoal Lake Classic gets the publicity and quite honestly I think your part of the lake gets no attention from Bass fishermen, shh! Savant, that's funny. I am a jig/minnow to the weedline guy other than what we catch casting. We also took a day and trailered over to Crow(Kakagi) for bass....gorgeous lake and better avg bass IMO and lots of muskie and the water was crystal clear which changes tactics."
5602241,Multispecies Guy,2017-06-11 09:54:00,447,"Kakagi is a lake that's always interested me. Heard it's clear and that it holds huge muskies that never hit a bait, decent walleye and good smallies. While I prefer water clearer than Sabaskong, super clear water presents some challenges as you mentioned. Rainy Lake smallies are on my bucket list too but one of these years I need to find a good camp and stick with it. What I really liked about this trip was that decent size walleyes were shallow and chasing baits and we caught perch, walleye, sauger, muskies, pike, and smallies all on the same baits and using the same tactics. Truly a multi species outing."
5602465,Bill Krejca,2017-06-11 12:29:00,6107,"Re: Shoreline walleye - There is a certain type of weed seen growing close to shore and into the water a ways which many times indicates walleyes nearby. I don't know the name of the weed- not cabbage nor reed. It has a small leaf and protrudes in the air somewhat. Finding that weed has produced well for me at times on LOW, and a few other places. It will be found mixed in with the rocks. Bill"
