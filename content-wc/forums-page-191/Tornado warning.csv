5596249,Pikeslayer8,2017-06-07 17:04:00,1460,"Yeah Skywagon, Brad got it in a few minutes before we reached base with Chris. I didn't dare ask Brad about the extent of damage as this Twin Otter is Brad's baby, but Chris said that they will have plenty of winter work to get er back to shipshape. I sure hope the damage turns out to be minimal, but getting parts for a 1958 DeHavilline Otter is tough."

5587697,Skywagon,2017-06-03 17:10:00,1106,Check out the Otter (not the animal type) washed up against the Government dock in Dryden. Nasty rain and a little hail about 4:30 pm today as I was going through.

5594529,Pikeslayer8,2017-06-06 17:24:00,1460,"We were one of the last group's delivered in that plane. Story goes that one of NWO's new pilots needed to pick up his wife so they could go to the NHL hockey game and while he was waiting at the dock, a waterspout hit, jammed the pontoon under the dock. Heard he said that all he saw was water, in every direction. When I came out on Sunday, the plane was back at NWO's dock and will need a lot of work to get to be operational. Needless to say, spirits were down at Northern Wilderness Outfitters."
5595137,Skywagon,2017-06-07 05:39:00,1106,"They said Brad was the one that flew it back to NWO Sunday morning. I heard the wing was slightly dented, but not structurally significant, there was also some float damage."
5596041,mms3rd,2017-06-07 14:27:00,148,"I'm from Kansas (well, now anyway). Looks like a tornado to me. Check for redheaded girls with annoying dogs."
