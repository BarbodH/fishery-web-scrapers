A few rain showers the first few days but otherwise warm and pleasant. Water temps were 65 when we got there and low 70's when we left. As far as the fishing it was not a normal year. Walleye were very scattered early in the week and by the end, they were anywhere from 4-20 FOW. Jigging was tough as you would only get 1-2 and then have to move to find more. We found a few spots where they were holed up pretty good and we caught our limit quickly. By the end of the week, I started cast jigging to cover more water depths and that is when I hammered them. I had six straight casts with a fish throwing up on shore and bouncing it back. Biggest walleyes for the week were 25.5 and 22.5.As far as crappies, they were staging in 1-3 FOW and most were full of spawn. We caught crappies everywhere we went. Convention bay, peephole and nelson were loaded with them.As usual, perch were hard to find for us but we did manage to get a few jumbos while crappie fishing.Early in the week, pike were MIA or lazy. By the end of the week, they were starting to turn on. It seemed like a down year for pike.Bass were staging but caught most of mine while jig casting for walleye.Other thoughts--I think this coming week will be dynamite but I do feel this is a down year. Lots of other guests felt they weren't catching the size and numbers they normally do.- Caught a walleye for dinner with a cigarette butt in its stomach. I was a but shocked and disgusted. Please mind your trash on the lake.- My buddy caught a river redhorse. I thought it was a sucker but we looked it up back at the lodge. Ontario considers them a species of interest.- I hooked into a crappie between the breastplate while jigging for walleye.- Caught the slob walleye while buddy and I were both relieving ourselves over the side of the boat. Luckily he left the rod securely between the boat seat or the rod would be in the middle of the lake.Good luck to all those who go up and I can't wait to head north again."

Seems like most fishing reports so far state that it's not a typical spring and everyone is having to switch up spots and techniques. Which keeps things interesting I guess. You don't want it to be too easy. I think I'm gonna rig up some butt jigs next time out lol. Jokes aside, that's pretty gross. I don't smoke but i keep one of those cup holder ashtrays in my boat in case I do have smokers on board."

He then did it! Kind of makes me wonder why I spend so much money on fishing tackle.I concur that this year seems a bit odd, especially in terms of walleyes being scattered. I caught very nice fish in 25 fow on rock humps away from shore during the first week of the season. Friends have since told me that the walleyes seem to be returning to ""normal"" patterns revolving around shallower depths along shorelines.Maybe the old adage about not fishing last year's pattern is coming into play.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
