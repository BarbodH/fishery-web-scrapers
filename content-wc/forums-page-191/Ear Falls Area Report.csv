Had the poorest fishing I have had on Lac Seul, but the weather played a part. On Saturday we fished a lot of our normal spots from Lunker Point, the Stumps, Herb's Point and other spots around that area. We found fish, but not the concentrations that we normally see. The boat traffic was the most congested I have witnessed in all my years up there and you had to be trying new spots as many of my normal spots had boats in and out of them. We battled rain and heavy winds. Sunday we tried areas from Steamboat Narrows all the way into McKenzie Bay. Found a fish here and there and then got caught in a thunderstorm with some nasty lightning, heavy wind and rain that made for miserable ride back. Monday was finally a nice day, but windy. It seemed the fish were in the sand, so we set up shop on the on the sand point to the east of Lunker Point. We had a great day. Boated well over 100 walleyes and the size was great. A lot of 18'-22"" fish plus 3-23"", 24"", 2 -25.5"", 27"" and a 28"" and a 35"" northern. It is days like that, that make up for the poor days."
