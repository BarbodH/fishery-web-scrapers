5512746,pjshorthorn,2017-05-01 05:45:00,5654,You figured me out. I know where exactly everything is though PjShorthorn.

There are plenty of non-union entities here, and reducing wages to lowest amount is there goal.There is no argument that unions have been corrupt over the years, but anyone with a decent paying job, with benefits, holidays, weekends, healthcare, etc....Whether they work union or not, have the unions to thank."
5608833,fishmanric,2017-06-14 06:04:00,219,Looks like the strike date has been set to June 26th. This could cause longer wait times at the border.
5608889,pjshorthorn,2017-06-14 06:23:00,5654,I'll already be in Canada with ample supplies on hand for the hootin nanny that week PjShorthorn

5608977,pjshorthorn,2017-06-14 06:56:00,5654,Can't wait to hear how your HB trip to the Holden Island area turns out. I hope you and your group have a blast on Lac Seul. Travel safe. PjShorthorn

5609345,adempsey2.0,2017-06-14 08:48:00,612,Odd. Ive never seen anything like that at any Beer store ive been too. Last time several people brought garbage bags full of empty cans and the cashier didnt even bother counting them. Guess it depends on location.Sent from my SM-G903W using Tapatalk

5506378,Obabikon,2017-04-28 06:50:00,2370,"The Government can get their money either way. They can simply set the prices and tax it. It doesn't really matter who sells it. I am actually perfectly fine with many unions. I am not ok with unions that run a monopoly and regularly threaten to strike. A union that actively competes with an open market can be a good thing. Anytime a system is set up with zero competition, the consumer is the one that loses. True for government, true for Wall Street, true for unions..."
5506498,Thompmd,2017-04-28 07:49:00,320,"I think Unions and the company are the same, businesses trying to do their best for themselves and those they represent. Businesses do the same thing all the time trying to get an edge and the Union is doing the same. IMO, the Consumer ultimately decides where they choose to spend or not spend their dollars."
5506514,v-bay gord,2017-04-28 08:00:00,3168,"It's not the union that has the monopoly...iit's the government. The make up of the union isn't just the liquor store employees, but all Ontario government employees. Your local conservation officer is a member of the same union."
5506594,Obabikon,2017-04-28 08:18:00,2370,Gotcha. MNR officers don't threaten to strike every other year.
5506866,Guest,2017-04-28 10:00:00,0,"Our LCBO staff do a very good job at preventing underage purchasing of product . The Government thru the LCBO is testing the grocery stores to see how that will go, but considering the LCBO helps bring in billions of dollars into the Ontario Government coffers by being the middle man ""seller"" I have no problem with making sure those unionized workers have a fair wage , because their work helps the Ontario government support financially our hospitals and health care systems, and although that may not be the priorities in the USA , we have different priorities and many of us respect the unionized government workers , whether they be LCBO, or nurses , or MNR staff , or ???"
5506890,v-bay gord,2017-04-28 10:11:00,3168,I agree!!!
5506914,LOW1,2017-04-28 10:23:00,2828,"I have a cabin neighbor who swears his father paid for their cabin by bootlegging American cigarettes in the 1940s. Apparently they had an old Plymouth that was hollowed out and stuffed full of American cancer sticks back when they were not sold in Canada.So, I say strike all summer and I will head up with a truck full of cheap American beer. I will be in the overloaded red Ford with the headlights pointed to the moon.At $60 a case it won't be much more than I was paying at the LCBO back when the Loonie was stronger than the dollar."
5507010,v-bay gord,2017-04-28 11:18:00,3168,"Even if the LCBO is on strike the ""Beer Store"" should still be open since they are operated by the brewers, not the government. So fill your truck up with California wine and stop by VBL.!"
5507378,dkrusin,2017-04-28 14:17:00,97,"My guess would be that 80% or more of all alcohol sales in NW Ontario happens between May and September. They won't strike. It will not effect us from south of the border, we'll just buy it here and pay duty on it. A strike in December may get some attention.The beer stores being owned by the brewers is almost as good a racket as owning VBL ."
5507666,pjshorthorn,2017-04-28 16:06:00,5654,"The Beer Store sucks. They have too many rules on returning your empties. I was embarrassed that I had not properly sorted my empties and was told to return home with them. I tried to explain that I lived in the USA and couldn't take them home, but the 82 year old gal staffing the Beer Store didn't give a rip and said to take them home. I think she is on strike every day regardless. Beware of any older gal with blue hair named Bertha Cheeks. It was an interesting border crossing trying to explain to US customs that the Beer Store has strict sorting policies and told me to take all of the empties home with me. They didn't buy my story even though I gave them a copy of the official Beer Store regulations. I had to sort the empties by brand ,at the US border, between the aluminum and glass. The Beer Store sucks !!! Gord, just buy about 58 cases ( + or - a few cases ) of Canadian in cans and put it on our bill this year. I don't need the stress of sorting out all different brands between aluminum and glass at the border this year. PjShorthorn"

5504530,prov1800,2017-04-27 11:22:00,5010,Not going to effect me in anyway.dont drink.just fish.lol.but for those that do.id say better stock up..
5504546,Obabikon,2017-04-27 11:24:00,2370,"""The union has long railed against the government's move to sell beer, wine and cider in grocery stores, calling it creeping privatization.'"" So... the union is upset that they are slowly moving towards a fair system that doesn't give them all the power? Wow. Potential strikes like this are exactly why an entire industry should never be privatized. If they do strike, the border had better be ready for the influx of alcohol crossing over."
5504746,Thompmd,2017-04-27 12:53:00,320,Without hearing what both sides are asking for it's difficult to know what fair is. If both sides are reasonable then there shouldn't be too many problems. Not many systems function well when either side is judge & jury.
5505162,Obabikon,2017-04-27 15:52:00,2370,"Completely agree... which is why mom and pop type stores are a better system than the LCBO. The Government wants to regulate alcohol. So, they should regulate the price. They can do that without regulating who is allowed to sell it. If the LCBO Union feels they are being mistreated, they can strike at any time, and put the entire province's alcohol sales on hold.... but who are they actually punishing by striking?"
5505466,Lotw1,2017-04-27 18:31:00,36,"If the LCBO Union feels they are being mistreated, they can strike at any time, and put the entire province's alcohol sales on hold.... but who are they actually punishing by striking?Unions don't strike to punish anyone. They strike to put financial, political or public pressure on their employer in hopes of maintaining or achieving a more favorable agreement."
5505786,Guest,2017-04-27 20:29:00,0,Liquor store clerks are union......hahahaha
5505858,Obabikon,2017-04-27 20:50:00,2370,"I guess ""punish"" was the wrong word. I should have stated... ""at who's expense?"" The answer though is the public. The LCBO and unions in general, will not last if public turns on them. Seems like this is the 2nd or 3rd time in the past 4-5 years that a threat of strike has happened. This threat to strike is mostly because of ""creeping privatization"" (from what I've read). Basically the Union doesn't want their monopoly threatened. I hope it backfires on them, and the province opens up to the free market. Just my opinion though."
5505898,martinbns,2017-04-27 21:09:00,1520,"Falcon Lake Manitoba isn't too far away from Kenora, fill up on booze there."
5505906,v-bay gord,2017-04-27 21:12:00,3168,"The province is the one who benefits from a monopoly on sales of alcohol. The union is simply looking out for it's members. This isn't the US of A. We are not totally anti union up here, nor do we need to reduce every wage to the lowest common denominator."
