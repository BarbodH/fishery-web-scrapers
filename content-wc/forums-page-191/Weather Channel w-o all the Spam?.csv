5608737,bigdaddyguns,2017-06-14 04:56:00,608,On my phone i like Radar Express. Desktop www.weather.gov for local area. In Canada I use weather.gc.ca.
5609209,Stein67,2017-06-14 08:11:00,19,"On my phone the Accuweather app instead of the website. One or two small ads, loads fast.Weather Channel has become almost unusable."
5609257,ziemann,2017-06-14 08:19:00,641,"Agreed- The Weather Channel apps and web site have become absolute garbage and almost unusable. Fake news, ads galore, and poorly organized content make it horrible to use. Unfortunately, I like the ""Spark"" section of their app for lightning warnings for when I am out on big water- so I have it installed for just that purpose. Otherwise, from day to day, I am using Weather Underground and Accuweather."
