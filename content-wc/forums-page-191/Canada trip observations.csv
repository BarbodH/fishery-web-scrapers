5606057,pjshorthorn,2017-06-13 06:52:00,5654,Interesting synopsis. A lot of it rings true on trips of mine from the past. Where did you go on this trip? PjShorthorn
5606537,troutwater,2017-06-13 10:17:00,299,Great report thanks for sharing! Leaving for Huber's in 38 days....can't way. Sucks to hear about the black flies though....hate those suckers...
5607033,Bakefish,2017-06-13 12:01:00,1077,"English River, near Ear Falls."
5607961,Further North,2017-06-13 17:38:00,2008,Thanks - That's not far off normal.
5611601,fishmanric,2017-06-15 07:15:00,219,Awesome report. We have experienced lots of wildlife on 502 and have had birds fly into our car the past three years. One year got stopped by a mama mouse and her two young ones. Hate hearing about those black flies as they were bad on Lake Erie this year.
5604497,Bakefish,2017-06-12 11:56:00,1077,"Just returned from my first trip of the year. Here are some of my observations:Crossing the borderWe always cross early going up. Hit the bridge at about 6:15 and buzzed through in short order. The border lady (not too shabby) asked us if we had chicken. We said we did, she inquired as to where we bought it. When we told her Indiana she said that was on the list of banned states, so we had to pitch it in the dumpster. We had researched and had not found Indiana on the list, but who's to argue at that point.Crossing on the way back was a breeze. Maybe a 15-20 minute wait. This was at about 11:30 a.m. The line waiting to cross into Canada stretched out pretty far from what I could see.502It's in a little bit of a rough condition, but I've seen it worse. No problem on the way up, maybe too early in the morning for the construction workers, but a few short delays on the way back. If you see a sign that indicates rough road, heed it. Had to stop for a big bull moose and a bear on the way back. This is why I love 502. Some people avoid the road for this reason alone.Rock Guard vs. TowTectorI bought the TowTec before this trip because I got about a million little dings in my Impact on previous trips. The gravel road we travel was pretty muddy and none of that mud made it to the boat or trailer, so I'm guessing it did a pretty fair job. We passed a vehicle on the gravel that had a carpet attached to the back of his truck and was going less than 10 mph. You've gotta do what you've gotta do.Saw a vehicle going about 70 mph down the highway with a Rock Guard. It was at about a 60 degree angle of where it would offer protection. I like my set up better.Saw a couple guys at camp that had the sail type protectors that cover the front of the boat. Sweet, but I wonder how it protects the trailer. Still, a nice set up. I bet that combined with a TowTecter would give total protection.FishingWhat can I say? Fabulous as always.BugsIt was, by far, the worst I've ever seen it for black flies. There were clouds of them, I mean clouds. I used the coppertone sport and it offered some protection, but those little devils are persistent. They broke through my defenses about 20 times, mostly on my upper arms and elbows. I'll be itching for the next couple of weeks.Deer flies and horse flies were out of control. Got kicked out of one lake we fish because they were driving us out of our minds. We had to find the most wind we could, which is usually where the fish are anyway. Mosquitoes were just starting. No ticks for us.AttendanceCanadian tourism appears to have bounced back. It seems like the old days with ""conga"" lines going down 502 and lines at the border.DrivingThe worst I've ever seen. People, including commercial truck drivers seem to have forgotten that the most important thing they are doing is driving their vehicles. I saw more people engrossed in their smart phones, whether texting or talking and paying little attention to their driving. I blew my horn at at least 4 vehicles that appeared to be crossing the line as I was passing. Observed countless others texting. Pulling a trailer apparently means you are giving other drivers the right to cut you off.In GeneralI've been doing this since the early 70's and I believe I enjoy it now more than ever. I still haven't learned how to slow down, but if I plan on doing this for years to come it's something I'll have to learn. Hopefully I'll be retiring in a couple of years and I won't be sitting in work the following Monday feeling like someone hit me with a sledge hammer. Unfortunately the guy I go with is a year older than me and in much worse shape. Either we find a younger guy that we can get along with (set in our ways) or we hop the bus to Temple Bay on Eagle. We're not ready for that yet though."
5604529,Thompmd,2017-06-12 12:13:00,320,"Thanks for the notes, I enjoy reading.....What's better and whats worse since you began? Fishing, roads, exchange rate, traffic, technology at the resorts etc?I have been going all of my life and to Canada about 15yrs, love it more each year and I wonder if its simply because as I age(53) I have a better appreciation?"
5604609,retire55,2017-06-12 12:58:00,1029,"Interesting. When I checked the net, I found that Canada had banned poultry products from Alabama and Tennessee.https://www.agcanada.com/daily/canad...nessee-alabama"
5604633,team walleye,2017-06-12 13:09:00,336,Sounds like you had a great trip. I will be making my 8th trip up north in a few weeks. I am yet to see a moose or bear along 502. Always love seeing the wildlife. I am 33 years old now and each time I go I think I enjoy it a little bit more.
5604713,Bakefish,2017-06-12 14:04:00,1077,"Fishing is better. It used to be 6 of everything with no max. size limit or slot. Fishing is much better.Roads are pretty much the same, except for the addition of 502 which to me was a game changer. There will always be construction.Exchange rate has been all over the place. Believe it or not there was a period where the Candian dollar was worth more than the American dollar. The Canadians weren't too happy when you paid in green backsTraffic is better, not as many people as there used to be, although this year it appears to have turned around.Technology at the resorts. Ha!!! Technology when I first started going up was electricity."
5604721,Bakefish,2017-06-12 14:05:00,1077,"That's what we thought. It may be correct, but this young lady said Indiana. I wasn't going to argue."
5604873,LOW1,2017-06-12 14:54:00,2828,Just got back from our first LOTW trip. We arrived and left on a Saturday. Both days the line on the IFalls side was backed up to the intersection and then back east to Rainy Lake for several blocks.We had about a 45 minute wait.Going back in two weeks. Wish I was still there. Getting dry in the LOTW area - could use rain.Good news was that there was very little road construction compared with other years.
5604881,Further North,2017-06-12 15:02:00,2008,How high/low was LOTW?
5604945,LOW1,2017-06-12 15:21:00,2828,My guess would be about 6 inches below average
5605169,Sportdog,2017-06-12 16:41:00,6735,Was that cooked or raw chicken you had? Please say raw. Lol!!! I have plans on taking several pre-prepared frozen chicken menu item.
