5293442,1-shot,2017-01-26 10:18:00,35,"Very excited; our group of 6 reserved our annual trip. This time heading out to Little Missinabie with Air Dale in early June. Finally convinced a couple in the group to do a fly-in. Have only done drive-in, boat-in, and train-in with the bigger group of us due to the fear that some have of flying. Usually do a smaller group later in the year without the chickens. I was wondering if anyone whose been there has any information or tips they would be willing to share about Little Missinabie. I have done a few searches and everything I have heard sounds like its a great lake. I really enjoyed Mike Borger's summary where he stayed in a cabin on a small adjacent lake and hiked over to Little Miss everyday. We are interested in walleye and pike with more of an emphasis placed on jigging for walleye. Feel free to PM me if that's better.Thanks in advance.1-shot"
5293522,Mike Borger,2017-01-26 11:15:00,1554,"Just a beautiful island outpost, honestly it's like a postcard. You guys will love it!Assuming you can navigate up the creek with no problems (I could when I was there), Elbow Lake was pretty awesome. Also Trump Lake right next to it for lakers.Just south of the Air Dale camp there is a very obvious pinch point where there is a bit of current and LOTS of walleyes!Also you have to try fishing the pool below the rapids at the outflow at the north end. Park your boat, walk 100 feet over on a wide trail and cast from shore. Always lots of eater walleye and just a gorgeous spot!"
5296338,pike50plus,2017-01-27 19:02:00,584,Very nice lake and scenery is fantastic. PM if you want map and also you can call once Pm received. Greta walleye fishery and at least 2 portage lakes for pike and lakers
5302034,Guest,2017-01-30 19:06:00,0,"We fished Lil Miss back in 2014. We stayed at Cam Lake and walked the trail to Lil Miss each day. We were there the second week of June and had great weather. We had a lot of luck up the river in front of the creek into Elbow Lake for Walleye. We also made our way to the bottom of the falls and slammed the walleye casting with a J11 jointed rapala silver and black color. Most in this area are small but fun to catch never the less. My biggest walleye (26"") and Pike (42"" / 25lbs) came from Elbow Lake. You can view the picture of it on Air Dale's website under the Cam Lake link. Another hot spot was the large bay on the far east end of the lake, trolled worm harness and picked up 21"" to 22"" Walleye each pass. Get a map and look for in flowing creeks, you'll find fish there. We didn't get a chance to fish the West side of the lake but we would like to make a return trip someday and give that section some attention. Beautiful Lake and Indian Pictographs were cool to see. One thing to note, all the areas we fished were extremely shallow...4' to 8'. We saw a moose in Elbow Lake and a lot of Bald Eagles flying around. The drive from Ohio was about 11hrs to Wawa. Highway the whole way. Good numbers and a chance to catch a big pike exists. I don't think this fishery holds many ""trophy"" sized walleye but I would imagine some exist in these waters. The biggest walleye for the week came out of Cam Lake which must've been the only walleye left the Pike couldn't eat. It was 27"" and 7lbs. It was the only walleye we caught on Cam Lake all week. If you want fast action for hammer handle pike, you could literally catch 100 pike per man each day on Cam."

5607593,1-shot,2017-06-13 14:24:00,35,"Returned Sunday night from our annual June fishing trip, this time on Little Missinabie Lake. Special thanks to Mike Borger and Pike50plus who was kind enough to mail me a detailed map of the lake. Arrived on Wednesday morning via Watson's air service and stayed at Air Dale's camp. The accommodations were excellent (clean, well equipped, beautiftul). Fishing was excellent for our entire stay. Caught countless walleye all day every day at almost every spot we tried on the main lake. Our group of six probably ended up somewhere around 700-800 fish caught over 4 days of fishing. Mostly walleye around 15-16 inches but many bigger ones mixed in as well. We really didn't target the ""toothy critters"" this trip but did manage to inadvertently catch a few of those as well. Largest walleye was 27 1/2"" largest pike was 37"". Four of us were able to navigate down the creek to elbow pretty easily. Didn't catch many fish in our 4 hours dedicated to Elbow but the ones we did catch were all substantial. THe biggest pike and the biggest walleye actually came out of elbow. Bugs were pretty bad this year but manageable when the wind was blowing. Made it down to the falls for 1 afternoon and caught a bunch of eater size walleye but nothing very big. Didn't end up making it to Trump, maybe another time. Overall, the consensus from our group was that this was one of our favorite trips and best lakes. We usually don't go to the same lake twice because we like a change of scenery and a new adventure but Little Miss might change that. Can't wait til next time. Cheers: 1-shot"
5608345,Mike Borger,2017-06-13 20:45:00,1554,Right on! Glad to hear it went so well! It really is a beautiful lake.
