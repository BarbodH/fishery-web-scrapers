Some thunderstorms. Air temps in the high 20's at night and high 40's daytime. On a night time trip outside I thought I saw snow flurries. Used lots of firewood No green grass or reeds in the bays. Caught many eyes in the usual places but found a few new areas. Most eyes on the small size but a 23"" and 27"" within 3 casts of each other. Largest pike was a 39"" with several over 30"". Did not ""prioritize"" pike. Met new owners of Melchett and Kayden. Nice young couple with lots of ideas for improvements to the camps. Booked for next year."

Hoping to see some improvements at the camp but we will take Mellchet any way we can get it. Thanks Halfmoon
5606297,flipdip,2017-06-13 08:36:00,27,Glad to hear you had a nice trip. We just booked Melchett for next August. Thought we'd give the new owners a chance but did like what we saw for Brace Lake. I would like to try them sometime. Really hope they clean up around the cabin. What improvements do they have in mind?Where were the new spots you discovered?
