1318894,Guest,2011-06-16 06:45:00,0,Has anyone had any experience at Basket Lake near Dryden? We are looking at a newbie trip and really don't know what to expect. Thanks for any help you can offer.

We ussually fish Kakukus, Barrel, Heathwalt, and a few others. I think some in my group have fished Basket, but I couldn't tell you anything about it. Isn't Basket closer to Ignace?"
