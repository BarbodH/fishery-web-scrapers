1317868,Guest,2011-06-13 15:12:00,0,http://www.splitrocklodge.net/ Split Rock Lodge on LOTW is the best place to be if you want seclusion. It's 9 mile boat ride to island lodge and the owners are top notch folks. If you are looking to go to a smaller lake I would agree with others and consider staying at Rocky Shore Lodge on Perrault Lake. Must say from my Experience LOTW has been the best fishing.
1318213,GWC,2011-06-14 11:04:00,1021,We've been going to Poplar Point Resort for about 4 years. Great place to stay on Gull Rock Lake. The fishing is good & the equipment is good. The package pricing is reasonable. It's about 250 miles above International Falls. Roads are good http://poplarpoint.com/
1318217,scmelik,2011-06-14 11:08:00,154,thanks a ton everyone I really appreciate all the suggestions I am looking forward to sitting down and looking at each one of the places and any others that you all suggest so we can make a decision on where to go.
1318548,reconssd,2011-06-15 09:37:00,147,"I would highly recommend Ghost River Lodge too. Great fishing, nice boats, numerous lakes to fish, and great people."
1318587,Bitinlight,2011-06-15 11:11:00,95,Go to www.lacseuloutposts.com Boat In on Lac Seul. This is a great operation. Don't be afraid of the big water. Even if it is windy you can always find places close to the camp to fish and you will catch all the walleyes you want.
1318618,Jiggy06,2011-06-15 12:40:00,7,"I would suggest an outpost of the lodge we go to. You get yourself to Winnipeg and they handle the rest! The outpost is called Hidden Lake, which is an outpost of Cobham River Lodge. Here is their website.www.cobham-river-lodge.comIf you have any questions PM me. I have been taking my group there every year for the last 10 years."
1318760,ILScott,2011-06-15 19:03:00,139,I have been going to Wine Lake which is a 26 mile boat in camp. Great lund boats and nice cabins. Only resort on the lake and the lake is only 9 miles long. You also can fish many other little lakes. Take a look at www.winelakecamp.com
1318792,scmelik,2011-06-15 20:12:00,154,"wow guys thank you all a ton, we really do appreciate all of the suggestions. I knew there were a lot of great little outfits up there but I would have never been able to find some of these places with ya'lls help."
1317453,scmelik,2011-06-12 15:19:00,154,"Guys I am hoping to get some advice from those that have been there. My buddy and I are talking about taking a trip up to Canada next summer for a week. He promised his oldest boy that when he turned ten he would take him and his brother up and he asked if my dad and I would like to go as well. We have talked about it quite a bit and would like to find something semi remote, not a fly in trip or anything but on a smaller lake. Hopefully some place where they supply the boat and the lodge/cabin and we do the rest. Does anyone have any suggestions?"
1317455,Skyraptor,2011-06-12 15:31:00,291,Take a look at Ghost River Lodge. It is not a drive-in nor is it a fly0in lodge. They boat you in and have a great number of lakes to go to depending on your fishing style. They have housekeeping as well as an American plan for their guests. Also they do have a father/son package deal.http://www.ghostriverlodges.com/
1317463,Pezman38,2011-06-12 15:50:00,3196,"Wrights Wilderness Camp on gull rock.http://www.wrightswildernesscamp.com/ Very secluded spot on a river that you can fish a large lake, or a small lake depending on you. They have great camp boats and will ensure you catch some fish. I have been going for the last 7 years."
1317469,toolman1502,2011-06-12 16:24:00,13,"We stay at Rocky Shore Lodge.Mike and Chris are super people,clean cabins, nice boats, great fishing. Take a look, here is there web sitehttp://rockyshorelodge.com/ Toolman"
1317470,retire55,2011-06-12 16:24:00,1029,It would be easier to respond to your inquiry if we knew the general area (which province) you have in mind and what your maximum driving time is from your location (?).
1317479,scmelik,2011-06-12 16:48:00,154,"province really isn't important, would like to keep it to a 10 or 12 hour drive from South Dakota, but we will go farther if we need too."
1317483,zman8701,2011-06-12 17:13:00,100,"Seeing as you have time to choose your destination, try( Go Fish Ontario ) Half the fun is planning you trip. Good luck."
1317496,scmelik,2011-06-12 17:37:00,154,thank you
1317504,go dart,2011-06-12 17:56:00,77,This is all you need to know. Especially if you've never been. Ask Mike about his drive out lakes then go one day. Its a 100 fish day.
1317572,wmd,2011-06-12 20:37:00,388,"I am from SD as well. Ghost River is an excellent lodge with very good service, have been there 5 times. They offer what it appears you are looking for and is about 12 hours from most anywhere east river in SD. PM me if you have specific questions. wmd"
