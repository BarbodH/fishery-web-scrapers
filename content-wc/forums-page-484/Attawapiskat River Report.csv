1315803,Mike Borger,2011-06-08 05:28:00,1554,"My group of 6 flew into the Attawapiskat river north of Nakina May 20-28 recently.The first couple of days we caught the tail end of an extended warm front and the fish were hitting pretty much anything with reckless abandon.Sunday the weather did a complete reversal and we had minus temps and snow followed by more cold weather and extreme high pressure.Water temps to start were 56-58 with a high of 61 in some of the backbays late afternoon.After experiencing fish that were on the prod the first couple of days, Monday morning we had to adapt and adapt we did.Water temps dropped down to 42, reaching 46-48 later in the day.To say this put the fish down a bit is an understatement. Still we did okay. My buddy had great success with his fly rod and it's dead slow neutrally bouyant presentation.I finally rigged a white 8"" reaper on a very lightly weighted swimbait hook, also adding a small silicone skirt at the head pushing it up over the snap of my fluorocarbon leader.We were fishing these baits DEAD slow in 3-4' of water. Short jerks, then loooong pauses in between. Either my friends fly or my reaper would hang motionless right in front of the fish and provoke many strikes.It was really pretty cool how they'd hit. Always on the pause. Suddenly you're line would start slicing through the water either to the left or right as a big pike grabbed the bait and ran. Sometimes they'd rush right at the boat forcing us to reel madly then set the hook hard right at boatside. This would result in what we'd call the ""toilet flush"" as these big brutes wallowed and rolled moving a ton of water then taking off on scorching runs that left us breathless.Pretty amazing stuff. Walleye fishing when we bothered with them was great. Good numbers and a couple of fish in the 27-28"" range.So all in all despite the severe cold front we persevered. Tally for the week was 37 pike between 40-451/2"" with two over 45.My buddy Dave caught the heaviest fish on the fly rod, an incredibly girthy 441/2"" specimen that easily pushed 27lb's.Can't wait to go back!Here's just a few teaser pic's:http://img.photobucket.com/albums/10...May2011024.jpghttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/10...May2011036.jpghttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/10...May2011042.jpghttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/10...May2011067.jpghttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/10...May2011073.jpghttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/10...May2011083.jpghttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/10...May2011089.jpghttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/10...May2011097.jpghttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/10...May2011111.jpghttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/10...May2011112.jpg"

1315879,deputy dog,2011-06-08 08:34:00,305,my group is headin up with edddie to beteau for the first time aug 20-27 so keep the reports comin! we are used to goin north early july and usually have success in pad and weed beds in 6-10' of water. do u think that pattern will produce in late august or will the bigger fish move to deeper water with the rising water temps? thanks.....
1315881,deputy dog,2011-06-08 08:39:00,305,"by the way, awesome pics"
1315929,gapwedge,2011-06-08 09:58:00,19,"Thanks for the post and pics. Glad your maiden adventure for 2011 went well despite the weather twist. I look forward to hearing about your future exploits, which provides a vicarious thrill. I get a big kick out of your expression on virtually every photo ... that heavenly intoxicated smirk. Keep 'em coming."
1315935,Mike Borger,2011-06-08 10:07:00,1554,"Being a river system and so far north the water never really gets too warm. Yes, you'll get most of your fish adjacent to pad beds and deep cabbage, especially bay mouths that are adjacent to the deeper main river channel! Many spots you'll find will look great but be devoid of fish. These are invariably areas that are too far from the main channel. Eliminate all that water, concentrate on the water adjacent to the main river and that'll be half the battle. If you have warm sunny weather you will definitely find very early mornings are best when the water in the back bays is at it's coolest. Evening can and usually is good too. During the heat of the day I'd concentrate on trolling the main river channel. The deep current areas that are next to the feeding flats. Many of these deep channels are 20-30' feet. The really big pike will hunker down in there when the temps rise and the sun gets high. There's no doubt in my mind you'll have a good trip, there's really no ""bad"" time to fish that camp. If you have anymore questions ask away I'm glad to help. Cheers, Mike"
1315936,Mike Borger,2011-06-08 10:08:00,1554,Thanks man.
