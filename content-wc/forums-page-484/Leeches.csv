The gentleman behind the bait counter told me that you could take leeches across the border into Canada. Has this changed and I missed the memo??? I know you can take worms in artifical bedding but I thought leeches were taboo. Any help would be apreciated.
1317631,retire55,2011-06-13 06:25:00,1029,The law has not changed. You can not legally bring leeches into Ontario. Here's an excerpt from Ontario's Fishing Regulations: Import of Bait It is illegal to bring any crayfish or salamanders or live fish or leeches into Ontario for use as bait.
