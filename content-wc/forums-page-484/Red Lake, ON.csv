Tried shallow weeds, trolling cranks, Lindy rigs, jigging, slip bobbers, Mr. Twisters. Rock bars, points, channels,. Probably only got 30 eyes the whole week. Largest was 18"" and most were under 13"".Fished 2 ft to 25 feet. Pretty bad if you ask me. What should we have done different? I managed to get a fat 40"" pike, 36"", and 34"". The big pikes were in the weeds about 1-2 feet. No small snake pikes."
1317924,pan-man,2011-06-13 17:44:00,299,I had same problem 2 years ago. The only two places I found that were hitting were entrance to Keg lake and the river sanctuary (opened they day we arrived).The only redeeming part about cold water temps were the lake trout were up on 20-25 foot humps and I was able to boat 4 (all released) that were 10-15lbs.

I think that's what makes it interesting. With the weather we have had it has been challenging. Better luck next year!"

Water temp was the same, low 50's. Everyone who has fished Red Lake and Gullrock know that both area are about the same and the fishing is normally way better than what we had. Unfortunately we cannot control mother nature and the numerous fronts that went through. I talked to a game warden who stated Lac Suel and Eagle also had reports coming in as the worst fishing in years. With all that said, Gullrock will see me the same time next year."
1318434,dman617,2011-06-14 20:23:00,117,"The bad fishing seems to be the norm this year. I have spoke with a few others that just got back from the Ignace area and the same slow, small size, and low numbers. Biggest question remains, how is one supposed to catch fish this year with a cold, late spring? Maybe if I can figure that out, I'll be on the PWT soon!!I'll be there again next year. It's been 9 years in a row now. Can't break the streak because of a bad year. D"
