Most fish caught in 6-12 feet of water in July. Coming out of the channel from Meta to Ara if you go on a straight line to the opposite shore line there's a noticeable point. Fish the stucture around the point and the shoreline (8-10 feet of water) in either direction for a half mile or so. Don't fish for pike but catch quite a few fishing for Walleye. There's also another great spot as soon as you come out of the channel & pass Ara Lake Camp. A small island on you left---within 400-500 yards of Ara Camp. Good structure all around island. Also do well trolling Hot n Tots.
