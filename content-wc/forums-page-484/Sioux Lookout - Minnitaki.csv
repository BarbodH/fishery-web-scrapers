1318001,Walleye_Wrangler,2011-06-13 20:41:00,138,Doing great! Only problem is finding fish small enough to keep. Caught about 2 dozen slot or over on Saturday at the chutes. Sunday fished Mineshaft. Not many walleye but killed the pike and smallies. Today we went up Pelican and hit the chutes again. Really had fun catching walleyes on Repalas. Almost all were slot or bigger again.
1318005,somnendo,2011-06-13 20:48:00,30,I'll be headed up on the 18th as well! Staying at Abram Lake Park. I can't wait to get out on the water!
1318011,Guest,2011-06-13 20:54:00,0,"Our group just finished a series of three 2 day sessions on Lac Seul out of Sioux Lookout over the last 2 weeks with trips on other lakes in between. The weather was quite variable with every day bringing some type of good or bad weather surprise. We found the fishing as good or better than most years with several Masters and roughly 125-135 walleye and pike per day for 4 guests plus guide. Not all spots worked all the time but most days there were several spots that yielded good numbers. I even experienced my first quintuple header when 5 of us in the boat were all hooked up with walleye at the same time. In many locations, the key was to find the spot on the spot, as moving 10 feet made the difference between catching a lot of fish and few fish. Looking forward to more good days on Lac Seul this summer."

I've even had a 46"" musky caught by a guest on a jig/minnow while targeting walleyes. Top fish have been a 28"" walleye, 19.5 "" Smallie and a 42"" pike. Crazy numbers and action as well. Overall the weather has been very cooperative, with only one nasty cold front day that we spent slamming the lakers on Big Vermilion. Most days have been on the entire east side of Lac Seul. All of my guests have been very happy, and will be returning. Have a great trip to the Sioux Lookout area!"
1318576,bad fisherman,2011-06-15 10:54:00,13,Leaving for Donnellys on Friday and was wondering how's the weather and if there are any fish left in the lake?
1318876,Master Cookie,2011-06-16 05:47:00,1,"I was on the water from June 4th th June 12th. Water level was above normal and the teperature was colder. Started to see evidence of the Mayfly hatch.The fishing was great however, the walleyes were biting light."
