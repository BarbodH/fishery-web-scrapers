Any tips, suggestions about what we need to optimize our trip at that time will be greatly appreciated. Thanks, JackSalmon"

First, look at the water clarity to make a choice on color. If it's clear, try natural patterns. If it's windy and or the visibility is low, black and more vibrant colors should take the cake. Also baits that displace water, like spinner baits.In 20-30ft of water, start on the top of the rock pile, cast retrieving with an aggeressive bait to judge how aggressive the fish are. try on both sides of the pile as well to locate the hot bite. If it's windy, the bass will be on the edges, pike will be on the top of the rockpile. Walleye will be on the windswept side more than likely.If you can't get bit on a spinner bait, try crank baits next. If no bites still, switch to more finess techniques. Jigs with live bait (minnows, leeches, crawlers) Plastic will work also. Berkley ripple shads (chart. 3"") work well. Gulp alive minnows, green yellow, black white work well, again, the smaller versions work best.If you really want to get bit though, troll shorelines and cast to the shore, retrieve back to the boat. You'll get tons of action that way.Other good baits to have are the Rapala DT series baits, X-raps, Terminator spinner baits, Booyah swim jigs with Berkley Chigger craw trailers with about .5"" cut off, grubs, worms, leeches, tons of jigs, husky jerks etc.Hope this helps abit, lol"
