1318656,ManitouBass,2011-06-15 14:21:00,201,"They work pretty good in northwestern ontario lakes/rivers. Pike and bass also love to eat them.I prefer the 3"" as apposed to the 4"" versions.I use them on jigs, usually 1/4 oz or 3/8 oz. I like both the minnow and the perch versions.I usually use them when the bite is tough, then the paddletail seems to produce bites when other baits aren't working.a jig retrieve is how I fish them, try different speeds etc"
