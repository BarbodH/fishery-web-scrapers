1318933,Danny61,2011-06-16 07:50:00,42,From the emails I got from Paradise Cove seems the fish are in Little Sand pretty good right now.
1318956,Caleb,2011-06-16 08:42:00,36,Thanks for the info. Did they say if the water levels were high or low?
1319028,Aaron-IN,2011-06-16 11:55:00,500,Water levels are only 12-18 inches above what I would consider normal for up there.
