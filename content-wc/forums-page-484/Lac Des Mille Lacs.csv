1318599,JDP,2011-06-15 11:54:00,1457,"Hump is looking for information regarding ""Lac Des Mille Lacs"" which is about 90 miles west of Thunder Bay, Ontario not Mille Lacs in Minnesota."
1318818,Hawkfan,2011-06-15 21:19:00,237,Shows what I know. Thats what you get when you put blinders on at the border for the same camp every year. I've flown out of Sioux Lookout to he same lake the last 10 years.
1318826,JDP,2011-06-15 21:34:00,1457,An honest mistake!
