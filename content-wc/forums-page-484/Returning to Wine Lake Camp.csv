Last year was our first year there and we were very pleased with the fishing, accommodations and the hospitality provided by Herb, Ann and their staff. We will be bringing four first timers to WLC, and for two of them it is there first trip north. We have been reading the weekly fishing reports on their blog at http://winelakecamp.blogspot.com/ and so far it seems as though the fishing is going well. I was wondering if anyone here has been to WLC already this year and what your experiences have been. We were also curious if the portage from Wabaskang was like last year where Herb just jumped the boats one at a time over the falls or if the boats had to be unpacked and carried."

Walleye were all over the place and we caught dozens over 20"" and stuffed ourselves on walleye every night. The north end of Wine and Beaver were the best places. One group hit some big ones in Dynamite near the eagle's nest the last day or two. I'm sure you know those hot spots. We caught one walleye in Mud and one in Turnaround so we did not spend much time there. Of course it was too early for anything to happen in Ghost. The trout were still up when we were there since water temps were under 60 and we had a blast trout hunting. They probably are down now. matt, the helper for Herb and Ann is getting into fishing and will have some hot spots for you. Pike were a little scarce as only one for our party over the slot at 39"" However, we don't hunt them like we used to since we are so busy with walleye and trout. One person in camp caught three big pike within a few hours with a crawler tipped little joe. We just throw or troll raps for them or catch them on jig and minnow when we are walleye fishing. The falls, as usual, were active and the only place we could catch smallies. one day the walleyes were all over the place there. On the blog, I am the one Ann referred to as saying, ""Wine a little bit, it will make you feel better."" respond if you want any more info."

You mention the falls, are you referring to the falls north of camp, near the portage to Halvorsen/Anishinabi or due east of camp heading towords Sherin Lake/Cedar river? Have never caught smallies and am wanting to give that a go."
