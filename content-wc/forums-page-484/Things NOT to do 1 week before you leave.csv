1314497,guide7,2011-06-04 08:20:00,70,"We now have a standing deal that the last one to be picked up calls Big brother Dave and makes sure he is on the way to meet our travel schedule. Calling him 5 minutes after expected arrival, only to wake him up at his house, which is a 40 minute drive makes a lot of antsy travelers real restless. A great way to start a whole new batch of nicknames for Big brother. 2 sayings we use: ""Adapt and overcome"" (From my nephew who learned this technique with 4 yrs army) ""Be prepared"" (from my brother who brings waaaaaay too much stuff.)"
1314737,greenie,2011-06-05 12:13:00,87,"I use a list, working from the list I used the year before. Sometimes looking at the list you can eliminate items not needed from the year before. I start this about 3-4 weeks before the trip. Really helps!!! As the last week comes, I condense down to last minute things and make notes. Like... ""Meat in freezer"" Little things like helps ease the mind and helps keep you thinking about all those WALLEYES your going to catch!! )"
1314992,Lovetofish,2011-06-06 09:41:00,458,Don't hit a deer with your tow vehicle before you go. My wife did this once. Thankfully it was more then a week before our trip. But every trip since I've kept the tow vehicle pretty close to the garage before we go.
1319397,labsrus,2011-06-17 10:32:00,557,"We have a comprehensive list that everyone uses Even thought we are a month away, stuff is starting to stack up on the table in the garage. We have forgotten our share of things but there are stores along the way. Food and Beverages are first to get packed. Sunglasses First Aid Kit Chap stick and sunscreen Bug spray Extra tackle Rods and reels will never be left behind. Beverage coozies are packed in tackle box"
1319409,wallydave,2011-06-17 10:55:00,2151,"The day before my first trip to Lac Seul, I sprained my ankle at work! Since the group had left the day before, I drove up by myself, with a case of 1.5 liter water on the floor of my minivan to prop up my foot while I drove, thank God for cruise control! I got pretty good at braking with my left foot! Walking to and from the boat and trying to stand up in the vee made for an interesting week, and my ankle turned all sorts of pretty colors! For this years trip my boat and cabin buddy, a newbie to Canada, made out a list of groceries and supplies. We will review the list and update it for the next trip! Is it too soon to start the countdown!?"
1319421,Lovetofish,2011-06-17 11:18:00,458,"One year while doing some packing the weekend before the trip I backed into small kid recliner in my basement. There was an upholstery staple sticking out and it sliced my calf 4"" and deep. It was like someone cut me with a fillet knife. Off to the hospital we go about 11 at night. The ER Doc told me to stay off my leg as much as possible for a couple days. Yeah, right. I was back at packing and working around the house the next day. But because I favored my other leg my hip went out of place. Good grief. I have a 4"" ugly scar to remind me of this for the rest of my life."
1314323,keek,2011-06-03 14:48:00,1003,While only having one canada trip under my belt it was definitely an eye opener. I learned a TON here on WC and had an incredible trip that has entered my thoughts almost daily. I wanted to add a new topic on the things you SHOULDN'T do before you leave. Maybe it would save someone some heartache. I'll start with a few I learned: Don't tinker with your boat's electrical system less than a week before you go. You might not get the bugs worked out in time. Don't tinker with your outboard (I was messing with my power trim and should have left it alone!) Don't wait until the day before you leave to pack. You'll take way to much. Don't forget the food in the freezer you planned on taking. Don't forget to spend some quality time with your spouse/partner before you go. Don't forget... it's supposed to be FUN!
1314336,jdoaks,2011-06-03 15:28:00,89,ive been slowly packin for a month but always forget something and take to much. ive ran the boat a couple of time at local lake good thing throttle cable broke all fixed and running good.deceles here we come.im going to do some fish up on one of the islands around rapid 13 tues. or wendsday stop by and say hi I have blue and white sylvan another boat with us has brown and white trihaul. its me and my wife and two cousons good luck to all

1314407,rather-be-fishin,2011-06-03 20:32:00,429,"Keek ~ Good tips! Yep, we left food in the freezer our first trip too......but still had plenty to eat! 8 weeks to go and the count down is on - going back to Lac Seul! RBF"
1314415,cody123,2011-06-03 20:55:00,16,Dont forget to tell the Boss your going on vacation--Ive got a good boss. He had to fill my time cards out for me.
1314420,davenathe,2011-06-03 21:06:00,113,"yeah, have forgotten the freezer items a number of times."
1314428,keek,2011-06-03 21:31:00,1003,Good one! I reminded mine today.
1314448,SinOrSwim,2011-06-03 23:52:00,1528,"LOL All good points and my guess is most anybody who has gone up has made at least some of these mistakes.I have made a very very detailed check list for this very purpose. I have each item listed that I take and then columns to the right that have sections to check things off. There is a check box for have, need, packed etc. I start gathering things a week or two in advance and place in one area. Then, the night before I pack everything and will check off the packed column as it goes in a suitcase or a tote. All the way down to money, checkbook, passport, sunglasses etc and I am literally looking at that thing when I get in the truck.NOW, this does NOT eliminate the issue of forgetting to pack something back up on the way up. LOL We usually do our trip over a couple days. We stay at my brothers for a night on the way up. I forgot my pillow. So, easy fix. I stopped on the way up and bought one. We stay in town at Sioux Lookout the night before we fly. I forgot it AGAIN and had to use rolled up sweatshirts etc as a pillow. I have not forgotten a pillow since!!!"
