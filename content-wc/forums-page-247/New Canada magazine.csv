4406633,Mike Borger,2015-12-28 14:18:00,1554,"Glad you were able to figure out the process and enjoyed it, thank you!"
4408001,MrSimon,2015-12-29 07:43:00,922,"I'm going to print out the magazine on nice glossy paper, staple it together, and sell them for $10 a piece I'll even give Mike a 10% cut, cause fair is fair, right?"
4408921,pike50plus,2015-12-29 12:59:00,584,"Make sure Mike doesn't give the job to Clamenza, but he will get reliable people who won't get carried away!"
4414025,Eric.hallagan,2015-12-31 13:38:00,32,That's funny stuff right there- I can't wait for the next one
4368569,Shellback,2015-12-09 18:56:00,8083,"Just purchased it, but kinda left in the dark how this digital issue is supposed to work. Is it downloaded to my computer, or do I have to go the the magazine site and ""my account"" each time I want to view it. Another problem I'm having is going from page to page I have to rezoom for each page. Not a big fan of this digital stuff. Thought it would be more like when I download a Kindle book. I really expected to be able to download in to my computer and read at my leisure."
4368641,Mike Borger,2015-12-09 19:23:00,1554,"You can't download it to your computer. You are correct you need to have an internet connection and log on. For what it's worth this particular platform is the best in the world imo. I do thank you for the effort and the support! In general I'm with you on this. Digital will be a part of the equation because in this day and age it has to be, but the goal is print."
4368657,Shellback,2015-12-09 19:30:00,8083,That's disappointing. I guess I should have investigated Magzter before hand.
4401193,polaris-pete,2015-12-25 11:43:00,343,"Come on please lets be serious. This new endeavor by Mike costs a measily $4.99 for his First try at starting a new Magazine for all interested in fishing Canada to enjoy. If you aren't in the Digital age then you are going to be left behind. If you have a computer, its not a big deal to view his Magazine. I will say he did an Outstanding job at his first attempt."
4401993,Shellback,2015-12-26 05:30:00,8083,"I'll be 68 in a few days, and found it difficult to follow with the format they used. Plus the fact it can only be viewed while online. I was expecting something more like when I download a book on to my Kindle. Not sure why it can't be downloaded to view at your leisure, are all digital magazines like that? Just my personal opinion, but I think when one is starting a new enterprise, people's feedback, both good and bad is important for success."
4402033,Mike Borger,2015-12-26 06:08:00,1554,"Thanks Pete, appreciate the support!

Like everything in life this has been a huge learning process for me. I do appreciate the negative feedback, it's going to help me improve!Cheers"
4402441,yoopertrout,2015-12-26 10:40:00,1172,"I'm too old to have grown up with computers, and glitches give me a headache. It's worth remembering, though, that glitches that are minor headaches to the rest of us are probably a big pain in the neck and disappointment for Mike. I bet it will all get worked out with a little time."
4402601,Golden Eagle,2015-12-26 12:51:00,2642,"Fellow geezers, let's not allow ourselves to become identified by our age. If there's a challenge out there, lets conquer it and open doors to new opportunities."
4402777,That Minnesota guy,2015-12-26 15:48:00,8293,"I agree, send it to me on paper Mike I know how to read AND turn pages!!!"
4406449,turkeyriver,2015-12-28 12:45:00,80,"Blizzard here in Iowa today so purchased and read the magazine. First, Magzter. I'm also an old guy, but I know how to buy stuff online! The register,activate, and log-in took a few tries but finally worked. It must have told me 5 times to activate, and then told me I was already activated! After that it was clear sailing. Very enjoyable Mike. Personal adventure stories are what I loved about outdoor magazines when I was a kid 50 yrs. ago. That is what's missing in most mags today. Story about the first fly-in reminded me a bit of my own experience. When the pilot tells you it's the toughest day of flying he's ever had, and you're getting to camp at 5:30 instead of 10:30, you know you have a memory to hang on to! Anyway, worth the $4.99!"

4364881,kzoofisher,2015-12-08 04:02:00,5144,"No problems with the purchase for me. I like the digital format more than paper and think the price is reasonable considering the expense for research on the articles. These aren't movie reviews that the writers can knock out at three per week. As for marketing, what does it cost to have an ad pop up on youtube videos? There are plenty of videos on 'eyes, smallies, pike and lakers if you can limit the ad to those vids."
4364993,pjshorthorn,2015-12-08 06:26:00,5654,"KAzoo has a very valid suggestion. In the past I worked closely with our marketing director on developing and sending press releases out to Wall St. on new technologies we developed in what was a brand new company.In conjunction with the press releases ,we used Google to help get our company name and product in front of potential customers. The premise is pretty simple. We would pay X dollars a month to Google and the higher the amount paid, our company would come up higher on the hit list when a person made a search. We found that there was a dollar amount threshold in order for our name to consistently show up at the upper end of the list instead of on page 4 of the list. Another approach would be to advertise on multiple fishing websites with a banner ad. What is the opportunity to have a banner ad on the lodge websites that you support today? Of course that would mean the lodge website would have to be changed,but maybe some would be willing to do so. How about have flyer that would be available at the lodges that customers could pick up when they check into the camp or at the airbase. Just typing outloud. .....the good news is that there is a captive audience here on WC that will have a looooonnnnngggg winter ahead of us........which means a lot of time to come up with more ideas. PjShorthorn."
4365161,adempsey,2015-12-08 07:58:00,963,"I thought part of the job of the publisher was to help you market? One suggestion would be to have a limited print run. Even if it's a only a partial edition of the mag. Send these to some target outfitters across Canada and hopefully they end up in waiting rooms, lounge areas and maybe even the crapper (lol, sorry, but it's a good spot!). Why try to find your target audience when they basically all funnel to these places anyway?Free swag goes a long way too. Vistaprint always seemed to be reasonably priced to me, but it's not really my area. I've only used them for free [gag] business cards. I am sure there are cheaper places for things like shirts, caps and bags online though. Sticker on your car. I've gone to several websites driving past a truck or car with a web address on it. A wrap would be cool too.I'd even consider trying to get something listed on Amazon as a seller. It's not as difficult as it sounds. Not your magazine, but something fishing related, even if it's a mug or something. Just to use as an advertising vehicle."

Going forward they will be involved in marketing and have some great ideas as well.We had discussed a limited print run for the premier issue, but for a bunch of reasons it doesn't make sense, at least yet.As far as swag goes, we're already in the process of creating hats and t shirts."

4363609,123chadder,2015-12-07 13:44:00,429,and the more people that friend you the better the advertising you might be pleasantly surprised
4363681,DeBo,2015-12-07 14:14:00,211,I enjoyed the first issue very much. Magzter was a piece of cake to deal with and purchase the issue. Great photographs and the articles read well. Felt a lot like your online reports but cleaned/shortened up a bit. An FB page for the mag would be a great idea for teasers/updates. Also for letting us know when the next one releases. My only other business comment would be where else are you advertising this mag? I don't think I would know about it without being an active reader of this forum and OFC. I would certainly try to market this to Europeans who like to travel. MooseBunk's latest report involved a European. A Swedish Youtube Channel has some of the best fishing vids on the net. Looking forward to the next issue! How long are we all waiting?
4363721,Mike Borger,2015-12-07 14:20:00,1554,"Thanks for the great feedback, and you pose a very good question! Not being a marketing genius I need to figure out how to spread the word. I'm all ears if anyone has an idea!"
4364697,HeHooksHimself,2015-12-07 20:45:00,725,"Mike, I just wanted to let you know I was finally able to complete the transaction. I used a different card and that seemed to work. i don't know why it didnt like the other one but the deal is done. i really enjoyed the articles and it has a really good balance with the variety writers and their topics. This will get me through the winter! I noticed it is semiannually, I hope you can make it quarterly in the future. Hooks"
4364713,Mike Borger,2015-12-07 20:49:00,1554,"Thank goodness, appreciate you letting me know! Glad you enjoyed it as well. I've said this a couple time already but it's going to get a whole lot better going forward.Everything is baby steps right now, but quarterly is the next step. I wanted to jump right in and do it quarterly but my wife said no. Unlike me she's worried about losing the house."

4363145,Mike Borger,2015-12-07 10:15:00,1554,"Thank you. I like it too, but I know it's going to get a lot better. This was just a start."

4363425,Mike Borger,2015-12-07 12:42:00,1554,"Print is the goal going forward. As an aside I just got an update from Magzter this morning (my digital platform) on how many people have bought the premier issue so far and I'm a little nervous. To date it's been a far from overwhelming number. Ad sales will be the key, but having no readership will make ad sales difficult.A couple of people (not here on WC) have commented on the price of the magazine. I don't mind saying this publicly at all. To date $52,000 has been invested in this project without a cent being recouped. I'm not going to be making a dime off the sale of this premier issue.I'm forging ahead as I have a huge amount of hope for the future. But just so everyone knows this is not a money making scheme, it's a labor of love.I thank everyone who has supported me from the bottom of my heart."

4363449,Mike Borger,2015-12-07 12:54:00,1554,"Really Gord? It should be activated right away, there is no wait!!Pat messaged me and said he walked you through the process and all was good?Check your pm's"
