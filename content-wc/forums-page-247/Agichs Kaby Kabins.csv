The boats were really nice, not your typical fly-in boats, although I've been to several fly-ins that have similar boats. They also used White River Air when we went, which is an awesome outfit to fly with.The fishing was good, mainly walleye in the 15 to 18"" range and plenty of smaller pike. A lot of weeds to fish, which was a ton of fun messing with the northerns during the day. Also some nice true jumbo perch. It's a big body of water and there is a lot to explore. We didn't explore as much as we should have though. I think the area closer to Pine Portage might be a good area to fish, but we never got up there. The only criticism I would have is that the owners weren't around the week we were there [they had other business] and left their sons in charge. Not a big deal really, they did a fine job and we didn't have any problems, but that might bother some people. We also were on the American Plan and the girlfriend had to step in and cook. The food wasn't great, but she did her best . We don't do American Plan any longer, lol.There's also three other lodges on the lake. Two of them are in the same area, but I can't say that I really noticed. I saw a few boats now and then, but not often. One of the camps wasn't really in operation though and I has new owners as of 2011 or 2012. I believe all the other camps are operated by members of the Watson's Family.There are some threads on the Michigan Fishing board about Kaby Kabins as a there's a regular group that goes from there. Probably helpful to check that out.The best thing I can say is that I would most certainly go back. Their rates are really good for what you get (at least last I checked when researching our trip in 2014) and it's a nice lake to fish. We almost went back in 2014, but opted for a new place (we almost always go somewhere new)."
4437569,Bayou,2016-01-08 23:22:00,52,When we used WRA last year I spoke with nice young lady who said she was there meeting clients that were flying in or out. If I remember right she said her parents owned the Kaby operation. She was real nice and seemed to be good person. I know not much help but seen the post.
4437649,Mike Borger,2016-01-09 04:41:00,1554,"Really? That's funny Agich's sounds like a nice operation. Having dealt with WRA a lot over the last few years they've said good things about the operation which holds a lot of weight with me.Not to derail the thread, but where are you guys going this year Adam?"
4440657,adempsey,2016-01-10 12:29:00,963,"It is a great operation. My experiences so far is that the lodges on the fly-in lakes around Hornepayne are all pretty good and the rates are excellent for what you get. I'd return to Kaby, Buck and Nagagami without hesitation.Not sure what we are doing this year. Unfortunately, money issues forced us to hold off on our trip last year and this year might be the same."
