6603644,fishron,2021-10-14 17:14:00,315,Good humor Andre and I hope border openings and crossings continue to be relaxed. It was very easy on our recent trip to southern Ontario to make the crossing. It brought to mind a conversation we had with the wife of our camp owner on our golfing day on our recent fishing trip. She was having breakfast with a friend and they made the comment that they had property in Florida that they would like to visit. (snow birds). The flying rate out of Toronto was about a thousand bucks. Out of Syracuse New York it would be about a hundred bucks. There's an incentive for the snowbirds to get the border open.
