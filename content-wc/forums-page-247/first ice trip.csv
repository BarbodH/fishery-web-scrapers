Figured a smaller lake would be safer as ice conditions are very poor everywhere.we walked out on the lake a couple of hundred yards in a foot of snow and water.i drilled first hole which took two seconds, only had 4""of ice.its enough but i like it a little thicker myself. No crappies but got into a few walleyes and some pike and perch. Nice to get out.doesnt look good for getting out for the lake trout opener on January 1 st.bigger lakes are pretty scary still.picture is the first fish we caught.good way to start the season."
