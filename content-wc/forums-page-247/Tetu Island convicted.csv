It may not be far, but make things harder on the ones that get caught and maybe others will think about what there doing. I started going to Canada in 1991 and listening to the radio in northern minasota about 6:30 about the 28th of may. Three guys had got caught with over 300 walleyes over there limit and one lost a 1991 truck and one lost a 1991 Lund they valued truck and boat around $55,000 All three were fined $2500. One guy was lucky he didn't own any thing but his fishing gear in the boat. I would say that got some attention."

4427953,Fisherman Ted,2016-01-05 16:35:00,461,This has been going on for some time. Inspection officers have been showing up for several years and tagging old systems that are not up to code. The industry conferences have been very up front about the new regulations. If you get caught you really have no one to blame but yourself. Same goes for TSSA regs (gasoline storage and pump) as well as water systems. We have known about these for years and it is just now the inspectors are starting to crack down. In many cases they do this for a reason so we have time to comply. I had to do all three systems I just mentioned but luckily I had a few years to do so or else I would have been bankrupt. An easy 150K right there alone. -FT

4428961,Obabikon,2016-01-06 06:48:00,2370,"yeah, I built a big concrete containment tank for our gas a few years ago. I purchased a UV light system in the last five years too. The M.O.E. is usually pretty realistic in their expectations. However... if they visit you, and say ""you need to do this"", start doing it. Because next time they visit, they will have another list of things to do. If you get too far behind, you're going to have to do it all at once."

4420625,zeebee,2016-01-03 08:45:00,1144,"Four U.S. residents and a Minaki-area lodge have been fined a total of $13,050 after an investigation into hunting and fishing activities at the remote tourist resort. Edward Henn of Zimmerman, Minnesota, an owner of Tetu Island Lodge, pleaded guilty and was fined $1,000 for providing false information to a conservation officer, $1,000 for licence issuing violations, $2,750 for angling without a licence, and $500 for failing to keep funds in trust. Tetu Island Lodge was fined $500 for possessing illegally killed wildlife. Zeke Thompson of North Branch, Minnesota, pleaded guilty and was fined $2,000 for unlawfully hunting black bear within 400 metres of a waste disposal site, $1,500 for hunting black bear without a licence, and $1,500 for making a false statement to a conservation officer. Thompson is also prohibited from hunting for one year. Steven Devick of Oakbrook, Illinois, pleaded guilty and was fined $1,000 for unlawfully hunting black bear within 400 metres of a waste disposal site and $500 for abandoning flesh suitable for human consumption. John Kugler of Sargent, Nebraska, pleaded guilty and was fined $800 for failing to fully validate a non-resident bear hunting licence. Upon investigation, conservation officers discovered the pelt, head and claws of a large black bear in the Tetu Island Lodge. The investigation determined that Thompson and Devick had attended the Minaki waste disposal site on September 4, 2013, where Devick used a crossbow to shoot a large bear. Thompson skinned the bear at the landfill and left the carcass behind. Thompson and Devick returned to Tetu Island Lodge, where the parts of the bear retained were placed in a freezer. During their investigation, officers also found irregularities in the lodge's hunting and fishing licence issuance system and determined that between September 20, 2012, and September 30, 2012, Henn had issued temporary Outdoors Cards to several guests but failed to issue fishing licences even though a valid fishing licence was included in the cost of their stay. As a result, several guests fished without licences. Officers later determined that Henn also failed to remit funds for issuing licences for 2013. The ministry reminds the public that hunting regulations are in place to maintain sustainable resources so that hunters may enjoy them in the future. and on top of that................. A fishing resort north of Kenora is facing a hefty fine from the Ministry of the Environment. The owner of Tetu Island Lodge has been slapped with a 10 thousand dollar fine for failing to meet sewage approval requirements. The MOE says the company failed to submit a performance report for the sewage works at the lodge. Under the Environmental Protection Act, a report has to be submitted annually. In addtion to the fine, Edward Henn and his company has been levied a victim surcharge fee of 25 hundred dollars. - See more at: http://www.895thelake.ca/news/821403....Nm3hJNSw.dpuf"
4421025,Manitou,2016-01-03 11:29:00,125,Looks like everyone got off with a slap on the wrist.
4421177,ftfarms,2016-01-03 13:02:00,444,I must agree. They should have put another zero to the end of all fines and that may not be enough.
4421561,v-bay gord,2016-01-03 15:09:00,3168,"If a game and fish violation was a felony, then Mr. Henn, the American owner, would have trouble getting back across the border to run his resort. I would applaud that result..."
4421777,Obabikon,2016-01-03 16:22:00,2370,"Sounds like Ed was fined almost $6,000 for his involvement in the licensing plus $12,500 for sewage. I know it doesn't make it acceptable, but $18,000 would make me lose some serious sleep at night."
4422385,prov1800,2016-01-03 19:45:00,5010,Well gord we both know that aint gonna happen.
4423321,Skywagon,2016-01-04 05:30:00,1106,Heard through the grapevine that a lodge on Eagle may be facing some RECENT hunting related violations....
4423561,LOW1,2016-01-04 07:56:00,2828,"I am glad that they are pushing the sewage issue. Depending on your setup an effective septic system near a lake is a very necessary and expensive undertaking, especially for a commercial-size system needed for a resort. In the good old days, the rule of thumb seemed to be that the closer leach lines were run to the lake, the better. Now things need to be drained or pumped a distance away from the lake. I think that the number of noncompliant septic systems out there may be surprising."
4423593,MrSimon,2016-01-04 08:06:00,922,"It's nice that the authorities tracked down and punished some pretty serious law breakers. Unfortunately there are a decent number of ""good ol boys"" in the hunting/fishing world who think laws don't apply to them. They give the rest of us a bad name and I'm happy the officers did what it takes to track them down and fine them."
4426209,Guest,2016-01-05 06:50:00,0,I live just a few miles from Zimmerman MN where the main perp is apparently from. If it were up to me they would be in jail and pay fines with not just one more zero but several. I'm ashamed and embarrassed that someone from my area would behave this way. They should have all hunting and fishing rights stripped in Canada and in the US for a long long time.
