4436337,Bill Krejca,2016-01-08 14:54:00,6107,"Parking is maybe a mile from camp. Camp to ""town"" in maybe 20-25 minutes. Much longer way if you go around and boat into NF. Bill"
4436369,Hawker,2016-01-08 15:07:00,3967,"Adempsey's link is indeed the YWC Camp (on the island). If you'll zoom out a tad, then move to the right (east) towards the east bank of Stevens Bay, you'll see three docks fairly close together. The two on the north side are the docks at YWC landing (where they pick you up) or you launch your boat if you are a YWC guest, and parking. At most it is a 5 minute boat ride from the camp, and only a ten minute drive from the landing to Nestor Falls. You can also move the satellite view map further to the east and follow Young's Road out to Hwy 71. The road(s) you see to the NW & N of the island are to a launch used by several camps on Crow lake for their guests to have access to LOW."

4442961,OffCourse,2016-01-11 07:34:00,17,"That is way better adempsey. Thank you. Looks like a neat place. I like the fact you can be on the island but if you wanted for a rainy day head to town easily. And, the lodge has AC!!!! lol"
4432689,OffCourse,2016-01-07 09:41:00,17,Looking for information on Youngs Wilderness in Nestor Falls. How is that area? I've always wondered if the same experience can be had so close to a town/city? Is the fishing pressure that much greater or is that area a good area?
4432961,Obabikon,2016-01-07 11:28:00,2370,"Perry and Carol are great people, and have been doing it for quite some time. They have a very good reputation, and if you choose Young's I'm sure you will have an awesome trip. As far as the fishing pressure goes... I'm not sure what you mean. Are you talking about staying in Nestor Falls or Sioux Narrows? Because if it's the Narrows, you're most likely looking at a long boat ride every day to catch walleye. I'm not overly familiar with fishing around Nestor Falls, but I know a lot of guys take the boat rides through Sabaskong to find fish. That doesn't mean there aren't fish close... but there is quite a bit more traffic over that way."
4433209,OffCourse,2016-01-07 13:26:00,17,"Well, isn't that camp close to nestor falls? We would potentially be staying at the camp. But will have kids with so a long boat ride is not ideal. thanks"
4433281,DeBo,2016-01-07 13:51:00,211,The camp is located in Stevens Bay. The launch is fairly close to Nestor but any boat traffic from nestor has to drive a long ways around to get back there. Everything I have researched about that part of the lake is that it is very quiet and isolated. Looking at the map it should be. If you go to the navionics webapp website you can view that part of the lake to get a feel. Maybe check out google earth to get a better feel of how close it is to town. The navionics app doesn't show the highways etc. If your kids like to be out in the woods I think it would be a great option. Plus they advertise the launch is very close so you could easily zip over to your car and visit nestor for a while. Plus you have the grocery store just in case. If you have money and really want to give them an experience try and go to Young's Kishkutena outpost. Always wanted to try that one out.
4433337,OffCourse,2016-01-07 14:19:00,17,I'm looking for it in Stevens Bay but am not seeing it? The location on their map or if you google it shows it right on 71. I can't find youngs road on google either?
4433569,adempsey,2016-01-07 15:45:00,963,I believe this is it:http://www.bing.com/maps/?v=2&cp=49.190902~-93.983088&lvl=15&sty=h&form=LMLTCChttps://goo.gl/maps/oVWiyd4Xpo22Youngs Road
4433769,lakerbreaker,2016-01-07 16:53:00,253,"Yes, they are off 71 in a really quiet area. The resort we stay has a shared access with a couple other resorts in Stevens bay and we have dumped in there a few times. There are walleyes not too far from that camp. I know lots of people run all the way up into Miles bay (which we have done too) and that's a pretty good jaunt. I don't mind driving around up there though as I never get tired of the scenery...."
4433937,Hawker,2016-01-07 18:08:00,3967,"Been going to Young's Wilderness Camp for 23 yrs+ and LOVE IT there. Young's Road is off of 71 about 5 miles north of Nestor Falls. Young's Road is on the west side of Hwy 71, across the hwy from Black Bear Camp on Crow Lake and dead ends at their private landing.Stevens Bay is fairly secluded and smack in the middle of ""PRIME"" Walleye, Crappie, Smallmouth, Largemouth, Northern Pike AND Muskie fishing,,,,,,,,, within only minutes from the camp. With the exception of one year we've been going, we are always up there the week of Memorial Day beginning the Friday before till the Saturday following. On average, you MIGHT see a dozen or so boats (other than YWC guests) the whole week, and we've never been bothered by any of them. You'll be at least (depending of size and HP of boat) 1/2 hr to 45 minute boat ride to Nestor Falls from their camp and I may be exaggerating getting there that fast, never done it!!Fishing pressure is minimal at best, and one of the best all around areas for multi species you'll find on Lake of the Woods! Perry & Carol are super camp owners operators and do their very best to make your stay with them a memorable trip and you'll wanna go back, I would almost bet on it!Just a note in closing, feel free to PM me if you need more info on YWC. Near as I can tell, the intersection for Young's Road and Hwy 71 should be very near to GPS coordinates N 49 11.182 W 93 56.018"
4434905,Bill Krejca,2016-01-08 07:01:00,6107,"Well-run camp, fairly secluded, beautiful scenery right from the cabin. Bill"
4436065,OffCourse,2016-01-08 13:00:00,17,"that does look like it adempsey. Thank you. Also, is their landing right there where you see those roads by the island? You wouldn't even have to take a boat to town if you are parked that close? That does look like a neat area."
