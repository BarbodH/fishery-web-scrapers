4397281,bushead11,2015-12-23 15:06:00,151,Wondering if any of you guys like to listen to music while your fishing. Looking for recommendations on a waterproof portable speaker for the boat. We stay at an outpost without outlets so we are already prepared with charger banks and should get 7-10 charges of an iPhone out of them. Thanks in advance...
4397385,SinOrSwim,2015-12-23 15:51:00,1528,We do. I haven't taken a bluetooth speaker wiht but I just use a pigtail and plug it in to the speakers. I have never worried about a waterproof speaker because if it's raining it stays in the dry bag just like my camera etc. There are a ton of speakers out there. Just grab one and take it with ya. You will be glad youdid.

4404177,forgop,2015-12-27 13:57:00,880,"I bought this to use for my trip last year: Eton Rugged rukus The solar-powered, Bluetooth-ready, smartphone-charging speaker https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B8PRRTS..._L7eGwbHRZV52QSmall footprint, lightweight. Bluetooth, charges via USB to take in with a full charge, with USB outs to recharge your cell phone, and recharges via solar charging. Not going to brag about its sound, but a great functional device for a fly-in when you don't have a generator and don't want to pack a bunch of batteries. Not waterproof to my knowledge, but took occasion rain and chop from boat at full speed without issue."
