4443465,Riverkeg,2016-01-11 09:53:00,134,Agreed! One of several reasons we are trying a different resort this year. They clearly mention it in their brochure.

4433505,Riverkeg,2016-01-07 15:25:00,134,Man I love this forum. Just wasting some time today looking through various threads and stumbled across this thread. 3 of the 4 in my fishing party travel abroad for business at least a couple of times per year and not one of us has even considered the thought of a rebate on the resort tax. Personally I have bought items overseas and submitted forms for tax refunds so I'm laughing at myself as I type. Wait until I talk to the other 2 idiots that didn't think of this either!We'll all be doing this to each other:
4433585,Carnhzkr,2016-01-07 15:45:00,964,"Keep in mind that the rebate is not applicable for all Canadian lodges - only those that provide a ""qualifying service"". This is a bit vague, but qualifying services include transportation (fly-in or boat-in), guiding, I think fish cleaning, and I don't know what else. Since 2015, along with your invoice, you must also submit a copy of a brochure or documentation that details what services are provided in the outfitter package purchased."
4433649,v-bay gord,2016-01-07 16:01:00,3168,"Rather than smacking yourselves in the head, ask yourself the question ""How come the resort never mentioned I could get half my tax $ back""??"
4434561,roscoe33,2016-01-07 22:53:00,653,"It makes sense to me. The sportsman card is a per person surcharge. Not per license. If you participate in several different activities, you only buy the sportsman card once, not for each different license you may buy. Do bird hunting, moose hunting, bear hunt, etc, you only buy one sportsman card. If they just raised the cost of the license as you suggest, an avid outdoorman that participated in many activities, would pay a half dozen times."
4434649,pjshorthorn,2016-01-08 03:56:00,5654,Excellent point !!!! PjShorthorn.
4434897,Bill Krejca,2016-01-08 06:57:00,6107,Never thought of it that way. I feel better about the terrific deal we are all getting. Bill
4435017,rosh1,2016-01-08 07:36:00,275,I took advantage of the exchange Monday and got my lic. also
4442617,Guest,2016-01-11 04:25:00,0,fellow fishermen after many sleepless night I return to the board to ask for forgiveness for my past complaints regarding outdoor door cards and hst return I did find at Canadian bank (td trade) that allowed me to open and account and cash my check for free thanks again for all your help in the past jim wolf Chicago boys especially minnow and wallhanger remember to forgive is devine
4421409,Downrigger,2016-01-03 14:11:00,60,"FYI. Just renewed Outdoor Card, and purchased 2016 Ontario Sportman's fishing lic. for both my wife and me. Purchased online - very user friendly. Paid for purchase with my cr. cd. Went to view my cr. cd. statement online and found that the purchase reflected an exchange rate of 1.35. The Canadian cost for each of us was $97.47 Ca. and my cr. cd. was charged $70.54 US for each for a total savings to us of $53.86 Ca. That will buy about 8.5 doz. minnows or possibly 2 or 3 beers Cheaper to buy online now than wait arrival at lodge."
4423497,zeebee,2016-01-04 07:28:00,1144,Low Oil $....low CDN$. Find a lodge charging CDN$ and save a bundle.Dont quite understand why some charge USD as all their expenses are in CDN$ and none have lowered prices as the native dollar has slipped. Bet they would be quick in raising prices if the CDN$ was at a premium. Such is the way.......As a Canadian I am offended when asked to pay in USD for services that take place in my own country. Bet if I went to work for them and asked for USD wages they would tell me to take a hike...so I too tell them to go to .......I rant.
4424657,v-bay gord,2016-01-04 14:27:00,3168,I deposited a U.S. check today and the exchange rate was 35%. So my guest receives a $679 credit on his $500 deposit....nice for him! The teller mentioned someone buying U.S. $ that day paid a 42% exchange rate. A good year for U.S. travelers to be buying Canadian goods and services......unless of course you're not getting the benefit of the exchange rate. A bad year for Canadians buying anything south of the border.
4428721,Guest,2016-01-06 04:39:00,0,minnow why doesn't the dnr from Canada just raise the price of the license ( they are doing ity by making us purchase the card) just more work for us fishermen every few years (raise the license fee and eliminate the card just more work for us what a joke ( do they think they are fooling us by not raising the license fee) does not make sense jim wolf Chicago boys resort owner told me last September I would not get back my hst/gst tax refund well I know how to use the system received my check I know what they want on the bill and I demand the owners put certain statements on the bill before I leave; the system is to take advantage of us fishermen I would be willing to bet 75% of us fishermen never get the refund (stays in Canada for the government) because they don't want to waste time at border going home to collect it or disgusted working with the Canadian officials who nick pick the forms asking you resubmit several times and just give up (what a joke) finally I live in south florida most banks will not cash a check from Canadian government ( or wait 2 months to clear ) finally found a Canadian bank td dominion open checking account received money in week jim wolf Chicago boys
4428777,Skyraptor,2016-01-06 05:12:00,291,"Never in all my years going to Canada did I have a problem getting my refund back. In fact I'm glad they offer that to tourists coming to Canada. My lodge upon departure gives me a statement along with the form to fill out. Get home fill it out and pop it in the mail. Within a month my check arrives and my credit union deposits it in my account less a $15 fee and a 7 day hold on the funds to make sure it clears. Pretty simple if you ask me. Highly doubt that 75% of the fisherman do not get their refund. If you lodge is on top of things and gives you a clear statement, you fill out the form correctly there is no problem. Does not take a college education or to demand certain things on the bill to get your refund."
4428849,pjshorthorn,2016-01-06 05:53:00,5654,"So if I get the jist of your message regarding the HST tax rebate correctly, your last resort owner knew your trip would not qualify for a rebate, but you know how the Canadian HST system works and got your refund check regardless. Your statement,if took literally, could imply that you may have falsified a resort invoice in order to receive a refund that you did not qualify for. You also indicate that you demand resort owners put "" certain statements"" on the invoice in order for you to get an HST refund. It seems that this statement would indicate that you are working the system instead of using lodges that provide qualifying services. There are a ton of lodges that provide great services that would automatically qualify for an HST rebate if you sought them out and were willing to pay for the services. Seems like you aren't willing to do the work to find those lodges, want a cheap trip cost and then bully the lodge owner into documenting services you didn't receive or pay for during your trip. Most lodges that provide qualifying services will fill out the HST forms for you and submit them for you. All you have to do is sign the paperwork. You can even keep the rebate check and bring it with you towards future trips in Canada. There isn't an expiration date on the check. That way you don't have to get pissed about banks in Florida not cashing your check. Send me your address and I'll mail you a check for the portion of your rebate check you would receive this year. You should enjoy the trip more and you should not have to worry about scamming the system to get about $50 USD. One random thought that came to mind while typing is........Maybe this message from Jim Wolf Chicago Boys is a contributing reason why you are constantly looking for new places to fish.....sometimes guests are not invited back for a reason. Just an observation...... PjShorthorn."
4428889,Skyraptor,2016-01-06 06:06:00,291,Well said pjshorthorn!!!
4428937,BornToFish,2016-01-06 06:36:00,1224,"SkyRaptor - you also said it well. Now, back to the original intent for this thread. I renewed my Outdoor Card about one year ago, and also purchased my fishing license at the same time. I decided to go with the three year license for the first time, so that my license and Outdoor Card will expire at the same time. I also took advantage of a favorable exchange rate, but not quite as favorable as it is now. A benefit of doing this is that the Outdoor Card has my fishing license printed on it, so that I do not need to carry a separate piece of paper with me. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4429017,pjshorthorn,2016-01-06 07:09:00,5654,"Thanks for getting us back on point. I hope in the next few years I can graduate to the point where it makes sense to buy an annual license or a 3 year license. I appreciate you mentioning the exchange rate savings by getting my license online ,not to mention, that we won't need to exchange more US funds in order to cover the cost of the license (s) in loonies. I need to look into the online option for sure !!!! PjShorthorn."
4429065,v-bay gord,2016-01-06 07:28:00,3168,"I'm not sure if having ""Pain in the butt"" written on your bill constitutes an eligible service qualifying you for a rebate.....but on the positive side they can't accuse you of fabrication!"
