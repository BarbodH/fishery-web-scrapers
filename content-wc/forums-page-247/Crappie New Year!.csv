The giveaway is the absence of movement and the glassy eye shown due to the ""bends"", as they were pulled up from the depths through the hole. Glad to see the fish were kept, it is sort of surprising the number of anglers returning fish to the water after pulling them in from the deep, thinking(?) they are practicing catch and release, when the fish in reality never make it back to the bottom. Keep the videos coming, it is a pleasant anecdote for the cabin fever anticipated! Bill"
