Dan from WRA thinks Pickle Lake would work best for us out of the three we discussed. I'm still waiting on Buck lake to contact me. 2 phone calls and emails as well and no response. Looks like WRA might win by default.Bushman,I went to Pickle last August with my daughter. The report with pics is on Mike's website. Great lake, great cabin. We are going to Shekak this year. Dan, the owner of WRA is very easy to work with. The biggest benefit I see with WRA is that they own their own planes. So if you do have any issues they will be there that day to assist you. I highly recommend Pickle Lake and WRA."

4430505,Bushman74,2016-01-06 15:44:00,8,Great report!Thanks for the info. We ended up booking White Owl but i will be keeping WRA in my sights for next year. Gotta spread the love around.
3500962,Bayou,2015-02-02 09:04:00,52,"I will be taking the family up to Hambleton Lake with WRA the first week of August and I'm having trouble finding any reports. I've fished Bulldozer Lake with WRA before but never Hambleton. I've did a lot of looking on the net and the only mention of Hambleton is one or two sentences from the same as person as in slow fishing with enough to eat. I was impressed with WRA before and Hambleton is a deluxe cabin that's a must with the princess and kids. I know there has to be more reports of the lake but probably not to many online resources. Anyone with any info would be much appreciated, thanks."
4006162,naz58,2015-06-28 17:36:00,6,My wife and I are at Hambleton the week before you. Our first time there as well. I'm having no luck with info either. Hopefully we'll have a few minutes plane side as you are arriving and I can be a little more helpful. see you then.
4006538,Bayou,2015-06-28 19:32:00,52,"naz58, I look forward to meeting you and your wife. I'm a little apprehensive to the lake being clear but I'm sure it will be fine. A buddy and myself did well on bulldozer so I'm sure hambleton will be fine. From what I gathered it can be streaky but wanted to find a place that was reasonable for the family to see if they enjoy themselves. I've already started to look for a place to take them next year as well as for the guys trip. The guy trip this year consists of going into white owl lake on the 17th of July with fish buck lake. I'm really looking forward to that trip to try that lake. As long as I or the family hasn't killed each other on trip up we will meet you on the dock."
4420185,Bushman74,2016-01-03 06:20:00,8,"Hey guys, How did your trip end up? Was the fishing good?"
4420433,Mike Borger,2016-01-03 08:07:00,1554,"Hey Jeff, I'll assume you saw this, but maybe not. It seems like a nice lake, have heard good things about it.http://www.canadafishingguide.net/fo...-2615-aug-215/"
4420473,naz58,2016-01-03 08:13:00,6,"Thanks for linking the report Mike. Jeff, ask away with any questions or shoot me a pm."

4420617,Mike Borger,2016-01-03 08:44:00,1554,"They're all great options really. Keep trying with Buck, there's no huge rush and you will eventually get a hold of them."
4423889,Bayou,2016-01-04 10:24:00,52,"Bushman, I returned your pm's. Let me know if you have any further questions. Bill"
