1451082,TIGHTLINER,2012-06-19 06:57:00,223,I just returned from my annual spring fishing trip to rays camps on ramsey lake. Weather was great if you want to get a sun tan only had one day where we did not have sun and that was in the afternoon when a front moved in. Kicked up some pretty good waves that evening so no fishing was done that night. Fishing was pretty good for the most part considering the mayfly hatch along with the days of sun. Nothing has really changed at the camp the new owners kim and justin are very good at trying to please the guests with places to fish and what to use. With paul not being there this year bill and martha kearns former owners are there to help run the camp and keep it running smooth. Justin and kim purchased 10 new lund boats last year and the motors all ran good i never saw anyone in camp having trouble with them. The shelves were all stocked with food and the breads were just like they came out of the bakery. We met new faces in camp this year however i have changed my weeks but the owners say most everyone is a repeat from years past with new one scattered in here and there. With kim an justin taking over my hats off to them for running a great camp and i can only see good things to come from them and the lake they have. Their three kids will be a big help to them once they grow up they are very well behaved and you never knew they were around. If someone is looking for a true relaxing fishing trip in ontario look at rays camps on ramsey lake. Anyone looking to go there i have maps of the lake marked with fishing area which i will share pm me.

1451620,northernbite,2012-06-20 08:22:00,1186,How was the water level? I'm going up the 12th of July.Paul
1451638,TIGHTLINER,2012-06-20 08:50:00,223,The water levels seemed maybe a little low and i am talking 6 inches. When we were at bisco there was a crew going into the dams to repair them so i am not sure what will happen if anything to the water levels. I did not see any new rocks showing over the last 25 years of going in. I been there when you could not see the docks and i have been there when you needed a ladder to get into your boats. All and all i would say water is about normal. Hope this helps?
1451704,northernbite,2012-06-20 10:51:00,1186,"Thanks, this is my 24th year up there, I actually go in from top and tent camp once you come out of the narrows. I like bring my own boat. I plan on traveling down to rays and check it out. As we get older a cabin may be in order.Thanks, Paul"
1451781,Guest,2012-06-20 13:53:00,0,Paul - I fish not far from there as well (36th year). Great cabins at really reasonable rates where I go. I have met guys at camp from Union City and Youngsville areas. Let me know if you want info. Bruce.
