I've herd of one called taylors cove but can't find there web site. Was wondering if anyone had the e mails of them that don't have web sites?Also if there are any guides you would recommend to get to know the lake?

It is located on Bear Passage which is a channel connecting Swell/Seine Bays and Baseline/Red Gut Bays. From the resort you have many choices of which direction to go. The SMB fisherman flock here in June because of the resorts location. Across the channel is Coppens Resort and the Fisheries is about a 1/2 mile away. I've stayed a both Taylors and the Fisheries and both are fine with me. There is another resort located in Red Gut Bay called the Landings. I usually stay here in late May because it's close to the areas we want too fish for walleyes and crappies. Late May and June for Walleye Mid June for SMB Early June and September for Crappie September for Walleye, Crappie and Pike There are some Muskie Other drive to lakes are available Fishing can be challenging in July to mid-August"
