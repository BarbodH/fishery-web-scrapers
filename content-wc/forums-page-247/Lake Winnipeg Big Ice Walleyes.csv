But even a nice 25 or 26 inch walleye is soo thick on this lake you'll think its way bigger Heres some good clips of big walleye being caught on Lake Winnipeg through the ice :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGDm3pnhrjs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ_h5ZWaTlg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILWMzHiNgsY
