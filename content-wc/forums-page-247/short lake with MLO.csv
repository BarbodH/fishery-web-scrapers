4433961,smithcr1981,2016-01-07 18:24:00,42,I am going to short lake with mattice lake outfitters in September. I have done one other fly in in sept. 2 years ago with another outfitter.Im looking for advice on short lake and the ogoki reservoir. I like the idea of such a vast area to explore and fish. walleyes will be the main fish but I love tying in to some big northerns. any info would be great. im sure the owners will give me advice to but looking for other first hand info.
