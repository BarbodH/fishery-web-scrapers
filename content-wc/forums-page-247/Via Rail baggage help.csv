Each person is allowed 2 carry on bags under 25 lbs and 2 checked bags under 50 lbs. This train also offers regional services which allows 2 hermetically sealed boxes of groceries free, 3rd box $3 and no polystyrene containers with perishable food. I understand why they would ban foam coolers as they easily fall apart and leak. I do not understand what is the definition of a hermetically sealed grocery box with tape, their requirement. I was wondering if a foam cooler can be used to pack perishable items then sealed in a plastic bag and put in a taped box to meet the regional grocery requirement. I would appreciate some feedback on this, especially anyone who has trained in groceries. Seanik"
