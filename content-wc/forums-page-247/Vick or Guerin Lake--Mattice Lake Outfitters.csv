Having done a search on these lakes on this site, I'm still kind of undecided. Has anybody here had some recent experiences on either of these two lakes, who could speak to the fishing? I know Mattice is a top-notch outfitter, of that I have absolutely no doubt. I'd like to stay on one of the smaller lakes; fishing one of the larger lakes like Mojikit kind of un-nerves me, especially if we only have six days to fish. I've done over 20 fly-ins with Nestor Falls Outposts, but I have some conflicts this coming summer that is forcing me to change dates/outfitters, at least for this year. Thanks for any feedback or advice you can lend!"
