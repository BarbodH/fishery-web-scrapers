1383753,drew59,2012-01-19 18:31:00,87,My wife and have been there several times. We quit going when I stopped flying our own plane and my kids were ready for college. This is a TOP NOTCH resort. The fishing is fantastic. Bill and Val are as good as it gets. You can't go wrong if flying in is your thing. Let me know if you want more info.
