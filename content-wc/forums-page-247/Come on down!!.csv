4439153,Andre (wallyandre),2016-01-09 19:34:00,2274,I travel a lot between Quebec and Upstate NY and Vermont and the money exhange is important for me and I was thinking tonight about our exhange. Roughly it's about .35 on a Canadian $ for you guys from the US!! I'm only dreaming if I I could get the same kind of money back. If you ever think on coming in the province of Quebec for a fishing tripI will be glad helping you planning a trip in my province. The outfitters are planning in Canadian$ so all the rates at this moment are around 35 to 40% less for you americans friends. That applied also if you are looking for Canadian build boats like Princecraft. PM me if you need infos
