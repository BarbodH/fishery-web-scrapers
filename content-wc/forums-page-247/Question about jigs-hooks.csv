4419969,BornToFish,2016-01-02 21:14:00,1224,"I fished last year at a lodge that does not have access to live minnows. I used frozen minnows and salted minnows. I used my standard ""live bait' style jigs with short shank hooks. I hooked the shiner and spot tails minnows through the eye and out the back in order to move the hook as far back on the minnow as I could. Despite this, I frequently had bites where I got the jig and minnow head back, with the walleye getting the remainder of the minnow. I was thinking it might be time to switch style of jig, so that a longer shank hook could be inserted into the mouth of the minnow, out the gills and then rotated so I could put the hook of the minnow in near the tail - behind the dorsal fin. Your thoughts? What style jig and hook can you recommend for this application? Good fishing and tight lines!!"

They worked great, we were mainly using Sirmanski jigs, 1/4 oz with a longer, I guess you could say normal length hook rigged the minnows as you have posted. I'm planning on using the frozen salted minnows for my next trip with Hidden Bay. They gave us some live minnows to try, the salties worked great and east to use! Good luck!"
4420305,lassh,2016-01-03 07:28:00,553,"You could try a stinger hook, #10 treble tied to 2 1/2 to 3"" mono attached to the bend of your jig hook. Just let the stinger hang loose off the back not attached to minnow, and when the fish sucks water in to get to minnow tail, the hook will go into mouth and you can catch the light biter. There are times when this is effective and you will catch several fish on the stinger, and there are times when it doesn't matter. I tried those short shanked jigs years ago and had the same problem with tail biters. I didn't really use them much after that because I didn't develop confidence with them. I thought they would increase the hook rate but it was opposite at the time. I know lots of guys are very effective with those short shanked jigs."
4420449,Fishoil,2016-01-03 08:12:00,1277,"I use a standard round head jig, usually 1/4 oz with live or salted minnows, no stinger. I pour them myself and use an Eagle Claw #570 hook in 1/0 size. I'm pouring more today, gotta do something to keep the winter blues at bay."
4420553,Pooch,2016-01-03 08:31:00,4619,"I fish with several Canadian guys who live & breath fishing live bait. I've never seen them use a short shanked live bait jig. When I fish with them and use a short shanked jig, I think I lose more minnows than they do with their long shanked jigs as I lip hook and they thread the hook through the minnow.That said, I use a leech most of the time and a short shanked jig is best (for me).If you are lip hooking a short shanked jig is good. If you are threading the hook through the minnow a regular long shanked hook is about the only jig that can do that. All depends on how you are hooking your bait. Long shanked jigs with a collar are more practical as you can fish live bait or plastic with them. Cheaper to buy, too. (unless you pour your own as many of us do) Short shanked hooks are more limited in how you can fish them. Both have a place and time.Pooch"

4422513,yoopertrout,2016-01-03 20:03:00,1172,"I used salted minnows in 2014, and they worked really well. I was using regular length shanked jigs. I did have some bite offs. It helped to run the hook through the mouth, out the gill, an then through the side of the minnow. We had twister tails on for action, so the minnow looking stiff didn't seem to matter."
4422753,rather-be-fishin,2016-01-03 21:04:00,429,"We always use jigs with long hooks & bait the minnow like ""Yoopertrout"" said. Works good! Check these jigs out: Danlure.com. 1/4 & 3/8 oz They worked great for us last 2 years in Canada!!! RBF üëçüé£üò¨"
