1435162,Mark R,2012-05-14 11:56:00,1538,Cabelas sells a product called Nikwax. They sell a kit that has the solution for washing the rain gear and then a solution for waterproofing. Waterproofing works better on clean material. Cost is $19.99
1435164,Mark R,2012-05-14 11:58:00,1538,make sure all the velcro is pressed together before washing & drying. I didn't it caught the liner of the jacket and tore it up.

It's a ""performance fabric protector"" approved for use with Gore-Tex. Got it locally for $4.98...Works great...easy to use...one can can easily treat my rain gear twice."
1437487,MorganMan,2012-05-18 20:46:00,341,"I have some old guide wear also that has lost it's water shedding ability on the fronts of the legs etc over the years from wear and tear. I did some research and found a product called Revivex (some dudes here told me of this product also) which I ended up ordering online. Works great. REI and some other places are listed on their website, but I had to order the one product I wanted. Good luck"
1437634,TIGHTLINER,2012-05-19 11:37:00,223,I have a outfit from kool dri probably 10 years now. It did start to leak at the seams on the shoulders. I bought a can of camp dry sprayed the suit twice heavy around the seams. Seemed to work great last year hope it holds up this year also.
