1437174,wallydave,2012-05-18 07:43:00,2151,How are things looking for your opening days? It looks like Ear Falls section will have a wet and warm opener. How about the rest of the gang?
1437756,wallydave,2012-05-19 20:39:00,2151,"How did the walleye opener go?? I hope the weather and the bite cooperate! The rest of us would like to hear how deep, what colors, water temps and water levels are! Good luck!"
1437765,Gunner_Fletch,2012-05-19 21:04:00,74,It was very nice and calm on LOTW this morning....a few showers but managed to steer clear of the dark clouds! Lots of Walleyes....biggest 24inch. Depth....17 to 29 ish. Jigging only. Only fished half the day and managed to put 70 km on the boat.
1438183,wallydave,2012-05-21 07:03:00,2151,"Hopefully, the bite is so good, that all the season openers have been too busy, or to far away from the internet, to post how they are doing! Our group will be hitting the road in 25 days, and hitting the water in 26! Thanks for the reports so far! Help the rest of us that are stilling waiting for that first tap tap with your reports!"
1434540,HeHooksHimself,2012-05-12 18:20:00,725,"Pikeslayer, I am thinking you must be stalking my house. Garage sales literally do start around here on Thursdays and although I could use some new furniture, I think I might just save the ten bucks and buy a couple dozen minnows. Also, that kitchen remodeling has been put off so long she won't even notice. As far as the reunion in Gary, I might just slip away and fish Wolf Lake there in South Chicago. I love the few of a steel mill while I'm castingSo, bottom line, if I DO go, can you make us up some meals and freeze them and ship them to the reunion in Gary, I'll take them from there. I really gotta try that walleye chowder. Enough to serve eight please. And could you send the naked native lady that cleans your fish. Okay, I'm in....unless it gets too cold."
1434579,Rich B,2012-05-12 20:26:00,1081,You got it Glenman......no worries about us catching all the fish (ha) though we'll certainly try to catch our share.... Rich B
1435564,wallydave,2012-05-15 07:27:00,2151,With just a few days before the season opener how many and where are going to start this season up for the rest who are still waiting?? We I am counting on some reports!! Help a guy out that is waiting!! Thanks!
1435649,bus33,2012-05-15 09:29:00,289,I am heading to Ear Falls on the 17th and hitting until the 25th. It's my first Canada trip so really can't wait. I would assume everything is a little accelerated up there with the mild weather?
1435690,Knoxabilly,2012-05-15 10:37:00,225,"Hey Bus, where are you staying. I'll be at Evergreen the same week!"
1435786,Tin Cann,2012-05-15 13:42:00,6,Good luck next week at WLC . Say hi to Anne and Herb for us . We don't go till June 16th hopefully there will be a few fish left.
1435790,NathanH,2012-05-15 13:47:00,697,Will be fishing North West Bay of Rainy Lake on the 19th of May. I will be sure to post back the results as soon as I return on Memorial day Weekend. God I hope my wife doesnt make me do yard work when I return! This could delay my post.
1435824,bus33,2012-05-15 15:21:00,289,"I am going with a group of guys that own a cabin near ear falls. Not sure exactly where yet as I'm just tagging along. From what they say it is a few miles from the actual town of Ear Falls. West Des Moines, eh? I'm up in Ankeny. Good Luck!"
1435836,HeHooksHimself,2012-05-15 16:00:00,725,Will do. We'll try to leave a few big ones for you. I will post a report upon our return. We leave Thurs. night!

1434274,HeHooksHimself,2012-05-11 19:10:00,725,"We're scheduled to leave Thursday, but I am having second thoughts. Its such a long trip from northern Indiana and gas is so expensive. We have to drive through Chicago-yuk. When we get there, it looks like there is some rain in the forecast and I am not sure I want to get wet. The camp only has outhouses and I can't plug in my laptop because no electricity. There's a couple movies coming out that I wanted to see and how am I going to know who won American Idol? We have a river running through South Bend, maybe I'll just fish The St. Joe and a friend has a farm pond. Maybe I'll just do that and sleep in my own bed. I'm thinking about it...."
1434456,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-12 11:15:00,1460,"You don't want to miss any of the riveting NBA playoff. The South Bend citywide garage sales start Thursday. Your wife called, said she was gonna remodel the kitchen next week. Just so happens that your 4th cousin on your wife's side is hosting the family reunion in Gary that weekend. Your brother in law also called and asked me to fill in in case you can't go. His primary concern was that you might not make it from the debilitating red boat syndrome you have been suffering from this winter. Oh heck, you probably should go, if nothing else but to protect your walleye holes from the red plague."

Fly 45 miles west to Donald Lake and staying at Wamserville Lodge. Can't wait. This is our third annual trip to Wammy! I'll be on the lake 5/29 through 6/5. The last two years we have gone in late July, early Aug and the fishing was good, not great. I'm expecting big things this year. I can't wait for the cooler temps and possible rain showers. Happy fishing everyone! Be safe!"
