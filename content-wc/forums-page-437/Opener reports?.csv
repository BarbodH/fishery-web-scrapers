So file your report here! Thanks, Bill 41 days and counting to my first trip to Lac Seul!"
1437813,Golden Eagle,2012-05-20 06:23:00,2642,"Fished in hard rain and big waves. Got into lots of walleyes and plenty of big pike on a corner and a hump. All caught on jigs. Fished only 1 point and 1 hump all day. Didn't need to move. Moved to the hump only to check it out. Hump is actually about a 2 acre reef.Name of point is Walleye Point. Should be Walleye and Big Pike Point.Foggy, calm and cool this a.m. Going out in a bit. Nothing in the air. No birds. No planes. All grounded."
1437900,Skywagon,2012-05-20 10:10:00,1106,"It was the warmest temperatures for opener that can be remembered for many years. Yesterday we went to Eagle and got all our eaters in fairly short order, the rain was sporadic and the wind was very tolerable. Low overcast this morning with no planes flying, but no fog on the lake, will venture out the back door this afternoon and wet a line."
1437916,TIGHTLINER,2012-05-20 11:05:00,223,Golden eye and skywagon were the eyes in shallow water yet or had they moved into the deeper parts?? Headed out this friday for the nakina area. What kind of depths are we talking? Thanks
1437923,Skywagon,2012-05-20 11:19:00,1106,"We fished shallow yesterday and caught them in 2-4 ft, never needed to try anything else. Talked to a neighbor last night that fished on our home lake and found some out in deeper water on a reef, guess they are scattering out. Water temp where we fished yesterday was 63 degrees."
