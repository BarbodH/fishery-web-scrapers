OMG delicious. And Walleye Tacos with a Chipotle sour cream and good cabbage and onions one of my all time favorite.
1436658,doubleheader,2012-05-17 06:17:00,2652,"For me it's either a deep fried fresh perch, northern or walleye. I don't have a preference between the three. Next would be a pan fried rainbow trout."

1436922,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-17 15:13:00,235,"This comes down to about maybe a half dozen to a dozen fresh water species from North America at most that people on these forums have tried. Who knows what might be tastier on other continents? For me, I like them all except for sucker (yes, I tried it once). But there's just something about lightly breaded fresh yellow perch. Among all fish, it's hard to beat halibut."
1436360,Bill Krejca,2012-05-16 14:41:00,6107,"I'm with you, Bob. Unlike many other species, bigger crappies are (in my opinion) much better than the smaller ones. Those large LOW crappies just flake the layers apart when fried up, completely different texture than small ones. Bill Krejca"
1436365,Bill Krejca,2012-05-16 14:46:00,6107,"Now that I think some more about it (not difficult, yum), lake trout on the grill on foil, seasoned with Hy-Vee made meat seasoning is also hard to beat. Bill"

They are quite small so you need to catch quite a few for a meal, but as for taste, what else would you expect from a landlocked Sockeye Salmon? Yummy!!!!!

I always eat too much! Otherwise perch is a good second and northern 3rd if you get the Y bones out. Lately I've been grilling my fish and that has also been very good.
1436520,JETSTER,2012-05-16 20:10:00,448,"Lotta people here (old timers) swear pike are the best,others say Cat fish and I say .......Walleye by far is the best but I did cook a Stealhead once that was awesome as well!!!

Drop the skinny pieces into the oil a minute earlier than the thicker pieces and everything in the fryer is done at the same time. We dump the fried fish onto a cookie sheet covered with a paper grocery bag to drain the oil and put it in the pre-heated oven until everything is ready to eat. Remove the Y-bones when you filet the fish if you know how. If you don't, you can remove them after the filets are cooked. Just break the cooked filet in half, parallel to the lateral line. With a little practice, all the Y-bones pop up for easy removal. Rick"
1436245,Guest,2012-05-16 12:02:00,0,"I think the best fresh water fish species to eat in Canada are; 1. Perch 2. Walleye 3. Crappie 4. Pike (deboned) 5. Brook Trout from a creek. If I catch a Bluegill or a Sunfish it goes back! Not worth the bother to clean. The Lake I fish has ""Magnum"" size Perch which are consistly up around 13 - 15"" where I can get big filets off of them. I caught one 2yrs ago that was just over 2lbs!! There is a Lake 3hrs from my house that has Perch consistently just over 2lbs and a couple have been 2 1/2 lbs from what I heard. The main fish up there is ""Walleye"" and they think Bluegills, Crappie, Perch are garbage fish and no one fishes them. I was told by a professional angler who is a guide in that area that he know of only 2 guys who fish it specially for Perch. I hope to try the Lake out this year."

A nice 6 - 8 pound laker. Stuff it with wild rice and other goodies, put on the foil and then BBQ.In the middle of winter out at the cottage after a full day of fishing. At that very time hard to beat pike chowder. A couple of bowls of that and good night Irean.How about this ...Sunday afternoon at home in front of your fav football game with smoked trout and deer jurky and a nice cold beer."
