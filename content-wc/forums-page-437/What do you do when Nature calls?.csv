1438013,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-20 16:56:00,235,Has anyone ever stripped down and dove in the water to do a number two? We were far from the cabin once with no TP and I seriously considered this. Ended up toughing it out during a very difficult boat ride to the cabin.
1438086,Ranger319,2012-05-20 20:08:00,166,"So this happened to me....I mean a buddy of mine, yeah that's it!!...Out fishing and got the urge and I had NO time to get anywhere. Completely locked up, people everywhere. Long story short, the one and only time I ""fell"" overboard and did the deed. Man it was nice. So yes, I have considered this but we are always up in Canada in late May and the water temp is still a little cold. If the water was warmer I would have no problem doing a swim n chum."
1438087,v-bay gord,2012-05-20 20:09:00,3168,Please let this topic die............
1438094,v-bay gord,2012-05-20 20:15:00,3168,"You might want to consider ""before you next swim n chum"" that it might be someone else's drinking water."
1436766,Lovetofish,2012-05-17 08:50:00,458,Been taking my daughter since she was 6. Now she is 18. Not once has she asked to get to shore. My wife on the other hand is a complete different story.
1436773,hoosiercanadian,2012-05-17 09:00:00,104,"I've been taking my 4 daughters to Canada since they were baby's, now they are 30, 24, 22, and 14. I got them trained early, that when out on the lake the only place to go to the bathroom is in the bush ! So usually the biggest problem is finding a suitable place to pull the boat into, like a sand beach, or a rock point that shelfs off gently into the water, so it's not too difficult to get out. Sometimes, depending on the lake, finding a good place to get out can be a challenge. They really had less problems using the bush than they do using some of the outhouses that we have encountered."
1437005,downriverbob,2012-05-17 19:36:00,880,"Bought one the Luggable Loos when my wife started fishing with me about 15 years ago. Always stays in the boat until it goes in storage, then it get's used for ice fishing! BOB"
1437024,3M TA3,2012-05-17 20:19:00,2846,Depends
1437040,v-bay gord,2012-05-17 20:34:00,3168,"Use the shoreline like all the other critters do. A bucket in the boat? That would be the last time you came with me! Of course, teenage girls......you have my sympathy!"
1437285,fishinnut 3446,2012-05-18 12:13:00,638,"With all of use using the Island's and shoreline's,I'm going to start watching where i'm walking from now on."
1437310,LOW1,2012-05-18 13:36:00,2828,"Generally I take it as a sign from above that I have fished enough for the day, go back to the cabin, do what needs to be done in a real bathroom, and then take a nap."
1437313,jfsh,2012-05-18 13:40:00,13,"Medical conditions sometimes make it difficult to plan ahead when nature calls so I put together the equivalent of the luggable loo......bucket has a threaded cover, snap on seat, user wears a poncho for privacy. I think its called field expediency!"
1437386,JOE WALLEYE,2012-05-18 16:03:00,753,now thats funny!!!
1437499,Hawkfan,2012-05-18 21:49:00,237,"LOL...Thats what I was thinking too. I guess we have always headed toward shore when taking a seat in the office was needed. I did see a portable seat that is just a seat with no bottom, though. That thing looks handy! And we always make sure to use the camping TP and they even make camping wipes. Be prepared."
1436597,fishinnut 3446,2012-05-16 21:59:00,638,"Bozo,Just be careful which island's,I've seen some on Eagle that looked like a poison ivy forest Depend's who's in the boat my daughter use to pee in the splash well,now we have those little red hand held urinal's with the female adapter thingy.For me it's over the side or beach the boat grab the tp and run."
1436623,oilguy,2012-05-17 01:06:00,257,A livewell is another option for #1 for the women. My brother's little girl is 6 and she gets a kick out of using the livewell for her potty.Just don't add fish
1436635,Shellback,2012-05-17 05:13:00,8083,I believe some folks also carry a poncho which women can put on for privacy when using a bucket or pot.
1436641,Hawker,2012-05-17 05:42:00,3967,"+1 for the poncho! I carry a large poncho that the ladies (even some gentlemen) can use when out on the lake along with TP, package of baby wipes, soap and small trash bags. I've got one of the portable bucket potties from Cabelas (http://www.cabelas.com/product/Lugga...h-All+Products) and everything stores in the bucket and out of the way until needed! Sure saves on trips to the shoreline/islands and bugs!"
1436647,deputy dog,2012-05-17 05:55:00,305,"Baby wipes, baby wipes, baby wipes.....we use them at camp and have a stash in the boat as well....good for that ""final wipe"""
1436656,reelobsession,2012-05-17 06:15:00,40,I also carry some hand sanitizer to clean hands. Also serves double duty to wash hands before eating and at the end of the fishing day.
1436668,Iowa Farm Boy,2012-05-17 06:38:00,44,Luggable Loo. It is a five gallon pail with a detachable toilet seat with cover.
1436697,@Lunker,2012-05-17 07:30:00,835,"X3 on the baby wipes. Doesn't take long to develop ""red a$$"" after eating camp food for a few days."
1436755,Guest,2012-05-17 08:33:00,0,Immodium AD takes care of #2 issues. Stops you up. For #1 use a gallon ice cream pail for the ladies. On Lac Suel you should be able to find plenty of privacy.
1436760,ohiojmj,2012-05-17 08:43:00,1262,"5 gal bucket with seat, lean over side gunwale, or the multi-purpose minnow bucket (add water first!!). There are various options for dropping the chalupa which may or may not require EPA superfunding."
1436458,Bozotheclown,2012-05-16 18:02:00,15,"I want to thank everyone on this board...great info.I will be traveling to Eagle Lake for the first time in August.I will be taking my 13 year old daughter.Yesterday,my daughter asked me,""what do we dowhen we have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the lake?""At first I laughed but then I thought what is the correct method to relieve yourself on Eagle Lake.Please advise!!!!!!!"
1436472,maddogg,2012-05-16 18:29:00,178,Empty ice cream pail or find an island.TP never leave home without it.
1436475,phishfearme,2012-05-16 18:36:00,1242,"keeping a small trowel or some other small digging device helps also - dig a hole, do your duty and get the helll out before the mosquitos produce icthy spots where you don't wnat them. phish"
1436478,NARDA 1,2012-05-16 18:45:00,636,Head for an island.
1436485,J-Man,2012-05-16 19:03:00,191,"If you head for an island make sure you watch your step before getting out of the boat.You might (and trust me on this because I KNOW) put your foot down on a big ole snapping turtle sunning itself on a rock. Not so good. Especially when it's at ""5 alarm"" stage of urgency and it takes the boat captain at least 5 mins to stop laughing hysterically before he can try to pilot the vessel to a new ""landing"" area."
1436493,wallydave,2012-05-16 19:18:00,2151,"If its number one, we used to call it ""chuming for walleye""! Now we have a couple of kids and a wife in the group, so I got some urinals from a medical supply store for more ""dignified"" approach. Number two take care of business before we hit the lake. But after some beer and fried fish, sometimes nature calls, then the options are what ever it takes!!"
1436496,hommer23,2012-05-16 19:23:00,523,Take a 5 gallon bucket (with lid) with you and a blanket or beach towel for privacy then when you get back to the launch dump it in the toliet. You will want a lid that is water tight and you can even get a seat that fits on them so either of you can sit down if the waters rough.
1436556,Terwalleye,2012-05-16 20:49:00,166,I actually bought something for when my daughter joined the group a few years back. Cabelas sold it. It was called the boat buddy or something corny like that. Basically a 5 gallon pail with a built in seat.
1436564,kliph,2012-05-16 21:05:00,2337,Five gallon pail AND a plastic bag and TP and soap.
1436568,bobo4030,2012-05-16 21:10:00,235,Good call on e plastic bag.
