1434585,Rgate,2012-05-12 20:46:00,14,July - for big walleyes and lots of them on the reefs eating crayfish.
1434668,Campcountry,2012-05-13 07:10:00,164,I agree with July although this year with the early spring it may be June.
1437924,Manitou,2012-05-20 11:21:00,125,I've seen some pretty hot action in the middle of June.In the fall you are often battling the elements and I find the fish more fussy.

1432501,rpieske,2012-05-08 10:48:00,1276,Opener has always seemed like the best time for me; especially over toward Oak Island and the Northwest Angle.
1433157,Obabikon,2012-05-09 12:47:00,2370,"This is an easy one. No doubt it's fall... mid september on, you can catch a ton of walleyes. They won't be as big as the ones you catch in the spring, but numbers will be close to double if you try."
1433227,jimirjr,2012-05-09 14:54:00,1149,I will STRONGLY SECOND that opinion.... can't wait till this Sept!
1433421,steve.a,2012-05-10 05:15:00,274,How late in October do you normaly fish open water?
1433474,Obabikon,2012-05-10 07:20:00,2370,"The standard that people usually go by for ice off is May 1 - November 1 Leaving in mid-October, I've never seen ice on the lake in the fall. Ice isn't usually safe until mid-late december."
1434321,birddogger,2012-05-11 20:41:00,43,"Obabkion, what type of structure are you looking for when fishing for big walleye in the spring?"
1434326,Retired GB Guy,2012-05-11 21:20:00,25,"The week before I get there, or the week after I leave!!"
1434417,Rich B,2012-05-12 08:19:00,1081,True Story (ha) !!
1434438,fishanytime,2012-05-12 09:37:00,63,I agree middle of September to middle of Oct. can be really good. Also middle of June to the end of June you can find lots of walleyes just off of the weed lines. Fishanytime
