1437203,jsmyers,2012-05-18 08:57:00,198,"For fish of size, last May my best lure was the large size in Rapala X-Rap Subwalk. I also used a glidin rap for a bit until it was lost early in the trip. I almost lost track of the number of fish I caught during the week over 30"", most on that lure. (Note that most of them were in the lower 30s, but I did get one really fat 37"" fish).Pic: http://www.esoxhunter.com/upload/jsmyers_Fat.jpgFrom now on, a slow sinking jerkbait is probably my first choice for pike. It is a lot of fun to work. I wish they made a midsized subwalk.http://www.rapala.com/X-Rap-SubWalk/...d=rapala-luresThe 6"" 2 oz version worked well, but it was a bit scary to cast sometimes. I ended up loosing that one near the end of my trip when I lent it out. My friend had a backlash on his cast... The 3.5"" 5/8 oz version worked ok, but was a bit small, and I found it harder to work correctly. One about 1.25-1.5 oz might be a good compromise.I think it is a good plan to have some deadbait ready at all times in the boat too. I frozen cisco on a quick strike rig or a circle hook will catch any pike you put in front of. Have one get off? Throw some meat! Miss a strike? Throw some meat! I got my second largest pike (slim 37"") on that trip like that. I had missed the fish twice using small minnows under a slip bobber for walleyes. Couldn't get the small hook to set in the boney jaw with a ML moderate action rod. The second time I played the fish from one side of the boat to the other before the hook pulled out. I dropped a more substantial rig on in the same spot a few minutes later, and she ate again.Pic: http://www.esoxhunter.com/upload/jsmyers_37.JPGLast spring, when targeting smaller pike, I used an old Eppinger spoon that was basically a clone of a little cleo. I think it is a Devil Dog Junior. It was my grandfather's. I don't know what it's original finish was, but it is a pearly metal now. Probably weighs 1/3 oz. I would cast it around shallow rocks and wood cover (weren't many weeds yet). If I felt a bump or missed a strike, I would let it flutter down, and usually end up with a fish. There were a few hours where I'm sure I landed 20 pike under 25"" on that lure.Later in the summer, A mepps #5 is hard to beat, but it works well any time. The two biggest pike our group got last year (38"" and 39"") came on the same copper mepps #5. One was trolled slow through the middle of a bay in the morning, the other was cast near an inlet in another bay in the afternoon.Here is a trip report I wrote up on the Esox Hunter forum shortly after the trip (I realize that a few details I wrote above aren't exact. After a year, memories shift a bit): http://www.esoxhunter.com/phpBB2/vie...php?f=6&t=1427"

I brought a few musky soft plastics like smalll Bulldogs and Swimmin Joes. They went crazy for these things! I brought 5-6 of them and they were junk in 3 days. The fishing up there is unbelievable so it really doesn't matter what you throw. But if the fish are negative, try big soft plastics!If they are on the feed....big silver minnows in gold or silver and Lindy Cyclops spoons always work! I prefer baits with one hook. Easier on the fish."
1437232,JDMN,2012-05-18 10:27:00,34,#14 Husky Jerk is the one pike lure I wouldn't leave home without. If the fish were more relating to weeks then I would probably say a silver minnow or a 1oz spinnerbait.

1432291,4Paulie7,2012-05-08 04:00:00,30,"A few years back, we stopped at a tackle shop just before crossing the border to pick up a few odds and ends. I noticed a solitary red and white spoon on a pegboard display that I'd never seen before. It was the last one available. I bought it. After a couple of days of washing every lure in my bag with only moderate success, I remembered that I had this spoon buried in one of my boxes. Needless to say, it began a series of big hookups and has since become my ""go-to"" lure for northerns. It's called a KB Spoon that's manufactured by the same company that produces the Doctor Spoon. They don't seem to be as available as the Doctor Spoon and I now order them directly. You will find them online. For some reason, the paint job on the KB (similar to the Doctor) does not hold up well and the toothy critters will chip it off as the strikes keep coming. For this reason, I will bring three or four with me to Canada. It's an old spoon style that's been around for years and, for whatever reason, it works. I haven't tried any other colors. The R&W seems to work under all conditions so far. If you can find one or two hanging around, I would definitely suggest including it in your arsenal."
1432888,Beagle_Nut,2012-05-09 06:44:00,52,"We've been coming up for about 10 years, always the end of September, mostly LOTW or nearby, and target nothing but northerns. I'd say the Johsnon Silver Minnow in silver with a white tail has produced more fish than any other for us, but second would be either the 3/4 oz little cleo or the Big Dr. spoon, in either silver or gold.One lure I haven't seen mentioned yet would be the biggest Rattle-Trap you can find in silver / blue or silver / anything, but you better have some long needle-nose because the fish tend to inhale them.Last year we used the big Glidin Raps for the first time and they seemed to work well in calm water when other lures cooled off, the pearl / blue color did best for us. Real easy to throw and work for a big lure too."

Not that I disgaree, in fact, while I don't often target pike, last year our walleye fishing was slow so we did target them. I put on my one and only Johnson and had a ball. When I got home I order 6 more, and this year I'll be spending more time piking than before. I not only like the action, but it can be fished steady retrieve or let it flutter on the fall. It can be fished with or without a tail, and I really like the single hook for obvious reasons. Guess everyone else feels the same, but wondering if any of you have hooked up with muskies using these? Generally i've heard muskies aren't big with spoons, yet i know the biggest one we ever took years ago, over 50"", was on a large silver redeye."
1433162,Guest,2012-05-09 12:54:00,0,thats the same design as an antique. it was called the fish trap. for some reason i think they are illegal. i thought it had something to do with hooking fish really deep down the throat on a very high percentage of the time. i could be wrong about the illegal part
1431740,Mike7759,2012-05-07 06:40:00,641,It takes about 9.5 years for a Northern to reach 40 inches unless it is a stunted lake which has too much spawning habitat and not enough forage.

Caught a musky on one the other day. It has been the best producer hands down this year. Also been catching a lot on a clown husky jerk.
1431865,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-07 10:23:00,1460,"Like any lure that I pull outta my box, it depends on certain conditions and variables on the lake. I don't think that like walleyes, pike will let ya know what colors, shape and vibration they want. I feel it is more of a factor of finding them at the depths they are currently happy in. If ya find where they are, you can catch them. With that said: If I'm patrolling and casting weed edges in backbays, I prefer Johnson Silver Minnnow or Daredevil. I don't understand why pike love the 5 of diamond pattern, but they do. Lower light conditions, I will throw spoons painted in super glow in perch pattern. Often times as I am runnin the motor, I will troll a jig with swimbait so I can keep the boat better positioned for whoever I have casting off the bow. If I'm only catching hammer handles, I'll fish the bay points and dropoffs just off the bay lookin for the big girls. I have a favorite spot on my lake that has a small creek inlet feeding in to the bay. There are big trees on both sides of the inlet and very shallow water leading off of it. Way to shallow to throw spoons. I've learned my lesson here because as as soon as you are snagged, it's all over. I've got two different favorites for this tiny little spot. The Watson Wrat is a floating rat that is very fun to fish with. I try to pop it right in the inlet and twitch it out. Lot of fun when a pike of any size take it. The other is a handcarved Baby Loon. Pretty much fish it the same way and enjoy catching pike on topwater laughing my arse off catching fish on a baby loon. Still need a baby duck. Now, with all that said, I've had most of my large pike success fishing in the walleye hole. Lots of fun."

1431382,5 of Diamonds,2012-05-06 08:56:00,151,"We usually always use braided line w/ steel leaders too boot w/ our spoons however sheet happens:1) We get a lure tight that we can't retrieve from bottom structure. This is where we lose the majority of lures in general.2) Leader or line breakage during landing. This usually occurs @ the boat when all we're trying to do is realease the fish by grabbing the lure (barbless hook) w/ hookouts or pliars and we compromise the snap on the leader or catch the line itself.3) Certain fish will make runs under your boat. Those Lund SSV's are all metal and very unforgiving on your line.4) We've had motors that we were not able to remove the entire unit out of the water due too oversize prop guards. During landing, this situation becomes another line variable.5) For one reason or another you have line breakage. No explanation (although I believe this may occur from line abrasion from rocks during retrieving fish from longer distances).6) After significant use and catch, every once in awhile you just want to 'retire' one and have it rest in a special place on a wall or shelf.7) There is always one of group members who needs one or two. Groups flying in when we're flying out may not have any and we'll help them out.We fish almost entirely in remote Quebec. There are no stores around for 100's of miles. We'll cut back on our fluids (beer) but rarely the necessary tools of the trade. I personally make it a habit after each catch to run the first 3' of lie attached to my leader through my pinched fingers. Although more and more, I find that I'm visually inspecting the line as I can't feel where the line might be fraying as much as I can see it now.I simply have an old Plano 707 tackle box (2 drawer). The first drawer is made up of various crankbaits and the second drawer is for the spoons. Three of the spoons you mentioned above are always w/ me:1) The obvious one.2) Johnson Silver Minnow in 1 1/4 ounce.3) Williams Wabler (silver - I think it's about 4"" long).Hope this helps.

Putting a twister tail on a silver minnow to keep it from collecting weeds. (or anything 5 of diamonds says)3) I will add a lure thought. Although it is not my favorite pike lure, it is a slightly different choice and a multipurpose lure. It is a Storm Hot 'N Tot in the color of ""metallic rainbow."" In the tea-stained waters of the Gouin, it catches a lot of pike and walleye. It has the flash of a spoon(!) and dives deep. I like it around submerged rocks, rock drop-offs and walls, and while trolling. 4) I would like to put a vote in for the discontinued rapala weedless spoon (can still get on ebay?).

I've also caught Walleye, Lake Trout, Brook Trout, Dogfish, Whitefish and Sucker on it. 90% casting and the rest would have been trolling & jigging. Yes, jigging. These numbers come from over 30 fly-in trips in remote Quebec. I'll never have less than five of these in my tackle box when leaving for a trip.If given a second choice, I would go w/ a Kalin Lunker Grub (5"" white) on an Owner Jig (3/16th ounce).When catching these trophy size fish, please handle gently. Use a fish cradle (traditional fish nets put way too much stress on these big girls), single, barbless hook on your spoon, one barbless treble hook on your crankbait and having w/ in your reach, a 6""-9"" Baker hook-out will make things easier for all parties. Remember, only have these trophy fish out of the water as long as you could hold your own breath. This is your 'built-in timer' which helps minimize potential damage to the fish."
1431132,Mike Borger,2012-05-05 16:47:00,1554,Good lure no doubt. How do you fish heavy weeds with a non weedless spoon?
1431148,5 of Diamonds,2012-05-05 17:36:00,151,"Most of the trips are 1st and 2nd week of June or right after ice out. This timing has produced, shall I say, significant #'s. Obviously, the water temperature changes after ice out and the large Northerns become somewhat predictable w/ the long, sunny days.I don't usually fish too much in heavy weeds unless it it is a July trip. Then we'll work those weeded waters w/ buzzbaits (1/4, 3/8 and an occassional 1/2 ounce for those windy days). We'll work them on top of the vegetation and along the line. We'll also throw the spoons (5 of Diamonds, Johnson Silver Minnow and Silver Williams Wablers - much harder to control the accuracy of this lure due to it's shape). I enjoy buzzbait fishing more than any other method for Northerns. Unbeliveable.We've caught numerous other 40"" class fish on a simple white jig fishing for Walleye and have also caught these large Northers as we're landing Walleye. We are proud catch and release fishermen on these Northerns. You can't harvest these large fish and expect to continue to catch them year-in and year-out."

A 4"" or 6"" money minnow with a weighted swim bait hook is absolutely dynamite! Before swim baits were discovered, we were all believers of spinnerbaits, mepps in-line spinners, and Rapala husky jerks/x-raps. One downfall to money minnows is how quickly they get mangled (and you WILL get a ton of hits on this lure). But, just last year a guy in our group found a lure company called Z-mans, and it is made of a much more durable plastic that can catch big pike all day. I'm really surprised that not more people are talking about swim baits on this thread. If you haven't tried one lately, I highly suggest purchasing some as they are very versatile, and will likely become many of your new favorite pike baits.

I'm trying to stay within the weight limit and planned to bring like just one spoon each of about 7 different spoons ( dardevle, johnsons, Williams, Doctor, cyclops, lucky strike). You mentioned that you bring 5 of the same 5 of diamonds patterns. My thoughts were that the spoons are very durable and that you would only need 1 of each. What happens that you go through 5 spoons except for the paint wearing off. Typically we do more walleye fishing but this year we are going to a pike factory and I want to do the best at having the gear I need within the weight limit.

1430829,Walleye Wanderer,2012-05-04 19:23:00,101,"Agree on the Silver Minnow plus large silver/gold Williams Whitefish (single siwash) and new addition last year was the Pumpkinseed Live Target which boat several 40"" + Pike."
1430874,wallydave,2012-05-04 20:58:00,2151,My biggest pike have been caught while jigging for walleye! When I fish for pike I like spoons; silver; fire tiger. Red eyed warblers have worked well for me too. Walley divers for trolling and I have a few discontinued Rap minnow spoons that drive pike crazy!

1430896,Nosebleed,2012-05-04 22:06:00,253,"Well I have to say it depends on the conditions but I'll be brief....1. Big V bass spinners through the top of the weeds, big willow blade and 1-3oz size with a heavy wire and a closed loop for snaping on. Also a big trailer hook with Kalin 6"" grub is a must. You'll miss fish without the trailer. Hair or feathers stand up a lot better to teeth than the rubber skirts. This is a good one-http://www.overstockbait.com/Spinner_Bait_p/3msb.htm2. For spring Rapala Glide'n'rap. THis thing is dynomite! my last trip my boat of 3 were all killing it with this lure. the fish were lazy and would not even look at the flashy stuff. You must have stiff braid line and a stiff rod to work it correctly though. Hot olive is the best so far ( I've tried all the colors) Our boat also caught 3 walleyes on these while pike hunting, 28"",29"" and 31""! Nothing we could eat though3. 9"" Storm Dawg. I took some heat from my fishing partners for this thing when I first brought it out, but when I had 3 master anglers on it by the end of the week, I was the one smiling! Lots of action and versitile bait.4. Heavy spoons like a cop-e-cat or a crocodile, for casting windblown structure and casting in the wind/waves. When the lake turns on and fish are aggressive it's hard to beat'em. Cover a lot of water quickly and allow a lot of depth and speed variations. 5. Mepps 5's. I really don't like to throw them but they work well.6. Saltwater X-raps.... They cover water well and troll too."

1430904,Nosebleed,2012-05-04 22:25:00,253,"Congrats on the fish, I really hope you didn't kill that fish..... It took 25 years to get that big. I always wonder when I see the picture on land or on dock. The lake I go to does not allow anything over 40"" to be kept and it's helped the lake average a lot in the last 10 years."
1430670,justin99,2012-05-04 12:24:00,126,post up your favorite pike lure or two ha..I take a trip up north for one week every year do some trolling for lakers and cast for pike..I tend to do best with bright colored (yellow or orange) jointed rapala's but from what i hear through other people those are sometimes their last choice with spoons and spinners being top choices...what do you prefer to use and what colors???

1430730,nd89sc88,2012-05-04 14:25:00,92,"I got to admit, that I'm partial to bass-style spinnerbaits, although I like them a little bigger than for bass, and preferably with a closed loop in order to clip onto a steel leader. I like red/white skirts and silver blades, and I recently add a big white twister . . . Kalin Lunker grubs in 5"" length seem to be dynamite. Whenever I feel like I've lost touch with the mood of the fish, I clip one on and start throwing. I like them because the can be used as a topwater, bulging the surface of the water; a search lure, fan casted; trolled on either on a long line, or in the prop wash; and/or even buried deep in the weeds and slithered through . . . It always seems to help me get my mojo back when I'm struggling . . . Funny thing is that it not only works great on pike, and bass, but every now and then it nails me a big walleye. I've nabbed 2 walleyes over 26"" on spinnerbaits in the weeds during the height of summer, with very warm water temps. Always a treat and unexpected, but does make me wonder whether there's an emerging pattern there for big fish. Bill"
