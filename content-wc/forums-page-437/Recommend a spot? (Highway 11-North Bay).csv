1435155,onebaddude,2012-05-14 11:34:00,3,"Hey guys, After spending a few years out in Edmonton, then Toronto, I've recently moved to the North Bay area and am interested in getting out to do a little walleye fishing. I was wondering if anyone could recommend a few spots to try out? I'm looking for a place that is within a couple of hours of North Bay, preferably north (highway 11 or 63). I roof top my boat, so I need to be able to drive to the water. The smaller and more secluded the lake, the better for me. I'm equipped with a good map book for the area, so if you could throw some lake names out there that would be good to try, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks!"
1435229,jdoaks,2012-05-14 14:28:00,89,we go about 4 hours north resevoir decellas but there are so many lakes in between that if i had the time i would to try cant think of the names even though ive past them so many times
1435267,VINNYD,2012-05-14 15:41:00,81,you must be close to Lake Nippissing ? you got lots of choices around there
1435311,mcsteve,2012-05-14 17:25:00,13,Try these ones: Kipawa (across in Quebec) Harridge Lake Temagami Net lake All have great walleye populations and some good pike for larger action Good luck
1435409,onebaddude,2012-05-14 20:08:00,3,"Yeah, looking at maps, that's part of the ""problem""; too many lakes!Quote: Try these ones: Kipawa (across in Quebec) Harridge Lake Temagami Net lake Awesome. Thanks for the replies."
1437117,north560,2012-05-18 05:28:00,53,"If you want good fishing try Gowganda Lake, 3hrs north west of North Bay. Some of the guys were out for bass on Wednesday, caught a few nice pan size walleye, already scoped out where to get them come Saturday.Can't wait."
1437129,ohiojmj,2012-05-18 06:01:00,1262,"To be honest with you, if I was living near Northbay, I would stay away from places us Americans recommend. I have to believe that the lakes off the beaten path, perhaps even with a small ma and pa (non-internet ready) cottage camp would be a better bet than some of the popular lakes mentioned. You might consider asking the locals. Find some gravel roads which keeps the majority of the drive-to-lake fishing pressure way down. Although, a lake as big as Temigami, Tomisqam i(spelling?) near/in QC, Kipawa, or Lady Evelyn can't possbily be fished out, but big lakes and rooftop boats don't mix that well in the dependable afternoon breeze and chop. good luck man, wish I could live up there for a spell!"

Good luck!Quote: Originally Posted by ohiomjTo be honest with you, if I was living near Northbay, I would stay away from places us Americans recommend.Good tip. I assumed there'd be a few sneaky Ontarians lurking around that have fished the area"
