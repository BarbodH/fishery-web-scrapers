1437293,Painter1,2012-05-18 12:31:00,26,In 30 days we will be fishing Jeanette Lake on a fly-in out of Red lake. It has been 15 years since I fished Canada and we always went on Memorial Day weekend back then. This will be the first trip made that late in June. I would love to get opinions on what to expect. Will the Walleye & Pike be deep then or can we expect them to have the post-spawn blues like the Largemouth do down here at Tablerock? Thanks

I am personally a little concerned for the following reasons: 1) a very unusually warm winter and spring in Ontario... almost record high winter temperatures.... near record lows in snow and rain fall...Lake levels are low. We'll see the impact of this. But here in Southern Illinois we have seen some very unusual patterns due of the same conditions. As a result, fishing thus far has been very inconsistent...and down right terrible at times. 2) dry conditions in Ontario always leads to fires it seems. I don't want to think about it, but I remember getting all the way to International Falls one time...they wouldn't allow us to cross the border due to fires. Better be praying for some rain.Ice out is normally about now give or take a few days. Ice has been out over a month already in the Red Lake area. Walleye and pike should be well under way to transtioning to the main basin. I think you got to start to look for them at the mouths of the major bays...could be secondary locations inside the mouths a bit. But I would suggest starting there and work my way to key spots on the main basin. My guess is you are going to find walleye in both locations. But it's still early enough that they may not be schooled tightly like sometimes you can find them in July or August.You could find them in various depths. You can't rule anything out. But do anticipate a deeper bite than what you have experienced before during early season. Don't overlook 20' to 30' depths. At the same time don't rule out 10' or less. Pike? Wherever I catch walleye, the pike seem to be hanging around also. PM me for more specifics if you like. Be happy to discuss more.We are flying out of Red Lake early August."
1437447,RickOnt,2012-05-18 19:15:00,217,Winter here in the Great White North was definitely milder than normal. However Snow fall was about normal in areas to the North and West. Water levels should be about normal.BUT the Spring temps were above normal thruout Ontario and Ice Out was very early.So Water temps will be higher than usual and the Fish likely a little deeper.Rick
1437467,Terwalleye,2012-05-18 20:06:00,166,Our group went up the 3rd week in June the last two years. Two years ago also had the same early ice out and last year the ice melted a month later. Both yuears we caught oodles of fish. I actually preferred two years ago and am looking forward to this year; because we had such good luck fishing the weed beds. Last year they were not very devloped and hard to find.I think it will hve mor to do with how stained or clear the water is on your lake. We were catching walleyes in 8 ft of water all day long in the weeds two years ago.

1438066,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-20 19:23:00,235,"Painter1, I will be fishing Jeannette a couple weeks after you're there starting July 12. I have four previous trips to Jeannette mostly in late July/early August. We use the other outfitter who serves Jeannette out of the Ear Falls area. I suspect that with the early season that a full on mid summer pattern may be emerging when you are there. Focus on mid lake humps, particularly from 12-16 feet deep. Jeannette is a stained water lake so you will not likely catch a lot of walleyes much deeper than 20-22 feet at the most, or at least that has been our experience. If you are new to Jeannette or would like to share info, let me know in private message. Jeannette experienced major fires last season and Kabeelo's outpost burned down. We are staying in the new one they just built. I will be very interested i hearing about your results and hope you will post a report. have a great trip!"
