1437501,Hawkfan,2012-05-18 21:53:00,237,I was heading up I-35 in central Iowa today and just on the NE side of the Jewell exit I noticed a nice gathering of rock piles. Probably 4 or 5 good stacks sitting together. Couldn't help but think that person is about to head to Canada for their yearly trip.
1437530,Bill Krejca,2012-05-19 04:40:00,6107,"Yeah, it's kind of amazing how almost anything will remind you of the north woods when you have it in your blood. I like the way you think! The countdown continues! Bill Krejca"

1437728,Fishin Fun,2012-05-19 19:19:00,218,"Oh god. I can't tell you how many things have set me off the past month about heading to Canada. Everything from the weather, to smells, and of course reading Walleye Central every day. My wife must think I'm nuts. The wait continues...."
1437799,Cash,2012-05-20 05:30:00,73,I'm originally from Waterloo as well.
1437816,MorganMan,2012-05-20 06:26:00,341,"Hawkfan, you should consider increasing to two trips per year perhaps??"
1437875,Hawkfan,2012-05-20 09:11:00,237,"MorganMan, I know I have a brother that would make the second trip with me, but then all our wives would start pushing harder for that girls trip to Mexico. And I would want to be on that one too. I think I'd run out of vacation time at work...and maybe money in the bank!"
