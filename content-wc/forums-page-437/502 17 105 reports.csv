1437360,NARDA 1,2012-05-18 15:16:00,636,Have been taking the 502 for the past 20+ years and the only problem was 10 -12 years ago on the way home when two semi trucks had an accident totally blocking the road at about the halfway point. Ended up going back around to the 71 amd south. We got to the boarder about the time the 502 opened back up. What a long ride home that was.
