It is a fantastic lake for LOTS of smaller walleye,many in the 2-3lbs size. ""18 picks all day. It is a very shallow lake,lots of rocks. There is a narrows to the right of the cabin around the a point into a bay,tht we found was always amazings for casting jigs. Right beside these narrows is a weedbed full of pike. There is a good river, I believe NW inregards to the lake,and 2 39"" pike were pulled upstream there. I know the cabin has gone thru a complete rebuild which it def needed. Couple other great spots were direct across from the cabin in a couple of small bays tht had a bit of depth to them,again just cast jigs. There is another river leading to another small lake across from the cabin and tht lake produced the same size & quant of pickerel. Good luck"
