We want to go back to Canada fishing in a few weeks. I've heard/read that Canada has a new policy that will let you enter one time for free. We've checked the Canadian web site and it appears to be so, but it is unclear as to what you need to do to get across. He called Immigration and the actual border crossing we use, and they're clueless. We'd hate to drive 6 hours to the border and be denied. Has anyone tried to get across with a DUI under the new policy? Thanks in advance."

I would call back and speak with a supervisor. They would have gotten a lot of calls adout this so its hard to believe that someone there doesn't know what they would require. An earlier post here on WC is indicating that Canadian Customs may have retracted their ""one time"" policy."
