1437391,nd89sc88,2012-05-18 16:15:00,92,"I know the rules about fishing windblown shorelines and points when fish are shallow, but what affect does the wind have when you are fishing deeper, mid-lake structure? If you are fishing a mid-lake reef that tops out at 15 or 20 feet does the wind still impact fish location? To be more specific, does the wind impact which reefs will hold fish? And/or will it impact where the fish will hold on a particular reef? I always find fishing the wind challenging from a boat control standpoint, so I'm curious how important it is when I'm fishing mid-summer deep structure. I'm heading to Lac Seul for the first time ever over the week of the 4th and already poring over maps and thinking strategy . . . Thanks in advance for any thoughts, input and/or advice. Bill"
1437531,Bill Krejca,2012-05-19 04:53:00,6107,"I think the definite answer is...sometimes! Just like other ""spots"" that seem the same in most respects, some are just better than others. I don't believe I have ever found fish at all places that were windblown, rocky, flats to deep water, etc. It just seems like an obvious pattern to start at. I haven't been able to pick out patterns than are 100% productive, even when the conditions and structure seem to be pretty much identical to me. About all I do is try them and see what happens. Perhaps the day will come when the percentage gets closer to 100%, perhaps not. Probably not. Bill Krejca"
1437543,Pooch,2012-05-19 06:07:00,4619,"On occasion we have found that behind islands or points that strong wind will create a eddy of calm water that can be full of walleyes that appear to be following baitfish.Seems they are located right at the spot where the wind and the calm meet.Doesn't always happen, but when it does we have had some really - really hot fishing.Most of these little eddy spots are sterile, but worth looking at when scrounging for fish.I wouldn't pass up a chance to drift a reef if the wind is right. I think that if the wind is blowing over them I'd probably fish the back side first where the reef gets deeper or any of the edges. If there are any. If there is a rock pile or depression somewhere on a reef or hump that has worked for us. Pooch"
1437607,dan cardinal,2012-05-19 09:38:00,64,"I am with Bill K...there are going to be reefs better than others, but all main lake reefs topping out at 15 to 20 feet...I would trying them all...wind or no wind. But with wind conditions I would anticipate that walleye could be positioned right on top of the reef, and could be very active. Often I try to do a controlled back troll against the wind...more or less I am just holding position over top the reef( or the walleye). Use a marker bouy to mark your location...you will get blown away from it from time to time while landing fish...the marker helps to get back on the spot quick."
1437626,drlee,2012-05-19 10:37:00,409,"Dan and Pooch nailed it. Top of the reef, wind blown side, don't ignore the back side, and if the wind is driving you crazy those calm spots behind islands, etc. can be gold mines. I like to drift the reefs and use marker bouys, so I don't have as much experience with boat control issues."
1437689,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-19 16:29:00,298,"The thing to remember about LS is to expect the unexpected. My wife and I have fished LS for the last 15 years around the 1st of July and the last 4 years again in mid August. First of all the stained water changes a lot of things - fishing can be as good at noon as early or late. Try all depths as well as windy and calm areas. A few years ago we arrived at the resort and asked what depth had been best. Everybody said to fish at depths of 25'-30'. It was a very sunny, hot day with absolutely no wind. We were trying to hold at that 25'-30' depth while trolling around a point. I found out that the point extended out very shallow for several hundred yards and finally decided to cross it. When our spinners hit the shallow water we started to catch Walleyes. We absolutely killed em in 3'-10' of water. Go figure.Another year, in August, we found em along a weed line on a sandbar. Went back the next day and caught nothing. When we got home I read the Silver Water Wheel Resort fishing report for the week and Mike said the Eyes were shallow along the weeds for the first 3 days and then they were gone.You never know on LS, but that's what makes it so much fun and brings us back year after year."
1437764,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-19 21:03:00,235,"If the hump's shallowest spot is 20-25 feet, I doubt surface wind is a big factor. More important, I suspect, is the area where sand or muck transitions to rock. A guy in our Canada group did a lot recon with his underwater camera and found that almost invariably they were near that transition."
