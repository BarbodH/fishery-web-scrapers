4426377,turkeyriver,2016-01-05 07:33:00,80,"After reading some of Mike B.'s fishing reports, I've got a ?. How big do waves really have to get before you're in danger with a 14-16 foot fishing boat like most resorts offer for rent? I have a fear of big waves ever since a trip to the BWCA a few years ago when the wind came up and I had waves breaking over the front of the canoe, putting water on board. If not for a small island nearby, I don't know how that would have turned out. My buddy in the back of the canoe was one of the most experienced, fearless canoeists out there and even he admitted later he was shook up. Anyway, how scared have some of you been in a boat in Canada?"
4426473,Fisherman Ted,2016-01-05 07:57:00,461,Not an easy question to answer. The simple answer is if you do not have experience with working a boat on the water than any size waves/wind can potentially be dangerous. You could be driving a LUND Pro-V aircraft carrier but if you don't know what you are doing it is not safe. Especially as you get higher hp engines and get a boat on plane. Catch a wave wrong with just a 30 hp on the back and it's lights out. I have nearly lost my boat in relatively calm waters (2 foot breakers) when I caught a wave the wrong way and nearly lost the tiller.Look at the guys that died on LOW a few years ago when the guide lost control of the tiller and jack knifed the boat into a wall killing someone. He was experienced and that was an accident but it is still dangerous when you are dealing with high-powered equipment and water.First thing I did when I bought my lodge a few years ago was replace my 16 foot Lunds with 18 foot Crestliners primarily for safety. Guests hit a boat for a week a year and need all the help they can get. The 18s also are much more broad in the shoulders and just a more solid heavy boat. Because of this you are less likely to be at the mercy of the water as you can plow (albeit slowly) through heavier conditions. Much safer IMO.Personally anything over 4 feet even in bigger boats I take very seriously and will not let guests on the water unless I know they are safe or have a guide. 2-4 feet I drive according to conditions and not at full throttle. A new guest with a 50 hp motor on the back in 2 foot swells is not a good combination IMO and I make darned sure they know what they are doing before they leave the dock.-FT
4426489,BornToFish,2016-01-05 08:01:00,1224,"I am pretty sure that there is no simple answer to your question. It might just come down to whether you are unlucky or lucky that day. There is no doubt that the chances of a mishap go up with the size of waves, the type of waves (e.g. whitecaps versus rollers) and the distance between wave crests. Other factors come into play as well. For example, how heavy the boat is loaded in terms of equipment and people, how the weight is distributed in the boat, amount of fuel on board, boat speed, and how the boat motor is trimmed. Another example is the orientation of the boat to the waves: traveling with or into the waves, quartering or parallel to the waves. I believe the margin for ""error"" goes down as the size of the waves increases. I always take operating a boat in a serious manner, but do admit that I pay extra attention when the waves approach becoming whitecaps. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4426497,Bill Krejca,2016-01-05 08:03:00,6107,"Scared enough on a return from a camping trip on LOW that we made for an island to wait it out when we couldn't see the other 3 boats we were with, due to the size of the waves. Scared enough on a relatively small portage-into lake in Sask. that I had Dad and my son get down on the bottom of the 12 ft boat as the 4.5 hp motor churned to keep up with the speed of the waves. There are certain experiences you just never forget. Bill"
4426553,pjshorthorn,2016-01-05 08:26:00,5654,"We got caught out in a large open section of Lac Seul trying to beat a storm on the way back to camp. I was in the bow to try and keep the 16' Fiberglass Lund from porpoising too much as we fought through the waves. I got really wet and broke the wooden bow seat ( bench style ) in half with my backside as we were catching air once clearing the wave crest. Once we got back to camp, I swore I would not go back out the rest of the week......I did. I was 17 years old and the boat was older than myself. I would estimate the waves to be 4 footers. I've been in larger seas since, but albeit in much larger boats. I have an immense amount of respect for large lakes and oceans and I'm sure it started with that first experience when I was 17.PjShorthorn"
4426689,Guest,2016-01-05 09:06:00,0,"Ask your self this question, is there a fish that swims that is worth the risk of me or someone in the party drowning? NOT in this kids book, and I don't give in to pier pressure, you want to go out, I'll make sure we get your body back to the states, IF, we can find it!! Big waves are nothing to play with."
4426769,adempsey,2016-01-05 09:28:00,963,"I am a big wimp when it comes to rough water. I get quite anxious driving through big waves. I won't go out in a small fishing boat if the winds are over 19 km/h (12 mph, 10 knots), unless I have some protection from the wind. That being said, I've been caught in some rough conditions unexpectedly. One time, we were fishing behind some islands for a few hours and as we start to head back we get out into the main lake and into some really nasty conditions. That was an experience for sure, but luckily we weren't really that far from shore - although it sure seemed like it. I always check the weather forecast before I head out as best as I can, but we all know how accurate those are anyway. So, battling the waves is not always by choice."
4426865,fishron,2016-01-05 10:24:00,317,"There's always a chance that you be far down the lake and the weather will change and a wind will come up that you would not have gone out in.It's happened to me several times.Shouldn't have to say it, put your life jacket on. Always point the bow into the wind even though its not the fastest way back. On a large lake this may not be possible. My experiences have been on lakes where both shorelines were visible.Last June while fishing Hebert we were caught, five miles away from camp in wind an somewhere between two and three footers. We stayed too long because the bite was fantastic.It was a long, rough, wet ride back but we kept the bow into the wind, and although I loosened all my fillings, we made it back.Disaster can strike quickly if you don't keep the boat properly oriented. Never take a chance going out into nasty conditions even if it's the last day of the trip."
4427289,Obabikon,2016-01-05 12:08:00,2370,"It has much less to do with the boat, and more to do with the captain. Honestly, I feel very comfortable in a 16'-17' deep V with a 30 or 40 hp engine on the back. I can ride the waves and avoid rogue waves from putting me in danger. I'm much more comfortable in a skiff than I am say an 18' lund steering wheel in the same waves. ANSWER: It is dangerous if you feel it is dangerous. If you can't comfortably operate the boat, then its a dangerous situation for you to be in. If you have any doubt at all, just wait it out. There isn't anywhere you need to be that will justify putting your life in danger. People who are used to operating in some heavier waves, are much less likely to panic... or make bad decisions out there. My personal feelings is that I can handle 5 footers. I would NOT do that in a 14' boat though, and it has to be a deep V."
4510977,Wawajake,2016-02-03 10:35:00,413,"A few years back I was on Whitefish lake (near Wawa) in my 14 ft Aluminum boat with my 9.9 hp Merc. I had gone 7 miles ( heading North East ) up the lake during the morning and typically the afternoon wind would be from the north or from the west and worst case scenario you could ride the waves home. However that afternoon the wind came from the south west and right up the 8 mile length of the lake , and when I pulled out of my river inlet spot, the waves were already at three feet and in center were four foot whitecaps . There are no beaches on this rock and cliff lined lake and no cell coverage , and no cottages that far up the lake so you are on your own. So got the life jacket on , tied down the rods and the tackle box and minnow bucket , and started out by running the shoreline using the depth finder to keep me away from rocks as best I could and quartering the on coming waves where I had to , and using the shoreline points to reduce the wave size I was facing. The 7 mile trip ended up being probably twice as long so that I could be within swimming distance of shore in the worst spots . The 9.9 Merc prop was above the water as most wave crests taken . I also needed one stop in the rollers to add the spare jerry can of gas (there was a lot of spillage doing that!) Three hours later I was back to our cottage to a worried wife."
4511345,octanehi5,2016-02-03 11:49:00,1104,"It does not have to be big water, If you have a mile of open water in front of you it can roll 4 to 6' very easily. straight and slow into the wind will get you there, going fast will get you into trouble very quickly. Being on some type of land is much safer than being in a boat"
4433425,Bakefish,2016-01-07 14:48:00,1077,I know of where you speak. Something about that stretch of Wegg that's pretty treacherous if the wind is right. I went down to the south end of that area of Wegg on a north wind one time hoping to get some pike in the wind. Couldn't hold the boat still enough to fish and cursed myself the whole ride upwind toward Johnson.
4433841,vaquero01,2016-01-07 17:26:00,101,"I owned a 35' Carver on Lake Michigan. I have been afraid and it didn't take 6 footers. Per V-Bay Gord, slow down. Last year on Lac Seul it got pretty ruff, i'd say true 2.5 to 3 from Onaway on the way to MacKenzie and I was in a Alumacraft 185 Competitor wheel boat. Wasn't bad going out, but there was no where to fish as the wind had us. Wife, Labrador and I decided to return towards Onaway. Had to slow down to about 8 miles an hour before I felt TOTALLY safe. Saw fisherman from Onaway trying to join up with their buddies towards MacKenzie. Never had seen a boat with the bow so high and so low and moving so fast. It had to hurt. Remember, small craft warnings are for anything under 65 foot long!"
4495258,Admiral Cain,2016-01-28 16:42:00,15,"For a few years we would take my 18 foot Sylvan to Sturgeon Lake to catch Lakers. A breeze on Sturgeon produces 3 footers. Blue Bird skies turned quickly, and 5 foot rollers were everywhere. Once lines were in, I instructed my team to get low, hunker down, and swim west (THAT WAY) if into the water. At the tiller, I would ride the crest of a wave as long as I could, then catch the next. This was great, as long as the waves were going the direction as your camp. Many occasions, I would have to travel away from camp, in order to ultimately get to camp. Always respected the power of that Lake. Always read the forecast, but some times, Mother Nature lets you know who is Boss. Sturgeon Lake Ontario, Many Trophy Lake Trout Boated, many scary Mother Nature Moments! Tight Lines! Admiral"
4496370,last chance,2016-01-29 06:07:00,3262,"wasn't In Canada but on lake erie for our 1st time in a 16' tri hull open bow. the waves started getting a little rough so we pulled behind west sister island and continued to fish. once we had our limit we pulled out to meet good (or bad) 7 footers head on. my friend who owned the boat was sinking us. I told him he had to do something or we would never make it to shore. he told me to drive and see if I could do better. I had it in my mind if I couldn't do something I was going back behind the island and beach her. I started turning the right corner into the wave then steer hard right and hit the next wave with the left corner. this started working much better than just being a big dipper hitting the waves head on. by dipping water and running the sump pump full time we got the water down below deck where the pump kept it pumped out. but I was scared very bad and so were my fishing buddies. we had 9 miles to go to our inlet and it took us over 2 hrs to reach shore. that was the 1st and last trip that boat went to erie. we did still do a lot of fishing from 16' deep v closed bow boats, but we always checked and watched the weather before going out. later I upgraded to an 18' Cherokee aluminum boat and felt a little safer. but i'll never forget just how lucky we were to have survived our 1st trip to erie."
4496434,East coast,2016-01-29 07:01:00,32,"We love fishing the Gouin Reservoir in Quebec just after ice out in late May. I would add that my tolerance for big waves goes down with water temperature. Swamping a boat is one thing, swamping in 40 degree water is another. 2 Trips come to mind: The first was seeing a strong cold front move in a few miles from camp. We decided to head back and were hitting 4 footers head on in a 16 foot aluminum boat. I was riding up front and we had a cooler we used as a live well. I was airborne, so were the fish and water throwing the cooler open every time we launched the crest and drove the bow into the face of the next big wave. Finished the trip sitting on the floor of the boat. Even the flat beer from the boat tasted good that day when we got back to the camp. Second trip was same location in the Gouin. We got caught crossing a large stretch where wind funnelled from multiple directions helped by the unique geography of the reservoir. 5 foot rollers that come from multiple directions and colliding made for one heck of a trip. Waves breaking over the bow, the sides and the back of the boat if you couldn't keep up with them made for one scary ride. We go back every year, we just pay a little more attention to our direction of travel and changes in wind direction. To survive you almost have to be your own meteorologist."
4496514,bigwalleye1,2016-01-29 07:32:00,2632,"My two rules for big waves, and my home water is Mille Lacs: 1. Generally, the boat will handle bigger waves than you will. 2. In a storm, any beach is a good beach, especially if lightning is involved. Go out into it? Heck no. Sometimes though, you find yourself in it or you weren't watching the conditions. In that case, discretion is ALWAYS the better part of valor."
4497290,camp chef,2016-01-29 11:26:00,915,We had a similar scenario in Chequamegon Bay on Lake Superior in a 16 ft Ouachita trihull. When we got to shore the boat was full of water and sitting on the bottom.. Never again in a fiberglass tri hull
4497402,97roughneck,2016-01-29 12:36:00,899,"If you fish the Mighty Missouri River in SD, you soon learn to handle big water and big waves or you won't fish very much. Having said that, I've been a passenger in 4-5' waves and I wanted to (I didn't) lie down in the bottom of the boat. I've been the captain of my own boat (17') in probably 3' seas and that was my comfort level. I can tell you I would NEVER be on the river in a boat less than 17', unless I was fishing in the bay and the boat ramp was in sight."
4497458,Coyoteman,2016-01-29 13:08:00,209,That's the truth. We have hauled in several people over the years that had no business going out on oahe.
4497786,Old Timer,2016-01-29 15:27:00,255,"The biggest mistake is to risk your life and that of your buddy by trying to navigate water that is beyond your expertise or the capability of the boat.With the Internet you can get a fairly accurate weather forecast. If tomorrow is the last day of my trip and I get a report of high winds or nasty storms, I'll pack up and head for home. I don't worry about ""leaving money on the table"". It was gone anyway and I'd rather be on the road than playing cards in the cabin.If the weather comes in the middle of the trip, that presents a different problem. I try to guard against it by picking camps that have protected fishing water nearby and, hopefully, a good place to read a book and watch TV. Your options are fewer if you're stuck in a fly-in outpost. There, you just stick it out, get bored and hope for better weather to come quickly. Once at the outpost, it's almost impossible to bail out early.If you're willing to fish in September, you can follow the weather and make a call to any number of camps and find an opening right then. Mid to late September has worked well for me the last several years and the last three I've been the only fisherman in camp. No reservations or deposit required. Of course, you must have some work and family flexibility to make this program work."
4427345,wallydave,2016-01-05 12:28:00,2151,If you fish big water you will run into some big waves. An average week in Ontario will be a couple nice days a couple windy rainy days and a day ot two of strong winds. After fishing Lac Seul for many years a early July trip was probably the week with the most wind and big waves. A couple of days we would start with calm flat water then the day would warm up and the waves would get rough. Fishing in some sheltered waters we could hear the thud thud of boats hitting the waves. Finally some boats started to head for home we followed in their wake until we saw a smaller boat trying to keep up with our Goose Bay Lund outfitter with a 50 horse Yamaha. We slowed down so they could follow our wake. As noted knowing how to control the boat in wind and rough water is the key.
4427465,Pooch,2016-01-05 13:20:00,4619,"The most tense ride for me came three years ago headed back to Goose Bay Camp on Lac Seul from a morning in McKenzie Bay. Saw it getting dark in the west so immediately headed back to camp. Made it to Steamboat Bay and hit (later reported to be forty mph winds) rough water and things were quickly deteriorating. Luck was with us as we had to go NW up the bay and the wind was blowing down the bay directly into us. I'm guessing the waves at four foot and turning into rollers. We just kept moving as turning for shore would have most likely swamped us or rolled us over. Could not see shore anyway because of blowing rain and wave spray. No choice but to solder on. Patience and just finding a spreed to match the rollers got us safely to Steamboat Narrows to set out the worst of it.Wind and the distance between swells is what puckers me up.My boat is an older Lund 16foot tiller Rebel with a forty four stroke Yamaha. I felt pretty good about the boats ability to handle that water, but would still like to add two foot when the opportunity presents itself.Respect for any water? You betcha!Pooch"
4427577,v-bay gord,2016-01-05 13:39:00,3168,"A few observations about rough water based on watching fishermen for many years.......Pay attention to the wind direction and plan your travel route accordingly. More often than not I see folk head to the roughest section of the lake because they don't factor in wind direction.The reason they put a throttle on the motor is so you can slow down in poor conditions. More often than not I see novice drivers running wide open in rough water and then arriving shook up and soaked. Let the conditions determine your speed.9 out of 10 times if you wait in a sheltered location the worse of conditions will pass.....especially as evening approaches. There's no dinner, or cocktail hour worth your life making it necessary to ""get back"". Bottom line, is use some common sense. Check out the weather forecast and plan your day accordingly. Wear your pfd....at least while travelling. When in doubt, wait it out."
4427729,bigdaddyguns,2016-01-05 14:48:00,608,Purely from a boat perspective the old 14' with low freeboard and narrow beam become a challenge with 1.5'+ waves. As the boat length increase to 16' with more freeboard and beam I estimate 2-2.5' waves are tolerable. 18' and beyond you get into the 3'+ wave category. These are generalizations from my 30+ years of driving various boat sizes in waters from NWO to the Great Lakes. As others have pointed out with their sage advice and experiences there is a lot more to consider in the safety equation. I'm giving some quick rules of thumb for my expectations on seas to boat size before I would venture out on to a body of water.
4427769,Mike Borger,2016-01-05 15:09:00,1554,Nice to see I put the fear of God in you. I have been on a very large number of trips to some pretty remote bodies of water. In the vast majority of the cases there is always islands and such that you can tuck in behind. When it gets rough just slow down and take your time. There is very little danger if care and caution are used.I can count on one hand the number of times I've been caught in wide open wind swept waters and actually felt unsafe in a small boat.

Nothing will compare to a trip we endured on Lake Minnitaki about 12 years ago. 14 foot aluminum boat with a 40 horse tiller that was more like 15 or 20 horse by its performance. Took about 45 minutes to make a 13 mile boat ride to the English River over glass. Well, a storm whipped up and we looked down at the mouth of the river seeing whitecaps hammering in. Not good. It was slow going and I was in the front of the boat getting slammed up and down going over 4 foot whitecaps. We got to the big open part of the lake, and it was insane. We made our way to an island and waited it out before continuing our trek back. Totally stupid to even try and go back. We were in a remote cabin. No internet, cell service, TV, nothing. We had no idea what the weather was going to do. Learned quite a few lessons that day. No life jacket either. Stupid."

I immediately prepared myself for the ride straight South to Bostic Crk & Morris Pt. gap. 2&1/2 hrs later I was inside the gap.

We put on our life jackets & headed out around the point to get back to camp & their was already 2 boats stuck on the point trying to get back. They were in smaller boats & weren't picked up until about 5:00 when it died down. We made it back to camp & some young kid took our boat across the lake to a more secluded area with the bow standing in the air all the way. We had to sort out all the tackle boxes the next morning.
