4504905,deputy dog,2016-02-01 13:49:00,305,looking for some recent info regarding this outfitter. a group of my buddies are thinking about heading there this summer and I told him I would reach out for some advice from anyone here that used them. I did a search but couldn't find anything recent. thanks in advance!!
4505041,adempsey,2016-02-01 15:03:00,963,"We went June/July 2011 for a week on the Housekeeping plan. At the time the rates were great for what you got. The accommodations were nice and the boats were top notch. I am not sure if ownership has changed hands since the, but I seem to recall it was sold a couple years back.The fishing for us was mediocre. However, I only blame ourselves and how we approached it. We wasted way too much exploring Hardiman Bay, which is very narrow and deep. Not to mention we didn't really know how to fish it properly. I think if we had gone down to the main part of the lake, we would have done much better. I have seen several reports of some nice Walleye coming out of the lake. One was from Horwood Lake Outposts, so you could do a search for that. I've always wanted to return for some vindication! Also, you'll never forget dodging the flotilla of felled logs every morning and evening as well.Of course, the fishing isn't going to be like a fly-in lake, but still fairly decent for a drive-in lodge. I'd say it's probably close to fishing Lake Windermere."
4508537,Matt.G,2016-02-02 16:50:00,4,Yes the lodge was sold a few years ago. The new owner did a bunch of work to the place. I live near by and fish horwood a lot. Horwood is probably the best drive to lake we have in northeastern Ontario. Hardiman bay is a great place to fish mid summer and the main lake is better in spring. I also guide on the lake and a few other lakes and horwood will give you the best chance for a hog with a lot of fish in the 16- 22 inch range.
4512377,deputy dog,2016-02-03 16:17:00,305,"Thanks for the info guys...Matt, have you been hearing good things about the new owners? I've read a few things about the logs that float up in the am and pm, is this something to be concerned about? Thanks again for the replies!!"
4513713,Tayzak15,2016-02-03 22:50:00,48,"I also live in the area and spend a lot of time on that lake, and do a little bit of guiding. Like Matt G said the main lake is better during spring/early summer, Hardiman bay is better in mid/late summer into fall but we typically head back into the lake in fall up until the boat gets put away. The logs are definitely a concern early in the season you will absolutely need to keep your eyes open for them, but as the summer moves on and the water drops a bit it isn't as bad. There are certainly floaters out there year round, but nowhere near as bad as they are early in the season. Unfortunately I can't help you out too much with info regarding the lodge as I have never stayed there, but I can tell you the fishing is the best drive to lake in this area! Here are some pictures of a few eyes we pulled up out of Horwood last season."
4515281,Matt.G,2016-02-04 13:46:00,4,It is a resivoiur so You do get a lot of floating logs on the calm mornings. Just take your time and you will be fine. I never heard anything bad about the lodge. There is also horwood lake outpost and big bear camp on horwood lake. All 3 have there advantages and disadvantages but you won't go wrong with any of them.
4516425,Jaskonie,2016-02-04 18:44:00,80,"We fished it July 2011 the fishing was so so, we did well in numbers of small fish closer to the lodge but found bigger fish down at the mouth of Hardiman and the main lake, used bouncers and harnesses over the sand flat. Horwood lake lodge at the time was tight lipped on spots unless you paid for a guide. We found a sunken island in hardiman that had great number of 16 to 18 inch fish just a few miles from the lodge. The food was great there as Billy the local cook and guide is the life blood of the camp. I dont know if he is still there. It was worth the money for us but we have moved on to other things."
4523761,Joek3,2016-02-07 10:27:00,244,"Went to Horwood lake 2 years ago. Have fished 6 different lakes in Canada and this would be the last of the lakes we would return to. Walleye fishing is average and lake pressure is high. There are also many lake homes so recreational boaters are there. (This might be ok for you, but not why we go to Canada ). Perch fishing is below average but the few we caught were monsters. (12-14 inches). Logs were a problem and we hit one totally submerged. If you do go, make the 30 minute run all the way up the river where the 2 falls come in. Good fishing there but also a beautiful setting."
4528225,Matt.G,2016-02-08 16:38:00,4,Joek3. Yes I agree horwood lake isn't the best lake in the world but from our drive to lakes in northeastern Ontario it is one of the best. Yes there is a lot of cottages on the lake but fishing pressure is very little. And horwood is a great choice for a low price drive to location not to many lakes can beat. I fish a lot in the Timmins area and if I had to pick one lake to fish for the rest of my life in my area it would be horwood and I'm sure tayzak15 would agree. But if I had a choice to fish I would pick lake of the woods best walleye fishing in the world
