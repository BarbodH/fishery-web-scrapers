Did you know the mud flat was there, or did your electronics tell you it was mud? (It's a selfish question, as I finally relented and bought a decent Lowrance Chirp fish finder after having relied on my 15-year-old cheapie, pixelated depth finder, that couldn't be relied upon for marking fish, . Trying to learn the nuances of really using electronics.) Thanks!"
4497146,doubleheader,2016-01-29 10:46:00,2652,"Well, this is embarrassing but I'm going to tell you the exact truth. We always get together with the couple we share a cottage with and tie harnesses before our trip. The water is tannin stained and bright colors usually are the best producers, but this particular year the girls made some gosh awful gaudy harnesses. Typically we would fish around islands and usually try to stay in that magic 8' where the weeds are sporadic yet manageable. Anyhow, it was the couple we were with that ventured into the deep flat and the attached pic shows two of the fish my friend's wife kept that 1st fateful morning. She caught them on what she called her Christmas tree design which I had been teasing her about saying no walleye with any self respect would ever fall for that. After that it was like being all in on a poker game and winning every hand. I kept waiting for the bite to shut down but it never did. At one of the lodges we stopped to see, the owner told us 3 guys from California had just left after fishing 4 days with a local indian guide with no fish. He was shocked at our pics. We were literally trolling with a rock throw of their main lodge. We fish that flat every year to this day, and we get a few nice fish but nothing like that year. As for graphing them, yes, I had a color unit at the time and not only were these big fish easily distinguishable as big thick red arches but the flat was loaded with the bait clouds. My only regret is my father and brother weren't alive to experience that trip. They would have loved it. My bad though, that was 2008, not 1998."
4507737,mjayn,2016-02-02 13:25:00,1188,"Was wading below a dam at night, I was picking up walleyes and with a friend. My friend caught nothing and it was his third trip to the area without a fish. He lost a jig and went to tie on a new one, He grabbed my water resistant(rubber) flashlight to use to tie his jig then bobbled it and into the water it went, he had turned it off. Fast forward 10 days later we are at the same spot, Im still catching fish, he is still skunked. Finally he ties into one and fights it as it moves down stream. He gets it close and sure enough, its my flashlight. I grab it flick it on(it works) then off, put in back in my pocket. Story over, friend still skunked."
4514281,northerneyes,2016-02-04 07:32:00,72,On one trip we caught a dew eater walleye and put in our fish basket. We decided to tie the boat and get out to walk around some Rapids to fish on the other side. We left the basket tied to the boat. When we came back several otters were swimming all around our boat really chattering. They had gotten into the basket and stole the three walleye we had.
4515121,Kissmabass,2016-02-04 12:52:00,2,"If there are fishermen in the northeast particularly anglers fishing Washington's crossing on the Delaware River i'm fishing by bank for some walleye, If there are anglers that fish the Delaware River between PA and NJ let me know what tactics you use, if you want to. I'm going in the march timeframe."
4515297,fishron,2016-02-04 13:52:00,317,"KMB, your question is a bit off the topic of this thread but I'll be happy to give you an answer because when I lived in Bucks county, Pa., I fished that area a lot. If you have a boat and the river is not in flood stage, behind the bridge abutments is the place to fish, but in March the walleye will be on their spawning run. Slightly above Washington's Crossing is the New Hope V-dam. I've taken many walleye from shore in mid to late March in the deeper pools leading up to the dam, using jigs. Unfortunately access to the area was cut off when the old paper mill was converted to condos. You might be able to ask permission to access the river from the superintendent. A bit further up the Tohickon creek enters the river. It's a bit of a scramble to get to the spot the creek meets the river but I've taken nice walleyes there in the deeper spots. They were mostly females full of eggs. Guides regularly fish the large pool at Lumberville for walleye throughout the season. I think any one of the major tributaries to the river host a walleye run in March. The one thing I have to note though. The taste of a Delaware river walleye in no way compares to a Canadian caught walleye. Good Luck Ron"

4517089,East coast,2016-02-04 21:30:00,32,We were fishing La Reserve Beauchene a few years ago after seeing it on a Bob Izumi fishing show. The fishing was good but was even better was hooking into a case of Labatt Blue tied to a rope. The beer tasted great (it was even cold). Ran into a couple of guys at a camp later in the week. We were exchanging stories and they tell us about the trip the year before when they tied up their beer and dropped it in the lake to get it cold but lost the buoy line and all their beer. I didn't say a word....the Fishing Gods will take and the Fishing Gods will give
4489882,dschiebel,2016-01-26 23:57:00,85,Fishing Mink Lake out of Northern Wilderness Outfitters 3 Septs ago. Me and Doc my fishing partner were in about 25ft just off a reef in the middle of the lake. I was using my late son Chris's rod and reel. Netting a fish for Doc and over the side my rod went. God and my son was with me because after 20mins I caught the rod with a jimmy rigged sinker and spoon. The hook of the spoon actually hooked the line and hook of my son's rod. I cried for about an hour. I am a lot more careful now.

Fished for walleye for a few minutes with no luck and I suggest trolling to another spot. Just get started when the rookie has a bite. Like a few others' experience, he is nonchalant and I am freaking out! His first fish in Canada is a 42"" northern, equaling the largest one I ever caught in 12 years going to Canada. He spent the rest of the week as the ""Pikemaster"" and it took him a few days to realize just how special that fish was. He is also an artist and photographer and he did a good job of capturing our trip in a video. Take a look and you can see his fish! It is at 5:07.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY9EtnpYNIo"
4491546,Maskinonge,2016-01-27 11:41:00,13,"We have a spot on a gin clear northern Wisconsin lake with Secchi disk readings past 20'. Rock and sand bottom, practically no weeds, save for a couple of too-shallow back bays. Good walleye lake in general, good numbers, but almost exclusively centered around dawn/dusk or after dark. Walleyes pull a Houdini during the day unlike any other lake we've been to. Even the case on cloudy or foul weather days. Just like a light switch at dusk. But just this past year, a particularly high water year, we got a few weedy spots had enough depth to change the walleye behavior dramatically. We were catching fish up and over the weeds at noon in July, mostly on 3-4"" rib worm style plastics. We kind of adapted our typical smallmouth grub offering to Spring River Run/Green Bay-style rib worms. Even spotted a respectable one, maybe 18"", kayaking in the morning with my wife - under the few lily pads if 2' of water. In July/August! Couldn't believe it - rubbed my eyes, and sure enough, white-tipped tail. Revisited the spot in the boat an hour later, dropped a rib worm in the general vicinity, and didn't even move it 3' before catching that fish - almost like it was guarding a territory. Now, I'm wondering if those fish have always been there, and we've just never been hip to their presence, or if this was a unique year. We had weeds and water clearance over weeds like not other year, so probably a little bit of column a, little column b. We'll see in 2016, I suppose."

It is about 20 yards off the back of the boat when I see the flash of a fish going to T-bone it like many a musky or a pike. Well, surprise, 25 inch mega aggressive walleye. Thought it was a musky for sure. Biggest bait I have had a walleye hit."

We knew it was the same because he had a hook with a short piece of leader hanging hooked deep in his throat.

4496786,doubleheader,2016-01-29 08:41:00,2652,"In July of 1998 our group experienced 2 weeks of absolutely world class walleye fishing on a lake not renown for numbers or large fish. We found fish on a mud flat in 20-28 fow. This flat is over a mile long and and 3/4 mile wide with almost zero structure. While not unusual to catch fish here, the numbers and size were incredible and the bite lasted the entire two weeks we fished. Meanwhile, the entire time we were within sight of 2 lodges, and no one else was fishing the flat. Boats would come up along side us and ask how we were doing and we would give them an honest answer, but the numbers were so preposterous no one believed us and they would drive off. At the time we were investigating lodges for future trips, so we'd stop and talk with the lodge owners about fishing. They were all apologetic about how bad it had been and they were absolutely shocked when we showed them our pictures on our camera. ""Where did you get those?"" they'd say, and we'd just point out to the bay in front of their camp and say ""right out there"". We were pulling spinners @ .8mph, the slower the better to keep the perch bite down, your rod would load in 5 minutes, and 60% of the fish were over 22 inches, and 10% were over 26 inches. We released almost every fish, taking a picture of the big girls, and to this day in all my years of fishing I have never seen anything like trip."
4487890,Old Timer,2016-01-26 12:22:00,255,"I've had a few experiences like the other posters. Over the last fifty years, here are a few I can remember right now:On Larus Lake I netted a 43 inch Norske with the little walleye in his mouth like a dog and bone. He refused to let go.On Manion Lake I caught a loon on a slip sinker rig.On Moose Lake my companion caught a snapping turtle on a jig. The thing was as big as a manhole cover.On Dubwant Lake in the Territories we were catching big lakers. The Len Thompson five of diamonds was the hot spoon. We were down to two of them and my in-law lost his to a big trout. The next day we went back to the same reef and I caught a big trout with my five of diamonds and my in-law's barbless still hooked in the jaw of the fish. The fish went 40 lbs.On Seseganaga we had a couple slicers on the stringer for lunch. The stringer starts to rattle and we take a look. A jumbo Norske was trying to catch lunch too. He dropped the little walleye he was trying swallow and swam right down. My companion quickly dropped over a spoon and jiggled it a couple times. the Norske was still hungry and after a fight we netted a 44 incher.On Paskokogan Lake we had pulled up on a sand beach for lunch. Three of us were using jigs and minnows. We dropped the jigs over the side in maybe four inches of water, just so the minnows wouldn't dry out. After a short lunch we came back to the boat and there was a walleye on each of the three jigs.On Kenorain two of us had caught four or five take-home fish. We wanted to keep them fresh while we fished the other side of a big island. So my brother had the bright idea of sinking the stringer deep and tying on a marker. so we could come back and get the fish. The fish were sunk about 20 feet down and when we came back about an hour later we pulled up the very heavy stringer with a big snapping turtle still hanging on. On Rose Lake in the BWCA I was cleaning fish on a rocky point. A black bear showed up and wanted the fish. I tried to scare him off but he was not frightened. When he got to within 20 feet I headed for the canoe. he got the fish and stringer. A week later some friends took the same trip and camped at the far end of Rose. A bear showed up in camp and started tearing up the place. He then charged one of the fellows who killed it dead with 20 shots from a .22 auto. Back in the sixties we often took a gun along. No law prohibiting guns and the outfitters often recommended taking one along.On McCrea in September, four of us were fishing from an outpost. A band of natives came through in their freighter canoes, coming back from their summer camps along the ricing beds. A bit later we saw a canoe coming fast up to us. There was a young girl piloting the motor. In broken English she asked if we had a gun. We did, a .22 pump. She asked to use it and we followed her up the lake where the other canoes were circling a moose to keep it in the deep water. The girl pumped 15 or more shots into the moose's head until it expired. The whole group thanked us and we retrieved the gun and they pulled the moose onto shore for cleaning and we went back to fishing. in A fishing trip can sometimes be a lot more interesting than just catching a mess of slicers."
4488026,Coyoteman,2016-01-26 12:47:00,209,"One day on a lake right here in my neck of the woods, sw iowa, we were trolling in 6 foot of water with not much action. One of my passengers stands up to relieve himself and as he was he yells ""get up and look over there"". between the boat and shore were several eyes cruising around in about 1 foot of water. This was mid summer in the middle of the day. Well we put on the planers and ran our lures right in on them. They cooperated and we pulled our limits in very short order. We have repeated this scenario several times since that day."
4488138,fishron,2016-01-26 13:22:00,317,"Thanks for the replies, it makes for some interesting reading, keep them coming. It reminds me of some of the things that happen outside of walleye fishing. I had a big snapper take a rapala once. Even got him close to shore before he realized what was going on. I would have needed tuna tackle to stop him after he caught on. I had a cutoff once on a large spinner once and after tying on another I landed a small musky with my first spinner in his mouth. I'll bet this has happened to those that portage small motors to back lakes with pike. Landed a pike with several fresh slices along its flanks. Obviously tried to eat the small prop before taking my bait. Walleye don't seem as eager to commit suicide."
4488234,Coyoteman,2016-01-26 14:20:00,209,On a canoe trip in the boundary waters when I was a kid we were on a very clear lake. We could see an otter looking for food. I had an old plug that looked like a salamander. Well that plug ended up near that otter and he liked it. I can tell ya an otter can pull a canoe all over a lake. He did eventually win.

Then ended up landing a nice eye, while opening mouth plug out I just caught it on I noticed the plug deep in it's mouth I lost earlier. I just think the odds of me catching that fish with that many other boats fishing same area, on same plug with other still in its mouth, and in that amount of time was unbelievable."

I'm sure we have all experienced behaviors of our favorite fish, (walleye) that don't follow the norm. In a lake, I've taken walleye in less than three feet of water on plugs, doesn't that go against the norm. I've never had a double hook up on a walleye but several times on bass. That doesn't count the times when a pike grabs a walleye on the way in. That's all to common. I've taken several walleye on buzzbaits, up to 23 inches, in daylight. To me that seems abnormal.

One of the last days of our trip, about noon, as we we a working a break line that was not producing, one of us pitched our jig up into the shallows to "" catch a snake pike"", instead a nice walleye resulted.

One of us threw a Shad Rap to the deeper side away from the pencil weeds and caught a nice 23 inch walleye. We proceeded to work the mud flats 6-8 ft deep and catch really nice 18-23 in walleyes for several hours. The flat was the size of about 5-6 football fields and the whole thing held walleyes. Downside was clearing the mud off the jig nearly every cast when you didn't catch a walleye.Only thing we could figure was between the cold weather and late spawn we found a resting spot. The fish where in there looking for warmer water and the black bottom was warming the water up.B-

We were bottom bouncing harnesses on a lake in the Abitibi/Témiscaming region of Quebec early one overcast misty morning when Bill's rod suddenly almost bent in half. Big fish he exclaimed. After a 5 or 6 minute battle, Bill's rod suddenly straightened and the fish was gone. Once Bill had recovered most of his line, both he and I saw the tell-tale curled line that indicated his knot had not held. Being a perfectionist, Bill was thoroughly disgusted with himself. He always tied his own harnesses and always used long shanked hooks. Anyway, after 5 or 6 minutes of grumbling to himself, he turned to me and told me that that fish had hit so hard that he would not be surprised if that fish didn't hit again within 15 minutes. We kept bottom bouncing the area. Within 10 minutes, I experienced a similarly big hit - you all know the ones where your first thought is crap, it's probably a northern. A few minutes later, Bill netted a 7 ½ pound walleye for me. And stuck in that walleyes snout were the two long shank hooks of the harness that Bill had tied. Bill was a contributor to this board for many years. Sadly he passed way two years ago."

As soon as I felt the hit, I knew I had just lost it. I put on a new harness and we circled back for another pass. We got back to within 5' of where I lost the harness and BAM, another hit. I fought the fish back in and sure enough there was my old blade hanging out of a Northern's mouth."
