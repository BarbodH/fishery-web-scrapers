4529849,WalleyeRip,2016-02-09 08:30:00,44,I have used a heavy cast iron pan. What company makes the large non cast iron pans the guides use and where do you get them?

Good heat distribution. Fries large amounts of fish and potatoes. You can also get a detachable handle which makes packing easy. Pair this with a Coleman two- or three-burner propane stove, and shore lunch is a snap."

4533529,Lovetofish,2016-02-10 09:20:00,458,This is what I have. No complaints other than I don't get to use it enough.
4534393,bigwalleye1,2016-02-10 13:48:00,2632,"I've thought about these ""Paul Bunyan"" pans, but the sheer size of the things with the handle seem like they'd be a size vs weight tradeoff for cast iron. Any particular reason, walleyerip, for wanting one vs cast iron? Just want to make sure I'm not missing out on something."
