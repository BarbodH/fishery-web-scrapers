I know it's a big lake, but still.Which lodge would you recommend and why? I have my thoughts, just wondering what others think.Is there a single cabin outpost anywhere on the lake? I couldn't find any.What is the trophy pike and lake trout potential? Is it strictly a seasonal thing?Any feedback or info would be hugely appreciated, thanks fellas!"
4537857,adempsey,2016-02-11 18:51:00,963,"There are other cabins on the lake, but I couldn't figure out what they are. My guess is private, but unsure. One looks like a hunting camp [or a cabin shaped rock, lol].51.245128, -93.36342151.228964, -93.47409451.229419, -93.30665851.299518, -93.25530051.252576, -93.187161edit:everything you need to know can be found in this doc.

Our cabin had 2 bathrooms, 2 story with bedroom and upstairs lounging area, decks overlooking the lake both up and down. The walleye fishing for size was very good, we caught very few under 20 inches. We estimated 40 + eyes a day trolling Rapala Deep Diving Husky Jerks and Berkley Flicker Shads. The pike fishing was a bit slow although I did catch a beaut. It is a Big lake teeming with walleye, lakers, and pike. Cat island adventures was on the island next to Booi's. Big boat 30 and 35 hp elect. start motors."
4538121,Mike Borger,2016-02-11 20:24:00,1554,"Thanks Adam, you were right that document has a lot of info, thanks! Very interesting about the history of the Anishinaape natives on the lake. Also it seems I was correct as far as the number of lodges. Looking at the map that shows their locations Trout Lake Lodge at the north end of the lake seems more isolated from the others.Quote: Originally Posted by eyemikeMike, my wife and I went to Trout Lake the first week of July 2013.

One thing I always wondered, are all of their cabins single units or are they duplexes potentially housing two different groups??"
4538185,Hogwild,2016-02-11 20:46:00,3,"We fished out of Booi's in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Walleye fishing is good , most fish in the 20- 24 inch range. Some days you would struggle to catch any under 18. We also caught several lake trout in the 5-10 lb range. Never caught alot of pike but did catch some nice ones.We would see an occasional boat from cat island but no other boat traffic. I'm not sure if trout lake Lodge is open.Jim and Traci are good host and run a nice camp. Most of the cabins are duplex's."
4538217,eyemike,2016-02-11 21:10:00,233,"I am pretty sure some are not duplexes. Ours was. I did not hear the people on the other side much. There is a resort on the north end called Sandy Beach Lodge. We run to the north end in about 40 min. About 15 min. from lodge is some fabulous lake trout fishing. Big numbers, good size, in less that 20 ft. of water in July. People were shaking their heads including Jim Booi!"
4538529,Mike Borger,2016-02-12 06:29:00,1554,"It does sound good, thanks!! Looking at Trout Lake Lodge's website it says they would be closed for the 2015 season. Would like to know if they've reopened.Quote: Originally Posted by eyemikeI am pretty sure some are not duplexes. Ours was. I did not hear the people on the other side much.

Big numbers, good size, in less that 20 ft. of water in July. People were shaking their heads including Jim Booi!I would assume the cabins that aren't duplexes must be for huge groups. I have never heard a single negative thing about their operation but I can visualize problems if you have a rowdy group next door to you.Booi's, Cat Island and Sandy Beach are in the south end of the lake according to the map. It's Trout Lake Lodge that's in the north end.Everything is relative but I'd be curious to know exactly what you mean by big numbers and good size for the lake trout. Thanks!"
