Being surrounded by so many beautiful lakes such as Lukinto lake. Klotz lake, and many many more. Being a resident of this beautiful area you really get to appreciate the great outdoors. Looking forwarded to helping anyone out with information about the area if I can. I highly recommend the fishing here especially in the spring time and the bear hunting at this time as well. Trust me when I say you will not be disappointed on your fishing or hunting adventure as for accomodations there are so many choices and if I can help you with that just ask. Take care all my friends and new acquaintences best wishes always. happymike"

A very good friend of mine (older farmer) served in the US Army in Korea and sad to say saw a lot of bloody action while a very young man.....wasn't ""right"" when he came back home to eastern Ohio for a few years, until some older local men asked him to join them on a fishing trip to the Longlac area (this is ""back in the day"").....they camped lakeside on a number of trips, and he said those were some of the best times of his life. They took large tents with them, and car-toppers.....said being up in the north country helped him, as well as the wonderful fishing along with the friendship of those men....while it took him many years to readjust (his words) he loved going north of the border to fish....even in his later years when he joined our group, said his best fishing was in your backyard (ha) when he first traveled up north. Unfortunately, I've never fished in your area yet (though have fished both east and west of you)....enjoyed reading your post. Faith, Family, Friends.....and fishing... Rich B"

One of these years I'm gonna get back to fish Fernow, Chipman, Jobrin, and a few other lakes up there."

4526249,Babamel2,2016-02-08 07:45:00,414,"Mike, Those of us living much further south find the Northland a wonderful place to vacation. Accommodations can be few and far between when one travels along the trans Canadian Highway. What Motels and cafes could you list for Longlac and would you feel free to recommend some. I enjoy eating at places that local people love, while a tourist may drive by. I look forward to hearing your reply."

4530225,oleJoe,2016-02-09 09:41:00,114,We always stop at the restaurant behind Rexall drugs for breakfast. Good food an about 3 tables of local men solving most of the problems. Then gas up and on to Nakina. We do the same coming home. Nice town.
