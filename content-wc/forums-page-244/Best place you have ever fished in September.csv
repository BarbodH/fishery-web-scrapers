4511185,Larbo,2016-02-03 11:19:00,231,"LOTW is my favorite place to be in September. The brothers and I chase musky's, bass and walleye in that order. Weather can be a challenge sometimes, but the fishing can be fantastic. We do a boat-in. I would try and pick a place that if the wind picks up you always have a place fish."

The weather during September can be the worst of the worse or the best of the best, and sometimes both during the same day. I have been fortunate on several occasions to be there during the week before turnover for the lake. The pike and musky fishing has been outstanding when I have timed the trip to coincide with pre-turnover. The walleye fishing is normally outstanding this time of the year as they are normally bunched up in tight schools. Find one walleye and it's game on, as I know where they all are. The best thing about my mid to late September trip is that there are few other boats on the lake."
4515113,btyreprich,2016-02-04 12:51:00,1067,Second the comment on Old Post & Village. LONG drive from where I live - but it was a memorable trip to be sure!!!
