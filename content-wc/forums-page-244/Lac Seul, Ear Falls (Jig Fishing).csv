It's always a very effective presentation. If you can jig fish at home, you can do it here. That said, it's all about location."
4534281,outdoorsmin,2016-02-10 12:59:00,116,HAH. Sounds good. Thats what I wanted to hear
4535217,NWE,2016-02-10 19:08:00,13,"You really can't go wrong at anytime. I caution against the opening week because of ice, but otherwise you are wide open. I like the early season and late fall but have never been disappointed (I live here, fish it often). 1/4 oz Northland jig w/ minnow, shallow water if it's cold, up to 18' if the water is warm (mid 70's). Find structure, and enjoy."
4530457,outdoorsmin,2016-02-09 10:42:00,116,"Hello, Looking for some advice/input. My father and I are looking at booking a trip to Lac Seul (Evergreen Lodge), our favorite type of walleye fishing is jigging. What times of year are best for Jig Fishing on Lac Seul? Do these times coincide with the better bites? Thank you for your help this will be our first, and I am sure not last trip to Lac Seul."
4530569,btyreprich,2016-02-09 11:07:00,1067,"This will be our second trip to this lodge and can tell you that it's a great camp. We liked the fact the dock area is protected from waves though a bit longer of a boat ride to the fishing holes we like to go to. For what it is worth, our group has always gone the first of second week of August. More stable weather has been our goal. Very productive fishing for us!!"
4530929,stumcfar,2016-02-09 13:20:00,451,"We typically have went anywhere from Memorial weekend to early July. We almost exclusively jig fish. My experience is that the earlier you go in the year, the better the fishing will be closer to where you are staying. Last year over Memorial weekend we went just a few mile boat ride to the mouth of the Wenesaga and caught all the fish you could want to catch pretty much all day long."
4531049,bus33,2016-02-09 13:55:00,289,We go up for the opener in May and then again in late July or early August. Pretty much all we do is vertical jig and catch many fish.
4531201,outdoorsmin,2016-02-09 14:32:00,116,And most fishing of your fishing is vertical jigging in August?
4531209,outdoorsmin,2016-02-09 14:33:00,116,Which trip do you find the fishing more enjoyable? Or are both trips good. Thanks
4531257,mswope13,2016-02-09 14:45:00,73,"Stumcfar is correct. June will provide you with excellent fishing near camp on the north end of the lake. We typically go in July and travel down to Steamboat as it seems the Eyes head south towards the main basin. Evergreen is a great camp, fantastic boats, good cabins and Pat is awesome. Not sure if Moose is still around, but he's a great resource. You won't be disappointed."
4531441,prov1800,2016-02-09 15:56:00,5010,You can jig lac suel all year long.it is the best method for sure.the earfalls end of the lake is pretty good in the early season but as the fish start looking for deeper water around mid july you would be better off being closer to the deeper water areas.onaway lodge is much closer to better fishing.and about the same distance to steamboat narrows.on bad windy days and there are some you dont want to boat from yhecearfalls area.
4533465,MikeinMN,2016-02-10 08:58:00,190,"I think if you like to jig fish you will be in the right place on Lac Seul. I have caught fish there using other methods, and given a choice I would prefer to troll or cast crankbaits, but in my experience the Ear Falls end of Lac Seul is most effectively fished with jigs and bait. Live bait seems to work best (as opposed to plastics) and most of the time a minnow or 1/2 of a nightcrawler work just about the same. I have not really seen much of a preference in jig color there. I totally agree with prov1800 about seasonal locations and running from Ear Falls in the wind. We stay at Gawley's (which pretty close to Ear Falls) in August and mostly make pretty long runs to where we think the better fishing is, and we have definitely had some rough rides."
4533601,bus33,2016-02-10 09:41:00,289,"As far as catching rate....it is pretty equal. The difference is on the opener....we don't have to look as much for the biting fish and the weather. We usually head to the Wenasaga River sanctuary (5 minutes from Ear Falls). As far as the weather, we have fished in t-shirts and we have dodged chunks of ice.....weather can be a crapshoot. During our July/August trip we catch a good amount of fish but we have to search a little for them. After going for a few years, we can count on a few different locations and depths that will almost always produce. You really can't go wrong with either."
