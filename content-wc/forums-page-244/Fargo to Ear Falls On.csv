4521465,wallydave,2016-02-06 11:27:00,2151,You can stop at Dutchies on the left hand side of 105 before you get to Ear Falls. Nice folks from Iowa. You can buy beer there if that's your beverage of choice.
4521921,Carnhzkr,2016-02-06 13:49:00,964,"Ask five different people for directions, and you'll get five different answers. What Low4fish described is the most straight-forward and simplest way, and it's 4-lane all the way, but I prefer to turn east at Morris and make my way over to Hwy 12. You'll see what I mean if you look at a road map. If you go that route, you're better off to bypass Steinbach to the north. I've never timed the two routes, but I've driven both many times and it sure seems like it's faster to cut over. When I drive it, I'm pulling a fifth-wheel with a boat behind that. It's two-lane until you get to 12, but it's flat, straight, and pretty sparse so passing, or being passed isn't an issue. What I hate about the other route is there are several stoplights on the bypass around Winnipeg. Just as soon as I get that rig up to 60mph, I hit a stoplight, so I'm either accelerating or stopping. Just one man's opinion. If you're considering angling through Bemidgi to Baudette, I'd reconsider."

We bought a 4 lb. block for the 16 hour drive back home. When we arrived, the block of ice was about the size of a deck of cards. Fish were still rock hard."
