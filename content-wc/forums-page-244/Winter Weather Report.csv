4537881,elway12,2016-02-11 18:58:00,335,Was wondering how the winter weather has been in the NW Ontario(Ignace) area. Alot of snow? Mild temps? Frigid? etc.
4537929,prov1800,2016-02-11 19:23:00,5010,Been about the same in ignace area as vermilion bay. Fairly mild mild winter with the odd week of -30 as it is right now.Couple of ft of snow.slush coming up.cant complain.
4538625,Skywagon,2016-02-12 06:50:00,1106,"Less snow than normal and no need for ice auger extensions this year. Fished south of Ignace recently, some slush, but with so little snow on the trout lakes, it was not much of an issue. If this unusual mild winter should continue, it will be an early ice-out with less snow to melt, but with that said, there can be some big dumps of snow in March and have seen -35 temps at that time."
