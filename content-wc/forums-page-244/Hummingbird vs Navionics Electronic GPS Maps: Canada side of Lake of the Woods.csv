And, is there a difference in various locations on the Canadian side? Any information regarding when those areas were remapped and the the type of GPS accuracy was used to map the lake? Thanks"

I use both chips when I am on the Canada side. PM if you want more details do not try to call hummingbird cause they will not be able to tell you.
