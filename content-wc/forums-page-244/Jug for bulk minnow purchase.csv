4500738,Blackmacs,2016-01-30 20:29:00,2121,"These are easy to make. You need to pull out the white nozzle, then drill out the inside ridge of the red cap so a tire valve will fit flush. Use a spade bit that is slightly larger than the diameter of teh valve base. Then you may need to drill out the hole in the cap so the valve will pull though but still lock in. Finally silicone inside the cap around the base of the valve."
4500922,dschiebel,2016-01-30 22:27:00,85,salted minnows work just as good
4500946,Pooch,2016-01-30 23:48:00,4619,"That's exactly what I started early yesterday morning. Found Schrader valve with pipe plug threads for a water pressure tank on Ebay. I think I can thread the valve into the red plastic cap. Might tap it first. Silcone or JB weld (if necessary) for a tight seal.Several posters have mentioned salted or frozen minnows and that subject comes up several times a year on the Canada forum. I prefer salted to frozen as I have stated before, but always keep my options open as I've seen live minnows, salted minnows and frozen minnows all, at one time or the other be the ""go to"" bait on any given day or trip.Thanks for everyone's input.Pooch"

4523697,Woollybob,2016-02-07 09:48:00,158,Pooch - get the valve stems for a normal tire. Have to trim the inside a bit so all is flush. Put a little silicone for extra sealing and support.We have a few of these and have lasted for years.
4497706,Pooch,2016-01-29 15:04:00,4619,"I see camps use a water jug like the attached picture for transporting minnows into camp. My jug looks like the one they use, but theirs has a tire inflation attachment (Schrader valve) instead of a petcock in the cap.Anyone familiar with these? I can't find a replacement cap that fits my jug that would be suitable for installation of a Schrader valve. We buy bulk minnows and would like a safer way of transporting them to camp.Thanks,Pooch"
4497778,Obabikon,2016-01-29 15:26:00,2370,http://www.ebay.com/itm/Five-Gallon-...UAAOSwNSxVOq-y Here's a new jug on Ebay for $10.99
4497850,Pooch,2016-01-29 15:46:00,4619,"I only need a lid that I can install a Schrader valve into. Have the jug that is in my picture. Appears to be the same as the bait shops deliver minnows into camp with. It is tight enough to hold the O2 they inject into the container.I keep forgetting to ask the minnow trapper when I see them a couple times a year. Maybe I just need to call them. Thought maybe a camp owner here on WC might know what I'm looking for.I hate transporting minnows in O2 bags for several hours. Even though keeping the bagged minnows in a five gallon bucket with a little ice works for transport to the lake, we can't get as many needed minnows into one bag as we use in a week.Just trying to refine our ""system"".Pooch"
4498026,Shellback,2016-01-29 17:00:00,8083,You may want to go by a truck tire place. They have metal valve stems with nuts and washers. might be able to adapt your cap with the valve stem.
4498114,Algoma Guy,2016-01-29 17:15:00,48,Can you separate the minnows into smaller bags and place them in coolers. This is what I do. How far and long are you transporting these minnows?
4498154,Baseline,2016-01-29 17:35:00,3207,Vern's Bait Shop in Ignace Ontario has these jugs with the inflation valve. I'm sure they could give you the name of the vendor who sell them. The jugs are heavier duty than the commonly sold collapsable water jugs.
4498250,Obabikon,2016-01-29 18:17:00,2370,ok... is this what you're looking for?http://www.ebay.com/itm/VP-Racing-Fu...FUWABj&vxp=mtr
4498258,Obabikon,2016-01-29 18:25:00,2370,"Alternative option... buy one of these, insert it in the stem you already have, and put a heavy duty hose clamp to create the adapter.http://www.ebay.com/itm/1-8-Brass-Ch...3L_8_SfKJVWAGw"
