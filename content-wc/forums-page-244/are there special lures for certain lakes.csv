4479714,TP180,2016-01-23 10:56:00,59,"Not only do certain lures work better than others on certain lakes, but I would say certain lures even work better in certain areas of the same lake. On Lake Winnebago for example, I would use a different lure and color fishing the reefs than I would fishing the mud."
4495186,Admiral Cain,2016-01-28 16:01:00,15,"Hot-N-Tots will catch anything that swims. The triggering action is that the Hot-N-Tot not only has a tantalizing swimming action, but it then shifts from side to side. It's this side to side action that drives Ontario fish wild! My go to Canadian Bait. I have caught Walleye, Pike, Lake Trout, Smallies, Muskie, Bourbut, and Perch in Canadian waters on this bait. Old Storm Models are the best ever. Rapala is doing their best to replicate. Tight Lines! Admiral."
4495218,Mike Borger,2016-01-28 16:20:00,1554,Nothing's ever etched in stone...but I usually don't have much luck with rattling lures on super clear lakes like Savant. Tannin stained waters are a different story...
4495434,fishron,2016-01-28 17:33:00,317,"I believe the clarity of the lake has a lot to do with your fishing success. My success with trolling, usually hot n tots, has been on tea colored waters. I confess that the best walleye I caught on a trip a couple years back, on a gin clear lake, came when my rod was in a holder. The rod just doubled over and there she was. Got my picture posted in the now defunct north american fishing magazine that year."
4495954,Pooch,2016-01-28 20:20:00,4619,"Mike,Lake Savant is stained, not clear at all. Like most larger bodies of water in Canada it can vary across the lake, but overall it's fairly dark. Much darker on average than Lac Seul. You're not thinking of Sturgeon (south of Savant) are you? That lake is gin clear to the max.What you say about clear water and rattlers makes sense. Hadn't gave that much, if any thought. Hmm...Pooch"
4497162,Algoma Guy,2016-01-29 10:49:00,48,I don't see any mention of water temps which has a lot to do with what a fish will hit. As a general rule of thumb I use 2 tactics. Jigging and spinner rigging. Water cold= Jigging Water warm=trolling spinner rigs. That being said Hot-N-Tots could be one of the best trolling crank baits for walleye out there. They are especially effective towards the fall. A group of guests from Michigan troll them exclusively. Very easy to determine if they are running right as well. The tiniest piece of weed will throw off the action.
4508057,spw2350,2016-02-02 14:43:00,26,"I definitely think certain colors/lures on certain lakes. Flew into a lake out of wawa, 6 of us didn't know diddly squat about the lake other than the outfitter said it was 1 of his top producing walleye and pike lakes. We were doing poor to fair trolling old standbys of spoons and raps... second full day my nephew pulled out a brand new color--rainbow rapala..he had taken quiet a bit of joking from us we said it looked like a circus lure...he started catching large pike over the same water we all had been fishing then moved to another section and started catching walleye..so we all started pawing thru our tackle boxes to try and find something similar...found out thru trial and error that Blue was the color...almost any lure predominately blue was hit and hit hard....I lost a large #10lb walleye on a blue/silver cleo when my partner (inexperienced fisherman) slapped the net on the fish and the line @ he side of the boat and broke me off...ahhhhhhhhhhh there went my only blue lure and the fish..Later that month when I went into see my barber we were talking and he said his partner the other barber also goes into wawa fishing...one thing led to another and lo and behold we found out that we both used the same outfitter and went into the same lake different times of the year...he said "" you know the trick to that lake is use a blue colored lure.."" Sorry for the long story but your question brought fond memories"
4474658,fishron,2016-01-21 17:11:00,317,"There have always been lures that produce well for walleye. A jig and and minnow, alive or dead, a jig and a worm or leech, always a producer.For times when we didn't feel like jigging, we found that certain lures produced far better than others. Rapalas and smithwicks were always go to trolling plugs, but for a lake we fished often, namely Cabonga reservoir, a blue tiger hot n tot (out of production) outfished anything else we could put on our lines for trolling. It was so good we had that pattern made specifically for us by storm lures. Anyone else have that experience?"
4475866,Bill Krejca,2016-01-22 07:02:00,6107,"Without getting into a lot of details: Simplified, it has been my observation that in stained (less clear) water, baits with some amount of shiny seem to produce better. In clear waters, generally, not so much. Bill"
4476818,Pooch,2016-01-22 11:08:00,4619,"Must be some reason why some baits produce on some lakes, but not others. Used to sometimes fish Rattletraps on Birch Lake, ON and catch walleye at will. Go to Lake Savant, ON and a Rattletrap is totally ignored. Gave up trying them long time ago.Appears there is a difference between fisheries. Probably for a lot of reasons not readily apparent to me. Has to be forage related, plus what Bill eluded to in his above post.Pooch"
4476922,Freytown,2016-01-22 11:36:00,770,"Had a friend that loved hot n tot's and caught ton's of eyes on them. One night back at camp he declared the hot n tot's caught all his walleye that day. I said Eddie, that's all you have used for the past three days. Just sayin'."
4476986,fishron,2016-01-22 11:52:00,317,"You have a good point and I admit we did have a tendency to fish only hot n tots. We tried many other colors and metalics but in that tea colored lake the blue tiger was by far the best. We did fish other lures with some success when going to water less than 12 ft deep. In Lady Evelyn the blue tiger was not as good as the olive moonglow that came out more recently. I always felt that the metal lip on the hot n tot gave the lure an extra harmonic draw. I suppose all trolling plugs give off certain vibrations but the metal lip is unique. More recently fishing Hebert in Quebec, jigging is by far the way to go. Trolling a plug doesn't produce nearly the large numbers that a jig will. Anyway, to me it adds to the adventure to discover the best method for a particular lake."
4477106,oleJoe,2016-01-22 12:24:00,114,"I have used a small black an gold hot-n-tot the last 2 years. I put it on when I get there an take it off when I leave. 90% of the paint is gone and I have three spares but until I lose it , its #1. Stained water and walleye and pike is 90% of the fish. I don't know if it is the gold or the wobble but it works. It will go back on again in May, for the 3rd yr running. Good fishing."
4477458,maddie,2016-01-22 14:46:00,42,"We also go to Quebec and I have a friend who fishes nothing but magnum gold hot n tot. I was determined to out fish him with another lure if it was the last thing I did. Got him two years in a row,1st year Berkley flickershad in electric perch , last year gold flo salmo. We find not only do certain lures work good in certain lakes but some lures work better certain years in the same lake."
4477762,fishron,2016-01-22 16:17:00,317,"Could be that it pays to try different lures once in awhile. There is a problem in getting stuck on one particular lure. That's part of the reason for my post. I always get from my wife......''how could you possibly need another lure''. She may be right, but I'm always willing to learn through another's experience. At the end of the day, my fishing buddies and I always talk about what we caught on which lure. It seems more important on pressured lakes. On the fly-in's, seems you could throw anything and get action. The new fishing catalogs are arriving in the mail. Are some of the lures going to catch me more walleyes or just catch me."
4478026,fsz,2016-01-22 17:17:00,144,"I've Been fishing the Kipawa area back lakes since 79. In the early years, we caught walleye on just about anything. Daredevils worked especially well. We attributed the lack of pickiness on lack of fishing pressure. Now, a daredevil would never catch a walleye. Jigs, original rapalas, huskys, and hot n tots rule the roost. Always fished dark water lakes. The lakes forage base, weather, clarity, time of year all have an impact. One thing for sure- a night crawler is not a substantial Part of the forage base anywhere. But they work. At times, we cream suspended fish with Erie dearies. Most folks up there have never seen them."
4478362,maddie,2016-01-22 18:26:00,42,"fishron We drive into northern Quebec to remote lakes and have found that hot n tot""s , flicker shads and salmo""s are our go to lures . Because we are pulling our boats in we take many different lures and are constantly trying something new .One thing you have to keep in mind is that all lures the same make and color are not created equal, no matter how you try to tune them alike some are going to catch more fish. I recommend guarding them with your life and give the others to your buddies."
