If in Ontario, Eastern and Northern Ontario not over towards Manitoba. I see from the forum that many lakes are not what they were 10 years ago. Let me know if you have had good luck in the last two years, where and what month of the year.Thanks so much!"
4510241,MrSimon,2016-02-03 06:35:00,922,Have you thought about just driving out to the Ottawa River. There are plenty of nice little camps and the walleye fishing can be very good. It's also a beautiful river to fish.
4510377,adempsey,2016-02-03 07:17:00,963,Plenty of places in Quebec to check out. Better if you're willing to take a float plane to one.http://www.pourvoiries.com/en/interactive-map/

4515441,fsz,2016-02-04 14:44:00,144,"Never been there myself, but perhaps look into Dumoine lake with Kipawa Outfitters . http://www.kipawaoutfitters.com/ There is also another outfitter on the lake can't remember the name. Drive to location about 2 hours from The Ontario Hwy 63 crossing on the Ottawa River. Outpost camps are scattered about the lake, so cabins are not on top of each other. Dark water lake with walleye and pike. I fish a ""back lake"" in the general area without any outfitters on it, and I've heard good things about Dumoine. If I was going to relocate to another lake, it would be high on my list"
4518081,north560,2016-02-05 09:10:00,53,"Check out Gow-Bush-Kon Lodge in Gowganda about a 6-7 hr drive from Ottawa.Decent walleye fishing,lots of small mouth (year round), pike,perch and lake trout.Clean and comfortable cabins with great boats."
