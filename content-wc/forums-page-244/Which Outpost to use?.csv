4516673,Guest,2016-02-04 19:28:00,0,"Back in 2014 I flew into Cam Lake with Parks. There was four guys in our group. We caught northern pike on Cam Lake until our wrist hurt. We managed to pull one walleye out of that lake in 6 days of fishing. It was a brute...28"" and 6lbs. Unfortunately, all the pike on this lake are hammer handles. The lake is infested with them. The pike were so aggressive that they would hit virtually anything you threw in the water. We walked the trail to Little Miss and had pretty good luck with Walleye up the river and in the far back bay located near the boat cache. I caught my personal best Pike at 42"" and 25lbs in Elbow Lake which is located through a narrow winding creek mid way up the river accessible by boat. There is a decent population of walleye in this lake as well. I wish we could've spent more time in Elbow as the walleye caught here were on the larger size...20's up to 26"". Down at the falls, I used a jointed J11 Rapala and caught a walleye every cast. They were all on the smaller size but fun to catch. There is a deeper section in the river next to the creek going to Elbow Lake were we caught a bunch of Walleye too. On our last day, we spent about 2hrs in the back bay by the boat cache. We trolled harnesses and we caught walleye on every short run. All walleye were 20"" to 23"". We ran out of worms so we called it a day. The cabin was very basic but met our needs for 4 guys. There was a natural spring on Cam Lake that we got our water from which was nice so we didnt have to fly any in and take away from our 100Lb weight limit. The picture of the Pike is on their website under Cam Lake. We tried booking their camp on Little Miss this year in early June but they were all booked up. We have decided to try out Lake Hebert in quebec instead. The only draw back about Little Miss was how shallow that whole lake is. It was tough finding deeper sections in that lake but nonetheless it still produced a lot of above average walleye. If I were you, I would book this lake if you can."
4516729,Mike Borger,2016-02-04 19:45:00,1554,I had virtually the same experience as you although I only fished Cam for maybe an hour the entire trip. Fished Little Miss exclusively. There's quite a bit of deeper water in Little Miss although its concentrated. I loved that trip. Elbow was good to us too. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_Lw...qCe1B08zGzKokdhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrma...qCe1B08zGzKokdTrump was great for smaller lake trout too. Beautiful lake!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DqQ...qCe1B08zGzKokdhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hevt...qCe1B08zGzKokd

The cabins are great, no issues with the boats, and have always had a great time. By far my favorite lake is Little Miss. There is a ton of water, and you can basically just catch walleye all day."

2137721,pwbmlr,2013-09-30 12:06:00,37,Hello everyone I am new to this site but have to say it is very nice. I am looking to take a trip to Canada next spring. I will be going with a group of 4 guys and we are looking at either using Hawk Air or Parks. Can anyone give me any suggestions as to which one you would recommend? We will be going in May so any advise as to which lake would be best so eary in the year would be great. Hawk Air suggested either Duffy or Upper Duffy for early spring fishing.Park's suggested either Anjigaming or Abbey lake. We are looking for good number of walleye (size not a big deal) and Northerns.If you have been to any of these locations and have pics of the cabins I would appreciate some pics. Thanks
2138129,adempsey,2013-09-30 14:43:00,963,"You should search this forum, there are some great fishing reports from some of those locations. Check for those posted by Mike Borger (solopaddler) in particular.However, I can link you some pictures that I put in the directory I am currently working on. Parks - AbbeyParks - AnjigamingHawk - DuffyHawk - Upper Duffy"
2160850,canufish,2013-10-11 13:19:00,16,Hi AdamMy Brother and I just recently returned from a fly in to Abbey Lake we flew in on Sept the 6th to the 13th and had a great trip we caught a ton of walleye and I was very happy with Parks they came through on everything they had promised instead of flying out of wawa we flew out of chapleau which cut a few hours of driving off our time that was a bonus as for the acommadations everything was great I would sure love to give that lake a try in the spring we have already decided to do another fly in with Parks next year to Anjigaming or Ribes Lake any other questions feel free to ask. Cheers Mitch...
2161178,Tylumps,2013-10-11 17:26:00,73,"Hey Mitch, I thought Hawk Air was doing all the flying for Parks. You didn't fly out of Hawk? What outfitter did your flying? Does Parks have their own planes? Just Curious"
2162346,adempsey,2013-10-12 15:36:00,963,Park's also uses Canadian Airways out of Chapleau.
2162986,canufish,2013-10-13 06:32:00,16,Parks does not have his own planes this was my first trip with this outfitter as far as I know if you are flying out of Wawa they use Hawk Air we made plans to fly out of Chapleau as this would shorten our drive time we flew out with Canadian Airways. Cheers....
2170826,chris.brock,2013-10-17 09:13:00,112,"hopefully Solopaddler chimes in on this one, I haven't been to those specific lakes but have had 2 good experiences with Martin and Park's Fly-in"
2197242,[emailÂ protected],2013-11-01 14:56:00,21,"Go to Abbey Lake. Very nice cabin and lake for 4 people. Excellent mid size walleye numbers. Park's uses both Hawk Air (Hawk Lake) and Canadian AirVentures (Chapleau) for the flying. Not many outfitters do their own flying anymore. Park's has the lowest rates, the best outboard motors, and very nice people to deal with. Anjagiming has good numbers, but the camp is used more. One negative at Anjaming is you have to boat to the other end of the lake for the water pump, and the water smells, otherwise very good. Abbey is an older log cabin, but looks good."
2197362,polaris-pete,2013-11-01 17:18:00,343,we were at Abbey mid June and had a great time. I have booked again at Ribes for last of may/early june.
4515209,DougBlack,2016-02-04 13:28:00,29,"I fished Ribes end of may first of june, and like all places that time of year, bring the netting the flies were thick. Fishing was outstanding though, good luck."
