538624,rebelrn2001,2004-04-03 20:13:00,1563,I think I made a similar post last year: Anyone going to Wabigoon this May? We will be at Merkels Camp from the 22nd to the 29th. We're going 1 week earlier this year due to a conflict with vacations at my work. I am hoping for similar results on the pike 2 years ago when the big gals were still in about 1 foot of water on the shores and the weeds were still below the surface. BAM--they slam those lures!!!

538885,Guest,2004-04-15 05:55:00,0,"I WAS AT MERKELS CAMP LAST YEAR MAY 1ST, FOR THE WEEK. THE WEATHER WAS IN THE 70S EVERY DAY,BUT WE MISSED ALL THE BIG PIKE ACTION. ICE OUT WAS AROUND APRIL 20TH. ONLY 1 12LB NORTHERN. I DID GET INTO SMALLMOUTH CAUGHT 14, ALL 4LBS WITHIN 1 HR.. THE PREVIOUS YEAR I WAS THERE MAY 10TH. WE HAD TO WAIT TILL 1:OO FOR THE ICE TO GET OUT OF THE BAY. I MUST HAVE CAUGHT 20 PIKE BETWEEN 8&12LBS. IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHEN THE ICE GOES AND WHAT THE WEATHER DOES. IF THE WATER TEMP WARMS UP QUICKLY, THE SPAWN IS OVER.THE BIG PIKE FOLLOW THEM INTO DEEPER WATER. I AM GOING MAY 9TH THIS YEAR. I FEAR THE ICE IS GOING OUT AROUND THE 1ST. TERRY THINKS I'VE GOT THE RIGHT WEEK,WE'LL SEE. I WISH I COULD JUST LEAVE WHEN THE ICE GOES, BUT THAT WORK VACATION THING DOESN'T ALLOW. GOOD LUCK FISHING! IF ANYONE HAS UPDATES ON ICE ON WABIGOON LET ME KNOW. THANKS,"

538906,cough6609,2004-04-16 08:33:00,48,"You might want to consider Davis' Bonny Bay Camp. Central location on the north shore of Wabi. Very reasonable, family oriented camp with a choice of the basic 16 foot boat or a 17.5 with all the extras. Resorts often claim their main lodge is open to the guest, this one really is. Nancy and her husband are extremely socialable and really enjoy the after-hours. Best of all it takes 15 minutes to get into Dryden if you need to refill the fridge. Only downside is if there is a big south wind blowing...makes a bumpy ride out! Stained lake so fish are much shallower than you normally think. Good luck! Craig"
538914,Guest,2004-04-16 12:57:00,0,I fished Wabigoon with my Dad back when there was no camp on the lake. Rocky Lakes Camp had a couple boats stashed there. I think we had to get a key to use the M&O paper company road to get there. It was awesome. Huge Muskies in that lake in those days. We caught walleyes as fast as we could get a Lazy Ike into the water. ...about 1958?? Man...I AM getting ancient!!
538921,rebelrn2001,2004-04-16 15:42:00,1563,Web site is: http://www.merkelscamp.com/ Terry and Merril are both good hosts. Clean cabins. Reasonable (the web site costs aren't up to date the last I looked). Tell Terry and Merril that Dan and Sue from Green Bay sent you. This will be our 8th? year there in a row. 36 days and counting--35 really because we spend the night in Ft Frances and drive into the camp at 11:01 (when you can get there). I remember the first time we went--we drove all night and got there at about 5 am. Terry was up already and welcomed us to our cabin. We've been back every year since.
