538881,stumcfar,2004-04-14 20:44:00,451,Has anybody stayed at Jackson's Lodge on Quesnel? We are heading there the first week of June. This is our 1st time back in about 6 years. Has the fishing rebounded?
538923,Guest,2004-04-16 17:48:00,0,Have been there in May the last three years. Fishing has been good in all the same spots except jackfish bay. I believe late ice out and low water are to blame. Can't tell you if this means it has rebounded. Good luck Le pic
