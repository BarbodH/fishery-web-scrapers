538836,Hammerhead Herb,2004-04-13 11:53:00,259,An excellent place to buy bait in Ear Falls is D & E Minnows. Their phone number is 807-222-2496 Their website is www.deminnows.ca They were the only Ear Falls bait retailer not to run out of bait in 2003 We've been using them for about 3 years and are quite satisfied.
538847,Brax,2004-04-13 18:45:00,52,"Wow, that place looks like the top of the line bait store and the prices aren't bad either. How far is it from the center of Ear Falls?"
538861,Guest,2004-04-14 07:13:00,0,"2 Dogs stop in this summer and we'll set up a time to go for a boat ride. However I don't want to ruffle any feathers down in Ear Falls. I probably won't see you at Ernie's this summer since you're buying a new boat, what kind of rig are you getting.This last day for ice fishing (walleyes) 30 days to opener!!"
538865,2 DOGS,2004-04-14 10:43:00,361,"Bud: The new rig will still have a Merc pushing it, so chances are still good you'll see me at Ernies, if not I'll stop by. Thought I'd try out that Triton warranty and see if I can crack some glass instead of popping rivets. Sounds like you need some warm rains, if there is such a thing up there, to move that ice along."
538866,Hammerhead Herb,2004-04-14 11:06:00,259,"About 2 miles. There is a place in their website that shows how to get there; it's not hard. Also, their folks live in Ear Falls. If you call ahead, they have brought them to town and had them waiting for us. I recommend that you go to their place of business; when they scoop them out of the tanks, they give you a lot more than what you asked for. We drive up from N Cent IL for a fly out. I call them up before we head up to Ear Falls. Then we call them again when we are at the Trillium. We head out to their place and they are waiting for us and package the minnows while we are there. We pick them up around 8 in the morning and they pack them up real nice with air in the bags because we are not able to get them in the water at the lake until about noon."
538887,lunker99,2004-04-15 07:38:00,236,"Wow, can't believe I forgot about them. Bought some minnows from them for the first time last year. Great count and nice bait. Didn't get any leeches there, so can't vouch for them......yet!"
538890,Guest,2004-04-15 10:41:00,0,2dogs suppose to rain the next couple of days but nights are still below freezing. Took are shacks off the ice nast lite after we caught some nice eyes.when are you heading up to the area?
538892,2 DOGS,2004-04-15 11:36:00,361,"Bud: Only God knows when I'll make it up there and he ain't talking. Big motor has to be rigged at factory, end of May. I pick it up there (Tenn.) then back home for rest of rigging and loading, then north. Hoping to be there about June 8-9. Think I'd better get me a kidney belt! Hope you marked that ice shack location on the GPS before you moved it!"
538758,Guest,2004-04-12 04:14:00,0,"Does anyone know of a good place to buy bait once I cross the border? I am looking to buy a pound of jumbo leeches. I will be crossing at Fort Francis and heading to Goose Bay on Lac Seul. Also, which is the best route to take from FF to Goosebay?"
538761,retire55,2004-04-12 07:23:00,1029,BraxII: You might try finding a bait supplier at http://www.baitnet.com/
538762,2 DOGS,2004-04-12 08:05:00,361,Continue up 105 past Goose Bay 3-4 miles to Ear Falls. Bait shop on main drag called the 4 Seasons normally has leeches. Good place to get your license also.
538771,Brax,2004-04-12 13:59:00,52,"Thanks 2 Dogs, I will try the bait shop in Ear Falls."
538775,Guest,2004-04-12 17:19:00,0,"I second Four Season, alot of our guest stop there. Count and quality is good. Hey 2 dogs 32 walleyes last nite. The ice isn't doing much right now on Gullrock still got about 25in. of good ice."
538777,2 DOGS,2004-04-12 18:18:00,361,"Hey Bud, do they have a different limit for you resort owners! Man, I wish I could have been there, that kind of ice fishing I could handle. Sounds like you're gonna have to hook up a heater to get that ice moving faster. Getting a new ride that won't be delivered until late, how about I pull it up there one day and you give me a tour of Gullrock?"
538778,Guest,2004-04-12 18:19:00,0,If you call ahead to four seasons they'll have them waiting for you. I suggest you do this in case they are out by the time you get there.
538779,DAVIS_VIEHBECK,2004-04-12 18:41:00,15,"Rainy Lk sports (the Can Op) in Fort Frances is usually good for bait and other supplies. A little closer to Ear Falls is at the Esso in Vermillion Bay. Decent tackle selection, good bait. Don't wait til Ear Falls just in case! -Davis"
538790,lunker99,2004-04-13 04:32:00,236,We've bought leeches at the Esso and Four Seasons in the past. Not much difference in price per pound and comparable quality year to year so I'd suggest buying at which store would be more convenient for you to stop at.
