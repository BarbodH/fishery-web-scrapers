I guess we do what is convenient, as I am not sure the savings is worth the time. That's just my opinion. As far as crawlers are concerned, we do bring them in. I usually have a flat on hand anyway as I fish a lot with them back home. I already have them packed in commercial bedding, so it is not a problem at the border. We cross at International Falls and they have been very good. We try to have them easily accessible (usually packed in bedding in a large cooler with ice). Never an issue. Just make sure you don't transport in dirt."
538937,Guest,2004-04-17 19:49:00,0,"You can get crawlers at a place in the west end of Vermillion Bay, on the south side of Hwy 17. I can't think of the name right now, but it will be obvious."

538770,Guest,2004-04-12 13:15:00,0,"We have had good luck using crawlers. We do a lot of lindy style fishing, and crawlers seem to work well starting about late June. We have tried many baits (plastics, minnows, leeches, raps) with different presentations and tend to have the best luck with the live baits (crawlers, leeches and minnows). Of those, the crawlers are the least expensive, so we do use them a fair amount."
538772,Guest,2004-04-12 15:46:00,0,What end of the lake are you having such success with crawlers? Ear Falls or Sioux lookout?
538774,Guest,2004-04-12 17:11:00,0,"Ditto to that. We fish out of the Sioux Lookout area, and crawlers killed them. >We have had good luck using crawlers.

538782,Guest,2004-04-12 19:06:00,0,We fish mostly in the Sioux Lookout area.
538789,lunker99,2004-04-13 04:27:00,236,Will be up there the second week of june in the ear falls area. We ususally do fairly well on crawlers at that time of year. Either under a slip bobber or half a crawler to tip a jig.
538794,eyeman_1,2004-04-13 06:13:00,690,Used lots of crawlers the last time I fished up there. Sioux Lookout and further NE. Pulled lots of bottom bouncers w/crawler rigs and couldn't keep the eyes off.
538886,nitroman,2004-04-15 06:41:00,368,try soaking your crawlers in a small bucket of ice water for 20-30min first this gets them plumped up and wigglin then i use a #10 bronze aberdeen hook i hook the crawler just thru the tip of his nose and shoot a small puff off air in his butt with a worm blower attach a vey small split shot 15-18in up just enough to let it sink very slowly toss it out and wait for that tell-tale tick that says there's fish on the end give em a couple seconds then set the hook i use this method when we are jigging and it really works all the guys i fished with last year have worm blowers for this year (they thought it was a joke last year till i was catching fish and they were not)
538901,orchard frank,2004-04-15 20:44:00,1900,"We like to fish with bottom bouncers to minimize snags. I know it sounds strange, but we usually just gob up half a crawler on a plain hook and putt around the reefs and breaklines. I don't know what the eyes think it is but they NAIL them, no pecking around like a stretched out crawler, very little bait stealing, and almost no swallowed hooks, you can set immediately. Also in June, be sure to give sand flats a try, right up to 4-5' of water. Good Luck"
538928,JoeUpnorth,2004-04-17 06:50:00,17,"Do most of you guys bring your crawlers from home? We go through Int. Falls, Dryden and Vermillion Bay on our way to the lodge, are there any good places along the way to stop and get crawlers? I would prefer to buy them after crossing the border, so I don't have to deal with the worm box being inspected. On the subject of bait. Do you think it is cheaper to buy a bunch of minnows at a bait shop rather than the lodge (current rate $2.50 U.S.)?"
