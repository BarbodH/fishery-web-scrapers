537718,jcass,2004-02-26 05:48:00,255,Anyone recommend a camp on Dog Lake near Wawa. Either camping or cabin. With a place I can moor my own boat. Thanks

It's not a luxury resort but they have everything you need for fishing. The fishing is pretty good and there are some smaller lakes around if you feel like a change of pace. I can get you info if you like. There are also a couple of other lodges on Dog Lake as well. Trout

537894,Guest,2004-03-03 06:01:00,0,I live in Wawa and Ernie's is probably your best bet. Dog Lake has excellent fishing. I only fish it a couple of times a year and always get a walleye or two around ten pounds. Also give the lake trout fishing a try it is also excellent.

538510,NavTech,2004-03-29 17:45:00,36,"I stayed there last August at Foxes Den or something of the sort. The Lake trout fishing was fast and almost excellent, the walleye fishing so-so, and a few very nice northerns were landed. All fish caught were very nice indeed. The camp also had some bear hunters and three parties scored 3 bruins. The camp is in need of some updating however we had everything we needed at a pretty reasonable rate. The taxes are what surprised the heck out of us. Up until this trip we roughed it and weren't accustom to paying 50% Ontario taxes and 75% Canadian taxes. Not really, but they were very high. You'll have a good time especially if you're willing to explore the lake. Hope you have a great time if you go. Ron"
538900,Guest,2004-04-15 19:16:00,0,Our group is going to Dog Lake this year for the first time. Staying at Camp Missanabie. Any advice on what to try at that time of year for 'eyes? Troll first with crawler harnesses or rapalas to find the fish? How is the smallmouth bass fishing in this lake? Any chance of catching lake trout in late July without using downriggers? Thanks for the advice.
