I normally bring Canadian $ but this year I'm probably not (the bank I get the $ from gouges you so you really don't come out ahead because I don't buy a lot of Canadian $. Thanks.

538873,fishmaster,2004-04-14 17:32:00,209,Does anyone know if you stay in a motor home in the bush if you can get a regular license? A guy from work states that he goes to Canada and stays in a motor home and they have to get conservation license and can't get a regular license like when you stay at a camp. Any info on this let it be known guys.
538878,Trailerguy,2004-04-14 19:19:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]There is a regulation that basicly states that while you are camping on crown land your limits must be the same as a conservation license. You could easily run afoul of the regulation restricting non-residents from camping on crown land as well, depending on where you are in the bush."
538879,Guest,2004-04-14 19:48:00,0,You can only have in your possesion 2 walleye and 2 northern if you camp in the bush. If you have 2 walleye for breakfast and a warden checks you dont tell him you had walleye for breakfast if you have any in your possesion. That would mean you had 4 walleye in your possesion on that day.
538894,fishmaster,2004-04-15 14:40:00,209,Thanks guys for the info much appreciated and will pass it on to the guys that were asking.
538927,Guest,2004-04-17 06:23:00,0,"I use a credit card to get the best(current) exhange rate when purchasing the license. If you need Canadian dollars like we do to pay the Indians, get that right after you cross the border into Ontario at the duty free place. The do not charge a fee for exchange."
538929,retire55,2004-04-17 07:01:00,1029,"Fishmaster: You need to check the fishing regulations for the province where you plan to fish. The 2004 Ontario Fishing Regulations can be viewed at: http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/fi...nfo_fr2004.pdf On the bottom of page 4, the following is stated: Note: Non-residents camping on Crown lands in Northwestern Ontario must observe conservation licence limits in the following Fishing Divisions: 20, 21, 22, 22A, 24, 31, 33 and 34, except for in the border waters area (see page 72, 78 and 79)."
538934,fishmaster,2004-04-17 18:10:00,209,"Retire55 Thanks for the info. I stay at a camp so it is not a problem for me, this info was for some guys who stay on crown land in a camper. Thanks for the info and the web site directions. Have a good one less than 4 weeks till the opener. Can't wait"
