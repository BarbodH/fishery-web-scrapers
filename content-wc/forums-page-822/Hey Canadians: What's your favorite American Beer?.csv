538864,Guest,2004-04-14 08:09:00,0,"Left Wing, Right wing, they're all corrupt! Lets just enjoy the company, beer, and the fishing! The best beer is the one that makes the walleye look bigger. I couldn't ask for better people to have fun with, I just feel sorry for the spring bear hunters who cannot enjoy the hunt anymore. See you on Lac Seul in May! PS. It sucks having to hide the beer while on the boat! Minnesota Mark"

538270,Guest,2004-03-19 02:47:00,0,"Actually Genny used to promote the fact that it was brewed from water drawn from Hemlock Lake which, by the way, is a beautiful, undeveloped Finger Lake (along with nearby Canadice Lake)and which, thanks to strict regulation, is kept free of boats over 16' and motors over 10 hp. The result is a clean, clear, near wilderness environment in which big Lake Trout, Browns, 'Bows, Smallies and largemouth thrive. No jet skis, no water skiers, no suburbanites with 20' cruisers. Somehow, the Genesee Brewery manages to take all this clean, clear water and carefully turn it into bottled swill. Genny Cream Ale, by the way, is fondly dubbed ""The Green Death"" and has sent many a colon to the scrap yard."

In U.S., I like all the flavors, and in Canada I think that Crystal beer is pretty good. Try that some time! One of my favorite quotes from the movie ""10"" Bartender to Dudley Moore: I think you've had enough! Dudley Moore to Bartender: I want more than enough!"

538234,Guest,2004-03-18 09:56:00,0,"The cold stuff. If I had a choice of cold stuff, it would be Bud Light."
538240,Guest,2004-03-18 11:16:00,0,"phern, I think you mean Genny Cream Ale a/k/a Genesee Cream Ale brewed from the dark, dank, putrid waters of the Genesee River that flows into Ontario near Rochester, NY. I drank my share of Genny too. BTW, Philadelphia Cream is a cheese you put on your bagel."
