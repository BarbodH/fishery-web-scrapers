I was surprized by the potato ban last year and wonder if there is anything new this year. Specifically is beef banned since they found the mad cow disease in the USA. This is a legit post, please don't reply about where your money is spent and whether you are appreciated etc. I love my trips to Canada and survive winter thinking about new adventures in our northern neighbors outdoors. thank you Eric MacDonald"

But the questions were the same as last year, the two she just didn't want to let go of was raw potatos and any meat products?"
538795,Guest,2004-04-13 06:16:00,0,Can't you take meat and potatoes across? We usually take some meat and never have been told we can't.
538801,Trailerguy,2004-04-13 06:57:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Apparently with the mad cow, and avion flu problems in the last year, both sides of the border are restricting meat products going through. Many folk's going to Canada last year had to leave there potatos in the USA due to concerns about potato blight being brought into Canada. Here's a link with the scoop,http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/E/pub/cp/...html#P141_4348 ."

538804,Guest,2004-04-13 07:14:00,0,You can also call the Canada Immigration 807-852-3968. I just called them and they said OK to up to 10#'s of meat per person. I asked about beef and they said OK. The only live bait u can bring is crawlers packed in commercial bedding on soil. No potatoes.
