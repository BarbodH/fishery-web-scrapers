538260,McQ,2004-03-18 18:36:00,615,"Hey everyone - say hello to Alses the man in charge of the management group at the Gouin. Through his and his dedicated teams efforts we are assured of a quality fishery for many years to come. It was one of the best shore lunches i ever had, I didn't say anything about the chef though did I - - - Thanks Alses it was a memorable trip and a great day."
538267,Seanik,2004-03-18 21:10:00,218,"McQ Again thank you for your great Gouin Information, Since Lake Erie Is My home lake and I have been fishing her for over 40 Years I don't appreciate being told to stay off the lake by some one who probably never expierenced 8 foot Lake Erie waves as I have. It's a refreshing change to fish calm waters and changing scenery such as islands and small bays offer."
538273,McQ,2004-03-19 04:54:00,615,"Seanik, that's my exact point - there are waters that can experience great turmoil and I have seen them. In my forty years of fishing many locations across Canada and the United States I have experienced everything from dead flat calms to full scale gales with winds over 80 mph and fully realize that conditions can quickly turn hazardous. I am also aware that in some locales (depending on equipment) even a bit of wind can ruin a days fishing. My point is that there can be differences even on the same body of water, depending on location a trip can be very successful or turn into a dud if or when mother nature elects to display her power. A trip to the wilderness requires due diligence and I enjoy sharing what I know from my experiences, in fact I only respond to situations that I have encountered. I wasn't taking a shot over your bow with my comment about Erie but simply pointing out that there are waves and then there are ""WAVES"". Only our personal exposure to what conditions and situations we encounter are valuable to the folks we share information with, not speculation. I would really enjoy sharing a pot of coffee or a boat with you, compare horror stories and revel in the good times undeniably experienced by each of us."
538274,Guest,2004-03-19 05:39:00,0,"McQ, Retire 55: It would be nice to get ahold of one of those topo maps Retire55, do you have any info on how to purchase one? McQ, any thoughts concerning the wind, and sheltered spots to fish in and around Martin outfitters location? We'll be fishing with the camp boats, I assume they'll be 14' or 16'ers. The adults on our trip are all seasoned (translate: old farts), and used to some rough water....3' waves are not a problem if you use your head and take your time. Any thoughts appreciated!"
538275,McQ,2004-03-19 06:04:00,615,"Baxter, I like the charts put out by Trak Maps - here's a link to their site store, surf the site for various options.http://www.ma-boutique.net/Magasin/trak/c166814.2.html You will need the Clova section of the Gouin if you want a hydrographic chart. Also check with your outfitter, he probably has detailed maps covering his location. Baie Adolphe Poisson is sheltered very well in its configuration, many areas to fish regardless of the weather."
538276,Wawajake,2004-03-19 06:15:00,413,"I have a question for your folks that frequent this reservoir. How much does this lake go up and down thruout the year because of Hydroelectric draw downs. In other words, In spring when reservoir is full, compared to in winter when reservoir draw down at its lowest. The reason I ask is because I fish and cottage on a reservoir in Ontario and want to see if Quebec regulations are better. Here on my reservoir it is 1028 ft above sea level in spring and 995 ft above sea level in winter. Quite a difference eh! its hard on the fish stocks too! If Quebec does it better I want to keep bugging the local MNR to make things better here. let me know what drop occurs at Gouin please? thanks jake"
538279,McQ,2004-03-19 06:57:00,615,"Wawajake, what a great question. I don't have an immediate answer but will do my best to find out. My first offhand observation is that these impoundments are built to supply electrical energy. A fishery that develops as a result is secondary. We often take positions that maybe need to be explained a little bit better. I enjoy the many opportunities that these reservoirs provide us in the pursuit of our fishing passions but at the same time identify with the real world reason why they were built in the first place. Like you I am curious as to how to better manage the two for optimum results having experienced drawdowns of monumental proportions on some of my favorite places in the past. I will say this though, when drawdowns occur the concentration of fishing improves at that point in time and a biologists observations on habitat and spawning effects would be very helpful in determining the future of the fishery. Up in this part of the country a few of the reservoirs are almost completely emptied over the winter and a light spring runoff can and does have a major effect. This is not true of the Gouin but other areas. I am aware of closed fishing seasons over the winter in areas where the fish concentrate in natural lake basins which are the only remaining bodies of water after drawdowns. Some of the reservoirs in the Western United States are affected in a similar manner to provide water for river navigation."

I learned from Quebec government authorities that they do not provide any bathymetric maps of the Gouin Reservoir. To my knowledge, Trak produces the only bathymetric maps for the Gouin. McQ has already provided the Trak web site address. To see the maps you want, select Canada, then Quebec, then Centre of Quebec. Then you'll see that you can order Gouin Reservoir East or Gouin Reservoir West, or both, each at $15.99 USD. Although I don't have either of these maps, they are plastic laminated maps (in colour) with the bathymetric information. Many but not all outfitter locations are depicted. I opted instead to get one map that depicted the entire Gouin Reservoir. It is easier for me to get a handle on the spatial arrangement of things if I can view it all at once. The NTS number for this map is 32 B. If this map is unavailable where you live, it can easily be ordered on-line from World of Maps - see http://www.worldofmaps.com/ Their email address as well as a toll free telephone number are provided under ""contact us"".

538705,saphauler,2004-04-08 22:16:00,3,"Baxter, The senneterre route is better for several reasons. We fish near Martins and tried the new road a couple years ago. Did not like it, to long on gravel and lots of speedsters both directions. Also if you plan on staying overnight, Senneterre is a nice town and has good eats and motels. Probably take you 3 1/2 to 5 hours to get to Martins from Senneterre if you go at a reasonable speed."

538882,Guest,2004-04-14 21:11:00,0,"Hi, first of all, i'm basically French speaking, so please don't look at my english, i'll try to do my best. Did you even consider the boathouse option available with many outfitters on the Gouin? As residents of Quebec, we fish, the previous years, in many of the lakes and reservoirs of the ""public territory"" (free of access for everyone) but we had to carry fifthwheels and boats. A couple of years ago, we take a reservation for a boat house on the Gouin and we really loved it. They include a 16 foot fiberglass boat with a 15 hp for each 2 fisherman that you carry behind your boathouse. We found that there's some big advantages: instead of always fishing the same spots, you could fish a bit then, in the afternoon, drive a couple of hours with the boathouse and doing it again. It allow you to fish some remote areas (you know...it's always better far away;)...) And you could discover some really nice places and beaches to land your boathouse and have a lunch. I recommend it for everyone, you'll love it !!!"

538902,Andre M,2004-04-16 04:18:00,86,You are absolutly right. What is was referring is a house boat.
538903,McQ,2004-04-16 05:36:00,615,There are many outfitters on the Gouin that offer houseboat packages as well as standard cabin packages for fishing trips. I am encouraging a few of them to advertise with us here on the business directory. A houseboat vacation provides an opportunity to fish many different areas throughout a vacation stay and is a great way to get into some of the bays and remain remote for your entire stay.
538305,Guest,2004-03-19 23:03:00,0,"thanks to you both for info on drawdowns. I know on my reservoir the prime spawning area (where current exists) is almost dry if the Hydro managers are still filling up reservoirs further down stream, in spring.

The location map that our outfitter provides on their website shows two alternate routes to arrive at Martin outfitters. We're leaving from the northern NY border area and proceeding thru Ottawa, then up Rt. 105 to the intersection -w- Rt. 117 just north of Maniwaki. There we have a choice to make.....any input appreciated! We can either then proceed northwesterly up Rt. 117 to Louvicourt, then up Rt 113 to Senneterre....this appears to be paved road for that distance.....then we'd bear east on RO806to Paradis and Gagnon Landing, then in on a small dirt road to Martins. Though a longer distance, this route looks to be faster in that it's paved all the way to Senneterre. The alternate route would be to bear east at the intersection of 105 and 117, and proceed to Mont-Laurier, then north on Rt. 309 to Mt. St. Michel....from there head north on R1502 to Parent (this long section appears to be gravel?) .....then west on RO806 to Oskelando, then North on a small dirt road to Martins. Shorter distance but rougher roads? We're Adirondackers accustomed to driving dirt/gravel roads, and will be driving heavily loaded SUV's....any thoughts on the alternate routes appreciated! Should we ever cross paths, I insist on beverages and a BBQ ....on me! This website rules."
538374,McQ,2004-03-22 08:03:00,615,"Baxter, the Senneterre route should be your choice. Much less gravel to travel and for accessing the Baie Adolphe Poisson section of the Gouin is by far the best access. For those selecting lodges from Baie de Sud east then the Mont Laurier - Parent route is the best way to go. For extreme eastern access such as the dam area then consider coming in from La Toque."

538417,McQ,2004-03-23 14:17:00,615,"Well here's how the summers shaping up so far. I go in to Club Rudy on the 19th of May for a few days of trout fishing - head to the Gouin on the 22nd for a bit of time at Riviere Nemio. Then it's back out for work and I've got a lucky winner from the ice fishing contest out on June 6th for a day of Walleye fishing on the Ottawa River. Head up to Chibougamou on June 30th for the James Bay walleye tournament at Chapais and on July 5th I'm into Wetetnagami Outfitter (Senneterre) for some R & R chasing Walleye and Big Northerns. Of course there's the GGSC trip into the Gouin in August at Oasis and somewhere in between all that activity I have to plan some time for the far north and at least one trip north east of Quebec City. So Baxter if I get to Baie Adlophe be sure to have an extra steak with you cause this busy fisherman is gonna be hungry, don't let Alses get too far ahead of me on the menu."

538432,Guest,2004-03-24 07:30:00,0,Andre M: Since you travel to Gouin pretty often you would know. Would you chance towing an 18 ft. boat and trailer with 115 & kicker on the back? I love to fish from my boat but don't want to damage it if the road is bad.
538433,Guest,2004-03-24 08:51:00,0,"Depending on how well you know the Gouin, your chances of damaging your boat are greater on the Gouin than going to the Gouin. If you know the area where you are going very well, then wrap your boat with a blue tarp and bring it up, that will take care of it, as for the trailer, think about spare tire (2), you never know"

We have to work out some scheduling to settle on an exact date,old geezers always have appointments for body parts repair, new teeth, ect. We also have scheduled a July fishing trip to Alaska for Halibut and Salmon, but I personally am more excited about the Gouin Trip. We live on the shore of Lake Erie and are expierenced big water fishermen. One reason we fish Northern Canada is the Lakes have many islands, protected bays and we can safely fish every day. The question I have, is there many islands and protected bays on the Gouin Reservoir or is there large areas of open water that would be rough on windy days?"

There are 5 double rooms in the lodge with private facilities and showers. These rooms would idealy suit couples. There are up to 5 log cabins accomodating 4 people each with indoor facilities - common showers in the lodge. We are restricted to 24 people simply because that is the capacity of the dining room.

A lot depends on the size of your boat and your motor,too."

Based solely on amount of protected water, the Walleye Club would be your choice, IMHO. There are many more small islands in the vicinity of this camp as compared to Oasis du Gouin. The water around both camps runs generally north/south with ample opportunity to travel for miles and miles. The information I heard at the Gatineau, Quebec Outfitter Show (attended by more than a dozen of the 28 outfitters operating on the Gouin) was that the wind can blow at a pretty good clip on the reservoir and it generally blows from the north west. I emphasize that I haven't been to either camp location and that I'm just relating what I see on the map. Jay"
538252,McQ,2004-03-18 17:07:00,615,"I've been to both places, in fact helped the original owner build La Point A Dore (Walleye Club) - having spent more time there than L'Oasis, here are a few of my observations regarding wind. Winds from the west are prevalent, winds from the south usually indicate a system change and the next day can be horrendous, over a period of ten years I have only once been in a situation where I had to beach the 10 hsp. - 16' vercheres boat and ride out the storm sitting on shore. Was at L'Oasis twice last year mid July and mid August, had wind on both trips, spent an extra 15 minutes getting back to camp one day in three footers using a camp boat 16' - 15 hsp. while crossing the largest opening to the North West of the camp. On our second trip up we made a 106 mile round trip tour of the Gouin in variable winds up to 35 mph crossing the largest expanses of open water up there. While caution was called for there was never a time when we dropped below 25 MPH in our own 17' Princecraft.. Both camps are worthwhile considering, L'Oasis offers a bit more of the amenities. Fishing can be great at either spot and there is ample choice of waters (bad weather) to fish at L'Oasis not so much at La Pointe A Dore, simply because of the main camp location. If you're worried about wind then stay off of Lake Erie, the Gouin can kick up but it's truly not that bad a scene and severe weather is rare."
538254,Seanik,2004-03-18 17:27:00,218,"Thanks Jay, Your topo map information will smooth out our trip. We are occasional jig fisherman, but mostly we find a spot with a little current and dunk leeches through slip sinkers. This lazyman method usually does well on walleye and Pike. The trip is slowly getting organized, we are looking at van rental prices and I know it's early but we are looking for a good place to buy leeches on the way through Ottawa and up to the Gouin Reservoir. We bought leeches in Manawaki on our way to Lac Berthelot last year at 3.85 Ca. per dozen. I believe some bait dealers sell them by the pound, any information would be appreciated. I kind of like fishing with the little bloodsuckers."
538256,Guest,2004-03-18 17:55:00,0,"Ans I will see all of you guys there next summer. As McQ stated both places offers great oportunities, La Pointe aux Doré has the best protection against big wind due to the land configuration and the orientation of the Baie du Sud,the Oasis du Gouin has three big bodies of water, the Marmette, the Chapman and the south Magnan which can be mean in bad weather, but it is also a great place for walleyes, specialy on the rocky point north west of the Oasis main camp. Also McQ mentioned that he had one of the best shore lunch last year....thanks Bill, you never mentioned this before. Au revoir!"
538192,Preacherman,2004-03-16 15:18:00,2,"I was just wondering if anybody has ever fished the Gouin Reservoir in Quebec? If anyone has, how did you make out? Give me some details! I'll be heading up there in Aug., so any tips would be appreciated!"
538196,Andre M,2004-03-16 17:09:00,86,"Hey! asking about the fishing at the reservoir Gouin. Just fabulous, can't get any better. Actually last Sunday we ate our last fillets,wife, son & I. I fish the Gouin 3-4 times per season and can't tell the best time 'cause it's always good. Even when the fishing is slow (cold front) I manage to catch fishs and have fun. For my part, jigging is the way to go but I know others that are only using crankbaits and they are succesful too. Always be ready for the big pikes they are in numbers and can be everywhere even in 20-30 feet of water. I'm sure you will be delightful with you're trip and also meeting with people in Quebec are something to discover. It is your first time in Quebec?"
538203,Guest,2004-03-17 06:36:00,0,"This will be the third time I've fished in Quebec. Once we fished LaVerde Park about 20 years ago. Then about 10 years ago,we fished the outskirts of the western basin of the Gouin."
538205,McQ,2004-03-17 08:32:00,615,"The Gouin Reservoir has been a favorite destination of mine for the past 15 years. Fished out of many of the lodges and the one consistent is the fishing has been great everywhere I chose to float my boat. The reservoir lends itself to many different tactics and the structural elements will vary from bay to bay. If you want bigger fish then troll cranks around mid-lake shoals during August. The big gals are out there chasing whitefish schools and the results can be spectacular. Remember the 17 & 18 ""ers are better eating and have probably spawned at least once - save the gene pool - C & R. Expect to meet up with Northerns anywhere you may be dunking a worm, they grow them big there too."
538207,Guest,2004-03-17 12:15:00,0,"McQ- I'm heading to the Gouin in mid-July....a father and son trip with my twin boys (age 14) and two other Dads and their sons. We're staying with Martin Outfitters, from the maps it looks like we'll be located toward the western arm of the reservoir. We're pretty diehard Eye fisherman, and fish most often with crawlers and worm harnesses, bouncing bottom. But we also have been sucessful doing evening trolls with crankbaits (though in August not July) over deeper water. Any suggestions for us to try??? I want this trip to be one to remember for the boys! Thanks!"
538208,McQ,2004-03-17 12:43:00,615,"First off Baxter, you've chosen a great place to go - Pete is one of the best hosts imaginable. The location is super and the whole atmosphere is deep woods. The fishing is awesome at that end of the reservoir with many options open to you. Bottom bouncing harnesses and jigging is probably all you will need to do. Use orange & charteuse colors primarily, have some gold blades available too. Jig with curly tails and if you get a chance to pick up some of the new Berkley GULP nightcrawlers - they perform well on the harnesses. By the time you make your trip I will have been in and out a few times. Stay tuned for the reports closer to your date. Have fun and I know the boys will have the time of their lives."
538210,Guest,2004-03-17 13:13:00,0,"Thanks McQ !! I've done some homework (a lot of it here on this fantastic site) to come up with this location/outfitter, glad to hear your endorsement. My sons have been fishing walleye with me since they were 6 yrs. old....started em off in diapers with panfish. We just can't wait for this trip! You mentioned jigs -w- curly tails....any particular color for the curly tails....or the same colors as for the crawler harnesses? We're hoping to do some damage with crankbaits, trolling flatline, as we do on our summer vacation week. Thanks again, I sure do appreciate your response."
538211,McQ,2004-03-17 13:28:00,615,"Baxter, last year we had a day trip into the top of Lac du Male which is the bay to the north and east of where you are. On that day we were eight guys throwing jigs and trying to pick a color that wouldn't catch fish. It really didn't matter, we all boated our limit and had one of the most amazing shore lunches in my memory. Basic colors in curlys - orange, chartreuse & white, Berkley power leech in pumpkin or black, Lunker City 4"" finesse fish in black/gold fleck will cover off the body styles and colors - jig heads 1/8, 1/4 & 3/8 in orange, chartreuse & black. When long lining I prefer the Hot n Tot in Black over Gold and often I'll rig a Bagley's Top Gun in rainbow behind a bouncer. Pike love Johnson Silver Minnows, cast or troll with them - I take gold and silver with me in all sizes. Remember to sharpen the hooks out of the package."
538214,phern,2004-03-17 13:53:00,151,"All I can say is that if this is your first visit, your group is going to have fun. Walleye and pike fishing does not slow down during the summer in Quebec because the cooler temperatures ensures that the water remains cool. All the techniques work great. In the evening, and early morning, the walleye come right into the shallow water and can be caught on jigs or shallow running minnow imitations. During the day, you can do some bottom bouncing or trolling crank baits near structure. The Gouin reservoir was formed in the early 1920s following the building of hydro-electric dams so you can imagine that the name of the lake is ""structure"". There are over 3,500 miles of coastline to fish. This does not include the coastlines of the islands. The Gouin Reservoir is a special place. This whole area is managed by a non-profit organisation called ""Corporation de gestion du Réservoir Gouin"" with the prime objective of conserving and protecting this 1,800 square kilometer reservoir for the future. 1/3 of the administrators must be fishermen who fish the Gouin Reservoir. This year, the reservoir will be in great shape....the water levels will be normal so the quality of fishing will be excellent all summer. It was -20 degrees celcius last night and will drop down to that temperature again tonight. In mid July, sun-up is around 4:30 and sun-down is a bit after 8 p.m. Here is a link for weather conditions in that area : http://meteo.ec.gc.ca/forecast/city_e.html?qc-a1&unit=i"
538225,Guest,2004-03-18 05:11:00,0,Many thanks for all the info guys.....people like you make this is such a great website! I promise to post a report upon our return from the Gouin.
