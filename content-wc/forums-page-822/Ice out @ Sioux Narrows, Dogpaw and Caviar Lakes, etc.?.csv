538857,downriverbob,2004-04-14 05:36:00,880,"I talked to the people where we stay, Sanctuary Resort on Whitefish Bay, the owner lives on Snake Bay during the winter months. They stated that the snow had melted off the ice but they had colder temperatures at night and they didn't expect the ice to come off till after the second week in May. If I remember right the ice was off about May 6th last year. The water level was a little above normal as of last week."

538884,Guest,2004-04-15 05:41:00,0,"Thanks Darcy! I didn't realize that there was a significant current in Caviar/Dogpaw. Looking forward to your weekend news. I'm thinking of an ice-out canoe trip into Dogpaw, Caviar and Flint, and perhaps a check of the portages into Waterfall and Atikwa (for later). So I'm most curious, I guess, as to whether there'd be sufficient open water around the shorelines to go in on the 24th, grab a quick campsite somewhere in the middle of Caviar (north shore), and fish for lakers (and pike?) while ""watchin' the rest melt."" I've never travelled the ""rapids"" between Dogpaw and Caviar, but assume there's a portage there, if necessary. What's the water flow like there in early spring with the runoff from the melt? Would I be able even to approach this area before full ice-out? If not, how practical might it be to go in on the 24th, putter around at a campsite on Dogpaw, and spend the second week on Caviar? Many islands or shoreline spots to camp, on Dogpaw? Thanks again for your offer of help, Joe"

I can't answer your question regarding if there would be sufficient ice out to travel around Dogpaw in April. There really is no rapids between Dogpaw and Caviar. It's just a flow. Jim's camp owners have reported difficulty navigating their big barge through the passage because of flow. There is not a portage. This area is Â¼ mile wide. There are many spots on both Dogpaw and Caviar that could be used for primitive camping provided that you're a Canuck. In summary, I would caution you against going canoeing at that time of the year. Just think if you encountered some rough water and capsized. That water is very cold. And, most likely there wouldn't be anyone around for two or three weeks. Also, keep in mind that these are lake trout waters. Very deep so they won't warm up and thaw quickly."
538959,Guest,2004-04-18 18:46:00,0,"Just got back and its going on the shoreline a bit but still a ways to go, was raining a good part of the day so that will be good and temps are suppose to be on the plus side.As far as being out there on the 24th ,tuff call .I can give you a message in a couple of days to see if any improvement."
