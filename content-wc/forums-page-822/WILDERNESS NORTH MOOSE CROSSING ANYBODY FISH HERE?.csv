We choose one day of our trip and take the more than 2 hour boat trip to Moose Crossing for the the day. While I haven't fished anywhere in the area other than the crossing, the fishing is spectacular. I have seen the cabin and area you will be staying at and I would not hesitate booking this site myself. We go up opening week and the fish are in the shallow gravel areas spawning or in post spawn and hit anything you throw at them. You will enjoy this area."
