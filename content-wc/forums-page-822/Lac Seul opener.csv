538650,Guest,2004-04-05 21:02:00,0,"Hey, What's this I hear about someone choking on fish. You may need to call someone for that hind lick manuever to save your life. As long as we are on the topic of fish, I had some dandy crappie the other night from Upper Red Lake. Did you get in on them too Rich? I still have a few nice perch in the freezer and I think if I dig down deep I might have a walleye or two. Ummmmmmm, they taste good 2 dogs. Mr. B. You must have made it out on the ice or did you dangle over the end of the dock and drill a hole in the ice there? I'm working real hard down here to get that honey do list shortened up, but things keeps showing up at the bottom as fast as I finish the top. I think I need to start at the bottom."
538654,Guest,2004-04-06 06:53:00,0,"We were out on a local bush lake, the cove may not have enough water under ice for fishing. Got stuck as usual and waited till the moon rose before the bite started, was over in 45 minutes. Great time though. Spring seems to keep teasing us but we should have a good runoff if the weather warms up; water looks about as low as last year for those wondering about Lac Seul, hope for runoff and rain, the dam has slowed the spill a bit the past 10 days."
538655,Guest,2004-04-06 07:56:00,0,"Curious as to how much ice and snow you have up there yet? Will Lac Seul be ice out for opener? Here in central Minnesota we have no snow and the lake ice is getting very dark, ready to go out in next week or so from the way they are looking. Thanks, Lonnie"
538664,Guest,2004-04-06 19:45:00,0,"We've got about 2' of ice under about 6-8"" of slush ice, great melt today with warm temps and wind, have 4-12"" of snow depending where you look. Expect the usual Mother's day ice out if weather patterns hold and good but not great water levels if we get to keep the runoff."
538703,lunker99,2004-04-08 19:40:00,236,"Gary, is it true that they're going to keep the winnesauga area closed later than normal this year? If so, why and when will be the opening date?"
538704,Guest,2004-04-08 19:45:00,0,I just recieved email from my outfitter on Lac seul and the Wenesaga river will open June 1
538712,Guest,2004-04-09 07:18:00,0,"The Wenasaga Sancuary and all other areas will now have a common closing and opening to make ""enforcement easier""; this is the MNR's view point. They will close on the 15th of April and open the 15th of June. The MNR has informed us that this year will be a "" non-enforcement "" year at the Wenasaga to allow for the public to learn the new dates. The dates were changed in the regulations, which were published late this year' and the local CO was a bit taken back at the "" no enforcement"" announcement from Sioux Lookout. As you may tell from my comments, I disagree and personally feel that a 5 June opening would have be sufficient, but the MNR has almost a punitive attitude towards the Ear Falls Outfitters and claims we are "" overharvesting the lake"" and that extended dates will save fish. What we need is a larger slot to protect spawners, protection for the Celt Creek spawning area, protection at Broad and Sunlight Lakes, and for the MNR to conduct the promissed Walleye Index studies to use real scientific info to base their decisions on."
538731,2 DOGS,2004-04-09 16:02:00,361,"As a non-resident, who has been fishing Lac Seul since 1998,I would agree whole-heartedly on increasing the slot for Lac Seul. I'd personally like to see the walleye slot from 17"" to 32"". Keep all you catch over 32"". Those needing something to hang on the wall, take pictures and measurements quickly, release them, then have a replica made. Then you wouldn't have to worry so much about sanctuaries, boundaries, and enforcement would be extremely easy."
538733,lunker99,2004-04-09 17:27:00,236,Thanks for the info Gary.
538941,Guest,2004-04-17 20:47:00,0,"I say just in time I have 50 /50 blue ice and slush for a total of 12 "" in front of my house !"
538610,Guest,2004-04-02 12:45:00,0,"Hey 2 dogs, I really enjoyed the picture of the new Kitchen you sent me. My wife wants one just like it. (I wish) I suppose you won't let me in it at all this year. Mr. B's shooting must have improved over the winter. He was just a little rusty in the fall. (and me) See you in the middle of June. Wishin' I was fishin'"
538614,2 DOGS,2004-04-02 16:34:00,361,"RE: The shooting - Ol Fred would have shook his head and just said ""Pit-ti-full, you guys are just pathetic""! And we were, I think it must have been the Mexican shells. Not only do they give you fewer shells in a box, but most don't have any shot in them. Only birds I've seen with a reverse. Boat was completed today, now the wait for the motor! Before you or Berdsley gets in it we have lessons on how to kill a fish. We don't use the compartment doors, or be sure you have your lifevest fastened!! There have already been long talks with my better half on the landing of northerns. Naturally, she listened!"
538622,Guest,2004-04-03 19:05:00,0,"Why, 2dogs, I don't know what you are talking about. Using compartment doors to kill fish and all. (hee,hee,hee) And that part about landing northerns, I usually don't get the chance to get them close to the boat. If you insist on a class, I will promise to be on my best behavior. I made the annual journey to Mitchell S.D. today to the Cabellas store. I bought 50 of their cheapest jigs to throw to the northern gods in Lac Seul. If I throw one handful in the lake each day I fish, it might please the gods, and they will allow me to catch a walleye. If the Mrs. starts to miss the feel of aluminum cutting through the water and the sound of rivets skimming across the lake, she can fish with me. (hee,hee,hee) Wishin' I was fishin'"
538629,2 DOGS,2004-04-04 08:46:00,361,"Ya, she's already complaining about the lack of those grey flames behind the rivets and the sight of the floor moving one direction and the sides another. What she's really gonna miss is the annual trek to the factory to have it fixed. Those were always fun-filled, action packed days. All of those wonderful experiences can be yours just by going farther than Goose Island. lol"
538637,Rich J,2004-04-04 21:40:00,65,"Its her kitchen, I would think she would get to be the first to christen that new carpet with some good old northern slime. Probably have to put everything in a zip lock before you use the fish billy on it."
538638,2 DOGS,2004-04-04 22:12:00,361,"That idea of the zip lock certainly has merit but for the size of my fish it'd probably take the 33 gal size. lol Since you're gonna be there first, how about marking all the rock piles!! Some of those places we couldn't get to last year, does that mean twice as many fish there this year?"
538641,Guest,2004-04-05 09:42:00,0,"You guys can carry on all you want about them million dollar boats and how many rock there will or will not be, but I got a mess of fresh walleye caught in the moon light last night that are going to taste pretty darned good. So while you pine away about great days to come just think how Mama B's fixen's are going to taste with them, something about cheesy potatoes, cold slaw and her famous beans!"
538644,2 DOGS,2004-04-05 12:22:00,361,"There is life at the old Evergreen Lodge! My stomach is growling from reading your post, that's pretty unfair ya know. The boat, well I'm just trying to keep up with the guys and their custom made wooden yachts. What's with the going fishing after dark, have to sneak up on them? You always told me there was no night bite."
538648,Rich J,2004-04-05 15:48:00,65,"He didn't tell you that there wasn't a slot on them Mexican doves either. Thats pretty low considering we have to make due with a mess of Crappie we picked up this weekend, on second thought maybe thats not all bad. I am looking forward to some fresh Walleye, won't be long now."
538649,2 DOGS,2004-04-05 17:05:00,361,Not to wish you fellas any bad luck but I HOPE YOU CHOKE ON YOUR FRESH FISH!!!!!
538529,Guest,2004-03-30 11:39:00,0,"I realize we are still a month and a half away from opener but I am wondering about opener up on Lac Seul. What do you guys think, is the ice gonna be gone on Lac Seul by opener? We fish Sioux Lookout area, my brother in law goes to Ear Falls area. Thanks, Lonnie"
538530,2 DOGS,2004-03-30 12:17:00,361,"Ice is gonna be gone by the 9th of May. While chances of my being there for opener are very slim (waiting on new boat), I will be thinking of Rich and Jim pulling in all the good ones with the help of their super guide Mr. B Go get'em boys!"
538543,Rich J,2004-03-30 18:29:00,65,"Went and did it huh! If its decent weather we will get both Mr and Mrs B out some. I hope ice is out by the 9th we will be there the 10th. See you in August, can't wait to see the new boat. Rich J"
538544,Guest,2004-03-30 19:01:00,0,"Right now, I would say ice-out about May 1-5. More weather like this past week should help."
538556,2 DOGS,2004-03-31 12:02:00,361,"Yep, gonna be fishin out of Momma's new kitchen. Save some of those with the white spot on the tail for me. Be careful taking Patti, I've heard she gets seasick!!!!!!"

He didn't tell me there wasn't a slot on them, so I deliberately kept missing the small ones."
