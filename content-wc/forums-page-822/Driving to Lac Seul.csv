Highway 71 to Highway 17 to Vermillion Bay or shoot up 502? The last time I took 502 it was in pretty rough shape, going was pretty slow because of the road condition and all the tight turns. I though it might be faster up 71 because I could cruise at a higher speed."
538679,rebelrn2001,2004-04-07 16:36:00,1563,502 isn't bad now. They repaved it over the past couple years. Some spots aren't the best but that is the way we always take.
538681,Guest,2004-04-07 17:03:00,0,"502 was pretty good last year. Also, Dryden is a good place for groceries. There's a great Safeway in town,"

538683,Trailerguy,2004-04-07 19:03:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]I'll be going up 502 this weekend to do a little trout fishing. I'll let you know how it is next week.
538694,Walleye_Slayer,2004-04-08 06:34:00,134,MY RECCOMENDATION IS UP 71 IF YOU ARE TRAVELING AT NIGHT. LITTLE MORE TRAFFIC IF YOU BREAK DOWN. ALSO WATCH 107 UP TO EAR FALLS THAT HAS BEEN THE WORST ROAD FOR MOOSE THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND THE WHITETAILS HAVE REALLY GONE NUTS UP THERE A Bad Day Fishing is Better than the Best Day at Work Best Reguards Walleye_Slayer
538783,Trailerguy,2004-04-12 19:07:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I went up hwy 502 last weekend, it is unchanged from last year. One strech about 20k long is patched the rest is new and smooth. Hwy 105 as far as Perrault Falls is also smooth sailing. How ever the OPP have been working hard lately. Local reports indicate the OPP post in Soiux Narrows,over on Hwy 71, love to hide up the side roads and use their radar guns to collect doughnut money,lol. :)"
538872,Brax,2004-04-14 14:15:00,52,"Thanks for the report, looks like 502 is the way to go. We will be passing through mid morning, so I think there would be help if I had a breakdown."
