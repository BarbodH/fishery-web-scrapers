I hope the Pike are ready to be outsmarted by us this year.....along with the Walleyes and Lakers. I am looking forward to getting up there and getting on the water and drinking some beer around the campfire, lol. Reed Lake watch out! :-) Hope to catch you up there Dave, maybe we can help you throw up that new cabin..... Kilroy"
