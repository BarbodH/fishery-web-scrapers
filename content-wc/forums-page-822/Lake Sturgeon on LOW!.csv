538114,Guest,2004-03-12 01:42:00,0,Well I dont know what LOW is but If its Lake Of The Woods then I have caught lots of them. Its still cold up here but the River is open already and we are fishing for them already. One trip out and we had 23 with the biggest being 96lbs. If you want to see some pics or want to come up for a guided trip for them email me at.[email protected] Mike

538855,Guest,2004-04-14 04:34:00,0,96 lbs? Who's scale was that put on? or was it just a guess? That 67 inch fish has sure grown.
