Will be headed in a different direction so not familiar with the area. As long as its clean with a restaurant close by. Thanks, John"

No restaurant in Nakina but a fry truck just opened up with a good menu and she even does a breakfast on the run, hope she does well that town needs some kind of food service. In geraldton you have the crown & anchor which is both a motel and eatery, never stayed there but I have had breakfast which was good."

They have, as I recall, a typical hotel breakfast that is included. Or you can get donuts and some other breakfast items across the street at Robinâ€™s Donuts. We actually prefer the Crown and Anchor because it puts us a bit closer to Nakina and there is a pretty good little restaurant on site."

6337160,TitanD,2019-07-02 19:31:00,43,We overnighted at Lower Twin Lakes Camp in June. I think $40 guy. It was nothing fancy but comfortable and relatively close to Nakina float plane base. Not much for eating establishments up that way. Good Luck
