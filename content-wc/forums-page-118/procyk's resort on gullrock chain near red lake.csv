6336036,law57,2019-06-30 08:23:00,1147,Jim - I have a friend who will be at his cabin tomorrow. I think he and his buddies fish Gull Rock. I'll find out and report back. North of Kenora? Umpfreville Lake?
6336118,valley366,2019-06-30 13:05:00,193,We have stayed at Five Lakes Lodge in June the last 2 years. Never been there in September so can't provide anything about that time of year.From what I know Procyk's is located in Two Island Lake. They say it warms up faster and benefits from Walleyes migrating to the River for the spawn and it holds the early season fish. We fished Two Island Lake 4 out of the 7 days we fished and had our best luck there.From Five Lakes Lodge in the SW corner of Gullrock to Two Island Lake it took us about 30 minutes going around 25MPH. You would not be going that far.I would search reports on here as there are a lot of them. I know there was a group that fished that chain last fall that had a report on them.Good luck.

6338108,sagecreek,2019-07-06 07:41:00,24,"having lived on gullrock for the past 28 years I can tell you that the fishing , generally, in September is good, the presentations may change up from the summer, the fish become a little more less active so your bait has to be less active too. as far as travelling to red lake from two island, it is going to take you longer than an hour, it takes me 1/2 hour in my boat with a 150 on it. BUT, you don't need to go that far . the only thing red lake has to offer that gullrock, keg and two island don't is lake trout, and they are protected , you can fish for them but they are strictly a catch and release species. September fish are usually bigger than the summer fish, don't know why , just seems that way, whatever you do, enjoy yourselves and stay safe, wear a life jacket , don't drink alcohol in the boat and try Iowa point, fishermans point and the gull rock. Ask Mike to mark up a map for you."
