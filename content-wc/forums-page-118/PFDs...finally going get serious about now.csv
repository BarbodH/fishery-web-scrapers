(I'm worth that much, just in entertainment value.) Changed mine last spring, and just for grins I tossed the old one in the swimming pool. It sent up a fine bubble of gas (CO2?). I'm fine with that, but you're welcome to wear a big old orange kapok from Navy surplus if that makes you feel safer."

6337548,Huntindave,2019-07-04 07:45:00,2194,"Apparently you do not understand that when the ""pill"" dissolves, that is the point in time in which the vest will inflate. The mechanism is built such that the presence of the undissolved pill is the only thing preventing the vest from inflating. If the pill prematurely dissolves or otherwise disintegrates , the spring will immediately puncture the CO2 cartridge, immediately inflating the vest. The Halkey Roberts Automatic system activates when a salt bobbin gets in contact with water. When the bobbin is in contact with water, it dissolves, allowing a spring to be released which pushes a plunger forward, in turn forcing a cutter into the CO2 cylinder. The cutter allows the CO2 to travel through the CO2 gas hole in the inflator head and inflate the lifejacket. The Automatic system is backed up by a manual override, which allows the user to pull the toggle and inflate the lifejacket. All lifejackets also have a third oral inflation tube."
6333598,David Anderson,2019-06-22 22:11:00,2073,"As I get older I know that I would have a hard time staying afloat these days and given the fact that I am more unstable, I wear an Onyx A24 100% of the time when I am in the boat. Usually I end up wearing it up to the cabin as I tend to forget it's even on. I have an inflatable as well as standard life jackets for everyone in the boat however I warn them that if they fall in without a jacket they are crazy if they think I'm jumping in to rescue them. I did and experiment, had an inflatable belt, regular jacket and my Onyx A24 over at my friends pool. The belt was a manual type and when I jumped into the deep end, went to the bottom before pulling the cord. I shot up to the surface but had to put my head through it otherwise it was worthless. The regular jacket worked well however I jumped in with the Automatic inflatable and it was amazing as I shot up to the surface with my face up, definitely a lot more buoyancy than the standard. In addition I bought a wireless Man Over Board system as I have to remind myself to hook up the emergency tether for the motor as it's too easy just to start the motor and leave."
6333668,Lmbkiller,2019-06-23 07:24:00,639,"For my job I have to wear a pfd daily when on water.. I can swim just fine, I wear an autoinflate. Some of the other guys I work with could drown in a mud puddle, they wear regular pfd's as they don't trust the inflatables. For those of u putting your life into the hands of a small white pill and a co2 cartridge like me, I hope u can swim at least a little or be able to tread water. Obviously if you're unconscious it doesn't matter. To the people that really âtrustâ the autoinflates I suggest looking/replacing the arming kit inside the vest and u will see how simple it could be to have it fail. My advice is if can't swim wear a regular pfd"
6333726,That Minnesota guy,2019-06-23 10:21:00,8293,I use the full Sterns vest with the padded collar. Don't know that it matters what style you use as long as you wear one.
6333744,eyecatcher1,2019-06-23 10:58:00,323,Since I am getting older too and have heard of a couple of accidents this year I have started wearing mine too. I have the Cabela's 3500s. 11 years ago I was in a motorcycle accident and after had to explain how I got a fractured skull when I had a good helmet. I wasn't wearing it. I've decided that my family won't have to explain how I drowned when I had $500 worth of self inflating PFDs in the boat.
6335266,Rich D,2019-06-27 16:44:00,75,"Having fallen out of my boat when a seat bracket broke, I wear an inflatable all the time now. I recommend one. I'll also suggest that you look into a fold down ladder for your boat if it isn't equipped with one. It's very very difficult to climb into a boat when you can't touch the bottom."
6335330,richg99,2019-06-27 19:02:00,35,"re your ""balance issues"". I am 79. I launch and recover my 17 ft. tinny two or three times a week, 9 or more months out of every year. For the last 5 or more years, I have had dizziness issues. It normally occurred when I bent down to cleat the boat onto the dock or bent down to pick up a golf ball in the cup. It got worse. I contacted my doctor and he removed one medication from my short list. It happened to be Hydrochlorothiazide. Turns out that a lot of we older guys are taking some sort of a diuretic, which is what the Hydrochlorothiazide was. In the last three weeks, I have only ONE dizzy episode. A simple change of meds made a major difference in how safe I feel on my boat and the dock. You might want to check with your doctor to see if he can suggest anything."
6335368,Baseline,2019-06-27 21:11:00,3207,There are lots of good PFD's and opinions about them. I personally like my sterns vest type. One other item you should purchase is an emergency 2 or 3 step rope ladder that has a deploy line attached so you can get back in the boat.
6336782,BlackSilver,2019-07-01 20:52:00,1282,"I'm 79, so I understand all about balance, slow reaction, and all that old guy stuff. My PFD is on before I start the engine, and the kill-lanyard is attached ALWAYS when I'm at the helm. I have a Mustang Survival brand, auto inflate (or jerk the cord if you're still conscious when you hit the water). Yes, it's pricey. But it's so light and comfortable, you actually forget that you're wearing it. Once walked into a restaurant about 40 miles from the lake, still wearing it! Reliability? USCG wears them. 'Nuf said."
6336958,Huntindave,2019-07-02 09:35:00,2194,"Please explain how the unit would fail to function. What exactly is poorly designed? What specific changes would you like to see implemented, to improve the design?"
6337144,Lmbkiller,2019-07-02 18:14:00,639,"Pretty simple, white pill dissolves for whatever reason, life vest doesn't inflate when u go overboard. I about guarantee that's the model that 99% of people on here have. The hydrostatic ones are better, they are also $300ish"
6333470,bigcreekdad,2019-06-22 08:29:00,74,"I always have an ordinary PFD attached to me seat on my tiller boat. Handy,,,but never worn. I often fish by myself. I'm now 71, and often have balance issues. AS such, I need to get serious about safety. I'm looking for a very good PFD that is comfortable, but I'm not sure I want the inflatable type. Any suggestions? Thanks"
6333474,fishin10,2019-06-22 09:15:00,2315,"Nothing wrong with a inflatable at all. If you would have a episode and fall out of the boat, you want something that will keep your head above the surface, a regular vest will not do that. I wear mine every second I'm on the water and tell my passengers they WILL wear theirs. I have 2 mid range priced auto inflatables and will be purchasing 2 more very soon to replace the regular vests my passengers wear.."
6333476,martinbns,2019-06-22 09:20:00,1520,I use the Cabelas Guidewear 3500 series and my wife has the newer 4000 model. They are very easy to wear and work well.
6333482,BornToFish,2019-06-22 09:53:00,1224,"Greetings, I purchased a Cabela's Full Motion series PFD a few years ago. I am able to wear it all day, except on the very hottest of days. I like it when casting for northerns and muskies as it does not interfere with my casting motion. I also wear an Onyx M/24 belt pack PFD (inflatable) around my waist. I put this on in the morning and take it off in the evening when I get off the lake. I don't even know this is on. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6333510,frozen fish,2019-06-22 12:06:00,92,"Since almost drowning in a boating accident in 2014 while not wearing a PFD, I now wear a Cabela's self inflating PFD ALWAYS. And it should be self inflating. If one is knocked unconscious there will be no way to inflate the PFD."
6333524,Huntindave,2019-06-22 14:21:00,2194,"Quote from Consolidated North American Standard for lifejackets/PFDs.""All PFDs must keep the airway above water. FBFreeboard - A PFD shall maintain a user's airway out of water under various environments and use conditions. (All)"" That said; Many inflatables provide more buoyancy. A standard noninflatable adult-size lifejacket provides 15.5 to 22 lbs. of buoyancy, depending on its type. Many models of inflatable PFDs provide 33-34 lbs. and will, therefore, keep the user's head higher out of the water, making it easier to breathe and lowering the risk of hypothermia. Many folks will continue to reference ""Type Codes"" for PFDs such as ""type I"" or"" type II"" or ""type III"" etc. however that labeling was dropped by the Coast Guard in 2014. Recently the US Coast Guard (USCG) issued a final rule entitled Personal Flotation Devices Labeling and Standards. The rule became effective on October 22, 2014 and removes references to type codes in its regulations on the carriage and labeling of USCG-approved personal flotation devices (PFDs). From the rule published in the Federal Register / Vol. 79, No. 183 / September 22, 2014, the USCG states: Removing type codes from our regulations will facilitate future incorporation by reference of new industry consensus standards for PFD labeling that more effectively convey safety information, and is a step toward harmonization of our regulations with PFD requirements in Canada and in other countries. This is not to say one will not find current stock in store still with the old labeling standards."
6333538,Dave Watkins,2019-06-22 15:39:00,208,I just don't trust those inflatables. I like one with lots of mesh for cooling comfort. I don't wear one except when the big motor is fired up. But that's just me. Probably should wear it all the time on the water. I'll let you know if I drown from not wearing it.
6333552,youngknight,2019-06-22 18:18:00,228,"As firefighter in rural area with lots of big water and many people I haves been involved with searches for people including recovery efforts of bodies. Under power pad on in my boat which is a lot easier and comfortable with auto inflate unit. Early or late season always wear. Fishing solo not under power almost always wear. Not under power, warm water and not alone often remove. What is great about inflatables is that you are more likely to put it on and keep it on. Plus much better keeping head out of water than many other pfds...try one."
6333564,h8go4s,2019-06-22 19:49:00,1673,Why not? The Coast Guard does. Do you trust the seat belts in your car? The air bags in your car? The brakes in your car? The smoke alarms in your house? The tornado warning sirens?
6333596,terrapin,2019-06-22 21:36:00,353,"Mustang auto inflate. I think it was $249. I wear it all the time when fishing alone, when the water is cold, when I'm driving the boat (with tether), and when I'm fishing with idiots that couldn't drive the boat if I fell out. It doesn't take to much imagination to visualize what drowning would be like..."
