6336942,Mojo-NC,2019-07-02 08:57:00,1929,"I just checked and Red Lake is mapped on the Navionics website. Last year we made our own maps of the lake we fish. We went to the Navionics website and copied the overall map of the lake showing contours and pasted it into a separate file. We assigned numbers to a bunch of our favorite spots on the overall map and made up names for them. We then zoomed in on each named/numbered section to show the contour detail of the area and copied and pasted those sections along with our overall map. The final product included the overall map with 14 separate sections and everything combined filled up 2 pages. We converted it to a pdf and printed the map compilation in color (front and back) on 11 X 17"" paper and had it laminated. It takes a little computer know-how but it was not that difficult. We made one for each of our boats and then left the maps with the lodge owners at the end of the week because they only had small hand-drawn maps of their own lake. They were very appreciative."
6333824,IaDave14,2019-06-23 16:41:00,99,I like a waterproof paper map to go along with my boat GPS. I have always used Red Lake Digital exlorer series but I have done a google search with no luck. Any ideas online where to buy them? I think the last map I bought was at the bait shop in Dryden. Thanks in advance.

6333878,turkeyriver,2019-06-23 19:30:00,80,"Funny this thread came up. I just got done waterproofing a map today and I think it will work well. Our outfitter provides a map that is just twice the size of a standard 9X11.5 sheet. In the past my bank had a heat laminate that was big enough to cover it, but they quit providing that service. So I was at Wal-mart today and picked up a pack of 5ml laminating pouches. My map fit nicely in two of them and I superglued the edges shut. I put a strip of invisible tape on the map where the edges met and glued that also. The heat laminate always worked for the first few days, but let go eventually and water got in. Hope this works. It's so nice on a new lake to have a map spread out beside me so I can follow along as we explore. We go on flyins and just take simple depth finders so can't retrace our route and I doubt there are lake chips even available where we go."
6333890,kona77,2019-06-23 20:13:00,236,I just go to places like Office Depot and they can enlarge a standard 8 x11 sheet of paper and then laminate.. Have been doing this for several years now and I never have any issues with any water leakage under the laminate.. Have the same issue that the fly-in lakes we use are not mapped but some simple navigation skills and a back-up compass will always work to get us back to the cabin..(we also do not fish huge lakes)..
6333928,pjshorthorn,2019-06-24 04:39:00,5654,"I do the same thing with laminating copies of my fishing license that stays in the boat with me inside a dry bag. I have had enough stuff blow out of a boat( including maps) so I went with laminating licenses just in case that were to happen again....which it will. ðŸ˜± I haven't done the map laminating suggestion, but it definitely has merit if the map size isn't too large to easily stow and use while underway. Regarding waterproof maps, another company I have used beyond the suggestions already provided is canadamapsales.com They are out of Winnipeg, MB. PjShorthorn"

6336656,Pink Unicorn,2019-07-01 13:53:00,83,"I own a small business and worked with our local printer to produce maps for my trip coming up to a new lake. He suggested a vinyl paper that he carries. It's pretty remarkable- fully waterproof, thin, fold-able just like regular paper, has a better feel to it than laminated. Maybe you can find someone local that could help? Otherwise I can give you the name to my guy"
