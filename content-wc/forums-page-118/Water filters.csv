6337818,Rondogpike,2019-07-05 07:22:00,24,"I agree with the endorsements for the Platypus GravityWorks system. We fly in and have a group of 6. I bring a 5 gallon collapsible water jug and filter the water directly into the jug. Every time I go past the sink I refill the top bag (hanging on the wall) and continue to fill the jug (on the floor). We used filtered water for ice, juice, gatoraide and even coffee. Before purchasing this filter a couple of our guys had gastro issues on or after the trip. One went on for weeks after. Since there have been no issues. I replace the filter every year ($50) even though we only used the old one for 1 week."
6337828,acplumber,2019-07-05 07:43:00,80,We boiled it and then I went to a thrift store and got a brita jug filter. 1 filter lasted most of the week. All in was under 15$ with a pack of filters

6334262,Jeler,2019-06-24 19:44:00,92,We've been using a Platypus GravityWorks filter and it works fantastic and very easy to use. Normally filter the water in the evening and it's ready to go the next morning!https://www.amazon.com/Platypus-Grav...18076098&psc=1
6334276,IlliniMuskie,2019-06-24 20:37:00,22,"We used a ZeroWater filter last time. Picked it up at the Target in Virginia, MN on the way up. I think it was $39. We boiled the water and then filtered it. Worked great. Worked fast. It comes with a sensor that will test the ppm in the water. The filtered water consistently tested 0 ppm. Can’t remember what the unfiltered water tested, but it was substantially higher."

6334348,h8go4s,2019-06-25 05:29:00,1673,Boil the water first? Lame.
6334372,MagMarco,2019-06-25 07:04:00,15,"Replacing the Kataydan filter with in-line Sawyer filter is a great option, filter are cheaper and do the job with boiling."
6334374,IlliniMuskie,2019-06-25 07:12:00,22,"Probably overkill, for sure. But 3 of us had our daughters (ages 11-13) with us for their first fly-in trip. Didn’t want to take any chances on them having any issues with the water. Worked out ok, they loved it, and they’re going back with us in 24 days."
