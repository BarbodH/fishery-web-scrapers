6337752,team walleye,2019-07-04 22:04:00,336,Good Luck! Can't wait to hear how you did!
6334994,team walleye,2019-06-26 21:34:00,336,Two more days to go for us this week. So far it has been a pretty outstanding week of walleye fishing. We haven't caught any real monsters but we have consistently been throwing back walleyes that are over the 18¬î limit. We have multiple 25¬î walleye in our group with a lot more 23¬î-24¬î as well. The walleye all seem to still be pretty shallow. Water temps are 66-67 degrees in most areas of the lake. There have been multiple fish over 30¬î caught in camp this week with the biggest being 33¬î. Two more days to try and get my 30 incher! ü§ûüèª

6335018,team walleye,2019-06-27 05:14:00,336,Best of luck BornToFish!
6335214,bearfvr13,2019-06-27 14:23:00,174,"Should be seeing the ""hatch"" by now. I hope you get a mayfly gorged Walleye over 30 inches!!! Chuck"
6335216,team walleye,2019-06-27 14:29:00,336,Probably really close to the hatch in the lake. We were up in the Ord today and saw some flys on the surface. Haven't seen any yet in the lake. I'm assuming by this weekend there will be.
6335616,JAY221,2019-06-28 15:55:00,877,"Thanks for the report. Later, Jay"
6335622,bearfvr13,2019-06-28 16:03:00,174,"Sure hope he posts a picture of a Walleye above 30 inches!! Heading up next Friday, can't wait!!! Chuck"
6335654,team walleye,2019-06-28 20:32:00,336,Well we left all the 30 in here for everyone else To hopefully catch. It was a really good week of fishing however. Many fish over 20¬î each day. Fishing got a little tougher Thursday and today due to the sun and heat. Fish will definitely be moving deeper in the coming days. Another great trip in the books. I will post some pictures when I get home if I can figure out how to do it.
6336010,dakota eye,2019-06-30 06:59:00,69,How was the water level?
6336024,team walleye,2019-06-30 07:56:00,336,Water level was about normal.
