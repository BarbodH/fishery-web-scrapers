6335372,danforth2,2019-06-27 21:13:00,6,"I know officers at the customs crossing, for all of your information, the weight and the fact you don't have a plate is not there jurisdiction, they are looking for lost and stole when they run your plate. and yes some states do not require a plate for small trailers, THAT IS A STATE AND LOCAL ISSUE. but smart off and think your so cool about it and they will have no problem holding you and calling the locals. It would be a good idea for you guys to do a little research and know about who controls what, could save you a lot of not needed headache. I live in a boarder town."
6335456,Aspencreek,2019-06-28 07:30:00,2911,Exactly
6336522,rwl,2019-07-01 09:40:00,1655,"Right, I don't remember what my trailer is rated for, or the actual weight I am carrying. When I bought the boat the dealer told me I would be close to 3000#. So we put a plate on it. The cheap plastic plate mount gave up somewhere between Canada and WI and I lost the plate the second year. I also never received a renewal for the plate, so it has never gotten a new plate in 8 years and I have never been bothered in the state or at the border twice a year. I don't lose any sleep over it."
6336590,Mrxlh,2019-07-01 11:57:00,210,"Alcohol/Beer/Tobacco/Weapons/Live Bait are all I have ever been asked in the last 11 years besides where are you going and for how long crossing into Canada. Returning to the States has been how many fish/species are you bringing back, and pull in there so we can inspect if your drain plug has been removed (it was not, they were being kind). Honestly never once would I consider going either direction a pain. We are always over on Beer/Alcohol traveling to Canada, so filling out the Duty slip seems to be far more important than a boat trailer plate. Although I did get asked 1 year about what my license plate number was. I said honestly I don't know, the agent kinda growled You Americans EH? I said sir, I have 14 things that require plates, they change every 2 years would you try to memorize them? He said, in that case, no enjoy your trip, Welcome to Canada."
6333746,eyecatcher1,2019-06-23 11:03:00,323,"In Minnesota we used to have to drive through a building when coming back into Minnesota, but never going into Canada. I haven't had to do that in a long time now."
6333788,walleyecheek,2019-06-23 13:33:00,2231,I'm sorry I meant crossing back into the U.S. where the scanner was I can't recall going into Canada having to drive through the scanner ?
6333792,The tank,2019-06-23 14:10:00,340,The plates in my back seat but it gets drove to Canada twice a year and to the Illinois river and the Mississippi a few times. To chetek wi a couple times.
6334152,camp chef,2019-06-24 13:42:00,915,No trailer plate required in Wisconsin
6334488,rwl,2019-06-25 14:28:00,1655,3000# and over they do.
6334678,Aspencreek,2019-06-26 06:46:00,2911,"Yes, but even then, when crossing the border the agents are not going to pull out the portable scales and give you a hassle for being 20# over 3000 and fining you for not having WI plates on your trailer, when they don't have the legal authority to fine you for not having them. That authority lies with the State Patrol in WI, and even then, they really don't care."
6334750,CI_Guy,2019-06-26 09:08:00,2118,I agree that the border agents have little interest in the plates on your trailer. But the licensing with the state has little to do with the actual weight of your boat and trailer but is based on the GVWR rating on the plaque on the trailer frame.
6334842,Aspencreek,2019-06-26 14:21:00,2911,"So I'm curious, what has that got to do with crossing the border with or without a licence plate. Just trying to get back on topic here. You are not trying to tell us that those border agents are going to get out of their air conditioned booths and check your trailer label and then pull out the scales to see if you might be over the GVWR limit are you? And of course the actual weight of the boat, motor, et al, is used to calculate whether or not you are exceeding the GVWR of the trailer under your boat, not many empty trailers going down the road exceeding the weight limits."
6334876,BreezyPoint,2019-06-26 15:49:00,1581,"This is not true in MN. I actually researched this as the paperwork on my trailer said 3995 pounds and my actual load, including trailer was 2700 pounds. The law actually states Â‘the weight of the trailer plus the load you intend to carry on it'. I was able to license mine at 2995 pounds. The person in the license office was aware of this nuance in the law and reminded me not to ever carry more than 2995 pounds.Frank"
6334898,CI_Guy,2019-06-26 16:57:00,2118,You brought up the border agents pulling out a portable scale. I was just pointing out the actual weight of the rig was not as important as the GVWR as far as needing a plate.
6333554,10point,2019-06-22 18:23:00,102,Just got back from my 2019 trip. When i was leaving last Friday I noticed my license plate on my trailer had broken off. I made sure I had my registration handy but was still nervous about going through the border. Neither sides mentioned it when crossing. I was surprised.
6333560,The tank,2019-06-22 19:45:00,340,I've never had a plate on my boat trailer. I've crossed twice a year since 1991.
6333572,10point,2019-06-22 19:55:00,102,Do you drive it around Illinois without a license or just use it once a year?
6333606,Eyesore,2019-06-22 23:07:00,455,"In the last several decades, I have crossed into Canada and back into the US with more boat trailers than I can remember and none had a plate, as they're not required in my state."
6333660,That Minnesota guy,2019-06-23 06:56:00,8293,Just got back from Canada. Customs on either side aren't the ogres some would make them out to be.
6333666,Aspencreek,2019-06-23 07:23:00,2911,"X2, be polite, answer the questions asked of you, smile and don't be a wise guy and you will be on your way quickly. The agents have way more important things to do than to make sure you have a licence plate on your boat trailer for the state in which you are coming from. You do not need a license for your trailer in WI if it is under a specified weight, so why would a Border Patrol agent worry about it? They are not going to look up if you need one in your state and enforce it, when they have no legal authority to do so."
6333684,Bill Krejca,2019-06-23 07:51:00,6107,"Agree. They don't normally even look at the back bottom of a trailer, are interested in other possible violations. Bill"
6333696,walleyecheek,2019-06-23 08:34:00,2231,I remember years back when they made you drive through that building with a scanner going into Canada not anymore ????
6333710,Stringbean,2019-06-23 09:42:00,279,"I can recall those days when you drove through that building on the way back from Canada. The guys that were pulled over for a physical check of the boat were the guys who put their rods in a tubular rod case. It seems that the diameter of the rod tube is pretty close to the same diameter of a RPG rocket launcher. I drove through there several times when they start scanning from the tongue of your trailer. Then you move slowly forward and wait at the white line for the scanner to produce a complete picture. If you had a rod tube in your boat, you turned left and pulled the cover off the trailer. I don't use any rod tubes so I was on my way in no time at all."
6333716,bigcreekdad,2019-06-23 09:48:00,74,"One time, a few years ago, crossing into the US at Solute St. Marie, the US agent asked me what my trailer play number was. I told him I didn't have the foggiest idea. He gave me a not so nice look but let me through. In Michigan, we have permanent trailer plates...mine must be 15 years old....would you remember your number?...geesh!"
