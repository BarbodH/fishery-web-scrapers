We've got a cabin booked at Dogtooth Lake Resort for the first week of October, hoping to do some trophy hunting for walleyes, as well as tie into some crappie, smallmouth and lakers (we'll have the last few days of September to fish them). Has anyone fished the lake? I've heard it's a deep, relatively clear lake. I'm assuming main lake stuff is going to be the ticket. Reefs, rock structures on main lake points and off of islands, and the shelves/breaks adjacent to them. Hoping to use some big minnows on jigs and rigs, for those of you who have stayed there, what were the minnows like? Do any of the places in Nestor Falls or Souix Narrows have a decent selection? I've never fished lake trout in the fall, so anyone if anyone who's fished them up in Ontario in September wants to chime in, that'd be awesome. I'm guessing unless it's unseasonably cold, they'll be holding off reefs in open water? I know at some point they'll head in shallow to either chase bait or spawn, what temperatures does that typically occur in? It'd be awesome to catch them casting shallow like I've seen in some videos, but I'm guessing we'll probably do a fair amount of jigging, although I do have some cheap 8'6 trolling rods I could rig up with dipsy divers. Any and all input is appreciated! Oh, and if anyone is ever looking at a fall trip in the Sabaskong Bay area of LoW, I'd highly recommend checking out Jared and Obabikon Bay. We went there last fall and had a great time, good fishing and really nice accommodations. Just looking to do a little trout fishing this year, or we'd probably be heading back there again."

But I really don't remember. It was over 50 years ago. We would travel up/down a small river to get to Kilvert Lake - and camped there. We caught some giant walleye in there. Bears rummaging camp day and night. But we were just kids and were more concerned with catching big walleye. A local (to Duluth) fishing 'celebrity', Butch Fertman once made a show about Kilvert. I ran into him at a local Menards one time. Biggest jerk I ever met - and I'm be kind to him. I suppose those fishing show guys get hit up all the time. But that's part of the business they have chosen. They shouldn't let their heads get too big. They are sponsored by a resort on the lake they feature. The resort owner or one of his guides puts them on fish. Heck, anyone can catch walleye. Not everyone can find them and 'get them going'."

There is rocks everywhere, so ask some locals/guide/whomever to help point a few of them out and give you some starting points. When it comes to numbers of walleye, you generally won't catch a lot, but if you do catch, it should be on the bigger side. I'll be there camping late July and due to my past experience there fishing walleye, I just leave the boat at home and focus on the kiddo's. I don't know how the other species bite there, so maybe the smallie bite is hot. Lake trout could be suspended off the bottom."
