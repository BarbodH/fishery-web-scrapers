The weather was mostly cold, windy and rainy. Sounds like a great trip, eh? We fished through most of it and had a great time though. The group included 6 Walleye Central members and 2 outsiders. Other than 1 W/C relative, the other 4 W/C members are all guys I've met through this website. Thanks Walleye Central! Fishing was very good. Not great but very good. That's relative of course. Down here a week like that would be phenomenal, but at St. Joe it was just very good. Some days were over 100 fish per boat and others were not, but the total was over 2,000 fish for the week. Big fish for the week were a 28 walleye by BCNeal and 41.25 northern by yours truly. Next biggest were 26 and 40.75. It was a good week for large northerns with many over 35 being caught and one monster being lost at boat side. Sorry about that walleyeski! We don't target northerns often so most were caught on jigs while walleye fishing. We started fishing shallow in 6-9 but wound up getting walleye anywhere out to 22'. One group used minnows that were left from the group ahead of us but the other 3 boats used only plastics. Orange Gulp has always been my go-to but wmd got me on to Z-Man paddle tails and they work well. Gulp gets mushy and falls off the jig quickly but the Z-Man stay on forever ( with a little help from super glue ). We fished all of our usual spots with some being good but others disappointing. That's fishing I guess. The shoreline on Grace Island, Grace's Sister and the sand bar on Sandy Island seemed like they should have been hot given all the wind we had, but they were not. It might be related to the late spring and cool water. Who knows. The Grassy Knoll continued to be the best spot for our group. Hewhocookstomuch and I did OK there but really liked trolling the river where we had a 100+ day that ended with a double. It's the only spot we troll with spoons and leaders so we're expecting some northerns but still get predominantly walleyes. This year's wildlife was all bears with nine bears and cubs on the way up and mama and two cubs on the way home. When we got to the cabin the group ahead of us reported that a bear had been hanging around the cabin. It was sitting on the shore on the other side of the bay when we got there but that's the last we saw it. No moose or caribou this year! Looking forward to next year already!"

6332878,stjoeguy,2019-06-20 09:27:00,979,You're right. The weather changes but the fishing stays great. We missed you this year. You would have been W/C member #7. Have fun at Abram in August.
6332968,wmd,2019-06-20 12:58:00,388,"Nice accurate report stjoeguy. It was the longest stretch of bad weather I have experienced in 25 + trips to Canada. It's a tough life when instead of 100 plus walleye days it was 70-80 in a day. It was the first time I had to wait out the wind one day in all of my trips, but St Joe is also the biggest body of water I have fished in Canada. wmd"
6336324,livinglife,2019-06-30 22:17:00,1,Electronics? Can I ask what map software you use? I’m currently using trackmaps but would like to make a change. I’ve heard that there might be a better options now for Lake St. Joseph.
6336476,stjoeguy,2019-07-01 08:35:00,979,"I use a Lowrance HDS Gen3 with Navionics Canada and a Garmin EchoMAP CHIRP 55cv. The HDS was to replace an aging LCX27c that had years worth of safe tracks on it. The Navionics Canada map has very good land/island/lake shapes and basic depth charts. It's great for navigation but i wouldn't rely on it for avoiding rocks. Garmin now uses Navionics charts for Canada which are much better than what they had in the past. The feature that I like best on the Garmin is Quickdraw Contours that makes your own depth map as you go. You're never going to map the whole lake but it's great for mapping humps, points and river channels that you regularly fish. I got the Garmin to use as a portable for fly-in trips but also use it on my boat up at St. Joe."
