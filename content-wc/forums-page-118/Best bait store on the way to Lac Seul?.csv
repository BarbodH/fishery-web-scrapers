6337520,Bstar,2019-07-04 03:21:00,564,If you're going through Dryden check out Queen Street Laundry. qsltackle.ca Email Gord there and he will set you up. $90 CDN /flat. Good selection of tackle there also.
6337002,jb_wi,2019-07-02 10:58:00,212,"Headed to Lac Seul July 27th and crossing at Ft Francis. What would be the best bait shop to buy a flat of night crawlers? Also, if getting a flat should I call ahead so they have them? Thanks"
6337006,jswinter40,2019-07-02 11:01:00,127,I always buy at home and bring in artificial bedding. why wait to get there? I always call ahead at home.
6337024,jb_wi,2019-07-02 11:38:00,212,"Tried that once before..they were purchased from a bait store in NW WI, and had been packed in newspaper bedding (no dirt). Got to the border at Pigeon River and was asked to bring them inside for inspection. Brought them in, and the border agent said he thought he could see some black specs of dirt, and I had to bring them back to the US side, and go through customs again without them. Not going down that road again"
6337052,Carnhzkr,2019-07-02 12:51:00,964,"What part of LS? I fish the NW side and always call Dutchies in Perault Falls 5 or 6 days in advance and they have a flat with my name on it. They were $90 CDN two weeks ago. You can get them $5 cheaper elsewhere, but I like to stop there. I used to call around and find the cheapest price, which was at The Great Bear a couple of times, so I picked them up there. I've done it both ways, but my preference is to buy my crawlers on the Canadian side, just so I don't have to bring them across and put them in bedding. With the added cost of putting them in bedding and the stronger U$D, there's not a big price difference. Buying them very near my final destination means I don't have to worry about keeping them cool during the trip. But to each their own."
6337060,jswinter40,2019-07-02 13:12:00,127,Yikes. I don't blame you then. i haven't had any problem before. I hope I don't start.
6337064,jb_wi,2019-07-02 13:21:00,212,"We will be fishing the NW end out of Cherob Resort, so I'll give Dutchies a call. Thanks for the info."
6337066,billy weaver,2019-07-02 13:21:00,470,Buy my nightcrawlers at Dutchies in Perrault Falls. A little higher at $90 per flat but they were in great shape. Call a week or so ahead.
6337068,PRO-V16,2019-07-02 13:46:00,454,We bring ours from home. Order at my local baitshop in bedding. Never had a problem in 35 years.
6337070,jb_wi,2019-07-02 13:50:00,212,I just softly golf clapped your success. I'll buy them in Canada and not worry about getting burned twice.
6337416,Aspencreek,2019-07-03 15:37:00,2911,"Dutchies, 4 seasons in Ear falls (are they still open?) Great Bear, or Rainy lake sports shop in FF. I order ahead at least a week or 2 and they are ready for me when I get there. It is not worth the hassle and the savings of a couple bucks on something that is the 2nd most important thing to take fishing. (your rod and reel being #1)"
