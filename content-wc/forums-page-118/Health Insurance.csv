Just got off the phone with Medicare and they said that I was not covered by Medicare while on vacation in Ontario...talked with BCBS earlier and was told that they only cover what Medicare covers (plus a few extras like yearly eye exam). Anyone had any experience with this? Not expecting any problems, but one never knows!!!"
6323330,BreezyPoint,2019-05-20 16:57:00,1581,Medicare plans typically don't cover you out of the country. I buy a yearly travel insurance policy from travelguard since I spend about a month each year out of the country. You need to know they don't cover preexisting conditions unless you purchase within a certain time of your first deposit.Frank

6323468,Bstar,2019-05-21 06:06:00,564,Just buy a travel insurance policy for the time that your out of the country. We use Geo Blue Travel insurance. You can take out an individual policy or a group policy if you have five or more in your group. It's costing us $35pp for our group of six this year for nine days of coverage. We haven't had to use it yet on any of our trips but it's good to know that we are covered. Small price to pay for peace of mind. www.geobluetravelinsurance.com/

I tore my quadricep off the bone, ACL, PCL and MCL. It took two rescue squads to get me out of the woods and to the hospital in Dryden. BCBS said to pay the bill in Canada and send the receipts to them for reimbursement. I expected a $20,000 bill like i would have in the states at a minimum for everything that was done. The bill was $1,000. Unbelievable difference between medical costs in the USA and Canada. I sent the receipts to BCBS when I got home and was reimbursed completely. For those who are wondering, That happened on our first day in Canada and i fished the rest of the week with my leg immobilized and pain killers. I outfished the rest of the group too. No way i was going to ruin everyone's trip."
6337856,fishingfever,2019-07-05 09:14:00,85,"Thanks for the reminder. I just bought a policy from GeoBlue for my next trip to Ontario. Medicare has very limited coverage out of country. It cost about $50 for a $1M Medical policy for a week. Be sure to check on pre-existing condition coverage. Some policies cover them, some don't. Good luck."
6338018,Guest,2019-07-05 17:34:00,0,I checked a couple of years ago and my AARP United Health Care Supp Plan for those on Medicare includes world wide coverage. No extra charge. Not sure this plan is avaiable everywhere.
