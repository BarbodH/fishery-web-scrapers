6336938,jswinter40,2019-07-02 08:54:00,127,It sounds like fishing boats are going through the rags. Can anyone speak to specifically if houseboats are going through the rags yet?? thanks heading up this friday.
6336952,PRO-V16,2019-07-02 09:30:00,454,I can't imagine why not.
6336962,eyecatcher1,2019-07-02 09:41:00,323,"I didn't see any go through there last week, but I didn't see any trying to avoid the Rags either. I blew through there 6 times last week and the shallowest my sonar showed was 5 feet. I don't know how much water a houseboat draws, but I would think that the people renting them to you would be able to tell you if you can get through the Rags or not."
6336964,jswinter40,2019-07-02 09:43:00,127,"yep, they will surely let us know. I was just curious. thanks guys"
6337266,cuamb,2019-07-03 08:15:00,203,Yes we went through the rags with a houseboat on June 16th. Looks like the water is a foot higher now. Have a great trip. I am envious.
6328028,Iowa Hawkeye,2019-06-04 07:34:00,90,"Hopefully it's a nice day, that makes the trip more enjoyable. We leave Sunday morning out of Hudson on the brown houseboats, about 16 years. Good Luck"
6329094,PRO-V16,2019-06-07 17:02:00,454,"26 years there for me, sometimes twice a year. Did Canadian side of LotW for 10 years before that. I hope I can make another 20 years or better."
6331874,cuamb,2019-06-17 12:22:00,203,We could not get through the rags with the houseboat on the 8th but we were able to on the 14th. It was a wet and cool week. Fishing numbers were OK if you kept moving. Size was off for us.
6332210,eyecatcher1,2019-06-18 12:14:00,323,This will be my 27th year. Most years twice and even three times about 10 of those years. We love it up there!
6332460,tv4fish,2019-06-19 05:12:00,2694,Been going to Lac Seul since 1985 with my 2 buddies --- THAT must mean that we are getting old Some great times and we look forward to our trip every year........We leave Sunday.
6332464,David Anderson,2019-06-19 05:34:00,2073,"Looked for you on the way in as I drove a camp boat in on Friday. We blew through the rags pretty smooth. After having all of your electronics, fishing a camp boat seems primitive but we got fish, thank God they were still somewhat shallow. Best day was in Bear Narrows. Looks like they re-positioned the green buoy as it was now in 12 feet instead of on top the reef."
6332504,PRO-V16,2019-06-19 06:57:00,454,"We just got home from a good trip there. Went to Vaughan Saturday and Sunday. That was going hot. Nothing over 22"" but lots between 17""-19"". Found a few fish on the reefs but not enough to stay. Biggest walleye was only 25"". Bear Narrows was good to us too. Weather was excellent. Several spots of culvert work on 502 but not bad."
6333954,cuamb,2019-06-24 06:30:00,203,We leave around noon on Friday. Could have you stop by for breakfast!
6334534,eyecatcher1,2019-06-25 18:28:00,323,I went through the Rags twice today without a problem. Stay to the right on the way up and the shallowest my sonar showed was 5 feet.
6335038,rockape,2019-06-27 07:06:00,215,We blew through them a few times last week. No issues. Water is much higher on Lac Seul this year.
6326446,cuamb,2019-05-30 07:28:00,203,Pretty much a yearly question but I wanted to check to see how the rags on Lac Seul looked. Are they taking houseboats through? I looked at LWCB.CA for the depth and from that I would guess that they are not. I would especially like to here from those that just returned. Regards
6326928,prov1800,2019-05-31 10:07:00,5010,Just asked a friend of mine that guides at moose horn lodge.be said trim up high to go through there and take your time.
6326968,bigwalleye1,2019-05-31 14:18:00,2632,"Yah, but you draw less water on plane!!!"
6326988,David Anderson,2019-05-31 16:36:00,2073,"I went through the Rags on May 21st and although no damage because it's mostly mud, hit bottom. If you stay to the right if you are heading to points north you should be OK. Per my earlier post when I was towed back from LSO, they went around the Rags."
6327082,pjshorthorn,2019-06-01 04:44:00,5654,"Man, that is a long haul around Devil's Elbow especially with being towed. How long of a trip was it all the way back from LSO? PjShorthorn"
6327194,David Anderson,2019-06-01 10:03:00,2073,"well, if you count only the time moving, I would say about 80 minutes. That barge cruised pulling me at around 32 mph. The guy following me cut through the rags and was actually surprised as we arrive within minutes of him, of course it's about 4- 5 miles longer to go around and he idled through the rags while we were cruising along at 32 so it wasn't that big of a delay at all."
6327590,Iowa Hawkeye,2019-06-02 20:19:00,90,"[QUOTE=David Anderson;6326988]I went through the Rags on May 21st and although no damage because it's mostly mud, hit bottom. So what is the fishing report around LSO? We are headed that direction on Friday. Buddy was there last week and said it was the slowest in 30 years. He had a 3 day stretch with only 5 fish, that's almost unbelievable."
6327600,Lmbkiller,2019-06-02 20:41:00,639,"[QUOTE=Iowa Hawkeye;6327590]That tells me they were likely spawning and your friend didn't explore enough. No matter what time of yr it is, catching only 5 fish in 3 days on lac seul is completely impossible unless you're trying NOT to catch fish and even then....or he was **** hammered the whole week"
6327612,David Anderson,2019-06-02 21:23:00,2073,"[QUOTE=Iowa Hawkeye;6327590]2.5 days, May 21 - 23, 155 walleyes landed in the boat, 2 of us and this all was within 2 miles of camp. the bite was as light as I've seen it, often they would hold on and it could be almost 2 minutes before you'd set the hook. I'll bet we lost over 50 fish because of we lost patience!"
6327692,cuamb,2019-06-03 06:59:00,203,Thanks for all the responses. I do hate going all the way around Devil's Elbow. 29th houseboat trip on LS this weekend. Man am I getting old!
