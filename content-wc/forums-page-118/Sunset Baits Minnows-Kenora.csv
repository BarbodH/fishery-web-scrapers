6327842,Jahloaf,2019-06-03 13:31:00,74,I just wanted to give a shout out to Cody at Sunset Baits in Kenora. He set us up for bulk order of minnows and didn't disappoint. We used every one on a week of great fishing. Had several nights of 150+ walleyes in the boat using jig n minnow in 12-18 foot of water. Sunset has a new customer and I highly recommend if you are in the Kenora area and need bait.

6328022,Larry S,2019-06-04 07:17:00,665,Bought bait from them for many years when I was fishing in Kenora Area
6328448,Lake Of The Woods,2019-06-05 13:13:00,124,"Good to hear things went well not just with your bait order but also with the fishing. As mentioned to you in previous emails Cody and Victoria are friends of mine and both have their flying licence. Cody learned his craft early in life from his parents who owned and operated another bait shop in Kenora for years. Victoria is the daughter of a very good friend of mine and I've know her since she was born. Both are salt of the earth people and have a great future together as a couple and business people. They know the Kenora area like the back of their hands. Their parents did a wonderful job raising theses two individuals with honesty, integrity and shining personalities. You won't be disappointed doing business with them. Now I just have to persuade them to take me along as a passenger and drop me off at some inland lakes while they go on a minnow catching circuit,"

6328766,kcguy68,2019-06-06 15:52:00,51,"When you buy minnows in bulk like that, what is your trick for keeping them alive for the duration of your trip?"
6328950,Jahloaf,2019-06-07 07:47:00,74,its only 45 minutes to the lake from there and they put them in plastic bags and we put in large cooler for the trip. once there I have a large floating mesh net that is kinda like a mesh laundry bag that we put the minnows in and tie up to under the doc so they stay out of the sun. Only had about 3 doz die.
6328970,KSjim,2019-06-07 08:36:00,88,That is very similar to how our group handles the minnows on fly-ins. We use Lindy Bait Tamers bags and put a rock in them to sink them to the bottom under the dock. The other thing we do is bring a pound of salt to preserve the minnows that die.We bag the ones that die in a mixture of about half salt and half water and put them in the freezer. They fish about as well as the lives ones.

6336740,MN_Moose,2019-07-01 18:28:00,964,You may be best to start a new thread here in Canada section. If someone has nothing to look for in Sunset baits they would probably bypass this thread. I will first recommend Smith Camps. Also Portage Bay Lodge is good.
