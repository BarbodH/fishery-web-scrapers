Anyone have suggestions on how to find a camp with an opening for 2 on 2 or 3 day notice if worst comes to worst. I cant change the days as my wife if 8mo pregnant and gotta be close to home in the next month. Looking for American plan 6 night 5 day guide for a couple days 1400 to 1700 maybe a touch more. July 13th check in. Thanks for any and all suggestions and praying I dont need them. First trip to Canada since dad passed away last year and just cant believe this is happening. Thanks again.

6338416,IaDave14,2019-07-07 10:33:00,99,Try Witch Bay Camp on LOW they probably can get you in since you have only 2. If interested search on this forum plenty of reviews/recommendations.
