You can catch all the walleye you want right off the dock with a jig and minnow. A couple of places in the boat that I would try are: 1. Standing on the dock looking at the main lake go right to the last small bay and there is a creek that runs in on the left toward the back of the bay. When you shut the motor down you can hear the water but sometimes cannot see it if there are a lot of leaves still on the trees or debris in the creek. Fish around the current until you find the depth the fish are at. If the weather isn't too hot this spot will produce anytime of the day. If it is warm and sunny it is best early and late. 2. Another place is to the left from the dock heading toward the portage to the river. There is a place that necks down to about 10-12 foot wide and gets shallow. We caught fish on either side of that. The rest of the lake just explore and cast around at different depths and see what you can find. You might hit a spot and catch them like crazy for 30 minutes and poof they are gone! Pike are all over, anywhere with some grass or reeds will be a good place to throw spoons, buzz baits, spinner baits, etc. Coles is an amazing lake for fishing and exploring. If you are inclined, any of the portages will be a fun trip. I have been told August Lake is incredible for walleye but both times we portaged in it started pouring rain about the time we got there. We caught a few but because of the rain had a hard time and decided to cut it short. The river portage is nice too, lots of pike if you like to cast. We don't have a clue how to fish for the lake trout so I don't have any advice about those. Keep an eye out in the boat or walking the portages, we have seen all kinds of critters there and if you get a clear night take a walk down to the dock and just enjoy the starry sky, it is mesmerizing. I hope you have a blast and catch hundreds of fish! Feel free to PM any questions we have been there a couple of times. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
