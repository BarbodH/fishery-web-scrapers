Not a chance the lake is charted though, you'd have to be super careful and if you were making a long run bring a spare motor with you in the boat.I would love to go and write a story, maybe you could convince Richard Weber for me? LOL! At this point there's no plans to go."

6631554,Guest,2022-02-08 08:31:00,0,"I was fortunate enough to fish Ennadai in 2018 during a visit to Kasba Lake Lodge's Tabane Lake outpost. Ennadai is accessible via some sketchy rapids on the Kazan river. We were able to fish Ennadai for only one day due to weather. It is a BIG lake, mostly above the treeline and wind is a major factor. The pike, grayling and lakers are huge up there. I too plan to visit the Ennadai outpost, as long as we are able to fly via Winnipeg/Kasba. In the past Weber's has flown out of Yellowknife which is just too much for us to handle logistically. I highly recommend this trip if you can swing it."
6631588,NM_Trout,2022-02-08 10:14:00,1094,This camp no longer seems to have a web presence. Perhaps it has closed?
6631598,bthomas3333,2022-02-08 10:36:00,465,It doesn't look like Tabane is available to Kasba. It doesnt look like Ennadai is available through Webers. I think we are out of luck right now. Goes back to my new mantra. If you see it and you want to do it. Go NOW!
6631600,Old Timer,2022-02-08 10:36:00,255,"One of the earlier posters mentioned Tukto camp on Dubwant Lake. Long before Tukto the place was owned by a fellow in Lincoln, Nebraska. Back then it was a tent camp simple, but sufficient. I fished Dubwant in the late 70's and early 80's. I've been fortunate to fish many remote locations in the Territories, Manitoba and Northwest Ontario. But none of them rivaled the fishing in Dubwant. Sure, it was mostly lake trout and some grayling. But the trout ran 20 to 40 lbs. Simply unbelievable. We mostly flat-lined spoons. I remember the Len Thompson five of diamonds and potato bug patterns were especially effective. And it's a very special landscape. No trees, of course. But crystal-clear waters and many musk ox and caribou along the shorelines. Also, blue, blue skies. The downside are the little black flies. They'd freeze off every evening, but be back in force by noon of each day. Head nets and plenty of insect dope are absolute necessities. Children, jobs and finally age interfered with my returning to Dubwant. But if I had to pick my last spot to fish, it would be Dubwant. It's really that special."
6641600,Walleyed99,2022-03-20 03:46:00,1,"I spent 3 nights on this lake sleeping at the old abandoned weather station in the 1990's working on salvaging an old bulldozer that went through the ice. I had the opportunity to fish the lake one afternoon as we needed to catch fish for supper and breakfast as we were low on food, and boating back to Kasba Lake Lodge the following day. The fishing was outstanding and I caught a number of nice lake trout while trying to catch a couple of keepers for a couple of meals. I would love the opportunity to fish this lake for a whole week as the limited parts I got to see were second to none."
6641658,bthomas3333,2022-03-20 08:28:00,465,I am hearing Weber sold the facility so maybe it will come back online. Fingers crossed!
6641684,3M TA3,2022-03-20 10:05:00,2846,Mike. Would there be another 13% added on top of that price???
6641692,Eckohlt,2022-03-20 10:29:00,3685,For the money is this trip 7 days of fishing? or 5 days of fishing with 2 days of traveling up n back?or is it a 10 day trip?
6385400,That Minnesota guy,2020-01-11 07:36:00,8293,For every guy on here who can't or won't justify the price there are guys crunching the numbers to try and make it work. These trips aren't for everyone (me for instance ) but there are some that want the adventure while these wild area's are still available to them.
6385412,Mike Borger,2020-01-11 08:18:00,1554,"Nope. North of 60 never operated on Ennadai. There's endless numbers of other outfitters who operate further north than that but they're all lodges, not single cabin outposts.Quote: Originally Posted by vteye3I glanced at the Outfitter page an crazy expensive.

The further north and the bigger the water the better. This would be a dream come true for me. I went to look myself, and considering how far north this is i'm not sure I agree. The price for 6 nights for a group of 4 inclusive out of Winnipeg is $5590 Canadian dollars. At the current rate of exchange that's $4282 US. Anything that far north comes at a cost. A week at a Gangler's outpost in Manitoba costs $3895 US so not that much less. Quote: Originally Posted by BakefishLooks awesome.

6385418,stjoeguy,2020-01-11 08:45:00,979,"Kind like saying it's not a Lamborghini, it's a Ferrari."
6385432,bthomas3333,2020-01-11 09:50:00,465,"Hey - I love all sort of experiences and this camp definitely would be super cool. I am also not an expert in marketing but super expensive outposts (my def of outposts that pass the 2500USD p/p) are a tough sell. I usually get 3 or 4 trips per year and when I bring up outposts with my buddies that fish outposts they balk at the price. They find lots of outposts (Cree Lake) that are in the 1900USD-2600USD that are super remote on quality water. When I talk to my buddies who can/do fish $4000 Lodges they say why would I pay 4200 for an outpost where I have to deal with cooking/boat issues. I have a pretty big network of guys who fish all over and places like this are tough to get a group together.I wonder if they could charter this out of Yellowknife and save the charter from YWG and bring the price down. Not my problem but this is a super tough sell.Of course if someone else put a group together I would sign up in a second, but it seems I am an exception. :-)Brett"
6385492,Fisherman1792,2020-01-11 14:57:00,927,Is that $5590 for the group or pp?If it's only $5590 for a group of four then I'll consider it.Maybe I'm missing something. Fisherman 1792
6385494,bthomas3333,2020-01-11 15:07:00,465,Its around 5500 Canadian per person. It includes a charter flight from Winnipeg to a lodge in NWT. Then it includes a float plane to the camp. This is some of the most beautiful baron ground you can find along with untouched Pike/Trout/Grayling fishing. But at the end of the day it is an outpost camp which like you mentioned most guys think of as being a 1400-2000 p/p week. In this case the transportation cost of EVERYTHING to an extremely remote untouched place adds to the cost big time!
6385562,martinbns,2020-01-11 18:38:00,1520,"It would be cool, but how much of an 82 mile long lake would you be able to see in a camp boat that would be there?"
6385664,Mike Borger,2020-01-12 07:37:00,1554,"I can't speak for anyone else but myself, but if you went in late June/early July when it's almost 24 hour daylight the answer would be all of it LOL!I spoke with Richard Weber for maybe 5 mins. Not a ton of details, but he did say they had very large boats capable of handling the big lake AND a couple of very basic satellite cabins many miles from camp where you could overnight to explore different parts of the lake."
6385706,Fisherman Ted,2020-01-12 09:46:00,461,If anyone decides to go and needs another fisherman please count me in. I am seriously interested. For something this remote that price is not that bad at all. Looks truly epic. -FT

6385084,Mike Borger,2020-01-09 20:26:00,1554,"You guys might find this interesting, I know I did!A new single cabin outpost camp is opening next year on what I consider to be one of the most vast and untouched bodies of water in the country. It's Ennadai Lake operated by Weber Arctic. I'm reasonably sure there isn't another outpost camp operating this far north. Ennadai is located within Nunavut, roughly 1200 kilometers NW of Winnipeg. The lake is huge. It's lower section is more than 82 kilometers long from end to end. The northern arm is 38 kilometers long from end to end. On average it's 5-10 kilometers wide not including the neck down areas. The Kazan River flows in at the south end and exits the to the north giving anglers access to world class arctic grayling fishing as well as hordes of river dwelling lake trout. The lake itself teems with trophy sized lake trout and giant sized northern pike inhabit its back bays. How do I know? A number of years back I fished Ennadai with my son when we stayed at another outpost camp on the Kazan River upstream from Ennadai. That camp isn't operating anymore, which makes this new outpost on Ennadai proper even more special. Much of this lake has never been seriously fished before and Lord knows just how amazing it actually is. Based on my limited experience fishing it, I'm sure the fishing will be beyond description. The camp itself is located on a sandy island in a sheltered neckdown towards the southern end of the lake. I had a chance to check the spot out when I was last there and it's easily one of the most hauntingly beautiful and remote spots I've seen.Anyhow, this is so interesting and unique I thought it was worth sharing with you guys. It takes a lot to get me really excited but this place has me excited."
6385130,Sniper1980,2020-01-10 06:37:00,33,What’s the crappie fishing like?
6385132,prov1900,2020-01-10 06:39:00,544,Wow! New bucket list destination for sure!
6385142,Mike Borger,2020-01-10 07:03:00,1554,"World class. They're up to 20, 30, maybe even 40lb's here. Quote: Originally Posted by prov1900Wow!

This particular outfitter's business is 100% eco tourism. This cabin on Ennadai will be open for one month out of the year, basically July. Ice breaks in late June, straight through to the end of July then the eco guests start coming to their lodge on Ennadai and they don't want any overlap.The challenge is flying 4-6 outpost anglers into the camp economically without charging a ridiculously high price.I know they're going to give it a go this year, time will tell how it fares."
6385176,prov1900,2020-01-10 08:02:00,544,"Flight time and costs were the first thing I thought of, plus trying to pack for such a trip. That, and them hauling boats, fuel, extras just to have there would be quite the process. Of course that island looks like you could just shore fish for the week and kill it, lol!"
6385224,Carnhzkr,2020-01-10 09:57:00,964,"I'm pretty sure North of Sixty used to operate an outpost on Ennadai. Maybe that's the outfitter you are referring to. There are several other lake trout outfitters further north than Ennadai. As far as I know, Tukto is still on Dubwant Lake. I used to visit their website and daydream about making that trip. I did a trip to Yathkyed Lake with my dad maybe 15 years ago. I have no idea if that operator is still in business. That was quite an adventure. On his last night on earth, I talked about that trip with my dad before he passed."
