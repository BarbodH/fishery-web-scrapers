Often this means going deep and fishing cooler depths where I think, they are harder to find, but is it ever rewarding when you do. Actually fished Napken Lake a few years ago and no doubt, there were very healthy Pike and Walleye there. We had unforgivable winds the week I was there though and it made fishing incredibly challenging. Might return one day to prove I can do better. Of note, I believe Hearst now charges 2,100 Canadian for 7 days. Thanks, I appreciate your feedback and suggestions. Mike"
6640482,bthomas3333,2022-03-16 08:09:00,465,"Hey, If you have to choose between mid Summer and Fall I'd chose Fall everytime. Pike especially big pike are cold water fish. I read an article one time that said pike when they approach 20lbs can only stand water over 55f for short periods of time. Sure in Summer they have to eat and if it means they need to slide up the water column to find food they will do it for short periods of time, but I want to target them and offer an easy meal where they spend most of their time. The nice thing about Fall other than cooler water and more active big pike is the ability to find the vegetation. It is fully developed and easy to see and find in deeper water. Heck if you find 10-15ft of water with 5-6ft of vegetation you are good to go. Anyway don't overlook Fall for big pike. I've had some awesome late Aug/September trips. Brett"
6640496,prov1800,2022-03-16 08:36:00,5010,"From my experiences in the Vermilion Bay area and north is ive found all lakes I fish at drive ins are excellent for what your looking for.As far as secluded I deal a lot with Clarks outposts and the lakes I've been in have all been what your looking for also.My favorite would be Anishinabi Lake. Unreal pike fishing if that's your main goal.Plus trout. Walleyes not in main lake but 7 portage lakes accesible by atv which tgere are 2 of at a remote dock/landing.Pike best early spring and fall in cooler water but if your a decent fisherman they can be caught throughout summer.plenty of 40"" fish in Anishinabi as well as the portage lakes as well.very secluded and only 15 min flight from there base on Cedar Lake.They have 4 cabins on main island and another awesome cabin at other end of lake know as the Williams narrows.Clear trout waters with 300 ft depths produce large pike.Comfy 17 1/2 ft boats with decks to cast from.Worth a look.www.clarksresorts.com"
6640680,RichA$1970,2022-03-16 15:26:00,1159,A lot of choices so I would check this site and then look at the reviews on-line of the camps for “Voice of the Customer” as most reviews are legit (there’s always some reviews that regardless of the camp it was not good enough).
6640734,Stickman8474,2022-03-16 17:17:00,39,Thank you Brett. It's a transition time of year and lends to the challenge. But it makes the reward that much sweeter when you figure it out. Appreciate.
6640736,Stickman8474,2022-03-16 17:18:00,39,I'll check them out. thanks.
6640738,Stickman8474,2022-03-16 17:21:00,39,"For sure, always good to review reports on personal experiences."
6640882,prov1800,2022-03-17 07:40:00,5010,This is a pike I caught at Anishinabi Lake in 2019.Last time I was ìn theŕe before covid hit us.Have only fished in winter there since.There is a group going in today for few days and another group on Monday which iam plànning to be part of for 3 days so I might take some time and try some pike through the ice as they spawn pretty early and will be heading into there spawning areas.
6640954,GrayWood,2022-03-17 12:53:00,14,Stickman. Beteau lake does have three cabins but only to accommodate smaller groups of 1-2 people and allow them privacy. If you came with a group of your own we can certainly make it so you are the only group there. CheersAdam

6639944,Stickman8474,2022-03-13 10:34:00,39,"Hey, looking into Fly in outpost plans for the future. Any information on personal experiences with the following lakes and outfitters would be appreciated. Latto's Wilderness Cabins. Both Churchill and Saint Raphael Lakes. Probably more Raphael. Amik Outposts. Findlay Lake. Luenberger Outposts. Muskrat and Kellow Lakes. Priorities are pike 40"" plus and Walleye for the table. Seclusion. Appreciate any and all responses."
6639966,bthomas3333,2022-03-13 12:41:00,465,Do you have a price in mind? Does it matter about the fly-out location? Kenora / Sioux lookout / Peg / Sask / Red Lake?Brett
6639970,Larry S,2022-03-13 14:19:00,665,Try the( search this forum guide to right . Put in the lakes or other names You should get some postingsAlso go to the canadafishingguide.net forum there are some postings for past trips to these lakes you are interested inLarry S
6639984,Stickman8474,2022-03-13 17:00:00,39,"Hey Brett, The posted camps are out of Sioux Lookout, Red Lake and Nakina, and there all suitable. This are the camps that caught my attention based on sole camp setting, research indicating 40"" plus Pike being taken, as well as referrals from friends. I'm open to other camps and areas that fit 40"" plus and secluded setting. Camp price target is 1,600 US or less at this time."
6639986,Stickman8474,2022-03-13 17:02:00,39,"Hey Larry S. Thnks, I've done that here, as well as some other forums, but was hoping to get some updated information. Appreciate."
6639990,bthomas3333,2022-03-13 17:33:00,465,"I don't have experience with the places you have listed...sorry.Well, it is getting pretty late to be too choosey about location, but I would shoot for June. When you slip into July and August many lakes find the pike going deeper. Of course if you fish a river system you fix that problem but the bite is more sensitive to water level. If I had an open week and wanted a place in the price range I personally would look at:Gray Wood Outfitters if I could get Beteau Lake you would get prime water with a good shot at bigger pike and plenty of walleyes on a river system know for bigger pike.Kississing Lake Outposts - Barnett Lake (tougher to get to the fly out location)Charron Lake Outpost - Through SAS-Ginni-Gak. (lightly fished and known for walleyes but the size and location says big pike are there)North Caribou (doesnt quite fit the price range) A buddy just cancelled his August slot so I think there is at least one week open.Anyway these are the places in the price range that would interest me.Brett"
6640002,Stickman8474,2022-03-13 18:50:00,39,"Already planned and booked for this year, was planning ahead for 2023. Have considered Beteau actually. Was under the impression there were 3 cabins in the Graywood camp (prefer that solitude thing) and that moved it lower on the list. Yeah, North Caribou is out of next year's lbudget but maybe someday. I'll take a look at the the other camps mentioned. Thanks, I appreciate."
6640020,phishfearme,2022-03-13 20:48:00,1242,Accessing North Caribou with Pickle Lake Outposts is within your budget. The lake is huge and their NW bay camp is so far away from the other camp that you'll probably not see others. see:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...=north+caribou there's a link in this thread that goes to a YouTube vid showing the facilities. Seems that big pike are much more common in early June. phish
6640024,phishfearme,2022-03-13 20:52:00,1242,You also should look at Kearns Lake with Thousand Lake outposts:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...ghlight=kearns phish
6640212,adempsey2.0,2022-03-14 18:49:00,611,"If I am targeting 40+"" Pike, the time of year is far more important than the specific location. I was at Blackbirch with Gray Woods Outfitters Sept'21. I imagine it would be insane for big Pike in the Spring. Three lakes to fish and really varied structure. I would love to go back there in the Spring. The number of times I said to myself ""This spot would be amazing in the Spring""....was far too many. North Caribou Lake was pretty good for big Pike in both Spring and late Fall. Napken Lake with Hearst Air may be worth looking into as well. Has some good current areas and narrows. We did reasonably well with big Pike there in the spring. Just find a good sized lake (preferably with some good inflowing rivers) and go a week or two after ice out (usually late May/early June, but obviously varies depending on location). Be prepared to hunt for them as well, because sometimes the big females are very concentrated. A larger shallower lake could also be good choice (usually a ton of cabbage). Kesagami and Lac Evans come to mind . You can get to Kesagami from two different outpost locations as well, if you do not want to stay at the lodge on the lake and save some $."
