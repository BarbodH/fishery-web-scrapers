6640478,Limeyangler,2022-03-16 08:04:00,563,"The pattern since December 20th: -20C daytime and -30C nights, 2 days during each week -15C with 6 to 12 of snow. Spend the week clearing snow in between, work, family and other usual stuff and repeat. If a day presented itself with the possibility of going fishing it was -20C to -30C before windchill, oh yeah, the wind has been a steady 30kmh all winter too, lol. It's finally warming up though, actually raining as I type. FINALLY GOT OUT FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR YESTERDAY! Tried a couple of crappie spots with a buddy yesterday. First spot we drilled 15 holes through 3.5'feet of ice with 2'foot of snow on top, did not need the auger extension, but would have been a lot less work with one. We stared at the holes for an hour without even marking a fish. We packed up and headed further east 20 minutes. Things started to look similar to the first spot until 15 minutes in we got a nice 14 slab. We got to the 2nd spot at 2:30 pm and got around 45 crappie, 15 walleye/ baby saugers and a big pike by 6:30pm. I consider that an itch well and truly scratched!https://i.postimg.cc/YhFj3g1j/7-B07-...38-F0035-A.jpg"
