6637052,Waba,2022-03-01 07:35:00,25,Give Erringtons wilderness Island a look! No trout but our Walleye and Pike sizes and numbers are great!!!
6637148,combine_billy,2022-03-01 14:10:00,151,I have gone to Sydney Lake Lodge for the past 23 years (excluding the past 2 of course) and normally go the second week of July. We specifically fish for Walleye and Lake Trout and catch several Pike while fishing for Walleye.
6638008,Bstar,2022-03-06 07:34:00,564,"I would check out Slate Falls Outposts. We've gone to their Miniss East camp twice and we're headed back there this year. Great walleye fishing for numbers and size. There's some big pike in those waters. No Trout. We were the first group to fly into their Arc Lake camp last year after the border opened and caught over 2400 fish with a 42"" pike and lost a few that may have been bigger. They recently opened a camp on Carling lake which has lake trout, I believe. They're a top notch outfit and Ryan will take care of you."
6638242,danvan18$,2022-03-07 08:37:00,67,I have been going to Pickerel Arm Camps for over 25 years- been to several of the outpost lakes. Contact Lee-he and his staff will take care of you. Reasonably priced and no strict weight limits. Great fishing and accommodations. You will enjoy.
6641742,Family fisherman,2022-03-20 14:53:00,49,Thanks for all the suggestions on a fly in trip! Have decided to go to Anishinabi lake the third week of June. Hope the large pike are still somewhat active and shallow Thanks again for all the replies!

6636358,prov1800,2022-02-26 17:56:00,5010,"Fair population.The ones brought in from river have spawned so you can get into them.There are huge walleye in there.If someone was looking for a 30""+ good chance you'll get one.No walleyes can be kept from big canon"

6636372,Eckohlt,2022-02-26 18:26:00,3685,Your right that's the place for them.
6636636,SweetD,2022-02-27 19:51:00,243,Clarks’s is a good economical with very good accommodations and service. Free minnows and water last I recall. Have been to several of their lakes. We always liked Wright. Very good Walleye with Pike to 46”. No Trout. Unless Trout are really a priority I would suggest looking for great Walleye lake with opportunities for trophy Pike. Your crew will thank you later. Start with just finding a lake that produces tremendous numbers of Walleye of good average size! Just my two cents but focusing on a 3 species lake system will likely not live up to all 3 being top notch fishing! Good luckPS been flying in for 30 years now!!!!
6636642,adempsey2.0,2022-02-27 20:26:00,611,"You probably want to narrow it down to larger bodies of water and go as far north as possible if you are set on targeting walleye, lakers and big pike at that time of the year. Ideally a lake with some good inflowing rivers or part of a large river system. There are a few lodges on Trout Lake just north of Red Lake. Bamaji (Knobby's) and Birch Lakes. Although, not sure if anyone is operating a lodge on Birch, but there are several outposts. McCusker Lake with Walsten Outposts."
6636742,Carnhzkr,2022-02-28 08:45:00,964,"I agree with SweetD's advice. While there certainly are lakes that contain all three species, in general, good walleye lakes are likely not good trout lakes and vice-versa. Most good walleye lakes are stained water, and trout lakes are cold, deep, clear water. If trout are important, you might try to find a good walleye lake that has a trout lake with portage access. If it were me, I'd just eliminate trout from the requirement list, but it's your trip and not mine. You might want to take a look at Bauer's on Onaman Lake. This lake is often referred to as a ""walleye factory"". This is not an outpost. It's a small lodge with about 6 cabins and the owner living on site. It's a short flight from Nakina and it's quite reasonably priced for a fly-in. You will likely see other boats there, as there is access from a couple of outfitters that keep boat caches on the southern end of the lake. Although it's not a fly-in, you might also want to look at Ghost River Lodges east of Sioux Lookout. This is a boat-in with very limited access. Walleye and pike can be very good and I do believe trout are available in one or two of their portage lakes. This is a beautiful lake system with lots of waterfalls and rapids going in and out of the main lake (Marchington) with access to many smaller portage lakes. In any case, I wouldn't take too much time in deciding. Most of the ""good"" lodges are going to be fully booked because everyone that had booked during the Covid years, is carrying their reservation forward to this year. I'm afraid July is going to be difficult to find. You may be able to find a fly-in but you'll probably have to do a lot of calling. Good Luck!"
6636182,Family fisherman,2022-02-26 00:29:00,49,"Planning our first fly-in trip to Ontario.Have been to many drive in lakes, Eagle ,Sturgeon, Crow, Rainy, ETC. Would like to find a lake with numbers of walleye, big pike, and Lake trout.. Any suggestions from your experience?. Would like to keep costs to $1700 PP or less, decent cabin, for adult daughter will be coming along I have been doing alot of research but have become over whelmed with all the different fly-in lakes available. Looking at second week of July time frame. There will be four in our party... Larry"
6636192,bellbuoy,2022-02-26 05:13:00,490,Would recommend Knobby’s out of Sioux Lookout. With an adult daughter I’d also recommend Main Camp at Bamaji Lake.
6636208,prov1800,2022-02-26 06:21:00,5010,Morning Larry.My flyout experience has been with Clarks Resorts and Outposts.They have one camp Anishinabi Lodge that has a great trout population and some of the best pike fishing I've ever had.Also smallmouth bass.Walleyes are in the 7 portage lakes accessible by ATV from main lake.Excellent numbers and good size fish.15 minute flight from there base on Cedar Lake just north of Vermilion.Bay.Camp is on a small island with 3 good size cabins and one small one.17 1/2 boats that are very comfortable.Might be another party on the island but have my doubts.They have another awesome cabin that sits on its own on other end of the lake called the Williams narrows. Worth a veiw.i did a show with Troy Linder for 2 days on the Ontario Experience.My be worth a look
6636266,Tx Jig tyr,2022-02-26 09:10:00,140,"Ck out Big Canon Lake Lodge, they are American plan or housekeeping. Great fishing several lakes to chose from, and helpful owners. They fly out of Vermillion Bary area. Tx Jig Tyr"
6636276,prov1800,2022-02-26 09:35:00,5010,Excellent place to.I used to guide there a lot.good trout/bass and muskie and pike with some absolute slob walleyes now.
6636298,Eckohlt,2022-02-26 12:37:00,3685,John is big cannon loaded with walleye or far n few in between??
6636318,Tx Jig tyr,2022-02-26 14:27:00,140,"Eck, My experience is larger, in decent numbers in the main lake. Decent size and big numbers in ""the river"" which is reached by a ride on a trailer back and forth. Easiest portage you can make. Same boats and motors on both ends. Tx Jig Tyr"
6636324,Eckohlt,2022-02-26 14:53:00,3685,Tx thanks for the info.
6636326,Eckohlt,2022-02-26 14:55:00,3685,How many people can fish the river per day?? And how often can you go to the river??
6636328,Tx Jig tyr,2022-02-26 15:28:00,140,"Eck, You can fish the river or any of the other lakes every day. No charge to go to any of them. At last count I believe they have about 15 boats on the river. We have never been denied a boat for any reason. They have about 6 lakes to fish, but the main lake and the river are so simple, and at my age, simple is good. Ck out their web site it is accurate and truthful. For the O.P. who is taking their daughter. both my daughter and wife enjoyed the facility, and the fishing. If you want more info. send me a PM TJT"
