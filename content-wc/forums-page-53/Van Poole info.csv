6641740,stukkie,2022-03-20 14:49:00,21,Heading to Van Poole in early aug this year and looking for some newer comments/info. I have read some of the older threads on this site and was wondering if anyone has been lately. We plan on lots of trips to the Kag as it's not far. Lake trout is also on the list and not sure if we need to go to the west side of Dorey(?) or closer to home. We do have a newer finder with gps and of course the weather as Chad's boats only have 9.9's. We have used Chad and Dawn's camps many time so I know all will go smoothly on there end. Thanks in advance to all. Stay Safe
