6639178,Eckohlt,2022-03-10 11:06:00,3685,Kinda wondering the price of a flat of crawlers this year?
6639312,prov1800,2022-03-10 17:38:00,5010,Probably a bit early for pricing on them.
6639320,Eckohlt,2022-03-10 18:09:00,3685,"Your right it's still winter,the crawlers haven't come out of the ground yet."

Usually it's several folks deep with them, and I don't want to take up too much of their time, but this year the show had fewer visitors and fewer exhibitors. I don't have a group to fly with this year, but I think we will be coming up to ice fish at K.C.s next winter. Because we're not flying I didn't ask about it, but Wayne must burn a million gallons/liters of fuel yearly, and I'm sure he has a plan. I did also forget to ask him if he had trapped that Bigfoot over at Snelgrove Lake."
