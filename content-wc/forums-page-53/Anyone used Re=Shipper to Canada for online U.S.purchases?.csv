Has anyone used a re-shipping company like "" MY U.S."" to ship items up here? The $445 U.S. mount would cost approx. $25 to New York direct from the manufacturers site ( they use Canadian co. Shopify) but they would charge $101.00 U.S. to ship across border to me in Ont. Plus the duty and shipping. I can see $200 cdn for a $445 U.S. item! so much for FREE TRADE. I'm open to ideas on how to save some $. Thanks ( Stowaway doesn't have any Canadian dealers yet)"
