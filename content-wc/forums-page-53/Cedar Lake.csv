6642790,7 Mag,2022-03-24 14:46:00,1887,"Exactly, that's what i do. My fishing buddy can't go with me on my late August trip to Eagle so i'm going solo."
6642794,prov1800,2022-03-24 14:58:00,5010,You'll have awesome time I spent a lot of time last 2 years alone and got to admit it was nice.
6642808,Eckohlt,2022-03-24 15:30:00,3685,"It was nice but doesn't pay very well,when that's your living.You'll make up for it this year no doubt."
6642812,prov1800,2022-03-24 15:36:00,5010,Looking pretty decent so far.I did do cdn trips plus my wife came alonƒ£ many days which was awesome to.My Aug and Sept last year was really good.
6642398,prov1800,2022-03-23 07:35:00,5010,Sat/sun was to nice to be at home.Grand kid has been out on many adventures already since he was born.Has already camped on Lac Suel and eagle.Has been on Cedar a lot.Good to see them take him out.
6642422,prov1800,2022-03-23 08:15:00,5010,There are 2 years of extra fish Nitro you will have a blast.Last summer it was unreal.Double the action.Water levels will be up this year also.where you staying and when you coming.
6642502,nitroman,2022-03-23 12:21:00,368,We've stayed at Cedar Point Resort for the last 20 years. When you find something you like I guess.....Ray and Kathie take good care of us and have become great friends over the years. Really looking forward to getting back up after a 2 year hiatus. I do like seeing the quality of fish you are pulling out of Cedar! Some year I would love to fish thru the ice up there as well. If you see a black aluminum Ranger with a cute blond and an ugly guy driving stop and say hi!
6642506,nitroman,2022-03-23 12:23:00,368,Some June weeks it feels that way!! I do like September trips for the fact that as the last camp open I fell like we have the lake to ourselves!
6642512,prov1800,2022-03-23 12:37:00,5010,I hear you.Have had 2 years of total freedom.After Aug 9 last year I got a bit of tgat freedom taken away but I've been used to tgat for many years.Cedar is big enough that I can fish spots without a boat around.The east end gets busy but the rest of lake ain't bad.
6642526,Eckohlt,2022-03-23 13:42:00,3685,Ya gotta love those sept trips.I like late sept or first week Oct.
6642528,prov1800,2022-03-23 13:49:00,5010,Yes Sept/Oct are definatly quieter and love the days out on the water but also miss those warm/hot days.With only about 3 months of summer here fall comes to quick for me.I don't catch anym√≤re or any less fish in the fall.
6642600,Riverkeg,2022-03-23 20:01:00,134,Going on year 3 and I really miss going to Cedar. Not all in my group are vaccinated√¢¬Ä¬¶it is what it is. Biggest I've pulled out of Cedar is 28-1/2√¢¬Ä¬ù. Opening week was always good to us in spite of spending most of the time on the east side. Boat traffic wasn't too bad either. Say hi to Wayne and Karla for me.
6642610,prov1800,2022-03-23 20:09:00,5010,Just come with less people. 3 years is a long time to miss miss something that long.I know its of groups in the same boat as you so there leaving them anti vaxxers back home and coming themselves to enjoy what they like.
6642648,Eckohlt,2022-03-24 05:07:00,3685,"Go alone if you have to,it's better than staying home."
6642188,prov1800,2022-03-22 12:56:00,5010,My son took his family to Cedar on Sunday.Beautifull weather.Took the grand kid along and had had a great time.https://www.facebook.com/groups/8209...7954812070311/Grand kid was in a ice shack day before and think he has the jigging down.
6642192,guidedfishing,2022-03-22 12:58:00,531,"Awesome, thanks for sharing."
6642212,7 Mag,2022-03-22 14:21:00,1887,Looks like they had a great weather day for fishing!
6642218,prov1800,2022-03-22 14:31:00,5010,We had a awesome weekend temps at 10c.Got everything melting.But now it snowed some again and might get rain.
6642222,Stringbean,2022-03-22 14:36:00,279,"Hopefully someone measured the walleye before you threw him back in. In the picture, it looks like it could between 30-32 inches. How far off am I?"
6642228,prov1800,2022-03-22 14:42:00,5010,"He said the one he's holding was 28 1/2"" and here's another pic of other one at 27""."
6642280,rather-be-fishin,2022-03-22 18:10:00,429,That's AWESOME to go with family & starting the grandson young! WOW ü§© on those really BIG Walleyes too! Thanks for sharing the pictures! RBF
6642362,Bill Krejca,2022-03-23 06:27:00,6107,"Great family outing, memories being made, beautiful day, nice fish, too!!! Bill"
6642366,nitroman,2022-03-23 06:44:00,368,"Hey don't be showing people that there are walleye like that in Cedar! They will all want to go there then! Awesome though, love seeing families that fish and enjoy the outdoors together. Save a c few for me I'll be there in June!"
6642384,Eckohlt,2022-03-23 07:20:00,3685,"Nitro don't wry about all the boat traffic on cedar,they'll put up traffic lights on the lake for safe travel."
