6641496,Eckohlt,2022-03-19 16:36:00,3685,Got a early start age 7 with my dad 60 years ago.
6641520,RichA$1970,2022-03-19 17:34:00,1159,"Eck,150 you are a legend!!!!!!! 2.5 fly-ins per year which has to make you VIP or CEO of this site. I wonder what’s the oldest plane you’ve been on that’s still in service?"
6641522,walleyecheek,2022-03-19 17:44:00,2231,How do you do 1/2 a fly-in ? .......They drop you off and dont come back to pick you up ?&#x1f914;
6641528,prov1800,2022-03-19 18:05:00,5010,There probably all still in service
6641532,Eckohlt,2022-03-19 18:15:00,3685,"The first plane I was in was Norseman in the early 60's owened by Ron Gibson 1000 lakes airways,later on he restored to great condition,but crashed and died in it a few years back,I'm thinking within the last 10 years he crashed.But when I was in my twenties I did many years with him 5 trips a year,he would give me free trips for bringing people up."
6641534,Eckohlt,2022-03-19 18:21:00,3685,"I did have a booklet of all my flyin trips recorded in it,I buried it with my father a few years back,but this year I'll make 150 n hope for many more,I still get just as excited as the first,same as everyone on this site it never gets old ( never )."
6641642,Mojo-NC,2022-03-20 08:00:00,1929,"For our fly-in trips, they loaded our gear onto a cart and then had us all get onto the scale together with the cart containing our gear. They were only interested in total weight, not individual weights. They loaded the plane, told us where to sit and off we went. We knew our ballpark luggage/gear weight in advance because we fly from home in NC to International Falls, but we had no clue how much we added with groceries. We did have beer and water delivered to camp in advance. We never had a weight problem and did not have to pay any additional fees. Only one of our guys weighed in under 200#. It also depends on how many guys/gals are on the plane too. We only had 4 guys even though the cabin and plane could accommodate 6 people."
6641652,RichA$1970,2022-03-20 08:25:00,1159,"[QUOTE=Eckohlt;6641534]Eck,That truly is one of the coolest tributes I’ve ever heard of burying your log book with your father, total respect on that bond. I would be your father & you weren’t farting around camp half the day with gadgets and probably fished sunrise to dusk. I think you have a business opportunity of taking first timers to outposts as their mentor."
6641664,Eckohlt,2022-03-20 08:47:00,3685,"[QUOTE=RichA$1970;6641652]I would actually love to be with some first timers on a fly in,I would be just as excited as them for sure,after all the years of fishing seems your still learning something,and like they say you never know what's around the next point."
6640986,NM_Trout,2022-03-17 17:02:00,1094,"Given the fuel costs we are now facing, I bet that gear weight is going to be very strictly enforced this year. It's always been a minor irritation. I weigh about 185#, and my daughter 130#. Yet we have the same gear weight restrictions as a couple guys pushing 250#+. How about weighing persons PLUS gear? Maybe I just need to put all my heavy stuff in my pockets and hope that we don't crash in the lake :-)All part of the trip though. Just like flying on an airline and having an industrial sized person in the seat next to you spilling over. We will watch our gear weight carefully and if we come in over, well... so be it. I just want to go fish."
6640994,Baseline,2022-03-17 17:13:00,3207,"I haven't done a fly out in Canada for years. However, when I did one in Alaska a few years ago everyone on the plane was allowed 250 pounds. ""Gut and Gear #250"" is what the sign said. They weighed everyone at the dock."
6641006,Huntindave,2022-03-17 17:50:00,2194,"On a fly-in bow hunting trip, we were advised to wear all our heavy hunting clothing for the flight in."
6641048,pjshorthorn,2022-03-18 05:40:00,5654,My weight loss program started yesterday. I figure it will be good for at least an extra case of beer for the trip without having to pay overweight charges. PjShorthorn
6641052,Eckohlt,2022-03-18 05:44:00,3685,"Just hit the outhouse before getting on the plane,that should do the trick."
6641354,pjshorthorn,2022-03-19 05:57:00,5654,Maybe for a fella that is really full of chit. Does it work for you ? PjShorthorn
6641384,RichA$1970,2022-03-19 07:23:00,1159,Ouch but hilarious. I would assume May 1 there should be some announcements from camps which is fine rather than when you arrive to find out.
6641390,Eckohlt,2022-03-19 07:51:00,3685,"Doesn't work me,actually I have to gain some to balance the plane out,I will achieve this year my 150th flyin and never paid an overweight charge yet,but who knows what this year will bring pat."
6641470,NM_Trout,2022-03-19 14:28:00,1094,150th? Holy cow. We should all have some cake!
6641480,Stickman8474,2022-03-19 15:16:00,39,"Last year we were all weighed as a group separate from our gear. Our gear was under the limit by 40 pounds. Got the impression had we been over in gear weight, our lighter group total would of made the carrier more flexible on over weight charges."
