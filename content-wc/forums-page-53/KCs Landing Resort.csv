6642090,prov1800,2022-03-22 07:24:00,5010,I'd leave them on Rosh.Youll go father with them than tires.My buddy runs tracks summer and winter but he got stuck in slush on Cliff last week.Weather seens cooler next week so will tighten stuff up.Everywhere its different.mostly can go all over.
6642096,rosh1,2022-03-22 07:51:00,275,Thanks for info.
6642370,Skywagon,2022-03-23 06:55:00,1106,"In my opinion this is not a good time for 4-wheelers/side X sides, with tracks or with wheels, not until the ice lifts. Every lake is different, spots in the lakes differ, but I can tell you from what I have seen on assorted lakes in the last few days you can get in trouble pretty easy. One trout lake we fished this weekend had a few inches of slush ice, then maybe as much as a foot of water under that, then only 12"" of good ice under that, don't try that in your side by side when it gets soft. I fished three lakes total and crossed I don't know how many other lakes and potholes this weekend, there is slush to some degree everywhere and it will get worse as temperature warm. If you do bring you side X side, bring rescue equipment and a crew to help, you may or may not need it, but if you do it can be a lot of work to get one out. Below is a picture I took Monday of my neighbor's side X side, he got it stuck right by where it is sitting in the picture two weeks ago. While trying to get it out he blew the transmission. They spend half a day getting it jacked up out of the slush and have had to leave it, the slush is so bad he cannot get to it yet. I rode my snowmobile out there Monday to get a picture (my machine is a high powered, wide track machine with extra wide skis) the slush was so bad in that area it was all I could do to get out of there, the picture was taken from a distance, I could not get near it."

6642390,rosh1,2022-03-23 07:29:00,275,Thanks Sky. We will be careful.
6642394,Eckohlt,2022-03-23 07:34:00,3685,Rosh where you going if I may ask?
