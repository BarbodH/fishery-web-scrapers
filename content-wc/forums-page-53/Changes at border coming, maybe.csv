6632758,Eckohlt,2022-02-12 09:54:00,3685,That's the kind of weather to have when I bring the wife along.lol
6632762,Laketripper,2022-02-12 10:05:00,103,"Well said. Things are looking to be ""game on"" for the upcoming season.Those that may be travelling Hwy 17 at the Manitoba/Ontario border take note that twinning of the highway between Manitoba border and Kenora has begun and should expect some delays on your travels through this area."
6632766,Cgillespie,2022-02-12 10:16:00,120,Glad to see that project get started. We fly into Winnipeg so that'll help. Hopefully they work 24/7 in the summer to get it done. It would take 30 years to complete a project like that here in Arkansas.
6632770,prov1800,2022-02-12 10:25:00,5010,Don't count on it getting done this summer.This has been in the works for 25 years and probably take that long to complete.lol.
6632772,Laketripper,2022-02-12 10:27:00,103,"Same deal in Ontario. The Manitoba/Kenora twinning had the funding in place years ago but the deal got caught up in ""red tape"". The funding got used up in a Thunder Bay project.It will be nice to have that section twinned."
6632776,prov1800,2022-02-12 10:36:00,5010,It should have been twinned long ago right to Thunder bay.the stretch between kenora and ignance is the deadliest stretch in canada
6632782,Pooch,2022-02-12 11:13:00,4618,"That can be a very busy road with fast and slow traffic mixed together. I'm always amazed that when slow traffic gets to a passing lane they speed up making it harder for trucks to get around them..... say what? Worst are the USA folks unfamiliar with the roads, pulling a boat and in no particular hurry. Sometimes no matter how much over I run I occasionally hold up some traffic.The only speeding ticket I've had in nearly fifty years came in Ignace entering town from the east, coming down the hill and slowing down, but missed one speed limit sign near the OPD station. My error in looking for my turnoff street. oops........."
6632786,Pooch,2022-02-12 11:17:00,4618,That picture makes me long for mid summer 2022. Though fishing those kind of days can sometimes be tough. Pretty picture!! Pooch
6632790,Andre (wallyandre),2022-02-12 12:20:00,2274,It's heading that way but I think they will still ask for a proof of vaccinations but w/o the test.
6632676,lotsoffish1,2022-02-12 06:24:00,49,any thoughts to what changes that might happen??https://www.ckdr.net/2022/02/11/chan...ng-next-week/#
6632684,RichA$1970,2022-02-12 06:51:00,1159,Slate Falls Outposts also posted this recently saying maybe next week there will be an announcement. If they just waived the 72 hour test that would be a winner for me.
6632692,Wawajake,2022-02-12 06:59:00,413,"Patience is a virtue. I am confident that by spring, early summer most protocols will be dropped. It will not be because of ignorant truck blockades, it will be because the science shows risks have been reduced with inoculations and with the natural immunity from the weaker virus omicron."
6632694,RickOnt,2022-02-12 07:08:00,217,"I think all mandates will be dropped. Truckers are the best. Vaccines work, BS Just ask Trudeau he has Covid for second time after getting the vaccine."
6632710,prov1800,2022-02-12 07:39:00,5010,Each to his own.Iam fully vaxxed my choice.Not against the the truck convoys but disrupting the public where they live ain't right and disrupting the movement of goods and people getting laid off from there jobs isn't right either.Anybody can get covid vaxxed or not.Potentially vaxxed wise you might not get as sick as i did.This is a fishing forum not a political forum so maybe spread your views someplace else.I personally feel better having fishing guests that are vaxxed. This isn't going to change border wise.Iam fine with not having to do the testing and hope that changes which iam thinking will happen.
6632712,prov1800,2022-02-12 07:41:00,5010,That would be good Rich.Think that's the way it's headed.
6632730,RichA$1970,2022-02-12 08:37:00,1159,"This is a fishing forum not a political forum so maybe spread your views someplace else.This isn't going to change border wise.[/QUOTE]Totally agree John and the protest gained visibility however I feel for the innocent citizens who have been impacted from the delays. As a fishing forum, it is amazing the love for fishing in Canada and some get defensive in their views including me, but I think everyone on this forum would agree fishing in Canada is the Mecca for most of us. Everyone has a choice & I will confirm to Canada’s entry requirements to do something I cherish until I feel it’s too much. Also, I want to be there when Eck pulls a Fred Sanford and has the “Big One” after he catches the big one."
6632732,Eckohlt,2022-02-12 08:40:00,3685,"I'm hoping we will all be happy campers by this time next week with the new changes john,no canada app and no test would be a lottery win for me and I hope for all going north."
6632744,RickOnt,2022-02-12 09:21:00,217,",'no canada app and no test would be a lottery win' YES For sure We can hope"
6632752,steve.a,2022-02-12 09:29:00,274,I would like if the test would go away but I am a US citizen and will do what Canada requests and be just happy to go fishing. A lot of people are a little uptight and need to chill in a boat on a lake.
