If you are looking at going to Canada for a trip, you might want to check Winnipeg as a flight option. Sadly, cars at INL are still scarce and very expensive."
6641568,LoDo,2022-03-19 19:55:00,721,Would love for Winnipeg to open up flight options out of Denver. MSP is the only option right now and doesn't work for our group. Best of luck!
6641840,NM_Trout,2022-03-20 22:51:00,1094,Are you only interested in non stop?
6642036,LoDo,2022-03-21 20:21:00,721,"yes. I know you can get to Winnipeg through MSP. The flight to Winnipeg works, the flight home doesn't. We can't get to Winnipeg from camp for the 1p departure to MSP."
