6641176,kvman1959,2022-03-18 13:07:00,45,"I guess it doesn't really matter to much but the usual walleye, lake trout, Northern. Will be myself and 4 adults son's. Kind of a one time trip while I still can."

6641200,Baseline,2022-03-18 15:34:00,3207,"Couple more questions --Where are you coming from? - and, do you have any ice fishing experience?"
