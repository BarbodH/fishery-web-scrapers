6641730,prov1800,2022-03-20 14:01:00,5010,So many ways but one of my fav is skin on trout on open fire on green poplar above fire or have them in tom foil and throw in fire for that nostalgia effect.trour and pike really don't need a lot of ingredients as they have there own flavor.
6641876,Bill Krejca,2022-03-21 06:33:00,6107,"Re: green stick over fire - called panassing, I believe - I found you have to get fish positioned just right to have this work out. Perhaps had I tried it more, I would have gotten the ""formula correct! Bill"
6641878,prov1800,2022-03-21 06:42:00,5010,Takes a bit of doing it that way but fun.Have cheated with a metal grate lol.we used to do it a lot ice fishing

6641554,prov1800,2022-03-19 19:22:00,5010,They carry it.If you get some remember to not add salt.has enough on its own.but great taste.
6641556,7 Mag,2022-03-19 19:24:00,1887,"Thanks John, I'll remember that."
6641558,prov1800,2022-03-19 19:26:00,5010,Good luck in August.where you headed to.
6641560,7 Mag,2022-03-19 19:29:00,1887,"Eagle, staying at Cedar Point and I’m really excited about it."
6641562,prov1800,2022-03-19 19:34:00,5010,Sweet.nice place.Fishing will be awesome at that time.
6641564,7 Mag,2022-03-19 19:43:00,1887,Looking forward to a few shore lunches. Besides walleye and muskies I'm going to try for a lake trout while I'm there too.
6641566,prov1800,2022-03-19 19:49:00,5010,Plenty of everything down in the West arm.Theres a population of lake trout in portage bay also.
6641570,7 Mag,2022-03-19 19:56:00,1887,Thanks John I appreciate the help.
6641574,prov1800,2022-03-19 20:07:00,5010,I spent a few days fishing portage last year basically had the whole bay to ourselves.Walleyes where all over those humps and muskies everywhere.we did a couple of shorelunches on the beach by pine beach lodge and walleyes were stacked in the narrows.Nobody has touched them for 2 yeàrs.
6641494,prov1800,2022-03-19 16:35:00,5010,Wife and I had a pretty awesome day for trout today.Weather was unreal at 11c.Blue skies were awesome.We got our 2 each but took a while as the trout chased lures all morning but would not bite.The ones that did we ended up loosing.But in afternoon after using a lure they wanted we had a good bite.Fun day.
6641500,7 Mag,2022-03-19 16:42:00,1887,"Nice fish John, do you have a good trout recipe?"
6641504,prov1800,2022-03-19 16:51:00,5010,Mots of ways to cook trout.Basically can fry it with same breading as other fish.We will bbq/fry/and bake it to change it up.Have been using killer crumbs lately and its good stuff and would recommend it.Have a buddy that makes his own breading here not sure if its called something but it's also really good.Tonight we had yesterday's walleye and just used the Wal-Mart brand Italian bread crumbs and the were baked in oven.we do dip them in egg/milk wash

6641544,prov1800,2022-03-19 18:51:00,5010,Well our little co op store in Vermilion Bay had them. Not sure where you could find them.Iam sure a Google search will locate you some.We use candies also.
6641546,prov1800,2022-03-19 19:00:00,5010,Only thing I sell is killer fishing trips.Lol.
