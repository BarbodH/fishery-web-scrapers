6642686,mctbone,2022-03-24 07:16:00,26,"We fished Tommyhow in early July of 2013. The thing I remember most about the trip was the blackflies being worse by far than any other trip we did, although we normally do August trips. I think it was a fairly shallow lake. We caught fish at either end by the falls and creek as well as some other places around the lake but I don't remember anything of any size nor any particular hot spot. There was a mayfly hatch for a few days so that didn't help the fishing. There was one portage lake but we didn't do it and I don't remember why - maybe the water was too low making it too difficult?"
