6640316,Moondog,2022-03-15 12:21:00,362,Historically we take 17 to 17 to 105 to get to Red Lake. Just wondering about the road conditions these days on Hwy. 502. It used to be really bad. Traveling in a moho. What say you???
6640318,nitroman,2022-03-15 12:24:00,368,Taken it last few years and no issues. Bit faster but less scenic for sure.
6640346,NARDA 1,2022-03-15 13:38:00,636,"We stopped taking the 502 several years ago, due to an aging group and medical issues. The 71 is a little longer but it's nice to have the pit stop in Souix Narrows."
6640458,pjshorthorn,2022-03-16 06:13:00,5654,"I've taken 71 a number of times and it has always been in decent shape with minimal construction. It may be 30 minutes longer,but that doesn't bother me. I haven't been on 502 for 8 years so I'm not sure how she is now,but I'm going to find out this July as I'll be fishing Lac Seul out of the Sioux Lookout area. I will say that 502 is more scenic to me with a higher population of moose and bear. I have also seen a lynx on the 502. 71 seems to have a higher population of deer....at least in my experience.

6640460,Walleye2242,2022-03-16 06:43:00,263,I feel like 502 is in better shape than ever. Much better than in the past. No issues at all.
6640462,Baseline,2022-03-16 06:46:00,3207,I've was on 502 last fall and it was in great condition. Lots of new pavement and shoulder work had been done.
6640472,Bill Krejca,2022-03-16 07:37:00,6107,"The last time I took 502 was 3-4 years ago, due to having gone to Dryden for a medical stop for one of our party, so we continued down to Fort Frances that way. I don't care to go that way due to the narrow/non-existing shoulders, and pulling a boat, there is very little room to pullover. I prefer to take the bit long route through Sioux Narrows/Nestor Falls. Also, there is just more places to stop, for whatever reasons. Bill"
6640582,Knutson21,2022-03-16 12:49:00,348,502 Was in Great Shape last September. We take that way due to it being faster and we usually hit the grocery store in Dryden.
6640924,btyreprich,2022-03-17 10:46:00,1067,"It's true that Highway 17 will add 30 minutes onto your travel time. I am convinced that 17 is safer - at least for us. Over the years, I've seen situations with people towing boats on 502 that resemble scenes from the Mel Gibson movie ""The Road Warrior""! Our vehicles aren't as new as they once were and have more mileage on them. We feel 17 is a better option should we need help from a mechanic or a tow."
