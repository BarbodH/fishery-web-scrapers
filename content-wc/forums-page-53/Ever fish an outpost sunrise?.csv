6640716,NM_Trout,2022-03-16 16:38:00,1094,"Well, I think we will give it a try one day. It's just so dang painful to get out of bed early. Much easier to fish late, especially when the fish bite all day long. But I do admit... I love being on the water in the early morning when it is calm. I have to laugh too about trying to wake up at 5am and finding that broad daylight had commenced. Even worse, we had a loon(?) that would land on the roof of the cabin to sun itself and then start yelling it's head off. By the end of the trip we were trying to figure out how to make a pipe bomb with matchheads and rocks to quiet that thing down. Protected or not, that thing had us declaring war."
6640768,bigwalleye1,2022-03-16 18:57:00,2632,"Always. I prefer to be at my spots when the sun is breaking the horizon. I'd much rather start early and get to the day before everyone else, and, then, when the sun gets high and hot in the afternoon and the bite ge5s tough, go back and relax, have dinner, and maybe catch either an early twighlight bite or an early twilight buzz...."
6640912,turkeyriver,2022-03-17 08:55:00,80,"There is nothing quite like a cup of coffee out on a quiet lake in the early morning. Real early. And feeling the tug of the first walleye. Yeah, fishing can be good anytime of day up there, but I'd rather nap during the heat of the day and fish early and late, regardless of the late nights. Dreaming about it is great too!! Come on July for my first trip of the year!"
6641030,NM_Trout,2022-03-17 20:23:00,1094,"So I asked my daughter if she would be up for this, thinking ""no way"". She texted back and said ""Whoa.. that would be so fun... put me down for that"".I love that kid."

6640366,Eckohlt,2022-03-15 15:05:00,3685,"I bought one years ago up in pickle lake at the airport,it folds up into a nice pouch for travel,still use it,it's a handy item."
6640370,Mojo-NC,2022-03-15 15:35:00,1929,Our group used to wait until after breakfast to fish. I'm an early riser and it was frustrating for me to have to wait for the late sleepers to get up before we could fish. I would watch the calm water turn into a walleye chop before we even got the outboard cranked. Now I negotiate with my fishing partner for the day. We get out and fish as soon as we get up while the water is still like glass. We fish until we get hungry and then come back in for breakfast. We might raid the refrigerator before we leave camp and grab some leftovers from the previous night's dinner for a pre-breakfast snack. I love the early morning smooth water and a good early morning walleye bite. The group breakfast is nice but not nice enough to delay fishing.
6640382,phishfearme,2022-03-15 16:08:00,1242,"On my very first fly-in - to small Owlet Lake out of Moonbeam in about 1972 - after we set up camp and did some fishing, we went back to the cabin for a light dinner - then decided to hit the sack early and get up at dawn to chase fish. We knew we were quite far north, so we decided to set the alarm clock early - 5AM. whatta joke - it was already broad daylight - a lesson learned as it didn't matter what time of day it was. This was the last time we ever even tried to get up at dawn. One of our regulars suffers with arthritis such that he only sleeps 4-5 hours a night - he gets up with the sun and frequently will just sit out in the boat to enjoy the sunrise (on usually a flat lake) and the wildlife awakening. Then back to camp for breakfast. phish"
6640402,kettyspanky,2022-03-15 17:50:00,271,"We do both. Early morning for some walleye. We fish perch during the day. We come in and clean fish and eat. About 7 we head out until 8:30-9 and get a few walleye or bass. Clean fish and have a couple beers and in bed usually by 11pm. Get up in the morning early, eat breakfast and start all over again. 4 months and I can do it again."
6640428,Yellowfin123,2022-03-15 20:30:00,2182,"i always thought no matter what body of water your on including ocean, warm up the motor while still dark and ease out when there is a glimmer of light in the east, the next 2 hours will probably be the best of the day, evening can be ok but even catfish go to bed at midnight, BUT, when your fishing crew is ages 26-32 i never hit the water before 9:30, it is what it is.."
6640430,RichA$1970,2022-03-15 20:55:00,1159,A couple of us like to get out early and fish til lunch and have our big meal then so we can stay out late and just have leftover fish for dinner when we are at an outpost. On the last full day one character took a dump in the sleeping beauties lone boat before we went out that morning which was a real treat for them.
6640454,Eckohlt,2022-03-16 05:10:00,3685,"First I've ever heard of that happening,using a boat as a outhouse."
6640474,Bill Krejca,2022-03-16 07:46:00,6107,"I don't normally get on the water until 8:30- 9:00, however I have experienced several early morning good bites. On waters which are on the clear side, I have found that fishing the early shadows(east side of the lake) can be great for walleyes as they seem to lay in the shadowed shallows; this bite evaporates as the sun gets higher in the sky. Also, sometimes even on a stained water, the same can be said for crappie and sometime walleye. The reverse can be said for evening fishing, casting the shallows on the west side of the lake. Bill"
6640686,RichA$1970,2022-03-16 15:30:00,1159,That was nothing compared when we were fishing the Smithland Pool and grabbed a fat water snake and we put it in our buddieâ€™s waterproof boat bag. He almost jumped out of the boat when he open it up and that fatty hissed and struck at him. That was priceless and he was F N pissed the rest of the trip.
6640270,NM_Trout,2022-03-15 08:43:00,1094,"Not us :-)Given that twilight end is roughly 10:15pm and twilight start is 4:15am, we tend to fish late and not early. We usually don't get into the cabin until after 9:30, and by the time we clean up, have a snack, and play some yahtzee it is pretty late by the time we turn in. We sleep in, have a good breakfast, let things warm up a little, and head out around 7:30 to 8am. My daughter is usually itching to fish, so she will try to catch a couple off of the dock while I'm making breakfast. She cleans them for our fish meal later in the day and gets them in the fridge. Saves the hassle of messing with fish guts later. We head out, put the guts on the seagull rock, and then fish pretty hard. The fishing is almost always great, but I've wondered what it is like to fish early morning as opposed to late at night. We've scheduled a test this year. I suspect we will only do this once...lol"
6640272,maddogg,2022-03-15 08:58:00,178,It's a lot easier to stay out later than to get up earlier.
6640274,buckmaster7600,2022-03-15 09:04:00,590,"I'm always an early riser on fishing and hunting trips. I've often had my best fishing early especially with pike! When my father was around he didn't like puke fishing so I would always pike fish at daylight then pick him up around 7 to walleye fish for the day. People go on these trips for some to relax and some to fish, for me it's to fish. 3-4hrs if sleep with a quick nap midday is perfect for me on a fishing trip. Others have more stress etc and go up and go up to relax and that's great too!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6640282,Eckohlt,2022-03-15 10:17:00,3685,"When I can see to pull the motor cord I'm gone,I don't like burning daylight,if it stayed light 24 hours a day I probably fall asleep while driving on the way home."
6640288,Huntindave,2022-03-15 10:39:00,2194,I'd rather fish early and come back in the daylight. I hit the water as soon as I feel comfortable navigating. On unfamiliar waters I head out a bit later than waters I know well. I know this is the less popular schedule but that suits me just fine too.
6640290,7 Mag,2022-03-15 10:50:00,1887,"I'm an early morning fishermen, i enjoy getting out when the lake is calm and listening to the wildlfe. I normally come in for lunch, take a nap and get refreshed for the evening bite. What i don't like is fighting the insects at dusk so i try to get in before dark."
6640294,Eckohlt,2022-03-15 11:01:00,3685,A bug jacket can keep you out there longer.Good bug jacket can really pay off.
6640296,NM_Trout,2022-03-15 11:09:00,1094,"We never go up without headnets. Actually, we bring bed nets too."
6640310,Eckohlt,2022-03-15 11:51:00,3685,"Never used bed nets,just usually fire up a few coils and that takes care of the little aliens."
6640332,nitroman,2022-03-15 12:45:00,368,"I'm a what ever the day brings guy. If someone want's to go early and I am awake I'll go. I like lunch on the lake followed by a slip bobber nap. We like to eat ~5ish so we can go back out till we can barely see to come back in. Clean fish play some cards drink a beer and in bed before midnight to repeat again. I rise early so I go out for a smoke and to check on the boats, get bait for the day, clean and dry my seats and screens, talk to the camp owner a bit as he gases up camp boats. Then back up to make lunch for the day and pack the cooler with snacks etc, breakfast and then we are off. Sometimes it's 7 sometimes it's 8:30 just go with the flow as the fish are still out there no matter when we get there."
