Most cars and trucks have tires which are compromise tires. Even AT tires aren't the first choice for rough gravel long term. Buying a set tires rated for long term gravel costs more than the flight. 2. The price of the new tires or a couple of extra spaces ate up the savings verse driving. 3. Neither of the above accounted for the pure damage to the truck. 4. Changing tires in the bush really didnt sound like fun.Just couldn't wrap my head around the cost/benefitBrett
6641188,DeBo,2022-03-18 14:36:00,211,How about the Trip to Kinoosao? Is that easier? Going to Wollaston looks a lot tougher based on how far you need to zoom in a Google maps to show an actual road.Anybody done the ultimate drive to laker trip to Stony Rapids and boated out to the big part of Athabasca?I want to make the trip to Kinoosao and camp on Reindeer badly.
