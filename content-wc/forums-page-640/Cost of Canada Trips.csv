567797,AllenW,2007-07-26 10:03:00,11482,"Goldeneagle, the lake is so big and has so many spots ya really don't need any ""secret hard to get to spots"", we fish everything from the point just out from the town of Red lake (Forestry point I believe) to the northwestern end of the lake for trout, also I doubt there's any secret places anyway, just tons of good structure. I'd have to find my map to tell ya few of the other spots, if your interested. But points, places where rivers run into the lake, islands with reefs or just reefs running off of shore work well, try deep (40+') and work your way into shallow water, usually smaller walleyes the shallower ya go, especially during the day. We've had our best luck with jigs and minnows, 3/8ths if it really calm to 5/8"" if its windy, usually half oz I think is what we use the most of. If the lake is to windy to fish, we'll drive up the Nungessor (sp?) road and fish below the bridge, don't have a map on me or remember exactly how we get there, but its been a good spot to throw 3 or 4"" raps for walleyes, fair amount of snags so bring a few..:) Throw up into the rapids and reel fast enough to give the rap some action, black and gold or black and silver works well for us also anything that looks like bait fish colors I can get directions to the bridge if ya need, its a ways out of Red Lake though or maybe some one else knows. Hope this helps a little. Al"
567803,Guest,2007-07-26 12:00:00,0,Thanks Al. My sons and I fished below the bridge in June of 1979. The rapids do hold walleyes. I fished Little Vermilion May 18-June 3 this season and will be on Nungesser Lake August 3 - 17. Back to LV for 9 days in October. I was thinking about the pools and mild rapids below the flume dam. It can be really hot in June.
567873,AllenW,2007-07-28 08:20:00,11482,"Another spot that seems to get missed a lot is around McKenzie island, along the side that faces the town of Cochenour especially. Al"

567368,Guest,2007-07-13 12:34:00,0,"My wife and I drive to Camp from central Missouri and back on about $250.00 maybe 275.00 for gas. $1600.00 on fly in camp. With fish we catch and dry noodles and other items we bring to eat during the week counting beer we do not spend $50.00 on food, the pecooked bacon is the real cost. $160.00 on motels. Well worth the trip for us. Go to Lake of the Ozarks here and we could spend that much money and not have as much fun. NO boats running you over on a fly in camp."

567437,Guest,2007-07-15 07:56:00,0,"I have to admit our cost rose to $3000 for the two of us this year (I pay for my son, so it all on me). We do not spare any cost, so we use the modifed American Plan costing $120 per night per person plus tax, which includes cabin, housekeeping and meals. I tow my own boat for the luxury of having all of my own equipment. At 9 mpg that really added up this year. Filling up my boat at the camp with 50 gallons of gas added a lot of cost and not getting a penny back for gst this year also increased the cost. I still plan to do the same thing again next year, but I may soon have to resort to renting camp boats versus towing my boat. I had a break down on the interstate this year, too, that added some extra cost. With all that said it is still worth it. I have had no problem crossing at the border. Like a good Red Sox fan, ""Can't wait til next."" Go Huskers!!"

567789,AllenW,2007-07-26 06:53:00,11482,"Usually stay at the Chunkuni River camp grounds and trip from Mpls were actually fairly cheap, but a combination of getting to old to camp and the major storm that came though our tent one year, put a end to that. Easier to spend a few extra bucks and be comfortable. But I'd guess the last trip up to Red Lake probably cost about $1000 for the two of us, considering we buy a lot up there and eat out a few times. Luckily we've been to Red enough times that we don't use a guide and can plan on fish for a lot of the meals. Going with the new boat and price of gas is probably gonna add a fair bit to the cost, but it's a once a year thing so it's easier to deal with the cost. Al"
567792,Guest,2007-07-26 07:07:00,0,"Al, I've spent my share of nights with Ralf at Chukuni River Campground. I'm not asking location, but do you have a secret, hard to get to spot, up there? Just wondering because I know of one that is probably one of the best walleye fisheries available, and you can get there with a twenty-five mile truck ride, then a mile or two with a canoe puts you on great June walleye catching. Knowing it's there makes my life better. Hitting it every year or two is great. My wife and I will stay with Ralf the night of August 2 before heading north for two weeks at Angler's Kingdom."
