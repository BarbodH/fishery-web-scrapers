567493,Dacotah Eye,2007-07-18 06:55:00,2722,One thing that I have been wondering about is whether a copy of your birth certificate is good enough or do ya need the original. Certified copy maybe??
567594,Seanik,2007-07-21 23:02:00,218,It sure is jimmey jig and a lot of us vets served in order for people such as you to have the freedom to make crappy remarks about it. Buffalo is a proud U.S. city. Just returned from a fishing trip to the Gouin Reservoir in Quebec and was asked for passports or drivers license and birth certificates both ways at the 1000 Islands bridge. Observed 4 lines of traffic coming into the U.S. (7/21/07) and everyone was handing the border patrol the above mentioned documents

567839,scott791,2007-07-27 05:00:00,7,No worries now Just got passport guess shouldn't have gave up just took alot of phone calls Scott
567303,scott791,2007-07-11 15:04:00,7,Running into bit of problem I applied for a passport back in the end of april have not recieved let and we leave in 16 days. Well I don't have my birth cert. Getting one will be tough as I was born in a military hospital and you how well the goverment works. Will photo I.D. be enough.
567306,Jimmy Jig,2007-07-11 15:23:00,1905,"If you are going to Canada and driving, a drivers lience is all I have ever used. If you are flying you need a PP or at least proof that you have applied for one."
567308,Oldschool,2007-07-11 16:34:00,163,"When entering into the U.S. from Canada, one needs a birth certificate and a photo I.D., such as a driver's license, or a passport. I read mostly on this site that the predominant request made by the border authorities is for a driver's license. However, that is technically not enough. Perhaps if you were to provide the documenation where you requested your passport that could support your case. Maybe even further if you were to put in a formal request for a copy of your birth certificate this could also help. I certainly would try it. What if they won't let you come back across the border? You would have to stay there and fish until they rethink their decision. It could take weeks, or months, or ....:)"
567313,guidedfishing,2007-07-11 17:48:00,531,You will be fine with your drivers license. have fun GF
567316,Guest,2007-07-11 18:46:00,0,"I pasted this from the homeland security website: Travel Document Requirements - Temporary Travel Flexibility U.S. Citizens traveling to Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda who have applied for but not yet received passports can nevertheless temporarily enter and depart from the United States by air with a government issued photo identification and Department of State official proof of application for a passport through September 30, 2007. Traveling by land from Canada does not require a passport yet."
567326,Guest,2007-07-11 21:26:00,0,i always carry a birth certificate and have never been asked for one. drivers license seems to be the most requested form of identification. i wouldn't worry about it.
567328,Guest,2007-07-12 05:06:00,0,you may have a prob coming back but what the heck.......the trip's on autopilot now.......worry about it then. worse they'll do is make a fuss........ ss
567330,scott791,2007-07-12 06:14:00,7,Thanks for the input hopefully passport and birth cert. arrive in time. If not Sounds like drivers license should do just don't like heading up and not having all documents.
567346,rpieske,2007-07-12 15:00:00,1276,Scott: The only thing you will need is a drivers license to get back in the USA. Don't worry about it. I cross the border at International Falls numerous times during the summer. This is all you will need unless you are not a US citizen.
567353,Seanik,2007-07-12 20:50:00,218,"Just crossed back into the USA 2 days ago at the Peace Bridge in Buffalo N.Y. I was asked for proof of U.S. citizenship, either a passport or birth certificate is acceptable, your drivers license is not proof of citizenship. It all depends on the what the interviewing immigration official wants at that time. Without proof you could be delayed at the border to get the required information at your expense. Good Luck coming back!"
