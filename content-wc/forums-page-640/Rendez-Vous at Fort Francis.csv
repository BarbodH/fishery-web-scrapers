567865,Guest,2007-07-27 19:47:00,0,What motels did you call for Dryden? I work in the area and can give more motels to try if your really wanting to stay in Dryden.
567866,Guest,2007-07-27 19:58:00,0,"I usually stay in Dryden, but stayed there once a couple years ago. Nice location on the lake. Food and bar was good. If I recall correctly, my steak or prime rib came with ""au jus"" which was actually the brown gravy that seems to come with most everything in Canada. Anyone who has seen me can probably guess I'm not necessarily anti-gravy (or any other food), but there is a certain seasoning in that famous Canadian brown gravy I don't care for too much."
567867,2746,2007-07-27 20:46:00,3206,"I was looking for two rooms with two bed each. Tried Best Western, Holiday Inn Express, Kowality, Hide Away, Timber something and Comfort Inn. All said immediately that they were full and thought all motels were but no one knew why except it was Friday. We've never had a problem before over the past 10 years of multiple trips each year."
567868,2746,2007-07-27 20:48:00,3206,"Ron, thanks for the feed back. Yeah, I've experienced the ""gravy"" and Canadian beef......not what we are used to in Iowa. On the other hand, we don't have that good Walleye, hummmmm!"
567869,2746,2007-07-27 20:54:00,3206,"Motel, sorry I didn't answere all your question. Yes, we would rather stay in Dryden so if you have some other suggestions I'd appreciate them."
567874,Guest,2007-07-28 09:52:00,0,"Not sure exactly whats going on that weekend for your trip. The PWT walleye tourney is over as of this week..... Try Town and Country. 800/263-0183 avg basic rooms Patrica Inn 807/223-3291 cheap rooms, nothing great, does have a in house bar that fills up on weekends so will be pry be loud. Also has a good food. Good burgers. Chalet Inn 807/223-2335 nothing to brag about Or I do know a camp does do over nighting... Indian Point Camp if they are not full with fishermen. They are located on Wabigoon just south of town. 807/937-6988 I work for a camp. Mention to the motels your with a camp and should get a better rate... Hope one of these helps..."
567879,Guest,2007-07-28 12:44:00,0,"Forgot to mention 1 other place. The Riverview. Its right across the river from the mill. If I had to say, it may be alot like the Rendez-Vous in Fort Frances?? 807/223-4320"
567881,Guest,2007-07-28 14:28:00,0,"I think the Riverview would be nice if available. I've tried to eat there, but they've always been packed and I've never been able to get in to eat. I've never tried to book rooms there myself as I assumed they would fill up fast."
567885,2746,2007-07-28 18:48:00,3206,"Thanks for the advice. I'll give these a try. By the way, we do eat at the riverview and, while pricey, the food is excellent! Usually Prime Rib and I've learned to avoid the gravy:-)"
