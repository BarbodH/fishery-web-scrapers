My concern is that our camp had 50% occupancy and the logic offered for the reduced occupancy was the poor excahnge rate ($.22 on $750) and the price of gas. The three of us spent $30/person more this year than last year. So over the five days of fishing, we spent $10/day more individually to travel 236 miles by boat and catch 528 walleyes. Why would someone cancel out their vacation just because cost $10/day? I just don't understand (I'm on a fixed income)."

Four of us went this year and had a total bill of $2,700. $2000 of that was at the resort. With the exchagne rate of 5 years ago that would have cost me $1,200, not the $1,900 it did this year. $500 of the $700 was for gas. I live in Kansas City and it is a 1000 mile drive. They also changed the rules on the tax rebate so that is another $100 cost. Put that all together and the trip this year cost me over $1,100 more than it did 5 years ago. Oh yea. Gas at the lodge was $6/gal. I take my own boat since my dad can not get in and out of a standard fishing boat. It is a great trip and I love to go. We catch tons of fish and have a wonderful time but the cost is getting up there. If I went with a bunch of guys and we all split the cost, that would be different."

Gas just to get there will be more than $10 for most, I'd bet. Like the previous poster said, your lucky if you got by that cheap. Al"
