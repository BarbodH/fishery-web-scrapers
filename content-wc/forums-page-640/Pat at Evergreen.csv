564035,Guest,2007-03-21 10:35:00,0,"Forest fires could definately be possible earily this year if the country side dont get much moisture and let us with a dry spring after melt off. Last fall the north country had lots of forest fires and most caused by t-storms. But in areas with logging if the fire band isnt on to shut them down too, they can start fires just as easy. So can fishermen being careless. Remember acouple years ago north of Sioux Lookout a huge fire ragged on for a long time almost needing to evacute the town. Lets hope for moisture for everyones sake."

The reasons are that in the spring it hasn't greened up yet and in the fall you are starting to loose your green up. I have been fighting fires for 15 years in NW WI and the Canadian fire make ours look like campfires!!!! The majority of the Canadian fires are started by lighting, not idiots out wandering around. Please register on this site so we can determine your background and great knowledge in wildland fires and surpressing them. I for one know that after a 2 1/2 to 3 year drought, it is lining up to be a BAD situation!!!! Duran"

Just looking forward to the walleye opener now; will keep the folks up to date with ice out and water conditions when we get that far; now we have 30"" or more of ice and snowing with 16-20"" on ground. Lake levels and rivers are low and we went into winter dry, pray for plenty of April rains."
563993,Hump,2007-03-19 08:46:00,578,"I was pulling for Wisconsin, as I was for all big Ten teams. I actually have respect for the U of Wisconsin. Doesn't hold true with your beloved Packers however. Hope your health is good and can't wait for our trip to Lac Seul and Evergreen. Hopefully it will rain and rain and rain this spring."
564002,Guest,2007-03-19 12:06:00,0,"I agree. I do have a question, I was looking for the policy's for walleye central on the postings. I cant locate them, where should I be looking to see these."

564010,Guest,2007-03-19 19:14:00,0,"i'm not praying for rains. some of the best fishing i've ever had on lac seul was when the water was down 6 feet. it was an eye opener, but good fishing."
564017,walleyeduran,2007-03-20 06:33:00,286,"Well Whit, if you don't start praying for rain, your fishing on Lac Seul could be interupted. If a large forest fire ignites in that area, they will close all the roads and evacuate the area, (this can last for weeks at a time). I would start praying for rain and not worry about your best fishing happening with water levels down 6 feet. Duran"

The fish will bite no matter what water level we see. That has been proven in both low and high water conditions on Lac Seul but a Forest Fire will make it a long summer. COME ON RAIN!!!!!!"
564032,Guest,2007-03-20 18:56:00,0,"i'm not sure about all that. the only time i experienced fires up there was in a high water year. i usually go in july, so there is always a threat (hot and relatively dry). forest fires seem to be more a function of idiots loose in the woods than mother nature. seems like there is always a fire ban going on in july. jmo."
