567896,Guest,2007-07-29 09:49:00,0,Just returned 7/28 Walleyes were close or in the weeds expecially around the cabbage. Weeds were in approx 6-9' range. Did pick up some on sand flats 10-14' Most fish were caught trolling crank baits or spinner rigs.

We stayed at Fisherman's Cove Resort, Scout Bay area. Fished Bay of Islands, Manitoba, Windigo and Stoney Point area, Dead Cedar Island and reefs nearby, Fishgut bay area, South Inlet, and Jackfish bay. June and July has been very odd weather wise....they got lots of rain in June and first part of July....lake is back to normal levels....This is my 4th year at Lac Seul....first time this early, normally go in early to late August...the beginning of the week it was very HOT!!! and NO WIND!!!.....lake was like glass...lots of logs/trees and stumps floating everywhere and you really had to watch out for them when boating....fishing was slow and you had to work hard for them, but still beats fishing in Northern MN where I live!!!.... :exactly: From Wed. to Sat....still HOT weather...but at least had slight wind of 6-9 mph.....and the wind really helped the fishing...black flies are really biting so bring LOTS OF BUG SPRAY!!! Fish are in the 5 - 10 feet of water just outside of weed beds....hard to believe they were this shallow this time of year....fish the wind blown side of islands...and use spinners mostly pink and chartreuse sparkly type, they seemed to like the motion. Or use 1/2 to 3/8 oz jigs chartreuse, gold (whistlers - propeller type), white, pink seemed to produce the most! First part of the week when it was beastly hot and still....we caught mostly walleyes in the 21 - 25"" range, very few eaters....then when we fished Bay of Islands once we got some wind, caught mostly eaters 15 to just under 18"" and filled out easily on walleyes to bring home.... Friday we tried to fish just Northern's in Jackfish Bay area.....bite was slow, so returned to Bay of Islands to fish and we caught and released lots of nice walleyes all afternoon...... :fishhit: Back home now....printing pictures of the trip and dreaming and planning to go again next year! If your going to this area of the lake, hope this helps and have a great time fishing :rock-on: and safe travel :driver:!!! Rather-be-fishing Again! :cheers:"
567903,Guest,2007-07-29 17:17:00,0,We were @ Fishermans Cove the same time. Small world! Good advice on the fly issue! Thursday was the worst I have ever experienced with man eating flies! WOW! Like flying piranas! Take extra spray!
