So, after attending the school for amateur anglers, at the first ever Canadian event of the PWT in Dryden, Ontario, she was elated to find out that as an amateur, I'd be taking all the orders when fishing with the pros. I think the prospect of me, a retired teacher, having to be the one to listen for a change, was even more exciting for my wife than taking part in all the wonderful scheduled events. The two of us had a great time at the 'Meet the Pros' evening and collected valuable tips and tricks of the trade. It was fabulous to be able to look over all the components that help make the pros fishing experiences so successful. I'm sure I left there drooling a little bit! Having met many of the other competitors, I was convinced that no one was more exhilarated than myself...with the possible exception of Brian Lium from Iowa. The two of us connected instantly and if you could measure the level of excitement for the event, I'm not entirely sure which one of us would have topped the charts. Steve Fellegy , my pro partner on the first day, taught me a lot about the concepts behind the techniques the pros use to target certain sizes of fish. He taught me several new skills that correlated with his philosophy. I had a great time fishing with and learning from Steve and felt completely comfortable asking him a variety of questions. Keith Kavajecz showed me a completely different set of methods, relating to the fish he was targeting in another area of the lake. He gave me a lot of insight as to how he used his electronics to locate these particular fish. He also demonstrated the importance of being completely focused right up until the very last second of a tournament day. The reward for such patience, was a 29 inch walleye in the last five minutes! What a thrill it was, at the end of the second day, to see my name in the lights adorning the PWT stage. My partner on day three was the tiller-man himself, Ron Seelhoff. Now, it turns out that Ron is a man a lot like myself in that he never minces his words. I am grateful that he immediately recognized habits that I'd acquired fishing different species. He did his absolute best to help me refine my walleye technique. Now, they say that you can't teach an old dog new tricks....it's even harder to teach an old teacher. I must have exhausted every bit of patience that Ron had left on that third scorching, hot day. I was in awe of the prize presentation at the end of day three and overwhelmed with the generous booty that I got to claim. And if you think I was a happy camper, you should have seen my new friend Brian-from-Iowa! I think it's safe to say you have at least two pro/am converts. After all was said and done, my wife turned to me with a little smirk on her face and said So, how'd you like being bossed about for three days? Hmmmm...in all honesty... I enjoyed ever single second. Sorry to cut this short, but I must take her out fishing. I have so much to teach her! Rick Socholotuk Fort Frances, Ontario"

To be there for the very first Professional Walleye Trail tournament in Canada must have been just awesome. I was to be there but due to some unforseen problems, couldn't make it. I know it will even be bigger and better next year for sure. I will not be one of those guys again saying ""I wish I went"". I will be there next year for sure helping friends and spreading about the awesome fishery Dryden has. And also should say something about the Dryden Walleye Masters held the 2nd week of june there, maybe some of the pro's would be interested in doing it also. dryden really did pull out the red carpet I heard from some of the anglers, very welcoming. Good job PWT, anglers, volunteers"
