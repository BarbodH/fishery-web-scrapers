567774,Guest,2007-07-25 12:18:00,0,We have fished the Chamberlain Narrows area in late July for the last 10 years. For the first time we will be going to Evergreen Lodge near Ear Falls arriving on September 6. We would appreciate any info on what to expect as far as the Walleye fishing and where we would most likely find them. Thanks in advance for any advice you can give us. locopoco

567859,REG,2007-07-27 15:36:00,445,"This is pretty worthless information since we fished that area back in 85-88. But we were right where you're asking about and we always fished the week after Labor day which is about when you're going. We would just fish the humps off points or drop-offs and almost always found the walleye schooled in 20-25ft. Use lindy rig or other slow presentation with minnows. Once you find one, work that area hard and there were almost always plenty of others, but they were very concentrated. And I mean if we found them at 22 feet, you wouldn't catch them at 21 or 23 feet - it had to be 22 feet. One time we dropped a marker after a catch and we had to be fishing straight down no farther than 2 feet from that marker. If we strayed any farther, no fish. But we pulled up a lot of nice fish. You'll like that area in Sept. - warm afternoons and cool evenings - leaves are changing and no bugs. And plenty of walleyes once you find them."
567877,Guest,2007-07-28 11:38:00,0,"Dear Reg, Thanks for your info. I'm sure what you experianced in the eighties would still be valid today to a large extent. I've also experianced the same phenominum of the fish seemingly concentrated under the boat. We like to jig fish and normally cast out from the boat and jig in slowly and it seems that the vast majority of the hookups occur under the boat. I don't know if the fish follow the jig in or if they are concentrated under the boat. I do know that we have learned to vertical jig just under the boat at the end of our retrieve for 15 to 30 secods and as a result the number of fish we hook has at least doubled. I wonder how many others have foud this to be true? Thanks again and have a great day! locopoco"
