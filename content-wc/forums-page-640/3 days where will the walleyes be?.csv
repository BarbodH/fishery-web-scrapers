I imagine wallwye may be on points and reefs 15-25 ft of water. Lake we are fishing is east northeast of Red Lake 60 miles or so, just north of Birch Lake 12 miles. Any tips and presentations and ideas would be helpful. Getting hard to sleep. 3 days Joe"
567872,campownerchick,2007-07-28 06:12:00,13,"Remember to ""fish the wind"". Yesterday was windy and the fish were easy to find and catch on windward shores in 6 feet of water. On another lake, the fishermen found them at 32 feet deep and were using bait walkers with twister tails. You'll have to experiment but you will find them. Be sure to bring enough beverages along, it is supposed to be hot for a few days."
567914,joeman79,2007-07-29 21:52:00,417,"Thanks for tip. One more day and a wake up and we head north. Staying in Hinckley, Mn at Casino tues. night and off early wed. morning to Ft. Frances, flying out at 1 p.m. I am so ready to go!!! Anymore advice or tips would be great. Packed way to much tackle. But have a 120# wieght limit so I took it all just in case. Have a flat of crawlers in bedding and a bunch of GULP minnows and leeches. Will post when I get back and hopefully get some good pics to post of the Blue Walleye that are in Richardson Lake. Love reading all the posts on here everyday, sounds like the flies are biting and it's been hot. But looking at forecast looks like it is going to cool off to near normal temps by the end of the week. 37 hrs and 10 miniutes can't sleep sorry for the rambling. BIG JOE"
