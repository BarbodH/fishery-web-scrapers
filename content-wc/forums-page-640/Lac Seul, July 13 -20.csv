567699,NateW,2007-07-23 08:37:00,96,"McKenzie was NOT a good place this past week. We hit several places in McKenzie that normally held good fish and this year not much. When you see a lot of boat traffic all morning on McKenzie-you know everybody is struggling. EVERBODY was constantly on the move trying to find fish. It seems like we've just hit LS at the wrong times. I have heard from people I know (and believe to be truthful) that three to four weeks ago LS was the best they had ever seen it. It's all about timing. This was my 6th trip to LS and I have been there when it is ""on"" and that's what keeps me coming back. It still beat a week in the office!"
567701,skindzier,2007-07-23 09:28:00,137,"Add me to the list too. We caught some fish everyday, but only had one day (Thursday) that resembled normal Lac Seul fishing. We caught 36 that day at the south end of Shanty narrows, with 6 of them over 24"". We stayed at Timberlane - nice camp. One cool thing is in the evening, they get a pretty good bite right off their dock. Half the camp comes down & its a pretty good time with everyone hooting & hollering at each other. I caught a 23"" and a couple others over 20"" there. Pretty different to be catching quality walleyes off a dock. Any of the other camps have a similar bite off the dock?"
567712,Guest,2007-07-23 15:00:00,0,Amen on the point about the office. My Dad was there in late May early June and until our recent trip he said he had never seen the fishing so poor. Our experience last week moved that trip to second worst. In May-June the water was way down. This time the water was higher than normal and I'll definitely second what was said about all the floating debris. Chris
567714,JN333,2007-07-23 16:41:00,11,"I will report when we get back. Last year we went to Eagle and a number of guests made day trips to Lac Seul, the fishing was great. So this year we switched over to Lac Seul...hopefully things will pick up. I have been warned that this body of water has many hidden hazards...one of the reasons I really dont like making long runs. Looks like we will have to get a guide for a day or two... Thanks John"
567735,Guest,2007-07-24 09:47:00,0,"Great post Nate...we made it home with no problems. We missed you on thurs. but your post was the same thing we had. I echo Nates review of the week. First half of the week was spent searching for warm bays with weeds to pick up a couple only to have the bite drop to nothing. But after the blow on Weds. night, the bite was on. The lake needed a warming and a good mixing in the thermocline to get the fish excited and moving to normal July patterns. When there is so much rain moving into the lake and very few hot sunny days to warm it, the fish were definately in an early June pattern rather than July. Early in the week, you had to fish SLOW! We picked up fish by not moving the bait at all, slip bobbering with a single hook with leech or worm or minnow. I know some of you have a deep seated feeling against such a tactic, but when you can target a specific spot, it really works. I am headed back up to Onaway on Aug 9 thru the 14th. I anticipate a much different bite. The warmer, sunny days (given there are some)will really change the water temps, and we will find a totally different bite. Will post again after next trip."
567761,NateW,2007-07-24 21:56:00,96,"Best day of the whole week and we had to pull up and leave early! I woke up about 3:00a.m. Thr morning--okay, who am I kidding...I finished playing POKER at 3 a.m. and heard then wind still blowing and KNEW Thr was going to be a slam-fest. Oh well, bad LS fishing beats anything resembling work! Steve, you got my e-mail? I'm in Madison from time to time (Mt. Horeb, actually) let's tip a couple cold ones sometime."

567875,Guest,2007-07-28 10:53:00,0,"Just returned from LS. Stayed @ Fisherman's Cove 7/21-7/27. Fishing in Scout Bay was average for LS standards. Caught many walleye within that area on crank baits and spinner rigs. Best day was when the group went to McKenzie and hammered them. Could tell many were having problems by all the moving around. Most walleyes were caught in the weeds 4-9' range. Last day they were in the 10-12' range on sand flats. Water temps are in the upper 70's to low 80's and was VERY warm with little wind. Finally cooled off Thurs/Fri. Fish are there.... just have find em! Largest walleye for the week was 26.5"". Pike fishing was active, but caught LOTS of small one's Can't wait... I'll be back in 4 weeks, for more. Mp3553"
567565,NateW,2007-07-20 14:43:00,96,"Just got back from LS about 3:30 this morning. Toughest trip EVER to LS. Lots of rain in the days before we got there and the water came up almost two feet the time we were there. Getting across the lake was a constant zig-zag trying to avoid floating debris--stumps, timbers, sometimes entire trees. Fishing was tough. The usual spots and favorite honey holes were dead for us. We'd go to a spot catch two fish then nothing, move, two fish, then nothing. It wasn't just us, talked to a guy from another cabin and he said he went the whole day without boating 1 single walleye. Some guys at camp did much better than us, but they almost all agreed it was the toughest week they had seen in years. Hardly any wind the entire time we were there, except for about a 20 minute t-storm on Wednesday. Most days the lake was like glass all day. The last day we were there the wind had blown just about all night and Thursday monring we caught more fish in the A.M. then we had all week. Of course that only happens on the morning you have to go. Stayed at Onaway Lodge, our third year here, and Blair and Kathy run a great camp. We're booked for next year. (They can't control the bite, right?) Weird thing happened on the way up, we saw two young wolves on the road to Dryden. We'd never seen wolves in the wild before and I had a camcorder handy so we slowed and I rolled some tape. The wolves didn't spook. So we started talking to them. One stood and looked at us for the longest time, then walked right up to our truck. Got it all on video. I'll have to find a way to post it on YouTube. Some WC regulars in camp that week too, everybody make it back home okay?"

The reason I ask, we are heading to Whitewing in a couple of weeks(our first trip to LS) and was wondering how the fishing usually goes on the NW side of the lake. Do you usually fish nearby, or do you have to make runs towards the main portion of the lake. Just looking for some general pointers... Thanks John"

567577,NateW,2007-07-20 21:37:00,96,"Onaway is straight across MacKenzie Bay, further SE down the lake from Ear Falls. We have often caught good numbers of fish within a mile or two of camp but we also travel 20 - 30 minutes from camp as well. We like to get out and explore. During ""normal"" years fishing is good close to camp, but so good it borders on obscene in some of the areas that are a little bit of a boat ride. We don't have to travel 30 minutes away, but we do because seeing and fishing new parts of the lake are fun."

567695,Guest,2007-07-23 08:09:00,0,"My Dad, son and I were all on LS 14-20th of July also. We were on Goose Bay near white wing. I definitely echo what the guy who started this thread said about the fishing this year. I've never worked so hard to find consistent numbers of fish. When we got consistency we couldn't get any size. A guy in a cabin near ours almost tore his Honda 75 four stroke off his lund when he hit a semi submerged log. The only thing left holding the motor on was his trim piston. We never made it as far as McKenzie bay so that might be a place to consider. The rumors that I heard at some of the camps and at the Four Seasons in Ear Falls said that was the most consistent area in terms of decent fish and numbers. Let us know how you did. After two years of less than stellar fishing on LS I'm starting to think of looking for another lake to fish. Chris"
