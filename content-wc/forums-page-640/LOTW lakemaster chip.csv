565686,1shooter,2007-05-29 19:11:00,1493,Has anyone tried the new lakemaster chip that covers the canadian side of LOTW? Specifically in the Miles bay area in 1' contours.
567311,1shooter,2007-07-11 17:41:00,1493,I ended up buying one. I loved the 1' contours but have to admit that at least for the area I fish in. The Navionics chip appears to be more accurate.

567845,rockpt,2007-07-27 07:49:00,589,I saw them scanning Miles Bay last Oct. during the three day snowstorm.
567852,1shooter,2007-07-27 12:44:00,1493,Maybe the snow storm is why it is not that accurate.
567855,rockpt,2007-07-27 14:36:00,589,That's a good one.:rotflmao: They spent the better part of one morning mapping a small bay outside our cabin with their hovercraft. At that rate I don't know how they could map the whole lake.

I looked at the Lakemaster site and it appears they have the southern half (or so) of LOW completed. Unfortunately for me, I do all my fishing in the NW Quadrant. Hopefully that will be done shortly."
567864,1shooter,2007-07-27 19:43:00,1493,I believe their chip covers all of the canada side but the 1' contours are in the miles bay area. Seriously though. I did not think the chip was that accurate. There were well traveled areas where the chip showed clear water and there would be a rock sticking out of the water. I'm sure they will figure it out though.
