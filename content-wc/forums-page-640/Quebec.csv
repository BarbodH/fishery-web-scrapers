567933,Guest,2007-07-30 17:32:00,0,I vote for Lac Poutrincourt also. I have been there 4 times over last ten years. To me it is tops. used to be a fly in only years ago but they put in some logging roads and now you can drive there. Road getting in is better now than 10 years ago it is worth the trip.
567934,fishthenarrows,2007-07-30 17:49:00,2,Thanks for the tip 200 miles of shoreline Sounds like Walleye heaven to me. Hope that they have Brador beer.
