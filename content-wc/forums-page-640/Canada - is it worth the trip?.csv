567893,Guest,2007-07-29 08:48:00,0,"Dave/All: I have been to Canada 6-7x and all over the midwest and part of the south fishing. I go to Canada with my father now who is retired in his late 60's and will go until he is no longer able and at that time I will be taking my grandkids. The quality time spent with him and with them is priceless, period. Like everyone else we are always searching for the best fishing and part of the ""fun"" is talking about the past/future trips. I am fortunate to have 6 weeks of vacation and my wife/I use them all. We have also taken our grandkids on a trip every year since they were infants(oldest just turned 15) and we just returned from Disney in Florida yesterday with them. My wife is not interested in going to Canada so we travel to places she/I enjoy(Maui,Vegas,etc)each year as well. Our thoughts are some day we will be physically unable to travel and when we are sitting in a recliner/rocking chair the memories we have of all the places we have been is the best $$$ we have ever spent. To be able to share the times with loved ones wherever you go is the reason to go. This is the reason I/we work. We work to live and not the other way around. Don't get me wrong, we work a lot..a lot but the tradeoff is worth it to us."
567898,Jigger1,2007-07-29 12:35:00,234,"Is the trip worth it? Hmmm let's see. I get to do one of my absolute favorite hobbies and that's catching walleyes. I do it in a breathtaking beautiful environment, on a wonderful body of water and at a super lodge. I completely unplug from the world for week and decompress. I spend a week with some of my closest friends and family. I come back about as relaxed as humanly possible. It's worth every penny and it's one of the most anticipated weeks of the year. My wife doesn't care to fish so she spends this week with family and fills it with things she like to do."
567899,lenray,2007-07-29 13:40:00,467,Here is what we do concerning the Canadian fishing. I am a young geezzzzer of 62 and have made a lot of money and can go and stay or fly into anywhere I please. That being said---We drive 1200 miles one way from central Michigan and go up a river system 20 miles and camp in a tent and then portage off the main lake and fish portage lakes from a canoe or a small 14 footer. We eat some of the fish we catch--don't ever bring any home. Going up this latter summer early fall with two guys making for a total of three of us. Total price gas - food- camp permits - lic. eats on the way and back $ 350.00 per. Never ever see another fisherman and the fishing is not to be believed by those who haven't fished NW Ontario secluded lakes. We have fished a lot of lakes up there and if we ever see another person we move on to more remote water. This is the way a lot of the local fellas do it. No guide no prepared meals no other fisahermen JUST seclusion. Not for most but that is what we desire.
567850,Guest,2007-07-27 11:38:00,0,"Mike, If your giving away corvettes for birthday presents, I need to go fishing with you. lol"
567853,downriverbob,2007-07-27 13:13:00,880,"I am lucky like many of you I have a wife who even before we were married enjoys our fishing trips. Our vacations this year are/were the following: Lake Gogebic in upper peninsula of Michigan in February for ice fishing. In May we were in Grand Marias/Seney, Michigan for stream fishing and even did a little pier fishing ! In a month we go to LOTW, Whitefish Bay for two weeks mainly to fish for musky, we also bass, and lake trout fish. Late October we will again be in the upper peninsula near Escanaba for bird hunting/turkey hunting if we draw permits! Of all of these trips my favorite is the LOTW trip, we stay at a small family run resort on an island in Lake of the Woods. The fishing for muskies can be tough at times but you cannot beat the surroundings. We do American plan so there is no cooking and more time to enjoy fishing! I spend a ton of money every year on vacations but never regret it. I fellow I worked with made a ton of plans of things he was going to do after he retires, two weeks after his retirement party we were going to his funeral. Denny died of a heart attack playing basketball! Don't worry too much about the future, it will be here before you know. I am retired now, my wife will be after December 21 of this year,we still plan on doing the things we enjoy as long as we can ! BOB"
567854,Guest,2007-07-27 13:41:00,0,I have a question for [email protected]
567858,REG,2007-07-27 15:25:00,445,Do what you have to do - even if it means taking your wife. But it's a dangerous precedent to skip a year.
567860,Guest,2007-07-27 15:36:00,0,"Let me give you a different perspective. I have been going to Canada since I was about 10 years old and I am now 47. This June, got back from anothter great trip, this one with with 76 year old father and 15 year old son. Mid-way through this July I go the diagnosis of acute leukemia. I will beat this but, from this side of the pond, there are lots of great things to do in the world, but my summer hightlight will remain the week in Canadaian wilds. Yes, the trip can be expensive, but we all can afford it if we want to make that effort. This is a bit rambling, but that is the effect of of the chemo, but my son has already bet me that he will break this year's 30.5"" walleye next June, and I am looking forward to chat challenge. Take stock of every day and rejoice how wounderful each of them because when your outdoors you can see heaven all around. If yhou choose to do something different than Canada, super dupre, just make the choice to do some positive and enjoy it. ....Cheers...IA Walleye"

567888,Guest,2007-07-28 20:22:00,0,"DO NOT SKIP A YEAR.... We went up every year, since 1981. Great fly-in out of Red Lake. The group changed a bit every year, anywhere from 8-16 people. It started out with my dad and his work cronies, their kids, et al. It was what i looked forward to every year. I made my own jigs by the hundreds for everybody. I made custom made rods for me and others in the group. We went from fishing 7am to 11pm, to sleeping in a bit. We always caught fish. We fished in snow in June to 90's in july/August. Live outside Chicago, so it was an 18 hour trip. As time went by Louie got cancer, so his group dropped out. The kids started getting married and changed priorities. Dad is now in a nursing home. 3 years back we decided to skip a year, as i was getting married. That was the last I saw of Red Lake. My bother now can't get off in the summer, so no one is really pushing to go. My new pre-made family makes it very hard financially. I don't own a boat, or a truck to pull it with. When I was younger and didn't have good jobs, I still found a way. Why not now? My new wife and her daughters like to fish, but I don't think they could stabd a week away from TV's, computers, cells, etc. Not sure which way to go. I just don't know what to do! Gotta get back into the habit somehow. I know I'm rambling, sorry. Just don't skip a year! It is worth it!!"
567891,Guest,2007-07-28 21:15:00,0,Absolutely worth it. Have been going each year for 20 years. Still alot of value if this is what you enjoy.
567892,Catman59,2007-07-29 05:15:00,345,"Its just a ""thing"" I guess. My kids have grown up with the ""camp kids""........ they look forward to it as much as I do. No phones , no TVs.... We have cut back on a few things. We used to go up and stay in Dryden , eat at Knobby's on the way through Sioux Lookout( EXCELLANT I might add ) etc , then drift into our camp early Saturday afternoon. Now we get up early and make the trip non stop and save $200-$300 + just on the overnight and the extra Canada gas. We figured our entire trip this year was less than $1200 for 5 people. 2 Years ago we went to Barrien Springs Mich for the weekend to hang out at the sand dunes and get some fresh fruit. That cost over $1000 for 3 days. Sorry to ramble , but yes its worth it and it is definitely a family affair while it lasts...."
567834,AllenW,2007-07-26 21:00:00,11482,"Been doing Canada and northern Minn since the mid 60's, long about the early 80's they quit being the camping/fishing trip with the wife/girlfriend/whatever and became strictly fishing. About 1980 we started to hit Red Lake in the late fall and there were usually 2 or 3 boats and sometimes 4 that would go, it was the ""guys night out"" kinda deal. Over the years the crowd thinned out and the last few years its been usually just me and whoever I go with. At 59, some of the trill is gone, but it still is THE trip to go on. The new boat has rekindled the desire to get out more, and I see a trip for next year, also want to hit LOTW for muskies too, haven't done that yet. So, is the trip worth it, you bet...I doubt you'll regret it. Al"

567846,gombater,2007-07-27 07:52:00,3,"I agree with a lot of the comments aready posted. I don't have the years in like most here (7 this year) but it would be very difficult for me to give it up now. Since I started fishing in Canada, I have had to relocate halfway around the world to China. If anything, this change has made my annual trip to Canada even more important - getting away from city life, pollution, and back to my home culture for a little bit. Because where I now live it is not even advisable to touch open water (lakes, rivers) I only get to fish 1 time per year. Good thing it's Canada. I really don't even care how many I catch (although that's never been a big problem). My wife knows this trip is therapeudic for me, but there does need to be a balance as others have stated. I get a week in Canada, she gets a week where ever she wants to go, and our third week is family vacation time. Our schedules run a bit different now that we are out of country, but we all make sure we do/go places we want. It's all about balance."
567847,jigman 2003,2007-07-27 08:13:00,981,Had my worst trip ever this year. I'm going back next year. Just using an outfitter who I have had excellent trips with before. Live and learn.
567848,Guest,2007-07-27 08:15:00,0,"Since everybody is in ""their own boat"" so to speak as far as homelife circumstances, I'd say that you're the only one to make this call. My wife doesn't like boats, bugs, or fishing. She sends me on my way with the guys with a smile and she goes off to see her sister in Seattle. Been doing it for 25 years now. Now that the kids are in high school, my son comes with me and the daughter goes with her. They sometimes meet her two sisters somewhere for a week and shop and sight-see but they rarely spend as much as me and my son on a fly-in. We also take a week or 10 day trip as a family and a couple of long weekends together so it works out OK. We have a 17 hour drive to our usual outfitter; long going up, much longer coming home. That's the only part that I dread and have made other plans a few times because of it. It IS getting expensive but so far the money hasn't become an issue. If cost was a problem, I'm sure I wouldn't do it anymore until the kids are older."
567849,Mike Kansas,2007-07-27 09:34:00,1463,"I take my wife every year on at least one trip to Canada. On a trip to Evergreen Lodge on Lac Seul a few years ago she caught a 31 1/2"" Walleye. I had a replica of it made and gave it to her for Xmas. It was the first time i ever saw her tear up when she opened a Xmas presnt she said ""This is the best present I have ever had"". Now that may not seem like much but she has had her fair share of nice presents from Diamonds to Corvettes. But that Walleye is #1 in her heart. Every year she talks all winter about how she can't wait to go to Canada and fish. One of her goals is to catch a ""Great Northren"". I have told her that Great Northrens are a type of bean and she should dream about a big Northren Pike instead of a bean. Next year I plan on taking her to a lake that a 40""++ Pike is a lock (her biggest to date 35""). I have created a fishing monster...lucky me. If anybody can tell me about a lake that I can make her BIG PIKE dream come true on I would appreciatte it and so would my little fishing wife. Thanks, Mike Kansas"

I guess in the big picture, that means I'm doing something right!! :) Dave"

It's to the point now where we are all up in the middle of the night doing stuff the night before we leave because we are so excited about leaving we can't sleep. There are things that my family and I have witnessed in Canada that we would never see other than in Canada. Plus when we get down to it, I am not totally sure if we could take a week's vacation 16 hours away in the states for less money that what we spend on our trip to Canada. Just my 2 cents though. Renn"
567817,Guest,2007-07-26 15:58:00,0,"dave, we've been married going on 38 years, so maybe there's still hope for you down the road. a trip to see the kids is worth a lot more to her than any trip we would take together. mothers are that way, or so i hear."
567818,Guest,2007-07-26 16:13:00,0,"We have 48 years and she isn't really into fishing all that much. That's why when she says lets go and......(what ever) I just say sure that sounds like fun. We have been in boundry waters, a 7 week camping trip to Alaska and back, many many trips west. All it takes is a bit of ""sure Hon, that sounds good to me."""
567819,Guest,2007-07-26 16:34:00,0,Just the fact that you would even ask the question makes me think you should probably forgo Canada for a family trip to the nearest tourist trap.
567822,Guest,2007-07-26 20:02:00,0,"I am 40 years old now and my first trip to NWO was in 1978 with my family and grandfather. Myself, Uncle, brother, and cousin still take regular trips to Perrault Falls every other year. To us, this vacation is a return home since we owned a camp in the area for several years. We have each stated that we'll never give up our trips to Canada for several reasons. For many of us it is the only place we can get out of cell phone range, eliminate background TV noise, and never hear the house phone ring. It is a week of fishing, relaxation, and a period of time where we can do exactly what we want to! The people that complain about the cost should take a closer look at their lifestyles. $20 per week (or 5 packs of cigs) for a whole year will easily pay for your trip to Canada. Personally, I do electrical work on the side to pay for my Canada trips. I blow every cent and never look back or feel guilty. I took my kids to Disney World 5 years ago and spent $4000. Never again. Next year my son will take his first trip to CA with the boys. My girlfriend and I leave in two weeks. I would not miss it for the world!"

567799,dave10,2007-07-26 10:34:00,342,"Guys - I will acknowledge right off the bat that I tend to overthink these sorts of things (see my ""What have you learned from Canada"" and ""Preoccupation with the catch"" threads). :) :) However, I am genuinely interested in folks' perspectives on this one. Assume 1) 12 hours plus of driving each way with boat in tow; 2) $800 plus per guy in cost; and 3) fallout from a spouse who would prefer to see more inclusive family summer vacations than just ""the boys are going off to Canada"" each summer. Throw in the wild card that when in Canada, you EXPECT to catch lots of fish which makes slower than normal action doubly frustrating, and you have some food for thought. Given all that, is it worth the trip in, your view? What dimensions of this am I overlooking? I'm getting pressure to take a hiatus from the annual trip (seven years running at this point), and despite the fact that I have always had a great time, I find myself half-agreeing with her. I have the good fortune of decent fishing on my home lake, which makes this even more of a challenge to think through. All shots are fair game (including ""happy to have you stay home, Dave, so there are more fish for us!"" sorts of responses). :) Thanks! Dave"

With possibly another addition to my family next year, I doubt I'll be going. It's a lot to ask of my wife to take care of the family, the house and still put in her 45 hours at work, while I take 9 days of vacation (most of it on my Canada trip). All that, and not including that I've not been on a vacation with my wife in the last 4 years, but I've been up to Canada with the boys 5 years straight. It takes a lot of time/planning/money to get to Canada and back, and yes it's worth it. If you can make it work, keep doing it, but a time may come when this trip is outweighed by other priorities (for me at least). I look forward to everyones response."
567810,Guest,2007-07-26 15:02:00,0,The older I get the longer the 14 hours of drive time each way seems to get. The price has gone up quite a bit since we started 10 years ago. Some of the group has dropped out and we have added some new guys. I think the rates will take another jump now that the dollar & the Looney are almost the same. Some of the guys have had DUI's so I worry about that hassle. My guess is I'll continue to go but it wouldn't take to much convincing to stay in the USA and fish for muskie
567811,Guest,2007-07-26 15:04:00,0,"I think that you have to make that choice for yourself. My wife and I are leaving tomorrow morning. For us it's probably more than a 14 hour trip so we have a stay over in Int. Falls. Everyone has to decide what they have for expendable income. We don't go north every year but when the time is right, we always enjoy it. Yes, it is pretty spendy and if I had to watch every penny that was spent we couldn't do it. How ever, that being said, I'm ""old"" and there are only the two of us and our expences the rest of the year aren't that huge. As far as catching fish, I've been going north since 1962. It started as camping and a canoe. Then camping and a canoe and two little kids. All in all, the choice is only yours to make."

For me, it's ten straight hours in a boat. For her, it's a few hours and then something else ""natury."" I don't think I could bear being around all that great water and not having a line in it! :) Dave"

No phone, no noise, just a good time no matter how good or bad the fishing might be. So yes it is woth it to me. Sometimes we take friends or one of our sons will go with a couple of his buddies. So it is sort of a family vacation in a round about way."
