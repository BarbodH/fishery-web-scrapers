6724443,Eckohlt,2023-03-17 15:59:00,3685,Ya but you want to catch more than one fish In a week.
6724471,kasmere,2023-03-17 17:59:00,20,"Northwest Ontario outposts fishing is always a challenge with the weather. Good for the guys fishing hard and getting a great catch of walleyes for the week. I've never thought of a successful day/week as fishing in a ""bathtub"". I fished Cobham and its tributaries. Everything is a challenge and always blessed when we come back safe and sound!1"
6722027,Eckohlt,2023-03-10 13:03:00,3685,"Those are 2 completely different write up's on that lake,crazy.For you Jambi crazy good."
6722039,kasmere,2023-03-10 13:59:00,20,EckYes going back with Amik To Vee Lake. Vee is the head waters to the Cobham river system. We usually always go to new lakes and outfitters. However Amik did a great job and gets us back to back. We met turkeyriver last years and flew out together to different lakes. Certainly back up the walleye fishing on the Cobham system. I'm 71 and have enjoyed many trips and lakes......Cobham is a bucket list choice.
6722053,Eckohlt,2023-03-10 14:15:00,3685,"Sounds good,I have a good friend that fishes loree end of may for many years,he ask me a year ago about other outfitters because he thinks Amik is kinda slipping on taking care of that camp,he didn't mention any of there other camps!Ive heard good things about blackbirch lake I believe it's called!"
6722059,kasmere,2023-03-10 14:44:00,20,we almost selected Blackbirch. on our list.
6722063,Eckohlt,2023-03-10 14:52:00,3685,"It's dam tough to get to all the lakes you want to fish,my big list I'm not gonna see most of them."
6722343,turkeyriver,2023-03-11 16:02:00,80,You'll like Vee. We're doing Blackbirch twice this year. Looks like a lot of water to explore
6724419,bluegill8,2023-03-17 15:13:00,5,"I fished the Cobham River Outpost with Amik the last week of July in 2022. It was extremely good for walleye. Eyes averaged 20 to 22 with our largest at 27. We caught 682 (2 guys) for the week. Camp was nice and comfortable. We are fishing Vee Lake (Amik) this year, which is the head waters for the Cobham River System."
6724421,walleyecheek,2023-03-17 15:17:00,2231,kind of like fishing in a bathtub isn't it ! I personally like a bit of a challenge !
6724431,Eckohlt,2023-03-17 15:42:00,3685,"Cheeks if you like a challenge try Minnesota,good luck may the force be with you."
6724433,walleyecheek,2023-03-17 15:47:00,2231,Fished Winnie for years. Sorry its not about how many fish i can catch in a Week ! I'm not in a tournament ..........LOL.
6721679,bthomas3333,2023-03-09 11:04:00,465,Seems like everything is up 20% this year. Im thinking before long any fly in that isnt a short 20 min hop will be close to 2k for a week. Stuff that used to be 1200-1400 are showing 1600 now.Oh well...Just got to work more.B-
6721685,Eckohlt,2023-03-09 11:15:00,3685,"You are exactly right Brett,I'm getting to old to work more,might cut it down to one flyin trip a year and cpl drive to places,I wanted another crack at trout lake near red lake a short flight,until I check on the cost at boois,that idea went out the window!"
6721691,Davebramlett,2023-03-09 11:32:00,32,"I would like to hear some more about this trip. Dates, etc. My son and I would be coming from Arizona so we would depend on you for food/drinks. Thank you, Dave Bramlett 602-647-8887"
6721793,turkeyriver,2023-03-09 17:31:00,80,"If you put a gun to my head I'd say the other two Cobham cabins have the best walleye we've had but every other lake of theirs has given us ""giggle fishing"" at least a couple times during the 5 days we take. By that I mean your jig barely gets to the bottom before you have another one on, at least 6 times in a row. We don't count much and we don't fish sunrise to sunset but we are rarely long without action. Of course midday on a hot sunny quiet lake is tough wherever you are. Have a depth finder with you."
6721799,turkeyriver,2023-03-09 17:56:00,80,"And if you're staying in a motel the night before flying out, try the Balmer Motel in Balmertown. It's not fancy but has a great hometown bar/ restaurant attached. After our 13 hour drive it's become our home away from home."
6721853,Franco,2023-03-10 05:08:00,107,Thanks to all those with good tips and advice. The trip is now fully subscribed. I'll write up a report when I get back.
6721861,kasmere,2023-03-10 05:40:00,20,"My brother and I flew into Cobham Morley cabin last July. Awesome walleye numbers, great cabin and boats/motors.We also caught several in the 26-29"" range. Also I concur with turkeyriver comments. My brothers are going up to Vee Lake with Amik this summer. You guys will have a great trip!!"
6721875,Eckohlt,2023-03-10 06:11:00,3685,You going back??
6722013,jambi,2023-03-10 12:26:00,504,Sorry you had a bad experience at Darkwater Lake. It was sold to Northland a few years ago and I can attest everything is top notch now. I went here 6/22 and going back 6/23. Walleye fishing was stellar. Reported back here:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=733094
6722015,Old Timer,2023-03-10 12:41:00,255,Nice report on your 2022 trip.
6721449,Eckohlt,2023-03-08 16:52:00,3685,"No Degree required to join WC,just need to own fishing equipment."
6721481,bthomas3333,2023-03-08 20:17:00,465,Cobham has an excellent reputation and I would happily join a group fishing it. I have heard the Manitoba side (another outfitter on the West side/Cobham River Lodge has a good outpost. Came this '' close to fishing the outpost this summer) is better but it is definitely worth a trip. Like Eck I'm tapped out or I would be interested. If I was planning the trip specifically for walleyes I'd target the MB side and earlier in the year. Easier to catch 100 fish a day when they aren't 25 ft deep. :-) Good luck! Post a report after your trip! Brett
6721531,Eckohlt,2023-03-09 06:35:00,3685,"I'm gonna check that Manitoba side for the Cobham,maybe future trip."
6721603,turkeyriver,2023-03-09 09:21:00,80,"I've made a dozen trips with Amik on several of their lakes and going twice again this year. Too bad about Dark Water for you but I know they didn't own that camp for long. I'm guessing it's a good lake for part of the year but not consistent. I think I heard John say when the water got a little low the fishing was poor. They advertised it as a numbers lake for families if I remember right. I've been to all 3 of their Cobham camps, some more than once. The river camp is the most remote. If you can't catch all the walleyes you desire you're doing something wrong. Not huge numbers of trophy size walleye, but they are there. River camp is more known for big pike but we like the walleyes more. As far as the mice and boats go, we have no complaints about the boats and mice are in all flyin cabins aren't they? We keep everything a mouse could chew in sealed totes all week just to be safe. The plane? Yeah it's old, but not held together with wire. John's been flying for I believe close to 30 years. When the bug hit, the gov't hired John and his plane to fly stuff all year to their power line construction site north of Red Lake. I don't think they would have hired a bum with a unsafe plane to fly their material. They have mostly repeat customers so that says something."
6721607,Eckohlt,2023-03-09 09:32:00,3685,So turkey which camp is your fav for walleyes????
6721609,bthomas3333,2023-03-09 09:42:00,465,Their outpost on Lost Lake (not real name of lake for whatever reason) looks really good. Remember I have turned to the dark side of being a pike first guy so that system has some bigones...Plus the never ending walleyes as a break. Just looks good and for a couple hundred more than a generic ON outpost. Very interesting.Plus it is almost always sold out by January if that says something...Brett
6721631,Eckohlt,2023-03-09 10:02:00,3685,Brett are looking at Cobham river in Manitoba or Lost lake from Aikens lake lodge??im pretty sure it started out as Cobham river in Ont then to Cobham in Manitoba??
6721663,bthomas3333,2023-03-09 10:49:00,465,Meant to say Hidden Lake Outpost
6721667,Eckohlt,2023-03-09 10:54:00,3685,"Ok,I was lost for a minute there."
6721677,Eckohlt,2023-03-09 11:01:00,3685,"Hidden probably more than I like to spend,got a wife n cat to feed here,plus a guy yesterday told me to buy a crap load of ripple shad there deadly for walleye,so I'm deciding whether to feed the wife n cat or buy a sht load of ripple shad,,,take a guess which way I'm leaning..Id probably go with Amik for the price but hidden looks awesome."
6721211,Eckohlt,2023-03-08 07:38:00,3685,"Always fun to check the trap line in the cabin,or hear the snap of the trap!"
6721367,nitroman,2023-03-08 12:40:00,368,Everyone bring traps and pitch in $5 per trap they set and see who catches the most in a week and wins the 70% of the pot and the other 30% goes to the biggest catch?
6721379,Eckohlt,2023-03-08 12:48:00,3685,"Hate to be a frikin mouse in your cabin,land mines every where.lol,usually the mice run in certain areas such as the stove n fridge,is that where your assault starts??instead of calling you nitro,I'll call you ramboman."
6721381,Franco,2023-03-08 12:55:00,107,Next mouse I trap is going on a 2/0 hook and pitched into the weeds
6721419,Eckohlt,2023-03-08 15:23:00,3685,"Oh!!!I thought the fry pan,surf n turf for diner."
6721427,bagman3324,2023-03-08 15:37:00,1,On one of our trip north we learned how to make the perfect mouse trap.Its a five gallon bucket half full of water. Make a ladder for the mice to climb up to where there if a beer can covered with peanut butter that spins on stick. They climb on the beer can then spin and they fall in the water where they drown.We have caught as many as ten in one night.Fish ON!Good mouse hunting!
6721431,Eckohlt,2023-03-08 15:39:00,3685,Where were you staying where there was that many mice so I don't go there???
6721443,7 Mag,2023-03-08 16:29:00,1887,"I do something similar with a bucket of water, I use a board or some type of ramp and sprinkle cereal or sunflower seeds on top of the water, they don't realize it's water until after they've jumped in."
6721445,Eckohlt,2023-03-08 16:35:00,3685,"Learn something new everyday on WC,who needs college."
6721447,7 Mag,2023-03-08 16:43:00,1887,"Lots of very smart people on this site, I've sure learned a lot!"
6721129,Franco,2023-03-08 04:19:00,107,"Yes I see now they owned that outpost several years ago. They probably sold it for all the reasons you list. Honestly I don't care too much about the mattress, the mice or the outhouse. I only care about the fishing. Cobham River is over 200 miles from Darkwater Lake and the people on this forum seem to think it's an outstanding fishery. Maybe they're wrong?"
6721149,Eckohlt,2023-03-08 06:01:00,3685,I don't think holland is trying to compete with n.w Ontario!!
6721153,Eckohlt,2023-03-08 06:03:00,3685,"I hope you get to cobham then we can get a first hand report,get to the nitty gritty about this river system!"
6721183,Franco,2023-03-08 06:49:00,107,Thanks! Will do my best and will hopefully be able to submit a full report.
6721185,bbheli,2023-03-08 06:54:00,1387,"I did not care about the mice either till they got on top of the fridge somehow and we had no bread for the week to make our sandwiches, I did care about the fishing but when you cant sleep and cant make lunch and the fishing sucked well......Drink Beer and wait for the pick up LOL"
6721187,Tristian5431,2023-03-08 06:55:00,37,I need details on this pike fishing lol hahhah
6721191,Franco,2023-03-08 06:58:00,107,I hear ya. I had that happen to me once at a drive in. It got so bad I left a day early. I learned from that experience to always pack a few mouse traps and I've had to use them more than once.
6721197,prov1800,2023-03-08 07:09:00,5010,"I wasn't trying to get into any argument.Iam not saying Canada is no good.i do guide and live in NWO and yes fishing is fantastic on a much larger scale.Not as many fisherman in Europe as in North America.The post was about the best fishing in the world.My relates travel in Europe to different countries like fisherman do here in North America.Sweden,Norway,Austria,etc.The fish there far exceed the sizes we get here,daily we get more probably,but size wise we don't compare on how big those fish get there.Not trying to knock down the fishing here its about as good as it can get.Zanders are our version of a walleye if you didn't know that check out how big they grow there.There pike can go 60"".iam totally happy to fish here out my back door"
6721203,Eckohlt,2023-03-08 07:20:00,3685,I bring a cat he chows on those mice like there's no tomorrow.
6721209,prov1800,2023-03-08 07:30:00,5010,Tough being a mouse at a outposts for a few months.
6721079,Golden Eagle,2023-03-07 19:30:00,2642,I've fished the Cobham River Outpost several times. Walleye fishing is good.Top 3 is a stretch. I was never disappointed.
6721089,Franco,2023-03-07 19:42:00,107,I don't think you've fished northern Ontario if you think lakes in Holland can compete.
6721091,Eckohlt,2023-03-07 19:47:00,3685,"I think he has fished n.w Ontario,he lives there n guides there.lol"
6721093,Franco,2023-03-07 19:50:00,107,"Eckohlt, anyone who says lakes in Holland can compete with lakes in extreme Northern Ontario lacks an understanding of the walleye fishery in Ontario and in Canada generally."
6721099,bbheli,2023-03-07 19:53:00,1387,"What lake ? I flew into Dark Waters I think it was called with Amik. was the worst trip I have ever been on, very disappointed after all the stories I heard about how good it was supposed to be and we had 4 good sticks. The cabin was so so but invested with mice, the beds were plywood with a 3"" mattress, the outhouse was a trip to visit at 3AM having to walk 500' in pitch black, Sat Phone barely worked and I would never go back again. Far more better destinations. The plane was not the one in the picture, Tte Plane had things mended with chicken wire and duct tape. The Pilot was good and well skilled. The boats were junk. https://youtu.be/yKSxlphkHA4"
6721101,Franco,2023-03-07 19:55:00,107,That's not Amik. It's another outpost.
6721105,Eckohlt,2023-03-07 19:56:00,3685,That's gonna burst Franco's bubble!!
6721111,prov1800,2023-03-07 20:39:00,5010,"Got plenty of understanding,more than you might think."
6721115,bbheli,2023-03-07 21:22:00,1387,It was an option that Amik offered a some years back when I went.
6721127,Franco,2023-03-08 03:55:00,107,"Well the data doesn't support that. Ontario records trump Holland records. Fishery in Ontario is nearly 30 times the size of Holland's. Population density is more than 30x lower in Ontario. Not sure why someone who claims to be a guide in Northern Ontario is saying Northern Ontario is not as good a fishery as Holland. Kind of self-defeating, isn't it? Anyways, this was just an attempt to round up some good people to fish with. I have no interest in getting into an argument."
6721017,Franco,2023-03-07 17:09:00,107,I'm looking to put together a group of 4-6 for a trip out of Red Lake Ontario on the above dates. It's a very remote fly in and the cost is $1650 for the 6 days (plus food/beer/etc).. The system we would be fishing is probably among the top 3 walleye fisheries in the world. Happy to share more details with those interested. I'm from Toronto and sadly most of my friends don't fish!
6721023,Eckohlt,2023-03-07 17:17:00,3685,"Sht,I'm already booked for Aug 13 fly in,otherwise I'm in on that world class eye lake!"
6721025,Eckohlt,2023-03-07 17:22:00,3685,To be honest I never knew n.w Ontario had 1 of the top 3 best walleye lakes in the world!!
6721031,Franco,2023-03-07 17:32:00,107,"NWO is the walleye capital of the world…aside from maybe Northern Manitoba! There could certainly be an argument, but this system is definitely top notch, both numbers and sizes. I know, I know…too good to be true. But according to the WC forums, it is!"
6721033,RichA$1970,2023-03-07 17:34:00,1159,Whose the outfitter & lake?
6721041,Franco,2023-03-07 18:05:00,107,"It's Amik's Cobham River outpost. If you search these forums, you'll see that it's absolutely top notch."
6721043,Eckohlt,2023-03-07 18:12:00,3685,Franco can you put up a fishing report about your trip when you return??
6721071,prov1800,2023-03-07 19:12:00,5010,"What exactly makes a lake the best in world.I have relatives in Holland,they love to fish and send me pics of the Zanders,Pike and perch they catch and there isn't a lake in North America that could compete with the waters they fish.4 are coming to Canada to strictly fish muskie as that species they don't have.The pike they catch are bigger than our muskies.So might have to re word your post as maybe best in North America.But still let me know why it would qualify as #1."
6721075,Eckohlt,2023-03-07 19:22:00,3685,I think he is going by the older posts he read about the cobham river system here on WC.Not exactly sure how he figured that out.
6721077,Eckohlt,2023-03-07 19:24:00,3685,Maybe some guys on here have fished it and can comment on the fishing there!
