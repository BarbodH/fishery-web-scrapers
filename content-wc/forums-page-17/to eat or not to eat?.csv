6701445,Knutson21,2022-12-15 07:22:00,348,"We do big breakfast 2 or 3 times in the week. Our Main Meal is between 2 & 3 so that we can evening fish. I am not up there just to fish, I am up there to unwind from the everyday life back home. I enjoy coming in and making a dinner and sitting and relaxing."
6701453,proguidedream,2022-12-15 07:46:00,345,"at fly-ins days are long and lots of time to fish and they bite all day long. breakfast is normally skipped, exept on the last day it is clean up and massive brunch, inlcuding walleye and hashbrowns. usualy do one or 2 classic shorelunch , the other days are sandwiches on shore. 2 boats bring the gear and everyone agrees on location down the lake so no time is wasted driving back to cabin for lunch. dinners are normally late, dusk or if not dark. 5:30 is prime cocktail time in the boat enjoy the evening. planning an ""appetizer night"" is normally the best meal of the trip. everyone brings something small to share, can be slider burger, spring rolls, or simple as a queso dip. this bill is not split and everyone just donates what they spent as their appy to share. and fish and fries for dinner, or some variation like fish tacos. paper plates, and those tin trays save a lot of clean up."
6701501,stjoeguy,2022-12-15 10:24:00,979,"We have a big breakfast every day. Biscuits and gravy twice with some type of eggs, bacon/sausage and toast on the rest of the week. First on up makes coffee. We're old so we're up by 6:00 and on the water before 8:00. Years ago we did shore lunch every day. That was great but: A - we're older now and it's a lot of work. B- it takes a lot of time. Now we come back to the cabin for a sandwich or maybe soup or chili. Occasionally, we'll do shore lunch if there is a first-timer to Canada in the group. There will definitely be shore lunch if I can get a grandson up to Canada. We're back for dinner by 5:30 or 6:00. Dinners are full meals with fish fixed one way or another 4 nights. Spaghetti is always on the final night so we're not eating fish out of our limit to take home. We never get back on the lake after dinner. That's time for sitting on the deck and having a drink watching the sunset."
6701529,Cutting Edge Official,2022-12-15 13:52:00,242,"If that is your take, that's great.....not mine...I am in the crowd that when I, with the group I get together with for a fishing trip, we do what we enjoy doing the most.....fishing...that's not to say we don't eat well, it's more that we plan more efficient meals, many times bringing sandwiches and water and sodas on the lake for lunch so we get to enjoy what we came for in the first place....to fish. There is plenty of time at the end of the evening when we sit and maybe have a beer or two roast marshmallows or whatever and shoot the s**t...I have many great memories from past trips and most have nothing to do with preparing big meals with big cleanup! Now, I will say, that the longer the trip ((how many days, not distance) the more likely to throw in some big meals. Weather can also dictate whether we put more preparation into meals ( e.g. rainy days). I eat well most days and go to many gatherings for social events throughout the year......my fishing trips are exactly that....fishing trips.....most of my great memories on the trips are related to time out on the lake and I'm old enough (58) to know that is what gives me the most pleasure.....I can eat anytime....I can't fish anytime! Definitely not saying that you are wrong though for your viewpoint though, as we all have different takes on what we enjoy out of life! Just to let you know, my Dad is still alive and kicking but does not fish or have any desire to go fishing anywhere, so that does change things I'm sure...everyone in our group is my age or younger and we are die-hard fishermen when we get to our location!"
6701557,Riverkeg,2022-12-15 17:38:00,134,"My group of 3 does the same routine, every day, every trip. Quick breakfast of coffee, cereal and toast (or a couple of donuts). Lunch is the focus…walleye and potatoes (with bacon, onions and mushrooms) and a vegi de jour. The first couple of years we did shore lunch but now we go back to the cabin. Dinner is either burgers, brats, or pork chop sandwiches except on the last night and that is frozen pizza. We take some snacks out on the boat in case we get into the fish and delay lunch or dinner.We’re pretty simple and appreciate the whole of the trip. The food, the lake, the cabin, the fishing, the scenery, and the company."
6701573,kettyspanky,2022-12-15 19:35:00,271,We do the breakfast as a good meal. We take sandwiches and snacks for lunch in the boat. We do a good supper every day. I make alot of things ahead of time and freeze it. We multitask and clean fish and cook a meal at the same time. A slow cooker is great to take along for a ham or roast. Fish fries are usually every other night so suppers are usually easy. In the morning we are on the water by 6am and don't come back until about 2pm. It's clean fish and do a meal and go out for the night bite for probably 2 hrs. I'm usually the camp cook and I enjoy it because I'm a early riser anyway. Good luck and do whatever is the best for you.
6701575,valley366,2022-12-15 22:33:00,193,"I am usually on trips with my kids (14 & 17) so try to make it an experience. I usually let them sleep in a bit while I do my morning routine. Shower and cook breakfast. Is eggs and bacon, pancakes and sausage and biscuits and gravy. Rotate the 3 though the week. As they are older now and can contribute we have started getting back into shorelunch several times a week. Previously was just sandwiches on a rock someplace that they could get out and explore. Around 5pm we come in and have our bigger meal of the day. We like to BBQ so is usually burgers, chops, steaks and chicken on the grill. Then back out for the evening bit. A lite popcorn or snack while they are showering and getting cleaned up.The kids really enjoy the shorelunch and have started to contribute in the meal prep. Is interaction time for all of us."
6701597,jambi,2022-12-16 06:40:00,504,"Plan who you are fishing with for the day the night before. Next AM: Breakfast - everyone cook there own. Now if multiple people are up at the same time, which usually everyone is up by 630am - one man eggs, one man bacon, one man toast. We are on the water by 8am which is plenty early IMO. Lunch - skip the shore lunch. You're right its a lot of work. If it's a must-have then do it once or twice during the week. Pack sandwiches, drinks, chips and eat out on the water. Better yet find an sunny flat rock and get out of the boat to stretch, even a quick sun bath snooze is wonderful. Dinner - plan on a nice two hour dinner leaving an hour or two to fish afterword. That's a little harder in the fall when the sun drops away quicker in the evenings. I love being in the boat when the winds lay down and the loons start calling. I dont care if I catch a fish but its the best time of the day to be on the boat and have a couple of cold ""pops"". Maybe a little trolling, or some jigging, who cares. The calm of the evening is heavenly! We keep it very simple but do a little planning with the dinners. Fried 2 nights, blackend 2 nights, grilled 2 nights...then simple side dishes, salads, etc."
6701631,scobec,2022-12-16 08:16:00,112,"We are now down to only 3 or 4 of us on the trip. We all cook, clean the cabin, clean fish and bartend. We have found that two big meals a day is all we need. Those who get hungry can make a sandwich. Fast food for the drive up and pizza for the first night so we can fish that day. We typically have a big breakfast around 8am, go out on the water around 9:30. I take up enough frozen sausage gravy so all we have to do is heat it up and bake biscuits for two mornings. Then it's eggs, ham or bacon and hash browns for the other breakfasts. On the first or second morning we will put a ham in the oven at 250 while we are out fishing. We use it mainly for sandwiches and breakfast. Then come back in around 3 or 4pm for an early dinner and back out on the water around 5:30 - 6pm. We're off the water at dark which is anywhere from 8pm to 9pm depending on the month. We used to have our big meals then, but I've found that leads to too much work at the end of the day and very late meals. I take 4 trips a year that range from 5 days to 8 days. 8-9 hours a day on the water for 5 to 8 days is plenty of fishing for me."
6701633,NM_Trout,2022-12-16 08:18:00,1094,"Lots of variables to consider. Weather being a big one. Is it a great day? We will be on the lake. Raining or blowing hard? We spend more time indoors. The trip to Canada isn't just about fishing. Its mostly about fishing. But when you have all that extended twilight, it isn't unusual to have 18 hours of fishable time each day. After we boat 70-200 fish in a day, mostly walleyes in the 14 to 21"" range... well, the fishing gluttony hangover starts to sink in. Meals become a little more lengthy, shore lunches stretch out a bit. We started fly fishing more when we are in Canada. It slows down the catching a little bit, and is a whole lot of fun. Since our group is small, we don't plan out meals, and we will frequently eat sandwiches in the boat. But we also have some fantastic meals at camp... and nobody complains ;-) If somebody likes to cook, and has a heart of a servant, I'm appreciative of them and it is of little cost to me to simply be respectful of that service. I appreciate their display of friendship. Great thing is that there are multiple boats available, so if somebody wants to do something different, they are free to have at it. Sometimes the cook goes in early to start while others fish. When we are in camp, we don't make any fixed plans to force anyone to eat, nor do we force anyone to stay in the boat if they would rather go have a good meal. ""Whatever goes"" is more of the theme.BTW... we also never go for short trips, so maybe this plays a factor too. If we were only up for 3-4 days, I bet we would be spending much more time just fishing."
6701643,LoDo,2022-12-16 08:28:00,721,"We don't focus on breakfast as much as we used too. I prefer this way too. We buy plenty of cereal, bagels, etc... and try and get out of camp quicker for the AM bite. Our lunch is deli sandwich, chips, apple, deer sticks, snacks, etc.... Our dinners are definitely the big meal. We go all out with steaks, smoker, fish, wings, etc... The grill is used 90% of the time at night. Sometimes we'll prep a casserole in the evening, first to wake stick in oven. Breakfast burritos prep'd the night before works too."
6701713,nitroman,2022-12-16 12:18:00,368,"Over time the big breakfasts have gotten smaller. Some of us are early risers so we start making breakfast and if you're up and want to eat we will hook you up. On the water ~8ish with a cooler full of snacks and sandwhiches. If it's a crappy weather day then back into the cabin for lunch and a nap maybe. Most days it's lunch on the water though with a quick boat nap (one eye half open looking at that slip bobber)! Evening meals are late afternoon consisting of burgers, lasagna, fish, pre-smoked ribs. Besides the fish all meals are prepped pre trip and take little time to prepare. Back on the water for the evening bite if the weather is clear. We like to clean fish while making dinner so when we return from the evening bite it's just beers and bed! Every aspect of the trip is looked at year over year to refine and reduce the time we spend doing thing besides fishing and hanging out on the deck telling the days fish stories. Those dinner time breaks and end of the day beers are some of my favorite as I love to hear the stories of the day. Even better when you have newbs and kids along as the excitement in their stories is awesome! Watching memories made in real time can't be beat. Of course the stories and tales from years past are a lot of fun as well!"
6701931,rknott,2022-12-17 11:27:00,89,"Interesting read and aligns with my experience. Early in life I was all about the fishing. Minimal food, maximized time on the water... I got pissed off and amazed at how some guys would waste so much time. On one trip the club met at 4am for breakfast and still didn't get on the water until 6 or 7. I then came to realize some guys liked the breakfast more than fishing. I have decided what is wrong with that? Key is find someone or a group you align with. As I have gotten older I am starting to understand the value of relationships more. I am fine not catching the biggest fish and find I am equally happy not fishing all day long like I did in the past."
6701989,Donscs,2022-12-17 16:19:00,379,"Just 2 guys and we keep it pretty simple. My buddy likes to do the cooking so for breakfast we'll have a Craig (his name) McMuffin, English muffin, sausage, cheese, and sometimes with an egg, and hit the lake between 7:30 & 8:00. Back to the cabin for lunch around noon and grab a sandwich and maybe a little nap. Back on the lake around 2:30 and back to the cabin around 6:30 and make dinner, fried fish, burgers on the grill, or a stew we brought from home, plus some simple side dishes. After dinner might do some casting off the dock or just kick back and have some adult beverages, usually the latter. On the road we'll stop at something like Arby's and go inside to eat and stretch our legs."
6702003,kona77,2022-12-17 16:58:00,236,"Our group usually has a full breakfast every morning around 7 or so. Does not take alot of time to make a bigger breakfast scrambled eggs/sausage or bacon.. We have pancakes at least three times a week with ham or sausage. Once again does not take much time to make. Myself and another guy do most of the cooking but everyone chips in for dishes/chores etc. We do not have an organized lunch and that allows everyone to do their own thing for most of the day. Will have deer sausage/pre-grilled brats and chips/pretzels/cookies for lunch for guys who come in. We usually try to meet for dinner at 5:30. Will make fish at least 3-4 times a week. Fried fish on the deck.. fish taco's and my favorite bacon wrapped fillets etc. Usually will have a meal of spag/meatballs with the meatballs already cooked and frozen with the sauce for the trip up. We always have one steak night with some type of tator . We also stopped having shore lunches unless we have a newbie who has not had the experience. Have to admit it is a lot of work but still fun to have once in awhile. Most nights we still get out fishing and then end up sipping a bourbon or a few beers on the deck. The great thing is we have had a couple of lakes with great night fishing right off the dock. Always nice to listen to bands like Floyd, Petty, Seger etc with a rod in one hand and a beer by your side. Even better under the stars or moon if we stay out late."
6702011,Eckohlt,2022-12-17 17:56:00,3685,"Throw in alittle Uriah heep n Black Sabbath n ten years after,that will get the party started.lol"
6702185,rzep,2022-12-18 17:47:00,1196,"Every time I eat a full meal, I get relaxed , lazy and sleepy. Therefore , I try to keep meals to minimum while going fishing. It also helps with keeping bodily functions at check later on.Once the fishing is over, I dont mind descent meal I dont have to prepare."
6723981,Walleye2242,2023-03-16 12:11:00,263,"What a great post. Very true. I have experienced both side. My dad and gramps and the old group of 10-12....tons of food and eating. tons of packing. my goodness...we use to pack tons of groceries, motors, trolling motors, gas cans, batteries, battery chargers, depth finders, boat seats. good god man....10 guys of that!!! I miss the old group and the great food and the card playing at night. the camp owners back then had to think we were nuts when you can just rent a boat with it all up there but thats the way my gramps did it so thats the way it was done. Now...just me and maybe 1 or 2 guys. I rent the upgrade boat with all the fixins there and get groceries in canada since food is just as important and i can literally grab my 2 ultra lights, box of jigs and be out the door in an hour for canada these days."
6723983,Eckohlt,2023-03-16 12:17:00,3685,"Which do you prefer,the old days or getting out the door in a hour??"
6723989,Walleye2242,2023-03-16 12:24:00,263,"Sir....pretty emotional as My gramps is gone and my dad passed at 59. way too young. So i sure miss the old group for sure and wouldnt mind doing a big dinner during the week. Playing cards. All the interactions that a bigger group brings. the stories...the banter back and forth. However, I really do not miss eating ALL that food and ""planning"" the whole fishing day around food. I enjoy the freedom of how things are done now but sure do miss the old group. My gramps was the director and planner of the trip and what he said...was how it went. I feel lucky enough to have experienced both i guess. they started bringing me up in 1979 when I was only 7. Dad and gramps were both brickmason and had a farm. they would work 7 days a week all year just to afford the week trip to canada. was their only vacation."
6724001,Eckohlt,2023-03-16 12:40:00,3685,"I think over the years,things have changed for about every group I'm sure,and it will keep changing.Just keep going fishing n do what ya got do to get there."
6724035,Pooch,2023-03-16 13:21:00,4618,"If it's a cold rainy morning then a hot breakfast hits the spot. Good weather morning it's quick bite then on the water. Our big meal is about two in the afternoon with snacks and a card game after the evening bite is over. It's a fishing trip not a race.Wife and I just cereal and light meals. Easy and little effort. A grilled cheese before bed seems to be a habit, too.Every group I have fished with has a different rhythm. Pooch"
6724053,jambi,2023-03-16 14:40:00,504,These mornings are kind of nice. I think everyone slows down at breakfast and has an extra cup of coffee to warm up a little more before heading out.
6724057,btyreprich,2023-03-16 14:43:00,1067,"When we changed from American plan to housekeeping, i was quick to offer my services as the person in charge of the menu and cook. As my one friend drove the boat, I felt it to be a fair trade. In fact, I rather enjoyed planning our meals based on the sale papers from local grocery stores. Yes, fishing was the primary focus of the trip, but we did enjoy some great meals over the years. I made a personal choice NOT to eat bologna sandwiches at any meal. People are right, as you get older, you don't eat quite as much and the number of people going on trips diminishes as time goes on. However the memories of enjoying a good meal with everyone helping out will stay with me for many years."
6725295,prov1900,2023-03-20 22:45:00,544,"Our group has changed in numbers for the last 20 years. There are four of us that have pretty much stayed the same, but we have added our kids which is awesome. My two boys wouldn't miss it for the world. Our meals have changed though. Way back in the beginning we were eating what we called the ""pork trifecta"" on an almost daily basis for breakfast. Baked potatoes from the night before were chopped and fried in bacon grease and ham and sausage (along with chopped bacon) were added with some onions and lots of seasonings. Couple fried eggs on that and we were good till dinner time. Well as we got older, that trifecta meal was getting to be way, way too much for the ole ticker. We still make it once a trip now, just as a salute to time past, but quick granola bars make up the majority of the day startups for us now. I bring an AED with me just in case as we are all in our mid to later 50's now. Can't eat like the 30 somethings we used to be LOL. Dinners are pretty consistent. Steak night, burger night, etc, but we always try to have a fish dish of some sort every night. Lunches are always what ever you want to pack but are light. Dinner time is still special for our group. Time to unwind and drink a beer or three with some good stories from the days events."
6726287,northernbite,2023-03-24 07:15:00,1186,"It started with my very good friend I believe in 1990. Camped fished and had great time. 2 years later we brought his cousin, went on till 97 and my best friend died. Then it became a cluster, 3-4 boats still on an island. Different people then 2 0f them died. now we don't go at all. On this trip that is. The rest of story; that trip was in the Timmons area. In 2000 my cousen and I bought a camper for truck, pulled the boat to Pickle Lake, he had been going there for 20 years at that time. Went every year for 22 years, then Covid, went last year going again this year. The old timers trip. He's 77 and I'm 74. One more time. Never give up!!!!! Paul"

6714523,Walleye2242,2023-02-14 13:06:00,263,I have heard amazing things about this camp and the fishing.
6715053,lmoore,2023-02-16 07:37:00,40,"Our group has gotten significantly younger and larger over the years and so time on lunch has dropped significantly. We still do a good breakfast, whoever is up first gets that and coffee going. When my grandpa still went we would find a spot and pull up for lunch, we didn't do fish because we do that every night but we would do soup and sandwiches or something like that and just relax for an hour or so. Now we make sandwiches and eat while we fish. I like the added fishing time throughout the week. I have some fond memories of stopping for lunch, but that had more to do with sitting around and BSing with grandpa about fishing than the Dinty Moore Beef Stew or whatever we ate."
6715739,Ohio fisherman,2023-02-18 13:22:00,988,"My preferred breakfast is really good blackberry tea and excellent muffins. Protein bars in the boat in case hunger hits. Mid-day shore lunch or go back to camp to cook fish or sausage /eggs / homefries or some sort of a meal. Then explore a more distant location and fish the way back towards camp until dark. After dark maybe a sandwich. If the weather turns lousy, more time in camp and better meals. If the weather is great, mid-day meals may be preempted by peanut butter sandwiches in the boat. On trips with some guys, they have been shockingly lazy and contributed very little. Those experiences were not repeated. With other guys the American plan worked well. Trips for wife and I are great because we share the work and enjoy the adventures. Trips alone are extremely simple."

Big meal at 2pm and then back out for the afternoon/evening bite. A sand which when we get back for the night for those still hungry. No pressure, if you are on a good bite and don't want to come in, no problem we will put the leftovers in the fridge for ya. If you want to skip breakfast and get out early go for it! it's your week so make it yours!"

Some folks love flying in, others drive. Some folks want numbers, others want experiences. But in the end, we all just want to be up there with people we enjoy. There isn't much better! Our group has figured out a great balance. We have a full 7 days so we find time to fish really hard, but we also find time to sit around a nice meal, or sit around a campfire and have a drink and a cigar. Some mornings we get up before dawn, others we sleep in. Some nights we sit up and watch the starts, other nights we rack out after dinner. Why not have it all?"

If they're patties, it's a hamburger. Seasoning it Italian style or Mexican style doesn't make them meatball patties or taco patties, does it? Or, maybe it does?"
6714279,camp chef,2023-02-13 10:53:00,915,"Cocktails, appetizers, cooking gourmet meals and our ongoing cribbage tournament dominate the day. Fishing is great as well, just not the most important part of the trip any more."
6714489,rockape,2023-02-14 10:09:00,215,"I have been heading up to NWO for over 20 years. I'm not much of a breakfast eater, but we do cook bacon and eggs 2-3 times a trip. We don't get fishing until about 10 am. We make 2 sandwiches per man, and hit the water. Might be back by 78 or 8 if the bite is good. Then we fry walleye and pike at least 3 times. We eat turkey and venison for the other meals. One year, we ran out of food! Had to catch walleyes to eat! No we were never over the limit. I'm beat after a big meal and some beers. Euchre a couple of times, but time to recharge for most of us. Food is slightly important, but not the be all end all of the trip. Fishing trumps eating! I have enough in reserve that I could go days without food!"
6714495,fishron,2023-02-14 10:44:00,317,We have succumbed to the american plan. With a five day trip to Garden Island Lodge on Lady Evelyn lake we want to maximize our time fishing. There are good spots to fish a minute from the lodge. We can hit them in the two hours we have before breakfast. The rest of the day is off to get into the wilderness (packed lunch) except for a couple shore lunches and back to the lodge for supper. In June we will have extra hours to fish the evening. The meals are promised to be great. No clean-up. Boats are 16 footers with 25 four strokes. Staff services the boats as soon as you dock. Campfire and bourbon later. Been doing the Canada thing for fifty years. I deserve a break.
6702369,Baseline,2022-12-19 20:08:00,3207,"Rarely is there more than two of us on frequent trips across the board during the summer. Living close to Canada we make several trips of 3 to 5 days. We always have a big breakfast and head toward the boats around 7 to 8 am. Fish till 2 or 3 and then come in for a dinner type meal. We split up the food prep and cooking. Usually take a bit of down time then head out for a couple hours in the evening. One thing we always do is have a camp fire. In June when it gets dark after 9:30 pm we have what we call the day fire. On fall trips when it gets dark around 7pm we light it up at dusk. The fire is always a great way to end the day with some relaxation and tell old stories. On the ice trips there is always a larger group (4 to 6 fishermen) and the days are short. Everyone is up at 6 am and we eat a big breakfast. We take turns making lunch out on the ice. Usually some sort of brats, chili or hot sandwich. We get back to the resort right at dark and each trip member is in charge of bringing a hot meal to share one night. After a hot dinner there are a couple games of Farkle which is easy to play and inspires lots of laughs. On March trips there is more daylight and we keep the same schedule just fish a bit longer into the evening. We also take a couple 3 to 4 day ice trips to US Lake of the Woods for some ice fishing. My group of 2 to 4 stay at a resort and we use day houses for fishing. The resort we use has a buffet breakfast so we hit that up in the AM. Usually eat a light lunch of chili or sandwiches while out on the ice and then head to the Resort's restaurant for dinner."
6713421,Jose Walsh,2023-02-10 08:19:00,2,"Food and meals can play an important role in a fishing trip, but it depends on individual preferences and priorities. For some people, cooking and preparing meals is a big part of the trip and they enjoy spending time together around the campfire or on the shore, cooking and sharing meals. For others, as you mentioned, fishing is the main focus and they prefer to keep meals simple and quick, so they can spend more time on the water. I rather prefer to have a complex swordfish sheet pan dinner, than to eat a sandwich. It's great that you've found a way to make food work for you and your fishing trips, and it's important to remember that everyone is different. The most important thing is that everyone has a good time and enjoys their experience. Whether you're eating a full breakfast and dinner or grabbing a quick sandwich on the go, as long as you're happy and satisfied, that's what matters. Ultimately, the food and meals on a fishing trip are what the group makes of them, and the experience can be tailored to meet the needs and preferences of the individuals involved."
6713625,SweetD,2023-02-10 20:25:00,243,"Critically important!!! My award-winning, tantalizing, awe-inspiring French Toast breakfast delicacy is a masterpiece to behold. At least that was what my fishing group always says!!! TO EAT!!!!!"

6713713,RichA$1970,2023-02-11 09:55:00,1159,"I’m there to fish & no offense, but N. Ontario isn’t the culinary capital unless it’s fresh fish. I wake up early to fish from 0600-0900 whileThe others are sawing logs in the bunk & then making a crap breakfast. As a nice guy, I always make sure on the way out while they are snoring to crop dust them with a nice juicy one they can savor in their fart sacks until their actual breakfast."

6713815,JAY221,2023-02-11 15:04:00,877,"Food and meals are a necessary item. We do a very light breakfast such as a microwaveable sandwich. Put together a small cooler of drinks and snacks and head out fishing by 6:00 am. Always have jerky in the boat. Come back in for walleye lunch most days about 11-12 or go somewhere for lunch to break it up some. Back out about 2-8 and then get some supper. The meals do NOT make the trip the fishing does. Later, Jay"

6713895,prov1800,2023-02-11 21:29:00,5010,I do love those parties I guide that tell me to come early and enjoy a breakfast with them.Never turn those down.
6702223,Slim03,2022-12-19 03:53:00,159,"Our group goes pretty much all out. Fast food on the way up and back. Breakfast is early with bacon eggs and toast. On the water 7:00-7:30. Around noon we find a nice shore and do shore lunch. Everyone has their role during it and we knock it out fairly quick and allows to stretch the legs a little bit and break up the day. Then back to the lodge around dusk and big dinner or steaks, chops, burgers,etc. we always have salad or other vegetables with dinner. We have thought about scaling back over the years but everyone enjoys it and chips in so we continue even though it’s a lot of work."
6701599,GBS,2022-12-16 06:49:00,2271,"Group of 5, doing the same annual trip for 20 plus years. In earlier years it was full breakfast, sandwich lunch, a big deal (or really big deal) cooking extravaganza for dinner. Great memories of the time working together, hanging out, etc. But..as we have aged, the hauling of supplies, the amount of food we should be consuming, and all the prep time have greatly decreased. Coffee, maybe toast for breakfast. Maybe cheese and crackers or simple 1/2 sandwich for lunch, easy dinners - fish, burgers, steaks - with only a side or at most two. No homemade bread, no multi-course scratch German meals, no huge seafood boils, etc. anymore. But still great times with good friends. The best times - sitting on the deck or around the campfire with beverages, solving all the worlds problems. We still fish, but aren't driven - everyone else has left the dock when we roll out, we're the only ones in for afternoon naps, and evening trips are optional. But we still have several fish meals, and go home with limits, so all is good."
6701617,hammerdown31,2022-12-16 07:36:00,12,"We take a little different approach, we eat a cereal bar for breakfast and hit the water around 5:30 to 6. Have a sandwich about 11 while on the water. Come back to camp around 2 to 3 and cook a big evening meal. Burgers, fish, spaghetti, porkchops, steaks etc. Small group but we each take an evening meal so that one person is not always cooking. That gives us time to explore the camp, rerig, clean fish for supper etc. Then when we are ready we head back out say around 4 to 5 and fish until 10 ish. Come in take a shower, make a pb&j and go to bed. If we have bad weather we will make a big breakfast etc. Time on the water is important for us. Dry hooks dont catch fish! We typically spend more time on the water than anyone else in camp."
6701367,Walleye2242,2022-12-14 18:02:00,263,"How important are the food and meals on your fishing trip? Does cooking, cleaning take up your trip? I know everybody has different trips and can do whatever they want. When i started going my gramps was the camp cook. It seemed the day revolved around food. Group of 10-12 guys. Full breakfast every morning...bacon, eggs, pancakes..potatoes. then clean up. Might get on lake by 830ish??? Shore lunch at 1230ish. I love shore lunch of course but they are not easy. then dinner around 530ish? big dinner as well...turkeys, hams, more fish. Eating was just a big deal. Now that i am 51 and pretty much the group is like 2-4 now since my dad and gramps passed on i think back and like..man---i fished like maybe 6 hours a day. all we did was eat and clean up. Now when i go...my meals are as easy as possible and quick as possible. will cook up up a bunch of burgers and chops for the fridge....breakfast...grab a burger and bun warm it up and lets go. PB and J or a chop sandwich in the cooler for lunch. Pot of chili always ready to warm up and fish for dinner. i just want to fish as much as possible. I would love to have a day or two with the old group and eat like that for a day or so but i prefer how i do it now. also on the drive up back then it seemed we stopped at resteraunts for breakfast and lunch...took forever with a group of 12 guys. now i hit subway and eat as i drive. Like i said each to their own and its what is important to each group. Would love to hear what other groups do and how they handle things."
6701377,7 Mag,2022-12-14 18:35:00,1887,"It depends, if my wife is with me, we usually have a big breakfast, come in for lunch and leftovers for dinner. If it’s just me, I’m there to fish so I go early in the morning and i fish until late afternoon. I have a big breakfast, sandwiches or lunchables for midday in the boat and when I come in I’ll grill something or fry fish and drink a couple of cold ones.For the trip, it’s mostly stop for gas and fast food but the last couple of trips I’ve stopped at a Culver’s and went inside to relax for about 20 minutes before hitting the road again. I take lots of water and snacks for the trip as well as in my boat."
6701379,Eckohlt,2022-12-14 18:38:00,3685,"For me anytime out of the boat is down time,so you know where I'm going on this subject."
6701387,Hook_settr,2022-12-14 19:10:00,127,"My group of four aligns closest with how you do things today. We still eat three squares a day but they are pre-planned and pre-prepped as much as possible to expedite each meal because at the end of day, fishing is priority one. We usually spend 7A-7P out of the cabin with a shore lunch each day. It also helps to have chore divided up so that everything gets done and everyone can have as much down time as possible. We also just pick up fast food or something from one of our fuel stops to make the door to door trip as quick as possible (usually less than 10 hours). Some day when I’m retired and not trying to show horn everything in, I could totally see stopping for a sit down meal to break up the trip. Every group has their own way of doing things."
6701393,birddogger,2022-12-14 19:23:00,43,"Take it from an old guy. You'll remember the meals ,cooking, prepping, having a beer with your dad and grandfather more than the fishing when you're an old man. Just saying......."
6701397,Mojo-NC,2022-12-14 19:54:00,1929,"It depends on what you are looking for in your ""Canada Experience"". Do you want to focus on fishing or hanging out with your family/friends? We used to do the big breakfast thing too - for a while. In a large group, some guys like to stay up late and sleep late, and others crash early and get up early. I tend to wake up with first light regardless of what time I to to bed. I really don't like looking out over the lake at water that initially looks like glass turn to a walleye chop while waiting for the others to get up. We switched it up and now we get up, make some coffee, maybe grab a snack out of the frig, and hit the water. We come back to camp at 9:00 or 10:00 and have a nice breakfast. We skip lunch except for maybe some snacks, sandwiches, or leftovers from the frig and fish until dinner. That works perfectly fine for me and we get a little of both worlds. We may or may not fish after dinner. It's always an option. I hate that we miss the shore lunch experience, so we do that at dinner some nights instead. Otherwise, we've simplified our dinners as well. What used to be more elaborate dinners are now burgers and fries, pre-prepared meals from Costco, pre-made meals from home that just need to be heated up (spaghetti and meatballs, lasagna, etc.). I prefer the simpler approach."
6701407,RichA$1970,2022-12-14 22:40:00,1159,"KISS and I want to be on then water fishing as that’s why I go there, not for someone wanting to be on Top Chef. I’ll pack some deer sausage, chili & sandwiches as I might come back for lunch and fry fish or pack a simple lunch & stay out all day. Breakfast is a granola bar as they take forever when I could be on the lake. On the drive the stops are quick as once again I want to get there. I stopped shore lunches as even though they’re nice, too much time unless they have a drive thru. This is just my take but also it saves $$$"
6701415,btyreprich,2022-12-15 03:15:00,1067,I am the camp cook and enjoy doing this. I start watching the grocery store ads a good month before our trip to take advantage of sales / plan out dinners. Traditional breakfasts and shore lunch at least 3 times out of 7 days with burgers & sausages on the other days. Everyone helps in meal prep so it doesn't take all that long and are able to get in a full day of fishing. I know there are groups that would eat sandwiches for dinner and that's fine. We choose to eat better. We have now started to bring meals prepared in advance from home to cut down on the meal prep time. After dinner the 3 guys like to play cards. I'm content to listen in and prepare the shore lunch kit for the next day.
6701433,guidedfishing,2022-12-15 06:27:00,531,"It depends on the type of trip, when we pack in, and have easy access to cabin/campsite on smaller lake where we can zip in and out I only do a brunch and a evening meal. We are there to fish and eating twice a day works well for us. typically 930 - 1030 range. It depends on weather, fishing etc we have no hard and fast rule. I will make scrambled eggs', Ham, fried potato's, or Biscuits and gravy, or Pancakes and ham. I can cook and feed 5-6 guys pretty quickly. Then Supper is typically grilled, or fried fish prepared with different side dishes. When on the bigger lake or traveling to out lakes where we don't have access to the cabin or its not practical to return because of distance I will cook a traditional early morning breakfast similar to above, Then everyone is on their own to make sandwiches or what they need for the day, then I cook the evening meal similar to above. Everyone pitches in it goes quick and certainly eating is not the focus of the trip. If someone wants to keep fishing no worries, there is always PBJ or Ham to make a sandwich if they get hungry or decide to skip a meal."
6701437,port1042,2022-12-15 06:44:00,509,"Fishing is important but spending time together is too. Our group is 5 guys at a drive-in camp with full modern facilities. If you want breakfast you're on your own. Mostly a microwave sandwich or a toaster something, but plenty of coffee is available. We generally hit the lake by about 7:30. Noon is when we have a ""supper"". I'm the head cook and we have our big meal at that time. We're generally off the lake around 11:00, eating about noon, and we're back on the lake about 2:00. We eat again about 8:00. It's generally hot sandwiches, leftovers, and a few beers over a game of cards. Eating is the time to share stories, complaints, compliments and belly laughs. It's a close second in importance to our time spent fishing."
