6727501,Ohio fisherman,2023-03-28 17:11:00,988,Fluorocarbon as a leader on braid has been wonderful for me.With that combo I catch more fish.The suicide duck looks fantastic!It is new to me so I bought a couple just this winter.I have not bought lures in a long time.My favorite lure for pike has not been made for maybe 70 years.Shannon double bucktail twin spin.Still have a few that I bought in an old tackle box when I was a kid.
6727509,prov1800,2023-03-28 17:45:00,5010,"Good luck with the suicide duck,let me know if you catch anything.I will attempt to throw it agai a few times this season."
6723331,RichA$1970,2023-03-14 16:55:00,1159,"If it’s Al Lindner than anything Sufix, VMC or Rapala is the answer to catching fish as they feed him all the $$$$$$$$$$$$$!I give him credit as he built an empire but it’s a lot better to reading what you experts have to say as I doubt many of us have all of the resources these video marketing prostitute warriors have."
6724787,Hunts1,2023-03-18 18:34:00,123,"I agree with the braid main line/flouro leader approach. I prefer braid as my main line and add 6-8 ft of flouro. Use this mostly for walleye fishing and match the braid plus a few pounds of strength for the flouro. I use it now on all my jigging, casting and trolling rods. Good sensitivity and strength with the clear leader. Catch more fish. Better system for me and now my boat mates. I attach Seaguar blue label using a Lefty Krey knot. Super simple even in a moving boat. Here's the knot I use: https://youtu.be/GDxGy3Nld2g"
6724849,MikeG1,2023-03-19 06:56:00,433,Bass Pros Excel is made by Seaguar and cheaper. I'm 100% sure of this as I've seen the boxes Excel is shipped in. Those boxes say Seaguar. It's private labeled.
6725153,MrSimon,2023-03-20 08:41:00,922,"I love the Lindners have spent thousands of dollars based on their TV show .... and am pretty happy with the results. But last time I went walleye fishing I threw on some 6lb Trilene mono and crushed em. Cheap, simple, effective. I used to always use 10lb power pro braid with a flouro leader. It was fine. But when jigging in less than 20' of water I found I just didn't need it. Now, If I'm drop shotting on the St. Lawrence in 40' of water with heavy current, the braid/flouro is the only way to go."
6725179,Old Timer,2023-03-20 09:45:00,255,"The TV and Internet fishing celebrities are salesmen who use a fishing sequence to sell their products and services. It apparently works. But they have advantages that are unavailable to the majority of fisherman. By way of example, they live in a target-rich location, they can cherry-pick the very best weather patterns and they have terrific intel from locals, guides and camp owners. And maybe a guide is in a nearby boat. I've seen that. Al Lindner has been successful in the fishing industry. Good for him. I remember 50 years ago when he gave fishing seminars at local high schools. Back then, Al's seminars seemed to key in on weather patterns, like fishing stable conditions and before a front. And never after a cold front.. Then he moved to the Lowrance Green Box on how to find shoreline breaks and sunken islands. Those two topics are what I remember most from his presentations and I sat in on several of them. They were all good. Nobody was being endorsed by products back then. Well, you can't sell weather so I guess that's why promo guys don't speak much about it. But IMO it's the single factor that most affects fishing success. However, less so at good fly-ins where fishing is always good enough. And for the promoted products? I generally avoid what's being hawked on TV and the Internet. I already know that a common jig and some meat will be more than sufficient. And any line will work too."
6725183,Eckohlt,2023-03-20 10:01:00,3685,"I remember many years ago at a babe winkleman seminar,it was fuzzy grub this fuzzy grub that,what did I do,went bought a crap load of fuzzy grubs,I'm smarter now,lol."
6725193,MrSimon,2023-03-20 10:49:00,922,It's OK to like some of the big fishing personalities. They are cool. And it's fun! And it's OK to buy gear that is pitched by your favorite guys. That's also fun! Sometimes people need to let themselves feel young again. When my kids use KVD baits because they got his autograph once .... that's awesome and I love every second of it. Could there be a better bait? Sure. Could I have saved some money on a different brand? Sure. But why? As an adult I still do it. And it brings a smile to my face.

They couldn't catch a walleye to save their skin so they resorted to other methods to catch a couple nice walleyes. They spent 2 days hauling those 2 walleye around the lake to film them being ""caught"" on the new lure. I just listen to all of you on here for tips and tactics and what works. Most new lures are designed to catch fisherman and sometimes they are better at that then catching fish lol! Not saying that a new shinney lure doesn't end up in my cart now and then filling me with hopes and dreams but less than they used too."
6726121,prov1800,2023-03-23 16:02:00,5010,Iam guilty as well of buying a few useless lures.Couple of years ago I saw a suicide duck lure in a tackle shop and I remember seeing it on a commercial to and it looked great on the commercial and like whow there it is on the wall.It still hasn't caught a fish yet.
6717543,FinmanPoozie,2023-02-26 08:00:00,696,"Yup, i agree. Even if a swivel doesn't go through the eye, the knot keeps slamming against it, which can't be good for knot strength over a ton of casts.I got tired of my snaps getting in the rod tip eye on my musky stuff, so I started putting a big enough fluorescent plastic bead ahead of the swivel to prevent any damage to the rod eye. It lets me flow right into a figure 8 nicely & never jamming the eye.I started doing the same on my bass class rods also with those 3-4' fluoro leaders. Seems to help when I need to have a swivel in the middle. Bit lazy on my part: I keep at least 2 dozen fluoro leaders with the smallest swivels I can find so when 1 is shot, unsnap it & put on a replacement, knowing i really should be tying directly instead... I'm just starting to work on learning FG knots because they seem to be ideal for slipping through rod eyes. I also only use ball bearing swivels with welded rings because I've seen line damage from some split ring swivels.Happy fishing!!"
6719885,wdkott,2023-03-04 12:44:00,26,"Larry, I do a lot of inshore salt water fishing here in SW Florida. Before moving to Florida I always just used mono line and changed it out every year for my trips to Canada. After joining a fishing club here in Florida I tried out braided line with a mono or flouro leader and will never go back to straight mono. What I like about braid ( I use power pro 10 lb test) is: 1. Casts much farther due to smaller diameter 2. No stretch, better feel of those jigs and soft bites 3. Don't have to change it out annually because of no memory from the spool and deterioration from the sun and elements For a leader, I use 24 20 lb. Trilene XL mono. Have also used Vanish and Seagar flouro but trilene works just as well and is cheaper. XL is also easy to tie knots with. Independent testing on braid to mono leader knots by the fishing club using one of those expensive breaking strength machines found the FG knot to be the strongest. That said, I have trouble tying that knot. I usually use a Surgeons knot as it is fast and simple and works well for me. Hope this helps, and good luck at Okanse and Una lakes this summer."
6720041,Lmbkiller,2023-03-04 20:44:00,639,"Tying an Fg is like, really really easy. ****loads of how toos on the interwebs"
6720565,reelpro1,2023-03-06 13:21:00,20,Suffix Castable Flourocarbon - 8 lb Stuff is strong and manageable on spinning gear - I usually add 10-15 feet to braid - so lots of room to retie when needed - pike or rocks etc.
6722973,Franco,2023-03-13 20:08:00,107,"Seaguar Gold is very good but very expensive for what it is. I do like it - it’s very thin and has good knot strength, but keep in mind that it is probably over-rates slightly in terms of its published lb test strength, which is annoying and a little unethical. They market the line as thinner than most, but some of that “thinness” comes from slightly over-rating the line lb test figures (so a 10 lb is really about a 9 lb). Still, as far as the “best” leader, I have to give it to Seaguar Gold. Honestly though, you probably get 98% of the utility for a fraction of the price by using Invizix as a leader, especially if you’re jigging or trolling."
6723025,last chance,2023-03-14 06:44:00,3262,I have been using seaguar premier leader for many years fishing Erie and can't say enough great things about it. when tieing it to braid I used the blood knot and had no problems but a few yrs ago i switched to the double uni and i can't explain why. either knot works great. the one thing to remember when tieing to the braid and always add a few extra twists to the braid to prevent it from slipping and coming loose.
6723041,Moosebunk,2023-03-14 07:06:00,211,"Just been running Seagar Invisx or Abraxis mainline floro for leads for all things like lakers, char, Quinte walleye, specks, etc. Otherwise, for super tough and abrasion resistance Drennan is awesome. You'll get alot of leader material out of those spools of Seagar though. And I always have enough of a length tied on that the knot is just on the spool with every cast. Important IMO so that when the rod loads every cast, there is no pressure on the knot to weaken it over time."
6723073,clawman,2023-03-14 08:32:00,2078,"Agreed, NO swivel! In fact before I used a swivel I'd tie direct to braid and use a marker to camouflage it. Evolution of knots for me has been uni to improved Albright, to FG. FG is by far the smoothest but if you don't really cinch in down so it imbeds into the nylon line it will fail. I carry two 4"" pieces of 1/2"" sprinkler line to wrap the lines around the pipes as handles and pull until the knot changes color."
6723223,UKBDM,2023-03-14 12:54:00,178,I watched the video 2X and I think he is speaking specifically to what line works best for jigging raps. I don't think he believes that for jig/minnow or jig/grub fishing. Maybe I'm wrong or maybe everyone already knows that and I'm just late to the party.

6717273,JDsdogs,2023-02-25 07:38:00,165,"Years ago, I had problems with fluorocarbon. I think the manufacturing of that type of line improved over the years. I'm guessing 20 some years ago, I bought a couple fo different brands of floro that were brittle right out of the box. One being a high end fly fishing floro Tippett. On both occasions grabbed the line and gave it a tug and it just snapped. Since then, I won't buy Floro leader unless I tug test it first. One time a store employee asked what the heck I was doing, I showed him and the 10 lb floro leader snapped like a piece of dried spaghetti. It was a popular fishing store, so I am pretty sure the line wasn't sitting of the shelf to 5 years. Admittedly, I have not run into this issue for many years, but I still test before I buy. Learned the double uni when I first started to attach Floro leader to Braid or fly line, still use tat knot today."
6717283,prov1800,2023-02-25 07:58:00,5010,I tend to use around 4 ft of floura for my leader lines.I do like swivels but with that length of leader I would have to make sure I don't bring the swivel into my rod guides.So I stick with the uni knot.Braid doesn't twist as bad as mono as I jig a lot.
6717399,SJC305,2023-02-25 16:23:00,154,"I understand being hesitant on rod guides. If anyone is concerned about swivels and their end guide, look at SPRO power swivels size 10 or 8. I can personally say the size 8 will go through the rod tip guide on my Avid 6’3” MLXF. Just the slight brushing on the way through. (like line would) I typically use only a 4’ leader to avoid the issue, but have used a 6’ on occasion without damaging anything."
6717409,Lmbkiller,2023-02-25 17:19:00,639,"No reason to use swivel unless you're using some lure that can create line twist. Otherwise a knot union is the way to go. I don't care what size or brand swivel goes thru rod eyelets, u are doin damage to eyelets little by little"

6716947,last chance,2023-02-24 05:47:00,3262,I fish in Erie's central basin now but have fished a lot of inland lakes also. I have used seaguar and have tried other brands including vanish but end up going back to seaguar. On one trip on Erie we were using vanish 15# for our leader but after having 3 large fish in the 10# range break our leader when we went in I bought some seaguar premier leader and have been using it now for about 10 or 12 years with absolutely no problems or complaints. one other great thing about the premier is the diameter is small for weight ratio. I believe the 20# is only the diameter of 15# of other brands. it is the absolute best fluro I have ever used and I've been using fluro for so many of my 71 years that I lost count. I do believe if you try the premier you won't even want or need to try another fluro leader. but as always this is just an opinion.
6716957,adempsey2.0,2023-02-24 06:21:00,611,"For this specific situation (10lb braid to 8 to 20lb fluoro) I go with double uni, Alberto or Albright depending on what I am capable of at the time (wind, eyes etc..)."
