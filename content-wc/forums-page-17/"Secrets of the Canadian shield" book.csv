6724689,Pink Unicorn,2023-03-18 12:27:00,83,"Hey all- I'm wondering if anyone on here would happen to have a copy of ""secrets of the Canadian shield: an anglers guide to Perreault lake"" that they would be willing to sell me?"
6724709,That Minnesota guy,2023-03-18 13:15:00,8293,I have a signed copy. I have no interest in selling it but would borrow it if you want to read it. Otherwise I think Mark still sells them.
6724735,kettyspanky,2023-03-18 14:31:00,271,"Pink Unicorn, I would also be interested in one. If you get any info on some, please message me the details. Thanks"
6724757,7 Mag,2023-03-18 15:55:00,1887,"Reach out to BorntoFish, he might be able to help you ."
6724883,Pink Unicorn,2023-03-19 09:06:00,83,"Minnesota- that is a very nice offer but I feel intimidated on borrowing your signed copy!I've had several conversations with ""born"" about walleye hunting. He said be doesn't have any copies and to see if anyone on here would part with one. I'll see if he can email me the book or something and let you you"
6725217,Hwy101,2023-03-20 13:02:00,18,"Mark doesn't come on this site often these days. When I bought a second copy for my son he had less than 10 books left, and that was a couple of years ago.Your best bet would be trying to borrow a copy."
6725315,BornToFish,2023-03-21 07:16:00,1224,"Greetings,I happened upon this thread and was honored to learn that there is still interest in my books! It's been a while since I have posted on Walleye Central. I believe this is my third post in the last two years or so. I do not have any copies of my books remaining to sell. For those interested in obtaining a copy, there is a chance that a few copies of the first edition of my book might remain at St. Croix Rod Company in Park Falls, WI. They requested copies of my book to sell in their retail store. I am aware of copies of my book turning up for sale from time to time on ebay and the like on the internet.I offer some background on my books and where it stands today.I served as a personal reference for Manotak Lodge on Perrault Lake. I kept a list of talking points that I used when chatting with future guests at the Lodge. One day, I realized that these talking points were basically outlines of chapters of a book. After retiring from Kimberly-Clark Corporation, I decided to take my talking points and fashion them into a book. Authoring the book was a delightful experience on cold winter days.I fronted all funds for the first and second edition of my book, and then recouped my expenditures by selling the books. I sold the books for $25.00 each. As I recall, my expenses for the first and second edition of my book was about $23.00 per book: printing, shipping books to me, copyright fees, shipping books to customers, federal and state taxes. As you can now see, making a profit was never a motivation for authoring and self-publishing books.My family assisted immensely in keeping costs to a minimum. For example, I did all of the copy-editing for the final manuscript. My wife converted my final manuscript into the electronic format used by the printer and designed the front/back covers. Our daughter did the original artwork.I authored a third edition of my book a few years ago. I ran the numbers at the time and estimated a profit of about $0.34 per book. My primary outlet for the book at that time was Walleye Central. The guy that I spoke to at Walleye Central said that I would need to pay them to advertise my book on Walleye Central. I wasn't interested in raising the price of my book to cover advertising expenses, so shelved the hard copy project.I looked into making the book available as an ebook. I would have needed to hire a company to convert my book into an electronic format that is presented on the internet. The only question these companies answered (over the internet, never by telephone) was their fee. Additionally, I was not comfortable with the marketing agreements that I was required to sign to make my ebook available with certain internet outlets.All in all, my book was a great experience. Authoring the books clarified many concepts and assorted thoughts in my mind. I made many great friends through my book, many of whom I stay in touch with to this very day. I have no regrets.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6725333,NM_Trout,2023-03-21 07:54:00,1094,"Sounds as though your book is a very nice legacy. Would you be willing to release it in pdf form? I'd bet many of us would be willing to pay you directly. It would place you at some financial risk, but since profit is not too much of a concern, maybe you would gain some satisfaction knowing that there are a bunch of us who would still enjoy reading it? I'd certainly venmo $25 for a copy :-)"
6725405,Eckohlt,2023-03-21 11:00:00,3685,I'm sure many years down the road Trout you can write your own book!
6725629,NM_Trout,2023-03-22 07:47:00,1094,"Nah... the cancel crowd would be after me worse than they are after JK Rowling, and I don't have the luxury of her financial resources ;-)"
