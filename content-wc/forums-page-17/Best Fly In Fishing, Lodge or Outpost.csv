6723933,bthomas3333,2023-03-16 11:16:00,465,I'd like to hear the same info. I've been trying for several years to get a group together to go up there to fish Arctic Circle. I always hear the same thing. (Why haven't I heard more about this place if it is so good? Is it difficult to fish GB unguided? How am I fishing?) I always answer hey it is GB so you know it is good and we will; figure it out. Guys that are willing to spend that kinda money don't seem to want to gamble on their trips. Anyways hoping Bunk responds. I found a trip report he did there but numbers and size weren't really covered. Same reason Marshland has been tough to fill. Guys want info and GREAT reports in that $ range. I dont mind gambling on great water and go from there. Brett
6723947,Eckohlt,2023-03-16 11:36:00,3685,"Brett,have you lost many days of fishing because of high winds??I imagine you fish a lot of big open water,Great bear is huge n not many islands,a week of really high winds could raise havoc on fishing time,am I right or wrong??"
6724041,bthomas3333,2023-03-16 14:15:00,465,"Eck - I've heard the same thing about GB but Plummer's manages to keep customers happy. I know they use bigger boats and motors. But yeah last year I seemed to hit the worst possible weather. Cree I lost a day to 50mph sustained gusts to 65mph. (MPH NOT KM PH!). Biggest freshwater waves I have see other than the Lake Michigan. Alaska rained everyday and we never got warmer than 50f. If that wasn't bad enough wind was 20+ all but two days. Even sleeted on us for 2 hrs in JULY! Didnt lose anytime since river system. My #@!$%s thawed out last week. Taltson had constant 15-25mph winds and also snowed on me at the end of August (flurries didnt stick) Winds made a lot of 2-3footers. Again thankfully we could slide into the river and fish. God's river end of Sept...well end of Sept it snows and it did. Again worst day we punted the lake when we got up to 3footers /snow and fished the river. Son asked how I could fish without gloves in that. I said ""skin is toughened up!"" Reality was I was freezing but casting was warmer than standing with hands in pockets. Plus I knew I had 8 months to warm up. We did have 2 days of 50 and sunny there so I do have that! I am very blessed so not complaining one bit, but the bad weather followed me around last year. If not for the rivers I would've lost at least 2 full days and 2 half days. I guess the relevant point here is if I had that weather on Great Bear, I would've lost a couple of days at LEAST. B-"
6724049,Eckohlt,2023-03-16 14:24:00,3685,"thanks,that's sums it up pretty good,you'd make a good weatherman!you go enough your bound to hit a jackpot on the weather!"
6724055,DeBo,2023-03-16 14:40:00,211,"All sorts of clues in his reports from there. Including daily totals. And if you read between the lines and look at the photos… max size potential is big enough to make anyone posting on this forum happy.The lodge shows up on google earth. Decent imagery from up that way. The atlas.gc.ca website has topographic information and LANDSAT imagery. It’s not as good as what you can get for ON, MB, and SK but you could create a pile of waypoints from those sources and drive right to them when you get there.I think that’s the only fly in trip I want to do. Unguided on great bear is the best trip around. Though I’d like to experience the Tree some day. For now I’ve got enough remote drive to places to check off the list. I’ll have a tough decision to make when I go on one of these trips in the future. Great Bear or South America. I think about returning to catch Golden Dorado all the time. Or many of the other incredible fish I haven’t caught there."
6724059,Eckohlt,2023-03-16 14:50:00,3685,Do you fly to remote places to fish in South America??floatplanes??
6724067,DeBo,2023-03-16 14:59:00,211,"I was in Argentina for work about 10 years ago. Had the option to go home for a week in the middle of a long tour or go fishing. Lucked out and was able to get a spot to fish the Uruguay River at Concordia. Known as La Zona. Fishing below the dam there. Was there for dead of winter. Caught about 20 a day averaging 12-15lbs. 40, 35, 32 were the biggest.If I did dorado again I’d combo La Zona with a trip to the Parana or learn to fly fish so I could go to the Ibera Marsh (only lodge I see online now is fly only). La Zona is awesome but a tailrace near a city is a tailrace near a city. Combine that fish clobbering with a more scenic adventure and best of both worlds.No idea yet what I’d do in the jungle. But I’d lean Payara/Wolf Fish over Peacocks. I don’t need much for sleeping. We are getting away from lodges and camping in the boat to go farther and see more cool stuff. I’ll be old and back in lodges soon enough &#x1f642;"
6724069,Eckohlt,2023-03-16 15:05:00,3685,Sounds like you could make some cool videos on those adventures!Bet you some awesome wildlife.
6724299,Moosebunk,2023-03-17 08:10:00,211,"There's a clouded history with Arctic Circle but I think it's covered in one of the two reports Brett. They were a competitor on the lake to Plummers for years, they never seemingly had the same success. It was closed up until the year Brenda and I first went in. Otherwise, for many many years it was rented privately by some rich oil tycoon who stayed there for weeks at a time with his own chef and a couple guides. The volume of people to experience the place in this day and age versus all of the other Plummers Lodges combined is only the slightest drop in the bucket by comparison. It's also not as much a money makers for Plummers under the old price, but they have raised the cost considerably in the last couple years. The fishing is a laker factory. It's like a nursery! There are tonnes and tonnes of smaller fish up to I'd say about 30 pounds. Finding those true giants (or fishing through all the smaller fish) is a bit of a fun challenge. Brenda and I on the first trip caught 285 lake trout, the biggest 47 pounds. By comparison that week at the main lodge, nobody came even close to those numbers however, some paying for the expensive fly-outs did get some bigger fish. On our second trip we caught 212. Risked some numbers for bigger fish, adjusting and exploring. That trip Brenda caught a 45, myself a 42. Both trips several 30+ pound fish were caught. Other groups (anglers) I have known that have gone there same time or different times, have done as well and some not nearly as well. That's fishing. Each season 50+ pound fish do get caught but it doesn't seem that water can pull off ""X-Files"" size fish like Trophy or maybe some other fly-out or main lodge spots. Potential is always there though and why I like it most, unguided! For personal reasons, one being the fact I fish 100+ days a year and guide myself, I like to catch my own fish by my own devices when it's permittable. Second to that, it's likely the nicest area to fish on Bear and, my wife loves it there and at Slave too."
6724341,bthomas3333,2023-03-17 09:58:00,465,PERFECT THANK YOU!!!! I could tell you enjoyed the trips from your reports but it wasn't really written to this kind of content. I welcome huge fish but I am very happy to find larger numbers. BTW...to me all fish are fun! I am usually unguided and only do guided when the lodge/water requires it. One final question was around how you were fishing? Trolling / Jigging / Casting? Brett
6724359,Moosebunk,2023-03-17 11:29:00,211,"Mostly trolling. We do some casting as well... and for about an hour did some jigging but water temps were too cold for that kind of set-up. Did get a nice butterfly jigging tho! Later summer, there is one past guide who goes up and jigs. Where I don't know? But he seems to be able to pull off the 50 pound class fish doing that. Jigging is always IMO a better method to specifically target fish that you want."
6724363,dhottle,2023-03-17 11:42:00,163,To add to your story the oil tycoon & his wife both had identical Lunds flown up Artic Lodge for their use. They almost always fished individually in their own boat. They would have the guides take the boats to where they wanted to fish early in the morning so when they flew in to their spots the boats would be there ready for them minus the long boat ride. I heard lots of stories about them when we were up at GB & at Plummers GS.
6724367,Eckohlt,2023-03-17 11:48:00,3685,"I'd like to take the tycoon n his wife to a rustic flyin outpost in Ont,see how they handle that."
6724373,prov1800,2023-03-17 12:25:00,5010,Everything might pass inspection till they get shown the outhouse.
6724377,prov1800,2023-03-17 12:29:00,5010,???.Why would water be to cold to jig.Ice out good for trolling or casting shallow trout but they don't all come shallow.We get plenty in the 60 ft depths yet.
6724713,Moosebunk,2023-03-18 13:33:00,211,"Yeah, you're right man! I'll take that back! For around home here in Ontario the same can be said for 30-60fow depths. The few times spent on Bear at that time of year, without hydrographics and it being so immensely big to explore, and so much shallower water cold or just hovering around those magical water temps at best (usually much colder on the main body) it's just seemingly more productive to keep moving. The vast majority of guides up there are trollers right through the season, the lake being so far north just doesn't seem to set-up as productive a jig bite. Surely it exists, and later summer I imagine there are some who have it more dialed in. Our 47 and 45, a 44 and 42, 40, two 39's and a 36 all came from less than 20 feet, two less than 10, and that was all a couple weeks after ice out. That ice out time on Bear the big fish are shallower it seems for us... Even the X-Files (probably the best big lake trout spot on the planet) the giants tend to roam the flats in quite shallow, pushing out only to about 50fow mid summer. Because it's miles of featureless sand flat, the 50-70 pounders just kinda roam around and so the trollers dig into bottom with Flatfish to get right after them. At Slave, when Plummers opens the first couple weeks the troll bite produces well for the fish are in gin clear shallows where temps are right. A short time after tho, they'll certainly set-up in 30-60fow on humps and structures and it's go time on the jig bite. Trust me man, would rather jig than troll if I could but just on Bear from what I was seeing on the graph and how the hundreds of hook-ups were coming from the troll, including all the big fish in shallow, there was in my mind little time to waste in paradise jigging under less favorable conditions for it."
6724271,Moosebunk,2023-03-17 07:42:00,211,"Best explanations can be found in both stories posted here fellas...https://bunksoutdoorangle.com/explor...arctic-circle/https://bunksoutdoorangle.com/fishin...-circle-lodge/ First story you'll see how I broke SAT imagery down to mark many possible spots to fish. Once I arrived there, some panned out, some didn't but I will say, many areas held fish and some so many fish that we got bored of it. Like, one day Brenda and I had a 68 lake trout day with four between 20 and 24 pounds. We left that spot behind tired of catching high teen and twenty pounders to try and find 30 to 50 pounders. No kidding. That trip being our first, unguided and the lodge only just re-opening to the public after decades of being rented privately or closed, my wife counted the lakers while we basically explored... Days were like this (can all be read/pictured in the link reports) 1 - 11, 2 - 56, 3 - 68, 4 -57, 5 - 18, 6 -52, 7 - 23. A couple hundred plus lakers while ""exploring"" unguided. The biggest was 47 pounds. Some others at the lodge did more poorly for numbers and size, they just didn't do their homework or they drank too much. Another pairing though, took some risks of their own and with us, and were rewarded big time! There is some stupid good pike fishing to be had there as well but my wife didn't want to bother. She says ""will I catch one bigger than my PB here?"" I said, not likely. She has two 48-inch pike under her belt and Bear is not Slave for pike fishing, they generally max out a little smaller due to the very short warm season. Second story we catch several hundred more fish but this time go back with a group of six. We had the place to ourselves. Biggest fish of the trip was 45 pounds. We discover that some hot spots from the season before were not as good this time around due primarily to warmer water temps. However, the fish just moved and once locating them it was game on. If you look at the area on SAT images and use what you know about lake trout behavior, you will do fine. Hazards in this section of Bear are few and far between. What I mean is, shoals aren't that much a concern but one or two. However, it is Great Bear and venturing outside of the islands onto the main body can be a risk. We risked this once on the first trip, leaving in perfect weather but, as you can read we came back in VERY big water to a point that I feared a little for life. Inside the islands so far every trip the water has remained managable to boat. Lakers can be caught within minutes from the lodge, but I did find the more adventurous we got, the better the fishing.

6724277,coldtuna,2023-03-17 07:52:00,25,Thank you. I really appreciate the additional first hand information. It looks amazing.
6722579,Mojo-NC,2023-03-12 10:54:00,1929,"Sorry to hear about your dad. i couldn't agree more about David and Gretchen - they're definitely great people. We started fishing Wenasaga in 2004 and we have probably been there at the same time and likely crossed paths. One year we had a group of 14 guys, but that's too big. We have since split apart and either gone on separate weeks or organized our trips separately. It's difficult enough to manage the logistics of 4-6 guys, especially when we have to fly to International Falls and go from there."
6722607,prov1800,2023-03-12 13:49:00,5010,Friend of mine lived on Wenesaga so went and fished with him a few times.Have another friend who has a cabin on other side of lake.It was very good fishing.We would watch the walleyes spawn in the falls by Wenesaga river that came up from Lac Suel.Amazing to see them.
6722625,Mojo-NC,2023-03-12 15:03:00,1929,"I'll bet it was very cool to see those big girls from Lac Seul spawning. If I'm not mistaken, they close off the Wenasaga River leading into Lac Seul for a while during the spawning period, right? We were only up there once when the walleyes were pre-spawn. The ice left the lake on Wednesday and we arrived on Saturday. We never fish below the falls leading out of the lake towards Lac Seul. You mentioned that you know some the residents on the lake who are not affiliated with the lodge. That's part of the problem with fishing that lake, especially during the first few weeks of the season. Not only did we have to compete with the other 9 cabins that are part of the lodge, we would also have to compete with some locals as well. It's not that big of a lake and there aren't a lot of spots (if any) to fish that everyone doesn't already know about. I generally prefer to stay away from other boats from the lodge that aren't part of my group. Not that I have anything against any of the other guests, it's part of the reason we go to Canada - to get away from the crowds and enjoy the peace and quiet."
6722627,prov1800,2023-03-12 15:19:00,5010,Yes it can get busy and it is not a big lake.It is a spawning area that does get closed all the way to Lac Seul.the wenesaga river closes another logging road and there many walleye there to closer to Lac Suel.amazing site.Cedar has 2 areas like that also.
6722661,Moosebunk,2023-03-12 21:03:00,211,"Plenty would think, including magazine publications that North America's Best Fly-In Fishing Lodge is likely Plummers Arctic Lodges. Impossible not to be impressed by everything one will see and do there in a week on Great Bear, Great Slave or the Tree River and, three (maybe even four) species of World Record class size fish to chase are found there. But ya gotta like lakers, arctic char or grayling and, spending the bucks! Otherwise in Ontario for lake trout, pike and walleye fishing, there's never really a need to fly into any lodge for the fishing, only just the escape and privacy of having some piece of water all to you and your group. There are plenty drive-to and boat in spots. But if had to choose a favorite fly-in trip for Ontario, it'd have to be the Sutton River."
6722979,LittleBait,2023-03-13 20:26:00,37,"Have better fishing than Plummers at GS, the real draw to GB is the Char trip to the Tree, been there. Tazin ahs easier and shorter boat rides for record lakers and Big pike, laMatre has both. For just pike Talston and Midnight sun can't be beat, been there (talston) also. Plenty of top notch walleye lakes accroos most of the north country"
6723045,Moosebunk,2023-03-14 07:16:00,211,"Guided a short summer at Great Slave with Plummers and it is certainly my favorite way to fish lakers and, the numbers were as good or better than much of our trips to Great Bear. However, Arctic Circle on Bear has stupid numbers of lakers to catch, suffering some size in the meantime. Enjoy both Bear and Slave for different reasons, wife prefers trolling, me jigging, and she usually gets her way. lol. Friend of mine suffered a lousy week of fishing on Tazin. Loved the place, loved the potential for big lakers but the big fish waters were exposed and winds killed it. Borger went up there too and never reported on it, that has to be bad. lol. At least with Slave and Arctic Circle on Bear there's always a chance to fish potential record waters even with the winds up. Worked with a guide that spoke highly of La Martre too for both lakers and pike, told me his only issue with continuing to work there was the main guide was a nutsack and spoiled things. He also worked Tazin too though, and would tell of it's awesome fish. Of all places he preferred Bear tho."
6723379,LittleBait,2023-03-14 19:44:00,37,"WE did a fly-out for grayling too at GB, just amazing!! My partner got a 20.25"" on a fly."
6723383,drlee,2023-03-14 19:51:00,409,"Lake St. Joe out of Sioux Lookout with Vern Hollet out of Slate Falls Camps. Fished 30+ lakes in Northern Ontario over 35 years, and St. Joe is the top lake by far. Too old for fly in's now, and have two lakes in the Ignace area that I fish with my own boat and I am happy as a clam. Will fish these two until they bury me in my back yard.Press Lake Camp and Austin's Wilderness Lodge (Pashkokogan)."
6723887,coldtuna,2023-03-16 08:43:00,25,"I would be interested to hear a little more about Artic Circle. The idea of being self guided on Bear sounds intriguing, and a great idea to propose to my son for a special adventure several years down the road. Are there plenty of sheltered places to fish on windy days? Do you have to run a long ways to get into the fish? You mention big numbers. Can you explain a bit more what you mean by that, and size? Is it all trolling there, or is there good options to jig? I much prefer to cast or jig if possible. Thanks for sharing this information."
6722479,Mojo-NC,2023-03-12 08:50:00,1929,"I did not mean to imply that the several 30"" walleyes we caught over the years were from a fly-in lake. We caught those fish outside of the Winnipeg River System in our search for better walleye fishing in Canada over the years. Lac Seul is probably your best bet for a reasonable chance of getting a 30"" walleye if that's you're end game. We haven't caught any walleyes over 26"" in the fly-in lake I mentioned (Jubilee). I just really like the accommodations and fishing there. It's so nice to be the only boats on the lake to enjoy the peace and quiet, with no competition for fishing locations, and good fishing once you find them. However, that statement probably applies to almost every fly-in lake in Canada. All but the last 4 pictures in 2021 were of guys in my group of 4 from one week in September of that year. I think we might have been the only group that fished the lake that year right after the Canada border opened. One of the other 4 pictures is the owner of the camp."
6722489,Eckohlt,2023-03-12 09:04:00,3685,"Thanks Mojo for update about the 30inchers,hope to see more pics of you holding up a beer!"
6722505,Mojo-NC,2023-03-12 09:11:00,1929,"I think the following applies to every Canada fly-in lake: If there is only one camp on the lake, there are only so many fish that can be kept by groups while fishing a lake over the course of a year. The cabins generally only accommodate 4-6 guys. If they stay within their legal limits, it's not a lot of fish. You can do the math. Some groups take their limits home with them at the end of the week, and others do not. My group does not keep any pike and we only keep enough walleyes to eat during the week. We also don't take any fish home with us, so subtract those fish from your total. I would like to think most guys fishing fly-in lakes in Canada are conscientious anglers and have respect for the resources. Some guys like to keep both walleyes and pike - as long as they stay within their legal limits the lake should be able to sustain itself."
6722517,Eckohlt,2023-03-12 09:21:00,3685,"Back in the days when I was a kid,6 walleyes n 6 northerns of any size,it was a mass slaughter of big fish,size restriction saved the day n lower limits."
6722525,prov1800,2023-03-12 09:36:00,5010,From what iam aware of is that most flyins are catch and release and eat what you want while your there.Good rules by outfitters.Flyouts are supposed to be most fun to fish and just get away from it all.Drive ins can be actually just as good even though the lakes are busy just not as remote.

I've gone to several lakes twice or even three times. One fishery that's the exception is Echoing I'm sure it's great all season, just have to fish deep for the lakers in the summer."
6721675,LittleBait,2023-03-09 11:00:00,37,"Have fished with Mike on a trip and exchanged info back and forth quit a while, solid as they come for unbiased knowledge!!"
6721687,wdkott,2023-03-09 11:25:00,26,Thanks for your reply. Checked the Wenasaga Outposts Website and had the following concerns which maybe you can talk about. 1. Not a catch and cons up me lake as people can take home limits. Hopefully Jubilee Lake has so many pike and walleye that this is sustainable. 2. Pictures show people keeping larger pike on stringers. Best practice these days is to release all pike > 27 inches and walleye > 18 inches back in the lake. 3. Lake accessible by ATV. Assume locals can fish the lake all year is this lake remote enough? Good luck this summer on your quest for a new best multi-Species lake. Let us know how you do.

6721517,RichA$1970,2023-03-09 05:45:00,1159,Maybe Walleye2242 & Larry S should do a canoe trip together deep in the bush as Mother Nature in Sunset Country is a great cure.
6721523,Eckohlt,2023-03-09 06:23:00,3685,"The guy in the front of the canoe can't keep an eye on the guy in the back,could take some wood in the back of the head,"
6721525,Larry S,2023-03-09 06:26:00,665,"I have never done a canoe trip. In Fact my father is buried in Forest Hill Cemetery in Madison, Wisconsin where Walleye2242 lives. I try to visit his grave every couple of years when I'm back in the Midwest. Also visit a close friend who stood up at my wedding and lives in Madison and my cousin who lives in Sturgeon Bay to fish with him in Green Bay. Larry S"

6720905,prov1800,2023-03-07 10:41:00,5010,Bring a canoe and a tent Eck.Ill drop you off somewhere where it will take you about a week to the pickup point.Ill make sure you will be going down stream.
6720909,Eckohlt,2023-03-07 10:52:00,3685,"I don't have a canoe or a tent,can I borrow your prov??is there a holiday inn along the route?"
6720925,prov1800,2023-03-07 11:25:00,5010,Got a kayak.

6721161,Old Timer,2023-03-08 06:20:00,255,"I'll second prov1800 on the tent and canoe. I'd add a 3hp to the gear list. I'm not sure I can recall any fly-in camp that rivaled my remote river trips for quality of fish, numbers and ease of catching. And all very affordable. Tip: The further back in the bush you get dropped off, the better the fishing. Places like the Bloodvein, Savant, Flindt and Allenwater systems."
6721227,Larry S,2023-03-08 08:15:00,665,"As stated Walleye2242. What's Your Problem! You post your Opinion. Then Prov1800 posts His. You then Jump on Him for His Opinion Stating "" You mad you were not mentioned? F Me!!!!Christ! You Not Me are the "" Babysitter"" Also Your Comment of "" You mad you were not mentioned"" show's How Personal you take this post . Grow up!!"
6721327,Mojo-NC,2023-03-08 11:45:00,1929,"I think just about everyone is going to have a slightly different description of the characteristics that make a lake ""best"". If I'm on a great fishing lake but have to compete with other boats to fish popular spots, it's not going to make the cut. If I'm on a great fishing lake but have to fish out of a camp boat all week that doesn't have a seat with a back on it and have to sit on a metal bench seat all day, it won't make the cut either. I think my ""best"" would have to be a combination of the lake, the fish species present, a good bite, the time of year, and how secluded it is, and how difficult it is to fish the lake in varying weather conditions. Our first year in Canada, we fished the Winnipeg River System and the camp had phenomenal accommodations. They brought us a carafe of coffee each morning, breakfast and dinner were served in a dining room, and we had a different shore lunch out on the lake every day. However, it was big water, the lake levels were extremely high (like this year), there was a lot of current to contend with all week, and we were fishing out of camp boats without electronics so we had to stay fairly close or we could have gotten lost. We caught a 43"" musky, a bunch of 19"" smallies, lots of small walleyes, and a bunch of pike but no big ones. The camp had almost everything, but we've never gone back there because we wanted to focus on catching nice walleyes. We've since found much better walleye lakes and have caught several 30"" walleyes, and large pike, many of which have been over 40"" each year, but the lakes have no smallies or muskies. This year we're fishing a new multi-species lake that we hope takes over as our newest ""best"" lake. Otherwise, the honor goes to our last couple of fly-in trips to Jubilee Lake."
6720367,Eckohlt,2023-03-06 05:23:00,3685,"I can't help you out due to your last request about bait,others I'm sure will give you some great tips,good luck."
6720417,Walleye2242,2023-03-06 07:45:00,263,Exactly!!!
6720457,RichA$1970,2023-03-06 08:55:00,1159,"It’s interesting as careers develop on how people turn a passion into a business which then brings in profit that is the reports as realistic as a regular Joe would expect if they went. When a lot of these professionals put out videos & reviews, I really never see a negative one on the resort or lake. I can only speculate they get free trips & do they give a fair review.I watch the shows as it’s great to see the scenery & fishing, but a lot of them you wonder how much $$$ did Rapala fund the trip, are there guide boats in the back ground and how many hours did it take to catch the 3 fish they show. Maybe it’s me, but I’ve had some bad parts of fishing trips that these money makers seem to never have."
6720459,adempsey2.0,2023-03-06 09:05:00,611,"Always enjoy reading about others experiences. Hurst and Echoing Lakes have always been of great interest to me. What year did you visit Hurst? Not sure I can suggest specific places to try, but I think it's important to consider the following to improve your chances of having overwhelming success: 1) Time of year - fish will be concentrated at certain times of year and is obviously critical for knowing where to locate fish 2) Distance from urban centers - not a huge fan of lakes that are easily accessible in the winter or from logging roads, but that isn't always important; just the possibility of increased pressure and maybe pollution 3) Lake size/structure/type - e.g., inflows, lake chains, easily identifiable breeding grounds - you want these key features present for your target species Also, one trip is never enough to fairly gauge a fishery. It may shine at the end of June and be average the rest of the season; or you may have bad weather, late ice out, forest fires etc.. Smallmouth and Musky are not found as far north So, if those are important targets you will be geographically limited."

Cool down and Quit taking it so personally. There Are Many Fishermen who have just as much Info as Mike and He would be the First One to Acknowledge It! Larry Schroeder"
6720833,prov1800,2023-03-07 08:46:00,5010,Thank you Larry.lol.
6720859,Walleye2242,2023-03-07 09:13:00,263,I was stating a fact as well. You his babysitter? I am aware of people that can make a list. I know Mike made a list awhile back so i was responding to the original post thinking it might help. Thats all. I didnt know people would get butt hurt that i didnt make a proper list of everybody on here qualified.
6720121,wdkott,2023-03-05 07:47:00,26,"Was reminiscing about all the fly in's I've done and which have been the best by fish species. So here is my list: Combined pike and walleye: Vaughn Lake. Been there in June (right after Vaughn opens in mid June) and August. First time there in late August our group caught dozens of hefty pike in a nice sized bay. Other two times in this lake the pike were not in this bay, but did catch a few decent ones while trolling. This lake has tons of walleyes, and live bait is not needed to catch them. Only problem our group had was the size, nothing over 21 inches. And I know they get some big walleyes out of Vaughn. Major downside of this lake, in my mind, is all the fishermen that come into it from Lac Seul. Was particularly bad on the June trip. I liked the fishing but not all the company, particularly one boat that came up 15 feet from our boat and started fishing. Very rude! I much prefer being in an outpost with the only cabin on the lake. Walleye: Hurst Lake ( we were fishing out of Felicia Lake which connects to Hurst). Where the Atwood River comes into Hurst Lake from Atwood Lake there is a huge shallow weed bed. Just downstream of the weed bed where it enters Hurst the walleyes are stacked like cordwood. You could actually see the walleyes in the shallow clear waster. Every day we went there and caught walleye after walleye on jigs and plastics. In 2-8 feet of water, even on bluebird sky days. Fish sizes were decent, averaging 17-18. But fishing the rest of the lake wasn't so good, although we didn't try the outlet and should have. Felsia was also decent fishing but more a trolling lake as the fish were scattered. Never found the pike on these lakes. Bonus was the beautiful beach within sight of the inlet for making our shore lunch, with nice driftwood logs to sit on. I still vividly remember my son sight fishing on the drift for walleyes, pulling his jig away from the smaller walleyes and putting it in front of the bigger fish. Pike/Lake Trout: Echoing Lake in September with the lakers on the spawning reefs. Lots of big pike as well as nice sized lake trout. Arms were tired after this trip. Caught two 35 and one 38 lakers all within 30 minutes at one reef. And epic day that made the trip for me. Also so many pike in the 30 + range, with group of 7 or 8 (two different trips) catching 20+ of the 40 or better size. Biggest pike caught was 47! Problem now is the camp doesn't seem to be operating any more Smallmouth Bass: Halfmoon Lake in May, pre spawn. Lots of smallies from 15-18, and aggressive! Top water fun as well. Went there last July and much tougher fishing. Still looking for new places to go without spending a fortune. Hoping to find lakes with a good balance of two species with size and remoteness, and not having to use any live bait. Any suggestions would be appreciated."
6720131,kettyspanky,2023-03-05 08:21:00,271,"Thanks for the report. I am just starting to do research on lakes in sunset country. I currently go to 1 lake in superior country. I am the same as you, looking for decently price places to go. My son and I are going to start doing 2 trips a year soon and I'm looking for new adventures without a hefty price tag."
6720155,Waba,2023-03-05 10:03:00,25,"I feel like Erringtons Wilderness Islands may be exactly what you are looking for. Great Walleye fishing, Nice pike as well! Beautiful Lodge and Cabins!"
6720199,Walleye2242,2023-03-05 12:02:00,263,Mike Borger had a nice list awhile back on his top fly in spots. He is very qualified to make lists.
6720265,prov1800,2023-03-05 17:23:00,5010,There's a lot of guys on here qualified to make lists.
6720275,Eckohlt,2023-03-05 17:44:00,3685,Some probably more qualified.
6720279,Eckohlt,2023-03-05 17:47:00,3685,"Lots n lots of honest guys,not salesmen."
6720297,Walleye2242,2023-03-05 18:32:00,263,Ok? I just know Mike made a list awhile back. Should I have made a list of names of people qualified to make lists? You mad you were not mentioned? F Me!!!! Christ!
6720303,prov1800,2023-03-05 18:58:00,5010,No need to get to excited over this.Just mentioned guys that are in this forum have a **** of a lot more to offer than some guy that's hardly ever on here.
6720333,Namegosikaa,2023-03-05 20:19:00,61,I've been following his career since the late 80s when he wrote pieces for magazines on places across ontario with no known knowledge like pukaskwa. It would be hard to find a guy with more experience than Mike Borger on fishing in Canada. With all of his paddle experience alone hes wetted lines in spots that we all could only dream of so he certainly commands a lot of respect. He's also very forth coming with honest information which is very generous of himconsidering he makes a living doing promos
