6723311,v-bay gord,2023-03-14 16:22:00,3168,..or look at it this way....why rent a cabin for 1/2 of what you need to stay in business?
6723321,RichA$1970,2023-03-14 16:32:00,1159,"At the end of the day, it’s supply vs demand or a bird in hand or 2 in the bush. Great thing is there are tons of choices & every owner has the right to their business model and especially based on their vacancies & capacity. If you are retired or flexible, more options as I prefer going on my own so I can chuck spoons & spinners for pike."
6723335,walleyecheek,2023-03-14 17:20:00,2231,Better to have 2 people in there for 2 weeks rather than 0 people in there for 2 weeks. Have to accommodate people ! Resort business is slowing down for 2023 !
6723343,That Minnesota guy,2023-03-14 17:31:00,8293,I'm with Gord. If he rents a 6 person cabin to 2 people and then gets a call for 6.......... Thats bad business and simple math no matter how you look at it. To all those who say a bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush I suggest you buy a lodge and apply your theory.
6723349,Eckohlt,2023-03-14 17:34:00,3685,6 plus 2 is eight.big money!
6723427,walleyecheek,2023-03-15 04:34:00,2231,"your right ! ""If"" is a big word !......LOL."
6723459,Golden Eagle,2023-03-15 07:25:00,2642,Gotta respect those who sign the front of paychecks.
6723493,That Minnesota guy,2023-03-15 08:13:00,8293,"""If"" isn't as big as ""can't"" because he rented it to 2 guys."
6723543,Fisherman Ted,2023-03-15 09:14:00,461,"Welcome to arguably the single most complex thing I as a lodge owner do every season.As I am American plan I charge per person. Logical. Open bar isn't cheap. Or gas. And I have cabins from 1 bedrooms up to 4 bedrooms. So a single angler can come or a large group. But the fun begins when a smaller cabin isn't available for a small group. Say 2 guys come but I have a cabin that sleeps 4. A bird in the hand? Depends. Overhead is high. Season is short. There are like dozens of factors that I needs to consider before booking that cabin at half full. Like:How far out is the booking. Is it prime time or shoulder. How comfortable am I that it will sell out with the maximum amount of guests. Are these repeat guests. If they bail last minute will the deposit lessen the blow. Or can I still rent it out last minute (depends on time of season usually). Do they have a history of no shows. If I don't give them a larger cabin (as they just HAVE to have a private bedroom) will they not book. Or never come back.The goal from my standpoint is to maximize guest load in a season that is like 15 weeks long. If I screw it up I can never recover that lost revenue. The twist however is that if I alienate a guest they are one and done which will sink me. I want everyone to have a great time. So, for example right now I have a couple cancellations in June. Extremely late to be doing that and quite close to the open of the season. Do I take a single angler if he calls today, or hold out that a larger group will call. Longer I wait the higher the chances are it goes empty. But the difference between 1 guy and 4 is big money. Where do I draw the line and pull the trigger. Ironically June of 2024 is nearly sold out (which I am sure will cause other issues next year with repeat guests if I do not manage well). This isn't gouging. But business. If I were selling a car that could sit on the lot and still have value it would be so much easier than that cabin that loses everything once the date passes.-FT"
6723561,7 Mag,2023-03-15 10:20:00,1887,"My opinion like i mentioned earlier in this thread, housekeeping cabins can be a flat rate for the cabin, a not to exceed number of people or pay extra. A single fishermen could end up paying for a two or three bedroom if that's the only cabin available but that's their decision. By doing it this way the overhead costs are taken care of no matter how many people book the cabin."
6723123,Ohio fisherman,2023-03-14 10:47:00,988,"This topic is a curiosity to me because I have encountered different pricing methods. This year we encountered a pricing scenario that is new to us. We have been going on fishing trips since 1979 in many parts of Canada and the US.Yes, I understand that the outfitter needs to make a profit, it is their property, they work hard, they have a big investment at risk, opportunity costs, and all the other business principles. What have you experienced? What are your opinions.For clarification, this is for the housekeeping plan with no meals provided.Pricing Scenario #1:They charge $XXX for the cabin per week no matter the number of guests.Pricing Scenario #2:They charge $XXX per occupant no matter how few or many guests.Pricing Scenario #3:They charge per person at the rated minimum cabin occupancy rate. If there are more guests than the minimum, they charge per guest. This varies depending upon the number of beds in each cabin. For example, cabin A is rated at 2-4 guests and they charge for a minimum of 2. Cabin B is rated for 3-5 guests and they charge for a minimum of 3. Cabin C is rated for 4-8 guests and they charge for a minimum of 4 guests. They have four of each size cabin. Nowhere in the rate information do they explain this pricing system.In our specific situation it is just wifey and I, so two guests. We are considering an outfitter who we learned uses scenario #3. We want to book for two consecutive weeks. For the chosen weeks, they have available only a cabin rated for 4-8 guests. So they quoted a rate based upon 4 guests each week. The rate was a surprise. Nowhere in the rate information do they explain this pricing system. This causes me to think that we are being gouged. I told them that we would think about it and get back to them in a few days.What are your opinions about this specific situation?"
6723141,Eckohlt,2023-03-14 11:08:00,3685,"if it was just me and my wife I would keep searching,there are countless of other places to go,just my thoughts."
6723145,7 Mag,2023-03-14 11:11:00,1887,"Most US resorts charge a flat rate for the cabin with a max amount of people and not per person, I prefer this especially for a single fishermen. I'm not sure why Canadian camps want to charge per person especially for a housekeeping cabin, American plan i get it."
6723153,stjoeguy,2023-03-14 11:34:00,979,"A rate per person with a minimum number of people in a cabin is what I expect in Canada. I don't think you're being gouged. It sounds exactly like you presented it in scenario #3, cabin C. If that's not acceptable, follow Eckohlt's advice and look elsewhere. Hope you find something and enjoy the trip!"
6723163,RichA$1970,2023-03-14 11:53:00,1159,"I’d look elsewhere as they only have an opening for a 4 person cabin and you only have 2 so I would pay for 2 empty beds, let the outfitter fill them. I rent a boat n motor and like outfitters who also list a package deal on their websites that includes gas. Plenty of choices so I’d keep looking."
6723197,adempsey2.0,2023-03-14 12:30:00,611,"Well, I understand why they want to price it like that. It is potentially lost income for them. If it were me, I would just suggest you are only willing to pay the two person rate. It will be up to the outfitter if they want to take the chance of possibly having 0 guests or 4-8 guests, or a guarantee of 2 guests. If they say no, I would go elsewhere unless I don't mind paying the extra or have no other options. Both of which I have done in the past for various reasons. I also don't think you are purposely being gouged. It is just about the bottom line for them."
6723221,Old Timer,2023-03-14 12:53:00,255,"Scenario #3 is pretty standard. IMO you're NOT being gouged. By the way, many camps have a day minimum too. Many years ago Scenario #1 was used by some Canadian housekeeping camps. . But I haven't seen it for at least 35-40 years. Good advice by previous posters."
6723257,proguidedream,2023-03-14 13:44:00,345,"scenario 3 and 1 is pretty much the same thing.... they are just explaining it to you in a more confusing way.. your paying for a minimum 4 person cabin.. that has the possibilty to hold 8. why charge for only 2 people , when next week they could possibly rent it for the 4 people. most places rates are based on minimum occupancy, not the max. some call them small-medium-large. some are named after fish, aka the perch cabin, the walleye cabin, the musky cabin. bigger they are the more they cost.. doesnt matter how many people."
6723275,Walleye2242,2023-03-14 14:33:00,263,"I have problems as I am usually a lone guy and most places do not like lone guys unless they have an empty week or late in the season and i am aware of this and make it work. However, some places want to charge double if your a lone guy. Now my mom and I stayed at five lakes on gullrock in late sept. My mom comes up for the scenery and a boat ride. She spends most time on front porch looking at scenery. So what Ian did was charge me for cabin and boat and charged my mom per night like she was at a hotel. charged her like 50.00 a night i think? Whatever it was she was a **** of a dude for doing it and was not asked to do this. He saw my mom was 80 and just spent time playing with his dogs on the front porch with a boat ride here and there."
6723291,walleyecheek,2023-03-14 15:32:00,2231,Look at it this way ! Why pay for 2 extra people that aren't there ?
