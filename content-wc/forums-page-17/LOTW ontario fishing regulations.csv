6722649,MN Brandon,2023-03-12 19:42:00,14,Does anyone know if the new walleye regulations on lotw passed? I talked to a couple different Canadians while out fishing and they thought it had…. I can’t seem to find anything stating that. Thanks!
6722711,LOWrider,2023-03-13 08:03:00,40,"The 2023 regulations still show one over 46 cm for LOTW. Don't know if this is the kind of thing that could change in the middle of a year, but kind of doubt it."
6722787,mjames,2023-03-13 10:56:00,18,I believe there is a daily catch limit of 2 instead of the usual 4 for Canadian residents on LOTW. Possession limit of 4.

6724845,Obabikon,2023-03-19 06:51:00,2370,There have been zero changes to the LOTW's fishing regulations.
6725171,MN_Moose,2023-03-20 09:23:00,964,I was told the same thing from a camp owner on the opposite side of LOTW. (North end)
6725173,mjames,2023-03-20 09:29:00,18,Yes my bad no changes as stated by others.
6726311,MN Brandon,2023-03-24 08:02:00,14,"I just received an email back from the Ontario MNRF. According to them the size based regulation (slot) changes will go into effect on Jan 1, 2024. It is a bit more of a process to change the catch/possession limits so that may take up to another year and most likely go into effect Jan 1, 2025. It was stated that Fisheries/Oceans Canada needs to approve this portion."
