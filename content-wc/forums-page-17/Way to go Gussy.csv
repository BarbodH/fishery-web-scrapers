6727053,Camoclad,2023-03-27 10:06:00,628,Definitely fished a good tournament. He didn't look rattled yesterday when he still only had 1 fish at 11:30 but he stayed with his plan and made it happen. I was rooting for him!
6727079,Cutting Edge Official,2023-03-27 11:20:00,242,First Canadian...second international angler to win the Classic...awesome job Gussy!
6727123,proguidedream,2023-03-27 13:18:00,345,"great job, most guys here probably dont care about the bass classic, but the way gussy uses ""walleye"" technique to dominate these guys on some lakes, sure is not something to overlook. winning the biggest tourney in bass with what is basically a ""jig n a minnow"""
6727245,Camoclad,2023-03-28 04:29:00,628,"Not to mention he fishes a Lund and most of the other guys are in their rangers, phoenixes, skeeters, etc. He definitely had the right game plan (and has the last two tournaments on the TN River). Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
