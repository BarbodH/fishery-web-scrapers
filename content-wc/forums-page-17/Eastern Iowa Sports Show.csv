6723255,nitroman,2023-03-14 13:43:00,368,It was nice talking to those of you that made it to the show. Hope you all have a good year on the water!
6723479,Bill Krejca,2023-03-15 07:54:00,6107,"Had a nice chat with Scott and John at the Cedar Point Resort booth on Saturday. The show was pretty busy, the only one I go to any more. We shared the most secret of fishing spots, known only to those willing to take a blood oath to never divulge to others. Wrists will hopefully heal soon from the cuts! Bill"
