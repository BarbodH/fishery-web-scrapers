I also see he has taken his website down.We used to stay at Casa Blanca years ago, but have been staying at Lunge Lodge the last 12 yrs. Check them out, great rates. www.lungelodge.ning.com"

6416658,tiltedtoque,2020-03-29 09:15:00,7,"Hey guys,I just want to chime in here and introduce myself. I purchased Casablanca Lodge on the Upper French River in the spring of 2018. The camp was extremely run down and nonoperational. Since then, we have cleaned up the property and have updated many of the cabins (still in progress). We are rebranded and operating as The Tilted Toque. If you know where the camp is (directly above Chaudiere Dam), you'll know how incredible the fishing is around our property. If you'd like to chat or have any questions, don't hesitate to get in touch. Cheers,Terry"
