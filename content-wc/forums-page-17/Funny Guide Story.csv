6726661,GeoFish,2023-03-25 14:08:00,70,"A couple time during the trip. I helped my customer since the guide was too busy pretending he was Rolland Martin.I should have been more aggressive, but I try not to start conflicts. My point is a guides job is to be sure his customers have fun and catch fish."
6726663,Juls,2023-03-25 14:13:00,13414,That's correct. He was a bad guide then.
6726667,GeoFish,2023-03-25 14:31:00,70,I have some great experiences with guides. I try and hire a guide whenever i fish a new lake. Most of these trips involved my wife and most of the guides were very accommodating. This was just a bad deal.
6726803,biotroller,2023-03-26 09:38:00,437,"I hired a sturgeon guide years ago, my son & I had never fished them before. The first fish hit, he picked up the rod, set the hook & tried handing it to my son, my son wouldn't take the rod, I am the same way. The guide was dumbfounded, he got to catch a fish on a trip he was guiding on. He was so concerned about getting a fish in the boat, he didnt want us to mess up the hookset. We were there to have fun & learn from him, catching would be a bonus. Ive hired the guide a couple times now & he is awesome!"
6724447,krazyk711,2023-03-17 16:10:00,26,But why fish to begin with unless you're splitting the bill ?? If you can catch those easy fish whats the problem with getting the guests dailed in ? I was in the boat with a guy picking up singles suspended over 30 feet of water..did I mention that he is no longer associated with that resort..hmmmmm !
6724479,Tristian5431,2023-03-17 18:19:00,37,Do you guys ever tip the lodge? Is that standard practice?
6724483,Spurgery,2023-03-17 18:22:00,79,We always tip the dock hands/camp workers not the lodge itself.
6724601,prov1800,2023-03-18 08:25:00,5010,Sometimes a guide has to fish just to show his guests there's fish there.Many times I stop fishing and then no more fish get caught yet where all doing the same thing and sonar shows fish.Sometimes people get lucky and a fish will bite on a non moving jig.But mostly it has to wiggled just right.Whike your guide was picking of a few single fish were you getting any.???.Sometimes they won't take a jig so iam always throwing a different lure down to see if they'll take that.Either lindy rig or bottom bouncer and if so I'll change out there presentation or pull a couple rods out of my locker.Might even try a troll run.
6724619,Waba,2023-03-18 08:52:00,25,"I'll jig with my clients until I have the fish figured out, same with chucking cranks."
6725435,Hwy101,2023-03-21 12:37:00,18,"We used a guide for a day on our annual trip two years ago. I had gotten to know him from talking at the dock but had never fished with him. At breakfast we heard the camp owner giving him the chore list for the day which was surprising because he was generally booked solid. I jokingly asked him if he wanted to fish or mow the lawn and he had his gear in the boat in about two minutes. Up to this point we had been hammering the walleye all week so this was really just for fun and a change of pace. I even offered to drive the boat which was politely declined. At lunch we could tell he was still holding back a bit and doing more guiding than fishing, although we did break him from the habit of asking if we wanted the fish netted. After lunch we told him lets just fish. No customers, no lodge employee just three guys in a boat where the guy catching the fish can dish it out any way they want. To say we got crushed is an understatement. I don't think i have ever been that out fished by anyone at any point in my life. The guide fished with a 5"" 6"" ultra light and unpainted jigs. His strategy and presentations were based on baitfish activity not the walleyes. His knowledge and understanding of the whole ecosystem in the lake was an eye opener. That was the key to his success. It turned out to be one of the better fishing investments I have made."
6725441,Tristian5431,2023-03-21 13:13:00,37,"Awesome story! I consider myself a beginner at best. I fished for smallmouth as a kid on Lake Champlain in Vermont. I fished up until about 15 or 16 when girls became more important than hanging with my uncle. I picked back up in my mid 20s, fishing here and there when I could do guide trips or beating the banks in NJ (which isn't that great). I've never owned a boat and probably fish 10 - 20 days a year. Saying all of that, I think will always use a guide for at least one day on a trip. I feel like their knowledge is invaluable and they are worth their weight in gold. Besides the 1 bad egg, I have had great experiences with guides. On my first of two trips last summer to Ontario, I was struggling to figure out/find the bigger post spawn smallmouth. I opted for a day trip on Lec Suel with a guide who literally saved my Canada trip. Same trip as the guide I previously talked about who caught the 5lber in front of me lol hahahhahha on top water!"
6726639,GeoFish,2023-03-25 12:57:00,70,"I did not read all the posts. But as a general rule I do not think the guide should fish. I have seen situations where the guide set up on a reef to jig fish do three could fish in the boat. My wife and I were 75 yards away fishing lindy rigs in 20 feet away and slaying them. They caught very few fish in 10 foot of water.Another trip I took 12 customers including myself to a lodge. We all had guides, three guys per boat. My guide fished and he thought it was a competition. My customer was a new to fishing and could have used some help. The guide and I caught alot of fish. My customer did not catch a single fish. I should have stuck a boot up that so called guides backside."

6726657,Juls,2023-03-25 13:59:00,13414,"At what point, did you tell the guide that you wanted him to help your customer/friend instead of fishing? Are you saying he refused that request?"
6724139,Spurgery,2023-03-16 19:53:00,79,"I haven’t fished with a guide very often because we go to the same couple lakes year in and out. However, I could see why one would want one for new water. The few times I was with a guide they did fish but not non-stop and they were focused on us as the guest first. I could see myself getting annoyed if a guide was more focused on fishing himself than actually guiding. As for that 53” Muskie Prov 1800 caught, heck I would just be thrilled to be in the boat and have the experience. Like my dad always said “fishing isn’t about catching”."

6723573,maddogg,2023-03-15 10:48:00,178,When my wife and I were in Costa Rica we had a guide to fish the tributaries. We caught a bunch of mojarra. I asked the guide if they were any good to eat he said: ''White man no like I take home for wife.''A little time later we were throwing a small blue rapala under the trees that hung over the river and my wife had a gar take a swipe at it. He said ''gar no bite on lures.'' My wife caught it about 4 casts later. He said wife no eat.OK
6724131,krazyk711,2023-03-16 19:29:00,26,"Kind of like when we hired a guide to target fall smallies on LOTW. Before we even started fishing he already had 2 in the boat. When I asked what are you using he showed me a smelt colored soft plastic and then told me if he had more he would give me one ?!? Got better throughout the day with ""the guide"" out catching us 3 to 1 .He even got a 7 lb eye. Not once did he ask if we minded that he fished just assumed (?) that it was fine, it was like he was in his own little one man tournament, pathetic !! . After dinner the lodge owner asked how the day went to which I responded the guide had a blast and filled him in. Needless to say the day was comped along with several adult beverages. I just don't understand why some guides think it is OK to fish when the customer is paying the bill. April Vokey ""fly fishing goddess and guide"" once stated ""guides don't fish, even if the customer says it's ok, guides are there to show the person a great day even if the fishing is bad."" Food for thought !!!"
6724137,prov1800,2023-03-16 19:44:00,5010,Never have had any requests not to fish for the easy to get fish by any guests.Usually I just stop fishing after catching a bunch especially if there's a shorelunch involved.Iam going to get enough in the boat for that.Then i stop.Theres times when guests don't get a lot of fish themselves and it ain't because it's slowed down.I always have plenty of tackle for everyone in the boat and if i had the last one and its working id give to someone.Muskie fishing is much different.i have 5 lures with me.

6722257,Mojo-NC,2023-03-11 10:00:00,1929,"Ha, the last time we used a guide in Canada, he fished a little but not too much. We kept him pretty busy putting the three of us on fish. However, one day I was stupid enough to bet our guide who would catch the most smallmouth bass between the two of us - our guide was fishing a tube bait and I was fishing a Carolina-rigged Senko. He put the smackdown on me that day, but while doing it he was also putting on a clinic on how to successfully fish a tube bait. I used his technique many years later while fishing Lake St Clair and caught several nice smallies including one that was over 5#. I don't think I would be satisfied using a guide if I didn't learn something from him/her during the trip. I would say that more often than not, in my experience the guide is more of a charter captain than a fishing guide, but it really depends on the style of fishing. When trolling, the guide is too busy driving the boat and directing us how to properly put out the lines, and then netting our fish. If we're doing a drift and jigging, the guide will usually fish along with us. My last 30"" walleye was caught while jigging during a drift."

6721935,Tristian5431,2023-03-10 09:16:00,37,"June 22' I did a day trip on Lec Suel with a guide from Winoga Lodge. He was great! He put me on topwater smallmouth right away. I'd say they were in the 2-4lb range. So we are fishing for a few maybe two hours. I am using a bone color pop - R. He was using a tiny torpedo. I didn't have a tiny torpedo and didn't know that they can be a hot bait for smallmouth. At one point I sit down to re tie my pop r and am fumbling around with my go pro or something and the guide catches a HUGE 5 lb smallmouth on top water LOLOL! He felt terrible about catching her! I laughed about it. I thought it was hilarious. I know that some folks don't fish with guides. Are you upset if they catch a big one in front of you? Do you want guides to fish with you or sit back and watch you fish? For me, I think its weird to have a guide just sit there and have me fish alone. I'd rather us fish together. On different trip last summer. I fished with a guide at Hawk Lake Lodge (which is awesome btw, I think that will be a experience to beat). I can't remember his name, but he was AWESOME. We did a day trip fishing smallmouth with the flyrod. We both had a blast. Before that day I had not previously fly fished before so he pretty much gave me my intro to fly fishing and helped me have a successful day on the water. Win Win! So for those who use guides. Have you ever had one catch a big one in front of you? Did you get upset about it? Do you prefer that they fish with you or sit down and watch and instruct?"

6721975,stjoeguy,2023-03-10 11:10:00,979,"I've fished with three guides on open water. Prov1800 was one of them. He was the best guide ever on Lac Seul (actually the only guide, but hey, still the best). I was in the follow boat so I can't tell you what he caught. He had a different technique for jigging that worked for us that day, but to be honest, John, I haven't used it since then. Old habits are hard to break. It was our first time on Lac Seul, so it was great having him show us multiple spots and some safe tracks around the lake. A guide on Leech Lake chauffeured us around the lake for an afternoon without anybody catching anything, including the guide. In his defense it was a sunny, 95 degree day, with not a breath of breeze or waves on the lake. He got an A for effort, however. On my own Lake, in an attempt to have my son-in-law and grandson get a walleye, I hired a guide in July. When he picked us up at the dock he asked what we were after. I told him walleye. His response was Do you want to search for walleye or catch bass? We'll catch bass. So we did. His next question was None of you are a preacher, are you? He then put in a Larry the Cable Guy tape. We had a lot of fun and caught bass. Most of my ice fishing trips are with guides now and they usually catch more fish than I do. I'm fine with guides fishing because I know they're looking for fish. If they're not getting fish, chances are I won't either, and we'll move to a better spot."

Second time when I asked him not to make the first cast in each hole, he did not seem to care. So we were shoulder to shoulder all morning. What a richard. I didnt tip and I didnt recommend or re-book back him. Both of these were LM bass guides in Texas so that's a little different than your situation / walleye or crappie fishing. I actually went with a crappie guide yesterday in East Texas. He was too busy manning the livescope and controlling the boat to fish. That was my first witness to someone that has put 1000s of hours into livescope. He was precise and deadly. Even calling shots which crappie were male and female. We targeted some blue catfish and flatheads. Wow truly amazing how that machine can see fish underwater. I'll will still continue to book guides and I'm grateful for all the good ones that I have used! But the couple bad experiences wont be forgotten."

6722217,Fisherman Ted,2023-03-11 07:53:00,461,"My guides are not allowed to fish when guiding. No way. They are there to put you on fish, teach you, have an engaging conversation and make sure your day is a blast. The only time they can pick up a rod is when the bite is slow and they are throwing different baits to see where the bite is. Or when my guides are teaching people how to fly-fish which we do a lot of (and its a blast, like Tristian said) But that's it. That being said I know some guests REALLY want the guide to fish with them and if that's what the customer wants no problem. But in general, if I hear you were fishing all day with the client you are on my **** list. -FT"
