6726855,Pooch,2023-03-26 17:34:00,4618,Are preserved baits like this allowed over the border? Poochhttps://www.amazon.com/Magic-Product...023UCZ9Y&psc=1
6726883,Walleye2242,2023-03-26 19:06:00,263,I do not know but i have taken them the past 2 years. Used them at times....did ok but not as good as the real deal. I found the bite with the preserved minnows was very quick? Almost like they grabbed but spit it back out right quick? Either that or at my age my reflexes suck and not setting the hook fast enough these days...so could be user error.
6726911,dschiebel,2023-03-26 23:23:00,85,Well they yelled at me and made me bring them back to Minnesota.
6726915,Pooch,2023-03-27 01:39:00,4618,That was my first thought... Pooch
6726955,Huntindave,2023-03-27 06:07:00,2194,"I can't answer your question but I'd personally recommend ""Gulp"" minnows as a viable option that works well. https://www.berkley-fishing.com/gulp-minnow-1285380"
6726963,eyecatcher1,2023-03-27 06:39:00,323,When I crossed in International Falls last August they asked me if I had any live bait or bait that used to be alive.
6726975,Pooch,2023-03-27 07:23:00,4618,"Me too, same question and we had none. Trolling (and jigging) plastics have been my go-to bait for the past several years, but the group still buy crawlers ordered ahead and sometimes Leeches if available. Seldom use any minnows anymore. If we cannot bring salted minnows over, I don't see ""store bought"" preserved bait making the cut either. Plus, they are as expensive as live minnows. Elway might be checking. Pooch"
6727015,adempsey2.0,2023-03-27 08:56:00,611,"For Ontario, I think it's more about the new Bait Management Zones and not the border itself. Not sure about other provinces.https://www.ontario.ca/document/onta...s-summary/bait ""Baitfish or leeches, whether live or dead, may not be transported into or out of a BMZ.."""
6727117,CI_Guy,2023-03-27 13:02:00,2118,"Crossing into Ontario and Manitoba we've been asked the live or ever been alive bait question, so it seems to be Canada not the provinces that is banning the bait."
6727137,jambi,2023-03-27 14:04:00,504,"I know they aren't allowed but they do work. Easy to transport, store, and handle in the boat. Sucks they can't cross. Now its back to nasty frozen shiners. I cut in thirds ...to make them last a little longer...and more messy too."
