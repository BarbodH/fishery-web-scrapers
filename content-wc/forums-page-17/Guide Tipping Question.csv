6722271,reelpro1,2023-03-11 10:32:00,20,"Not sure about most Guides , but tips are appreciated not expected. Agree with what someone said,  they are earned like respect Tips are up to the client, tip what you feel is right - hopefully your guide made sure you had an amazing day on the water. Everyone's wallet is a different size, some clients have tipped me $10 and I know they could have used $10, others have tipped a few hundred and for them it was like a few cents to most of us."

THE STRIP CLUBS!! so imagine the tipping there?? after 5 days of this you can imagine the 3 hotels rooms, everybody ponied up at checkout with the waded up cash from the trip, we hunted down our girl that cleaned and baby set or rooms, she got little over 600.00 for the week and earned every penny of it all tipping is different !!! and no I didn't go to the clubs everynight"

He was helpful, informative, personable, willing to teach everything and anything. So he got a big tip. The guy a few years ago that put me on a 52"" Northern (and several in the high 40's) over a few days? Nothing - uncommunicative, admitted he didn't know where to go, just followed the other guides. Insisted my wife was nuts using a Rap for walleye as everyone knows they don't bite on those. Filled the gas tank with straight gas, rather than the mix needed...so we had to be towed in."

6721913,Chequamegon,2023-03-10 08:03:00,112,"IF a tip has been earned, in my opinion 20% seems to be customary but if you've had what in your opinion is an exceptional day, let the guide know your thoughts by being more generous."

6721969,v-bay gord,2023-03-10 10:43:00,3168,"Showing some appreciation for an enjoyable experience seems like the right thing to do in my mind. I understand some people just don't tip. For whatever reason, that is their belief and I'm fine with that....but handing out cash isn't the only way to show someone you appreciated their time & effort. As an example many people (most) leave our cleaning ladies a tip when they leave. This makes them feel appreciated and leaves them in a good mood. I appreciate that. Some people will leave their cabin immaculate, but leave no monetary tip. The ladies still appreciate the effort they took. The point is do something to show your appreciation if you felt the service, facility, guide whatever made your stay memorable. Some may say well why don't you pay your cleaning ladies more so they won't care about a tip? The answer is everyone appreciates the ""unexpected"" bonus, thank you, venison sausage, bottle of wine.......over and above a pay check. It's that simple. Here's to everyone having great & memorable experiences in 2023!"
6721973,Eckohlt,2023-03-10 11:07:00,3685,"I go for leaving the cabin or outpost immaculate,doesn't take much effort."

We also clean the fish cleaning house really well every night when we are done, not something a lot of other tend to do but the owner always knows when we were the last ones in there the night before."
6722001,prov1800,2023-03-10 11:59:00,5010,Iam sure leaving the cabin spotless is well appreciated.

6722021,Old Timer,2023-03-10 12:59:00,255,"The few times I've used a guide I've always received value, even on lakes I know quite well. It seems many, if not most, posters on this Canada forum are adverse to hiring a guide. Makes no sense to me, especially on new water. You're paying a bunch just to reach the chosen lake, but then go cheap when it comes to catching fish. I don't know if it's a macho deal or what. But for me I'd skimp on other aspects of the trip if a guide was the make-or-break component to a productive fishing experience. Just having somebody else worry about rocks is worth a bunch too."
6721283,Eckohlt,2023-03-08 10:39:00,3685,Do you know the cost of that 8-16 day trip??

6721303,Eckohlt,2023-03-08 11:24:00,3685,"Sounds like a blast,1000k of crawlers,lol,maybe end up like Tom hanks in castaway,hope they ain't taken down into Mexico??so leave the ultra light at home I guess."

I guess I’m cheap as at ~$600 / day, that’s almost a trip to Canada. I’d rather learn the hard way and figure it out than cough up that much cash."
6721313,Eckohlt,2023-03-08 11:34:00,3685,You could buy some darn good electronics for 600$

6721745,proguidedream,2023-03-09 14:21:00,345,"100% it should be based off satisfaction. especially for an owner operator that cant get fired for doing a lowsy job. if you go out and crack some monster fish, or bucket list fish, then tip at your max. if you get a ""eh thats why they call it fishing and not catching"" and you dont think the guide did enough to make it worth it, id match it with a lowsy tip. USD is a worth a lot more to a Canadian also.. if you have lots of money you could consider tipping everywhere. the pilot that flew you in safe, etc etc etc. for most people that is just considered doing their job tho."
6721777,prov1800,2023-03-09 16:31:00,5010,Sometimes a guide trip can make or break your trip.new lake they can put you on some good fishing give up some spots so rest of week your not searching and getting nothing.500-600 is cheap insurance on a lower unit or the bottom of your boat.ive seen guys getting towed in after telling me they would carefull.lol.250 hp lower unit pretty expensive.
6721789,Whopper,2023-03-09 17:06:00,340,Ole Smokey lol The few times I have used a guide it was 20 to 25 percent.
6721237,That Minnesota guy,2023-03-08 08:32:00,8293,"I have always tipped my guide. But that said NOBODY will tell me what the amount should be. If it's ""EXPECTED"" add it to their rate. If it's truly a tip let them earn it. This topic comes up at least 3 times a year and the opinions are always the same. If the guy does well for you give him something. If he is terrible give him nothing. A tip is like respect.....it needs to be earned."
6721241,prov1800,2023-03-08 08:46:00,5010,The tropical guide trips my wife and I have been on typically were 4 hr trips at 500 + plus a tip.Worth every penny as we didn't have a clue where to go plus no boat.Have got a few bucket list fish that way.
6721245,That Minnesota guy,2023-03-08 08:55:00,8293,"Would you have given him a tip if it was a shi!!y experience? In my mind you paid him $125 a hour, if the wants a tip beyond that he needs to do something to earn it. If he did great....if not then he can be happy with the fee."
6721251,prov1800,2023-03-08 09:03:00,5010,"Probably.Was a really nice guy.We got lucky with a tarpon each.So worked out great.But fishing is fishing.i know that.The experience of heading was awesome.In the keys,Islamorada.Bud and Marie's marina.2 party boat trips"
6721253,That Minnesota guy,2023-03-08 09:10:00,8293,"2 party boat trips So he was getting $1,000 for 4 hour trips? Nice gig if you can get it."

6721259,Yellowfin123,2023-03-08 09:41:00,2182,"a party boat is a typical 60 - 80ft trawler type boat where everybody just pays a fee 50-100 bucks and people line up around the rails and drop straight down, you can tip if you want.... in cal we called them cattle boats.. on any thing else tipping is the norm, whether you bring home fish or not!! if the guide is a ****head they don't last long anyway in the business"
6721267,prov1800,2023-03-08 09:57:00,5010,"Big boat.Very quite.only 12 people.Guy at hotel told us to tell lady where you pay that we wanted the back of the boat.so paid 5 more each Good move.people on side rails dropped straight down on back of boat due to current we long lined out and caught way more.yellow tails trigger fish.few mackerel and some orange fish with popped out eyes.lol.Had a blast.Guides kept cutting up bait and at end cleaned our fish.They did get tipped.We drove to key west and had rented a floating room in a bay there with a kitchen and had a fish fry out on deck of that room.Had my rods with me and caught 100 pin fish fish and 2 small 40"" tarpons on my muskie rods i brought plus had walleye rods.What a blast."

If you really want a party boat, you should google the long range fleet out of san diego, anywhere from 8 -16 day trips and go to some of the best fishing grounds on earth, many world records, they'll come home with a 1/2 million dollars worth of fish sometimes, food and cabin included..."
6721277,prov1800,2023-03-08 10:29:00,5010,Sounds interesting.But maybe to busy for us.Have fished out of Corpes Christie.
6721155,Fishquest,2023-03-08 06:05:00,89,I want to hear some opinions from both fisher people and guides as i'm looking for input on how to handle it. I'm good with tips and on fly in trips I've always tipped pilot and dock crews as I know they work hard. But here is my question I have a trip booked for two of us with a guide at a coost of $600 for the 8 hour day who is the owner of the service and I'm wondering do people tip the owner as he is all ready charging a good amount for the day? I would always tip a lodge guide as I know they are working hard for there money. I know someone will comment and say they work hard for there money but so do I to afford a day like this. I'd like to hear your thoughts. Thanks
6721157,v-bay gord,2023-03-08 06:11:00,3168,I wouldn't tip the owner of Walmart but someone who is trying to make a living by guiding and running a one man business is different in my opinion.
6721167,Old Timer,2023-03-08 06:34:00,255,"I kinda think a tip is the norm. Even if not required, it's sorta expected. If using a guide you prolly should figure in a 20-25% add-on as a benchmark. And yes, that goes for the owner/guide of a small operation. It's just how it works."
6721171,prov1800,2023-03-08 06:43:00,5010,So for myself iam at 500 US for the day.Decent wage in anyone's books.My day usually starts at my house which is 10 miles north of Vermilion Bay.Wherever I guide I usually have to pull my boat somewhere.So farthest I go would be Lac Suel which is a hour someday closer.So I have recover some gas money for my truck and then what ever amount of gas I use for my boat.Also depending on what type of species we are after there's minnows involved.So everything would be included.Tipping is up to guests but there's always a tip.I know guys that guide that have 200+hp engines and I know those days they will charge over 700 for a day.I do guide at different camps and then your looking at a cheaper day using using a camp boat that you get with your fishing package at 275 for the day.
6721173,Tristian5431,2023-03-08 06:47:00,37,"I generally tip 20%. That is stateside of course. Most guides charge 500 per day, so I usually give a $100 tip. For me, you are paying and tipping for their vast knowledge of the area, experience, etc. If they are good, they will help you usurp the learning curve and have a great experience. Some guides are worth their weight in gold. I did have one bad experience. I was down at Disney World in Orlando and a guide was basically yelling at my girlfriend at the time (wife now) that she couldn't put sun tan lotion on her arms because she might get it on his fancy bass boat lol. His tip was have a great day sir! I had a great day in November up in Syracuse NY. A guide I was fishing with worked his butt off to get me 28lbs for our best 5 smallmouth! **** of a day, probably the best fishing day that I will in my life. We stayed out past the eight hours because the big girls were chewing. So instead of the $100 tip I think I tipped 175 or 200. My baseline is usually $100 and then if you have a heck of a day and or the effort is really there on the guides part I will sometimes go above."
6721217,HeHooksHimself,2023-03-08 07:52:00,725,"Let me just say we have never used a guide and probably never will, but I am amazed with the sentiments of tipping guides. I am probably old school (I am definitely old) but I always thought tipping was based on the level of satisfaction with the service. For a fishing guide, it seems like the level of tipping should be based on his or her performance, i.e. their personality, their helpfulness, the results and the experience. I can't remember ever making $500 a day in my life, but I realize that is gross, not net. The guide should set their rate based on the idea that they won't get a tip and if they do it should be gravy, not an expectation. I am sure I will get some flack for this opinion but hey, isn't that what makes us unique? And, like I said, it is unlikely that I will ever use a guide. Meanwhile, Fish On! Hooks"
6721219,Fishquest,2023-03-08 07:52:00,89,Thanks for the insight so far.
6721225,Sylvanboat,2023-03-08 08:06:00,94,This is my experience too. I never thought the owner should be tipped but I have been straightened out. I have going to. NW Ontario lodge for years using the same guide. I also tipped the guide (not the owner) appx 25% and last year he told me I need to boost it to $100 per day. He is the best guide at the lodge and other guests are willing to pay top dollar to get him. I will pay to keep him.
6721229,prov1800,2023-03-08 08:17:00,5010,"If you like fishing everyday,in all conditions from spring to late fall it's a great gig."
6721231,Fisherman Ted,2023-03-08 08:21:00,461,"As a fisherman tipping a guide is standard. In the keys or Caribbean its a minimum of $100 for the day and usually more. Montana drift boats the same. Patagonia probably more. As a lodge owner that runs guides I tell my guests at least $75 for the day (as they are using my boats) and have already paid to be at the lodge. If however they came in for a day and got a guide, $100 standard. -FT"
