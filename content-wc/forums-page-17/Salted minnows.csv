6726411,Eckohlt,2023-03-24 13:03:00,3685,"I think garlic salted minnows would put some kind of fish in a feeding frenzy,,possibly Asian carp,wonder if prov1800 guides for carp??"
6726711,KSjim,2023-03-25 20:18:00,88,Life minnows are hard to beat. After doing fly-in outpost fishing for many years and trying to keep minnows alive we started salting fresh new dead minnows. Salted minnows work fine.

6726797,Fishing1956,2023-03-26 09:29:00,3,Thanks for all the info. Looks like I won't be able to bring them across the border anyway. Might try them on the Mississippi.
6726069,Fishing1956,2023-03-23 13:46:00,3,Just wondering if anyone has used salted minnows and what kind of results you have had. Headed to Gullrock and curious if it's worth trying.

Biggest pitfall is that they make an enormous mess in the boat. Salt gets everywhere. I would say you are always further ahead with the live ones though, assuming bait is readily available where you are going. I would also assume that if you are going to use them, probably have to go through Canada bait shops to get them. I don't think you can bring anything over across the border. Dead/alive in the way of minnows. Might be worth checking into however as those rules tend to change here and there."

6726259,guidedfishing,2023-03-24 06:11:00,531,"Well since you can no longer bring dead or live bait across the border, and bait dealers are not allowed to sell salted minnows (Ontario) its probably a moot point. So if you are traveling to Ontario to fish from the US salted minnows are just not as convenient as they may of been.In the scheme of a fishing trip, the cost of bait is my least concern, and honestly don't mind supporting the local camp or bait shop by purchasing bait on site, especially since by law in Ontario you need the receipt from the camp or the bait shop with you when fishing that your bait locally came from.I certainly like having live or dead bait, but don't feel handicapped with artificial presentations.So yes salted minnows can work great. Bringing them or obtaining them really does not fit in the program well anymore."
6726263,prov1800,2023-03-24 06:28:00,5010,Think there planning something big
6726267,walleyecheek,2023-03-24 06:39:00,2231,How about Unsalted !.....LOL.LOL.LOL.
6726285,prov1800,2023-03-24 07:06:00,5010,In my experience it seems unsalted has always worked just fine.
6726359,gmattbruin,2023-03-24 10:12:00,174,"LOL, good one!! Our guy will just do what your guy tells him. Problem is, your guy cant remember what he told him. And neither of us has a good replacement. Id say were both #%@#@#. Go with worms!! LOL"
