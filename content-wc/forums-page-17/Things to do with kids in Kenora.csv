6722559,Fisherman Ted,2023-03-12 10:25:00,461,"Ironically years ago we had LOW beer on tap. But guests really did not like it. So we now have a couple kegs going at a time. A Canadian keg like Molson and maybe a US one too. We also carry cans like Guiness, Heineken, Coors, etc. And then there is the full bar and wine on tap (red and white). -FT"
6725213,proguidedream,2023-03-20 12:49:00,345,for basic beer drinkers LOTW goes like this 1)- lakeside kolsch 2)-channel marker 3) sultana gold 4) Lago 5)nautical disaster IPA flip the list around if you enjoy ipa. their blueberry one is decent but not really a summer drink.
6721117,KC Walleye,2023-03-07 21:33:00,274,Thank you to all who commented. Much appreciated.
6721133,Bigtaproot,2023-03-08 04:57:00,900,How about the McDonald’s play land that is located by the days inn in Kenora GPF and I had all of our childrens parties at McDonald’s play lands and the kids still talk about how special it was
6721137,pjshorthorn,2023-03-08 05:29:00,5654,"Give Gord a call to see if you and the son could come over for a day and go explore Clearwater Lake It is a portage lake that has Indian paintings and is quite. You can take a 15 minute hike in to the lake or an hour boat ride in with a lot of scenery and beaver huts to see. If one is lucky, you might even have to drag your boat over a beaver dam. If you wanted to fish just bring a rod along. There is smallmouth, northern and lake trout. PjShorthorn"
6721147,prov1800,2023-03-08 05:57:00,5010,Be fun trip.might have to drag boats over the beaver dams this year.Could be some low water
6721193,Tristian5431,2023-03-08 07:03:00,37,How the heck do I find this place? I was in the area last June fishing at Pine cliff lodge off of Hwy 72. I drove up and down this highway a few times trying to find this place so I could check out the dump lol.. never found it of course!
6721213,proguidedream,2023-03-08 07:48:00,345,"lake of the woods brew co is a very nice resteraunt , good appetizer food. imo you can spend the whole day in rushing river. bring some hot dogs, buy some wood cook them over a fire . i believe the store sells ice cream, candy. pretty fun beach to swim at. Kenora proper does have its fair share of 'loogans' but you could have a day checking out the muskie, the harbour, not sure if the paddle wheel boat still runs."
6721235,Fisherman Ted,2023-03-08 08:26:00,461,"The Blue Heron closed a couple of years ago. Lake of the Woods Brewery is overhyped. Service is terrible. Food mediocre. Beer bad. But, its supply and demand. Great location and only brewery within hundreds of miles. On Wednesdays there is a farmers market under the Pavilion on the waterfront which is kind of cool. Lots of vendors, food, ice cream, cup cakes. -FT"
6721821,gopherbuddy,2023-03-09 19:46:00,51,It may be too far to drive but our kids always enjoyed Mini Golf and ice cream in Sioux Narrows at the Lazy Loon as a break from the fishing thing.
6722335,Laketripper,2023-03-11 15:15:00,103,I've always had a pleasant experience visiting L.O.T.W. Brewery in Kenora. Some of their beers I prefer over their others but I wouldn't call them bad beers. I am glad they are in the region. Which beers do you offer at your lodge on Hawk Lake?
6722495,Tamarck,2023-03-12 09:07:00,9,"I will offer a comment on this one, largely echoing V Bay Gord. I have been passing through Kenora while fishing and guiding LOTW for....30 plus years. And I will attest to the fact that the town has taken a seriously dark turn for the worst. Homelessness, drugs and crime are a real blight on that community right now, and due to the very small size and concentration of the business zone, so too concentrates the social issues. I'm on the lake 30-40 days during open water season, and I avoid it like the plague. Case in point that served to confirm best practices, last October my wife and I were renting a cottage on the lake for 5 days and thought we'd take a break and go into town, I'm 6'0"" 230# and I know how to handle myself and I was very uncomfortable and on high alert as we moved around. Had my wife wait for me to walk her into businesses, and my head was on a swivel at all times. My advice: avoid."
6720773,prov1800,2023-03-07 06:05:00,5010,There's really not much for a 10 year old to do in either dryden or kenora.Theres not much to do for a adult in either town.Huskie the muskie is OK to see for a few minutes.Maybe take him to Tim Hortons for a donut.That or stay on the lake and do a big shorelunch on the lake on a beach.
6720799,v-bay gord,2023-03-07 07:42:00,3168,"The trip might be about experiences you can't get at home. Being on the lake doesn't necessarily mean fishing. Explore some back bays, streams, portage lakes, remote beaches, driftwood, islands etc. Does the camp have a kayak, paddleboat, canoe? Campfire. Shore-lunch. Local trails, nearby Provincial parks? Cook a special lunch back at your cabin. Check out wildlife....do you have binoculars? Are there Indian pictographs in the area? Some of the smaller towns (Sioux Narrows, V-Bay) might be a better option for some tackle shopping or ice cream."
6720807,prov1800,2023-03-07 07:58:00,5010,"You got Gord.Your up in Sunset Country for a reason.Probably come from a big city.I can't see the need to really visit more crowds,turn off the phones,as far as iam concerned the whole Kenora/Sioux narrows area is to busy to be called a getaway,you have a lot of US travellers there and then all the people from Winnipeg only 2 hrs away.but that's just me."
6720825,Eckohlt,2023-03-07 08:25:00,3685,"Need to invent a way to attach a iPod to a fishing pole,the kids can watch a movie n fish at the same time,double whammy."
6720883,Bill Krejca,2023-03-07 09:49:00,6107,"The Rushing River Park is an interesting, pretty place to visit, the various falls are neat, although I don't know if it would be as interesting for a youngster. The on-the-water experience - shore lunches, exploring the rocky bush, etc, might make a more lasting impression on the youngster - some kids enjoy this sort of thing, others, maybe would hate it. Sometimes painting the picture before arriving can work itself out - I'd share with the youngster what you believe you will be doing and ask for input, when folks think they are understandably part of the solution, they are more willing to follow it through, etc. Also, I still remember taking the Kenora boat tour down the lake in the 1950's, it was a fun excursion. Bill"
6720945,MN_Moose,2023-03-07 12:08:00,964,"I go to Kenora every year. But, I don't know what a ten year old would enjoy. Maybe go down to the city docks and see float planes take off and land. Watch people loading up the houseboats. I'm with others that think time on the water would be most enjoyable. Shore lunch. catching crayfish. exploring rocks. learning to make a fire. knot tying. learning to read a map. I'd bet the most memorable would be spending time with Dad and Grandpa."
6720963,Eckohlt,2023-03-07 12:33:00,3685,"I had a ten year old in the boat a few years back,he enjoyed racing 2 crawlers on the bench in a 14 ft boat.then when we got on the fish he'd take a break n grab his pole.Plenty to do in a boat if you have a good imagination."
6720983,Walleye2242,2023-03-07 14:03:00,263,Your trip and you can explore anyway you want. I was 7 when my dad took me. I loved to fish and it was a fishing trip. I fished or took a nap across the boat seat until i fished again. In camp I ran around...helped people clean and package fish...helped people dock their boats...searched for frogs...skipped rocks. Hung out in the cabin and learned to play euchre and also learned NOT to bother the adults during card playing and drink time. We did go into town like 1 time for a couple hours. I got my 1st rapala fillet knife. dad told me not to take it out of package until we got back to camp that i might cut myself. What does a dumb A@@ kid do? took it out in the back seat and proceeded to cut myself but never said a word...blood all over my jeans trying to hide it. would rather bleed to death than get the wrath of the old man. He was a brickmason and a farmer...his hands were like iron claws.
6720985,Yellowfin123,2023-03-07 14:29:00,2182,"too funny but the truth, a brickmason could crush a steel pipe with those paws"
6721007,Shorelunch,2023-03-07 15:51:00,554,"The waterfront is fun as already mentioned. Lake of the Woods Brewing has a neat indoor/outdoor restaurant. There's a really nice tackle shop just west outside of town called LOTW Sports Headquarters and maybe a stop at the Blue Heron.Other options - for sure Rushing River, maybe Kenora dam and Tunnel Island Trail. There's also a discovery center (never been) and a museum The Muse - never been)."
6720455,KC Walleye,2023-03-06 08:37:00,274,"My oldest child, 10 years old, will be making his first trip to Canada in June to fish with myself and his Grandfather, and our group. He is very excited for this experience and to join the group, as am I. He has fished a lot, and we know the strategies to keeping him entertained and comfortable in a boat all day long. We have talked about taking a day, possibly even two, off from fishing and just going exploring and doing some touristy type stuff. I have done some research on things to do in Kenora and I have a small list going, but I thought I would pose the question here as welll. Any recommendations on activities for a 10 year old in Kenora area in early June? Was thinking of visiting the Discovery Center, picture with Husky the Musky, and having a nice lunch somewhere at a minimum. We are staying close to the Rushing River Provincial Park, so we will hit that also. Any recommendations on Kenora restaurants? He's a typical kid, loves pizza, cheeseburgers, chicken wings, etc. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance, KC"
6720491,Old Timer,2023-03-06 10:48:00,255,"You'll find plenty of fast food places around. I think the most interesting spot is the waterfront. Lots of boats, planes and other activity there. Good place to snoop around. They have tour boats if interested. If you aren't catching fish at your camp you might hire a guide for 1/2 day. You'll find one right there."
6720523,Lac Seul John,2023-03-06 11:56:00,31,My son's first trip was in the Nestor Falls area. I think he was about 10 or so. We took an evening trip to the city dump to watch the bears. I think we still talk about that as much as we do the fishing!
6720529,Eckohlt,2023-03-06 11:59:00,3685,I would still like that even at my age!
6720531,v-bay gord,2023-03-06 12:02:00,3168,"Not trying to be negative towards Kenora, but their homeless / drug issues are impacting the ""tourist friendly"" atmosphere."
6720541,Eckohlt,2023-03-06 12:30:00,3685,"It's getting to be everywhere,people getting use to seeing it,even in the filthy Rich city I live in,very common."
6720649,Skywagon,2023-03-06 17:15:00,1106,"Been to Dryden lately Gord? Drugs, need for a rehab center, homeless shelter and policing are the big topics with Dryden council these days. A Dryden councilman told me that the Reserves at Ft Frances and Kenora are kicking their problem people out and that they are now find their way to Dryden. All the new people that have come to live in Dryden in the last 10 years have really improved the towns image Kenora does not look so bad anymore."
6720667,v-bay gord,2023-03-06 18:36:00,3168,"True, but Dryden has never been the tourist town Kenora has. It's unfortunate, but after sending a few groups to Kenora last year I won't do it again...."
6720681,Eckohlt,2023-03-06 19:03:00,3685,"Better to send them back out in a boat,they'll learn more."
6720717,KC Walleye,2023-03-06 21:41:00,274,"Where do you send them then Gord? For a day off the water, with a child, where would you recommend, or what is your most highly recommended experience for them?"
