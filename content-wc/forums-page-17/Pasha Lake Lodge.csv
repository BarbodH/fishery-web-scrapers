I did a search on this outfitter, but could not find anything recent. My brother and I are interested in booking a trip with them, but I am reluctant to commit to a week of bushwacking. Thanks in advance to anyone who can provide info./intel. Really appreciate it!"

The only downfall is you are driving every day to a lake and if you look at their site map, some lakes are 45 minutes away. That’s too long for me and then I saw a cool YouTube video of hiking into a lake, but carrying your gear, outboard & whatever else you need for a day is past my time. If you haul an ATV up there I guess, but I really don’t even care for portage lakes anymore as it’s more of a pain to me. The fishing looks good, Onaman, Beatty & they have trips to Nipigon, but you need to plan to be driving all week which just doesn’t sound fun to me."
6726771,eyecatcher1,2023-03-26 07:38:00,323,I talked with them a few years ago. I like to bring my own boat and they told me that you don't want to try to launch a nice boat at any of their ramps. They're pretty primative I guess.

We stayed at a nearby lodge & bought bait from Pasha, took out a map of the area & marked it up for us. We fished Northwind lake, caught blue walleye & had a blast. Was a 45 minute drive down logging roads, rough stuff! We towed a camp boat there. Some guys that stayed at Pasha were at the ramp too, they didnt bring keys to unlock one of the boats kept there, needless to say, they weren't happy! They had to drive back, get keys & make the trip back to the lake again! If you want to hit a bunch of lakes in the area they would be a great choice if you didn't mind driving each day."

I think the ruggedness appealed to me (and the philosophy of doing it while I still can). But overall it just seemed way too inconvenient. And after driving 14 hours straight to get there, I don't want to have to think and plan what I am going to re-pack into my car every single day and drive again and then drive back. And repeat. Among all the other considerations you need to make to make these excursions not feel complicated. That being said, I still do think about the Pasha experience from time to time."
6726857,Eckohlt,2023-03-26 17:36:00,3685,"Not only re-pack your car,you have to load your gear in the boat and unload it at days end!"
6726867,prov1800,2023-03-26 18:09:00,5010,Did a LOT of that kind of fishing in my younger days.Was fun but can remember the days with all bugs drove you nuts.
6726873,Eckohlt,2023-03-26 18:28:00,3685,Lot easier walking from the cabin to the dock and be catching fish in 5 to 10 minutes.
6727539,Squirrel761,2023-03-28 20:36:00,4,"I have gone ice fishing at Pasha Lake Lodge a couple times over the past 3 years and they have really nice cabins. The staff was very friendly and we had the guide take us out for a couple days. You are right about driving to the lakes. We drove to several lakes and parked along the road and snowmobiled in. Fishing was great everywhere we went. They have a new guide there now who is a local guy. I’ve wanted to go there in the summer as I like the idea of driving to a different lake every day. Lake Nipigon is not far from the lodge and has huge Lake Trout as well as everything else. The lake at the lodge has Lake Trout, Pike and Perch. Across that lake and a 5 minute walk through the bush is a small lake with Brook Trout in it. If you don’t mind the driving everyday to some great fishing it’s definitely worth contacting Chad and give it a try. Some of the drives are on logging roads so make sure you have good tires. We have seen wolves and bob cats on out drives. Hope this helps."
