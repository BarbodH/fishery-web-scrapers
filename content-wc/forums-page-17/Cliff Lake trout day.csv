6727485,Ohio fisherman,2023-03-28 16:38:00,988,"Well, sort of maybe…….a gun may be carried there like in other national parks.My Super Redhawk is a little noticeable.Plus a prudent person does what is necessary whether that is staying out of an area that is unreasonably dangerous or carrying a gun in spite of prohibitions.(Some time ask me about visits to Harlem after midnight and the south side of Chicago.)One of the most dangerous bear areas is Katmai NP.Carrying there was prohibited.However, many fishing guides who I know personally would always carry discreetly there.Very thin topsoil. Some valleys have a nice amount.Fishing is great in hidden pockets.The rest is not too good. My son now lives about 7 miles from the edge of Glacier NP.In the above post, I typed “oar” and the darn autocorrect changed it.As in I used an oar to push the bear away."
6727499,Yellowfin123,2023-03-28 17:08:00,2182,"i could be wrong, it might be legal to carry in glacier but illegal to fire it like yellowstone, so if your on a back country trail and you fire the gun in self defence from a bear charge, your just going to federal prison anyway.. might be better to take your chances with the bear.. I keep the bear spray cocked and ready its just all you can do, I'd like to hike in a fish heart lake, they won't open that trail till about jul 20 when most of the bears are up high in the peaks eating moths"
6727507,Ohio fisherman,2023-03-28 17:29:00,988,"Many bears killed in defense of life or property (Alaska rule) or in defense of life (most other places) do not get reported. The investigation is quite rigorous and can result in serious prosecution - incarceration, fines, restitution, probation monitoring, etc. We have always respected the bears and never pushed their limits. The spooky situations have been when wifey and I were fishing about 20 yards apart and a bear would silently slip in between us. Then we would silently slip out leaving the bear. I have never been in a boat on Yellowstone lake. It must be great fun. Visibility must be incredible."

6726551,Eckohlt,2023-03-25 08:33:00,3685,"Lol,that's a good one,the guy should have made citizens arrest after the warden threw the bomb."
6727395,Ohio fisherman,2023-03-28 13:19:00,988,"To compare fishing among the bears - I have fished all over northwestern Wyoming and western Montana for trout where both grizzly and black bears are present. I have fished all over Yellowstone NP including the shore of the big lake on foot - seeing grizzly bears. I have fished the best spot in Glacier NP for cutthroat trout - it was a 15 mile hike in and a grizzly bear haven. I have fished coastal Alaska for trout and salmon on foot and by boat with brown bears all around and even once a 2 year old cub nudging our boat. I have fished interior Alaska for trout and Grayling where grizzly and black bears were present. I have fished Maine for trout and Atlantic salmon among the highest state population of black bears in the USA. My conclusion is that all bears are dangerous and unpredictable. The cub referenced above split off from its mother and two other cubs on shore and swam to our boat anchored 25 yards from shore - mom showed no concern. I used an or to twice push it away from the boat. On a different occasion, in a drift boat anchored in a river three brown bear cubs appeared near shore and the mother roared ferociously. In some places I was armed with a revolver, shotgun, rifle, bear spray, or nothing. In the most dangerous place by a far stretch - the Glacier NP grizzly haven, I was unarmed and no bear spray. That bear situation was very different than I have seen anywhere else. It was foolish and I would never repeat being unarmed there. We did not stay there very long. Along a remote shoreline of Yellowstone lake, I experienced a school of 20-26 cutthroat trout sipping flies off the surface. It was just after sunrise and I was standing in hip deep water. They were all around me. At that point I did not cast one more time - it was too much of a special moment. They slowly moved along the shoreline feasting. I could clearly see them in the crystal clear water because of the flat calm water, the direction of the lighting and polarized glasses. It was a wonderful experience."
6725397,prov1800,2023-03-21 10:36:00,5010,Where we were is not like the bears you see on the tourist spots.Those were wild bears.We did a 20 mi float trip and those bears don't see many people.we got out of our boats here and there to fish and didn't venture far.But guys I was with from Texas had big pistols and actually brought me one lol.Dont think they would of done much damage those bears we saw Absolutly huge.We saw quite a few bears on the sand bars catching salmon as it was low due to tide going out by ocean We had to drag our duck boats across the gravelly and those bears really wouldn't move.we got pretty close to them but there more interested in the salmon so we snuck by them.When my wife and I fished the Campbell River on Vancouver Island along the shore line there were many black bears there also going after salmon.Kept a eye out there as we where right by bushline.
6725413,prov1800,2023-03-21 11:32:00,5010,So since it's lunch time and had a couple of crappie fillets left I took one and put it on toast with some mayo on it.My kind of lunch.Anybody else think they could of went for that.Big fillet.
6725609,Bill Krejca,2023-03-22 06:37:00,6107,"Yellowfin - thanks for the info, I can understand the situation now. It seems like doing some netting during fall spawn would be contributory to reducing the lake trout population, netting has certainly caused severe unfortunate reductions in other water bodies. I certainly would keep any I caught, as I do like them as table fare. It is a strange (speaking as a Midwesterner)problem to have, although understandable, similar to maybe the walleye encroachment concern into trout waters. Bill"
6725775,Yellowfin123,2023-03-22 17:44:00,2182,"I really don't know but surly all the biologist have a plan on what to do with all the lakers from the netting, they keep a tally on a chalk board on how many they've killed so far in a year for everybody to see at the marina t bridge bay, I doubt they throw them in a ditch somewhere.... I'm not sure how affective the netting has has been, the lake's almost 500 ft deep in the main basin.... they were brought in from the great lakes by the army in 1902 i think to stock the big lewis lake and shoshone lake along with brown trout for the sportsman because for the last million years they were fishless because nothing could migrate past lewis falls... there's a ton of lakers and browns in there and the limit is 3 lakers i think but that drains to the pacific, but just a short car ride away, anything that drains to the atlantic, its all out war! there's other places in idaho and in montana where there's a poster on the wall that shows a picture of a lake trout that says wanted dead or alive!! i'm sure you've probably seen it but if you google ""fishing bridge"" that goes over the outlet of yellowstone lake and see the people lined up? that was 70 fish per hour avg fishing now the big lake is full of lunkers , you never catch anything under 20 inches its amazing it seems people don't take advantage of the fishing in the lakes and rivers there, but the foreigners love it, alot of people from europe come for the trout streams and just marvel at our lands and rivers here, they've got nowhere to fish over there"

6725909,Bill Krejca,2023-03-23 08:07:00,6107,"Thanks for the further info. Even in a deep lake, it is my understanding that the lakers prefer the shallow spawning ledges, entire lake systems have been nearly wiped of lakers in some northern lakes by the placing of shallow nets. They have to spawn/attempt to spawn somewhere, would think a commercial group could be invited in, and it wouldn't be expensive/would be less expensive on the state, but this is probably too simple for the situation, always other factors not necessarily biological at play, etc. Interesting situation, anyway! Bill"
6725949,Yellowfin123,2023-03-23 09:55:00,2182,"best bet would be to send ECK in a 24ft boat with the latest and greatest electronics, by the end of summer the lake would be devoid of all living life"

6725311,Bill Krejca,2023-03-21 06:56:00,6107,"Interesting dialogue re: kill 'em all. I have heard of walleye not being welcome in some western waters and maybe some trout species in some streams, etc, but haven't be made aware of unwanted lake trout waters. Where, prey tell, is this pristine water where the lake trout are considered trash fish? There has to be an intriguing story behind this, please enlighten us unknowing. Thanks. Bill"
