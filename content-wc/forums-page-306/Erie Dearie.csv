3127033,Karloutdoors,2014-08-26 19:54:00,828,Thought of adding a stinger hook while using crawlers similar to the second hook of a crawler harness. Anyone else feel the need and or tried it?
3096841,northerneyes,2014-08-17 08:35:00,72,"Used this in NWO this past week. I've had these for several trips, really never used them. Tipped with a minnow or crawler these things out fished everything else in the tackle box. I would be catching walleyes with them, switch to other types and not much action. Switch back and started catching again. Anybody else use these guys?"
3097249,JayM5209,2014-08-17 10:51:00,1050,"Wow!! Talk about a serendipity. I just spent an hour in the garage sorting tackle boxes for my next trip to NW Ontario and came in five minutes ago to pour a cup of coffee and check what's happening on WC. In a tray of lures that I haven't touched for years I saw six or seven Erie Dearies and put them in a tray that went into a bag for the specific purpose of experimenting with them when I next go north. I'll be interested in any responses to your post. How were you fishing them? In addition to minnows and crawlers, did you try pairing one with plastics, like a paddle tail? I love these posts about different, unusual, or ""old time"" presentations."
3097521,kriplur,2014-08-17 12:35:00,37,"Have used them for years with great success. When the wind is pounding into the rocky points or the small coves we cast them close to the shoreline, approx. 2 to 3 feet of water. Seems like the harder the wind blows the better the walleye fishing. We use mostly leeches because they stay on the hook when casting much better than a crawler or minnow. We hook the leech in the sucker end and than back through again about a 1/4 "" down from the sucker, double hooking them, keeps them on the hook much better. A slow retrieve seems to work the best for us. One last thing we do is to remove the hook on the erie derie and replace it with a #1 bait holder hook."
3097609,northerneyes,2014-08-17 12:54:00,72,"I mainly trolled them in about 4-6 ft of water right through a lot of weeds. I used crawlers about 90% of the time, minnows the rest of the time. I did not use any plastics. I did cast them a little but not a lot. The best color was the green/white but also used red/white. Green/white worked better. I was also impressed at how well they did in the weeds. The bait seemed to stay on really well, I had to reel in to clean weeds off many times, but the worms stayed put. I am going to put in an order with Cabelas for some more to have on hand for next trip."
3097865,JayM5209,2014-08-17 14:32:00,1050,"Northerneyes, before you order more do a quick check on eBay. Skip over whoever it is that's trying to sell individual ones for $15 per! I see lots of 6-8 for around a buck per lure. (I should have purchased some, or at least bid before saying this. Now the bids will go up.)"
3102097,mudpusher,2014-08-18 20:15:00,248,Tried them years ago ... lots of line twist
3105985,kliph,2014-08-19 20:22:00,2337,"Line twist with a Erie Dearie? It has an off set weight.Have used them drifting a lake Erie, worked great."
3106113,polaris-pete,2014-08-19 21:20:00,343,"I have used Erie Dearies, original ones and the last few years the Off Branded ones and have never had any line twist problems, either casting or trolling them.A great lure."
3106449,Juls,2014-08-20 03:24:00,13414,Isn't line twist the reason they created barrel swivels?
3106673,lassh,2014-08-20 06:01:00,553,What do you find the best way to put the worm on the hook?
