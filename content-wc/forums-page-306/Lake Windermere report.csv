As MrSimon told me, once you find the water they want to be in you can just repeat that pattern all over the place. A cold front blew in on Tuesday with the wind holding steady out of the West Northwest, long points and boulder strewn wind blown shorelines with close breaks both proved very good. Weed beds in sheltered bays also offered a nice mix of walleye and bass when we were tired of bucking the wind. High summer is a numbers time, probably averaged 40 or 50 per day per rod with a few days doubling that, though we didn't get any really big walleye. Most in the 14""-19"" range with some dinks and some low 20's. Everything came on jig and plastic tipped with a small piece of crawler. Well, one exception was my kid who was dying to use his baitcaster and he got some on crankbaits. The program was to hit a spot and have everybody fish a different depth, if it didn't produce right away, move on. When it did produce it was usually good for a couple dozen fish before it slowed down. For example, we would roll up on a hump and hang at about the 20' mark. One guy would throw on top of it, one would fish 20' and one would fish deeper. Once we had had a few bites we would focus on that depth. Many spots just kept producing all day though the depth would change quite a bit, and we would make a circuit of points, shorelines and humps. It wasn't rocket science but I'll bet that if you just trolled the same depth all day long you could have slow day. We also fished for smallmouth and caught lots of them in the 2#-4# range with a few 5# mixed in. The other boat in our group got a 6#. There is a portage lake near the outpost cabin and the bass fishing there was incredible. A river flows in one end and we caught smallmouth, pike and walleye non-stop for three hours, mostly smallies. I do mean non-stop. If five minutes went by without somebody having a fish on we commented on how it had slowed down. Naturally, we went back to that spot two days later after the front blew in and it wasn't nearly as good, still darn good just not like that. Timing is everything. We had quite the adventure on that second portage. The boats the lodge has stashed only have oars so we schlepped in a 6 horse and headed a couple miles across the lake to a fast moving outflow that can be very good as well. The outflow is fast and shallow enough that we planned to raise the motor and row our way through it. On the second pull one oar snapped clean in two and we went for a Missouri Boat Ride. After we floated out into the next lake the problem of getting back up the fast water presented itself. With a few hundred thousand square miles of Canadian wilderness available to us the task of finding a suitable piece of wood for a new oar didn't seem too daunting and we headed ashore. In ten minutes we had a branch and were whittling a spot in it with a rock for the oar lock. My kid felt like Bear Grylls and was having a great time. Dad was a touch more stressed than that until we got back up through the fast water and into the main lake. Of course, before we headed back we figured might as well fish the spot. It was pretty productive, too. The cabin itself was fantastic. Three miles from any privately held cabins (all vacant) and twelve miles to the lodge. *Quiet* doesn't even begin to describe it. The were two eagles hanging about and they happily fed on fish carcasses that we tossed up on a rocky point*. There were also moose tracks though we never saw one, loons and beaver. Comfortable, great view of the lake, well protected docks in the bay, a hand pump for water and a hot shower when the lake was too cold. I'll be headed back next year if I can swing it. * not at all sure about the legality of that"

With your son on the trip, it must have been a special time for yourself as well. I smiled when reading the word QUIET.....I think it can be hard for people, in general, to understand what that really means. PjShorthorn"
3138561,kzoofisher,2014-08-31 07:14:00,5144,"Thanks, My work is mostly industrial process heating and cooling so honest to god quiet is a rare commodity for me. Shutting down the cell at the Soo is a real treat, too. I was pretty pleased that we managed the cold front as well as we did, especially my son. Water temps dropped from 70-71 to 63-64 and the fish wanted presentations that were incredibly slow. Basically we went from hopping and swimming jigs to just dragging them on the bottom. The bites, if you can call them that, weren't even taps most of the time. A little bit of added weight like you were hung in some weeds and there was a fish. Took the kid a few ""doh!""'s and he got right with the program. Vertical jigging was easiest for him, especially in the wind, and I have to say it was kind of a relief to me when that was the presentation that worked best on a spot. We took a flat of worms which turned out to be about twice as many as we needed for five guys. It was $60, not bad, though the lodge was only charging $2.50/doz. I think next year I won't bother with transporting from home. I'm excited to have learned a bit of the lake and put that knowledge to good use next year."

We had miserable weather rained every day water temps dropped to 63. Caught lots of walleye and smallmouth when we were targeting them. Trolling to locate fish and then jigging Fuzzy Grubs with leeches was the trick. Also caught lots of good 15 to 20"" walleye casting crank baits against deep shorelines early and late in the day. Biggest walleye a measured 30"" biggest smallmouth 19.5"". Caught a few 20"" pike. Never fished Nicholson Bay nor the lake west of there. Did go to the falls and marked areas for next year to fish. Already booked for 10 days next summer. Well run Camp with great hosts!!!"
3141617,kzoofisher,2014-09-01 16:06:00,5144,"I really enjoyed it also. The outpost is very private, not quite a fly in but, my son and I stayed a week for $375.00 plus food and gas and bait which was another $300 or so. Hard to beat that. Even if we went just the two of us I could keep the trip under $1800 including boat rental, food, gas and bait, though that's getting close enough to fly in prices that I'd really have to weigh my options. Also pretty darn good fishing for a drive in and it's a day closer than the lakes north of MN or NY."
