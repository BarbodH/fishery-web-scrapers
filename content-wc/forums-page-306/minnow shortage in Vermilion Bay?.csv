3139425,bobbylfishermon,2014-08-31 14:27:00,241,"I stopped by Bobby's Corner in Vermilion Bay, On. last week to get some minnows and got 4 doz., they were all 5-6 in. long and was told they no longer sort minnows by size. I talked to my camp owner and was told they no longer give camp discounts either!!! Is there a minnow shortage around V-bay or what's going on? It's pretty unrealistic to try and shove HUGE minnows down eater walleyes throats in 20ft., 70 degree water and pay a premium for them, I'll fillet the minnows next time. Next year , I'll bring salted minnows !!"
3139465,Blue Lk,2014-08-31 14:48:00,269,"I got minnows there about a week ago,they were regular sized (3-3 1/2 in)on average,didn't hear about the no sorting stuff.Eagle Junction 10 mins east of V-Bay is also a good spot for bait."
3140433,plumberjoe,2014-09-01 06:12:00,54,I just got back from Canyon Lake just north of Vermilion Bay no minnow shortage there as a matter of fact camp owner commented that there supplier had a surplus and was giving them a deal. We paid 4.25 a dozen for small fatheads.
3140665,bobbylfishermon,2014-09-01 08:16:00,241,"Hey Blue lake and Plumberjoe, thanks for the info, maybe I just hit them at the wrong time or something. I do know the owner went in to Bobby's on Wed. and supposedly cleaned them out, was told they would be out of minnows till Sat. , and the minnows he got were 40doz. 5-6 inchers. Is there some politics going on, if so, it's Eagle Junction for bait! Thanks again.."
3140737,packpro,2014-09-01 08:41:00,695,"This goes back to our 2013 trip. Our camp was getting minnows- no problems, however the price escalated to $4.50-$5.00 doz. Strictly supply and demand. He showed us the invoice from the supplier. They were very inflexible having the upper hand- take it leave it attitude with no completion at the time. Many of the local guides were telling tales of setting their traps to offset the price/attitude, only to find them destroyed when checking. Also, a tale of a confrontation at trap lake. Lots of camp owners were unhappy, but also stuck. They were sorted though-small-big. At time though they had to take what was available or nothing. Live bait still out fishes artificials for our group. However, we can catch enough either way. Their will be more experimenting going on in the future, and once we have reached a limit, the fellas are declaring a full day of nothing but artificials so we can start comparing notes. I think it is going to trend this way, especially if a new supplier doesn't force some competition. Sounds like their is a client base available."
3140809,v-bay gord,2014-09-01 09:10:00,3168,"There are two suppliers in Vermilion Bay.....one supplies Bobby's,....the other supplies Eagle Junction (plus other bait shops including Kenora). The latter has more volume and is better able to meet demand. Bottom line there is competition."
3140913,prov1800,2014-09-01 09:41:00,5010,"Eagle junction is supplied by clarkes, they also have there minnow business up on cedar lake at clarkes northern lights camp."
3140921,pale ryder,2014-09-01 09:42:00,1937,"When the demand for anything exceeds the supply either the price goes up, causing people to ration themselves, or some people can't get any at all.I know one of the suppliers there and he had to buy a license to trap minnows. That license gives him exclusive rights trap in his area. So if so local guide was trapping on a lake licensed to someone else, the guide was breaking the law."
3141121,v-bay gord,2014-09-01 10:48:00,3168,The local person can trap for his own personal use......but can't be selling it to clients (or including it in his package price). The exclusive trapping rights may be for commercial purposes but the license doesn't allow you to keep local residents from trapping minnows on Crown land for their own use......at least that is my understanding.
3141169,packpro,2014-09-01 11:06:00,695,"Not familiar with all the all the laws, but the two guides were also native citizens."
