3140969,MikeinMN,2014-09-01 10:02:00,190,"Stayed for a week at Gawleys Little Beaver 7 miles south of Ear Falls on 105. The weather was bad and the fishing good. Daytime high temps from 56-84 F and nighttime lows were 43-60 F. Lots of wind and some rain most days. Almost all good fishing in or near MacKenzie Bay. Almost all good fishing with jigs/live bait. Could not get bouncers or plugs to go, and normally I am able to catch fish trolling on this lake. Surface water temps from 66-69 F. Water levels seemed pretty normal to me. Preferred walleye depth seemed to be 20-21' for the whole week. We caught more incidental pike and smallmouth than any previous trip to Lac Seul. Pike to 37"" and smallmouth to 15"". 105 does have some culvert repair going on right now. The replaced culvert spots are dirt/gravel and some are rough. Came up through International Falls, 502 to 17 to 105, no construction other than the culverts and the roads are better than ever. Customs also was good for us with no delays either direction. Doug and Gayle Gawley were great hosts. Doug was able to fix the captain's chair in my boat well enough to get me through the trip after it broke in some rough water. Clean camp (probably the cleanest fish cleaning house I've ever been in), free ice, plenty of minnows (at $5.00/dozen), always a great place to stay."
