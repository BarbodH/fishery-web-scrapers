Biggest pike was 40 on a jig no leader, biggest eye was 23. Absolutely fantastic fishing all day every day. One day each guy caught over 100 eyes before dinner. If you go, contact me for specific info"

2959226,oleJoe,2014-07-02 11:14:00,114,Well that sure sounds like they were biting. I know a 7 day trip is short so a 4 dayer you don't even need to bring a change of clothes. Glad to enjoyed it.
