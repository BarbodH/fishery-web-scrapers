3128409,rockape,2014-08-27 11:37:00,215,"We were up there in June after all the rain. Rough ride in with a ProV1900, but totally doable. Ray had the road graded while we were there and it was almost totally smooth the whole way. You will be fine."
3132313,Glenman12,2014-08-28 19:47:00,762,been up Red Lake Rd over 30 times on our way to Cedar Lake Lodge and have never seen the sign for this public launch..I know where the launch is next to Sawmill Bay but never knew how to get there..
3132577,prov1800,2014-08-28 20:40:00,5010,Used to be atrux rd.next right past camp robinson.signs been there for thirty years.but rough landing.need a 4x4 to pull a bigger boat out.but its doable.
3132681,bigwillies,2014-08-28 21:05:00,515,u r right.sign is different now but never paid attention to what it is now.old frank attrux was a cranky ol bugger.heard he moved out.
3133441,bigwillies,2014-08-29 07:09:00,515,guess thats why they changed the name of the road.i can be pretty perceptive sometimes
3124649,eyeboom,2014-08-26 07:27:00,940,Anyone pull their own boat to Cedar Point Resort on Cedar Lake Ontario? The last 5.5 miles on an old logging road has me concerned for my 621 Ranger. Thanks in advance Phil
3125457,bigwillies,2014-08-26 11:29:00,515,don't blame u.if u have someone to drive your truck u can put in at the public launch.it's just past camp robinson rd.only a few hundred yards off the highway.
3126065,ftfarms,2014-08-26 14:29:00,444,That might be a good ideal and you can check the road out with your empty trailer I've never had a proplem pulling my boat up it we just go slow.
3126297,prov1800,2014-08-26 15:50:00,5010,Couple of spots are rougher than others.just take your time its only five miles.your on a holiday enjoy the veiw.the public landing sucks.
3126361,bigwillies,2014-08-26 16:43:00,515,you pull your boat with a minivan?
3126601,prov1800,2014-08-26 17:56:00,5010,No.but lots of mini vans go up and down that road.i go visit freinds there and take my wives fusion.whats your point.
3126713,eyeboom,2014-08-26 18:29:00,940,Prov1800. You have mail
3126761,Rich B,2014-08-26 18:42:00,1081,"Phil,Was just up at CPR two weeks ago, and we pulled up my brother's Pro-V 1800 Lund OK into camp....took our time on their camp road (like 5 mph in a few spots) and you're not going to go more than 10 - 15 mph anyway on that road, though like ProV1800 said, take your time going in as you are ""on Holiday"".I've pulled my Lund Pro-V 1900 into camp two years ago, though no doubt your 621 is a heavier rig....take your time and you'll be fine.....the main roads heading north are all good. The camp docks are almost new, and you'll like the layout of the camp. Ray and Kathi are fine folks, and work hard at keeping a very clean camp. with nice older cabins....great decks overlooking the lake.Good luck at Cedar.....wishing I was up back up there now...Faith, Family, Friends.....and Fishing,Rich B"
3127241,bigwillies,2014-08-26 21:00:00,515,point is anybody with a truck can put a boat in at the landing.guys put big rigs in there all the time.including pontoon boats
3128025,eyeboom,2014-08-27 08:43:00,940,"Thanks Rich B. We were actually there last week and stayed at Cedar Lake Lodge on the island and took my friends 621. We used the ramp and it is very shallow so it took a little extra time to unload and load. We went by Cedar Point Resort and it looked nice. Just looking for alternatives for when we go back again. Found better fishing on the east portion of the lake with fish up to 26"". We also caught our limit of nice crappie and a few jumbo perch. Kept a few 16"" walleye for eating while we were there and released the rest. Phil"
