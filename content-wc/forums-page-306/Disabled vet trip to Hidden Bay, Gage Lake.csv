3135225,reconssd,2014-08-29 18:31:00,147,"Joe - glad to hear the trip was a success. Big thank you to Hidden Bay and you for making this happen. As for the vets, I know they will never forget their time in the Canadian wilderness. Are there plans to make this an annual event? Semper Fi!"
3135369,tooski,2014-08-29 19:25:00,393,"Semper Fi, Two of the six were Marines incidentally. Wayne, the disabled vet from the Sandusky Soldiers and Sailors home and Brad Rauscher who assisted me on the trip.... Yes they had a great time. Wayne still calls me every other day or so and Ronnie, the blind vet, is bringing his family over to my home for a Labor Day cookout. Someone asked me right after the trip if I would do it again and I said probably not. It was a little more difficult than we envisioned. However a week after we returned we had a post trip party to look at pix and tell stories. We all agreed that if possible we would try again next year. So hopefully yes, it is in the works. Thanks, Joe T"

Of all the fishing memories you probably have, this trip will be especially remembered the rest of your life. You have so helped make memories for the folks who went with. To them, you will always be that special person, just slightly under the angels. Well done! Bill"
3136425,tooski,2014-08-30 08:41:00,393,"Thanks Bill, I don't know about the ""under the angels"" thing unless you mean WAAAY under. Incidentally this is the first trip that I have not taken your book for leisure reading time. I kinda knew there wouldn't be much of that....."
3086521,tooski,2014-08-13 14:31:00,393,"If a blind guy can catch a 41"" pike.... The staff at Hidden Bay were outstanding to the vets. Upon our arrival they had purchased a large banner welcoming the vets. When we returned from Gage they had framed quality photos for the entire group of our pix in front of the banner. Not to mention free t-shirts for all 6 of us. Outstanding folks.... My apology to all that contributed lures. My intention was to have each vet spend a little time with every contributors lures. Unfortunately, they had other plans. Ronnie ( blind vet) caught fish after fish with a slow death rig and did not want to try anything else. "" Why change when I'm catching fish?"" I couldn't argue his point. He even used the slow death when anchored. Slow lift and drop. He had a remarkable touch and probably outfished everyone else.... I spent most days with the other vet, Wayne. He had some physical problems and was only comfortable trolling a jig, minnow, white twister combo. Again, he was catching lots of fish and did not want to change. Ronnie not only caught the most fish, he caught the largest.... a 41"" pike. That was fun watching him bring her in. His boat had forgotten a large net so I went over and landed her by hyand. A quick measurement and a photo holding it in front of Ronnie and she was back in the lake. My friend Brad ( marine which explains a lot) was so excited he inadvertently turned his camera OFF for the photo... So no pix of Ronnie's nice fish.. We had some issues during the 22 hour drive, it was hard on the two disabled vets, but they have called me daily since the trip thanking me for the great time they said they had. Ronnie's guide dog is a golden/ yellow lab cross and she may have enjoyed the trip more than anyone... Some pix--"
3086633,tooski,2014-08-13 14:56:00,393,Here are the pix..
3086649,tooski,2014-08-13 15:01:00,393,and a few more
3086657,tooski,2014-08-13 15:04:00,393,"OK- I give up, the photos I chose were not the ones that downloaded. You get the idea anyhow. Maybe I'll try again later."
3086769,Pikeslayer8,2014-08-13 15:50:00,1460,Well done Tooski! Big giant tip of my cap to you sir for making this happen and another big giant tip of my cap to our veterans.
3086825,JAY221,2014-08-13 16:05:00,877,"I am sure you all had a great time regardless of how the pictures are acting up on you! As for not getting pictures of the big one I just want to know if I can use that line myself sometime? Like I haven't already! Thanks to all who made this happen & special thanks to the Veterans. Later, Jay"
3087609,phishfearme,2014-08-13 20:46:00,1242,way to go Joe - you did good! and sounds like a heap of thanks should be sent to the Hidden Bay folks also!! I do not think anyone who contributed lures regrets doing so - as long as the vets were aware of the response of the guys on this board then that would be enough. thanks for your efforts. phish
3088073,MrSimon,2014-08-14 06:28:00,922,"Well done!! Out of curiosity .... was the guide dog able to go ""off duty"" and play like a regular dog, or did it stay focused on its job the whole time?"
3088609,Larry S,2014-08-14 08:52:00,665,"Congradulations Joe ,on making this a Great Trip for the Vets. You are an Wonderful Person who Iam proud to know and call A Vietnam Brother and Friend Following your example I'm going to try and put a vets trip together out here in Nevada. Hopefully one of these years we can get together on a trip or go to a Bears--Browns game Take Care Larry S"
3088801,tooski,2014-08-14 09:28:00,393,"Simon, That's a good question. When Ronnie napped in the afternoon we did a little horseplay with ""Peaches"". He pretty much kept her in check the rest of the time and I'm guessing that's part of the training. She did almost walk him into the lake off the dock once though."
