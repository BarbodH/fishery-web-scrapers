3080321,btmbncr,2014-08-11 18:36:00,492,"Fished a hump surrounded by 70 ft of water.Hump topped out at 13.7 ft.The hump was loaded with fish.We fished it all day.Had some 25 inch walleyes,lots of 17 to 17 3/4 in eaters and lots of slots and ""overs"".Leeches were the hot bait.My wife and I went through over a pound of leeches.I couldn't buy a fish on crawlers.Just used a glow bead and a number 4 hook.My wife used a Hot Pink bead and a number 4 hook.We had lots of doubles.Most of the fish came from 15 to 18 feet of water on the hump.My wife was bragging about catching three walleyes off the same leech.My dog went nuts in the boat with all the walleyes to lick(she sneaks in an occasional nip). Can hardly wait until the morning to see where the fish are tomorrow.Cold Kokanee is callingBill"
3080377,bigtimeelectric,2014-08-11 18:53:00,174,"Bill, outstanding that sounds like a **** of a lot fun. Wow keep the reports coming!!!!!Also you never said what day you are leaving?"
3080665,Pooch,2014-08-11 20:32:00,4619,"Bill, I'd appreciate it if you left a few for our Labor Day group in a few weeks!Pooch"
3081025,btmbncr,2014-08-12 05:04:00,492,"PoochWe kept three walleyes for supper.The rest we just trained, exercised and released.Bill"
3081057,Pooch,2014-08-12 05:50:00,4619,"We just got home from fifteen days on Lake Savant and everyone in our group commented on how ""fat"" all the walleye are this year. Appears to be much more forage / baitfish this year and the walleye are gorging themselves.Most of these fish were really firm and anything over about twenty one inches was hard to pick up with one hand. And I've got good sized hands!Did you or others notice the same thing on LS or other lakes this year?Pooch"
3081193,Mike Kansas,2014-08-12 07:11:00,1463,"Bill, Sounds like you are having a great time. Keep putting those hogs in the boat and make sure and send me the GPS numbers. Have you been fishing any of the spots I marked for you in Aldous? Mike Kansas"
3082849,btmbncr,2014-08-12 15:45:00,492,"Mike KansasYes we looked at 5 spots you suggested and fished three(saw fish and or baitfish on them) One spot had big fish on it and the other two had eaters and slots,lots of them.The big problem with running to Aldous from the public ramp is gas.With three in my boat the trip up to Aldous and back burned $133.00 in gas.That's two fat guys and my wife and our dog.We were on fumes when we put it on the trailer.Spots south of Manitoba and in Mc Kenzie Bay have been real good to us at times. We didn't fish today Doug Gawley said watch out for the wind today so we hung around camp.Sure enough it blew hard out of the north.White caps on the bay.Picked blueberries and went out to Anderson's Manitou Falls Camp to check it out.Bill"
3084033,fleegs,2014-08-12 21:29:00,8,"I'm heading up for the first time in a few weeks. Really excited, my first Canada trip. Any tips on what to bring/not bring, etc?"
3087257,btmbncr,2014-08-13 18:55:00,492,"fleegslots of money LOLSeriously we have been catching most of our fish on bottom bouncers and spinners with leeches.Small silver blades and red,orange,chartruese,hot pink and glo beads.Sometimes just a bouncer,bead and hook.Bill"
3087561,fleegs,2014-08-13 20:30:00,8,"I've been told money, lol. We're planning on jigging mostly. I might throw some crank baits or spinners off the docks in the evening to see what happens. Anybody use the jig heads with the spinners on them?"
