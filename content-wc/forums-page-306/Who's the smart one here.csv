3131081,bigwalleye1,2014-08-28 12:59:00,2632,You are. He'll never be able to convince a significant other he NEEDS all that stuff.
3131097,srk-low,2014-08-28 13:02:00,78,I didn't look at it that way. I like your perspective.
3131257,JayM5209,2014-08-28 13:58:00,1050,"Your son!! Congratulations to him.P.S. I'm constantly amazed at how all the electronics, excess h.p., high tech line, boat full of rods and tackle boxes, boat we're afraid of getting fish slime or a scratch on, etc., get in the way of people catching fish.Of course, JMHO . . . . . but I'm seriously considering a week in NW Ontario the way we did it 30 years ago - the beat up 14' boat, my 1968 6 hp Merc 60, two rods, one small tackle box, a thermos of coffee, a couple cigars. Chances are at least even that the walleyes for supper would come as quickly and taste just a good as they would if I took all the stuff."
3131441,Lovetofish,2014-08-28 15:08:00,458,Great post. My most memorial days of Canada fishing are the days we portaged fishing with my wife and two kids in 14' leaky boat powered by my 3 hp Merc.
3131449,Juls,2014-08-28 15:09:00,13414,Wow! Congrats to your son!
3131969,pjshorthorn,2014-08-28 17:54:00,5654,"Both of you share equal amounts of ""smartness"" !!! You for instilling the opportunity and desire in your son to chase a BIG fish without you along. Your son for remembering who took him fishing as a ""little jiffer "" so he could catch that BIG fish. PjShorthorn"
