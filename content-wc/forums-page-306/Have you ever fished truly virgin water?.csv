My uncle and I took the opportunity, it was one of the best days of fishing I have ever had. The lake was Setting Net. A few years later we went back to Way North and took the day fly-in trip to Setting Net, it was still good, but nothing like that first time."
3092241,Mike Kansas,2014-08-15 10:35:00,1463,"In 1960 my Dad, my Uncle and I went to the Northwest Terriority on a trip. The guy who owned the resort had been to school with my uncle and they were good friends. The owner asked us to go with him to a lake that he wanted to expand his operation to and we flew in on his plane to it. He had already flown in two boats. We fished it for the day and as one would expect you could catch fish on anything. We used mostly homemade hair jigs and casted some spoons. It was an awesome experience especially for a 15 yr old boy which was me. Walleye, Pike and Lakers would almost jump in the boat. I think even wallydave could have caught fish there (just kidding Dave) Mike Kansas"
3092441,phishfearme,2014-08-15 11:34:00,1242,"knut - what year did you fly into setting net? we were at way north in early july 1996 and were flown into setting net twice during our week there. a young pilot named Ian flew us in. we were certainly among the first to go there from way north and as you say, it was incredible - almost too easy - my boat partner and I got close to 200 walleye in the 5 hours we were there. another group found a pike heaven in one of the bays. phish"

3084841,MrSimon,2014-08-13 07:38:00,922,"Obviously Canada offers amazing fishing and a lot of the places don't get a lot of pressure. But have you ever fished somewhere that truly receives ZERO fishing pressure? I've done it twice in my life. When I was young, my grandfather took us to Klotz lake. His buddy had a private float plane up there and flew us back into some un-charted lakes. These lakes had no roads and no cabins. We fished out of an inflatable boat with a tiny little outboard. We used a crude drop-shot style rig with pike belly strips and just drifted past points. It was as simple as it gets. No electronics, no GPS, no maps ... just a hook and a piece of bait. Honestly, it was like something out of a dream. There were countless times when all four people in the boat would have a fish on at the same time. Truly non-stop action. The second time was a few years ago when we rented a boat-in outpost and then hiked even further back into a bush lake. This particular lake actually does get some pressure, but its a big lake and maybe sees a couple dozen boats per year. It sits empty most days. Its a smallmouth lake and I've never seem more aggressive and willing brown bass anywhere. How about you guys?"

3085697,Mike Borger,2014-08-13 11:09:00,1554,"Lots of times paddling over the years I fished smallish lakes waaay off the beaten track. Lakes too small to land a plane in and not part of any canoe route. Some were amazing, some were fishless.Also most of the northern rivers I paddled were more or less virgin. I remember paddling the Ogoki years back and seeing a large shallow pool below a small falls that had thousands of walleyes in it. You could actually see hundreds of backs and dorsal fins sticking out of the water, it was insane.Have a great opportunity to fish a huge lake in N/W ON next year that's never had a camp on it and according to the person I spoke with has never seen any native pressure either. The guy just called me this morning actually, he wants to construct this new camp and asked me if I'd like to fish it for him. Tough job but someone has to do it."
3086089,vteye,2014-08-13 12:25:00,812,"I have been able to fish virgin rivers in Alaska. AK rivers cleanse themselves with the normal high water of springand low levels of summer time resulting in waters that appear to havenever been fished. I've been down a 40 mile stretch of river twice andnever saw sign of human activity. Combined with bird, wildlife, 10 species of game fish, I look forward to going back. I also did a boat in drop off char fishing trip on Baffin Island 75 milesfrom a village."
3086225,phishfearme,2014-08-13 13:06:00,1242,I started a thread some time ago about this and your other thread (fly in lake pressure). see:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...light=recovery phish
3088241,nitrodude,2014-08-14 07:27:00,60,"Many times I've fished virgin waters with friends or my oldest son way out into the bush on our properties in N FL. The fishing is outstanding without an unnatural sound to be heard except for an occasional high altitude airplane. Bass, crappie, and bream fishing almost too unbelievable to describe, only bested by the incredible wildlife on the banks and seen while trekking into and out of the bush. Other than the yearly Canada trip, it is the fishing that gets my heart pounding while anxiously anticipating the next adventure."
3090145,Fisherman Ted,2014-08-14 15:21:00,461,"When I was a teenager I took a 1,400 mile canoe trip for 2 months up into the arctic circle. We carried food and supplies with us for 9 weeks, portaged upwards of 3 miles at a time and saw not another living being the entire time. Suffice to say we saw waters I doubt had never been touched. few if any camping spots, non-existent trails and some of the prettiest country in the world. The fishing was unreal to say the least. 40 inch pike at will, lakers, walleye, smallies. Fish that I doubt had ever seen a lure. Every cast often times. Big, big fish. I have fished all over Canada and now own a lodge and it was that trip that solidified my love for this wonderful country up here. -FT"
3091105,Bill Krejca,2014-08-14 21:13:00,6107,I have a fishing buddy who says he doesn't think he was ever anywhere where someone hadn't already been there before him. Bill
3091905,Aaron-IN,2014-08-15 08:48:00,500,"When I was a kid Northwest Flying Service dropped my dad, grandpa and I into a lake they were just wanting to figure out if it had anything in it fishing wise, it was a smaller lake as lakes go up there and just big enough to land a float plane. This was back in the day when they just strapped a boat on the plane and flew the boat and passengers in. I can't even describe the Pike fishing we experienced, it was absolutely unbelievable."
3091913,phishfearme,2014-08-15 08:49:00,1242,"I think your friend is correct - one other outfitter we've used also told me that essentially every fishable lake in Ontario has had some sort of cabin on it - either trapper, native, private or commercial. but for fishing purposes, I think if a lake had been un-fished for maybe 10 years or so it will respond as if ""virgin"". I've been fortunate enough to experience a number of these - amazing. phish"
