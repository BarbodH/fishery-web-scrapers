3134249,Bakefish,2014-08-29 10:45:00,1077,"If sonar acts like radar, and I believe it does, the closer the target the smaller the return. Far target = bigger return. 94 feet is pretty deep. I'd say whitefish."
3134345,JDP,2014-08-29 11:25:00,1457,"It would be interesting to drop say a 24"" and 30"" long targets in similar depths and see what they look like versus these arcs..."
3135121,maddogg,2014-08-29 17:59:00,178,"Yup whitefish, I had the same thing a few years back. I tried a jig with no luck. Caught a few with a small castmaster tipped with a small piece of crawler. Both had white grubs in their meat.I fed them to the eagles."
3135305,Aspencreek,2014-08-29 18:55:00,2911,"hat made me think whitefish was, I had a similar hit on my graph a few years ago. Immediately dropped a jig & crawler and waited, and waited, etc, etc. Finally got a hit only to bring up a 24"" whitefish that decided to spew from both ends as soon as it hit the net. I figured it was because I brought it up from such a deep hole. It too was full of worms and fed it to the gulls."
3137073,Nosebleed,2014-08-30 12:51:00,253,Thanks for all the replies. Sounds like the consensus is whitefish. I think they're in the lake but I've never seen or caught one. A jigging spoon was something I thought about trying but that's not in my pike arsenal. Maybe I'll give it a shot next year to try and confirm. I've never heard that a deeper return = a larger return. Can someone confirm that's true. I always assumed the opposite was true. But I don't know obviously.
3132201,Nosebleed,2014-08-28 19:19:00,253,"I was at a relatively big shield lake in the cranberry portage manitoba area. This lake is fairly shallow pike lake the vast majority of the lake is under 40' deep with just a few small holes that dive to 100'. So I was driving over on the way to another pike spot and saw these giants just piled in there. What's your best guess on what it is? Lake trout was my guess, but I don't know where to begin catching them. But the way they were piled up I thought a guy should try to catch. We Jigged twister tails, rabbit hair jigs and swimbaits but no bites....."
3132305,Live to jig,2014-08-28 19:45:00,159,"My guess is they could very easy be big Pike, the big guys go deep in the summer with the trout."
3132473,v-bay gord,2014-08-28 20:22:00,3168,whitefish is my guess........
3132745,Aspencreek,2014-08-28 21:19:00,2911,"Yup, that is my guess too!"
3133225,fishron,2014-08-29 05:51:00,317,"Your gonna need a bigger boat. Seriously, I've seen a screen like that many times in the deep section of Cabonga Reservoir. Some say whitefish but others that I agree with because of the size of the arcs say lake trout. Always see it at over 100 ft. and generally the feeding fish are around 60."
3133265,prov1800,2014-08-29 06:01:00,5010,What kind of fish are in that lake.my guess is with gord.been seeing those arches in eagle lake all summer and they are definitely wh itefish.
3133313,SinOrSwim,2014-08-29 06:20:00,1528,"So, if they are whitefish what do you use to target them?"
3133465,Golden Eagle,2014-08-29 07:12:00,2642,Also thinking they are whitefish. Pike eat them to grow big and fat.
3133521,v-bay gord,2014-08-29 07:24:00,3168,"I've caught them vertical jigging with small heavy spoons such as a Little Cleo, Krocodiles or Sonars.........a jig and minnow would likely work too. They most often hit the bait when it's fluttering on the drop.......not when you jig it up.........so you need to be ready to set the hook when you feel the tell tale ""bump""....."
3134129,packpro,2014-08-29 10:07:00,695,"For the new guys joining our group we put together a Virtual Tackle Box. We send it out with weekly countdown dates to departure. The mails go out about two weeks before the big spring tackle sales. That way the newbies can gear up and not over gear. This is a picture of what we suggest for Lake Trout on our destination Lake-Big Canon. If I were to add anything I would add the Little Cleo and Krocodile. We try to keep the tackle to a minimum so what is pictured has worked for us over a 17 year period. At first, the Strata Spoon was the go to. Great success vertical jigging in 60' It was real important to pound the bottom, sort of like jigging on steroids. When we inspected what they were eating, the forage looked just like the shape/color of that spoon. In the last ten years we have switched over to the heavy white jigging head with a long white twister tail. We also add dead minnows 1 or 2. We use 1 oz and slow drift with motor corrections the target area. Same technique, pound the bottom. 45'-60' FOW-for us. The same set up will catch the occasional white fish as well. It seems to be the easiest way to target them that deep without any sophisticated gear or special rods. We use our walleye spinning Med action and when the bite turns on its a blast. Also, very tasty if eaten fresh. Different story in the spring when they are shallow, but for the depth you show this worth a try without a huge investment in special gear."
