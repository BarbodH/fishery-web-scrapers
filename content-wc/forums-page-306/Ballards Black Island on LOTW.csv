3133105,Obabikon,2014-08-29 04:53:00,2370,"First off... Reuben Gibbons is their head guide. One of the many amazing fishermen on this lake. Tell him to try to book him for a day. I've known him for most of my life, and his brother and cousin both work full time here. If he's on a budget, and struggling, he can always swing by my place (Obabikon) and I will happily mark up a map. Crappies and walleye are usually awesome that time of year. Let him know he's in for a great trip!"
3133657,LOW1,2014-08-29 08:14:00,2828,Perhaps there are not many people who would offer to help a customer of a competitor? A very classy response!
3133681,1700SS,2014-08-29 08:22:00,104,"+1 to LOW1 response.Jared, has the water temp started to fall yet?"
3138065,Obabikon,2014-08-30 21:23:00,2370,"Water temps started dropping this week, but most temps are still around 70. Went out today and caught everything.... lots of walleye, crappie, perch and northern!"
