3113625,wallydave,2014-08-22 04:15:00,2151,"I can relate to looking for the desire for new lakes to fish! But limiting your trips to houseboats seems llike your options are reduced. Try the search function, check with your group concerning drive/boat and flyin options! Good luck!"
3113705,bigtimeelectric,2014-08-22 05:52:00,174,"Benson, have you been using lac Seoul floating lodges or white wing? I find it hard to believe fishing has gotten worse with all the good reports I have been hearing. Whichever one you go with maybe switch to the other side of lac Seoul for a year. As far as other houseboat destinations I don't know of any others besides lotw or rainy. It would be awesome if red lake had houseboats. Good luck sailor"
3118009,Aspencreek,2014-08-23 21:12:00,2911,"If your success level on LS has been going down each year, might I suggest some introspection. It may be you or your group that needs to change. If you are going up every year at the same time, you CANNOT expect the same conditions every time. Weather changes, water levels, water temps, forage changes, these are all conditions YOU have to make changes too. Changing tactics, moving to different spots during the day, different depths, different bait. My boat partner and I will change tactics 4-5 times in a day, look for warmer/cooler water, look for wind blown points or sheltered points. Find the mid-lake humps with steep drops, etc. etc. No offence meant here, but that's why it's called ""fishing"", not ""catching""!"
3118305,Pooch,2014-08-24 06:13:00,4619,"We used to switch lakes every few years. Kind of got tired of always learning a new lake though. Fishing always ended up being about the same. We've now settled on two lakes that fish totally different from each other.Now we change it up by fishing different parts of the lakes AND trying new ways of fishing. Jig and minnow all day long is a bore. Trolling all day long is a bore. etc. etc..Earlier this year LS was kicking my arss and teaching me humility. Just for anything different I started popping a 3/8 ounce jig topped with a large plastic minnow along back trolling. Where the fish ignored everything else (same spot within minutes) they jumped all over this setup. Used it the rest of our trips with great success and it spiced up all of the ""old spots"" that I was days before bored with.I've learned over the years that it usually ain't the fishing, it's the fisherman......Don't give up a trip you like searching for something better. Try a different part of the lake or rediscover the same area you are already familiar with. The fish are usually ""there"", it's our challenge to figure out what it is they are wanting at any given moment and that can really be elusive.Don't ever fish memories. You'll be disappointed a lot.Good luckPooch"
3118937,Aspencreek,2014-08-24 11:16:00,2911,"Pooch has hit it right on the head.......While my boat will struggle, another in our group will be hitting them hard, and the next day all that will switch. Why?....beats me! But nothing surprises me anymore. While at the cabin one night a ""newbie"" to the group decided he was going to rig a floating rapala behind a bottom bouncer because he was sick of digging in the minnow bucket, he used the same set up all day the next day and out fished us all!! the next day a northern took his rig, switched to a different color, and the results were totally different. You just never know.. last trip up the biggest fish for the week was caught on a floating jig with a split shot pinned about 2' above it with a leech. Thrown off shore during shore lunch, like I said, you never know what will happen. The only thing in fishing that is a certainty ""change""."
3123193,mickr,2014-08-25 18:03:00,74,that's one of my go to set ups
3123225,Aspencreek,2014-08-25 18:21:00,2911,"I rigged that up for my grandson a few years back because he kept getting snagged with a lead head jig, it worked like a champ that day and now....every shore lunch, and still works...who needs a boat!!"
3127865,Moosebunk,2014-08-27 07:26:00,211,"Benson... The fishing conditions and weather this summer in Ontario were quite off the norm from previous years. Fishing I think overall has been a little tougher this colder, wet summer. Anyways, if it's your houseboat I can't help ya. But if you're looking for a houseboat/fishing option to see some of the most beautiful and remote big lake country and sample great fishing... check these guys out. This is one I'd like to try some day.http://www.nighthawkcharters.ca/new_page_3.htm"
