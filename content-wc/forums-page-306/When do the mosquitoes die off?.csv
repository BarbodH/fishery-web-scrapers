3124977,deadhead1,2014-08-26 08:27:00,193,Good to hear that my plan worked. Now I hope the wind doesn't change to east!
3126321,Skywagon,2014-08-26 16:26:00,1106,"Supposed to get down to 6c (43f) tonight, they will at least have to work at it to get through two layers of clothing."
3109409,Bill Krejca,2014-08-20 18:33:00,6107,"Generally in most years mid-September will be fairly free. Those present in early evening are usually not a nuisance as the temperature drops. In those years with a warmer fall, there will be more. No matter what the weather or other conditions, go anyway!! This the best time of the year to enjoy the North. The fishing is also enjoyable! Bill"
3109465,oldccm,2014-08-20 18:47:00,109,Sept is when we switch from mosquito season to wasp season.
3109569,phishfearme,2014-08-20 19:05:00,1242,"mosquitos usually die off at the first hard frost - that is, well below freezing for an extended period of time. without the longer term freeze, they can hide under stuff and survive - but some night when the temp drops into the 20's for 3-4 hours or so will pretty much do it. phish"
3109817,Nimstug,2014-08-20 19:57:00,2605,Been to Canada ~10 times in September. Never saw a skeeto. You mileage may vary...
3110361,octanehi5,2014-08-21 04:34:00,1104,"Fall in the north will be in full swing, cold temps,warmer clothes, you will have your body well covered, 98% deet always does the trick"
3111809,Bad Santa,2014-08-21 10:38:00,100,"I've seen Skeets buzzing around during duck season (Nov), with ice on the pothole, if the air temp warms to +32 degrees"
3112441,castnblast,2014-08-21 14:43:00,111,in the winter... : )
3120601,deadhead1,2014-08-25 08:55:00,193,There is almost no bugs of any kind right now but I think it is more due to dry weather than time of year.
3122777,Skywagon,2014-08-25 16:25:00,1106,"Deadhead1, they must have all blown over to Dryden. Skeeters are still bad here, they should have slowed down by now."
3122897,jimirjr,2014-08-25 16:52:00,1149,x ^ 2 !
3108057,MrSimon,2014-08-20 12:08:00,922,"We talked to some guys who fished our fly-in lake the first week of August and had pretty bad mosquitoes. We will be going the first week of September. I'm guessing the cold nights (in the 40s and even 30s) for the past few weeks would have killed them off, but not sure. What do you guys think?"
3108145,Bakefish,2014-08-20 12:39:00,1077,Was fishing near Ear Falls the last week of September last year and there were mosquitoes present.
3108177,Larry Mac,2014-08-20 12:50:00,530,In January for about 2 weeks LOL just kiddingLarry Mac
3108209,bigwalleye1,2014-08-20 12:57:00,2632,"Actually, I think Larry Mac is pretty close. Canuk skeeters are a heartier bunch plus there's a lot more of em. I wouldn't depend on 40's taking the wind out from beneath their wings. I think you're gonna ned some leow freezing temps to really accomplish it where you'll notice a difference."
3108433,tjandy,2014-08-20 13:57:00,107,When is the first frost usually?
3108465,REG,2014-08-20 13:59:00,445,"While you could encounter a few here and there - I've been up in September a half dozen different years and will predict that there won't be enough to bother you. That's a great time of the year to fish - hungry fish, nice temps during the day, cool nights, and basically no bugs."
3108777,SinOrSwim,2014-08-20 15:07:00,1528,"We usually go in September and the last few years they have been bad in the evenings after dark. Daytime they are fine. But, it has also been crazy hot it seems the last few years we have gone. I can count on one hand the number of times I have put on long sleeves. Usually been shorts and tshirts and no fires in the cabin.So, prepare for both."
3108785,kliph,2014-08-20 15:10:00,2337,"I figure when the overnight temperatures drop below 55 degs, that stops most of them anyways."
3109185,uv2021,2014-08-20 17:28:00,48,"You know you are in trouble when they are out in the middle of the day,in the sun.We call those ""day-walkers"".A term from a vampire movie,where the vampires were not affected by sunlight.That was with air Ivanhoe.In august."
3109401,bigwillies,2014-08-20 18:33:00,515,don't think u r too far off!
