3138961,jkretch,2014-08-31 09:22:00,80,"Just returned from Sportsmens Bay. We were on a musky hunt and spent very little time walleye fishing. When we did fish them, very good action. Most on Lindy rig and minnow on main lake humps 25-30 feet. Lots of slot fish and bigger with plenty of eaters. Weather was challenging - lots of rain and wind. Musky action was sporadic. Had good action early in the week. Much of the lake appeared to be a ""muskie free"" zone mid week. After I personally did not have a follow on Wed or Thurs - Friday I caught three, lost one and ""blew"" a catch at another. Need to keep plugging away. John"
3141561,2746,2014-09-01 14:59:00,3206,Tell me/us how you do a boil. When I see folks on TV eating crawfish it looks great but the one time I tried them it wasn't a good experience. How do you cook them and then....how do you eat the buggers?
3141569,BreezyPoint,2014-09-01 15:08:00,1581,"We just boiled them until the shells turned pink. Nothing fancy. Eating was another story. We used 'nut pickers' and nut crackers. We cracked the shell with a nut cracker and used a picker to scrape the meat out. We then dipped the meat into melted butter. It did taste great, but required a lot of patience to get the meat.When we caught them on Lake of the Woods, most of them were about three inches long and had a good chunk of meat on them.Frank"

3079393,Bill Krejca,2014-08-11 14:04:00,6107,Nice fish! Bill
3085161,dave10,2014-08-13 08:44:00,342,"Thanks, Bill. I know that some folks don't think much of Eagle Lake as a walleye destination, and that is understandable. With the number of lodges on the lake, the hot spots do get their share of attention, and so it is not exactly a remote Canadian fishing experience. However, having gotten to know it well, and given the variety of fish there, we really enjoy the lake. The fishing has only gotten better over the 12 years we have fished it. I hope my boys continue the tradition with their friends and kids long after I'm gone. Dave"
3085897,fishinnut 3446,2014-08-13 11:40:00,638,"Well said Dave, We have been going to Eagle for about as many yrs. as you and find the fishing seams to get better and better as far as slot fish. And the Musky........ Holy seeing more and more pigs every yr."
3087113,bigwillies,2014-08-13 18:00:00,515,what do the rusty crayfish do to the ecosystem? never really heard of them
3087393,v-bay gord,2014-08-13 19:33:00,3168,They graze on and eradicate aquatic plants which are important to fish populations. Another reason why people should not transport live bait of any kind from one water body to another......and the reason for the controls at the border.
3088553,Opie,2014-08-14 08:39:00,129,Soon to be Sunday night Rusty Crawfish boils at Vermillion Bay Lodge???? What do you think Gord? Dean Thorn
3090777,v-bay gord,2014-08-14 19:00:00,3168,Crawfish and steak night....I like the concept. Not sure how to catch the buggers though....
3120921,Danbear,2014-08-25 10:33:00,72,"Got back Saturday from our annual trip to Birch Dale Lodge had the best fishing we have ever had. Everyone caught at least one walleye over 26"", we caught the most slot fish we ever have. The food and service at Birch Dale was great ! Thanks Marcel ! My hot bait was the new Sizmic minnow by Kalins in white. Lindy rigs and jigs with a minnow were also hot."
3121321,prov1800,2014-08-25 11:38:00,5010,Just throw a minnow trap in gord with some bait trap should load up quick.theres a lot of them in the bay areaas you can tell be the dimpinging weed beds.
3135145,BreezyPoint,2014-08-29 18:09:00,1581,Just put out a minnow trap with bread for bait. We caught hundreds on Lake of the Woods and had a great crawfish boil!Frank
3042377,Danbear,2014-07-29 12:45:00,72,Anyone have a recent Eagle Lake Reports? We are leaving in 17 days for Birch Dale Lodge on the West Arm. Thanks in advance.
3045521,dave10,2014-07-30 11:32:00,342,"Danbear - we just returned from Temple Bay Lodge on July 26th, and had our best year yet of the 7 times we've been on the lake. Over 100 fish in the boat five out of six days (once by lunchtime), and plenty of slots and over. Big walleye was 28 inches. Fewer northerns than in years past. The main basin below Temple Bay was producing, so no need for us to visit the Lone Pine area as we usually do. Windy days helped stack the fish on reefs and ridges. The water levels did not seem as high as I had read in earlier reports. Good luck and have fun - wish we were going back! Dave"
3045577,Danbear,2014-07-30 12:07:00,72,Thanks for the report Dave and that is one nice Walleye !
3045729,dave10,2014-07-30 12:50:00,342,"Thanks, Dan - rest assured she was successfully released. If you look carefully at my son's hand, we think it was his blood on the fish, since it was solidly mouth-hooked. Attached was the big northern of the trip, and a bonus muskie caught by my other son. As I said, wish we were heading back up . . ."
3069201,fishinnut 3446,2014-08-07 16:54:00,638,"Danbear, you have mail"
3069865,Mikeo2,2014-08-07 21:23:00,27,Curious on any reports from the vermilion Bay Area. How's the walleye and musky fishing been? Maybe even smallmouth?
3071721,v-bay gord,2014-08-08 13:42:00,3168,"Walleyes......12-30 feet....crawlers/bottom bouncers, Lindy rig/minnows....some crank-bait action as well. Morning & evening bites best with the high sun days we've been having. Musky....poor crop of weeds in the VBay vicinity but finding fish on them and rock structure...another thing in getting them to bite!"
3072513,jkretch,2014-08-08 19:43:00,80,"Gord. Seems like weed growth is generally declining in the past few years. Is that your opinion as well? If so, any Rusty Crayfish in lake? Appreciate your thoughts. John"
3073777,v-bay gord,2014-08-09 09:40:00,3168,"Still good weed growth in the central part of the lake, but VBay has lost a bunch......and yes there are rusty crayfish in the lake now."
3078193,Danbear,2014-08-11 08:05:00,72,Thanks Fishinut I owe you will send a report when we get back leaving on Friday. Take Care DanBear.
