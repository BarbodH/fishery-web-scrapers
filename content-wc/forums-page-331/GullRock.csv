2765393,vanscj76,2014-05-06 19:48:00,16,How do things look down towards Poplar Point Resort?
2765761,tackleman,2014-05-06 21:34:00,444,"the poplar point lake is looking pretty solid too, but I couldn't see around past the point from the bug river boat launch. by opener, you might be able to put your boat in at poplar point and make it down the river to the mouth by gullrock."
2768105,jkwildhunting,2014-05-07 12:26:00,361,I hope it doesnt go out till early June. It could put our trip in late June EXCELLENT!!!Thanks for reports guys

2790113,jkwildhunting,2014-05-13 11:29:00,361,Nice fresh coating of snow again this morning for the area.....Good luck to everyone who enjoys fishing the opener. I am happy we stick with our june dates thinking the fishing could be awesome for us this year. Post spawn eyes in the shallows
2790153,bones82,2014-05-13 11:39:00,121,I'll take this any day.
2790193,jkwildhunting,2014-05-13 11:42:00,361,True that but if lake is still iced up hard to fish out of a boat. If they get some rain with the snow and wind with those temps she'll be gone be end of weekend easily
2790201,bones82,2014-05-13 11:44:00,121,Ice is off the English River to the NE of Kenora. I'm fine. Thank you for your concern.
2731481,richf,2014-04-28 07:32:00,31,Was wondering if we could get a GullRock report from Tackleman???
2732513,tackleman,2014-04-28 11:29:00,444,"what would you like to know? I'm fine. the snow is melting. the ice is 30 inches thick. most of the camps are moving their first week guests to week 2 or later. there are reports of some die hard fishermen out there who plan on coming for the opening weekend and taking their chances but I just looked at the long range forecast (14 days) and they are still calling for nighttime temps of below freezing until the 10th of May, right now, it's blowing at 40 km/hr with gusts over 50 so maybe this will help knock the ice down, but there isn't much rain in the forecast to help it rot. I did see water in bug river where the creek from the highway enters so there is hope for fishing bug river on opening day sorry for the bad news report, but it is what it is"
2733481,Golden Eagle,2014-04-28 15:21:00,2642,Thanks Bill. We've already switched from May 17 to May 31. How soon will you be sitting on your lawn chair soaking a minnow and puffing a cigar at the Bug River Bridge? Don't sit too close to the water as those huge pike will be looking for an easy meal.
2733593,tackleman,2014-04-28 15:49:00,444,"went to town this afternoon and looks like there is a bit, just a bit of open water under the bridge, so it might make me wet a line in the next week. as far as the cigars go, gave them up, doctors orders. but the side effects of them are still being felt. I needed something to replace them so I took up eating, now I think I'm going to have to reinforce the lawn chair to hold the extra weight."
2733729,H Burns,2014-04-28 16:09:00,7,Mary will be back tomorrow. She'll scare the ice away.
2735218,jkwildhunting,2014-04-28 22:22:00,361,There are no fish you their rich! May wanna cancel your trip lol We will see you guys again in June. Bringing some need toys along anxious to be in camp with all of Ya!! later Joe
2736674,Moondog,2014-04-29 09:56:00,362,Well that sucks!! I was thinking ice out was ahead of last year.
2764337,tackleman,2014-05-06 15:03:00,444,"not sure if this works or not but i'll give it a try, just took this picture from my deck this afternoon. may 6 , opening day is 11 days away.http://i1135.photobucket.com/albums/...1/may62014.jpg"
2764713,prov1800,2014-05-06 16:18:00,5010,"Id say your f****d, tackleman hope you have a plan B."
2764729,v-bay gord,2014-05-06 16:23:00,3168,He'll be fishing Eagle Lake....
