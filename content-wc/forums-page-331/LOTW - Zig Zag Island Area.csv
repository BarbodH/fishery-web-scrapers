I took out my map this past week and have began scouting for some new spots to try out this year. We typically would run east out of Ptarmigan Bay and fish out in the different areas out on the main basin area (i.e. Whiskey, Manitou, Birch, ect)...we have done a little fishing around Zig Zag Island and the northern end of Ptarmigan bay region, but it's been mostly casting. There looks to be a ton of fun places to try out, east and south east of Zig Zag Island in particular. Does anyone have any thoughts on this area? Knowing this area a little bit, it will likely be very rocky and probably a tough place to run rigs, I'm guessing it will be jigging, pitching jigs, or running cranks over some of the reefs? Every year I try and target a new species or a new area, and think I will search for a consistent walleye bite in this area during this trip! Can't wait"

We'll be up there about same week as you. June 7 - 13. You mentioned looking at the map. Do you use on line mapping? http://www.navionics.com/en/webapp way cool. If I were to go up there I think I would hit the two points on the South circled Are you staying at a resort? I was looking at Clearwater Bay / Deception Bay up that way and I see a marina on the map. Are there any resorts up there?
2790081,mrpike24,2014-05-13 11:24:00,54,"Thanks for the mapping tip MN_Moose! The Sonar feature there looks like it could be a game changer, I have just been looking at my Fishing Hot Spots map with basic contours. The Sonar feature really gives you a better idea on where the flats are, and how sharp some of the breaks on those areas are. The spots your pointed out look great to me, especially with a south wind. Deep[ water near by and a large flat seem like they could be a winning combo if conditions are right. We typically don't travel much farther east than Whiskey but stay in the southern end of Ptarmigan Bay on a private island. There is a very nice and highly recommended resort to stay out however, in Ash Bay. It's a great area if you ever want to change things up. Shoot me a PM back if you ever have any questions. Thanks again and good luck to you!"
