Nothing beats a week with the boys- fishing, eating, telling stories, relaxing. It's my ""reset"" for the year.We're fishing out of Ear Falls at Evergreen- I'm so excited. I'm curious if some of the usual spots will have ice on them still or if they'll be open. I've heard the main lake is open due to the current but not sure about Sawmill and other bays. As long as we have open water we should be able to find some fish. Where do you think they'll be? Up shallow? Teddi or Limey any insight? Tight Lines boys"

He said it snowed 6 inches that day and ice was 5 - 6 inches in Rat Bay and thicker on the main lake. He'd cancelled everyone for opening week, which would be 5/17. He thought ice would be off the bays for the second week, but likely still on the main lake. It might be a different story near Evergreen since there's more current near the dam."
