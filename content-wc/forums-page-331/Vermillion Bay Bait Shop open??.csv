2791345,signmanj,2014-05-13 17:19:00,1,"Our whole family have known Alan and Bobby Dudar for years and years and are two of the greatest guys on earth. We have taken many trips into their lakes via Wilderness Air (Unbelievable fishing) Some of the lakes were so full of Walleye we tell the story the boat motor would be grinding the fish the lakes were so thick) and also fished on their lake and totally loved all of it. Alan stops by our home here in Minnesota still and we have the greatest visits. There was absolutely nothing, again nothing these 2 guys wouldn't do for you and the most generous guys there are. THE best fishing / tackle store in Canada. We love the 2 guys. They're like family."
1678105,BornToFish,2013-04-16 06:47:00,1224,"I assume that you are coming from the East on Hwy. 17 from Dryden. Proceed West on Hwy. 17 past the turn-off to Hwy. 105 about one mile or so. Bobby's will be on your left (South side of the highway), adjacent to the highway. They have a gas station in conjunction with their store. Just turn in where you see all the vehicles.I haven't been in Bobby's for a few years now. They had, and probably still have, an amazing selection of fishing tackle. If they didn't have it in their store, you probably didn't need it anyway.I stopped going there on my way to my vacation as their supply of leeches dried up in early August which is when I stopped there in the past. Our group now buys our licenses on-line. I stopped going there on my return home as they stopped carrying dry ice. They said they were losing too much money on dry ice as the stuff evaporates in their coolers. I now buy my dry ice at Dutchies in Perrault Falls or the shop in Eagle Junction which is on Hwy. 17 mid-way between Vermillion Bay and Dryden.I hope that your fishing trip is a good one."
1679225,tackleman,2013-04-16 10:56:00,444,"in response to the question that was previously asked about the bottom bouncers and jigs. Let me say, if you can't find it at bobbys, you don't need it. he has an amazing little store there."
1679473,skindzier,2013-04-16 11:34:00,137,I shudder to think how much $$$ there is in musky baits hanging on the walls...
1685913,team walleye,2013-04-17 21:25:00,336,Is there a place to get alcohol in Vb?
1685945,v-bay gord,2013-04-17 21:30:00,3168,Liquor store (LCBO) on the highway....west end of town.
1685961,team walleye,2013-04-17 21:32:00,336,Thanks! We'll have to stop before headed north to Perrault.
1686257,wallydave,2013-04-18 04:49:00,2151,Dutchies carries beer and liquor too! Nice folks from Iowa living their dream in Ontario! After the Village Corner burned down we stop there for Canadian beer and Cuban cigars!
1687761,team walleye,2013-04-18 10:00:00,336,Well since I am from Iowa and dutchies it right down the road from Rainbow I think I will go there. I didn't think they sold any last time I was there in 2009.
1688697,jambi,2013-04-18 14:12:00,504,Is Bobby's where the Sasquatch statue is out front? (I think its a female squatch)
1689409,bobbylfishermon,2013-04-18 17:32:00,241,"No jambi my friend, that' Piston Ring, Bobby's Corner is west about a half a mile, on the south side of HWY17, across the street from Buster's BBQ!"
1675185,MOfish,2013-04-15 11:35:00,39,Is the tackle shop located at the corner in Vermillion Bay still open. We plan on stopping there on our way to Onaway but I've heard rumors it was destroyed in a fire and didn't reopen.
1675561,1jigfish2,2013-04-15 13:19:00,110,"Fire did destroy it, they reopened in Dryden. There is a different bait shop east of there. It is Eagle Junction, at the corner of Highways 17 & 594. There hours are 7a.m. - 9p.m. daily. They sell gas, bait, and licenses."
1675777,NARDA 1,2013-04-15 14:01:00,636,The whole corner was destroyed by fire. As of September 2012 it is just a vacant lot.
1675825,wallydave,2013-04-15 14:08:00,2151,"for the Village Corner! Many a great trip ran through there! We would stop for licenses, Cuban cigars and gas on the way North! Dry ice on the way home! They put the local kids to work, always plenty of help available. Now we stop at Dutchies along the 105!"
1675977,tackleman,2013-04-15 15:08:00,444,you can still get bait in Vermilion Bay at the Shell gas station and Bobby's tackle shop is there too.
1676009,bobbylfishermon,2013-04-15 15:26:00,241,"Bobby's Corner in Vermilion Bay is now the only bait and tackle shop in town, it's also a gas station and gift shop with some groceries also, it's located just as you come into town from the west, across the street from Buster's BBQ. Same setup as Jiggers(the place that burnt down) The new place in Dryden is ONLY a gift shop, NO TACKLE !!"
1676433,JayM5209,2013-04-15 17:24:00,1050,"For many years we always stopped at the village corner restaurant for breakfast, then jumped in the trucks to scoot west to Bobby's for licenses, tackle, gas, etc. In fact, I've always been under the distinct impression that it was a violation of both provincial and federal law, if driving anything less than eight axles and 54,000kg, to transverse Vermilion Bay without a full stop at Bobby's! If Bobby's doesn't have it, you don't need it for a week in the bush."
1677313,v-bay gord,2013-04-15 20:42:00,3168,"According to Ray (the owner at Bobby's), Alan has retired. For those not familiar, Alan is Bobby's brother (often mistaken for Bobby) and was the ""memorable, if somewhat grumpy"" person in the tackle section. I'm thinking that Al might still make some guest appearances. It is definitely the end of an era. Some might have taken offence, but the ""shtick"" was truly one of a kind. Nothing like back in the day when both Bobby and Alan would team up on some unsuspecting customer.....it was hilarious. Great guys at heart though.......they lent me $20 years ago when I needed to take my girlfriend to the Bayview Hotel for a beer. Didn't really know me but knew I guided at a local lodge and were happy to help me out. Best of luck on your retirement Al."
1677497,Golden Eagle,2013-04-15 21:29:00,2642,"Yep, first ran across the brothers back in 1972 on my first trip to Red Lake. It was eventful. We dropped a bunch of money that day with our party of 10 and the boys put some twister tails on us to try out. We didn't give them a good shot, but that was the beginning of jigging for us."
1677985,MOfish,2013-04-16 06:15:00,39,"Sounds like Bobby's is the place to go. I'll have to check it out. We'll be coming from Dryden so I guess you go past the turn to Ear Falls and continue to go west. How far past the old Jigger's bait shop is Bobby's? Is it located right on the Hwy? Do they have a good selection of spinners, bottom bouncers, and jigs? Thanks everybody for your advice. This website is very cool!"
