Had a fart that wasn't all fart. Got a little saucy. LOL whoops! And THAT is why my dry bag always has toilet paper. The underwear were a total loss though."
2790265,bushead11,2014-05-13 12:03:00,151,"I'm usually a ""pack the night before"" guy but I know that I'm forgetting things. I wanted to see if anyone more organized than me has a quick checklist they can post. I am looking for one that list clothes, fishing gear and misc stuff like flashlights, ear plugs...We leave a week from Saturday and want to be done backing by this sunday...Thanks guys!"
2791361,MuskyMaster,2014-05-13 17:20:00,79,"I don't make a checklist, I just pack whats needed. I'm leaving next week, 3 pairs of jeans, 3 sweats, long underwear, 4 longsleeve shirts, 5 ts, couple shorts, couple hoodies. Im on a fishing trip im not going for style or cleanliness, rain gear, lights,knives, hats, glasses, lighters in tackle box, put superglue and duct tape in the boat, ear plugs in my travel case because theres 3 guys to a room....... duck call to wake the ****ers up in the morning. Camera, walkie talkie with extra batterys. sunscreen is a must, cloudy days you get burnt!! basic first aid kit since we're not making a several hour trip to the hospital. Just basic stuff of what you take on any fishing trip, im sure I forgot stuff but that's why I organize all my stuff a week before and several more times before I leave, packing clothes is easy, not expecting it to be 90 degrees so bring more cold than warm. I pack as light as possible."

2792137,port1042,2014-05-13 20:21:00,509,Years ago my mother suggested this when I travel. Pack your worst socks and underwear. Rather than bring them home after you wear them -- throw them out. It's a great way to clean out the junk that probably should have been tossed a long time ago and you don't have to pack the dirty undies and smelly socks.
2792241,Pikeslayer8,2014-05-13 20:51:00,1460,"Dang, I'd hate to be the group that follows you and your mother in to camp only to find your dirty, skid marked, elastic streched, Fruit of the Looms scattered about camp. What do-ya do, stick some down the outhouse or how bought the ole burn can or maybe start a tighty whitey dump behind the cabin. Gross! Lol On the plus side, plenty of flags you can use for markers"
2792425,BrianinVA,2014-05-13 21:27:00,160,"You jeans wearers should explore convertible pants. Lightweight, don't retain stench, easy to hand wash if needed, dry quickly and built-in AC. We've even converted the old-timers in our group."
2792809,forgop,2014-05-14 02:23:00,880,"+1 It's always best to pack your rain gear every day you're out, but in the event you get hit or end up in the water for some reason, what do you want to sit in the rest of the day? The jeans that will be wet all day long or convertible pants that are breathable and will dry out in no time? No brainer IMO, not to mention if the sun comes out in the afternoon, you're in shorts in a matter of seconds. The night before we left, I handwashed a pair with some soap and had fresh smelling pants to come home in while everyone else smelled like balls."
2793697,camp chef,2014-05-14 08:04:00,915,LOL I do just the opposite. Before I leave I buy all new underwear and socks. Easy to pack....still packaged. Replace all my old stuff when I get home. I deserve new undies and socks on my vacation.
