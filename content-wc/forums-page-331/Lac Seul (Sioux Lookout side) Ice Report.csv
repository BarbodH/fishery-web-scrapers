2782569,LoDo,2014-05-11 17:21:00,721,"The reports, blogs, webcams, etc…. by far favor the lakes further west than east. Woodland Caribou, Red Lake, Ear Falls and western area of Lac Seul seems to be clearing much quicker than eastern areas of Ontario. Sioux Narrows looks okay from what I'm reading and seeing but definitely behind westerner Ontario. Is this normal?"
2782609,BenBeattie,2014-05-11 17:31:00,232,Not sure if that's normal. There are large parts of open water on areas of Lac Seul where the current is more pronounced. Getting to that open water is going to be the tricky part at least on the East end of the lake. I can't comment on the West end of Lac Seul.

2789377,Hidden Bay Lodge,2014-05-13 08:26:00,12,"I was flying over Kenora, LOTW and Lac Seul Sioux Lookout area 2 days ago at 40, 000ft. I took some pictures and posted them to our website:http://www.hiddenbay.com/icewatch.htmlThe only open water I spotted on Seul was Chamberlain Narrows and the river on the west end by ear falls.But, It wont be long now! Come on Sun Gods!"
2791705,scar,2014-05-13 18:49:00,196,Hey Ben Beattie or any one else near sioux lookout. We are hoping to boat out to Neepawa Island on Minitakki to open our cabin on Saturday morning. Will have to cross some big water to get there. Any chance it will be open? How about some odds? 50- 50? or less?
2791785,prov1800,2014-05-13 19:03:00,5010,From what I have as of today from friends in sioux that chances are pretty slim.
2791889,BenBeattie,2014-05-13 19:29:00,232,I pretty much doubt it'll happen on saturday. Weather is cold now and not supposed to get nice again until Friday/Saturday so melting will be slowed right down. If I was a betting man I wouldn't be betting on you getting there on Saturday. Sorry .
2793593,WDMJigger,2014-05-14 07:47:00,4,Going to be fishing out of Ear Falls 5/17-5/23. Any word on if I will be able to get to Sawmill Bay?
2793897,BenBeattie,2014-05-14 09:00:00,232,You'll have to contact your outfitter on that end of the lake I'm a long way from there and can't comment on that side of the lake.
2780001,BenBeattie,2014-05-10 16:51:00,232,UPDATED THURS MAY 15 - new report is up on my website. www.benbeattieoutdoors.com Some progress but still looks plenty of ice will be around on opening weekend.
2780025,mr ducks,2014-05-10 17:06:00,1459,Thanks for the report Ben! Good to see your name on WC
2780521,prov1800,2014-05-10 20:49:00,5010,"Got lucky here ben clay lake is open, mostly due to the current running through it.had to go there last year to, its almost as good as lac seul.lol.good luck on the weekend."
2780801,Marc,2014-05-11 05:22:00,12,"Thanks for this report Ben, even if it is somewhat discouraging. We arrive on Thursday and it looks like we will be facing a similar situation as last year. We were able to get to Manitou as Deception Light had just cleared the day before. Do you think Deception Light will be open? If so, do you think we could pass through 3 Island Stretch to Banana Island? That is as far as we got last year on opening weekend."
2781457,bigdaddyguns,2014-05-11 08:54:00,608,"Here is a satellite image taken yesterday that provides an overview of the NW Ontario region. It confirms the ground observations the lakes north east of LOTW are mostly ice covered and have a ways to go before ice out. You can see the transition area around the US/CA border but given the weather forecast this week there may not be enough ""progress"" to get those lakes open by Saturday."
2781481,BenBeattie,2014-05-11 08:57:00,232,"I'd be surprised if the deception arm opened up by saturday… but if it does you'll be able to get past manitou but again, I'd be surprised if the 3-island stretch is open."
2781649,Limeyangler,2014-05-11 10:28:00,563,Awesome picture .you are so lucky to have your own spy plane!
2782393,rnnonmt,2014-05-11 16:18:00,992,What are/where is 3-Island stretch? Thanks
2782401,BenBeattie,2014-05-11 16:20:00,232,"The 3 island stretch runs from Devils elbow to Banana island, on SE Lac Seul."
2782417,rnnonmt,2014-05-11 16:24:00,992,Ahh. Gotcha. thanks. Interesting name for that section. Couldnt seem to find 3 islands to give it the name!
