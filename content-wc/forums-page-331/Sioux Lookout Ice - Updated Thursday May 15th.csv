2799169,BenBeattie,2014-05-15 16:31:00,232,UPDATED THURS MAY 15 Pictures are up on my website. Some progress but still looks like plenty of ice will be around on opening weekend. www.benbeattieoutdoors.com
2799441,LoDo,2014-05-15 17:55:00,721,Tough go for those with plans this weekend. I'd bet with the 50s and 60s starting tomorrow and staying consistent into the weekend and next week the ice will be gone within a 3-5 days.
