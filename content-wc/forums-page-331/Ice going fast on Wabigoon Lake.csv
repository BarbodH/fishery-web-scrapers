2794881,Limeyangler,2014-05-14 13:33:00,563,"Well i managed to stand on it on the 11th, got a boot full of water getting onto the ice though. But that day was sunny and hot, next day torrential rain. I'd say the ice was around 10inches thick on the 11th, sun did a real number on it then a ton of rain and 25kmh winds moved the all that honeycomb ice with ease."
