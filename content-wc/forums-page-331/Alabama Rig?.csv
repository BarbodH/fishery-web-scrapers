For anyone not familiar with the AR, it is a popular bass fishing rig, especially in the South. It's basically a jig head that you tie to your line with 3-5 wires extending out the back like an umbrella where you attach swim baits to each wire mimic a school of bait fish. I know Ontario has a 3-hook law, so the 5-wire rigs would be illegal unless you left a couple of the wires empty or use only a dummy bait on those. Just curious..."

Be prepared to be admonished by those who will tell you that a pike will hurt itself if you were to use an Alabama rig. As if using a stickbait with 3 treble hooks is any better. I haven't used one because there are so many other lures that I like to use, I am just not sure where it would fit in my arsenal. And after casting 1,000+ times per day, I can't imagine consistently throwing something so heavy like an A-rig."

OP to answer your question the Riggs work great on pike but you will be constantly replacing the swimbaits from being bitten in half."
2795001,twobearlake,2014-05-14 14:19:00,379,"Yep the main issue is that the pike will mangle the rig. If you do try one, I would recommend replacing the swimbaits on the two extra arms with willow leaf blades. The added flash works great."
2795521,Cumminsram2010,2014-05-14 17:04:00,396,"I am working on making a musky sized version of this bait with heavy wire and that will use 5 8"" swimbaits."
2795681,LoDo,2014-05-14 17:51:00,721,"not to bash the idea of this rig, as I'm sure it works well, but I feel like i'd find myself horsing around too much re riggin and less time fishing. Where we go its as easy as a jig and a minnow."
2795809,Cumminsram2010,2014-05-14 18:31:00,396,That's all good but a lot of people myself included don't have the luxury of going to places that have that low of a fishing pressure. Most of the places that I can fish are heavily pressured. For example my three closest musky lakes to me each see upwards of 100-150 boats per weekend. And my closest good walleye lake is the same way. This forces one to become innovative in the baits and presentations that are used. I myself try and always throw something new since the fish I am fishing for have seen more baits than most fisherman have. I wish it was as simple as a minnow and jig all the time but usually for me it's not. Plus I like tinkering.

Fairly productive, 3 jig heads with spinners, rig held up fine. It was a late ice out and smallies we're not around as much. It's different and fun. Your buddies may laugh, give it a shot for sure"
