2705410,Knoxabilly,2014-04-21 13:38:00,225,We are planning on stopping at a buddy's cabin in Lake Vermillion in MN if the ice is still on. Worst case scenario we fish there for a few days then make the trek to Lac Seul. I know the ice will be gone though for opener. Positive thinking!
2706154,tuiflies,2014-04-21 16:45:00,158,"Is this normal? Seems like a pretty inconsiderate way to screw your customers if the weather doesn't cooperate. I can understand the outfitter not wanting to miss out on filling the camp if you want to cancel for your own reasons, but if the weather won't let you fish then no one else would be in there anyways."
2706562,octanehi5,2014-04-21 18:34:00,1104,"if the outfitter does not give you what you are paying them for,or take care of you on a future date ,be it this yr or next , You need a new outfitter. Most top notch outfitters will take care of you. The outfitter that I use,a deposit of $200 per person,locks you into a trip the balance is due when you fly out. Also in the future you may not want to book so early.Some of the best walleye fishing you will ever encounter occures with water temp in the 60s. I will only book the last week in June or the first week in July. never a problem about ice out, I myself love a late ice out, the fishing at that time is off the hook."
2794681,rpsnider,2014-05-14 12:28:00,3,Ice is out past the legal area to fish for walleye at trappers point camp at the tip of Sturgeon Lake due to the unique location being located on a walleye sanctuary. Main lake is still iced over but should be out by May 31st. Walleyes will be on a feeding frenzy!
2618001,RickOnt,2014-03-31 06:49:00,217,"Hey Guys Just thinking What if and that is still a big 'if' The opener and early weeks of Walleye are still a long way off and lots can happen with the weather. My trip is May 31 I am not too worried yet but I am watching the weather. ""IF"" Your trip is cancelled because of Ice and the planes can't fly What are you gonna do? I will try to book a trip later in June But availability will be a huge issue as most camps are already reserved. Option #2 would be to roll my payment over to 2015 and mark 2014 up to experience!! Your Thoughts Rick"
2618073,octanehi5,2014-03-31 07:07:00,1104,"Your trip is 30 days out,call the outfitter when you start to feel uncomfortable about your date,If they will honer your deposit, in 2015, then make an other plan"
2618121,Mike Borger,2014-03-31 07:10:00,1554,"I'm slated to fly in May 23-30 and I have a back up trip in place with another outfitter. My back up date is the week you're scheduled to fly in LOL!Honestly Rick, flying out of Chapleau on May 31 you have nothing to worry about."
2618209,octanehi5,2014-03-31 07:32:00,1104,"Chapleau is near white fish bay, no probem taking off , Where are you going to Land?If I were you guys I would pay very close attention to Ice out on the lake your flying to. I have two spots open the last week of June?"
2618241,RickOnt,2014-03-31 07:36:00,217,Hi Mike Like I said I am not 'too' worried yet But I am thinking about it!! LOL Biggest issue for our group is a couple of guys would have a problem changing their weeks vacation time. Rick
2622945,polaris-pete,2014-03-31 22:44:00,343,"Rick- we are also flying out of Chapleau on May 31st.I have been in contact with Martin and he thinks there will be no surprises.But just in case it does happen and we get iced out, we will just roll our deposit over until next year because as was mentioned, the majority of good dates later on have been taken.A lot can happen til then so keep your fingers crossed."
2623017,roscoe33,2014-04-01 03:04:00,653,"Well, the fish camp we go to says you need to cancel by April 1. Then your deposit can be applied to any open dates, this year only. So, its to late for me to cancel. But if its still iced in, it sure isn't worth taking the drive to look at ice. Fishing was really screwed up the first couple weeks of the season last year. Lake still had ice for the opener. And fish wanted to spawn, not eat. Sure hope it isn't that bad this year. Its dads last trip to Canada, and it sure would be nice if he could fill his memories with fish."
2623033,Mike Borger,2014-04-01 03:25:00,1554,"Well, pretty much every outfitter will hold over your deposit for the following year.Considering the circumstances with it being your dads last trip I'd book something else for a safer date like mid to late June."
2623289,RickOnt,2014-04-01 06:19:00,217,"Hi Pete We are actually going out of Hawk Junction, but as far as ice goes Chapleau or Hawk Junction likely no difference. However in Chapleau you take off from the river which will likely be clear of ice before Lakes in the area. But then it is a concern about the Lake you are landing on. I really think by May 31 we will be good to go. However the fishing will be different than the usual first week of June, Water will for sure be colder. Rick"
