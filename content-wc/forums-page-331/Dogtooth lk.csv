2539825,bigtimeelectric,2014-03-10 17:11:00,174,"I checked into going there a couple years ago. Its rumored to have a good amount of large walleye in it. I here it is not a numbers, but a size lake. I also here it can be very challenging to navigate with lots of hidden hazards!!!!!!!! Nice looking resort on the lake however I believe they are full a lot so can be difficult to get in. I know you were looking for first hand, however I seen you had no replies on your post. Maybe you should put something about consuming alcohol in the title then you would get some hits!!!!!!lol"

I was fishing another Lake near Kenora and heard it described as a tough lake to crack .....with trophy potential especially at night in early season and late fall . Check out info at: Contact Wayne & Patty JonesDogtooth Lake ResortPO Box 437Kenora, OntarioCanada P9N 3X4(807) 548-5101[email protected] Also a website if you google Dogtooth Lake Resort. It is still on my list too."
2541561,SJJ,2014-03-11 08:01:00,15,"I fished Dogtooth several years ago. There are some big walleye in that lake. We never found walleye in any real numbers but did manage to find fish every day. We talked to a group that stayed there for a month and they gave us info on where to go and how to fish them. This isn't an easy lake to fish but if you get the right info it will help. There are a lot of hazards on the lake, we pulled one boat off a rock pile, my brother missed hitting the rocks by a few feet just because he wasn't paying attention. We did get checked by a game warden or whatever they are called. I also watched for boats that looked like they were ""locals"" and I would watch where they were fishing and that helped putting fish in the boat. For me I wouldn't go back there, but my brother said it was the only lake he would fish in Canada so everyone has a different idea of what they want to fish. I think I might consider hiring a guide, we didn't, and talked to no one that had done this but a good guide can put you way ahead of the game in a hurry. The cabins I felt were average, but I have since read they have upgraded them."

Might warrant a day trip if you are so inclined however, I cant see anyone spending a week here given the better alternatives in the immediate vicinity."
2545721,JDP,2014-03-12 09:24:00,1457,"Butch Furtman used to do annual episode of his fishing Show on Dogtooth.He caught some huge walleyes.I believe he stayed at Dogtooth Lake Resort.Of course Wayne put him on the fish no doubt.Butch lists this as one of his ""Top Destinations"".He does note that it is a tough lake to fish though.http://butchfurtman.com/pages/top_tens.php"
2791161,Midwestrn,2014-05-13 16:14:00,1,"A group of us go to Dogtooth every year. It's took us a while, but finally got the hang of the lake. As was mentioned before, it's not a lake where you will go out and catch LOTW type numbers in a day, every day. We have had some decent days where it's one right after the other, but they are decent size fish. Last year we had a hard time catching fish outside of the 23 to 27 in range. I wouldn't say it's a super dangerous lake to navigate. You just need to be aware like you would any lake. Wayne does have maps of the lake that are pretty good. If you would like to know more, send me a message."
