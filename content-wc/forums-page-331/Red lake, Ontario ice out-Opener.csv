1785417,tackleman,2013-05-18 11:41:00,444,"i feel your pain Connie, I took down my snow fence on the septic field a few minutes ago and while I was doing that I could see the guests from the camps heading out to fish. the sad part was, for them, the ice is completely blocking the entrance to the lake by the island in our bay, so they go out, follow the edge of the ice looking for a path through then I see them coming back to fish in the bug river area.I haven't even got my big boat out of the garage yet and my skiff is still sitting up in the parking lot without being serviced to launch this season. and oh yes, i'm on call for work so even if I had a boat in , I would have to stay home waiting for the call to work."

We found 22 inches of ice where no skidoos had been. We expecting more. Last year on May 1, we found 15-16 inches in the same place. Hoping to get planes on the ice and then flying them to the river next week. Enid"

1768977,Golden Eagle,2013-05-12 17:04:00,2642,"Hard to do this time as we're picking up a member of our party in Indy, missing your fields. Hope it's soon dry enough to plant. I'm hoping were're good to go in Friday at noon. LV is shallow and should break up among the first, just so there's a place for the ice to go that's out of the way.It's an exciting time of the year. Wouldn't change a thing."

1777121,Enid Elizabeth,2013-05-15 11:44:00,59,Things are going fast after rain and wind yesterday and warmer temps today. We are flying off the river now and finding a few lakes open. Time to check with your outfitter and get fishing!

1783497,Golden Eagle,2013-05-17 15:05:00,2642,"Any news about flying off Red Lake and landing on Little Vermilion. I rescheduled for June 1, but wondering if I could be standing in the parking lot, kicking rocks and getting ready to head out for a week of fishing.I'm a little concerned about wind strength and direction for now and the next couple of days. Where will the ice end up?"
1784625,campchick,2013-05-18 05:48:00,96,Latest news is Little Vermillion is all but wide open. Only some very dark ice in the north end as of last night. Brett has launched the Beaver and is busy flying.
1784857,Golden Eagle,2013-05-18 07:52:00,2642,"Thanks, and I'm sitting at home in Tennessee, missing the opener on LV for first time since 1983. Not good to end a streak.Bet the Beaver's tongue is hanging out from so many trips."
1721697,Enid Elizabeth,2013-04-28 09:41:00,59,"Well last Wednesday every lake trout fisherman in the area should have taken the day off and gone fishing. Perfect ice conditions! On Saturday, water everywhere. Now today already lots has drained off. here is a video of my ride up Red Lake on my nice old SL500http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx9Lf...JbxDq-YARYMBHQ"
1722217,Flip Silverlake,2013-04-28 15:16:00,645,Got a text from my neighbor on Pine Portage Bay LOTW and he said there is 3 feet of clear ice in the bay. He sent that just after clearing 12 inches of snow off his deck. Forcast doesn't look good for the next couple of weeks. I have a place just east of Kenora and for those folks to get in they needed 4 wheel drive due to the snow.
1740369,Enid Elizabeth,2013-05-03 12:05:00,59,"http://youtu.be/YJI_GyzvPbk The video from May 1 We drilled a hole in front of our house where there has been no skidoo traffic. We surprised to find only 16 inches of blue ice, 10 inches of water on top of that and then an additional 2 inches of ice. I expected more blue ice. Some people have found much more ice in different spots. It's been cold here the last few days. The ducks are flying around confused looking for just a touch of water. Early this morning there was actually a skim of ice at the Chukuni bridge with the ducks sitting on top. Warm weather coming this weekend and I hope it is HOT."
1765905,Guest,2013-05-11 11:21:00,0,"With wind, rain, current and warm weather the ice is going very fast. Just returned from a trip to Winnipeg and yesterday lakes are open completely to Perrault Falls and the ice here on Lac Seul changed dramatically. We are ice free and a drive to Goldpines shows open water as far as I can see. With another week of warm temps and this wind, Red lake and north should be in good shape."
1766665,teddi,2013-05-11 17:50:00,349,"The north west end of lac seul is open as i post this. there are three camps that will have acess to steamboat narrows and sawmill bay by opener. evergreen,timberlane and gold pines will be very good shape come opener."
1766673,teddi,2013-05-11 17:55:00,349,Golden eagle should also be in good shape as the are in the sane area.
1766825,Golden Eagle,2013-05-11 19:07:00,2642,"Hoping so. We're good to take off from the Chukuni River, by the bridge. What we don't need is a strong south wind that could pile up ice near camp on Little Vermilion and hold us up on landing. It happened in 2008 until we lucked out on a wind shift. Little Vermilion is one of the shallowest lakes in the area and wants to break up first."

1767313,Golden Eagle,2013-05-12 03:23:00,2642,Ice is being made right now in Red Lake. 20F and probably lower in outlying areas. Sunshine today will probably find Hugh Carlson in he air this afternnoon. Maybe a report tonight.

1678249,jigman 2003,2013-04-16 07:22:00,981,I've got a feeling the ice won't be off lakes in west central MN until the first weekend of May.
1695145,Enid Elizabeth,2013-04-20 09:18:00,59,Hugh and skidoo-ed up Red Lake yesterday to Douglas Lake. We've missed those crazy snow storms so snow is going here. Still lots of ice with snow cover.

1708001,Bill Krejca,2013-04-23 20:22:00,6107,"Some years ago, I remember the folks at Morson used to drag an old car onto the ice and then have a contest as to when the car sank. Anybody remember this? I'd guess this doesn't happen any more. Bill Krejca"
1709481,Enid Elizabeth,2013-04-24 08:31:00,59,"We operate outposts west of Red Lake and north. Most years we are flying off the river before Red Lake is open. Our outpost lakes generally open a week before Red Lake, except McInnes Lake. Even 100 miles north our shallow lakes are open before Red. So for me, the question is when can we get into our outposts. Some years we had to move guys to where the lakes were open but always there is a solution. For now, I am skidooing up the lake to Douglas and cleaning cabins while I can get there. Some years we have been able to help out other operators by taking their guests until their lakes open. I expect we will be fine but it will be a late breakup and who knows... maybe another record! So if you are planning on fishing the opener up here keep in contact with your operator. Your lake may be fine or your operator will have a plan. I'll try to keep my blog up to date especially once things start moving.www.viking-island.blogspot.ca"
1710073,Golden Eagle,2013-04-24 10:15:00,2642,Thanks Enid.
1664321,zeebee,2013-04-12 09:05:00,1144,Serious melting temps will only break in about 10 days...ie where day and night temps aboive freezing. After that it depends on heat and wind. We need to find a lodge that will sponsor an ice out contest...$5 a guess with winner to get a week trip.....any lodge owners interested????
1664433,michigan walleye guy,2013-04-12 09:35:00,95,"Small world! I too will be flying in to Clear Lake in mid-June with another group of guys I go with. You wouldn't by chance be with Keith's group from Appleton, would you?Clear Lake is very comparable to Larus in terms of numbers, but not size, I've found. But the great thing about Clear is that you and your 3 buddies are the only ones on the lake, whereas Larus has a few cabins, with a max. of 18 between the two, which can make the prime spots a little crowded sometimes."
1665337,epiepenburg,2013-04-12 12:57:00,365,"You bet! Keith heads to Malahar for the opener, then we go up the 8th of June. Last year was a great year for us on Clear, it was my first time up there. But I have been fishing with the same group for a few years in Hayward."

Looking forward to seeing you guys in June."
1674521,115 optimax,2013-04-15 08:53:00,650,-2c and snowing like crazy in Dryden right now!!
1674585,1jigfish2,2013-04-15 09:17:00,110,"115Optimax, Thanks for the update, please keep us advised on the weather up your way. If you could update us maybe once a week, to let us know how things are going for ice out, it would be greatly appreciated. I believe there are many on this board that would find it very interesting. We fish on Cedar Lake, just north of Vermillion Bay, so you are not too far away. Thank you."
1657241,Guest,2013-04-10 12:26:00,0,"Was ice fishing Monday afternoon about 35 Km NE of Ear Falls on a small bush lake. The snow off my trapping rail was a foot and a half deep and we drilled a good 3 feet of hard ice to fish. Dark water lake, bright sun and walleye bit like crazy."
1657713,Glenman12,2013-04-10 14:14:00,762,wow..thats a lot of ice..looking at the long range til the 1st week in May I don't see a lot of good melting days either..
1657801,teddi,2013-04-10 14:41:00,349,"It,s going to be close. The flyin guys may lose the first couple of weeks but down south things should be open, A late spawn and the big girls are going to take a beating this year."
1658081,Golden Eagle,2013-04-10 15:50:00,2642,Best to pick a shallow lake to fish and have a river to fly from.
1660569,Enid Elizabeth,2013-04-11 09:30:00,59,"The ice can go out so quickly with sun, wind, or rain. It is the last bit of ice that can be so frustrating and can hang on for days without some drastic weather happening. So far though the weather remains chilly and the ice is up to the auger handle on Red Lake. Great ice fishing weather and good going on the lake for now. I would like to say to you guys who ""worry"" A good day fishing in any weather easily beats a day at work. Lake ice in your drink is a good thing. Being here to watch the ice go out in a strong wind is a great adventure. Like wise with dodging ice floes to get to a fishing spot. The guys who have turned up in the past, despite a bit of ice, have all had a good time. The worst that has happened to us in 65 years of operation is that a few groups had to change camps to where the ice was gone or in one case delay flying out by a day."
1660633,Golden Eagle,2013-04-11 09:43:00,2642,"It's good having a professional join the forum.I've been following your blog, just about every day. Thanks for the effort you put into it."
1661721,michigan walleye guy,2013-04-11 13:59:00,95,"Our group is flying in to Larus Lake in May, and it looks like we could be cutting it close. I can remember one other spring (I think it was 2004), with ice cold water and freezing temps., the only place we could find the walleyes was in the inlet creek areas--we motored several hundred yards up the inlet creek, and the walleyes were in there thick. Last year was one of the earliest springs ever--I think we had 70 degree+ weather all week, with brilliant sunshine. Every year is different, that's what makes it great!"
1662513,epiepenburg,2013-04-11 18:14:00,365,"Larus lake as in the Larus Lake through Nestor Falls? I'll be flying with them to Clear in early June, but some of our group is planning on going to Malahar for the opening week. I agree it will be cutting it close."
1663025,115 optimax,2013-04-11 20:27:00,650,Still 3ft of ice with lots of snow on top in Dryden.It's going to be cold at night for the next 2 weeks -8c to -12c.Day time highs of +3c to +6c.
1663057,Glenman12,2013-04-11 20:37:00,762,yep..read Enids blog everyday..though she's 90 miles or so north of where we go we can I can get an idea of how iceout is going...keep em coming Enid..

1651322,Tonyo,2013-04-09 05:06:00,212,Just wanted to put this back at the top to see how the ice is progressing. I have been watching the weather and see it is still winter around the Red Lake areas. TonyO
1651417,2746,2013-04-09 05:35:00,3206,"I wonder historically if there has been a year when the opening week was lost to ice. A few years back our resort at Gullrock said it would be iffy and gave us permission to look at other options if we wished. As it turned out his bay was open on Saturday and the lake opened by Sunday. Tackelman, maybe you can recall a ""lost"" opening week."
1651465,Ia Walihntr,2013-04-09 05:58:00,320,"In 1995 our group was frozen out of the opener. We fished LOTW. The ice in Sabaskong Bay was out but our resort was located about 15 miles east of Angle Inlet and that area was still socked in with ice. The ice went out Monday after the opener but we had to make other arrangements in order to utilize scheduled vacations. I would guess the ice-out was late that year on several bodies of water, especially as far north as Gullrock and Red Lake ."
1652481,Golden Eagle,2013-04-09 10:41:00,2642,"Heard from my outfitter this morning. It's going to be close. Our group is going in May 17 and our lake is shallow, which means it breaks up earlier than deeper lakes. There's still around 30"" of ice and a lot of snow on top of the ice. Around a foot of snow is sitting on roof of cabins. Come early May, we'll need sunshine and strong wind."
1652585,wallydave,2013-04-09 10:56:00,2151,"The average ice-out for the NE end of LS is May 5th. This winter looks to be like the 2011 one, the 2012 was very early ice-out! Things always have a way of averaging out. Of course; the closer May comes and the countdown begins to get serious, we have a need to know whats going on with our little piece of Canadian Heaven!"
1652657,Glenman12,2013-04-09 11:05:00,762,"this is a Lac Seul opener, it says it was 4 yrs ago but not sure from dating back from what year it was posted.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4sxhRbFyI"
1652905,zeebee,2013-04-09 11:50:00,1144,Minus 20 deg C in Wpg this morn....cant imagine Red Lake much different. Aint nothing melting except for the expectation of a normal ice out. This is one of the longest....coldest springs I can remember. All can change pretty quick tho.
1653345,tackleman,2013-04-09 13:35:00,444,"a few years ago I went to Eagle Lake for the opener and we had ice on the lake the evening before opening day, woke up in the morning and it was gone. we made it up the creek to Clearwater lake for trout and when we got there only the first bay was open and there were large cracks between ice flows on the lake and each crack had a lodge boat fishing it.all it would take would be a little wind and those boats would have been trapped or maybe crushed, we turned around and headed back into eagle.as far as gullrock our ice out records show the south bay on gullrock, where I live, had ice out on May 20 1996, May 18 1997, and May 25 2000."
1655009,Tonyo,2013-04-09 20:58:00,212,"Thanks for the update guys. I find it interesting to watch from year to year how different springs can be. The late ice out makes the fishing from our resorts docks great entertainment in the evenings while enjoying an adult beverage, watching the sun set over Gullrock lake. TonyO"
1573538,Marc63280,2013-03-19 14:16:00,309,I have a trip planned for the opener this year and I am getting a little nervous about the ice. Do you think it will be off by that time this year???

1582602,REG,2013-03-21 11:38:00,445,Relax.Plenty of time to go and that ice goes off fast once it warms up.
1583186,tackleman,2013-03-21 14:03:00,444,the ice better be out by opener or i'm going to have a hard time trolling.

1583978,plumberjoe,2013-03-21 17:06:00,54,We have been going to Sturgeon for the opener for quit a few years now and twice we have had floating ice chunks on the lake when we got there. The good part was that the big females were in shallow dark water bays and a blast to catch & release but it made for cold fishing. It was a bit touch and go the week prior to leaving wondering if we could get out.
