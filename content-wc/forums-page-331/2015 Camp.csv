We're looking for Ontario Canada drive to or boat in lodge that book the cabin by a fixed amount for the week (or day) as opposed to a per person rate for the cabin. Not looking for anything fancy, preferably no small night time critters with us. Camp should have maps or maps available from a commercial source. Light housekeeping. Main target species: Walleye, smallmouth and northern. Musky are OK but not necessary. With our travel time considerations, we'd like to stay south of a line from about Boot Bay on Lake of The Woods, south of Eagle Lake, and south of Lake Nipigon to the east. Border Crossing at either I.F. or Pigdeon River would be OK. We're looking at a group up to 6 max for 2015. Steve"

2800361,ftfarms,2014-05-16 03:27:00,444,I think buena vista resort out of morson Ontario has what your looking for. Thay charged us last year so much for the cabin and not per man.
