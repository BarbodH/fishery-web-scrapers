2798681,P&y only,2014-05-15 13:45:00,133,They work VERY well on walleyes and small pike. Big pike will disassemble them in short order. Cant see how you'd hurt a fish with one. Half the time I never pull the fish clear out of the water. They just hang there and let you unhook them.

From prior discussions it appears that a significant number of WCers do . . . . and there is also a number of folks who think they're the cruelest form of illegal torture you could ever impose on a fish, so make your own decision.Two comments: 1) I'm attaching a photo of a lip gripper that I think is much better. It's light weight, it's much easier to use than the Boga style grip, it floats when you drop it overboard, and it only costs $13-$15, available from Cabela's and BPS.2) A lip grip can be much easier on the fish than letting it flop in the bottom of the boat or sticking fingers in the gills to lift it. If, after attaching the lip grip, the fish is allowed to hang vertically and the gripper is held vertically (in line with the fish's body) any stress or harm to the fish is minimized. Holding the gripper horizontally while the fish hangs vertically can sometimes cause harm.As with any method, the quicker the fish is back in the water the better.Happy fishing."

2795601,jaym,2014-05-14 17:26:00,89,"We use a Berkley gripper with the tape measure attached. Pick up fish, measure, and release. We only use it on walleye because we had a pike thrash around and break its lower jaw. The only problem with the tape measure is it gets water and fish slime in it, rusts, and lasts only one or two seasons. I cut open the plastic container it is in and replace it with a cheap tape measure from Home Depot and it gets us thru another season."
2795721,rocko0305,2014-05-14 18:08:00,138,"I bought this same one last year, and although I rarely used it because the cradle worked so well, when I did use it I liked it a lot. Love the fact that it floats too, and doesn't cost an arm and a leg like a true boga grip does."
2795737,yoopertrout,2014-05-14 18:15:00,1172,"I've used one for several years on muskies and the occasional northern. it's an inexpensive one (Berkeley?). The only trouble I've had is if the fish starts to roll. That will be solved by the Boga I got for Christmas. I would recommend a rope from your wrist to the grip. If it slips out of your hand while attached to the fish, you've lost it, and, worse yet, probably killed the fish."
2797033,forgop,2014-05-15 06:48:00,880,I used the fish gripper posted above. Worked great and the great solution to getting a grip on those pike without getting all slimey.
2797113,liner,2014-05-15 07:00:00,5,I have a Berkley and like it. Find it helpful in securing the fish so I can remove the hook without taking the fish out of the water. Two things that I think are important. Make sure that it swivels and that it has a scale. Both features will save your elbow and shoulder when landing a big twisting northern. Used one that didn't do either and felt like my arm was going to be ripped off.
2797161,jfaisten,2014-05-15 07:17:00,1060,"Take a hard look at the Boga grips. I've had a set for years and they can't be beat for pike, muskie and walleye. They are expensive but are built to last and have a scale that is allegedly approved for tournament use."
2797449,Catch 22,2014-05-15 08:11:00,417,"If it will be your go to landing option....invest in a Boga. I use one in the canoe and kayak mainly for handling northern and musky in the water. Which ever gripper you chose....it should swivel and have a lanyard connected to your wrist....otherwise a twisting , rolling fish will break its jaw or jerk the grip out of your hand. I don't use it to weigh big fish...just handle them in the water."
