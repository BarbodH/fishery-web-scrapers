By Dan Gauthier for The Enterprise Saturday April 08, 2006 Kelly Smith, left, and Chris Manus still have the boat and motor they swamped on Lake of the Woods during a hunting trip last fall which almost cost them their lives. Smith considers it a God-given miracle they are alive and well back in Mineral Springs, N.C. today. Many of us don't know -- or want to know -- the icy cold sting you would feel when thrown from a boat into the frigid waters of Lake of the Woods in subzero temperatures. Those who have, should count themselves lucky if they live to talk about it. A pair of duck hunters from North Carolina survived just such a frightening experience last fall on Lake of the Woods. Their 18-foot duck boat was swamped by waves in Yellow Girl Bay during a freak wind and snowstorm on the morning of Oct. 4. Kelly Smith, 34, and Chris Manus, 31, both of Mineral Springs, N.C., located about 30 miles southeast of Charlotte, made it to a small island that morning and then spent a long cold night in that storm. They were soaked to the bone, huddled around a tiny campfire they managed to build, and fought off the sweet temptation of a hypothermic-induced sleep and certain death. We spent 20 hours on this little spit of an island -- dying, stated Smith matter-of-factly last week from his North Carolina home. Smith said it was time to tell this story, after more than five months of trying unsuccessfully to get over the traumatic experience, when he called the offices of the Lake of the Woods Enterprise on March 24. All this stuff is a miracle, said Smith. It's a God-given miracle I'm even talking to you. He said he has fielded inquiries from a number of magazines and newspapers in his home state for interviews to tell his story, but until now he just wasn't able to do it. You're the first person I've ever talked to about it, said Smith, noting he had not even spoke to his hunting partner Manus about it since the incident. I still have a lot of nightmares about it and it's really hard to talk about. Home base The story begins in Bear Bay, a tiny sliver of a bay off of Yellow Girl Bay, just north of the Aulneau Peninsula. This was home base for Smith and Manus who had made a tent camp there for their week-long hunting trip. After monitoring weather reports with a short-wave radio, the pair decided on the morning of Oct. 4 to brave the storm and try to make it back to their truck. It was about 12 miles by boat, and they planned on getting a hotel room in nearby Sioux Narrows for a night or two to wait out the weather. Smith said once they emerged from the protected confines of Bear Bay into Yellow Girl, they were faced with three to four-foot swells which their small duck boat, with a 35-horsepower outboard motor, just could not handle. It looked like the ocean, said Smith. It really looked like the ocean on a bad day. He said they veered off from the main channel that led into the big part of Lake of the Woods looking for land before they were swamped. However, the large waves soon came over the back end of the boat, where Manus was driving, and the boat sank. Wearing life jackets over several layers of clothing and rain gear, Smith said they were able to retrieve their shotguns before the boat went under and they swam for land. He said it was only about 10 a.m. when they pulled themselves onto a small island nearby. Another narrow miss With both men soaking wet in the frigid temperatures, Smith said he relied on his military training with the U.S. Army, quickly found a sheltered area by a fallen tree and gathered some wood to make a fire. He said he used a military-type of igniter fuel, which he described as compressed fuel tablets, to get a small fire going in the windy and snowy conditions. However, while trying to get the fire started, Smith said he heard a series of cracks from the few trees on the tiny island and realized a 40 to 50-foot dead spruce tree was falling in the high winds, right towards his position. I was on my knees, I couldn't move, said Smith, noting the extreme cold he was feeling left him virtually immobile. I just closed my eyes because the tree started to fall my way. The tree fell, Smith opened his eyes, reached out and could touch the base of the tree with the palm of his hand. It had missed him by mere feet. That's how close the tree came to hitting me, said Smith. Smith said the fallen tree was actually a blessing as it made a semi-triangle with the other fallen tree to make their make-shift shelter even better. He got a small fire going and they later laid a duck blind tarp, which they managed to salvage from the boat, over their shelter to protect them from the falling snow and sleet. After finding some shelter and getting over the initial shock from the cold water, Smith said he and Manus spent over five hours pulling the partially submerged boat into shore. He explained that the boat ended up vertical in the water, motor down and stuck on the rocks below, about 15-20 feet from the island's shoreline. They fished in the long tow rope with a stick and strenuously hauled the water-logged boat into shore. Smith said the motor was inoperable, but there was one paddle still wedged inside the vessel. We just dug in for the night' By the time they got the boat, bailed it out and checked it for holes, it was already dark. Smith said they had spotted a cottage on a nearby island with a pair of binoculars Manus had kept around his neck, but decided not to try to risk getting to the cabin in the dark. We just dug in for the night, said Smith. We just sat there and kept each other awake because hypothermic shock had set in. All we wanted to do was go to sleep, he said. But I knew if we did that we were going to die. I felt like I had been sedated by a doctor, said Smith of what if felt like when hypothermia set in. It's like the most inviting thing in the world is just to go to sleep. Smith said they kept the fire going and kept each other awake, by talking about everything that you could imagine  our life history. He remembered that the night went by very slow and the minutes went by like hours. At 6 a.m. the next morning, Oct. 5, Smith said they were extremely cold, hungry and tired, and decided they were getting over to the the other island and shelter one way or another. If we drowned, we drowned, said Smith of the difficult decision to get back in the boat. But we were dying, we had no choice. However, Mother Nature finally took some pity on the two unlucky hunters. Smith said the wind shifted about 30 degrees during the night and blew straight towards the island with the cottage and to safety. Smith said they made it easily over to the other island and quickly lit a woodstove in the cabin, shed their wet clothes and found some blankets. They then collapsed and slept for two hours after being forced to remain awake in the worst of conditions for 20 hours the night before. Guardian angel' answers call When they awoke, Manus located a solar-powered CB radio in the cabin and began calling out for assistance on the emergency channel 16, while Smith gathered up their gear. After several attempts, they finally heard a response. It was Totem Lodge's operations manager Gina Sinclair who said, This is Totem Lodge. Can we help you? She was like a guardian angel, you know, said Smith of hearing Sinclair respond to their radio call. Smith said in less than 20 minutes Totem Lodge had a boat with four camp staff there to pick up the two hapless hunters. The rescuers included Jarid Heibert, Jeff LeBron, Faith McEvoy and Stephanie Brown  daughter of Totem Lodge owner Eric Brown. They brought blankets, hot drinks and warm clothing to the hunters and whisked them back to the five-star tourist resort near Sioux Narrows. It was like an unofficial rescue team waiting for us, said Smith. At the posh resort, which only had a few duck hunters for guests at that time of year, Smith and Manus were fed and provided with their own chalet to stay in overnight to recover from their ordeal. Sinclair said the pair were quite a sight when they first got to the lodge, with one of the men crying uncontrollably as he walked onto the dock. They looked completely devastated, said Sinclair. They thought their life was over. The two were very emotional and appreciative to Sinclair and Totem Lodge for saving them, but Sinclair said she told them she didn't feel like she had done anything extraordinary. It's one of those things where it makes me feel really good that I did answer that radio call that day, said Sinclair. I don't feel like I actually saved their lives, but they do. Treated like kings' Later the same day, they were given one of the camp boats so they could return to the cottage and to their Bear Bay campsite to retrieve all their gear. They treated us like kings, said Smith of the Totem Lodge staff. They fed us and they gave us anything we wanted. All throughout, Smith said Totem Lodge staff told them the cost for these services would be put on their tab. During the whole process they never asked the question that, around here (North Carolina), we are used to being asked, said Smith. That is How are you going to pay for this?' When it came time for the two to leave, Sinclair approached them at their cabin with a folded piece of paper. She handed it to them saying Here's your bill. We opened it up and there was a great big zero on it, said Smith, adding that they both broke down in tears when they realized Totem Lodge was covering all their expenses there. We had already been through so much already. Sinclair said this was just an example of the generous nature of Totem Lodge owner Eric Brown. When someone is that devastated and thinking that they are going to lose their lives, it's pretty hard to turn around and throw them a bill, said Sinclair. It's just one of those nice things that Eric Brown does for people. He would do it for anybody that was in such a terrible incident. Smith said the generosity and caring of Brown, his family and staff, is the real reason he decided to come forward to tell his story now and here in the Lake of the Woods area where it happened. He wanted residents in the region to know what Totem Lodge had done for them. People need to know that charity and good Samaritans still exist in the world and that's what the people at Totem Lodge are, said Smith, referring to Brown's decision not to charge them. He's one of the nicest guys I've every met and my guardian angel is Gina. back Proprietor and published by Bowes Publishers Limited at 33 Main St. S., P.O.

That hunk of water is & can be dangerous. If anybody ever has any trouble out here, I'd be 100% correct in saying that ANY Totem guide will respond. I'd also be correct in saying that any other guide / camp would do the same. Good SAFE fishen Rob"
556227,Guest,2006-04-14 19:53:00,0,"Absolutely!! I know of no guide or no lodge who wouldn't do the same thing in that or similar situations. Like anyone with their livelihoods, guides take great pride in being of service in such situations. I don't think any lodge would charge for saving people and allowing them to recuperate. I've been on more than a few rescue missions myself, none quite that serious, but similar in one way or another, and the message is almost always the same . . . things can go wrong in a hurry up here. A couple bad decisions, mistakes, or even just unfortunate luck can have a domino effect and lead to instances just lilke this one. It sounds like despite the quick sequence of events, these gentlemen were reasonably prepared for tough conditions, and it probably saved their lives! NWO Fishing Bum"

556232,Guest,2006-04-15 03:07:00,0,"It's always nice to read a story like that when there is a happy ending. Kudos to Totem for how the took care of the hunters. I know 99% of lodge operators (myself included) would have done the same type of thing had we been in that situation. You never know when you might need someone passing by to stop and give you some assistance so it's a good idea to offer a hand when you can. I remember those few days well. The worst sustained winds anyone could remember. It blew close to 50 MPH for almost 24 hours straight and only let up somewhat the next 24 hours. I wouldn't have wanted to be out on LOW in Noah's ark that day. If anyone's interested, here's a link to a page wiht some photos of what the storm did to our floating dock system in the Morson area. The wind blew in from the NE, so it was right on top of our location, which doesn't happen too often. We've handled 35-40 MPH winds, but 50 MPH from the NE seemed to the maximum rating as it were. I can't imagine those two guys out there in a small boat. YIKES!http://www.sportsmansresource.com/my.../windstorm.htm"
556237,rockpt,2006-04-15 21:22:00,589,"Thanks for posting those pics, Justin. They really show the effect of the storm. Now I recall that big blow. It happened just a few days before PJM, Eastwind and I came up for the annual fall trip."
556292,Whopper,2006-04-18 08:00:00,340,Great read. Second time I've read that and it's great to hear the two that survived and the people at Totem for helping. Whopper
556462,Guest,2006-04-24 19:10:00,0,Really a great story. I have been on a few search missions on that water and even though none were of that magnitude could easily have been. Big storms are bigger on the Woods. Appreciation to Eric and his people for great display of humanity.
