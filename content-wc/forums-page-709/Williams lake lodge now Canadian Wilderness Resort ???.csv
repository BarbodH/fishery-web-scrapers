556278,Guest,2006-04-17 16:59:00,0,Dont know if it is true about the sale....but I have found that new owners have a tendecy to be MORE service minded....after all they have just taken on some debt and NEED your business now and in the future....give them a chance.
556285,Guest,2006-04-17 21:32:00,0,Duh--thanks for the informative reply---next time I want an answer like that I'll just ask the wife. dan.
