556317,Guest,2006-04-18 19:34:00,0,All Right......Trout bite is almost guaranteed to be on. This certainly is the funnest time of my year thats for sure. If you fish Lake of the Woood or Crow Lake I use heavy action trout rods. On Manitou and smaller trout lake i like too use medium action rods this time of year just because of smaller trout.

Love that area, first year in a few that I haven't ice fished up there. Last year we hit Crow in mid-jan when it was 30-40 BELOW. I swore never again would I fish off a snowmobile when it's that cold unless it's in a shed on LOTW lol Todd"

556315,Guest,2006-04-18 19:26:00,0,"Todd, I don't get a chance to much durning summer months to fish for trout but in Spring I like to use any bronze or gold and silver spoons, but I do know a guy thats uses white tube baits and jigs them right into the end of August. Eric, I don't think I'd be worried about Manitou being out by end of month. I might even go up there sometimes this week. I like fishing in the current there in about 15-20ft. of water, at the boat launch."
