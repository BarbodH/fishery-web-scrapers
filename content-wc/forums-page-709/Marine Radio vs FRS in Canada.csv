Mainly for use in Canada but also for when I am on Mille Lacs, LOTW, etc. Here's where I need help, is a marine radio going to gain me a lot over a motorola handheld FRS radio? There are many islands where we fish in Canada. For the most part we are insight of each other but about 20% of the time we are not. Right now with the frs we can go about a 1.5 miles. If I new that a marine radio would double that it would be a done deal. Any info you have would be great, including what type of radio with a budget in mind. And I know not to skimp on the antenna. Thanks, Otts"
