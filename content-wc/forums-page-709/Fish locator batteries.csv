But I also have one of those small trickle charge units, and thought of buying some of those 6 volt rechargable battries they use on deer feeders so I could recharge at camp but never did due to the fact the battries last 2 trips."
556244,EyeBanger,2006-04-16 12:57:00,23,"On our annual Ontario trip, I take my portable fish locator, powered by two six-volt lantern batteries. I've heard that some people use small vehicle batteries, such as those in motorcycles, to power their portable fish locators. I'm all in favor of using fewer disposable items, (like six-volt batteries) and am considering using a motorcycle battery on my next trip. Question: Can anyone verify that these batteries will hold enough energy to power the fish locator for a week? I have no way of recharging the battery in camp. I am concerned that they are designed for situations in which they give short bursts of energy and then get recharged almost every time they are used, and therefore may not last for a week of draining with no recharging."
556245,retire55,2006-04-16 14:13:00,1029,"EyeBanger: Powering sonar units was discussed a little bit back in Jan 06 in another post - see https://www.walleyecentral.com/dc/dcb...=&page=#321090 How much power your sonar unit draws and how many hours per day you plan to use your sonar unit will allow you to calculate your power requirements (amp hour size of a deep cycle battery). I've been using a 35 amp hour deep cycle battery for 4 years to power a Lowrance X-85 on one week trips to remote lakes. The X-85 draws 400 milliamps per hour and I planned on 10 hours per day. Plus, I wanted some power in reserve, just in case. I wrote to Lowrance to ascertain the current draw of my unit."
556247,Pooch,2006-04-16 19:02:00,4619,"Couple of quick thoughts. Do the camp boats have electric start? If so use their starter batteries for juice and forget bringing batteries. This is what we do in one camp we fish. If they have pull start motors, does the engine have an alternater? One camp we fish does (Hondas) and some guys carry a very small rechargable and have a factory plug to use the boat motor alternator to keep it constantly charged up. Ask the camp operator if that is possible? Pooch"
556248,north_alabama,2006-04-16 19:53:00,172,"I use 12V 7AH rechargeable Gel Cell Batteries. I tested my unit (Eagle Fishmark 480) and got about 24 hours use per charged battery (backlight off). Last year on a 12 day trip where the sonar was on almost the entire time we were in the boat, I used 2 of these batteries, and the second had not run down. This type battery is commonly used in wheel chairs, so is pretty readily available, and cost about $17 (from Interstate). Cabelas sells them as well, I believe. They are about the same size as an 8-pack of D-cells, so if you have a portable sonar that expects 8 D-cells, the 7AH Gel Cell occupies the same volume. When you buy the battery, get an appropriate charger - gel cells have to be charged at a fairly low current (~10% of capacity or less) as too much current will damage the gel solution. Gel Cells are designed for steady discharge, and are not damaged by deep discharge, and I would recommend them over a motor starter battery. If you want a larger battery check out an electric trolling motor battery. Also, if you are so inclined, you can get a small solar cell charger and eek a little more time out of a single battery."
556257,515,2006-04-17 09:07:00,254,I use the same as north alabama and can usually get a full week out of one battery. They work well and last many years.

556260,retire55,2006-04-17 09:53:00,1029,"north_alabama According to Eagle, the FishMark 480 draws 350 milliamps per hour with the lights off. Consequently, at least from a theoretical perspective, a 12 volt 7 AH battery could power the Eagle FishMark 480 for 20 hours. For our group, that equilibrates to about 2 days of fishing. On a 12 day trip, I'd need 6 of those batteries where there wasn't any recharging capabilities. Let me emphasize that I'm not doubting your experience. Rather, I'm trying to highlight how important hours of planned fishing per day (with the sonar unit on) can impact sonar power requirements."
556261,grt1,2006-04-17 10:44:00,259,"Pick up a solar recharging unit at a Canadian Tire store when you come across the border, the one I have cost about $29 canadian and trickle charges the battery, I use it on my lawn tractor and skiff batteries. works well, and will work anyplace the sun shines."
556270,Guest,2006-04-17 13:19:00,0,"retire55, I called Eagle last year to get the current draw specs for the Eagle unit, and it calculated out to about what you state (don't recall the numbers). That being said, I tested my unit in a swimming pool and ran it 26 hours and the battery voltage remained above 9.9-10V (I think 10V is the cutoff on the low end.) I sampled the line with an RMS ammeter and typically read below ~0.275 mA. The charger I have charges the battery to 13-13.5V, so there is some extra capacity due to that. Having had some experience in the past with how electronics manufacturers spec current, let's just say they are not real concerned about being terribly precise. Typically the have a power ""budget"" so as long as they are under it, the budget normally becomes the ""spec"", regardless of what they might measure. Usually it's a not to exceed value that is useful for safely sizing wires, but not reflective of what a draw on a battery might be. However, having the same concern you state, I hauled 3 12V Gel Cells, and a D-cell pack with 2 sets of batteries. However, I only ran down one of the Gel Cells, and part of a second one. I did turn my unit off when we fished in the rain, and sometimes when we were casting or drifting bait rigs in a familiar spot. I didn't keep a log but I'm pretty sure I ran the unit at least 6-8 hours each day. I'd rather carry extra batteries and not use them than run out, but for anyone who would want to cut it as close as possible to save more weight for beer or whatever, maybe my data will help."
