Fall/Fort Francis because of the stealing going on, so we drive up to Dryden.Are you staying at hotel or driving straight to camp? 5 weeks to go!Doc"

556386,Guest,2006-04-21 14:33:00,0,"Hello Sidewinder, I am also going to Wabaskang that week...have been doing so for about 25 years. I have a lot of experience fishing for lake trout as well as Walleyes. I have have a lot of general knowledge of the area as well. I would be more than happy to chat with you. E-mail me your phone number and I'll give you a call. That offer goes for anyone else as well.[email protected] FYI..I stay at Jim and Julies Wabaskang camp which is about 15 miles south of your camp by boat. Tall Pines is about half way between us. Maybe we can get Doc to buy us a beer? In the spring I spend most of my time in the south end of the area. This year is the debut of a new Lund 2025 Pro v (maroon/pewter) w/250 Verado. You can't miss me I will be the one begging for gas. :) Also I am staying at the days inn in Intl falls on Friday the 26th. Brent"
