556483,iamwalleye1,2006-04-25 08:36:00,1589,It would be very nice if a resort! Like Bayview Put in a camera. The view from out of there bay is one of the best. Then we all could see!
556488,Guest,2006-04-25 09:49:00,0,Brian.......I love that lake...even when the fish aren't biting. The pike are big but not found in any great numbers there.
556489,Guest,2006-04-25 09:51:00,0,will be there in may... how will the fishing be then? will the walleyes be in the post spawn locations?
556496,Guest,2006-04-25 11:34:00,0,"Aaron do you have a boat in there ??? We put one in there years ago but we found it nessessary to hide it . Times we get there and the boat would be gone. Plus one time there was a pile of kids there and they were using the boats which is ok except they sunk one and left it. I've done some ugly portages before but that one takes the cake when the bugs are out, the ground was soaking, plus it's always 10 degrees warmer on that trail. Plus we carry in a 9.9 everytime. But that lake has become one of my fav's. everytime we fish we find a new spot that seems better then the last"
556500,Guest,2006-04-25 12:33:00,0,"Brian, I do have a boat hidden over there as I experianced the same problem you did. Also, I have a key for the boat that you always see chained up when you get to the lake, the boat is owned by one of our neighbors up on Harbour Is. Don't know if you know this but there is a much shorter and easier portage into that lake just to the SE of Harbour Island. If you have never portaged into Perch lake you should some time...many pike and lakers in that lake (smaller variety, greater numbers). Aaron"
556503,Guest,2006-04-25 13:06:00,0,"I knew there was a another portage and looking at the map it looked much shorter, but being Ukrainian we had to do it the hard way. I'll have to give that perch lake a look over this weekend if we make it out. Our boat house ramp had a short in it as we got the ramp out of the water so until I figure out what's what it could be a ****ty weekend."
556506,Guest,2006-04-25 14:18:00,0,Good luck!
556511,Bears Fan,2006-04-25 14:49:00,30,That would cost money Bill. Aint gonna happen. LOL.
556368,Redtail5998,2006-04-20 19:06:00,34,I was just wondering if ice out has occured at Minaki. If so when was it.
556374,Guest,2006-04-20 22:16:00,0,"It's out, received a call a couple of days ago, we're heading up Monday"
556383,Guest,2006-04-21 12:58:00,0,Did they say anything about the ice on Big Sand. Was hoping this weekend to get into the trout lake
556388,Guest,2006-04-21 15:06:00,0,"The trout lake being ""Vermillion""? If so, it's also the home of monster pike."
556392,Guest,2006-04-21 16:54:00,0,"It's off of Rough Rock, Big Sand should be open, Cygnet lake is open, it's not part of the Winnipeg"
556407,Guest,2006-04-23 10:13:00,0,have you been on Cygnet this year? is the water level up?
556408,Guest,2006-04-23 10:44:00,0,The water level is about normal for this time of year.
556409,Guest,2006-04-23 18:15:00,0,do you fish Cygnet much? i am going back for the first time in 2 years. been going 16 years straight before that.
556427,Guest,2006-04-24 10:33:00,0,"I guess you could say I live here. With that being said, I look forward to seeing you again this summer."
556430,Guest,2006-04-24 11:27:00,0,"Before I knew that lake had pike , we were trolling when my rod bent right over and went from 100' behind the boat right up to the front. It didn't seem like a trout fight at all , but I never caught anything but trout in that lake before. Once in it measured to be 48"" , and thick. Since then we have caught a few more pike , and your right that lake is home of monster pike. We went for suckers this weekend but next weekend I'll be in that lake at least 4 -5 times before the trout go deep"
