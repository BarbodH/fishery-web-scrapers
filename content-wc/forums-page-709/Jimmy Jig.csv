Have you heard anything about ice out yet. Sounds like it will be earlier than normal? Going to order a Canada lakes map chip from Lowrance for my GPS. Jim"

I'm a little nervouse about all the bad reviews it is getting. I'll know more after I try it this weekend. Also looked at the Navionis Canada chip and am waiting to see what the guys think of it this summer. I'll have to stop over and get your input when we're up there...if you don't mind. Otts"
556359,Jimmy Jig,2006-04-20 11:14:00,1905,"Otts, No the chip I'm talking about is Lowrance's. Its the good paper maps on a chip. No depth markings. $99. Its on the LEI site on the web. The one you are talking about is $150., but I'm not sure how detailed the marking are? LEI chip also has the part of Manitoba I fish also. Stop over anytime and we will compare notes. Yes, the 334 sounds like trouble, 25% are returned to Cablela's."
