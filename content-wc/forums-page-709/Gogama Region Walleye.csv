This lake is fishing by people for walleye, with smallies and northerns (and the occasional whitefish) being an added bonus. However, I'm no walleye fisherman. I fish once a year, on this trip! I go for a good time with my friends and brothers-in-law. My father-in-law goes for the walleye and he's no expert either, but he's got the patience of a sniper and doesn't care if he gets skunked. But most people leaving this lake as we come in say they're killing Â‘em. We get there are like one-legged men in an arse kicking contest. We can't keep the bass and northern out of the boat, and they're very nice size. The lake is clear but very golden/bronze. Rocky like all lakes in this region, maybe 20 feet at it's deepest point. Water is usually cool, but not enough to keep us from jumping in for a shower, at least the majority of the years. There was one year where we accidentally came across walleye in a bay where the wind was blowing into shore and the weather sucked. We did well drifting with rattle traps, vibrax and rapalas. But that was dumb luck and that situation has never been replicated. I'm looking for some simple pointers. I managed to find where another group was fishing on the lake last year and from a distance noticed them using Rapala like cranks and slow trolling near the shoreline. They were doing well. I tried and had some luck after they vacated. Basically, the weather is pretty constant, making finding fish tough (for a knucklehead like me). Given the water temps, clarity and often calm waters or minor 1-2 foot waves, it makes early season walleye tough for amateurs! My assumptions without reading extensively is that they're in shallower waters, maybe to 10 feet, feeding and waiting for the spawn? Again, my guess. Just given the overall size of the lake and small boats and motors, we can't cover much space so we need a better way to reduce our areas of interest and limit the chase. Also, any special techniques are helpful based on the characteristics of the lake I've outlined."

Basic advice might be to fish near any moving water (rivers, creeks) that dump into your lake, and up into them if possible. Next any mudflat areas nearby. Jig and minnow or spinner rigs should work. Minnows seem to work better in the spring than crawlers or leeches. Once you locate some fish they should be fairly concentrated."
