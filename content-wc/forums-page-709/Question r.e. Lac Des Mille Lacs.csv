Along the way I've heard bits and pieces that at one time the lake experienced a substantial decline, but now with protective slots is at least somewhat on the rebound. I was just wondering if anyone out there is familiar with the recent history of the lake and would be willing to share any details about the relative health of the lake over time, and opinions on how far it has rebounded. Thanks."

Have always practiced catch and release on the larger fish, even back when everyone thought we were nuts for doing so. We have only kept walleyes, releasing all the notherns and the occassional smallmouth (of which there are now many more than in the earlier years. Total numbers have been fairly consistent, though more larger fish now that the limit has been reduced substantially and a slot put into effect. And, we are catching the largest fish, on average, that we have ever caught. As we have always been there the last of June into mid-July, fishing can be very weather dependent and tied to air temps, May fly hatches, water temps, etc. Generally speaking, we've eaten fresh fish when we wanted to, but it does require fishing different techniques in different areas and there are days when we still struggle, which is probably due to my lack of fishing ability. We have traditionally made long runs to get away from the masses but with gas prices being what they are, that may have to change. Lake of the Woods it isn't, but we enjoy it and hope to be able to make the trip for many years to come. It is a long haul to get away from the Texas heat, but the lake has provided many wonderful memories for our family. Hopefully it will do the same for you. Planocat"
556381,Guest,2006-04-21 12:07:00,0,I have fished Lac since the late 70s. The lake is healthier now than it ever has been. This last winters fishing was exceptional. OMNR has done a great job keeping water levels up for the spawn in the last ten years. This along with area wide limit reduction has made the lake a world class fishery.
