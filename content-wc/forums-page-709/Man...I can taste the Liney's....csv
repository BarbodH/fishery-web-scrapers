All beer is good even the Canadian beer. Just some beer is better than others. Hey after 4 beers I'm just renting it. By the way if you ever get to Eau Claire, Ws. and don't stop at the brewery shame on you! The tap room is always open for a free sample, even with out a tour!"

556151,Guest,2006-04-11 17:03:00,0,"Rob, Havent you heard? Canada is cancelled for the year because of high Gasoline prices and it taking so much time to cross the border, especially if you have a DWI. Not to mention that some of the Resort owners may have to raise prices to cover new overheads. What is this world coming too????? By the way if you decide to cancel because of all the hassel I will take your reservation."
556183,Guest,2006-04-12 20:38:00,0,I bet the new NO lead weights and jigs regulations will make lots of guys cancel also!!!
