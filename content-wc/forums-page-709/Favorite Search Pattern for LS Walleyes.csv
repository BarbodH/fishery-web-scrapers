I tend to Lindy Rig alot and wonder if I should speed it up or change presentation. A friend went up there last year and did really well casting to shore in 2-4 feet of water. I fish mainly the east side and am there early June, late June, and now this year mid July. Thanks, Otts"

This gives us the opportunity to cover water faster and when we find some fish we will stop and jig. When doing this you also get a chance to watch your depth and locate structure such as drops or ledges that might concentrate fish. Normally we pick windy areas for this tactic as the wind seems to be your best friend when you are finding fish on LS. I like to use cranks that will actually hit the bottom when we are dragging them and my favorite colors are Perch, Char,Orange and Silver/Blue and my favorite June depths are 6' to 12'. The only drawback to dragging cranks or bottom bouncers is that it normally requires aggressive fish to respond to this tactic. But if you get hooked up you can do well jigging. Over our years on LS we have found some great spots this way and they yield fish for us year after year. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
