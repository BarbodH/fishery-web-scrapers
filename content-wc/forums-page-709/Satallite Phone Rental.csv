Emergencies or problems at the lake they want to know about and don't charge you for those calls. They've got some great fishing as well, check them out.www.lmflyin.com"

553262,Guest,2005-12-12 07:21:00,0,Has anyone ever rented a Satallite phone for use on a fly-in or other remote Canada trip. There are a few guys in my group that need to be in contact with work at all times. Any suggestions on a company to use and the cost was for the week?
553265,phishfearme,2005-12-12 09:02:00,1242,"dave - i rented an iridium phone a few years ago and it was very expensive for the rental, shipping and minutes BUT looking at the web site, looks like you can rent one for $40 to $90 a week with $1.80 per minute charges at:http://www.satellitephonestore.com/s...OVMTC=standard this doesn't seem too bad conpared to what i paid a few years ago which was about 4 times this amount. they worked remarkably well. you may want to ask your outfitter if they have one to borrow - many do. phish"
553269,Guest,2005-12-12 11:31:00,0,We rented a phone several times from a company in Florida. If I remember correct the coast was like $150.00 per week pluse user time and two way shipping. Can't remember name of company from which we rented phone. Phone worked great. Look on the web.
553272,hoosiercanadian,2005-12-12 14:43:00,104,"Rented one this past June, was in a remote part of Manitoba, it didn't want to keep a signal when it was cloudy, and you get charged when it is roaming for a signal, I unfortunately let my kids make a breif call to say hi to their friends, and I had to use it as well for business, it ended up costing me over $1,400 for 10 days. I will never rent another one! You can rent one cheap enough, you just can't use it."
553285,Guest,2005-12-13 09:43:00,0,"Our outfitter, Chimo Lodge, rents them for $100/week + airtime. We take it for insurance should someone need to be flown out due to injury."
553289,Guest,2005-12-13 22:36:00,0,dave- i have rented a phone last two years from site on the web with extra battery- used it every other day and cost total about $125 for the week- i will look up receipt and give you company name - worked great and we split the cost between 4 of us- well worth it
553302,Guest,2005-12-14 16:17:00,0,I've rented sat phones the last 4 years. The cost has come WAY down. You should be able to get a phone for the week for around $50 and spend less than $2 per min for airtime. I've used Satellite outfitters out of TN. Brett
