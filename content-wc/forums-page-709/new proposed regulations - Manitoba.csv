556300,River_eye,2006-04-18 09:58:00,1486,"Only problem is, how do you restrict people to one 28""+ Walleye a year? Sounds good in theory, but does it work?"
556301,Guest,2006-04-18 10:10:00,0,"Maybe it is time to devise a new method to tournament fishing for these types of situations. Do something like measure length, not weight, put a judge in each boat, measure the fish, snap a digital photo, and release it. Will make the weigh-in somewhat anti-climactic, but with some creative thinking and openmindedness from the tournament governing bodies it could be done. I believe walleyes carted around in a live well for extended periods have pretty low long-term survival prospects anyway."
556307,Guest,2006-04-18 13:15:00,0,"I agree that fishing tournaments place unnessessary stress on fish to be released . I don't have number to back it up , but I would bet it is a very small percentage of anglers in MB that actally take part in fishing tounements. If Mb master angler award system can accept a picture of a fish to earn your badge, why can't tounements. With any other reason then it's not the same thing as holding a fish up. It shouldn't be laws for some , and some for others. If you want to even have a chance to take on the commercial fishery ( slim chance ) at least be able to say your doing your whole part in conservation. Growing up as a kid the limit was 8 walleye, and I'm sure there was no size restriction, and those nunbers on the water systems in question were not that hard to obtain. For my kids I don't want to tell them how it was , I want to show them"

556351,Guest,2006-04-19 23:57:00,0,"IN the 80's Manitoba Conservation told us the slot limits were geared to let all the small walleye go. It took the doofis's 15 years to figure out that they were wrong, and you have to save the big fish to sustain populations. Sorry , the science shows clearly that big fish are the most important to save so I don't know what the whining is about by Stapon and others."

556355,Guest,2006-04-20 10:03:00,0,"If you are worried about fish mortality, ""read this"" A few years ago we took a film crew on a snowmobile trip to shoot some footage to promote the area. Travelled some nice trails, ended up going accros Lake Winnipeg. About half way accros the lake we ran into some commercial fishermen from the area. The crew decided to stop and take some footage of the guys as they pulled their nets. I sat back on my sled and watched, the film crew got pretty excited with the fish that were in the net, you should have seen the hogs.... This display made me sick, real sick, when you see this 1st hand, it really hits home. Two or three years ago a group of us went four wheeling up a small river off Lake Winnipeg called the Sand River. Fishing was not in season, if I remember correctly it was about the 1st week in May. As we approached one part of the river we stopped, there were a few guys in there scooping spawning greenbacks... again I sat back watched in shock. As our group travelled up the river the real shocker was revealed, nets upon nets spanning the width of the river. I'm going up there this weekend again, this time I'm bringing my digital. If the spawn is on you can bet the nets will be out... this will make you sick. Remember this is only one river, here are some others, Manigatogan River, Little Black River, O'hanly River... get your map out and count them. Remember everyone, catch and release tournaments provide economic impact to small towns that that have a limited population base. When our government has there way, make sure you bring your own gas for your boat, don't forget your bait, make sure you have your tent, oh ya if you like a cocktail better bring that to. It takes 12 months of the year to make a business viable keep taking the months away and you figure it out. This is just ANOTHER example of our government regulating small business out of business."
556358,Todd_NE,2006-04-20 10:59:00,1330,"Great Post Laurent, I always try to be respectful to the resource there and I know you and 99% of people are. You also have a wonderful business and go out of your way to help everyone. Lord knows I like a Gibson's, Wiser's or Kokanee when I'm in Manitoba. Can you ship me some warm foccaccia and some scallops by the way :) Not many walleye fisherman have seen, much less caught 10, 12, 14, 15, 15, 17# walleyes. ALMOST everyone that has spent much time on the Red or Winnipeg has. You think you have a pig when you catch a 7, 8 or maybe a 10? Hold up a 14 sometime, net a 13 for someone else, put a friend on 4 over 10 in a day. Your legs shake, your heart beats 200 times a minute, you get woozy, you lose all focus. It's an experience. It dramatically raises your appreciation and awe for this resource when you've HELD a majestic ""greenback"" like this. For many people, it literally becomes the goal of all goals every year to fish that water. Many walleye anglers go their whole lives never to see a 8 or 10# walleye, much less these beasts. I've missed it once in 11 years, the worst year of my life, and that's no kidding. There will be a day when I can afford and have the time to spend every late September through early November in the area, and I can't wait. Laurent is going to have to run a monthly special for me. But, like so many anglers, it seems preposterous to me to go after the sport fisherman and let one guy with a net in the river slaughter 100 angler's lifetime of trophy's in a day or two. Take what has been said here and IMAGINE it's YOUR lake somewhere here in the states. Imagine commercial nets two miles long, clogging entire rivers, etc. chock full of huge walleyes. I know this has happened in some places and you and I also know it's led to some dramatic showdowns, most of which never made the papers. This is one of the most celebrated walleye fisheries in the world and there can be a balance of netting vs. sport fishing. But right now, it doesn't look like it's being sought. A ""You All"" Todd"

556215,Guest,2006-04-14 01:56:00,0,"I would argue the opposite, Dually. I believe replicas looks just as good, last longer, and are cheaper. I have seen a couple replicas that I don't think were done as well as others, but all in all, a much better option over a skin mount. Much less fuss, cheaper and you know you are helping the fishery. If you have had mounts that looked nothing like the fish you caught, I would suggest going elsewhere to get your work done, because there are plenty of companies making replicas that could pass for the real thing. NWO Fishing Bum"
556218,Guest,2006-04-14 11:01:00,0,I am from Manitoba. I think it is a great idea . There is no need for someone to keep a fish that large.
556222,Guest,2006-04-14 14:09:00,0,"This is the problem....What will happen to the two major tournaments in the area. To hold a fish and release the fish is not allowed, it is considered in your posetion. Therefore no fish even though it will be released can be kept over 70cm. ""This proposed law the way it reads will all but eliminate tournaments in the area"" It goes without saying the economic blow to the town of Pine Falls will be drastic. To catch a trophy and take a pic is good enough for me, to catch a large female weigh it in and release it is not asking to much and is a compromise that has to happen. Sanctioned tournaments must have the option of weighing in these fish or tournaments are dead. My family owns the Papertown Motor Inn and the Manitou lodge, far to often the Mantioba government rams regulations down our thoat that drastically affect our business. ""This is another reg. of many that have happend over the last few years"" What would happen to the KBI in Kenora if the Ontario Government passed a law stating no bass over 12"" could be in your possetion. Think of the blow to Kenora....Its the same here only it could be a reality for 2007. Its easy to say this is good, but think of the ramafications before you judge. Talked to Craig Stapon about this issue the other day and he brought up another senario I hadn't thought of yet. ""What happens if you catch a world record Walleye ? "", guess you throw it back so it ends up in somebodies net....."
556223,Todd_NE,2006-04-14 16:14:00,1330,"Perfect World No gill netting Catch and Release only for big fish However, the one over 28"" per season is a fine restriction in my mind. It also keeps the tourneys, recreation, and everything else going. There are a LOT of dollars pumped into the area. Too bad we can't pump some of those dollars into some help for the ramps and the like, but oh well. I KNOW the group of guys I've went to the Red/Winnipeg for 10 years now has kept ONE fish over 28"". The guy who did so drove straight through all the way from SW Kansas and his first walleye in his whole life was 14.5# (the absolute truth). He saw all the gill nets in the bay and said why throw it back, it would probably swim into one of those things. If you can't tell, it still bothers me... but it was a strange circumstance and I'm happy for the guy that has it. Catch and release or not, I'll come up. But I do worry for guys like Laurent, guides, tourney organizers, other lodge owners, etc. I try to imagine the fishery WITHOUT NETTING FOR TEN YEARS but I have to stop. But I'm fat and getting old and I don't want to stroke out before Easter. Todd October Resident of Manitoba"

556258,Guest,2006-04-17 09:09:00,0,Just wondering while on the topic of tourny fishing. What happened last year at the gary Roach clasic with American's only allowed 2 fish at Minaki ?
556268,Guest,2006-04-17 12:46:00,0,Release them. I am from Minnesota and every year we go up to Flin Flon to fish. We always release the bigger fish caught. I have a graphite made of a walleye that I wouldn't trade for any fish mounted by a taxidermist...
556186,rtmg,2006-04-12 22:06:00,34,"There is a new proposed regulation for the province of Manitoba, that is causing a real stir. Basically the new reg will be that for the Red River & Winnipeg River (Pine Falls) no fish over 70cms (28 inch) maybe be kept. Making this story short, there is a petition etc being started to stop this. Question, what is your view ? Good Fishen Rob"
556188,Guest,2006-04-13 02:02:00,0,"What's the problem? I don't see what the stir is all about. Nobody catching a fish that size should be keeping it now, and nobody should have been keeping them all through the 70's either (which caused the plight of many fisheries-severe harvesting of the main reproducers). If there's a problem, it's that over 70cm isn't good enough. I would rather see nothing over 50 cm, or nothing over 45 cm!! The best meals are made with walleyes 30-45 cm anyway. And there is absolutely no justification for skin mounts anymore, none. So there is no reason why this proposed change should stir anybody. NWO Fishing Bum"
556192,mrwalleye5,2006-04-13 08:33:00,1922,"Exactly, save a fish, buy a digital camera. W5"
556193,VMS,2006-04-13 08:44:00,1103,"I would agree...no need to keep a fish of that size at all. Plus, with a fish of that size, you would be getting the highest concentration of PCB's, Mercury, and other pollutants that the fish has ingested if you bring it to the frying pan. About the only argument I could even fathom on keeping an extremely large fish is the ""Possible"" situation that the fish is past it's most productive spawning age, and thus is not a significant contributor to replenishing the population, and if allowed to spawn, could actually hinder the population since the eggs may never hatch/develop. That said, it is NOT what I would practice, but one possible argument against a length limit. I would have no clue if there is proof of this happening, so it is more tongue and cheek...not a fact... Steve"
556194,River_eye,2006-04-13 09:39:00,1486,"I think the recreational anglers should just swallow it. The rec anglers always complain about the commercial netting, whether it be lake Winnipeg or LOTW, and they have to realize that if anything is going to be restricted first, it's the rec fishing. Maybe if they agree to strict regulations, they'll have a small chance in He11 to impose more strict commercial netting regs. Also, I don't know how many eggs in those big fish are viable, but seeing as they did make it that big, I would assume they have the superior genetics, so one of their ""fertile"" eggs is worth more than one from a 20 "" fish."
556195,toby,2006-04-13 09:41:00,49,Great idea--save the spawners
556199,Dave Q,2006-04-13 11:02:00,1003,Im in Sask. and agree 100% and maby it should be an even smaller size limit. All you have to do is look at the river run in the fall at Tobin to see how a fishery can collaps when all the big fish are killed.
