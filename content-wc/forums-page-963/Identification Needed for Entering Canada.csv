519896,Dave S,2002-05-06 13:21:00,314,I am looking at fishing in NW Ontario this summer with my three teenage sons. Do I need to go to the expense of getting US passportsfor my sons or will a photo ID and certified birth certificate work? We will be driving across the North Dakota border toward Winnepegg. Before the 9/11 incident I am pretty sure you could get by with just a certified birth certificate. My wife is concerned that things may have changed so asking folks on this board who have crossed the boarder recently. Any links to websites spelling out current Canadian entry Identification requirments? None of us have any DUI violations so that is not an issue.

519898,iamwalleye1,2002-05-06 17:52:00,1589,You will need there birth certificate . You will also have to prove they are you kids. They will not let you cross if you can't. My friend had a family picture with the birth certificate and that worked. The nice thing about a passport is the takes all the guessing out of it and they are good for 10 years. I wish you and you family good luck!

Couple of years ago, a man and his son were held at the border until mom could be reached. Steve"
519900,Dave S,2002-05-07 10:29:00,314,Thanks for the replies. My wife is planning on going with us so that will not be an issue. I think a passport application fee is around $60 -$65 plus the cost of the photo x two sons who do not have passports. I am not aware of any other out of the country trips they might take so thinking I can save around $140 if birth certificates and photo ID's are satisifactory.

According to U.S./Canadian Customs, if you are all U.S. citizens, all you need are birth certificates to cross the border in either direction. You DON'T need passports.Some years I remember to bring the envelop with all our birth certificates, some years I forget it (no one was asking, so...). The one trip that I was asked if I had them was one of the years I didn't bring them. I was told to be sure to remember them next time (I do).If your wife is going with you, you won't need the spousal permission paper mentioned. That's to prevent a parent involved in a divorce from fleeing the U.S. to avoid child custody laws. I always have that, but have never been asked to show it."
519902,Dave S,2002-05-07 20:34:00,314,Karl: Thanks for sharing your personal experiences with me on crossing the board with you family. I would much rather spend the money for fishing bait for the week vs giving the US Govenment the money for two passports if they are not required. :)
