I know from talking to other guys that the weather up there in May can be anything from nice and warm to several inches of snow over nite. Take some warm clothes. Expect great fishing! We exclusively troll for walleyes, Worm harnesses or stickbaits. What outfitter will you be staying with? Buy a map of your fishing area at the last general store you come to before getting to the reservoir. Lots of bays and shoreline that all looks the same. Sorry, I don't know anything about the bearhunting. scoot"
