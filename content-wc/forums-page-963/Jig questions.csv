I have read a lot about best size and colors on Lac Seul, but I would like to know about some other things like... Do you use curly tails w/ or w/o minnows. With what kind of results? If fishing w/ minnow only, no curly tail, does it matter much if you use jigs w/ a barbed collar or a ""live bait"" jig head w/ no collar? Again, any input is appreciated."
519783,Walleye Wacker,2002-05-04 19:57:00,6,"Been fishing Lac Seul for 30 years and have tried every style of jig blessed by the Fishing Gods. The last few years have had the best luck with Leechs on the lightest jig that you can get to the bottom with and the colors that seem to produce the best are Char,Orange,Yellow and White. I normally fish with ball jigs collared or uncollared and dont use twisters. I like twisters in current but not for lake structure fishing. I make my own jigs and paint some of them half one color and half another. Have had good luck with Char/Orange and Orange/White. Have also found Marabou jigs with contrasting head and body colors work well. I cut Marabou back so only 1/4 inch of feathers extend beyond back of hook. I think the most important part of jig fishing is fishing slow,keeping in touch with bottom and never,never,never have slack in your line. This way you can feel the softest bite and the slight pressure of a hanger Walleye. Lac Seul is a giant lake and depending on when you are going patterns can vary. Talk to other fisherman and your outfitter and find out what pattern is working when you are there. The wind is your friend on Lac Seul. You will catch fish by fishing on windy side of structure and paying special attention to ledges and drop offs. Fish slow and methodical and no slack. Lac Seul will reward patience and attentivness to detail with some fine Walleye. Its a big Lake and you should have a good depth finder and a GPS can be a must....Good Luck Catch and Release"

519785,Walleye Wacker,2002-05-05 15:13:00,6,Have caught Walleye on Leechs startimg opening day until freeze. When you put them on place the hook in the top of their head with their mouth facing up. They dont like being upside down and they will give you better action. Good Luck

I use 1/4 oz. jigs with a worm on the end if that helps. orange and bgight green or yellow are good colors to try."
