By doing this they have ID from every one in the vehicle. Then they also ask the standard questions about beer, cigs and bait. If there are 5 of you in the vehicle you will all have to have your ID's ready. They also run the plates from the tow vehicle. In case you want to know the check they run is called a ""triple I ""jimbo"

519378,RK,2002-04-30 04:57:00,35,"Hi Gang,This past winter I wrote an article on the border crossing issue for Esox Angler, where I'm the Associate Editor. I'll see if I can add a little to what's been said already: - According to Canadian Immigration, they aren't 'getting tougher' at all. The laws regarding admissability have been on the books basically unchanged for decades. What has changed is their access to US criminal records. It's a matter of technology not policy. Also have to say that their increased use of US information is largely at the request of the US government, and is a result of US concerns over Canadian immigrant policies. (Even when it's about taking a fishing trip, it's not just about a fishing trip, and you don't have to dig very deep into the issue before you hit a layer of pure politics...) This is something that began well before 9/11, but has obviously gotten a lot of press since then. - When considering the admissability status of a potential visitor, any past offenses are treated as though they had been committed in Canada. Something that may be a misdemeanor in your home state may be a felony in Canada - the main one causing problems for those crossing the border being a DUI or DWI, which is a felony up north. - As of about March, those with a record wanting to visit Canada can apply for what they call Criminal Rehabilitation once 5 years have passed from the end of any imposed penalty (probation or what have you.) Applying for rehabilitation requires filling out a fairly lengthy form, and of course, paying a $200 (Canadian) fee. This process can take, by Canadian Immigration's own admission, up to six months, so plan ahead. - Those with more serious records will need to apply for what is known as a Minister's Permit. The process is a little more involved, and costs $800, which is non-refundable if you are declared inadmissable. - Those with more recent offenses (or someone with an offense within the last 5 years) can apply for and receive special permission to enter Canada. This involves filling out the Criminal Rehabilitation form and paying the $200 fee. The application will be reviewed by an immigration official, who can allow entry for a 30 day period, require the application to apply for a Minister's Permit (with the accompanying fee) or deny entry altogether. Applications for special permission are approved or not entirely at the disgretion of the immigration official that reviews your file. - You can apply for entry on the spot at a port of entry, but only if there is an immigration officer present, and that's not always the case at some crossing points especially during the night or on weekends. You are much much better off starting the process ahead of time by contacting Canadian immigration or your nearest Canadian consulate. They wouldn't say so officially of course, but the immigration people I spoke to felt that your odds of being allowed entry were much better if you made an effort to follow the rules ahead of time rather than trying to ""sneak over,"" getting caught, then applying after the fact. - I have heard as well that there are some changes in the works for how the admissability rules are enforced. Canadian immigration has received a great deal of pressure from camp operators over the issue, and with good reason - losing even a few groups each summer because they turned back when one of their party was declared inadmissable is a pretty big hit to the wallet. I have not heard specifics on what the changes will be.If you want to read the article from Esox Angler, you can find it at: http://www.muskies101.com/artclvisitingneighbors Hope this provides a little more info to you all. As I said, it's a pretty complex issue...Cheers,RK"
519379,Guest,2002-05-05 11:39:00,0,bunk. have a good time. be honest and as long as you didnt run someone down on a dwi canada will not bother you. this is a contrived bunch of crap. yeah they can do it...stop you...but they could 10 years ago. just behave well as you go over and behave well as you enjoy your trip. duh. enuff of this thread
519380,Guest,2002-05-06 05:59:00,0,"have another beer and get another DUI and then worry about the consequences, isn't that how it goes."
519381,Karl,2002-05-06 12:47:00,63,Wouldnt you guys be better off not drinking and driving? If you could accomplish that you would probably have more money for fishing trips and there would be less grave stones of people killed by drunk drivers.
519366,jimbo,2002-04-21 16:19:00,223,"They run every persons ID. ie Driver license, passport etc"
519359,Guest,2002-04-21 17:29:00,0,Thanks 157 and the same to you in the upcoming season. I had to take customer appreciation for my new job(took it twice...I failed the first time) LOL
519367,Guest,2002-04-22 11:35:00,0,"Hey Jimbo, If they ran everyones license that crossed the border there would be a line of cars from Fort Frances to Mason city Iowa!"
519368,Guest,2002-04-22 11:43:00,0,"PeteBy processing at the border do you mean that you can pay the 200.00 fee if allowed? Also, can you do this on the weekend? Thanks"
519369,Guest,2002-04-22 15:59:00,0,"just talked to immigrations in Ft Frances today and they strongly recommend filing the IMM 1444 Form (Criminal Rehabilitation Form).If you send it to the customs office where you plan to cross, I would suggest contacting them before hand and get specific instructions from them as to whose attention you should send your papers. Also let them know exactly when your trip is planned (in writing) so if it is not completely processed before you go they can verify the stage you are in. Bring copies of everything you send them for your proof of filing. This does not guarantee you clear access yet.If your dui is over 15 years old the courthouse of conviction (a minnesota thing)may have purged your info that you need to include with the completed form.I don't think they will allow any rehab admittance if your violation is not yet 5 years old either. (just guessing on this, but that's what I heard them say.)It is also true that as of June 28, 2002 (we're going on June 25-ouch) they will only check back 10 years.The cost for the Rehab filing fee is $200.00 Canadian.Good Luck Guide#7 out"
519370,phidelt157,2002-04-23 05:49:00,191,"are you just guessing on that, or is that what you heard them say? (rehab 5 years or less)"
519371,Guest,2002-04-28 10:24:00,0,"ok phidelt, here's the scoop. The Canadians are actually very friendly people, even the immigrations people, if you talk straight to them and don't slant your story. Just spoke directly to one of the main fellas last week for some rulings and the 5 year old conviction rule is true. Here's a twist, they start the 5 year clock only after you have fully completed your sentence requirements. (If you lose your drivers license for 1,2 or 3 years the clock starts ticking only after you get it back.) This does not necessisarily mean you can't go to Canada though. They will allow for temp. access permits (not a guarantee) for each trip you take. Make sure to be ready with D.L., birth cert. and any violation documents to show them when you enter. They will not allow total conviction rehabilitation until the 5 year cycle is complete and then you can submit the rehab. paperwork. The rehab. and temp. access processes both cost, of course.Rehab. application cost is $200.00 canadian and i think temp. permits will also cost the $200.00 canadian. My 20 year old violation will be wiped off their system when the June 28, law goes into affect, but I sent my application in to clear me for trips before then.Gotta go fishin' guide#7 out"
519372,Guest,2002-04-28 12:54:00,0,"Guide #7 Can you tell me if they can, or will process temporary permits on the weekend or just M - F. Thanks"
519374,Guest,2002-04-29 07:26:00,0,I heard 5yrs or sooner no admitance 5-10 yrs rehab permit and after june 28th 10 or more years slate clean? P.s. Do they or do they not ask every vehicle about any prior convictions?
519377,phidelt157,2002-04-29 08:05:00,191,New to me....thanks for your info and help.157
519352,PJM,2002-04-19 20:58:00,3516,Canadian Guy Every time I see your name on a post I enjoy reading your responce. Keep up the good work

519363,Guest,2002-04-20 05:40:00,0,Pardon me you should never lie to a custom officer.You should do whatever you have to do to get across border. Nuker your the Man!!but I bet someone will give you #### about drinking that beer.
519364,Pete,2002-04-20 14:00:00,35,I run a camp in Sask. and was just acrost the border a couple weeks ago and had a long talk with immigration (customs don't handle your DUI) After June 28 (thanks to the outfitters associations) all DUI'Sand criminal records over 10 years old won't matter. Also they are processing people at the border again where they stopped for a while after 911
519354,phidelt157,2002-04-20 16:03:00,191,"Ya, CanadianGuy....you're opinions are always thoughtful and credible, your list of friends must be unmeasureable."
519355,Guest,2002-04-20 16:20:00,0,Greetings Phidelt 157 .....I'm glad you are still alive and well and adding your wit to Walleye Central. I am also alive and well having recently been employed by OPG( Ontario Power Generation). Seems my doodling in Computers and my strong Canadian values have not gone unnoticed. I look forward to your posts and your American wit. Stay well. By the way if need a reference if you get jailed running the border with your DUI buddies.......post here at Walleye Central and I'll see what I can do. I cannot promise anything but I can vouch for your attitude. LOL
519356,Guest,2002-04-20 17:02:00,0,Oh......... I forgot Phidelt 157....OPG means ...cash for life. Its a french thing....hee..hee..hee. Its Canadian humour so if you need an interpretation please post.
519357,phidelt157,2002-04-20 18:43:00,191,"CanadianGuy:It's good to hear you found a job. In reference to your previous post, I never really left WC, just didn't want to continue a worthless debate that strayed away from it's original meaning. I have directed my posts towards other threads, that's all. For those of you who are unclear, CanadianGuy seems to think that I am going to try to smuggle some illegals into the country. This is not true and never was. The issue has worked itself out (I won't bore you with the details) but it's not something you will have to lose any more sleep over. Hope all is well, and I wish you good luck in the upcoming season.157"
519358,River_eye,2002-04-20 23:43:00,1486,I love it! :7 You two are better than Laurel and Hardy
519365,Guest,2002-04-21 14:08:00,0,Does anyone know if it helps to have a passport instead of just a driver's license. Can they take any further action beyond refusing entrance for just a DUI? What are the odds of them just charging the fee and letting you through (as opposed to turning you back)if you do get questioned and tell them of a DUI? Do they run your license plates on the vehicle and can they see DUI info from this? Any help would be greatly appreciated... FISH ON!!!
519345,Guest,2002-04-16 20:08:00,0,"I was wondering if anyone has received a dui pardonto enter Canada? I have a friend that has sent forone, and our trip in june is in desperate need of him getting it. thanks in advance."
519346,Guest,2002-04-17 07:04:00,0,dont get caught up in a major b.s. issue. there is some sort of bizarre crossing regulation that is usually overlooked unless you look and act like osama. its too late now if you're really serious to get one so just make some sort of back up plan for aborting. canada also is in the process of altering the regs a bit to ease peoples minds and thats supposed to take effect in june sometime so i doubt they'll make an issue of it. just be cool-they probably wont hassle you. read back a few pages and you see all the lunacy that got stirred up over this ridiculous issue when everyone was bored in the winter.
519348,Guest,2002-04-17 12:51:00,0,Cueman: It took my buddy 3 months to get his returned to him....when did your friend apply? Walleyechieftan......I'm glad you think it's a BS issue....it's certainly not for anyone who's been turned back! Lunacy stirred up???? It's not lunacy if it affects YOUR trip or your best fishin buds trip who's riding with you!!
519349,Guest,2002-04-17 13:19:00,0,"I've found a little lie goes along way if they ask if you have a DUI conviction say no what can they do,if they find out you do send you to Nam! No they'll send you back to the USA Here what we do we don't let the guy who has the DUI drive the car. Don't answer any more than you have to."
519350,jimbo,2002-04-17 19:37:00,223,I can tell you how they find out. When you cross the border now they ask for the drivers license from everyone in the vehicle. They then go inside and run a national check where your DUI will show up. I know that one person said he did not have a drivers license and they would not let him in until they had a photo ID. I work in the COP shop so trust me they will find out.Jimbo
519347,Guest,2002-04-18 11:51:00,0,"This is not a BS issue. My good fishing buddy was turned away in early Feb. He had a DWI in 1990. They asked us for our drivers license and ran the numbers. Over 20 years we had been across the border at least 100 times and had never been checked so I don't think we looked suspicious. Thankfully, we only live 150 miles from the border and didn't have boats, so he was able to use the other vehicle in our party to drive home. This check can be a real trip spoiler for anyone driving long distances. I know that you can get the permit at the border if you have the required documentation and fee with you. Call the border station where you are going to cross and ask for imigration. TGG"
519360,Guest,2002-04-18 12:42:00,0,"A few facts for those who missed the original DUI/DWI thread.This DUI deal at the Canadian border started well before 911.NOW, with added security checks in place due to 911, more people will get turned back at the Canadian border for DWI's, as, naturally, more people get checked out more thoroughly.The thing that really bites about this whole situation is that IT DOES NOT MATTER when your DWI offence occured....my buddys was back in the 1970's!There has been talk on this board that the rules were going to be changed/loosened up for this fishing season, but as far as I know, nothing has changed....has it??"
519361,Guest,2002-04-18 14:48:00,0,I am a camp owner on Gullrock Lake I was at a NOTO meeting last nite there are changes in the system due to pressure from the tourist groups We have found out that the Ft. France& Saut St Marie crossing are the hardest to get across. If you come across and have any trouble with anything please tell the camp owner about it we would like to get those 2 border crossing more user friendly.
519362,Guest,2002-04-19 12:31:00,0,"As long as you dont have a smoking gun in your hand! And a open american beer in your cup holder! Dont loose any sleep over it. We always have are tabacco and alcohol written down on a sheet of paper with the tobacco on the dash board and we are 100% honest and polite. If that fails it just wasn't your day. And remove your sunglasses they need to make eye contact. Then if and when you make it to your hotel,resort or fly-in destination! crack open and ice,ice,ice cold blue. Actually i have to find the nearest parking lot in fort frances and slam one down because of all the adrenaline running through the body (lmao)."
