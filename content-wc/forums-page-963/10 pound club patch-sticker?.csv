519717,Guest,2002-05-05 11:32:00,0,got 2 on the wall....ex-fish not patches. that was then..this is now..now i'd take a picture (couldnt then) get it real blown up-printed and framed and it would still be cheaper!!!no....no 10lb er patches with walleyes...but you can get a 10 pound patch (just says 10 lb) from bass pros...then get a walleye patch and stitch them together. hope you send the big boys home too..from now on...they'll croak soon enough...
