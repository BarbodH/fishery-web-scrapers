519476,Guest,2002-05-07 20:28:00,0,I prefer mono if fishing near downed trees or in shallow water. if you get hung up you are lodged in pretty deep.
519466,Guest,2002-04-21 19:03:00,0,"Need some advice. When using Fireline, do you tie it directly to jig or do you use a mono leader. Also, what is your preference on the color of Fireline, the white or the yellow. Is it lake color (clear or stained) that makes a difference?Thanks for the help."
519467,Northern Manitoban,2002-04-21 21:36:00,195,"Tie on a Barrel swivel then straight to your hook,i don't use mono with fireline very often.Smoke or green i use both.FISH ON."
519468,Bobby,2002-04-22 00:10:00,211,"I haven't been using a mono leader either. Mind you I fish stained water (I live on the Berens River system). I also use both smoke (jigging) and flourescent(trolling). I read somewhere that if you watch your line for strikes rather than your rod tip (when you jig) then the flourescent Fireline would be the way to go as its easy to watch for movement. But, I think I'd use some kind of leader if I was jigging with the flourescent line because it is pretty bright. Walmart is the cheapest place I've found for Fireline ($20 cdn). One last thing, I tried that Spiderline fusion and didn't like it - it tangles and isn't smooth. Once that stuff tangles, which it always seems to do, you've got a knot you can't untie and you have to cut it out."
519469,Peanut,2002-04-22 08:56:00,929,"No disagreement here. I've never used a mono lead - just tied a swivel straight to the line. Used both colours in a variety of applications and water colours, no appreciable difference with either - go with what you're most comfortable with.derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"
519470,Jigger1,2002-04-22 09:36:00,234,"I'll probably be the odd one out in this discussion based on previous posts, but after trying Fireline last year, I don't like it for jigging! Having an ultra sensitive rod along with a no stretch line was like having sensory overload. I'm convinced I was ripping the jig out as the walleye was attempting to inhale the jig. In other words I was almost too fast for my own good.I switched back to mono after two solid days of fishing and immediately noticed a difference in my catch rates. I continued to have great feel with the bottom but the added stretch in the line appeared to give me the cushion that best fits my style of fishing and I was putting more fish in the boat. It's a matter of preference, but thought I would throw in my two cents about jigging with Fireline.Jigger1"
519473,River_eye,2002-04-22 15:32:00,1486,"I do lots and lots of jigging with Fireline. I tie directly to the jig, no leader or swivel. When casting 1/8th oz. jigs, the sensitivity is needed to feel the jig hit the bottom 40-50 ft. from the boat.It also helps me tell the difference between rocks and fish in heavy current vertical jigging."
519474,Guest,2002-04-22 16:55:00,0,geez you guys fish slow pick places. all i do is a slow lift....there are.....that many fish. tie it any way you want. guess there are slow picks....remember your cat? gets spooky if you twitch it too fast.....bot aint that true.......
519475,gunner,2002-05-01 19:19:00,0,"I use 6 lb fire line for jigs tie direct with a palamar knot caught walleyes up to 12lbs drag set lite & back reel no stretch soft rod tip I tried a mono leader, noticeed no difference, direct tie less knots lower blood pressure,"
519471,Guest,2002-05-02 07:30:00,0,"Jigger makes a great point - it depends on your overall set up. Jigger, what kind of rod are you using?"
519472,Guest,2002-05-07 05:29:00,0,"I agree with Jigger 1. I tried Fireline in the past and had the same experience with catch rates. I think what happens is that with Fireline when you want to test a ""pick up"" you are actually pulling the jig out of their mouth. The stretch that mono give you allows for this test before you actually set the hook. Another problem is the Fireline is nearly impossible to cast in windy conditions. It is so light that you get a tremendous bow in your line and are probably missing a certain % of fish because you can't feel the bite. And, when you finally get a tangle, and you will, you will have to cut off because you can't untangle it. By the way, with fireline or mono, I tie directly to the jig."
