519877,FOOTDOC,2002-05-05 19:00:00,139,My son and I are going to Elk Island Lodge in Manitoba in the first week in July. Is there anyone on this board that might provide some insight for me regarding this lodge? I have a cousin that went there last year and loved it. He caught several large northerns and walleyes and I would just like to hear other opinions regarding this location on God's Lake. I am looking forward to fishing Manitoba for the first time!
