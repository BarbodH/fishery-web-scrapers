I think Thaddeus Lake Lodge is the only lodge on the lake, so I'd be interested in finding out something about the lodge as well. We usually go to Eagle but we are looking for a alternative and heard this one might be a good one to check out."
519719,Guest,2002-05-02 09:06:00,0,"Went there 3 years ago in late June. The cabin was nice and comfortable, very quiet place, there were several empty cabins the week we were there, felt like we had both lakes to ourselves. The two lakes are large enough that you wont' be able to fish all the spots in a week. There is a culvert connecting the two lakes, you have to pull your boat through the tunnel. The best numbers spot we had for walleye was through the tunnel and fish the right side weed line (I think there was a dock around that shore where we do good). The best big fish spot we found was just to the left of the resort. Working parallel to shore, look for where the bottom rolls up and down. Don't know how these will do in the fall, but they were good in June...Resort service was very good. Walleye and bass fishing were both very good. The last couple miles of road leading to the resort are perhaps the worst road I've ever been on, just take it slow..."
