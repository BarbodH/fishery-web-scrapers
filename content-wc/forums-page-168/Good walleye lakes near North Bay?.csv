6033449,Shellback,2018-03-01 13:44:00,8083,"I'm trying to stay within 2 hours of North Bay, as that's about a 16 hour, 2 day drive for me from S.E. PA. I've done 2 trips to the Chapleau area, which were so, so, and nothing to write home about. Figure I can't do much worse staying closer to home. My wife has MS and I can't beat her up with long hours on the road. I would also prefer to camp with electric if possible. I just have a slide in truck camper and it's perfect for us, as I know what we have. Many camp cabins just aren't a good fit for folks who are handicapped. I'll have my Alaskan 1600 in tow with me, so no boat needed. I don't have to be on the water, and sometimes it's easier to put her in the boat at a launch, rather that try and get her down a rough path to a dock. We mostly troll as she's not so good with jigging or casting. So anything that bites on a troll makes her happy. Looking to do this in late July."
6034057,fsz,2018-03-01 17:15:00,144,"So not sure if the French river interests you, that meets your time requirements. There are several tourist operations over its length from Nippising to Huron. Never fished that area only hunted years ago so I can't make a recommendation there. Kipawa area in Quebec meets your time requirements and there are services (cabins, outposts, lodges) available for Lake Kipawa itself as well as area ""back lakes"" in ZEC Kipawa. The back lakes, and some of the places on Kipawa itself, require some driving on rough roads (in some cases, very rough). The closer you stay to Temiscaming the shorter and easier the driving. Kipawa is not known as a huge walleye numbers lake but there is decent fishing to be had. Your boat is a little big for many if not most of the back lakes but would be perfect for Kipawa itself. Not sure if any of these outfitters have camping, much less camping with electric with electric. Unfortunately I can't recommend anything specific on Kipawa since I fish very remote area back lakes with absolutely no services of any kind. There are a few provincal parks with decent sized lakes I see north of north bay not sure if they have campgrounds or what the fishing is like. If you are interested in the Kipawa area you may want to check another site ""kipawa fishing forum"". There are several guys from NE Ohio and western PA/NY who fish that area and may be able to help. Mike Borger fishes north of Temiscaming I believe he may be able to recommend something that is perhaps 3 hours from North Bay. Good luck"
6034257,fishron,2018-03-01 18:18:00,317,"I've fished the area above North bay several times. Lady Evelyn lake (caught several big walleye) is a standout but would not fit your camping needs. The Gogama area provided some memorable fishing on daily flyouts but again would not fit your camping needs. There are several resorts on the west side of Nippising lake that would be of interest, (Memquisit Lodge) but I have not personally fished them. Years ago, I fished a resort now known as Spotswoods Landing on the Ottawa river at Westmeath. The resort offered Camping and hookups and Lorne Spotswood has a great knowledge of the area. I caught smallmouth, pike, walleye, and channel catfish during my stay. It has everything you would need but I can't rate it as a great fishing spot but certainly an interesting one. Good Luck"
6034905,Shellback,2018-03-02 07:17:00,8083,"I'd like to stay in Ontario, but realize that Quebec might be a better choice, being closer to home. I've checked out Spotswood online in the past. A couple years ago I stayed at Morning Mist on the Ottawa river in Stonecliff. It was very nice in early Sept. But the owner told me mid summer there's more recreational boaters and it may not be my cup of tea. I'm fortunate enough to have use of a cottage on the St Lawrence in Gananoque for the first 2 weeks of June and also the first 2 weeks of Sept. Love to get into a back country lake at the end of a 2 track, but that's not doable with the wife."
6035009,fishron,2018-03-02 07:59:00,317,"I've taken several trips to Deer Horn Lodge on Cabonga reservoir in Quebec. It's a housekeeping cottage resort about a twelve and a half or thirteen hour drive from se PA. We took our own boats. It's a beautiful area and a good trolling lake. We did very well on most of our trips using hot n tots and thundersticks. About five miles into the huge Cabonga we would fish Burns Bay and the general area and had great walleye fishing for numbers and size. After several drawdowns of the reservoir which messed up our favorite spots we gave up on Cabonga. If they haven't messed with the water level for several years it may again be a great walleye fishery. There are places close to Deer horn where fishermen had truck campers and fished from these sites. For better quality fishing and availability of guides and owners advice, I would stick with Deer Horn."
