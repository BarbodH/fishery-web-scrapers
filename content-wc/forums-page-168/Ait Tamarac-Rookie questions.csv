5961210,Thunderpants Johnson,2018-01-22 15:01:00,18,"Hi, Im new to the page, and love it already. This August I will be doing a fly in trip to Lac Charlotte with Air Tamarac. Im from Massachusetts and we only have one body of water that has walleye, the CT River. Ive probably caught a dozen by accident while small mouth fishing. I plan to split my trip between pike and walleye fishing. I was planning on throwing bright colored ball jigs with 4""grubs. The water is very dark colored. My questions are: Has anybody been there and have any reviews they would be willing to share, and does anybody have any advice they are willing to give such as depths, colors, line choice, etc? Ill be there the last week of August. Thank you in advance for any info you are willing to share"
5961234,That Minnesota guy,2018-01-22 15:06:00,8293,"Welcome to Walleye Central. I have not been to the lake you are going to however, many guys vertical jig for Walleye. Park on top of them and drop and lift. When you feel weight set the hook."
5961794,bthomas3333,2018-01-22 22:42:00,465,Hey Welcome - Couple of questions? Will you have electronics / decent fish finder? If yes make sure you are sitting on fish. When I think August I think mid lake humps. I know some bodies of water hold river walleyes all year round but that hasn't been my experience. I find mid lake humps and 20+ feet and use the finder to make sure I am seeing fish.In terms of color I have fished several very stained lakes and Orange is usually a good choice. Recently I have also had good luck with electric pink.Have fun!B-
5962050,BornToFish,2018-01-23 07:00:00,1224,"Greetings,Welcome to the Canada forum of Walleye Central! I have found this forum to be a great source of helpful information. I hope that you do as well!I too have not fished your destination, but have considerable experience fishing late August on other bodies of water in the Canada Shield. The previous two posts offered great suggestions.I have a hunch that the original poster will mightily struggle to catch walleyes pitching jigs with soft plastic during his trip in late August. This approach may work well if there is a viable population of walleyes working weed edges. I think of this approach during the springtime when walleyes are working shorelines and shallow weeds.The walleye action on the lakes that I fish during later August is clearly associated with rock humps and deep points. I most often target rock humps and points that have quick access to deep water (e.g. 30-40 fow). The thought that is always front and center in my mind is: what depth of water are the walleyes in?Seeing the walleyes on the sonar unit is definitely a huge advantage, as I then know that they are there. However, most of the walleyes that I catch in late August are never displayed on my sonar unit. I'm pretty sure that they are coming up from the unit's ""dead zone"". I leave a rock hump when I have proven to myself that the walleyes aren't there by fishing it. I don't rely on the sonar unit to show me fish, but it sure is nice when it does!The walleyes in the lakes that I fish tend to be bunched up during August. I'm thinking ""game on"" if I pull up to a rock hump and catch a walleye, as I then know where they all are.I find that walleye fishing during July - September timeframe is a vertical game, rather than horizontal. The reason is that a vertical presentation will keep my jig in the strike zone much longer than a horizontal presentation. Remember: you will likely be fishing a sloped section of the lake bottom. Don't rely upon casting as your jig might be zipping through the narrow band of depth of water that is holding fish.I've found that ""live bait"" (e.g. crawlers and minnows) will almost always out-produce plastics with a vertical presentation. The walleyes simply have ample time to study your presentation before they decide to eat or pass on it. It's almost always NOT a reaction bite during August/September.Remember to always be thinking when you are in the lake: what depth of water are the walleyes in today?I mostly fish with brightly colored jigs in stained water as it may help the fish locate my jig. On the other hand, color of jig may not matter at all if the fish are not pressured. An unpainted jig works just fine on the lake that I am now fishing the most.You might find that the biggest pike in your lake may also be on rock humps when you are there. Don't overlook this aspect of pike fishing, in addition to casting traditional weed beds.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5962250,vteye3,2018-01-23 08:29:00,496,"Thunder - Our group also from MA fished Gouin nearby to Charlotte a few times. Yes, deep water humps, deep water off points, deep current areas inlets/outlets, weed lines. We also taught ourselves walleye fishing coming from MA. Variety of jigs 1/8 oz up to 1/2 oz for windy days. Electronics for ""seeing the depth"" as much as seeing the fish and ask outfitter and party departing where and how they were catching fish. Good luck"
5962258,fishron,2018-01-23 08:35:00,317,"Lot's of good advice from posters already. I have fished Hebert three times and Charlotte is just a few casts to the east. I wouldn't call Hebert's water darkley stained. Could see bottom in 5 or 6 feet over sand. Charlotte should be similar. I used one third to half a nightcrawler to tip my jigs. In my opinion, worms are better than plastic in that neck of the woods. A quarter to three eighths for walleye. Spinnerbaits and 5 or 6 inch single-hook paddletails for pike. Use a short invisa-leader. There are pike that will get past the lure. Occasionally a freight train will grab your walleye and you'll be amazed how you can't lift her no matter what until she spits out the walleye. Knuckleball jigs and larger roadrunner jigs for a little extra flash work well. A good portable fishfinder is essential Never did well trolling Hebert. Stick to jigging and casting. Good luck."
5962562,MrSimon,2018-01-23 11:18:00,922,"Charlotte is a very small lake, but detailed contour maps are available ... and have been linked right here on this forum. Do some searching and you'll dig it up. I HIGHLY recommend getting it, printing it out, and studying it. The lake might look like a big bath tub, but it's not. There are holes, humps, drop-offs, and flats all over the place. The walleye will have their favorite spots and you'll just have to find them. Personally, I'd look for flats in 6-10 feet of water that are close to both deep water and some combo of rocks/weeds/creeks. I'd fish those flats early and late using crankbaits and jerkbaits. If you find a flat where fish are actively feeding, it will be non-stop. If you fish walleye during the day, I'd drop down to 16-22 feet of water close to those flats and use jigs and worms. You can also try trolling slowly with bottom bouncers and worm harnesses .... that's a great way to cover water and find the walleye. You can zig zag all over the place through different depths till you find them. That lake is a great pike lake too, so don't forget them. Contrary to popular belief, trolling for pike in a small lake can be excellent! In-line spinners, rattle traps, jointed crankbaits, big swimbaits are all great for trolling pike."
5964410,TheDFP,2018-01-24 12:18:00,39,"I have fished Lac Hebert and the Gouin with Air Tamarac. Top notch outfitter. We flew over Lac Charlotte as we descended into Hebert. It is not big. Here is my top 15 list for walleye:1-8. Dept finder9 Marker buoys to mark your spots. You are the only one on the lake. Leave them out. 10 Twice as many night crawlers as you think you need. You never want to run out. 11 jig heads and twisters in multiple sizes and colors. 12-14 Ask the following people where to fish: outgoing fisherman, pilot and camp caretaker. They will get you started and learn from there. 15 Print out a contour map. Can be found on AT web site."
5964514,Andre (wallyandre),2018-01-24 13:18:00,2274,You can look at the lake here: https://webapp.navionics.com/?lang=f...y=mzekH%7CbkjM You can get the Navionics app for $20 on your phone
5966338,Thunderpants Johnson,2018-01-25 13:59:00,18,"Thanks everyone for the help and advice. My main focus on the trip will be trophy pike, but really want to put some walleye time in also. I chose Charlotte because of it being a one cabin lake. The DFP, great call with leaving the marker buoys out. I def would have picked them up. LOL. I will def have some type of sonar, and a laminated copy of the depth map. I get my packet with trip info in April. Cant wait. Not sure if Im gonna rent a portable fish finder from them, or buy my own. Ill have to see what they have. Again, thanks for the tips. Ive only caught a dozen walleye in my life, and all by accident. I cant wait for a fish fry as I have never tasted fresh water fish like that before. Hopefully in September Ill be on here with a great report and some pics of monsters"
5969554,MikeG1,2018-01-27 18:04:00,433,"If you are targeting eyes, keep your jig on the bottom and fish the side of the lake that the wind is blowing into. These 2 things kept us on fish most of the time. I also fished Hebert and 6 of us caught 1700 in 1 week. Will be there again this year beginning July 8. Pm me if you want my number to talk. Good luck. Mike."
5983746,NY Walleye1,2018-02-04 17:31:00,13,Great Lake you will be fishing. Find 25Â” plus of water and jig with a 1/2 worm. Once you find them you will have a good bite. Air Tamarac is a great outfitter with great accommodations and lakes. Cast larger Rapalas or spoons for northerns. PM me for any further info.
5986450,bigeee99,2018-02-05 19:58:00,8,"I fished Charlotte last year the week beginning June 10th. We caught Walleye readily and some real nice one's especially at the north end after 4pm. We trolled and casted for Pike and we caught some but none really big. I am sure they are in there, but we didn't do anywhere near as well as i thought we would."
5986810,Thunderpants Johnson,2018-02-06 05:41:00,18,"Thats disheartening to hear about the pike, but thanks for the response"
5990033,NY Walleye1,2018-02-07 18:26:00,13,There are some big pike in the lake. There is a couple you tube videos out there where they were fishing pike and caught some slobs. Check it out.
6037721,octanehi5,2018-03-04 04:37:00,1104,"Charlotte Has been a C&R lake for a long time,Loaded with both walleye and Pike,Big in numbers as well as size. Worms have always worked best I suggest 300 per fisherman,Air Tam as well as the crew coming out will turn you on to fish. I have fished Hebert 16yrs. in a row.Follow walleye rule #1 Find fish and fish were you find them.This will change with wind direction. Its all about structure.During the day you will catch them in 20 -30 feet of water as the sun goes down Twilite They start to move Shallow 14-18, then at dark fish a few rock piles with swim baits form 0-10feet I failed to Mention I am building custom Rods now, Designing one for Air Tamarac,for Jigging,for Walleye,It should be in Clova before they open,Rods will have the air Tam logo and numbered in series 001-050 John will be the owner of #001.The rods will be very sensitive as in you can feel a knat land on it.1/8 to 3/8 oz. This rod will only be available at AirTam. I make other rods to order PM me for more info. Have a great season"
6039305,Thunderpants Johnson,2018-03-04 16:53:00,18,Thank you very much for the response. Glad to hear such a positive review about the pike and walleye. If your rods are up there when I go I will def buy at least 1....maybe more
5964690,potsie225,2018-01-24 15:23:00,41,"10 guys in our group fished Lac Hebert last year. We like walleyes first and some pike. In 7 days we caught 1700 walleye, 75% were caught vertical jigging with knuckle ball jigs and worms. Largest eye was 29.5, we enjoyed 5 fish fries. I can not say enough nice things about air tamarac, first class in all areas. We are going back this year from June 22 to July 1st. I am looking for 2 more guys to join our group. We leave from Rochester,NY. Trip was about 12 hours and the last 150 miles was good gravel dirt logging roads. Lucky to go 50 mph. If you have anyone who would like to go in June let me know. Doug"
