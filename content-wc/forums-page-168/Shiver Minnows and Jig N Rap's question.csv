6028817,tweedrules,2018-02-27 06:12:00,107,Anyone ever use these on the Canada lakes? How did you fish them? What colors and sizes were most effective? We are fishing on the Gouin 7/1-7/7. Any info would be great. We have stuck to jig/worms mostly.

I cant remember the size, the one that is around 2.5"" in length. Fast action medium rod with line of your choice. Use a snap or Rapala knot to keep the line twist down. 20 foot plus depths. Lift and drop, either on slack line or tight line. Just experiment. I always used the perch color, but my tackle box is filled with perch colors... One thing I will say, is that after a few hours (or less) of using them they start to fatigue your forearms pretty good, but the strike you get on these things is amazing, maybe explaining why my forearms get fatigued early. Another thing, if your fishing in rocks/boulders and snag up, you will NOT get them back. Bring a handful."

Honestly, I believe they have their time and place, but still prefer to fish with live bait most of the time. I've found that most of my walleye fishing is when the fish are more or less willing to bite. In these situations, my results have been that live bait on a jig will out-produce a Jigging Rap by a considerable margin.However, there are situations when the walleyes are just tight lipped and nothing seems to work well. I now break out the Jigging Raps and other such blade baits in these situations. I keep the Jigging Rap moving through the water by drifting, casting or back trolling. I keep the bait constantly moving, so as to provoke a reaction bite. I don't want to give the walleye any time to think about it. One of the recent Lindner fishing shows mentioned that with Jigging Raps that you are fishing through fish to find an aggressive fish. I called this provoking a reaction strike.A previous post mentioned that fishing with Jigging Rap type baits can be expensive in view of bite-offs and getting snagged on the bottom. I have to agree with this comment.Most of my Jigging Rap style baits are in the 2.5 - 3.0 inch range in length. I tend to mostly use lures that are in a white, silver or silver/blue color scheme so that I can more-or-less match the hatch of shiner minnows. Many of my friends use firetiger and perch patterns in the lakes they fish.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
