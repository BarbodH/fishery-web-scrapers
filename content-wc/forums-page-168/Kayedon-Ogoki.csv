6011313,hoppy63,2018-02-18 21:10:00,367,Going to kayedon in june with leuenberger. Fished here once in september. Any incident on leuenbergers or kayedon/ogoki in june?
6011561,Namegosikaa,2018-02-19 06:39:00,61,"That time of year you will be fine especially in the high current areas between the lakes. My camp is upstream from ogoki lake on the river and in June the eyes are stacked up heavy from the spawn. You should be able to identify great spots quickly there it's a great body of water. I would also fish above speckled trout rapids, should be great."
6013201,hoppy63,2018-02-19 16:25:00,367,"Are there really trophy there, or is it just a name? (Speckled trout rapids) I'm sure there are some nice fish in ogoki when winds allow. We caught no walleye over 24"" but many many 18-22's and very thick fish. Would like to find a big pike too! Thanks for info"
6013377,Namegosikaa,2018-02-19 17:31:00,61,"Lots of water too explore, I would target areas with numbers then go trophy hunting they won't be far away. Ogoki is a great lake for trophy pike it's just a matter of locating them again, 16000 acres of water so pin pointing prime spots will be your biggest task. I wouldn't pay any mind to the names "" speckled trout rapids"" I don't know of anybody catching trout there in decades."
6015073,oleJoe,2018-02-20 11:26:00,114,Our group will be on Kaydon the second week of June this year. With that being said there will be a lot less fish for you to look for. LOL The water should be up so the fishing should be good. Getting to Ogoki if the water is up is no problem till you get to the outflow and then it is really silted in. When on Ogoki really watch the wind. Can get rough in a hurry. Plenty of fish in Kaydon. Look for the weeds and cattails for pike and around the rapids and rocks. They live on the walleye. If you go down to the outflow really watch out for rocks. I was there in the fall and the water was low and a lot less water to fish. Let us know how you do. Take care

6018313,hoppy63,2018-02-21 18:23:00,367,"hey joe, sent you a PM before I saw your post here? Are you going to Kayedon with BFO? We will be 3rd week with leuenberger. Leave us a couple for dinner please!"
6018329,hoppy63,2018-02-21 18:28:00,367,Wow......I know there are thick fish there. Really surprised you haven't landed any 26+. We jig 95% so we will see! Cant wait to get there! Id like to be there now on the ice!
