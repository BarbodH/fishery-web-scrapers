6044673,FishinSasquatch,2018-03-07 00:00:00,8,"Check out coppen's resort on rainy. It's a 4 generation family owned resort with walleye, bass, northern, musky, and crappie opportunities. Full drive to with launch, minnows, power, ice and gas right at the dock all included in a daily fee around 10-15$ a day. As for the cabins there are cabins that fit anywhere from 2 to 8 people and are all clean, fully equipped with everything you need in a kitchen, running potable water, tv, and screened in porches with bbq and if requested deep fryers. Here's the link to the website http://www.coppensresort.com"
6029993,pjshorthorn,2018-02-27 17:40:00,5654,It is just easier if clients from the US know what the prices are in US dollars. The Canadian exchange rate just confuses things. PjShorthorn
6030113,Obabikon,2018-02-27 18:42:00,2370,You guys must be getting bored. Or... they could be charging less than their comparable competitors... even if they're charging in US.
6030145,Obabikon,2018-02-27 19:05:00,2370,For the record... Obabikon's prices remained the same this year. Anyone charging in Canadian will cost approximately 10% more than last summer (prior to any rate increases). For the record... that's how that math works.
6030161,Baseline,2018-02-27 19:26:00,3207,"Canadian Rainy has some great fishing especially in the Red Gut area. Taylor's Cove, Fisheries and The Landing are all great places to stay. Morson Ont. is anther good area. I've been to Red Wing Resort many times and also Hidden Island, but I think they are closed now. One of these days I'm going to give Obabikon a try."
6030169,BreezyPoint,2018-02-27 19:27:00,1581,"Quite frankly, I really don't care how trips are charged. It is incumbent on the seller to be transparent in pricing and the buyer to understand the pricing. That's the best way to have a good time and avoid hard feelings.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
6030273,v-bay gord,2018-02-27 20:26:00,3168,The fish are 10% bigger this year..........

6030737,whyknot,2018-02-28 06:37:00,141,"LaBelles' Birch Point Camp on Ontario side of Rainy Lake.Great people, gas,, bait, and Crappies as well as other species."
6042841,Bergy,2018-03-06 07:23:00,83,"Still Looking for more suggestions. I would like to stay on a lake that has good mapping via a chip I can use in my Helix units. That has me thinking I need to stick with Rainy or Lake of the Woods. Are there other lakes that have detailed mapping. We haven't been able to find a resort or lodge that has decent cabins or decent information and pictures that my wife and family would feel comfortable staying at. We don't need anything fancy, just a place you don't feel like you need to clean when you arrive. Thanks in advance fir additional input."
6042977,BornToFish,2018-03-06 07:54:00,1224,"Greetings,The original poster triggered a thought when he mentioned that he is continuing his search for a fishing lodge that would best meet his needs. As I recall, he mentioned that he intends to take his own boat on the trip.He may want to ask some questions of prospective lodge owners regarding bringing his own boat. I believe there are lodge owners that charge a fee for services such as using a boat launch at the resort, battery charging, docking, premiums on gasoline, etc.. I'm not suggesting anything or anyone is good or bad, but it's always best to understand such issues in advance rather than being surprised.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6021129,martinbns,2018-02-23 05:35:00,1520,"If you are bringing your own boat, why not just look at renting a cabin?https://www.vrbo.com/1256932 We rented this place twice last summer, very good dock with power, 3 bedrooms, very nice people, little beach if you are bringing your kids, cable TV fully equipped, nearby boat launch. Very good value to me."
6023897,team walleye,2018-02-24 17:16:00,336,What did you do for Gas and Bait?
6024065,martinbns,2018-02-24 18:51:00,1520,"It's about a 10-15 minute boat ride from Smiths Camps for gas, each morning I just drove about 10 minutes to Reddens for minnows. Went into Kenora for dinner a few times, maybe 15 minutes each way.We found it easy, the cabin is terrific, the owner gave me a few good spots to try and Storm Bay give pretty quick access to both Welcome Channel and Andrews Bay and only 15 minutes maybe past the Barrier islands down into Crowrock etc. Actually a handier location if you like to explore the lake than Kenora or Sioux Narrows, a bit of a haul to Shoal are though. It's actually the owners guest cabin, when they bought the place this was the main house, they had it moved about 50 yards and then they built their place on the original site. They are very available if you ever need anything, really nice friendly couple with two young boys."
6024089,FishermanTom81,2018-02-24 19:02:00,15,"Obabikon or Tamarack Island Wilderness Lodge on LOTW would my first choices. I am partial to Tamarack since I have been going there for so long but you are not making a bad choice with either place. What is nice about Tamarack is Todd does not mind if you bring your own gas for your boat, he is very accommodating. That being said I have never heard a bad thing about Obabikon's camp either. If I were you I would check them both out."
6027209,Aspencreek,2018-02-26 09:23:00,2911,"Looks like a nice place, would cut down on the possible loud guests in the cabin next door, but that is rare anyway. If you are sharing the cost with a couple other guys it is very reasonable. BUT, after posting this you may find it harder to get in, just sayin.I have used VRBO for places in FL, CA, HI, and Mexico, and never a problem."
6028449,team walleye,2018-02-26 20:52:00,336,You must be the owner. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
6028865,Aspencreek,2018-02-27 06:37:00,2911,"I wish!!! Just a seasoned traveler. but let's do the math on this one, $170/night 7 nights is 1190.00 If you have a group of 6 that's only $199/guy FOR THE WEEK. Now you have to get your own gas, bait, but that is a small price to pay compared to Camp prices. I pay $800/week and so does everyone else in the group, plus any extra gas or minnows. Geez, I think I may have found new accomodations.Just looked at the calendar for openings and this place is pretty well booked already."
6028953,v-bay gord,2018-02-27 07:31:00,3168,Don't forget about the currency exchange if the price is in Canadian $.......just another advantage to prices in Canadian $$.........
6029929,Aspencreek,2018-02-27 17:17:00,2911,"Good catch Gord....it doesn't say specifically, but if it is CN currency the price just got even better."
6029961,BreezyPoint,2018-02-27 17:35:00,1581,"Just remember, some places do not give you the full exchange...but I must say Gord does so if you want an upright deal, go to his place. Or use a Capital One credit card and charge it!Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
6018977,Guest,2018-02-22 07:17:00,0,"Hello Everyone, Looking for resort recommendations in Canada that have good roads to their door to bring our own boat. Would like a family friendly resort that has great fishing for Walleye and possibly Crappies. We live in Minnesota and so the closer to home the better. A few that I have started to check into are the Red Gut Bay area of Rainy Lake and Lake of the Woods. Any recommendations there? Other recommendations for lakes and resorts? Thanks, Bergy"
6019049,stumcfar,2018-02-22 08:02:00,451,"If you have your own boat, check out Gawley's Little Beaver Camp near Ear Falls. It is a pretty drive up there, small camp with nice cabins. No crappies that I know of, but the walleye fishing will be second to none and a reasonable priced place to stay. We stayed last year and thoroughly enjoyed it."
6019209,NARDA 1,2018-02-22 08:43:00,636,"Check out www.birchdalelodge.com 807-227-5262 owners name is Marcel. On Eagle Lake about 150 miles north of International Falls. No Crappie but plenty of other species to fish for: Walleye, Northern Pike, Lake Trout, Small Mouth Bass and Perch. All paved roads except for the last mile which is a well maintained gravel road."
6019313,wallydave,2018-02-22 09:16:00,2151,"Look Iinto Cedar Point Resort on Cedar Lake, crappie, walleye and Musky, camp fish fry, nice fish cleaning house. American plan if your interested."
6019441,Ricky Spanish,2018-02-22 09:53:00,1298,"As NARDA mentioned, no crappies in Eagle that I know of, but I recommend Temple Bay Lodge. I can't say how it compares to Birch Dale, since I haven't been to Birch Dale, but pricing is similar. Food and amenities are more than I expect for the price. Been going to TBL since 2002 and, IMO, it has only gotten better since the somewhat recent change in ownership. My wife caught a 50-1/2"" musky on #6 test last year while walleye fishing about two miles from the lodge. On our best day last June we boated over 80 walleyes between the two of us, all within about 2-3 miles from the lodge. We haven't hired a guide since about 2007, but I would recommend it for anyone new to the lake.Edit: I have been trailering an 18' fish and ski there since 2007. Roads are great until the last couple miles, but it has never bad enough for me to worry about my rig."
6019697,Obabikon,2018-02-22 11:12:00,2370,"Mylie's Place out of Morson is probably about as close as you can get. They are a drive to.http://www.myliesplaceresort.com/ We're a full service island resort, but you can still bring your boat to Obabikon if you'd like."
6019785,BreezyPoint,2018-02-22 12:05:00,1581,"Better choices are Obabikonâ€™s place (which he canâ€™t promote) or Red Wing Lodge. Obabikon has a nice boat to site and is beautiful. Red Wing is a drive to place with great docks, reliable power and friendly people.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"

6020465,That Minnesota guy,2018-02-22 17:12:00,8293,The good Lord willing i'll be checking out Obabikon for Pike right after ice out (or as soon as he opens). I wasn't able to get there last year but have been saving and selling aluminum cans all year for this spring trip!!
6020953,Timber Minnitaki,2018-02-22 21:40:00,11,"Good roads right to our door and excellant walleye fishing no crappie though, but very family friendly, and you can bring your own boat. www.timberedgecamps.com"
