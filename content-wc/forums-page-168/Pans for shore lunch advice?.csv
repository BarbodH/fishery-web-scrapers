6042825,bigwalleye1,2018-03-06 07:13:00,2632,"I've learned over the years to tell approximate temp (good enough for one time use of the can of Crisco) by taking a few drops of lakewater shaken off my hand into the oil. I can tell if I'm good or too hot by the way the oil reacts. I know the sound it makes if the oil is too hot. It actually makes kind of an angry, ringing type noise in the cast iron."
6043177,maddogg,2018-03-06 09:08:00,178,Would you be willing to share your recipe for blackened fish?
6043233,valley366,2018-03-06 09:29:00,193,"At the camp we were at last year a group invited us over for appetizers and did blackened walleye. It was really good. What they did was put a well seasoned cast iron skillet on the gas grill. They cut the walleyes in large chunks. Picture 14"" walleye fillet cut in 3 pieces. They had a tub of margarine or butter and coated the fish well. They just used some blackened cajun season and seasoned it to what they like. Throw it in the pan and turn after a minute or two.We tried a slightly different version and liked it. My kids like Fishermans Warf seasoning from Urban Accents on Grilled Hallibut so we did that. Turned out really well. This seasoning is also good with potatoes fried in butter with onions. https://www.urbanaccents.com/product/fishermans-wharf/"
6031521,bigwalleye1,2018-02-28 11:35:00,2632,"I think a lot has to do with the size and height of the collar surrounding the burner and how close it gets to the bars/grate you set the pan on. My burner has 3/8 solid rod legs. I cut the legs off to stubs, and welded 3"" long pieces of iron pipe onto them. I just stick the round rod legs into the pipes and I'm set up. Yah, I know. That's OK. Underwriter's Labratories wasn't on my Christmas card list anyway."
6031609,johnboat,2018-02-28 12:20:00,2014,"Yes. The ones with the ""wind guard"" will help quite a bit.Another tip......I have a hand held infrared thermometer I have in the truck to see what my trailer bearings are running at on the trip up. Everytime we stop for gas or have a ""pulp check"" I hit them all quick. It also works GREAT for testing your oil in the cast iron pot!"
6031617,Ricky Spanish,2018-02-28 12:29:00,1298,Pulp check...I'm gonna use that.
6031705,revitup,2018-02-28 13:30:00,140,All good ideas. One thing that we use rather than bringing a thermometer is bring several kernels of popcorn. Put 2-3 kernels in and when they pop the oil is perfect temp. After one batch (we use turkey fryer since we have 12 or more in our group) throw in 2-3 more and when those pop the oil is ready to go again. When frying with a turkey fryer it's important to put the breaded fish in one fillet at a time so they don't stick together.
6031945,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2018-02-28 15:19:00,240,"A wooden match stick works, too. It will burst into flame at 350 degrees. Then just strain it out, and you're good to go."
6031985,MN_Moose,2018-02-28 15:32:00,964,"Yes, I use a Lodge steel fry pan at home for blackened fish"
6032033,camp chef,2018-02-28 15:59:00,915,We grill all our fish either on the grill at camp or open fire at shorelunch..No oil...less mess to cleanup
6035937,packpro,2018-03-02 16:22:00,695,"Throw 3-4 old steel pie tins in the box. You can use them to prep. i.e.batter, cut up onions, potatoes, peppers, bacon, etc. or use then when taking stuff off the burners/fire for serving. One or two large burlap bags to put the pan into after the lunch keep the oil and soot from getting all over everything."
6036657,Obabikon,2018-03-03 06:45:00,2370,"I always take 2 - 16"" pans... even if I'm only cooking for 2. 1 cast-iron for potatoes... they crisp up so much better with the even heat 1 long handled steel for frying fish."
6036665,Obabikon,2018-03-03 06:46:00,2370,"Also... if you are cooking for 4-6 people, a 12"" pan will add an extra 10 minutes or so to cooking time."
6028193,Reels,2018-02-26 18:29:00,2876,"All good advice, especially on the extra stuff for the box. Thank you. Has anyone used the seasoned carbon steel for frying the fish? I agree, 16's would be the right size. 12's would be nice if fire ban and have to use the stove."
6028457,johnboat,2018-02-26 21:00:00,2014,"I go with a cast iron pot with a lid and a basket. Very easy for fish and frys...etc. I also bring a turkey fryer stand/burner and a smaller 10 lb propane tank. No worrying about wet wood and very easy to regulate your temperature. Of course you have to have room in the boats for this. Or drop it off at the shore lunch site if possible.Then again, running back to do it at the cabin has its advantages. (comfy bed for 40 solid winks)"
6028465,valley366,2018-02-26 21:04:00,193,"This may be overkill, sometimes I tend to do that.Over the years the one thing we hated was not having a table to put the stove on. We have a Coleman 2 burner stove. We started out like the the others have said with a rubbermaid tote. We graduated to a kit similar to this one from REI. The model I have has a compartment in the bottom to hold the stove. Enough space inside for all the associated gear and the table is perfect for the stove. https://www.rei.com/product/828504/r...prep-totetableFor the pot we have something similar to this. https://www.ebay.com/itm/CAST-IRON-V...-/273085368813 It fits on the 2 burner stove and holds about a gallon of oil and you can run both burners to get things hot. It takes a while to get hot but once hot you can cook up tons of food and 2 burners keep it going. With this setup takes about a 1lb propane for each shorelunch. We used it for our group of 7 for years. One drawback is time to cool off. We use the same oil all week so a lot of times we set it on the rocks by shore to accelerate the cooling. Sometimes we set it there, went fishing for a bit then came back to retrieve it when cool. They make cast aluminum pots that are faster to heat up and cool down. I now use on of them as our group is smaller and we don't need the capacity. One thing that we found is beneficial is to get a pan with good depth.For other gear like others have said:Can openerleather gloves to handle the hot stuffpaper towelsplates (we got 10 old pie tins)silverwarelighter and extra matchespaper towelsFryer skimmer for the potatoesWe also got tired of cleaning fish on a paddle with a rocking boat. Made a portable fish cleaning board. Happens to be correct size that fits in the kit listed above. Strap it to the tree and insert shelf bracket to hold it horizontal."
6028777,bigwalleye1,2018-02-27 05:59:00,2632,"I'd recommend considering a cast iron dutch oven for the fish and a cast iron chicken fryer with a lid for the spuds. We start the spuds first, and when they're done, put the lid on and set them on a rock or log. The cast will hold the heat so everyone gets hot spuds. If we want beans, wait til the potatoes are done, dump a can of beans in with them, give it all a couple stirs and remove from the heat. The cast iron dutch oven and a can and a half of Crisco shortening from the cook kit will fry fish about as fast as you can put them in. My dutch oven is an 8 qt and the pan is a 12 "", but with the higher sides, it holds more than a standard 12"" skillet. I've fed as many as 6 with that setup and a single gas burner."
6029265,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2018-02-27 09:03:00,240,"Hi--on all of our fly-ins, the outfitter has a good number of cast iron pans. But if I'm going into the boundary waters, or if I know cast iron pans aren't available, I've invested in a few aluminum fry pans and griddles from www.piragis.com and www.boundarywatersjournal.com . And, of course, pay extra for the removable handles. I also bring a cutting board or two--extra weight and bulk, but worth it, for sure.good thread--thanks!"
6029601,v-bay gord,2018-02-27 12:50:00,3168,I've cooked a lot of fish for shore lunches over the years.....mostly on big steel frying pans.....the longer the handle the better. I see no advantage to using a cast iron to deep fry fish.....they are just heavier to carry around and the handle is too short. A leather glove is pretty useful when cooking over open flame as far as moving things around and flipping over fish in hot oil. I have a box of old shore lunch pans in my garage.....you're welcome to them!
6030297,Reels,2018-02-27 20:30:00,2876,"That is fantastic, I will send you a message."
6030361,Reels,2018-02-27 20:44:00,2876,Thanks for all the great ideas everyone. I look forward to posting some pictures of our shore lunches!

6030393,Baseline,2018-02-27 21:20:00,3207,My experience has been that the problem with a free standing turkey fryer type burner is it is extremely hard to regulate temp especially if the wind is blowing.
6027577,Reels,2018-02-26 13:08:00,2876,"I have been tasked with putting together a shore lunch box. I see seasoned skillet pans at various places for sale, but wanted to ask here what people are using that works well? Our group will be between 4-6 guys. Is 12"" pans enough or should I haul 16"" pans? Any other tips for a shore lunch box to keep it light? Thanks"
6027665,BreezyPoint,2018-02-26 14:35:00,1581,"You will not be happy with 12 inch pans. Probably would barely hold two filets.if you are going to try cooking the fish all at once you would need a couple 16 inch pans. Btw, I really like cast iron pans for outdoor cooking. They hold and distribute heat really well.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
6027681,btyreprich,2018-02-26 14:40:00,1067,"We use a Rubbermaid plastic tub with a snap lid. Does a good job in keeping the contents dry. The fry pans we use -one for fish and one fro potatoes - stack inside each other and fit in the bottom of the tub. The larger os the two pans is used for the fish. I was given both of these fry pans by an old neighbor so I'm not sure if these were ever seasoned when new. They do a great job in preparing our shore lunches. Cast iron pans are not cheap and you could try and buy at a second hand store , but I don't see thes very often."

6028089,Baseline,2018-02-26 17:32:00,3207,Lots of good ideas on the previously posted lists. I stopped using open fire and opted for a Coleman propane 3 burner stove. For frying fish I'd recommend a 16 inch cast iron with the deep sides. Your eyes will pop when you see the price. Add a 3qt pot for veggies and a 16 steel or aluminum frying pan for potatoes. One other thing to add is digital thermometer to regulate oil temp. I also have a cookie rack so the oil drains off the fish and they will be more crispy.
6028137,JOE WALLEYE,2018-02-26 18:02:00,753,I think 10 to 12 inch skillets are plenty. And if your cooking on a stove they are about as big as you can use with the wind guard up. If your cooking over a fire you can use the big 16 with a long handle but they can be a pain to store.
