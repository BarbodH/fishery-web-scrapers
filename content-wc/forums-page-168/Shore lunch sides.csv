6018393,MikeG1,2018-02-21 18:49:00,433,"What about hush puppies? We take several packs of powered hush puppy mix and mix them in a water bottle. 1/2 bottle of water, pour power in and shake. Add additional power until it is the texture of pancake mix. We cook the fish after taters and all else. Then, as the very last thing we squeeze the mix into the oil; they brown quickly and add a nice texture and flavor to lunch. Give it a try."
6018489,jjunge,2018-02-21 19:23:00,179,"Three adults and 9 Scouts spent a week on Rainy Lake. Our meal plan had potatoes for breakfast and dinner. The breakfast potatoes were the dehydrated hash browns from Sam's in the gallon paper milk box. They are the easiest to transport and keep. We took 20 # of onions, 50 # of russet potatoes and several bags of sweet mini peppers for dinner potatoes. Each dinner was something different and awesome. It stormed like **** that week. The kids and I will never forget the potatoes or the storms that week. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"

6019225,Ricky Spanish,2018-02-22 08:45:00,1298,"Might seem obvious, but onion rings, jalapeno or bell pepper chunks help me use up some of the batter/breading mixture. I have a tough time portioning out the right amount of it and always pour out too much. Hmmmmm, I bet that would be a great way to get some browning and crunch on those canned potatoes."

6009889,bassnblast,2018-02-18 06:37:00,56,Take a bottle of scotch bonnet pepper sauce to dip the filets in for a little sweet & spicy. You can thank me later

6005825,btyreprich,2018-02-15 14:36:00,1067,I LIKE the recipe for the potatoes - will have to try this on our June trip. Our group really enjoys ice cold pineapple chunks as a desert once we are done with the fish & potatoes. The colder the better!
6006089,Mojo-NC,2018-02-15 16:29:00,1929,"Our first trip to Canada set the bar for my group for all of our future trips. To this day we still get together for a few ""shore lunch"" meals throughout the year. We went all out that trip, stayed at a really nice island resort, and had a guide almost every day. We chose how we wanted our fish cooked before we set out each morning (lightly breaded, beer battered, lemon butter, etc.). We would first fish for our lunch at ""Wal Mart"", the guaranteed walleye area. We fished until we had enough in the livewell for lunch, and then we would fish for anything we wanted. When we were ready to eat, we would pull up to shore and the guide would prepare our lunch. He cleaned the fish, and sliced a bunch of potatoes and onions (we helped), and cook everything. He cooked the potatoes with either a can of baked beans or creamed corn set right in the middle of the pan, then added onions right before the potatoes were done. He strained the oil into a separate pan and cooked the fish in a couple of minutes. It was awesome."
6007177,stumcfar,2018-02-16 08:28:00,451,Maybe not as exciting be we also used sliced canned potatoes when we are doing shore lunch on an island. Just easier and cook up quicker. Nothing better than shore lunch to break up a great day of fishing!
6007521,prov1800,2018-02-16 12:10:00,5010,Everything always tastes good on a shorelunch.we use the canned potatoes quite a lot put I still prefer real potatoes.they taste way better and the get brownish and crisper.doesnt take much to preboil some.also like to eat some pike at times for a change.guess if your only up a week walleye would be alright but I get tired of them after about the second week.lol.id rather eat a sandwich and keep fishing.i don't get tired of fishing.

6008105,BornToFish,2018-02-16 17:20:00,1224,"Greetings,I made some walleye fillets for dinner this evening. I served it with the tartar sauce recipe from Packpro - see the second post for this thread. My wife and I have never been particularly fond of tartar sauce, that is until tonight! The recipe is a keeper! I closely followed the recipe - no deviations.Kindest regards...."
6008273,Baseline,2018-02-16 18:52:00,3207,"We sometimes use is a simple combo of a can of cut green beans, can of corn and a can of sliced white potatoes. Drain all the water out of the cans first then throw in a package dried Italian salad mix (or you choice) Heat the veggies up in melted butter and serve. Goes well with fish and is good alternative to the fired potatoes and beans."
6003409,packpro,2018-02-14 14:17:00,695,"Read a recent thread involving mass consumption of fish during the shore shore lunch. We allot 2-3 filets per man per lunch. Usually 16"" walleye. We also recently added lake trout to the mix. I know this is heresy but, they have a very nice flavor when they are that fresh. I think the reason our guys satisfied with 2-3 filets is the quality of the sides. The potatoes are coveted. One large russet per 2 guys. Here is the recipe:Slice the potatoes to an equal thickness. 1/8"" is about right. Dice one large green pepper per four potatoes. Dice one very large sweet onion. Place a large cast iron pan on the fire, when hot add one pound of hickory smoked bacon. When the bacon is just starting to crisp remove from fire and dice. Add the potatoes to the bacon grease and do no touch them too early or they will turn to mush. Once the bottom layer is crisp, turn them and add the pepper and the onion. This will sweat/fry them to a very nice texture. When almost ready reintroduce the bacon to the pan. I think you will find this side will save at least one fillet per guy. We started out with no tater sauce at the shore lunches also. Then someone brought up a commercial brand....terrible. Now we bring up a home made version. Everyone in the camp comes over to get some. Never thought I'd do it, just doesn't seem right in that environment, but it is a very big hit with our group including the camp guides. I'll put the recipe up on another post."
6003449,packpro,2018-02-14 14:39:00,695,"I make this in large quantities before the trip and keep it refrigerated during the ride up and during the week. Parcel out a quart in a plastic container each morning. Good for 8-10 guys. This is a great recipe to use as a baseline, but you can modify the amount of the ingredients to your taste. 3/4 cup of mayo2 tablespoons of chopped capers2 tablespoons of sweet relish (not a fan of Heinz-changes the flavor)1 minced shallot1/2 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper1 1/2 teaspoon of white vinegar. (This is will control the tartness- add/delete to taste.) If too sour add more mayo. Give it a good stir and refrigerate"
6003481,camp chef,2018-02-14 14:44:00,915,"Looks good. We only cook fish once or twice because by the time our Canada trip roles around in May we have been eating fresh Wolf river Walleyes for 60 days at home. We also prefer Northern and we grill it with a little wine,olive oil and lemon pepper. Those potatoes look awesome. We do ours in foil packs with the same ingredients for easier prep and cleanup,"

6004617,bigwalleye1,2018-02-15 06:45:00,2632,"For us, the star of the show is always the fish, so we'll do it several different ways over the course of the week. A dry mix, a wet batter, fish tacos, etc. We've often used a couple cans of sliced potatoes, then just dumped in a can of beans. That said, the canned spuds never do brown up nicely, so I'm going to try to step up the game this year. Thanks for the ideas! Keep sharing!!"
