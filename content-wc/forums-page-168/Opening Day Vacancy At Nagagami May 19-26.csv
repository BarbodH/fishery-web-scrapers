I try to hit this week every year, however, for work reasons I can't get my vacation approved. As such I didn't want to leave the camp (Expeditions-North) in a lurch so I'm posting the opening here. If you're interested, the week is May 19-26. The fishing that time of the year is amazing. Truly world class for walleye and great for pike (please release them). If you have been looking for a week in Ontario at a time that is normally fully booked now is your chance to get a group together. Feel free to PM for lake info. Take care, Ruddiger"

Expeditions North is a great operation and the fishing on Nagagami is quite good. Large average sized walleye for sure. Price is very reasonable as well. Been considering going back for quite some time, just hasn't worked out."
