6015641,Walleye Wanderer,2018-02-20 16:05:00,101,"My gang and I are considering a mid-summer fly-in trip to the Nakina area this year and I am wondering if anyone has any recent experience with Wilderness North, specifically their Ogoki outposts or their Makokibatan Lodge? They have an amazing website and I am sure the accommodations are great, it is the fishing I am most interested in hearing about. My group likes to chase BIG Pike around most days and of course we like to get a feed or 5 of Walleye during the week. Any & all info welcome... Cheers, WW"
6016609,oleJoe,2018-02-21 06:39:00,114,"I have been on Ogoki for walleye, and got them with no problem. Pike I don't know but it is a big lake and open so watch the weather. The lodge is on the Albany river I think. It is big enough to do a lot of chasing. They do have nice accommodations and you will catch fish. BUT can you make weight!!! LOL Your group has followed us in at least once where we had to unload your overload LOL. And see your signs in a few cabins. Enjoy your trip."

6019849,gordy28,2018-02-22 12:25:00,437,I realize that I run a risk of looking like an idiot for highlighting this Mike as your knowledge base much greater than mine but: Pretty sure Wilderness North flies out of Nakina for trips to Makok and Ogoki lake - at lease thats what the brochure I have says for the OP - I did a trip to Miminiska Lodge with Wilderness North and it was a great trip - great service and equipment and an awesome fishery. Only call out I would make is that they are quite expensive to a Canadian as all of their pricing (even ancillary things like bait or booze) is charged in US funds The lodge manager at Mim told me that Makok is the best fishery for large walleye - but not necessarily for numbers and that Strikers Point on Whitewater lake (Armstrong air base) is the best big pike fishery. He also spoke highly of a few of the outpost - Dalton Lake and Zig Zag in particular (also both Armstrong air base I believe) We are actually going to Ogoki Lake this summer with Ogoki Lake outfitters based on really good reviews of the body of water and the outfitter Good luck Gordy
6019969,Mike Borger,2018-02-22 13:18:00,1554,Could very well be true. I'm usually wrong about most things.
6020561,adempsey2.0,2018-02-22 18:20:00,612,"Most of their outposts are from Armstrong. They do indicate that Ogoki and Makok are out of Nakina and Minimiksa from Thunder Bay.You likely don't hear much about them as their prices were relatively high, as mentioned. Not that you don't get what you pay for, they were just at the higher end of the spectrum. However, they are one of the few outfitters who has actually lowered their prices over the past 4 years. The outposts were $1575 per week in 2014, but now they are $1300 to $1450. Much more competitive. Their website used to be absolutely terrible too. It looked nice, but was completely nonsensical. It's way better now.Looks like a lot of positive changes were made."
