6019513,ljcs789,2018-02-22 10:25:00,42,"Thanks and thanks to all for the great insight on this. I like the idea of the purifying systems and will need to keep an eye out for a good deal on the Platypus, I think."
6022305,Pat,2018-02-23 16:09:00,203,Some fly in's provide bottled water as part of their package. That might be an alternative too.

6017385,ljcs789,2018-02-21 11:47:00,42,"What recommendations do you have for a larger group (8) on a fly-in trip for water at an outpost? I see tablets and devices to pump through filters, but I am wondering what you have found that works best? I would rather not fly in a bunch of bottled water and sacrifice beer cargo! Thanks!"
6017425,hoppy63,2018-02-21 12:01:00,367,"I have just boiled it and drank it but a buddy bought a filter, not sure kind, I can find out but it was inexpensive and light and works great."
6017449,ljcs789,2018-02-21 12:09:00,42,"That would be great if you can find out what that was, Thanks."
6017489,KSjim,2018-02-21 12:22:00,88,"I would recommend the Platypus Gravity Works system. We used it last year and it is so much nicer, faster, easier than boiling water.We just flew in a couple gallons of water and then used the containers to store water for the rest of the trip. It filters the water very fast. If it starts to slow down just back flush the filter. It is now a ""must take item"" for our fly-in trips."
6017609,IlliniMuskie,2018-02-21 13:11:00,22,"https://www.zerowater.com/30c-readypour.php On our fly-in trip last summer we used this filter. We boiled the water first and then ran it through the filter. The boiled water was obviously safe, but the filter really improved the taste. It came with an electronic ppm tester (looked like a thermometer). The boiled water would test somewhere around 26 ppm. Every batch of filtered water tested at 0 ppm."
6017665,Mike Borger,2018-02-21 13:39:00,1554,100% agree. I have the 4L version and it's amazing. It's a gravity system so no pumping. Love it. I use it on all of my fly in trips and canoe trips now.https://www.platy.com/ca/filtration/...ks-4-0l-filter
6017681,bob888,2018-02-21 13:43:00,244,I have no experience with the Lifesaver 4000UF bottle however I was piqued by it. See link:https://www.iconlifesaver.com/produc...bottle-4000uf/
6017913,kzoofisher,2018-02-21 15:17:00,5144,"x3 for the platypus. I take it on our one week trip and it lasted three years for 5 guys before the cartridge wouldn't backwash very well anymore and I bought a new cartridge. The water was not very clean before filtering and that no doubt took some life out of it. Even so, I would say we filtered 4-5 gallons per day. It is very fast. Our routine is to refill it after every meal but it only takes a few minutes to fill and on hot days we would do another 4L for water in the boats. Ours is a boat in outpost so we take a case of water to provide bottles for the filtered water. Every year there have been enough unopened bottles that we have drinks for the ride home. When I get home I backwash it three times with tap water and then do the recommended sterilization for storage."
6018233,hoppy63,2018-02-21 17:58:00,367,"It is called zero water. I believe 30 cup ready pour. Not sure about what all it filters out, all I know is we fill it and the tea stained water is clear as can be and tastes great. Looks like its about $40. But there are many different ones on market these days if you want to google it."
6018361,adempsey2.0,2018-02-21 18:39:00,612,"These things are simply incredible.One would work fine for your group, but two would be better for 8 guys if you're lazy like I am. Nothing wrong with a backup either."
