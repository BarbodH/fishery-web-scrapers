6026457,JOE WALLEYE,2018-02-25 20:19:00,753,I am well aware that night fishing is prohibited on eagle lake. But I cannont find anything in the regulations that defines night or specific hours. I like to fish right to the edge of darknesses getting back to the dock as late as I can without needing a light to navigate. And leave the dock as early as I can with out needing a light. I assume this is legal but wanted to be sure. May be V-bay Gord or anyone else with a lot of eagle lake experience can chime in. Thanks in advance.
6026481,v-bay gord,2018-02-25 20:46:00,3168,The regulation as I know it reads no fishing till half hour before sunrise and half hour after sunset.
6026497,martinbns,2018-02-25 20:56:00,1520,Probably the same as hunting. Why no night fishing on Eagle?
6026617,pjshorthorn,2018-02-26 02:04:00,5654,"Because that is when V-Bay Gord conducts his moonlight canoe tours of Eagle Lake. Apparently, clothing is optional. PjShorthorn"
6027001,v-bay gord,2018-02-26 08:06:00,3168,"The regulation was originally put in place to halt the overharvest of large walleye back when the limit was 6 and no size restrictions. Apparently someone discovered that speed trolling a large Rapala over the deep water near Viking Reef at dusk and at night would produce all the big walleye you wanted. Of course the secret spread and it became a fiasco. Since then regulations have changed but this has still been there as ""part of the package"". Some question it's relevance but I still think it has a positive fisheries benefit to walleye, and likely the musky population as well. That, and the nude canoe trips......."
6027177,BreezyPoint,2018-02-26 09:16:00,1581,"Actually I wrote the MNR and they responded telling me that they would enforce the regulation based on actual sunset and sunrise times. That seemed odd to me because every regulation related to fishing and hunting like this has always been 30 minutes before sunrise to 30 minutes after sunset. I am not sure if this person knew what they were talking about, but I would be careful of that 30 minutes.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
