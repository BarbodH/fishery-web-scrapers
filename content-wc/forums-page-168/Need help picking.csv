Would like a cabin right on the water. Need elect for a sleep app. Need nice boats, and nice cabins, we are kinda old 67 & 69. A big lake would be nice. Sells bait would be nice. Looking for a really nice camp or lodge, but numbers of walleyes are very important. Thanks so much for the help"

Nice drive to lodge on Eagle Lake, 150 miles north of International Falls, MN Cabin #7 is a 2 bedroom right on the water. Boats have flat floors and pedestal seats. Bait is available right at the dock. If you chose to do the American Plan, you order from a menu instead of everyone eating the same thing. My group will be there 9/8/18-9/15/18 for our 30th year there."
6012385,prov1800,2018-02-19 11:23:00,5010,"Agree with a trip on lac suel if you find a lodge with openings.another option is Clarke's northern light resort.its on cedar lake,good fishing with crappies as a bonus.great equipment and you won't have to buy any bait as it's free as much as you need.your boat is right out front of your cabin.worth checking out."
6012489,h8go4s,2018-02-19 12:02:00,1673,"Well, this is posted in the Canada forum, so we're assuming you're looking for a Canadian resort. But, since you don't list your location in your profile (my pet peeve), we have no idea if you mean Nova Scotia, British Columbia or anywhere in between. Where are you driving from?"
6012617,Wall-i-Lama,2018-02-19 13:16:00,1524,"I'd recommend Golden Eagle. Since you are looking at September, check out the rates page as they have a special fall deal which is about 1/2 off summer prices. We went last fall and the fishing was super.The owners are great and will help you with anything, including finding the fish.Good luck and have a great trip!http://www.lacseulsgoldeneagleresort.com/"

6016817,Bill Krejca,2018-02-21 07:38:00,6107,"Standard issue for me is several sets of ear plugs on each trip. Snoring can really be an issue for those of us trying to sleep. We had one guy who could no longer stand the snoring, purposely broke his cot in the tent so he could sleep in the adjacent truck at the camp ground. Another trip, one guy decided he wouldn't torture the rest any longer and chose to sleep in the topper, rather than our tent. Turned out later, however, he was more afraid of bears than being considerate. We could still hear his snoring from the topper, some 40 feet away from the tent.The stories I could tell! Bill"
6016993,jambi,2018-02-21 09:11:00,504,"I found that my snoring buddies really don't bother me, maybe than just the first night a little. I fish so hard, eat so much and drink just enough that I am so exhausted I never hear them!"
