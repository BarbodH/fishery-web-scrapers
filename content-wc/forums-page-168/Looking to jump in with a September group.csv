For the past 20 years or so, I've been fortunate enough to be able to make two and often three trips per year. However as we all know, the only constant in life is that life is never constant. I lost my September fishing partner in January when my 88 year-old dad passed away. I still have a June trip planned when I take my wife and two sons to Lac Seul, but I'd like to pull something together for September. I don't really have much for local fishing buddies, not ones that are willing to travel to Canada, anyway. Anybody have an open seat they're looking to fill? I'm pretty flexible and would consider about anything in NW Ontario. Maybe somebody has a group flying in to an outpost and one of the wives pulled the chain so now there's an open seat. I'd consider that. Maybe there's a group of newbies that wouldn't mind having someone along that has an idea of where to go and what to do when you get there. I'd consider that. Maybe there's a team of Victoria's Secret models that would like to reconnect with nature. I'll connect with you. I live in Cedar Rapids, IA. Ideally, I'd meet up with a local group, but it wouldn't have to be. I've got a good boat and a comfortable ride to pull it. Shoot me a message if you'd like to talk."

Pretty time of the year in Ontario. Fall colors really getting started and fish are cooperative.Good luck.(email sent)Pooch"
