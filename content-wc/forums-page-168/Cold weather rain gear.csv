6032809,stumcfar,2018-03-01 09:10:00,451,I am looking for advice for cooler weather rain gear. I am looking for something for early and late season use. Any recommendations on brands that you guys like. Thanks in advance.
6032825,bthomas3333,2018-03-01 09:23:00,465,They are having a rocking good sale over on Cabelas for their Extreme Late Season Bibs and Jackets. Marked down from 319 to 149 but sizes are getting pretty limited. The bibs are really insulated well. I can get away with light weight pants and no long underwear down to 40s.B-
6032881,prov1900,2018-03-01 09:42:00,544,"Cabela's Guidewear or BPS 100 MPH with layering (as needed). Stormr with very little layering. I have all three and my favorite is the Guidewear. Layering gear has gotten so much better, so if you have a Gore-Tex shell, it doesn't have to be insulated. Look to First Lite for layering, or Cabela's fleece. Both are great."

6033185,stumcfar,2018-03-01 11:42:00,451,Is the Guidewear way too warm for early season boat fishing. Isn't that made more for ice fishing?
6033505,prov1800,2018-03-01 14:08:00,5010,The extreme stuff is a little on the warm side for me in spring or fall.but I fish into Oct and Nov here in Canada.you would appreciate it then.i use the regular guide wear most of the time.just wear some warm stuff underneath.it keeps the wet out and the wind.the two main cold factors.the extreme stuff already had thinsulate in it.cant zip it out.might as well wear a thinsulate jacket underneath the regular stuff.but there tough and worth the money.and yeah those sale prices are pretty awesome.
6034153,Aspencreek,2018-03-01 17:40:00,2911,"I'm with the earlier post with using NON-Insulated bibs and coat, and simply put on a polar fleece jacket or sweatshirt under and layer, then I can take off as needed. I have a set of bibs and coat that is insulated and only use it when ice fishing on COLD days. They are way to heavy to store properly in the cubbies in the boat and take up to much room."
6034465,grizzley,2018-03-01 20:20:00,2518,"Yes, mostly ice fishing and they are warm! Couple years ago another guy and I went up a river with a jet in 20deg. temps and at 28mph, plus we also fish at night in the spring and fall in cooler temps. My young fishing buddy and I both have the Striker hardwater and they are nice and comfy in the 38-45 deg. temp range at night. Needless to say we don't need to layer too much under them. Just mentioned them as an option, warm, waterproof, windproof, and some have flotation built in, they may be too warm for what you need them for but they have served me well."
6035857,valley366,2018-03-02 15:57:00,193,I go with layers and add as needed. Have Gander bibs and depending on temp go from jeans to long underwear and when gets extremely cold in November throw on the flannel jeans.For jacket it is the same. BPS 100MPH jacket with layers of flannel or fleece depending on temps.
