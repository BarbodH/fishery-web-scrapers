6032609,Moosebunk,2018-03-01 07:21:00,211,Doesn't even take a single fish on the Tree for any angler to understand that where they are and what they're fishing for is bliss enough. Add a 23 pounder and you've achieved something for yourself so few will ever get the chance. It's fishing heaven...
5975090,Moosebunk,2018-01-30 17:36:00,211,"A seed to one day fish for arctic char had been planted sometime in the late teens, early twenties. And it was these first short trips to Nunavut Canada with my wife Brenda which watered that seed. The Tree River is world class, holds world records, and yet I remember it seemed not quite of this world. Above the treeline is a place where the grizzly bear, arctic wolf, caribou or muskox could be seen just over the next ridge. Summer is 24 hours of daylight yet may last only two or three months without ice and snow. It is also home to one of the most delicious and incredible fish that swims, especially at the Tree River. I've always enjoyed writing and so took some time to piece together two pieces of two trips into one ""sorta"" story about fishing arctic char. Some inspiring landscapes and intensely beautiful fish can be found in this look back... A NUNAVUT NOMAD III. TREE RIVER ROOTS. Read on here if you like.http://bunksoutdoorangle.com/a-nunav...e-river-roots/ ThanksBunk."

5976386,prov1900,2018-01-31 12:50:00,544,Amazing! Thank you!
5976434,turkeyriver,2018-01-31 13:19:00,80,"Just...........,Wow!!!"
5976562,dhottle,2018-01-31 14:56:00,163,Beautifully written. I got to go a year after Presinent Bush was there and you brought back a lot of memories. Thanks again!
5976586,DeBo,2018-01-31 15:03:00,211,Those reports never get old!! That would be quite an adventure!
5976762,andreindy,2018-01-31 18:04:00,308,"Very enjoyable read. Also made me want to proclaim to my wife: ""See, SOME women DO like to fish!""...and then quickly duck."
5976890,adempsey2.0,2018-01-31 19:24:00,612,Always nice to read about your fishing experiences. I also agree that those Char are really quite special and what a beautiful place that is.
5976962,Shortline,2018-01-31 20:01:00,234,Bunk - all I can say is simply THANK YOU for taking me with on these trips. You write well.
5981858,Moosebunk,2018-02-03 08:15:00,211,"Could I ask specifically where, when and what was best? Have looked into the float trips a little and am interested. Also, there's a possibility I could be on Baffin Island this summer for a month. Currently considering work in maybe Pond Inlet, Clyde River, Arctic Bay or Kimmirut although, Coral Harbour and Cambridge Bay are the front runners.Quote: Originally Posted by dhottleBeautifully written.

Thanks again!Could not imagine what that fishing could have been like for the first anglers who arrived there, but any who have gone are lucky souls.Quote: Originally Posted by andreindyVery enjoyable read.

Wives are more than half the battle to get fishing, but if anything like mine, they make it worth the effort by making trips like these ten times the joy.Quote: Originally Posted by adempsey2.0Always nice to read about your fishing experiences.
