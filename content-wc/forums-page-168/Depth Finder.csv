6025441,Larry S,2018-02-25 12:02:00,665,Go to Ebay and try to find a Hummingbird Piranha Portable. It Uses AA batteries EIGHT You can bring another set along. Two sets will do for a weeks fishing
6025457,turkeyriver,2018-02-25 12:21:00,80,"Second the Humminbird PiranhaMAX 165. B&W screen pretty much depth only but does mark fish some. Runs all week on the 8 AA pack box. Works great on our fly-ins. I have never had an issue with the suction cup, but tie it in just in case."
6026137,gordy28,2018-02-25 17:01:00,437,Similar to the Pirhana max we have 2 Eagle Cuda 168 portables. It runs a off of 8 aas.Bought one new way back when and got the other off of EBay. We find that we go through 1 set of batteries in 5 days or so. For the suction cup we just make sure we tie off to the transom so that if it does pop it doesn't end up in the prop. My thought is to get something that runs off of d or aas eBay or classifieds are your best bet Cheers Gordy
6026153,retire55,2018-02-25 17:10:00,1029,Any fish finder can be used for remote trips - you just need to supply sufficient power. Fly-in trips have different requirements due to weight restrictions. I've been using a Lowrance HDS7 (colour sonar/GPS combination) since 2009 on my remote trips. My power supply is a 51 amp hour deep cycle battery and it provides sufficient power for a 6 day fishing trip (8 to 10 hours per day).
6027889,adempsey2.0,2018-02-26 15:52:00,612,"Your options for new are very limited if you want to stick with built in AA or D-cell batteries. Humminbird Fishin' buddy is one.Otherwise, you will need to buy used as others have mentioned.The other option is buy whatever unit you want and decide what 12V battery you want to use with it. If you want to stick with D-Cells, then you buy a 8 or 10 cell battery holder and wire that up.B&W, small screen and non-GPS models typically use less power, so your batteries should last longer.Easiest thing to do is buy used model that uses AA/D-cells. Otherwise, I suggest purchasing a portable (new or used) from Lowrance, Humminbird, Garmin etc.. and use the 12V SLA AGM batteries that come with the portable models. If you cannot (or don't want to) use the 12V SLA battery, then put together a battery pack yourself. Plenty of info on the internet on how to do this. The people fishing out of kayaks do it all the time."
6028409,grizzley,2018-02-26 20:34:00,2518,"Almost any FF can be made portable, here's a Humminbird 597ciHD that I made into a portable for ice fishing. It uses a 12V9AH battery, and if I were to use it on a boat as a portable I would secure the transducer onto a board and clamp the board onto the boat instead of using suction cups as others suggested."
6035833,Aspencreek,2018-03-02 15:33:00,2911,"I have 2 portable hummingbird units that run off one of those 4"" x 4"" Square batteries (not sure what Voltage or wattage, but available anywhere) I will go thru 1-2 batteries over a week and they work as well as anything else. I do put on a safety chord on the transducer in addition to the chord, but I also will mount it on a 1x3 and C clamp it on the rear of the boat."
6024593,ILScott,2018-02-25 06:14:00,139,I am trying to do some research on a good portable depth finder to take into a remote camp. The camp doesn't have electricity and the depth finder I have now uses D batteries. I would like something similar.
6024777,prov1900,2018-02-25 07:53:00,544,"Vexilar FL-18? Or something similar in an ice pack maybe. Those batteries last a long time. Even though you don't have electricity, you could always bring more than one battery. I can get a solid two, maybe three days out of mine. Helix 7 with GPS would be another option."
6024817,spurs101,2018-02-25 08:08:00,635,Take a look at a solar charging panel. Might be an option if you need to go with a 7amp battery system. I have an older unit that is d cell mono but am trying to upgrade.
6024841,Mojo-NC,2018-02-25 08:10:00,1929,"I use a Garmin portable unit that has been discontinued. When it dies I'll go with one of the following: Garmin, Humminbird and Lowrance all make a portable bag kit that can be used to make several of their units portable. Some considerations: a large screen uses more battery, color uses more battery, faster ping speed uses more battery. My camp has electricity so I use a single portable rechargeable gel cell battery. My unit also came with the 8 D-Cell battery adapter as well, but I don't need to use it. If you really need only sonar to find the depth, the drop offs and submerged rocks and humps, get a smaller unit with sonar only. If you need the other bells and whistles, plan to go through some batteries over the course of the week. Another option would be to turn the unit off when you don't absolutely need it. Good luck and tight lines!"
6024849,Pooch,2018-02-25 08:11:00,4618,"One of the best remote camp depth finders was the Zercom LCD flasher. I could run two weeks all day everyday on one small/medium sized gel cell. Somebody bought them (might have been Vexilar) and stopped selling them. I suppose they bought them for the patents then incorporated those into their own machines.I still have two for the day we might go back and do a fly-in or two. They were very good units.The newer non color low end LCD depth finders of today are not bad if you can find one. Everyone today wants color, but they take more battery.Sorry I was of no help, but just sharing my experience. Find the most efficient name brand and carry extra batteries (which are weight killers)Pooch"
6024921,Pooch,2018-02-25 08:33:00,4618,"Someone mentioned not getting a sonar/gps combo unit. Not sure they are available, but if you find one without gps then buy a hand held gps. That is what I did for many years and it worked well.I've used an old Eagle battery box for my remote trips and it works well. Old picture is of my remote trip setup using the Eagle box, Zercom flasher and old Garman gps unit. Still a great setup, but nothing in the picture is available anymore. Might find the battery box on ebay though. Eagle battery box contains enough room for a gel cell and box of jigs and plastics.Just food for thought.Pooch"
6024929,Camoclad,2018-02-25 08:35:00,628,"We take a couple of Eagle Fishmark 320 finders that use D batteries. One set of batteries lasts all week every time. It is a b/w unit. Here is one on eBay: https://www.ebay.com/itm/Portable-EA...kAAOSwhrRakb7q Only problem we have had was the suction cup doesn't like to stay stuck to the camp boats. Attach to a piece of one by and clamp to the transom is an easy fix. The newer stuff is great, we just happen to have these and we really only use it for the depth and contour. If I were buying new and didn't mind spending the money the Garmin portables look good."
6024961,Mojo-NC,2018-02-25 08:43:00,1929,"One additional suggestion, secure the portable unit to something inside your boat. On more than one occasion, the transducer suction cup has let go while running wide open with the outboard. Once it takes all 25' of the slack of the transducer cable and abruptly hits the end, it could jerk the entire unit right out the back of the boat. It has almost happened..."
6025121,yoopertrout,2018-02-25 09:36:00,1172,"I do a lot of float tube fishing, and use this:https://www.hodgesmarine.com/Vexilar...jqeniramsegdoh It isn't a fish locator, just depth finder. It's small and light, and I've taken it on fly ins."
6025161,maddogg,2018-02-25 10:28:00,178,"I take a scotch pad along and scrub a spot were i put my transducer. Make sure is just below the bottom of the boat and not by a bottom rib. Attach a safety line to the transducer and secure it to the back of the boat,make sure that the transducer can't get in to the prop."
