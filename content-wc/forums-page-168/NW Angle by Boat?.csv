6044881,That Minnesota guy,2018-03-07 06:18:00,8293,Have you noticed EVERY post you make looks like a cut & paste commercial for Tamarack. Might wanna change things up a bit.
6039561,musky_guy,2018-03-04 19:04:00,4,"Greetings, Am considering a trip to the Angle for mid-June, and am reading up on the proposition. I understand the ""over-land"" route can be time-consuming, and hard on the finish of a truck and/or boat. l know a boat trip is about 25 miles one-way. I downsized to a 165 Classic CS with a 70 hp 4-stroke last year. With gear and one other fisherman, I could travel 25+ mph in reasonable water. Wind and waves would certainly change the rate of travel/speed. If the winds are predominantly out of the west, there's probably some relief from the western shore of LOTW. Water travel would also avoid the customs hassle. Does anyone have any experience with the water route . . . like ""not bad"" or ""avoid at all costs""? I don't throw for muskies as much anymore . . . now that I'm older. We'd probably fish for walleyes and smallies most of the time, but would allocate parts of most days to muskies. Is the Canadian muskie opener productive . . . assuming ""normal"" weather this spring?? Thanks in advance for any insights you share!"

If you can pick your days, very doable.It is closer to 35 miles from Warroad. I trailer my boat up 95% of the time.Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-G920A using Tapatalk"

6042449,fishingfrenzy,2018-03-06 05:42:00,262,Nice! Hope you are able to go to the games this weekend - let me know if you swing through Warroad. Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-G920A using Tapatalk

6044521,musky_guy,2018-03-06 20:04:00,4,"Good point. Based on all the feedback, I'm thinking that boating across LOTW isn't the best idea. :-)"
6044801,cnsrtv308,2018-03-07 05:34:00,4,"Hey, just read your post. If your looking for a good drive/boat to place on LOTW look at Tamarack Island Wilderness Lodge. It's a boat to camp out of Morson Ont so you don't have that ""angle drive"" to contend with. Paved roads all the way from the boarder to Morson. It's then a 20/30 minute boat ride from the marina to the island. The camp itself is awesome, great cabins, 24 hour electric (sometimes island camps don't give you that) new pier that's all wired, you pull to the dock plug, simple. Most importantly the fishing is second to none. I fished eagle for years until a buddy invited me on a trip to LOTW, never been back to eagle since. Musky fishing is fantastic, and the walleye and small mouth is the best I've ever had. Todd the camp owner is a great guy, he has really cares and does everything he can to make your trip great. I've been going up there for years and have never been dissatisfied! Check them out."
6044809,patrick,2018-03-07 05:38:00,277,I have voted a crossed many times but Mike said in an earlier post you can be limited on when you have to come back the weather obviously plays a huge role if you're on an absolute schedule I would definitely drive I have been caught more than once
