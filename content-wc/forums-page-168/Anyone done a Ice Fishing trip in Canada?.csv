I've been to a lot of resorts in NW Ontario to ice fish, and Winoga stands way above the rest when it comes to the hosts taking care of the guests. It would be a great place to get your feet wet on ice fishing Canada. Late March/early April is a popular time due to longer days, warmer weather, and easier travel conditions. Personally I love January up there. Cold, quiet, and beautiful - winter wonderland."

6037625,johnboat,2018-03-03 20:41:00,2014,"I was at Five Lakes Lodge on Gullrock, just south of Red Lake, this January. AWESOME! Either fish Gullrock or lakes not accessible by boats that are a beautiful snow machine ride away and infested with hungry walleyes. Top notch equipment and very nice comfy cabins. A word of caution:.........you'll want to cancel all future Spring soft water trips. Give Ian a call."
