6015017,MrSimon,2018-02-20 10:50:00,922,8 or 10 pound braid (I like power pro) and a 2 foot floro leader.
6015665,prov1800,2018-02-20 16:14:00,5010,I think there all equally good.i like the suffix cause they have a variety of colors and that are easy to see.i use some orange line and a lime green color and never loose track of them.i double uni some moss color to the colored line and use a floura leader.not that important vertical jigging but sure is nice when making casts especially on windy days.
6011569,BIGMANBIGPIKE,2018-02-19 06:48:00,8,"Any suggestions on line for jigging? Brand, type, poundage? Thank you all in advance"
6011761,BornToFish,2018-02-19 07:59:00,1224,"Greetings,Your question is akin to asking which is the better brand of pickup truck: Chevrolet or Ford or .....? There are lots of opinions out there, and they are all correct.I've tried a few types of fishing line when jig fishing for walleyes, but keep coming back to six pound monofilament (mostly Trilene) that is tied to a SPRO #10 power swivel. I then run a piece of six pound fluorocarbon (mostly Berkley Vanish) as a dropper to my jig.I have friends that insist braids are the best way to go. They like the increased sensitivity.I sincerely believe there isn't a universal ""best choice"" for a fishing line when jig fishing. It's just what works best for you.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6011769,last chance,2018-02-19 08:01:00,3262,i like to use 15# or 20# 832 suffix with fluro leader.
6011873,Golden Eagle,2018-02-19 08:33:00,2642,"I hope the better truck is Ford, because I factory ordered mine January 26.I like 10# Power Pro with 10# Seaguar Fluorocarbon leader material. From mid July to mid August I have one reel with 15# Power Pro and 15# fluorocarbon because I tend to hook into nice pike during that time, when big pike are actively feeding on walleyes."
6011905,bthomas3333,2018-02-19 08:52:00,465,"I will try the negative approach to my advice. Here are situations where the different options don't work that well.Braid - I don't like braid in situations where you have M or MH power rods with XF tips. This is especial true if you invested in very high end rods. In these situations you have very little give in the whole system. If the fish are really biting and smaller it doesnt matter if you lose the lip hooked fish, but if you are into bigger fish I think this matters. I think this presentation will lose barely hooked fish at a higher rate.100% Floro - I dont like this option when casting the jigs in rocks. The whole system sinks. If you stop your retrieve to swat a mosquito you are getting the line snagged. Maybe not the jig but the line itself. Annoying to get snagged more often.Mono - I dont love mono when fishing in the rocks or where you have a decent shot at bigger pike. The nicks are really annoying and I find I have to constantly retie. I also dont like mono when you use ML power with med or fast action rods. I think the whole system is to slow to get good hook sets. Missed hook sets.A lot of guys like to combine the best of both worlds with Braid w/ Floro leader. I guess the only downside there is the extra knots and you still have a system with almost no stretch. If you blend it with a slower action tip it makes a lot of sense.My two cents...B-"
6012105,David Anderson,2018-02-19 10:13:00,2073,"My go to line these days is P-Line CX Premium in 8# test. It has the same diameter as standard 6# mono from Stren or Trilene. It is very strong and has stretch but not as bad as the standard mono's I referenced. I always have a rod with Suffix 832 however I tend to use this when casting plastics for walleye as if fishing with a plain jig and minnow combination, braid is much less forgiving and tend to have less hookups because of the no stretch, just pulls it out of their mouth. I've come to like this line so much I buy it by the 3000 yard spool."
6012129,Wall-i-Lama,2018-02-19 10:17:00,1524,"Any brand of braided or fused superline in small test, either in 6# or 8#. I use 6# Berkley fire line. While rated at 6#, break strength is significantly higher. This is the case with most superlines. We have not lost large fish with smaller line, but do find that it is a little easier to break off from snags when needed. If it is very clear water, or the fish are negative, I will tie on a fluoro leader. Good luck!"
6012337,prov1800,2018-02-19 11:16:00,5010,I think whatever you think works and feels best.i personally have been using braids since they came out.you just need to get used to them.hook sets need to be lighter as compared to mono.i tend to use suffix more but I don't change it out often and when I do I just peel it off my reel on another and basically I have new line on.i like 10 # braid and I use gamma for a leader one in the 6-8 #.i don't use swivels much as I double uni the two lines together.i do use all high end st Croix rods in the extra fast actions.dont have any problems hooking fish of any species.just have to get used to setting the hook lighter and let the reel do it's job.getting hung up is diff with braid as it will cut your hand so I always have something I can wrap braid on to pull hard and always leader line will break easy.everybody to his own I guess.all my rods are rigged like that and if I get guys in my boat using my rods they don't seem to mind and actually like it saying they feel there is more sensitivity.i use the same set up right now ice fishing using the suffix ice line which tends not to freeze up as bad but still will on colder days.i tie on 10# suffix ice flouracarbon just cause i fish for lake trout a lot and they do put up a good fight down to 60 ft.but again you need a good reel.
6012729,The tank,2018-02-19 13:41:00,340,I get to test alot of line and I used to be one that used braided line. once seagur came out with tatsu thats all I use now for jigging walleye. It's not cheap but what is when your fishing. i use 10lb mostly because its the same dia of 8lb mono.
6012825,martinbns,2018-02-19 14:08:00,1520,"I use 10 pound Power Pro with 10 lb Pline flouro leader. If I get snagged, I keep an ice fishing glove handy to break the line and it's always the leader that breaks. I had 8 pound PP loaded on a reel by mistake and hated it, found it too limp and almost impossible to tie on a leader. I use an Alberto knot to tie in the leader. I have pretty high end rods with fast/xfast tips and have had no issues."
