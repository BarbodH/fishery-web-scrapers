558674,Mohleye,2006-06-21 08:54:00,368,"I am curious to know more, also. Here is my 2 cents worth. We have also used plain plastic twister tails tipped with a minnow, leech, or piece of crawler. In the spring, minnows seem to be best, later leeches and crawlers produce at least as well. I prefer leeches to crawlers, but I think it has more to do with ease than effectiveness. I have no experience with the gulp type baits, other than a couple guys bringing a pack or two a few years ago. They caught fish, but not as many. I know they keep improving them. My question to the gulp fans is: Why do you prefer them to live bait? Like to hear some input. I'm an old dog, but not above trying something new."
558681,Guest,2006-06-21 09:48:00,0,"loco, Im with you. Had great luck last week with white twister tail and half a crawler. Altough my son used Gulp plain and did well the crawler tip caught more. We stop at Cabelas in Owattana and pick up a flat of crawlers (500) for $50."
558684,Guest,2006-06-21 12:05:00,0,"Curious, I might add that we go to Lac Seul to the Chamberland Narrows area. We have always gone in late July/early August. Being from WI I do agree that minnows are the bait of choice early in the season and that is likely true in Canada. I may also point out that when fishing the plain twisters as soon as the crawler piece is gone, even in the hottest bite, the bites drop dramatically. Scent seems to be the key and the twisters seem to add bulk and action. If scent is the key it seems that crawlers are the best attracters from our experienc. Gulp and other scented baits I am sure would out perform plain plastics, but as been said over and over again, nothing outperforms natural bait. I've concluded that scented plastics tipped with any natural bait probably are not particularly more productive than plain plastics tipped with live bait. Furthermore plain plastics are dirt cheap when compared to the cost of the scented and the plain also seem to be much more durable. Will be leaving for Lac Seul July 16, can't wait. Anyone have any reports from the Chamberland Narrows area? PS Two of us in six days of fishing average 800 to 1000 walleys."

558823,tjsker,2006-06-25 06:46:00,301,"Since there are so many gulp baits out there, can someone post a link to show me what you actually use? Thanks"
558824,orchard frank,2006-06-25 08:58:00,1900,"I've had real good luck with larger (3-4"") tube baits on a jig when they seem a little fussy. The pumpkinseed or other yellowish colors worked best for me on Lac Seul. The tube has a much more subtle action than twisters, I would bring it in with a lot of gliding, not hopping it off the bottom, using a light enough jig that it doesn't sink too fast. Covers water well also, when they hit it, it will be engulfed, not nibbled. Good Luck"
558826,Ia Walihntr,2006-06-25 11:05:00,320,"tjsker, Here is the link that shows all the Gulp! products.http://www.berkley-fishing.com/cat.php?k=44157 Gulp! bait is not plastic but 100% biodegradable material. It's advertised to hold 400 times more scent than plastic baits. Marv"
558840,Mohleye,2006-06-26 08:44:00,368,"That's a very good point. I've never tried tubes, but am going to pick up few and give them a try this year. I've had the same experience sometimes with bucktail or maribou jigs. And tube jigs always outfish the twisters for crappies around here."
558848,Guest,2006-06-26 12:55:00,0,I used Gulp exclusively on my spinner rigs last week while my partner was a nightcrawler guy. We caught the same amount of fish. He was on on some days when I was on on others. The hotter colors for me were Chartreuse and red with Pumpinseed and Watermellon doing some good.
558852,Mohleye,2006-06-26 13:27:00,368,"I plan to try some Gulp baits, too. How do you guys use them? On a spinner rig I assume it takes the place of the live bait. How about with a jig? Just the Gulp on a bare jighead, or with a plastic tail?"
558604,JJW,2006-06-19 19:38:00,203,"Taking 2 of my daughters to Eagle lake ,Ontario.I have fished it a few times but I don't think I can afford buying minnow all week.Any ideas on some plastic,gulp,power baits that would work? Thanks JIM"
558607,Trailerguy,2006-06-19 21:22:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Gulp works about as well as minnows, I like chartruse up to 3"" . Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
558620,Guest,2006-06-20 08:13:00,0,"3"" Gulp Black Leeches work great. Don't leave home without them! Thread them on the jighead like you would a twister tail, they seem to work better that way. Chuck"
558626,Crappie Kid,2006-06-20 08:40:00,1581,Berkley Blade Dancer has been very productive for us.
558627,Guest,2006-06-20 08:45:00,0,"What has really been working well the past few weeks are Rapala tail dancers or shad raps trolled in 9-12 feet of water over mud flats and weed edges. On Eagle, the live bait will always outproduce plastics but it can work especially if back trolled on spinners or crawler rigs. To reduce your bait costs I would suggest bringing up some crawlers with you (packed in artificial bedding).....they will catch just as many, if not more, walleye on Eagle at this time of year. Chartreuse jig or spinner rig work the best."
558632,Guest,2006-06-20 09:54:00,0,"All of those will work. Those 3"" Gulp ""Black Shad"" catch anything."
558645,grt1,2006-06-20 12:49:00,259,"gee all this talk about gulp, I was going to suggest Visa or American Express."
558650,Guest,2006-06-20 13:56:00,0,Definitely! Those are the best plastics around. Nothing can touch them for versatility. You would be surprised what you can catch with that Visa plastic. ;)
558658,Guest,2006-06-20 16:02:00,0,"Just use any old twister tail, pick your favorite color, and tip with a piece of nightcrawler and you will catch twice as many fish as any plain plastic or gulp bait on the market. Further more after fishing plain minnows, leeches, and worms we have found plain plastics tipped with nighcrawlers fished as well as anything. The great part is that most of the time a piece of nightcrawler will catch multiple fish before it is lost. Thus a dozen crawlers cut into 3 pieces times multiple fish translates into some pretty economical bait bills. We will also tip the plastics with leeches and do just as well. They can keep the four dollar a dozen minnows. We quit using them several years ago!! Would like to hear some of you others opinions and experences with this."
558670,Guest,2006-06-20 22:02:00,0,"I was just on Lac Seul for a week. I had great success with 3"" Gulp in the Chartreuse with a piece of crawler on a 1/4 ounce jig. I also used orange and did well. I will be bringing Gulp on all of my trips in the future"
