558694,Guest,2006-06-21 15:09:00,0,I travel to Minaki every year and have used the Navionics Gold chip for the western Great lakes. It includes Lake of the Woods and also the Minaki region. I'm not sure the exact number of that chip but it is the one that includes Lake Superior. Seems quite accurate from what I have observed. Got me back safely when a massive fog bank rolled in a couple years ago and I could barely see my partner in the front of the boat. Check out Navionics web sight. Dean

I don't think they're making this chip anymore, and have merged the chip data with other data. South of Minaki, the Hot Spots Ontario map is good. Chuck"

Since you didn't indicate what GPS unit you have and allowing for the fact that no one on this site has ESP you'll also have to check whether your unit is compatible with the XL3-900G chip! My chip includes the Minaki area. dockehr Dr. Roland E. Kehr, Jr. Lindy Tackle"
