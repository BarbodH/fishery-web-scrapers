558803,Guest,2006-06-23 21:40:00,0,"Morson Resident: You say this is a needless tragedy....if some has a houseboat that is locked up and these people break into it by breaking a patio door then there is something wrong here. Reports indicate that they went ""fishing""...that is soooo BS!!! Why don't they print the facts that these 4 natives were breaking into cabins/houseboats looking for valuables and booze and that is all. Yes, it is tragic they are this young, but where does the line end on all these B & E's? Should there not be some type of accountability here on the part of the two that were found. I'm sure what will happen, because they are under the age of majority, is that the authorities will sweep this one under the rug....I hope not. Not holding my breath"
558827,Guest,2006-06-25 13:03:00,0,if this is true maybe we should readjust the penaltys. double everything for all crimes or triple and dont support them while they are in prison. let the fmilys bear the hardship of support while they are in jail. I for one am against using taxpayer money to support criminal while they are in jail. if their fmilys refuse to support them let them starve. my 2 cents.
558829,Guest,2006-06-25 17:21:00,0,This is Canada not Texas. Natives are held close to the heart and pocketbook. Where else can you hold an area hostage as in Southern Ontario and not get the Army in. This is deaper than that though. It is the inability of our government to deal with the situation. On another note SHAME to all those who frequent native run casinos and buying their smuggled smokes and booze . The only way we will clean this up if we hit them where it hurts. Stop spending and their own will turn on them......

By Miner and News Staff Friday June 16, 2006 Search and rescue teams were continuing to comb the Sabaskong Bay area of Lake of the Woods by air and by boat this morning in search of two boaters missing since Wednesday evening. Members of the Kenora Ontario Provincial Police Marine Unit, along with the OPP's Northwest Region Emergency Response Team are checking all the islands in the Sabaskong Bay area, west of Morson, in an effort to find the two missing men. As of this morning, the search was still ongoing with the help of volunteer searchers, the OPP helicopter and Lake of the Woods Search and Rescue. Just before 1 p.m. Thursday, the police were notified that a passing boater had located two young men on different islands in Sabaskong Bay. The two other men who had been with them were missing. The group  all four are from the Morson-Big Grassy area  had left the night before, at approximately 7 p.m., to go fishing. Sometime in the early morning hours their boat struck an object and all four were thrown into the water. The two men who were found told police they were able to use seat cushions to help them swim to shore. They were not injured and did not require medical attention. None of the four, however, were wearing life jackets when the collision occurred. The OPP have located the 16-foot aluminum boat, with a 40-horsepower Mercury outboard. It has substantial damage to the bottom."

The command post was at the Govt. dock and there were a ton of people involved. Hats off to the folks who are working on the search, true hero's."

558698,Guest,2006-06-21 15:49:00,0,"Certainly a tragedy to be sure. However, it's nice to know that so many resouces will be made available from now on when a boater ends up missing . There sure wasn't as much activity last time a boater wasn't able to be found right away a couple of years back. FYI: There is a confirmed report that a houseboat that was beached in the area was broken into that same day/night of the accident. All the booze was taken. Needless tragedy."
558711,Guest,2006-06-22 06:59:00,0,Just returned from LOTW. The police stopped by our lodge to tell the owner that the body was recovered. Told him that one of the survivors admitted that they were out breaking in to cabins when the accident happened.
558718,Guest,2006-06-22 11:40:00,0,"For what they were doing, breaking into cabins, all of them should of drown. Lowlife's if you ask me!"
558725,Guest,2006-06-22 15:42:00,0,I agree breaking into a cabin should be a capital offense in a counrty where DUI is a felony
