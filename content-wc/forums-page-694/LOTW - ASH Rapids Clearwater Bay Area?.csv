We have been fishing the Winnipeg river near Minaki for the last ten years and have had good success but thought it was time for a change. Looking for musky, bass and pike mainly. One more week until pure Canadian bliss! Thanks, IPS"

But we still get out to clearwater bay. Though we never fish it. We always go through mud portage into the next bays . We don't fish for muskey but some friends go there frequently for them I beleive it's echo bay. But the whole area I have had follow up walleye fishing. Over the years they have pulled numerious 48"" up to 56"" fish in there. Not a lot of real serious fishermen in the area ( mostly weekend warriors at the lake ) so there is always lots of virgin waters to fish the further you venture away from clearwater. A spot I would go to is the shoal lake narrows area. I've had a lot of big pike around there. Now I would have to say it's now an amazing walleye fishery again. Lots in the 28"" range with good chance's of 32"" fish . Sorry this time of year I can't remember where I would go to . I was more serious in July on. You may want to give clearwater a try for big lakers. The average in there start at 8 pounds and go up to 15. Jig with a tube jig. ( only single hook and no bait rule applies ) If it's bass your looking for I always caught lots around the entrance to cul du sac. But bass is good everywhere in that lake."

We'd love to try for Lakers, any hints presentations and locations would be great. I assume that they are getting pretty deep by this time? Thanks, IPS"
558464,Guest,2006-06-15 04:13:00,0,"Smallmouth bass fishing is great. Northern Pike not too bad either so I hear. Walleye fishing in the area is not too bad and the odd muskie is even being hit here and their. Lake trout can be caught in Echo Bay as mentioned, but do not over look Cul-de-Sac. A great spot and Ogema Bay has nice muskie action to boot. Below the rapids into Shoal Lake and the Narrows is very very good, but once again do not over look going out in and around Victoria Island and the Cork Screw Channel area. Over looked by many of Ash Rapids Guides, as they tend to head into Shoal Lake, when Ptarmigan is probably at times better."

558861,Guest,2006-06-26 19:12:00,0,"Hi, Thanks for the posts. Just got back. The fishing was very good. I heard that Walleye was slow, but we only focused on Pike, Muskie and Bass. There are a lot of quality pike in the area. We typically looked for bays with vegetation in 6' to 14' deep. Slowly working bucktails and spinnerbaits in these areas proved very productive. The biggest pike caught was 41.5"" We also caught about ten in the 36-38"" range and about thirty in the 30-35"" range. The bays on Zig Zag Island and in Ptarmingan Bay were very good. Also try the Labyrinth and Ogema Bays. Didn't see a lot of muskie follows, however I did catch a 42"" and had a 50+"" break my leader when I was reaching to pull it in the boat. The smallmouth were hitting great around the islands and rocking shores on our first day but seem to thin out greatly after that. We could still locate some but I think a combination of the fronts that came through and the seasonal migration to deeper water made them more difficult to find. Most were caught on tube jigs 2-5 deep. We also caught five largemouth bass, several of which were taken in seven feet of water on large spinnerbaits or bucktails. Not sure how this will all apply in September but I hope it helps... Good luck and be careful! IPS"
