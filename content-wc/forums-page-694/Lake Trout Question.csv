I will be heading to LOTWs is early Sept for Walleye, Musky and Bass but would like to take my Father in law ( first time to Canada) out to try for some Lakers a couple times during the week. When I usually go in May the Trout are still shallow in Whitefish Bay and are pretty easy to catch. What can expect in Sept, will they still be deep? What techniques should I try? I figure I should be able to find the fish in the same areas on Whitefish as I do in the spring. Thank you"

They could be anywhere from 65' to 120' deep, but I'd start with the deep holes first and them move shallower. Vertical jigging with Buzz Bombs, etc. would be in order. Good Luck."
558842,phishfearme,2006-06-26 08:58:00,1242,"in general, i think what rpieske says is correct but don't forget that the thermocline in these lakes is relatively shallow (just try swimming in them!!) and we've found that trolling big lipped, silver crank baits like fat raps, hot n tots, etc will produce well - as long as you have enough line out for the lure to track at 15-20 feet or so. this usually produces more but smaller trout while the deep jigging mentioned by bob will tend to produce larger but much fewer. we've also used something called a fish seeker (something like a dipsy but depth adjustable) to troll wabling spoons at various depths. good luck, phish"
558845,bronzeback77,2006-06-26 09:58:00,97,"Thank you for your replies. I always have luck in the spring around Russell, Annie, Twin and Timber Islands so I will just try your suggestions in those same general areas. Hopefully, I can get my father law a big fish he would talk about for the next ten years. Thank you"
