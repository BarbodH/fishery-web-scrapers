558799,voyaguer,2006-06-23 19:25:00,54,"I recently returned from the Minaki area . Fishing, particularly for walleyes was slow, not much different from that reported by quite a few others. A few years ago, a few Kenora locals explained to me about the netting going on in the LOTW and Winnipeg River area. I've seen some of the same pictures, letters to government (40K pounds per week) etc.that many of you have. I do beleive netting has had a negative impact, as well as the water regulations employed by the Lake of the Wood Conrol Board. I suppose the main objective of the LWCB may be more oriented towards hydro power production than resort fishing, so to an extent that is understandable - but be aware that it can impact fishing substantially. For what its worth, the place I stayed had excellent owners, facilities and equipment, and that made up for the slow fishing in my book. And if Muskies are your prey, then you would likely be rewarded. I also sought a surface\subsurface contour map for a 334i for the Winnipeg River. I was told repeatedly by ALL of the major retailers (you know who they are, like one starts with C, or BP or SS, etc.) that no such maps exist or if it does, they don't know anything about it. I logged 5 calls to Navionics who flatly denied each time they had any such product (this is particularly arduous as you are placed on hold for long periods of time). I called over 10 independent retailers in the USA and Canada to no avail. One outfit in Toronto offered to ""make"" one, but that would have been expensive and questionable reliability. One of the major retailer ""experts"" suggested calling LEI products and they did sell to me the Map Create series for Canada, claiming no bathymetric maps existed. The Map Create series provides relatively good surface map of the Winnipeg River (and most of Canada for that matter). I arrived at my destination near Minaki a few weeks ago and the gentleman who runs the lodge pulls out his mmc chip from Navionics that shows the bottom contours for most, it not all the river. Of course, it has a superior surface map of the area with more information than the map I installed. If I ran a business selling these products I suspect i would employ persons with good knowledge of my product and supply them with the product so they could have a reasonably intelligent discussion with a prospective consumer over the phone regarding the capabilities etc. For christ sake, all you have to do is put the stupid chip into any compatable gps and scroll to the location to see if there is coverage. But that is beyond the compentence of these people\companies. I wrote a message on this site several months ago inquiring as to how to best make a portable gps\sonar unit using products not advertised as portable. I received some good information regarding Gentz (sp?) boxes, which I researched and found would be good for ice fishing but didn't appear as handy for putting in a float plane etc. I did appreciate the advice I received from several of the ""locals"" on this site, but the Gentz box was not what i was looking for. I again went to the major retailers, and manufacturers of gps\sonar equipment and was referred solely to what they had in ""soft"" cases in their catalogues (""Great for that Canada fly in trip"") etc. I already have several of these lower echelon portables and really wanted to build a unit that had more power and sensitivity, not be watching what looks like a silly video game as I am fishing. I was about to give up until, after the third call to LEI, I was able to find a plastic hard case with a gimbrall bracket that would fit a 334i, 332, etc.. It wasn't easy to find this but once I did it was just what I was looking for. Kit came complete with suction cup for transducer, alternativer battery bracket etc. It looks similar to the typical Eagle cases, just different dimensions etc. and works with gel cell rechargeable or D cells etc. My point - is that the level of incompetence with these retailers and, even more so, manufacturers, is pathetic. I will give LEI some credit though, as at least they knew more than C, BP, SS, Lowrance combined, even though I believe they are primarily re-sellers ? So, don't take no for an answer and some competition would be welcome from my perspective. Epilouge on the 334i. Many posts on this unit have been negative. I purchased mine in March and didn't use it until two weeks ago except in my back yard. I did notice the gps side seemed erratic and ordered the update. Although Lowrance touted a ""downloadable"" update from their web site, when I inquired, it was not available as an internet download but with a credit card deposit you can upgrade from the 1.0.0 to 1.3.0 software version with a chip they will mail to you. It seemed to help. Using this as a portable may help also from the standpoint of being completely out in the open, so nothing to block the internal antennae. Overall, I'd give it a B- in performance. Its ok, but they should be able to do better. Take Care out there and trust your fishing is great ! (and please excuse my spelling etc.)"
558819,Guest,2006-06-24 19:18:00,0,mmc chip? A little more detail for us just starting with gps Thanks
558820,Reels,2006-06-24 20:45:00,2876,"I think that some older chips had Canadian maps on them, but the Canadian Government got their underwear in a knot about copy writes and made Navionics quite selling the area without royalties. Jeff from Navionics can confirm as it has been a few years and my memory is foggie.... <{{}}><"
558822,I Fish GS,2006-06-25 01:34:00,290,Which map did the resort have that worked in you 334. There is a few differant Navionic maps. Brian Rud
558864,voyaguer,2006-06-26 21:11:00,54,"I believe it was the Great Lakes West, Superior. It is one of the Hot Spots premier map chips, I beleive. I wrote down the information and will try to confirm for you, but anyone who sells this stuff should be able to place the chip in any mmc chip compatable unit and tell you exactly. someone else asked about mmc chips. Whatever you or the industry want to call them, they are the small data storage devices (drives) that the map companies will sell to you with different map areas and features. They are small, about the size of a thin quarter. If you have a gps unit that will accept map sets in installable chip format, you'll know that, and you'll be able to order up various ""chips' with map information. Ideally, you would want to get a reader, so you can import portions of map information from a purchased ""chip"" onto your gps unit thru a desktop-laptop or similar computer with serial or usb cable. Certain maps sets are sold, optionally, with such a reader. Another way to obtain importable map information is to have a gps unit that has interal memory and can attach to a computer via serial or usb cable. In these days, the map data usually comes in the form of a cd with program to interface with your gps, and you have options to chose the data (map areas etc. )to download to your gps. The amount of memory in your gps will impact how much map data you can download at any one time."
