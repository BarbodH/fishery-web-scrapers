558444,Mr. Walleye,2006-06-14 10:35:00,74,"Mista: Do you or anyone else out there know anything about Medicine Stone Resort near Red Lake. Accomodations, fishing in Medicine Stone Lake, their outpost lakes? Thanks! Mister"
558619,Guest,2006-06-20 07:55:00,0,Leaving next Friday. Looking forward to some last minute posts. I'll be sure to post after our trip.
558622,Guest,2006-06-20 08:16:00,0,"Medicine Stone, A trout lake with a variety of fish. Not sure about the camp, never been there. I've fished there in the winter a few times and also did well. My buddy enjoys going there often, not too far from Madsen. Lots of lakes around that area, flat lake has musky and small mouth bass. Parker.. Mista W"
558624,Guest,2006-06-20 08:34:00,0,"Well what can I say, Red Lake fishing has been great. Morning and evening the best. I've been out everyday for the past 5 days. The only slow area for myself this week was the Keg area. Mind you I only spent one day in Keg... East Bay still hot, Upper Chukuni always good, McNeelie Bay good, Behind McKenzie Island good...I'm heading out this morning, testing a new boat...Going to try some of the Islands in Howey Bay. Red Lakes little secret. After some of the local fishing tournaments some of the walleyes get dropped directly in Howey Bay. I believe some of the walleyes move onto the nearby Islands in the Bay.. I've done well in the last two years... Honey Holes by Mista W"
558642,Guest,2006-06-20 11:26:00,0,Heading up next Wednesday. We are doing a fly in trip with Howey bay resort. We will be at there Odin Lake out-post any info would be helpfull.
558712,Guest,2006-06-22 07:55:00,0,Are there any trout stream opportunties around Red Lake? Any stream names would be appreciated.
558876,Guest,2006-06-27 08:26:00,0,Any fishing reports or surrounding trout stream information for the Red Lake area?
558131,Guest,2006-06-06 22:07:00,0,It's hammer time... East Bay is on fire at the moment....Fat and hungry lunkers..I cruised up the river last Sunday and wow. Upper Chukuni provided ample feed and some quality size fish.. Me and my partner must of caught over 60 walleye but not one pike. And can you say Red Neck... hehehe. The sun had it's way with me... I'll be black in about a week...McNeelie bay was a little slow for me but I know some people did really well.. Must be that walleye chop....Going fishin' tomorrow. Still looking for that 28 incher...

558135,Guest,2006-06-07 07:28:00,0,"Mista keep the post coming. I can't wait for June 30th. In fact, I've already started packing or should I say ""making a pile""."
558141,millerltman,2006-06-07 08:45:00,12,"Mistawalleye..sounds like you did hammer them. I will be at sportsmans in 9 days, can't wait. Have you ever fished the Chukuni where it flows out on little v. for walleye? Keep getting reports from other people that it's a hot bed for eye's on the evening bite."
558156,Schooner,2006-06-07 15:31:00,1,"Hammer time indeed! East Bay was excellent on Saturday. Probably the best I have ever seen it.....I typically struggle in that area for some reason but pulled in some impressive walleyes (24"", 26.5""). Caught some nice underslots as well...threw all back but kept four nice eaters (15 -17 inchers). McNeely Bay has been slow lately.....lots of boats but not many pulling in fish. Slate Bay and Big Goldseekers were also productive on the weekend. Giddie-up Anglers! Schooner"
558211,Guest,2006-06-08 21:56:00,0,"Ahhh... What a beautiful day today, and yesterday was nice also... I took my buddy out to upper chukuni..He does a little guiding out at Lac Seul.. Ken lives on the Lac Seul...He had an hour to burn so we decided to catch a quick feed... We get to my favorite little hole and bam,bam, bam... 6 minutes= four 16inchers... He couldn't stop laughing... He caught 3 of them with one minnow then he asked me if I was going to fish? I hadn't dropped my line in the water yet... I love those kind of days... Ken's going to take me for a tour of Lac Seul this fall... Should be fun... Catch me a couple of Master Anglers... Happy fishing Mista W[email protected]"
558242,pikemike,2006-06-09 12:23:00,95,"sounds like you had a blast, it's good to see a little more water flowing over the 'kuni falls. were the eagles out?"
558305,Guest,2006-06-11 21:34:00,0,"Yeppers, Actually I took some nice pics of an eagle munching on a small walleye up in a tree... Eagles have to eat too... Mista W"

558373,sidewinder,2006-06-12 20:05:00,96,"I guarantee the evening bite,watch out for those nasty 40-48"" pike that cruise the edges of the outflow. sidewinder"
558431,Guest,2006-06-14 07:35:00,0,"I know it is catch and release for the lake trout, because they are having some reproduction trouble. I understand they are huge and I won't mind hooking into a couple. I was thinking about vertical jigging spoons or trolling deep diving cranks over deep water. Anyone have any suggestions?"
