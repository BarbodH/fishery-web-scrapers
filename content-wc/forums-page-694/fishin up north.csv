558717,Guest,2006-06-22 10:47:00,0,"just sold my small business and am retiring. have a place near honey harbor and am considering a 5-6 week min. road trip to fish up north. question is-are places to rent a small boat in areas like lake st. joseph,pickle lake,and other lakes in the more remote areas of n.n.w. ontario. i have a good 10 merc and would get a car topper if i had to. my cherokee could get me into most remote areas.i would take a tent and sleep in my jeep if the weather got crappy. the odd night at a resort also. are the lakes in these areas privately controlled or can i fish them without staying at a resort all the time? i hope you are seeing what i am trying to do,but i need some direction. any specific areas that would lend them to my pursuit would be appreciated. any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. thanks!"
558719,phishfearme,2006-06-22 12:02:00,1242,"you need to get hold of lenrays on this board. he's spent weeks doing exactly what you're talking about. see for example:https://walleyecentral.com/dc/dcboard...ng_type=search do more searching on this board (using ""lenrays"") and you'll probably get all the info you need. i'm also sure you can get a good boat and detailed info from pete johnson in pickle. he's been flying and outfitting in pickle for ever. we're flying out of pickle in two weeks to bow lake along the otoswin river - true walleye gold mines. good luck, phish"
558730,IaDave,2006-06-22 16:26:00,476,Phish- I envy you. I'm not heading up this year because of an illness in my immediate family. Please post a report when you get back. I'm curious about the lake Jerel put a boat on. Last year before we left I hid a bottle of Vodka but I can't tell you where it is because I plan on going back next year. Art- If you do head up there stop at Mud Lake which is north of Pickle Lake and say hi to Reverend Marv. He is also retired and he heads up in late April and parks his trailer there for the year. I think he gets a permit thru the township of Pickle Lake. He has been doing this for years and is a true outdoorsman.
558742,phishfearme,2006-06-22 20:38:00,1242,dave - i'll be back on the 17th and will report. sorry to hear you can't make it to canada this year - hopefully next. if that were a bottle of scotch or gin we'd fly in dogs to find it!! - phish
558747,Guest,2006-06-22 21:52:00,0,Thanks for the kind word phishfearme. Was up to Horseshoe Lake in late May. There was a huge temp. difference between Ignace and the Pipestone almost 50 degrees. The fishing was good but have seen better up there but we caught eyes everywhere in the lake. As you know a great year can spoil a fella. Sounds like you have a great trip planned. I answered this newly retired fella on another board where he has asked the same question. If ya go north from Ignace and put into the waters you see 6 weeks will be a lot of fun. Thinking about going back this late summer early fall--found 2 waters off the pipestone where we can get with a small portage with a 14 and small motor. Always looking for new water up there.
558751,phishfearme,2006-06-23 07:17:00,1242,len - i hadn't seen any recent posts by you and thought you may have been missing in action in the bush. i'll do my usual report after i return and hopefully add info on a new lake. - phish
558797,grt1,2006-06-23 18:32:00,259,"gettin back to Art's question and comments. Art, I came from Southern Ontario to the Northwest many years ago, so I can understand your comments on the lakes being privately controlled, they aren't. Up here we have thousands of lakes all have pretty good fishing , some are spectacular others are just so-so. I live near Red Lake, that is 325 miles N.W of Thunder Bay, so it's a fair drive from your area. If you go along # 17 highway up past Long Lac you will find all kinds of lakes and campgrounds that are yours for the taking. Being an Ontario resident allows you to camp on any lake without a permit. so take the trip, stop where you want and put that car topper to use. good luck"
