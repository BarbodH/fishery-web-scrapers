All are US citizens. We'll have two cars, one holding three and the other holding four. The cousins' parents are not coming along. I know everyone will need proof of US citizenship. Any suggestions for ""loading"" the cars to get thru customs, and back, of course?"

For those that do not have passports, be sure to have picture ID and birth certificate with raised seal. Everyone needs to know where they live in US, how long they are going to be in Canada, what the purpose of the visit is, where they are staying in Canada, and whether they are bringing any liquor, tobacco, etc. in. Maintain eye contact with border patrol and when answering their questions. They don't appreciate jokes. Depending on the time you cross, the wait can be extensive - especially on Saturdays after 11:00am due to lots of boat/trailer crossings. There is $10 toll per auto. Enjoy your trip."

Like the SHERRIFF said if they have the proper proof of citizenship and do not nay any DWI's or felonies there should be no problems. TO the point I am thinking you are getting at. From my experience now, have the Oldest adult drive each vehicle and split up each vehicle any way you want with the young adults. Here is the point I tell people who are going across or in life in general. Don't look like a slob!!!!!!! Don't wear a cap, shave, look presentable, and don't act like a jack---. YOu should also know how each person is related to each other or how you know them. Again, from experience, when ever I have crossed with my family (wife, in-laws) and my father-in-law or an uncle was the driver we have never been pulled over (20+ times). And the following car of some cousins (25-35 yo's) who have the I-don't-give-a-rip apperance and preparation have been pulled over a number of times to be searched. Just a thought. Is this what you mean by how to load the vehicles??"

Is this what you mean by how to load the >vehicles?? Thanks for this advice. Have been out of town, so I could not respond sooner. We try to look respectable, but we look like what we look like. One issue with loading the vehicles is whether my wife and I should have the 19 year old in with us, or with his brother and sister in the other car. We are his aunt and uncle, not his parents. I have heard that bringing a minor thru without both parents can be a red flag. I hope we don't need some sort of notarized letter by his parents. Or would it be better to have a 50+ adult driving each car?"
