558423,Rlcrouse,2006-06-13 21:16:00,286,"Ignore #3 completly to start. Your host most likely will put you on fish. I prefer to troll cranks or spoons depending on depth to find active fish. There's my two cents, Good luck"

558436,Guest,2006-06-14 08:57:00,0,"Take note from your outfitter on the depth that active fish have been caught, that is a pattern that will probably be common at many locations on the water. Ask the outfitter about prevailing wind conditions, to see if the wind may have established a pattern on certain shorelines. Use the hot maps to identify potential struture that holds fish. Look for points, reefs, humps, rockpiles, etc. that you can key on for active fish at the depths identified by the outfitter. If prevailing winds may have put the walleye in a feeding pattern, especially look for structure that is exposed to these winds. Use the depth finder to find schools of fish. Look for clouds of minnows and baitfish nearby that they may be feeding on, off of the structure. You'll have better chances of catching more active fish from these schools. Search for them with Linde rigs tipped with minnows, leeches, crawlers or Gulp baits. Once you determine that the fish are definately actively feeding, switch to jigs and work them vertically. Chuck"

I find it helpful to use the Internet to keep track of weather and wind conditions for a week or so before the trip. Conventional wisdom is that the shoreline that has been getting beat up with waves is a good place to start your search for fish. Here is a website I find useful for Canada, maybe there are better ones. For the US, I like weather.com. http://www.theweathernetwork.com/ > >Use the hot maps to identify potential struture that holds >fish.
