558786,Guest,2006-06-23 17:22:00,0,"The duty free shop lets you buy liquor, cigarettes and souvenir junk at a discount because you are taking it out of the country, hence no taxes. In International Falls, there is a large duty free shop just south of Border Bob's place. You make your purchases there. Keep in mind there is still a one bottle limit on booze. Then you head for the border and pay the bridge toll, move forward and have your vehicle videotaped by the border patrol and then there is a little white shack on the right side where you stop and pick up your purchase and leave the country. Don't even think of making a U-turn there. If you are coming back to the US, the duty free shop is just east of the welcome center. You go in and make your purchase, and get a pink slip. You can also get your GST refund there. There you head for the railroad crossing before the corner leading to the railroad bridge taking you to the border. The goods will come in through your passenger window, so have the person with the poink slip riding shotgun. It makes life a little easier."
558788,Guest,2006-06-23 17:46:00,0,ok. i guess. sounds like a complicated mess to save a couple of bucks. i thought you could buy beer on the canadian side at some kind of discount. hardly seems worth it if you are still limited to one case at the border. thanks for info.
