MY question is can you buy more than 1 case or bottle per person at duty free then declare the excess at the border and pay the duty? If yes how much is it etc? We will be crossing at INTL Falls. Normally we bring a bottle or case per person and purchase more after crossing so we have never dealt with paying duty etc. Mwal

I personally have only had to pay duty once, and that was a customs officer that I knew (go figure). It was $2.05 a case back then, quite a few years ago. This spring the cashier at the duty free told me the duty wasn't much, but he didn't say just how much. I brought back 4 bottles of gin - they didn't ask me how much I had at customs, so I skated again. I have had as many as 6 cases and the officer just waved me on through. I figure if they do make me pay duty, I'm money ahead. The price is a lot higher at the beer stores, at least out this way."

I purchased one bottle of vodka at the duty free for about 13.00 and had to pay about 17.00 duty. It would have been just as expensive buying it at the store in Canada. They don't always ask me, but when they do I'm not going to lie. I remember the total cost for the vodka was about $30.00."
