I know you cant bring raw potatoes and I have also heard of venison and other wild game. Is there a website with this information? I was thinking of bringing some fresh veggies and possibly some hamburger. What are the rules on this exactly, just dont want any hangups when we cross the border at 3am. Thanks guys."
