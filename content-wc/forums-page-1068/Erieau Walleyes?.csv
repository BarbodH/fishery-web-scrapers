If you want general info about the area, e-mail me.Here's another website to check once the walleye show up.#####://www.erieaumarina.com/report.htmThey're quick to update it when the fishing is good, but slow to update when the bite turns off. If you see a good report that's more than a few days old, be aware. Anyway, the fact they haven't updated it yet this year makes me think it's still a little early."
