508164,Guest,2000-06-05 21:49:00,0,You can get leeches and minnows at a bait shop just southeast of Kenora about 1 mile. If you are traveling into Kenora from the south it will be on your left side. There is an Esso gas station right next to it. They sell leeches by the pound there though they are pretty small. I don't remember the name of the store.
