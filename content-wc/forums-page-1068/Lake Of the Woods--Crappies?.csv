I'll be leaving the 17th and fishing out of the Morson area. Anybody have any tips on catching some of those slab Crappies that I've been told inhabit this area? A few tips on locations or methods would be appreciated.Thanks, Gary."

Sometimes you can find them, using a depth sounder, suspended over (relatively) deep water. Also, you may pick up a few by fishing the edge of weeds in evening shade. I swear, they are much tougher than walleyes! Also, you might try fishing a small Rapala, or the like, in the middle of an evening/night mayfly hatch,just watch for dimples and approach quietly. Good luck! Bill"
