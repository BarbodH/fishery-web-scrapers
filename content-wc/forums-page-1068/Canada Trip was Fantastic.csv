Were the Walleye in their typical late spring haunts, or is this a year in which they have moved to main lake patterns already. As always any fishing info is always appreciated."

I ran to the west or right out from the lodge and ran about 15 min. fish reefs, structure changes,current breaks & weed lines. I caught fish from 7-20ft of water. Windy points were effective for walleye. we saw some huge musky. You must fish the lake trout. Adam the dock guy is the trout expert. We went out late one evening and bagged 6,,,,,"" I AM HOOKED ON LAKERS "" pictures are in the bar. get your laker guide arranged ahead of time. Food was fantastic."
