508115,WALLEYE EYES,2000-06-05 15:18:00,20,"Our group of 13 people just returned on June 3. Great fishing. We caught close to 2000 fish in a week. 90% were walleyes with the other 10% being northern. The walleyes were caught on jigs, any color, tipped with minnows. The two biggest northern were caught this way too, a 16 and 15 pounder. Not many big walleye were taken, lots of 18 inchers. Not to much luck plugging for northern, but it was starting to pick up towards the end of the week. Good Luck."

508120,Guest,2000-06-07 05:53:00,0,"We stay at five lakes lodge, great camp good equipment. I went last year for first time, we aveaged 50 walleyes/day per person. Many large fish 24-26"". Our equipment was medium action rods with 6lb test, with 3/8 oz jigs. We fished 15-25 ft down on rocks and shoreline. Our best colors were white or green in mornings, black or orange at night. I never fished two island lake, but gullrock and Keg were great. On Keg all we caught were 24"" fish. Do you have experience fishing two island and any pointers?ThanksJeff"
