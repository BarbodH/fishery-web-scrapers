508131,Guest,2000-06-05 02:45:00,0,I am looking to start an annual fishing trip with my son to southern Canada. Can someone tell me the best area or lake where we would have a good chance to catch slab crappies and some walleyes.Thanks....AJ
508132,Guest,2000-06-05 07:45:00,0,Not sure about the crappies but if you want walleyes goto to Quetico (if southern ontario is your decision).
508133,kingsway,2000-06-05 10:19:00,27,"Anyone wanting a great fishing experience at a very reasonable cost. Try ""The Idyllwild Resort"" on Kashabowie Lake, Ontario. Located just 65 mi W/NW of Thunder Bay, Ontario (off Hy.11). The lake is 14 mi. long has many islands, bay, and channels. The fishing there is great for Walleye, Lake Trout, Small mouth Bass, and Northern Pike. Rates for a (fully modern) 3-bedroom cabin for up to 6 persons are $450.00 per week Canadian dollars (which translates to about $320.00 American dollars total). Not per person as many places charge and then they charge American Dollars beside. For a rustic, 1 bedroom cabin that sleeps 4, the weekly rate is only $250.00 (about $180.00 American Dollars). You can bring your own boat or rent theirs. Call and talk to Sue at 1-807-926-2413 or e-mail Sue at [email protected] . I have done fly-in fishing, fished Red Lake, Ear Falls, Parroult falls, Vermillion Bay, and I would say that this place provides more bang for the American Dollar than any of the others I have tried so far. I do not have any financial interest in this lodge or any other benefit from telling about this place. I just wanted to share an excellent Canadian fishing trip that the average American can afford, with fellow fishermen Hope you enjoy your stay as well as me and my wife will June 17-23.Rich"
508134,ken,2000-06-07 09:03:00,30,One of the best lakes is about 1 1/2 hours from toronto. The nane is Rice lake. the crappies have now gone to deep water but the walleye fishing is great. The best area is around sugar island and we catch our limit every day . call the ontario mnr for more information on details for more information
508135,Guest,2000-06-07 09:25:00,0,"I've heard there are ""crappie"" in this lake, but I've never seen them. Try Pigeon or Buckhorn Lake just about 2 hrs. north east of Toronto. They are part of the Kawartha Lakes system (so is Rice Lake), easy to get to and offer decent walleye fishing, fair muskie and smallmouth bass fishing, and all-you-can-take pan fishing (Rock Bass, huge Blue Gill, nice Perch). I've been going to Pigeon for over 25 years on and off. It's very beautiful and a good place to start an annual father / son trip. My father and I began there when I was 10, last year I turned 35 and we boated fair numbers and a couple decent size walleye on Pigeon. 4 lb. was the largest. Good luck."
508136,Rick,2000-06-07 15:07:00,226,"I agree with ""T"" that Pigeon Lake is a great place to fish. I went last year and caught walleye, largemouth (my personal best) and some giant pumpkinseeds for the frying pan. You can even try for musky if you have heavier equipment."
