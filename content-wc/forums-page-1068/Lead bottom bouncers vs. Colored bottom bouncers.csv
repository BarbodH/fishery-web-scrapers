The water color there if you didn't know was a tea color/moderately stained. Would I have had more success with the colored do you think? Also, we caught a lot of walleyes in less than 17 feet of water. Is it possible that we could have gotten bigger fish than 22"" in deeper water because we got a lot of slot sized fish. Could anybody help me out on this? Thanks."

Most of the lakes I fish are stained. I tend to use a little larger beads and blades than some for the added attraction though.As for Lac Seul, I've fished it quite often and most of the bigger fish I've taken there have been in less than 20 ft. That's not to say that you won't find them deeper. I like to fish structure that is close to deep water, my theory being that they'll come up to the shallower water to feed and are thus more agressive. If they're not actively feeding, they'll just lay back in deeper water. Again, this is simply a personal opinion and is based on nothing more than my own experience."
