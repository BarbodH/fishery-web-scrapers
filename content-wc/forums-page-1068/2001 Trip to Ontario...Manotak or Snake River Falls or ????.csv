507919,Guest,2000-06-08 03:24:00,0,When you go to a drive in lodge the chances of getting great fishing is not good. Once you go to a good fly-in place you'll never go back.

507920,Fred_G,2000-06-08 08:38:00,908,"I have been going to the Old POst & Village on Lake St. Joseph in NW Ontario for the last 4 years. This is a drive to lake and the fishing is excellent. There are only 2 lodges and one fly in on the lake, which is 92 miles long and app. 180,000 acres. They only issue 1500 tags for the lake each year. It's more expensive but I think it's worth every penny. Fred"
507908,Moose_MI,2000-05-17 08:52:00,31,"Hi to all who love the great North... Planning a trip for 12+ to Ontario. Snake River Falls and Manotak Lodge seem to be leading the selection list. Looking for standard stuff...Walleye, Smallies, Northern. Trying to keep the trip budget to < $600 start to finish. Willing to cook our own food, don't need guides do need boats. Trip planned for mid-June of 2001.Went to KCR Camp (Kenora/Minaki) in 1999...great camp and nice people...and great food...Walleye Fishing was VERY VERY SLOW when we were there...couldn't catch them even when we were with the guides. Got zero rain while we were there and it was 90 degrees everyday (we were there 4th of July). Other than that it was great...just slow Walleye bite...OK smallies and great Pike action...So if anyone has some info on Snake River Falls or Manotak or general comments...I'd sure appreciate it....Good Fishing to ya!!!"
507909,Guest,2000-05-17 14:22:00,0,"Howdy,I was up at Manotak Lodge at the beginning of last September.Biggest problem we had was the weather! It had been raining for 2 weeks straight before we got there and was raining for the first few days we were there. I was with a larger group and a lot of the guys stayed in the cabin due to the weather. My buddy and I braved it and managed to catch a few but it was pretty tough going, even for the pike. I have to say though that the lodge owner and folks there were really great and fun to be around! I thought the cabin was great. Plenty of room for a bunch of people and it was clean and had a nice deck and all of that. We brough our own food and so I can't comment on how their food would be other than I saw them coking up a couple of meals that looked pretty good on the grill. They also provided us with a really good Fish fry for lunch friday.So, I guess I give it a mixed review. Good accomidations, good people, but the fishing was slow for us. Still, You can't fight that weather!PS. Rej is a hoot especially after a couple of beers and a few rounds of ""Your cheatin heart"" on the guitar!"
507910,Moose,2000-05-18 12:56:00,248,"Thanks a bunch for the info. You have my sympathies for the bad weather, but like you said it happens.Did they offer any special ""deal"" given the size of your large group?Did you try a day trip Fly In??Thanks again, Moose"
507911,Guest,2000-05-18 16:19:00,0,"Hi Moose,I can't tell you what the deal even was to be honest with you. I tag along with a group that has been going up to Canada for 20 some years and they let one guy find the place and handle the money, food and pretty much everything else. He ends up finding a good deal and nice places every year and they rest of the guys trust him and so do I.No, I haven't tried a fly-in at all since the time I was a little kid and my grandfather would take me out with the company float plane. Didn't know how good I had it then!"
507913,Guest,2000-05-20 13:41:00,0,"Anyone wanting a great fishing experience at a very reasonable cost. Try ""The Idyllwild Resort"" on Kashabowie Lake, Ontario. Located just 65 mi W/NW of Thunder Bay, Ontario (off Hy.11). The lake is 14 mi. long has many islands, bay, and channels. The fishing there is great for Walleye, Lake Trout, Small mouth Bass, and Northern Pike. Rates for a (fully modern) 3-bedroom cabin for up to 6 persons are $450.00 per week Canadian dollars (which translates to about $320.00 American dollars total). Not per person as many places charge and then they charge American Dollars beside. For a rustic, 1 bedroom cabin that sleeps 4, the weekly rate is only $250.00 (about $180.00 American Dollars). You can bring your own boat or rent theirs. Call and talk to Sue at 1-807-926-2413 or e-mail Sue at [email protected] . I have done fly-in fishing, fished Red Lake, Ear Falls, Parroult falls, Vermillion Bay, and I would say that this place provides more bang for the American Dollar than any of the others I have tried so far. I do not have any financial interest in this lodge or any other benefit from telling about this place. I just wanted to share an excellent Canadian fishing trip that the average American can afford, with fellow fishermen Hope you enjoy your stay as well as me and my wife will June 17-23.Rich"
507914,Moose,2000-05-22 11:46:00,248,"Rich, Thanks for the info...man that is cheap!. I couldn't find a web sight...do you know of one? How many lodges are on the lake? How many folks does the lodge accomodate? Do the cabins have toilets, shower, H+C running water, electric,etc... Just a little suspicious about that rate...ya know? That really sounds like a great deal. I'd like to hear more. I've EMAIL'ed for a brochure...thanks for the tip.Moose"
507912,Guest,2000-05-22 13:04:00,0,"Moose,Remember on thing about going to canada. You get what you pay for. I have been to many drive inn places like this and found that the fishing was so,so, until I did the daily fly outs( then the fishing was great). After totaling the ""extras"" with the base cost like fly outs I found it cheaper to go to a fly out place and have great fishing everyday outside my doorstep. Be careful and good luck."
507915,Guest,2000-05-22 13:24:00,0,"Moose,I agree with honker. Look at the post titled water falls lodge/ spanish ontario. Been to many places like that where its drive in access everyone and their granmother have been going there for years and taking the fish out. If you find a cheap place investigate the catch and release policy throughly. Many camps claim catch release because it looks good on a brochure but when you get there they could care less. Plus, the locals have been pounding many of these drive ins for years and even though they are catching and releasing it will take some time for the fishing to get good again. I also have spent more money at drive ins than fly ins because I wound up do doing daily fly outs 2 and 3 times at $100 per man per day. Do your research on what the ""real costs"" would be. Good Luck."

507918,kingsway,2000-06-07 18:58:00,27,"Hi Moose, Sorry about the late reply but I didn't see your post til now. There are 2 Three bedroom cabins that have H&C water, toilet & shower, elec, & gas grills and 2 cabins that are primitive. The e-mail is [email protected] & the phone is 1-807-926-2413 The rates are very reasonable but they are a great value and the people are very nice and helpful. The fishing is also very good. Not all drive to lakes are fished hard. I believe there is one other lodge on this body of water. I hope this helps. Rich"
