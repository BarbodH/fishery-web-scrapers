6635166,RichA$1970,2022-02-21 07:59:00,1159,The fishing is so good up in NW Ontario why even need live bait.
6635174,Obabikon,2022-02-21 08:15:00,2370,"I certainly get why there's some frustration with this, but from a resort owner's POV, I could not care less. It's almost like complaining about the color of your lifejacket when you're being thrown overboard. I'm just so happy we're going to be open, and things are at least getting a little easier at the border... As far as this topic goes, there's a real possibility that live (or real) bait will never again be allowed to cross. I don't know that, and I really have no insight on the MNR's decisions. I just know that it will help prevent invasive species, make it easier on border guards, and increase revenue for local bait dealers. I'm not saying I agree with it... I am just saying that there are a lot of influences to a decision like this. Most important thing... we're going to get a full year of fishing in!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
6635248,prov1800,2022-02-21 12:49:00,5010,The full year sounds great
6635254,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2022-02-21 13:01:00,629,"For the yrs prior to Covid, as a South Shore LOTW seasonal resident, it was my understanding that the ""Crawlers"" that were sold on the US side, came from Canada. The only stipulation was that the ""Crawlers"" that were brought across the border were to be in ""Worm-Bedding"". If this was true, it would seem to me that the Canadian ""Crawler"" suppliers are being hurt. I lived with artificial plugs & plastics last season when X'ing the border by water & can certainly do it again! It just seems odd for a territory that relies on the fishing tourism industry. Just let me cross!! Set the Hook, CRJohn"
6635262,Obabikon,2022-02-21 13:30:00,2370,"I get that... but if you bring a bottle of Crown to Canada, you still have to pay duty on it. I don't know the answer, but this isn't a fight that is worth it for most people. I am sure someone did the pros/cons and figured out that it is more beneficial for tourists to purchase bait in Canada..."
6635270,BuckeyeATC,2022-02-21 14:03:00,88,"I can understand stand not allowing minnow, leeches, crayfish and other bait that is in or has been in water across the border. But not allowing worms packed in paper bedding across doesn't make sense. Virtually all North American earthworms are non-native (https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasive...rms/index.html). Buying a flat at home (Ohio) I can save about $20 and I don't have to make an extra stop in the Soo and or wait for the bait store to open. Just my 2cents...."
6635280,JAY221,2022-02-21 15:18:00,877,"If I am reading this right it is the Canadian border patrol not the MNR that is stating this just like it was last year,right?"
6635374,walleyecheek,2022-02-22 05:46:00,2231,I know a bait shop owner in canada that gets his crawlers from the US..............So ? What's going on here ? Remember the potato ban ? Go into Safeway and take a look where those Canadian potatoes come from ! It should be a choice where folks want to get their crawlers like it has been for years !
6635380,Obabikon,2022-02-22 06:24:00,2370,Correct. But... everyone understands the border is dealing with tons of changes. Handling bait imports is just one less thing. I'm not saying that's the reason. I'm simply saying there are a lot of reasons.
6635394,Pooch,2022-02-22 07:07:00,4618,I think that some of the irritation on the part of people gong to Canada to fish and having to buy bait in Canada is the fact that many cross the border late in the evening or during the night and groceries and everything else is closed.Depending on where we cross the border and time of day determines whether we stop to finish our groceries in Canada or buy them south of the border before crossing. Having our bait already packed and in coolers before leaving home was a great convenience. Though not a deal breaker in any way. Cost difference was negligible on either side. I also think the grocery stores in Canada are better in many ways than here in the USA.Pooch
6635074,Guest,2022-02-20 15:41:00,0,"Looks like bait will need to be purchased in Canada this summer. including frozen. I got this cut and paste from my outfitter A Notice from CBSA on Bait NOTO has been notified by CBSA that they will not allow any bait (worms, minnows-live or dead, and obviously no leeches) into Canada like last year. Currently, the only people permitted to import any of these would be commercial bait dealers who may be able to satisfy the CFIA or MNRF in order to import them legally. Please share this information with your guests to ensure they are prepared"
6635076,Walleye2242,2022-02-20 15:53:00,263,Sweet. No worries. I buy all bait in Canada anyway. Easier for me as well.
6635086,prov1800,2022-02-20 17:21:00,5010,That's what I like here.
6635092,RichA$1970,2022-02-20 17:54:00,1159,Fine with me as I don’t mind stopping at the bait shop as it’s a good break.
6635100,Andre (wallyandre),2022-02-20 18:27:00,2274,I cross the border for over 20 years now from Canada to the US to fish on Lake Champlain and it's like that since the beginning: no live bait from Canada to the US and I don't mind because I don't use live bait.
6635116,Baseline,2022-02-20 21:07:00,3207,They had the same regulation in place last fall after the border opened. Wasn't a problem for me and my friends. Called ahead and ordered crawlers. They were ready to go when we arrived.
6635134,Bstar,2022-02-21 05:10:00,564,We've been buying our bait in Canada for the last several years. Less hassle then bringing it from home and we don't mind supporting the local economy.
6635154,eyecatcher1,2022-02-21 06:58:00,323,I've bee n going to Canada for 30 years and always buy my bait there.
6635156,That Minnesota guy,2022-02-21 07:05:00,8293,Why would a Canadian Walleye want to eat an American leech? It makes no sense.
6635160,eyecatcher1,2022-02-21 07:20:00,323,They'll eat Cheetos. Aren't they American made? LOL!
