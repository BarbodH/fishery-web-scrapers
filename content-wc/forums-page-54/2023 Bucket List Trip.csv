6635966,isumoose,2022-02-24 19:10:00,14,"Like Brett, we've been to Misekumaw and were at Cree last September. We're going back to Cree again this September for the lake trout orgy. Nothing to add to Brett's tackle summary, it's right on. Trout should be holed up and since you'll have good electronics jigging would be my goto attack.Some other advice fwiw.1. If you fly Delta to Canada, compare the same on Westjet. It's the same flights but prices can vary widely.2. Do not pack anything but rods in a commercially checked rod caddy. A handful of Husky Devles landed one of our caddies in quarantine and us in the Fort McMurray Walmart looking for replacements.3. Last year I decided to leave my ultra-light home and instead used a St. Croix 6'3"" ML/EF spinning rod for both walleye and grayling. Worked fine but the walleye were not cooperative.Looking forward to your post trip report. I've exchanged some emails with Ryan myself and Marshland is definitely on our radar.Craig"

However, I will point out that there are much more economical packing cubes to use; you can grab a six pack on Amazon for about $20. We've started bringing less clothing and a little bit of laundry soap and just doing a mid trip wash of critical clothes. We used to use oxy clean, and have switched to an eco friendly soap. 10 minutes of hand washing saves a good amount of weight and packing volume."
6637172,Eckohlt,2022-03-01 15:53:00,3685,Just bring plenty disposable undies then you don't have to wash anything.
6637174,NM_Trout,2022-03-01 15:55:00,1094,"Hmmm I guess it ""depends"" on how long we are staying :-)"
6637178,Eckohlt,2022-03-01 16:05:00,3685,Great reply lol
6638006,Bstar,2022-03-06 07:27:00,564,"Thanks for all of the good ideas. I started using the packing cubes a few years ago and got the cheap ones on amazon. They work great with keeping everything organized. Marshland does have laundry facilities available, so we'll be able to cut down on clothing."
6635028,Bstar,2022-02-20 10:02:00,564,"He's going to provide a pike rod, walleye rod and a grayling rod. Both bait caster and spinning. I assume an ultralight setup for grayling."
6635038,bthomas3333,2022-02-20 12:00:00,465,"Hi Brian, I normally go all spinning because I am pike first guy and the ability to get max cast distance/water coverage is better in my opinion with spinning. The rods and reels aren't a weight problem by themselves. Heck most good rods weight a few oz. The reels are also less than a pound. For a trip with Grayling / Pike / walleye / Trout. You need to compromise somewhere. Last time I had a four species trip like this I went with: 6 1/2 ft Premier UL (2 pieces) / 2500 series reel 7 ft MHF 4000 series reel (2 pc) 7/ft HF 5000 series reel (2 pc) Then I use the UL for Grayling which are a blast. I'm sort of bummed I won't catch one until 2023. The MHF is a compromise for walleyes vs my pref which with be MXF but the fly-in usually brings such good fishing it doesnt matter much vs higher pressured lakes. In terms of the trout the spinning isn't best for trolling deep for trout. (twist issues) If you can mange a 4th rod I would add a HF casting rod and reel. (I know you are getting rods and reels from Ryan. So you save the hassle I go through and the weight. I hugely prefer one piece rods but I finally gave up and went to 2 pc for remote fly-ins. I can keep them safe in lighter weight cases. If I drive to the fly out I go with 1pc but I am most often flying to Calgary then NWT or Fort Mac or connecting to Sask then I do 2 pc. Weight wise (esp with Laundry) I target 20-23lbs for my waterproof duffle with my reels I target 17-20lbs for tackle 5 lbs for rods 5-10lbs for my backpack Like I said I am usually closer to 60lbs. I'll probably get a nasty email or two by saying this but look at Simms packing cubes. Yes they cost 60 bucks for 3 but they weight nothing and help keep the packing organized which helps with weight. At least for me. I am terrible I pack and then start throwing in stuff and pretty soon the duffle is 75lbs. Simms Packing Cubes: The large cube holds 2 pairs of jeans The medium holds 2 t-shirts and 2 long sleeve base layer shirts (bug proof / spf 50) The small holds 4 underwear and 2 waterproof socks That leaves my duffle with Extra shoes / boots (water proof socks remove the boots for me) / Rain gear / hoodie / outter jacket / personal medical stuff / reels (or in backpack if you are willing to leave line off) Tackle box stuff was listed above the key there is to not bring 25 spoons in different colors keep it to 10-12. That sort of thing. Backpack has my travel stuff. Change of closes / iPad / go pro / phone / chargers I don't know, maybe this helps or maybe not but just how I do it. Brett"
6635040,Eckohlt,2022-02-20 12:01:00,3685,"Sounds good,we all will be waiting for report on that trip when your back."
6635132,Bstar,2022-02-21 05:06:00,564,"Brett, This helps immensely. Thank you!"
6635158,bthomas3333,2022-02-21 07:16:00,465,You are welcome. Can't wait to read the trip report! It would be even better to share info on Ryan's dock. Brett
6635530,proguidedream,2022-02-22 14:55:00,345,"50 pounds is lots , especially if hot summer days and light clothes. we go on a DIY trip that is 50 pounds and that includes our fish finders/ rods/ tackle/ and hard liqour.. it ussualy depends a lot on how heavy your actual crew is also ! remember 6 180-200 pound guys wiegh A LOT less then 6 225-275 pound guys.... i would pack what you need and can always take some out. we have had some big boys on our trip and have had to empty some jigs out. but we have also had lighter guys and been able to pack much more. realistcly you wont use 1/2 the tackle you bring , because if the fish are snapping like they normally are up north youll be spending to much time catching then messing with tackle."
6635700,lassh,2022-02-23 12:32:00,553,"Brett, what is the basis for ""reels (or in backpack if you are willing to leave line off)"" ? Thanks for sharing. Quite helpful."
6635708,bthomas3333,2022-02-23 12:56:00,465,"I've heard stories of TSA agents saying the line on the reels could be used as a weapon and they forced the reels to be checked after being denied at the TSA checkpoint. Big PITA to go back and watch your reels be put in plastic bags and disappear down the tunnel since your other bags are already gone.So...1. Carry-on reels with line and be ready to check them if you get an (""I'll go with ""annoying"") TSA agent2. Carry on reels but leave the line spools in checked bag. No TSA issue but if your bag is lost you cant use the reels but the expense is minimum to rebuy spools.3. Check the reels and line and just cross your fingers they don't disappear.I use nicer mid-price point reels so it wouldn't be terrible if they were gone...Just an annoyance for my trip. Some guys I fish with use Stellas. 2 per guy and they never check them...Brett"
6635714,jambi,2022-02-23 14:15:00,504,Interesting. I'll carry on the reels w/ spools and check the line. Can spool up the night before the trip. Thanks for the tips.
6635720,bthomas3333,2022-02-23 14:44:00,465,Far and away the best option. I tend to be in a frenzy to hit the lake/river.Carrying on the reels and checking the line prevents the whole TSA discussion. Plus if you arrive somewhere without your bag buying line is WAY easier than looking for a new spool or reel.Brett
6634830,Bstar,2022-02-19 07:01:00,564,"I just booked a trip for our group of four at Marshland Outfitters' new Burnett Lake outpost for the 2nd week in August of next year. We have been talking about doing a trip to northern Manitoba or Saskatchewan for a while now and we're finally going to do it! It took us awhile to decide on where we wanted to go. We had it narrowed down to Milton Lake Lodge's Misekumaw Lake Outpost and Gangler's Stevens-Nicklin Outpost when I reached out to Mike Borger for his input on camps. He said both of those camps are great, but it would be worth taking a look at Marshland's new camp. It's a unique camp with two sleeping cabins with two bedrooms each that sleep one guy per bedroom. There is an option for an additional bed in the event there is a group of six. There is a cook cabin and food is provided at an extra cost for the HK plan. It is included in the guided plan. The lakes haven't been fished in several years and Ryan is limiting the camp to a max of 45 anglers/year. He has 16' Alumarine boats with 25 hp electric start Yamahas and HB Helix 7's w/GPS. He also provides a Garmin InReach. He said he is having Starlink installed this year so there will be text and email capability at the camp. The four grand slam species are available. None of us have caught a Grayling before so we're hoping to cross that off of our list as well as get into some Lake Trout but the Pike and Walleye will be our main targets. We'll take any suggestions on tackle for a trip like this. We are limited to 50 lbs so that will be a challenge, but we decided to rent rod/reels from Ryan, so we don't have to deal with rod cases through the airports. Speaking of airports, it doesn't look like there's any easy way to fly to Saskatoon from Chicago. Most flights go to Toronto and then Saskatoon. We're excited about this trip and it's a year and a half away! But we have a Lake Erie trip in June and a trip to Miniss in August of this year to keep us occupied until then."
6634834,That Minnesota guy,2022-02-19 07:07:00,8293,Sounds like a great adventure. Always nice to have something to look forward to and plan for.
6634842,Eckohlt,2022-02-19 07:22:00,3685,Wonder why only 50 pounds?your paying big money you should at least be allowed 100 pounds I would think.
6634848,Larry S,2022-02-19 08:01:00,665,"Bstar First have a Great trip. I went in 1989 to Misaw Lake Lodge in Northeast Saskatchewan with my fishing buddy .The camp was small only 6 other fishermen when we were there. We went in late June and had a Great time. Caught 3 types of fish, no walleye this far north. I caught at least 30 grayling from the Schwandt river. This trip was guided by natives which was OK, I personally would rather do my own guiding, but ,Misaw is so large that it is not an option. We also caught numerous Lake trout in the 20 lb range and Many pike over 40 inches. From what you have said the camp you are going to sounds very upscale as compared to Misaw ,at this time. I know that Misaw has been redone completely by the new owner and it is a lot nicer now We flew to Saskatoon, via Winnipeg from Chicago when we went in 1989. We used Five of Diamonds Daredeveles, Williams Wobblers and and my personal favorite Very Large Flatfish for the Lake trout. If the Trout are concentrated Large Jigs with assorted types of tails will work. Enjoy your trip with your friends. Catch lots of fish and be Grateful you can go on this Type of Trip Take Care Larry Schroeder"
6634932,bthomas3333,2022-02-19 19:57:00,465,Bstar - Great trip. I've been talking to them too. LOOKS AWESOME! 22 is full for me but I am booked at Misekumaw & Cree for 23 and have one open trip slot.Seriously thinking about going to Marshland unguided too in 23. I'm done with guides so I would take one of the weeks where he is fishing unguided. Same camp/gear/water just less $.For gear:One box of spoons with a mix of Dare Devyle/Johnson/Doctor/Krocodile in 3/4oz to 1oz Maybe a Husky or two for TroutOne box of spinners with Blue Fox / Mepps / Grinders spinner baitsOne misc BoxLarge leadheads for pike I like HeadLockZ 1/4-1/2oz Spin flies from mepps in 0 or 00 for graylingWeights to get deep for troutMed Jigheads for walleyes 1/8-3/8Plasticsbag of 100 6in Twister for trailersmisc 3-4in tails for walleyesChunky grubs for pike jigs (Berk Saltwater grubs)One box of misc cranksLove the 4play from Savage gearRaps for walleyes / pikeSome larger tubes for troutOn the gear side. I've been working hard to reduce the weight of the carrying devices. I love my plano rod case that carries up to 9 rods but empty it weighs 5-6lbs. The bass pro XL water proof bag weights 6lbs. My Grunden waterproof bag weights like 2lbs. I carry my rods in different smaller cases that weight 2-3lbs. My tackle is stored in a shell that doesn't weigh anything and I minimize the plastic boxes. All told 50lbs is really crazy. I shoot for 50 and usually come in closer to 60.At least this is where I would start.Brett
6634940,RichA$1970,2022-02-19 21:58:00,1159,"Sounds like a great trip. Have fun on the 50# limit, I guess you’ll be wearing 3 layers of clothes when you board the last flight with boots and heavy jacket on to save on the weight."
6634964,Bstar,2022-02-20 06:41:00,564,"I agree, Ganglers allows 60 lbs and Milton Lake lodge allows 50 lbs. It may be due to the logistics of flying goods into these remote camps. I'm guessing the costs are higher there than in NW Ontario where we normally go. We don't have to deal with bringing in food and he will fly in our alcohol beforehand. A laundry is available so we can keep clothing down to a minimum."
6634966,Bstar,2022-02-20 06:50:00,564,"Larry, Thanks for the info! You can check them out at marshlandfishing.com"
6634974,Bstar,2022-02-20 07:04:00,564,"Brett, Thanks for the info. We are doing the self-guided trip. Wow that sounds like a lot of gear that you take, and you still manage to stay under 60 lbs? As I said in my OP, we are going to rent rods/reels from Ryan but just wondering what type of rods that you take? Most of our rods are one piece 6 1/2 - 7'. Brian"
6634988,Eckohlt,2022-02-20 07:47:00,3685,"Your certainly not going to use those long rods for grayling,does he have shorter ultra light poles for you?"
