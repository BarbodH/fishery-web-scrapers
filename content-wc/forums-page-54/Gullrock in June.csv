This year I am lucky and have free time in June. Checked with all Gullrock lodges and one lodge has a week open early June. I was surprised that there was an opening, and the lodge owner told me that he was just told by a longtime guest that he would not get his vaccination so he cannot cross. In years past I was always looking in the 17-21 ft range for walleye. Drifting the boot, Burnt, Fisherman's point, Gull Rock and other points with a big jig and leach or bouncing Klass spinner with a minnow. In the second week of June, how shallow will I be fishing. Do leaches work that early in the year? Do I work the same points, just shallower? Anyone want to tell me their honey hole? My go to spot in July to catch a lot of walleye (but nothing big) was southeast portion of the south island in Two Island lake, or this spot , off the visible rock sticking up, which holds a stupid number of fish ( 50.92567° N, 93.60005° W )."
6638540,maddogg,2022-03-08 15:14:00,178,Hopefully I'll be at Gullrock in July.First time for us. Just hope the Covid tests get lifted. Sounds like they will accept the IDNOW test. The PCR test is kind if iffy if your traveling a long way.

In Sept Leeches were better, but still minnows rule.Depth, start at 18-22ft and go from there.My Honey Hole, No, but thanks for asking. &#x1f642;"

Loved the fishing in June and thought Aug was equally good.A lot of different spots that hold fish. One year was a warmer year and they had started to migrate to the mid lake humps. The other year it was a cooler year and caught the shallower on the points.Great lake system to fish as it has a lot of options. Fish Gullrock, Keg and Twin Island in the spring. All 3 fish a little different so get good variety.Pike fishing is a blast too. Plenty in the mid 30's and each trip we have had at least one top 40.If you are looking for a lodge I recommend 5 Lakes Lodge. Ian will take care of you. Marks up a map on day one showing you spots to start. He will assist with any adjustments throughout the week based on others.Good luck."

Specifically the north point, NW corner of I believe the east island and if you get a brisk wind out of the west the east shoreline just outside the bull rushes was good.On Gullrock Stevenson point, tip of the boot and the points north of the boot were very productive. On the cooler years the mouth of the channel to Keg was good.As the water warms the sunken islands in Gull rock north of the clay banks was good.As far as depth they were as shallow as 12 foot down to the low 20's. At times would find smaller fish at one depth and either move slightly shallower or deeper and size would change.Good luck."
