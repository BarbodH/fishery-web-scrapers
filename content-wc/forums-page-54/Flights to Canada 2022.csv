6638118,LoDo,2022-03-06 14:45:00,721,"Pre Covid round trip flights from Denver to Winnipeg were available and cheap. Today, we don't even have options. We'll be flying to MSP and renting a car. We've done MSP plenty, just been spoiled with the Denver to Winnipeg direct the past decade. The drive from MSP to Red Lake isn't terrible as we do several stops and we're full of excitement. The drive home on the other hand sucks. Winnipeg allowed same day arrival and departure with no hotels. Oh well, just happy to get across the border again this year."
6638284,NM_Trout,2022-03-07 10:53:00,1094,"Cheapest car available in INL for a week of fishing plus 2 days is about $1100. (mid June timeframe) We were going to fly into Winnipeg, but the idea of covid testing to get on a plane for the US spooked me. We are ending up flying into North Dakota and picking up an additional 2 hour drive. Consider your car rental when booking your flights."
6638296,Mojo-NC,2022-03-07 11:49:00,1929,"We've flown/driven to our Ear Falls destination via MSP, Duluth, INL, and Winnipeg. We've decided that we won't ever fly to MSP again because of the additional 5+ hours of required driving. Maybe we try to do too much on Day 1 and on our go home day, but that additional 5 hours of driving to and from MSP can really be brutal. On Day 1, we typically leave home early in the morning and fly to our destination airport, then get groceries and supplies for the week, cross the border, then finish the drive to Dryden where we spend the night. We drive from Dryden to Ear Falls the following morning and check-in to our lodge at 9:00 AM. So from MSP, that means about 8-9 hours of driving after flying, not including stops for supplies and border crossing delays. On the way back it's even worse because we drive all the way from Ear Falls to MSP and then fly home. We're all exhausted and moody on the last day of the trip and that is not a good way to end a wonderful week in God's Country. When we fly to either INL or Winnipeg, it only adds a total of about 3 hours of driving from either location on Day 1. On the way home it is about 5 hours total to either airport from Ear Falls, in addition to our flying, which is still tough but much more tolerable. At Winnipeg we go through customs at the airport instead of driving across the border, but otherwise both are very similar drive times."

We do that drive from Sioux Lookout back to the Cities on return from Lac Seul... its a good 10 Hour drive..... AND everyone is tired... Then, I fly back into DIA early Sun morning.... I live an hour from DIA... Perhaps it will change soon..."
6638380,LoDo,2022-03-07 20:56:00,721,Ugh.... I shouldve dug a bit more. United completely dropped the Denver to Winnipeg flight. Perhaps another airline picks this up in the coming months or next year. https://canadianaviationnews.wordpre...nipeg-service/
6638426,proguidedream,2022-03-08 07:42:00,345,theres denver to grandforks 433 round trip for. 1 layover in MN. saves you an hour half and almost 5 hours in a car. from driving from MN. especially if get stuck in traffic.
6639232,Cgillespie,2022-03-10 13:41:00,120,"Flying out of Memphis to Minneapolis, then another flight to Winnipeg. Renting a car and driving to Red Lake. We booked a rental car months ago, before prices spiked. It's a 24 + hour drive from North Arkansas. Flying Delta is a better option."
6639258,Old Timer,2022-03-10 15:33:00,255,"For many, many years I used to drive or fly to the most remote places I could find in Ontario and parts further north. About 20 years ago I changed my program and now fish no further than two hours from International Falls. Some places are only an hour. if you snoop around you'd be surprised at the quality of fishing that is nearby. There are taxi services that will pick you up at the airport and take you to your destination across the border. Of course, the trick is finding the place. Sure, it won't work for folks who own their own cabin. But for others like me it's a real time saver with plenty of fish."
6639262,Eckohlt,2022-03-10 15:40:00,3685,"Tell people where these places are that are close International falls,then there won't be any tricks to find them,I myself like to go as deep in the jungle as I can."
6637922,LoDo,2022-03-05 15:44:00,721,"Ive read several posts on 2022 Countdown to walleye season and Bucket List fishing trips. Do most of you drive or fly to your destination? Do you fly to MSP then drive up through Int Falls? I ask because we used to be able to fly direct to Winnipeg from a handful of US cities and now everyone has to go through MSP to get to Winnipeg. The flight options aren't ideal. I know this is due to Covid and I'm sure Canada airports will begin to open internationally, but I haven't seen it yet. Any inside knowledge on International flights to Winnipeg specifically would be much appreciated. 90 days and counting!!"
6637924,7 Mag,2022-03-05 15:51:00,1887,"I drive itâ€™s approx 12 hours to IF, if I lived a long ways away I would fly."
6637938,bthomas3333,2022-03-05 16:58:00,465,Not sure where you are trying to get to? I am looking at flights right now for Fort Mac and YellowKnife. Both route through Calgary but I can get to Calgary through LAX/Seattle/Las Vegas/Denver/ and Minneapolis. No there aren't as many connections as there used to be but it isn't terrible. Prices...ugh.Are you looking at WestJet in additional to Delta?Brett
6637970,LoDo,2022-03-05 19:23:00,721,Im in Denver and we used to have 2-3 direct flight options to Winnipeg x daily. Those days are done. MSP is the only US city that flies to Winnipeg. Currently no other US cities flying to Winnipeg. Hoping this changes in coming months.
6637976,Camoclad,2022-03-05 21:48:00,628,"We fly from Atlanta to Minneapolis, then Minneapolis to IFalls. From there we get North Air Taxi to take us to the outfitter. Same process in reverse on the way back. We spend the night in IFalls coming and going since it is a pretty good haul, even flying, for some of the fellas in our group.

6638002,Bstar,2022-03-06 07:15:00,564,I was looking at what flights are available to get from Chicago-Saskatoon for our trip next year just to get an idea of routes and pricing. Right now it looks like Chicago-Toronto-Saskatoon will be the shortest and least expensive option at $512 RT. I suspect the cost will be higher next year if the price of oil continues to climb.
6638014,Eckohlt,2022-03-06 07:41:00,3685,Probably triple the price next year I would guess.
6638018,kettyspanky,2022-03-06 07:49:00,271,We are lucky enough to be able to drive to our fishing rersort. We go up by Thunderbay. It's about a 10 hr drive. It will be interesting this year with gas prices. Ouch.
6638080,jimirjr,2022-03-06 10:03:00,1149,"My Group used to do houseboat trips out of Sioux Narrows on LOW. We would fly into MSP and rent a mini van (only had 4 Guys ) to S.N..... At that time we were only a group of 4. We also drove from Denver to S.N. quite a few times... Long trip both ways with 2 motel stays each way. Usually rented a mini van for those trips... Those vans usually ran about $650 for 12 days RT. Always rented from COSTCO... You could rent a mini van out of MSP for less than $550 for 10 days back then... Very handy. We have recently switched to fishing Lac Seul out of Sioux Lookout. Only 2 of Us from the original Denver group left, so... We fly into MSP on Southwest (NO baggage fees on SW !) and utilize My Cousins and his Buds pickups for the drive from MSP to S.L. We are now a party of 6. Rental Car prices have skyrocketed lately.... so have gas prices. Thank goodness we only need to share fuel prices for the trips now. Two of Us still fly into MSP and drive up to S.L. with 4 others from MSP for these trips. If I recall, Your group goes to the N.W. side of Ontario, N of Winnipeg..... ? I'd think driving there from Den would be the easiest way to go, price wise... Timewise, not so much..."
6638082,RichA$1970,2022-03-06 10:13:00,1159,"I do wonder if resorts will change prices based on fuel surcharges, especially the longer fly in outposts. Some markets are projecting a 22-25% increase by this summer on gas in the US which is going to be painful for the haul up there."
