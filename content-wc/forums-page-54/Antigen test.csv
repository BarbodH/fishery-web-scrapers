6637488,english bob,2022-03-03 08:05:00,14,"It is easy to get confused about 24 hours and 1 day! The new rule for an Antigen test is it must be taken the day before crossing the border. So, if you plan to cross the border at 3pm on a Friday for example, you can get the test at any time after midnight on Wednesday in theory. Or more realistically as soon as possible on Thursday morning."
6637522,Mojo-NC,2022-03-03 10:49:00,1929,"The new requirements are not that different from what was in place last year except that now they also allow the rapid antigen test for fully vaccinated travelers as well. I think many folks are making it more difficult than it really is.Within 72 hours: RT-PCR - most accurate test but requires laboratory analysis so takes longest to obtain results (usually ~48 hours) PCR Rapid Test such as ID Now - slightly less accurate test but results are quick (usually ~2 hours)Previous Day: Rapid Antigen Test - least accurate test (nearly immediate results - usually within 30 minutes) - tests must be administered by a laboratory, healthcare entity or telehealth service. The at-home tests are not acceptable. Both PCR tests can be scheduled and performed before you leave home. You have your choice between either of the PCR tests or the antigen test at Walgreens, CVS, or any testing site near your home or on you way to Canada. It would be more of a logistical challenge to schedule the antigen test due to the time restrictions for the results, but it can be done.All of these tests are FREE. Provide your personal information, choose the type of test to be performed, and schedule the test - via the Walgreens, CVS, or your local testing site's website. Drive up at your designated time, swab both nostrils with a long Q-tip, give it to them and wait for your results via text containing a link to your results. Print the results and go. I'm pretty sure the border agent would also accept the results via your phone but we all used our printed copies."
6637526,7 Mag,2022-03-03 11:03:00,1887,Hopefully Cov. disappates to the point tests won't be required at all.
6637536,kettyspanky,2022-03-03 11:22:00,271,7 mag hopefully that is the case by spring. The ID Now test is what most people did. Thats what we did and that was a pcr test which you could do 72 hrs before crossing. In my opinion is better than a 24 hr test before crossing anyway. I'll probably do the ID Now test again if needed before crossing this year.

6637582,prov1800,2022-03-03 15:50:00,5010,Agree on that.Both useless.Just show vaccination.Would anyone care in let's say you have a guide and he wasn't vaccinated.
6637588,Eckohlt,2022-03-03 15:57:00,3685,"John you go work the border booth when I arrive,just wave me through,I'll leave you a gift on your door step at home."

6634310,Old Timer,2022-02-17 08:40:00,255,The proposed antigen-testing rule will be helpful to the folks living close to the border. They'll have access to an inexpensive test and quick results. Will it be helpful to the many anglers who have to travel a distance? Not so much.
6634318,MikeAnkeny,2022-02-17 08:55:00,67,Does anyone know if showing your test results on a phone or tablet be ok compared to a hard copy?
6634324,guidedfishing,2022-02-17 09:24:00,531,"Per the guidelines I have read, you still require a negative covid test, either an antigen test within 24hrs, or a PCR test within 72 hours, And be fully vaccinated. Right now what I read as fully vaccinated is 1st and 2nd shot or single J&J. I do not see a booster requirement. bottom line you still need covid test if vaccinated."
6634326,Hook_settr,2022-02-17 09:25:00,127,My understanding is that the preferred method is to upload your test results to ArrivCan (website portal or phone app). By doing that you will have provided the border agents with your documents of proof electronically and if you download the app to your phone you will also have it on your phone.Hope that helps!Hook_settr
6634334,spoonchucker,2022-02-17 10:00:00,82,"There are rapid tests you can take that qualify for the 72 hours (non antigen) that are acceptable to cross into Canada. I understand some are expensive. Here in Erie County NY at least last August you drove up and waited and got the results in 30 minutes, for free. (county sponsored) I believe it was the Naat test but not sure, but there are others on the list of acceptable tests including I have seen offered a rapid PCR test that can get you to cross- 72 hours. But this may all be spurious if the rules are changed again before summer."
6634576,JDP,2022-02-18 07:57:00,1457,No. The text you quote refers to on-arrival testing. You will need proof of a negative Covid Test to cross. Read the entire announcement for testing requirement to cross:https://www.canada.ca/en/public-heal...-response.html

6637386,maddogg,2022-03-02 18:05:00,178,Will they accept the IDNow covid test at the border?
6637400,kettyspanky,2022-03-02 18:42:00,271,They did last year.
6634128,bode,2022-02-16 18:05:00,39,Could someone tell me if using the Antigen test will make it easier to get across the border than having to take a pcr test? And is there still a time restriction after getting the test results? Was hoping the testing would be dropped entirely for vaccinated people. Still hoping that happens before the opener.
6634134,rather-be-fishin,2022-02-16 18:17:00,429,Canada does not accept an antigen test. Must be a PCR test to cross the border. RBF
6634152,lotsoffish1,2022-02-16 18:54:00,49,sir i don't think you have read the changes
6634160,Obabikon,2022-02-16 19:12:00,2370,Antigen tests are going to be accepted if taken within 24 hours. It will make it easier. Mostly because it is a rapid test. It is also much cheaper. It will still need to be administered by a lab.

6634208,rather-be-fishin,2022-02-17 00:04:00,429,That is GREAT news!!! It will make the pre-testing a little easier. I was not aware of this announcement! Thanks for sharing it! RBF
6634220,bode,2022-02-17 04:17:00,39,"OK here is the the part I don't really get, the new requirement states Travellers will now have the option of using a COVID-19 rapid antigen test result (taken the day prior to their scheduled flight or arrival at the land border or marine port of entry) If I travel from my home in southern Indiana and plan to stay overnight in Wisconsin, would I need to get tested in Wisconsin with an antigen test so I could cross the border within 24 hours of being tested? If I tested at home prior to leaving with the planned overnight stay using the Antigen test there wouldn't be any to make the crossing inn a 24 hour window. At age 71 and my fishing partner aged 80 driving straight through is no longer an option."
6634252,guidedfishing,2022-02-17 05:59:00,531,"Per the direction put out, the antigen test must be conducted ""under supervision"" ie lab, so your home test is out. You would need to find a location for a rapid test in WI or MN to be conducted, and provide you an email or appropriate documentation within 24hrs of hitting the border. Remember you can still get the PCR test which is 72hrs out, no change there. Although its not much of a change it does give some potential flexibility if people trying to get a PCR test come up short they can attempt to fall back on a rapid antigen test. I would not get to concerned with this yet until we get closer to May/June. There may very well be changes again.good luck"
6634300,bode,2022-02-17 08:17:00,39,Thank you guidefishing . Wanted to make sure I understood the 24 hour part. It doesn't appear to be any improvement for us. The PCR test is a problem. If we wait for results before leaving we probably won't get results back to make the 48 to 72 hour window. If we do the PCR and have results emailed we run the risk of driving 900 miles to the border and possibly having a positive test and be turned away. The same seems to be true for the antigen test with the exception of driving maybe 700 miles before risking a chance of not getting to cross. For two old farts like ourselves the change just doesn't seem that much different. just want to get back to Caribou Lake one more time. Do appreciate your response. We'll just keep hoping and praying the testing will be dropped for vaccinated fishermen before the opener. Can't believe our group is the only one affected by the time restrictions.
6634304,maddogg,2022-02-17 08:25:00,178,"As of February 28, 2022 at 12:01 a.m. EST:We will be easing the on-arrival testing for fully-vaccinated travellers. This means that travellers arriving to Canada from any country, who qualify as fully vaccinated, will be randomly selected for arrival testing. Travellers selected will also no longer be required to quarantine while awaiting their test result.Children under 12 years old, travelling with fully vaccinated adults, will continue to be exempt from quarantine, without any prescribed conditions limiting their activities. This means, for example, they no longer need to wait 14 days before attending school, camp or daycare.Unvaccinated travellers will continue to be required to test on arrival, on Day 8 and quarantine for 14 days. Unvaccinated foreign nationals will not be permitted to enter Canada unless they meet one of the few exemptions.So does this mean if I'm fully vaccinated I don't need proof of a COVID test to cross?"
