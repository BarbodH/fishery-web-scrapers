6637466,rosh1,2022-03-03 07:07:00,275,"Nice fish, Thanks for pictures."
6637584,prov1800,2022-03-03 15:52:00,5010,When are you coming up.
6637682,rosh1,2022-03-04 07:00:00,275,Things keep changing but right now the 30th for a couple of weeks. We were going to wolf hunt but can't get to where we wanted to. Now just going to fish and work at our cottage. Hoping for a little melting so we can get around.
6637694,prov1800,2022-03-04 07:51:00,5010,Where were yoù hoping to get to.
6637214,prov1800,2022-03-01 19:17:00,5010,https://youtu.be/ESk56cDuU8ECan you smell it Rosh
6637260,rosh1,2022-03-02 07:09:00,275,Yes I can!
6637286,walleyecheek,2022-03-02 09:28:00,2231,Are those killer krumbs ?
6637310,prov1800,2022-03-02 13:49:00,5010,Yup.Sure are.
6637326,7 Mag,2022-03-02 14:27:00,1887,Did you get out on Eagle lake this winter John?
6637332,prov1800,2022-03-02 14:34:00,5010,Not yet.Hooefully soon.will have to try one day but slush and snow conditions are not favorable right now.
6637356,prov1800,2022-03-02 16:03:00,5010,So today I got myself over to the shack by 10 am.Drilled my hole got all the water out of the shack and instantly had fish all over the sonar screen.Had my supper fish in about 5 min and then just caught fish after fish for a good hour till the muskie hit.Fought her for 15 min.My old Abu spinning reel did a lot screaming.Everything held up the st Croix medium mojo ice rod handled it pretty good and all my knots held up.lol..Caught my fish today on my home made hair jig and have to say iam getting used to working it right.Got muskie out of hole got jig out and took quick pics and she was back in the water within a minute.saw her swim down on sonar and spooked all those walleyes away.Was a little slow with her laying on the bottom.But ended up catching some more but left at 1 o clock.
6637366,7 Mag,2022-03-02 16:38:00,1887,That’s a nice Muskie especially with ice fishing gear!
6637430,prov1800,2022-03-02 20:47:00,5010,Definatly a good battĺe.
6637454,Bill Krejca,2022-03-03 05:40:00,6107,"Wow, nice fish. I assume the musky didn't jump much huh? Bill"
6636374,prov1800,2022-02-26 19:02:00,5010,Another pretty good few hrs at the shack.Slower today but still got around 25 or so.Few pike also.actually kept 2 of them.Havnt fried one up yet this year and I do like them from cold water.
6636442,Bill Krejca,2022-02-27 07:32:00,6107,Nice fish!!! Bill
6636448,prov1800,2022-02-27 08:06:00,5010,Thx Bill.Been fun experimenting with your hair jigs and I've made a few myself to seè what works or not.I have a number of old pike lures with hair on them so going to use them to make a few more hair jigs.Fun time time tying tgem up.This one has done very well.1/6 oz bit less hair and goes down on its own pretty good.
6636736,prov1800,2022-02-28 08:34:00,5010,With the nicer weather I pulled my stove out and had a fish fry outside on my deck.That was awesome.Had a combo walleye/pike fry and used the killer crumbs which have a great taste.First pike of the year I kept and glad I did.Pretty tasty.
6636770,Fishquest,2022-02-28 10:04:00,89,Thanks for the report and nice to see a screen filled with fish action to keep you going.
6636774,prov1800,2022-02-28 10:28:00,5010,We are lucky to have the fishiñg so close.Spring is coming soon.Hopibg for a somewhat normal year if that's possible
6636794,Fishquest,2022-02-28 11:14:00,89,"Not even sure what normal is anymore, but i'll still be fishing one way or another. I have a couple weeks booked off in marcch gonna keep an eye on the ice conditions and maybe head north if not too slushy and can still be a bit mobile to try new waters."
6636818,prov1800,2022-02-28 12:08:00,5010,Right now up here near Vermilion Bay area there is a lot of slush on most lakes.So have to be carefull where you go and doesn't hurt to have mountain sleds that can go through it if you happen to find it.Fishing is fantastic and will get way better once the melt starts and the surface water starts running off into the lakes with the new oxygen.That gets fish moving and feeding.
6637068,rosh1,2022-03-01 09:26:00,275,I hoping that by the end of the month we will be able to get around. Keep pictures coming.
6637074,prov1800,2022-03-01 09:39:00,5010,Should be better iam sure. Need some melting type weather and knock snow down so ice can lift and drain water of the top.Get rid of the slush.
