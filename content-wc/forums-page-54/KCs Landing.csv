6636142,prov1800,2022-02-25 19:13:00,5010,Speaking of cooking.You must not of read the post concerning a missing pot at VBL.. from Sept.lol.

6636188,pjshorthorn,2022-02-26 04:07:00,5654,"Oh, don't you worry......I saw the banter. Pot stealing in Canada must be a HUGE offense where fishing licenses are revoked for an entire fishing season, outdoors cards now are only good for 30 days instead of 3 years, housekeeping meals are closely supervised by lodge personnel during the cooking and dish washing each day, one community pot is left by the community fire pit for guests and only paper plates and plastic utensils are provided lest the fine china and cook wear ,found at flea markets, come up missing after one's visit..... Maybe you could find a new pot at the CO-OP and drop it off with my fish fry by this September. PjShorthorn"
