6637162,Riding high,2022-03-01 14:58:00,69,I have never fished Gullrock. I have friends that have for many years. I have met Lee Wright though. He used to work for Rob on Pakwash where we used to stay. I would suggest checking his place out on Gull Rock. It's Wrights Camp on Gullrock. I would love to get up that far north again but not interested in driving that far.

6637204,Riding high,2022-03-01 18:41:00,69,That would be nice if I could make that happen.
6636852,maddogg,2022-02-28 13:36:00,178,We are thinking of going to Gullrock this year. Anyone have any pros or cons about this lake or Keg lake. Mostly did fly-ins up to this point.
6636916,Walleye2242,2022-02-28 16:11:00,263,"fished gullrock quite a bit. great fishing lake for walleye. It can get busy during summer times on hot spots. think like 6 camps on the lake now maybe? The rules put into place by camp owners keep the fishing solid though. For me...way better fishing than anything down south in the perrault, vermillion bay area for sure."
6636920,prov1800,2022-02-28 16:31:00,5010,In which way
6636938,Walleye2242,2022-02-28 17:16:00,263,"In which way what? Why i feel the fishing is better? If that is what you mean...I have fished perrault before, fished out of Clarks a few times.....I feel the walleye fishing is better on gullrock. Quantity and quality. NO facts to back up my statement and not saying fishing is bad in that area either. Just strictly my opinion of fishing both area many times. others may say the exact opposite and have had better experiences in that area."
6636950,prov1800,2022-02-28 17:32:00,5010,That's what I meant.I fish the southern lakes and don't think fishing can get much better but that's just me and I know the lakes very well.The further north lakes are definatly good I know that and find the fishing somewhat easier.Apparently you must not of found them on Perrault or Cedar but beleive me they are there.Should be some great fishing ever√Ωwhere this season.Good luck.
6636954,Eckohlt,2022-02-28 17:44:00,3685,"For me,,,,just crossing the border and knowing that I'm going somewhere special,I love going to new lakes as often as in can.Nothing more rewarding to me than trying to figure out new water and getting on the fish.I'm 67 and until I die I'll be roaming all over N.W Ontario."
6636968,RichA$1970,2022-02-28 18:19:00,1159,67 Eck? **** you look like you are 57 so many more lakes to conquer
6636972,Eckohlt,2022-02-28 18:24:00,3685,"Thanks rich,that gives me a extra 10 years to get'er done my friend."
6636982,Walleye2242,2022-02-28 19:27:00,263,Fished all over the past 40 years up there. Caught fish everywhere. People have their preferences of places to fish. I have a cabin on a river...i love fishing a spot i call the deep hole...my buddy loves to fish the rapids. caught fish both spots...just what ya like i guess. I like gullrock better than perrault any day of the week.
6636984,Tonyo,2022-02-28 19:29:00,212,"I have 20+ trips in on that lake. It's all I really know. It has been a Great Lake for me and my group. If there is something specific I can answer, don't hesitate to message me and I would be happy to help. If you don't have a place picked out to stay, Five Lakes Lodge is top of the line. The owners are extremely nice and Ian is a huge help for anyone that is new to the lake. Good luck and have fun on whatever lake you choose to fish. TonyO."
