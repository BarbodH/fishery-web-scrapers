Not on the grand scale of the outdoor shows but totally enjoyable. There's always a conversation to be had with a local who fishes Canada and it serves to broaden my own curiosity of places I haven't been. Like so many on this site they are part of groups that have been making the jaunt to Canada for many years. I've become a vendor recently to reduce the tremendous amount of fishing tackle I've accumulated over 60 plus years. It's fascinating to see so much vintage tackle that appears at these flea markets along with a bunch of firearms that can be sold on site through the use of internet searches. I can only speak for myself but like so many walleye guys I talk to there are only a few lures that I use from year to year with success. Thank goodness for fishing flea markets."

Going to miss it this year as the camp opted out this year. It does scratch the itch for a bit. Warm weather here starting Sunday means getting out of the house and maybe in to the boat soon!
