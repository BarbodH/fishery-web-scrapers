6398080,retire55,2020-02-20 12:59:00,1029,"According to their Price List for 2020, the extra cost per person to fly to Lac Hebert from their St Anne du lac base is between 600 and 700 dollars depending on number of clients."
6398102,fishron,2020-02-20 14:47:00,317,"We did the drive-in three times. Last time out on a low tire on my honda pilot, but made it to a Quebec garage for repairs. We took a picture of the trail of dust left by the tire when the mechanic rolled it off to make the repair. I didn't want to stop and change the tire. I'd be giving several pints of blood. My opinion is, make the drive, it's not all that bad. The first time in it's interesting because it's territory that you've never traveled before. After that, not so much fun. The walleye fishing on Hebert is worth the drive."
6398176,Andre (wallyandre),2020-02-20 20:06:00,2274,"My situation may be a little different; for the time that I had my camp I was driving that road at least 6 times per summer for 12 years so I'm kind of tired, even if I know all the curves, the croosing little road etc... But it's always fun because it's a different scenery on all curves and bumps! Don't miss a trip of a life time for a little adventure on a gravel road. Lake Hebert well worth it!"
6422650,potsie225,2020-04-13 06:06:00,41,how much more did it cost you from there
6634278,Ferrispata,2022-02-17 07:24:00,63,It's an additional $600 canadian per person. Plus need to respect the weight limit of 1200 pounds passenger and luggage (there is no overweight permitted from there).
6634460,bthomas3333,2022-02-17 15:46:00,465,This would be a super cool trip. Wish I could squeeze it in. Good luck guys pounding those Hebert Walleye!
6634720,vteye3,2022-02-18 13:20:00,496,"We drove to Quebec for half dozen walleye trips (much closer) and then discovered Nakina. The drive is longer, 19 hours from my home in Montpelier area of Vermont but all highway. There is a 45 minute stretch of slow going paved road but nothing like driving Quebec's logging roads.We have never experienced walleye-pike fishing like our fly ins out of Nakina."
6394876,octanehi5,2020-02-10 19:29:00,1104,I have a few openings in pairs for my fly in to Air Tamarac's lac Hebert last week in june contact me if interested [email protected]
6395028,canyon,2020-02-11 07:55:00,37,If only the sheriff wouldn't kill me if I took 2 fishing trips to Quebec in June. Hope you find some people.
6395446,MikeG1,2020-02-12 11:41:00,433,That drive makes us hesitant.
6395474,canyon,2020-02-12 12:47:00,37,What about the drive caused concern?Sent from my SM-G930W8 using Tapatalk
6395510,Esoxfeign1313,2020-02-12 14:26:00,79,"Having made the drive twice, I can understand why you’re hesitant. Between the dust and rogue logging trucks coming at you sideways around corners, it can be a little sketchy; however, I’ll be making my 3rd trip to Clova in June, so it’s not a deal-breaker for me."
6395594,MikeG1,2020-02-12 18:47:00,433,"I’m not retired so I try to minimize my weekdays away from work. Getting there isn’t too bad. But, We typically fly out Sunday, usually mid morning. That means we need to almost pull an all-nighter to get home. It’s a 17 hour drive for us. If I had 10 or 11 straight days off it would be different."
6397246,5richards,2020-02-17 22:31:00,131,Interested please pm with info
6397802,Guest,2020-02-19 13:13:00,0,we drive into st anne du lac and fly to lac hebert from there.
6397878,Andre (wallyandre),2020-02-19 17:10:00,2274,That way you save time on the road an de gain some fishing time
6398006,Esoxmike,2020-02-20 07:33:00,114,I believe there is an extra cost to fly in from st Anne cu lac
