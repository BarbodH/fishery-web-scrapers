6635854,Eckohlt,2022-02-24 11:11:00,3685,"I'm with you guide,I think with the border issues still in place and the gas prices sky rocketing many people are going to stay home.If they would just drop a few more border restriction people may change there mind."
6635858,Obabikon,2022-02-24 11:24:00,2370,"We are the same. Basically sold out in May and June... already busy in July, August, and September. It will be a great year if WW3 isn't happening. UGH!"
6635862,Eckohlt,2022-02-24 11:32:00,3685,I think most have gone fishing during wars in the past.
6635880,Golden Eagle,2022-02-24 13:10:00,2642,There weren't any fish in South Korea streams and lakes. During World War 2 we youngsters in my neighborhood fished a local creek. Sometimes we fished with elderly men as our dads were either in uniform or working up to 60+ hours a week in defense plants. Best we not underestimate the effect of an all out war.
6635960,David Anderson,2022-02-24 18:34:00,2073,"Well, we are in the final stages of booking our trip for July. We asked if we could bring more and stay in a bigger cabin, the guy was great and said of course. The plan is to find 8 - 10 guys, do the math and deduct our winnings from the total, we will sort it out from there. Yes, tip well, buy gas and minnows there, enjoy the stay. I would love to hire a guide for the day as a goal is to get some lake trout. We are up to 8 right now, and the big cabin is available."
6635792,Fisherman Ted,2022-02-24 05:23:00,461,"This is a drop in the bucket to the pent up and unprecedented demand in the travel industry, including Canada. This summer will be historic in terms of travel, especially new guests. SO much so that in my case I have actually blocked off cabins during peak times as I cannot handle the load and want to make sure our guests are taken care of. I have heard this across the board. -FT"
6635814,Bill Krejca,2022-02-24 07:33:00,6107,"Looks like a good deal. I fished north end of Sturgeon many years ago. As stated, it is probably still underfished. We did good on trout, but walleyes were tough to find, it is a beautiful lake, but make sure, make sure, that you get a map marked up to stay away from the many rock reefs that may not be shown on the map. Folks who have gone there for a long time can still find new lower unit modifying shallows. Bill"
6635818,prov1800,2022-02-24 08:21:00,5010,Your right about that.With the amount of snow that's going to melt this year and the possibility of a wet rainy season the normally visible nuggets on the lakes will disappear and iam sure the fisherman will find those.
6635820,prov1800,2022-02-24 08:31:00,5010,Hope your right Ted.Everyone could use a full season.Definatly everyone has roll overs and hopefully they all have there shots.Heard a lot of parties where not all have been vaccinated.
6635832,Obabikon,2022-02-24 09:17:00,2370,"There are lots of ways to do this. I've done similar things before... We did a walleye central raffle one year I've donated trips to several different clubs/organizations The reality is, the person/people who come, aren't overly likely to return. However, you do get a ton of advertising from it. People promote the raffle. People talk about it. I would much rather give away $1200 worth of trip than purchase 3-$400 advertisements in magazines, along with 100 other resorts. This already has generated actual discussion. Even if we don't know it, it has put Lumberjack Lodge in the back of many of our minds. Last bit, depending on what week you're giving away... it may cost you (as the resort) far less than the advertised $1,200. If it wasn't going to be full... it really is just cleaning, and utilities. Plus you get the benefit of having people in the cabins/at the resort. My suggestion to you: Hire a guide for a day (at least), tip the dock hand and cleaning folks well, buy gas from the resort, use their minnows... 4 guys could spend $600-$800 at the resort. It wouldn't make a big difference to you ($150-$200 each), but it would be huge for the owners/employees. (just my 2 cents)"
6635838,Old Timer,2022-02-24 10:04:00,255,"Ted. I hope all Canadian camps have a terrific 2022 season. However, I made two trips last year to places that are traditionally full all summer and fall with annual roll-over guests. Both camps were nearly empty for the reasons that have been expressed on this and other threads. I learned in business early on that talk is cheap unfortunately."
6635840,Fisherman Ted,2022-02-24 10:09:00,461,"There is a HUGE difference between last year and this season. Last season was nearly a complete bust as we didn't open until August. Some camps threw in the towel and didn't even bother to open. And those that did saw many fewer guests as they had cancelled long beforehand. Plus for those of us that did open many did not have full staff so on an American Plan could not support a full camp. Guests were tired of waiting and waiting for the border to open and cancelled the trips long before the border finally opened. You cannot compare what happened last year to this one. It is completely different. This year will see the rollovers. Many camps will be full for no other reason than they have rolled over guests and if they don't show their deposits are likely lost (to the customer). Interest in Sunset Country has skyrocketed. Last year has zero bearing on the world wide travel market beginning to explode, including us."
6635846,guidedfishing,2022-02-24 10:33:00,531,"Well, I hear you, with Sturgeon being like many lakes offering all kinds of potential to upgrade you lower unit, I was particularly in awe, of all the new nuggets I could see and the new ones that I could not see with the water being down almost 3 ft. I was one nervous nelly last August since nothing on Sturgeon is a short run. I will be thankful if the lake can raise back up to normal and return all those nuggets back to their rightful depth. Years back coming out of Cobb Bay, a spot that I had been through 100 + times, my prop managed to catch a rock that certainly had been there since the beginning of time. Its a game of inches. There is nothing soft out there... As to camps being full, I would certainly hope that was the case, but the math does not support it. The pool of fisherman available and willing to head across the border did not get larger. Its crazy in the states to travel and camp that is for sure. And the folks here on this board are here because we have a long history of fishing Canada and something we are willing to take extra measures to do. However, we represent a small subset of the population and I know more than one group as already stated that either members are not going, so smaller group, or not going at all. What most of us see as a minor inconvenience in doing something we really enjoy is literally a bridge to far for others. I don't see fuel prices helping, whether I run up for a long weekend or a week at a time it costs the same amount of fuel. I myself will forgo my short trips in favor of my two longer ones this year on fuel alone. Lets hope the world does not get any crazier."
6635850,Old Timer,2022-02-24 11:03:00,255,"I hear you, Ted. But both places I went to last summer were full when I made calls on August 9th for reservations. Both operators said they'd get back to me in a couple days and they did. They then had availability and I made the trips. And like I said, both were nearly empty when I was there and I learned that most of their reservations had cancelled out for the rest of the season after the border opened. I know my sample of two camps isn't significant in the scheme of things. But it's what I saw. Both operators said nearby camps were having similar cancellations. Perhaps those who cancelled lost their deposits. But I suspect any camp can't thrive on deposits alone."
6635852,Fisherman Ted,2022-02-24 11:07:00,461,"That was LAST year. Try getting a reservation in June right now. Last year has no bearing on THIS year. I had at least 70% of my bookings cancel on me last year as well. And yes, I was sold out last year for a good while. But as the summer progressed that changed dramatically. THIS YEAR is completely different."
6635662,That Minnesota guy,2022-02-23 09:54:00,8293,"Free is what you make of it. I had a employer take me to Alaska Salmon fishing with his son. He said it was all expense paid and would cost me nothing. I believed that would have been the case. I wasn't comfortable being a freeloader on the trip so I told him I would cover all tips. This included sky caps at the airport, fishing guide, fish cleaning kids, cooks ect. By the time it was done I spent a pretty good wad of change, but I wouldn't have had it any other way. Enjoy the trip, make sure the guys all tip the staff well and above all have fun."
6635666,David Anderson,2022-02-23 10:11:00,2073,"Not only that but it was a great incentive to go to Alaska with someone who knew the routine and a good excuse. Hopefully we can make this happen as both him and I have a Sturgeon trip planned for that time in Oregon. So much fishing, so little time!"
6635670,MN_Moose,2022-02-23 10:35:00,964,"That looks like a nice resort, nice cabins on an interesting lake. Give us a trip report when you return."
6635692,prov1800,2022-02-23 12:02:00,5010,"John, Sign me up for a raffle ticket. I do think anyone who wins one should go in with an open mind, set the bar low, hopefully be pleasantly surprised and leave a nice tip or hopefully future business. Getting a housekeeping cabin, boat and motor for 2 people free is a good deal as the fishing / lake is the main draw imo. I think it makes sense on a low demand week like mid August as a way to attract new customers with minimal cost. Based on your experience, what are the slowest weeks of the season you see typically for vacancies up your way- preCovid?[/QUOTE]Normally camps are pretty busy each month.id have to say Sept slows down."
6635706,v-bay gord,2022-02-23 12:50:00,3168,"If you are new to the business, giving away a trip at a show is good pr., plus you are collecting a contact list of potential guests who are all interested in fishing. If you have the vacant spaces then it's a pretty good marketing strategy. The best marketing is word of mouth but before that happens you need the happy guests."
6635710,proguidedream,2022-02-23 12:56:00,345,i think you are looking to far into this. its not like you are flying into a mexican condo resort.. just find out the details of the win and then enjoy. The candian lodges pay a lot of money to attend these outdoor shows. if they put a raffle out for a free stay they may get a 1000 email adresses in the pot they can send out to thank people for trying and remind them about the camp. or if they win 3 days they might choose to book extra days or come back next year. win win for everyone it is no different then entering a cabelas/best buy contest. the only risk to win is giving them your contact info... then you may recieve spam mail from best buy forever. but im sure fishing lodges dont have the time nor abality to send multiple emails a month to people.
6635726,guidedfishing,2022-02-23 15:29:00,531,"Well, if you end up going, I fish Sturgeon every year, mostly on the north end now. A few years I fished out of Cobb bay so I know right where you are talking about. For many years at least one of my trips have been to White Sands. Lake Trout good, Nice Pike, It takes a while to crack the code on walleyes but once you do there are some dandy's. I have spent a lot of hours on Sturgeon, huge lake, largely underfished. keep us posted I hope it works out."
6635748,Yellowfin123,2022-02-23 18:08:00,2182,"seems like it would be good advertisement for the resort at not much cost at all, as mentioned above, most places will only be at half or 2/3rds capacity all summer probably with the border hassles"
6635764,Fisherman Ted,2022-02-23 20:57:00,461,"Yes, could be good marketing I guess if you have the space. But I disagree with your comment that we will only be half full. We have had 2 years of rollovers and everyone I know including my operation will be completely packed. The border has been open since last August and they are slowly chipping away at the requirements to pass. This will be an epic year. Which is the shot in the arm we all need. -FT"
6635780,RichA$1970,2022-02-23 22:45:00,1159,Hope you are right but from a previous post there were a lot of posters saying they won’t be going or just partial parties will go. 64% of the US adults have been poked twice so there’s a 1/3 who can’t go & I can only imagine the price of gas after tonight’s fiasco will also impact some to back out as that’s going to be a mess. I’m booked for 2 and hoping for a 3rd run up North.
6635590,David Anderson,2022-02-22 22:07:00,2073,"My brother just won a free week at a resort in Canada at a local Sportshow, won't mention the name. Of course we are suspicious, what is the end result, is this a time share deal? The owner stated that hopefully we will like it and come back. Interesting strategy as many Ontario resorts live off of return business but I think these Covid restrictions have really come home to roost. Last September we got the opportunity to return to our resort on Lac Seul only to run into a fiasco at the border costing us 3 hours even though we meet all the requirements. 6 of 10 were given random covid tests and one of our guy's test claimed he tested positive and had to quarantine even though we had returned to the US before the test were confirmed. He tested immediately after getting word and it was negative. We expected that the camp would be full but only 2 cabins were occupied. I suspect this resort owner is experiencing the same issue, no one is coming. The trip is for 4 guys and if I go, I will pay the owner his normal rate for my stay. His fishing knowledge will be my prize! Sad for sure."
6635604,Eckohlt,2022-02-23 03:50:00,3685,"If you state the name maybe someone on WC has been there and he can clue you in about the place.your fishing knowledge must be worth something also,don't you think?"
6635616,prov1800,2022-02-23 05:27:00,5010,Last year when border opened most of the camps were not very busy.
6635626,guidedfishing,2022-02-23 06:14:00,531,"It depends on the camp, this strategy has been in place long before Covid was a thing. You win a free trip, but your buddies pay full price. Well if their full price is high enough it covers you. I have little faith in these schemes as nothing is free, and I suspect when you divide the cost by 4 it will be comparable to any other camps for what 4 would of paid.In essence the fish camp turns you into their recruiter to fill four seats.Do your research, and I don't understand why you won't drop the name of the camp. If they are legit, you will likely find out in a hurry one way or another here. I would just about guarantee more than one person won a free trip for different weeks. good luck"
6635628,Huntindave,2022-02-23 06:32:00,2194,"I have been on two ""free"" trips to a Canadian resort on Lake of the Woods. The free trip was very straight forward and clear about what it covered. It was good for the cabin rental and boat dockage for two people. If only two folks occupied the cabin, the cabin was entirely free. The free dockage was good for one boat.Anything like bait, gas, snacks or meals were additional expenses not covered by the ""free"" trip.Yes, it was/is a well know popular camp. This was one of their marketing tools and an advertising expense for the resort. My friend and I just happened to be one of the lucky recipients two years in a row. The advertising/marketing money was well spent for the resort, as we have been there many times over the years. Good advertising, followed up by good service, is a winning combination for any resort.Nothing shady about it, in my experience."
6635634,RichA$1970,2022-02-23 07:22:00,1159,Most shows offer this and it’s a form of marketing. Nothing is free so it’s a crap shoot so I’d read the small and then estimate the total cost to see how free it is.
6635636,prov1800,2022-02-23 07:47:00,5010,Rich.I have had the opportunity to guide some guys on the free trips and those parties had nothing but good things to say about.These free trips were house keeping so besides bringing up your basics they did not pay for anything.Depending on the camp they were at.Only thing you might have to pay for would be bait.If it's Clarks there is no bait fee and most other camps give you 2 doz per person per day so if you don't go over that your not getting charged.Normally all packaģes include fuel.I do a couple of free guide days myself that are totally free and everything included.Any lake any species.

Nope, cabin for 4, $325 value/person, $1300. This was won through Lumberjack Lodge on Sturgeon Lake. I have a friend who has been going to Cobb Bay lodge, up the road and they simply love it. The lake trout fishing interests me. The amount per person normally is not that bad. I understand it's a gimmick to get people there and thinking through it I've seen this before, just never won, so maybe it's not a desperate move as I originally thought. Never the less the guy told my brother it is an attempt to get clients coming back. I love Lac Seul but my crowd is getting tired of the Covid crap. I realize nothing is ever free, however if I go I will expect myself to step up and at least acknowledge the value and so I have to pay for minnows, it isn't the end of the world."
