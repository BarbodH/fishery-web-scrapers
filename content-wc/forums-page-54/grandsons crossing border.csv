6639482,valley366,2022-03-11 08:38:00,193,"I can tell you that it is not required based on experience and actually calling Ontario customs office. I had to do this a couple years back when I missed that the passports expired in April and we were going in June. I can tell you in my experience I had original certified birth certificates and we took the expired passports.I strongly recommend the passports as it makes things easier and that is the 100% solution. Doing the passport is not the time hog people play it out as. Go to Walgreens, Costco or any one of like 20 places that will take a passport photo. Sit down at a computer and type the forms. Go on the customs website and locate a place to submit and make an appointment. I think it takes 10 minutes in that office once you get there. That is based on having all the required documents in hand.The arrive Canada app or paperwork is another thing you must do. Along with vaccination proof and the negative test that meets their requirements.Work to do but well worth it."
6639486,kettyspanky,2022-03-11 08:50:00,271,Right on Valley. I took my son for his picture at walgreens. 10 mins and $15. We did the paperwork and went to the post office. 10 mins and $50. Very easy to do. I know a few families that crossed last year and the ones with passports for the kids had 0 issues. 2 families that didn't have passports for the kids got the random tests. I'm not sure if the passports had anything to do with the randoms but I know it was easier for the ones who had it. Yes the ArriveCan app is another thing along with the 72 hr tests. Hopefully the tests are gone soon and being vaccinated will be all we need. fingers crossed.
6639496,Old Timer,2022-03-11 09:13:00,255,"I took four grandchildren across last August. I had notarized parent letters, but wasn't asked for them. The kids were under age twelve and back then didn't qualify for the Covid vaccine. All four automatically had to random test. As a side note maybe fifteen years ago I was coming back from a fishing trip with my adult, but young-looking daughter. We crossed at Pigeon River. The customs agents had my daughter get out of the truck and asked her questions about whether she felt safe traveling with me. Apparently they were having trouble with human trafficking. She told him I was her dad and we were returning from a fishing trip. They looked again at her passport and we were on our way. No problem just doing their job."
6639522,valley366,2022-03-11 10:43:00,193,"Yes, the agents ask all the questions of where are you going, how long staying, does your mom know to the kids. At least 3 out of the 5 times I have taken my kids that has been the routine. In my case it was whatever kids that was sitting in the back on the drivers side."
6639606,JAY221,2022-03-11 18:51:00,877,"My understanding is that they will need some form of passport to reenter the USA. You will also need the letter mentioned from the mother with her contact info. We have taken a young man with us for the last 5 years and I have always had a letter from his mom, a copy of her divorce decree showing she has sole custody and a copy of his birth certificate. I automatically hand it over with our passports and his since he has turned 16. This past August it was just him and I that got to go up in Mid August as the wife couldn't make it work for her. He was just shy of 17 and I had all the paperwork for him but with the border the way it was I didn't give anything they didn't ask for and we weren't at the border window 5 minutes and they never asked about an unrelated minor crossing with an old guy and we were on our way. Everything was in the CANAM app Later, Jay"
6639704,Slim03,2022-03-12 10:32:00,159,"I have taken my son with me since he was 10. We always traveled with just a passport and there was no issues. In 2019 he went with me and a larger group of guys. They pulled me, my son, and a buddy inside the border station at International Falls and asked a lot of questions and most of those questions directed at my 12 year old son. Everything went smoothly but you could tell that they were wanting to make sure that we were not kidnapping him. They then suggested that next time I bring a note from my wife and gave me a copy of the layout that they would like to have filled out."
6639348,BKThusker,2022-03-10 19:30:00,12,I am wanting to take my twin grandsons and their father to Canada this summer. They turn 16 at the end of June and we are wanting to cross the border mid July. Will they need to have passports this summer to cross the border with their father ? This will be their first trip and hopefully we will make this an annual trip Thanks in advance for any help

6639412,kettyspanky,2022-03-11 04:07:00,271,I don't believe they need one until they are 18. I'm taking my son hopefully this year and he is 9. I got him a passport last month. I think it will make things easier. I think I still need a note from his mother notarized saying where he is going and who with. The passport was $50 plus $15 for the picture. It's only good for 5 years. I think if you don't want to get one for them you need their birth certificate and notarized note from the mother. I'm sure more people will chime in on this. I think there are some old write-ups in this somewhere in the forums also.
6639422,h8go4s,2022-03-11 05:40:00,1673,"Here's a link to the Canadian government's website on this. It can be complicated, so check it carefully. The ArriveCAN account (free) might be the easiest, but I haven't done that yet. You have plenty of time.https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/tr...nada#at-border"
6639424,h8go4s,2022-03-11 05:45:00,1673,But you don't know.
6639426,BKThusker,2022-03-11 05:52:00,12,"we will be driving and crossing the border at Pembina, can some confirm that they will not need a passport until the age of 18. I will attempt to get them passports but they are both so **** busy thanks in advance"
6639430,nitroman,2022-03-11 06:02:00,368,"no, they do not. What they need is a note from the mother as they are traveling with Dad right? The note doesn't need to be notarized but it may help if there would be issues. There are forms available for download for minor travel to fill out for the Mom and sign. Take a photo copy of her license as well as her contact info so they can get ahold of her if there are issues a copy of birth cert helps as well. A minor child is a minor child and a passport will not help a lot but i always had one for my boy when we crossed as well as all the above. It's a form of ID so..... Even when he went up with his uncle there were no issues. travel letter singed by mom stating travel dates, destination, who they are traveling with etc. photo copy of moms ID Copy of birth cert contact info for mom"
6639432,kettyspanky,2022-03-11 06:06:00,271,h8go4s I see its on that website. Lot's to read.
6639436,walleyecheek,2022-03-11 06:53:00,2231,One phone call away.......simple !!!
6639438,walleyecheek,2022-03-11 06:55:00,2231,But then again I'm not sure border patrol would know &#x1f923;
