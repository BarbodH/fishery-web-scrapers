6640192,Eckohlt,2022-03-14 17:09:00,3685,John looks like you were hungry and took a bite out of his fin?
6640198,Yellowfin123,2022-03-14 17:58:00,2182,"true, with 18-20ft and 200-300hp a guy could get out on the big water to the hot spots, the winoga cabin could be a cool hang out... its 6 miles from the cabin to the bridge then on to where ever"
6640208,prov1800,2022-03-14 18:24:00,5010,That fish was chewed up on both sides Eck either a muskie or pike.Its still swimming out it back so lucky fish.
6640062,70wildcat,2022-03-14 07:04:00,5,"Considering a trip to Vaughan Lake in mid August. When I search I'm not finding much in recent history. Would love some opinions, maybe pre Covid. Have made some trips to Canada before but not to this area. Looking mainly for walleye and northern with some numbers. Thanks, Mark"
6640068,prov1800,2022-03-14 08:04:00,5010,Can't go wrong.Its part of Lac Suel and main lake is short boat ride out of Vaughn.It is a boat in from Sioux lookout.Wont be disappointed.Call Troy at Winoga **** tell you what you need to know
6640088,Pooch,2022-03-14 09:44:00,4618,That would be a very long boat ride from Sioux Lookout? I've seen lead boats taking in camp boats of fisherman coming from the north headed for Vaughn. Not sure where they were coming from. SWW? Who else has outposts on Vaughn? I've only ventured into Vaughn a few times and that was several years ago. Saw a couple cabins that looked empty back then. It is a pretty area and relatively protected from high winds. Pooch
6640126,Yellowfin123,2022-03-14 13:52:00,2182,"i went into vaughn a few times in early july of 2019, fishin was ok i guess but mostly all were really small but then i'm no walleye expert i think vaughn is a sanctuary until sometime mid june, i saw the the whole lake, winogo outpost cabin, it was occupied with some coolers on the porch but the camp boat was not on vaughn anywhere i saw a winoga guide boat come in, a good size boat with 4 or 5 guys onboard, they fished about an hour and took off never to be seen again and like pooch said i was like ""where the h#ll did he come from""? all the was from the SE?? it was really windy one day so we followed some guys we met at mahkwa and fished the entrance to vaughn to get outa the wind, caught a few nice pike.. everybody plus myself were heading north and west everyday 90% of the time.. vaughn seemed pretty dead of fisherman, it would not be for me for 7 days in a little camp boat, too many places to explore on lac seul"
6640136,Eckohlt,2022-03-14 14:24:00,3685,"I was in Vaughn some 30 years ago a few times,let's just say I don't ever need to see that part of the lake again,but who knows maybe things have changed from that many years ago."
6640144,Yellowfin123,2022-03-14 14:57:00,2182,"we caught alot to the northwest of mahkwa around all the islands, i think every fish that was 16 to 20"" some of the other guys were going west and down into bray lake everyday i just didn't want to go that far, my next target is the the NE waters"
6640156,Skywagon,2022-03-14 15:35:00,1106,"I have flown in and fished out of a friends cache boat a couple of times on Vaughn. It might be a long week if you only have a camp boat with a small outboard, you won't be able to range out into Lac Seul far."
6640158,prov1800,2022-03-14 15:38:00,5010,Lots of fisherman that head to any of the many outposts on Lac Suel bring their boats.
6640162,Skywagon,2022-03-14 15:47:00,1106,"He did not mention bringing a boat or not, if he brought a descent size boat that would change the equation. John, it is too nice a day to be inside, what are we thinking?"
6640170,prov1800,2022-03-14 15:55:00,5010,Sky I just got home from a boring day in Dryden.Then plowed my yard.Did fish yesterday with some friends from Thunder Bay.Nice looking week.Pick a day and let's go.
