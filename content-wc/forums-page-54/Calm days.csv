6633632,prov1800,2022-02-15 07:57:00,5010,Storms are amazing and some pretty scary.Being on the water daily over 30 years of guiding have seen it all.The big lakes are the worst like Eagle and Lac Suel.Have had to go to shore many times.Allthough shore not the safest place at times either.Have seen lightning take out many trees close by.That noise is incredible.

6633652,Bill Krejca,2022-02-15 08:43:00,6107,"Re: sharing storm adventures - Sometime you don't even have to be out on the water. 1994, Obabikon Lake, tent camped on a beautiful small island, early June woke to a sudden terrific continuing gust of wine which came under the tent floor and threw Dad from his cot up in the air onto my friend's cot. We scrambled out of the tent into a gusty rain which would have picked up the inhabited tent along with its 4 occupants in to the lake, which was only feet away. For the next perhaps 20 minutes, we all grabbed and hung on , full body weight, whatever we could hang onto on the tent to keep it from being blown into the lake. The folks in the neighboring tent did likewise. It isn't a whole heck on a lot of fun to go from a sound sleep to getting drenched and wind whipped/ almost being pushed into the lake. The storm lasted for an hour or so, but the wind did let up enough for us to re-secure (?) the tent stakes, using rocks, etc. A very memorable event, still vivid in memory after some 25 years or so. The fishing was great for the next several days- getting back to the landing, 8 miles away, on a Saturday took us almost the entire day, as the wind and waves separated the 4 boats from each other out on the water. Several weeks after, the area was hit by a terrific uncharacteristic tornado, which downed hundreds of trees, one island in Obabikon was almost completely tree topped. Luckily, these events only happen infrequently, but they sure are memorable! We were lucky we only experienced the forerunner of the tornado! Bill"
6633672,RichA$1970,2022-02-15 09:24:00,1159,Mother Nature usually wins. That’s the drawback of fishing a big lake which it sucks when the winds pick up & you’re in a small boat.

6634400,stumcfar,2022-02-17 11:50:00,451,"We had a year a Lac Seul where the temps were hovering around the 90 degree mark the first 3 days. On the third day a heavy thunderstorm was forecast for early afternoon. The other two boats took off to fish Steamboat Narrows area because they had bigger motors. We didn't want to get caught in a storm so didn't go as far. That morning was again pushing 90 and dead calm. We fished an area of flooded stumps in 3 to 6 feet of water. With those temps and as warm as the water was, there was no reason for fish to be there. We had an unbelievable morning, with a lot of big fish. The walleyes actually felt hot when you pulled them out of the water. Not sure what they were doing in there, that hot and calm, but they were there and hungry. As for the thunderstorm, we made it in time, but it was a nasty one with inches of rain and terrible lightning. Glad we didn't get caught in it!"
6634468,Pooch,2022-02-17 16:19:00,4618,"One of the scariest and most brutal rides I've ever had was coming from Shanty Narrows through Steamboat against (we later found out was) forty mph head winds. Visibility near zero and trying to find shore would have probably capsized us. Sixteen foot Lund Rebel no match for LS that morning. A good fresh track when we left camp earlier in the day was a God send as I zoomed in and followed it like a hawk while working the tiller and throttle.Saw the storm coming up over the trees as we fished McKenzie and left, but it was coming in very fast. We were not the only ones getting our azz's handed to us that day. Just got into Steamboat when it hit us full force. Too late to seek shelter.Pooch"
6634478,Eckohlt,2022-02-17 16:47:00,3685,"Sounds like material for a Hollywood movie,just have to come up with a name for the movie?any ideas?"
6633356,nitroman,2022-02-14 07:42:00,368,Had one week where the wind didn't blow and there were no clouds for the entire week. It was warm and the walleye fishing was great. We were sight fishing them everywhere. It's amazing to see what the lake looks like when the wind isn't stirring it up and the sediment settles out.
6633378,prov1800,2022-02-14 08:35:00,5010,Must of been early in season and on a clear lake.Have sight fished walleyes most years on a very clear water lake.Easy to see them swimming in the shallow water and take the bait on a slip bobber.Looking forward to that in 3 months or so.lol.
6633388,HeHooksHimself,2022-02-14 08:47:00,725,"One of our best hours of walleye fishing was probably not unique to us but was very memorable. The stereotypical calm before the storm. We were sitting on a hole that had been productive for us and the clouds were building in the west. The air was still but electric and we were pulling up fish after fish almost all over 24"". As we kept our eye on the west the bite did not slow. Soon the lightning arose in the west and almost immediately started cracking much too close to us. We were forced to reel up and beat it back to camp which was 20 minutes or so away. After a terrifying ride back through now powerful rain and sudden wind we finally pulled up to the dock, thankful for our lives, and scurried our rain-soaked selves into the cabin with a memory that we still recall when reminiscing about our adventures in the north. Fish On! Hooks"
6633394,Juls,2022-02-14 09:11:00,13414,"Had the same type of storm situation happen to us, on my first fly in trip up there. EXCEPT, when I saw the clouds doing their thing, I told my partner, ""We should head back, it's building, and doesn't look good"". He reluctently agreed, and we packed up for the 1/2 hour ride back to camp. Well, he listened for a whole 1/2 mile....until, we came up on two friends of ours that waved us over, pointing at the water and signaling lots of big Pike, and a good bite. So, of course, my partner stops and starts casting. (insert eye-roll here)I threw a few casts too...because, who wouldn't? A few minutes passed, and I again expressed my concern for the building storm headed our way, and told the other two the same. They said they would be behind us, so we packed up again and left for camp.It was the worst storm I have ever been in on the water. It hit us 1/2 way back. We were in the channel between Ara and Meta Lakes...headed to Meta. I just thought to myself...""Well, if I die...this is a pretty place to die in"", and relaxed, because it was all out of my control anyway.Lightning was crackling down in big bolts all around us, with almost instant thunder, so there was a good chance if we got hit, we were going to die. My partner, who was getting hit with almost every wave on the way back across Meta Lake, got us back safe and sound. Bob and Ned, the other two that were behind us, didn't show up for dinner, so we were worried (Bob was in his mid-80's at that time). After the storm passed, Bob and Ned showed up, and said they took shelter at another camp that wasn't being used. Whew!Anyway....that's as close to defying death as I ever want to get again...but, it's a cool memory to have. I can still see some of those more memorable lightning bolts crashing down, and the look on my partner's face, when I think back."
6633416,Laketripper,2022-02-14 10:10:00,103,Love those cabin rattling thunder storms we get in NW Ontario. The echo from the thunder is something to hear. I've been caught on the water too many times I'm embarased to say. Once had a fisherman take shelter at my cabin during a wicked storm...he said a water spout popped up and that was enough for him.
6633438,nitroman,2022-02-14 11:23:00,368,Cedar lake week 4. Fishing the reef off of Gull island. Watching the walleye move up and down the reef with the redhorse in 15-20 FOW dangling a jig and watching the walleye suck it in. It was just cool. The whole week the water on the east leg was clear and we could site fish everywhere we went. On the flip we have also had some white knuckle E-ticket rides back in storms thinking man we should of left 10 min earlier. Also sat a few out that we just knew there was no chance to make it back so we suited up and took it. Many times as we watched storms rolling in from the west we got on a pre-storm bite that was just nuts. Like the walleye nearly wanted to jump in the boat with us. A lot of great memories over the years I guess.
6633440,prov1800,2022-02-14 11:35:00,5010,Cedar has fairly clear water in east side at times and have sight fished walleyes in the rocks there.west end is much clearer and can see fish there much better.pretty neat when that happens.
6633448,nitroman,2022-02-14 11:45:00,368,I have fished the west leg a bit but am prone to stay on the east leg. Need to explore the west more but not as familiar with it. Have done ok in Hatfield bay some days.

I have a real short video of that wicked one!As far as walleyes on a calm day, my dad and I were fishing Lake Onaman in June, temperatures were in the mid 90s with no breeze what so ever. 7 hours of fishing 101 walleyes."

6632828,Pooch,2022-02-12 14:30:00,4618,"Rather than totally hijack another thread this.Prov1800 was talking about calm fishing being good sometimes and I remembered this picture from way back when on Birch lake, ON. Wife and I fishing a weed edge next to a drop off with some weather coming in. Jig and plastic worm and fish after fish. Stupid fishing ahead of the storm that night. Good memories.The largest walleye I've ever caught came at high noon sun on a hot flat dead calm water day. The only fish that my boat caught that day... weird.How about the rest of you? Experiences?Pooch"
6632850,Eckohlt,2022-02-12 15:35:00,3685,I've done great on flat water.
6632860,Ndstallmann,2022-02-12 15:51:00,549,I feel the walleye chop is over rated. I have my best luck on calm days.
6632864,prov1800,2022-02-12 15:52:00,5010,Calm brings good fishing.weed edges and inside weeds are great to fish in and yes there are a lot of good sized fish hiding in the weeds all summer.weedless jigs and seedless hooks drop shot in the weeds is crazy good fishing.

6632994,Shane Denotter,2022-02-13 05:47:00,39,One morning fishing on Lake Nipigon it was cold dreary and overcast. Fish bite was crazy good. It started to snow with flakes about the size of paper plates and BOOM no more fish til later in the afternoon.

Generally speaking, tho, success on these kinds of days has been outnumbered in most waters on cooler days by fishing the wind seam. Bill"
6633040,Eckohlt,2022-02-13 08:35:00,3685,"It's not often you get dead calm waters n bright sunshine,most the time there's always alittle breeze or to much breeze."
6633054,Mojo-NC,2022-02-13 08:53:00,1929,"We have only fished June and September, so most of the days we've fished have had a ""walleye chop"" after 8:00 AM or so. Therefore, we catch most of our fish with a chop on the water. On the few clear and calm days, we've had more crappy days but a few great days. One day in particular, my son and I were fishing an outpost lake that we had never fished before. We went to a couple of places identified by the camp owners as good places to fish. We decided to check out an area around a couple of islands out near the middle of the lake. There was a chop on the water when we arrived and we got into some fish but while fighting the wind it was difficult to stay on them. The wind laid down while we were there and I was able to dissect the area with precision. We ended up catching eighty 18-21"" fish in 4 hours. That was the most intense 4 hours of any trip I've had up there. It can happen, after all it is Canada. My hands were so torn up from that day that they were swollen for about a week. Good times!"
