6639614,RichA$1970,2022-03-11 19:50:00,1159,Agreed as I will wait and call around for vacancies via standby moving forward. It worked well last fall and I know it was a short season but there’s plenty of good camps to call to fill a gap last minute.
6639650,Obabikon,2022-03-12 07:09:00,2370,"For us, deposits will never go away, unless people start paying in full. The risk of people canceling on short notice, or even worse... just not showing up, is too great. Even with last minute bookings, we're going to have to start requiring electronic deposits. Before people arrive, resorts order/prepare food, increase staffing, and schedule our days. (ex: if I don't have a guest arriving on Monday, I can guide that day, if that guest doesn't arrive, I lose out on the group and a day of guiding). There's just too much risk if both sides don't have skin in the game. I am done taking risks. As they say... trust is a two way street built over time. Luckily, Obabikon (and most other resorts out there) have built a group of loyal, consistent, honest, and supportive clients. We're always looking to add to it... but we've all been burned enough times that deposits are a must."

6639546,proguidedream,2022-03-11 13:52:00,345,i guess when it already costs 7 grand for a trip and they are only open for 8 weeks they can charge whatever they need to still turn a profit. not to many places to catch a 70 pound trout with that kind of service. i would have went elsewhere also

6639050,nitroman,2022-03-10 06:54:00,368,"Reading thru this and doing some napkin math the increase from last year to this year if gas is at let's say $4.50/gal my costs for gas the trip will increase by $150 ish. We can eat pretty cheap so not a big increase there. I typically only use the one tank of gas in my boat so that may be a marginal increase for a full tank for the trip. So if I stay away from Cabela's, Bass Pro, local bait shops and such and convince myself that I have all the tackle and stuff I need for the trip that savings alone will pay for the increased costs. Hobbies can be and are expensive when you travel to destinations for them. After years of Riding sleds out west 3-4 times a season I understand this well. I figure now that retired from sledding and focused on fishing I am saving money now . HAHA! Good luck all and let's hope things settle down a bit over the next 90 days and we all make the trip and have the best year ever since we started doing this! After a 2 year lockout there are walleye up there waiting to jump in my boat and who am I to deny them!"

6639080,gowrlop,2022-03-10 08:07:00,109,"My thoughts. I have three trips planned this year to Northwest Ontario. They are all drive to or boat to camps. I know fuel at the camps will be record highs, nothing I can do about it. I fully understand and support if they have fuel surcharges I plan to fish all my spots no matter how far they are from the camp. I spend many a sleepless nights all winter thinking about these pristine locations, not gonna let the cost stop me. I tell people all the time, "" In ten years, you wont remember working that week but you will remember that week you went on the fishing trip"". My plan is to cut out some luxuries in my daily life to cover the extra cost of fuel, not only for fishing but life in general. These changes started Monday. There are many things I can cut to help out. For me, there is just to much value to those trips. I know everyone's situation is different and I feel for those that just can't go because of increased costs. It sucks. I hope everyone finds a way to go. I also hope the camps can struggle through another unprecedented season and make it. Without the camps, we have no where to go. Roger Brown"
6639090,That Minnesota guy,2022-03-10 08:29:00,8293,"Last year I had a guy who made multiple trips to Rainy Lake leave his boat at my house rather than pull it back and forth to Iowa. I'll make the same offer to anyone doing Canada multiple times. Leave your boat here if you would like to. It's not much, but it will save you some gas."

6639452,Obabikon,2022-03-11 07:37:00,2370,"I do want to add, that there's a lot more than gas going into boats that is going to hit because of these fuel prices. 1. Generator fuel 2. Propane costs 3. Food costs 4. Delivery costs Just to name a few. The fuel surcharge will be for more than gas being put into a boat."
6639454,prov1800,2022-03-11 07:43:00,5010,One word to describe this.BAD.
6639490,Eckohlt,2022-03-11 08:57:00,3685,I'm going to call Aaron rodgers soon and see if I can borrow some money for my trips this year.
6639494,krazyk711,2022-03-11 09:11:00,26,"How about being bumped $700 last year and then having them threaten that you'll get bumped again for a trip that was booked in 2019 and was pushed back to 2023 with Plummers ! Once they get that deposit you are not locked in to that rate and they can do anything they want !! Sure prices change but what a poor way of doing business !! Zero explanation just ""here's your new invoice""... Just a warning for those considering a trip."
6638792,prov1800,2022-03-09 09:38:00,5010,One trip won't break the bank.Got to do another trip to Broad to.lol.
6638804,Old Timer,2022-03-09 10:12:00,255,"Okay, I get for outfitters to survive they may have to add surcharges to already-sold trips. For many fishermen a surcharge on a tank or two of outboard gas isn't a big deal. It wouldn't be for me either. But the analysis is different for a guy who has already bought a fly-in outpost trip for himself and his two teenagers. Let's say the trip he bought was $1,500/person and has been rolled over the past two years, with the outfitter holding on to the deposit. So that's $4,500 for the three of them. That trip could easily morph into $6-7,000 with surcharges to cover the rising price of aviation fuel plus the fly in expense of outboard gas. That kind of increase might kill the trip regardless of how bad the dad wants to take his kids on a one-in-a-lifetime fishing adventure. And, perhaps, he can't get his deposit back unless he reaches a resolution with the outfitter. That's not good for the fisherman, the reputation of the outfitter or the fishing industry as a whole. Deposits are the life blood of the Canadian tourist industry. Deposits carry the outfitters through the lean winters and, more importantly, assure that guests show up for their summer reservations. Without deposits or other financial assurances, many guests would skip their scheduled trips. This is because something always comes up that's is equally important as fishing in Canada. So the Canada trip loses and falls by the wayside. Happens all the time. Now fast forward to years like 2022 and the future. How many fishermen are going to put down deposits when the outfitter can't guarantee the price of the trip? I suspect few. So then the industry changes to a situation where fishermen can make last minute calls for desirable dates with no deposit or assurance of showing up, or simply choose to fish near home from nearest municipal dock. Either way it will be a terrible blow to the Canadian fishing industry. Tough choices for everybody. I get it."
6638828,prov1800,2022-03-09 10:40:00,5010,Well said.Bad situation

If you trust your camp owner to be fair and you have some ""cushion"" in your personal finances, I would re-book for the following year. Fuel prices could go down, but not this year. Right now everything is doom and gloom, hopefully it will not always stay this way. Patience grasshoppers.... Pooch"
6638998,v-bay gord,2022-03-09 18:55:00,3168,"In the scheme of things a 25 hp or 40 hp Yamaha are pretty fuel efficient. I'm not going to blow a gasket over an extra $80-$100 over the course of a week. For the few who like to joy ride around the lake and burn up as much fuel as possible, they will have a surcharge. For the operators who fuel planes I think they need to charge more and not lose money. For those who invested in fuel sucking high horsepower boats and motors.....might be time to rethink the long term plan."
6639010,Yellowfin123,2022-03-09 19:41:00,2182,"of course lodges owners should be charging more for gas, thats an issue thats not even worth talkin about!"
6639034,Pooch,2022-03-10 05:18:00,4618,One camp we fish has a fuel allowance even if you bring your own boat. They should not have to absorb the recent price spike. Pooch
6639048,guidedfishing,2022-03-10 06:31:00,531,"In the end the consumer will make the decision. They will either go / return based on good service, known value to them or best deal as they perceive it. Maybe even and hopefully both. Operators / Sellers of goods will price their services and goods accordingly to make a profit or stay in business. Either the consumer will pay it or they will not. No one stays in business long if they can't pay the bills and turn a profit. I would not expect any vendor/operator to give anything away. A service has value and the consumer either perceives that value and pays or they move on. p.s. I seriously doubt you are going to see the avg fisherman running a 115 or 150 on a fishing boat return to a 25-40hp any time soon regardless of the price. These motors are more efficient than they ever have been. The comment about rethinking their big motors did make me chuckle. If someone can put a 300hp on their boat my assumption is they can pay for the fuel, and why would you care as long as you can make a profit on the fuel as a vendor. Bottom line, it will cost more, unfortunately it may price some folks out and add to the pain of recovery from our collective border challenges. The rest of the world would probably perceive this entire conversation as petty at this time."
6638692,kettyspanky,2022-03-09 04:45:00,271,I was wondering the same thing about people going or not with the gas prices. For me it does come into play. I am still working yet so I can handle a little extra but not alot. My fishing partner pays for half the gas but he is retired and not rich either. He called the other day and we discussed going or not depending on fuel costs. $5 dollar gas is doable but $7 dollar gas probably not. It's about 100 gallons for the truck and boat round trip. I really enjoy going so hopefully we can. I am taking my 9 year old son this year if we do go. I guess time will tell. Good luck to all.

6638730,kettyspanky,2022-03-09 06:58:00,271,Well I guess I could look at it this way. In 2020 I saved gas money because we couldn't go. I'm surely going to try to make it. I guess time will tell. Anything can happen and usually does.

6638630,Pooch,2022-03-08 19:19:00,4618,"Since the live bait thread has morphed into a price increase by camps for fuel expenses, I'll start a new one here? I paid fuel surcharges on everything I had delivered a few years ago. From my garbage pickup to grain deliveries. I didn't like it, but agreed that it was only fair. After a two year absence, fuel surcharges showed up last month on my garbage bill once again. Others will soon fallow. If the camps I fish furnish boat fuel and many do, I would not be offended or put off in any way if they added a fuel surcharge to my trip. No one can absorb the doubling of an expense without an increase in income to help offset. I know that many of us are on a tight budget with all of the sudden increase in everything we need and or want. The cost of just driving to Canada is going to sting and probably thin the herd for some guys headed north. I don't like the idea of not going so having to dig a little deeper for fuel is going to have to happen or just bail out on the trip. I don't have a lot of trips left in me so bailing out isn't on my radar. I don't want to be sitting in a nursing home one day and regretting skipping a trip over the extra costs. Sorry for the rambling. Just thinking out loud. Pooch"
