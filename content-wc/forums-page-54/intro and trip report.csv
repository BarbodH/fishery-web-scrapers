6638248,Mojo-NC,2022-03-07 09:13:00,1929,Another 9 year old post revived. The website in the original link is for sale so I suspect the fishing show idea might not have panned out too well.
6638250,Bakefish,2022-03-07 09:21:00,1077,Ha. You mean I finally get off my butt and respond to a post and it's 9 years old? Figures.

We went up June 1st and got into some sweet walleye and pike fishing. I made a pdf photo essay of the trip http://fishinginthewild.com/pdf/Fish...enture2013.pdf Hope you enjoy, Cheers, Jonesy P.S. Me and my buddy also made a video of our trip there. Can't wait till next year.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaOcSwPxX74"

2087746,Sportdog,2013-09-06 22:14:00,6735,Welcome to the board. Great video and a great trip. I guess that my age is showing because I could live without the speaker breaking music and the Mike Iaconelli antics. Good video if you shut off the sound.
6638230,neelyang77,2022-03-07 07:19:00,1,Great video! Thanks for sharing!
6638236,RichA$1970,2022-03-07 08:10:00,1159,Nice video and agree on the music. Not sure if you have a longer one but 2 items I always like on videos are a camp tour and key tackle used.
