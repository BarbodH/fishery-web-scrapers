2574745,pwbmlr,2014-03-20 11:40:00,37,Anyone order their bait from the General Store wawa? Was wondering if I should order my worms from them or just buy them at home and repack them in bedding to bring accross the boarder. Also do they sell salted minnows? I really don't want to deal with keeping the minnows alive for the week or the extra weight.

2575177,Tylumps,2014-03-20 13:39:00,73,"Hello, I have used them for crawlers in the past. Good quality. Nice People. Here is their email and they will respond quick on your salted minnow question or if you want to place an order.[email protected] We don't get our worms from them only because crawlers are cheaper here in Michigan and we like to pack in paper bedding.

2575257,forgop,2014-03-20 14:14:00,880,I'll be flying out of Wawa on my trip in August. Would this be a good place to stop to get a flat of worms and beer?
2576153,Tylumps,2014-03-20 17:22:00,73,"When you buy beer in Canada you can either get it at the Duty Free stores at the border or ""The Beer Store"". Not kidding about the beer store. That's what it is called and yes they have one in Wawa. My reccomendation is buy beer in the States. Keep the receipts handy when you cross over because if you have more than (1) 24 pack of beer per person you may have to pay duty. Buying beer in the US and paying the duty is by far the least expensive way to go. If you want convienence, the Beer Store has got all Canadian beer you could imagine. Yes a flat of worms can be reserved and purchased at The General Store. Use the contact info in this thread to reserve your flat. Where ya going by the way?"
2577569,gonefishing13,2014-03-21 07:18:00,46,What are the prices for a flat of worms and/or minnows there? I'll be staying the night there before flying out using Hawk Air end of June.
2580889,danforth,2014-03-22 00:51:00,117,"I have bought flats of worms there in the past, when I got them a few years back they were around $55 a flat, I think there is 500 crawlers in a flat, they were very nice and were packed well. Just a note about it, when I asked about it at the store it was recommended that you call about a week before you come and order a flat and they will put your name on one because they only get a set amount. when they are gone your out of luck on the flats and you have to buy them in smaller amounts."
