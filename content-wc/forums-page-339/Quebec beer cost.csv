2554545,tv4fish,2014-03-14 13:33:00,2694,"Maybe this is similar to the differences in the pop or ""soda"" also between the U.S. and Canada -- I'll never forget the first whisky/7-Up I had in Canada (OK - up there ""Rye""/7-UP). Wow - was that drink ever sweet............."
2554993,FrankLeigh,2014-03-14 16:30:00,80,"Beer in Quebec costs less than it does in Ontario, because of different provincial tax structures, just as pricing in the US varies from state to state. However, even prices in Quebec are higher than, say, New York State.Having said that, for anyone crossing the border at Buffalo or Niagara Falls, I would be happy to exchange Canadian Blue for Yeungling or Sam Adams. FrankLeigh"
2556082,F250,2014-03-15 04:51:00,75,"If you buy your beer at a ""duty free"" store in Vermont, just before the PQ border (I-89 or I-91) you can get Canadian beer for less than $20.00 per case of 24."
2556290,octanehi5,2014-03-15 06:55:00,1104,"Aaron-in If you take a blue made here in the US and taste test with a real bleue,side by side If you can not taste the differance,your taste buds are shot.US has many laws in place that say you have to make beer a certain way. Example Tequila most of which is made in mexico to come to be sold in the states it has to be 40% alcohol or 80 proof to be sold here in the US In mexico, You can buy Tequila that has 38% alcohol 76 proof you can not buy in the US,because of these laws, The lower proof Tequila tastes much better than any tequila we can get here in the US. Whats in your Head, You should do alittle research,before you open your mouth and incert your foot. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."
2556378,Freytown,2014-03-15 07:30:00,770,What a minute...Anyone who would put Yeungling and Sam Adams on the same level has a taste bud issue. Just sayin'
2562433,Aaron-IN,2014-03-17 06:43:00,500,"You might want to do a little more research there cowboy. I'm not going to argue with you though, just enjoy the beer!"
2551546,Freytown,2014-03-13 16:00:00,770,"Andre is correct. The average price was $25.95 in Quebec, and $35.56 in Ontario.http://www.theglobeandmail.com/repor...ticle13756022/http://magasin.iga.net/Browse/Beeran...=en-CA&ct=true"
2552194,dmb130,2014-03-13 19:21:00,21,"In Ontario there is a provincial alcohol mark up. This is really just a tax that is not found in Quebec. In Que a 60 pack of cans runs around 55.00 plus taxs, in ontario it runs closer to 75.00."
2552330,JAY221,2014-03-13 20:01:00,877,"I agree it is just a hazard of living in an area that is visited by tourists. I wish that more tourists were going up to help the economy out. Later, Jay"
2552410,Mike Borger,2014-03-13 20:16:00,1554,"Beer in Quebec is way cheaper than Ontario. There is no Beer Store in Quebec, you can buy it at every corner gas station.My camp is near Rouyn Noranda and I alwats stock up when I'm there. There's always some on sale if you look around and it's minimum half the price compared to ON, oftentimes even less."
2552977,octanehi5,2014-03-14 06:03:00,1104,Its very expencive on the lake if you run out on a fly in $60 a case for da Blue
2553081,Shellback,2014-03-14 06:23:00,8083,Is there any penalty for an Ontario resident bringing beer in from Quebec?
2553289,ohiojmj,2014-03-14 07:25:00,1262,"I bring my $18 cases of Labatt Blue from Ohio to Canada, go figure. Although, I'd like to lighten the load and pick up pop/beer/water enroute to Remigny Quebec, but hard to find stores in small town lake Notre-Dame-du-Nord and good beer prices. General store in Remigny has high beer prices as I recall."
2553753,octanehi5,2014-03-14 09:31:00,1104,"The Labatts, you buy in the states is not the same as the ones you buy in Canada."
2554217,Aaron-IN,2014-03-14 11:32:00,500,"I've heard people say this for several years and have to raise the BS flag. I think the reason most people state this is that they see a different alcohol content on the cans/bottles. That's really not accurate in itself in that the alcohol contents were measured differently in the US compared to Canada (not sure if that is still the case but it was for a long time) but when it comes down to it its the same.....the same......the same. People that think it taste different, well, it's in your head."
2554361,Mike Borger,2014-03-14 12:08:00,1554,"Maybe, maybe not.Labatt USA is a completely separate company from Labatt Canada which is owned by Interbrew.US Labatt's is owned by North American Breweries of Rochester and is brewed solely in the States to their standards.Those standards may be the same, but if I had to bet I'd guess they're not."
2549482,Ferrispata,2014-03-13 06:46:00,63,"For those that buy their beer in Quebec, what is the typical cost of a case of beer in Quebec? Something basic like labatt or molson. Thanks in advance. Jerry"
2549786,Andre (wallyandre),2014-03-13 08:02:00,2274,Around 27-29$ in bottles + consignementQuite often they on sales at 25$ specially in summer.
2550186,SinOrSwim,2014-03-13 09:14:00,1528,Really? Anytime we go it's in the $40+ range for a case of beer?
2550258,retire55,2014-03-13 09:33:00,1029,"Here's a reference to prices of beer in cans and in bottles in Aylmer, Quebec - see http://www.depanneurrapido.com/promotions.php"
2550514,tv4fish,2014-03-13 10:25:00,2694,That is exactly what we have found the cost to be in Ontario (Why would it be that much cheaper in Quebec?) -- $24/case?
2551265,JAY221,2014-03-13 14:35:00,877,"In western Ontario you get the tourist pricing. Just a guess, no offence intended. Later, Jay"
2551289,tv4fish,2014-03-13 14:41:00,2694,"Jay: As far as I know the ""locals"" pay the same price at the Beer store, just like we tourists do........"
2551433,Shellback,2014-03-13 15:09:00,8083,Pretty sure beer is cheaper in Quebec. I know my Ontario friend likes to pick up some beer when he's in Quebec.
2551474,Aaron-IN,2014-03-13 15:36:00,500,My guess would be taxes. Quebec might as well be a different country than Ontario anyway so I'm not surprised the beer prices vary.
2551482,Andre (wallyandre),2014-03-13 15:39:00,2274,Just bought one/24 for 29.50 + $2.50 for consignement and I'm drinking one right one.
