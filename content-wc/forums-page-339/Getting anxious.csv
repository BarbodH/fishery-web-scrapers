2576929,kjames,2014-03-20 21:38:00,40,While our trip is still a few months away....dang I am stoked. In all reality its only a couple busy weekends of honey dues right

2577345,MN_Moose,2014-03-21 05:56:00,964,I find myself studying the contour maps on Navionicshttp://www.navionics.com/en/webapp
2577409,kjames,2014-03-21 06:31:00,40,Good idea
2578561,The Donger,2014-03-21 11:26:00,48,"Yup. Went through the tackle box again yesterday and the jointed black and silver Rapala was missing. Gotta find that. Sharpened my filet knife again on Tuesday and cut my finger again while doing it. This will surprise absolutely no one who knows me. Sending daily ridiculous emails to the fishing crew with dumb menu suggestions and scathing insults. Good idea there. Need to keep doing that one. Especially the insults. Yup, getting a bit antsy for the fishing trip."

2579169,pjshorthorn,2014-03-21 14:32:00,5654,"Have ya ever filleted your finger instead of the fish because the fillet glove was on the hand holding the knife????? Don't ask how I know, but somehow I think the left brain felt like there would be a much better grip on that knife with the fillet glove. Apparently the right brain got ate up with dumb dumbs.....at that particular moment..... PjShorthorn"
