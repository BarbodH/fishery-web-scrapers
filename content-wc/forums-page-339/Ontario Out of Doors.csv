I've read just about every one of your trip reviews on this site, and the photography and narratives rivals anything I've read.Even though I pay a premium for this magazine living in the states, it is my favorite magazine next to the Boundary Waters Journal. Keep up the good work!"

2564513,polaris-pete,2014-03-17 16:53:00,343,Yes Mike is a great help to us all if youre interested in fishing in Ontario.He has a contest going in the magazine to win a fishing trip with him but us Americanos are not eligible to enter or win.For this I am going to proclaim all Walmarts and Shopping malls here in Niagara Falls off limits to the Canadians!! LOL!
2564569,Mike Borger,2014-03-17 17:06:00,1554,Thanks Pete! Next year I'll be running the contest through my own company and it'll be open to everyone.At the moment I'm working on something really big. Right now it's looking like it might be a trip to a 5 star camp in the NWT. Here's hoping!

You bring a professional yet refreshing personal level of reflection to your stories that has been missing in far too many ""outdoor writings"". Your down to earth style is appreciated by grassroots fisherman. Reading your stuff makes me long for another trip to the great shield lakes rather than entering a one dimensional argument about braid vs mono. Heres to hoping for continued commercial success without becoming a commercial. You certainly seem to be getting off on the right foot."
