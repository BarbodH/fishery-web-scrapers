2579265,prov1800,2014-03-21 14:56:00,5010,"Well said ernier, so true."
2579377,tooski,2014-03-21 15:29:00,393,"Mr. Fart, I took European worms a couple years back. I can tell you that you are not going to be able to feed them and make them larger. The only way to increase their size is with a worm blower...They are a bit easier in that they don't require refrigeration. We went back to crawlers."
2571129,oldfart,2014-03-19 12:41:00,21,"Anyone used ""European"" Crawlers from Speedy Worm for tipping jigs?? At 2-3"" long, they would save on cutting up large crawlers, and they say they handle the heat better."
2571153,tv4fish,2014-03-19 13:13:00,2694,"I also would be interested in knowing if anyone has used them? I wonder how they compare in ""diameter"" to a ""regular"" or Canadian crawler, however. I see they ARE shorter, but I would also guess that they are smaller in dia. ??"
2573809,zeebee,2014-03-20 08:32:00,1144,"The ones from Africa are said to be the longest while those from the Orient lack length and girth. On the other hand Ive heard it said, ""it aint the meat...its the motion"".In any case, I can say with some conviction and, 1st hand experience, that the Cdn version gets the job done."
2573881,tv4fish,2014-03-20 08:44:00,2694,"We ARE still talking about nightcrawlers, right ?????????"
2573929,zeebee,2014-03-20 08:54:00,1144,"Yes...yes .....they do tend to crawl around at night.... 'tiss daylight in Perth however. To continue .... European crawlers historically seek middle ground..they are known for sitting on the fence. Achieving neither size, nor girth nor much of anything, they stubbornly cling to and relish in their ancestral accomplishments. Given they were the only ancestors, it aint necessarily sayin much. Hand em some warm bedding and they will continue to behave predictably. Theres my discourse 'bout worms....and now back to the 6 o'Clock news."
2574921,MikeinMN,2014-03-20 12:25:00,190,"I did buy some of these worms from this company. They are not what I would call nightcrawlers, I guess I would call them garden worms. They are IMHO a little too small to be used for walleye bait, but would probably make a really good panfish or trout bait. The company was excellent to deal with. I told them the worms were too small to use for walleye, and even though they claimed many people use them for walleye fishing, they still sent me a full refund and had me keep the worms as I was not personally satisfied with their product. They are also shipped fast and well packaged."
2574945,oldfart,2014-03-20 12:29:00,21,Thanks for the info
2574953,oldfart,2014-03-20 12:33:00,21,I may try ordering a week or 2 early and grow them a little-any thoughts?????
2575129,tv4fish,2014-03-20 13:21:00,2694,"Just a FWIW: I also was very impressed with the customer service from Speedy Worms - I bought a flat of Canadian nightcrawlers from them last year - the quality and consistency was far better than what we were used too - all nice and large/fat crawlers. Yes, zeebee CANADIAN crawlers (and, they DID get the job done)..............."
