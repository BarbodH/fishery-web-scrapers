2552841,Pooch,2014-03-14 03:52:00,4619,It's time to drop the penny in the USA. I like the rounding up or down as Canada has been doing the past year or so.Few people will even bother to bend over and pick one up off the ground anymore. Except maybe us older folks.Every year the local bank gives me a bunch of foreign coins that the coin sorter pulls out. There are some very weird coins in this world. I then give them to some of the young students for their coin collections. I do keep the Canadian coins though! Get a couple bucks a year for my effort. Includes Canadian pennies.Pooch
2119778,dollure,2013-09-22 13:55:00,71,Have several Canadian $1.00 bills. Are they still spendable? Roy
2120138,oldccm,2013-09-22 15:58:00,109,"Pennies, dollar bills and 2 dollar bills are still legal money. Some places stopped accepting pennies to sort of stop circulation but legally they would have to accept them push come to shove. It's just a bit of a learning curve. Best thing would be to roll them or just pop into a bank with all your change and get bills and start collecting change all over again."
2125698,lcwhit,2013-09-24 17:03:00,104,I own a business in central Illinois and regularly get Canadian pennies. I just pass them on. no problems so far.
2125874,NMG,2013-09-24 18:37:00,1053,"I visited Kansas one year and when buying some stuff at Walmart, I had a teller pick out a single Canadian penny from the cash I gave her (with disgust I might add) and tell me I had to find an ""appropriate US currency substitute"".I think everyone within 20 feet all looked at this lady like she was from Neptune, LOL."
2125890,NMG,2013-09-24 18:41:00,1053,"Here's the info straight from the mint:http://www.mint.ca/store/mint/learn/...2#.UkIwbhbSH8E ""Moreover, pennies can still be used in cash transactions indefinitely with businesses that choose to accept them"" I think your best bet is to change them out at a bank as most businesses I frequent are no longer accepting them . . ."

2126018,Smallmouth Hunter,2013-09-24 19:48:00,84,I work in a retail store. We took a Canadian penny the other day and didnt realize it. I am from the U.S. by the way. We put it in our nightly deposit and be bank called the next morning refusing to take it. Had to take the bank another penny to replace it. First time that has ever happened to me.
2126746,Bakefish,2013-09-25 08:00:00,1077,"I wonder how much that penny replacement cost each of the businesses involved.A smart bank manager would've reached into his pocket, retrieved a penny and replaced that Canadian one. But no one ever accused banks of being smart."
2552761,avmath,2014-03-13 23:02:00,2,"Because of what happen to Canadian penny, US financial experts are also considering eliminating penny in US. Some forecast it will save the nation $11 million a year."
2552833,Juls,2014-03-14 03:34:00,13414,"You can use them as flooring in your home, or as a splash guard in the kitchen, or even walls.....http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=...B3&FORM=IQFRBA"
2113418,Guest,2013-09-19 10:12:00,0,"Over the years of going to Canada and spending money there and getting Canadian change in return, I have accumulated quite a pile of coins. Each time we go back north, I take my cottage cheese container of Canadian coins to use wherever we can to keep the money circulating. The past Labor Day, we were in Sault Ste. Marie for the day so that we could walk the Mackinac bridge on Monday. To my surprise, the clerk in some stores said they don't take pennies anymore. So what is everyone doing with their leftover pennies?"
2113466,Wawajake,2013-09-19 10:30:00,413,Pennies are still legal tender at the banks so you can redeem their value at Canadian banks if you want. But I am not sure how many years before they will stop that too. They were costing more to make than they were worth so our Government discontinued them earlier this year. The cashiers just round up or down depending on your purchase outcome.
2113586,bigwalleye1,2013-09-19 11:22:00,2632,"I use two every trip as my token offering to Neptune upon departure from the dock on the first day of the trip, in offering for safe passage on the water. I hope I never run out..."
2115162,Fisherman1792,2013-09-20 05:41:00,927,"As far as I know, businesses are still suppose to take them if you can use them. I was told that as well but still used them. Fisherman 1792"
2115178,Shellback,2013-09-20 05:47:00,8083,"That's what I thought too. Businesses should take them, but not give change with them. The idea is to get them out of circulation."
2115234,Fisherman1792,2013-09-20 06:26:00,927,"Exactly, if you pay by debit they will round up/down but with cash they have to take them. Fisherman 1792"
2116018,SinOrSwim,2013-09-20 12:21:00,1528,How many pennies can you possibly have that it would make a huge difference? Just curious.
2119050,Guest,2013-09-22 06:06:00,0,I have a large Cool Whip container full. Maybe I should melt them down. Problem is: how do i separate the alloys from each other?
2119114,dmb130,2013-09-22 06:59:00,21,I think it would cost more to melt them down than it would be worth!
2119762,kzoofisher,2013-09-22 13:36:00,5144,"Keep 10 in your pocket and use them in the States, nobody is going to refuse taking a few pennies. Heck, 90% of cashiers probably won't even notice. Or stop at a Canadian bank and exchange them all."
