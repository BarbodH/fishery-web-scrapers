2559425,elway12,2014-03-16 08:11:00,335,Being from way out here in the West(AZ) we have always wanted to and looked into flying into IF or Thunder Bay etc. to try to save time. Yet we always ended up seeing that it would be way too expensive and didn't save much time. Rental cars and flights into and from places like IF and Thunder Bay are most times really high. Plus the timing of flights out of MSP most times waste alot of time for it to be a time saving opportunity. Plus baggage fees and restrictions.
2562417,Aaron-IN,2014-03-17 06:40:00,500,"I would also suggest Winnipeg instead of IF, I've done both several times over the years."
2562569,poultryman,2014-03-17 07:36:00,183,"To save 10 hours, its not worth it to me to fly to IF. Flying from Baltimore it was still about an 8 hour process to get to IF. For me and my son, flying round trip and bringing gear was close to $1200 three years ago. Its about a 24 hour drive for me from Baltimore to Kenora. It was worth it not to drive that year, but Ive driven the last couple of years. The drive isnt bad."
2563473,Guest,2014-03-17 12:06:00,0,"Oh no no no! Avoid Winnipeg or Thunder Bay. Just avoid flying into a Canadian Airport. As soon as you fly over the border, it will be way more expensive. Way more taxes on your ticket. and immigration fees. Fly to I Falls for sure! It's also a much longer drive from Winnipeg to Sioux Lookout. It's only 3 1/2 from I Falls to Sioux. Renting a car in I Falls will be cheaper too. Same with car fuel. Just my 2 bits from past knowledge."
2563513,SinOrSwim,2014-03-17 12:10:00,1528,"I looked at chartering a plane to I Falls from Ankeny Iowa a few years back. The drive back is a LONG one. But, the cost of chartering a flight locally for up and back was CRAZY expensive. LOL Like 9 grand round trip. And, that was if there were no delays.I also looked at a fligh last year for an emergency as I had my 4 year old in the hospital. It was going to run around 3 grand and I was going to get back about 4 or 5 hours sooner than I normall would. Ended up driving back on our normal schedule and he was out of hte hospital by the time I got back."
2563673,Aaron-IN,2014-03-17 13:09:00,500,"I guess it depends on where you are going and from where. I've flown probably 15 times over the years and it was always cheaper to fly directly from Indianapolis to Winnipeg then it was from Indianapolis to IF. Not only is it cheaper but it is WAY easier going through customs at the Winnipeg airport than it is via IF, not nearly the amount of traffic either. Winnipeg to Minaki (which is where the cabin is) is only 3 1/2 hours from Winnipeg, same distance/time from IFs. Car rental is not an issue via Winnipeg either, you won't save any $$ renting in IF. Gas is cheaper in the US, I will give you that."
2563689,Aaron-IN,2014-03-17 13:17:00,500,"Just checked flights from Indy to Winnipeg, $409, Indy to IF, $603. This is from 6/13-6/20, this is pretty much been my experience since flying up there. Just my experience flying from Indy."
2563697,BrianinVA,2014-03-17 13:20:00,160,"If OP is fishing the western part of Lac Seul the drive will likely be shorter from Winnipeg than from INL once he border crossing is taken into consideration. Fishing the eastern part of Lac Seul, drive time from INL is comparable to drive time from Thunder Bay. Might have missed it but in a previous post I mentioned we are flying from Washington (IAD) to YQT in June for $350 inclusive of taxes. Flights to INL for the same time frame are almost twice as much! Rental cars from Thunder Bay are also much cheaper. There is no airline or car rental competition in International Falls so prices get jacked."
2564329,BrianinVA,2014-03-17 16:09:00,160,"It sounds like we travel about the same distance. When we factor in fuel, vehicle wear & tear, depreciation, meals, extra nights accommodation and using up an extra vacation day for the drive, we figure we actually save money by flying and renting a car. I suppose we could drive straight through to save a vacation day and avoid an extra night's stay, but I'd rather arrive rested rather than having just pulled an all nighter."
2564913,poultryman,2014-03-17 18:49:00,183,My family and fishing buddy live in Chicago so its a convenient halfway stopping point for me. The hard part is bringing tackle boxes and fishing rods on the plane. Much easier to drive with all that stuff.
2558066,Marble-I,2014-03-15 16:37:00,1,"Headed to Lac Seul this summer and bringing my father. Thinking of flying to International Falls, renting a car, and driving from there to the all inclusive resort. This would save 10 hours of driving time, but would limit what we packed. Anybody ever done this? My dad would fish with the resort's gear, but I like my own stuff. Trouble is all my rods are one piece. I found a place in International Falls where you can mail your gear and pick it up, or I could get some new 2 piece rods and pack light. Thoughts?"
2558074,JAY221,2014-03-15 16:39:00,877,"How about checking with the lodge you are going to & see if you can send some stuff there plenty early so that it arrives in time? Later, Jay"
2558178,packpro,2014-03-15 17:27:00,695,"We flew to IF on our first trip, and we have had some fellas fly into there from out west. We just picked them up on our way through. It is more expensive to do it now considering that most of the airlines charge for checked baggage. You will have at least 2 pieces and possibly three.Back then there was no charge for checked baggage. The other expense is your rental car. The rental period will be for 6-7 days, but you are only going to use it to drive up, leave it sit, and then drive back. The time savings may not be as much as you think. To get to Int'l Falls you have to fly to Minneapolis first and then connect. If I remember, there was plenty of time between connecting flights. When you consider the two flights and the waiting time, your total airport time may be 5-6 hours. The flight to IF is on a prop puddle jumper. We flew through a storm and bounced all over. My partner does not fly very well. I am sure there are still claw marks in the arm rest.As for your rods. If you own a good rod carrier, you'll be fine. The airport at IF is used to handling that kind of luggage. It just shows up at the oversize baggage area."
2558210,BrianinVA,2014-03-15 17:44:00,160,"If you invest in pack rods and are an efficient packer you could probably get away with one checked bag. I've flown into International Falls for a week of fishing, checking a large backpack that contained 2 poles, tackle, fish finder, life jacket, toiletries and shoes. Carried on my clothing in a small backpack. There are only two flights a day to INL, both on Delta connecting through MSP. It's a fun flight as almost everyone is going fishing so be prepared for lots of fish stories and overhead bins full of poles. If you have Delta miles I've found INL to be one of the better domestic redemption values as the flights during the summer are normally very expensive. Also, I think there is only one rental car company in International Falls so expect to get hosed a bit. Might want to consider flying into Winnipeg or even Thunder Bay as the flights, and rental cars, might be cheaper and you won't have to worry about the border crossing. We are flying from Washington DC to Thunder Bay in June for $350. Flights to INL for the same time frame were ~$650."
2558266,Larry S,2014-03-15 18:13:00,665,"I have flown from Las Vegas to Minneapolis and Duluth . All my rods are 2 piece and fit into my duffle bag where my gear is packed. I rubber band them together and wrap them in bubble wrap. Have never had a problem This year 2 or 3 of the guys I go with on a fly-in are flying to Thunder Bay. Its more expensive, but their other friend drives up from Pittsburgh with all their gear and has meet them in the past in Minneapolis and will now meet them in Thunder Bay"
2558506,btyreprich,2014-03-15 19:45:00,1067,Consider flying into Winnipeg and see if there is a bus that will take you to Kenora or Eagle River. From there the lodge owner should be able to make final transportation arrangements to get you to the lodge. This approach might be cheaper than renting a car that will not be used for several days.
2558601,fishanytime,2014-03-15 20:34:00,63,My daughter planned on meeting me in IF three years ago. The connecting flight from MLPS was 8 hours late and her flight leaving IF was 7-8 hours delayed. It was not an enjoyable trip for either of us. We would not fly into the Falls again after that experience.
2558633,Retired GB Guy,2014-03-15 20:38:00,25,"I would drive, pack what I want, and spent 10 hrs each way talking past fishing trips and this fishing trip. Yup if my dad was still alive that's what I would do."
2559097,Skywagon,2014-03-16 05:59:00,1106,"I fly out of, or into I Falls on occasion, but any more for the most part, find it is a lot easier/cheaper (almost as fast) to just drive. When you consider the time involved to go to your local airport, check in, go through security, wait, then fly to MSP, wait, transfer, pick up a rental car, pick up your fishing rods from the mail box place... After all of that, calculate the time it will take and expense it has cost. My solution is to get an audio book, stick it in the CD player and the next thing you know, you are there. My usual drive is 14-15 hours one way, some audio books will almost last the entire trip. And if some think a puddle jumper is a horrible experience, I would guess a fly-in-outpost cabin experience would not be for you."
2559121,LLewellin,2014-03-16 06:14:00,1790,Instead of IFalls think about flying into Bemidji. Very easy and fast airport to work with and they have regional JETS that are very nice to fly in. Bemidji is only about 1-2 hours south of IFalls. .02$
