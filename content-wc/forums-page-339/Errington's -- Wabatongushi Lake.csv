2550418,jfaisten,2014-03-13 10:00:00,1060,Looking at a week at Errington's on Wabatongushi Lake in Northern Ontario this spring. Looks like a decent lodge -- anyone have first hand experience? Thanks

The fishing was pretty good, not great. It was our first time on the lake, and we only had a few days so we fished hard each day and averaged about 20 fish per person (mixed walleyes and northerns) but nothing really big, just your standard 15-17 inch walleye and bunch of hammer handle pike. The camp/cabins and equipment are all very good. We cooked for ourselves but almost everyone we spoke to at the lodge couldn't stop raving about how good the food was for those who booked the American plan. We plan on going back sometime but probably not this year.Good luck,1-shot"
