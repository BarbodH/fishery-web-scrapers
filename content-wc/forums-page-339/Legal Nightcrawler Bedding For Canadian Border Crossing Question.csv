2579137,phishfearme,2014-03-21 14:28:00,1242,"yes it does - we've been using it for years - as a matter of fact, most all commercial bedding is made from newspapers with the ink dissolved out. phish"
2579177,pjshorthorn,2014-03-21 14:36:00,5654,How do the crawlers read the news then? PjShorthorn
2579185,Sportdog,2014-03-21 14:36:00,6735,How do you dissolve the ink out? Wash the heck out of it like in a bucket of water after you shred it? I have some commercial worm bedding that almost has the texture of cellulose insulation. Is that paper bedding do you think?

2579521,phishfearme,2014-03-21 16:07:00,1242,"we have a bunch of commodians on this site - actually to make them Canadian crawlers use Canadian newspapers, eh? and, since they actually eat the paper use the Toronto Daily Digest. I don't bother with soaking out the ink although LOTS comes out anyway (must be water soluble) and the water that is squeezed out of the freshly ground bedding is quite black. make sure you only use the newspaper paper not the colored ads. I soak the paper (keeping the ""open end"" up to allow the air to come out and water to soak in - maybe even over night. then run it thru a wood chipper - maybe twice. then hand squeeze out the water and let it dry in the sun. the crawlers need some roughage in their diet so I add some crushed limestone to the mix. keep them in the fridge at all times! if you're gonna keep them in this bedding for some time, sprinkle some moist corn meal on top - they'll come up to get eat it. phish"
