2552657,Mike Borger,2014-03-13 21:42:00,1554,"Never done it with walleye, but many, many times with trout.I butterfly fillet the fish (both sides joined together by the skin), hang it over a green branch over a good bed of coals. (That's coals, NOT flames! )Remove occasionally and baste with melted butter, honey and garlic."
2552825,Juls,2014-03-14 03:31:00,13414,"Bill, The link didn't take us anywhere specific. Mike B., He didn't say we could use any seasonings, so your yummy honey-garlic butter basting can't be used. Sounds delish though."

2554849,Bill Krejca,2014-03-14 15:07:00,6107,"Whoops! Sorry, thought this would have got to it. Try http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsCvcWy95gI Also, try just ponassing fish on Goggle. I tried it with a fresh caught catfish once, it works! I think trout species would come out the best, as it is more oily, and less likely to dry out. Bill"
2554881,Juls,2014-03-14 15:51:00,13414,Nice technique! I think I would have to learn which trees are toxic though. I would probably just pick up anything that was the right size.
2550634,MrSimon,2014-03-13 10:44:00,922,"If you only had a walleye, a fillet knife, and a camp fire ..... how would you cook it? I'm all about nice big shore lunches with gas cookers and fancy pans .... but I think it would be fun to do a ""survival style"" shore lunch sometime, just for the experience."
2550666,Juls,2014-03-13 10:48:00,13414,"I would find a long tapered stick that was skinny enough on one end to ""weave"" it through the raw fillet and then hold it over the fire like a hotdog. As long as you don't mess with it too much it shouldn't fall apart on you until you eat it.Or, just keep some aluminum foil in your boat and you can make aluminum ""packs"" to put the fillets in and steam them in the fire. But, that won't have any flavor.I'm assuming you don't have any spices or flavorings with you either?"
2550714,orchard frank,2014-03-13 10:56:00,1900,"Forgot the pans one time, was too far away from camp to go back. The old Boy Scout training kicked in, we found two forked sticks, and wove the filets between with some saplings, looked like a tennis racket kind of thing. Lots of ways to do a char-broil with tin foil on the coals, and have heard others who forgot pans using an empty bean can to boil fish chunks in a pinch. Luckily, the shore lunch setting will compensate for a few shortcomings in the recipe."
2550818,packpro,2014-03-13 11:35:00,695,"I would filet the fish out, but not into two fillets. I would leave the belly meat/skin intact. Do not skin the fillets. By leaving the belly attached to the two fillets you will be able to ""drape"" it over a stick for cooking. Properly cooked, the meat will pull away from the skin as you eat it."
2551337,SinOrSwim,2014-03-13 14:50:00,1528,"Clean the fish and leave the skin on. Put a rock in the fire. Flat rock would be good. Get it good and hot and put the fish on the rock, skin side down. Set the rock next to the fire. Would easily cook like that. Skin will keep the fish from falling apart. Go into the woods and pick some blueberries along with some seaside sandplant, fireweed, bittercress and arrowhead. Mush up for a spicy blueberry compote to put on the fish. You will be amazed!!!!(okay, I made up all of that! LOL I googled edible ontario plants. So, it ""could"" work but I have no idea what any of that is other than the blueberry)This fish part on a rock would work though. I watch Surviivorman!"
2551441,Juls,2014-03-13 15:17:00,13414,Genius... Definitely wouldn't have a problem finding rocks up there.
2551618,MN_Moose,2014-03-13 16:31:00,964,"easier than all that Fish on a stick. No cleaning, no filleting. Grab a green stick, shove in the fish mouth hold over fire until eyes cloud over. The skin will get dark. Pull off fire slice belly open and fold skin off to side. Sounds terrible but it works. All the guts suck up tight to the throat. The meat falls off the bones. Moist and tender. No clean up."
2551866,LOW1,2014-03-13 17:53:00,2828,"1. Build Fire. Put Three Rocks In Fire Until Very Hot2. Remove Boxers and Tie Knot in Leg Openings3. Using a Willow Switch, Make Loop Around Waist 4. Fill Boxers With Water and Add Walleye5. Drop Boiling Hot Rocks Into Water to Boil Walleye. Boxers Will Not Burn.6. Feed this Walleye To Partner Who Was Dumb Enough To Get You Stranded7.

2551978,ftfarms,2014-03-13 18:25:00,444,We've tried the fish on a stick over a open fire. It was a one time thing and never again. It wasn't terrible but not something I would ever eat again.
2552130,Bill Krejca,2014-03-13 19:11:00,6107,"The process that has been used with good results is termed ""ponassing"". It is usually best used with oily fish such as trout, but it can be used for about any fish. https://www.google.com/webhp?rct=j#q=pannassing+fish Bill"
