2548249,bigwalleye1,2014-03-12 18:58:00,2632,"What Ed said. Thank you, Tooski, and THANK YOU Vets!"
2548889,BuckeyeBill,2014-03-12 21:11:00,76,"Tooski, a big thumbs up to you and also the outfitters!! We have gone to a Lodge just east of Saulte Ste. Marie a number of times and met a great family there. The grandfather had started bringing his sons and then their families to this lodge over 25 years ago. About 6 years ago the grandfather was stricken with MS and has been in a wheelchair ever since. They still come every year and take great pains to make sure grandpa has a great time. He fishes just as hard as everyone else in camp. I love to spend the evenings talking to him as he is a wealth of info. Tooski, please let us know how the trip went. Can't wait to hear about it."
2551018,jambi,2014-03-13 12:55:00,504,Thank You Vets and Thank you Tooski. We look forward to hearing about this trip. Safe travels and have a great time.
2562162,Guest,2014-03-17 02:14:00,0,"Correct you are Dave. A couple of years ago, our group flew into Miniss Lake with Hidden Bay Lodge. One of the guys in our group was a Chicago Fire Fighter who lost the use of his leg battling a blaze. When the folks at Hidden Bay met our friend when we arrived, they said his trip was on the house and thanked him for his dedication and service. Never expected that at all! Double thumbs up for Hidden Bay. We will be back soon! Sam"
2546793,tooski,2014-03-12 13:34:00,393,This August I am taking two disabled vets on a fly-in trip to western Ontario. One is wheelchair bound and the other lost an eye. I would like to thank Eddie North for his offer of a free trip to Beteau for the soldiers. Unfortunately his trips are seven days and the social workers preferred the trip not be longer than 4 days plus driving. Dwayne at Thousand Lake Outfitters also offered a tremendous deal but we couldn't get the dates worked out. Bob (phishfearme) gave me a ton of help and advice for the trip so I am also mentioning his name. We eventually settled on Hidden Bay lodge's Gage Lake outpost. Hidden Bay also is letting the vets fly free. Just thought it would be nice to post some good news as I stare out the window at another snowstorm.. I'll post a report (you're welcome Bob) on our return.... ....
2546937,Carnhzkr,2014-03-12 14:14:00,964,"That's awesome, Tooski. That's very generous of Eddie North, Thousand Lakes, and Hidden Bay to come through for the Vets, and very good of you for putting the trip together. What time of year are you going?"
2546969,tooski,2014-03-12 14:24:00,393,"Thanks. Labor of love as I toured Nam also... We are going Aug 3 - Aug 7th. Just felt the weather ""might"" be a little more stable then...Hidden said they have a family every year where the adult son is paralyzed and they will advise me on the problem of getting him in and out of the boat..."
2547345,grizzley,2014-03-12 15:51:00,2518,Good to hear that there are people willing to extend some generosity to disabled vets. They deserve every break they can get: THEY EARNED IT! to the outfitters you mentioned!
2547593,ifish267,2014-03-12 16:50:00,253,"Tooski, I know you didn't ask but if you pm me your address I would be glad to kick in a little for gas ,bait, meals or whatever. Jerry"
2547697,wallydave,2014-03-12 17:06:00,2151,"Tooski, good to hear of so many good people helping our vets! Id like to give these outfitters some of my business!"
2547849,Larry S,2014-03-12 18:03:00,665,Bravo Tooski for setting this trip up. As a Nam Vet I appreciate what you are doing for these vets. Its too bad the trip to thousand lakes didn't pan out. Phishfearme was looking forward to helping out and showing the vets a great trip. Will you accept donations to help with expenses? I would like to send you a donation. Larry S
2547857,tooski,2014-03-12 18:07:00,393,"Jerry, Thanks for the offer. I told Bob Kerr ( Phishfearme) we could probably get a substantial amount just by posting for donations. Tons of great people on this board. Truth is the local Amvets Post 55 and VFW post 8686 are contributing $2,000 which more than pays for their meals, gear, etc. PLus we are having a fundraiser to pay for the van rental. Thanks again Jerry."
2548001,Kansas Bound,2014-03-12 18:21:00,152,Wow news like this really makes my day! A big thank you to everyone involved.
2548073,bigwillies,2014-03-12 18:31:00,515,only two things to say.to all the vets THANK YOU! tooski and all outfitters involved. i wish there where a lot more people like u guys!
