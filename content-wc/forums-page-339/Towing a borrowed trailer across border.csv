2565481,JesterBreeze,2014-03-17 21:24:00,16,This year we are borrowing a trailer from a friend to haul everyones stuff up. What do I need to have with me in regards to the trailer? Will a notarized letter from the owner stating that he knows we are borrowing be all I need?

Always with a mix of people and trailers, often times the owner of trailers weren't on the trip. haven't ever been asked any questions. A couple times we've even been inspected and still never asked about trailer. that being said, it's probably not a bad idea to have paperwork."

Your biggest thing is make sure nobody in your group has a criminal history and no dui, Dui is a felony in Canada, that person will be coming back and you will be going on without them."
