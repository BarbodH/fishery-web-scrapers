We were up there right when they started tearing it apart and and it was a muddy, rocky mess. Hopefully the crew that was working on it was NOT the same crew that works on the bridge by Frog Rapids. That ""to be completed by"" sign by the bridge that expired 3 years prior was always entertaining."
2561025,pjshorthorn,2014-03-16 15:54:00,5654,Hwy 516 from Sioux Lookout to Deception landing is in nice shape as of last September when I launched from there last year. The bridge work over Frog Rapids on Hwy 72 was completed in 2011 or thereabouts. PjShorthorn

2569273,jimmie,2014-03-19 00:10:00,123,you may have noticed that their equivalent to class 5 is not dusty and it does not take them 6 months to pave two miles like where I live this was1/2 mile eacjh day and that iis after they had to redo a couple of miles because rain washed it out! They started in June and were done in August upon my second trip up and a very smooth ride newly paved. I am still finding the dirt (slime) on parts of my motor and boat from time to time. Still worth the wait in line and the muddy mess all over everything. There are worse things in life. Remember not that long ago there was no 502 and about 50 years ago 17/11 along LOW was not paved all the way to Dogtooth Lake and the length has been shortened by several miles. 72 was all gravel about 20 years ago! So let's count our lucky stars!! See you at the landing end of June!
