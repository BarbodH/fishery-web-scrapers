2578497,cuamb,2014-03-21 11:17:00,203,Take a look at these footlockers if you don't want to build one. Not sure what size you can accomodate but they are pretty well made.http://www.everythingsummercamp.com/camp-trunks
2548849,NARDA 1,2014-03-12 21:06:00,636,"Have you tried ebay? I found this, just did a search for wooden trunk.http://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Wood...item3cddebc253"
2548953,Gregking,2014-03-12 21:28:00,2658,I am going to make one that I can put my stadium seat on. All I need is the actual box sized right then a hole drilled for the clamp.
2549954,michigan walleye guy,2014-03-13 08:28:00,95,"Many thanks for all the great advice and suggestions. I found a couple of ammo boxes on e-bay, thanks to the advice of a few posters, and the Rubbermaid suggestion works too--thanks!!"
2551674,MN_Moose,2014-03-13 16:46:00,964,Our guide built his own as a prototype of one he planned to make of aluminum. 20 years and he still is yet to make the aluminum one.
2551898,Richard B,2014-03-13 17:58:00,735,Do you have the dimensions for that?
2552146,bfish,2014-03-13 19:15:00,1096,"If you are going wood, might as well add legs and use the door as a drop down work area. Google up ""boy scout kitchen box"" and you will lots of plans. Change the dimensions to fit your boat and kitchen supplies."
2559297,go dart,2014-03-16 07:41:00,77,"Heres one I made. I built around my skillet and used a center divider (hinged) to separate the cans and oil from the skillet. Used 5/8"" Baltic Plywood for strength but its very light. Weight becomes a major concern as a cast iron pan, bottle of oil, couple cans of beans start to add up. Layout everything you want in before building.https://scontent-a-dfw.xx.fbcdn.net/..._7364511_n.jpg"

2566857,NathanH,2014-03-18 10:43:00,697,Now thats a pile of fish!
2578457,wtw_fisherman,2014-03-21 11:08:00,13,"I use one of those square coolers(app. 2'x2'x2.5'). They have a places for drinks one top, some have wheels and a telescopic handle. Fry pans,oil, breading, paper plates,paper towel, tools all fit inside. We take out on the boat and find a place somewhere for lunch."
2546489,michigan walleye guy,2014-03-12 12:41:00,95,"Is there a reasonably priced wooden shore lunch box manufactured anywhere--one that would hold a 10 inch skillet, plates, small bottle of oil, couple cans of potatoes, salt/pepper, utensils, etc. I am looking for a wooden box with handles on the side and hinged top. My google search didn't help much. Would like to replace the plastic totes. Thanks for any help you can give!"
2547073,Skyraptor,2014-03-12 14:48:00,291,"I know they are a lot better then the plastic tubs and are hard to find but years ago I made my shore lunch box out of old US issue ammo box. It was the perfect size, had rope handles and all I needed to do was put on some hinges and a latch. Sometimes Fleet Farm has old military stuff or check out eBay as well."
2547089,LOW1,2014-03-12 14:54:00,2828,"It might be a fun project to make one out of plywood or tongue and grooved 1 x whatever. Put your interior dividers where you want them, use exterior grade screws/glue, get good hardware, etc.Burn your name in it and make it an heirloom."
2547129,Carnhzkr,2014-03-12 15:06:00,964,I'll bet you could pick up something like that at an Army / Navy surplus store.
2547409,camp chef,2014-03-12 16:07:00,915,"No judging .......Just wondering what you don't like about the plastic totes. We use them for everything on our boat in trips....Waterproof, stackable,cheap ,easy to handle"
2547561,michigan walleye guy,2014-03-12 16:42:00,95,"I have nothing against plastic totes, just kinda want something different. LIke somebody else posted, a well-made box would be a sort of a talisman, something to look at and sort through in the winter, and something that would might eventually have value to the guys who take my place."
2547601,camp chef,2014-03-12 16:51:00,915,Makes sense to me.We have a handcrafted cribbage board that will hopefully travel to Canada long after I am gone.
2547625,SinOrSwim,2014-03-12 16:54:00,1528,Holy Heavy though. Yikes. The tote is heavy enough to hauld back and forth. I can't imagine how heavy a wooden box would be?
2547713,@Lunker,2014-03-12 17:08:00,835,"I hear ya about the talisman thing but would also be concerned about the weight of the storage unit. Check out one of these....a bit less mainstream than a common, everyday plastic tote. Would suggest that the talisman part is somewhat mental and whatever you use could evoke all sorts of memories. Suggestion: every trip, log in the date and participant names on the box. We do that every year at deer camp on one of those blaze orange Miller Lite WELCOME HUNTER beer banners, after we take our annual group photo in front of it.
