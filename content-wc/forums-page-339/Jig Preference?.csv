This is my go to set up for Lac Seul in early may. I fished Lake Vermillion last June and all the fisherman's preference was bare jighead tipped with minnow. What do you guys do and is there a reason behind it? I always felt the grub has the flash and gets the walleyes attention and then when they come over and strike, the meat makes them hold on. We've noticed a significant difference of strikes with minnow/leech tipped compared to plastic grub only."
2574329,Woollybob,2014-03-20 10:12:00,158,"On Lac Seul I do either or, not both. Either gulp minnow (or twister) - primarily shallow early season weeds on a 1/4 oz jig. Live bait shallow I will use he 1/8 oz jig. Later/deeper I almost exclusively use a minnow on a 3/8 jig. Go heavier if needed for current or wind or depth."
2574585,oldfart,2014-03-20 11:00:00,21,"We've always tip with both a tail and minnow or crawler...have tried Gulp Alive, etc. with limited sucess...last year, I had a tail/Gulp Alive and my brother in the same boat had a tail/minnow-he outfished me 5-1 over 4 hours-went back to a minnow, and we were even. The outfitter told me that on some lakes, scented artificials just don't work. A Twister Tail alone will work well if they are really ""snapping"", but normally we do much better with both."
