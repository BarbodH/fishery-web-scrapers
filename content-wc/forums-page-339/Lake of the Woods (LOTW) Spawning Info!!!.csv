2560065,KM1,2014-03-16 10:56:00,374,"You do have a point....but...I am not asking them to tell me where the fish are during the time I am up there...THAT I want to figure out myself. I am asking where the main spawning areas are...that is all. Depending on ice out, weather, water temp, etc., this is going to occur (likely) sometime in April/May...long, long before we are up there. Fish will be long gone from these areas. So I believe asking where main spawning takes place to be quite different as all that does is give one a very small piece of a much, much larger puzzle.In fact...I don't even WANT to know where one's ""honey"" holes are or where THEY believe the fish ARE during June/July...that destroys the challenge...one of the most important reasons why I enjoy fishing walleye in the first place. Plus...where they are, in any given year or at any given time, can and does change (depending on conditions).I would not ask anyone to do something I wouldn't do myself. In fact...I have been known to take guests out, allowing them to follow me out in their boats, and I take them exactly where I would be fishing myself. Best areas included. I don't know...from my perspective...there is much more to fishing than just knowing where the fish are...you still have to be able to put them in the boat. But you are correct...most would be uncomfortable with giving up areas that hold great fish...but I am not one of those and I don't even want that information.And this is 100% accurate for me as well: ""best days on the water are when we search( on the water), find, and catch fish on our own"" and I am not sure how this statement relates to asking where main spawning areas are during a period that is literally 2 months before I will even be on the water???"
2560081,nervous knotter,2014-03-16 10:58:00,211,This is more information than I wanted to give but we noticed that we caught more 30+ fish when we had blueberry pancakes (between 1&2). After a few years we realized it was because we didn't get to our best spots until about 9:30 am.
2560201,KM1,2014-03-16 11:32:00,374,Seriously...LOL Love the sarcasm though!!! :-)
2560225,nervous knotter,2014-03-16 11:34:00,211,"Really?? And nobody will be fishing ""my spots"" next to the spawning areas the first weeks of the season ? Guiding guests to your spots is exactly why I wouldn't share this info with you. Sounds like you know how to fish pretty good and a very nice guy. I don't agree with giving up this kind of information on the internet because it puts too much pressure on the resource and my solitude."
2560713,KM1,2014-03-16 14:03:00,374,"However, guiding....helping...others who are having trouble finding fish by taking them to spots I personally have researched, found fish on, and caught fish on, is not the same as taking them or giving them spots that someone else has told me about (something I don't even ask for and don't really want). THAT I don't do, unless given permission to do so. I think the word one would use is called ""CHARACTER""...not my place to give someone else's spots. As you pointed out...the best spots are those one finds themselves through the research they do. Part of that research IS in finding out fish location from the spawn...whether one asks on a site like this (a place where there are other knowledgeable fisherman [some]), does so at the local bait store, from a friendly solid guide, or what have you. It is all part of the research that good fisherman do BEFORE they get on the water. Heck...I will likely not even put a line in the water my first day (maybe two) spending most of my time doing on the water research. And let me ask you a question??? You have NEVER asked, on any fishing trip, at THE local bait store, THE better resorts, from knowledgeable guides, or anyone else with possible information, about the fishery you are going to? Never asked ""has the spawn occurred yet?"", ""what are fish hitting on this week,"" ""what depth have fish been caught on this week...what about the larger fish?"", ""how have the guides been doing recently,"" ""who is the best guide in the area for numbers and size of fish,"" etc. It is all part of the LEARNING a body of water...and this is one BIG body of water. It stands to reason that one might do the same thing here...even be encouraged to do so.This is the first year I am using a computer program called ""Insight Planner"" from Lowrance. I would highly recommend it, along with Navionics+. The detail on the sonar maps is uncanny...and it is update-able. Even fisherman are helping correct any errors on current maps by adding to the database through the Navionics website. Yet...you do have a good point here: ""And nobody will be fishing ""my spots"" next to the spawning areas the first weeks of the season.""I actually didn't think of that globally. Hmm, I suppose that could be an issue and understand THAT concern. But if they are smart enough to figure out which primary points outside of major spawn areas are holding fish...they are probably smart enough to figure out main spawn areas while on the water.Also, LOTW is HUGE and I have never been up there where I could not find or did not have areas I fished (and that is in just the sections I have outlined) where I did not see another boat ALL DAY!!! In my opinion, LOTW is one of the best Walleye fisheries in North America...there are so, so many areas to fish that if one spot got over burdened...I could just go to another. However, I find the challenge of catching more and larger fish around 10 other boats an enjoyable thing to do...I even invite boats to come over and fish alongside me (as long as they are safe and give ample room).Nervous Knotter...let me back up a little. The reason I asked this question on this board in the first place (and remember I am only asking main spawning areas not fishing spots), is due to a Captain/Pro Angler-(I think) who I had asked the same question to privately...but was not knowledgeable regarding LOTW. She is a moderator here on WC and recommended I ask in the Canada section. That is the reason you are seeing my questions here...originally...I was doing this one on one.I tell you what...regardless of our differences of opinion on sharing ANY information...IF my fishing partner and I determine areas where we actually do consistently catch 26"" - 30+"" fish (many...not just one or two, something we have accomplished in the past)...I will be MORE than willing to give YOU the gps coordinates if you like. Love to know I possibly had a hand in helping someone else have a GREAT day on the water.Just sayin!!!"
2561193,nervous knotter,2014-03-16 16:46:00,211,"KM, thanks for the offer, we're good. Good luck on your trip this summer."
2561281,KM1,2014-03-16 17:10:00,374,"Thanks...best of luck to you as well...but based on our conversations...you won't need much luck as you sound like you know the area's you like to fish pretty well and have had good experiences with them. May a 35"" walleye grace your net!!!"
2567505,KM1,2014-03-18 13:59:00,374,"My partner is my brother...and he takes the ""game"" as serious as I do. Not many would be able to fish with me...to serious for most. If you read my last post...you will see that what I have done in the past is no where near what I might try to do in the future. The key word in that last sentence is TRY. I am well aware of it being unlikely...that's what makes it a challenge...and increases the ""fun"" for me. Man...this question about main spawning areas on LOTW in the Northern Section of the lake got all twisted into something completely unexpected. Geez!!!"
2567561,tv4fish,2014-03-18 14:09:00,2694,"I also have followed this thread and this is my take -- Kirk, it is quite obvious that you are not lacking in the ""self-confidence"" department, but I agree - if you are sincerely expecting ""80-100 big walleye"" days, I think you are going to be disappointed. However, that said, if/when it happens, please provide us with the details........."
2568425,KM1,2014-03-18 18:41:00,374,"Thanks for the friendly response. Let me clarify...I am not saying what I am looking for...several days with 26"" on up some beyond 30""...is what I EXPECT to happen (and no days without any fish)...that would be ridiculous. I am saying that I would like to work toward that end...whether it is this year, next, or in the future. I believe this fishery DOES have that possibility. I also believe that knowing the main spawning areas are one of many, many keys to, at least, trying to predict fish location through dispersal patterns into the main lake...especially this year when it is possible that we might have a late ice out and possibly a later than normal spawn. Of course that all could change based on other factors. If you define ""self-confidence"" as the willingness to work toward something difficult...yes...I am ""self-confident"" in that piece. tv4fish...I will be MORE than willing to share my experience this summer. In all likely hood...it will NOT be something that will be achieved (so in that sense...Mr. Fletcher might very well be accurate)....but better to work toward something people believe is unlikely rather than simply accept it as impossible. That has been my life experience in other areas."
2568561,FightDoctor,2014-03-18 19:32:00,1,I see people don't read very well on this sight. Kirk only asked for spawning sights that's it! Never did he ask for someones spots ever. So you can keep your snotty comments to yourself. If your not going to help another fisherman out so be it and mind your own business. Kirk will do just fine without your help thank you. From His Brother!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2568729,Rich B,2014-03-18 20:10:00,1081,"Welcome to Walleye Central.....personally I enjoyed reading your brother's posts and certainly understand his earlier questions and also his responses....it's been a long, long winter for many of us, and perhaps that along with a little cabin fever led to some of the other posts.I laughed when your brother noted that most guys wouldn't/couldn't fish with you guys, as you're both too serious for most fishermen....I have a twin brother, and most of our friends don't like fishing with us for the same reasons (ha). It's not that we don't enjoy our time on the water, but that we get after it and stay after it.....they'd sooner catch up with us off the water.Anyway, glad you joined WC.....best wishes to you and Kirk for a great time at LOTW this summer, and much success.Rich B"
2568897,tritonman,2014-03-18 20:54:00,229,The commercial fishing nets would be a good place to start. We usually get a few 27 inch fish and one 28 and. A 29 on a given day of fishing on the canada side of LOTW. In doing that we fish ten different spots on a twenty mile circle. We get board catching walleyes and switch to small mouth on the shallower humps or pitching the shore. If you want to catch the quality and number of fish you are looking for you need to be in the Great Lakes or at Lake Winnipeg ice fishing. We run reef runners on deep rock reefs and those fish are 25 or so typically.
2569129,KM1,2014-03-18 22:07:00,374,"One more thing Mr. Fletcher before I let this thing die. Why do you think that ""Most big fish, regardless of the time of year are caught in 10ft or less"" is true?For the most part...there are only two reasons those big (likely) females are caught more often in 10ft or less of water no matter the time of year.And I'm hoping, as a guide, that your answer isn't because that's where these big females spend most of their time during daylight hours.No need to answer...just a rhetorical question to ponder based on your last semi-smart alike response."
2569161,KM1,2014-03-18 22:16:00,374,"Hey...thanks for chiming in. Yes...I can see why you found that part about ""being serious"" funny. After picking up my boat this summer...the guys at work all wanted to go out for some fishing time....that is until they heard my expectations...which did not include parking the boat over some spot, drinking some beers, and shooting the breeze while we soak a couple crawlers or leeches. That is NOT my idea of a good time!!! LOL!!!"
2569905,Gunner_Fletch,2014-03-19 08:12:00,74,Yup.....lots of agreed and corrects here! I'll leave it at that. Have a good trip. And by the way....the fishing is better now than it was the last time you were.
2570961,KM1,2014-03-19 12:04:00,374,I appreciate the info on the improvement of the fishing on LOTW...hopefully that holds true for us. Somewhere along the line this post got all off track. Likely part of that was my over explanation on details that strayed from the subject. I tend to do that...as a former teacher (34 years) and coach...detailed explanations where part of the job. Also wishing you the very best season on the water and that your guests are ALL treated to awesome fishing. Could be a very interesting summer with this crazy winter we've had. What a NIGHTMARE!!! Best KM1
2565985,Gunner_Fletch,2014-03-18 06:48:00,74,"You're killin me! I find myself raising my eyebrow at some of your statements....and quite frankly, questioning if you really know what you're talking about?? On one hand you seem quite knowledgeable with regards to fishing walleye in general ( presentations, patterns, weather etc). Although, you do have a couple misconceptions about catching ""big walleye""..... in this body water. On the other hand.....if you think you can have as you say, an 80-100 fish days with the majority 26"" and several topping 30""........ I say it's a good to dream, but highly unlikely. You say you've had those days in the past.....then well done you! And if you have....why all the questions? Lol. You obviously have it figured out! Also, if you're as knowledgeable as I think you are...... it's not rocket science to figure out where walleye spawn on any body of water! ****, I can figure that out by looking at a depth chart. Just so you're aware....I am a guide on LOTW and put an average of about 190 full days on this lake a summer. I know ""most"" other pro-guides and work with or for allot of them. Yes, I've had days where you just hit it right and clients will land maybe 8-10 ""big"" fish in a day.....but 80-100 big walleye?...Again nice to dream! Yes, I do know where the ""spots"" are with regards to numbers, as opposed to size. And yes....most of the time they're different! There is nothing guaranteed about fishing.....that's why they call it fishing and not catching! You can put the percentages in your favour, but....there are days when you catch big fish and lots of fish one day, and go back the next and fail miserably (with all conditions exactly the same) And by the way....as much as people think, with technology the way it is today......there are no secrets on this lake. If you have ""a honey hole"" , chances are it's been fished before....probably by me! Lol Today's your lucky day though.....here's a piece of free advice for ya! If you want to consistently catch "" bigger walleye"" , stay away from the deep holes you elude to. Most big fish, regardless of the time of year are caught in 10ft or less. But...and it's a big BUT. There are other factors that must be met when choosing the correct 10ft or less piece of water. But I'll leave that up to you to figure out......cause you're a smart guy...right? Lol"
2566393,srj,2014-03-18 09:08:00,971,"This has been a very interesting thread. Two things really stand out. First, Kirk, you must have fishing partners with the patience of Moses to let you drive around for a day.........or 2....just looking. My partners would mutiny and take over the boat to get lines in the water after seeing many fish, big and small, on the electronics! Second, the apparent numbers of very large fish you catch. That said, I wish you well on catching mostly very large fish and big numbers. I have never had a numbers day [50 plus] with a majority of big fish on LOW. Having had a cabin on the Canada side of LOW since 72, I agree with Gunner on big fish in shallow water, although I have caught a few very large eyes jigging trout deep. I now have a cabin on the US side, and still find most big fish shallow. Downrigging doesn't apply. Good luck"
2567449,KM1,2014-03-18 13:47:00,374,I will respond to each of your statements individually Mr. Fletcher:
2551826,KM1,2014-03-13 17:43:00,374,"I am a firm believer also that Walleyes will travel whatever they need to in seeking the best opportunities available for ""food."" Could be many miles if need be. However, there is a train of thought out there that Walleyes WON'T cross main basin areas to reach food sources when there is food sources available not far from where they are at. Personally...I think both are true above, depending on the lake and the circumstance in any particular year. And one of the problems with assessing the ""best"" (meaning large numbers AND large fish - 30+"") on LOTW is that there are many, many great looking areas. Deep holes in the areas we will be focused on are anywhere from say 59' to 90.' The question, from my perspective, is which reefs, points, islands, etc. (between spawning areas and areas of deep water) will hold the largest number and size of Walleye's during the time frame we will be on LOTW. It has to be somewhere between the deeper areas available and walleye spawning areas...whether tenths of a mile or many miles. Thus...my reason for wanting to know main and best spawning areas. A HUGE key on Walleye location will be determined by the areas holding the most abundant and appropriate size prey, for any particular year, that walleyes target. Wherever that is, in relation to deep water, is where those fish are most likely to be. No absolutes of course. So much water...so many spots...just trying to narrow search patterns down a little. Thanks so much for your help...it will give us good direction."
2552162,KM1,2014-03-13 19:17:00,374,"I found all areas except Astron Bay and Tranquil Channel....any markers that might help me locate these areas? And thanks....this helps A LOT as I get a good lay of where the deep holes, mid-lake humps, nearest/secondary/etc. points, and islands are in relation to the main spawning areas of this part of LOTW's."
2555402,weston,2014-03-14 18:58:00,18,Astron Bay is west of sunset channel and Tranquil Channel is nw of Skeet island
2556058,Gunner_Fletch,2014-03-15 04:35:00,74,"Dude....you are soooo overthinking this! You won't have any problem finding walleye on this body of water. During the timeframe you're up here, follow these easy steps: 1. Get out of bed. 2. Get in boat. 3. Find mid-water hump 16-35 ft. 4. Troll it, jig it, spinner bait it. 5. Catch fish 6. Release fish It's that simple!"
2556545,KM1,2014-03-15 08:15:00,374,"LOL...that all depends on what you are fishing for. Sure...LOTW is a piece of cake when you are looking for 16""-18"" fish, with the occasional chance of putting a 28,"" 29,"" 30"" fish in the boat. Drop by almost any point, reef, island (with proper conditions and time of year)...cast a jig and a leech...maybe lindy rig...or bounce the area...and sure it is that easy.Most fisherman would be happy with the above. BUT when one is looking to have 80 - 100 fish days with few fish below 22,"" most in the 26"" range, and several topping 30""...that is a completely different ball game. One must be a little more selective than:""1. Get out of bed.2. Get in boat.3. Find mid-water hump 16-35 ft.4. Troll it, jig it, spinner bait it.5. Catch fish6. Release fish""That is unless the fishing has improved that much over the last 14 years...used to go every year till about 2000...but it has been a good 14 now so maybe it has changed THAT much. We will see!!!"
2558665,Bonefish1,2014-03-15 20:42:00,1,"Do you troll, run spinners or gig? Live or artificial bait? Just curious. I know where the fish spawn & I am very familiar with the area. Brad Moen Resident East Allie island LOTW"
2558849,KM1,2014-03-15 21:39:00,374,"Thanks for chiming in. We tend to use bouncers a lot when locating schools of walleye (spinner blades, Mack Smile spinners, etc.). Once located...if the fishing is hot...we will stick with that for a while. However, we do LOVE to jig and leech fish...as well as Lindy rig with leeches and crawlers. Crankbaits are not out of the question as, when wind picks up and/or light conditions are right, and fish move into shallower water, we will cast cranks for them as well. These presentations are done slow trolling, control drifting, or vertical line fishing. I would say we lean very heavily toward live bait fishing when on LOTW. It has produced best for us over the years. Any other MAIN spawning areas you know of that are different than what has been listed. Looking mainly at the attached linked areas in an earlier post on this thread. Basically ""we will be fishing out of Witch Bay camp...which is North and East of the areas pictured. We are looking mainly for MAJOR spawning sites that feed the main lake reefs, humps, points, and islands South of Allie and East Allie Islands and East/South of Oliver Island, North of Bath Island, West of Ferrier Island and Fog Island, around the areas of Robertson Island and White Out Island. We do have other areas marked but these will be our main fishing selections."" Just getting a feel for MAIN spawning areas closest to these areas above. I know...lots of water to cover :-)!!! Thanks for any other info you could give."
2559249,Blue Lk,2014-03-16 07:21:00,269,"My thoughts exactly,thats why it's called fishing"
2559401,KM1,2014-03-16 08:08:00,374,"Again...LOL...depends on what you are fishing for. My grandma can jump in a tin can, drift along almost any point or mid lack hump in June/July and catch some walleye....but consistent 26"" - 30+"" fish from several different areas...THAT is a different story.But to each his own I guess!!!"
2559873,nervous knotter,2014-03-16 09:59:00,211,"KM, I don't think your over thinking this but you are being a bit assumptive that people will give up their hard earned knowledge of the the area so you can cut to chase and get on the big fish. I fish that area as well but we have spent a lot of time figuring it out and we would be hard pressed to give up all our knowledge of the area to a stranger. Our best days on the water are when we search( on the water), find, and catch fish on our own. I would always share what I know with friends but never with a stranger or someone I know is going to be bringing other people and sharing with them ,and so on and so on. Call me selfish but I go to these remote places to get away from heavy pressure not to fish alongside someone who got the spot off WC."
2535769,KM1,2014-03-09 14:57:00,374,"Was wondering if there are any of you who KNOW LOTW so well that you are familiar with the major spawning areas in the North Central part of the lake. I am talking around Andrew Bay, South of Allie and Oliver Islands, around (mainly west of it) Ferrier Island, North of Bath Island and around Fog Island.I am using my new Insight Planner and Navionics+ chip to plot my routes/tracks and way points for our trip in June/July and would like to know major spawning areas in order to plot likely fish dispersal routes toward deep holes in main lake areas of this section of the lake.I am aware of the Western section of this area as being one major spawning site...but there have to be others that fit the bill.Any ideas??? Specifics would be great (names of islands, points, reefs, etc.)"
2542385,weston,2014-03-11 10:46:00,18,Red Cliff Bay and POW Bay are 2 big ones but watch for uncharted rocks to hit in that area there is a few.
2544433,DMella,2014-03-11 21:10:00,32,Km1 is the Navionics+ chip higher resolution then the previous premium chip? Are the contours closer together?
2544577,KM1,2014-03-11 22:07:00,374,"familiar with any other chip at this point so I cannot say whether it has higher resolution or not. However, I have attached a screen shot of the Navionics+ version of LOTW Western Ontario section right around Ferrier Island. There are two maps...one is the Navigation Chart, which is very similar to the chart one might purchase in Canada of the lake, while the other is the Sonar Chart, which contains contour lines in 1 foot increments (I think). The maps are selected at 0.1 of a mile respectively. They can zoom in all the way down to 0.02 of a mile...which is much larger than these pics demonstrate.As you can see...there is a vast difference in contour lines between the Navigation Chart and the Sonar Chart. I will be using both in my HDS 12 touch units as both server important purposes for me on this lake. Hope this helps."
2544681,KM1,2014-03-11 23:04:00,374,Have you heard of any spawning going on in the French Narrows area of the lake...just East of East Allie Island?Also...any other large spawning areas say west of POW Bay and Red Cliff Bay (North West maybe also). There are great looking points and reefs out there that look like they would hold large schools of bait fish and other prey?Just getting a lay of the land and comparing it to where we have caught 30+ inch walleyes in the past.
2547001,DMella,2014-03-12 14:30:00,32,That is a marked difference from the previous version in the sonar chart!! Looks like another expenditure to the list for me. As far as the spawning areas I am aware of... I would second POW and Red Cliff. If you continue a bit further south and east Martin Is. near Blueberry inlet is a traditional spot as well as Adams River bay which extends to the north east out of Yellow Girl. No one has ever confirmed this but I have to believe that where Cross Inlet flows north into the western end of Long Bay there is current and some excellent looking spawning territory. I know all of this is further south than you are looking for but I those are the areas I am familiar with.Isn't Planning about 9/10th's of the fun!
2547777,KM1,2014-03-12 17:26:00,374,"I appreciate your response. I have to say...those pics, the sonar one especially, doesn't really do justice to how far one can zoom in...at least with the Insight Planner I am using to view my Navionics+ charts of LOTW. Will be trying them in an HDS unit some time soon...will just take it over to Bass Pro Shops as everything in my boat is disconnected still from winter storage, and plug them in to see what they show.As far as spawning areas go...the farthest south we will likely go will be around Fog Island.My main purpose for knowing spawning areas has to do with the where walleyes will disperse from and head out into the main lake. Our fishing is at the end of June beginning of July and most of our time will be at the secondary points outside of the spawning areas (the second and third areas Walleyes might hit and hold as they proceed out to main lake humps)...as well as the first, second and, possibly main lake humps and reefs with solid access to the deepest water in the area.That is why I am wondering if there is some good spawning up in the French Narrows area and maybe south of this as some of this water real estate does look good for spawning on the maps.Any other solid feedback will be much appreciated. Anyone???"
2548017,weston,2014-03-12 18:22:00,18,"Walleyes will spawn around French Narrows and East Allie, I wouldn't consider that area a major spawning area. By end of June early July the mid lake humps 16' - 24' should be stacked with bigger fish feeding on shallower humps at low light times. Might be a late spawn again this year and late mayfly so...?"
2548841,KM1,2014-03-12 21:02:00,374,"Yes...just wasn't sure as the French Narrows does carry some of the characteristics as in the other major spawning areas mentioned.Yes...mid-lake humps have produced 31"" fish for us in the past...and very, very many fish between 25"" and 29."" But, as you indicate, the late spring will definitely have an impact on the spawn. Dispersal will all depend on the weather and how fast the lake warms up. Solid hot weather early can speed things up...and surely all of this will impact mayfly hatches.Wondering if you know the nearest MAJOR spawning areas to the locations (purple circles) of fishing areas circled on the screen shots provided. We will be concentrating our efforts in these areas...as well as some others not pictured...and knowing the main spawning areas will help in determining possible dispersal patterns and help us track the walleye's as they move out to main lake humps and reefs.Just gives us better guesstimates on what might happen, again, depending on weather/water temp/etc.We are looking mainly for MAJOR spawning sites that feed the main lake reefs, humps, points, and islands South of Allie and East Allie Islands and East/South of Oliver Island, North of Bath Island, West of Ferrier Island and Fog Island, around the areas of Robertson Island and White Out Island. We do have other areas marked but these will be our main fishing selections.Thanks!!!I do realize that POW Bay and Red Cliff Bay will feed many of these Southern mid-lake areas....but what about the ones a little more North of say Britannia I Island"
2549162,weston,2014-03-12 23:20:00,18,"I believe the walleyes migrate a lot further then you might think. I know that some will spawn around the mid lake Islands and Barrier Islands but the mainland bays offer a little more protection and warm up quicker. That said major spawning areas include Sunset Channel, Astron Bay, Tranquil Channel, Yellowgirl, westside of Rope Island, Wiley Point, southside of Deadbroke. Hope that helps a bit."
