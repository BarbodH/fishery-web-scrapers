2549210,octanehi5,2014-03-13 03:32:00,1104,"We cross the border into Quebec, always a duty free shop on the border,aways exchange there good rate, right now its US $1000 = $1100 Can. well worth the exchange"
2549418,Guest,2014-03-13 06:21:00,0,"Credit cards are fine, just remember to use one that does not charge a foreign exchange fee. If you are buying a large item, this number could add up to a sizable fee. As mentioned before in the thread, you're best bet for hard currency is always exchange in the target country. Ask any travel agent."
2549474,Ferrispata,2014-03-13 06:44:00,63,"Thanks Ron. We will be crossing the border at NY/Quebec border as well. How do you guys typically pay your balance at Tamarac? Canadian $, American $, Check (Amer $) Thanks. Jerry"
2549946,Downrigger,2014-03-13 08:26:00,60,"I am a senior. I maintain an account with BMO. There are no service charges. Only cost is for checks, which I do not use much as I have a debit card. I leave a small amount in account to keep open when not in Canada. When I get to Canada, I make my deposit for my stay, getting immediate credit, and the exchange rate in effect at the time of deposit. This year I wired funds to lock in the favorable rate. Received $1.0842 Ca. for each $1.00 US. A $1000 deposit US gained me $84.20 CA. Will pay for some of that expensive Ca. gas. The biggest advantage is that all purchases are in Canadian funds - no confusion of rate, accepted by everyone, no credit card fees."
2550538,"6'3""",2014-03-13 10:29:00,47,Just curius how you all think this will work out. This is our 2nd year at the lodge we're going to so I don't know the owners all that well. Last year it was pretty much an even exchange rate. I sent the down payment around the 1st of the year for the 2014 trip. I see on their website that the rates are Canadian funds and of course I sent U.S. money(check). Should I have a credit towards the balance over and above the down payment? Is the rate diference from when I made the down payment or the rate when we get there?
2551010,Skywagon,2014-03-13 12:42:00,1106,Only the lodge can answer that for you.
2552817,roscoe33,2014-03-14 02:29:00,653,"Paid our deposit of 1000 US, and got 1090 Can applied to our bill. The balance will be paid at check out, and will be at the exchange rate posted at that time."
2552953,octanehi5,2014-03-14 05:57:00,1104,Most Canadian outfitters list their prices in Can $ or say US$ Tamarac We pay in Can $ they do not take plastic
2556090,F250,2014-03-15 04:55:00,75,"I keep a small checking account at the CIBC in Canada. The exchange rate I receive at the ""duty free"" shops located just before the US/Canada border in Vt. is the same as I get from my bank."
1864409,SinOrSwim,2013-06-13 17:12:00,1528,"We don't exchange any money anymore either. We don't buy enough to justify it. We used to whent he exchange rate was so lopsided but now, if you want some Canadian, buy something, pay with a $50 and your change will be Canadian."
1865561,Guest,2013-06-14 05:09:00,0,"You need to remember that there is a foreign transaction fee on most credit cards. The only one I have found that doesn't have the fee is Capital One. Therefore this is the card that we use going to Europe. Oh, remember, Canada is a foreign country too."
1865593,Shellback,2013-06-14 05:46:00,8083,"I use my Cabelas Club Visa. Cabelas charges 1%, and since you earn 1% in points, it's a wash. I've had banks charge me as much as 3% for an exchange. I now just swap cash with a Canadian friend. He can use the US dollars when he comes to the states, and he avoids the fees his bank charges when he needs American dollars."
1865617,guidedfishing,2013-06-14 06:01:00,531,"Your credit card will charge a foreign exchange fee, its not free. Check with them to see what it is it really pretty minimal. Also for every place that will take a US Dollar straight up there are just as many that will charge you as much as 10 to 15%. When they take those USD to the bank, they get charged an exchange rate as well. I travel frequently to fish in Ontario. Here is what I do. 1. I call my card company and let them know each trip so they do not deny the card for being out of country its well worth the 3 min call to let your card company know so you don't get denied trying to buy gas etc. 2. Just stop at an ATM machine, you will be charged a small tranaction fee maybe two bucks but the ATM will will dispense Canadian Dollars and your card will perform the exchange rate for you. I like to have some Canadian dollars on me and I never worry about it just comes with me on the next trip anyway. 3. Don't use a debit card, and watch your Credit statement closely after each trip, its a target rich market for getting your number hi-jacked. 4. And as said when in doubt I have never had any store or lodge turn up their nose at USD, you may have to pay more than the exchange rate but they will take it. Good luck"
1866433,oleJoe,2013-06-14 11:33:00,114,You might want to check with your credit card co. Mine charge me a fee for buying my Canadian license on line which they didn't use to do. Just cross the border and stop in any bank and they will exchange it at a fair rate.
2546329,Ferrispata,2014-03-12 11:46:00,63,Now with the exchange more in favor of US$$ where do people exchange if they do?
2546777,roscoe33,2014-03-12 13:33:00,653,"We haven't exchanged $$$ for over 20 years. Groceries, license, and gas go on credit card. Resort takes US cash at current exchange rate, no fee, as they are remote and have no way to process credit cards. Tim Hortons takes CC or US $"
2547105,zman8701,2014-03-12 14:56:00,100,"If you want to do an exchange rate, Border Bob's in Int Falls will do so."
2547281,jimmie,2014-03-12 15:35:00,123,"Right out of the border checkin there is the tourism depot for Canada with parking for rigs ect. Restrooms, bank inside which usually charges 1/2-1% exchange rate. Lotsa booklets, maps ect to check up on id you like (free Brachures). I think that opens at 7am!! If going thru the Fort Frances downtown East there are a cpl banks that you can use you ATM visa to get Canada cash up to $240 a day also in Dryden if you turn left at first light past the mill and go thru a stop bank on corner BMO has same amount atm visa access open in front lobby 24/7! Have a great trip!! Jim"
2547361,3M TA3,2014-03-12 16:02:00,2846,"Like Guidedfishing says, an ATM is very difficult to beat. The fees are minimal compared to other exchanges. Try a small amount and see. You'll be using it more on future trips."
1863177,troutwater,2013-06-13 10:02:00,299,Heading up to Canada in two weeks and looking for a place to exchange some money for Canadian cash. Does anyone have suggestions on where to do this? I'd prefer to do it before I cross the border at International Falls. I live in the Minneapolis metro so if there are any here that would work too. My credit union doesn't do it unfortunately.
1863257,zeebee,2013-06-13 10:25:00,1144,I have found the best exchange rates at Canadian bank/credit unions. You will find at least one branch in virtually all Cdn towns.
1863385,TIGHTLINER,2013-06-13 11:20:00,223,Was up north the second week of the season. Went thru at the Soo and went to a bank there. It was close to par at that time. When there was a difference years ago we stopped at the Casino's and did not get docked any because they thought you were going to spend it in the Casino. Probably will never see those days again.
1863497,Guest,2013-06-13 11:48:00,0,"If crossing by Int Falls, the duty free will exchange at a fair rate. If you have a national bank in your hometown they will also get you canadian money with a weeks notice."
1863569,wallydave,2013-06-13 12:11:00,2151,"I was thinking about a thread like this one! The local credit union will exchange currency, but they charge a fee too! Right now I can not recall what the fee was when I went to Rome last year. Ahh the good old days when the dollar was stronger, we didn't worry about the exchange in those days! Or maybe we are getting wiser??!!"
1863577,aggie kolisnik,2013-06-13 12:16:00,39,Some of us are taking at par. Check with the resort you are at. Have a great time.
1863601,troutwater,2013-06-13 12:33:00,299,"Awesome thanks. I've never been to the duty free store there. Most banks I've asked say I need a membership to do currency exchange, but I haven't asked the First National Bank of Minnesota yet."
1863705,JayM5209,2013-06-13 12:45:00,1050,"Don't waste your time, energy, or sweat trying to exchange currency. I was in NW Ontario for two weeks at the end of May and every single place I purchased goods or services took my US$$ at par with the CDN$. The gallon of gas you burn to find a place to exchange will cost more than you might gain by the exchange. Better to invest the time, energy and worry in what presentation the 'eyes will respond to!Have a great trip."
1863905,port1042,2013-06-13 13:35:00,509,"Unless your lodge is requiring Canadian funds, don't bother with the exchange. I was there in late May and everyone was happy to get US dollars. In most cases the exchange was 1 for 1 -- and in a couple of places less than a 1% difference."
1864201,houndog,2013-06-13 15:10:00,365,At 1:00 p.m. central time today the exchange rate was one US Dollar = $1.02 Canadian Dollars. Consider the 2% as part of your tip.If you use your credit card for everything but the camp you can't go wrong. Credit card companies are to exchange the currency at no fee.http://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/exc...ily-converter/houndog
