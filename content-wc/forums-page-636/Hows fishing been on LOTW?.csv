Depth? >Also, how is the water level??? I spent 3 weeks in the NE Quadrant of LOW. Water level is normal -- they have had a ton of rain there the past 2 months. Fishing was good -- we found them more on bars off islands than underwater humps, which is unusual for the summer pattern. Depth was 35 feet plus or minus 10 feet. The deeper underwater humps (topping off at 25 feet or so and the broader the hump the better) acted more like flats than humps and also held fish."
