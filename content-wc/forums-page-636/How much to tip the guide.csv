568340,Guest,2007-08-14 09:25:00,0,"Jared, When I started guiding I made $85 Cdn per day for 10 hrs on the water plus morning prep. and fish cleaning after made for about a 12-13 hr day on average which works out to $6 - $7 per hour. I moved up to $100 per day in later years which was closer to $8.5/hr. I would say the average now is $125 with some higher. You are right, nobody really speaks in how much you make per/hr, its always per day or month but if you break it down it does work out to be a fairly low hourly wage. So tips were very appreciated and I always thanked my guests very much for their generosity. I found on average that most of my guests thought we made alot more than we actually did in salary. All of that being said we did get to go fishing everday for our job which is about the best perk you can have. But even guiding can become difficult when the weather is bad, fishing is slow, the guests are impatient or all of the above at the same time. When you have to be on the water everyday for an entire summer you will get tired of it at some point...believe me I didn't think it would happen to me. It's not just a relaxing, kick your feet back fishing day for us. We have alot of pressure from guests and lodge owners to produce great fishing every second of every day. The problem is no lake is great every second of every day all summer long. There will always be slow times and if your not catching fish but your guide is trying to figure it out have some patience. That's all, Joel"
568414,Northpoint,2007-08-16 11:35:00,38,Thanks to all that replied. My wife and I had tipped $100 per day for the two of us and another $50 for any evening fishing with another small bonus for any big fish. Given the responses it seems like we were a bit on the high end but that's ok given his hard work. Thanks again!

568227,Northpoint,2007-08-09 15:33:00,38,What is a reasonable tip for an entire day of good to excellent walleye fishing for two people? Thanks!

That is what we give our guide for the same service. $25 per man per day...plus at the end of 5 days fishing we give him a $100 Bonus. For three of us for the 5 days it comes out to $158 per man....well worth it."
568246,dave10,2007-08-10 09:21:00,342,"I'm probably on the cheap side, but I use the normal 15 - 20% that most people use for waiters and other service providers. So, for a $250/day guide, we'll tip $50 (regardless of the number of guys) if they've worked for us and have been pleasant to spend time with. Dave"
568250,Guest,2007-08-10 14:08:00,0,Just a Side note for when you are considering this topic and your thoughts. If you guide is part of lodge staff and not a manager or on contract with the camp he is probably only recieving 20% of the money you pay for him guiding. I you look on the ontario job boards for places advetising for guides and staff for resorts they are offering roughly 8 to 12 dollards an hour canadian per hour for guides. Charge for a days guding on average 200 - 250 us (6 hours) Rate of pay for employee 7 to 11 US (6 hours) Basically if you can afford it all i'm saying is try to tip the best you can. I always have. Just make sure it goes in the right persons pocket.

To many people now expect a tip no matter how poor the service, sorry, tipping is for good service in my mind, not just being there. Al"

568268,Guest,2007-08-11 08:40:00,0,"I'm not starting an arguement by any means. However, as a resort owner, that comment isn't accurate. The general going rate for a guide per day is $150 per day for two and $10 extra per person over two. So, if your group is 5... the guide is paid $180 (150+30). The resort would charge (my resort as an example) around 220. However, the extra fees come in boat rental. Most guides don't use their own boat or gas... so that is the resort's expense. Anyhow, I'm a BIG fan of 15-20%... IF you're in a group that does a pool, and your guide wins you the ""big fish"" or ""most fish"" or whatever... tip him at least 25% of that pot (on top of the 15-20%).

568269,Guest,2007-08-11 08:42:00,0,"Oh, and very few guides (infact I don't know one on LOTW) are paid by the hour. It's always by the day (or half day)."
