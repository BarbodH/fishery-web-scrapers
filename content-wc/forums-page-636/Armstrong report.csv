568508,bugsy,2007-08-19 05:08:00,49,"Returned 2 weeks ago from fly-in with Northern Outposts. Windsor Lake is some 150 miles north of Armstrong, on the Attawapiskat River. Camp and equipment was suitable for 6. Lots of advenuresome(and a little treacherous for the unwary) water with a combination of river and lake fishing produced decent walleye and pike, not great quantity, but good quality. Weather was, as in so many reports, changeable and varied. Fog, cold, strong wind, rain, electrical storms and hot placid weather. Were forced to take to shore several times. 3 hour flight weather delay on the way in and within a half hour of scheduled time out."
