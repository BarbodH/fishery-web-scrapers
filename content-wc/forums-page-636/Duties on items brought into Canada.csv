568456,Mr. Walleye,2007-08-17 15:36:00,74,In June we bought beer at the IF duty free for 17.50 per case plus duty of around 7.50. Total of $25 per case. Saved us around $15 per case compared to buying in Canada.
568388,ajbuff,2007-08-15 17:08:00,11,9 days and a wakeup and I'm off to Wabaskang (assuming that I will actually get any sleep the next week+) We have been having a discussion in our group whether to buy our booze in Canada or grab some extra and declare it at Fort Francis. I have read post after post about the pros and cons of both. What I'm asking is just how much do they charge for bringing an extra liter across into Canada from the U.S. I've heard from $2 to $3 per bottle or sometimes more. This is only my second time across and I want to get it right. Thanks for any help!
568407,walley250,2007-08-16 08:13:00,161,Its not worth the extra time at the border. Just take the correct amount over the border and buy what ever extra you may need there.
568409,phishfearme,2007-08-16 08:22:00,1242,"aj - for an idea on the amount of duty, take a look at:https://www.walleyecentral.com/dc/dcb...id=61348&page= i think the ""mark-up fee"" is based on alchohol content but not sure. concerning the previous post about not worth the time - this is probably true at international falls/fort francis - but not at pidgeon river - took no time at all. phish"
568428,ajbuff,2007-08-16 15:44:00,11,"Thanks for the help fellas. I think I might just give one of the cannucks on the border a call and see what they have to say. It's really not a big deal. Hookin' old marble eye is the real purpose...just kinda nice to sit back with a cocktail to really help the lie tellin'! We go through IF/FF at about 5:00 a.m. so shouldn't have a wait, unless we get tore down. Thanks for the help! AJB"
568429,Guest,2007-08-16 16:30:00,0,"Here's my personal experience: Brought an extra case of Bud Light across at IF/FF. I had to park the car and go inside to pay the duty. They asked me how much the case cost. I told them I paid $15. Here's the stickler for this dummy... They marked up the case to about $28CA and charged me $6CA duty. Liquor was about $6CA/Liter the year before. Same thing... park and pay. The bottle was only $6 to begin with. I buy a Liter of vodka every year in FF. It usually runs about $20-25CA. Not a great buy. This year I'm going to the duty free store before the border in IF on my way up to check the prices. I guess, ""long winded"", it is darn expensive to get your drink on in CA."
568436,Guest,2007-08-16 22:14:00,0,We paid $48 a case for beer in Canada when we ran out. When we went in it was drizzling rain and one group of guys in another car told them he had an extra case of beer and the customs fella said thats ok go right on in. Heard that they were relaxing a little on the extra booze. Two years ago we went in and the same guy bought 2 bottles extra at the duty free store. When he paid the customs on it the cost of the booze and customs was more than if he had bought it at the local liquor store in IF.
568447,ajbuff,2007-08-17 12:24:00,11,"Okay...here's the skinny. I spoke with a CBSA Officer on the phone. The scenario I presented was bringing an 80 proof (40%) extra liter of whiskey across with a purchase price of approximately $12.00 US. I was told the taxes and duty would be about $20. Not sure if it is US or CAN money, but who cares. Guess I'm gonna buy in Candada. It's either gonna be expensive or expensive. Now I have to find a liquor store open in Dryden on a Saturday morning...or not! Thanks for everyone's advice and help. This has been one of the best message boards that I have been a part of! 7 days till I'm wheels up for Wabaskang!!!!! AJB"
568449,phishfearme,2007-08-17 12:42:00,1242,"aj - this sounds about right - the more alchohol the more duty/tax. the best bet is to get a duty free bottle and duty free beer, declare the beer and pay the duty on the beer (maybe - sometimes they wave you thru). this way the beer is about half the price as it is in the canadian stores. if you need more than a bottle of booze then you should pay! phish"
568453,Guest,2007-08-17 15:13:00,0,"We just got back from Wabbie a couple of weeks ago. We, my wife and I, each got a 40 oz bottle at the duty free. I understand that the duty is much more than a couple of bucks per bottle brought in. We paid about $35.00 for a case of Molson in Ear Falls. Check at the duty free, it might be less expensive to buy beer there and pay the duty on it. Where will you be staying on Wabbie? We were at King Fisher and it was great. Lots of Wallys, not big but nice. We had no trouble taking 8 that pushed the slot."
568454,Guest,2007-08-17 15:19:00,0,"As I recall, Absolute Vodka was about $16.00 at the duty free, and I think that was a 40 oz. The Dewers Scotch was a 40 and I seem to remember that it was about $16.00"
