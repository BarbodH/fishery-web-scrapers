567775,Guest,2007-07-25 12:45:00,0,We are heading there in three weeks. Would like info on water conditions. The lakes have been so low the last couple of years. And how was the fishing.
567777,Guest,2007-07-25 14:38:00,0,"Hey there, I am interested to see the responses you get as I am also going to Ogoki for my first time the first week in August, which week will you be there. I was hoping to get a little info from jigman yet on this lake."

I didn't fish Ogoki this year, but did the previous two. Another guy on here from Arkansas (sorry don't remember your name) was going to Ogoki this year. Maybe he'll post on his luck. Maybe he didn't go yet, I don't remember."

He worked as camp attendant at Ogoki Reservoir the past 6 weeks and just came out a few days ago. Since I missed going there this year , the first in 9 years , I was asking about the fishing and water levels . He stated the water was extremely high and still over the main dock when he left , in fact he said for most of the time he was there the water was back in the bush . We are going up a week early to fish and bait bears and will be fishing a portion of the Little Jackfish River which is the river connecting Mojikit with Lake Nipigon."

But averaged 20 inches and about 100-125 fish a day per boat. Moose Crossing unbelievable spot to go, worth the long boat ride. Duane, oh Duane. I have never met a nicer more accomadating camp attendant in my life. Hard worker, really cares about customers. I enjoyed his company so much, had some meals with him. He loved my wife's mostaccoli, italian sausage sandwiches and peanut butter & chocolate candy treats. He definitely made our groups trip much more enjoyable. Those of you going will really miss out not meeting him. First class place, new showers were awesome. Now only for indoor plumbing, I hate using outhouse's. Good Luck, Walleye Eater"

Loads of walleye in the 18 to 20 inch range, all released except a few a day to eat and a meal along home to enjoy with the family. My first trip with Mattice Lake Outfitters and will definately give them a A+ rating. As far as water level they told us the water level right now is up. in fact he said last week was the first he had been able to use the one main dock at camp as the water level had actually been over the dock. It did drop about 6 inches in the week that we were there.We were surprised when a plane landed one day and a conservation officer hopped out and walked up to our cabin checked our fish and license then wished us a safe trip home and rest of the week and left again. Thanks again to jigman for the information you sent me. >Hey there, > I am interested to see the responses you get as I am also >going to Ogoki for my first time the first week in August, >which week will you be there.
