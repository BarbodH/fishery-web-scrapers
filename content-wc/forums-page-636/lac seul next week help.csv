568441,JDP,2007-08-17 08:07:00,1457,"Thanks NWO. People posting on WC almost always have the best of intention but sometimes have erroneous information. I believe the change to 1 fish over 21"" was made mid-season (June 21st?) in 1993. I'm not sure when the move was made from 6 walleye per person to 4 walleye per person. :cheers:"

568368,Guest,2007-08-14 19:02:00,0,"Are you referring to river resorts as in Evergreen? I just spoke to someone that with their camp boats, which have 50 horse, it took two hours to get to MeKenzie?????"
568371,Guest,2007-08-14 19:20:00,0,"yes, as in evergreen lodge. whomever you spoke with is incorrect. i've made the run several times with their boats. i consider myself to be at the northern side of mckenzie after exiting east shanty narrows. perhaps its a matter of semantics as to where mckenzie begins. evergreen through the narrows is about 40-45 minutes wide open. their boats run about 30 mph. its about 20 miles, give or take. i guess a strong south or southeast wind could make a difference."

568399,Guest,2007-08-16 01:00:00,0,"We just got back from Lac Seul today (Wednesday). We stayed at Gawley's. Their accomodations are sparse - exactly how we want them. Nice cabin but we're not there much. We're there to eat and sleep. It's one of the least expensive on the lake. We did fish some in McKenzie and did quite well on the main lake humps on the north end but didn't spend much time there. We go all the way out to Manitou Narrows and the main lake. I think the its called Wlliams Bay (not sure). Fishing beyond McKenzie is the only way to go if you like to catch numbers and size. There are humps everywhere to fish and they're loaded with fish. Someone responded about the wind and he was correct. It was gusting to 40mph on Tuesday. Just vscious! BUT, the fishing was outstanding. Many, many over 22"", very few under 20"". Controlling your boat is tough but if you know what your doing you can stay on you spots (mark them all on your GPS). I run a 2005 Yamaha F150 and used about 10-11 gallons per day and that is all the traveling (40-60 minutes one way depending how rough it is) and all the trolling. One of our other boats runs a 2006 115 Opti and was using about 11-12 gallons a day and the last is a 1997 60hp Yamaha 2 stroke using about 9 gallons a day. All the motors were running all day backtrolling. In 5 days it was calm enough for electrics only on the afternoon we arrived. We backtroll so all the boats were using either lindy rigs or jigs. I have used the Northland jig (flat on the sides with the big eye ball) exclusively (for the 2 years we've been going up there), tipped with a leech. 3/8oz, Silver or gold both work exceptionally. The other guys used either leeches or crawlers with their lindys. All worked equally well. It does not pay to fish anything west of McKenzie, in our opinion. If you do so, you might as well go to Minaki. Numbers a just as good and the potential for a big one is better on Big Sand (Minaki). Plus, you'll be burning a lot less fuel (at $6.50 a gallon it matters). East of McKenzie each fisherman can expect to catch anywhere from 35-80 fish per day (depending on how quick you get your bait back into the water) with an average of around 22"". Our biggest in 5 days was 25"". A little dissappointing but there were many, many, of them. By the way, we believe Lac Seul fish fight much harder than their size indicates. It will also take most of your day to catch 19-19 3/4"" fish to put on ice. Gawleys provides free ice to fill your livewell with. For 5 days, 3 boats, that's well over $200 of ice!! Depths range from 18' to 32' on wind swept flats to 24' to 35' on other flats less exposed to wave action. Tuesday afternoon saw 2 of our boats land well in excess of 100 fish fron 2pm to 5 pm in 18' of water and it was VERY, VERY, rough. Look for fast drop-offs with a top around 18 feet. Be careful, there is much danger on this lake. A number of huge boulders just under or just above the surface. There are plenty of hazards so you better know where you're going!! (mark all of those as well!!!) Good luck!"
568400,Guest,2007-08-16 06:43:00,0,"I hope that was a typo - If not you were keeping slot fish to put on ice. Hefty fine. So not only know the hazards, but know the slot! Keep your eaters under 18""."

568408,Guest,2007-08-16 08:14:00,0,"THARDER, I'VE NEVER WENT BEYOND MCKENZIE BAY. HOW FAR? WERE STAYING AT LITTLE BEAVER TO THEY RUN A GREAT CAMP.ANY CHANCE YOU WOULD SHARE A WAYPOINT OR 2 JUST AD LLC@YAHOO TO MY NAME..DID YOU GUYS TAKE 502 OR 71 UP?"
568411,FISH STICK,2007-08-16 08:59:00,135,"In 4 days of about 10-12 hours a day on the water I burned 40-50 gallons of gas. We jump around quite a bit though. Before going out to Mackenzie we fished a lot of areas by Sand, Lunker Pt, and Cox. On the Mackenzie run I had the motor at about 4500-5000 rpm most of the way. Most of the day we drifted and used the big motor run up 20-30 times. I didn't think 8 gallons was too bad for that."
568416,Guest,2007-08-16 12:07:00,0,"It would do no good to give you waypoints. Very few (if any) of our way points from last year produced prodigiously this year. I would say to look at the end/edge of every flat that meets the criteria I mentioned above. If you see any fish you'll likely catch many. So, when you go over a hump, pay attention. I would suggest that the best will be wind swept mid-lake humps. Lac Seul fisherman, I did some additional research and you are absolutely correct. You can have 3 fish under 18"" (good luck!) and one fish over 21"". So, keep this in mind. This was a change from last year. One other thing; it is against the law in Canada to have any alcoholic beverages onboard. The fine is up to $75 per container (per beer). Think about that one, eh! We braved it! On a final note, we're not sure we're going back next year. The traveling is just too pervasive. 2 hours a day of traveling takes its toll and we find we fish far less than we used to on Minaki. Another result is we no longer fish in the evening. That stinks because we really enjoy it. Furthermore, when Lac Seul is rough it really wears everyone out. Good luck."
568306,Guest,2007-08-13 08:56:00,0,"heading up friday for a week. staying in the goose bay area. we are familiar with steamboat and points north of there, also the northern edge of mckenzie. weather is supposed to be sunny to partly cloudy, in the low 70s, and a sw to wsw wind around 10-12 mph. sounds perfect. never been up there this late in the year. where will the walleye be? what techniques? depth? willing to venture out a little around big island and bay of islands. any advice appreciated. thanks in advance."
568320,Guest,2007-08-13 14:59:00,0,"were heading up friday as well and staying one camp south of you. weve never been there this late either, but we are fully expecting to run to mckenzie everyday. it would be nice to find somewhere closer, the 225 likes gas a little much if u know what I mean.."
568329,Guest,2007-08-13 17:49:00,0,"We just got back from Gold Pines Camp and fished several small islands/reefs around Goose Bay/Goose Island. The wind wasn't nice to us for 3 days(20-30+ mph) so we really didn't WANT to travel far. When possible bottom bouncers/spinners worked well and drifting with jigs also produced. For some reason the walleyes don't seem to like the slip bobber technique, a few hit & spit but only northerns took the bait(1/2 crawler) for more than a second. We caught fish from 10-40 ft deep with the best action between 13-17 ft deep. I actually can't imagine running as far away as other groups were going as somehow I used 30 gallons of gas running the short distances I fished in 6 days.(I actually wondered if someone was helping themselves to my boat gas at night as I've used only 20 gallons of gas all summer fishing locally and I'm out 2-3 times a week, you may want to monitor your gas.) Gold or silver spinners didn't matter when trolling/drifting, but I thought blue and orange jigs did the best for us. Numbers were down compared to last year but the conditions definitely contributed to that and the avg size was up as we caught several ""slot fish"" or above everyday. Have a safe trip and leave some for the rest of us !! Good luck !!"
568330,Guest,2007-08-13 18:10:00,0,Also heading for Lac Seul on Friday. Fishing the N/E section. Never been there and have no idea what to expect. Hoping for good weather and I hear the fish are always biting. I know it will be better than work. Wishing everyone a safe and happy trip ! Best Fishes ! ggg2
568331,FISH STICK,2007-08-13 18:15:00,135,"We were at Timber Lane last week. We didn't catch any fish on Goose all week, but did well at some of the smaller islands south of it. Based on our experience the run to Mackenzie is well worth it."
568335,Guest,2007-08-13 19:45:00,0,"Fish Stick, how long of a boat ride was it from your resort to Mackenzie? While I was cleaning fish with another group they said that it took them an hour each way to MacKenzie with a 150 Optimax, while with my 150 Opti, I was able to reach our best spots in about 5 minutes. How much gas did you use when you were there? We too only caught a few fish around Goose Island, but there are lots of smaller islands around that produced well. Glad to hear you had a good week/trip!!"
568336,Guest,2007-08-13 20:10:00,0,mckenzie is about a 40-45 minute run from the river resorts with a 50 hp motor.
568353,FISH STICK,2007-08-14 11:26:00,135,"We had rough water to deal with but with a 150 Verado we would cruise at 40 mph and it took about 40 minutes. We idled through the straights before you go out into Mackenzie Bay though. Theres a set of islands in there that seemed a little tricky to navigate. Gaswise, I burned 1/4 tank or about 8 gallons out to Mackenzie, fishing there for a day, and the trip back."
568354,Guest,2007-08-14 11:54:00,0,"wow, thats awesome mileage! don't let them shanty narrows scare you drop the hammer through there ""its funner after you been drinkin"" just kidding. yes them islands and the narrows are a little nerve wracking just remember to stay on the right side of that bouy entering mckensie bay my buddy taped bottom with his I/O tyee magnum last year on the wrong side."
568363,Guest,2007-08-14 17:18:00,0,The mileage you got out of the Verado is much better than I got with my 150 Opti.(2005) We never even went to Lunker Pt or the marker on Sand Pt and I used 30 gallons of gas in 6 days of fishing which included lots of drifting(drift sock came in handy) and anchoring on the numerous reefs. Still makes me wonder about someone siphoning gas at night though....
