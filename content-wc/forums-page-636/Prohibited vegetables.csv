568510,walleye54,2007-08-19 09:56:00,8,When buying canned vegetables ect in Canada be aware that some of that stuff is now being imported from China. I would read the label of origin before buying.
568515,Jimmy Jig,2007-08-19 18:45:00,1905,I doubt if there are any labels on Canada food. There are none in the USA and alot of the food in the grocery stores comes from China and we never know it. These fruit drinks in the boxes most are from China and not a word on the box. We are importing 1/2 the soybeans to make soy products in the US and never a word. Remember the pet food......it will never end.

I've visited several web sites but while they state potatoes are prohibited, they say other root vegetables may be restricted. We're heading up to Gull Rock Aug 24th and don't want to have them taken at Fort Frances. I need the real scoup on legal veggies!!!!!"
568369,Oldschool,2007-08-14 19:06:00,163,"Root vegetables are not to cross the border. If you ever have any doubt on an item, I think that it is easier to simply plan to purchase the item once across. Oh, and it is illegal to cross back into the U.S. with pretty much the same items that Canada restricts. We were specifically asked about root crops when we crossed this last weekend."
568377,Frankm,2007-08-15 06:42:00,154,After the potato thing we decided to just buy all our veggies up there. They actually have pretty decent produce up there. We stop at grocery store in Suoix Narrows.

Its refreshing seeing someone on here not looking for the cheapest way to do something for a change,,, and putting something into the local economy!"
568406,davenathe,2007-08-16 08:12:00,113,"I do not think it is that USA fisherman are looking for the cheapest way, simply want to have everything taken care of when we leave home. That is why we buy stuff in US vs Canada, once we hit the road we only stop of gas, food and ... well you know. Just want to get to our destination as quick as we can since we only make the trip once a year and are excited to start fishing. This year we are spending our first night in Fort Frances so we do not need to deal with any border delays, so we will shop at the FF grocery. Thanks for letting us visit your beautiful country!"
568412,Frankm,2007-08-16 09:20:00,154,"We started staying at Fort Frances about 3 years ago. We go opening weekend. We leave Thur night and stay in Emo. Then Fri is 4-5 hour drive. We have plenty of time at that point. We make 2 lists now one for home and one for Canada. We buy all our produce, bread, milk in Canada. It saves on cooler space as well as we always picked those items up last minute for freshness. For us thats all part of the enjoyment of being on vacation. I worry about pinching pennies throughout the year at home. It's nice not to have a care in the world except what spot fish next."
568413,Guest,2007-08-16 10:35:00,0,We always do our final food buy at the Safeway in Kenora for fresh produce and bread. With 8 guys for 7 days I figure we put a few $$ in the local coffers over the years. Besides with a 14 hour car ride from Chicago if there is ANY food in the cars we tend to graze all the way there.

568477,Guest,2007-08-18 13:53:00,0,Yeah I agree with you on patronizing the local businesses.It's a beautiful country up there and us visitors should give back a little when we can to ensure they'll be there next time we're up there and need a place to fill our needs.I've got a bumper crop of onions in my garden and didn't want to buy any if I didn't have to. Five days and counting!!!!!!
