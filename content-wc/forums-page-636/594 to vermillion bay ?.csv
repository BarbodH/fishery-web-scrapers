568542,Guest,2007-08-21 08:56:00,0,I go through the town of Oxdrift which saves around 10 miles and avoids minor traffic delays in the small city of Dryden. Also hit Dryden to lollygag and visit friends. It's a good place to shop for groceries.
568525,Guest,2007-08-20 13:10:00,0,We are headed up next month to Red Lake and have not travelled up 502 before. Mapquest says to go to Dryden and the across on the Trans canada.The map however shows a highway 594 that jogs over from 502 and appears to bypass Dryden. Shorter? Quicker? any ideas? thanks
568526,Guest,2007-08-20 13:18:00,0,Shorter and quicker and a #### of a lot more fun.
568527,Guest,2007-08-20 13:23:00,0,That's what i was hoping for. The road less travelled is usually more fun. I'd tend to go that way even if it was a little longer.Thanks

If you like a twisty/bumpy ride take 596. There is a bad stretch on 502 for about 15 miles that will give your trailer a beating if you are pulling a boat. But did see a wolf, bear and moose on 502 last week."
568532,Guest,2007-08-20 18:22:00,0,"We just came back from up there and were advised not to take that route. That was in Vermillion Bay. When we came back and coming in to Dryden we turned right at the first stop and go, (by the ford dealer) and that took us right to 502 with out going into Dryden. Even if you went into Dryden, it's not all that much out of the way. What would it be, a couple of miles?"
568533,Guest,2007-08-20 18:46:00,0,Louise is manager of the Dairy Queen in Dryden and knows the walleye spots in Lac Seul. Stop by for a bananna split and some good fishing information. There are also some fine supermarkets in Dryden. Great selection at good prices.
568534,Guest,2007-08-20 20:05:00,0,"Shorter? Yes. Quicker? Don't know about that one. Some tight curves, some gravel. We take it all the time but I doubt if we really save any time."
568536,2746,2007-08-21 08:12:00,3206,"It's a road that will take you through the country side, past some farms and possible wild life but, if your pulling a boat, the gravel will beat you up a bit and if it's rained you'll be covered with mud."
568538,Guest,2007-08-21 08:24:00,0,That's just the type of road we're looking for. Plenty of blacktop here in the states. Do you remember when you were a kid and you would go out of your way to walk(or jump) though a puddle rather than walkaround it? I still feel like that kid when I am in Canada.We're pulling an enclosed trailer this trip rather that a boat so a little mud is no big deal.We've hauled some big equipment down some pretty remote logging roads. This sounds pretty tame by our standards. Thanks for the info
568541,Fish_on,2007-08-21 08:43:00,1856,It's all part of the adventure!
