This is a wonderful place to go but I really never see anyone discuss this lake on this board. Does anyone know much about it and why, it seems, not many go there. Great accomadations, lots of fish - not alot of size - great people and guides. Interested in any info. Thanks"

Good food, accommodations, fishing, equipment and staff. I read about lakes that seem to have more fish and better chance at a huge one. But it's been hard for us to take a chance when we know how much we enjoy Pine Portage."
