568511,Guest,2007-08-19 10:24:00,0,The walleye limit on the Red is 4 regardless of the licence. Only one of which may exceed 22 inches. There is no such thing as a limit of 2 on the Red.
568512,Guest,2007-08-19 10:35:00,0,"Gatorhunter, There are two licenses you can get. The Conservation license allows you HALF of the limit as a regular license. As a result you get to keep two fish with the Conservation license. WHether you are Red, Lac Seul or anywhere else in Ontario. It is not a license specific to a lake. I personally like to see when a lodge throws in a free Conservation license for each person. If all of the lodges in Ontario got together and did this, it would be a very smart thing. This way all lodges would just fix the cost of the license in the cost of the trip. I know of one lodge that says it will give your entire group a Conservation license only if your entire group agrees to using the Conservation license."
568513,v-bay gord,2007-08-19 13:43:00,3168,"Bigfish....I believe the rational in choosing a protected slot range is to try and include the greatest portion of the mature spawning population. Those 18-23 inchers (or somewhere in that range depending on the lake) contain the greatest numbers of spawning fish as opposed to the larger, and less numerous individuals. I don't believe it has anything to do with egg viability in older, bigger fish."
568514,Guest,2007-08-19 16:24:00,0,"I can't beleive that somebody would even suggest that a big fish is nearly as good as a little fish. We've had a boat rule in ontario for years before the laws changed anything over 18 goes back. To our family we like to fish and eat,and the same goes with hunting ( somebody compared to being the same ) Now if you shoot a big buck you can't tell me it's as good as a smaller deer. That's a whole different topic,and a big buck is about passing on his genes When i get a big girl hooked I don't even waste time to take pictures of her. A fast measure on the side of the boat and gone. And if sombody doesn't beleive we can produce big fish to bad for them. With keeping one fish over on the red river to me is crap. With the fake mounts they do today why waste the very reason you came there to fish for. As for hooking my minnow I've always gone into the mouth and out the gills and into the back. My buddies I fish with in the fall use stinger hooks. Both work. Right time and place is everything on the red. When the bite is on it's on hard."

Jimmy Jig, not so much the eggs are bad, but the older fish don't reproduce the number of eggs the middle aged fish do, this is what I'd heard anyway. btw, to wish someone be put to death for keeping a larger fish shows a major lack of maturity, plus the brains of a eel pout. Your more than entitled to your opinion on catch and release or not to, but grow up will ya destroyer? Al."
568455,IaCraig,2007-08-17 15:19:00,434,"I share the frustration about people who keep every legal big fish they catch but to you extremists :hail: who preach that keeping even 1 legal large fish is unethical and an unforgivable sin, I say phoey, you are :cookoo: True Scenario #1 - Caught a 28 inch eye jigging a leach, returned her to the water asap & revived but it came floating back up in a few minutes, tried reviving her several more times and each time she came up quicker than the time before. I kept a watch on her as she drifted away with high hopes that she will come to,then gulls showed up and started to peck at her eyes. True Scenario #2 - Caught a 25 incher trolling a rapala and the rear treble tore out the gills on the right side really bad. I'm truely :sorry: everyone for ruining fishing for future generations by eating those 2 dead fish. Thank you for bringing to my attention the sins of my ways. But gasp, that was years ago and now it is too late. If I had only known then that the ethical thing would have been to allow those 2 dead fish to float away for the gulls and varmits to eat. If only it were people I killed and ate instead of walleyes, maybe come judgement day St Peter :rules: would show me mercy. But alas there is no hope because it was walleyes......:help:........ IaCraig :rotflmao: (sorry I couldn't keep a straight face after typing that. The scenarios are true but it is also true that I've released many many legal eyes over 20"" for every 1 over 20 I've kept)"
568459,Guest,2007-08-17 18:39:00,0,"The prohibition against keeping the 28"" plus walleyes was not approved so high and mighty anglers are once again free to kill the hogs if they sign the back of their licence. So what if commercial fishermen and aboriginals kill some hog walleyes...3 wrongs don't make a right. I see this outrageous need to kill the big fish every day. It makes me sick. Those large females are indeed prime spawners. They produce viable eggs until they die. In fact, they produce more eggs than the smaller walleyes. The scuttlebutt about them losing productivity is bogus. Eating or mounting for the wall, either reason is not acceptable in this day and age."
568460,Guest,2007-08-17 19:59:00,0,"You can only keep 4 fish if you purchase the Sportsman's license. With the Concervation license, you may only keep 2 fish."

The big females produce less eggs but have better genes. So most slot limits have taken into account this fact. Protect the prime breeders to ensure some numbers and protect the bigger females to ensure larger fish as well. This provides a balance between quantity and quality. A fishery needs both. We cannot stop the natives from doing what they do, but we can make sure we do what is responsible."

568391,Guest,2007-08-15 18:40:00,0,"I also have heard that with the upper teen and low-mid 20 inchers are the prime reproducers which Im sure is correct. However, a person going to eat a large fish just because they can. Legally they can, and if they are doing so they only think about themselves. There are alot of people who come to Canada to catch big fish each, pay lots of money to resorts which give lots of people jobs and pay local taxs to have a chance at catching a big fish. Eating the big fish, takes 1 less fish away each time someone thinks in a ""selfish"" matter for someone else to enjoy catching too. How many of you want to fish a lake full of little fish?"
568394,AllenW,2007-08-15 20:12:00,11482,"I think the error was the statement that big fish don't taste good, been doing this for well over 40 years and imho that ain't true. Not whether he's wiping out the fish in any particular lake. Some are mixing conservation with cooking, apples to oranges I think. I've read and heard from more than a few sources that large fish don't reproduce as well as younger ones do, can't remember the appox size they start falling off on egg production though..anybody?? Either way, a little good common sense goes a long way in fish management. Al"
568396,Guest,2007-08-15 20:48:00,0,"If you purposely keep a walleye over 27"" to eat then you should be put to sleep. Whether they taste better, worse or the same you should put them back for others to catch. And yes they do produce fewer viable eggs than a 21"" fish but that doesn't mean they should die. I think more people come to Canada with the hopes of catching a 30"" fish than a 21"" fish so let more people have the chance and put the big ones back...or be a hillbilly and continue to keep them. D"
568405,Guest,2007-08-16 08:10:00,0,"To answer the original question, I've found using a trailer hook will help you get more hook sets."
568410,Guest,2007-08-16 08:45:00,0,"Make sure you guys all pass up that 12 point buck this season, and only take the forks or less - afterall, those are the best breeders. It's up to the individual's morality, not yours. Legally, its ok. If the fisherman is ok with it, there's nothing (morally or legally) wrong with it. Make sure you put those 10 inch crappie back too, only keep the 6 inchers. Don't get a 20 pound turkey this Thanksgiving either, two 10-pounds will have to do. blah blah blah"

568418,Jimmy Jig,2007-08-16 12:11:00,1905,"Allen, to answer your question about the eggs not as good in a large walleye verus a small one. I called a retired hatchery manager I know and he said they never could tell that eggs were better from a smaller fish than a hog. A large walleye will put out about one quart and to equal that you would have to stripe three 21 inch fish. Same thing goes for musky also. So all this talk about big eyes eggs arn't fertile is BS. The orginal poster on here was talking about the Red River, not LS or LOTW, etc. These fish come out of Lake Winnepeg which is huge. Its commericaly fished and the indians gill net in the river all fall also and kept anything. So if someone wants to keep a 30 inch walleye to mount its probablly going to weight over 13-14 lbs., so what! No one can kept over ONE PER YEAR. By the way I've eat a few 8 lb. walleyes and they are not as good to eat as a 20 incher."
568423,lund115,2007-08-16 14:37:00,698,"He never said anything about eating them did he??? An individual can only keep one big fish a year. If you are worried about big fish being kept, you should be writing letters to Authorities, and get something done about all those fish that are being netted each fall. If every fisherman kept one over 28 inches, it wouldn't be a drop in the bucket compared to what is netted out. I go up there every year, and I would also be disappointed if this rule came into affect. I've caught plenty of 28+, and all but 1 went back in the water. The one is on my wall. This is the only fish I have ever kept over 23 inches. I will never keep another one unless it is 32+, and if I'm so lucky, I would like the opportunity to have the choice of putting it one my wall. To each his own. I don't agree with some one cleaning a big fish either, but I'm not busting anyone's chops about it either. If the law allows it, to each his own. To answer your question, Try short shank jigs or putting on a stinger hook. I also like to put the hook in through the mouth, out the gill, and then through the meat of the back behind the dorsal fin."
568424,Guest,2007-08-16 14:43:00,0,"Thanks for the two replys to my original question. Sad how this question has stirred emotions. Not my intent. I personally do not keep large fish, but take pictures and release. However if it is legal to keep a fish then so be it. Guess it was a rumor that everything 28 and over had to be put back. I was hoping that was true. I would prefer to see the bigger fish return to be caught again. Be nice."
568366,Guest,2007-08-14 18:09:00,0,"Last October, while fishing the Winnipeg River, at Selkirk, we heard that this year, anything 28 inches or over (Greenbacks), had to be returned to the water. Is this actually true? We will be there again, just after Canada's Thanksgiving. Also, how is everyone hooking those salted minnows. I lost a ton of fish from what I would describe as nibbling. Just couldn't figure out when to set the hook."
568372,Jimmy Jig,2007-08-14 19:27:00,1905,"I read the 2007 regulations as one walleye per year, 70 cm and over. That would the same as last year. The rule are at www.manitobafisheries.com"
568378,Guest,2007-08-15 07:01:00,0,Why would you want to keep anything that big anyway.They don't taste good at all.Let the big ones go.
568380,Guest,2007-08-15 10:52:00,0,"Any size walleye tastes good when battered and fried. If it's within the law, stop nagging him - he didn't ask for your opinion."

568385,Mohleye,2007-08-15 15:15:00,368,"So what's your point? If it tastes like a 16""er, why not eat a 16""er? If you can justify killing a brood fish to eat, just because it's legal, then I guess that's a choice you have to live with. None of the camps I've been to would invite you back, though."

568387,Guest,2007-08-15 16:06:00,0,"Ya know, I always thot that sportsmen were just that......SPORTSmen (or women). Where is the sport in eating a fish that is a reproducing female? Isn't the SPORT in catching the large fish and releasing theM, the brood stock so that you can continue to have SPORT fishing? I don't see a whole lot of posts on this forum from anyone bragging about the wonderful week they had in Canada catching 15 inchers! or the great fly-ins they went to and the ""lake was just full of small fish.....!"" If you keep the over 18 inch fish that is exactly what you will have. And if you think ""just one won't hurt"" your are just plain lazy and no SPORTSman in my book. I have no respect for people that continually think the rules aren't made for them and ""I paid all this money to go to Canada and I can keep whatever fish I want."" BTW.....we come 1600 miles every year from Colorado to fish Gull Rock. My family loves to fish and this year we are introducing our grandchildren to Canada and hopefully there will be ""big honeys"" for them to catch for years to come. That is unless some are unable to catch enuf small fish and have to eat a ""MOTHER"" to make their tummies feel better. Sorry about the sarcasm."
568389,10lbeye,2007-08-15 17:18:00,61,"I've both eaten(not often) and released(usually) bigger walleye. They are almost as good to eat as the small ones. I used to believe that releasing the big ones was promoting breeding. But I spoke to a camp owner who relayed to me that ministry officials had relayed to him that most of the big females lay sterile eggs, and that's why many slots are 16-22 for example. He was led to believe that these fish are the prime breeders. I simply pass it along for what it's worth. People who like to eat the bigger fish should not be criticized for doing so in my opinion, as long as the fish does not go to waste."
