567960,Guest,2007-07-31 17:51:00,0,"This weekend I spent some time trolling in big sand with a pearl white shad rap. I started at my typical spots ( closer to the big beach )and scratch a few in the middle of the day. Then I tried brushing my lure on the edge of various reefs and did much better. Again spent most of my time with a spinner looking for wandering fish or pockets of fish holding up, but in new locations. This ended up being the killer. In the waters heading up to big sand I found all kinds of places that I would typically drive past heading to the reefs. After all said and done I had to hit the reefs to catch some eater size fish. Because of people who feel they have to get married in the summer I'm missing the next 2 weekends of some of the most amazing fishing that I would drive past heading to the normal spots. If you have the time when your out look around. If it looks like a walleye shore it likly will be. On a note I had no real big one's this weekend, but had a few in the 25"" range Good luck"

We cought our fish in a spot right out front of a cabin. If you drive straight out of the River then head left as you get close to the north shore line you will see a red cabinin fron of that cabin there is a big rockand to the left of the cabin there is an good sized islandand then alittle further to the left is a big Bluff. we bottom bounced the area from the opisite side of the large rock from the cabin out past the Island and back.

567517,Guest,2007-07-18 21:23:00,0,"Our group heads up to Minaki next Saturday 7/28, I am looking for any recent reports on the walleye's and muskies. From what I hear the recent weather has been cool and rainy. Has the evening troll bite for walleye's started on Big Sand yet? What are the water levels like? Water temp? I have fished the area for over 30 years but left for a couple of years hoping that the system recovers. I love this area and hope to spend my summers up in the area when I retire. We will be staying at Paradise Park, if any members are interested in stopping by I will be in cabin #10, and I will have a cold one waiting for you, Thanks Brian Thomas"

567704,Guest,2007-07-23 09:50:00,0,"Fishing is as good as it gets out there right now. The last 4 days I did things different from what I would normaly do. I would pick a shore line and troll with a copper finish spinner in the 14' - 25' range and from what I can remember it was one of my personal best day ever for big walleye. I don't fish for muskey but our neibour and I went one morning for walleye and he managed a 47"" fish plus while landing several 20"" walleye big muskey where grabbing them. On previous weekends I had been spending most my time on little sand on humps and slot size fish were of plenty. This weekend I plan to try for suspended fish out on big sand"
567733,Guest,2007-07-24 08:29:00,0,Brian where were u trollin?
567744,Guest,2007-07-24 12:55:00,0,"I don't have my map in front of me so you'll have to forgive me for the lack of names for the islands. But I did real good along the north shore starting in little sand by the eagles nest on the point up to and along the cliff into big sand ( the wash tub I beleive they call it. I had a great morning in Pistol along the point in front of the beach. I picked up some nice one's in the very base on big sand along the big island's between little sand and big sand. Picked up 1 29+"" walleye along with a couple 26"" eye's there. The muskey came out from rough rock narrows, as well were the follow up. So with that being said we fished the last stretch of the narrows. I did spend about half an hour under the bridge and picked a couple of bigger slot size fish there. ( it's nice to have current once again). When the fishing was as good as it was it was a good time to hunt for new spots. As well I played with all colours for spinners and copper followed by darker colours were best. Snell lenght didnt seem to make a difference. Time of day was from 5:30 and was solid fishing till about 9 and started up again at 7 till dark. I guess if I didn't have to spend time with the family I could of hit the reefs in the day time. Hope that helps some"
567759,Guest,2007-07-24 20:10:00,0,"Yes guys the fishing has been great and is only getting better. I was up there last weekend and did very well, mostly humps and points and as well as the bridge. The trolling bite out in Big Sand is just starting. Was out there on Saturday night and caught 4 in about 1.5 hours, they were all around 25"". Tried all types of speeds and 2.4 mph was working great for me. Lots of guys are out in the evening trolling. In August, is when we should be catching the big females out there. Hope this helps you guys Good Luck"

We had a blast the weather was over 100 4 of our 6 days. The heat did not stop the bite at all. Evrey where we droped a line we caught fish. The most interesting was a spot in Rough Rock we bottom bounced a couple of humps from 20' to 50+ pulling slot eyes all day long out of the 50+' We also pulled some monster eyes off of what we call eagle point on Ltl Sand just off of the wash tub bay. Also the night troll on Big sand really started to produce some nice fish Friday was the best day Trolling #7 Glass Raps we pulled 23 fish in 4 hrs 16 -17 walleye between 24""- 30"" just Fat. Also about 6 Northern 30- 39"" and belive it or not a couple of smallies on the long line."
567941,Guest,2007-07-30 21:27:00,0,"Good Report, I Will be up at our cabin this long weekend and I think I will be doing alot of trolling in Big Sand. Are the fish still around the 10 - 15 foot mark? Will post when I get back. Hopefully some masters caught Thanks"
