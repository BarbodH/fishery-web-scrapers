It is an outstanding area and time slot. The cabin will accomodate six people. Our group has been going there for 10-12 years, but decided not to go back in 2008. If you would like to call Anderson's...1-800-465-1098 or me ...573-299-4853..I can tell you about the area. I don't have any interest in Anderson's but have been very satisfied with their service for many years. If you're looking for an outpost experience...here's a possibility"
