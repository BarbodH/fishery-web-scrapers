Some reports are that the water levels will be getting more normal, even better chance if they get some rain to go with all the snow on the ground. This was the report for Vermilion Bay area. Hope our Canadian friends keep us posted as we all like to know the progress."
538447,Guest,2004-03-25 05:54:00,0,Do you know where you are going fishing? Dryden and upsala are not exactly close to each other approx. 2hrs drive apart. The conditions should be good at this time. Bring sleds too much snow for quads. GOOD LUCK.

It should be milder, at least in the near future, which combined with the rain, will start to reduce the snow. It is still too early to make any practical estimates of ice out, but I would be very surprised if it is as late as spring 2002. For example, the majority of Lac Seul didn't open in 2002 until May 20-25. As I mentioned it is still early, but as of right now I would suspect ice out the first of May, perhaps earlier in areas closer to the border."
