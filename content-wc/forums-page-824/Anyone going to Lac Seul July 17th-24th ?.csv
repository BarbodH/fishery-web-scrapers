Dealer took care of both for me for me. The other problem was the big rock I hit last summer, not the boats fault! I am coming from Minnesota, about an hour north of Minneapolis. Joel"

I really don't want to ""discover"" any rocks with my new outboard.If you can supply the areas to avoid I can supply the blue 'pops'.Are you bringing your family or just the ""guys""."
538386,Guest,2004-03-22 12:47:00,0,"Blackjack, I have just gone by the map Andrea has given me at the resort. Problem was last year the water was down about 10 feet from where it was the year before. I don't think it is even possible to mark all the rocks in that lake, that's all there is. Probably why the walleyes like it so much! I will be up there with my Dad, two of his older brothers, my cousin , and a friend of mine and his dad. I think we have cabins #2 and #6. Look us up, we should be easy to find! Joel"

538263,Brax,2004-03-18 19:08:00,52,"Blackjack, I will be returning from Goosebay on July 11th. Look for my posting in the fishing reports forum the week before you go. Or you can email me at [email protected] the week before. Member MP3553 will be up there the week before me, so if I can hook up with him I will bribe him with a cold beer for the latest lake info."
538271,blackjack,2004-03-19 04:14:00,72,Thanks Brax TT

538278,Guest,2004-03-19 06:30:00,0,"my group will be at ear falls that week and we were there the same week last year. it's hard not to catch a lot of fish that time of year. weather should be mild. we mostly bottom bounce and rig for walleye. i would try to stay in the 12-20 foot range. when you locate them, jigging works fine. i like nightcrawlers that time of year, but minnows work fine. the windy side of goose island holds some numbers of walleye. to get some consistantly nicer fish take a run down to steamboat and points south. if you are after northern, they are everywhere. just find a weedbed and start throwing a number 5 mepps. hard too keep them off the line. good luck."
