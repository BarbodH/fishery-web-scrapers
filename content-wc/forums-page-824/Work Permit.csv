They are going to raffle off a trip and I am going to take them fishing. (short version of story) Do you need a work permit or anything special to do this? I will not be making any money on this but not spending any either, the club is paying my expenses only. This is not a done deal just checking to see if it is worth the hassle. Thanks for the help"
538443,Mahumba,2004-03-24 21:18:00,345,I would assume the club is paying for your travel and room and board. Therefore you are their guest. So I don't think anyone would mind if you took someone fishing with you or you tagged along with someone else. It's all in how you word it I guess. Roger Mayer.

I would consider it a transaction that took place outside Canada anyways, unless the guys you're taking out are Canadians. You're not working for a Canadian company, and you're not providing your service to Canadians so you don't need a work permit."
