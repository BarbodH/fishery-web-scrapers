538507,Guest,2004-03-29 16:48:00,0,"We did some fishing in North Bay (McCleods)last year and had a blast catching smallies! Well, some did. I couldn't to save my life. The only one in the group. Brings back bad memories. Where's Cliff?"
538517,Guest,2004-03-29 20:25:00,0,"Yep, Devil's point is one of my Fav's but like I said before, it's a little longer haul up to that end of the Lake from Jim's camp. I usually think of all the fish i'm boating over when I go that far away from the south end. On the flip side, it's a short jaunt to moose bay, keynote, aerobus bay, and north bay.... A little less pressure, a little less crowded. If you're after Walleye in late July and the bite is off you may have to go up around Devil's to get em. Cliff lake is on the highway south of Wabaskang. You've passed it and seen it if you've been to Wabaskang. Contains nice smallies too."
538523,Trailerguy,2004-03-30 07:29:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]When you fished Aerobus Lake, you went out Aerobus road about 27K to launch. Going south on 105 you probably remember Jacks' Campground and a little farther a launch site beside the hwy. That's one way into Cliff Lake. Going on south you'll find Deer Lake Road, follow it west about 2K and you'll drive along side the deep end (100+) of Cliff, there's a launch site there too."

538547,Guest,2004-03-30 19:56:00,0,"What I meant to say was,.... trailerguy, or AB, I am going to tall pines for the 1st time in July. can you tell me where the other ""camps' are located on the Wabaskang? thanks"
538551,Trailerguy,2004-03-31 06:18:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b] Gawley's and Kingfisher are a stones throw south of Tall Pines. Wine Lake's landing is close by as well, but they travel the lenght of the lake NW to portage to camp. Lundy's is to the NW, on the ""big"" section of the lake, 1/2 dozen miles distant by water. Sleepy Dog Cabins are located just south of the 1st narrows. Jim & Julies are located to the SW about 2 miles."
538564,Guest,2004-03-31 21:48:00,0,"Along with Trailerguy's description's is Daves Wilderness camp on the big, main body of water up by Lundy's. I believe Gawley once owned it before moving to his present location. There is a bay up there some call Gawley's bay ( others call it the flats ) which is nowhere near Gawley's present day camp but was when he was at where Dave's is now. I believe 7 camps in all."

538607,Guest,2004-04-02 06:37:00,0,"thank you for the camp info trailerguy,& AB. also, with about 7 camps on this water,what kind of boat traffic can I expect in july? how is the walleye,pike,& lake trout fishing in july, on Wabaskang? (you can also reach me at, [email protected]) thanks fellas!"
538608,Trailerguy,2004-04-02 08:36:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Boat traffic isn't that bad, it's a big lake,except for the 1st narrows about dusk,lol. Everybody bunches up there, not wanting to call it a day until they just have too. We always go up over the 4th, fishing is always good, but it helps to know where to look for them too."
538467,Guest,2004-03-27 15:16:00,0,"Been going to Lake Wabaskang for a few years now, and I've stayed at Kingfisher and Tall Pines. I'm thinking about staying at Jim & Julies next time. Anyone ever stayed there, and how did you like it? They say they're a fishing ""camp"", not a ""resort""??."
538468,Trailerguy,2004-03-27 15:48:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I have a cottage on Wabaskang, so I've not stayed there. However I can tell you they have a nice clean camp and a good reputation. The only negative thing I've heard was last year, when the water was at a record low level, their dock was mostly in very shallow water. But I was told they received a large floating section late in the season, which fixed the dock problem. Wabaskang is a large lake with at least seven sections, Pike, walleye, smallies, trout,whitefish and perch of course. I would say their camp appears ""newer"" than Kingfisher and not quite as ""new"" as Tall Pines."
538469,Guest,2004-03-27 17:01:00,0,"Thanks for the info! If I'm guessing right, aren't those the red cabins not too far from the Ruby Lake area?"
538470,Guest,2004-03-27 19:50:00,0,"Yes, they are near what you call Ruby lake at the South end of the lake. A ""fishing camp"" not a ""resort"" means this isn't the place that will cater to your every whim. In other words it is a small camp not like the big ones on LOTW.They will take good care of you though but you will have to do some things on your own. It is an older camp but the cabins are nicely spread apart and the scenery is wonderful since it is on a hill overlooking the lake. It is on the South end of the lake so it is a little farther jaunt to big wabby but there is also good fishing in the bays on the South end. You will have to walk or drive down the hill to get to the dock. The camp does have a small store with groceries/bait/license/ice etc. I think it is great and have stayed there many times. My greatest experience has been to get acquainted with the camp owners of lodges and let them enhance your fishing experience with their knowledge. This is what I recommend to others going to Canada. Find a good camp and stay with it. Why have you moved around to different camps in the past? BTW- the dock area was dredged last fall and new docks put in - very nice."
538471,Trailerguy,2004-03-27 19:54:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Yes, Ruby is just around the point, but it is very shallow, about 10'in the close end. Keynote is a little farther to the SW, the close end of it is also shallow, with wild rice,it's supose to be a Muskie spot according to the MNR. But farther down there's decent depths and I've caught nice walleye and perch in several places. I hope to explore Keynote more this summer, I suspect there may be deep water and trout on the SE portion, but I haven't been able to find a map with depths on it."
538474,Guest,2004-03-27 21:02:00,0,"Sounds like a great camp. Good news about the docks. I heard that they had to close camp early last year because of the low water levels, and they couldn't get their boats to the docks. The lake was 6 foot low when we were there last June. Lots of ""new"" rocks. Like I said, we've stayed at Kingfisher and Tall Pines previously. Not that we didn't like them, we just want to check some others out before we decide on one to stick with. Thanks for the information!"
538475,Guest,2004-03-27 21:26:00,0,"We ran into some very shallow water last year in Ruby. Not really fishable. Had some good luck there though in 02' fishing for perch. 1 boat from our party did make it over to Keynote last year, even with the shallow water. We had the same problem not being able to find a map with good topo readings. The only place we did any fishing for trout was in Aerobus(?)lake. Spent about 1/2 day there and ran out of patience, not even a sniff. Might devote a bit more time to that along with Keynote next trip. How's the pike fishing up there in July/August? Or just the fishing in general? We usually go in June and focus on walleye, smallies, and perch."
538480,Guest,2004-03-28 15:50:00,0,Good fishing for Perch in Keynote and Ruby (we call it moose bay). There are some walleye and Northerns in Keynote too. Never caught a muskie anywhere on Wabby but used to see some brought in back in the 70's. Lakers in late July are really tough to catch. Some smallie action in Aerobus and on the rocky shore on both sides of the bay where Jim's camp is. Some pike and walleye action in McCleod's bay (we call it North bay). As you can tell there is a little different lingo for locations at Jim's camp then from the other camps. If you are camping I'd say Jim has one of the better campgrounds. The cabins might not rank with Tall Pines but they are spread out better.... Search the archives for past reports of Late July fishing on Wabaskang or let me know if you need anything else.
538484,Trailerguy,2004-03-29 05:45:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I know Areobus is primarily a trout lake, but if I was seriously looking for trout in July I'd go to Cliff. It has good numbers and is easier to access. But even Wabby will give some up with a downrigger. I like Mc Cleod's, and the bay Areobus creek runs into."
538505,Guest,2004-03-29 16:35:00,0,"Thanks, AB. I really appreciate all the info. We really like Wabaskang, and will probably be going up there for years to come. By the way, ever have any luck at Devils Point? Maybe you call it something else. It's on the other end before you get to Lundy's."
