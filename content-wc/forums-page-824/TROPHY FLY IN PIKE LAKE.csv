538596,Guest,2004-04-01 10:11:00,0,Alright...Knee Lake is a little expensive. But not much more than Scott Lake Lodge and Wollaston Lake Lodge in northern Sask. How about Aikens Lake Lodge or Bolton Lake Lodge in Manitoba?
538599,Guest,2004-04-01 11:48:00,0,"I know of a trophy pike lake that's about 30 minute plane ride NW of Nestor falls, Ontario. No lodges no cabins no boats no nothing......I did it as a one day fly in just so the flying service (that has since changed hands) could see what was in the lake. I had 17lb trilene fishing line with a leader broke four times. Landed 12 pike over 35 inches with the biggest being 43 inches. This was 10 years ago and you could easily fish this small lake in a days time. Of coarse we told the flying service we didn't catch anything because we wanted to keep it a secret. I've never been back although I want to go. If your interested in the name of the lake shoot me an E-mail at [email protected]."
538600,Guest,2004-04-01 11:51:00,0,correction.....the larget pike caught was 48 inches not 43. We estimated that it weighed close to 35-40 lbs. This girl was FAT!
538603,Atlanta Dave,2004-04-01 15:30:00,323,"Find it hard to believe a 48 inch pike, which is a beaUTY, could weigh over 30lbs. just my 2 cents worth Atlanta dave"
538604,Guest,2004-04-01 19:01:00,0,"I think God's River Lodge on God's Lake is awesome. Last spring, my son and I spent 5 days up there and we caught master angler pike, whitefish, walleyes and brook trout. Ya, the fishing was incredible and the people were genuine. The location situated at the head waters of God's River is ideal. For the two of us, I spent about $600 round trip from Chicago to Winnepeg and the lodge was about $1500 apiece for the five days. What a great trip!"
538605,pike nut,2004-04-01 19:07:00,23,"Dave, I have seen 48 inch over 30lbs in august after she had all spring and most of summer to forage on setting net lake in NW ontario. My buddy got a 47 on Misaw in late july last year that was very close to 30lbs."
538609,Guest,2004-04-02 09:26:00,0,"Another lodge to consider is Tetu Island Lodge. The fall pike fishing on the English and Winnipeg rivers is fantastic. Caught two 46"" and several 40"" to 44"" last fall. Great camp that focuses on Pike in the fall."
538615,scar,2004-04-02 16:43:00,196,"check out boois.com we go every year for walleyes and accidentally catch huge pike every year. our biggest is 45'' and 27lbs. it was a hog. evert year we catch 2 -3 20lbs plus fish and never fish for them.i saw one once that pushed fifty. i have lots of pictures to back this up. boois is located on trout lake and is a short 15 minute flight out of red lake ontario. the flight puts you on over 100,000 acres of water that can't be driven to. lake trout and walleye are huge and a no brainer to catch either. e-mail me if you want more info. scar"
538616,Atlanta Dave,2004-04-02 17:57:00,323,"Pike man I normaly fish far north in mid June the 2nd week the camp is open have caught many pike over 20 lbs. We do not measure many at this camp but have several that were at least 47"" and most they have weighed is 26 lbs. I under stand this is early and these fish will put on wieght by Aug but to get a 47 or 48 to 30 lbs seems a stretch. The lake we fish has, in my opinion compared to the other lakes and rivers we have fished, heavy fish for the lenght . We have fished some very highly regarded Pike waters . Just my thoughts Atlanta dave"
538617,lobo1,2004-04-02 22:55:00,734,"A Dave, We have caught quite a few larger fish out of the same camp that Pike Nut refers to. These are heavy fish with very thick shoulders - most 36"" pike can not be taken by the shoulders by me - even with big hands. We had one fish 47+"" 2 years ago that was just a hair under 30#. Might take me a while but can probly round you up a picture of this bigger fish - unfortunately is was not mine :) - released of coarse. lobo1"
