537933,Guest,2004-03-04 19:05:00,0,Ned Needler kind of says it all...lol
537934,bigfish1965,2004-03-04 19:19:00,3210,Easier for me to spot smart-azz Canadian posts since I'm one (smart-azz Canadian) myself! ;) I actually catch flack for playing along sometimes.
537944,Guest,2004-03-05 08:40:00,0,Me too. This board is way more FUN than the rest.
537954,George Eh,2004-03-06 07:11:00,76,">This was a TROLL. Ya got me Ned }(, just hope I can return the favor sometime eh! ;-) I hope spring comes soon also. George"

537959,Guest,2004-03-06 11:02:00,0,"Canada money varies in value to the US dollar. Usually it will cost less in American $. That is an item costing $100 C. might be bought for $65 A. ...now the ""metric"" system is what confuses me. Knowing it is based on 10's 100's and 1,000's.....Would 2000 mocking birds be ""Two Kila-Mockingbird""? And in Canada are there only 10 cards in a ""deca cards""?"
537960,Guest,2004-03-06 12:15:00,0,Sounds like someone needs to get out fishing soon...lol
537963,Guest,2004-03-06 13:13:00,0,"You are partially correct. In New Foundland, however, Two Kila Mockingbird equals ""1:30 Kila Mockingbird""."

537893,phern,2004-03-02 22:24:00,151,"If you want the best ""exchange rate"" for each dollar you spend....use your credit card for all of your transactions. Credit card companies always use up to date conversion rates. Carry a bit of cash with you. You can go to any bank and exchange your American money to Canadian money. The fees to exchange money are very low and maybe even be a free service. Every bank has a sign showing the exchange rates for that day. No banks have the same schedule concerning ""banking hours"" so the best time is during the week between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. All the banks are open at this time."

537899,nemio,2004-03-03 12:05:00,96,You're absolutly right Phern. Do exactly that when I go fishing on the US side myself.
537900,Guest,2004-03-03 12:31:00,0,"I don't think you've really been in Canada. It's ""Holy smokes, this is the right change, eh""? Make sure you nod your head, when you hit the ""eh"", otherwise they'll think you're from France. lol"
537901,Guest,2004-03-03 12:35:00,0,"How about those other responders' reading comprehension? They bit pretty good, didn't they? You did good bf1965."
537904,fishmaster,2004-03-03 17:34:00,209,bigfish1965 GREAT ANSWER!!!! You put some thought into that one.
537905,Guest,2004-03-03 18:01:00,0,"For years I was worried about, the exchange rate given, did I get the right change back?, whats that a price per gallon?. Now I have come to the realization that I will always be taking it in the shorts. Our group actually finds humor in who took it the worst. No sense in sweating the extra $20 that you were screwed out of. Knowing this going in and accepting it is going to allow you to fully enjoy your vacation."
537907,George Eh,2004-03-03 19:15:00,76,">I am trying to get this conversion straight. When I go to >Canada what is a Canadian dollar worth? >When in Canada how much is in a litre? >How do I know if I got the right change? >(I am talking about the part of Canada above North Dakota). Check out this site http://www.thetacklehouse.com/convert.html for the up to date dollar conversion. 1 liter equals 33.8 ounces or 1 gallon equals 3.785 liters and 1 mile equals 1.6 kilometers. The quickest way to convert the speed limit is to multply the km/hr times 6, in other words 100 kph is equal to 60 mph. You might want to use the same conversion for our Canadian beer, if you are used to 10 American drink only 6 Canadian as ours have more 'pop'. :) Enjoy the trip."
537918,Guest,2004-03-04 09:45:00,0,"George, do you think the folks in North Dakota should be worried? If part of Canada is really ""above"" them. It might fall to the ground some day and squash North Dakota. :) A litre is a litre, no matter where you are. In Canada, a Canadian dollar (looney) is worth a dollar. One would only know if he got correct change (not EXchange)if one can add and subtract. This was a TROLL. Bigfish 1965, Atlanta Dave, and Jim H recognized it. (Sorry winter is so long, eh?)"
537928,Guest,2004-03-04 15:47:00,0,"I enjoyed your troll ned, I couldn't believe how many thought it was serious. Long Long winter although in southern ohio I will be fishing soon. eric"

537888,bigfish1965,2004-03-02 16:46:00,3210,"The Canadian dollar is worth approximately one third a beer. There are two hours of trolling in a litre. To know if you got the right change ask the person who gave it to you.. ""Is this the right change?"" The rules are similar across the country."

537891,rebelrn2001,2004-03-02 20:29:00,1563,Last I checked (about 1 wk ago) it was $1 US to $1.34 +- C.

537892,Guest,2004-03-02 20:43:00,0,"When in Canada, a canadian dollar is worth a dollar. An American dollar in Canada is worth about $1.34 in Canadian funds. There are 3.72 liters to a U.S. gallon so a liter is a little more than a quart. The parts of Canada I frequent all count back the change when I make a purchase, just like in the U.S. If your question is how do I know what conversion factor have they given me, well, ask first. Most places give 125 or for each U.S. dollar you recieve $1.25 value in Canadian funds. Many border towns now will keep U.S. change and if you pay in U.S. they give U.S. in change, then there's no problem with the conversion."
