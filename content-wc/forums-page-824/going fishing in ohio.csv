538437,Guest,2004-03-24 11:28:00,0,I know its a canadian board but warmer weather is here in southern ohio and i will try to catch a few eyes this friday. Trying to make some of you jealous that still have hard water and cold temps. Only 2 months and 4 days until I leave for the first of 4 week long canadian trips. Can't wait for that. Eric
