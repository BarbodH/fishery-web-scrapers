538464,Guest,2004-03-27 09:04:00,0,Where are the boat launching points below the dam at Ear Falls? Are they hard to find? How close to the Dam can you fish from a boat? Thanks

You will go through a residential area of 2-3 blocks, then you will come to a fork in the road, go left approximately 200-300 yards. You're there! If you miss it, green fees are reasonable."
538478,Guest,2004-03-27 23:55:00,0,when all else fails in catching the fish this is the place to go. We went there only once and filled our limits from zero for 2 people in half a day. this is a hot area and we used leaches for the walleyes and northerns. I wish we had known of this earlier in our visits to ear falls. there will probably be a bunch of boats there already so just get in the middle of them and have fun.
538483,Guest,2004-03-28 23:05:00,0,i do believe the limits or size restrictions do not apply below the dam. I just think that you better check to make sure though.
538485,Trailerguy,2004-03-29 05:48:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]I would think that below the dam would be part of the English River? So the restrictions from Lac Suel would not apply?

538532,68 starcraft,2004-03-30 13:51:00,32,"Made my own fish cleaning station out of a sheet of teflon, either throw away the scraps or feed them to the neighboring stray dog or cat. Just kidding!!!!!!! Allready talked with the owner or hotel we can clean fish outside and dispose of scraps in there dumpster and keep our fish frozen in the freezer or the restaurant."
