But I would like to know if any of you out there have been to this lodge to fish. We will be going in late June. The last time I fished this end of Lac Suel it was early June and we caught fish, but alot of smaller fish and we had to boat a long distance to the fish. Can anybody share their experience with me? Thanks in advance."

538169,Guest,2004-03-15 09:33:00,0,We have been going to scout lake resort for the last 7 years in August and this will be the 8th. We have always caught fish both on scout lake and on lac suel. We have gone a long distance over to McKiknze bay and a much shorter distance out to the bay of islands. It doesn't seem to matter which one you fish you'll catch your share of all sizes of fish. I think you'll find the fishing great and the resort the same. Rollie has very nice cabins and his equipment is first rate. We have never had a problem with either...Good luck.

They need to landscape, knock down some trees so the lake can be seen from the cabins and plant some grass. We had muddy walks to our cabin every day. The boat died every minute when backtrolling. We complained to the owner, who rolled his eyes and did nothing to correct it. He was just plain dude most of the rest of the week. As for the fishing, for the first five days, we went where the guide showed us to fish, which was about an hour ride away. On the last few days, we fast trolled around Scout in early morning and after dinner and caught probably 30 pike in two hours, and several walleye with size. The large 8"" Rapala in red and gold was key. If you want a fun trip, pack the coolers, and bring the shorelunch kit to Sunlight Lake. It takes about an hour fifteen, but it was worth it. There is a island in the north part of Sunlight. Park your boats on the North side where there is this nice shelf that is perfect for a shorelunch. There is a rocky/sandy slope on the whole north side that the walleye sit on. We went there two days and caught hundreds right from shore with slip bobbers and leaches. It was about the best days of fishing I have ever had."
