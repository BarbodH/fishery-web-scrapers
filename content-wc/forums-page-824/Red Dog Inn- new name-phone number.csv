538488,Guest,2004-03-29 09:14:00,0,We used to stay at the Red Dog Inn on our yearly trip and I have found that the place changed names and owners. Can anybody provide the new name and a number I can call for reservations?

I have heard of others losing gear. If you are referring to the one in International Falls/ Ft Francis, I would stay elsewhere."
