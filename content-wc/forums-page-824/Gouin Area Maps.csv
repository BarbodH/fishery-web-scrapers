At a recent Outfitter Show, one Gouin Reservoir outfitter showed me a map in order to provide driving directions. The map was a map of all the forestry roads around the Gouin Reservoir. This map is available at http://www.tourismehsm.qc.ca/principale_ang.html Once on the site, click on ""map of territory"". The map that you see on that page is available in a 3' X 3' paper version (in colour). The other side of the map, although not shown on the web site concentrates more on just the Reservoir area. The map is available for $6 Cdn. To order, just click on ""Buying Maps"" and order ""Forestry Roads Map of La Tuque"". I'm sure that all routes to Gouin outfitters are well marked. However, I like to be aware as much as I can about the territory I'm traveling in. If you share that interest, you would probably enjoy this map. If not, you only wasted 30 seconds."

The map is updated with all the access to Gouin and all the outfitters and restaurants on the way up to the Gouin. It is virtually indestructible, waterproof and tearproof. You can't go wrong, if they still have them in stock"

Perhaps you wouldn't mind elaborating on the name of the map to which you refer and how one obtains it. Your post indicates that there is a more informative map available than the one I referenced, and if such is the case, I'd appreciate knowing how to obtain it. Thanks in advance."

538434,Guest,2004-03-24 09:37:00,0,"Went to the office today and the map I was refering to is inside the Tourist brochure. It is in the center of the book and has a lot of information and is free. you can order it at: Tourisme Haut-St Maurice 445 Lacroix st La Tuque Qc Canada G9X 1V8 I believe you can also order it over the phone (819) 523-6111 ext 414 This book is known as Brochure touristique, Tourist brochure and is both in french and english, although there is a few mistakes in the translation, you will get all the information needed to plan a good trip enjoy it"
