If border crossing is an issue this year where would you suggest in Minnesota that would compare? Would the Minnesota side of LTW be comparable? Hopefully the crossing will not be an issue, but just in case I need some ideas."

The walleye fishing has really rebounded in the last 10 or 15 years, the smallmouth fishing is outstanding, and the northern fishing is good as well. All that being said, I no longer go to Rainy. Now my group goes to LOTW. But, Rainy isn't a bad choice if you want to or need to stay on this side of the border."
