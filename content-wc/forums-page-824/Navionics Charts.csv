I want to buy the MMC card for lake ERIE, but, I want ALL of lake Erie. I just bought a NEW X-15MT & a Globalmap system and now cannot get the electronic charts for ANY Canadian waters. BECAUSE SOMEBODY IN CANADA WANTS MORE MONEY!!!!! The Canadian Government needs to think about getting involved with this TIFF over the rights to re-produce the navigational charts for the Great Lakes. x("

538436,Guest,2004-03-24 11:04:00,0,"I was at Bass Pro last night and looked at the Nav chips. I had the sales guy put the chip from region 12 (out of stock on region 9) in a X-15mt. I then picked a lake and started to zoom in. The closest you could zoom in was .56 miles. Is the Wisconsin chip the same way? If that's as close as you can get, I don't see a big advantage over a paper map. I might be better off with the Lake Master CD set and just download waypoints to my Lowrance. Any thoughts from people who are actually using these chips?"
538438,Tyee Guy,2004-03-24 12:53:00,717,The demo chips I saw went down to 1/4 to 1/8 mile depending on the lake.......I was impressed as I know the lake he demoed very well.......
538440,orchard frank,2004-03-24 14:32:00,1900,"The zoom depends on the data available. On the L. Mich chip the harbors and municipal areas zoom real close, .1 or less. On the open water the zoom might only go to .5 Good Luck"
