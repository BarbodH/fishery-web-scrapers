We have not been back but once in the last 8 years but some of our group had continued to go and are switching this year. Can not expllain how it could change so much but we went from 500 eyes in a week for 5 guys to 50. The camp we stayed at, Smith Bay, was well run all facilities excellent it was just the fishing that changed where we go.If you are going to Kip I strongly recommentd this camp. Good luck with your trip and please post your results. Atlanta dave"

538393,Guest,2004-03-22 14:23:00,0,My dad and some buddies just were there last fall and said it was really slow untill the last day there. He also said that the lodge operator left his son in charge and the kid was a real dumb-#### (kipawa outfitters)
538539,Guest,2004-03-30 17:12:00,0,"Well, I've been to Lake Kipawa the past four (4) years in June (2x), July, and August. This year we're going in early-Sept just to shake things up a bit. We've always had success no matter what time of year we go. I've heard the horror stories about slow fishing, can't catch anything, nothing is biting...etc. etc. etc. We have had nothing but huge success on the lake on ALL of our trips up there. Lots of walleye...and bigger last year than ever. Big pike, though not big numbers. And good lake trout that is fairly easy to catch. On a typical morning, I myself will catch 20-30 walleyes, with my buddies doing about the same. The evenings are just as productive...mid-day can also be good if you go deep...AND know what you're doing. From what I know (and I share a lot of experiences and read a lot about fishing in Lake Kipawa), most people that don't catch much simply don't know what they're doing. They likely don't have the right technique, tackle, and aptitude to ""read"" the lake, conditions...etc. This isn't 1954...you just don't throw some string over the side and catch lunkers. If you know how to fish for walleyes, where to find them given the conditions you're are faced with weatherwise...you'll have a great trip. We've stayed at Corbeau Lodge in the past, but I'm sure there are many great outfitteres on the lake. Hope this helps."
538558,Atlanta Dave,2004-03-31 14:43:00,323,T bone your saying that you catch 40 to 60 walleye a day? What part of the lake are you fishing? How deep are you catching the trout and what is the average size? I have heard the pike fishing is better than it was was in earlier years. Do you park at the lot at the end of the logging road to get to your camp? Atlanta dave

538572,Guest,2004-04-01 07:09:00,0,"Yes Dave...there are days that I go out and catch 40-50 walleye a day. And I'll say once you figure out the depth and structure that the walleye are on, it's like shooting fish in a barrel. This requires qualification though. That's not everyday...some days each guy may only catch 20 walleyes, on tough days maybe only 10-15. But overall we realize much success on Lake Kipawa. As I stated, you have to know what you're doing. We are in camp with others stating they are catching nothing. The next morning we see them follow us out, they'll park their $25G boat right next to us, and still catch nothing while we reel them in one after next. It's partly about being on the 'spot-on-the-spot'. It's mostly about having a very tight presentation. I exclusively use 1/8 oz. jigs with a curly tail or fuzzee body and about 1/3 crawler. Chartreuse/chartrueuse is my bread-n-butter, but pink/white will also take fish. And just pulling the jig up and down doesn't get it. Let's see, in June we get walleye anywhere from 2'-3' (very early AM, very late PM) to about 13'. The active fish move up and down across this depth. In July...deeper...out to about 36'. In August, anywhere from 20'-28'. The structure is the key...rock sand mix close to deep (60'+) water. Again, let me say that we work to find these spots. Using a map to ID locations then running over these locations with our depth finder and testing areas. Once we ID a pattern, we narrow it down to the ""best locations"" for the pattern. As I said, you don't just go out there and throw a jig over the side anywhere and expect to get fish. We fish out of Corbeau Lodge, and that the central part of the lake...the middle of the X. Sunnyside, Sand Banks, Corbeau Pointe, Dead Bear Bay are the popular spots. We tend to find our own hot-spots near these locations and have them to ourselves. For Corbeau Lodge you park in Kipawa and water taxi to the lodge. Nice, remote location...very beautiful. We fish for lakers for fun to waste time in mid-day or if we're bored catching 'eyes. We anchor in about 50'-70' of water on a ledge...chuck a big piece of dead herring on a spinner or spoon over the side and work it until something nails it. Lazy fishing. Average size I would say is about 2-3 lbs. Biggest we got were an 8 lbr. in 2002 and we got a 12 lbr. in 2003...nice fish. We don't spend much time fishing for lakers...maybe 10 hours all week. I've done the downriggers...etc. before. Too much work for not enough success. We had some success with pike, but not great success. What has been caught has been big (36""+), and we've lost some other nice ones too. Typical spots for those...shallow bays near deeper water. Depth dependant upon time of year. June = shallow. July / August = 15'+. Let me know if you need any more info...I'm glad to help."

Is it more productive to go on the opener or wait to like early June? And has anybody stayed here http://www.chaletsduhuard.com Please email me at [email protected] if you prefer. Thanks Again Greg"

537866,retire55,2004-03-01 08:29:00,1029,"Hi Greg: Our group has been fishing Lake Kipawa for 4 years. Our primary prey has been walleyes but we fish for lake trout during the day. Both fisheries are healthy. Its a big lake, some 50 miles long. Its shape loosely resembles a big X and its deepest water is at 325 feet. I can not speak to the success of fishing at the opener or in early June as we have never fished during those times. Third week of May usually finds our group speckled trout fishing and early June represents a potential battle with black flies. Early July has been our choice for 4 years but this year we have opted to fish in September to beat the heat of summer. You will able to find more answers to your questions by visiting http://www.kipawa.net/ There is no search function working, consequently, you will need to peruse through the postings as well as the archived postings.

537873,Ruddiger,2004-03-01 19:26:00,649,"We stayed at Lake Kipawa (in Quebec) in 1997 and I consider it to be one of the worst fishing trips that I have ever been on. We went up there the second week of August for northerns and walleye and it was SLOW!!! The camp we stayed at was Three Seasons Camps. If I ever was to go back I would realy encourage you to go as early in the season as possible so that you could target most species when they are shallow. A lot of waters in Quebec have been pounded and you need to get every advantage that you can over the fish. It is a classic oligotrophic lake and unless you are really geared for a deep water bite you may not be happy later in the season. Also, I am convinced that the owner of the resort sent my dad and I on a lengthy ""Portage"" that he had an ATV trail to from his dock, but that is another story all together. I hope this helps, and best of luck to ya!"
