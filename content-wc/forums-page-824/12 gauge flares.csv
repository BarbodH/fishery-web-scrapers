538452,jake,2004-03-25 21:12:00,1694,"what's the scoop on this size flare gun in canadian waters? i heard that law enforcement considers them an illegal weapon. are all flare guns outlawed or is there any loophole because or their use as safety equipment? what about the 25 mm size? i spend a lot of time on erie and would like to upgrade from handheld flares, but i also fish and travel in canadian waters and don't want to get sent to the penalty box for a major. ""ya' don't need a weathervane to know which way the wind blows"""
538453,Guest,2004-03-25 21:37:00,0,I was told its a safety device for on the water and its OK.
538454,PJM,2004-03-25 23:17:00,3516,"jake Last summer I was on a lake in Ontario and the police stopped me and my 75 year old dad on a Sunday out in the middle on nowhere at like 8:30pm which suprised me and wanted to no what I had in my cooler and other things. So after digging though my cooler which was full of ice and fish he found a bottle of beer at the botom and gave me a speech about it and told that he could fine me for it and make me go in. So he asked me what else I had in the boat, and I have nothing to hide so I invited him in, but he just asked me to open up a few compartments and there was the flare gun and I asked him about it and he said it was fine and had no problem with it. I did offer him the beer if he had a problem with it in the boat, but he did not take it. The beer I understand is illegal to have in the boat and I was not drinking but that one bottle was an issue for him and not the flare gun. Lake Erie might be different but that was my experience with the flare gun and it is a 12ga"
538455,Trophymuskie,2004-03-26 05:56:00,254,I don't think they are ilegal yet but they are recomending going to rocket flare as the shotgun ones are junk. The way the guy explained it is a rocket flare will go up 400 meters and very bright and the shotgun flares were junk and he would not want to be stranded in the middle of lake Erie with them. Keep releasing them all Richard Collin

Canadian charter of rights and freedoms line 8. "" Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure. "" We don't live in a police state. If the police think they needed a search warrant, they can get one by phone in a few minutes. I doubt a judge will allow a warrant without a good reason."
538462,Matches,2004-03-26 21:48:00,236,"Phern is right about they have to have reasonable ground to search. It sounds like he asked PJM, but PJM I suppose could have told him to get lost. Maybe one bottle of beer was reasonable grounds? I don't know. PJM, next time you're in Canada, sounds like you better have the name and number of a defense attorney with you!

538476,PJM,2004-03-27 22:53:00,3516,Matches You are pretty funny and you remind me of a guy I know. Thanks for your reply and when I go fishing in September I will remember this post.
538481,Guest,2004-03-28 18:34:00,0,"Probably a real good idea. Normally you'd be put in jail until Monday or Tuesday or untill you missed your ride whichever comes first. They can search you any time they want if you have fishing gear or say that you have been fishing...because of game laws. If you have no gear and have not been fishing they have no right to search you. They will ask to search and you can decline. Standard procedure is "" will you open that cooler for me please"". You can decline if you like and he may back down. Make sure your paperwork is in order."

The US Coast Guard guys are great and love fish talk, but the border guys all look pissed that they aren't somewhere warmer. Sure you have rights, but the smart person picks the right occasion to envoke them."
