Was there a month ago, and, given the duration of construction projects in Sioux Lookout, I'm not really expecting much change. Seems like whatever they do, it takes at least the whole warm weather season.... Any updates? Leaving again in 4 days. Thanks, Guys!!"
4980897,redryder,2016-07-11 10:15:00,33,Be prepared for the same plus it has expanded to the other entry into town at King and 1st ave.
4980913,stjoeguy,2016-07-11 10:16:00,979,Still under construction as of July 2. Here's an article with a detour map:http://www.siouxlookout.ca/en/your-l...es-Project.pdf
4981089,bigwalleye1,2016-07-11 11:59:00,2632,"Thanks, guys. Had the rare opportunity to pull a boat through that $hitstorm on the last trip, so at least I'm prepared with a different fuel stop that avoids the mess altogether, but it looks like Sioux is in for a long construction season.Now to find a way to the grocery store....I will say, though, that the King and First area WAS in desperate need of a makeover. Question the ability of the construction team to handle two projects at once, in light of the bridge repair fiasco of last summer on the eastern edge of town."
4981537,tv4fish,2016-07-11 14:52:00,2694,NO problemo Big --- When you come back from Deception Bay - turn right (west) right before you cross the RR bridge- you know that darn rough road past the lumber yard -- just keep going and you will recognize the Grocery store parking lot on your RH side - Yup - get yourself some potato salad to go with that evening meal of walleyes that I am SURE you are planning..............
4981921,jimirjr,2016-07-11 18:32:00,1149,Is there anywhere left in Sioux Lookout that You can get a good dinner?
4982009,stjoeguy,2016-07-11 19:23:00,979,Forest Inn is good.
4982473,bigwalleye1,2016-07-12 06:09:00,2632,"TV, it sounds like that King and First intersection is also ripped up. That is our normal way in, and Wellington our normal way out, with a fuel stop. I know the station south of Siuox at the Hudson turnoff has non-ox fuel, but it doesn't have diesel. The truck has a decided preference for diesel!!"
4982953,pjshorthorn,2016-07-12 10:30:00,5654,The station at the turnoff for Hudson may have diesel. It used to be called Fred and Dee's. Just a thought. PjShorthorn
4983049,bigwalleye1,2016-07-12 11:05:00,2632,"Thanks, PJ, but Nah, they didn't a month ago. I was forced to drop the boat to go to Sioux to get it."
