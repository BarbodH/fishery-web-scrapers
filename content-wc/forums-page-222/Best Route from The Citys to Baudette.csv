4989113,Carnhzkr,2016-07-14 11:36:00,964,"I see what you're saying. That does look like a better route, assuming you can get to CR 32. I appreciate the advice."
4989137,Carnhzkr,2016-07-14 11:40:00,964,"Anyone know how the construction is on 169 between Minneapolis and Mille Lacs? According to the DOT site, it looks like there's construction and the road is down to one lane in two different spots."
4975257,Carnhzkr,2016-07-08 13:57:00,964,"What's the best route to get to Baudette? Will be pulling a boat and driving through Minneapolis on I35 around noon on a Friday. Google Maps says to take I35 north and cut off at Moose Lake, but I think GM is FOS. I know there's hellacious traffic south of Hinkley. What about St Cloud to Bemidji? Or, skirt around Mille Lacs to Grand Rapids?"
4976129,Bill Krejca,2016-07-09 06:04:00,6107,"I don't know if this is the best way, but the route I generally take is I35 to 494 west, 101 to Elk River, 169 to Grand Rapids, 2 to Deer River, 46 to Northome, left on 1, right on 72. Bill"
4976177,pjshorthorn,2016-07-09 06:26:00,5654,"Keith, Breezy is on his way up to LOTW as I type. We took a different route this year to get around some construction from his place in Breezy Point to Baudette. The last part of the route ( Northome on) outlined by Bill is how we went. I'm sure he will jump online at some point while in camp to make me jealous about some big fish he has caught so I'll ask him to chime in on the route we took. BTW, look for a ""fishing porn "" package in the mail. It should arrive Monday-ish. Make sure you get your pick of the litter before handing the rest over to your sons If you get a chance, stop by the entrance to Turtle Lake and check out the sign that we hung in honor of Bill's dad . Have an outstanding trip with your boys !!!! PjShorthorn."
4978937,Carnhzkr,2016-07-10 13:45:00,964,"Thanks, Bill. I should have asked your preferred route when I stopped by a few weeks ago. That route looks like a winner. We'll give it a shot. Pat, I'll be watching for the mailman on Monday. Can't wait to take 'em for a spin."
4979169,The tank,2016-07-10 15:21:00,340,Hey Carnhzkr this is ftfarms I had to change everything to get back on the site. When we came up on Friday there was a sign saying 46 will close on July 11th. Not sure how long but sounded like for a while.
4980825,Carnhzkr,2016-07-11 09:51:00,964,"Thanks for the heads up, ftf... er, Tank. I checked the DOT site and I can see there's a bridge out on 46 and they have a detour in effect. I can also see that 169 is down to one lane in two different places due to construction. Even though that looks like the best way to go, I may just take the westerly route though Bemidji and avoid 169 and 46 altogether."
4980985,BreezyPoint,2016-07-11 11:04:00,1581,One of the roads on the 46 route was closed on July 9 (road that goes through Northome.Frank
4981121,bigwalleye1,2016-07-11 12:09:00,2632,"Another option, maybe longer, though, is 169 to Grand Rapids, west on 2 to Deer River, north on 6 to Big Falls, N on 71 to I falls, then west to Baudette. Just checked the map. It IS longer, but it may be all there is, depending on exactly what is closed and exactly where."
4988193,Wallii1,2016-07-14 07:05:00,37,There is a quicker detour than the one marked on 46. Go north on 46 from Squaw Lake to CR 32 and take a left. Go about 4 miles to CR 131 ( dirt). Brings you back to 46 and your good.
4989105,DeBo,2016-07-14 11:31:00,211,"Just went through the 46 detour yesterday on the way home. It wasn't that bad. I was picking up a friend in Cloquet on the way up so we took that route. My preferred route from the west side of the cities is 94 to clearwater, hop up to 10 west. 10 to motley, 64 to bemidji, then 71/72 to baudette. If the pennington road is open i like to jump over to walker at akely and on up around the east side of cass lake. Not much shorter but more scenic. Not sure the pennington road is finished yet. Baudette is all sorts of torn up. I took a gas station worker detour instead of the sign detour from the cenex station. He told me the official detour takes,you over some gravel on 11 east of the cenex. So plan a route on a map website using the residential roads once you get to 11 in town after the detour in to town."
