4985065,Carnhzkr,2016-07-13 08:40:00,964,"I took my usual route three weeks ago - going north I take 35E and south I take 35W. Either way was no problem. Of course, 35 north of The Cities, for about 15 miles south of Hinkley is a mess. I would look to avoid it if possible, if you'd be hitting that stretch on a Friday afternoon. We drove back home on Friday, July 1 and traffic going north for the holiday weekend looked ridiculous. I could see lots of people trying to be smart and took the old highway from Pine City to Hinkley, but you could see cars backed up for miles on that one too."
4985089,Lovetofish,2016-07-13 08:48:00,458,Thanks. I will hit The Cities about 9AM. Most of the rush traffic should be over.

Actually thought about living around Pine City area and commute to north side of the Cities. We often stay in Virginia (MN) on the way up so the first day isn't so long....just too old and no one else volunteers to drive."
