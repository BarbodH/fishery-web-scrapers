4988929,mms3rd,2016-07-14 10:25:00,148,Canada is a great country but I wouldn't go there if I couldn't catch fish. I stayed at an outpost at the north end of pipestone a couple years ago and loved the area. But slowest fishing of any trip to Canada. I've read all of the posts on the lake and fishing seems really hit and miss. We were there early June and had high temps and lots of sun. My past experience fishing north of the border was that it was more steady regardless of time of day or weather. As many camp websites say. So...any definitive word on north pipestone as a fishery? Maybe being first time on water hurt. Looking for late fall trip this year. Your thoughts? please. Thanks

We caught a couple really nice muskies and the scenery was spectacular.The water is crystal clear and tough to fish. Pipestone does hold some big walleyes but requires different techniques and fishing times than we prefer. I would enjoy the challenge if I had unlimited time and resources but since I don't I probably won't return. There is just too much water that fits my needs and desires better.
