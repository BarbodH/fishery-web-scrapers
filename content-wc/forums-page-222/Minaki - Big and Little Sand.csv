Last year we found average water and a giant year class of walleyes in the 12 to 14 inch size. Also found good numbers of over fish but still were short of eaters in the top end of the slot. Was there significant growth in those small walleyes? Have the fish moved out to the big lake? How is the water level? Any fires up that way? Any Walleye Central folks up that way that week that see me give me a shout, I'll still be the old good lookin' big guy in a red Skeeter tiller. Thanks, Big Iver"

4963249,Guest,2016-07-02 14:28:00,0,I have a buddy heading up for the first time couple of questions have the mayflies hatched yet ? are the walleye's out on big sand yet ? thank you
4963361,downrigger222,2016-07-02 15:48:00,15,"Mayflies hatched about a week ago. As far as big Sand and walleyes go all I can attest to is yesterday we fished a hump just north of Wiskey Island, on the very south end of Big Sand. Caught one walleye of 22 inch, in 34 ft of water, and a few shorts. Did see a number of boats headed into Big Sand. Wind finally blew us off lake. Looks like it will be Tuesday before we get back on the water. Rain and wind"

Quite a bit of boat traffic upstream of the Dalles when I was up there. The fish are ""getting"" to there summer spots. Big Sand produced some nice eyes in the 25"" range, lots of small fish just under the slot. No master for me this weekend, came close with one just a hair under 27"". Like mentioned before, the mayfly hatch is finishing up. The current is up in the river due to the recent rain, but water levels remain close to normal. By the time you arrive, Big Sand should produce some nice ones for ya. I will be on holidays for 2 weeks that same time. I will keep an eye out for ya. If you see a tall guy running a black pro guide with 200 vrod, stop by."
4976009,Bigiver,2016-07-09 03:39:00,94,Thank every one for the replies. The official countdown has started and is under a week. We will be there eating fresh walleye a week from today. It sounds like this may be the third year in a row that the majority of the fish will be just under the slot. I will look for your boats and give you a shout out if I see I you.

Eaters where hard to find, but did get enough for dinner when we wanted. Just had to work for them real hard. Most of the big fish where up in Big Sand."
