As expected, cloudy, windy, rainy days produced the greatest numbers, with a MUCH slower catch rate on sunny blue-bird days. Largest 2 eyes were 24.5"", and the largest pike coming in at 28"". We only focused on pike for a hew hours the entire trip. 3 of our guys were novice fisherman and were amazed at the fish we caught. Bugs (skeeters) were bad, so much so a few folks even slept in head nets. Thanks to all for the information you provided to make this trip successful."
