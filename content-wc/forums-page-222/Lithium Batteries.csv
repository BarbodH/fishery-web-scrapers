I paid $125, which is considerably more than the $19.99 I paid when I bought the unit. I bought a 10mah capacity and didn't charge it for 5 1/2 days. it lasted the entire trip. I ran it from 7am-9pm. Turning if off for shore lunch and dinner only. We saved on fly in weight and extra batteries that need to be charged during the day. The battery is very light. About half the weight of regular batteries. (We have electricity from 6am to 10 pm only) The battery was an ice force from Rapala. Just thought this might help."
