4984769,onetimedave,2016-07-13 06:13:00,502,AWO says with the recent rains the water levels have risen a small amount. Late May the level was down a small amount.
4984841,Travis Schallock,2016-07-13 06:55:00,37,"We got quite a bit of rain in the last week, it has brought the levels up some. I was on a couple lakes up river of Melchett and I would say the water is still lower than normal, nothing serious, but lower. There are rocks that you usually don't have to worry about until August that are showing."
4986569,flipdip,2016-07-13 15:11:00,27,"hey halfmoon, we are heading up to Melchett in mid-August would love a report on how things go. Good luck!"
4987441,halfmoon007,2016-07-13 20:08:00,121,We (party of 6 ) will be going in 7/21 will hopefully as usual post a fantastic report. Was hoping AC plumber would throw us a report he was in their 2 weeks ago.
4990137,acplumber,2016-07-14 19:16:00,80,"This was our first time at melchett so I'm not sure what normal levels are but if this is any indication, the submerged island on the way to where u dump the fish guts was under by about 2-3 inches And man o man did we lambaste it We soon found where to go and not to go"
4991233,oleJoe,2016-07-15 07:50:00,114,That's not an island...lol...just a BIG rock. It was out the last week in May but we had rain all week and the water rose enough to cover it by weeks end. Its usually just under water.
4992985,halfmoon007,2016-07-15 20:21:00,121,"Here is my Question? were or if all those cases of beer fall into the fish gut dumping incident?. that's it! we here at the walleye central are going to put YOU on double secret probation! LOL OK so now you know mellchet is a pretty awesome fishery.Here is the thing my brothers have taught me, Mr big walleye wont be in the river mouth. He is out on a 25 to 32 foot rock hump all by his lonesome, and during the week you have to push yourself to go out and find him. that's what I LOVE about walleye fishing!!!! then with no fish on the stringer at 3pm and the fish fry is at 3;15pm we just swing by the river mouth and grab 3 16 inchers to fry up. Man this whole Canadian walleye fishing thing is something the wives cant understand but know its a big deal for us Guys.Ok that said! i am leaving for mellchet in 5 days and a wake up, then 12 days later driving another 16 hrs. back to nakina to give Percy lake ( Thanks AC for the info)a try with little brother. Man I m looking at retirement in 2 years and hoping to work in more trips per year. And at this point in the post I want to tell the MNR I (WE ) follow all your Rules and Great job, **** throw a slot on no fish kept over 16 or 17 inches. Hey thanks For listening to me Babble but I'm pumped and ready and everybody needs to know it. my Boss and CEO of the company sure do. Thanks The PUMPED up camp cook ..Halfmoon"
