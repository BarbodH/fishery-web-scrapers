Even admitting that; if the hatch is really heavy the water will be full, like rising nymphs every few cubic inches and concentrated in the top few feet of the water column while they start to split their shucks, the pickings are just too easy for the 'eyes to bother with anything not right in front of them. This generally happens a few days into the hatch when the bugs are peaking. When it starts it takes a couple nights for the fish to key in, then you get huge numbers of bugs if the nights are warm enough and then it starts to taper and sputter but the fish are still keyed in and looking for them. That's the way it works in the trout world anyway."
4979721,yoopertrout,2016-07-10 19:48:00,1172,"Getting a close match might not matter. It's key with trout, but with other fish, like bluegills for example, it doesn't matter much. I've never dealt with walleyes and mayflies, so I don't know."
4979857,bernmaster44,2016-07-10 21:06:00,256,"I was on Leech Lake for 4 days about 2 weeks ago. The mayfly hatch was at it's peak. I was graphing nothing but mayflies and my boat was covered in m mayflies. I tried many traditional good areas...I pulled lindy's, spinners, lures. I caught 2 walleyes and a bunch of tiny perch. I spoke with 3 local guides who were doing about the same. I was super excited until the last day when it finally dawned on me that I'm skunked. It was a beautiful trip and these things happen but, it amazes me when I hear that ppl catch fish with these pests."
4963409,123chadder,2016-07-02 16:35:00,429,"im planning an early season walleye/pike trip for next year,ive heard that walleye will gorge on myflies and shutoff to different presentations,is this true?if so,how long on average after ice out does this happen? when is a good date to choose?"
4963569,BreezyPoint,2016-07-02 18:49:00,1581,"This is complete hogwash. I've been reading walleye anglers complaining about mayflies for years, but the truth couldn't be further away. I just got back from Lake of the Woods and one bay was covered in mayflies. We caught great walleyes there, some big northerns and a bonus Muskie. Walleyes have the feedbag on when there are mayflies. For years I have caught them and even targeted them in shallow bays during the mayfly hatch and I've never been disappointed. Try a presentation that is off the bottom like crankbaits or floating jig heads and you will do well. That being said I've seen mayfly hatches early on and well into July where I go fishing on Lake of the Woods. Plan your trip for your convenience and adjust your presentation for the mayflies. If you are on a good lake, you won't be disappointed.I've caught many walleyes on the hatch on Lake of the Woods, Lac Seul, the English River, and Sassaginnigak Lake in Manitoba, to name a few places. Most times I am trolling crankbaits.Frank"
4963625,clawman,2016-07-02 19:17:00,2078,"My expereince on Winnebago May 20-27 was the opposite of that. Every fish we caught was pooping out a dark green stream. Yes the bite was tough until we went to the surface. That is how the NWT tournament was won. Worm burner or gold blade harness w/ chartreuse back, 1/2 oz weight 5' off the planer board. Yes 5'. My advice would be to start at the surface with your baits and work your way down as the sun higher."
4974633,phishfearme,2016-07-08 09:17:00,1242,"last week on Wettlaufer Lake we were right in the middle of mayfly season. every calm morning the lake was covered with carcasses of the emerging nymphs. more importantly the walleye we did catch were bloated with nymphs - and the ones that regurgitated at the surface, threw up a wad of partially digested nymphs - very few with minnows. we've fished in mayfly season numerous times and this was the first time to see so many fish throw up wads of nymphs. we all thought that fishing was WAY OFF what would normally be expected for this lake - could be the mayfly effect or something else - how would you know? fish do tend to focus on what is available - it's called ""match the hatch"" in trout fishing circles - and walleye are no doubt the same. we had nothing that resembled the emerging nymphs so maybe they ignored our twister jigs which mimic minnows. phish"
4974697,tv4fish,2016-07-08 09:53:00,2694,"All I can do is relate our experience through the years on Lac Seul. We have found that if the hatch has just started - the walleyes are on a feeding binge and will take our crawlers/leeches - no problem. IF the hatch has been going on for 2-3 days, the bite slows significantly."
4975097,phishfearme,2016-07-08 12:12:00,1242,my experience would agree with this. the duration and start of the hatch though varies widely from lake to lake and year to year - so it's tough to know in advance when the bite will be impacted by the nymph hatch. just go fishing. phish
4975201,123chadder,2016-07-08 13:09:00,429,"so the hatch does affect fishing,but not right away...ok sounds good i will keep that in mind"
4975433,Bakefish,2016-07-08 15:44:00,1077,"Switch to pike. Pike don't key on mayflies, they key on walleye that eat mayflies."
4975569,yoopertrout,2016-07-08 16:54:00,1172,"My two cents, from the perspective of a trout fisherman. I've never dealt with mayflies and walleyes. The hatch that is referred to is known as the Hex among trout fishermen (called wigglers by ice fisherman.) It is a burrowing type mayfly that lives in sand and muck and hatches in early summer, almost always after dark. On trout streams it brings up the biggest fish, but it's unpredictable. One night you get a light hatch and no risers. The next night you get a perfect hatch and catch lots of trout. The third night the hatch is so heavy on the surface that the chance of a trout taking the fisherman's fly is nil. During the days when the hatch is going on, getting trout during the day when the hatch isn't happening is tough, because the trout get full at night. What this might mean for walleye fishing: 1. If you can find an area that is all rock, there should be fewer mayflies, and the fishing shouldn't be so affected. This works on trout streams. Not sure if finding a place with no muck is possible on many lakes. 2. Fish don't bite just out of hunger, but also out of territoriality and annoyance, so it makes sense that a vibrating crank bait might cause bites. 3. If the hatch isn't too heavy, a nymph fly might work. 4. I've heard tales of people getting walleyes on dry flies during the hatch, but I've never seen it. 5. Maybe late afternoon or evening, when the fish are getting hungry again, but before the nymphs have begun to swim up and molt would be a good time. Good luck."
4975673,zman8701,2016-07-08 18:35:00,100,"If the idea is to match the hatch, your basically saying minnows, crawlers and leeches are useless? I'm not so sure I'm buying in on that theory, personally I find moving water to fish and those walleyes will have their guts full of mayflies and I fish them with jig and half crawler."
