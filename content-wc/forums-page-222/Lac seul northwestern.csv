Don't know how much room for expansion there is though. How far south of Ear Falls? Having good bait and boat gas available may help with bookings if a few kilos away from town."

We go in July, I'm sure it's better in June, but that's the best it gets. So if u can turn a dime from about 6 weeks full occupancy, have at it"
