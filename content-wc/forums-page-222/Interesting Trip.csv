4978625,Pooch,2016-07-10 11:30:00,4619,"Good genetics Bill! Good genetics.Long time ago we were fishing Birch Lake north of Red Lake, ON. There were a group of ""older"" guys in camp. One was obviously older than the rest. His ""tackle box"" was an empty plastic with handle Atrazine bag! Not my first choice of TB, but the price was right. Anyway, his method of getting from the dock to the boat was to get down on his knees on the dock, set down, swing his legs into the boat then slide down onto the seat. Didn't want any help, by God he was doing it himself. Very self sufficient guy no doubt all his life. I'll always remember that and use it for inspiration when the time comes. In the mean time I'll keep going as fast as I can for as long as I can. Imagine you'll do the same along with that crazy guy from Tennessee that goes by GE.Pooch"

4980873,Carnhzkr,2016-07-11 10:04:00,964,"I'd lay big odds you'll make many more trips north before you retire your spinning rod. My dad will be 87 this fall. He has a leaky mitral valve, high cholesterol, can barely hear, can barely walk on two bad knees, dandruff, halitosis, athlete's foot, and irritable bowel syndrome (well, he's irritable anyway), and he hasn't let that stop him yet. He'll likely cross into Canada three times this year. He's flying into North Carribou Lodge with one of his grandson's in a few weeks (a trip that's high on my wish list and a trip not for the faint of heart). If I had a dollar for every time he turned to look out over the English River on the last day of one of his trips to his favorite spot and said, ""Goodbye Caribou Falls. I'll never see you again."" I'd be able to retire today."

4986529,joeflip,2016-07-13 14:55:00,75,Small world. .my 73 year old father says the same thing every time we make the boat ride back to camp from Routine falls..My dads been making the cariboufalls trip every year since 1979..I was fortunate enough to continue the dream..
4987249,WallyWarrior,2016-07-13 18:51:00,2488,Just a funny thing I saw on oahe a few yrs back- An older gentleman had rigged two lazy boys facing backward in his old Lund. He was headed out after dark to do some trolling and get some sleep. It actually looked like a great idea. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
4987305,Guest,2016-07-13 19:12:00,0,"Bill - I read your book and gave it to my fishing partner to read. We explored the same area your dad did when we were 18(that was one 27 yrs ago). After reading it, my partner commented that the boats those fellas used must have sat very low in the water when they travelled due to the huge brass balls the guys must have had....lol. It was a great read about the early days of an area I love so much. The memorial that pjshorthorn put up for him is pretty cool...... Kind regards - Tim"
4958833,55walleyes,2016-06-30 11:28:00,131,"We leave tomorrow morning for Sioux Lookout. We are flying into Hooker Lake via Slate Falls Outposts. My 78-year-old father will be going and pretty sure it will be his last trip and my 24-year-old daughter will be making her first trip. She really enjoys fishing but 5 1/2 days of no Internet no cell phone will test her out. My father-in-law is also going, a longtime family friend is going both of those guys have made several trips and we also have two rookies making their first trip. Will give a trip report when we return next week."
4958857,Fishoil,2016-06-30 11:37:00,1277,Have a great trip! Cherish the time with your father and daughter. My dad is still around but probably took his last trip with us 2 years ago and I miss his company. Fortunately my 2 daughters still get to go and I welcome them on every trip.
4958953,johnboat,2016-06-30 12:32:00,2014,Hope all goes perfect for you! Sounds like you'll have your hands full.
4959105,narly12,2016-06-30 13:45:00,13,9 of us heading up to Lost Island Lodge near you on the 15th of July. Would appreciate a full report when you return. Have a safe and terrific time. Narly12
4959121,Bstar,2016-06-30 13:55:00,564,"One of my fondest memories of my Dad is our first trip to Lac Seul in the late 80's. Enjoy your trip with your family especially your Dad. Looking forward to your report. Our group is going to Slate Falls' Miniss Lake East outpost in Aug. 2017, only 407 days to go!"
4959505,Daveygravy,2016-06-30 17:53:00,88,"Have a great trip! Try to make it into Minko lake , it's one of the prettiest lakes I've been to. There are some nice fish in it as well."
4977281,55walleyes,2016-07-09 18:49:00,131,Had a great trip. Fishing was outstanding and all went well.
4977553,Bill Krejca,2016-07-09 21:05:00,6107,"I'll be 78 in August. Heading up soon, man, I hope this isn't my last trip! Bill"
4977921,Golden Eagle,2016-07-10 06:58:00,2642,"Bill, this won't be your last trip. Don't give it a thought. Taking a floatplane to camp early next Saturday with wife, son and 7 year old grandson. Turning 82 on July 23, the day we leave camp. Already have fished 2 weeks in May this year and am strongly looking at an early October trip. May 2017 trip is already booked. Will be 33rd consecutive walleye opener in NW Ontario. Would be a shame to break the streak. repeat: this will not be your last trip. Geezers don't know how to quit. I might add that I received a pop in each hip Friday morning and I'm still juiced. Otherwise I might be shopping for a huge, soft recliner to place in front of my TV."
4978401,Bill Krejca,2016-07-10 09:44:00,6107,"Thanks for the encouragement, G E, I have a ways to go to beat Dad's last trip at age 92. Camping, no less. Bill"
