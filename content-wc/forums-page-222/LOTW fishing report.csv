4982401,Thompmd,2016-07-12 02:53:00,320,"Just got home yesterday from our 1000mile trip. To preface I haven't been to LOTW in 4/5yrs and this was our first trip to the Kenora area, the previous trips were in the Nestor falls area. This year was the latest we have ever been(July 3-10) for 2 reasons, I took my wife on her first trip so I wanted more stable weather and the other was the passing of my father in March and all the things that went along with that. One of the reasons we went was the previous trips with my father/I. We talked about that a lot during the trip and there is no one happier that we went than him. We are best friends and fished together my entire life. I would also like to mention that I sent out several PM's to guys here on WC and everyone was great in their own way, thank you all! Here goes, one of the things about our annual trips to Canada that made them special was things you see along the way that bring back wonderful memories. Just a few of those for me were ""glimpses"" of lakes along the way excited me as a child and still do. You just know those lakes were full of big fish and how you just knew you could catch them if you stopped. Another is some of the small towns along the way or favorite restaurants like the chocolate moose for breakfast at I-falls . Man we have caught some nice fish over breakfast there!! Anyway, we stayed at one of Crow Rock Lodges private cabins. We stayed on a housekeeping plan and took our own boat. We planned to eat a few meals at the lodge with their American plan guests as we had heard wonderful things about their meals but it just never happened , another reason to return. The lodge/cabin is a boat-in lodge located about 17miles from Kenora. After a couple quick stops in Kenora for groceries we were met at the dock and were on our way. I don't remember much about the trip out as I left my sunglasses in my wife's purse(she rode in the covered boat, clearly smarter than I) and it rained on the way out. I'm sure you all know the feeling of feeling like you were pelted w/rocks along the way but no worse for the wear. They help us load our stuff in the cabin then we follow them over to the main lodge so we know where it is and we got to meet Kurt Dafcik one of the owners. We talked quickly about things and we were back at the cabin shortly to unpack, get rods ready etc. Here are the highlights from the fishing you want to know. Water temps throughout the week were 68-71. It rained some several of the days but only once w lightening that forced me off the water. Now, I am basically a bass fisherman who catches his walleyed to eat and that's it. We never bought any live bait or fished specifically for them. Our biggest walleyes were 29,28 & 27"". The largest 2 were caught on rattle trap type baits and the other was caught on a 5/16 white spinnerbaits. I actually had 1 more follow I saw that was similar size on the rattle bait. 3 of the 4 were caught on the same small mainlake reef I saw on the way back to camp and decided to try. It was surrounded by 40+' of water and was only the size of 2-3 boats. There was broken rock that extended off one end where both of the larger fish and the follow came from. We fished this 5-6x and only had 2other bites the entire time, 1 30"" northern and another fish I stuck for a few seconds? The wind had to be blowing in on this point and it quickly fell into deep water. We caught quite a few eater size fish in a couple other areas that we used for dinners. The bass were up to 18""-ish. We caught lots of smallmouth throughout the week. Nothing new here but the fish were on broken rock shorelines or islands/humps w broken rocks. These were always better w/wind and the best ones were tapered keeping the boat in 10' of water. The evening bite was generally best. This isn't being evasive but we caught them on a lot of baits and had to switch to baits for the conditions but we caught them on rattle trap type baits in 1/4 & 1/2oz and used several different colors but if you don't know LOTW is loaded w crawdads and they spit them up or had them in their mouths constantly. We also caught them on senko type baits, jerk baits like the pointer 100/110 in chartreuse shad, top waters from pop-r, buzz baits , torpedos and walking type baits,crank baits , spinnerbaits, swimming grubs, etc only used soft plastics briefly as we couldn't keep them out of the rocks. Northerns up to 35"" on spinnerbaits, rattle trap type baits and they too came off rocks. Caught quite a few just bass fishing. Muskies up to 40"" also on spinnerbaits and rattle trap type baits. Only had 1 other large follow, was disappointed in the muskies, the fishing seemed better for them in sabaskong but admittingly we aren't Muskie guy/gal. I was really surprised we didn't catch many fish at all around weed beds. I mentioned this to Kurt mid week when I got gas and he didn't seem surprised so he knows far better than I . This was my wife's first fishing trip and she was amazing. She doesn't have the casting abilities but had patience I wish I had and tried very hard and I couldn't be prouder. We actually took our little dog too and wish he had a little more patience lol. Spent no more than a couple minutes at the border and they were fine and never asked for papers for the dog, only the date he was vaccinated. They also nicely mentioned my wife might want to sign her passport for future travels. We also purchased licenses/cards online and that too was very easy. All in all a wonderful trip and are already talking about 2017. If you have questions ask away or PM if you prefer, I'm sure I forgot a few things Oops: weather was from high 50's at night to mid 70's during the day, very pleasant."
4982409,pjshorthorn,2016-07-12 03:58:00,5654,Thanks for sharing such a nice report. I smiled when you mentioned the drive up and seeing all the lakes. That is one of my favorite parts as well. We are actually talking about taking a stroll down memory lane on our upcoming trip by coming home using Rt. 502 since we enjoy the scenery on that stretch of road. It has been awhile since we have taken it. PjShorthorn.
4982625,deadhead1,2016-07-12 07:23:00,193,"Glad you had a good trip. I was thinking about you when the weather was bad but turned nice for a day or two. We where down in your area on Saturday and did good on walleye, jigging with leeches. Sorry I couldn't help you much with pointing you to bass but I knew you would find them if you spend the time."
4982697,lawson2343,2016-07-12 08:05:00,459,"Congratulations on taking your wife! I like to hear that! I too began taking my wife on a Canadian trip beginning in 2010. My wife had never fished, but she was a great sport about it. My cousin and I've fished together up there for twenty years. We decided to take our wives on a separate trip! Pretty smart huh? I now get two trips a year! Our group has grown from two couples to four couples. The wives LOVE it. They talk about it all year. They were the ones that had us extend our trip from 3 days of fishing to 4 1/2! My wife and I have shared a lot of wonderful memories in the boat. Last year she caught a 42 inch muskie on a walleye rod and did a marvelous job! Enjoy those times with your wife!"

As with PJ, I too just love to see the lakes off the road and day dream about taking a month off to explore each one. My wife started coming up w me two years ago, our third trip is mid August at Witch Bay. She caught a Musky last year on a Rattle Trap, making her the only accomplished Musky fisher person in the boat."
