4980049,Bstar,2016-07-11 05:16:00,564,x2 on the Hilltop Motel in IFalls. Nice clean retro motel reasonably priced. I would also recommend La Place Rendevous in Fort Frances. We stayed there last year for about $100 US per room. Good thing about staying there is that you cross the border in the afternoon when there are no lines. The rooms were clean although a little dated. The best thing is they have a bar and a restaurant so you don't have to leave once your there. The food is decent especially the blueberry pancakes. It's right on Rainy Lake and not too far from Rainy Lake Sports if you need to pick up some bait.

The Rainbow motel is on the west side of town, check with Gord about the remodeled room, pretty nice about $60 US. There is anothrr motel in downtown FF, cant remember the name, had a diner for breakfast. First trip this year we will be staying at Copper River Inn, bar and restaurant, plenty of boat parking space."
4981785,eyemike,2016-07-11 16:42:00,233,We have used Super 8 in Fort Francis. Americana Inn at International Falls. I preferred the Super 8 in Fort Francis. We have stayed at the Super 8 in Red Lake and at the Balmer Inn. No complaints on either. I would pick Super 8 in Red Lake also. The Balmer Inn has a pretty good restaurant. There is also a good little Italian restaurant downtown Red Lake. I can't remember the name of it though.
4982041,hoppy63,2016-07-11 19:44:00,367,"Thanks to all replies. Two places booked for the sake of having them, but still checking around."
4982873,Fishin Fun,2016-07-12 09:37:00,218,"We stay at the Falls Motel in I-Falls. Pretty basic, but clean and beds seem good. Plus plenty of parking for your boat and truck. I believe we get a room with 3 beds for about $100/night."
4984169,joeflip,2016-07-12 19:38:00,75,"Like walleye dave said, you can't beat the price of the Rainbow in FF and to top it off you have Canadian tire across the street for last minute lures..p.s just don't try more than 3 in a room the roll away bed at the Rainbow is not for the average guy.. Joe.."
