4975737,Guest,2016-07-08 19:49:00,0,"Interested in this area for Pike, Muskie, Walleye. Trip will be mid to late Sept. this year if they have room. Can anybody give pro or con info on the camp? Any general info on the fishing? Are the hazards well marked?"
4979473,That Minnesota guy,2016-07-10 17:38:00,8293,"140+ views and no replies. I can only assume.................... It's a brand new camp. Nobody goes to Canada anymore. Fishing is so good, mum is the word."
4979881,Slim03,2016-07-10 21:26:00,159,Never been to the camp before but have fished out of White Birch out of Sioux Narrows a few times. We used to go at the end of August and they always used to talk about the big eyes moving into whitefish bay for the fall which was closer to the camps. Plenty of good fishing around that area and big hazards were decently marked. Also a guide I know that does a really good job Heinrich Bier used to live at the camp and I believe does some guiding from time to time.
4979897,Monks75,2016-07-10 21:27:00,11,I've stayed here lots. Fishing is fabulous when your planning on going. Everything well marked on lake. Camp is in great location. Some cabins have been recently updated. Your basic housekeeping cabins. Matt the owner is great and will help put you on fish. Buy the lake master chip. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
4979953,Lake Of The Woods,2016-07-11 00:52:00,124,"I lived in the Kenora area for many years and know the Sioux Narrows area as well.Crawford's Camp has been around for about 60 years and the cabins are a mixture of newer and older.Access is easy as it just off Hwy.71.I have never stayed there but it has a reputation of being well kept and maintained.You can catch walleye,smallmouth bass,muskie,pike.Lake trout can also be fished for in certain parts of the waters as well.Fishing can be tough at times as the waters are heavily fished due to the many camps in the area.However,if you venture off and get away from the crowds some bountiful fishing can be experienced.Yes,there are many hazards in this waterway and I STRONGLY suggest anyone navigating them be VERY familiar with the Bouy system and know what side of the red and green bouys to be on at ALL times.There is NO room for error here as the waters are littered with shallow rocky reefs and rock piles which obviously are great for holding fish but can wreck the boat,motor and or passengers.Seen it happen almost every year during the summer while living there.Some people went home in body bags due to not realizing the hazards and being ill prepared to navigate the waters.I suggest getting the Nautical/Hydrographic Charts and studying them in advance of your trip.Walleye can be caught on the shallow shoals and reefs during the morning and evening when they come shallow to feed but during the afternoon they will retreat to the depths and areas with heavy aquatic vegetation to escape the hot sun.Jigging with minnows,leeches or Gulp minnows are good techniques as well as casting or trolling crank baits.Smallmouth bass are abundant around the many rocky areas with drop offs and pike,...well,pike are just about everywhere and can become a bloody nuisance when trying to fish for walleye,bass or muskie.Muskie are present although not as much as other parts of Lake of the Woods.Any isolated island with rocky points,humps and vegetation is always a classic spot to cast 8"" to 12"" crank baits such as buck-tails,shallow raiders,top water baits,suicks.Trolling is always effective in the fall as the big females will be feeding voraciously in preparation for the coming winter,...trophy time without a doubt.I have attached some hydrographic charts of the area and also some links to where you can purchase others if need be.If you decide not to go to this particular area I have a friend who owns a camp on the west end of Lake of the Woods on an island which is located south of Clearwater Bay.You will also have access to fish Shoal Lake.The camp is actually located in an area called Labyrinth Bay and I can tell you from experience that the fishing is excellent for all species of fish.My son caught a 14lb walleye just a few minutes from the camp while we were muskie fishing and his first muskie right off the dock at the camp.If you are focusing on muskie then this is the spot to go as there are many in the waters there and they can get VERY large indeed in the 50"" plus range.The owner Don Sauve has owned this camp for well over 30 years and is one of the best fishing and hunting guides in the area.If interested click on this link:http://www.ontariohuntingfishing.com Tell Don that Greg S. sent you his way if considering staying at Northwest Outfitters Camp.

4980217,That Minnesota guy,2016-07-11 06:49:00,8293,"Thanks for the info guys, thats just what I was looking for! Our group will be mixed with 2 guys wanting Pike and 2 others primarily Walleye guys. Reason I'm leaning towards that area is I want someplace easy to get to that we don't have to tow the boats down 30 miles of gravel. 2 hours from the border at I-Falls and large Pike are the main considerations on paved roads."
4980785,srj,2016-07-11 09:40:00,971,"I had an island cabin for many years in the area. Fall is gorgeous and there are few people on the lake compared to summer. Be prepared for big swings in the weather....might snow, might be hot. One thing for sure, the fish will have the feed bag on. LOTW gave some great advice. I would strongly recommend having the official hydro paper maps for the areas you plan on travelling as well as an echip. The paper maps are remarkably well done with few spots missed. Note the word few. The major travel routes are marked on the maps and a buoy system is used. Many years ago a local native guide/carpenter gave me some sage advise: beware the yellow water! With the clear water in Whitefish, the shallows show up well. The yellow water advice served me well as I was fishing there before the maps included depths. The contour maps changed things greatly. Hope you have great weather and great fishing."
