Our best day was day 2 when josh caught 75 and I caught 81 where the Kap river enters melchett, this took all of 5 hrs and mostly on a slip bobber and a 1.5"" piece of worm. We caught fish where ever we went, in the bay by the cabin, all along the shore, rapids, the flats, and tester lake. 5 of diamonds and red dare devil were a big hit, also fire tiger thunderstick, and x-raps where great. On our last day 2 of the boats went to tester again and we went just past there and trolled the same 1/4 kilometre stretch for most of the day and just hammered them!! It was the easiest fishing ever! All I did was troll a yellow twister tail and 1/4 ounce jig head. The camp was in decent shape. boats and motors worked flawlessly, was definitely a lake that I would like to come back to. Nothing huge for the week, 24 was the biggest eye and 34 was the biggest pike, caught some huge perch tree also, had a monster pike beat and then he got tangled in the stringer."

LOL OK so now you know mellchet is a pretty awesome fishery.Here is the thing my brothers have taught me, Mr big walleye wont be in the river mouth. He is out on a 25 to 32 foot rock hump all by his lonesome, and during the week you have to push yourself to go out and find him. that's what I LOVE about walleye fishing!!!! then with no fish on the stringer at 3pm and the fish fry is at 3;15pm we just swing by the river mouth and grab 3 16 inchers to fry up. Man this whole Canadian walleye fishing thing is something the wives cant understand but know its a big deal for us Guys.Ok that said! i am leaving for mellchet in 5 days and a wake up, then 12 days later driving another 16 hrs. back to nakina to give Percy lake ( Thanks AC for the info)a try with little brother. Man I m looking at retirement in 2 years and hoping to work in more trips per year. And at this point in the post I want to tell the MNR I (WE ) follow all your Rules and Great job, **** throw a slot on no fish kept over 16 or 17 inches. Hey thanks For listening to me Babble but I'm pumped and ready and everybody needs to know it. my Boss and CEO of the company sure do. Thanks The PUMPED up camp cook ..Halfmoon"
