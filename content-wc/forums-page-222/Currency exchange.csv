4952881,LOW1,2016-06-27 14:17:00,2828,Good advice to use a credit card. If you want a little $Cdn cash pocket money you can usually buy it at the convenience store near the Chocolate Moose on the east side of Highway 53 on the far south side of Ifalls. Called something like Fisherman's Haven? Its also a good idea to stop there for a restroom break before you get in the border crossing waiting line.
4953025,pike50plus,2016-06-27 15:15:00,584,Since I do all my accounts at one major bank they always give my a current exchange rate before I go and when i get back.
4968601,SterlingArcher,2016-07-05 14:44:00,92,Pro tip: never exchange any leftover Canadian currency back into US dollars - just save it to add to the kitty for next trip
4968849,BreezyPoint,2016-07-05 16:09:00,1581,"If you use a credit card, keep in mind that most companies ding you around 4% for an international transaction fee. I purposely got a card that does not asses that fee. Also, on that card, they apply EXACTLY the current rate on the day the transaction posted. This is a good, fair deal. One thing I never do is use the card to pay my outfitter. They run tight margins and I do not see the need to have them them dinged 2-4% in transactions fees. It may be convenient for you to use the card, but it just increases the outfitter's costs.Frank"
4976001,Bigiver,2016-07-09 03:05:00,94,Was just watching a travel show the other night and the expert guest suggested that you have a credit card that does not charge a fee for international transactions. He then said the best way to secure funds is to use an ATM. You will get the current rate without exchange fees. I checked with my bank and they will also cover any ATM fees I might incur.
4976273,BreezyPoint,2016-07-09 07:23:00,1581,The only problem with this is that most credit cards charge a stiff fee for cash withdrawn from ATMs.Frank
4976409,3M TA3,2016-07-09 08:57:00,2846,Do people really use a credit card to withdraw funds from an ATM. That's just plain stupid. Any cash withdrawal from a credit card is expensive. Better to use your regular ATM card. My bank charges nothing to do so and the exchange rate is whatever the official rate was the day the transaction was made. ATM cards are definitely the way to go for cash.
4976585,Bstar,2016-07-09 10:48:00,564,"With all due respect Breezy, if an outfitter offers to take payment with a credit card then he should be incorporating the associated fees into the rates he charges.. There's no reason why he should have to take a 2-4% hit to offer the convenience to his customers. He could offer that 2-4% off to his cash paying customers or stipulate in his rates that there will be a service charge added for those paying by credit card. I personally prefer to pay with a credit card. I don't have to carry a wad of cash plus I can get some rewards $ on my Cabela's card."
4976625,Obabikon,2016-07-09 11:12:00,2370,Many resorts charge a 5% fee to anyone using cc's. I don't take them... but all our guests know that in advance and simply bring a personal check.
4979929,BreezyPoint,2016-07-11 00:05:00,1581,"You know, part of what you say is correct, but I like to treat my suppliers as best I can, and after 52 years going to Canada I have come to realize the better I treat them, the better they treat me. I really want my money to go to them, not a credit card company. It's a win-win and doesn't really cost me anything except a 1% reward which is really dwarfed by the good will. The places I stay treat me like royalty and I would like to treat them the same.Frank"
4951673,kevinvjacobs,2016-06-27 05:04:00,48,"Good morning! My group will be staying in International Falls Friday July 1 and crossing into Canada early Saturday morning, heading to Sioux Lookout. We are wanting to exchange some US $ for Canadian. Is there someplace in International Falls? Or should we wait and do it somewhere in Canada? I think I saw somewhere that Canadian banks are closed on Saturday? Thanks for any suggestions, Jake"
4951689,pjshorthorn,2016-06-27 05:12:00,5654,Border Bob's used to exchange funds and the rate they offered was always pretty fair compared to the current exchange rate. You can also exchange Loonies for US dollars there on your way home. I would check their website to make sure they still offer this service. A quick call to the store will give you an idea of the current exchange rate if it isn't published on the website. Have a great trip. I miss my trips to Lac Seul. One day I'll get back there !!!!

4951705,Pooch,2016-06-27 05:19:00,4619,"I always carry Canadian currency with me, but have found that using a charge card to be the most consistent fair exchange rates. I tip in U.S. currency as the staff then benefits from the current exchange rate also.For example, bought leeches in Fort Francis at $50 an pound Canadian and on my MC it was $38 in U.S. currency. Same with the one night at the Super 8 in FF.Pooch"
4951905,bigwalleye1,2016-06-27 06:57:00,2632,"Banks in Canada no longer exchange for non-customers. Border Bob's on short notice is about the only alternative. If you work on it ahead of time, your own bank in the US, or a branch of it in the Falls, will also do it. Wells Fargo usually has CDN currency on hand."
4952065,mwh624,2016-06-27 07:44:00,183,Have you checked with your personal bank? I've found that to be the best option
4952313,BornToFish,2016-06-27 09:16:00,1224,"Greetings, There is some great advice in the comments above. I have found over the years that there is relatively little that I need to buy once in Canada - fuel, live bait, sometimes groceries and that is about it. I simply use my credit card as it's easiest and gives me a favorable exchange rate. When you convert US currency into Canada currency, you will be nicked on the exchange rate. That is, someone is making money on your transaction. The same thing will happen when you convert your remaining Canada currency into US currency. This is just something you might want to keep in mind. One note of caution on using your credit card in Canada, be sure to advise the issuer of your credit card that you will be traveling in Canada. Otherwise, your credit card company might think that your credit card has been corrupted and decline your transaction. I just advise my Credit Union of the dates that I will be traveling and it works. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4952329,port1042,2016-06-27 09:21:00,509,This spring I used a new system. I stopped at a Canadian bank (happened to be in Thunder Bay) and cashed my HST refund check from last fall. I got 115.00CAD and used that for miscellaneous expense in Canada. My HST refund has been requested for our fall trip. I ended up with Canadian cash (plenty for our use); no service charges; and the exchange rate is about as fair has it can be. The check (cheque) is in Canadian funds and so is the cash! I needed two ID's (passport and driver's license) and there was no hassle at all. Prior to this I didn't to get Canadian dollars. We spend very little cash in Canada preferring to use a credit card. The one time I did get Canadian dollars from my local bank I got hammered on both the exchange rate and service charge. It's not worth it.
4952377,kevinvjacobs,2016-06-27 09:43:00,48,Thanks for all the replies. Going to use credit card for all we can. Jake
4952457,BornToFish,2016-06-27 10:33:00,1224,"Kevin, I've found that nearly everyplace that I go in Canada accepts all major US credit cards. This has never been a problem for us. Do check in advance with your fishing lodge to see what their policy is regarding use of credit cards. Some lodges add a fee to their bill for guests paying with credit cards, to cover their merchant's fee from the credit card company. If your lodge does this, you might want to bring cash, personal or traveler's checks. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4952569,itsme,2016-06-27 11:13:00,31,"Last year stopped in the bank in Red Lake and asked the teller which gave me the best exchange rate; Cash, credit card, debit card or check. She quickly said cash. So cash it was."
