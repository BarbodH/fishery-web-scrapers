4981097,gmattbruin,2016-07-11 12:06:00,174,"To your point Phish....NA I know weighs the group, then the gear. I know those totals are used to determine together what is safe or not. The Beavers+Otters have a limit. If 8 guys show up at 225+ each, there isn't gonna be alot of gear going in. In my dozen trips I have nvr seen NA or my outfitter use the weight thing to make extra $.....tht had to be very frustrating to see on the trips you speak of. Greg who owns NA has got to be one of the most safety conscious guys I've seen. He runs a tight ship on the dock..but I will also say, one of the nicest guys you're gonna meet. IMO, no way is it about making a few extra $."
4981697,eyemike,2016-07-11 16:05:00,233,"Thanks for the input everyone! Adempsey2.0 I am taking a wife that thinks packing light is 260 lbs. for herself.I am pretty confident that we will be close on weight. I have been on a handful of fly-ins and have never had an issue with weight. I am not concerned about paying overages either. the thought of having to leave something behind, that I don't like. If Mr. Borger would quit showing these new gotta have one of these pike lures my tackle box would be a lot lighter!"
4981961,rnnonmt,2016-07-11 18:59:00,992,"Just as a tip- Aircraft have what they call a ""useful load."" It is a fixed number of pounds the aircraft can carry and remain within max takeoff weight limit and CG. (Center of Gravity). So people, baggage, charts/maps, emergency equipment, even fuel in the aircraft fuel tanks consumes some of the useful load. All of this the pilot is directly responsible for calculating to make sure the aircraft is within operating limits prior to departure. Operating aircraft is an expensive undertaking without much $$ return so they typically operate as efficient/lean as possible. For example: They will only put enough fuel to make the mission and have required fuel reserve other wise the fuel is taking away from their $$ margin..... Fuel doesn't pay the owner of the aircraft to get from A to B but customers going on fishing trips do so they don't want to waste useful load with extra gas in the tanks. This might help some of you understand the reasoning behind putting weight limitations on you and your gear. Happy Fishing!"
4982097,That Minnesota guy,2016-07-11 19:58:00,8293,Our fly-in last year gave me a chuckle. I think there was two 100# propane tanks and 5-6 cans of boat gas loaded in with us and our gear.
4982337,rnnonmt,2016-07-11 22:41:00,992,Your party must have been under the useful load so they maximized what they could bring along on your flight to replenish their camp essentials to eliminate a non-revenue flight.
4982417,pjshorthorn,2016-07-12 04:07:00,5654,Used to fly a lot of high purity LPG overseas to Asia on cargo aircraft for the electronics industry. Not a big deal if done properly. One may need to worry a little bit if they ask you to straddle a cylinder to keep it from rolling around PjShorthorn.
4984129,joeflip,2016-07-12 19:24:00,75,"What's funny is how our group does the same trip every year and we have what we bring down to a science, I think. .and yet our gear weight varies every year by 75 to 100 pound's over. On average 4 guys 500 to 600 pound's groceries included. Joe.."
4979825,eyemike,2016-07-10 21:01:00,233,"Going to Brace Lake in August. My question is, If my wife and I are overweight by say 50 lbs. will Nakina Air fly in our overweight items and just charge us for the overweight? I have never had issues with overweight gear on fly-ins, but I have never flown with Nakina Air. If there is a surcharge I would gladly pay. Digging through our gear trying to lighten it up, it is not getting any smaller! I keep finding these small things to add! I am having water, and drinks in ahead of time so that is a bunch of weight! Anyone who has used Nakina Air and been overweight?"
4979905,adempsey2.0,2016-07-10 22:16:00,612,"Just call Kyle and ask him? There's a good chance you won't pay anything if you're not over too much. However, since it's a chartered flight they may charge you. The extra weight will be at charter rates, which isn't too bad usually - looks like it might only be 50 cents per pound with Nakina Air, but up to $1 is common. As long as they can fit the gear onto one of the flights heading into Brace, which I am sure they will, there shouldn't be an issue. Anyway, I wouldn't worry about 50lbs too much. Although, at 260lbs allowance, what the heck are you bringing? lol"
4979961,forgop,2016-07-11 03:00:00,880,"I think it varies by outfitter and the amount of weight they can fly in addition to the passengers. My first trip was in 2013 and for a group of us, we were nearly over by 350# for 4 people. LOL Outfitter had to fly remaining gear on a 2nd trip later that day and we paid overweight charges of something like $70/person. Much like I remember my first flight instructor telling me while I was working on my pilot's license, runway behind you is not good, so by the same token, lures you leave behind can't catch fish. I bring a lot of tackle, but what I bring I have several colors, depths, sizes, etc, so I have several options to get where the fish are that week. This year it's just 2 of us and unless we really get crazy, have nothing to worry about. This year I'm bringing in a really nice boat seat in addition to my huge amount of gear for 2 people"
4979985,octanehi5,2016-07-11 03:56:00,1104,"We never make weight, the weight is set by how much the type of plane can carry safely, We pay .75 to 1.00 per lb. in overages to have it flown in. Avation fuel is very expensive in Canada We always plan on being ready for the overages"
4980009,wallags,2016-07-11 04:17:00,10,"With Air Ivanhoe we pay 0.75 per pound over. With gear, clothes, dry goods we are always underweight. What kills us is the 2-3 cases of beer we take."
4980041,forgop,2016-07-11 05:01:00,880,"Yep. George had to make a separate trip for the nearly 400# we were over. Fortunately for my boat partner and I, our fishing gear flew with us and the other boot was on the 2nd flight. LOL Sent from my SM-G935V using Tapatalk"
4980305,onetimedave,2016-07-11 07:28:00,502,Contact Tracy at Nakina Air Service. She will have the answer. Phone is 807-329-5752
4980737,Carnhzkr,2016-07-11 09:35:00,964,"My son and I flew Nakina Air into Onaman Lake a couple of years ago. I was pretty concerned about the weight, after being told by the outfitter to limit weight to 100 lbs per person. Even after trying to reduce as much as I could, we were still at about 250 for the two of us. We were flying in with another group of four to the lodge and they just put all of our gear, along with all of the gear from the other group onto the large scale, then added tons of other supplies that were to be flown in to the camp. They then had all six of us to stand on the scale beside the mountain of gear and supplies and had one mass weigh-in. I assumed they would weigh our gear separately and assess us any necessary over weight charges, but that wasn't the case. The other group of four had tons of gear and I'm sure were well over 100 lbs per person, but it was never an issue. That was my experience, YMMV."
4980961,gmattbruin,2016-07-11 10:43:00,174,"My 2cents. Done abt a dozen or so of these, all with Nakina Air. But always remember, you are paying and flying with an outfitter of your choice and I can assure you, Nakina air is doin the weigh in, then that info is transferred to your outfitter of choice. It's the outfitter that will have to decide in conjunction with Greg of NA whether the overweight will have a fee, flown in separate and a fee,etc. We have never paid extra."
4980993,phishfearme,2016-07-11 11:09:00,1242,"another opportunity to pose a issue I've posed numerous times before: a 150 pound person is permitted 100 pounds of gear - a 250 pound person is also allowed 100 pounds of gear. can the airplane differentiate between gear weight and human weight? it can't so from a safety point of view only the total weight matters. a number of outfitters I ""used to"" use would weigh the gear separately then charge for overage - regardless of the weight of the humans. they are clearly looking for a money making opportunity. phish"
