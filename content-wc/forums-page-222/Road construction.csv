4982881,Fishin Fun,2016-07-12 09:44:00,218,"Was wondering if I needed to worry about any road construction up to Ear Falls. We usually cross in I Falls and then take 71 up through Sioux Narrows and then take 105 up from Vermillion Bay. I heard there was some construction east of Fort Frances to 502, but didn't hear of anything west of Fort Frances. Thanks."

From the point where Highway 71 turns north at The Junction west of Emo to Kenora there were multiple places where various smaller repair projects were going on - culvert replacements, shoulder work, etc. Some places were down to one lane and had flagmen. Time delays were modest - no more than five minutes or so for the longest ones. Some rough spots on roads even where there was no active work going on. These were marked so slow down and you will be fine."
4983417,bigwillies,2016-07-12 14:32:00,515,There is construction up the 105. Starts at April Rd(about 4 or 5 miles before cedar lake).Have the pavement gone and will make a mess of your boat if it's wet so cover it up. Only been as far as cedar so don't know how far it is to hit pavement. I'm sure others will know.
4984617,Stringbean,2016-07-13 03:29:00,279,The entire length of the construction area south of Ear Falls is about 10 miles. The crews have done a fairly decent job of grading and adding chemical to hold the dust down. Just went down that road on the 1st of July.

4985353,rather-be-fishin,2016-07-13 09:48:00,429,How much road construction and delay is on Hwy 11 East of Fort Francis to 502? Any construction on 502?
4985641,Stringbean,2016-07-13 10:57:00,279,"You will run into the construction area east of the Noden Causeway. There are numerous new culverts being installed. Each culvert has an ample number of potholes that you just can't miss. When you get to the 502 turn-off, you can see further culvert replacement down the road. Hwy 502 is in good shape."
