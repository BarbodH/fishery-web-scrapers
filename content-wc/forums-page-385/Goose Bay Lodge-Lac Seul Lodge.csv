1530516,btmbncr,2013-01-29 17:31:00,492,"If Lac seul Lodge had an opening I'd go there.I spent two weeks at Goose Bay last summer.I also went and looked at other lodges.If I was planning on fishing up by Ear Falls I'd stay at either Gold Pines, Evergreen Lodge or Gawley's.I've stayed at at Evergreen Lodge,most excellent cabins,Gary and Patty knocked themselves out to make our stay great.We toured Gold Pines,super nice cabins,the family that owns the lodge was very nice. If I planned on fishing Mc Kenzie Bay,which I did alot when I was there last summer,I'd stay at Lac Seul Lodge.Toured the cabins,meet the owners,I'd stay there in a heartbeat.I was at Lac Seul the last week of July and the first week of August.I caught more big fish in McKenzie Bay and down in the main lake basin than up in Steamboat and spots closer to Goose Bay. I would have stayed at Evergreen but they didn't have a cabin open for the time period I was going up for.I made my reservations a little late. If you have anyquestions about Goose Bay PM me.Bill"

Now hes a school teacher, part of the reason we moved our Lac Seul trip to mid-June. Sorry things didn't seem to work out for at Goose Bay. Hang in there!"
1531096,Guest,2013-01-30 19:13:00,0,I would go with gold pines. U can't find a better camp for this price. Owners will bend over backwards for u.

1684273,wallydave,2013-04-17 14:55:00,2151,"She does have daily rates, give her a call or e-mail to see if she has any openings!"
1684481,cspierings,2013-04-17 15:40:00,230,I think folks are leading up to this in a couple responses but I will throw in my opinion for what its worth... Look at the time of the year you are going. The point has already been made that the fishing is typically better in the main lake areas like Mckenzie Bay later in the summer and a lot of early season hot spots closer to Ear Falls aren't as easy to catch fish at. The depending on the time of year you might be looking at longer boat runs and more fuel expense as a result. I can't really comment on having a bad experience with any of the lodges you have asked about. I would think given the economy most have to be responsive and run decent operations to keep folks coming back. Only ever had one bad experience on at lodge on Lac Seul and that was a result of some of the other guests not the lodge owners or there folks. Too much beer led to an unpleasant experience for my wife which I dealt with immediately and let the lodge owner go from there. Wasn't a problem the next night or the rest of the trip. One bad experience out in the boat involved some folks running their boat while intoxicated and nearly hitting us while we were fishing. Told the lodge owner and the OPP took care of that one. So two cases of idiots in 24 years. Pretty good if you ask me. Heck on my local lake I run into that many idiots before lunch. GOOD LUCK!
1529967,jkrawchu,2013-01-28 13:40:00,26,"Hey folks,Our usual trip to Lac Seul this summer may need some modifications and one is our usual resort. I've come to find that Goose Bay and Lac Seul Lodge offer great options and good daily rates. I know they are a distance from each other, but any opinions on either of them would be great. I'm not looking to start anything, just want information on boats, cabins, etc. Our group is usually 6-8 people and we just usually show up and get in the boat and go fishing. We don't want to work to set up...fishing is another story. Also, anyone done the trip to McKenzie form Lac Seul Lodge? We've never been to McKenzie and just wonder how long that trip is and worth it? We usually fish up around Lunker Point and Goose Island, but always wanted to go to McKenzie.Thanks to all."
1529984,wallydave,2013-01-28 14:24:00,2151,"I have been fishing out of Goose Bay for many years, I can't offer any info on LSL. The cabins are pretty nice, each year they get some attention, new decks, some of been remodeled too. The boats are 17.5 Lund outfitters, a nice boat to fish from, with 40-50 or 60 horse Yamaha motors. Its roughly a 45 min. ride to Mackenzie, since our group has a wife and kids now, we don't make that trip.The docks are in great shape and are nice and wide. I'm taking my wife North this year for her first trip to Ontario, so I have a remodeled cabin and a Lund waiting for us in mid-June!Andrea sits down with you and marks the map of where the fish are biting.Any other questions, send me a PM. Good luck!FYI, I am not connected to Goose Bay in any way, other than being a happy camper!"
1530011,fishguide1800,2013-01-28 15:18:00,84,"Have guided moose hunters from both camps,both are nice snd have good equip if your looking at fishing mckenzie bay you would better staying at lsl as iit is much closer and easy to find,if the weathr is good and calm will take about 20 minutes to get to it,but mckenzie is 10 mi long to the far end and there is a lot of good fishing a lot closer by"
1530024,Mike Kansas,2013-01-28 15:38:00,1463,"Been fishing out of Lac Seul lodge for 30 years. They are under new ownership as of last year and the new owners are top notch. Great boats, cabins and service."
1530141,JDP,2013-01-28 21:05:00,1457,"I have no experience with Goose Bay Lodge. I have stayed at Lac Seul Lodge under the previous owner Dan McDonald.Great place to stay. Your decision on where to stay can be influenced by where you plan to fish, For example, if you are planning on fishing McKenzie Bay, Ghost Narrows or making the run up to Broad Lake and Sunlight Lake I would suggest Lac Seul Lodge as it is closer than Goose Bay Lodge to those areas. I believe LSL has an outpost cabin on Sunlight Lake which could be an option to consider as well."
1530237,pike50plus,2013-01-29 08:29:00,584,"My buddy has fished both he would not go back to eagle, loved lac Suel"
1530273,Shotgun,2013-01-29 09:29:00,759,"Have fished in Canada for a week for the past 15 years. Fished out of LSL last year for a week in August. Nice cabins and fishing cleaning house, good hospitality from owners. Dock hands were very helpful. Take my own boat so can't give an opinion on the equipment. The negative for the trip had nothing to do with the lodge but I just can't not bring this up as hopefully some individuals will read this comment. This was my first time fishing Lac Seul and the downside was the fishing etiquette out on the lake, worst I've have ever encountered."
1530290,Hump,2013-01-29 10:12:00,578,"We have fished these some, but find more little northerns than walleyes. Where/how do you fish these islands?"
1530294,jkrawchu,2013-01-29 10:16:00,26,"I've had contact with Andrea at Goose Bay. She's been very good in communicating. I have yet to hear back from Lac Seul Lodge. I am anxious to hear back from them as it is a new part of Lac Seul that our group hasn't experienced yet. I'm sure all fishermen understand our excitement of trying new areas and new lodges. Also, like to read past comments on fishing spots like McKenzie and areas around.I'm not experienced enough fishing Lac Seul just yet to comment on the etiquette. But, I do know it happens everywhere and it can be very frustrating. Hopefully, this improves for you."
1530349,Steve Ediger,2013-01-29 11:32:00,97,"I have never stayed at Goose Bay but have visited the camp on several occasions and have met Andrea. I think Goose Bay would be enjoyed. I have probably stayed at Lac Seul Lodge (25) times over the past fifteen years. I know the cabins to be roomy, clean comfortable with full size kitchens and bathrooms in each, 2 bathrooms in the larger cabins. Almost all boats are 17.5 ft. lunds with 30 or 40 hp Yamaha 4-stroke motors. The fish cleaning facilities are first rate with plenty of freezer space. There is no charge for ice for your cooler or cabin which is very nice. The docks are very stable and wide with plenty of electrical hook-ups for recharging batteries. If you are bringing your own boat, the boat ramps are good as well as the trailer parking. If you want to fish McKinzie bay it is much closer than coming down from Goose Bay. It is probably a twenty minute trip. You also will have access to the South Inlet, Bay of Islands, Manitoba Point, Sunlight Lake, and other well known fishing hot spots that are easily located. Ratt Bay, where LSL is located is also a very good fishing spot especially if you want to go out for an hour or two after supper. I have never talked to anyone who was not happy with their stay at Lac Seul Lodge."
