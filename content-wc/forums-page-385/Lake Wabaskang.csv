1644465,Kevin R,2013-04-07 06:58:00,305,"I think if you are used to doing fly in fishing lakes Wabaskang will be completely different experiment. I first started fishing Wabaskang in 1970 & fishing was superb it stayed exellent until about 1998, it became average for a few years now its tough. Let me explain in 1970 you could catch pike tying a lure on your anchor rope almost anywhere in the lake, today you will need to refine your tactics to have success."

1685025,JLester,2013-04-17 17:54:00,13,The two boy's and I stayed at Tall Pines last Aug. Steve and Andrea are great. Cabins are nice and the boats are very clean and always full of gas when you need it we up graded to a bigger boat. The Wed. get together is great to get to meet all the people at the camp. Steve and Andrea are very helpful on the fishing to witch made it easier. Planning to go back asap.

1688289,warrior2090,2013-04-18 12:22:00,12,"This May will be my 42nd week spent on Wabaskang. I have been staying since it was John Morgan had the camp in 1985. Dave is a great camp operator and keeps the camp in great shape. I feel like the fishing is better today than in 1985. If you have questions, feel free to message me."
1688649,Guest,2013-04-18 13:59:00,0,"I have gone to Peffleys camp the past three years and I have never been disappointed. There is something truly majestic about camp. Your on the north part of the lake by some of the best fishing on the lake in my opinion!! Short boat ride to mean lake, mud and wine for alternative fishing experiences as well. Dave and his crew have made it a time to remember and best of all it doesn't break the bank to go there. Too notch service, clean and comfortable cabins, awesome fishing, and activities at camp through out the week have made going to Peffleys Camp a true Canadian addiction!! I would recommend Peffleys to any of my friends and family looking for one of the best fishing trips u will ever go on!!"
1691289,utts2,2013-04-19 08:07:00,3,I have been to peffley's last year. fishing was good. cabins are good. location very good. service fair to poor.
1506199,searlesm,2012-11-21 14:07:00,3,"Im Thinking of going to Lake Wabaskang this year. We usually do a fly in, but money is getting tight. What are your guys opinion on the lake and where do you suggest to stay. I will have a total of 4 guys going. Thank you for your feedback"
1506237,ftfarms,2012-11-21 17:10:00,444,We stay at gawleys park view camp in may and some year go back later in the year. The gawleys are great people and have a nice camp. There prices are real reasonable also.
1506251,JAY221,2012-11-21 18:10:00,877,"I have stayed at Kingfishers twice & have no complaints with the current owners. I have talked to Dave @ Peffleys which is farther into the lake than the others if you want to get more remote. I have never heard anybody speak bad of any of the camps that I can remember. We like early July just because of the more consistent weather. The fishing is fine but I don't get to do much when the wife goes & I am baiting hooks & taking fish off more than catching fish. Later, Jay"
1506268,searlesm,2012-11-21 18:56:00,3,Thanks Guys ill look into those places. How is the fishing on that lake?
1506593,trapper_john,2012-11-23 10:48:00,83,"We have been on Wabbie many times and have six or seven stays at Kingfisher. I can recommend it highly. They will do all they can to put you on fish. Good people, very nice cabins and very clean. In the evening you can drag a chair down to the dock and jig up walleys while enjoying a cold one. I'm sure that the other camps are good too but I don't ever mess with what's best for me."
1506745,Glenman12,2012-11-23 20:30:00,762,Kingfisher is a nice place ..you turn left off 105 right into their lot..cabins are clean..would recommend it..
1506830,JAY221,2012-11-24 09:35:00,877,"When I posted earlier I forgot to mention Lester! He is your connection to EVERYTHING when you are at Kingfishers. He will have your boat ready when you are ready, put you on fish & anything else that needs done. I hope he is there when I return. Later, Jay"
1506898,moose-hunter,2012-11-24 14:29:00,982,Anyone stay at Tall Pines since Pete and Donna sold the place?
1507723,UKBDM,2012-11-27 14:57:00,178,"We have fished Wabaskang from Jim and Julie's Wabaskang Camp (its nearer the south end) for the last four years. Prices are very reasonable and they are great people from Iowa.We fish the last week of June and typically catch walleye, pike, smallmouth bass, and perch while we are there. I have never caught 25 walleyes in one day but there are people in camp that do. I'm still learning walleye fishing. Pike fishing is awesome with many 40"" plus fish boated every week. Smallmouth bass over 18"" are not uncommon either.Wabaskang is not what I would call ""remote"" as you can normally see another boat while fishing. It is a very fertile lake with stained water and is about 15,000 acres.Do a Wabaskang search on this site and you will find quite a bit of info from others who know more than I."
1508606,Stu,2012-11-30 06:45:00,472,"Moose, We have stayed there 3 times since Pete & Donna left. The new owners are Steve & Andrea Grupe. Great people, it's basically the same place."
