1643954,Terwalleye,2013-04-06 20:04:00,166,BUMP!My Fishin Pardner just got a new Humminbird. Wondering if anyone has used any of the Navionics chips on Cedar. The one attached to Perrault and just north of Vermillion BayThanks in advance
1643986,Oldschool,2013-04-06 20:20:00,163,Just give a call to one of the lodge owners on Cedar or Perrault. They will know without question.
1645209,Bad Santa,2013-04-07 10:55:00,100,I have a 'bird 998 with the Navionics bundle. The map for Cedar/Perrault showed that we were fishing on land several times. This is older data. Not sure what a more current chip would show.
1646745,Terwalleye,2013-04-07 20:03:00,166,Thanks for the heads up Bad Santa. Can I ask whcih year you bought the chip?
