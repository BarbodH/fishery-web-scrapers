1652393,LOW1,2013-04-09 10:14:00,2828,And don't forget that if both parents are not accompanying the minor that the absent parent or parents should provide a letter authorizing the minor to travel to Canada. This is especially true if the parents are divorced. And list the telephone number of the nontravelling parent in the letter.
1652705,cuamb,2013-04-09 11:16:00,203,I had my wife sign the letter in front of a notary public. Never had anyone look at it on the way into Canada but they did coming back to the U.S. I don't know about the passport. Laws have changed since my son went along.

1652953,LOW1,2013-04-09 12:02:00,2828,"Get the passport. Passports are more of a U.S. requirement for returning than they are a Canadian requirement for entering and techically are not needed if under 16 and an original birth certificate or other proof of citizenship is available. In the unlikely event that a medical flight back to the US is necessary, the lack of a passport for the minor could cause a delay."
