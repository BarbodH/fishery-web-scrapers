1666801,dutchboy,2013-04-12 19:28:00,5717,Not everybody looks for the same things in a vacation. This place might be right up the alley of alot of the groups members. I wouldn't worry about it. Like everybody says if you are really into fishing there is plenty of water nearby. Another thought is............with no fishing pressure are you sure this is a bad lake??? It just might be a untapped treasure. Relax and plan on having a good time. Life is far to short to get worked up over something nobody here knows anything about.
1667169,thornskin,2013-04-12 21:55:00,18,"Thanks for the input guys, unfortunately the brother already booked it. Here's hoping that its a untapped hidden treasure and not just a water hazard for drunks!!!"
1667937,lassh,2013-04-13 08:23:00,553,"I'm pretty sure I've been to Andy Lake. It was in 1972 so the info won't do you much good, but it brings back some great memories. Four guys between Freshman and Sophomore years in college, little to no fishing experience, borrowed 6 horse that barely ran, rented boat. Crossing Minnesota at night in the fog trying to follow the taillights ahead, the Holiday Gas Stations were like oases in the wilderness. We camped on the little island across from the parking area. Nice natural rock slot to harbor the rented boat. Warm Carling Black Label. A four inch rain in a few hours created rivers that flowed through the tent. It did drain better due to the holes that the mice chewed through the tent. We used food cans as projectiles to dispatch mice. We caught pike and perch. We fished for smallies also but I don't remember catching any and don't know if there were any in there. There were walleyes in the lake. Someone had logged an 8 1/2 pounder on the board at the bait shop. I also think there were lakers in there as we saw guys fishing dipsy diver type devices. Hellbenders, Bombers, Lazy Ikes were the lures. I won $5 by catching a perch on a Vibra-Bat the sonic lure. Its so effective that its illegal in some places you know. I also remember coming back from my early morning solo venture seeing my three friends sitting on the rock ledge above the boat and the looks on their faces when they informed me that we're leaving to get back in time to go to some college social event to meet the new girls coming in. Its not that I didn't like girls, but in my mind there were plenty of opportunities for girls and this was the first and only time I had the opportunity to experience the splendor and natural beauty of Canada. I was outvoted. I know I'm not adding much value to your post, but I'm pretty sure that Andy Lake is the lake we ended up on when we couldn't find ""Black Lake"". This was my first taste of Canada and its been in my blood ever since. Thank you for the flash back."
1669473,thornskin,2013-04-13 18:12:00,18,"Just talked to the owner of the resort, she said it is a small lake but has some good bass and walleye. She said the lake has depths 20-40ft with one hole going to 65ft. It's also a catch and release lake so hopefully there are some big ones in there."
1624449,thornskin,2013-04-01 14:15:00,18,Planning a fishing trip to Andy Lake Ontario and would like some knowledge of the lake. How is the fishing in June? How deep is the water? Are there a lot of reefs and hazards? What species of fish should we target? If anyone has any information on this lake I would apprieciate it as I can not find much info on this lake.
1627722,Slushfish,2013-04-02 11:41:00,263,"I stayed just North of there 4yrs hunting and 4 yrs south of there fishing. My question is, what made you choose Andy Lake? Not trying to be nosy, just curious. Provided we are talking about the same Andy Lake on 17 south of Kenora? Sorry, never been on that lake, but lots of time around it. Slushfish"
1628186,thornskin,2013-04-02 13:39:00,18,"Unfortunately I had no input on where we are going. A friends brother planned and booked everything before I knew where we were going. It looks nice from what little I've seen, and there are a lot of lakes close by if that one isn't good. The lodge itself looks really nice (andy Lake Resort) and I don't know why someone would build such a nice resort if it wasn't decent. That being said I can't find anything about it."
1628290,Slushfish,2013-04-02 13:58:00,263,"Yes, it is nice. From what little I've talked to owners, they seem nice too. We stay on Blindfold Lake in the fall, hunting. We were told it has good numbers of crappie, but there are tons of lakes there and LOTW if you want a change of pace. It'll be great. My worst trip up there was awesome. Be careful and have fun. Slushfish"
1628546,thornskin,2013-04-02 15:03:00,18,Thanks for the input.
1641081,thornskin,2013-04-05 19:38:00,18,How does this resort stay open if nobody has been there? Somebody must have been to this lake and know something. Anyone????
1662609,thornskin,2013-04-11 18:36:00,18,Either this lake is a hidden treasure or a crap lake. There has to be someone out there that knows something. Need help!!!
1662873,stillangling,2013-04-11 19:36:00,149,The lake is tiny. There is a paved highway right to the shore. This is NW Ontario. Why would anyone pick a spot like that? Enough said.
1663217,Outfitter17,2013-04-11 21:36:00,127,"Thornskin,I think stillangling nailed it. I have driven by Andy Lake many times, it is right off the hwy and it is very very tiny. Why don't you talk to your friends brother and find out why he picked this place? Also, You can just call the camp to get the info you are looking for? I get several calls a year from guys in the fishing group asking questions, not just the guy who booked the trip.After you talk to the owner or your friends brother and get a little feed back regarding the lake, make your own decision about if you really want to go or not. You will be spending your money to pay for the trip, if you don't think it's worth it don't go. Skip this year, and maybe you can help with the research on a trip for next year."
1664225,zeebee,2013-04-12 08:47:00,1144,"Its setup for conferences and family vacations. Not geared to fishermen. Bring your laptop, swim tube and fondue....youll have a great time.Have a contest for the guy that can find the spot with the strongest wireless signal. Point being.....do your research! Donrt book the 1st place that pops up on google. Nothing wrong with Andy's but it is what it is."
