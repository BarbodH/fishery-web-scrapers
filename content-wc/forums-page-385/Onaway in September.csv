Any opinions on the weather and fishing in that area at that time would be appreciated."
1678689,SinOrSwim,2013-04-16 08:54:00,1528,"This is when we go. We will be at Onaway from Sept 5 til 11 I think. You have to plan for everything this time of year. Could be very cold but usually cold in the morning and warm in teh afternoon. Last year we went the week after this and I probably only put on long sleeves once or twice. It was quite warm while fishing almost everyday. I wear shorts and a t-shirt. I then start layering above that with long sleeves, fleece etc. I wear my rain bibs as pants over my shorts. This way, if it stays cold I am warm. If it gets warm, I take off rain gear and am comfortable in shorts. Days you start out with a ton of gear, stocking hats and gloves and sitting there sweating in shorts and t-shirts in the afternoon."
1679025,vaquero01,2013-04-16 09:59:00,101,Is the camp busy in September? I am going to call tonight to try and switch reservations.
1679537,Steve Ediger,2013-04-16 11:54:00,97,I went to Lac Seul Lodge (just north of Onaway) last year during the last week of September. First time I had been there that late in the season. I absolutely loved it!! Cool crisp mornings with a little frost. Leaves turning colors. You pretty much have the lake (and the highways) to yourself that time of year. Probably the best walleye fishing I have had as far as catching consistently good sized fish. Most were slot size or over and they were hungry. We are planning another trip for September this year. Can't wait.
1679825,teddi,2013-04-16 12:46:00,349,"sand banks, south inlet, ghost narrows, and poplar narrows are your best bets at that time of year."
1682617,SinOrSwim,2013-04-17 08:29:00,1528,It was almost full last year at that time. We have 14 in our group this year with possibly a couple more.
1690345,LoDo,2013-04-18 21:34:00,721,"MacKenzie Bay baby! Find some rocky points. Ghost Narrows is good too. You'll love Onaway Lodge. I like the lodges that are south of Ear Falls along Highway 105. The boat ride to MacKenzie, ghost narrows, etc... isn't as long as the ride from the lodges in Ear Falls. Lac Seul Lodge, Fishermans Cove and Onaway are my favs. Onaway being my top choice. If you really want to get crazy venture beyond Manitoba Pt. Big water! Have fun!"
1690913,vaquero01,2013-04-19 06:58:00,101,Talked to Blair last night. Got some new dates. Thanks for the fishing info every one.Sorry I'll miss you SinOrSwim
1692345,SinOrSwim,2013-04-19 12:28:00,1528,"Looks like our first night there will be your last? We arrive on the 5th in the late afternoon usually. We will be in Cabin 3 right there by the fish house. Stop by for a beer or two. Oh and bring precise GPS coordinates with where you caught the most and biggest fish. Me, MorganMan and Hawkfan. Look for the big fat bald brothers with goatees! lol"
