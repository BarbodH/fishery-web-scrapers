1681641,Daniel Johnson,2013-04-16 20:51:00,121,"Check out Fin-teck's bottom bouncers. They have a quick change weight system that works pretty slick. You can change the weight of your bouncer in a copple seconds without unhooking your line or leader. Makes changing with the conditions quick and easy. Can take 7 sizes of weights (1/2 to 4 oz.) in very little space. They are an R bend bouncer, so you need to tie directly to the wire. After I started using these, I suprised myself how often I switch out weights and how big a difference it makes!"
1652881,MOfish,2013-04-09 11:47:00,39,I'm making a shopping list of tackle for my upcoming Lac Seul trip. I'd like to purchase some jigheads and bottom bouncers. I don't know which colors or sizes would be best to bring. Any help? Thanks in advance
1653017,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2013-04-09 12:19:00,629,"MOfish:#1. I myself like to Bottom Bounce & use an assortment of 1&1/2, 2, 2&1/2 & 3 0z.#2. I backtroll shorelines & electric troll reefs with a 2 hook worm harness or a single hook minnow spinner rig. My goal is to keep the line as vertical as possible & never let the line exceed a 45 degree angle. The above weights are used to match the speed, water conditions & depths I'm fishing while maintaining a vertical line & ""Jig-Walking"" the bouncer off the bottom. #3. Backtrolling speeds @ 1.0 to 1.3 mph & electric @ 0.5 to 0.8Have fun on your trip to LacSuel, it is a ""Good"" fishery. Set the Hook, CRJohn"
1653137,tv4fish,2013-04-09 12:42:00,2694,"If you're planning on ""vertical"" jigging - I would suggest an assortmemnt of sizes and colors (more so on the size vs the color). If you don't have ANY breeze and are shallow - the lighter the better for feeling the bite (1/8 -1/4 oz.) However, if you are in a good breeze, you will want to go heavier to keep it down there (3/8 oz)."

1655185,1jigfish2,2013-04-09 22:12:00,110,"We only jig fish. We use 1/8, 1/4, & 3/8 all of the time.Favorite colors are: chartreuse, green, red, white, blue."

1660241,BornToFish,2013-04-11 07:59:00,1224,"I routinely vertically jig for walleyes in NW Ontario and do pretty well with this presentation. I've been asked by many anglers what color jig should they use. I've found that color isn't as important as many folks think. Sure, there are days when color seems to make a difference, but for me there are more days when color doesn't matter that much. I've found time and time again that weight of the jig is normally more important to fishing success than is color. The rule of thumb that I go with is to use the lightest jig that allows me to consistently feel the bottom of the lake, no matter what the depth is. This weight of jig can vary from day to day, depending on things like depth and wave action. I routinely use 1/16 ounce jigs, sometimes 1/8 ounce and rarely 1/4 ounce jigs. I fish these jigs with a light power rod and six pound monofilament line. The sensitivity of this combination is outstanding and puts many fish into the boat. I'm very glad that I abandoned my 1/4 ounce jigs and medium power rod, as the fish just seem to bite better.I use the same principle when pulling bottom bouncers with live bait harnesses/cranks. I use the lightest bottom bouncers that allow me to consistently feel the bottom of the lake, but normally step up to a medium-light or medium power rod as the weight of the bottom bouncer is often heavier than the jigs that I use. I hope the above helps you in making your choices for equipment."
1669049,Jigger1,2013-04-13 15:59:00,234,"I would agree on going as light on jigs (1/8 Â– 1/4oz are my preferred) and bouncers (3/4 to 1oz) as conditions will allow, I try to stay at or under a 1/4oz jig regardless of season. I also agree on jig color being somewhat over thought, but with that being said I think there is a lot to say for confidence a particular angler has with a given color. However I prefer a medium power fast action rod for jigging, medium heavy fast action for bottom bouncing. In my opinion the power of the rod is more about the fight and I always want to try and maintain the upper hand when fighting big eyes. I own quality rods so sensitivity isn't an issue; I can feel just about anything. Again I have a high level of confidence in my setups and I think this makes all the difference in the world."
1679377,swany_jd,2013-04-16 11:16:00,9,"I'll echo most of what's said above. Definitely have a variety of sizes 1/8, 1/4, 3/8. Colors seem to vary year to year, but we've found both chartreuse and white (or one of those in a combo color) to be successful to some extent every year. My favorite quote regarding color came from Ben Beattie (not sure if he still browses these boards) when he was our guide up on Lac Seul a few years back. When we asked him if he had any suggestions on color, he simply stated: ""I don't believe in color.....but if you don't have white, you're screwed."" Needless to say, everyone in our group comes with a stock of white jigs every trip now."
