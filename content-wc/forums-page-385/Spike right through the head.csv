1666145,2746,2013-04-12 16:08:00,3206,"Good one!A few years back during a stay at five lakes lodge on Gullrock, when Bud and Malinda were running it, one of the guests caught and butchered a walleye that would have been well over 25"". That's against the rules at all the camps on Gullrock. The skeleton of that walleye, that Bud had fished out of the gut barrel, was nailed to the dock steps the next morning with a sign reminding guest of the lake rules. Pretty effective!"

1669249,Sportdog,2013-04-13 17:26:00,6735,This is far and away one of the best and most level headed posts that I've seen on WC in a real long time. Judging past behavior by the standards that exist today is like comparing apples and oranges. Thanks for bringing some well needed levity to the site.

Hard to get me swimmin for a couple of years after that."

1673834,Guest,2013-04-15 03:46:00,0,Must be an old custom concerning members of the pike family. I can remember seeing the heads of pickerel nailed to a pine tree at a boat launch at Promised Land Lake in the Pennsylvania Poconos over fifty years ago.
1664777,Pikeslayer8,2013-04-12 10:52:00,1460,"Used to be that there were a lot of giant pike heads spiked to trees at the various fish camps I've been to. Not so much anymore. When I was younger and I first saw this, I thought it was cool. I wanted to catch the monster pike and spike it's head to a tree so that future people to arrive at camp will see my pike. I think it is a testament to us all that there are way fewer trophy pike being killed just because it would be legal to do so. The conservation efforts displayed on the lake translates to a pikehead free zone at camp and makes for one less mosquito attractant. I guess it's been a long winter for me to be thinkin bout this funky subject, but I'd like to hear your take."
1664841,Juls,2013-04-12 11:11:00,13414,"Funny you should bring that up. This was on Lindner's Angling Edge Facebook page this morning...A photo by Bill Lindner. I remember my cousins, who lived on a farm and had a small river on their land, catching them and putting the heads on the side of the barn to dry out, like those pictured here. They did not waste the fish, they were eaten by a family of 7."
1664857,emma17,2013-04-12 11:14:00,436,I prefer to think of me and the fish being on the same team working toward the same goal of living a long and charitable life. Spiking heads like Atilla the Hun is a bit adversarial for my liking.

1665321,Nimstug,2013-04-12 12:55:00,2605,"I'll admit I haven't been north as many times as others, but I've never seen a fsh head nailed to a tree. To a wood plaque, yes. Never occured to me and don't see it happening for me in the future."
1665561,MrSimon,2013-04-12 13:46:00,922,"I have to admit, the sight of a huge pike head with big sharp teeth spiked to a tree ads a certain flair to a fishing camp. Sure, I'd rather see that same head attached to its body swimming around in the lake, but if the fish was legally taken and eaten, I don't really mind. I'm a pretty die hard C&R guy, but sometimes we get a bit too caught up in conservation to remember our roots. I remember being a kid and keeping and cleaning bucket after bucket of walleye .... and dragging my first 40"" pike all around camp before cleaning it too. Such behavior now would be shameful and cause all kinds of flame wars on the forums ..... but at the time it was freak'n awesome! And those are the memories that keep me coming back. All that to say, lets not get too bent out of shape when we see pike heads on trees .... heck, maybe even let it get you excited to go out there and catch one of your own."
1665609,HeHooksHimself,2013-04-12 13:57:00,725,"Just in case you think this is one-sided, our favorite camp has a board in the boathouse that has lures attached to it. under each lure is a description and size of the person that a pike caught with that lure. Most of the pike practiced catch and release of the person, but it usually involved hook removal by the camp owner. In my case, the note under my former lure says something like, ""In June of 2003 a 23"" northern pike caught 250lb. HeHooksHimself with this lure."" Perhaps you can figure out how I got my handle. I wouldn't mind nailing that particular pike's head to a tree, he's probably a trophy by now."
1665713,vteye,2013-04-12 14:20:00,812,I really like fishing for big pike. The prehistoric nature of that fish and power is a real rush. The idea of killing a 6-8 pounder for camp meat is fine but trophy fish go back. I will never forget my 7 year old telling mein no uncertain terms I need heavier line on his rod after losing a nicepike. For that reason and kids everywhere I try to release all the pike especially in my local waters.
1665809,v-bay gord,2013-04-12 14:38:00,3168,"Sure, pike heads are fun, but here at the lodge I have expanded on that old tradition. Here's a lovely couple that I caught throwing a beer can into Clearwater Creek."
