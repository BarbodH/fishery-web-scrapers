1661577,Guest,2013-04-11 13:12:00,0,I'm going to agree witht he rest of the gang. Too cumbersome. We use L&M fly-in resorts. He has solar and generators at all the outposts. It's far enough from the cabins and pretty quite. Just my 2 cents.
1664849,onetimedave,2013-04-12 11:14:00,502,"If the outfitter wants ""U"" to use a generator then let the outfitter furnish same with fuel."
1664969,RickOnt,2013-04-12 11:34:00,217,With the fridge being electric you would need to run the generator 24/7.That would be a deal breaker for me and I would look at other options.I think the best set up would be a combination of propane and solar with the generator as a back up to the solar.
1653561,tooski,2013-04-09 14:58:00,393,Received an interesting call from an outfitter today who said he is thinking of going all electric for his fridge and lights. The only thing running off propane would be his stoves. Not startling of itself but he said he was thinking of having each group bring their own portable generator. His reasoning is that many of his clients now require CPAP packs for their fly-ins so they need electricity at the camps. He is thinking most clients are outdoors/sportsman and they probably have one or two guys in their group that have a portable generator. His idea is the generator would not count against your weight allowance and he would supply the fuel. My question is (and likely his question also) how many groups do not have anyone owning a portable generator? Also would you be willing to purchase one as a group for your fly-in? Thanks for any opinions.
1653625,SinOrSwim,2013-04-09 15:23:00,1528,"Why wouldn't he just buy a generator? That makes no sense to fly in a generator with every single group. Plus, what if your generator didn't connect right or had issues? You have no frig for the week? Many are loud, you would have to make sure you put gas in it all the time.I have one, but would have no desire to take it with every year."
1653633,Crede,2013-04-09 15:25:00,134,"To my knowledge, no one in our group has a generator portable enough that we would want to fly it into a camp for a week and then back out. Would we purchase one for this? I guess that if we REALLY wanted to go to that lake we would. However, we would probably think it somewhat strange that the outfitter would prefer to have each group take in/bring out a generator as opposed to providing the generator at each camp. Whether true or not, we would probably wonder if the outfitter was in financial difficulty (not providing the generator) and also question what other aspects of the camp (boats, motors, etc.) were being neglected."
1653913,bigwalleye1,2013-04-09 16:26:00,2632,"your generator, your problem...One less thing to maintain if he can get you to bring yours. Every group loads and unloads their own stuff, so less work for him gasssing, checking, maintaining, etc."
1654313,pikeman14,2013-04-09 17:53:00,144,"That's absolutely ridiculous. If he want's to keep up with other lodge owners, than he should raise his rates and buy the proper gear. If he wants to keep the trip ""roughing it"" than maybe he might loose a client or few. IMO it just doesn't seem reasonable."
1655049,Pooch,2013-04-09 21:12:00,4619,"Asking guests to bring their own generator is a little cumbersome. Maybe some remote camps already do this.I wonder what the logic is to switch away from propane other than it is a hassle to move tanks in and out. Most guys get along well changing out their own tanks when needed.If I were a camp owner I'd be uncomfortable relying on guests to operate and take care of a small generator that they didn't themselves own.Propane and or some solar system still seems appropriate for a remote cabin.If a group wants or needs power for medical reasons then they might want to consider a very small portable unit themselves, but bringing in a unit large enough to run lights and a fridge and maybe a freezer seems a stretch.It is his camp and after ""training"" his customer base maybe it could work for all concerned.Pooch"
1655433,oleJoe,2013-04-10 05:31:00,114,"Our group of 6 rents a 15 passenger van and we all ride in it. There is no room for a generator in the van and how big does it have to be? I would have to say no, will find another outfitter."
1655481,octanehi5,2013-04-10 05:46:00,1104,"The last thing I want to hear on a fly in trip is a generator. time to find a new outfitter. propane has worked for me for 25 yrs. If it has lights with reg 110 volt electric, an indoor toilet,next will tv and cable,cell towers.It would not be a remote fly in trip now would it. Genarators make a great power back up.not a full time sorce. to run your camp it would have to run 24hrs a day. I would like to get some of the stuff the outfitter is smokin,"
1655729,MrSimon,2013-04-10 07:06:00,922,"I agree!Hearing a generator running 24/7 (and it would have to to keep the fridge cold) would destroy the experience for me.The outpost we stayed at last year had propane stove/fridge/hotwater and solar lights. There was a small honda generator at the cabin that we could use to charge up trolling motor batteries, camera batteries etc. We ran the generator for a couple hours every other afternoon and that's all we needed. It was the perfect balance in my opinion.I would never go to a camp that required me to bring my own generator to run the appliances and lights. There are tons of other places that do things better.EDIT. Forgot to mention, two of our guys use CPAP machines. We took in a fully charged high quality deep cycle battery and they were both able to hook up to the one battery and it lasted all week. IF guests need CPAP machines, its their responsibility to figure out how to power them."
1655753,tooski,2013-04-10 07:11:00,393,"Personally, I agree with Octane. I'd much prefer propane over a generator. Don't care for the noise and maintenance of a generator. My experience with generators at outposts (admittedly only three of my trips) is that unless you are willing to run the generator all night the fridge does not do an adequate job being off all nite. The benefits to the outfitter would be eliminating the hassle of flying in multiple propane tanks plus the cost of a new electric fridge is about 1/3 the cost of a propane fridge. I can easily see his point but I'm not sure his clients will agree. We are certainly seeing changes in the facilities at outposts as it seems more and more outfitters are offering electricity, running water and even indoor commodes. Wondering what the next five years will bring. Thanks for your opinions..."
