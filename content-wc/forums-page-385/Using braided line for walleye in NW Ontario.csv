1683361,JIGSTER,2013-04-17 11:03:00,30,"Last year I used PP with an 8lb. floro leader(cabelas brand i believe). I had problems with the leader breaking on hooksets. Maybe to much hookset, but i tried to ""tame it down"" and still had problems(would break one or two a day). I hate to think those were the 30 inchers! lol I was thinking about trying a fireline crystal leader this year? Anybody ever try the pp with a fireline leader?"
1683705,zeebee,2013-04-17 12:28:00,1144,Used a 10lb Yo-zuri flouro leader in past and have never had a break/bite-off.
1684777,sidewinder,2013-04-17 16:47:00,96,"I like fire line smoke(grey) 14lbs strength 6lb dia All around goto line for everything in the water I use my sleeve to pull loose snags wrap it around arm several times and pull Usually straightens hook out Headed to wabby before walleye season opens!!

1575418,PJM,2013-03-19 21:00:00,3516,Rocko I went from using mono to Berkley Crystal Fireline and I lose fewer jigs. This is not a braided line and it sees to hold up great and I fish a lot of rock piles on Lake of the Woods.

1575665,PJM,2013-03-19 22:52:00,3516,"IA Yes I will be there on opener, how about yourself."
1576034,Ia Walihntr,2013-03-20 06:30:00,320,Will be there Friday afternoon. Will try to make it over sometime during the week to chat.
1577834,zeebee,2013-03-20 13:42:00,1144,Thats nice guys but those of us who were following this thread really dont care.
1577858,rocko0305,2013-03-20 13:52:00,138,"I ended up spooling the 8 lb. Fireline crystal on my ML jigging rod for my upcoming trip. Even though the trip is in late May, and we won't be having to target walleye very deep, I still decided to opt for the extra sensitivity. Now, I just need to train myself to not have a huge hook set, but I don't think it will be too big of an adjustment for me. The only concern I still have is having to take more time to get unsnagged, rather than just breaking off and retying like I would have normally done with mono. Maybe someone who has been to Beteau can comment on how prone that lake is to snags during spring walleye fishing.My one remaining question for you all is whether I should tie a 10 lb. fluoro leader using a double uni, tie a 10 lb. fluoro leader using a micro swivel to avoid line twist, or tie the Fireline right to the jig. Personally, I was actually leaning towards the first option I mentioned, and dealing with line twist by letting line out behind the boat a few times during the week. I appreciate the help."
1577938,jambi,2013-03-20 14:15:00,504,"I've used mono in the past but last year I tried both fireline crystal 6# and power pro 10#. No brainer the power pro was the winner. I found the fireline had coiled up, tried the old methods to get undone but it wouldn't take. I've considered the flouro leaders but wont be doing it. Tying the power pro directly to the lures worked fine. A little hard to change up jigs etc but some good snippers and its not that bad."
1591170,Further North,2013-03-23 20:52:00,2008,"I've used braid for a few years, but use a different strategy: I stay with the same diameter, but go up in strength.8 lb. diameter braid is about 30 lb....I don't loose many lures, but I've straightened out a lot of hooks....In Canada, I tie right to the lure/jig, and often do the same here in WI, especially for bass. For pike/musky, I use about 18"" of tie-able leader that I tie right to the lure with a loop knot (Rapala knot). For finicky fish, I tie on a hunk of 8# flouro.....Check your line often if you're on abrasive rocks - it sucks when you snap off a big fish because you abraded the line on something and didn't re-tie...."
1593154,[emailÂ protected],2013-03-24 14:55:00,21,"I switched to braided line about 5 years ago, and I will continue to use it. In North Carolina I use mono line the last 4' - 5' because it seems the bass see the braid. You do need to do a double loop before you pull your knot tight. However, every year when I go to a fly-in in Ontario I use straight braid (green) and a 12"" steel leader (black). I do this because where I fish both the Walleye and Northern Pike are in high numbers, so I don't risk fishing without the steel leader. I do extremely well on both kinds of fish. Not in any particular order: I really like the braid because 1) small diameter 2) no memory 3) very strong 4) if you get a snag you can simply relax it, back up, and most times it comes free 5) it doesn't stretch 6) casts very easy. The downside is 1) if you get a snag you need to release the tension because it doesn't stretch and 2) If you really get a bad snag and can't free it you will have to cut the line because you are not going to pull it until it breaks. Tom"
1678665,HuskerFrank,2013-04-16 08:49:00,24,"I use 20# 832 with a 10# fluorocarbon leader attached via double uni knot. If you get hung in the rocks, you can break free at the fluoro end. I've been very happy with the results and have landed some huge pike while walleye fishing the last couple years."
1560073,Whopper,2013-03-15 20:33:00,340,I've been using 8lb Berkly fireline and tie a six foot fluoro leader using a uni to uni knot and absolutely love it. I really like the fireline after a year or two of use after some of the outside coating has worn off. I have landed some really nice pike over forty inches while jigging for walleyes with very few bite offs
1560137,Golden Eagle,2013-03-15 21:07:00,2642,"I can vouch for the nice pike over 40""."
1563353,Rich B,2013-03-16 18:20:00,1081,"I switched from Triline XL to PowerPro 8 lb test (low vis green) a number of years ago and like it better - it's limp and I don't get many bite-offs (a few from Musky) - it's more pricey, but after 2 years use I reverse my line to another reel. Rich B"
1563377,Limeyangler,2013-03-16 18:23:00,563,Tie your Flouro leader to a micro swivel....less line twist( walleye hate helicopter minnows....lol) and less hassle to retie after a break off. Plus a micro will go through the guides.
1566225,HuskerFrank,2013-03-17 14:21:00,24,"You can't go wrong with a good braid. I prefer Sufix 832, also with a fluoro leader attached via a double uni knot."
1566425,Mike Borger,2013-03-17 15:13:00,1554,"For those of you who like braid but aren't a fan of fluoro leaders, try spooling your reels with 4lb or 5lb Power Pro in the low vis green color. It's drastically thinner than the 8lb which seems to be most popular and is super strong. It's plenty finnesse enough tied directly to your jig, especially so when fishing remote Canadian waters."
1570145,Sportdog,2013-03-18 16:26:00,6735,"My eyes aren't what they used to be so before my trip last year I pre-tied 18 inch 8# floro leaders with the jig attached and a loop knot on the other end. I had a very small barrel swivel tied to my 10/4 Fireline and feed the loop of floro thru the swivel. This set up made changing jig sizes and/or colors quick and easy, replacing break-offs, and prevented line twist. I stored them on 3/4"" foam pipe insulation purchased at the hardware store cut in about 10 inch sections secured with the jig hook and a toothpick. It worked very well for me. Much easier for me to tie leaders at the kitchen table than on the water. As always, YMMV."
1570177,Guest,2013-03-18 16:35:00,0,"June when we are fishing in less than 20'of water i stick to 8# mono, strip off 10 feet every day and if the memory gets to bad restring around the 5th or 6th day. My results seem to be better with the mono in shallower water. In august when i come back and fishing deeper water i switch to power pro and a fluro carbon leader obtaining excellent feel, hooking setting and results."
1573274,johnboat,2013-03-19 12:55:00,2014,My question to the braided users is this: Does the braided line stay as vertical as what a 6lb. vanish transition would be? This would be for jigging. Been thinking about making the switch to braided myself.
1574042,fosterthedog,2013-03-19 16:26:00,51,"My first though is braid has at least 2X the rated breaking strength as mono or flouro and sinks a lot faster as its 10X thinner (a lot more feel). Second is braided cost 3X the cost of mono and if snagged will take you a month of Sundays (or a knife if your smart) to get unsnagged. Third is a personal thing, Flouro leaders get bit, they have better resistance to abrasion, and have stretch for a good set on finnicky fish. My solution was to spool my reels with a base of mono say half the spool, then uni 2 uni (5 wraps) the mono to braid and fill the rest of the spool. At the end flouro, a length from your 2nd or 3rd guide from the tip to the reel, rated to the fishing your doing with the same knot except do it 4 wraps on the braid and 6 on the flouro pull it together slow (it makes a cone shape that goes thru the guides easy when your really bent). You'll never get down to the mono on the spool and when the braid starts to flatten out you just replace it. Hope everyone has a great trip and lots of fish."
1555697,rocko0305,2013-03-14 22:28:00,138,"In the past, I've used nothing other than 6# or 8# monofilament on my fly-in trips to NW Ontario. This has always made it quick and easy to break off and retie when snagged on rocks or bit off by a pike when jigging for walleyes. However, I've bought some 8# Fireline that I had planned on using on my upcoming trip, but I'm wondering if the extra sensitivity will be worth it, since I will have a harder time breaking off my line, as well as having to tie a fluoro leader each time. Do any of you use superline for walleye when you are at an outpost camp? Thanks in advance."
1555761,packpro,2013-03-15 00:18:00,695,Switch to braid about three years ago. My experience has been a positive one. I pull out of snags that I used to get hung up on. I boat more pike since the line is tougher. I started with Spiderwire and have not had a problem. I do not use flouro so I don't have the retie issues. Then again you could down gauge your flouro and have it break off. I added a line cutter to a retractable clip that holds my other line/jig tools. Hope this helps.
1555889,Pooch,2013-03-15 04:19:00,4619,"I've used both for several years. I like the braid for jigging and have tied directly to the jig and other times used a mono or flouro leader. Great feed back from the bottom and bite using braid. BUT, I get more fish dropping the bait with braid than mono.I've got two rods spooled with braid on one and mono on the other and use them both. I really think I catch more when jigging with the mono.Pooch"
1555929,Golden Eagle,2013-03-15 05:12:00,2642,Same as Pooch. Start the week with about a 5' fluorocarbon leader.
1555937,Davis Viehbeck,2013-03-15 05:12:00,48,"The 'inconvenience' of having to splice some fluoro to your braided or fused line is outweighed by the benefits in my opinion, especially if you're jigging walleye in current or deeper water situations. Bring a spare spool just in case since you can get 'wind knots' in braided lines from time to time. DV"
1556609,MrSimon,2013-03-15 08:18:00,922,"I use braid and love it. I tie directly to the line with no issues. Although, sometimes if you get stuck and you can't get it loose, you have to cut the line and loose maybe 20 or 30 feet. But usually you can go around behind the snag and pop it loose. I have found though, that when trolling with cranks with braid, I have to re-tie a couple times per day or the line gets thin from dragging over rocks and it breaks easily .... I've lost some really big smallmouth because of getting lazy and not retying."
1556673,wallydave,2013-03-15 08:26:00,2151,"I am beginning to make to move to braided lines. Last year I had a new St Croix eyecon to try, at first it was spooled up with Northlands cama walleye mono, I just didn't get the feel I was hopping for! I switched to a Spiderwide braid, what a difference!! I could feel the jigs, sliding down the sides of the rocks while fishing in moving water! Plas, you get less break-offs whan a pike clamps on!! I will use up my remaining mono, I plan to have two spooled with braid, and one with mono, just to keep finding the best line!"
1556833,MrSimon,2013-03-15 08:48:00,922,That's a good point .... all braids are NOT the same. It takes some trial and error to find what works best for you. I've found that the fancy expensive braids are not always better than the cheap ones.
1557809,Lovetofish,2013-03-15 12:45:00,458,"8# Fireline for me. I use flame green and tie it direct to the jig or swivel for a spinner. The color is so much easier to see in the stained water and I don't feel it effects the fish at all. Also carry with a 6"" piece of wood so if I get a snag I can't work lose or break off I wrap the line several times around the dowel and I can break it easily. One other note is I fish in July and September when the walleye tend to be deeper. Very common to fish in 15-25' water in the summer and even deeper in the fall. If I was fishing shallow pitching jigs I'd probably use mono."
