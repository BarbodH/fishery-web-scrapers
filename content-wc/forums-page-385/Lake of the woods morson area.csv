1684985,1shooter,2013-04-17 17:39:00,1493,"X2 on Obabikon. It is an excellent choice. I have been going to this area for years and have stayed at Grassy Narrows, Rex Toltons and Obabikon which is our current home. I see your looking to do your own cooking and Rex Toltons has cabins with kitchens. I have been there several times and the cabins are nice."
1685337,RotorWash,2013-04-17 19:00:00,18,"The area is a great area to fish - we have fished up there for about 5 years every June. Depending on water levels be careful of the rocks. The GPS chips are accurate as far as rock hazards but get a good layout from the resort. There are a few ""wide open bays"" that have some nice hidden treasures like prop and skeg pieces from our fishing group"
1686361,F250,2013-04-18 05:20:00,75,"I have experience with Obabikon, Mylie's Place and Miles Bay. All three are great places to stay, and are owned by folks who you really want to return to and visit."
1671921,ftfarms,2013-04-14 13:01:00,444,My wife and I are thinking of trying lotws around the morson area. Just asking for some in put on this area. I have my own boat with gps and have fished big lakes like lac suel several times so were used to that part thank for any help.
1672745,Redlabel,2013-04-14 18:01:00,279,"ftfarms Not trying to hijack your post, very interested in the info you will get my wife and I want to plan a trip in the same area in September. When do you plan on being there? Again I don't mean to hijack."
1672929,Ia Walihntr,2013-04-14 18:35:00,320,"Sabaskong Bay area at Morson has some great fishing for Walleye, Smallmouth, Northern, Musky, and Largemouth. Also good Crappie and Perch. Sabaskong Bay is shallower with more stained water than most other Canadian waters on LOTW. What are you looking for in regards to accommodations? Do you want ""drive to"", or Boat to? Are you looking for American plan or Housekeeping? If you can narrow it down, I can tell you which resorts can give you what you want and also give you their web addresses."
1673105,1750 FH,2013-04-14 19:03:00,297,"Wife and i have stayed at Mylies Place(last 2 yrs) just north of Morson on Sabaskong bay, nice protected area you can get on and fish in most any weather. Justin and his mom Ellen are excellent hosts they have everything there,bait,gas,groceries,power on the docks.Nice accomidations and reasonably priced.They have a nice web site.You can drive right to it from the border at Baudette in about an hour,its about 45 miles."
1673585,HuskerFrank,2013-04-14 21:32:00,24,"We stayed at Mylie's twice back in the late 90s, also in September. I can vouch for the hospitality. Location is great with access to lots of really great fishing areas. Got into some really nice crappie fishing on our second visit there. Had to travel quite a ways by boat, but it was worth it."
1673969,bob888,2013-04-15 06:09:00,244,Been staying a week or two annually at Mylie's Place for many years. Recommend it highly. Cabins are up-to date. Heat and A.C. Excellent updated mattresses. Ellen and Justin are outstanding. Good fishing in Sabaskong bay and Miles Bay and Obabakon bay are not that far away. If you want the American Plan there are resorts in Obabakon and Miles Bay
1674289,Shorelunch,2013-04-15 08:01:00,554,"I'd look at Mylies, Buena Vista and for sure, Obabikon Bay resort. All three had stood the test of time in the area and will put you on fish. Mylie's and BV are on shore and Obabikon is about a 15 min boat ride, but is in a great location."
1678001,ftfarms,2013-04-16 06:16:00,444,Thanks everyone for your input. I called mylies and buena vista and book a week at buena vista cause mylies was full the week we needed. We are going the week of the 4th of July and may go again last part of September
1678521,Obabikon,2013-04-16 08:15:00,2370,"If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me a PM or email. I hope you have a great time! If you're out by us, feel free to stop in for a cup of coffee."
1683785,ftfarms,2013-04-17 12:51:00,444,Thanks Jared if I can find your place I sure will stop by. your resort is at the top of my bucket list when we decide to do the American plan I would love to stay at your place.
