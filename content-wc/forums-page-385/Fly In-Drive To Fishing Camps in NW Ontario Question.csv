1662977,stillangling,2013-04-11 20:15:00,149,"Gents, I can offer only what I have experienced over the last 25 years of living (and fishing lots) in NW Ontario. I have had the very good fortune of fishing some awesome lakes during that time. I would rate the drive to fishing in the Ignace area as some of the VERY best that I have ever experienced but that is numbers only. Anything on the English River system is going to be very tough to beat...even if you spend tons of money on a flight. Productivity is something that you need to consider and that is what you can expect on the English River between Ignace and the MB border. It is one big clay basin that pumps out fish. Lac Seul is on the English River system but it is simply in another category...big fish and good numbers. Sure you can fly into a lake that is an hour north of Red Lake and catch loads of 16"" walleye every day but in terms of quality fish, forget it. I would never even consider paying for a fly-in trip if my primary concerns was fishing quality. I live here and have the ability do to fly-ins and I do (occasionally). I do not do it because I am looking for better fishing. It is for the chance to get away. I had an experience when I first moved to NW Ontario when I was a young man on a budget on a trip north of Ignace. Heathwalt Lake - drive to connected to the English River sytem. My fishing partner suggested that we buy 10 doz minnows for the day. I gulped and paid my share. We were heading back to town by noon to buy more minnows!"
1663633,MrSimon,2013-04-12 06:50:00,922,"I think its also important to be honest with yourself on how good of a fisherman you are. Don't forget, the guys above who have been fishing Lac Seul and LotW for 20 and 30 years are DARN GOOD FISHERMEN and have been learning the lakes and honing their techniques for decades. Its no surprise that they consistently do well on the drive-in lakes. Drop a first-timer on either of those two lakes and they might get frustrated, overwhelmed, and not catch hardly anything. Small to medium sized fly-in lakes tend to be more forgiving on the beginner to moderate level fishermen. On some of those lakes you can literally drift around with a jig all day and easily catch lots of fish and even some big ones. There are so many variables when it comes to planning a trip that there really isn't a right or wrong answer. The only thing you can really do wrong is to not do your homework .... if you don't do some serious research and thinking, you can easily end up with a trip that doesn't match your group - and that can be bad."
1664169,SinOrSwim,2013-04-12 08:32:00,1528,"I think Mr Simon nailed it in his earlier post and this one. The first post about pressure etc and this one about experience, I could not agree more. We have taken guys with us that had not really ever fished in their lives on our fly-ins. Literally bought all new stuff to go with. They had very good success. If you can show someone how to tie a jig with a minnow or backtroll with a lindy rig or similar, a newbie can catch some very nice walleye on a fly-in. I dont' think the same is true for many of the drive in lakes."
1664473,zeebee,2013-04-12 09:41:00,1144,"All this is so very very true. But that being said, there are fly-ins that drive to's cant match for size and quantity. Gotta find them and spend the bucks. Bottom line tho...u still gotta know how to catch them. My last two trips Ive caught the largest laker and NP taken out of a lodge in the last 5 years or so.There are hundreds of guests a year...what are the odds???. Has taken me 40 years of fishing to get there and Im still learning every time I get into a boat. If I were asked what it takes to catch size/quantity...I would answer .....$, knowledge and of course the given...passion."
1664793,v-bay gord,2013-04-12 10:57:00,3168,"""Size"" and ""quantity"" are only two ingredients that go into what makes up the definition of ""quality"". What defines quality is as varied as the people who go fishing. Catching a 55 inch musky in 35 years of fishing effort may define it for one person.......catching a pile of 16 inch walleyes in the first 55 minutes of a fly-in may define it for another. As long as you're having fun and enjoying the experience, that is what really matters."
1665833,wallydave,2013-04-12 14:44:00,2151,"Our group tried a fly in one year our drive in camp didn't have a cabin open. The fishing was terrible, true it was a lake trout muskie lake not a walleye lake, but we still had fun and made many memories that week. Great fishing is always a good thing, making memories is just as good!"
1666353,joeflip,2013-04-12 17:19:00,75,"There is nothing like exploring new waters, or in my case I decided to go back to fishing the big lakes and rivers and give the fly-in trips a rest. Sometimes its good to run into a group of guys out on the lake or back at the lodge and exchange tactics or start new friendships. Joe"
1645233,Sportdog,2013-04-07 11:07:00,6735,"For those of you that have done ""Fly-In"" and ""Drive To"" NW Ontario fishing resorts, I have a question. How much greater fishing success have you found in your Fly-In compared to your Drive To trips? I know that maybe it isn't a fair question with many variables but I'm just looking for some impressions. Thanks. 66 Days until I head north across the border!"
1645905,@Lunker,2013-04-07 15:51:00,835,"Frankly, I didn't notice any difference in the quality of fishing between a fly-in and the drive-in I've been doing for 25 years - Lake of the Woods. That body of water is widely accepted as one of the premier fisheries in North America. What the fly-in gave me was the rush of knowing the 4 of us were the ~ONLY~ people on the entire lake, and the only signs of life we saw during the week were an occasional float plane flying by in the distance."
1646033,SinOrSwim,2013-04-07 16:35:00,1528,"We have been going to Lac Seul for the last couple years after doing fly-ins for about 16 or 17. Definite difference. Maybe not in size from the stand point that big ones are available in both but numbers and SIZE of the numbers is a marked difference. Also, slow days on the fly-in are drastically different than the slow days on Lac Seul. Granted, we ahve only been on that huge lake for 2 years so are still learning but our fly-in lake was flat out simple to catch a ton of fish in the 22 to 26 inch range. With the 27's and 28's thrown in. largest 31"
1646545,stillangling,2013-04-07 19:05:00,149,"Are you fishing the western part of Lac Seul out of Ear Falls? If so that might explain your observations. My first experiences on the lake were in the western portion. Not very impressive. Once I had a chance to fish the central portions of the lake, I came to a very different conclusion. The fishing in the Williams Bay area is the best combination of size and numbers that I have ever experienced. Yes I have put more fish in the boat in other remote locations but I have not experienced quality like that in any other lake."
1646865,SinOrSwim,2013-04-07 20:19:00,1528,"Yes, we are on the western side."
1655697,MrSimon,2013-04-10 06:59:00,922,"As we all know, fishing CAN be great or horrible anywhere you go. And, not all fly-in lakes are created equal .... but for this thread, lets assume you have done your homework and are only focused on good quality fly-in lakes. With all that said, I do think that as a general rule, fly-in lakes will provide a better fishing experience. Definitely in number of fish and often in size. Also the solitude and ""off the grid"" aspect of a fly-in lake is simply amazing. In my opinion, two things make the fly-in fishing better: 1. Less pressure. A LOT less pressure. The fish are WAY less picky and are not conditioned from seeing lots of lures. They also seem to be less boat shy and more aggressive. You also don't typically get meat hunters at fly-in lakes and most anglers who do fly-ins believe in C&R, especially of big fish. 2. Fly-in lakes are often relatively small. Yes, you can fly into gigantic lakes, but most fly-in outposts that offer complete solitude and privacy are on small to medium sized lakes. Its a whole lot easier to locate and pattern fish on a small body of water than on a huge lake - especially if its your first time there and you only have a week to figure it out. It can literally take years to figure out a big lake to where you can consistently find good fishing. But, fly-ins can be pricey, you can't take your own boat, and there are a lot of logistical issues to sort through. I've found the best of both worlds by going to drive-in camps on large lakes that offer outpost cabins and have access to remote bush lakes. Its my belief that if you can find such a place, you'll never get on a float plane again."
1658369,zeebee,2013-04-10 16:54:00,1144,"I have spent over 40 years fishing N Ont both drive to and fly-ins so I feel somewhat qualified to reply to your query. It would be much easier to compare two specific bodies of water however, I can make some qualified generalities. There are some very good drive in lakes including but not limited to the two suggested by previous posters...Lac Seul and LOW. However, there are also several outstanding fly-ins that those two cant hold a candle to. Many of these lie in the far north and are expensive but there are also some outstanding fly-ins in the ""near north"" accesible from bases spread from Thunder Bay to Kenora. You have to do your research but if you do you can find lakes that drive to's simply cant match. Every year I opt for at least a week on a fly-in lake that has provided several of my PB's despite receiving less than 10% of my overall fishing time. I have fished well over 40 drive to lakes in N Ont and caught some great fish but, on the whole they dont compare to a top tier fly-in lake."
1658649,Jigger1,2013-04-10 18:00:00,234,"So zeebee & SinOrSwim what bodies of water are you referring to? I have not done a fly-in yet, may some day, but as stillangling pointed out, the central basin of LacSeul is the bomb and it's where I've fished the last 13 years. I've watched shows and researched several lakes and resorts, but based on the outstanding fishing and overall exceptional experience year after year, I just can't see leaving where I currently fish."
1658793,5richards,2013-04-10 18:40:00,131,Simplistically I guess it all depends on what you consider to be good fishing and remote experience versus cost -- there are some great flyins that are less expensive than drive ins!
1658993,zeebee,2013-04-10 19:45:00,1144,"Yup...lots to be said for familiarity, experience and confidence. Seul is a great fishery no question."
