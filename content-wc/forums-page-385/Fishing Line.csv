Last year I tried a Northlands Bionic walleye camo braid, great feel and prevents pike breaking your line. The nice thing is it has a white section every 3-5 ft, to help find your depth, plus the white section is easy to see fishing stained waters!"
1689377,reconssd,2013-04-18 17:24:00,147,Thanks to everyone sharing their experiences. I greatly appreciate it.
1652401,reconssd,2013-04-09 10:15:00,147,"I normally fish Spectra Power Pro 20 or 25 lb test/green. I am considering changing this year to another line, or at least spool one reel with something else. I fished spider line years ago and didn't really care for it. What lines have you field tested and what do you like? I primarily fish for northern pike and an occasional walleye that is aggressive enough to hit a pike bait. Thanks for sharing. Tight lines, sharp hooks, and safe travels this season."

1652777,5richards,2013-04-09 11:28:00,131,I fish with power pro -- from 35 to 50 lb for pike -- I try not to wear them out with a long fight -- to this I tie 18 inch Fluorocarbon leaders with crimped sleeves holding the barrel swivel on one end and the snap lock on the other --60 to 80 lb for the leader. Going to fire line this year for Walleye -- 10 lb Check out Cabela's reviews for the new slick Power Pro -- 4 stars but three guys really had bad experiences with it.
1655233,adempsey,2013-04-09 22:41:00,963,"Most of my reels are spooled with PowerPro. When I change them out next I figured I'd test a couple of lines, based on positive reviews, I haven't used before - Daiwa Samurai Braid, Tuf-Line XP Braid and Sunline SX1 Braid."
1655305,Hawker,2013-04-10 04:31:00,3967,"On my baitcasters I only use Spiderwire Stealth in 50 or 65#. Never had any problems or difficulties with it. Casts great, super quiet going thru the guides. Spinning gear is always loaded with Fireline smoke in 8 or10#."
1655521,octanehi5,2013-04-10 05:57:00,1104,"I switched to suffex 832 about two yrs ago. and never looked back. 6lb for walleye, 20lb for pike end of story."
1658825,Guest,2013-04-10 18:55:00,0,"I used the newest power pro last summer, super slick and smooth. It felt a lot better the the suffix 832"
1669689,emma17,2013-04-13 19:17:00,436,Are you tying the 6 lb to a swivel/leader or directly to jig?
1669945,Jigger1,2013-04-13 20:30:00,234,"After switching to braid last year, loving it but having difficulty seeing it, I'm going with Power Pro Super 8 Slick with Seaguar InvizX as my leader. Can't wait to give this combo a try."
1672401,Tinyfish,2013-04-14 16:06:00,16,That's the set up I use. I just change the weight of the seaguar leader. I use 40lb for pike and 8-12lb for walleye. Worked great last year.
