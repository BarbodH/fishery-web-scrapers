1597378,5richards,2013-03-25 14:47:00,131,Can't blame Mike -- he lost the dang fish!!!!
1597522,Lovetofish,2013-03-25 15:13:00,458,My friend's boat caught fire one trip between Orr and International Falls. By the time we noticed all we could do was pull over and get the heck away from it. Melted the glass boat right to the trailer. I'm sure you could see the black smoke for miles. The Orr fire dept sent a pumper truck that put out the fire. After the fire was put out we could hear the gas boiling in the main tank. Probably lucky we filled the tank in Virginia. Lost everything we had for gear in the fire. Damaged the tow vehicle but we could still use it. 4 hours later we stopped at a sports shop in International Falls and bought what we needed to fish with and continued the trip by renting a boat from the camp we stayed at by Kenora. What we lost was all replaceable. We were darn lucky we didn't start a forest fire. I think my friend had a bad portable gas tank he was hauling for a tiller boat ahead of us. A good reason to not haul portable gas cans in an enclosed boat.
1597722,joeflip,2013-03-25 15:43:00,75,"Nothing like getting to the border and one of the new guys in the group ask what is considered a felony in Canada and what do I need a Pass Port for, its only Canada...I am always concerned of the first timers to Canadian fishing in the Great North..."
1598106,2746,2013-03-25 16:57:00,3206,"Three that stick out in my mind. Th first, nearly 40 years ago on Nunguesser. Coming back to camp in a rain storm we passed a small rental boat with a Dad and two sons in it. No rain gear and the boys were shaking uncontrollably. Stopped and they said they were lost getting back to their camp. We guided them to a cabin we knew of. jimmied the window to get in and started a fire in the fireplace. Warmed to boys up and gave them directions to their cabin. We watched them leave and darned if they didn't make another wrong turn.....we ended up guiding them home. A factory worker from Chicago who had never been north but wanted his boys to experience it.Second was On Eagle 20 years ago when one of the guys with a new hip threw it out while on a portage. Major pain! We radioed camp who made arrangements for an ambulance to meet us and we motored him in laying in the bottom of a 25 horse tiller. Hospital in Dryden could not fix the hip and we pooled all our credit card resources to pay the bill at the emergency room and charter a plane to Minneapolis. That guy was tough!Third was on another trip home from Eagle coming down 502. One of our party either drifted across the center line or the approaching boat cut his corner but the wheels of their trailers met head on. Both boats went straight in the air and ended up with broken axles as well as other significant damage. The owner and his brother stayed behind in Dryden until trailer was fixed and he could haul his wrecked boat home. I'll never forget the sight of those two boats in my rear view mirror.I guess when one has made 50 plus trips stuff is going to happen.....makes for good stories while sitting on the deck with a drink and good cigar."
1598810,fourize,2013-03-25 19:09:00,287,"My Dad and I were headed back to the lodge one late afternoon from a 2 portage trip. While weaving our way up a small stream that connected 2 lakes, the motor died. Pulled until my arm was ready to fall off. Lodge owners son comes buzzing over in his little plane. We learned a valuable lesson that day...if you are in trouble wave a boat cushion or life vest...not your arms. Needless to say, we spent a night in the ""bush"". It was chilly that night but had a lighter in the back pack. Made a fire. Tried to sleep, but slept for maybe an hour. At daybreak, we found a couple flat pieces of wood, and used them for paddles to make it across the lake in 3 hours...with no wind thank God...to the next portage to the lodge. We ate breakfast and hit the sack. Didn't fish much that day."
1598962,downriverbob,2013-03-25 19:29:00,880,"Here is my list of so called emergencies while vacationing in Lake of the Woods: Both my wife and I have had hooks in us her in her head me in the meaty part of my right hand. The owners sister is a retired ""bush"" nurse and has great surgical skills. I got bad gas in International Falls, my main motor was so carboned up that it would not run. I got into a repair shop onshore and was back in action in a couple of days. On a cold day a few years back a rod fell out of my hands and I proceeded to dive over the side to catch before it went to the bottom(not this time Bob !) I have forgotton my foot pedal for electric motor, was able to borrow one. One year we had a flat tire and had only one spare tire, had to buy another tire and rim(very expensive). Carry two spares for now on. Most of them were pretty trivial and I smile when I think about now. BOB"
1599490,Lambertson Rock Guy,2013-03-25 21:38:00,20,Motor trouble...electric start wouldn't work on an older 70 horse Evinrude. Far end of McKenzie Bay on Lac Seul. Windy day with no other boats anywhere near us. No manual starter rope in the boat. Kept fiddling with it and it finally engaged and started. Decided to head back to camp which was about 25 miles. Tough to leave as the fishing was fantastic. Get back and someone at the camp looks at it. Just greases a small part and it worked fine for the rest of the trip and for years after that.Different trip in a smaller boat. Sawmill Bay on Lac Seul. Quite a ways into the bay..nobody past us. Weather gets bad and we decide to head back to camp. Come around a corner and a lady is waving her arms with two other men in their boat. Motor trouble in a newer camp boat. Towing them isn't an option as we had some rough water to cross once out of the bay. They wanted us to take one of them to their camp which was near ours. We explain to them that another person in our small boat in the rough water out of the bay would be unsafe. We assured them that our camp owner will call their camp owner and they will be there soon. We had to tell them several times that we won't leave them hanging.Other end of Lac Seul near Deception Bay. Four boats in our group this time. Fishing in the morning for a while...one boat in our group looks a little lower in the water compared to the day before. After the usual jokes about eating/drinking too much the night before they figure out their plug is out. Bigger boat with lots of room between bottom of boat and floor so they didn't notice it. They decided to drive around on plane for a while instead of going back to Deception Bay Landing.
1601745,oldblue2008,2013-03-26 12:58:00,313,"In 1999 or 2000 we were fishing in NE Saskatchewan about May 20th, so the water was cold. We were slowly fishing our way back to camp and were in a bay north of the Narrows. A yellow Beaver flew over and wagged his wings and then left. We figured it was maybe the DNR having a look. About 45 minutes later we packed up and headed thru the narrows on the way back to camp. Both boats had just got up on plane when the Beaver landed right in front of us, like in just clearing our boats. We figured we were in for a big time check by the DNR boys. The pilot got out on the float and said he had been flying over the area when he spotted an empty boat doing donuts in the middle of the lake. He had flapped his wings at us earlier hoping we would follow. He pointed over to the shore about 250 yards away and there sat the boat. I took our boat over to the shore, and looked. Boat was still in gear idling, 1 tackle box, 1 rod, 1 life jacket. So, we are looking for 1 person. The motors had numbers on top of them, (26) and the pilot had radioed back and advised possible drowning etc, and the camp knew it was one of their employees. I jumped in the empty boat, and turned back towards the plane, while one of my fishing partners drove our boat. I looked back at the plane and our other boat, and now there were 3 people in the boat instead of just our two companions. We got back to see this very cold young 20 year old sitting in the boat. Ed, had spotted this guy's cheek, just above the 1 foot chop, about 50 feet behind their boat. IT was amazing that we didn't run over him with our boats, or that the plane didn't land on him. The pilot radioed back to mainland and told them the good news. We had a full set of clothes with us, but the guy didn't want to put them on. We transferred him back to his boat, and got him to at least put on a Floater jacket for warmth. I drove his boat back to camp, about 12 miles away. he said he had bent down to pick something up and let go of the tiller handle. The boat hooked and threw him out. All he had on was sandals, blue jeans and a dark t-shirt. He had been in the water 55 minutes. I think he was hoping he could get back to the dock and just say he fell in, but the word was out already. Got him back to the dock, where there was a fair crowd gathered. He headed up for a hot shower. He was a very lucky young fellow. If the pilot hadn't been flying over, or Ed hadn't seen his face in the water, it would have been a different story. The guy said he had just about given up, didn't have the energy left to yell at us, and with the wind, he was about 200 yards from a shore. I think we were also the last boat of the day to come thru the narrows. About 3 years later, we were told that he had been killed in a shark attack in Australia!"
1601825,oldblue2008,2013-03-26 13:27:00,313,"It was July of 1977, and I was out skiing one evening with a friend and his fiance'. We were about a 1/4 mile away from the boat launch. I had just dropped in the water, and the boat picked me up. Across, in front of the boat launch there was a speed boat doing high powered donuts . We said to each other, ""he is going to swamp that thing"". About 10 seconds later we heard it sputter, as a wave went over the back end. The boat had a 460 cubic inch inboard, and the carbs didn't like the gulp of water! We went flying over there, just in time. There were 3 guys in the water, just about 3 feet of nose sticking in the air, with air bubbling out the seams. Also the odd beer bottle floating. My very expensive $6 ski rope was still trailing us, so Doug, our boat owner, quickly undid it from the ski hook and slipped it thru the eye of the boat going down. We got the guys into our boat, and found the ski rope handle still floating. There was maybe 5 feet left, so the boat was in about 60-65 feet of water, 150 feet from shore. Now what do we do? Doug had a cb radio in his boat, so we radioed back to town, about 7 miles away and got someone to phone the RCMP. While we waited for the RCMP to arrive, we discussed the options. If we tried to pull the boat with the ski rope and it broke, we were talking salvage. Even back then, that was a pretty expensive boat. Salvage would not be cheap either. When the police arrived, more conflab. It was finally decided to try and pull on the ski rope and see what happened. Doug's boat was an inboard, about 170 hp. so we tried it. The rope held and the boat moved. We figured it must have settled right way up, to be able to move it. We kept slowly pulling, hoping it wouldn't catch on a tree or some other material on the bottom. We got it close enough to shore that we had to quit pulling. I don't remember why, or what the swimmers had for a vehicle, but I hooked on to their trailer with my truck, and backed it down to the water, pulled the boat up closer so we could get it on their trailer. We winched it up on the trailer, and heard this whirring sound. The bilge pump was still running. Long story short, everyone was ok. Owner had to go to court, as he got charged with dangerous navigation. He was going to plead not guilty. His lawyer phoned me a couple of nights before the court date, and asked my story. I told him, and he said ""well, that pretty much matches the story that two city police told"". They were fishing off the bank across the resovoir. So, he changed his plea to guilty. I did see the boat again, a couple of years later, in a city about 2 hour from here."
1602769,packpro,2013-03-26 17:28:00,695,"All minor emergencies.....some stupidity aka learning situations.Underwater boulder surrounded by 25-35 fow. Ripped a hole in a Yammi 25HP lower unit big enough to stick your fist through. Guy fished all day- Repair cost $440.00. There was a floating Clorox bottle on it the next day.Gas siphonong incident on 502. We found out that you can consume gas, but it is the fumes that kill you. Do not induce vomiting. Thank you Canaadian Poison Control.The next three all occurred at the same exit on I-94. We call it the black hole. First, Blown out tire on an RV at 1AM in the morning-(return trip). It was the inner tire on a dually. It was rusted on. Repair completed around 4AM at the truck stop.Next year, different RV. Blown water pump two hours into the trip. Its Friday. the truck stop says no chance for repair until Monday. A freeway gypsie mechanic pulls in, we locate the water pump at a nearby NAPA. 2 cans of penetrating oil and 6 hours later that little guy and his step stool had us on our way.Next year same stop- return trip home around midnight. Stop to fill up with gas. Everyone is rushing back and forth to the bathroom and when the fill up is completed we move the RV to free up the pump. Driver returns and we are on our way. Except......... everyone thought someone else paid for the gas. We called the following Monday as they were looking at the tape and swearing out the arrest warrant for the title holder. gave them a credit card, no worries.Code Brown One- Had a fella emerge from the bush with the lower left quadraunt of his T-shirt missing. Knife in one hand, and smile on his faceCode Brown Two- Big guy can figure out the mechanics of the monkey drop. Takes two oars and straddles them across a couple of rocks. We pull around the corner so he can have some privacy.....next thing we hear...CRAAAAAAAAACK, and a groan. Not what you think, he landed on his feet but we have a good laugh imagining what could have happened.Fella slips coming off the float plane ends up with a foot knee deep in the water. Worse he is straddling the steps and came down hard. Nice little falcetto scream.20 miles outside of Fort Francis on 502 the road sharply curves to the left. It has been recently repaired and the white line marking the road edge is gone. The Railroad track intersects the road at that exact point. Our lead truck pulling the trailer with all of gear hits the rails full speed. Trailer flies into air at least two feet. It comes down just in time to hit the second rail. The driver cuts hard left and starts down the berm on the other side of both rails. takes about a tenth of mile but he gets it to stop. 6"" to the right and truck and trailer roll off of a steep incline. The passenger gets out, jumps in and backs the rig down to the intersection with only inches to spare on the right side. To this day we all turn our right turn signals on when we get to that spot."
1603321,Obabikon,2013-03-26 19:42:00,2370,"You take mono line, and put it BEHIND the hook... pull down very hard, opening the wound just a little on the back side of the curve. Then take a pair of needle nose pliers and flip the hook out... the point actually comes out first this way. It's very fast, but unbelievable how little it hurts."
1603545,Pikeslayer8,2013-03-26 20:30:00,1460,"My dad and his business associate Ralph (more on Ralph later) had a tent camp on Wapikimanski 40 some years ago. I think it was either the 1st or 2nd trip we ever used it when we arrive to discover that the camp was raided by a bear. Pretty much destroyed the camp. The bear crushed the fridge and threw it through the wall. We made do and had a great trip. The next year at the same camp, we discovered that our outboard motors had been pilfered by the local Indians and they beat the crap outta them. Thankfully, they returned them where they found them (in the cabin, under the bunks). We made do and had a great trip. That same year, our last on Wapikimanski, Ralph and his son John, who were very adventurous fishermen wanted to fish on the other side of Harmon Falls. Boats and motors and gear were dragged up and around the falls which were very impressive to say the least. Ralph and John were just pulling out from shore when, you guessed it, Ralph hits a rock and conks out his motor and is then drifting rapidly straight for the falls. My brother Bob, was astute enough to dive in and grab the rope. My dad snatched my brother out the water and the 3 of us held on for dear life fighting this incredible current till we could tie the rope around a tree and the boat could angle back towards the bank. We don't really know what would have happened if these fellas would have gone over but we do know it wouldn't be pretty. But, we made do and had a great trip. Fast forward some 20 years and now we fish Wabakimi. There were 2 trips back to back where we had a general practitioner doctor in our group prove to be invaluable. Our camp on Wabakimi is situated not far from where the Allanwater River flows into Wabakimi via Sturgeon Rapids, a world class canoeing route. Most canoeists portage around these rapids (Even Solopaddler did when the lake was on fire, but that's his story)(hope he tells it again on this thread) Some choose to shoot the rapids. This particular afternoon, we had a canoe arrive at our camp with one of the canoeists laying in the bottom of the canoe with a compound fracture in his lower leg. Our doctor had his bag with him and he set the break and applied an air-cast on his leg. The rest of us filled him up with Jack Danials and he was ready to get flown out. The very next year, another pair of canoeists show with an even worst medical condition. The man was unconscious and just barely breathing. We hauled him into the cabin and laid him across the table. The wife says that he was having an allergic reaction and our doctor friend had to perform an emergency tracheotomy on the spot MacGyver style. They were flown out and we made do and had a great trip. Over the years, we have had other issues, my dad got real sick in Ft. Francis and had to go to the hospital the night before we were to fly out, had a deer smack our Surburban heading south through Minnesota, had our trailer hitch break and come loose again in Minnesota and a bunch of other crap that I'm sure I don't even recall, but as always, we made do and had a great trip. Trips that don't have something happen or obstacles to overcome seem to run together but the ones that do are much more memorable. Finally, back to Ralph. Ralph and my dad were the original 2 to begin our wonderful Canadian fishing tradition. On Ralph's last trio, he pulls my dad aside and tells him that his doctor told him that his heart sprung a few leaks and his doctor strongly advised him not to go on this trip, but Ralph would not hear of it. Ralph sat us all down and told us that if he were to die that it is his wish for us to place his body in a cool bay and that he did not want to be flown out till after the trip was over. The rest of us immediately knew what was expected of us and we took extreme great care so that Ralph didn't have to do anything but to reel in the walleye. Thankfully, Ralph made it out okay but he passed on a few weeks after. RIP"

There were some guys in camp from TN & AL fishing smallmouth bass. They were usually out almost all day. One day we bumped into them coming out of the office, I remarked ""you guys are in early"", one of the turned around and took off his hat to show us he had a hook in his head at the base of his skull with some blood trickling down. They were headed to the clinic @ Emo. They wouldn't touch it and sent him to Fort Frances. So rather than head there they decide to cross the bridge back into the USA and the hospital @ International Falls. Well. of course there's a line so the guy gets out of their van and walks across the bridge, guess it caused quite a commotion, but the waved them on after he showed his new ""bling"". Funniest part was my son, says later after seeing a bear cross US 2, the Great Lakes Freighters in Duluth, taking a float plane ride and having a large muskie break his line, ""I can't wait to get home and tell the guys I saw a guy with a hook in his head!"" I told that to the guys from TN & AL and they gave my son a pocket knife to make it even more memorable for him."

1614753,digjig,2013-03-29 11:06:00,146,"We had an incident about five years ago on our return trip from Lac Seul. I was driving, towing my buddys boat heading back on 502. I happened to look in the rear view mirror at the trailer and saw the left wheel of the single axle trailer leaning in at a 15 degree angle. After letting out an explitive, I started to pull over to the the near nonexistant shoulder on 502 that we all know and love. As soon as I made for the shoulder the wheel came off and the trailer layed down throwing sparks galore. The wheel passed us, rolled nearly in the path of an oncoming oil tanker, rolled off the shoulder down into the ditch and hit a granite wall. The tire popped at least 100 feet in the air, well over the population of surveying Popel trees, and landed in the bush. Luckly we had two vehicles in our fishing party and were able to drive to Fort Frances for a flatbed. Needless to say, the vacation was extended another day.

Trucks loaded and boat hooked up, away we go. Made it three hrs to Marquette and the fuel pump goes out. We call a couple places and the soonest we can get it fixed is Wednesday. You could see the disappointment in the boys eyes, their trip was over. There was only one thing to to.....get towed back to town and buy a new truck! What else?

1630394,F250,2013-04-03 04:59:00,75,"At a drop camp in northern Quebec in 1990, we were hunting caribou and fishing for lake trout and brook trout. One of my buddies slipped with his knife while field dressing a caribou. It was the first day of the trip. The float plane was not coming back in for 7 days. There was no radio. The gash across the palm of his hand was wide and deep enough that we could see bone on the back side of the cut. Another one of my firends had just completed med school. He stitched up the hand after loading up the injured guy with plenty of Yukon Jack.Around 1992 we were traveling across Ontario near Dryden, returning from a waterfowl hunt in Saskatchwan, in a motor home. We hit a very large bull moose that took out the windshield and all the windows on the passeneger side.In 2002 we were at a ""boat in"" camp in Quebec. My wife and I had made it in to the camp, battling high winds and 3-4' waves. My 71 year old mother and another woman of the same age were riding in on a pontoon boat with the outfitter and a load of gear. A rope off the pontoon boat got caught up in the prop. The boat submarined into a wave, washing both women off the deck. I had insisted they each wear a PFD before they got on the boat, and had assisted them with the fit. I was able to launch a boat and fish them both out of the water under difficult conditions.While camping at a remote fly-in in Quebec, a young man pulled up to our dock. He was frantic but only spoke French. We only spoke English. We were able to determine his buddy had suffered an insect bite and his airway was swelling shut. We administered a large dose of Benadryl, and the swelling went down."

Both large groups so the outfitter was bringing in the parties in two flights. First group went out and first group came in and of course half of each party has an hour to talk at the campsite about how did you do, where are the fish and stuff like that. While standing on the dock, one of the guys who had just flown in stepped back to let someone go by and the dock board gives way. So with his back turned to the rocky shoreline below, he falls backward onto the rocks. Don't know how but not a broken bone or a bloody mess. The Fishing Gods looked kindly on that guy. Logic would have been that he lays on those rocks either bleeding or in agony for an hour until the plane returned and miss his whole trip. Crazy good luck."
1637170,Paul H,2013-04-04 16:56:00,1232,"Did the Northern (eastern part ) trip for 20+ years with the wife. A few memorable events. One year on the New York Thruway, wife driving, stopped on the side during a blinding rainstorm. We were well past an exit ramp and right against the guard rail. WHAM - a Neon came down the ramp and straight into us. One boat and trailer wiped out. One fishing tip gone. Turns out the teenage driver was from a neighboring Ohio town. 4 brother sin laws make the trip - K car wagon, 2 boats, one trailer, flipped one on top. On the same NY Thruway and almost the same spot, a fender came unbolted, flipped 180 and was riding on the tire. We caught it before it rubbed through. Pulled over, took the other bolts off and go on. Stop in North Bay the next day at Canadian Tire and get some bolts... Same trip - buddies 9.9 would never run right - 3 days of trouble shooting and finally I think - COILS. Local gas station let us use some tools, pulled it apart, found a used motor that had 2 old but working coils and fixed that. Death by black flies - BAD - May 30 or so and 100 degrees with frost at night - every fly hatches at once. You've been there. Killer Robin - neighboring, empty cottage had a robin nest that the sucker must have never seen a human. If you got within 30 feet it would attack. Main motor quits, had kicker and got back to camp. Luckily the last day, turns out blew a head gasket. Loading to return home - no trailer lights - after checking for awhile I just run a wire along the trailer frame and re-wire. Turns out the harness had broken insulation inside the frame and the copper had disintegrated . Had spare wire, tools, solder. torch - be prepared. Worst was not even me. Became friends with a guy. Turns out his dad had had a heart attack and dies before they could get him out of the bush. Went to the same general area. He was in his teens then and we met when we were in our 30's. Area is still a good hour from a hospital and if you are back in the bush, even worse."
1603817,Moondog,2013-03-26 21:54:00,362,"Several years ago on our way thru St. Paul, we turned off one interstate onto another (ramp speed 55) and hit a pot hole. big pot hole. Very big pot hole. The black out shade on our moho fell instantly over the windshield and we were driving blind going 55 mph. code brown. We made the next exit by looking out the drivers side window and were able to pull up the massive shade over our heads and at least see if we were going to hit something. The moho manufacturer, not to be named, was called and they actually sent the owners son (shade manufacturer) to Red Lake to replace the bad motor on the shade. They were really freaked out about it and this guy came all the way from Dallas to get this bad boy faulty motor and replace it. Called it a ""perfect storm."" Could have been but wasn't. Funny part was this guy called and asked us to pick him up from the Red Lake Airport. right. Then wanted to know about rental cars. right. Then all he wanted to do is take the Chinese motor with him, get on a plane....go from Red Lake to Sioux Lookout to Toronto and then Dallas. righht. funny now.......not then."

1604905,Gipper,2013-03-27 08:41:00,76,"My first trip to Canada was to an island lodge on Eagle Lake in 1952 with my dad and uncle. I was 8. There was no comm and the owner picked us up at dock at a prearranged time. No electric and lighting was Colman lanterns. One night a lady from the next cabin asked my dad for help lighting her Coleman. He put in a new bag but had trouble lighting it. He checked fuel and when he started to unscrew the cap, fuel sprayed and was lit by the spark that remains on the bag cord sometimes. Those familiar with those lanterns know what I mean. Dad lit up like a torch and did the smart thing...stop drop roll down the hill. Fire out and they buttered him up then a night lake trip (no boat lights) and overnight in a Dryden hospital. Scared the crap out of me. He fished the rest of the week bandaged up and caught a bunch. Later in life I wondered whether he would have been so eager to help a guy.....hmmmmm?"
1606337,Iowa Farm Boy,2013-03-27 14:16:00,44,"We were fishing the middle of a lake where some boulders just break the surface of the water. The fishing was hot and we were catching fish after fish. All of a sudden my buddy jumped up, with that look on his face, droped his shorts and hung his arse over the side. ""Explosive diahrea"" The sad part of this is he actually shut the fish off. We could not get another bite and had to move on."
1606409,Mr. Sauger,2013-03-27 14:23:00,285,"Bears terrorize fisherman for days  read all about it. A true story.The four of us were at a fly in cabin in Manitoba. We were making the kind of racket you would expect from guys drinking beer and playing poker. Around 11:00 PM we heard something rummaging around on the screened in porch. We banged on the cabin's steel door to heard claws scamper on the wood floor (like a dog on the kitchen floor). 10 minutes later the critter returned. We banged again, it scampered again. The next time we peeked out the cabin windows to see two big brown bears! Dang, these grizzlies are not afraid of humans (actually, they were cinnamon colored black bears). Didn't get much sleep that night. The bears came back for a few more house calls. Our pathetic defensive plan included barricading the door with furniture and making spears out of fillet knives, broomsticks and duct tape. Now we understood why every window screen has 4 parallel slashes in it bear claw marks. At dawn I got a good look at the big one  its head was massive. I could give it my best shot with a Louisville slugger and it would just piss him off. We were scared. Had to wizz in the sink as no one dared go outside as both bears continued to prowl around. The radio telephone in the cabin was for emergencies only. OK this qualifies. Finally got a hold of our outfitter and squealed our situation to him. He said he would try to get here in a day or two. Now what, we can't stay in here for the rest of our trip (day 4 of 7).We decided we would stay together and go fishing all day to minimize foot traffic on land. We gathered our spears and signal flares. Fishing was great. At dusk, we thought we better retake the cabin. Before we sounded like Laura Petrie, now we sounded more like Cage, Kirby and Little John. If we stay in the diamond formation, we can fight them off. We made it to the porch, but hesitated to enter as a bear could be cornered inside. We're smarter than the average bear so we tossed a few sticks in to flush him out. Bad move. GROOOWL, he was in the bushes 50 feet behind us. The diamond formation didn't work as every man for himself ran for the boats. We wondered what to do next as the mosquitos feasted on us in the middle of the lake. We made it into the cabin on our second attempt. Another night of sleeping with one eye open. We decided not to make Molotov cocktails.Glory be, I hear a float plane! Our outfitter arrived with Don (his hired hand) and a 444 lever action Winchester. Don tracked the bears for 45 minutes. He reported, Yeah, they're back. Then the Outfitter told us to be careful and started towards the float plane. Wait a minute, where ya goin with that rifle? Outfitter answered with a question, What would you do if you saw the bear?. Our first answer was the right one, we'll blow his F***ing head off. With that, the outfitter handed us the rifle and said good answer. Everything changed. We could come and go as we pleased. Only difference was you now had an armed escort to the outhouse. We saw the bears off and on for the next few days but never had a clean shot. Even tried baiting them with bbq pork on a beer can pyramid alarm. They stole our bait despite the treble hooks. Saturday morning brought the float plane without a shot being fired. As we were shuttling our gear from the cabin to the plane we heard a commotion from the side of the cabin. The smaller bear (still 200 lbs.+) was tearing into a bag of empty beer cans. Don grabbed the bush rifle. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, it's not loaded. I held out a handful of shells. He took only one. Perplexed, I asked Is that all you want. He looked at me and said, There is only one bear. Whatthe? Don started to take aim and shuffled his foot on the ground. The bear looked up and caught the bullet right in the middle of his forehead. Brains came out like a calk gun. FYI  There was no food stored at any time in the porch. This was the first year a cabin has been on that lake."
1600129,HeHooksHimself,2013-03-26 07:41:00,725,"I told this story on another thread, but it seems to fit here. I had a rough Wednesday a few years ago. My son and I decided to seek adventure and chose a portage trip that involved a steep uphill climb on a pretty choked up moose trail to a lake with a jon boat and paddles. The lake was appropriately named Tipover Lake because for years it had only a canoe on it and tipping over was routine. The solution to tipping over was supposed to be the jon boat, but I of course managed to tip it over by leaning back on what i thought would be the side rail but was only air. As i fell backwards into the water the boat went sideways and launched my adult son into the drink as well. This was opening week so the water was quite cold, in the 50s. My agile son was able to scramble back into the boat and we gathered up as much of our floating gear as possible. Now I was having trouble getting my ample azz and soggy boats and clothes back into the boat and was in the water for a good 20 min. while we strategized a solution. Finally he was able to get me back into the boat with a Herculean pull and we dried in the sun as best we could while we caught a stringer full of walleyes and talked about how that swim could have turned out very badly. Finally we hiked back down to the regular boat, went back to camp and cleaned up and dried off. We later set out to one of our favorite spots that includes a set of water falls. One of the features of this set of falls is mud like none other I have ever seen. It builds up on your boots several inches and is as slippery as snot on a marble. My son caught a nice smallie and I decided to measure it on the ruler back at the boat. While doing so, I slipped on the rocks and crashed down on my old and fat self. At the time I didn't realize that I had cracked two ribs. i did realize that it hurt like hail. I had trouble sleeping the rest of the week.The next day, in pain, i was assigned to fish with my BIL. Of course it rained and was cold all day, but I hung in there. On the way to a lake called Turnaround Lake I snuggled in my hoodie seeking warmth and comfort and when I emerged from my cacoon I had no idea where i was, even though i was very familiar with that lake.Since that trip, we have all joked, commented and told the story of when Hooks tipped over in Tipover, fell at the Falls and got turned around in Turnaround. By the way, i went to the doctor about a week after we got back and found out that I had cracked two ribs. I didn't sleep well for six months."
1594202,Flip Silverlake,2013-03-24 19:34:00,645,"I've fished the same area on Lake of The Woods since 1962. Aside the usual getting caught out in some really bad weather, mainly wind, I only have had two things that would have been called an emergency. One was hitting the water on the first Sunday of a two week trip in 1996 with my wife and son, we were running ahead of a fairly nasty thunderstorm when I lost a powerhead on a 19 year outboard and had to motor in on a 5.5 kicker in a storm that the rain was so bad you couldn't see the shoreline until you were right on top of it I ended up buying a new motor from Nelson's Marine in Kenora and finished the trip. Got a good deal on that motor with the exchange rate and getting the PST and GST tax back. The second was eating breakfast two years ago and chewing some very crispy bacon that I had cooked and broke a tooth. I hung in with the broken tooth for the remaining 2 weeks and had it fixed when we got home. Now that we have a summer home on Pine Portage bay I'm sure there will be plenty of more horror stories in the years to come. One more thing last year we were coming in late in during the long weekend in August and miissed a pair of guys in kayaks. Missed them by less than 10 feet. It was dark and they had NO lights at all. Lucky my wife spotted them before I would have hit them. I'm sure due to the speed I was running they would have put me in jail for a long time. I stopped and told them they should have some kind of lights if they were going to play out in the normal traffic channel. They must have been shook up becasue nither one would say anything. I guess looking at the bow of that Lund coming right at them would have been kinda scary.."
1594658,Pat,2013-03-24 21:40:00,203,"It was the mid-70's and the wife and I almost burnt down a cabin. It was an early June trip and the night was cold and the cabin was wood stove heated. So, stoked up the stove and went to bed. Unfortunately the stove flue was pretty hot and there was a squirrel nest in the attic next to the flue. You guessed it, the nest caught fire and eventually the roof was on fire. We woke up smelling smoke, I went out on the porch and and looked on the roof to see about a 2' square area on fire. Mu wife started filling and handing me dish pans of water and I climbed up on hr porch railing and threw them on the fire. Kind of kept the fire at bay until the camp owner arrived with a garden hose strung over to the cabin and we finally got it out. The next day we went finishing and the camp owner cleaned up the camp, put a huge tarp over the roof and we finished our two week trip! Been going to this camp for almost 50 years, this one was by far the biggest ""emergency""."
1596154,Shorelunch,2013-03-25 09:56:00,554,"Obabikon, what technique do you use?"
1596298,scgibby11,2013-03-25 10:35:00,109,I suspect he was referring to this method:
1596546,rockape,2013-03-25 11:26:00,215,"Driving 1000 miles each way, and being out in the middle of nowhere always presents challenges! We have hit deer, had lug nuts break on the trailer, hooks imbedded, torn quadraceps from missing a step, bear visits, wrecked props, blown motors, strippers throwing beer bottles at us, HUGE waves from big storms, broken water pumps (5 days without a shower!), and the list goes on. We always roll with the punches. Just be prepared with having backup gear, know people in the area, and know where to go to if you need serious help. Tough on a fly-in, so go with the satellite phone for that. As far as ""brown"" emergencies, here are 3 tips. 1. Have plenty of toilet paper in the truck and boat. 2. Bring a lot of Immodium AD! 3. Don't eat McDonalds under any circumstances!"
1596618,MrSimon,2013-03-25 11:35:00,922,We were driving an old RV back through Ohio after fishing up North and the front end felt pretty wobbly. We pulled over on the side of the highway to find that all but two of the lug studs on the front passenger tire had sheered off.We got towed to a garage and waited around for a couple hours while they fixed it. Loosing that wheel while going 65 mph down the highway towing a boat would have been really really bad.
1596658,Mike Kansas,2013-03-25 11:44:00,1463,Had a guy break his leg when he fell out of the boat trying to use the landing net to get a 10 lb Walleye I had on. Broke his leg and lost my fish. We were at an outpost miles from anything. Made him lay on the dock for three days until it was time to go home. I told him he wasn't messing up the rest of our fishing trip and it would give him some time to work on his landing net technique. Mike Kansas
1596842,wallydave,2013-03-25 12:17:00,2151,"""We nearly blew our boat out of the water when the dynamite went off sooner than we thought! Wow, that was close?!"""
1596874,DMella,2013-03-25 12:20:00,32,"Last Aug my young (12-8-7yo) boys and I went out at sun up on Perrault. We had nice walleye right off the bat and noticed that another boat about 200 yards east looked to be having engine trouble. The wind was stong for the early morning and I noticed that the man was messing with the prop. We hooked into another walleye and the boys and I were guessing that they had wrapped line around the prop... like we had the day before - wind and trolling with a young family . As soon as we landed and released the fish I looked up and saw the female in the boat waving to us and the males head bobbing in the waves behind the boat. We did our quick stow drill and zoomed over to the couple. When we pulled up learned that the man - in his 60's - couldnt swim, was not wearing a PFD, and was a big guy: there was no way his wife was getting him back in the boat. He also had a couple cuts that were bleeding.We had a ladder on our boat, so the boys did their best to stabilize the boats in the wind and waves and I pulled the male around our boat to the ladder side. It was all I could do to get him into the boat. He was already exhausted! Thankfully, everyone was safe and we even retrieved his hat with our net now nearly 70 yards away - did I mention windy! This was a great conversation starter for the my family and the boys got to feel proud of their level headed work in a hazardous situation."

This didn't involve our group but...not many on here have heard about a place on the Eastern portion of Rainy Lake called Mudges camp..this was in the early 80's..the deal was you would drive east on hwy 11 and stop in Mine Centre to call the lodge..they owner would send out his son in law in a big launch and haul all the remaining gear ( out of the 16 guys in the group we had 4 boats)...we got to camp and fished for the week and then repeated the process in reverse order and we were on our way home..turns out that there was a group coming in after we left and one of the guys had a fatal heart attack on the dock while waiting to be brought out to the camp..as one of our guys was tight with the camp owner we heard about this when we got home..turns out most of the people in our group knew the guy as he locally owned a gas station in out area..

1592034,SinOrSwim,2013-03-24 09:09:00,1528,"We have run out of beer on a fly-in more than once. That was early on in our history and after that we would go way overboard on how much beer we take. No major medical emergencies but we did have a black bear break into our screened porch one year and take a bag of garbage. Again, we were early on in our history and didn't really pay attention or respect the bear rules etc. Needless to say though, anytime someone had to pee in the middle of the night we would all go outside as a group and pee off the deck with flashlights roaming the woods. We used to take a satellite phone with us as well when we did fly-ins. Now, we drive in to Lac Seul and there are times we can actually get cell service on the lake. One cabin we use to go to has a grave stone or a memorial stone. We got really drunk one day/evening and started talking about what we thought might have happened to the guy. We had a memorial service for him. LOLOLOL I can't stop laughing typing this. There we were, a bunch of grown men drunker than skunks having a memorial service for someone we A- didn't know and B - had no idea what happened or when. I can still envision my brother (Hawkfan) talking.. Aaaahhhhhhh, JIM! WHY??? Whyyyyyyy???? Why did you have to leave us. It was serious at the time (again drunk) but we have it on video somewhere. I literally am laughing out loud in my office while I type this. LOLOLOL"
1592514,drew59,2013-03-24 11:13:00,87,"About 2009 my family and I pulled into Ryden's at the Pidgeon River crossing to gas up on our way to Forrest Lodge. As I stood there I thought I could smell something ""hot"". I walked around to the other side of the trailer and found smoke billowing from the wheel bearing. The fender was mostly melted and the tire appeared to be ready to fall off. How the tire didn't start on fire I'll never know. Following my boat as it sat on a flat bed back to Grand Marais was not enjoyable. I have no idea how I didn't notice the problem sooner. All things considered it could have been worse, but I became a boat renter after that. The lesson: don't over pack the bearings and check them during the trip."
1592794,Tonyo,2013-03-24 13:03:00,212,"I am happy to report that our group has missed the big emergencies while fishing Gullrock but we have had an opportunity to help someone else that was in trouble. We were finishing up our day and noticed something white across the other side of the lake. It looked like someone was waving a white flag. So, out of curiosity we took the one mile ride and checked it out. Sure enough there were 2 gentleman, in there 60's, that had spent the past several hours throwing an anchor out as far as they could and dragging themselves out to the point. They had spun the prop off of there boat and didn't have any way to get themselves back to camp. They told us that they didn't think they would make it to the point before dark and thought they were spending the night out on that point. We picked them up and there gear, secured the camp boat and took them back to the camp they were staying at. All turned out ok but it could have been a long night for a couple of guys that were extremely tired. We all need to make sure we check into things that are not right or out of place. It proved to be the right thing and felt great to help them out. TonyO"

I had the guy in the next cabin pounding on the door yelling ""your boat is on fire"". I looked toward the boat and it was surrounded with green smoke. Needless to say that was the end of that motor. Last year I had some of those snowshoe hares chew out a wiring harness under my truck. Took out the four wheel drive and a $400 repair. Hoping for an uneventful trip this year."
