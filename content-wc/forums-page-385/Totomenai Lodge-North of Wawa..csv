1644425,Wawajake,2013-04-07 06:43:00,413,"Ironically most of the ""100 cabins"" are owned by Americans, only a half dozen of us were Canadian owners, (they are land lease cabins) I sold my cabin three years ago, to a local friend. The lake has good fishing, but it depends a lot on lake levels because this is a hydro reservoir, this spring should be good because lots of snow melt. It is so big a lake you can easily find your own spot."
1685753,Jaskonie,2013-04-17 20:35:00,80,"I dont care who owns them and why would it be ironic for Americans to own cabins. Bottom line the lake has a lot of cabins. I was just pointing out you can look at lakes a lot closer now with google and get a look at the surrounding area. You can't see what on the flag pole though, if it matters to you."
1687273,Fish_Heads,2013-04-18 08:48:00,154,"If you know your way around the lake, there is probably 30 or more linear miles of water you can fish there, including the river, Manitowic Lake/ Blue bay, 90 % of it only accessible by boat. 100 cabins in that distance isn't much really, & they're never all occupied at the same time ever. I've been going there the past 12 years, & some days mid week you won't see but 2 or 3 other boats in the remote parts of the lake all day, down by the main section off Whitefish lake road, where 85% of the cabins are, sure they're is boat traffic, but not what I'd call crowded.........ever.Fish"
1688073,Wawajake,2013-04-18 10:56:00,413,"A little over sensitive Jaskonie ! The irony is that an American looking for remote Canadian lake ends up going to a lake , where primarily American camp owners are the local fishermen. ...........it was smile not a dig ! If it is any consolation I will lie on here and tell everybody it is a lousy fishing hole so that the locals can have more good fishing for themselves . My new reccomendation is it is a terrible lake"
1689929,Fish_Heads,2013-04-18 19:30:00,154,Really don't go there !Jake........Let me know when you're gonna be up & I'll meet ya at Todd's with a cold one. we'll be up a total of 3 weeks this summer.Fish_Heads(Tom)
1690169,Jaskonie,2013-04-18 20:32:00,80,No hard feelings...really..like I said all the lakes have fish.
1691745,Wawajake,2013-04-19 09:35:00,413,"Sounds Good Jaskonie And Fishheads.........both summer of 2010 and summer 2011 my wife and I did a July week at Todd's. In 2011 , water was way down, but suprisingly the fish were easier to catch as long as I tried to figure out what new channels they would try to use to get up to shallows at night. When I had a camp there I was one of the nutbars that regularly ran the rapids at the Shiky Logging Bridge . (spring and Summer) Got a 42 inch pike out of the Preacher hole (CR) besides good walleye many places along river and Lake. Miss the place, won't get there this summer , helping my daughter build a new house, hopefully next summer at Todd's. Damm it Fishheads ...you got me to tell you it is a good lake"
1692529,Fish_Heads,2013-04-19 13:15:00,154,Grab one of Todd's Brochures & notice the the guy holding a pike in the one picture..........I still wear that good luck blue flannel shirt every time I go out piken'.........but then again maybe maybe it's not the lake that's good ??? Other spots off the main lake maybe ?? (Only my family & Todd know for sure.)We did great the year the lake was down too..........just had to rethink the fishin' a bit. Did alot of land exploring that year & found some old camps that are all under water now. Also got some of my anchors back as well as a rod my brother lost off the boat the year before !Take careFish
511276,Guest,2001-03-02 11:02:00,0,I'm thinking of booking a week at Totomenai Lodge. Can anyone give us some information about the fishing? The lodge is located on Whitefish lake about 6 miles north of Wawa. Please help! Good or bad fishing-don't book etc. Thank you.
511277,FISH4U,2001-03-24 03:28:00,204,"You will catch alot of SMALL walleyes 8-14""never saw one over 3 1/2 lbs.PIKE FISHING RANGE FROM 18"" up to 38"" all on ""LIVE BAIT""very hard to get them hit lures.Lake is controlled by a dam, water heights vary alot year to year.Service and food at the lodge is very GOOD.If you are looking for good service and a few fish I would recommend it.If you are looking for a giant trophy's try somewhere else.GOOD LUCK><>I do not FISH to LIVE.I LIVE to FISH.MY WEB SITE:http://communities.msn.com/LakeErieSteelheadFishing"
1436535,Guest,2012-05-16 20:29:00,0,"I don't think that Fish4u has ever fished at Whitefish lake. I have fished at Totomenai lodge for the last seven years and even when we had a bad year, the three of us that always go up there have always caught over a hundred walleye each. We actually had one evening at Outline Bay that we caught over a hundred walleye each in just an hour and a half. We have never matched that feat since but when conditions are right, good things happen. Granted there are a lot of small walleye but even they are fun to catch. Besides, with Ontario's rules, you can only bring back 4 walleye. We have also caught walleye as long as 28"". Have caught ten pound lake trout, a few whitefish, some very nice pike, and hundreds of small mouth bass. The main bait of choice is leeches for walleye and bass but the pike like spoons and Mepps. Lake trout go for blade baits. It's a lot of fun . The staff is great and the food is terrific. Try having Frank cook your walleye for breakfast. Yes for breakfast. It's great with eggs and pancakes. If you need some pictures to convince you, contact me at [email protected]. Be glad to send you a few"
1438484,Guest,2012-05-21 15:53:00,0,100 walleye each in an hour and half? in 90 minutes each guy landed 100 fish? One every 54 seconds? Were they jumping into the boat?
1438573,phishfearme,2012-05-21 18:52:00,1242,"you hit the nail on the head! anytime a ""guest"" writes a total BS report like this i always wonder who's behind it! caveat emptor phish"
1438621,Fish_Heads,2012-05-21 20:16:00,154,"I have caught my share of fish on Whitefish lake, but wouldn't stay at Totomenai to do it. (Personal reasons)The fish are there, you just have to find them. The numbers the other poster mentioned are possible, it happened to us, but only 3 times in 11 years that the fish were on totally on fire like that. Most years its just a good spread over a days fishing, with a couple of hot hours mixed in. Found a 6' wide creek that the fishfinder said was 3' deep & it showed football sized fish.........thought the f finder was wrong till the 3 - 4 lb smallmouth started blowing out of the water after our lures.........wow !I have those 3 spots locked in my list of go to places, but there's a total of 20 miles of distance between them.I'm there 3 weeks every summer, but also travel to the many other lakes in the area to fish as well.Fish_Heads"
1472832,Guest,2012-08-09 14:43:00,0,"Fished there three years in early 2000's. The first poster sums it up nicely, added to by the one who won't stay there. I'm in the same boat. Good place when Frank is there, stay away if he isn't."
1639633,Guest,2013-04-05 11:41:00,0,Just booked for the sixth year in a row. You have to know where to go and at what time of day to go there to catch fish. Second year there we went to the right spots but at the wrong time of the day. Caught two sixteen inch smallmouth bass last year. The walleye fishing was not as good last year as we caught alot of thirteen inch fish but not any over eighteen inches. Frank's cooking is great and walleye for breakfast really hits the spot. They clean all of your fish and freeze them for you on the American plan. I have fished at other places but didn't like doing all of my own cooking and fish cleaning. Here all you have to do is go fishing and eat alot. Everybody has different likes but for my group we like Totomenai Lodge
1639713,Kmanster,2013-04-05 12:16:00,26,"Been there once a few years back. We did just fine on Walleye and Smallies. I would recomend one of the guides. He took us out and at my request, we spent the first hour or so driving to spots and putting them in my GPS. He was very forthcoming with spots and best times to chase them.Hope this helps."
1642210,Jaskonie,2013-04-06 08:35:00,80,look at the lake there are over 100 cabins in and around this lodge. I saw that and moved on. The lake is big so you can run an hour north to get away from it all. There are many other options available if you are looking for a more private setting. All of the lakes have walleye and other fish in them. Thats why I go to canada
