1485686,nitrodude,2012-09-12 08:35:00,60,"Heading back to Sioux Lookout for our 18th consecutive year. We plan on spending another 10 day trip fishing on Seul, 'Taki, Abrahms, Pelican, plus a number of smaller lakes, and the English and Sturgeon rivers. We arrive with not much of a plan on where to fish and decide on the spot to go where we feel and the conditions merit. No matter what, we always have a great time and always catch a load of fish. We even keep a few eaters for frying at the cabin a several times during the week to enjoy the fruits of our labor. I can hardly wait!"

1484996,Bigstorm,2012-09-10 11:28:00,799,"We're pushing our trip back to the 3rd week in July, English River at Grassy Narrows. The past 3 years have been the 3rd week in June here, 5 years prior to that was 3rd or 4th week of July.We moved up to 3rd week in June for the past few 3 yrs hoping the fishing would be even better than we are used to up there. I cant say we've done any better in June that we ever did in July and the weather seems a lot more stable in July so we are switching it back going forward.I guess it makes sense, when the weather is 50F and raining 1 day then sunny and 80F the next, it can mess up a the bite to some extent."
