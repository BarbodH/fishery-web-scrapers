1584850,tlee,2013-03-21 20:49:00,65,Last time fishing for Lake Trout we started by jigging while chumming with sucker belly. We caught a couple but nothing great. We caught a lot more with 3 way setups but it gets too heavy pulling those around. This time I'm taking the down riggers up. Do you use the same setup as salmon? ie. flasher & fake squid or herring strip We were there the second week of June last time and it will be that same time this year. From what I've read they should be still fairly shallow? Any suggestions?
1589386,zeebee,2013-03-23 11:17:00,1144,"I do a fair bit of Laker fishing in shield lakes (ie northern Canada). Dont do a lot in June however, what Ive done indicates the lakers start to move deeper within 3 weeks of ice out. Up till then shallower bays (ie < 15ft preferably with a stream/river flowing in have been productive for me trolling jointed rap floater size 9...blue/silver or gold/black. Once they move deeper I downrigg and exclusively use the larger size Len Thompson spoon in firetiger. Outfishes every other lure Ive tried by a large margin...in fact Im so confident with it that I dont even bother to bring any other spoons ...only mod I make is replacing the treble with a siwash."
1594905,Piscatorian,2013-03-25 00:10:00,12,"Depends very much where you are going -- how far north, and how big, deep, and clear the lake is, etc. At the very north end of the province, you could find big lakers as shallow as 8-20 ft at that time. I'm guessing you will not be that far north given the equipment you are bringing, though? On some waters further south, they may be as much as 50-70 ft deep at that time. Dodgers and hoochies can do very well. I have never heard of using flashers for trout, though."
1595410,briand,2013-03-25 07:30:00,48,The way the weather looks like this year it will be late melt and mid june the trout should be resonably shallow yet

1611234,KEEBOY,2013-03-28 15:22:00,61,We fish in that area the first week of June and like the others said they could be very shallow 5'-10' or from our experience transitioning to deeper water 20'-30'. With late ice out we typically don't do that well because water temps are still cold everywhere and they can show up anywhere. But if they are in that mid range depth we use bottom bouncers 2-3 oz to get you down and pull J13 jointed raps. Seems like the black and silver or gold and black produce the best with about a 6'-7' leader. And we troll slow. .5 to 1 mph on the gps need to just find the speed that works. We have had some unbeleivable days doing this.
1620857,Thor29,2013-03-31 14:14:00,36,"Athap?In early June lakers will be up. Trolling most anything and they will bite. Use a spoon called a depth charge. Greenish blue, works great. You will get numbers but as a norm nothing big. If your looking for 25 lbs and up, jigging is the way to go. Where do you plan on going?"
1621873,NMG,2013-03-31 19:38:00,1053,"Trolling for Lakers in BC, we'd use spoons, plugs and Rapala's. All could work very well at various times."
1667473,corey006,2013-04-13 05:21:00,1,"Ice out will be late this year so down rigger will probably not be neccesary in early June.Icefishing I was catching trout this year anywhere from 20 ft. to 65 ft(bottom)....on the edge of a reef.About 20ft. from my iceshack a guy caught 44 incher 20 ft. below the ice.Are you fishing the BIG lake or small lake?In June I am normally fishing for Walleye and go for Lakers in Summer and Winter.I would troll 15 to 25 ft I like to use Williams Whitefish or Wabler, Len Thompson 5 of Diamonds."
1678761,tlee,2013-04-16 09:04:00,65,Were are going up there walleye fishing but just for a change would like to catch some lakers. A couple years ago we stayed at Bakers Narrows and fished for lakers on the south end of Athapapuskow.
