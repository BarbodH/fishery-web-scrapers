1657825,bob888,2013-04-10 14:44:00,244,Is non-alcoholic beer (0.5% or less of alcohol) free from being counted in the 24 twelve ounce containers of beer allowed duty free? Thanks!
1658041,dmb130,2013-04-10 15:45:00,21,"Here ya go:Alcoholic beverages are products that exceed 0.5% alcohol by volume. Minimum ages for the importation of alcoholic beverages, as prescribed by provincial or territorial authorities, are 18 years for the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Quebec and 19 years for the remaining provinces and territories. I have never seen anyone importing non-alcoholic beer and I had to look it up!"

1667529,bob888,2013-04-13 05:52:00,244,"O.K. I also don't like non alcoholic beer and routinely drink strong IPA beers as I love their taste. I'm closer to 80 than 70 and my fishing trips up north it ends up that I drink two or three or more beers each evening. My body just can't metabolize alcohol like it used to. So I've tested a couple non-alcoholic beers mixed with Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPA. It has a strong taste and when mixed 50/50 with a non-alcoholic beer tastes a **** of a lot better than Bud, and all the other beers in the same category."
