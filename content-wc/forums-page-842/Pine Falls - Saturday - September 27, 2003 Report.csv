Headed out to Traverse Bay, did not see one Walleye get caught the whole day, not to mention in our boat. Landed 3 Silver Bass. Trolled, Drift Jigged, etc. Spoke with a group from Iowa and they concurred that there is nothing happening yet. Still no sign of current or greenbacks Hope this is the calm before the storm!"

We had a mixed bag - cats - bass and pickeral - but still not alot. A few other boats did very well with some biger fish being caught. It looks like some of you may be preping for the Tourney at Pine Falls - but for those of you who just want to catch some fish - then the End of Main may currently be the best bet."
535245,Hawgeye,2003-10-05 23:21:00,1355,"From Thursay through Saturday we fished hard from sunrise to 5pm. We caught a total of 7 walleyes all two and a half days. They ranged from 17 to 20 inches. We spoke with many other boats and we did as well or better than most. Could not understand why there are no commercial nets out. I did see the local indian nets in the river smattered about but no commercial ones. Is this because they are not there or did the commercial entity leave the area? Bottom line is this is the worst I have seen it in my 14 years of fishing there. It has been declining for the last 5 years and this is the worst. Is this the end of this fishery for the quantity and quality that we have come to know? The water was down at least 3-4' overall in the system which is amazing. I marked rock structures on the GPS that I have never seen above water. I will still continue to make the trip for a short period of time but with this poor fishing, it won't be long. There is definately something wrong. Don't give me this comment ""they will be here soon"" because they are not coming in the numbers they once did. I truly believe it will happen but not in the vast numbers that we once saw. Sorry about the bad report but for you that come from Nebraska and Iowa, you may want to reconsider where you go on your fishing trip. Long drive for just a few eyes'!"
535253,Guest,2003-10-06 16:05:00,0,It was getting good early last week and then things started to decline. Tough out there today. The lake is still not going and fish in the river are not active.

As I mentioned on another bulletin board, spoke to the local Pine Falls fishing ""authority"" who has been fishing Pine Falls for almost 40 years and he claims he has never seen it this bad in his life time! I have heard local people who make there living on the minnow trade say they were coming in fast and furious this year on both the Winnipeg River and the Red River. Interesting to see that the walleye have not followed.. Guess this helps answer the debate of what brings in the greenbacks...I would say that current plays a bigger factor than the supply of bait fish."
535257,Guest,2003-10-07 05:32:00,0,"Alot of people don,t know that rainbow smelt populations have increased in the main lake. so our theory is along with low current conditions why would walleye come to the river for a snack when theres a buffet happening on the main lake? Also with no commercial nets in the bay that alone has has got to tell you something. Those boys make there living of the system."

535269,gms,2003-10-07 18:26:00,91,"Here are the Pine Falls Mill Boat Launch coordinates N50°34.445' W96°13.971' Pine Falls is a 1hr 15 minute ride north of Winnipeg, Manitoba. From Winnipeg you can ride the 59 Hwy till you arrive at the #304 Junction (about 55 minutes), turn right and Pine Falls is about 20 minutes from the junction. Hope this helps. gms"
