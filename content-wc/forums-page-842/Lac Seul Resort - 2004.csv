535152,Guest,2003-09-24 12:56:00,0,"Planning on a 2004 trip to Lac Seul - sometime towards the end of July but never fished these waters before. I am looking for recommendations for a clean, modern, moderately priced resort. We will have 8 people (3 dads, 5 sons)in our party. We would bring one boat but would need 2 from the resort. I have read posts on WC about places like Evergreen, Golden Fawn, Andersons to name a few. There are many more I am not mentioning. If you were responsible for coordinating the trip, where would you recommend? Thanks Steve"
535154,Guest,2003-09-24 13:58:00,0,We have been fishing Lac Seul for 15 years. It all is great fishing and from what I have heard and seen the Resorts are all very accomadating. Your problem is going to be getting a reservation. If I were you I would type Lac Seul into my internet site now and start calling the Resorts that come up in order to get a spot for next year. This Lake is such a great fishery that most of the reservations are made year to year by by repeat customers....Good Luck
535169,Guest,2003-09-25 11:42:00,0,"Most resorts have openings in July and early August. It is almost impossible to get into resorts near Ear Falls in June. I've stayed at several resorts at Ear Falls and Souix Lookout. If I were to go in July I would go to Chamberlin Narrows operated by Ojibwa Outfitters. This camp is located about 30 miles from the landing and is a boat to resort. I think CN is starting to get pricy given the fact that there are resorts and lakes that have the same quality of fishing and accomodations. The owner is not the most friendly guy. However, if you want nice accomadations and excellent summer fishing on Lac Suel, this is the place. I've also fished out of Golden Fawn, Evergreen, Goose Bay and Fishermans Cove. In July the Ear Falls side will have fish on the main channel banks, islands and reefs. You might have to go into Steamboat or McKenzie Bay to find fish. Golden Fawn would be my choice followed by Evergreen, Goose and Fisherman's Cove. TGG"
535176,Rich J,2003-09-25 21:38:00,65,I fish out of Evergreen in May and August. When I was there in August they still had a few openings for next year July and August. Give them a call or e-mail and see if what they have fits your needs. They do have a family plan for July and August. I think they have the best camp boats on that end of the lake.
535183,Guest,2003-09-26 09:35:00,0,Thanks for the responses. Looks like Evergreen will be our number 1 choice. I have sent an email to Pat and Gary asking for their availability for the end of July 2004. Steve
535193,Guest,2003-09-26 15:25:00,0,I think Evergreen is a good choice. My wife and I and another couple are going there in June next year. I did a lot of research on Evergreen and everbody I talked to who has been there gave Evergreen a big thumbs up.....GOOD LUCK
535231,Guest,2003-09-28 23:07:00,0,"Another good resort is Golden Eagle just down the road from Evergreen. Good equipment and clean cabins, very reasonable rates. Nice camp!"
535258,Guest,2003-10-07 07:18:00,0,Has anyone had any experience with Lost Island Lake Lodge (good or bad)? My group is thinking of booking a trip to this resort next July and was wondering if the price (somewhat expensive) is worth it. How is the fishing on this part of Lac Seul? How are the amenities of this lodge? This will be our first trip to Lac Seul and we are bringing a couple of dads so we would like to make it a memorable trip. Any help you could give would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Steve
