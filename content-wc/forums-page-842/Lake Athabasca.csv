535167,Guest,2003-09-24 19:41:00,0,This lake is on the Albert/Saskathewan border almost to the Northwest Territories. It's a huge lake over 200 miles long.
535172,fish4fun,2003-09-25 18:45:00,14,It's in northern Saskatchewan. Go if you can.
535180,Atlanta Dave,2003-09-26 07:01:00,323,fish for fun Have you been to lakers . Atlanta Dave
535187,fish4fun,2003-09-26 11:33:00,14,Atlanta Dave- I have only been to the Otherside River Lodge. Lakers Unlimited sounds like the place for big trout. We caught pike and grayling and some trout (nothing big). Great accomodations though.
535196,Guest,2003-09-26 18:09:00,0,"Atlanta Dave, we officially signed up again for Sept 10-17 next year with Lakers. About 5 guys in our group are also going in June. I guess in June you have the best chance for a really huge trout; but I like the steadier action of September. We caught most of our big fish deeper this year...around 20-25 feet. Usually we are catchig them in 8-15 ft. I hope the Johnson Island area holds on for a few more years given the increased fishing pressure. The September week we go was always the last week that Lakers operated; but now they run 2-3 weeks longer. This year, this next week is Laker's last week operatng Johnson Island. I have a friend there, so I'll get a report. One thing for sure is that it's cold. Hawk Eye Mike"
535205,Atlanta Dave,2003-09-27 10:21:00,323,"hAWK EYE I think Johnson is open the first week of Oct. this year . At least I think that is what Tony the guide told me. We get the lakers in the same 8 to 10 feet of water in the second week of June at Spring Bay. Next year in June what week are your people going to be at Johnson?I believe we are going to be at SB the 11th of June. I hope we get back to normal ice outs this comming year we have had two late years and it is making the fishing tougher. In 2002 we got into Spring Bay Collin River , by busting through the ice and then during the day the wind shifted and we were iced in. Fortunatly a plane came to the camp and they sent him after us had to leave the boats in spring bay. Later Atlanta Dave"
535229,Guest,2003-09-28 19:12:00,0,"Atlanta Dave, my friends are going the second week of June to Spring Bay. They are going more for the pike than the lakers. You asked in another post about tipping guides, and I would say on average we have given $350-400 to the guide for the week for two fisherman. Most of the guys who got a 40# laker tipped something extra for that. A guide can make or break a trip, and we've been fortunate to have good guides."
535232,Atlanta Dave,2003-09-29 05:37:00,323,"Hawkeye Your guys are going to be up the same week with us June 11th through the 18th ,Give them my email if they use email and we can stay in touch during the winter.There are four of us and a father and son from Chicago who will be there that week. We normaly play poker every night if your friends are interested. Our group has 2 guys who pound pike most of the week and 2 guys who do a considrable ammount of trout fishing so we cover all bases. Am looking forward to next June already, Atlanta Dave"
534882,Atlanta Dave,2003-09-09 18:14:00,323,We leave thurs for a week of fall fishing at Lake Athabasca. Had a june trip we had a few great fish. One of our group got a camp best 42 lb laker. One of the other guys in camp got a 28 pound pike . Caught many pike over 20 lbs with countless in the teens. Probably about 8 lakers over thirty betweeen the 8 of us in camp. This despite some tough weather. Have never fished Sept up there before should be a different experience. Hope to see the northern lights. Also with the trout spawning the numbers should be awesome. Will deffinatly put some time in after the elusive 30 lb pilke . Hope some of the big girls I have hooked over the years in June will show up several pounds heavier next week. Will post results when we get back. Atlanta Dave
534892,fish4fun,2003-09-10 10:55:00,14,I was there a few years ago. Great place. Are you staying at the Otherside River Lodge or with Lakers Unlimited? I look forward to your report.
534908,Atlanta Dave,2003-09-11 09:12:00,323,fISH FOR FUN We stay at lakers unlimited at the spring bay camp. Have you stayed at Lakers when you were there? Am leaving in 30 mins but I will post my results when I get back. Atlanta Daze
534926,fish4fun,2003-09-11 19:27:00,14,We stayed at the Otherside River Lodge. Top notch facilities but I think you are closer to the big lake trout where you are staying. I wish I was going with you. Good luck.
534968,Hawk Eye Mike,2003-09-13 20:35:00,56,"I just returned from Lakers Unlimited and Lake Athabasca. The water was warmer than normal, so the lakers weren't on the flats and the fishing was tougher. Nevertheless, our group of nine anglers caught 17 lakers over 30 lbs, and one over 40 lbs. The lake is seeing more fishing pressure, so the fishing is not as phenomenal as in the past. Still a great fishery though."
535071,Guest,2003-09-20 14:07:00,0,"Atlanta Dave, how did you do on Lake Athabasca with Lakers Unlimited? Are you back? Hawk Eye Mike"

535156,Guest,2003-09-24 14:33:00,0,"Hawkeye Mike Got back Sat we did OK but not what I had hoped for. Our group of 4 got 3 pike over 20lbs was hoping to at least get to the high 20s. It was tough pike fishing very few numbers or size. The Lakers were everywhere but mostly small under 10 lbs. Thoes you could easily catch 100 per day pr man but was kind of boring after a short while. Because of wind we got out to Beartooth Island only one day had a 33lb trout and 4 more in the 20s for our group. Got to see the northern lights for the first time and enjoyed it, I guess I will stick with my early June trip and forget the fall fishing. They did catch many more big fish at Johnson Island but still not enought to bring me back. Have you been to Lakers and at which camp and what year and date. Atlanta Dave"
535159,Guest,2003-09-24 14:59:00,0,"Atlanta Dave, I've been fishing Johnson Island in September for 4 years. I fished Spring Bay also one time in August for pike, and didn't do very well. Over the 4 September trips to Johnson with Lakers Unlimited, our group of 9-10 guys have caught as many as 45 lakers over 30# in a trip, and this year's total of 17 over 30#. There is another big camp now operating by Foster/Long Island (Indian Head), which has increased the fishing pressure. We were a little early this year with the warmer weather too. Not one day did it get below 40 at night. Next year with leap year, our week moves back to Sept 10-17, and that should be prime time. We had heard through guide Bob Cotrell (sp?) that you were catching a bunch of trout at Spring Bay, but not the size you were looking for. Overall, the lake trout fishing is still first-rate; but not quite as hot as it used to be in my opinion."
535164,Atlanta Dave,2003-09-24 17:41:00,323,"Hawk eye As I said the small lakers were every cast or you would troll about 1 min when you were in them and get hit. We have been to Jonhson once and then to SB for the last 4 years in June. June is usually great last year with the ice when we finallty got to Spring Bay, Colin River, I got 8 pike from 20 to 25 1/2 lbs in one day. A day to remember. Spoils me for life. One of our group got the SB record for trout this june 42 1/2. I think a fifty is waiting in the bay just not enough time spent fishing for trout. Jeff has been bugging us about the great pike fishing in August but ;your account is about what I really feel is there. I think occasionally they get the odd big one but in general it is hard to beat June. If you want to email me at [email protected] Atlanta Dave"
