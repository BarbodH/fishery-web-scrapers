535174,McQ,2003-09-25 20:08:00,615,While up to the Gouin on our mid-August promo trip we had the pleasure of being escorted for a day by the conservation/management people. Claud the guy in charge just sent me an email with a couple of pictures of big fish caught at the end of August. They can be viewed on my group site - just go to the pictures/fish album and scroll down http://groups.msn.com/McQonFishing then click on the title for a larger view. Now you know why I love this part of Quebec - these shots will keep me coming back for years.
