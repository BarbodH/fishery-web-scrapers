As each day passes and each night bringscooler temperatures, the Red is starting to heat up with respects to the Fall Run! There was some double figure fish caught pulling cranks as well as on jigs yesterday! I feel that by the end of the weekend there will be much more to report on. I'll be hitting them hard this coming week and I'll be only to happy to post the results regardless which way the cards fall! Fish ""HARD"" Forever!"

535214,Guest,2003-09-27 18:14:00,0,"They weren't for us, tried drifting with salts, trolling with crank baits and had to go with grenades to get anything in the boat. Going to try worms next weekend, find a spot with lots of boats and drop anchor."

I had more action on the cats then I did on the walleye and I didn't get a cat into the boat. Caught some little saugers. I did the same thing anchored, drifted and pulled cranks. There must have been about 30 boats on the river between Selkirk and Lockport and I never saw a walleye caught big or small. Not going back until I hear some real positive reports. A little on the nippy side today."

Yesterday one old boy caught and released a 6#, 10# and a 12#! I personally know of some other trophies that were caught and released both on jig methods and by pulling cranks........ They're not going ballistic yet, but it's still early. This up coming week shoulkd prove interesting and I'm confident that we'll see some very positive results. Fish ""HARD"" Forever!"
535224,Guest,2003-09-28 07:53:00,0,"When I go fishing, I generally don't get wound up, I still find it just plain old fun to get in my 12ft monster and avoid the odd swamping, LOL. I was feeling good yestrday when I left as I hadn't seen anyone else catch a fish, the only time I feel like sinking my boat is when every one around you is singing the ""Fishon Song"" and I'm not. I'll head back next weekend and the next and the next, until I get me one. Mike"

535230,manitobammm,2003-09-28 19:28:00,1,"Same thing, fished the red all day and evening, jigged, cranked nothing. all day. then around 7 my buddy pulls up to us and asked how we were doing. after i whined telling nothing he say they have 12 and he they got them all in the creek in 5 feet of water. he shows me and i coulndt beleive it, 12 and the biggest was 24 inches and the smallest was 17 inches, so being a little choked about not getting any satiurday i decided to try the creek today. i had my limit by noon and all all i did was set the trolling motor on 1 and jigged while i slowly went down the bank of the channel, they were biting ever so lightly, im telling you i fed alot of them. there in the creek for now i guess."
