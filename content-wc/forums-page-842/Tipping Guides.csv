535240,Guest,2003-10-04 15:14:00,0,I think 200 to 300 total is more apropriate at the high end lodges. duffy
535242,gms,2003-10-04 18:59:00,91,On our last venture to the NWT. We went with $100 per day per boat (2 in a boat).
535273,Guest,2003-10-08 07:00:00,0,"Yes, I'll agree with you on tipping guides in NWT atleast 100 per day, and that depends on the fishing not the guide. When you goto the NWT you'd expect big fish and you usually get them. I guided on Great Bear Lake and you heard of the big trout in there. Well they had guides there that were fresh out of university or college who didn't know that much about fishing but they did ok for guiding people and they were tipped about 100 per day. But the guides that knew what they were doing and consistently putting big fish in the boat were tipped sometimes 200 per day, not to bad for 6 days of fishing = 1200 in tip. Now take fishing in NWO for example, you only get a couple lakes where you might get a 40 lb. laker. Your guide will make up for the difference so now you'd be tipping based on fishing and guide. I've been tipped anywhere from 40 to 200 per day here in ontario. As for tipping cooks, thats something I don't know about...lol but I know they liked to be tipped too."
