534585,McQ,2003-08-23 11:09:00,615,"Seanik, L'Oasis du Gouin is one of a dozen or so outfitters on the Gouin Reservoir. It got my attention this year when I was involved in reporting the low water level effect at the beginning of the season. I have had the pleasure of fishing many regions of the Gouin over the last 20 years and this was one particular part of the reservoir that I had never been on. I shared some advice and info with a few fishermen who were going there and I decided to give it a try too. A little investigation indicates lower rates by all the lodges after the opening peak frenzy. The fishing never tails off anywhere up there, summer patterns are consistant and a fifteen minute ride in the camp boats will put you on productive water. After the experiences on the first trip (housekeeping) I was invited back to host the camera & radio crews for a Quebec Tourism promo. We managed to get on a good walleye bite everyday we were there on both trips, got some great pike action during the first trip but didn't have enough time to work the waters for them on the second. Relative to your question about the road - it's a well maintained logging road for the trip into the area, the last twenty miles are bush road maintained by the outfitter and recent rains played havoc with the surface - he just didn't have an opportunity to grade it before we arrived - the first trip was a breeze, we just went slower on the second trip because we were towing a boat. We towed that boat in the second trip to satisfy part of the promo consideration. Camp boats are either 14 or 16 foot fiberglass hulls powered by 15 hsp Merc motors. They'll cover the water at about 10 - 15 miles an hour and are stable fishing platforms. I used them all but one day on both trips. I'd recommend you bring a seat with you so that you can rest your back. The parking area is gated and chain locked - there is absolutely no vehicle access to other than lodge guests. The lodge has its own airstrip and is also serviced by a number of float plane operations. The food and service on the American Plan is in my experience average for this type of lodge, we brought snacks with us and brought them back home unopened. None of us experienced any hunger pangs and we all enjoy our food. If you wanted anything extra it was only a matter of asking. The deserts were a special treat. As a matter of interest, I am suitably impressed with this lodge to set up a summer get together for my buddies on my home website for next year. The plan is to completely occupy the lodge the first week of August 2004. The operators have a genuine interest in making sure you enjoy your stay with them and take the necessary steps to look after you well. If I can be of any further help to you or others who have an interest in the Gouin or other places in Quebec I have experienced, just drop me an email through my profile info."
534586,nemio,2003-08-23 11:37:00,96,"Fishing is still very good in July, August and September. Quebecers think the only good months for fishing are the end of May t'ill end of June; after that fishing pressure is very low. In regard of the road, like MQ say; there is floatplane, airstrip and also a service by train (Via Rail) and this is a very scenic rail ride. You can take the train directly under your hotel in Montreal to Parent and the outfitter can pick you up in Parent (1hr. from the lodge). Talk about accessibility. If I can help in anyway just ask."
534590,Seanik,2003-08-23 17:19:00,218,"Thank you again for all your information. I am convinced I will be there in 2004 even if I have to forceably drag the wimps in our group. We will probably rent a Ford conversion van. We will book early, before the end of the year. Used leeches previously with good success and will bring them again, bought them at a service station in Manawaki. We bought clamp on seats last year they sure saved the old back a lot of misery. From your posts I don't think towing a boat there is necessary. Will be watching the board for any future posts."
534618,E_Fish_N_See,2003-08-25 12:16:00,26,"Seanik, if the fear of the Gravel Road is a concern, try Deerhorn Lodge. Their ""Gravel"" road is only 18 miles long. Fishing in the Cabonga appears to be getting better, too. My father and I caught mostly 18 to 24 inch Walleye. Even got a nice 5 pounder this year. On the subject of Gouin, is it a Gravel road all the way to Parent? What about after Parent? Mark"
534619,McQ,2003-08-25 13:23:00,615,"Mark, you've introduced another aspect about fishing in Quebec - there are just so many great spots that sometimes it can be hard to decide on a final destination. I too have experienced great outings on the Cabonga in the past as well as other areas of La Verendrye Park. While easily accessed spots can and do provide excellent fishing, there is a mystique to getting further into the bush. The Gouin is one of those really special places. Yes the trip in is on a well maintained sand/gravel logging road for 179 miles, beginning at Mont St Michel just north of Mont Laurier but what you discover upon arrival is well worth the trip. If driving distances on a gravel road is of concern to anyone there are many float plane services available and sharing a Beaver with 4 others is very economical. Cost depends on how many airmiles you may choose to travel. This particular operator has an excellent landing strip for wheeled craft and their website has a detailed access map - check it out www.fishing-quebec.com"
534915,idapaul,2003-09-11 15:03:00,82,"nemio are you sure you got the right newspaper there is no chicago daily herald that i know of. called the chicago tribune outdoor desk and they never heard of the people you mentioned give a man a fish you feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and he forgets about eating."
534916,McQ,2003-09-11 15:14:00,615,Here's a directlink to Mike Jackson's column page http://www.dailyherald.com/sports/col_jackson.asp The article on the Gouin should be archived sometime over the next few weeks. You can also tune in to Mike's radio show at http://www.osrn.com or http://www.mikejacksonoutdoors.com/
534921,idapaul,2003-09-11 18:23:00,82,"McQ first off sorry i got your name mixed up with nemio. secondly i appologize, but i have never heard of that newspaper. proabably stands to reason the tribune would not tell me any thing about it.i am planning to go to either gouin or baskatong for northern next year. when would you say is the best time for northern. i usually fish rainy lake or namakan out by fort francis. i understand that gouin has no weed beds so what do i try to key on for northern. also my brother is interested in trying to get northern on a fly rod, is that possible or are they to deep for that?again sorry but i just had not heard of that newspaper. if you can be of anyhelp with the questions i asked i would appreciate it"
534922,McQ,2003-09-11 19:02:00,615,"No problem, with the number of posters on this site it's easy to get contributors mixed up. If your trip is specifically for a great northern bite then try to book early June - the pike are everywhere. With regards to location the Baskatong is easier to fish - smaller in size and more heavily populated. The Gouin on the other hand is much larger with about the same number of outfitters. I like both areas but for different reasons - the Baskatong is a well developed resort area and is accessed over paved roads - a location I choose for family vacations. The Gouin is more primitive and offers me more fishing opportunities so when I'm looking at a week of solid fishing it's one of my first choices. Tell your brother to pack a ton of big streamers - red/white & blue/black - the action on a fly rod in early June can be quite spectacular especially on the Gouin, he'll probably raise some good walleye to the fly too. There are areas of reed growth and small areas of cabbage that will contain pike but you are much better off targeting shallow rock bays. This timing is right at the tail end of the walleye spawn so pike are pretty much in every nook and cranny you choose to toss into."
534927,McQ,2003-09-11 19:47:00,615,"I'm hesitant to recommend going into the Gouin in a passenger car, I've done it with an old beater I had just for that purpose and I've seen many others drive it too. I'm more inclined to suggest at least using a van if a pickup isn't available. The increased road clearance is of value. Although I'm not talking major rock here, there is an abundance of gravel surface in some areas and washboard conditions can follow a heavy rain. Some folks get together and rent a 10 passenger van for the trip and those I've talked to enjoyed the comfort. In all the road trips I have made into the Gouin since 1988 - never a vehicle problem has been incurred but you folks have a lot longer drive to get home than I do. My first five years were by float plane and that's really the way to get around this area. Although I most likely know the oufitter on the Baskatong you are referring to, I'm not familiar with his pike only lake - can't help on that one. Maybe you should look into staying at a lodge in La Verendrye Park - the Domain or Deerhorn may suit you better - it's only another 1 - 2 hours further on paved road."
534928,idapaul,2003-09-11 19:58:00,82,Mcq again thanks for the quick reply. i'll look into the van idea
534939,nemio,2003-09-12 04:22:00,96,"Very good advise again from MQ. The dscription from the Baskatong vs. the Gouin is exactly that; it really depend on what you are looking for. Your decision on renting a van is the perfect choice for that. Plus you won't be restricted on the quantity of little things you want bring with you. One thing: before going you should do some exercice for your biceps, fishing for pikes in June there is a lot of action. Good trip!"
534959,idapaul,2003-09-12 21:53:00,82,nemio thanks for the advice. exercize for the biceps shouldn't be a problem for me i get enough at work and i also run 8 foot 6 inch rods for the extra leverage
535147,McQ,2003-09-23 20:04:00,615,Here's a link to Mike Jackson's column. A short read about our trip to the Gouin.http://www.dailyherald.com/sports/col_jackson.asp
535211,McQ,2003-09-27 17:08:00,615,It's all in here Dave
535215,Atlanta Dave,2003-09-27 18:14:00,323,McQ I had already read the above article I was interested in the average number of fish caught each day per boat and on the size of the fish. I am assuming you were up the last weeek of August. Any more detailed information you can geive me will be greatly appriciated. Thanks in advance Atlanta Dave
535217,McQ,2003-09-27 19:38:00,615,"Dave actually we up on late July then again in mid August. The difference over that two week period was the fish were a little deeper. it would be safe to assume a fifty fish day per boat depending where you fished it could easily approach and/or exceed a 100. If you're solely a trophy fisherman then you have to work a bit harder for the fish over 4 - 5 #s. Fishing is easy and if it's quantity you're looking for it exists everywhere. Bt the way Quebec has over a million lakes, picking or recommending one over the other isn't an easy task. Reflecting on the tone of your experiences at Lake Athabaska, you might want to consider the Mistassinni - Albenal region. Further north above Chibougamou, this area doesn't get near the exposure it should. It's a massive body of water than is equally shared with the Cree's of the region. There are a couple of really good outfitters listed in the outfitters guide. Up here you have walleye, northerns, lakers and specks to fish for. This is truly a trophy fishery but all the attendant costs are there too. There is also the option to go further north to the Radisson region, which has spectacular walleye, northern and trout fisheries. This area just east of James Bay is also accessible by road west and north through Val Dor. There are so many places throughout the Province that offer up the full spectrum of fishing opportunity, it's mind boggling, check out the outfitters guide - I'll be pleased to convey my thoughts, opinions or research to aid in your decision. By the way the listings in the outfitters guide are subject to a provincial rating system that sets the standard."
534925,idapaul,2003-09-11 19:26:00,82,"McQ thanks for your quick reply. we are actually looking at mid june for the time that fits everybody. we have 2 people from connecticut 1 from virginia and i'm from illinois. is the road to gouin accessible to a passenger car without wrecking it? one of the cars is a trans am the other a volvo wagon. i talked to an outfitter on baskatong at the mouth of the gatineau and he said he had a lake that was strictly northern. which would you say is the better shot? thanks again for your prompt reply. you seem to be the resident expert. if you won't think about releasing, don't think about catching"
534458,McQ,2003-08-18 13:07:00,615,"Had another memorable trip into the Gouin Reservoir in Northern Quebec last week. Hosted Mike Jackson from the Chicago Daily Herald, his photographer Mike Seeling and Don Meissner from PBS's Streamside at L'Oasis du Gouin. Four days of chasing walleye - got on a good bite every day in and around 30' on rock ledges. Harnesses, jigs, spoons and cranks all produced fish. Fished with power baits often and gave the new Gulp worms another trial too. Everything tossed into the water caught fish and one day some of the guys tried real offbeat combos to see just what the eyes wouldn't hit - no joy - they were hungry and bit on anything thrown. At one point 8 of us in two boats had 7 walleye on - amazing fishery. We also caught a ton of smaller pike - just couldn't find the big-uns, 25 - 32""ers everywhere. Spent a day with the local Conservation Authority, travelled a 100 mile round trip with them - enjoyed a great shore lunch and were exposed to portions of the Gouin I never knew existed. Man, what a trip."
534482,Seanik,2003-08-19 13:06:00,218,"McQ Looks like you had a great time on the Gouin. We were at Berthelot Lake in mid June. Great weather, 13"" average Walleye,pike few and far in between the Walleye. Someone in a nearby cabin did catch a 40"" and a 48"" Pike. They had a new cook and the american plan food was ok but not as good as previos years. The main reason we are looking for another outfitter was the condition of the 70 miles of gravel road in from Senneterre. The road was recently graded but we traveled after a rain and it was a total washboard both ways(4 hrs eachway), the rental motorhome went into spazams, but recovered nicely with no damage. We are considering Fishing the Gouin because of your postings, one major concern is the drive in. I would appreciate information on the gravel road to Gouin,distance of gravel,condition,and approximate driving time. Thanks in Advance"
534484,McQ,2003-08-19 14:19:00,615,"Seanik The trip was great! Been going into this area for the last 20 years and always enjoy great fishing. Our travel was a bit bumpy for the last 20 miles or so - same rain - same washouts. The lodge we were at is accessed through Parent and the road trip is 6 hours. It's a total of 288 kilometers or 179 miles on well serviced sand & gravel, dusty but not washboard, only the last section was inconvenient. The Parent road is very well maintained because logging operations are in full swing, not unlike travelling an asphalted secondary road. We stop twice on the way in, at Lunic a half way beverage stop and we take a meal in Parent, stop time usually totals an hour or so ( a little longer this time we stopped for blueberry picking for a while ) and is accounted for in the total travel time. We towed a boat in and managed to average about 50 miles an hour. The last section took us an hour though. There is a travel map on the lodges website for reference purposes www.fishing-quebec.com I'd also point out that when I was in to the area 2 weeks prior, before the heavy rains that the last section was in excellent shape - just one of those weather deals you have to contend with to get to the better spots."
534489,nemio,2003-08-19 18:16:00,96,"Excellent description McQ. I can tell that, because I was part of the team. It was a funtastic trip. The funniest part was, when we were trying things that will not catch fish. We were looking in our tackles boxes to find things that will not work, but no ""luck"" they were biting. The quality of fishing is so good, that you can: bottom bouncing with worms, leeches, crank and also jigging and get excellent results. We did got any ""Big"" fish but I know by experience they are there. In regard of the road true for the last 20 miles; but I considered that it's a very low price to pay for that quality of fishing. But for those who like to fly the outfitter got a well maintain landstrip. One another thing to consider; because of the population of walleyes you are allowed to bring 8 fishes back home and enjoy a nice meal with family and friends. Can't wait to go back."
534541,McQ,2003-08-21 08:59:00,615,"Good point about the limits Nemio, on the Gouin you are allowed 8 walleye and 10 northerns - the pike limit indicates quite well the abundance of those toothy critters."
534544,Seanik,2003-08-21 11:13:00,218,"Great informatiom on the Gouin, thank you all for sharing it. If I can get my group of retired oldtimers to agree we may be there next June. WE are all into our senior citizen status and the drive on the gravel road is what causes us to hesitate somewhat after this years expierence going into Berthelot Lake. I was contacted by e-mail from someone who read my original post about the Gouin and fished there this year. I promptly lost this e-mail which was very interesting and informative, would this person please e-mail me again?"
534549,Guest,2003-08-21 13:44:00,0,Just wondering on the size of the walleyes you caught. I gather from the report the quanity is outstanding. Thanks atlanta dave
534551,McQ,2003-08-21 14:48:00,615,"Dave, we got into a mess of fish that varied from 1 1/2 #s to 4 #s, I'm talking about hundreds of fish being caught amongst the seven of us over a four day period. We didn't spend any time at all working open water suspended fish. I know that at this time of year the bigger fish will come from working cranks over these suspended fish 20 - 30 feet down over 50 - 60 feet of water but we were on a real tight schedule to get the video footage done, only had two days with the camera crew and we donated another days fishing time to the conservation folks who wanted to introduce us to the elements they are involved in. Nemio is going back up over Labor Day weekend so I expect he'll have some more info on his trip in early September. I did get a big fish on while bouncing a crawler rig that managed to break my 20# fireline but suspect it was probably a large northern. My fault really, had been working a rocky breakline and didn't check my mainline for fraying, which I suspect was the reason for the breakoff."
534552,nemio,2003-08-21 15:59:00,96,"I will know next Monday when my schedule will allowed me to go back (90% sure). If I can make it it's going to be for at least 4 days full time fishing and fishing for the biggie; at that latitude they start feeding for the long winter. Sure, I will keep you update on my return."
534580,Seanik,2003-08-23 08:20:00,218,"McQ & Nemio The more I read about Gouin I am becoming convinced it's where we will fish next year. The gravel road has us oldtimers somewhat reluctant to drive it after last years expierence, but I believe we can do it. Looking at L'Oasis du Gouin's website their prices come down after July 6th, does the fishing drop off also? Their website doesn't really give a lot of information thats why all the questions. How is the food at the lodge on the American plan? Is it worth the effort to tow a boat or are the lodges boats sufficient? How secure is the vehicle parking lot across from the camp? While checking rv rental prices for this years trip we found many rv dealers and renters concerned about the many vehicles being stolen while in Quebec and some would not rent if rv was going to Quebec and especially so if vehicle was not parked next to cabin or campsite. Sorry about all the questions but I believe information and planning make for a good fishing trip. thanks"
