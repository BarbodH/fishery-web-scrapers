535270,itry,2003-10-07 20:24:00,78,On Canyon Lake near Vermillion Bay. Thinking about booking there for next year for myself and two 10 year old boys. Looking more for quantity than quality. Anyone have any experience with them? Thanks

I've considered taking a train ride as part of a fishing trip in that area of Ontario but haven't done so. I have taken the Algoma Central Railway to a lodge on Oba lake many many years ago-a nice experience. Wish you good fishing! Gary"
