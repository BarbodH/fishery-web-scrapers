535274,walli llama,2003-10-08 07:24:00,114,We are heading up there on Saturday and I'm just looking for some fishing reports from anyone who has been there recently.
535298,Guest,2003-10-10 13:31:00,0,"Just got back. We were there from the 5th thru the 9th. Started out slow. We usually fish with spinners and crawlers. Didn't do much the first day and a half. Switched to glow floaters, rattle hooks and leeches. 2-3 leeches on a hook seemed to work best. Caught about 25 slot fish, 6 fish 29"" and up. Biggest fish 14.2. Caught most of the fish around the first bridge downstream from the dam. Good luck!"

It also started out slow, but White Rock turned out to be the good spot for us. Two of our party caught the biggest walleyes of their lives, a 13.5 and a 14.9. Lindy-rigged leeches were working well for us."

535310,Bradnd,2003-10-12 08:50:00,507,"Lundman Did you pull any cranks? I'm wondering if the bottom has cleaned up yet with the cooler temps. I'll be going up on the 19th. I'd like to see the water temp cool down some more. Take care, Brad"
535311,Bradnd,2003-10-12 08:53:00,507,"Forgot to mention, is there any food items that are not allowed into Saskatchewan. Meat, vegetables, etc.?? I know you can't bring meat back into the US, but now sure about going into Canada. We'll be bringing a big pot of stew & I'd sure hate to leave it at the border for someone else to enjoy! Take care, Brad"
