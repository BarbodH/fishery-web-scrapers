I've fished Eagle for the past 8 years in June and want to try something different. Would like to fish Eagle, Lac Seul, Red Lake or possibly LOTW. Any recommendations of a year round facility on any of these lakes would be great. Also, I'd need to rent a snowmobile (or snow machine as they call them up there). Also would like a guide for a day or two. Would like to spend 5 or 6 days up there. Any recommendations on anything would be a great help. Thanks"
