535150,Todd_NE,2003-09-24 10:16:00,1330,"http://winnipeg.cbc.ca/regional/serv...b_fish20030919 Article on the launch, form your own opinion but I'm not using it and I think it is assinine they won't fix it. Funny how you talk to the media for 20 minutes and you still only get a soundbite. City of Selkirk 200 Eaton Avenue Selkirk Manitoba R1A 0W6 Phone: (204) 785-4900 Fax: (204) 482-5448 E-mail: [email protected] This is the contact info, I hope EVERY SINGLE PERSON going to Selkirk, Canadian or American, floods them with email, phone calls, and faxes to let them know how bad this is. I've now worked with the local paper and CBC - don't let the bureaucrats get away with it, they are just stalling. I think we can get them to budge! I could understand if it was expensive to fix or ice was in, but they've collected $3.50/lauch for YEARS off this ramp. If they don't continue to collect it hurts them so I don't buy the ""no money"" argument either. There are days when over 800 boats use this launch - most of them Manitoba folks - and they aren't planning to fix it. The funny part is that it is four lanes wide, they could fix two and two without shutting it down. Todd Yup, got her... oh yeah... feel that head shake!"
535153,Guest,2003-09-24 13:45:00,0,"Todd, Time to ""Let it Go"". You cant change a Tigers stripes. It would be interesting to find out where all the boat launch revenue is placed in the city budget."
535155,Todd_NE,2003-09-24 14:00:00,1330,"I feel sorry for the businesses in Selkirk that depend on the fisherman, it's their loss more than mine. I'm done with it, but I hoped it could get fixed for next year and it keeps people away from the Winnipeg :) That's the river with the scary rocks, water inhabiting monsters, flesh eating bugs, rapids, and lost fisherman - which is all actually mostly true. Todd Yup, got her... oh yeah... feel that head shake!"
535157,Guest,2003-09-24 14:55:00,0,Hopefully next year the water will be at more normal levels and the ramps won't be the problem they are with this years near record lows.
535158,Guest,2003-09-24 14:57:00,0,"Todd, Lots of us agree with you. It not only hurts the existing business but it hurts the future. The hardest thing to do in business is to get a customer back after you lost him because of poor service."
535160,Stevie B,2003-09-24 15:07:00,157,Todd why wouldn't you launch at Stu's in Lockport. We where there on the weekend. You can still launch very nicely there. I wouldn't throw the Red right out and head to Winnipeg River. Like you said the Red is alot more user friendly than the Winnipeg. And from what I'm gathering fishing on the Red has been alot better that the Winnipeg river. Fish ON!!
535161,timeout,2003-09-24 15:28:00,28,"What busineses depend on the fishermen? There is one tackle shop in Selkirk and lets face it, the best hotel the town,excuse me city has to offer is the Daerwood, not exactly a 5 star is it. The fall run last for what 4 weeks maybe and there is nothing really up yet is there? Businesses that actually do benefit from the tourist dollar such as end of main or cats on the red have their own ramps. 800 boats a day using the ramp in Selkirk? Most from manitoba, definitely but 800, and how many even fill up in Selkirk. I know that I fill up before I leave Wpg. If I go a distance, I will fill the boat up in say Lac du Bonnet, but do I put a lot of money into local retailers pockets, definitely not. I buy my tackle before I go on a trip, I do not want to get there and go gee I did not plan my trip very well and now I have to do last minute shopping at inflated local prices. Selkirk may very well call themselves a city not a town, but they are still dogged by small town thinking. There are no real accomodations in town, and I certainly wouldn't leave my new boat or any boat parked outside of lets say the gordon or the lord or the merch or meven any street in Selkirk. Just won't happen. I do not know how much revenue is generated by boat ramp fees and I do not know whether it goes into general revenue or not, but IMNSHO you are asking the local property taxpayer to subsidize other peoples leisure pursuits. If a local business (Smittys, upper crust the bars etc.) feel that they are losing out on revenue due to the decreased traffic due to the state of the ramps, then why don't they pay to get them fixed and strike a deal with the town where their customers get a pass on the ramp fee? Or how about a special levy on some of these guides who don't live in selkirk but use the facilities and have the most to say about things. They make money off of the fishery, why not contribute. Sinces the 90s the mantra has been user pay. So why not take some of that cash money or tips that they don't pay tax on and put it back into the infrastucture. Bell (the new mayor)has already heard an earful and it hasn't changed anything has it. I am not saying stay away, far from it, but I am saying in my mind issues such as dredging the channel, nets on the red and traverse, low water, rainbow smelt in the lake and lack of enforcement are having an impact on the fishery and need to be addressed before the state of the ramps."
535163,Todd_NE,2003-09-24 16:06:00,1330,"I've been up there during the times when some of the derbies have had over 800 boats, that's why that number popped in my head. I would agree that's the first two saturdays or so of October. The local taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for the ramps, I agree. There has been a user fee in place for a long time, to me the interesting thing is where all the money has already gone. Low water years are the perfect time to fix ramps. Stu has a nice ramp, but he isn't going to accomodate the 50-200 boats that are there most of early october. Most people eat, drink, and buy gas and bait if they fish there more than one day. I've stopped at the auto store, hardware, grocery store and a lot of other places too. We've dropped a lot of coin at the chevy dealer to boot on some breakdowns. I live in a state that depends on pheasant hunting. I'm just trying to imagine how our local community would ignore an issue like this and I can't see it. But as a long time chamber and economic development person I realize not everyone sees the positives tourism brings in. I'm not sure what to say about the guides, I can't see how their trailer tires ruin the ramp. 99.9% of the people coming never use a guide up there plus I would think it's better for guides if people can't use the ramp, that way the guide would have to find a way to launch. To me the simple fact remains the city has collected a ramp user fee for a long time and won't even put in 1% of what they've collected over the past five years to fix it. Seems odd to me. I've helped pour boat ramps in water, it isn't that dang hard! As to which river is better, it's anyone's guess depending on the day, week, and year. Peace, we're all after fish! Todd Yup, got her... oh yeah... feel that head shake!"
535166,Guest,2003-09-24 18:58:00,0,"We spend money on gas,grocerys,entertainment,bait and restaurants including tips during our ten days a year we spend on the Red at Selkirk. During that ten days we will spend about $2500 in Selkirk plus our lodging. With a fishing season from May to March (Cats, Walleye, Ice Fishing) the fisherman industry should be a nice little revenue base for the town of Selkirk Merchants who Im sure turn that money over in their economy eight times each year just like the rest of the world does.....I have said it before and I will say it again...Selkirk is a Diamond in the rough that needs to be polished by its own hand. P.S. I LOVE CANADA"
535197,Guest,2003-09-26 19:17:00,0,"I was there, but I don't have the problem you guys have, I wish I did, I'm in a 12ft with a 9.9 honda on it( sort sticks out). I off course have no problems launching, except waiting for the big boats to launch. Mike"
535199,mrwalleye5,2003-09-26 19:51:00,1922,Was the launch busy? How many launches were open?
535216,Guest,2003-09-27 18:17:00,0,"Wasn't busy when I got there. 3 are open and and from what I saw lots of big boats launched, when I came in I didn't see any big boats load up (but then they can stay out longer than me and my 12ft, as they have heaters, hot tubs, and saunas)."
535221,mrwalleye5,2003-09-27 21:34:00,1922,Two launches open today and are in great shape. Might be my imagination but it seems that there are more tires ( Canadian boat bumpers) attached to each dock. No worry about scratching your boat. About 15 to 20 trailers when I was there.
535225,gms,2003-09-28 08:10:00,91,"Can you elaborate on the launch, not so worried about the dock. Are there any trailer eating holes on or behind the ramp. This was even an issue earlier in the year when I was out cat fishing in the summer. Have you seen any 18'+ boats get launched?"
535227,mrwalleye5,2003-09-28 09:36:00,1922,In fact there are now signs showing where the end of the concrete pads are. Red lettering on white signs. I have a 1775 Pro V and I didn't even get close to the end and had my back rollers buried. Mind you we did have a north wind yesterday but even with that I'm positive there will be no problem.
535168,mrwalleye5,2003-09-24 19:52:00,1922,"Mike and Todd I live about one hour from Selkirk. I've been staying out of this discusion as it seems to get somewhat heated at times. Last time I was at Selkirk was about 4 weeks ago. At that time 3 out of the four launches were closed but the one that was open was fine. Possibly the water dropped more since I used it, I don't know but it was fine when I used it. The trailer drops off the end of the cement slabs but I just eased it in. Same coming out, just eased it out no problem. I even drove my boat on to the trailer. Now maybe you have a bigger boat then mine as I only have a Pro V 1775, if you do maybe you will have problems. I'm planning on going to the Red on Saturday and I am going to make a point of going to the Selkirk launch, if it's bad I'll go to the End of Main or to Stu's. I like to patronize Stu, but if everyone goes there the parking will be a nightmare and the End of Main will be the same. You will have to hitch hike to your vehicle and trailer. I'll let you know what I experienced when I get back. W5"
