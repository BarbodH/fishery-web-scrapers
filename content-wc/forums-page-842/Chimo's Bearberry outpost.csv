535247,Guest,2003-10-06 08:40:00,0,"PETER PUT A NEW BATTERY IN FOR THE WATER AND THAT FIXED THAT. WE CUT DOWN ALL THE TREES LYING OVER THE PORTAGE TO COPPER. THE BOATS AT COPPER WORKED FINE THE FIRST DAY, ON THE SECOND DAY ONE MOTOR QUIT WORKING AND NEVER WORKED AGAIN. WE HAD ONE MOTOR AT CAMP THAT WENT BAD. PETER FIXED THAT ONE. WE RAN OUT OF PROPANE IN THE BIG CABIN ON WEDNESDAY AND HAD TO USE OUR OWN WE HAD BROUGHT IN TO FRY FISH WITH. WE RAN OUT OF GAS IN THE BIG GAS TANK ON WEDNESDAY AND HAD TO SYPHONE OUT OF THE 55 GALLON TANK ( A PAIN IN THE BUTT ). THE DOOR FELL OFFF THE GAS HOUSE ON THURSDAY ( HINGE RUSTED THROUGH ) WE DID CATCH A LOT OF WALLEYE SOME LARGE ONES FOUR OR FIVE OVER 24"" ONE ALMOST 6 LBS. I WENT TO COPPER ONLY ONCE BECAUSE OF THE BAD MOTOR AND THE FISHING WAS GREAT. I NEVER WENT TO BULLOCK SOME OF THE GUYS DID BUT DIDN'T CATCH MUCH THERE. I WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK TO BEARBERRY AGAIN BUT SOME OF THE OTHER GUYS WANT TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT NEXT YEAR SO I HAVE BOOKED WITH CANADIAN FLY-IN FISHING FOR THICKETWOOD LAKE ON AUGUST 29TH. HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET BACK TOP BEARBERRY IN 2005. THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HELP."
535297,Guest,2003-10-10 08:42:00,0,DON'T TAKE MY PREVIOUS REPLY THE WRONG WAY. I AM NOT BASHING PETER. WHEN YOU GO INTO A CAMP AT THE END OF THE SEASON (THE LAST ONES IN) THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN WITH ANY OUTFITTER. I THINK PETER TRYS VERY HARD TO MAKE AND KEEP YOU HAPPY. HE HAS GREAT FISHING AND VERY RESONALBLE PRICING. ANYTIME WE ASK HIM FOR SOMETHING HE TRYS TO RESPOND.
