Not often have I seen a group of overage, overweight women full of alcohol playing a very animated game of bocci ball at 7:00 AM and having the time of their lives. The crowning touch is the easter egg inspired spandex pants. Night fishing seems to be best for bigger 'eyes. Besides, you cannot sleep for noise anyway. All told, nice people run it, fishing is OK but it is a little over populated."
534996,Guest,2003-09-15 19:55:00,0,I have been told there is a Lodge on Northen Light Lake which is just east of Saganaga Lake -west of Thunder Bay. Is anyone familar with the name of a lodge on this lake? Possibly a telephone number.If so-any comments about the fishing on Northen Light as well? Many thanks for the assistance.
535005,eyewitness,2003-09-15 22:49:00,680,"It is Northern Light Lake Resort. Phone # is (807) 933-5025. Just make sure to bring yourself a wash brush that hooks up to a hose so you can wash your boat/truck if it's raining when you drive in. The road is great but the slick mud residue that covers your rig will not just wash off with a spray hose and the longer you leave it dry, the harder it is to get off. They put calcium silicate down on the roads there to keep the dust down and it sticks to everything when it rains. Trust me on this one.....They do have a hose to use to wash down with if need be, but the brush that's there is usually shot and you will just end up scratching your paint. Not trying to scare you, just trying to prepare you...:) Have fun! The fishing there is great!"

535013,bellbuoy,2003-09-16 14:15:00,490,"Roger, Thanks for the wbsite address. I've been here a couple of times. Watch out for the road, it has a lot of logging truck traffic on it. In fact, the lodge owner's dad was hit head on some years ago. Bellbuoy"
535027,Guest,2003-09-17 09:02:00,0,What about the fishing????? TGG
535030,Mahumba,2003-09-17 09:38:00,345,"The lake has smallies, walleye, pike and lake trout in it. I have been there a few times. Just watch out for shallow reefs that pop outta no where! Fishing is pretty good. Roger Mayer."
535058,Guest,2003-09-19 09:50:00,0,Thank you for this information. I called them and looked up their website. I was surprised that their campground was so large with 120 sites. Does this make fishing on the lake crowded like fishing on Minnesota lakes or is it still similar to other Canadain experiences? Thanks again-Greg

535062,Mahumba,2003-09-19 13:42:00,345,The lake has many many back bays and inlets you could get lost there. If the lodge has a map of the lake go to the rapids that flow into Wantelto Lake. There is great walleye pike and smallie action there. If you walk down stream there will be a water fall. Try there also. It could be tricky if you don't know the way. Make sure you have a map before you try to get there. The only people you may see are ones you are passing by in a boat. Roger Mayer.
