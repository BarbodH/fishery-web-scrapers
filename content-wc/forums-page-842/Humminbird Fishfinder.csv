I purchased one in June of this year and don't seem to be having any luck with it. Not sure if I don't know how to set it up or what. Since I have had it I have never marked any fish solid fish just the outlined ones, and the depth keeps changing on me when I'm anchored in on spot (clam and no other boats traffic) Does it sound like I have a bad one or do I need to change some of the settings. Any information would help. Thanks in advance Born to Fish But Forced To Work"

535282,Guest,2003-10-08 17:26:00,0,When you say the depth is changing...how much? More than a foot? Less than that probably is the boat rising and falling with the waves (however slight). It may change more than that if it is rough.
