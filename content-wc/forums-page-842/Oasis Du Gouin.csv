I want to take my wife and daughter on this trip, so we are think of the American plan. how do you rate the meals? My wife would like to if there is an indoor toilet? how are the cottages or the lodge you stay in? most of all how is the fishing last week of June and the first week of july? for walleye and pike? Thanks for all your help and imfo. on this vacation 2004 June."
535190,McQ,2003-09-26 13:41:00,615,The cabins have indoor toilets but the showers are in the lodge. The rooms in the lodge have complete facilities. You should enquire of the lodge for specific info http://www.fishing-quebec.com or call (Bernard or Jackie) (800) 959-7453 Meals are home style with a flourish and very satisfying. I didn't lose any weight when I was there. The fishing at that time of the year is extremely good. Fish still haven't concentrated on open water locations yet.

535210,McQ,2003-09-27 16:50:00,615,"Dave, most of the operators shut down in early September. Late August fishing is great, structure fishing along rock edges and sand bars will produce a good bite. Open water tactics such as long lining or boards are often overlooked. Water temps are still high - you'll find the bite at 35' during the day and moving progressively shallower into the evening. Here's the official outfitters site www.fpq.com , do a little surfing for those who operate into September. I would suggest areas A,B, and D. A search here on WC should give you a lot of info too."
