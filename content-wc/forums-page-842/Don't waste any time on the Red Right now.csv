We managed 1 17"" walleye for the 3 of us during this trip. Caught a couple other greenbacks that were 12""-14"" and all the baby sauger you can reel in. Biggest fish we saw out of a few hundred boats was about 2 pounds. Did hear a fish story a one 7 pounder caught somewhere, but who know. Tried jigging and running lots of cranks. Weather was nice, people were great, but I can't even believe I wasted my time and money. I passed up a lot of nice Mille Lacs walleye this weekend to go catch baby sauger. Let me tell you that when your fishing the river and the fish aren't in it isn't too exciting! Don't make my mistake, I deffinetly would not recommend going untill some solid reports start comming in."

One group to Selkirk the other to Pine Falls. The Selkirk group did absolutely horrible, all little sauger and two small greenbacks. The guy that went to Pinefalls basically did the same. He did catch one 7 pound greenback. The Selkirk ramp was not real good but useable. Definetly not a good time to go."
