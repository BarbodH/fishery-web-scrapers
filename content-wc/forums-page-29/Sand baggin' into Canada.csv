6685756,djglover7,2022-09-12 10:19:00,54,As a current Texan (but have lived in lots of snow elsewhere)...95% of the drivers south of Dallas totally lose it if any white stuff hits the road. Ice? OMG it's the end of the world.
6685774,proguidedream,2022-09-12 10:47:00,345,if it snows ill send you a $10 rapala
6685970,djglover7,2022-09-13 08:04:00,54,"Wow, I see a $10 Rapala in my future!The area we are heading into for late Sep. has provided everything from warm/sunny to rain/sleet/snow. Great time of year."
6685994,floorguynate,2022-09-13 09:16:00,22,"There's plenty of rocks in canada, skip the sand bags and throw rocks in the back if needed"
6686092,runuts2,2022-09-13 17:41:00,25,That whole thread was weird.
6685352,Eckohlt,2022-09-10 08:40:00,3685,Where you headed in Ontario??hunting or fishing or both?
6685360,djglover7,2022-09-10 09:30:00,54,Texas to Duluth to Wawa to Little Miss.It will be 4000 miles when all traveled.
6685368,camp chef,2022-09-10 09:49:00,915,Maybe I am too cautious but I would just put on new tires.
6685370,walleyecheek,2022-09-10 10:49:00,2231,4000 miles on bald tires ? Is this a joke ?
6685404,djglover7,2022-09-10 13:44:00,54,Yes it was failed attempt at humor.Y'All hit on that like a Northern swallowing my $10 Rapala.
6685406,djglover7,2022-09-10 13:45:00,54,The 4000 is true.
6685408,walleyecheek,2022-09-10 14:33:00,2231,I didn't hit on S#[+......lol.
6685542,slick2010,2022-09-11 08:20:00,22,I would just bring empty bags I believe Canada has sand now
6685546,Thunder man,2022-09-11 08:38:00,27,4000 miles on bald tires and bringing sand bags for traction?Is it April 1 today?
6685548,Huntindave,2022-09-11 08:47:00,2194,Ditto
6685126,djglover7,2022-09-09 09:39:00,54,"All,We will be crossing into Canada at Pigeon Creek on 24 Sep. 2022.We want to use sand bags for weight/traction in the back of the truck.Is there any bizarre Canadian law about bringing sand across (similar to other organics)?D in Texas"
6685134,Eckohlt,2022-09-09 09:55:00,3685,Don't ya have 4 wheel drive??
6685138,djglover7,2022-09-09 10:00:00,54,No.2WD and bald tires.What could go wrong?
6685144,Jesse-WI,2022-09-09 10:20:00,534,"given the restriction on soil, it would need to be 100% clean as a starting point IMO"
6685146,djglover7,2022-09-09 10:32:00,54,4 bags of playground sand from Home Depot.
6685166,prov1800,2022-09-09 11:01:00,5010,Just bring up a f150 and you wint need extra weight.
6685174,walleyecheek,2022-09-09 11:29:00,2231,"Why , are they expecting snow ?.....LOL.LOL.LOL.LOL.LOL"
6685178,proguidedream,2022-09-09 11:39:00,345,"dont quite understand , are you pulling a boat ? are you bringing no gear or coolers in the box that add a tad of weight ? there should not be snow end of september , if there is it will be melting off the ground pretty quick end of september. no canadian truck will be in 4x4 on the highway unless it is a blizzard. and sand bags probably wont help if by chance the road is frozen and icey. you should be more concerned about bald tires if you are headed off the pavement on to crushed granite roads. those are pretty harsh on bad rubber."
6685348,JAY221,2022-09-10 08:29:00,877,"My guess would be that it is not allowed as sand is a form of soil and you couldn't even take night crawlers in U.S. dirt back in the good old days. You will need to buy your sand across the border. Later, Jay"
6685350,djglover7,2022-09-10 08:34:00,54,"The owner of the truck wants to load them (not me,... but his call). The truck will be loaded to the hilt so I do not think there is an issue.I need to inform and suggest we don't need them."
