6685420,DJSchmitz,2022-09-10 15:18:00,2,"I've got a fly-in trip out of Red Lake scheduled for 8:00 AM Monday, and the two bait shops I called in Red Lake don't have leeches available. I'll be crossing the border around midnight, through Dryden about 3:00 AM, so I'm not sure what my options are if they aren't available in Red Lake. It's a private cabin, so I can't rely on an outfitter to source them. Anyone have a recommendation? I'm wondering if there are 24-hour gas stations that carry them by the lb? Or vending machines? I'd even pay in advance if anyone knows a bait guy that can leave them off the 502 for overnight pickup. Thanks in advance."
6685422,prov1800,2022-09-10 15:35:00,5010,Leeches aren't a big thing right now.water getting colder and they'll roll up in a ball.Minnows are hot all season and are right now to.Buy them by the half gallon or gallon and have them bagged up at one Clark's bait shops.

6685432,pjshorthorn,2022-09-10 16:09:00,5654,Buy some artificial leeches. I've used them and they work. They hold up pretty well too. PjShorthorn

6685504,7 Mag,2022-09-11 05:06:00,1887,I sure enjoy the wildlife especially the walleye’s!

6685660,DJSchmitz,2022-09-11 21:59:00,2,"Thanks all. We’ve mainly used minnows but hard to keep alive all week, especially in warm water temps. Good to know crawlers are effective and will check into artificials.We take the 502 slow with an extra set of eyes on the road. Thanks for the reminder."
