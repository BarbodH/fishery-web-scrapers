We still caught plenty of big pike, and walleyes whenever we wanted. If you wanted to fish for walleye all day I cannot even express how productive some areas are. 100 fish in a day would be a breeze. In our never ending search for trophy pike, one day we hit up a bay that is a known spawning area for pike. I never caught so many 24 to 28"" pike in one day in my life. Not a single trophy that day, but we caught so many pike and walleye it was crazy. I am still regretting not fishing that area a bit differently than we did. I know there must have been some big girls nearby. Such a great lake. Highly recommended. Travel can be a bit onerous depending on your starting point, but well worth it."

Massive lake with past favorable reports. We have done a fair amount of due dill on this lake but welcome any hands on insight. Thank you, John"
6679354,adempsey2.0,2022-08-13 22:09:00,611,Been 2x before and will be there August 27th. Walleye are everywhere. Where are you staying?
6679356,Jtmwalleye,2022-08-14 03:11:00,16,We are staying at the small cabin down from the main camp.
6679392,Larry S,2022-08-14 07:46:00,665,"I stayed at smaller cabin the first year 2007 it opened up. Now stay at Pickle Lake outposts on the Northwest of Caribou A longer drive(To Pickle lake) to get there, But around $1000 Cheaper. Have gone there 4 times 2017.18, 19, 22. lots of Walleyes and some big pike Larry Schroeder Henderson, Nevada"
6679462,phishfearme,2022-08-14 14:19:00,1242,"i posted 3 trip reports on this lake - sounds like you've already dug them up. we were there for our 5th trip (with fellow charter member LarryS) this past late June/early July and the walleye fishing was exactly as in our previous late spring trips - fantastic, just find 8-9 ft of water near deeper water and the fish were there and accommodating. we pretty much only used 3in twister tails on 1/4ounce jig - no live bait. and our experience with not being able to catch trophy walleye at N Caribou continued - largest this trip was 24 inches and our largest ever is 25in. I'm certain trophy walleye are there but not many from our experience - and we have caught quite a few thousand walleyes over the years. we also did a trip last August - right after the border opened - and were quite disappointed in the catching this time of year. the strategy we used in june/july just didn't work well at all - so we tried numerous changes (deeper, troll different lures over different structures) but just couldn't find a good combo. hope you have better luck. our results for pike this past trip were pretty much the same as previous trips - quite a few nice pike but no trophies - 37 was the largest this past trip and nothing else over 30. Although i have to admit we spent very little time trolling/casting for pike - but focus on the cabbage (pike weed) bays and you should do ok. enjoy your trip and please post a report. phish"
6679492,Carnhzkr,2022-08-14 16:47:00,964,"I stayed at Caribou Lake Lodge five or six years ago, and it was about the same time of year you're there. I think it was the second to last week they were open, mid-August. It took my dad and me a couple of days to zero in on a pattern, but when we did, it was lights out. You can see that this lake was carved out by a glacier that moved SW across the landscape. There are many long points and sand ridges that continue into the lake on this diagonal pattern. I found the walleyes were stacked along these ridges. I killed them with 1/4 or 3/8 oz jigs and any plastic along these ridges. There were also quite a few weed beds that held fish too."
6679524,Jtmwalleye,2022-08-15 02:18:00,16,"Thanks all. I will be sure to post a report upon our return. It will be our 1st trip in late August so it should be interesting. We normally head up in mid June to early July in Northern Ontario and/or Quebec. Many thanks, John"
6680180,Freytown,2022-08-18 08:29:00,770,"phish, that was the most eyes I ever caught in over 40 years. Thanks for the invite. FT"
6680296,phishfearme,2022-08-18 17:35:00,1242,I neglected to mention that Joe P (Freytown) from NE PA joined the group this year. My bad. Joe and i went out one morning after breakfast and came back to the cabin in time for lunch and caught just shy of 100 walleyes. impressive enough but the average size was just shy of 19inches. The average size in this lake is truly incredible (a 19 incher up this far north is about 12-15 years old) - yet we have been unable to catch a real trophy walleye here - very confusing. looking forward to hearing how jtmwalleye does on this incredible lake. phish
