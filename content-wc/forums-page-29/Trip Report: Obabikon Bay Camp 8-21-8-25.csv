6683444,yfishy,2022-09-01 09:10:00,1,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at Obabikon Bay Camp for a 3 day fishing trip recently. It was our first experience at a fishing lodge and in the spirit of giving back to the community that helped me find Obabikon, I thought I'd write a brief trip report. In short, it was everything we hoped for and more. Jared runs a first-rate operation and he and his team personify hospitality. The fishing was great, but it was really everything else -- the generously portioned and delicious meals by Chef Rick, the shore lunches, the well-maintained cabins, Henli the Island Dog (who accompanied us during two morning walleye runs), and the peaceful solitude that can only be found on a remote, private island in the middle of LOTWs that made our trip unforgettable. By the end of our time there, we felt like family. As for the fishing, it was excellent. Water levels were elevated, but the lake was calm throughout.*We were fortunate to have Jared himself guide us for two days and it is clear he knows the lake like the back of his hand. He worked his butt off to put us on fish -- if we didn't get a bite within 15 minutes, it was lines up and off to another hotspot. We were on the water by 8am each morning and within an hour had limits of walleye jigging. I have no doubt we would have had 100+ days but we wanted to cast, and I was keen to catch my first musky. To that end, Jared helped me land a 48-incher on a bucktail. My wife, who had little fishing experience before the trip, caught countless smallmouth / pike casting a yellow spinnerbait and to my surprise, I did as well on my bucktail. I can't recommend Obabikon enough - we will certainly be back."

It was an absolute pleasure to have you both! Everytime I guide now, Henley thinks she gets to come, she gives me her absolute best pouty face."
6684692,kona77,2022-09-07 15:49:00,236,Great report and glad you and your wife had a great 1st experience in Canada. A great outfitter and services sure adds to the experience and it looks like Obabikon's Camp fits that criteria. Jared- As a frequent member of this forum/thread I have always appreciated your feedback from the Outfitter perspective on a number of threads/discussion points. Hope you and many other outfitters can continue to operate and provide these great Canadian opportunities to the folks on this thread.
