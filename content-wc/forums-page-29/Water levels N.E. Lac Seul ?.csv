6684196,jimirjr,2022-09-05 08:03:00,1149,"WOW ! Thats a TON of extra water... How was the bite? MY WEATHER CHANNEL still shows rain every day... Hope not, but it is what it is...."
6684204,Eckohlt,2022-09-05 08:23:00,3685,"That weather channel app showing rain everyday will change I assure you,on all my trips I look at the long range forecast and shows rain everyday,it will change!!"
6684388,eyecatcher1,2022-09-06 05:49:00,323,"The bite was fantastic like always. We caught a lot of slots and overs this trip too. Biggest was 26"". Lots of 30+ inch pike too. Biggest was 40"". The water temp was 68 and the fish were on mid-lake humps. Usually 22-25 feet deep. We did get some as deep as 30 feet. Good luck and have fun!"
6684396,Skywagon,2022-09-06 06:29:00,1106,"I just looked at the weather channel again for Sioux Lookout, the weather still looks good for when you will be here except Thursday, possibly Friday. Don't worry about the %, 40% and less is nothing on the Weather Channel, it is always like that, seldom you ever see a 0%. Look at the 24 hr rain amounts, those are the important numbers. Your week looks better than most have been all summer."

6683944,Stringbean,2022-09-03 18:57:00,279,I looked at the water level on Lac Seul on www.lwcb.ca to see that the reservoir pool is just about normal for this time of year. I also looked at Lake St. Joseph to see that the flood gates are open and that water is being diverted to lac Seul instead of the Albany River.
