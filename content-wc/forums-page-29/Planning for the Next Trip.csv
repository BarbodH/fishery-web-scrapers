6685582,Old Timer,2022-09-11 13:02:00,255,"Many posters have recommended their go-to outposts. For me, all outposts are pretty much the same they cost $1,500-$1,750 and produce plenty of slicers. And, of course, you have to schlep the entire program. They usually require a party of four or more. For the same amount of money (or less) you can go to any number of drive-in, American Plan camps with guides on LOTW. You'll catch plenty of fish without all the work. If you want a first-rate, American Plan fly-in camp you might look at Sabourin Lake Lodge that operates out of Winnipeg. It's a straight shot up from Fargo, North Dakota. You won't be disappointed."

6627038,prov1800,2022-01-22 08:22:00,5010,Our hard water season is longer than the soft version.Normally end of November beginning of December we might have good ice and then basically have to wait at least till first week of May to see some open water.Last year was a exception having been able to fish in a boat on the last day of the walleye season.Clarks had a Kodiak at the dock and I used it in exact spot where ice shacks were.Walleyes were still there.April 15 th.

I try to keep busy hiking, snowshoeing and have even been dipping my toe into ice fishing but still summer calls Most years I use the time to get ready for upcoming trips This year I have a busy slate, two canoe trips, a fly in plus whatever cottage fishing comes my way here's a few of the things I do to ensure I am ready and kill some time I am sure there are others things I am not doing and I am intrigued to hear what others do to get ready https://www.northernjacks.com/post/prepping-for-your-big-trip Thanks Andrew"
6626612,Laketripper,2022-01-20 18:52:00,103,"I'll bite....what is shoulder season? I used to do a fair bit of canoe tripping and just as much enjoyable effort went into the planning as doing the adventure itself..pouring over maps,meal planning etc. The old paddle doesn't get dipped quite as much nowadays as it used to...careful with that one folks."
6626618,btyreprich,2022-01-20 19:37:00,1067,I wasn't able to click on the link to your fishing trip prep list. I too review and revise the trip check list primarily on meals / groceries. This year it's likely to be just my buddy and I as our sons are busy with jobs. This means far less food to buy and likely smaller dinners. We are both turning 65 years old this year and just don't eat the large dinners like we used to. The other list on items to bring up might change a bit as my buddy just bought a boat which we will use this year.
6626666,gordy28,2022-01-21 06:10:00,437,"So for me shoulder season is the slow time in between the seasons you love - so winter is a big shoulder season for me lol I hear you - we meet a lot for our trips to look at maps (Kevin Callan calls it map porn) think about meals, gear we wanted or didnt need and so on - great excuse to get together and keep the ecitement up for coming trips Thanks Andrew"
6626688,Eckohlt,2022-01-21 07:13:00,3685,"For me I lift weights all winter,coz I'm going after big fish and I mean really big fish and I want to be ready for them,that's how I get ready."
6626770,NM_Trout,2022-01-21 10:26:00,1094,"I'm right there with you. Just yesterday I was looking through video and pictures of a trip from 2017 with my daughter, and grabbing the video clips that I want to put into a summary video. I probably shouldn't, as it is just putting gas on an already raging I-need-to-go-fishing sentiment. I have a Cabelas online shopping cart full of new stuff I want to try. I'm buying hardware to build up inline spinners for pike. I tie up streamers for pike and jigs for walleye, and I go through feathers faster than if I were making pillows. Just this morning checking flight confirmation #s and adding in KTN numbers for the domestic part of the travel. We usually pack light for our outpost trips. in 2013, my brother and I took a lot of dehydrated food, very little clothing, and only felt sleeping bag liners along with a rod tube and one small duffel of tackle. We took it as a compliment when the pilot told us to get the rest of our stuff on the dock and it was already all there. I won't be doing that this year :-) I'm planning on more canned goods, fresh food, and bringing technology for bathymetric charting. Heck.. given the look of the pile of gear on my pool table, I might even be paying for more weight..LoL."
6626892,Walleye2242,2022-01-21 15:22:00,263,"I can relate to long trip planning and I miss it and i also..do not miss it. Long ago when a huge group of us went...10 to 15 guys...the planning was extensive and constant. I loved it. Meal planning, hotels, stops along the way, fishing techniques. Was a huge deal. Now...2 of us go...my and my buddy. While we still plan...its not a big deal. this past year...i decided to go on a tuesday night in late sept and left friday morning. Somebody on here said i would need a prayer to make it...no worries and made it easy. Buy all our food in red lake. Booze...red lake. Think we packed in about 30 minutes. So...I love the past planning trips but also love how simple it can be done now. Our food menu...i made a pot of chili on night 1...every night we had fish and a bowl of chili. It was as easy as that and we dont care. I do miss the old days as well though."
6626996,kettyspanky,2022-01-22 05:53:00,271,"I'm also getting the itch to start planning. I got my sons picture taken for his passport yesterday. Also called our resort to confirm dates. I've been going thru pictures with my son and getting him pumped to tag along this year. Even getting some of the menu figured out. I know our trip is 6 months away, but I am always trying to plan ahead and be ready for the next trip. I'm glad to see I'm not the only the one thinking about fishing in canada 2022."
6627014,prov1800,2022-01-22 07:17:00,5010,Fun to plan trips.Even though I live here iam not so much into planning but waiting.Get to ice fish throughout the winter and do love that but iam always looking forward to seeing some ice melting away from the shoreline.Will still have to wait about 2 1/2 months but then we will already have much warmer weather.Best fishing happens toward ice out.Always something to look forward to.
6627030,Eckohlt,2022-01-22 08:00:00,3685,"You don't have wait long in between hard n soft water,the biggest worry you have john is wearing out the frying pan."
