6686208,eyecatcher1,2022-09-14 15:56:00,323,I was asked about those.
6686210,walleyecheek,2022-09-14 16:19:00,2231,I be more worried about Radioactive material being dumped !
6686222,Eckohlt,2022-09-14 17:11:00,3685,Be easier to find the fish if there glowing bright green!!
6686230,prov1800,2022-09-14 18:36:00,5010,Just turn on down scan they glow then
6684880,proguidedream,2022-09-08 12:59:00,345,"pure breast no bone, no feathers. to me is processed. and you CANNOT take it back! most canadian guides have already sent notices to guests warning them of this already.https://www.themeateater.com/hunt/wa...22-for-hunters"
6684926,Lmbkiller,2022-09-08 16:09:00,639,"Just because u think that's processed doesn't mean it is to the many that are in charge. And if processed to the usda is the version u mention, that violates bird identification rules anyways. So instead of coming up with their rule 2 days after the waterfowl opener in Canada, they could've just said no birds can be brought back, period, days before or months before sept 1. Which is also dumb because the last I checked birds have wings and fly places"
6685396,GeoFish,2022-09-10 13:25:00,70,On Aug 11th I had chicken and eggs. I got the dreaded chicken ticket. Now I am a chicken smuggler. I had to go back to the US and dispose of my illegal contraband.
6685398,prov1800,2022-09-10 13:31:00,5010,Not to hard to buy that stuff in Canada like most guys are doing.We do have stores.
6685918,Mike311,2022-09-12 21:11:00,40,Is the dog food restrictions still a thing? 20 plus years ago my wife and I along with her little dog took off for Canada and low and behold forgot the dog food. Scrambled to find a store in Virginia that carried the special food the dog needed. Surprise surprise Canada didn’t allow dog food to pass through. Border agent instructed us to carry on with our trip but that we needed to pitch the dog food in the dumpster at the end of the lot as we passed…
6685922,walleyecheek,2022-09-13 04:35:00,2231,"They do, and have some VERY odd rules and restrictions up there ! You ever see the Ontario fishing Regulations phone book ? (As thick as one !)"
6686014,Wawajake,2022-09-13 11:01:00,413,"....Perhaps that's why Ontario has the great fishing it does, and considering the size of Ontario and number of lakes, the book of regulations has a great variety of types of lake environments to cover."
6686018,walleyecheek,2022-09-13 11:22:00,2231,Ontario fishing has absolutely nothing to do with whether i bring potatoes and dog food in !...........LOL.
6686176,eyecatcher1,2022-09-14 11:45:00,323,"I've taken my dog on my last three trips to Ontario and have never even been asked to see his shot records. Wasn't asked about his food either. The most recent trip was August 27, 2022."
6686196,Eckohlt,2022-09-14 14:14:00,3685,There more worried about crawlers n minnows!!
6684620,proguidedream,2022-09-07 08:24:00,345,they just banned taking back processed game birds .. yes that is right. if you come waterfowl hunt in canada you cannot take back the meat that flies itself over the border twice a year !
6684624,valley366,2022-09-07 08:41:00,193,Crossed in Fort Frances in June and again in August. Was asked going both directions. There are multiple signs in various colors warning of the ban. I actually laughed with the toll booth operator about the various color posters. She said that some people see certain colors better than others so they have multiple.I also did see people both times walking things back across the border dumping items on the US side.
6684648,Lmbkiller,2022-09-07 10:46:00,639,"Unless something has changed since last fri proguide, u are incorrect, UNPROCESSED birds aren't allowed to cross back into states"
6684654,walleyecheek,2022-09-07 11:20:00,2231,So pluck the feathers off ! Your good to go ???
6684656,walleyecheek,2022-09-07 11:21:00,2231,They're getting goofier by the day up there !!!
6684664,Eckohlt,2022-09-07 11:45:00,3685,The birds or the people???
6684666,Lmbkiller,2022-09-07 11:46:00,639,Not goin down the processed vs unprocessed rabbit hole argument. Not sure who u think it is that's restricting bird import but it's the USDA. No hunter harvested birds shot in Canada can cross into US without being processed as of last Friday
6684734,lotsoffish1,2022-09-07 19:17:00,49,I never heard of the sausage but i did hear of duck butter
6684764,Juls,2022-09-08 02:57:00,13414,"And, what it it you heard? What is ""Duck Butter""?"
6684790,Bill Krejca,2022-09-08 07:33:00,6107,"Just for us fowl uneducated folk: Define ""Processed"". Thanks Bill"
6684518,lotsoffish1,2022-09-06 17:19:00,49,planning on crossing at Pigeon river Saturday Have the border guards ask anyone about eggs and poultry products this summer? According to the Canada website its still prohibited .Thank you in advance for your reply
6684526,7 Mag,2022-09-06 17:50:00,1887,I was asked a week ago at FF.
6684536,birddogger,2022-09-06 19:03:00,43,I was asked last Thursday going in to Canada if I had eggs or chicken. Coming back into USA today was asked if I had eggs
6684552,RichA$1970,2022-09-06 21:03:00,1159,I’m crossing there Saturday at 0330 so I’ll let you know
6684558,rather-be-fishin,2022-09-06 22:46:00,429,Was in Canada 8/26 to 9/2 & crossed at Fort Fort Frances & yes they asked if we had any eggs & poultry. Still can not bring it in! RBF
6684566,kettyspanky,2022-09-07 04:04:00,271,"Yes they are going to ask you. If you want and poultry products, get them up there."
6684574,RichA$1970,2022-09-07 05:05:00,1159,Watch out for Duck Sausage
6684596,icefisher,2022-09-07 06:22:00,25,"We crossed at Pembina on August 5th and weren't asked about eggs or poultry. Weren't asked about potatoes either, which we had 12lbs of (didn't know they were prohibited at the time). Very easy crossing, but they did inspect our boat, checking to make sure live wells and bait wells were dry and all plugs were out. Took maybe 5 minutes and they were very friendly."
6684600,eyecatcher1,2022-09-07 06:52:00,323,We crossed in FF August and were asked about eggs and chicken. Ends up that eggs were $1.00 a dozen less in Canada anyway. Plus the exchange rate.
6684614,JDP,2022-09-07 08:07:00,1457,"I wasn't asked.But, I did see a guy walking back over the bridge to the U.S. with a carton of eggs and what looked like a container of nightcrawlers a few weeks ago."
