6686204,X-monarch,2022-09-14 15:24:00,52,"Thats right Gord. It is currently being stored above ground , at least at the Bruce it is."
6686214,walleyecheek,2022-09-14 16:36:00,2231,Oh I'm sure the kids will wanna hang around now !.............LOL. I'd be on the first road outta there !
6686098,Wawajake,2022-09-13 17:47:00,413,"As I have stated before, exaggeration and the sky is falling has been the mantra for a few about the risks about the nuclear waste being considered.....meanwhile it has actually been a long well thought out process of around 20 yrs to find safest containers and safest hard rock mine location. NO WATERSHEDS WILL BE PUT AT RISK. ..."
6686138,Skywagon,2022-09-14 04:13:00,1106,"That is a bet I would gladly lose, however I would not wish the risk of that radioactive plague on you either. They will be better solutions in the future, the technology just needs to catch up."
6686150,Thunder man,2022-09-14 08:06:00,27,"the instant the word went out of the nuke storage in the area, local businesses were sold INSTANTLY! East Indian own the whole area at the moment! I know an insider that stated ignace was named right off the hop!Public consultation was just to make it official.And yes, as stated before, you can be assured that the containers are extremely secure as this is not the first rodeo, nuclear waste storage has been going on for years!"
6686162,v-bay gord,2022-09-14 08:43:00,3168,"I'm not comfortable with spent fuel being stored in a wharehouse near the most populated center of North America and on the biggest watershed. Researching a safer way to deal with this seems to make sense.....unless, of course, you believe a building above ground is the way to go. Is it waste or is it spent fuel? Is it a dump or is it a storage vault? What part of the discussion is based on science or just based on fear? Do I want the storage of spent fuel to occur in Sunset Country....not really."
6686166,X-monarch,2022-09-14 08:56:00,52,"I guess we will just have to wait and see eh? I live 10 miles from the proposed South Bruce site and 30 miles from Bruce Power so I am keeping a ""ear"" on things as well. Anyway, back to our regularly scheduled program, gas is dropping a bit . Down to 1.44 downtown ."
6686168,prov1800,2022-09-14 08:57:00,5010,Diffenatly don't need the Easts garbage here.The transportation part is ridiculous.Dont think politicians should have any say in this.Put it to a vote in the area and see what the outcome will be.
6686170,v-bay gord,2022-09-14 09:39:00,3168,"Radioactive waste has already been transported from Pinawa, MB to Chalk River......right through VBay on the highway. Just another truck carrying hazardous materials. Gas prices?......expensive gas is better than using oars on your 20 foot Ranger......"
6686172,prov1800,2022-09-14 10:20:00,5010,When I lived near pinawa I understood most of everything had been buried on sight.Long time ago.Did not know they transported any of it.Either way highways were a lot safer then than now.If you can afford a ranger you can afford the gas.
6686194,Thunder man,2022-09-14 14:08:00,27,"V-bay gord: stored above ground in a wharehouse?I don’t know where you get your information from!&#x1f926;&#x1f3fb;I’m sure nobody wants it in their backyard, although it’s a mixed bag in the ignace area.My neighbor has a camp there, and says it’s 50/50Some are welcoming the idea as the area has seen no new industry in years, drive thru and it’s a boarded up shantytown!Older generation are just that, nothing new for the kids to hang around for.It’ll create many new jobs and investments in the area.Cancel the project and say lavie to the area!"
6686200,v-bay gord,2022-09-14 14:24:00,3168,"I'm talking about current storage of spent fuel, not the proposed storage. Perhaps ""wharehouse"" is misleading. It's currently stored above ground in temporary storage facilities associated with existing nuclear generating stations."
6685532,X-monarch,2022-09-11 07:41:00,52,Yes Sir. It was nice talking to you 3 that day.
6685606,Skywagon,2022-09-11 16:33:00,1106,"You were still 1500 km from home when you stopped by to visit, I hope gas got cheaper along the way. Check out our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/NoNuclearWasteInNWO for a picture of the final product."
6685644,X-monarch,2022-09-11 19:16:00,52,"Ya Sky, we were on our final 1500 km of our total of 21000 km. Cheapest was in Alberta. Total cost of gas was 5500 CDN. Sure hope to get up your way again, beautiful country! Glen. p.s. you missed a T at the end of our name. LOL!!!"
6685666,Skywagon,2022-09-12 04:10:00,1106,Sorry about that! Fixed it.
6685794,proguidedream,2022-09-12 11:51:00,345,arent they activally drilling in NWO to bury nuc waste deep in the rock ?
6685820,Skywagon,2022-09-12 13:18:00,1106,There is an experimental high-level nuclear waste dump proposed for between Dryden and Ignace (right in the middle of sunset Country). They want to haul all of Canada's nuclear waste here from 1500 miles away because the population in eastern Canada do not want the risk of having down there where it is made. This dump is experimental and has never successfully been done before in the world. It makes no sense to bring highly radioactive material and dump it one of the most pristine places in the world to possibly pollute the second largest watershed in all of Canada. Water systems that run through Lac Seul and Lake of the Woods among others are all downstream and could be affected if there was a leak or incident.
6686052,Thunder man,2022-09-13 14:29:00,27,Gas today in Thunder Bay at the rez is 128 a litre some of the cheapest in Canada Why do people buy from the big companies?
6686058,walleyecheek,2022-09-13 15:32:00,2231,Alot of places probably be goin up for sale ? Who would buy though ?
6686090,Skywagon,2022-09-13 17:09:00,1106,"Has there been a time when you said you were glad not to be young? If this comes to be it will be one of those times for me. A country that has been obsessed with Covid is willing to throw Northwest Ontario out with the bath water, we don't matter."
6686094,X-monarch,2022-09-13 17:41:00,52,"Sky, wanna make a friendly wager? Perhaps a box of beer? 24 of course. I say the crap will be buried here. Why? Because there are a lot of people that actually want it here if you can believe that! It's all about the money for a lot of people. And besides , the crap is made here, why should you Guys have to take it. They sure are throwing the money around aren't they! Take care."
6685150,djglover7,2022-09-09 10:40:00,54,Better at Grand Portage or Rydens at Pigeon River?
6685162,prov1800,2022-09-09 10:59:00,5010,How much there
6685192,proguidedream,2022-09-09 12:21:00,345,https://www.gasbuddy.com/
6685202,djglover7,2022-09-09 12:54:00,54,Gasbuddy not posting for those.
6685252,kettyspanky,2022-09-09 17:41:00,271,"At Grand Portage, you used to get a small discount if you paid cash. We did in july anyway. My vote would be Grand Portage."
6685254,HeHooksHimself,2022-09-09 17:42:00,725,Was 389.9 when we went through last week. Gas in Canada was 179.0 (litre) everywhere we went. Trudeau must be regulating prices. Hooks
6685260,prov1800,2022-09-09 18:19:00,5010,"1.52 ltr at the rez today in Eagle River,Ont."
6685318,djglover7,2022-09-10 06:55:00,54,$1.79 ltr CDN = $5.25 gal. USD Ouch!In the past we have always filled up in Grand Portage (GP) and carried 10 gal.The small truck can make it to Wawa and back to GP on that fuel load (~32 gal.)
6685362,X-monarch,2022-09-10 09:31:00,52,"I guess you gotta blame someone. Coming through B.C., N.W.T , Yukon, and back to Ontario in the last few weeks it varied from 1.39 up to 2.70. **** Justin! LOL!!!"
6685520,Skywagon,2022-09-11 06:45:00,1106,By any chance were you the one that stopped along the TransCanada to talk to some people putting up an informational sign?
