Been looking at the map and Grace isn't that big and layed out pretty nice to escape the winds.weather looks good on long range
6685322,Eckohlt,2022-09-10 07:19:00,3685,"Is Karla going??always nice to catch fish off the dock,don't have to wry about dragging them around on a stringer."
6685324,prov1800,2022-09-10 07:25:00,5010,No.Wife and I will be hunting with Mike and Jenny that run Latreille Lodge for Clark's.Will pick them up there.Grace is not far from Latreille and the following week There will be moose hunters at Latreille so we don't want to bother that area for those hunters.
6685332,Eckohlt,2022-09-10 07:49:00,3685,"Sounds like a kick arse trip to me,have fun n good luck,hope you can fill the freezer."
6685336,prov1800,2022-09-10 07:51:00,5010,Clark's has moose tags available so anyone looking for a hunt of a lifetime the opportunity is there.Plus the fishing on any of the outposts is exceptional.
6685106,prov1800,2022-09-09 08:56:00,5010,"Cedar Lake produced another awesome day of Crappies.Weather looked ugly but turned out pretty good.Wind was there but the Terrova did its job.Brought my boat as my guests boat had fire in the engine.Showed them a number of spots and each spot produced Crappies.Lots of 13-14"" with a couple of bigger ones.Water temp in the 65-67f range.Plenty of walleyes caught also.Love the fall fishing ."
6685114,Eckohlt,2022-09-09 09:17:00,3685,John it doesn't look like fall yet by the pics!!
6685116,prov1800,2022-09-09 09:21:00,5010,It is September and the leaves are not as green anymore.Weeds are decaying and some already going on.All the signs are there.
6685136,Eckohlt,2022-09-09 09:57:00,3685,Gotcha my friend!
6685160,prov1800,2022-09-09 10:58:00,5010,What you up to.I got couple days off.Slept in till 7:30 this morning.That was nice.
6685270,Eckohlt,2022-09-09 19:34:00,3685,"I'm packing getting ready to go north again,throwing in alittle warmer clothes this go around."
6685274,prov1800,2022-09-09 19:57:00,5010,Good idea.Packing for our moose trip up to Grace Lake outpost with Clarks..Leaving 18 th.Will see what weather will do.Hope it is cool though.Got a big packing list going on.lol.When you leaving Where to.
6685302,Eckohlt,2022-09-10 05:28:00,3685,"I'm leaving for nakina sept 23 flying into what some people call the lake a walleye factory,,abamasagi lake so we will see,hope you have cool weather john,get the bulls in the mood and there active,that sounds like a lot of fun,even if I wasn't hunting I would have like to go along and fish."
6685310,prov1800,2022-09-10 06:00:00,5010,We will definitely do a bunch of fishing.Grace lake is a great destination for walleye.it is a outpost for fishing after all just happens to be some moose up there also.Fish tend to be shallow up on those lakes now.
6685312,Eckohlt,2022-09-10 06:36:00,3685,"Nothing better than fall time in n.w Ont,beautiful time of year specially late fall, very quiet up there,if the wind is howling like a wolf not so much fun on the water."
