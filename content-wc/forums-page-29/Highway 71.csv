6684044,NARDA 1,2022-09-04 08:43:00,636,"Will be heading up that way on Wednesday 9/7, will let you know. I'm curious about the construction at the 11 and 71 intersection, it shouldn't be a big deal."

At the Hwy 11 & 71 intersection they were finishing up repaving 71 from that intersection for about 5 or 6 miles. Only delay was going North from that intersection for a mile or 2 it was down to 1 lane with a flag man. Wasn't bad at all. Buy the time you go up it might be completed."
