6684502,Eckohlt,2022-09-06 16:18:00,3685,That showering in the lake is still going to this day and will be going on sept 24 at Abamasagi.
6684678,Lovetofish,2022-09-07 13:41:00,458,Thanks for the heads up and sorry to hear about the truck stop. The last several years if I drive home that way I have stopped in Silver Dollar for gas and the bathroom. Haven't been in the town of Ignace for awhile I guess.
6685122,hammerdown31,2022-09-09 09:31:00,12,We stood in line at the subway in july due to lack of other options. (Lunch not breakfast).
6685250,HeHooksHimself,2022-09-09 17:39:00,725,"Hey Rich, you're probably on the road right now but we just returned from Savant last night. We stopped in Kakabeka Falls and ate at the Eddy restaurant on the way in. It was lots of food and really good. They open at 8. Fishing was good, Doc pulled n a 36"" Laker and I caught a 27 and a 29 1/2. Walleye were very plentiful but biggest was only 24. Andy told of a spot just on the triangle side of the narrows to the right of the buoy. Big fish walleye at 25 to 30 feet. Our best depth everywhere else was about 20. Most productive spot was just outside the entrance to the bay where camp is. Just north we caught a bunch of fish there. Have a great time! Hooks"
6685280,RichA$1970,2022-09-09 20:26:00,1159,You are right and around 12 more hours to go. Thanks for the tips and sent you a pm
6685356,BIGUGLY,2022-09-10 08:51:00,17,Robin's is no longer open. They were looking for a buyer a year or two ago. Was shuttered when we went up in August.
6685906,drlee,2022-09-12 19:43:00,409,"I know a lot of locals in Ignace. No sit down breakfasts available in my experience as of the first week in August. None on the horizon. Northwoods Motel was actually closed. The restaurant has been up and down, mostly down, with poor service. We have shifted over to Silver Dollar for an overnight stay. Very accommodating for dinner/breakfast/lodging, but let them know ahead. On our way north another 135 miles on Saturday AM to Austin's Wilderness Lodge. Had stayed at Northwoods Motel for years and years. Restaurant used to be very nice. Once in June, again in late July. Get your crawlers in Kakabaka Falls, not Ignace. Grocery store in Ignace is kick ***. Be sure to check hours. Buy a bunch of Canadian Rye bread for sandwiches and toast. Eggs and poultry are available and reasonable, as is milk. Use a US credit card to save $$. Grocery is fine with that. Upsala, one hour east of Ignace also has a good cafe for breakfast or lunch. Check with them on hours, since weekend help is an issue for them. I live in the US. Shop locally in the Ignace area and support our Canadian brothers and sisters. Pay a little more? Don't be a cheap jerk!"
6685920,RichA$1970,2022-09-12 21:25:00,1159,Silver Dollar worked out great and if you are in 599 worth the stop. Weather has been perfect up on Savant so far and the fishing has been good with solid thick walleyes.
6685924,Eckohlt,2022-09-13 04:42:00,3685,Probably eye has been on the dinner menu then rich!lkeep puttin the screws to'em.
6684362,RichA$1970,2022-09-05 21:24:00,1159,Curious is there’s any other breakfast options in Ignace than the Subway and if so what time they open Saturday on our way up to Savant. I could care less but the guy I’m going with was hoping to take a break before the last stretch.
6684382,Eckohlt,2022-09-06 05:07:00,3685,"Rich I don't know much about Ignace but I do see they have a robins doughnut,fill your gut with doughnuts,gotta be something better up that way you would think,good luck on savant I'm sure you'll knocke'm dead"
6684398,RichA$1970,2022-09-06 06:44:00,1159,"Rich I don’t know much about Ignace but I do see they have a robins doughnut,fill your gut with doughnuts,gotta be something better up that way you would think,good luck on savant I’m sure you’ll knocke’m dead[/QUOTE]I forgot about Robin’s & that works for me. We will be crossing at Pigeon River around 0300 so not nothing really open until Ignace. I always grab some donuts at Kwik Trip in Superior and yes, we will be slaying them in 4+ days!"
6684408,guidedfishing,2022-09-06 07:27:00,531,Rich Your best bet for a decent breakfast is Silver Dollar. If a good breakfast is what you want then stop at the Silver dollar on 599 on the way up. I have had good breakfasts there in the past. I did stop in to visit a few weeks back and although I did not eat I wish I had it smelled great and the breakfasts coming out looked good also. good luck
6684420,lawson2343,2022-09-06 08:08:00,459,"X2. We called ahead to Andrew on our June trip and he was ready for a large group. I will say, I didn't care for his sausages on the way up, so on the way home I had bacon!"
6684426,phishfearme,2022-09-06 08:50:00,1242,the northwoods motel serves a nice breakfast phish
6684430,Lovetofish,2022-09-06 09:16:00,458,If it is still open there is a truck stop on the east end of town that had a restaurant.
6684434,guidedfishing,2022-09-06 10:07:00,531,"Lovetofish:Just FYI, the truck stop on the east end of town/Ignace has long since for several years been closed down, in fact nothing but a parking lot remains.Phish: The Northwoods motel is open but the dinning section has been closed down since Covid and has not reopened and it is in question if it will anytime soon.Clooch's tavern in Ignace serves a pretty fair Lunch and Supper, decent chow have eaten there, but they do not serve breakfast.I am not aware of anywhere in Igance that serves a home style sit down breakfast at this time. If your going north on 599 Silver Dollar is your best bet, and you can get a decent breakfast at the hotel in Savant lake as well, although I have not eaten there recently. It's kept alive by the railroad.Good luck"
6684460,RichA$1970,2022-09-06 11:11:00,1159,Silver Dollar it is and thanks to all for the suggestions
6684500,Walleye2242,2022-09-06 16:11:00,263,Looking forward to your report when you get back. My dad and gramps fished savant long ago...mid to late 70's. Has been on my check list of places to fish. I was too young to go back then. I know the fishing was darn good. i also remember them talking about how they use to have to shower in the lake. Bar of soap and to the lake.
