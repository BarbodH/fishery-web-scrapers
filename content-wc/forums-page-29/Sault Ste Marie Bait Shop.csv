6684416,Wawajake,2022-09-06 08:02:00,413,Yep......Youngs General Store....on the right just past the Tim Hortons. Tackle and sausage too !
6684688,Donscs,2022-09-07 15:07:00,379,The new Bait Zones established in Ontario is making it a bit tricky to get bait. Wawa is in a different Bait Zone than where I will be fishing so can't get any bait there. I spoke with the Camp owner and they told me where I can get bait. If you are planning to purchase bait on your way to camp make sure the bait shop is in the Zone you will be fishing.

6684292,Donscs,2022-09-05 15:41:00,379,"Hi Guys, Heading up to the Wawa area in a couple of weeks and looking for a bait shop. Any suggestions for worms and leeches around Sault Ste Marie, Ontario. Thanks,"
6684298,jbb1069,2022-09-05 15:51:00,33,Worms are available at the gas station just up the road from Kanipahow
6684302,walleyecheek,2022-09-05 15:53:00,2231,God luck finding leeches this time of year !
6684308,Donscs,2022-09-05 16:17:00,379,"I almost screwed up here with the new Bait Regulations. Sault Ste Marie is in a different bait zone than where I will be fishing, so the gas station it is and it sounds like leeches don't work very well this time of year."
6684312,walleyecheek,2022-09-05 16:20:00,2231,"minnows, minnows, and more minnows this time of year."
6684318,OldFootdoc,2022-09-05 16:52:00,393,Not certain Post Covid if it is still open and around but there is a very full service bait store in Wawa on the left hand side as you head north through downtown. The owner was very chatty and good hearted and would appreciate the business. My friends have been going to Windemere lake east of Wawa for years and always order a flat of crawlers and leeches from that bait store.

6684326,pjshorthorn,2022-09-05 17:25:00,5654,"You can try Young's General Store on the right as you enter Wawa. They may have crawlers and minnows, but leeches are doubtful in late September. I would give them a call now. PjShorthorn"
6684330,Eckohlt,2022-09-05 17:40:00,3685,"Crawlers,crawlers,and more crawlers this time of year."
6684344,10lbeye,2022-09-05 19:16:00,61,"Trading Post just as you leave town. Great shop. Having said that, one of my big takeaways from this year's trip North was that Gulp 6 inch artificial nightcrawlers did as well as live crawlers on harnesses and jigs. Definitely worth buying a pack or 2. For what it's worth..."
