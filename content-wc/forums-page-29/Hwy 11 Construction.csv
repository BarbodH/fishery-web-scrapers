6685790,port1042,2022-09-12 11:32:00,509,"We crossed at International Falls on Saturday the 10th about 11:30am. We had driven 502 down from Dryden. I normally use 17 through Nestor Falls and did on the way up on the 3rd. Both roads were in good shape with minimal construction delays. We did have to go through a ""fish inspection"" by U.S. Federal Fish and Game officers at the crossing. I suppose it took about 15 minutes or so. They checked our licenses (5 guys in my van) and it didn't seem like they were actually counting fish but they did do a quick inspection of each package. We had packaged things properly and also included the name of the fisherman on the package. It seems like they were looking for the patch of skin and number of fish in each package (we always package fish individually). However, this year we added the name of a fisherman to each package at the advice of our camp owner. I don't know that it made any difference but we had no problems. Apparently there is some concern about group limits. One thing did bother me. We packed our frozen fish in the cooler at about 7:00am and had a 12 hour drive ahead of us. Opening the cooler and removing all the fish sure cost us a lot of ""cold"" in that cooler. Everything remained frozen when we arrived home but I'm glad I didn't have several hours left to drive. Fishing was a little slow in Perrault Lake but not too bad. I don't mind working for our fish. We had great weather and a fine trip."
6677944,Shotgun,2022-08-07 10:47:00,759,"I had the same experience coming home from near Ear Falls a few years ago. We followed a watering truck virtually turning the ground up road into mud. Once we got back into the US I stopped at a semi-trailer/tractor wash and tried to get most of it off. What a mess, I also ended up with a stained cover. There was a guy on a motorcycle a few vehicles ahead of us. I felt sorry for him as he had mud all over and may of ended up with a motor heating up. Don't know if it would help, but I'd like to find a way/site rather it be tourism or Ontario road works some feedback. Maybe do one lane at a time versus the entire road. We're headed to Ear Falls September 2nd and I guess I'll go up 502. Thanks to site members for the heads up as I'd sure like to avoid going through that again."
6679518,dstemp,2022-08-14 20:16:00,16,Im not sure what they are using on there road for dust but I was in Nester Falls a couple weeks ago . And came up from Emo its a mess I can not seem to get what ever they are using off my new truck . I have been through a couple car washes and today tired a pressure washer with very little effect Does anyone know what they are using and what has worked to remove it
6679992,eyeman_1,2022-08-17 13:55:00,690,"When I came home I spent 3 hours on the boat, and 2 on the truck with the pressure washer and got a lot off, but could not get some on the under carriage to budge. I bought some of that Purple Power cleaner and put it in my tank sprayer and soaked stuff with it and let it sit a bit. Ran the truck to the quarter car wash and used their soap option and took a lot more off.... I'm convinced the truck will never be the same but I got it pretty clean.Good luck... it's a mess up there.. at least I got the boat clean as I was selling it when I got home."
6680004,7 Mag,2022-08-17 14:28:00,1887,"This is disappointing to hear, i had planned to take 11 next weekend, sounds like i will have have to stick with 502 to Vermillion Bay."
6680012,Pooch,2022-08-17 14:38:00,4618,Just came up 502 a couple days ago. Road is fine. Did have moose crossover in front of us mid day so keep your head on a swivel.Pooch
6680018,Shotgun,2022-08-17 15:32:00,759,"Pooch, thanks for the follow-up and confirmation of road condition. As mentioned previously in a post, we're headed that way in a couple weeks and I'd sure like to avoid that mess again-Hwy 502 it is for me. I'll report back after our trip."
6680036,7 Mag,2022-08-17 16:06:00,1887,Thanks Pooch I'll definitely watch for critters!
6680314,dstemp,2022-08-18 19:55:00,16,after coming back from Nesterfalls with a dirty truck I did try purple power stuff it worked fairly well What I did find that worked better was product called Oil eater I think it did a better job left no residue and you can put in a pressure washer I didn't I just sprayed on with a bottle sprayer and rinsed off I did speak with some one up there about it (I was told maybe the truth )they are using a product called PennzSuppress supposed to come off with plain water
6680506,port1042,2022-08-19 13:52:00,509,We're not heading up until the 2nd/3rd of Sept. and typically stay in Emo on Friday night. We're still a couple of weeks out. Is this construction expected to be completed by then? Thanks for the Ontario 511 advice but I don't see a completion date on there.
6685702,Shotgun,2022-09-12 07:20:00,759,"As mentioned in post #16 - report back.We just came back from near Ear Falls Saturday and hwy 502 was good to travel. Some stop and go with flagman for short periods but overall good road conditions. At about 9:00 crossing the border it was about a 15 minute wait. If you declared any fish, you had the strong chance of being pulled over and inspected. The guard radio over to the inspectors and I heard them say ""we're full up"". Looked like 10 to 15 rigs pulled over being checked. Our guard rsponded to us ""gentlemen you're good to go"". The other boat with us got inspected, which only took about 10 minutes. Northwest Lac Seul-lots for slot walleye biggest 25 1/4. Biggest northern 37, several 19 to 23. Overall not big numbers but good quality fish with great weather. More boats fishing than several years in the past. However, could of been due to holiday weekend in the states."
6671754,eyeman_1,2022-07-11 05:54:00,690,"If you are traveling to Nestor Falls, Sioux Narrows or Kenora on 11 beware they have begun road construction on the road and it's a mess! They have graded the road south of Nestor Falls for a few miles and wet it down... it is a disaster and it took me 5 hours yesterday to clean the sand and mud from the boat, trailer, and underside of the truck. All are still a mess after powerwashing for that length of time but I got 80% off... then another hour cleaning the driveway. Beware and safe travels! BTW the fishing on LOTW was amazing as well."
6671756,That Minnesota guy,2022-07-11 05:56:00,8293,Something to be said for renting camp boats.
6671762,Laker10,2022-07-11 06:11:00,100,"It was the same for us traveling on 71 on Saturday. The road was a mess and it was slow with delays along the way too. It's a long ways they are repairing, going to take a while to complete."
6671856,walleyenewby,2022-07-11 13:33:00,36,Yea did not expect that. My son took 502 and came back clean. My van otherwise.
6671906,Pooch,2022-07-11 17:08:00,4618,"Went up 502 then came home via 71. Should not have done that! Truck and boat were covered in clayish mud. As soon as I pulled into our yard I went directly to the shop and used the hot water pressure washer to get the big stuff off then hand washed everything the second time. Spent about three hours getting close to where I stated before the trip. I live on a farm so mud we are used to, but hopefully not on vacation too!! Pooch"

This was the last trip for my boat as I've sold it to a friend and was not expecting the mortar that the road turned into. Like you, I spent almost 4 hours on the boat, trailer and under carriage of my truck to get it 80% off. Now to hit the truck again at the car wash to get the rest off. The exhaust / tail pipe may never come clean as it baked on. Seriously disappointed and why the construction crews wetted the road to mud I have no idea, I get damp to hold dust down, but mud..... but it sure made a mess.... the cover was caked as well. But, at least the fishing was good. I do have to power wash the driveway again.. it stuck to that well also."
6672108,Carnhzkr,2022-07-12 10:41:00,964,"This sux. I'm too familiar with the road gunk you're talking about, as I hit this stuff a few years ago with construction on both 17 and 105 on my way to Ear Falls. Unfortunately, I'm going to a lodge (Witch Bay) which is on the NE side of LOTW on 7/22 north of Sioux Narrows, off 71. I guess I'll try to get an up to date report a day or two prior to that, but it may be worth the extra 70 or so miles to take the 502 route and come in from the north. Odd, when I look at the Ontario 511 web site, the only construction I see is at the intersection 11 & 71, near Emo."
6672110,eyeman_1,2022-07-12 10:45:00,690,"There are two spots on 11/71, one just north of the EMO intersection and one about 8-10 mi north of that. They may have the new pavement down by then. It was just a shock to our group as there wasn't anything going on on the way to Wiley Point. Witch Bay is just up the road a piece from where we turn off, so if they are still working on the areas on 11/71 you most likely will run into it. But as I mentioned, they may have the new pavement laid by then who knows... There were not a ton of guys working on it at on Saturday."
6677520,SJC305,2022-08-05 08:07:00,154,"Thanks for the 511 information, I had never seen it before. Glad to know know about construction on 17, 631 and 11 where we drive through."
6677890,Pooch,2022-08-07 08:35:00,4618,"I don't see why, but it seems when they are spraying for dust and more compaction in the construction areas That they add a ""sticker"" or dust reduction agent to the water? What ever is different sure makes getting a boat or vehicle clean once that stuff dries is tough. My boat tarp is permanently stained and for ever dirty looking. Even after scrubbing with soap and a brush by hand on the concrete. This seems to happen to me every couple of years somewhere. Big upside is the roads are being improved and much appreciated by myself and others. Just need more heads up. WC guys have been good about sharing information like this every year and that too, is much appreciated. Pooch"
