Anytime there are two things you're going to compare them. Last year was great, this year was good to very good. Same lake, similar dates, but different lake levels and currents. The weather was pretty good. In six days we were forced off the lake by lightning only part of one day. There was some rain, but overall the weather cooperated nicely. Last year fishing was fantastic at three spots: the Pin Cushion, where the lake enters into the Root River, a spot between two islands and below the dam. This year the lake level was much higher than last year. In addition the dam had been closed much of the year, so there was little current at the Pin Cushion when we first got there. We got a few fish at the Pin Cushion, but nothing compared to last year. When we traveled down river to fish below the dam we couldn't pull the boats into the same spot as last year since the river level was much higher and our spot on the right side was flooded. There was a helicopter and crew at the dam that was opening gates to release more water. They said we could park on the left side and fish below the dam on that side for a while. It was an easier walk on that side and there was even a sign labelling it as a portage. It wasn't as easy to fish, however, with more unstable rock to stand on and bushes behind. We got a few fish there (I got 5 for instance). Last year a guy got 60 fish in 100 casts. After a while the work crew told us we would have to leave soon as the gates were being opened and our spot with the parked boats would soon be difficult to get out of. The area we called The Reef and the area between two islands produced fish, just not at the same level as last year. You'd get 5 or 6 fish and it was time to move. Fish were caught in 6' and 25'. We could see fish at 35' and deeper but just didn't want to fish that deep. Overall, the fish were scattered and it was hard to find the sweet spot depth or location. Speaking of sweet, thanks to SweetD for pointing out a new location that became our go-to-spot. SweetD fished Root Bay in July and sent me some of their spots. A few miles down the river from the Pin Cushion the river opens up like a small lake. At the end of that open area it narrows down again to a small river width. The spot where it narrows had a lot of current, especially after the dam was opened. There's a large area 8-10' deep in front of the opening that produced a lot of doubles. Like the Pin Cushion it's a neck-down spot with current, so we named it Pin Cushion 2.0. We had fish for dinner 4 nights out of 6 and had no trouble getting fish for dinner or to bring home, fishing just wasn't as consistent as last year. We got no large fish with the biggest being 24.5 walleye and 35' northern. There were a lot of 18-20 walleyes with some 14' mixed in as well. 7' northern is a new record low for me. The cabin and boats were very good again, especially the large covered deck. There were 10 of us on this trip so the large deck was great. This year there was a friendly squirrel that entertained everyone coming up on the deck table in search of nuts. As our group was leaving I met englishbob in the group that was coming in and pointed out some spots to him. Hopefully the Pin Cushion will produce more for them as the current increased in that area. I look forward to his report. Next year: Hooker Lake with Slate Falls Outposts"

6684660,Da' Walleye Assassun,2022-09-07 11:34:00,358,Are you having that northern mounted?
6684700,kim n indiana,2022-09-07 16:16:00,62,"yea, scott and i parked on what you are calling the pincushion 2 the last day, endured on/off rain showers for 4 hrs, but it was one fish after another. the left side seemed to be better than the right side, i think because there were more weeds to use as ambush spots. at one point it was 7 fish in 7 casts on little point. As reminder, for us the water was up 7 feet, so its flooding normal shoreline. the copter must have been cool. we fished the left side also and dealt with rocks. but jeepers, i was where water was coming into little pool, and it was one fish after another. walleye and those slimy SOB's... I did slip and go down, so care had to be taken getting to water's edge. Seems like any little pool or slack water had fish stacked shoulder to shoulder. Our biggest pike came below dam. Scott again as i recall, and good 42"". you needed lots of jigs because about every 10/15 casts it was either a snag or bite off."
6684714,stjoeguy,2022-09-07 17:48:00,979,"We probably could have done better than we did below the dam if we would have moved downstream more, but with our average age of 75+ we felt lucky just to get off the rocks in one piece! Pin cushion 2.0 was definitely the place to be this year. Thanks for sharing it with us."
6684720,gordy28,2022-09-07 18:20:00,437,Thanks for sharing. Interesting on how the water levels affected your fishing. When we were there in 2020 I think the pin cushion account led for 50% of our walleyes and the dam was also incredible. The spot you found them at this year is a “wish I fished it spot” for me. The current flowing through there was crazy on our trip toI actually think your group or part of it got on the float plane we got off of on the 27th. We chatted w two gentlemen as we unloaded and they were going to Eagle Island but I think it was also going to root bay CheersAndrew
6684744,kim n indiana,2022-09-07 19:49:00,62,"yea, stjoeguy, if average age was 75, that makes it tough. i'm early 60's, still a little nimble, but ended up going down when rock shifted on me. Was OK, but i can easily see how someone could break a hip or leg or whatever easily. Took my sweet time getting out after being at river's edge for good hour."
6684860,Carnhzkr,2022-09-08 11:31:00,964,"Thanks for the report, Paul. SJ is indeed an incredible lake and the RB camp and boats are first-rate. I'm so glad I was able to tag along with you guys last year."
