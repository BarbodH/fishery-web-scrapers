6473706,campchick,2020-08-12 21:08:00,96,Looks like rain in tomorrow's forecast for Red Lake so that should help!
6474340,LoDo,2020-08-14 19:27:00,721,Radar showing heavy rain all night! Fingers crossed for the RL folks.

6474400,pjshorthorn,2020-08-15 05:33:00,5654,"Hey LoDo, What do you know about your cabin and the west end of Red Lake ? I read a CBC article last week that said there was a fire at Pipestone Narrows just north of the entrance to your place and Bow Narrows Camp. I think Dan Baughman and his wife ( former owners of Bow Narrows) are also finishing building their retirement cabin this summer just across from Bow Narrows camp . I was also a bit worried about Jim and Jillian Slavich's Black Bear Lodge in Slays Bay. When I read about Madsen being evacuated I was like.... Oh Snap......that is way too close to everyone and the town of Red Lake. The good news is that there are water bombers stationed in Red Lake....if I remember correctly. My son and I were fishing at the entrance of Hall Bay and one bomber was doing maneuvers one evening, picking up water in Golden Arm and then dumping it between Potatoe Island and Hall Bay. I took a lot of pictures as they came by and with each pass, they got a little lower and little closer to us. On their last pass, we got a nice soaking from the mist of the water they dumped . Those flyboys were having a bit of fun with us on a really warm afternoon. Somewhere I have pictures of that day. I gotta get back to Red Lake one of these years. The beauty and history of the lake is amazing. Hope all is well with you and the camp. PjShorthorn"
6474430,LoDo,2020-08-15 07:11:00,721,"All is good out where I'm at. I did see a small fire out near Pipestone as well. From what I've heard, photos, etc... Pipestone is east from where we are. Thanks for asking!"
6473224,prov1800,2020-08-11 10:31:00,5010,Thats awesome
6473260,rosh1,2020-08-11 11:48:00,275,FishTed that is great. All that has been against you lodge owners this year and you step up to the plate. Well I think you just hit that one out of the park!
6473272,LoDo,2020-08-11 12:05:00,721,My guy stayed in RL. He's north of town on an island. He says the fire is going to cross the 105. Red Lake is a ghost town. Loads of camps have opened to allow residents. Many are fleeing to Dryden and Kenora. What a year.
6473274,RichA$1970,2020-08-11 12:09:00,1159,Nice of the camps to open up based on their vacancies due to COVID. Hopefully the government will provide the camps with some benefits for helping out.

6473620,campchick,2020-08-12 12:46:00,96,"Thanks to Pooch for providing the link for the imagery of the Red Lake fire from space. It shows how the fire is building and all information is relevant for us Red Lakers. As I kept watching, however, the announcer showed the fire starting and showed a satellite shot of a cloudy map of Ontario. What puzzled me was why he announced the fire shown as the Red Lake fire as it was clearly north of Lake Nipigon. This fire is not anywhere near Red Lake at all. By the way, the Red Lake fire 49 continues to burn and is at 750 hectares already."
6473626,Pooch,2020-08-12 14:00:00,4618,Anyone hearing anything about Balmertown? Does the Chukuni river offer it some protection?Pooch
6473632,BrianinVA,2020-08-12 14:21:00,160,Good eye! That appears to be imagery of the Nipigon 45 fire that is 3600 hectares in size.
6473060,LoDo,2020-08-10 21:18:00,721,Keep those people in your thoughts tonight!! Extremely bad fire just south with brutal winds. RL just issued full evacuation.

6473128,rosh1,2020-08-11 06:48:00,275,Wish them the best and hope all are safe. Is the fire close to your place LODO?
6473134,BornToFish,2020-08-11 06:59:00,1224,"Greetings, I sure hope the very best for the residents of Red Lake and the surrounding area. The lives of many people will be severely disrupted. In view of the border closure, I strongly suspect that many businesses are already hurting financially. This fire situation will only make things worse for a lot of good people. Kindest regards...."
6473202,prov1800,2020-08-11 09:38:00,5010,"Everyone is helping out. Camps are opening up cabins and RV sites as of last night when they evaluated Red Lake.

6473208,RichA$1970,2020-08-11 09:43:00,1159,Hope it rains and the winds die down up there to slow the fires.
