If your sink wouldn't drain, someone put something down it that they should not have. And if you ran out of hot water I suggest someone or somebody's shower time get a bit shorter. As an example, I was on a trip to Onaway in 2011, 11 females and 8 males in the large cabin they have....consider the amount of hot water used everyday that week, never even came close to running out. Blair and Kathy run a really good camp, and are great people. I hope they are doing well. Constantly working on improving the camp and adding to the experience. Great....now I'll never get my week back."
6472284,eyecatcher1,2020-08-08 06:34:00,323,"Thanks! On the NE section there are a few boat to resorts, but most resorts are on other lakes and require a long boat ride or drive to the boat ramp if you want to fish Lac Seul. It would be nice to just have to boat by the cabin right on Lac Seul."
6472356,prov1800,2020-08-08 11:24:00,5010,All of the west end camps on Lac Suel are right on the lake with one offering house boats and there are also a few outposts offered.The ones mentioned are the closest to good fishing without having long boat rides from the Earfalls area.
6472362,Skywagon,2020-08-08 11:43:00,1106,"On the NE side you could always rent an outpost cabin from a tourist operator, then you would be right on the lake."
6472578,eyecatcher1,2020-08-09 07:37:00,323,"I have done a few times, but now that we're getting older we like the option on a really bad weather day to go into town or do something else until the weather breaks. At an outpost we don't get that option. Now we usually fish Lac Seul on the good weather days and fish Abram, Minnitaki or Pelican on the other days. It works for us, we're still fishing!"
6472670,LoDo,2020-08-09 15:40:00,721,Onaway is my absolute fav on the west side of Lac Seul. Ive stayed at Fishermans Cove many years ago. FC is nice too! MacKenzie may be the best walleye fishery in Ontario. MacKenzie all the way down to the entrance of Broad and Sun Light is incredible! I believe Lac Seul Lodge has an outpost in Broad / Sunlight area. Ive driven past it before. Both of those lake produce serious numbers too. Dont be scared of the river from main Lac Seul into those lakes. The first time taking the river from main lac seul to those two smaller lakes i bet i was driving 5mph. A guide boat passed me at a good clip. We followed. Ive been in to those lake a few times now and never hit anything. Manitoba Pt if you can handle the wind / chop produces big fish.
6472752,prov1800,2020-08-10 06:06:00,5010,Definatly agree with you on Onaway Lodge.Beautifull set up there.Blair and Kathy run a tight ship.There cabins are the best ive seen and the docks and fish cleaning system is number one to.Broad and Sunlight lakes are a blast in the early season but do have to be carefull by the dead tree sticking out halfway up the creek and entering Broad lake lots of rocks there.Didnt get up in there this year as i usually only go with guests.With hardly anyone on the lake this year we just fish closer.
6472822,fishingMN4eyes,2020-08-10 10:03:00,108,"Yes, there are quite a few on the west side as others have noted. We stayed at Whitewing. Their cabins were very nice compared to many we've stayed at in Canada."
6472846,prov1800,2020-08-10 10:30:00,5010,Check out Onaway Lodge.They are fairly close to mckenzie bay entrance and need to come through bay of islands on the way there.There is great fishing from the minute you leave camp and if main lake rough youll do great without having to go far.Also not a long run to south inlet which also has great fishing.
6473654,ackvil,2020-08-12 16:33:00,177,"We have stayed at Fisherman's Cove and Onoway. Both are good camps with a good location. They are very close in proximity. My only problem with Onoway was the last two times we stayed there we had plumbing problems. The kitchen sink would not drain and one time we ran out of hot water. However, both camps are run by good people who are happy to share information."

6471270,eyecatcher1,2020-08-05 06:54:00,323,"I asked why and the game warden said that it keeps the walleye population stable. I've don't agree because I've fished Lac Seul 2 or 3 times a year since 1992 and although the fishing is always great the size of what I catch can differ from year to year. Some years eaters are everywhere and slots and overs are harder to find. Other years it's the eaters that are harder to find, but the slots are everywhere. I think that the quality of the spawning year may have more to do with what size is in the lake."
6471324,fishingMN4eyes,2020-08-05 08:48:00,108,"Our group has fished the Northwest section of Lac Seul for the last 6-7 years and found different sizes in different parts of the lake. Steamboat, for the most part, seems to produce eater fish for us. Once we get down to McKenzie I feel like we see a lot more slot fish."
6471392,eyecatcher1,2020-08-05 10:09:00,323,I fish the Northeast section and it's the same there. It's just that some years one size of fish is more plentiful than the other. It doesn't matter because I'm fishing Lac Seul where every day is a good day!
6471402,fishingMN4eyes,2020-08-05 10:30:00,108,"Agreed, Lac Seul pretty much always lives up to the hype. Just find the size disparity on some spots or areas compared to others to be interesting."
6471536,prov1800,2020-08-05 17:42:00,5010,You guys are right.Anywhere from Earfalls to Siouxlookout is about as good as it gets fishing that body of water.Ive fished it from one end to the other.Its awesome everywhere.Steamboat has lots of big fish.Its a big chunk of water and has sweet spots.
6472006,ackvil,2020-08-07 08:30:00,177,We have had good fishing close to the fishing camps. We nailed pike where the weed beds were and had great luck with walleyes just drifting without having to go very far from our cabin. There are so many inlets and bays to explore.
6472038,fishingMN4eyes,2020-08-07 09:48:00,108,"Same. There's a reef five minutes from the camp we stay at. We usually end the day there. On at least one occasion it produced someone's over on the last stop of our trip. It also produced our big fish for the trip, 27.5"", on the last stop of our trip on a different occasion."

He checked my 8 under slot fish and asked if I didn't catch any overs. I told him that I did, but never keep over slot fish. He became irritated and said that there was a 3 under and 1 over rule for a reason and asked that I keep and over in my limit in the future. Since then I have, but could easily go back to 8 unders if you guys would rather that I did. We usually keep 2 at 21""."

6470432,David Anderson,2020-08-02 22:03:00,2073,"I am curious, with the absence of all the US based fisherman has there been any discussion regarding the effect on the walleyes at Lac Seul and the expected future fishing, or is it simply such a walleye factory that a year off of any major fishing pressure will have little effect? Thanks"
6470490,prov1800,2020-08-03 07:10:00,5010,Iam thinking there will very little effect on the lake.It is a walleye factory and has been for years.Still have great catches going on but i am noticing a down swing in bigger fish catches over the last few years.Could be bad spawning due to fluctuation in water levels which LS is noted for. Older larger fish dying off from old age and have witnessed people keeping real large fish.Lots of factors.Still a great fishery and hard to beat.
6470524,tv4fish,2020-08-03 08:23:00,2694,JMHO ---- If anything - it should have a positive effect - as almost ALL of the fish that would have been caught this year - will STILL be there for us to catch next year.
6470552,Pooch,2020-08-03 09:16:00,4618,"Predators in nature usually keep a balance in most populations. Without some predaton, any species can over stretch the forage supply harming the entire population. As far as fish go, you can see this in many farm ponds that never get fished by the neighborhood kids. They soon fill with a lot of small stunted sunfish. OR, the opposite happens and there are a few large sunfish for a while then they reproduce and eventually overpopulate the forage source. Then the forage base becomes their own young. I would think that this can happen in any lake. The further north lakes might even be more susceptible. There has to be adequate forage for any population to sustain or grow. There is a ripple effect throughout the food chain from plankton to the top predators. So..... when speaking of LS, could it eventually become populated with eaters or less? I don't see it in one year, but many years? Look at MN. for a glimpse of any fisheries possible future. Many reasons for fisheries to change, from over fishing to under fishing. I've friends that fish smaller lakes that are mostly un or under fished and I doubt large fish are coming out of them because of base forage. On our past fly-in trips to mostly mid sized lakes the average fish is smaller than LS or other large bodies of water. Gotta be forage related. Though lake genetics surely plays a part, too. I doubt a lake with only crayfish and minnow forage is gonna produce as large a fish as one with gizzard shad or other higher protein forage base. I doubt that in one year could make a big difference, but with the (my perception only) good forage base on LS, I gotta think that the average size walleye will be 1/2 to (maybe) 1 inch longer next year. More fish will be in the slot. While larger fish now in the slot, a few will grow out of the slot into ""overs"". Seems that growth rate slows as fish age. No different that ourselves. More fish will enter the ""slot"" than grow out of it. The above is purely an unscientific POV on my part. Though an interesting conversation. I'd like to know what fish biologist have to say with such a dramatic drop in fishing pressure. Seems that every lake's response will be different. Large heavily fished lakes will surely respond differently than smaller remote lakes that receive little fishing pressure. Pooch"
6470878,tv4fish,2020-08-04 05:21:00,2694,"Pooch: While I certainly agree with that statement - I think we also have to realize that ""man"" can certainly have an impact on a fishery. A lot of us on here have seen the effect of man's ""control"" on Lac Suel. Just think back and remember how much the ""slot limit"" improved the fishing ""quality"" on Lac Suel. As I have said before - I live on a lake that I have seen first hand what can happen to a lake when man interferes with Mother Nature..........."
6471002,Pooch,2020-08-04 10:45:00,4618,"When I was talking about predators, I was including us as fisherman. ""Harvesting"" or predating... same thing. I've only been fishing LS for twelve or thirteen years and I feel like the fishery has over all improved. Though I had a steep learning curve coming from all granite lakes to fishing sand, mud, weeds and sometimes trees. The first few years I just couldn't get the hang of where and why for fish location. It still stings my heart to see an over slot get filleted out, but that is the rule whether people agree or not. I'd still like to hear a fish biologist's thoughts. Pooch"

Alternatively, is it something that is generally agreed to by most lodges and anglers? I fished years ago on lakes that were not doing well with their walleye populations. The lodges on those lakes imposed their own slots for walleyes - nothing kept over eighteen inches. Of course, some lodges did a better job than others in enforcing the slot. These slots made a HUGE difference in those walleye fisheries within a few short years of being implemented. Kindest regards..."

Could not they have acquired any other piece of property closer to (directly north) of Sioux? It just seems like we have to drive so far east on 615 to the launch at Deception and then motor back to Deception light in order to head north to our fishing spots?
6469654,Skywagon,2020-07-31 07:20:00,1106,"Yesterday we fished Lac Seul. I took the boat up to Hudson to meet up with Colin (known as Lac Seul Guide on WC) and Steve M (Canadian-American dual citizen who has a cabin on Big Vermillion). It was quite a site on the road to the boat landing, 9 house boats all sitting up on dry land, normally at this time of year they would all be out on the water. The plan yesterday was to travel up to the north central part of the lake where there is a big expanse of open water, just north-east of Mahkwa Lodge. It was sunny with not enough wind (how rare is that?), a quick trip up, 40 MPH through the rags (plenty of water depth). There were none of the usual houseboats on Banana or Taylor islands, we pretty well had the lake to ourselves, other than 4 Anderson Lodge guide boats that were taking local Home Hardware employees out for a day trip. The bright-sunny\no wind conditions were not conducive to fantastic fishing, but we still found plenty of walleye to keep us busy. We mainly fished the humps, the majority of the fish seemed to be around 22ft. If you were looking for eaters, yesterday was the day, slot and over size fish were not the majority. As always, it's hard to beat a day on Lac Seul with friends, I can see taking another trip or two up there before summer is over, the fishing out on the humps will only get better."
