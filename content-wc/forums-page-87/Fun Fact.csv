BTW a case of Canadian Coors Light in Canadian currency is $45.95. I still get emails from The Beer Store asking when I’ll be up. Seems The Beer Store and therefore Ontario miss my ‘Murican pesos. I'm not sure if this link works but it is to The Beer Store. They have an app that lets you preorder beer for pickup or delivery. Our plan was to preorder, swoop in and swoop out to save time in Ft. Francis. Maybe next year. We even though about requesting a delivery to our outpost. Can I get a road report on the 502?EDIT: I guess the link didn't link, but you can google The Beer Store and browse their selections prior to your arrival and save some time at the instore kiosks."

Pull over under the canopy, another agent comes out and gives you a slip. Go inside, pay the duty, it was always $10, and you are on your way. We had multiple cases in the back of the truck and it always the same. I have yet to figure out the formula that they use to calculate the duty."
6478476,phishfearme,2020-08-29 10:47:00,1242,"i would guess that the agents did something really wrong - you are required to declare what alcohol you have and a ""trunk load"" is not an acceptable amount - say, you declare you have 10 cases of beer for 4 guys - that means you are 6 cases over the limit. - the large majority of the time you will be asked to pull over and another agent will check your vehicle - if he only finds the 10 cases then you will be asked to pay duty on the 6 you are over the limit - this is usually about $9-$10 Can per case - however if he finds more than you declared - like bottles of liquor or more than 10 cases of beer - these will be confiscated and you will be fined. this is written from the voice of experience. phish p.s. - the duty that is collected on your ""beer over the limit"" plus the cost of the beer in the US will still be less that what beer costs in Canada - but is it worth the time? your vehicle may be torn apart after you packed it so carefully - is it worth it?"
6478500,walleyecheek,2020-08-29 11:15:00,2231,Coors light ? Who drinks that in CANADA ? Labatts Blue for this guy !!!!!
6478508,Clairebear,2020-08-29 11:31:00,937,"Coors Light, Blue Light, Bud Light, why would anyone drink that? There are so many good tasting beers on the market now."
6478512,walleyecheek,2020-08-29 11:38:00,2231,like what Busch light apple.......yuck !
6478532,Eckohlt,2020-08-29 12:24:00,3685,"I no for me if I was still drinking,the labatts brewery would have to kick it up a notch,nothing better"
6478582,Lmbkiller,2020-08-29 16:26:00,639,Busch latte apple is so horrible it's sold out everywhere
6478590,walleyecheek,2020-08-29 16:38:00,2231,the reason you cant find it is because they QUIT making it !!!!!!!!!
6478624,'Taterguy,2020-08-29 19:40:00,33,"Not me. I was trying to point out that the same brand of beer brewed in two different countries have different ABV. I would have figured CL brewed in Canada would have the higher ABV. I couldn't tell you why I assumed that but I did. Kokanee, Canadian, Blue, all good but we found Old Style Pilsner, no, not the same swill from the States, and that has become our The Beer Store favorite."
