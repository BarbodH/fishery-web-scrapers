It's definitely both of my kids that make this burden easier to bear which any parent can understand. As far as Brendan goes, including him has always been the best part of what I do. He's really developed into a fine young man and angler and I'm very proud."

Believe it or not we were the first people at Melchett lake and I believe only their 3rd customers of the year for all 8 camps. To say things are slow for the outfitters is an understatement. Nakina air has just one plane in the water, the other three are sitting on ground. Fishing was fantastic, both numbers and size, largest walleye was 28"" and another at 27'"". Plenty above the 20"" mark and hundreds between 17-20"". Total fish landed between the group was 1610. Pretty much any colour worked and fish seemed to be relatively shallow compared to 2018. We don't target pike but did manage a decent 35""er. Water is down another 12"" from 2 years ago so navigating into Kap wasn't possible. Everyone up there sure are missing you Americans, lets hope we get things back to normal and the border opens for 2021. Many thanks to Jason and Sue, fantastic people who run a great operation and also Nakina air for a perfect flight in and out. Bester"

6476370,Juls,2020-08-21 01:48:00,13414,He's been fishing some fantastic lakes up there. He posts his adventures on his Facebook page. Some of the fish he and his son have caught this year are fish most people only dream of catching.
6476398,Mike Borger,2020-08-21 06:18:00,1554,"Didn't realize so many cared. It's been a very tough year. My dad suddenly got ill with pancreatic cancer just prior to covid hitting, and finally passed away on May 18. Between dealing with that along with covid like everyone else it's been incredibly difficult.Most of my travel was cancelled this year, but I did visit Misekumaw Lake in northern Saskatchewan with my son for 10 days in early July and had just an incredible trip. Crazy numbers of trophy lake trout and pike. That story should be done and wrapped up within a few days, when it is I'll post it here.Later next week I'm headed to Uchi Lake Lodge out of Ear Falls for a week of fishing with my son and I expect it'll be a blast too. Not surprisingly they haven't had a single guest for the entire season, but they've been up there renovating getting things ship shape and extended an invite for me to join them.Even as a Canadian angler ANY trip this year is a blessing, and I feel very very fortunate for the opportunities!Will definitely keep you guys updated!Cheers"
