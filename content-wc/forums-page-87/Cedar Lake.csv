6473946,prov1800,2020-08-13 16:18:00,5010,Definately will.Its like fishing on a fly out in a bigger boat.lol.
6473970,Eckohlt,2020-08-13 17:14:00,3685,Ya those 14ft fly in boats can be hard on an old guy for week but I'd rather suffer there than be here at home lol
6473976,prov1800,2020-08-13 17:20:00,5010,I hear you there.we had 12 ft last fall at the moose hunt.Hard on body.To tippy.
6473986,Eckohlt,2020-08-13 18:05:00,3685,2 guys and a moose in a 12 footer no social distancing there
6473988,prov1800,2020-08-13 18:14:00,5010,Didnt have to worry about that last year.Just one guy and one moose in the boat.lol.
6474002,KC Walleye,2020-08-13 18:52:00,274,"John, you keep touting Clark's any chance you get! It's honestly quite comical! Gotta love your determination to redeem their tarnished name. It's too bad they have no remorse and have showed their true character to the tune of keeping probably close to 1 million dollars of unearned money. They couldn't even draft a proper PR response after months of time to think about how to apologize, explain, defend, etc........all they can say is too bad, our business will be here and we will still be thriving next year! But I guess, your constant uplifting posts about how great Clark's free minnow service is, and how great of owners they are will save you thousands of dollars a year on bait as your commission. Good for you! Keep guiding for them, love their free minnows, tout how they took in evacuees.....does this make them better people? Or are they still unethical, immoral individuals..... not much better than thieves? What punishment would one get for stealing 1 million dollars in Canada? Would be interesting to find out. Throughout my time on this site you seem like a really good person and a stand up dude. But I just can't help but laugh everytime I read one of your posts now, because I know what you sold your soul for......free minnows! Enjoy your amazing friends!"
6474004,Eckohlt,2020-08-13 18:54:00,3685,"Since the moose aren't getting blasted by guys from south of the border this year,I assume they will be plentiful in 2021 along with yogi bear?you think john?"
6474012,prov1800,2020-08-13 19:14:00,5010,I would think your right.The bears dont need a break there are way to many of them.But will be good for moose.Allthough getting tags as residents is pretty tough for years allready as they have really reduced the amount s giving out.
6474034,prov1800,2020-08-13 20:21:00,5010,Got to stick with your freinds.I didnt start the minnow topic.allthough iam very glad that i dont have to buy them.Like i said neither do any of their guests.i figure if you have been a guest of clarks before and maybe for some years in my book your money ahead in not getting a minnow bill at the end of the week.If your new you havnt had a chance to cash in on that deal.Any other camp charges extra for minnows and some charge extra for gas if you use up to say 15 gallons.loosing a couple hundred bucks per person is chicken feed.ive heard a lot of complaining on Fridays when guys were paying their bills.They give you a great boat to use where some camps charge extra for a upgrade like that.Iam not made out of money but if i lost a couple of hundred bucks wouldnt be a big deal.They do run the best Northwest experience.Oh no here i go again.
6473778,prov1800,2020-08-13 06:32:00,5010,"With the winds settling down i decided to head to Cedar Lake.First was cast for some muskies close to camp.Saw 5 big girls but just cant seem to hook them.Oh well will have to try again.lol.This time i decided to head to east end and try for crappies.Wasnt disappointed.Got on first spot and started hauling up crappies right away.Real beauties.That spot had action for close to a hour.Probably caught 50-60 of them all around 12-13"".Moved to another spot and same there and the next spot.Only grabbed about 10 doz minnows from Clarks and was running out.Used rest of minnows on walleyes which were also on fire.Hot day at 30c.Slowly fished some walleye spots on way back and caught walleyes everywhere.Cast for muskies at a few spots but no more sightings.As i was pretty close to camp had Zack set the otter down just ti my left.that kinda woke me up.Camp is full of Red lake fire evacutees.Talk to some and all are pretty happy to have a safe place to stay."
6473816,Net_Man,2020-08-13 08:27:00,580,"Clark's? Minnows? Since Clark's owes me $1200.00, can I buy $1200.00 of minnows for you as trade for 2 or so days of guide service from you next year?"
6473826,prov1800,2020-08-13 08:52:00,5010,That be a bad deal for me considering i get my minnows for free just like all of Clarks regular guests always get.With my minnow privilege yesterday i saved myself probably 70 bucks.Potentially on a 6 day fishing trip that be 420 dollars worth of minnows alone.
6473850,7 Mag,2020-08-13 10:25:00,1887,"Great pictures! Crappies are a lot of fun especially when you're on a good bite, I sure would of enjoyed that."
6473852,prov1800,2020-08-13 10:40:00,5010,Was my first trip this year over to that side of lake.I always love it when they race up and take the jig like they do in winter.Amazing how the see it coming.They would hit the jig in around 10 ft.Fun watching that on the electronics.
6473882,Eckohlt,2020-08-13 12:27:00,3685,"Catching crappies in not so crappy weather,chalk up another fish fry at the Jakob's house,getting to be routine now,we can only drool"
6473918,prov1800,2020-08-13 14:45:00,5010,Picked a good day Rod.Allthough it got to hot.But being solo i can come and go as i please.But yeah that was fun.Fish fry tomorrow when wife comes home.
6473924,Net_Man,2020-08-13 14:47:00,580,"I would guess that your minnows are not free when you fish other lakes such as Eagle or Lac Seul but...... Better than minnows, how about a $1200.00 food and beverage credit at Clark's for you or gas maybe?"
6473934,prov1800,2020-08-13 15:16:00,5010,Your trying hard.When i go to Lac Suel i detour into Clarks and get minnows if iam on any other lake i drive up to clarks(15 min).or sometimes they deliver.
6473940,Eckohlt,2020-08-13 16:12:00,3685,"John it's nice you can pick those great days plus no traffic jam at the boat ramps,matter of fact no traffic anywhere there,enjoy those fresh morsels of fish with the wife yummmmmmm,rod"
