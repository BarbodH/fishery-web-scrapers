6476024,Net_Man,2020-08-20 06:53:00,580,"Some one might get the wrong impression of your thoughts on Clark's with this statement. To clarify here is a recent post of yours. 07-30-2020, 12:14 PM Da' Walleye Assassun I have been to Clark's. I have recommended Clark's on this forum. Do a search. Send them a voluntary donation. Involuntary donations are outright stealing."
6476028,walleyecheek,2020-08-20 07:06:00,2231,dont mention free minnows around Net man......he gets bent outta shape !!!!!!!!
6476044,Net_Man,2020-08-20 07:28:00,580,I hate to have to read all of your previous posts to try and gauge your character. And in the attempt to not be redundant I answered your question on the thread that you asked the question on.....
6476054,Eckohlt,2020-08-20 07:39:00,3685,Maybe I better start a thread about free crawlers

6476184,Net_Man,2020-08-20 13:24:00,580,I have no problem with some one responding to one of my post. But to be clear on this thread I did not make a post about free minnows.
6476196,gaspumper,2020-08-20 13:56:00,73,Clark's should be able to supply free minners with all the money they stole...LOL
6476214,pjshorthorn,2020-08-20 15:04:00,5654,"Yeah, I get it.....you called out ProV1800 on another thread regarding your thoughts about free minnows. It carried over to this thread too....just saying. PjShorthorn"
6345398,Guest,2019-07-29 23:43:00,0,"I second Dabirdman's recommendation of Hidden Bay Lodge. We have fished with several outfitter in the past. But never had the service provided as Hidden Bay did. They dont treat you like a customer but welcome you like family. We discovered them with a google search. We had a truly sensational trip this year. We fished Armit lake. Only cabin on the lake. Maybe a 20 minute flight. The fish were fighting. Great facilities. We were well fed with their food included plan. Thank Wilma for the great pies. Get the strawberry rhubarb! Check them out. Shaggy, yes that is his name, helped us organize our trip. He was on top every question we had. You will not be disappointed."

6344902,jkaup,2019-07-28 14:18:00,56,"Looking for a fly in with walleye fishing. The one thing i'd like to focus on is a short flight on the float plane. Smaller lake, only cabin or only a few small cabins. Northwest ontario or more to the east. Thanks for any recommendations."
6344906,MOfish,2019-07-28 15:21:00,39,Check out Clarks resorts. You won't find a better operation in NW Ontario
6344916,DaBirdman,2019-07-28 15:47:00,164,"Hidden Bay Lodge...fly their own plane (no charter), provide your meals, free night stay before flying out, free satellite phone, some outposts have free wifi. Super nice people, indoor bathrooms, etc. Flights are 24-45min I believe. Armit Lake, Gage Lake or Ragedwood Lake are smallest, easiest to navigate IMO."
