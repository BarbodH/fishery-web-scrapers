Obviously that didn't happen, but while sipping coffee I heard this nice remembrance of Janice Matichuk, a Quetico Provincial Park Ranger, on Minnesota Public Radio. I've never been to Quetico or met the ranger, but she sounds like she loved her work and was a great representative of the park. Hopefully, we will get up to our part of the bush next year.https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/0...-guidance-grit"
