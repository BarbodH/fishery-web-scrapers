6478426,martinbns,2020-08-29 08:31:00,1520,"And we are happy you stayed home, DUI and all."
6356740,pjshorthorn,2019-09-08 08:45:00,5654,"You forgot poutine, maple leaf pennies and Canadian Bacon ( which is really ham BTW) PjShorthorn"
6356742,pjshorthorn,2019-09-08 08:49:00,5654,"It is not that they don't care, they don't know that you even exist. That in itself makes it very hard for Canadians to give a rip about you and your thoughts. But, thanks for sharing your inspirational insight. PjShorthorn"
6356746,David Anderson,2019-09-08 09:07:00,2073,"Not that it matters but in June I stopped at a pharmacy to buy my friend an insulin pen. My wife.........thinking that all medications are cheaper in Canada asked me to look into CBD for her. Of course I knew nothing about it, got the insulin then asked the pharmacist about CBD, he was very helpful but said that it is not available in pharmacy's in Ontario and offered no other options. Since then I have learned you can buy it pretty freely in Minnesota."
6356758,eyecatcher1,2019-09-08 11:25:00,323,"Funny story. My first ever fishing trip to Canada in 1992 was an American Plan trip. We sit down for breakfast the first morning and I order Canadian bacon with my breakfast. I'm in Canada, right? The waitress says ""We only have slab bacon. Canadian bacon is an American thing you're not going to find it up here."" LOL!"
6356774,CI_Guy,2019-09-08 15:10:00,2118,Same thing if you try to order an English muffin in England.
6356790,v-bay gord,2019-09-08 16:12:00,3168,"Canadian bacon is an American thing....probably confusing peameal bacon which is apparently a Canadian thing...Peameal bacon is a type of unsmoked back bacon. It is made from centre-cut pork loin, trimmed of fat, wet-cured in a salt-and-sugar brine and rolled in cornmeal.[5] It can be sliced and cooked on a grill, griddled or fried; or roasted then sliced and served.[6] The brining process makes it nearly impossible to overcook.[7] The low fat content keeps it juicy, and the cornmeal gives it a crispy edge.[8] Cooked peameal bacon has a mild salty-sweet flavour and tastes more like fresh ham (when compared to smoked back bacon or side bacon).[6] The cooked slices have been described as resembling small pork cutlets.[9] It is eaten for breakfast, lunch or dinner,[8] served in slices or as an ingredient in a pork dish.[6] The name peameal comes from the dried yellow peas that were ground into meal and packed around the meat to preserve it in the Victorian era. This has since been replaced by cornmeal, but the original name remains.[6][8] Peameal bacon is rarely found outside of Southern Ontario,[10][11] and is often simply referred to as ""back bacon"". Similarly, a peameal bacon sandwich is often called ""back bacon on a bun"".[12][13] Some Americans refer to peameal bacon as Canadian bacon. However, this should not be confused with Canadian-style bacon or Canadian back bacon, which are terms used by the US-based North American Meat Institute for an American style of smoked back bacon.[10][6] This may be sold in US supermarkets as ""Canadian bacon"", though it is not in any way Canadian.[6][7] Americans use these names to differentiate from what they call American bacon, a US term for side bacon (a.k.a. streaky bacon).[10]"
6358154,PRO-V16,2019-09-13 12:33:00,454,"That happened to me too. Stayed a night at a motel in Thunder Bay years ago. Called and ordered a Canadian Bacon pizza. Long pause on the phone and the guy says ""what's that""? I said I don't know, it's named after you guys. Got a back bacon pizza."
6361016,Northwoodswalleye,2019-09-27 05:53:00,262,Hah that jogged my memory. A few years ago a buddy and I were on dogtooth lake and I wouldn't let him take beer in my boat. Hot and sunny all day. So at dusk we start fishing the last spot before heading in and a boat pulls in next to us (100' max) and I hear the voice of the resort owner ask for a beer. They proceeded to get hammered like the law doesn't apply to Canadians.
6477460,bigwalleye1,2020-08-25 07:37:00,2632,Tell me I can't be the only one wondering how NARDA even crossed the border and was allowed in as a US Citizen...have I missed some border opening announcement????
6477462,Juls,2020-08-25 07:39:00,13414,"Well, if you noticed the date on the thread it's from last year. Spammers brought it back up to the top."
6356502,NARDA 1,2019-09-07 08:10:00,636,I wasn't aware that this would be a problem. Apparently even though it is legal on both sides of the boarder they do not allow you to cross the boarder with it. I had my brand new bottle of CBD Oil confiscated when we crossed at International Falls Wednesday night.
6356562,sagecreek,2019-09-07 14:24:00,24,"by who, , the u s a or Canadian customs? there was a woman from British Columbia had hers siezed by official in Washington state, she was fined over 500 bucks and sent back to Canada telling her she was banned for life from entering the states. after a month of lawyers working on this, the American officials sent her a letter telling her the ban was lifted, don't know if she got her fine money back"
6356568,That Minnesota guy,2019-09-07 15:00:00,8293,Just be thankful they didn't get your jug of Rye.
6356652,CI_Guy,2019-09-07 17:55:00,2118,Met a group from NoDak in Sioux Lookout that had some confiscated from them by Canadian customs. Hope the woman got her fine back.
6356676,KC Walleye,2019-09-07 19:41:00,274,"If I am being honest, you should have researched this heavily before attempting this. It seems pretty obvious that Canada and the US have some serious aversions to this. Crossing from the US in to Canada, the Canadians still don't allow transport of Cannabis across the border.....and Canadians view any CBD-oil as Cannabis.... and transport of it across the border could be considered a serious offense. You are lucky to just have had it confiscated. No detainment, fines, arrest/charges. If ever a question, just call and ask someone a few simple questions. Border crossing officials have been very helpful when I have called in the past."
6356688,97roughneck,2019-09-07 20:38:00,899,"Personally, my goal is to stay out of Canada for the rest of my life. Yes, I know they don't care. Their pick and choose method of enforcing their laws is just ridiculous. Get turned away at one point of entry, drive to the next one and you are allowed to pass. And their reason for denying entry because of a past DWI, give me a break. All the Canadians I've ever met were beer alcoholics. I don't believe they never drive drunk in Canada. The whole gig is sketchy. Plenty of walleyes in the USA. They can keep their Mounties, the black flies and their snotty attitudes. BTW, I'm a proponent of CBD oil, I take it daily. When I travel, it goes with me, which is another reason for me to stay out of Canada."
6356706,Upnorth1085,2019-09-08 04:45:00,7,Or you can just buy it up here.
6356710,v-bay gord,2019-09-08 06:32:00,3168,"Don't forget the Queen, igloo's, free health care, and Justin...."
6356724,Huntindave,2019-09-08 07:30:00,2194,"You have the Queen, we have Bobby,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, wanna trade???"
6356736,NARDA 1,2019-09-08 08:22:00,636,"It was Canada Customs. No fine or anything, just took about 20 minutes to fill out paperwork and I was on my way."
