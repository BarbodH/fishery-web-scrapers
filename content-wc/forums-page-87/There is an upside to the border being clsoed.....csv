6476950,walleyecheek,2020-08-23 11:21:00,2231,yeah all the traffic (fisher people) they've had this summer its probably all fished out !!!!!
6476862,Pooch,2020-08-22 18:42:00,4618,"I still have three grand in my pocket and four thousand less miles on my truck. Over the past two weeks instead of fishing, we have dropped and split a sixty foot Oak and a sixty foot Hickory tree for fire wood. Demolished and burnt a decrepit two car garage, Moved well over two hundred tons of fill prepping the sight for a new pole building. Raced four weekends that I would have missed. Wife is happy as I've torn out sick bushes from our landscaping and repaired a stone wall around our mailbox after a young gal ran off the road while texting and ran into it destroying the stone wall supporting it.So all is not lost. Yes, I'd much rather be fishing and pain for the lodge owners, but life goes on.Hoping for a banner 2021 for everyone.Pooch"
6476868,Eckohlt,2020-08-22 19:18:00,3685,"Keep working like that it will kill ya,then no fishing and the wife will have that 3 grand and the truck and the sale from your fishing stuff"

6476898,Pooch,2020-08-23 05:31:00,4618,"Used to take three trips a year spending over thirty days on the water in Canada. Cut it back to just two trips for now. If you figure your up and back fuel, couple nights in a motel, food, bait (no free minnows...), etc. then a week in camp with your own boat is an easy grand each trip. If you add in your actual boat expenses like insurance, routine maintenance, license plates and (mostly unneeded) ""upgrades"" then it would most likely be over a thousand bucks a trip. Other than wanting to fish out of our own boats, there is no logical reason to owning a boat just to fish Canada. It is the proverbial hole in the water, but like most folks I enjoy fishing out of my own boat and so far mine has never been in any water other than Canada. I've not claimed to be smart... Pooch"
6476906,RichA$1970,2020-08-23 05:58:00,1159,"I’m on the same page as you, I get a kick out some of these $4000 per trip adventures that I think they must bait your hook for you."
6476920,Eckohlt,2020-08-23 07:08:00,3685,RichA under 700 if we can just get there 10-10-20
6476924,Eckohlt,2020-08-23 07:11:00,3685,Right now I would fish in any kind of boat if I could get the hel across
