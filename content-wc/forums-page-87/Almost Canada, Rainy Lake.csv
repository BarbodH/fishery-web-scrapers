Can run shallow drive and use trolling motor. Anyone know if I can get a boat around the confluence of the rivers? With 3 trips to Canada cancelled, I'm trying to get creative. Mike"

If the river is runnable further up stream it is wide open to run any type of boat you want for the last 1/4 mile. Why not just fish the rainy. Put in at the Big Fork or Pelland (Little Fork) and go from there. Good walleye, SMB and a bonus of Lake Sturgeon."
