6471876,eyecatcher1,2020-08-06 17:24:00,323,"Since I'm usually up there two or three times a year I buy the three year license. I called since this in my middle year, but they said no refund since I can't prove that I didn't use it before the border shut down or after if it ever does open in 2020."
6473558,WalleyeTherapy,2020-08-12 09:15:00,49,I had also purchased annual non-resident in January for 3 trips this year. I sent an email to MNRF explaining purchase and inquiring if refunds were available. My license fee was refunded within a couple weeks.

6474978,Mr Ranger,2020-08-17 09:17:00,272,"Just got my annual license refunded. It took 8 weeks but I found them to be very prompt, polite and accurate as to how long it would take."
6475010,eyecatcher1,2020-08-17 11:53:00,323,Has anyone with a three year license received a refund for one year of it?
6455468,eyecatcher1,2020-06-23 07:31:00,323,We don't need a license in Canada if we're 65?
6455498,Donscs,2020-06-23 08:20:00,379,"Here's what I don' get, on waters that share Canadian and American borders you are not allowed to cross and go fishing when you don't touch land. Not sure what the Science is behind that decision. This spring on the Detroit River Canadian law enforcement was telling Americans to go back on the US side of the border giving them a warning the first time and telling them they could be ticketed. Haven't heard of US law enforcement doing the same but it may have happened just haven't heard about it. If anyone thinks you can sneak across and touch land on the Detroit or St. Clair rivers and not get caught I wouldn't try it, there are cameras everywhere monitored by law enforcement. Also, I don't know of a single fisherman who heads out on the water and crosses the border and wants to go on land when out fishing for the day, it wastes too much time. Back in the day prior to GPS, and those of us that remember the Loran C, it was very difficult to tell just where the border was when out on the water. Maybe if my GPS malfunctions I can use that as an excuse if I end up in Canadian water so that I can use my nonresident fishing license I purchased back in January. Another stupid restriction that makes no sense, but what do you expect from the Government."
6455518,v-bay gord,2020-06-23 08:34:00,3168,Only if you are a resident.
6455522,v-bay gord,2020-06-23 08:37:00,3168,There is still a border whether it's on land or water.
6455590,eyecatcher1,2020-06-23 10:53:00,323,"Thanks! That's what I was thinking. In Minnesota it used to be 65, but I guess we're living too long because it was changed to 90. I do get a free trout stamp though."
6455598,eyecatcher1,2020-06-23 10:59:00,323,I lived in Michigan until 1984 and used to fish Lake St Clair a lot. Back then as long as we had a Canadian fishing license we were ok to fish anywhere on the lake. We could keep a Canadian limit of walleyes too.
6456760,jimmartin705,2020-06-25 16:32:00,1,"I bought an 8 day license in January for use in June. I sent an email to [email protected] and requested a refund. They said since my license was purchased so long ago they could not issue a credit to my credit card but they would send me a check for the full amount. Below is a copy of the full response I received. RESPONSE------ Hello, Thank you for your email. A refund can be submitted for consideration. Since your purchase was over 3 months ago you will receive the refund, once approved, in the form of a cheque. Cheque processing is currently taking longer than our usual 6 to 8 weeks so we are unable to provide a date when you will receive a refund. Your current 8 day sports fishing for June 6th to the 13th will be invalidated. If you require further assistance please contact one of our representatives at the toll free numbers below. We are currently in our peak season. Call volumes are typically higher early in the week, particularly after the weekend. The best time to reach us is Monday-Friday at 8:30am EST. Callers may receive busy signals and disconnects because of the call volume.

6456776,RichA$1970,2020-06-25 16:57:00,1159,So will the extend the 3 year Canada Card if the season is a wash?
6471838,dhottle,2020-08-06 14:52:00,163,I called the 1-800-387-7011 number for Ontario today & requested a refund for my annual non-resident license purchased 2/22020. They verified the info & requested the last four digits of my credit card. She said because of the high volume it would take a few weeks but i would get a full refund. So the answer is they will rebate your license purchase.
6471840,RichA$1970,2020-08-06 14:58:00,1159,Will they extend the Canada Card for another year as mine expires this year?
6454330,walleyecheek,2020-06-20 10:52:00,2231,If it was nothing to Ontario......then why charge us at all ? LOL........

6454410,RichA$1970,2020-06-20 14:02:00,1159,I think you have a better shot of hoping the border opens vs a refund from the government
6454434,v-bay gord,2020-06-20 15:20:00,3168,"Fishing license $ are supposed to go to fish and game programs.....so, congratulations on making your donation to a good cause!"
6454526,Net_Man,2020-06-20 21:33:00,580,I feel your pain but if this is the worst that you get shafted in your lifetime then you will have been a lucky man.
6454826,Lmbkiller,2020-06-21 20:03:00,639,Never buy your license til basically u are on your way up or very near departure
6454874,cuamb,2020-06-22 05:27:00,203,I seem to have a knack for doing the wrong thing when buying my license. This year I bought the season license early. A couple of years ago I just bought the week license and ended up going on 2 extra unplanned trips and bought 3 weekly licenses. In the grand scheme of things it is such a small percentage of the cost of the trip.
6454878,Shellback,2020-06-22 05:40:00,8083,"I'm assuming the license fees go to fish and game depts. I'd have to think that is a nice chunk of change for them. As far as the whole Ontario budget, it is peanuts."
6455172,RichA$1970,2020-06-22 14:53:00,1159,Good luck on getting that donation back.
6455454,v-bay gord,2020-06-23 06:59:00,3168,Join the club. This year I bought a 3 year license. Next year when I turn 65 I won't need a license. Duh!
6454116,dhottle,2020-06-19 16:40:00,163,So I purchased my annual Ontario license in January for a trip to Rainy Lake scheduled for May. You all know how that went. I talked to the owner & rescheduled our trip for September. If that doesn't happen my annual license purchased as a non resident will go down the toilet unused. Do you think the Ontario License Dept might allow us non residents to use our 2020 license for 2021 since the border closing denied us use of our license we paid for in good faith? Might the Canadian government cut us some slack? What do you guys think?
6454122,NARDA 1,2020-06-19 17:12:00,636,All you can do is ask. Good luck!
6454132,The tank,2020-06-19 17:28:00,340,Wish in one hand and you know in the other. Good luck.
6454138,Eckohlt,2020-06-19 17:42:00,3685,"U bought in January they might assume you used your license doing some ice fishing in Ontario,I wouldn't hurry to go to the mail box everyday looking for a refund"
6454206,johnboat,2020-06-19 22:29:00,2014,"Short answer......No.Same thing happened to me. I was up in January for some hunting and ice fishing and bought a annual license to save a few bucks when I go back for the Annual Spring trip. I'm still hoping for September, but if not, I'll chalk it up to one of the many coin flips in life I lose."
6454222,Shellback,2020-06-20 05:31:00,8083,"Thinking about outfitters losing money, I wonder how much Canada will lose in non resident license fees? Gotta be a big part of their income."
6454234,eyecatcher1,2020-06-20 06:02:00,323,I buy a three year license and this is the second year. I doubt it will be extended a year if I can't get up there this year.
6454280,martinbns,2020-06-20 08:18:00,1520,Less than peanuts. Non-resident license fees are basically nothing to the Province of Ontario.
6454296,LoDo,2020-06-20 09:21:00,721,"Its going to take 12 months for Canada to really feel the blow. The blow is going to come in tax revenue, or lack there of. The amount of money Canada receives in tax revenue from small business is going to sting. It hasnt hit yet, but their small biz and citizens will really feel it 12 months from now."
6454304,martinbns,2020-06-20 09:29:00,1520,"Our Small Business owners are already feeling it big time. My comment was about license fees, tiny amount of money in the grand scheme of thingsSent from my SM-G965W using Tapatalk"
