Daniel (owner) was kind enough to help take some of the new crew out to show them around the lake which worked out as I gained 2 new spots. Weather was perfect in the upper 70's, mid 80's but windy the first few days. This made it difficult to vertical jig/ back troll on the North and South reefs. Fire island, Gnat Island and a few spots around Moose Island were all producing solid numbers. 3/8"" jigs with 5"" Kalins Smoke twisters produced the best in 22 FOW. On Monday my sister, buddy Dave and I made the 3 hour trip into Lost Lake. Lost Lake is a triple portage requiring pulling the motor and gear off at the 3rd portage and dragging the boat through the rapids. Water levels were ideal and using past knowledge, we brought a chainsaw to remove dead falls in the way. We caught 130 walleye in 4 hours including a really fat 26"". Well worth the effort!! It was a very difficult ride back due to 25 MPH winds and 3-4' swells in the main basin. The reef on South Roderick, when feasible for our techniques, produced the best fishing. We caught hundreds of walleye in the 20-24"" range and a few nice pike on occasion. Lightning point produced several lakers. Biggest Pike; 38.5"" Biggest Walleye; 29.25"" Biggest Lake Trout- 27 (all 4 of them were roughly the same size) The new cabins were beautiful, almost ""too"" nice! With the docks being moved to the other side, there is a huge beach right out front with a gentle slope. What an improvement! As usual we had a perfect week of weather, friendship and fishing. Nearly everyone in the group put deposits down for 2021! .... Or that is how it would've gone"

Called it our ""2020 virtual Canada trip"". I started the day we should have been in camp and ended today as it would have been our last day in camp. It was interesting to go through hundreds of images in yearly folders from each years trip. Not the same as actually fishing, but it lightly salves the disappointment a (very) tiny bit. The only downside was it put into perspective how many of our friends have passed away over the past few years. Ouch...Pooch"
