6476602,Net_Man,2020-08-21 12:41:00,580,"A clarification request - after I give up my wife for Canada fishing, would I be allowed to find a girlfriend??"
6476654,Guest,2020-08-21 16:09:00,0,You would not only be allowed but encouraged. A smart man is always on the lookout because you know she is
6476658,Guest,2020-08-21 16:12:00,0,"As they say, ""We are all just a guy like Mike Borger coming along from being single"" No comment on Mike's ethics but more a comment on his dashing good looks, big wallet, and fishing prowess"
6477464,bigwalleye1,2020-08-25 07:43:00,2632,"That's too easy a choice. Make it difficult....You can fish every day in Canada but have to stay with your wife or girlfriend, or you can never fish in Canada and give them up....."
6475252,Husker525,2020-08-18 07:28:00,720,Must be related to mine..............
6475278,BornToFish,2020-08-18 08:24:00,1224,"Greetings, I'm pretty fortunate in that my wife enjoys fishing. She routinely fishes with me from after breakfast until supper time. She rarely ever asks me for help while in the boat (e.g. taking a fish off the hook) or complains about the weather or bugs. We enjoy each other's company in the boat, sometimes talking and sometimes just enjoying the silence. My wife rarely goes out with me any more in the morning before breakfast. We typically meet at the lodge for coffee before breakfast. She seldom goes out for the evening bite. While I am typically out on the lake after supper, my wife is content with taking a bath and enjoying a glass of wine on the deck while reading one of her books or talking to a friend. I'm happy with the above arrangement and she is as well. I much prefer fishing with my wife than many guys. One of the interesting things about my wife is that I get along fantastically well with my mother-in-law as well! Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6475356,wmd,2020-08-18 10:49:00,388,"wait..... she probably doesn't, but there are a number of us that know her. She is a very nice lady. wmd"
6475510,stjoeguy,2020-08-18 17:52:00,979,She reminded me that the only thing I know how to cook is fried fish and I might get tired of that. Best I don't rock the boat and stick around as long as she'll have me!
6475514,tandm,2020-08-18 18:22:00,679,Has she ever been to America?
6475622,Guest,2020-08-19 04:28:00,0,Closest my girlfriend has ever been to America is a sandals all inclusive resort in Jamaica. I am planning on breaking the news to my wife and see if I can get the three of us to head up to Sturgis next year on my Hog with a trailer. Seating arrangements might be a little rough
6475626,tv4fish,2020-08-19 04:38:00,2694,"Yes - please be SURE and let us know how that goes for ya'............OH - I forgot to ask --- Does your girlfriend have other girl friends with similar ""ideas/desires"".........................??????????? You can just send me their name(s) via a PM....."
6476318,PRO-V16,2020-08-20 19:40:00,454,I would say microtool would lose his wife and would never be able to afford Canada after that.

6475124,Guest,2020-08-17 19:41:00,0,If you had two choices. You could either fish every day in Canada and give up your girlfriend boyfriend or wife or both. Are you had to remain with your girlfriend boyfriend wife are both and could never fish in Canada which would you choose? I know I would say bye-bye to both my wife and girlfriend
6475128,stjoeguy,2020-08-17 19:45:00,979,Wait...does my wife know my Walleye Central password?
6475146,BornToFish,2020-08-17 20:32:00,1224,"Greetings, I am fortunate to have the best of both worlds, as my wife enjoys fishing in NW Ontario as much as I do! Thus, I don't have to make the choice referenced by the original poster. I tell my wife from time to time that I am considering picking up a new rod, reel, lure or whatever. Her usual response to me is that I should pick up two of them right away so that she has one too. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6475152,Guest,2020-08-17 20:40:00,0,She sounds like a real keeper.
6475168,LoDo,2020-08-17 22:17:00,721,Hilarious thread!!
6475178,dschiebel,2020-08-18 00:40:00,85,"As long as I can keep my yellow lab, I will be good."
6475190,kzoofisher,2020-08-18 03:22:00,5144,I like my wife. I would give up sex to fish every day but not my wife.
6475192,Eckohlt,2020-08-18 03:26:00,3685,"I think my wife loves Ontario more than me,,she knows how to get'er done on the fish so I'm hoping she doesn't dump me and move up there"
6475204,tv4fish,2020-08-18 05:05:00,2694,Micro: For your sake ----- I sure hope that BOTH your wife and girlfriend don't see your post............gonna be lonely.............
