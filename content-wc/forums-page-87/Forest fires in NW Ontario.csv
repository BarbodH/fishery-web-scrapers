6474770,EleVader,2020-08-16 16:14:00,6,Hey Shoutout to any of the camps that may have helped out with people being displaced by the fires. The silver lining being sometimes your there for a reason. Kudos for welcoming in people that may have had no place to go. Doubt they'll ever forget it.
6474824,Tbayfisher,2020-08-16 18:52:00,31,"Got the call today, back to work for Wednesday , fire happened on my scheduled week off. Left the boat behind as well. Lucky everyone and everything is alright."
6474874,LoDo,2020-08-16 21:05:00,721,"High fives to all the first responders, medical, fire, pilots, camp owners and all those who helped. Mother nature was also a big help! Open the 105 and get everyone back home safe."
6473346,Stringbean,2020-08-11 14:46:00,279,"I checked the Facebook page from the camp that we were supposed to go this year. Red Lake was given the order to evacuate last night. The fire is located on HWY 618 which goes to Madsen. The first reports were that the fire was only a couple acres. Then it got out of hand quickly. Water bombers have been dumping water all day long.On the map that I used, there is also another fire on Manitoba Point in Lac Seul. There is also a new fire north of Sioux Lookout on one of the islands where you turn to go north after passing through the Rags. This must be one of those summers where it is extremely dry."
6473372,prov1800,2020-08-11 15:53:00,5010,"Bas√¨cally its always dry here.Even when it rains ground just absorbs it.We always have fires burning all summer.Most in areas that arent near big populations.This fire in Red Lake is to close for comfort.We also have high winds right now so not helping the situation.Tomorrow winds slow down a bit so hopefully theyll get it under control a bit.Sounds like most people are out and safe at a lot of tourist camps that got cabins opened up fast.Sime headed to Thunder Bay ,Dryden and Kenora.Pretty nice the other communities help out."
6473428,Tbayfisher,2020-08-11 19:41:00,31,"I was working at the madsen m e when the fire broke out, very close. We were having coffee when the foreman came in and told us t evacuate. Back at Chikuni river campground I was sleeping , then told to the order was given to evacuate red lake.i have great video as we left work and drove beside the fire."
6473456,bbheli,2020-08-11 21:33:00,1387,"oh my, please be safe. When will 2020 bring and end to all this bad."
6473766,Stringbean,2020-08-13 06:06:00,279,The weather forecast for today calls for strong thunderstorms along with winds from the southeast. Let's just hope that the rainfall will set the fire back so the firefighters can slow the spread of the fire. I just checked the weather radar. The smoke from the fire shows up on the radar. Check it out for yourself: https://fox11online.com/weather/radar
6473862,Pooch,2020-08-13 11:09:00,4618,"The only downside of thunderstorms is more lightning strikes. The fires caused by lightning probably don't show up for several days. Guessing that they just linger in the damp peat until they build enough heat to get going and self sustain. At least that has been my observation over the years. Below is a picture from many years ago on Birch Lake, ON. A few days before we got to camp (fly in) there had been a peach of a thunderstorm go through. Couple days later this happened. There was a fire on the other end of the lake that we called in and then the next day we were in the cabin eating lunch when we spotted light smoke across the lake from the cabin. So several of us jumped in boats with brooms and shovels and went to work on it until the MNR guys got there with pumps. Yes, we were glad to see them and they couldn't believe that a few old farm country firefighters could do with just the basics to hold the fire from spreading. If you think you are a tough guy and in good shape... do what they do. Back then we were young, great physical shape and all making a living doing physical work and still we were pooped out after a couple hours until the MNR arrived. Pooch"

6474536,Stringbean,2020-08-15 17:44:00,279,"Great news! After checking with Ministry fire officials, the mayor of Red Lake reported that the fire is now 100% contained. He just asked that the evacuees please be patient as the infrastructure in the city is being brought back to normal. https://www.ckdr.net/2020/08/15/202356/"
6474674,LoDo,2020-08-16 09:54:00,721,Mother Nature!! Hearing 4-5 days to get natural gas back to 100%.
