6477134,fishin779,2020-08-24 06:17:00,63,"I agree, wholeheartedly !! I had planned on staying most of the summer in a cabin near Sioux Narrows, first time in 35 years that I haven't made at least 3 trips to the great NW Ontario !"
6477152,rosh1,2020-08-24 07:06:00,275,Its been really hard on my wife and I. She took early retirement last year so we could spend more time this year then last. Started with my daughter having surgery in feb. so missed that ice trip. Then our 2 week ice trip in march border was closed. She has really missed it and has been bummed. Got my new boat in feb. and don't think I have 1hr on big motor. That sucks! So from 4 months plus to zero is tough. Thank God for great friends mowing and looking after our cottage. Hope it opens by dec. so at least can get a wolf hunt in. Sure miss bear season. Only good thing I got more thing done on farm to be ready for deer season. Take care.

Symptoms include occasional irritability, selective OCD with tackle re-arrangement, lake and road map fixation, and unnecessary duplicate meal re-planning. Rx includes deposit rollover, prolonged waiting, and fishing marginal U.S lakes."

6477250,10lbeye,2020-08-24 11:37:00,61,Thanks--made me laugh when I thought of it ...then cry a bit...all a part of the disorder pattern.
6477264,Husker525,2020-08-24 11:57:00,720,"When Covid hit, I lost my job. Did 2 months of honey do's in about 1 week, then bored to tears. I would have actually fished every day in my boat if I could. I tried to cheat the system but was not smart enough to keep from getting caught. You could only go out 3 times a week, and had to stay within 10 miles of your home. I have a small lake 5 miles within my range, but they would keep catching me fishing more than the 3 allowed days in a 7 day period. I then left in the middle of the night to go to lakes in my state. That worked well until the State Patrol and local Sheriff's Officers were out on midnight patrol, run my plate, find my address, and let me know I was in violation. Our 1 month quarantine rolled into a 2nd month with a little less restriction, which helped. I then rolled the dice, and started just travelling in the middle of the night, taking back roads, and going out of state. No issues then. Like a junkie searching for China white, mission accomplished. My attitude was so much better after than, and no more fatigue."
6477300,DaBirdman,2020-08-24 13:51:00,164,"What I like most is being up north among the woods, smelling the pine, hearing loons, fishing big water. I got all of this on our northern MN trip. So I didn't miss Canada all that much (been going over 40yrs). The parts I did miss were the quietness and solitude, but otherwise each of my hopes and desires were met, including catching fish."
6477326,kettyspanky,2020-08-24 15:40:00,271,My son and I and a friend went to northern Michigan for a couple days to get our fix. It was okay but not the same as Canada. It's so nice to get above the border with no cell service and no worries. The fun with family and friends and catching fish up there is fun. Hopefully next year is a go because I got a couple newbies to commit. Next year we better be able to go. Fingers crossed.

6476958,schoolofhardknocks,2020-08-23 11:46:00,29,"Hi All, I happen to be an avid fly-in fisherman (2 trips a year) into remote regions on the various camp's beloved Beavers or Otters. After 40 years (I'm 70 now), I start looking forward to these around February or March, get a tiny fix going to the Sportsman's Show in April and then start the glorious process of opening up all my bins and getting ready for my first fly in as soon as the ice is out. I admit, I always buy new things that I don't need, but ****, it's fun and Amazon has made it way too easy to get the newest and the latest. Some my ""fun starts in Winter when I start thinking about it, gets into gear in Spring when I tangibly organize what I ""need"" and then builds as I drive up the familiar route to the border and beyond. Im' like a little kid as my excitement builds, getting to the outfitter, loading up on the dock, and the glorious feeling of watching and listening as that plane takes off and it is just me, my wife or son on the entire lake. I've often thought, that dying there certainly is preferable to a memory care center. Sometimes I go completely alone. Some of you may remember on one of my solos a few years ago I contracted Hanta Virus (and thanks for all your support on this list-serve). I happen to be a Licensed Psychologist, still doing some therapy and I was unbelievably surprised by how ""down"" I got when ""Canada"" was cancelled. I knew it was an important part of my recreation, but hadn't guessed just how important those trips were. No doubt about it, I was suffering from NDD (Nature Deficit Disorder). Wonder how many of you have realized the same about yourselves as it relates to these trips. In the meantime, I purchased a 5 acre lake lot NEAR the border on a decent and (somewhat private) lake. I still plan on going to Ontario. Let's face it, Minnesota fishing is a completely different experience from remote Ontario."

There seems to be no alternate cure, which can be both a curse and a blessing, depending on fulfillment. Paraphrasing The Eagles: You can check out, but you can never leave""! Bill"
6476964,walleyecheek,2020-08-23 12:23:00,2231,There's a cure.......just move up there......thats what i plan on doing after i retire !
6476966,Eckohlt,2020-08-23 12:33:00,3685,"Can you buy a big enough cabin so I can join you once in awhile,actually more than once in awhile"
6476972,bthomas3333,2020-08-23 12:49:00,465,As a guy who usually works two jobs to pay for my Canada trips this is especially painful since I did the 60 hour weeks (3000 hrs last year) and didn't get the reward of the three + trips. The money really doesn't do it for me without the ability to spend it doing what I love. I am just hoping 2021 allows us to travel.Brett
6476980,walleyecheek,2020-08-23 14:07:00,2231,simple.....just do 6+ trips next year ? .........that is if the border opens ?
6476996,bthomas3333,2020-08-23 14:59:00,465,LOL My wife said that at one point then backed off that idea really quick. Six trips sounds good to me:-) From a practical point it doesn't really work so well. Maybe 5....lolB-
6477008,Eckohlt,2020-08-23 16:13:00,3685,All's I know I'm going to get a lot of frequent flyer miles next year in Ontario
6477068,prov1800,2020-08-23 20:15:00,5010,I hope you guys all realize that i really feel sorry for you all.Its really getting boring out on the lakes here without you all.lol.
6477110,Eckohlt,2020-08-24 04:18:00,3685,"John do you realize how sry we feel for you out there fishing alone all the time,must be terrible,maybe you should stay home much safer there lol"
