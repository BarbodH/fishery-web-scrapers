6462102,Windermere,2020-07-09 19:25:00,23,"We recently finished our delayed opening week 6/27  7/4. This was our first week we were allowed to be open. We had 12 guests (normally about 60+) and we thought we would give an update on how the fishing was for the week. The bite started out strong for the beginning of the week with the mayfly hatch just beginning. By Monday, the mayfly hatch was in full swing and the temperatures were hot! With that being said, fishing slowed. Surface temperatures at the docks were reaching as high as 83F. Later in the week, temperatures began to drop and the mayfly hatch slowed and the guests said the fishing picked up again. Surface water temperatures also dropped to about 77F. This past week's fishing - several walleye in the upper 20's were caught and released but we did not break the 30. Several pike in the mid 30's but none broke the 36, but we did have a couple stories of the monster pike snatching the small fish on the line as it neared the boat. But no matter how many times it is told in a week, the excitement is the same and you never get tired or hearing it! Sondra and I also went fishing twice this past week. Believe it or not, this was the first time we fished Windermere in 4 years and the most we have fished in last 6 years together. Our fish fry consisted of 2 walleye and 2 bass (we kept the 14ers as it is our preferred size) which we greatly enjoyed. We are thrilled we are able to operate as it was getting pretty depressing setting at home waiting and not knowing if we were going to be able to open camp for 2020. Things are different and it is not the same social distancing constantly sanitizing and wearing of masks while interacting with guests it makes it much harder. One of the best things about camp life is being able to talk and share with guests on an individual basis. This is one thing that we miss and we hope this will not be a future trend. On a personal note, we are being very positive about this very slow year. As we have shared with our guests, in regards to our outlook this is our 18 year vacation and we are taking this time to work on projects and plan on fishing more. We have owned and operated Happy Day Lodge since 2003 and Prairie Bee Outposts since 2011. We have received lots of concerning calls on how the COVID-19 is going to affect our business and family. We are doing fine and as some may know our past, before we became camp operators, as both of us had farming in our background and operated a small family farm before our first season in 2003. As a farmers you have really good years and every once in a while you will have a very bad year and 2020 for camp owners is that drought year. Some of you may remember years ago, a lot of farmers struggled during the major drought. They had Farm Aid where people had fund raisers and concerts to raise money for the small family farmers. My only point is we do hope Ontario government does come in and help tourist camp owners during this time of need. Camp owners are enduring some hard times at no fault of theirs with the border and travel restrictions in place. I know there are some that say that people should be more prepared for emergencies. Trust us, not everyone can have the golden parachute during tough times because of circumstances unforeseen and some very good owners are struggling during this time and our thoughts and prayers are with all of them! Let us all keep our thoughts and prayers for everyone's families and friends, guests and for all the camp owners, during these difficult times. We want everyone to know we miss you not because of the revenue you bring but we miss you as our family of friends. You're not just a guest, you are our fishing family and we hope all is well. Our hope now is to look forward to catching up with everyone during the 2021 season!!!! We really look forward to this reunion in 2021. Be safe, don't forget, or give up on us camp owners, and the GREATEST FISHING AREA AND EXPERIENCE AROUND!!!! Bob"
