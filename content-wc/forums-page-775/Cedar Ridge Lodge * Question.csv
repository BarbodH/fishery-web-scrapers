(North of North Bay) If any of you have stayed up at this lodge, would you let me know what you think of the accommodations and fishing ? Their website looks good and they say they're the only lodge on this lake. Any comments good or otherwise would be appreciated....am looking for a good, clean camp/lodge where I can get into decent walleye and pike fishing within a day's drive of East Central Ohio. I know Western Ontario has some great fishing though two long days up and then back again is too much driving for a week's trip this year. Thanks, RB"
