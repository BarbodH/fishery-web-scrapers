545593,Fishful Thinker,2005-02-06 07:55:00,100,I believe this walleye was an ice fishing world record.
545599,Larry L,2005-02-06 13:04:00,335,I would think you are right about it being the ice fishing record. A few years ago one was pulled through the ice on Boysen Resivoir in Wyoming. It was 17 plus and was called the ice fishing record at the time. I saw a mount of it earlier this year. Impressive fish. Larry
545601,Guest,2005-02-06 13:38:00,0,"whoa, think of all the fillets that guy is going to have. I once slabbed a 34incher (13pounds) and didn't have to buy food for my dog for over a year."
545611,Guest,2005-02-06 22:13:00,0,"You must have a pretty small dog,mine would eat that in one sitting. I was up at LOW when that Tobin fish was caught,there were pictures all over the taverns up there."
545498,Guest,2005-02-02 07:33:00,0,"Apparently the world record wally was caught at Tobin lake Sask. around xmas time, something like 18 or 20 lbs, thru the ice by a priest."
545508,Guest,2005-02-02 11:07:00,0,"Not a world record, maybe a Provincial or Canadian record. World record is 22lbs 11oz from Greers Ferry, Arkansas."
545513,Northern Manitoban,2005-02-02 13:48:00,195,Funny how the wrong stories go around.One rumour was it was from Ontario. It is only a Saskatchewan Provincial record just over 18 pounds nice fish I have some photo's posted on my website. There's talk that its the biggest Walleye ever caught through the ice. But I don't think that should qualify as a world record I think it should be the same whether its open water or ice caught as then that should open up different things like line class for open water and for through the ice.

545516,bigfish1965,2005-02-02 15:33:00,3210,Canadian Record was caught in the Niagara River and was 22 pounds and change.
545519,Guest,2005-02-02 20:06:00,0,As I stated earlier the AGFC shocked up one bigge than the record recently.
545521,Larry S,2005-02-02 21:08:00,666,The World Record Walleye is 25lbs plus from Kentucky or Tennessee
545522,Guest,2005-02-03 02:11:00,0,"The TN ""world record"" was disqualified based on a photo of the fish, that showed that the walleye would have weighed around 15 pounds. The measurements that was given by the fisherman that caught the walleye would have a calculated weight of over 40 pounds."
545524,Guest,2005-02-03 07:18:00,0,"Rumor is that a new world record Walleye was caught around Stockton, Illinois. It seems that a local car repair shop owner caught a monster Walleye while he was bobber fishing for carp off of his pontoon boat. The Walleye pulled him off the back of his pontoon into the water but luckily the water was only about two foot deep so it wasnt over his head....it was only up to his chin."
545548,Guest,2005-02-04 10:39:00,0,"Yeah, I kinda thought it wasn't a WORLD record when i heard about it and saw on TV, but seems to me thats what they claimed?"
545555,Pikeman,2005-02-04 15:09:00,93,"The fish is definetly a Sask. record walleye, that has been confirmed. Some articles say that they will be looking into it to see if it is an ice fishing world record. As of right now however, it is only the Saskatchewan overall walleye record.
