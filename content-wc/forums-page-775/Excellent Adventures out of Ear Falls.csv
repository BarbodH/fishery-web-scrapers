545614,Guest,2005-02-07 06:21:00,0,I have used them for about 5 years. They run a excellent operation and even have a lodge on Trout Lake which they purchased this past year. Cat Island Lodge is were I have been going since the mid 90's and can't say enough good about it. Faron and Joyce are very people orientated and will do anything for you give them a call.
545638,Guest,2005-02-07 19:14:00,0,"we've done two trips with them to conifer (lake trout lake) and brownstone lake (in order to access shearstone - which is no longer an option) and would recommend faron and joyce very highly. i think they have some new lakes that look very interesting - just too many lakes and not enough time. as a note, faron has a number of boat cache lakes that you can fly into for the day where ""the fishin' is like it used to be"". we went to rainfall lake and did excellent and i heard that zinzania is great also. give em a try. - phish"
545674,Guest,2005-02-09 05:00:00,0,How was the walleye fishing on Brownstone? Is live bait a necessity? Would a guide be needed for a first trip or is a marked map enough for an experieced walleye angler? Do you know anytrhing about Hailstone or Papaongo? Thanks for any information.
545683,Guest,2005-02-09 18:14:00,0,"clem - frankly, i would not go to brownstone for walleye. we did a 10 day trip to brownstone but spent most every day at shearstone and had truly world class walleye and pike. the few days we spent on brownstone were extreemly dissappointing and i would not recommend this lake. a qualifier - this was 4-5 years ago and things may have gotten better with the slot limits taking effect. ask faron for the names of two groups who were there last year about the same time and contact them. i've heard that papago is pretty good - but there's another cabin on the relatively small lake, and the hailstone was just OK. again ask faron for some references - he's very good about doing this as he's very proud of his ""products"". i almost booked one of his other lakes, headwaters, since he opened a portage to a brand new lake there and you also have access to cobham lake. just too many lakes and not enought time. phish"
