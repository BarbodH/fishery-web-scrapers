My Dad didn't like the portage that we had to take everyday from delany lake to the english river, also the fishing hours we way to restrictive. We got fishing around 9:00am and we had to be back to the dock at 4:30pm, the guides would usually take 2 hrs for shorelunch, so that doesn't leave much fishing time. My dad found Happy Landing Lodge on pipestone and Yoke lake at the mpls sportshow 4 years ago and we have been going ever since. They have six species, new boats and motors and really nice cabins, also the price is about the same I think. You can go to there site at www.happylandingfishing.com If you happen to call them make sure you ask for dylan for a guide, I have fished with him every year."
