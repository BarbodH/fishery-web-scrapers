545677,Brax,2005-02-09 09:57:00,52,"I was asking IF it was legal. Now that I know it is not, I will not try. I do everything I can to stay within the laws of the area I am in. I too went to D&E minnows last year and must say that is the best place I have ever bought bait. It's just this year I will be staying farther south. It will be about a 20+ mile ride to Ear Falls. Well looks like I will need to make one trip up there and try and buy enough minnows for the whole week. I do take a flat of worms with me so it's tuff to estimate how many minnows I will need."
545550,Brax,2005-02-04 13:22:00,52,"I was wondering if it was legal to set your own minnow trap and catch bait in Lac Seul? I have never done this before, but the thought of having lively minnows from the natural forage base has got me thinking."
545554,Guest,2005-02-04 14:26:00,0,Don't get caught!!!!!! Its against the law and carries a very heavy fine.
545558,Trailerguy,2005-02-04 15:40:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Non-residents can't trap bait in Canada. Residents are allowed one minnow trap each, with a fishing license. Typical fine is $150 CND. This law was enacted when they raised the lisence fees for bait dealers a few years ago and gave them management units with exclusive rights to trap bait."

545567,Guest,2005-02-05 07:51:00,0,What about catching them on a rod with about a #18 hook and a piece of worm? I've done that before and it worked out pretty good. It is standard practice in saltwater to catch fresh bait on the Sabiki rig at the start of the day.

545597,Guest,2005-02-06 10:56:00,0,"Hi. is that the place on the rod to gold pine? I know one place around there had ther own minnow lake and sold them from the house. It was nice that they did not count they had a half cup measuring cup and that was a dozen, actually it was more like 2 or 3 dozen but h=whose counting. I hate it when they count."
545605,bushie,2005-02-06 16:20:00,2,"yep, thats the place,, 1 mile down the goldpines road, best prices with a great count !"
545647,Guest,2005-02-07 23:30:00,0,"Hi. yes, I always felt guilty when the lodge owner would ask if we needed minnows every day and I would have to come up with an excuse about not using too many minnows. the first day we sould buy 2 dozen from the lodge and then not."
