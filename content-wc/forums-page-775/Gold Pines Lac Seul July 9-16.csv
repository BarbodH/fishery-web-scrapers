545529,Guest,2005-02-03 10:40:00,0,My group is also considering Gold Pines and pictures would be appreciated. My e-mail is [email protected]. Thanks in advance for any help.
545534,Guest,2005-02-03 15:00:00,0,Hey Starfish. How you doing ? I hope your winter is going well. I'm bringing my sister and her new hubby as well as my wife this year.Since Gold Pines is more than $300 less for a week than Goose Bay for 4 adults I'm going to give it a try. Where and when are you going this year ?
545547,Guest,2005-02-04 09:02:00,0,"We are going back to Goose Bay , Aug 20 - 26. Family weddings and Aniversary partys pushed our trip back a bit. Is Gold Pines really that much less expensive? Did you get a new truck? Starfish"
545564,Guest,2005-02-04 19:23:00,0,Hey Joel No new truck yet ! Goose Bay cabin w 4 adults plus dockage for boat $1185 Gold Pines cabin w 4 adults plus dockage for boat $ 780 Good luck in August

545397,Guest,2005-01-26 18:34:00,0,"We have stayed at gold pines off and on since '83. Bill and Helen have been running the place since '86??? and you will not find friendlier people. Nice cabins, good dock, nice fish cleaning houses, just a great place."
545411,Guest,2005-01-27 15:46:00,0,Since they're significantly less expensive than either Goose Bay or Evergreen I'm hoping their cabins are just as nice.
545415,Guest,2005-01-28 07:44:00,0,Are you going there to fish or are you going there to stay for a week in the cabin the whole time.Our cabin that we stay in is an older one and its great.Hot water clean warm fridge keeps the beer cold..I have some pictures and some of them have the cabins in the backround if you want them emailed just ask
545423,skrut,2005-01-28 14:03:00,52,"We have been going to GoldPines for over 30 years. Any of the cabins are more than adequate for a weeks stay. The prices are the best for any camp or lodge on Lac Seul. There docks are equipped with electrical hookups for your own boat. They have upgrade boats with flat floors, and swivel seats. Pete, Christa, Bill and Helen are great and go out of their way to make you feel welcome. If you need something from town, they will go in and get it for you, even though you are only 5 miles from town. They have minnows in camp."
545433,Guest,2005-01-29 15:53:00,0,Rockfinder I would appreciate any pictures you could send to [email protected] Thanks for the feedback
545441,Guest,2005-01-30 13:12:00,0,Can you hire any guides for the day from this place?
545445,Guest,2005-01-30 16:28:00,0,Im sure they would find you one but Its not hard to find fish on the lake.the river is a short boat ride from the lodges. and theres a ton of bays and islands to fish around..
545455,Guest,2005-01-31 07:11:00,0,Thanks for the pictures rockfinder. I don't think a guide is really necessary. I'm no expert but I've always caught plenty of fish in the steamboat narrows area.
545460,Guest,2005-01-31 14:17:00,0,"Ive got some more pictures if needed,We have some real picky people that go with us and they dont complain about the place.Youll have a good time"
545528,Guest,2005-02-03 10:16:00,0,"Hey Blackjack, How's it going? Not going back to Goose Bay next year? Starfish"
545248,Guest,2005-01-20 16:02:00,0,Looking forward to spending a week at Lac Seul. Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated.
545250,Guest,2005-01-20 17:03:00,0,"we've been to ear falls the week after that a number of times. fish should be moved out into the main lake by then. as you come out of camp and head down the lake, look for rocky points or just the windward side of any of the many islands in front of you. the edges of weedbeds will also be good. the weather should be nice and stable by then, but count on getting blown off the main lake and least one day during the week. you can fish the river on that day. i bottom bounce with crawlers, but jig and minnow is fine. we fish mainly steamboat and mckenzie (bigger fish imo), but you don't have to go nearly that far to get into lots of nice fish. i've caught lots of nice eaters around that island right in front of your camp. dog island, i think. you should have a great experience if you've never been there before. my whole year revolves around my week up there. good luck."
545282,Guest,2005-01-21 21:22:00,0,"I stayed at gold pines that week last year and we caught a ton of nice walleyes, Going back again this year but staying at a near by camp because we booked to late and didn't have a cabin for our size group."
545290,Guest,2005-01-22 10:52:00,0,I was wondering how the camp measures up to others in the Ear Falls area ? Are there any areas close by to go for pike ?
545296,Guest,2005-01-22 19:35:00,0,The guide we hired said walleyes are better than ever but it is harder to get pike than it was a few years ago. we saw a few guys who where trying to catch pike and they seemed to be doing ok. But not as well as the walleye fishermen
545316,Guest,2005-01-23 17:18:00,0,"blackjack, i think the camp would rank mid-range. not best. not worst. never stayed there, but looked it over last year. looked like a clean camp. if i remember correctly, their boats had bench seats. i, personally, would never stay at a camp with bench seats. their web site is pretty weak and does not give a lot of info. no rates posted, so i can't comment."

545348,Guest,2005-01-24 12:37:00,0,"I bring my own boat so their boats are not a priority. The rates are reasonable, $685 a week for a 2 bedroom housekeeping cabin for 4 adults.I was asking to see if I could find someone who's been there."
545357,Guest,2005-01-24 19:28:00,0,I was there last year and we had our own boats their cabins range from brand new and very nice to very old try to get one of the new cabins. the people are very nice but you will need to go the couple miles to town to buy any supplies you don't bring in because they don't sell anything at the camp. They had a ton uf repeat business from the people we met that is always a good sign.
545389,Guest,2005-01-26 10:50:00,0,"Our group has been staying there for five years and getting to know alot of other groups that have been staying there for alot longer.The people that own the camp are the best group of people i have met yet,and I have stayed at a bunch of places in canada,anyway in the evenings just before dark its alot of fun to go over to the inlet right across from the camp I dont catch big ones there but alot of little ones also at night go down on the docks and cast spoons and mepps spinners for pike seen some big ones caught there. 5of diamonds,pink,yellow or some spinner bait caught some on buzz baits and that was awsome"
