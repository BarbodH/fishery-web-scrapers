The snow at the time near Dryden was 4 1/2 feet deep. T-125 days before we go...but who's counting!!"

With the snow in the bush this winter I'm thinking the water level will be higher this spring, but it doesn't usually rise until after ice out. So the earlier ice out comes the more time for the water to rise."

I plan to poke a few holes in the ice but promise to stay on my side of the channel. Hope to hook up with a friend and snowmobile to a lake trout lake just to the south. It is just like waiting for Christmas isn't it."
