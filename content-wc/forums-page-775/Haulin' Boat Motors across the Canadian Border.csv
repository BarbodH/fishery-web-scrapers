We will be traveling caravan style, probably with 3 vehicles. Does anyone foresee any problems or hassles at the border if we were to transport all 4 motors in one truck? Our plan is to go across with empty gas tanks and then fill them when we get close to our destination, so there should be no issues with travelling with 20+ gallons of fuel. We would just like to avoid any problems or delays....when we hit the road, we're intent on getting there and hitting the water. Any input appreciated!"

A ""reasonable"" amount of fuel, like one tank of fuel per engine would also be no problem. Coming back to the USA with them is more likely to raise questions, they pay closer attention."
545551,Guest,2005-02-04 13:29:00,0,The only question I have is....Why take motors to Canada....isnt that like taking a six pack into a taveran? Or like taking your wife to Las Vegas?
545553,Guest,2005-02-04 14:22:00,0,"LOL at archie. I agree, bringing your own motor to crack up on the rocks seems strange. Bringing the whole rig I understand, but just motors would be way more hastle than it is worth."
545561,Bx2(IL),2005-02-04 17:50:00,62,There's always the possibility that the lodge they are going to supplies 15 hp motors on the 16 ft. lodge boats and they would rather bring their own 225s.

There is something to say about having something you KNOW is reliable, and you are more apt to take care of it, which also saves any possible damage to the boat (albeit small)"

545615,Guest,2005-02-07 06:32:00,0,"Thanks all for the replys. Our reasons for bringing our own motors? 1. Cost- by bringing our own it cuts the rate/week substancially for this Outfitter. $250/motor(4)/week is worth the haul. And before someone jumps me for being cheap, let me say this. The Outfitter has set things up this way. He made the rates/week.... his policy.... either use your own motors or use his. If he felt that he was losing $$, all he needs to do is not allow clients to bring their own. We can live with things either way....it's His Call. 2. We've been to this place before and know the water well enough to not mess up our motors."
545618,Guest,2005-02-07 07:10:00,0,$250 is a nice savings.....if I could get a deal like that I could afford to pay more Duty on more Booze.
545626,Guest,2005-02-07 13:01:00,0,Archie- Our gang will save $1000......I like the way you think! An extra bottle wouldn't hurt a thing. A huge Prime Rib dinner will be added to the menu as well.
