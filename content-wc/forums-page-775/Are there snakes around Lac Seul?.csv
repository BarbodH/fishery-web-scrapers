545530,Guest,2005-02-03 10:55:00,0,The is a HUGE snake in Ear Falls and he drives a Patrol Car. That snake gave us a ticket (passenger selt belt) a mile from the resort. Will never return due his lack of hospitality and professionalism.
545533,Guest,2005-02-03 14:38:00,0,"I had a snake experience north of Armstrong, about as far north as Lac Seul. We were at a primative remote fly-in with no lights so at night it was hard to see and you had to use flashlights. One night someone thought they saw a very large snake in the cabin. We could not find the snake and thought his imagination had got the best of him. A few days latter we baked some blueberry muffins in the stove. They tasted great until someone noticed the large coiled up snake burned to a crisp in the bottom of the stove. I always check the stove now before cooking."
545536,bigfish1965,2005-02-03 15:38:00,3210,Good.
545586,firefox,2005-02-05 19:56:00,2,"there are actually a number of different species of snake that inhabit the dark and forboding forests that border Lac Seul. I have spent my entire life in the area and will offer this list of snakes that i have come into contact with that is by no means complete. 1) The Giant Anaconda- this snake has been know to reach lengths of over 30ft and preys on large mammals such as moose, black bear and unsuspecting fisherman enjoying shore lunch on the sandy beaches of Lac Seul 2) King Cobra- the most venmous snake in the world. I have encountered this reptilian beast on many a foray into the woods to bait the mighty black bear during the hunting season in the fall. This magnificent specimen can reach lengths of 15ft and should be avoided at all costs 3) Polka-dotted Red tailed Rattler- whoa nelly! this is one tough customer. Evolution has trained this ferocious predator to strike at the genial area of its prey, inflicting an atrocious wound that few live (poor buggers) to ever talk about"
545600,Guest,2005-02-06 13:16:00,0,"The way you have described this snake, I feel sorry for the poor buggers that survived. I think I would rather be dead."
545644,Barney Fife,2005-02-07 20:44:00,7,"Yes, I've seen a few snakes in my travels to NW Ontario. I was up at Cedar Lake several years ago getting my boat organized to go out one early AM. A father and son-in-law team was doing the same. Apparently a garter snake had found it's way into their rod locker. The son-in-law got quite a surprise when he open the locker and reached in for his rod. He must have jumped 6 feet. One of those great moments that still makes me chuckle."
545473,Guest,2005-02-01 09:28:00,0,"i've never seen any. is it too cold up there? if any, what kinds?"
545474,Guest,2005-02-01 09:39:00,0,"snow snakes, small northerns, and garter snakes should be about the extent of it."
545476,Trailerguy,2005-02-01 11:04:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I've seen garter snakes, and one that looked like some kind of bull snake. An occasional snapping turtle as well, they generally have bad attitudes though."
545481,Pooch,2005-02-01 12:51:00,4619,My wife is truly panic stricken by snakes and for years I had her convinced that there were no snakes in Canada. Or at least until she got off the float plane once and a really large garden snake was sunning on the dock. She about stepped on it! I have no doubt that if she could have figured out how to start the plane she would flown herself out. So I guess the answer is yes there are a lot of snakes in Canada. None poison that I'm aware of. You need snakes around the camps to keep the mice down. Pooch
545482,Guest,2005-02-01 12:59:00,0,ok. thanks guys. odd that i've never seen any sunning on a rock or something. maybe the raptors keep them undercover.
545487,Guest,2005-02-01 15:58:00,0,"You seem to be very knowledgable about NW Ontario. I believe you have a place on Wabasong(?). Are you from the states. Just curious, always enjoy reading your posts."
545488,Trailerguy,2005-02-01 16:13:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I have a cottage on Wabaskang, been fishing and hunting that area 25 yrs. A few more untill retirement and I'll only need to spend winters here in Iowa, or maybe somewhere warmer? :)"
545490,Guest,2005-02-01 18:31:00,0,"Where in Iowa? I live in north central Iowa and I too am looking for a warm place for retirement. I want walleyes, and golf!"
545491,hawkeye,2005-02-01 19:11:00,112,Fished ontario 27 years. Don't know if they have snakes but I have never seen one.
545492,bigfish1965,2005-02-01 19:28:00,3210,We have 18 species of snakes and a few are poisonous(Massasauga Rattler and Timber Rattler) though both poisonous species are very shy and will take off long before you know they are there. The Eastern Hognose gets rather large and is quite an ugly brute.
