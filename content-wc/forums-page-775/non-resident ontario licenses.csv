545506,Fred_G,2005-02-02 10:51:00,908,You can order over the phone from the MNR at 1-800-667-1940. I've been doing this for several years now and it works great.
545562,rebelrn2001,2005-02-04 18:41:00,1563,Do you pay more for doing that?
545566,Fred_G,2005-02-05 04:50:00,908,No extra charge at all. And by using a credit card you get the most current exchange rate. I've found it to be very convenient.
