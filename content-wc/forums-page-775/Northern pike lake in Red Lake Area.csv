How about some suggestions of great pike lakes I could try in the Red Lake area."
545216,Guest,2005-01-19 19:17:00,0,"Hawk, Where did you fly into on Trout Lake. Was it Booi's Lodge?"
545218,Pooch,2005-01-19 19:30:00,4619,Or Green's? Pooch
545255,hawkeye,2005-01-20 19:46:00,112,I fly into Booi's second week of opening.
545269,Guest,2005-01-21 10:24:00,0,"First time going to Booi's week of June 3-10. Hawk,what can you tell me about the island, staff, fishing, ect. any help would be great. Usually got to an outpost, but my brother talked me into this trip. Thanks"
545291,Stu,2005-01-22 11:16:00,472,There is a small lake nearby called Ranger. I have only found it on one map but the locals know about it. I fished it about 10 years ago and we had to take a four wheeler. I was told that ther is a better road to it now. We caught good sized pike all day and had too amny follows to count. Good luck - Stu
545292,18Fisher,2005-01-22 12:43:00,59,"If were thinking about the same lake than i elieve you can get to ranger by way of gullrock. Actually if you're ready for a long bat ride you could boat all the way from red lake through the channel, through keg lake, across gullrock, and up to ranger. If we're still talking the same lake that is."
545318,hawkeye,2005-01-23 19:17:00,112,"Newcer, You said this will be your first year at Booi's camp on trout lake June 3 to10. I've been there the week before, last six years. The walleye should still be in there spawning waters. Poplar and Keesic Bays & Back in Long Channel. Trout are all over down about 10'. Our favorite place is along the West shore line just north of Booi's. Too be presise NOrth and south of ""Don and Donas Point"" which is only marked so on Booi's lake map they hand out. The lake trout are caught on a fast troll using a spoon or plug. Our best producer is a Lur-Jensen ""J-Plug"" 3"" blue top with white bottom amd frog colored with black stripes. They have a great shore lunch where they send you to a location to fish, they then come around 11:00 am and pick up fish and cook them for shore lunch for about 20 people. You must have some one in the boat who knows the lake, or follow someone then have a GPS to get back. Be glad to send a marked map and answer any questions. [email protected]"
