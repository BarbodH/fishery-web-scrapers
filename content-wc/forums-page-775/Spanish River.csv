Nice place with some good fishing.We caught walleyes on the flats with crawler harnessess and jigged for them off the points with minnows or crawlers. Pike take almost anything most of the time but trolling slowly with a large,live minnow behind a spinner seems to get the largest ones. For smallmouth, we use tube jigs, jigs and tails and cranks cast shallow and pulled into deeper water. Haven't caught muskie there but haven't fished for them. I've only fished the river in the spring. Around the end of June the walleyes pull out of the river and onto the flats and points. The fish aren't real selective. There's a lot of structure around the islands but some large mid- depth flats to."
