I have a friend going to that big lake north of Toronto with several friends to do some ice fishing. None of them have been to Canada to fish before. THey heard that they have to keep a piece of skin on any fillet. Can somebody give me - so I can pass it on to them - info on how they should handle any fish they catch? THey are going for panfish but they might catch a walleye or pike - is the info the same? Thanks very much."
545622,woods,2005-02-07 10:51:00,646,"You need to keep a 1"" patch of skin on each fillet."
545623,Trailerguy,2005-02-07 11:14:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Besides the 1"" peice of skin, they need to be packaged in a manner that they can be counted and inspected, not frozen in a block. Gamefish that have a length limit need to be indivually packaged so they can be measured as well."
545624,Guest,2005-02-07 11:59:00,0,"First year we went, we kept all the skin on, which is ok, but it gets slimey when you try to fillet them a few months later after you pull them out of the freezer. My suggestion is this, make it easy on you and the MNR/DNR. Spend $5.00 and get 50 1-gallon ziplocks, fillet your fish leaving some of the skin on, and freeze one fish per ziplock."
545625,Guest,2005-02-07 12:04:00,0,Ditto on the one fish per bag....it can make life a lot easier at the Border .....especially if you get a Border Guard who is having a bad day. We had some Perch one year that had more than one fish per bag and it cost us a extra hour at the Border. ALWAYS LEAVE AT LEAST ONE SQUARE INCH OF SKIN!!!!!
545628,Guest,2005-02-07 13:38:00,0,We always leave the skin on the fillet it helps keep them from freezer burn and they are not that messy when you skin them. You could also wrap them in saran wrap before puttingthem in the bag. That way they won't freeze to each other and you can put more then one fish in a bag. They always ask at the border but have only had them look once a long time ago
545631,MSUICEMAN,2005-02-07 15:42:00,458,"next time i'm just going to freeze the fish solid if its only going to be one or two days, maybe gut em..... then finish cleaning em when i get back. i left some skin on all the fillets and froze them seperately before without problems (and yes, i was checked), but i think that will just be easier. steve"
545632,retire55,2005-02-07 15:48:00,1029,jcass: Here is an internet reference to the Ontario Fishing Regulations for 2005. Rules for transporting fish are on page 6 (actually page 10 of 14 in the pdf file).http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/fi...nfo_fr2005.pdf
545662,woods,2005-02-08 12:17:00,646,"We wrap each two filets in Saran wrap, then if we are feeling lucky, we wrap them in aluminum foil. If one gets stopped, you can always remove the foil for inspection, and if you don't, they are ready to throw in the freezer when you get home. I saw this method on the Al Linder show about 10 years ago, and I can tell you I have ""found"" a fish or two in the freezer almost two years old, and they will have no freezer burn when they are packed this way, and still taste great."
