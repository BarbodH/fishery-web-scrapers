They will go up opening week, taking thier boat and mine, and after a weeks fishing will leave both of the boats for us to use when we come up the second week of the season. We'll then pull them both back home. Kind of confusing isn't it? My question is: Are either of us likely to have problems pulling a boat we don't own accross the border? If so, what might we do to eleminate the possibe problem? Would signed letters from the boat owners giving thier permission to have the boat be of any use or is there a different approach? I've never been asked to show proof of ownership in the 20 years I have been crossing but I also have never been detained at the border for any reason....been thinking this would just be the year for that to happen and wanted to be prepared. Thanks for any thought you might have!"

About all I can say about your situation is that I was told Canadian authorities don't like it when you leave a boat as I did in my situation. My lodge owner was very cool about it but he said that if they somehow new I had left my boat they could make me go back and get it. I'd say that if the boats don't have license plates on them that would correlate with the names of the vehicle pulling it, I wouldn't worry about it."

Ontario lets you leave a boat up to 45 days without paperwork, more than that you need to tell them at customs and fill out a form. The boat has to be returned to USA that year or you are subject to sales taxes on demand. Or yet another form to be filled out if it is at a marina for repair after 45 days. Coming back to the USA with a friends boat should be a non-issue, as your vehicle insurance would cover it while it's hooked up. Also customs isn't likely to check the plates on the trailer anyway, and since it is a USA plate they wouldn't care anyway, because there is no duty to pay."

We will be in Ontario (Gull Rock lake) and my real concern had less to do with leaving the boat but rather with my friends crossing into Canada pulling my boat and my not being there yet. I will be pulling his as well as mine back but, as you said, I am not to worried coming back into the states. sorry for being so confusing."
545659,Trailerguy,2005-02-08 09:41:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]There would be a 1 in a million chance they'd run the plate to establish ownership. The worst case would be they could call you from customs to establish permission, if you gave your friend a # you can be reached at."
545661,Guest,2005-02-08 10:32:00,0,Thanks! I'll bet your right....at least it seems logical. Just didn't want them to encounter problems at customs.
