575445,drlee,2008-06-24 19:51:00,409,"Had a great trip to Canada the second week in June. Went through the Pigeon River Entry south of Thunder Bay. No line going in...no hassles. Pigeon River always seems to be cordial and informal. On the way back, we waited about 30-45 minutes. Very unusual. The American agents were very polite, which is typical at that crossing. I talked to the border guard and he said they have never been so busy, and that most of the crowd is made up of Americans going fishing in Canada. He said its the biggest crowd he has ever seen, and he has been there a long time. He said that air fares are so high that people are traveling to Canada by car from the US and from the US to Canada by car with great regularity. I recognize that is only one opinion, but the guy obviously has no agenda. It sounds to me like the reluctance of Americans to travel to Canada fishing may be a myth, at least at that border crossing. We had great weather, though quite cool the first half of the week. The second half was blue bird weather and few bugs the whole trip. We caught lots of walleyes and could have fished northerns all week and caught hundreds and hundreds. Instead, we caught hundreds and hundreds of walleyes. 16-22 inches was the norm. We travel nearly 900 miles north from the Miwaukee/Green Bay area in Wisconsin, so we are far north. We were, as usual, treated very well by our Canadian brothers and sisters. I was a bit surprised that when we filled up with gas in Canada, the pump would show, for example, $67, but then they would charge GST and round it up to $70. Never experienced that before. Gas was around $6 per gallon. Paid around $3.90 at the border (MN side) on the north shore of Lake Superior. I purchase salt minnows in Fond du Lac, WI for $1 per dozen. They do not ""spoil"" and do not take second place to live minnows, in my opinion. We take 60 dozen and use nearly all of them ( 4guys). Beats the heck out of $4.50 a dozen for live minnows. Again, it has been my experience that salt minnows, which are legal to take across the border, will fish equally with live bait. I know many fisher people salt their own, but I have not done that...just purchase them ready to go. GAS: I pull a 17' G3 with a 50 hp 4 stroke Yamaha behind a 2006 Toyota 4-Runner, V8. I am pretty well loaded for my trip. I run 65 mph through Wisconsin, and then around 60 mph through MN and Ontario. Got 17 MPG, which is a little higher than usual for me. So, in a 2000 mile trip, I burned 120 gallons of regular unleaded. At $4 per gallon, that is $480 divided by two people, or $240 each. Our camp cost is about $750 for two of us, plus $125 for boat gas and $60 for a fishing license. I don't count grociers, because we have to eat at home! So, the trip with a motel on the way up at $75 costs about $750 per person. I guess you could add $100-$200 for other stuff. Not cheap, but folks, that is around $100 per day per person. Dinner, Drinks, and a Movie in Sheboygan is $100 per night for a couple. Just my perspective. By the way, I spent the entire week with my oldest son fishing and talking smart...PRICELESS. Have a great summer! I will be in Ontario fishing for an additional three weeks this summer...retirement is great! Dr. Lee"
