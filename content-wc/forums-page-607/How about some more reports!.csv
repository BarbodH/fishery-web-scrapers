575173,joeman79,2008-06-17 19:47:00,417,"We were at the Bow Narrows Camp on the west end of Red Lake last week. Weather was lousy, Rainy cold and an east wind for 4 days in a row. First time there so I did not expect to do exceptionally well and we did not. But the average walleye we did catch were bigger than any other lake I have been to. We caught very few small fish, and all the fish we caught were shallow 11 ft and shallower. 29 inches was our biggest fish with most ranging from 22-26 inches. Caught about half our fish on a Jig and Leech/Crawlers and spinners and leeches/crawlers. Water temps ran from 49-61 from Sat. to Sat. Had a good time fishing Dead bait in the evenings for Northerns and caught some Pig Walleye on Ciscoes under a bobber. Biggest Northern was 36 inches. Missed 3 out of 5 Strikes, made for alot of laughter and swearing!! Biggest Pike were 39 and 38 inches both caught on a Jig and Worm fishing for Walleye. Pike fishing with lures was slow but with the crappy weather we did not give the Northerns a very serious shot. Did fish a Musky sized Slugo and Had a couple nice misses and caught a couple. Figure8'ed a 36"" Northern on a Nemire Spoon Buzzer at the Boat, Which was cool watching her Big Mouth inhale the spoon. Charlie Caught 2 Lakers One 34 incher that was in 10 ft of water. And there were still Lakers on Surface on the 14th. Which they said was very unusual, but nothing this spring and early summer is to surprizing. The Bow Narrows People were fantastic Hosts. They fed us way to much food, I should rephrase that. WE ate way to much!! I know 3 of us came home 10 pounds heavier. The food was very good. The Boats and Motors were great. Saw a few Moose, alot of Bald Eagles, nesting Loon, a pair of Otters Porpoising and playing in Trout Bay. One incredible Sunset with Purples and Oranges and many other colors. And a week away from WORK. Fishing was great, and the catching was a little tough and the weather was unfriendly a majority of the time. But it was worth it. Planning for another trip next July or August. Want to try Lac Suel, So any suggestions on a Non-guided American plan or Housekeeping would be appreciated. Thanks and Good Luck Fishing everyone."

On the good days we caught a lot of Walleyes. Our biggest was also 29"" and a lot were in the 22 to 26"" range. Also had no trouble getting 17"" fish for eating. On the bad days we caught Walleyes but not as many and we had to work for them. We got to see a huge Northern grab onto a 24"" Walleye as one of our guys was reeling it in. That was quite a site. Thursday and Friday we hunted big Pike with suckers and huge bobbers. I have never done that before and was suprised at how much fun it was (although expensive). Our equipment was clearly not up to the task as we hooked two monsters but they both got away. The biggest one we got in the boat was 37"". You also catch a lot of Walleyes doing this. It is funny when you get a 24"" Walleye up by the boat and say ""another #### walleye"". We stayed at Sunset Lodge which was a very nice experience. It is a very well run operation and Rene put us on some great fishing spots. Even with the crummy weather it was a great week. JB"

575213,Guest,2008-06-19 13:52:00,0,"It is on the west end of Red Lake, near Pipestone Bay. Beautiful setting."
575215,Tony Shirley,2008-06-19 14:52:00,211,Hi Joe man were u fishin pipestone?
575219,Guest,2008-06-19 17:08:00,0,Bays and narrows off of Pipestone and also back towards main lake.
575227,Eyes_R_Us,2008-06-19 20:41:00,66,"Sunset Lodge is on the edge of town. It takes maybe 5 minutes to be downtown. If you know where the forest fire fighters are located, it is right next to that. JB"
