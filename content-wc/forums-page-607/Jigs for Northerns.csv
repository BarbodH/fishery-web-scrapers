It's always worked for me to pitch, then rip and often jig hard...usually always produces with jig style hook. I've been tinkering over the years with different types/models. I only like to use about 1/4 oz weight at the most. I also don't really like the wire leader-what's the best foot-and-a-half just strong enough leader? Does anyone have any ideas, or are there some products available that don't rape the pocketbook? Any feedback would be great. Thanks."

I use 30# braided because it is durable against snake bites and is far more sensitive than wire. I have the jigs I use on my Tackle Website and we are a sponsor on WC. If you would like the website address please email me. Good Luck, Mike Kansas[email protected]"

We tie 12 inches of 30 lb knot-able steel leader material directly to the jig. I don't see why you couldn't swap the twister tail for your minnow."
