I beleive that the Walleye fishing on the Winnipeg River system out of Minaki has gotten better over the last few years. I have been going to Minaki for approx. 42 years and this year was great. The largest Walleye I caught and released was a 28 and half off the rock shore just before the Sand Beach in 15 feet of water. Other areas that produce numerous fish were Wildedge, West Harbour, and the Entrance. One evening went to the Mc Farlen (spelling?) River and slamed the slab crapies. Hope everyone has had the same good luck as I had this spring and I look forward to 14 days of fishing the system this August. Diesel"

You do not want to use your outboard to look for them, you will take off your lower unit. Around those rocks is the place we nailed them. if you line yourself up with just being able to see the rapids and the railroad bridge you are close. Water is only about 4 to 5 feet deep around the rocks and drop off to 7 to 8 feet. Diesel"

We fished West Harbour Bay near the point in 18'-20' and caught many walleyes, many were 12""-13"" but we did catch as many larger fish with the largest being 28"". We also fished on the reefs in Big Sand and did quite well. As usual, the bite was very dependent on the wind and two days it was glass so the bite was slow then. When there was wind (which was mostly north go figure) the bite really turned on, especially on Big Sand near the sand beach drop off in 15'. Smallies and northerns are very abundant and a fun bonus when the walleye bite is slow. I know many of you only fish the smallies and I can't blame you! We caught many in the 16""-18"" range and boy is that fun for the 13 year old son when dad makes him drag a leech or crawler around the lake most of the day! Great trip until I hit a deer and blew up my tranny cooler half way between Nestor Falls and Fort Frances on the way home!! $582 tow bill and a wrecked transmission!! Limped home on a temporary repair with a top speed of 46 MPH. Good Luck to all and watch out for the Bambi's!!"
575382,Guest,2008-06-23 13:10:00,0,I just got back and the smally fishing was the best I have had in 30 years going up there.
