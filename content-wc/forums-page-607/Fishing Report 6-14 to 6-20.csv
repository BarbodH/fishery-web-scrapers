The first day was ok for fishing with decent weather and normal activity in the walleye. The water is up at this lake that is fed by the Allanwater River. The second day, our group went up river to a rapids near where Sesaganaga dumps in and horizontally jigged the rapids from shore. We caught lots of fish doing this. Shore lunch was excellant even though we forgot the butter to broil the fish in. PBR works well as a substitute. Then the weather came in and the walleye got lock jaw. Fishing was more difficult after this with the best success coming from a slow presentation in deeper water. Most of the fish that I caught were in 12+ feet of water with an abundance around 20 feet. They were not attacking the baits and color combinations varied. Red Gulp was in demand from our group as the walleyes seemed to like it best. Pumkinseed was also very good at times. The weather broke around Tuesday afternoon but did not bring any relief to the fishing slowness. I still caught 25 or so each day but it took all day and a lot of patience. My boat partner from Tuesday til Thursday only caught 12 for those three days, but made up for it with a nice 41 inch pike. My biggest for the week was a 26.5 inch walleye caught less than 10 minutes after the big pike. It kind of made the event no big deal so I didn't even get a pic of it. Overall, the fishing was adequate with no fault to the lake that we were on. Sizes were good with many of us struggling to get a fish near 18 inches. About 10-15 percent of the fish that I took were over 18"" and a lot of fish under 16"". The weather and water depth probly played the biggest factor in the fishing. Gas prices were a shock. We drove 2 vehicles this year instead of a motorhome in order to save money. This worked out well and we saved about $150 per man over the motorhome. My truck got a suprising 14 mpg towing a uhaul, just keep the speed down. A side benefit that we all felt from driving our own vehicles is that we were well rested the first day even after a 22 hour drive. I'm not sure why other than the vehicles are much easier to drive and not as bouncy. Overall, great week and I look forward to next year."
