Then we would be able to find some of these places you talk about.......Stephensons point, Minkota Bay, Fishermans point. Can anyone tell me where these spots are? We go there but only know a few colloquial names......'the boot"" ""burnt island"" 'the river'...it would be nice to know the names of these places and where they are. Thanks"

575300,Guest,2008-06-21 20:58:00,0,We have that same map as Golden Hook and got it at Mary's South Bay on Gull Rock. I suppose if (and when we get there) that I sat down with Mary she could tell me where some of these places are............ But.....seems there are so many names for the same spots???? Like there is a place we were told was First Island?? What is that to others? Confusing........
