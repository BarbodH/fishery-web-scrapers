575375,Guest,2008-06-23 11:59:00,0,"Been going to Canada in different areas for the past 20 years...pretty much seen everything as far as fishing, different resorts, different prices (gas included)...we still go back but we've down scaled considerably in how we stay, how long, how much bait, etc. I'm going up for a week in Mid-July-can't wait! One thing I've noticed, being a resident of Northern Wisconsin, is that the resorts here are showing increased numbers. Fishing has improved tremendously in the past 10 years and I think people are taking advantage of it. I'm tired of listening to people whine about Canada and the way they go about their business-not fair. You may just be talking about the richest country in the world 50 years from now. People tend to forget that you cannot put a price on clean water, clean fish and cool people. We have 10 friends (old guides, resort caretakers) from 10 different places that are canadian residents who are all finding time to meet us on our way up north just to say hi-that's what it's all about to our group."
575399,Guest,2008-06-23 19:08:00,0,"Here is the deal. I AM going to canada--do not care about gas prices or border patrol. Been going for 25 years and will be going again this year. Do not care about the border cause I am legal when i cross and if I have more beer than usual--I tell them, pay duty and drive on, pretty simple. If you do not like the gas prices or crossing the border and respecting canada laws then don't go. I do not care and don't really want to hear your stories of why you are not going back to canada, does not matter to me one bit. not going to change my mind at all. I am going, I am going to love it and I am going to respect it."

I am leaving Saturday for Hidden Bay Lodge in Sioux Lookout but am kind of depressed because I realize this may be my last trip for a while. The first of my two kids will be going to college next fall so probably won't make it back for four years or more.

575321,Obabikon,2008-06-22 16:16:00,2370,"Striper Sam, You told your story once in this thread, let's not hijack a different one! We all know that you're not going back after 30 years of going due to a fine on an ILLEGAL knife. Let me tell you a story. Myself and 7 other guys were crossing when I was 18. We got pulled over for inspection. Not the first time this has happened to me. Anyhow, we go inside to wait. The guy behind me in line also got pulled over for inspection (not part of my group). Anyhow, he comes through the door and says ""this is total bull ****"", and continues to gripe and complain. The border officer walks over, and says to me... ""are you with him"". ""No sir, I don't know him at all sir"" is all that I responded. The officer smiled and said, ""you can go"". I would not have wanted to be there for that guy's inspection! I bet it took a LOOOONNNNGGGG time, and he was fined. Point of the story is... ""Yes sir"" and ""No sir"" go a LONG way in making the experience easier. It won't always help. Sometimes their are officers looking to write tickets. Maybe they saw you were from New Mexico and they hate that state. Maybe their dog just died. Maybe they are under pressure at work to write more tickets. Point is... lots of factors (including your friend breaking the law) goes into writing a ticket. The best thing to do is say, ""I'm sorry sir"" and accept what you get! The respect you give will be the respect you receive... it'll even out eventually! Just like now... the griping and complaining you've been doing will come back on you. Enjoy your trips to Minnesota!"
575327,Guest,2008-06-22 18:40:00,0,Been going for about 28 years or so up to canada. Been pulled over a few times and never had a problem--I treat them with respect. Got pulled over once a long time ago(i was like 10) and couple guys in the group decided to call the officer honey(female) a few times--needless to say we got fined for bringing over silverware. There ya go!!!
575336,Guest,2008-06-22 22:27:00,0,"I'm a Canadian and I have made regular, driving trips into the states over the past 10 years.. Our gas has ALWAYS been far more expensive than in the US and our dollar was worth 65 to 70 cents most of the trips my wife and I have made. I just got back from Wisconsin. 4 days, 4000 km, and more gas money than I care to think about. In spite of this expense I am satisfied. I have a sweet boat, a variety of tasty cheeses, and best of all.... 30 beer for $15.50. The amount of money that most fishermen spend on fishing is crazy. Higher gas prices should not deter Americans from coming here. What's another couple of hundred bucks for gas split between fishing buddies? Come to Saskatchewan. Buy our $1.40/litre gas, $12 cigarettes, $20/dozen beer, $13 half sized pouches of RedMAn or Copenhagen, and enjoy the fishing. I'm going north for a week and will come home broke but happy."
575344,Guest,2008-06-23 06:50:00,0,"The increase in the price of gas going to Canada is relatively insignificant when you compare it to the total cost of the trip, especially if you split it 3-4 ways. Its the everyday gas/fuel/energy costs that are eating up many people's vacation budget. In the past 3 years, the propane cost to heat my house has increased from $900 to $3,000. Our family's monthly gasoline costs have increased from about $200 to $500. I'm fortunate that it isn't affecting my vacation plans but many aren't so lucky and the extra $2-$5K/year in energy related costs will do serious financial harm to many fishermen. And wait for the price increases from the increased corn/soybeans price to work its way through the system. The floods in the midwest aren't helping. If the gov't would publish accurate CPI data, I think we'd find out that inflation is running about 10-15% instead of the bogus 2-4% they like to print. Fishermen have less discretionary spending money, camps have to raise prices to keep up with costs...its a vicious circle that will see some camps close their doors permanently in the next year or two. This recession is going to last a long time."
575345,AllenW,2008-06-23 06:53:00,11482,""""""""""""""""" What's another couple of hundred bucks for gas split between fishing buddies? """""""""""""""" Maybe a lot....imho Considering it was about 2004 when gas was $2 a gallon and many had no or little problem affording this price, it's now only 4 years later and the price of gas has doubled, which effects not only buying gas to get to Canada, but the cost of living. Not to mention taxes, which have been spiraling up wards for longer than I can remember. This all means less disposable income for things like vacations. So maybe that couple of hundred for gas coupled with the cost of living have made it more difficult to afford vacations in Canada. Pretty easy to say it's only a few bucks, not so easy when you don't have them bucks to begin with. Al"

When we first got there, camp was not full by about 15% but by the time we were leaving, camp was full. Had a good time even though the weather and fish didn't cooperate. Still caught fish but not as much as in the past. Still got great service and had fun with family and friends. Paying extra for gas sucked but it was worth it for the fun time we had. Wingmann"

574913,Dipstick,2008-06-10 20:04:00,101,"It wasn't too long ago that I was getting 67 cents for my dollar while visiting the US. That translates to paying $1.49 Cndn for every $1 US. Never got a rebate or ethanol voucher from ND. However, we just said that was the cost of going to some place that we wanted to go. Really enjoyed the people we meet and the service we get. Hospitality staff we meet have been terrific. Did trips to Cape Cod, Lake Placid, Michigan, Minneapolis, Yellowstone, Arches, Seattle. The list goes on and on. Never complained, didn't like the monetary difference but I didn't blame the hotel owners, US government or even my own government. Just got back from a road trip to Texas. Amazing how much difference a dollar at parity makes. It's a global economy. It isn't static, it moves and changes. Time to realize the world doesn't revolve around the US or Canada. I am expecting some new friends from Missouri that I made in Mexico last winter to come up to fish the Red next Fall. Hope they still will be able to come. Great people and a lot of fun to be with. High gas prices are hurting all of us. Each one of us has noticed that cost of driving and fishing has gone up dramatically. One way to look at it is that you don't do it all year, and is probably still cheaper than a round of golf when you share the costs. Tight Lines"
574932,Guest,2008-06-11 09:31:00,0,"Dipstick, will said.The U.S. dollar is down for once, but we sure like it when it was 30 percent or more years ago. The cost was more for us too, so what, pay it and have fun. Why "" waste time"" it getting shorter so enjoy life, fish, hunt, camp, walk, and love what we do have. It like the stock market, up and down. The camp we were at was half full this year, normally it full. The owner were happy with that, could be worse..... tight line everyone."
574936,AllenW,2008-06-11 10:01:00,11482,"I not so sure it matter quite so much what the exchange rate is, what I think matters most is what the tourist is gonna spend for his vacation. Gas being the big killer now, they have to get to Canada plus buy fuel while there if they stay more than a few days. I'm sure the exchange doesn't make most US tourists happy, and it does effect cost of a trip, but if gas was still $3 a gallon you'd hear far less complainning, I think. Gas just went over $4.00 a gallon here in Minn, if I figure its gonna cost $500 to get there and back, plus $500 or $600 when I'm there (7 day trip) for fuel (your milage may vari) that over a grand in gas...makes that trip a bit more spendy and too exspensive for some we seem to be finding. I can tell its effecting even resorts in Minn, we were going to take a 4 or 5 day trip up north and sent emails to prob a dozen resorts, 5 actually called to plug their place, a few years back a email back was all you could expect and then sometimes nothing. Although I don't penny pich when I go, I will drive a bit slower to get there and won't be hammer down all the time with the boats main motor as much, I have more time than money..:) Next couple of years are going to interesting I think.

No rigs parked at rainey lake sports and no people in the store. Border wait was minimal on a saturday at 9:30 am. None of the usual hustle and bustle. Not complaining but tha price of gas and tha exchange rate are taking a huge toll. I firmly believe the USA is going into a big time recession. The canadian tourism industry will suffer significantly also. Just my observations, not a scientific study. That first week of june is usually busy. Also the number of cars and trailers at our launch(esox landing ) was way down also. Anybody else notice this?"
