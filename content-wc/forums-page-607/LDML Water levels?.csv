565494,CA_Fishead,2007-05-21 14:31:00,17,Any reports on water levels this week at Lac Des Mille Lacs? We are going June 9. We stay on Cushing Lake. Wondering if cut to LDML is still passable. Thanks and will report water levels and bite after returning June 21.

The fire ban is still in effect there, so they couldn't have got too much rain recently. I hope to talk with the guy that runs one of the camps by the middle of the week and I'll try and remember to ask him."

They've had rain the last four days, although except for today, I don't think they've got much. The walleyes are still back in the bay there. Good luck."
