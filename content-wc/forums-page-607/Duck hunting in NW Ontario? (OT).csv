575432,Guest,2008-06-24 15:22:00,0,"Not for a number of years have I duck/goose hunted up that way as I prefer upland game birds. I don't hunt diver ducks like your blue bills , but I prefer mallards, and there is a good number of birds but nothing like in pot hole country out west. There is birds around, but personaly I wouldn't make a trip just for ducks, but that's me looking for mallards. I know your familar with the rough rock narrows and the diver ducks funnel through there all day long in the fall. Further south down 596 there is some fields that used to attacked geese, but again there are no large numbers of the birds."

I was thinking about going up this fall to help my father close camp and get some duck/grouse hunting in. Just an fyi....I got back last week and while up on Sand Lake Road got to see a Wolf in midday. It was huge, a sight to see for sure."

We were up there deer hunting last fall and were amazed at the amount of ducks. Not just divers many mallard, teal, and ringbill. Not like the Dakotas but plenty to keep you busy."

I agree! :) Anyhow, you shouldn't have any problems getting ducks. There's some very good duck hunting all over NW Ontario in the fall. The divers won't come in until the 2nd week of October (at the earliest). Before then you'll be shooting malards, teal, woody's, geese, etc..."
