575404,Skylane,2008-06-23 21:58:00,101,"Just got in from cleaning fish outside (10:00 PM), could not wait to get in. The mosquitos were normal ""bad"". With the wet weather, water standing and things warming up, I don't know how they will not get worse. This is the Dryden area. Also surprised to still see no evidence of a mayfly hatch. Bring your OFF."

575355,Guest,2008-06-23 09:10:00,0,"Just returned from Canada and here is the report: It was a great trip. Gas was about the same in WI and MN as it was here at home in IL. Traffic was lighter than usual and noticed a big reduction in the speed of semi trucks. Border crossing at Canada was thorough, quick and as usual very polite. Border crossing at US was quick and polite the agent even kidded a little. Zero wait times both ways. Accommodations and service at Tomahawk resort on LOW in Sioux Narrows was A++ as usual. Weather was spectacular, fishing was even better. Fewer folks on the lake. Very few bugs(whats up with that?). Only one negative comment: Canadian taters should not be considered a food product, but may possibly be used for animal feed! Will return for two more weeks in July! Total cost: Can't remember Total value: Priceless Canada is still Gods country! JR"
575359,Guest,2008-06-23 10:35:00,0,"JR, I'm heading up to Tomahawk the last week of July for our yearly houseboat trip. What dates are you going in July?"
575360,Guest,2008-06-23 10:46:00,0,I just returned from Minaki and also can say I never saw a mosquito all week. This is the first time ever I've never been biten by anything.
575362,Guest,2008-06-23 10:51:00,0,No Mosqitos....Wow...The bugs because of the wet weather and the late spring are at the worst I've experienced in 20yrs. The black flies are intense as well. If you have alergies to bites be very aware.
575363,Guest,2008-06-23 10:55:00,0,"Bruno, We'll be up there July 13th to 25th."
575365,Wallerian,2008-06-23 11:22:00,10,"This just in: ""Prices have increased so much that even mosquitos can't afford to fly."""
575366,Tony Shirley,2008-06-23 11:30:00,211,That is way too funny :funnypost:
575368,Guest,2008-06-23 11:34:00,0,"That's what everyone was saying before I left so I packed a bunch of bug repellent this year...never had to get it out of the bag. Not sure what the reason was, we stay on an island but I also did several portages and never even saw a mosquito. It wasn't even windy the last three days we were there...go figure."
575374,Pooch,2008-06-23 11:59:00,4619,With the late spring the bugs are waiting for our group to get there next week and hammer us................. Pooch
575386,Guest,2008-06-23 13:59:00,0,"JR, I'm heading up the 24th thru the 1st of August. Save some pigs for me!"
