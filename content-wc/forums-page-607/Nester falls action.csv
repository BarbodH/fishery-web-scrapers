It makes a difference what time of year you come, but in general I would fish jig spinners with a white curly tail grub. These catch just about everything. Concentrate on the cobblestone rock areas for the smallies and weedy coves for northern. This is about as simple an approach I can give you. I live in Nestor Falls during the summers and have been fishing LOTW for over 50 years. Send me an email with the specifics of when you arrive and where you will be and I'll try to be of more help. If it's at a time when I have no one here, I'll take your family out for a part of the day and familiarize you with the close in spots you're likely to have action on. Always happy to help newcomers to this piece of God's country. I'm in the profile section and you can get the email address there."

We fished out of Red Deer Lodge for almost twenty years and were wondering how the they are doing. The last we heard was that Eve passed away and and Bob was living in Emo. Does Lawrence still guide? Thanks, Dave"
