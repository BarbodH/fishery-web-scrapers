575294,Guest,2008-06-21 18:17:00,0,"Scott S., how was your trip and how was your partner? Most of all how was the fishing? Please provide a report as I enjoy fishing reports from Canada on years that I'm not going. Planning for 2009."
575302,Guest,2008-06-21 21:08:00,0,"Just got back this morning. Fishing was ""slow to ok"" for the week. We didn't encounter anything spectacular for the week, but I attribute most of that to a cold front that moved in as we arrived and that stayed for the first 3 days. However, a few of the other groups that were also on Roderick thru Chimo Lodge hooked into a couple of 29"" walleyes and several 27's. As for my fishing partner - Scott - that I found on this site... He was a nice guy and a pleasure to fish with for the week (#### good cook too!). I just might have to see if he will join me and my regular partner next year! I think I'll go back to a July trip for next year as there was little weed development this last trip (that I usually like to exploit)."
574632,SCOTT S,2008-06-03 18:31:00,11,"Geesh, how hard can it be to find a partner for a great fishing trip? From what I heard about this site and all the avid fishermen.... Doesn't anyone here love walleye fishing up north in Canada and want to jump at this opportunity?"
574643,Guest,2008-06-04 07:04:00,0,"Scott, you may want to try the Canada Forum on fishingmn.com That site gets quite a bit of traffic as well.http://www.fishingminnesota.com/foru...ms/71/1/Canada"
574650,SCOTT S,2008-06-04 08:45:00,11,Thank you....I appreciate any help i can get!
574651,Guest,2008-06-04 09:44:00,0,"Count me in if you still want company. I have'nt been to that local but have been up there quite a few times. I lost my fishing partner a few years back and have'nt found anyone to replace him. If beer drinking is okay with you, give a shout. Call 906-280-0539"
574653,Goldeneagle,2008-06-04 10:38:00,78,Nice going guys. Have a great week of fishing.
574671,SCOTT S,2008-06-04 17:37:00,11,"Per our phone conversation, happy to have you join me. All others..... Looks like I found someone to join me...Guess I can stop looking finally!"
574672,Guest,2008-06-04 17:50:00,0,"Good luck guys, and we BETTER have a report when you get home. Have a great trip. ot"

574681,Guest,2008-06-05 05:17:00,0,"Glad you found a partner, hope the both of you have a very enjoyable vacation and a great week of fishing. Scott, we need to get a report on how the fishing was once you get back. Drive safe."
574504,Guest,2008-05-30 17:14:00,0,":fishhit: I am really hoping to find a fishing partner to join me for my upcoming Canadian Fly-Out fishing trip. I'll be leaving Chicago area in the evening on the 12th, driving up thru International Falls, and up to Red Lake. The 7 trip will run June 14th-21st. The lodge that I'll be using is Chimo Lodge out of Red Lake (see chimolodge.com). I have been going to their main camp and outposts for many years, and the fishing has always been great. I am looking for someone who is interested in fishing and can fill in for a partner on such short notice as my partner had a family illness to attend to. I don't care if you are experienced or a novice --- you simply need to be personable and want to experience some great fishing at a fly-out outpost. Young or old is welcome as long as you like to catch lots of fish. I can meet you in the Chicago area, pick you up along the way, or we can meet up in Red Lake. I would say the cost of complete trip is approx $1300.00 for gas, food supplies, and camp cost if I hook up with someone in the Chicagoland area. Less if I pick someone up along the way or meet up in Red Lake. If you go to chimolodge.com you can see the camp costs that is likely based on the main camp (Roderick) costs. I plan on buying necessary non-perishable supplies down in Illinois and perishables up in Red lake. Only other expense is gas cost to share depending on where I hook up with my new partner. Pretty reasonable for a fly-out in Northwestern Ontario! I've been going to Chimo for many years now and am very happy with how things have been. I plan to take care of all necessary shopping and already have vehicle for trip. I just need a partner to fill in for the one I lost to family illness. To be brief.... I am 41 and have been to a wide variety of Peter's camps at Chimo Lodge over the last 12+ years. I have always had a great time and his camps have always been productive. Believe it or not I am actually a pretty nice guy. I can find a partner to join me later this year and next, but I get married in August ---- so if I want to fish this year I need to go for when I have planned June 14-21st. I know this is short notice, but it could still be ideal for someone retired or that has a flexible work schedule. Any questions? Ask away..... I'll go up by myself if I can't find a partner this short notice, but it is always a little more fun to have someone to share the experience. I look forward to some responses......."
574519,SCOTT S,2008-05-31 10:28:00,11,Still looking for a partner... Isn't anyone interested?
574530,SCOTT S,2008-05-31 17:43:00,11,"Boy, I sure would like to find a partner.... sooner than later!"
574531,Guest,2008-05-31 17:54:00,0,"Boy. I sure would like to be that partner if you could just convince my wife. Two weeks in Wisconsin in July,then a week with Chimo in September puts me in a bind. Going to Keeper River camp. Ever been there?"
574532,SCOTT S,2008-05-31 18:29:00,11,I have been to Keeper River 4 or five times. Have you been there yet?
574533,SCOTT S,2008-05-31 18:36:00,11,"I have been to Keeper River 4 or five times. Have you been there yet? Fishing on the South Portage has always been great. If you are looking for Northern...Northern Lake is the place to go, but don't expect to find any walleyes in that lake. Lots of northern though. I'd love to have ya join me if you could convince your wife. I've been going to Chimo for a while now and have hit most all of his camps. Some more than others. Always productive though. Spoke with Peter this morning. Late ice-out impacted several camps that didn't get their bookings because of the ice. Now that is a bummer. Fishing by myself beats not getting to go due to ice! Seriously though.... Talk your wife into letting you go! You only live once.... :)"
574541,SCOTT S,2008-06-01 09:13:00,11,":help: It is now 11 days before I leave, but I hope to find a partner before next Sunday. I would like to get most of the non-perishable food supplies squared away. I plan on taking care of just about everything prior to the trip. My new partner just needs to let me know if there are any particular food supplies to buy in addition to the basics. Other than that, he/she needs to get his fishing gear/personal items packed and prepare to catch a lot of fish. Like I have said before... I have been to Chimo a lot of times in the past, I am fairly experienced, and I have always had productive trips. I don's care if my new partner is a novice or qn experienced fisherman. A novice will appreciate being able to fish at an excellent camp with an experience fisherman and an experienced fisherman will appreciate being with someone that he/she won't have to worry about in any aspect. Cost is very reasonable and I would encourage you to visit chimolodge.com to learn more about the camp. Chimo has an excellent reputation as a great camp. Those that have visited return year after year. Why go anywhere else when you have found a camp with great fishing, accomodations, and owner who is fair and does all the right things to keep his camps in great condition. I hope to hear from my new partner soon. It has been pretty difficult thus far to find a short-notice partner, but due to family illness my other partner had to back out. I can fish by myself, but it is always a little more fun to share with someone else. Most people I know would be willing to join me, but with such short-notice it is difficult. I get married in August---- so for me it is June 14-21 or not at all as this year goes. Respond back soon! :grd:"
574549,Guest,2008-06-01 20:47:00,0,"Scott, was in the same situation as you where our group of 6 had one back out due to a family matter. We did get another person to join but we offered the person a discount. The camp required us to make a deposit of $400 per person at booking. Well our new member got to use that $400 that the other person made as a discount off his package price. So the person that backed out lost his deposit to the person taking his spot. Hope you find a person, I would but I just got a new job and do not have any vacation time. If I was still laid off I would jump at the chance. Good luck my friend and enjoy the fishing whether alone of with a partner."
574550,SCOTT S,2008-06-01 21:07:00,11,"I'd love to offer discount if a deposit was out there, but there's not a deposit out there to work with. Deposits weren't an issue due to my partner being close friends with Peter the camp owner. My partner has been friends and going to his camp for many years (several decades actually)! Thanks for the thought and I hope others read my post and someone is in a position to join me! Scott"
574598,SCOTT S,2008-06-02 20:57:00,11,"Still looking for a partner... Isn't anyone interested? Boy, I thought it would be a little easier to fill a spot on a great week at a great camp! Still hoping to find someone soon!"
