575412,Guest,2008-06-24 07:27:00,0,Water is really high... They have been moving water for the last month or so. Hope the flow keeps up but I guess it will depend on mother nature. Didn't get a spring bite on the river but Manigotagan 45min north or PIne Falls is on fire. They get a really good greenback run at this time of year. All the fish we caught last fall are in that river system right now. Cranks and spinners are working.
575414,Guest,2008-06-24 08:24:00,0,I the big fish caught all winter long in the south basin of lake wpg is an indication of next year. The green backs shoould be hot
