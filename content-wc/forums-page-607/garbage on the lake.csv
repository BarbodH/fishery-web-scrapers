We pick up after them, but they just keep throwing it out. We recently put out a new metal garbage can at the intersection of the road and the main highway, where a lot of trash is thrown out as they wait to get on. They still just throw it on the ground. Sad. As far as lake trash goes, in our situation, I think it is probably from a very few tourists that give everyone else the black eye. For those, we can only hope they find gas too high priced and stay home."

575233,v-bay gord,2008-06-20 06:09:00,3168,"What makes me crazy is the attitude of people who toss their garbage into lakes, streams and shorelines. I have boated up a scenic creek that connects the main lake to a beautiful trout lake. The water is crystal clear and I feel it is a real privledge just to be able to be there.....but what do I see all along the way, empty beer cans on the bottom. I really believe if I was to witness it happen I would probably end up in jail for assault. As I said in the other post, only one public lynching would solve the problem for good. Has anyone had an experience with actually catching one of these slobs in action, and what did you do (or not do) about it?"
575234,Guest,2008-06-20 06:35:00,0,"It seems to be a problem not only on the lake, but people seem to have no trouble throwing trash out their windows in nwo. I've been throughout the midwest states and canada and never seen it as bad as it is here."
575235,v-bay gord,2008-06-20 07:02:00,3168,I absolutely agree on that point. Head east on Hwy 17 early in the morning and the golden glint of numerous urine bottles is truly astounding. No wonder there are so many accidents involving truckers on this stretch of highway....trying to drive and pee into a pepsi bottle at the same time is crazy. It's too bad we do not have the same system of rest stops that the U.S. has along its Interstates.....would solve a lot of problems.
575236,rebs,2008-06-20 07:19:00,7587,"some people are just natural born slobs I guess. I see it here in WNY all the time, lake erie and ontario and along the upper and lower river. Its a shame people don't appreciate nature and what it offers us to enjoy. Canada is usually so clean every where, I believe they have larger fines for littering. These slobs are every where not just on the water ways, I have seen people that bought new clothes, auto parts etc and leave the tags, old parts, in parking lots right on the ground where they were parked. Throwing crap out the car windows while going down the road. Its a shame but there are people like that. we'll see ya on the water rebs"
575240,Guest,2008-06-20 09:00:00,0,"Rest stops do very little to curb the trucks urge to drive without stopping. I-25 in Colorado is littered with bottles of urine, beer cans and fast food wrappers. Catching them is almost impossible. Colorado sporadically uses inmates to clean the highways which seems apt."
575250,Guest,2008-06-20 12:39:00,0,"Hey Gord, the next time you go up that creek, how a bout pulling out a few of the dead heads?"
575261,Guest,2008-06-20 16:51:00,0,"Now tackleman, you sparked my interest in what you might know about a trout stream. Being that I am a fan of fishing speckle trout C&R only, I would probably give up some Gullrock secrets for a map of such place. But gettig back to the original post, what Pisses me off is the B-stards that think everyone wants to see their names painted on the rocks along the roadways. I fill if caught the taking of both index finger would be do justice. It's kinda hard to work a spray paint can with your middle finger."
575262,Guest,2008-06-20 17:01:00,0,"Bud if you had read the original post you would see that Gord went up the creek to get to the trout lake. no mention of speckled trout. But, the lake does have some dandy eaters of the lake trout species. One day I was fishing at the mouth of the river where it comes into Gullrock and noticed beer cans floating, was I ever mad thinking who in the world would purposely throw those cans in the river, there was a stream of them coming down and heading to the open lake. So being the good guy I am, I went to pull them out, they were unopened blue. I gotta tell you Bud, as our buddy Greg would say, I just cant catch a break. To pull out about 8 beer, on a hot day. What a bummer. Oh yes, I did take the empties to the dump."
575270,Skylane,2008-06-21 04:59:00,101,"We have a limited problem with things thrown in our lake also. What really kills me, that I can't understand, is all the trash they continually throw out on our local native reserve road. This is all year long. I guesss they just want Mickey D and Tim Horton to be one with nature as they are."
575280,Guest,2008-06-21 09:54:00,0,I would bet you that most of the garbage comes from the locals...and I'm not trying to be smart either.
