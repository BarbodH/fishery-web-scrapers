Has anyone ever used one of their camps? It sounded like a good deal from the info at the All-Canada Show, but of course they all have a pretty good pitch. Any advice anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated."

I would recommend the Northern portions of the lake. There is a river coming in and a few narrows with current. So even in August fishing was easy. The Almos bay outpost area should be good. I personally would not like the Funger lake outpost; it seems kind of isolated and a long boat drive to get to other good water. I am not familiar with the other outpost."

575278,Crede,2008-06-21 09:30:00,134,"SkipG - I would be interested in hearing about your experience with Wilderness North. I fished Makokibatan Lake 8 times with Liddles Fishing Adventures and always had a great trip. Wilderness North purchased them last year. I am considering a trip there for 2009, but your post concerns me. If you would rather comment off of this board, please e-mail me at [email protected]. Thanks, Crede"
