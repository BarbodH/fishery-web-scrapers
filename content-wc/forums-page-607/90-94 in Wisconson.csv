575293,Guest,2008-06-21 17:51:00,0,"Came through from Nungesser to Chicago suburbs Friday. There are some delays in parts, but not bad. The detour coming south through Duluth took about 15 minutes on a Friday at rush hour (Duluth Rush hour)Have a safe trip"
575325,Guest,2008-06-22 18:07:00,0,all of 90-94 is open in wisconsin with NO detours or delays. the only congested part is just west of milwaukee between delafield and johnson creek. they've reduced it to one lane as high water threathens a bridge.
575066,clemento,2008-06-14 08:27:00,48,Leaving two weeks from today. AAA told me 90/94 was closed in Wisconson. I am assuming this is a temporary problem due to flooding and will reopen soon. Can anyone give me any info.
575074,Guest,2008-06-14 11:43:00,0,You are correct sir
575084,Guest,2008-06-15 05:57:00,0,"I""ve heard much of sauk county which 90/94 runs thru is tough to get thru, AS WELL AS SECONDERY ROADS. I've heard the detour is about 4 + hours with the slow traffic. Everyone be sure you check before you leave this coming week. Call Wis. Dept. of Transportation, or see website!!!!!!!!!!! GOOD LUCK"
575087,Guest,2008-06-15 09:57:00,0,Just got back from the Minaki area on Friday. What typically is a 12 hour drive from Minaki to Madison took me about 16 hours. Detours everywhere. I basically zig zaged south on county roads Just be patient with the situation and roll with it. You can not control mother nature.
575088,Guest,2008-06-15 10:22:00,0,"Got back Friday night from LOW, detouring traffic off of eastbound 90/94 at Mauston, also a stretch of 94 was down between Madison/Milwaukee. In Duluth (southbound) we were detoured from the 53 bridge (Blatnick) to the I-35 bridge, anyone know why ? JJ"
575099,tly,2008-06-15 19:26:00,1900,"Bridge is under repair. Eastbound lane now, esetbound next week or so. They have found some deterioration."

575113,clemento,2008-06-16 11:21:00,48,Thanks for link. Will appreciate others giving updates as they return.
575253,Guest,2008-06-20 14:15:00,0,What's the latest on 90/94? Is there still work being done on the 53 bridge at Duluth? Leaving on the 26th.
575273,Skylane,2008-06-21 05:24:00,101,"90-94 was closed when I went south on Sunday but was open when coming back north on Thursday. Duluth the bridge is open going north but a detour when going south. If you are going up 502, they are working on that 20 mile bad stretch and the rumor has it that it is to be repaved. Joy!"
