Anyone out there fish the Keg and if so will you at least tell us where the rocks are ....and the good spots if your willin' mj"
575277,Hump,2008-06-21 08:47:00,578,I used to fish Keg quite often. Most of the rocks are on the left as you enter Keg and a few around the shore entering the chukuni river. I never had a problem.

575284,Guest,2008-06-21 10:26:00,0,"When you come from gullrock into Keg you'll go past the green marker at the entrance, then head toward the big island in the middle (on your left) when you get there, fish it (all around it). if you want to carry on to red lake then head from the island to the mouth of the river and when you get there, keep the green marker on your left. when travelling through keg, I always, always go toward the island then aim to one of the river entrances. There is a big banana reef in the middle if you take a direct line from the river entrances. fish the entrances (either one) and both sides of them. If you take it easy you will not have to much trouble and get a copy of the gullrock area from your camp owner it is pretty good as to the depths that will help you in Keg"
575289,Guest,2008-06-21 15:38:00,0,I was up there a couple of weeks ago and had no problem shooting straight across. As far as spots we fished the north west corner during a stiff east wind throwing shad raps. It is a bit tricky holding the boat with the trolling motor but it was worth it. Kevin.
575297,fishman10,2008-06-21 19:36:00,226,"i am a local working in red lake, i fished every night last week. we went from red lake to gullrock up the chikuni river with a big boat with no problem. stay between the buoys thru the river and into keg stay in the middle and head for the buoys. get a map from the sporting goods store and follow it. people were fishing keg every night around the mouth. we fished gullrock, the fishing was excellent. the best was jigging with minnows being by far the best bait. just follow the boats and you will catch fish."
575301,Guest,2008-06-21 21:04:00,0,"Thanks......I was told that coming from Gullrock into Keg that as you go past the buoys and into Keg, that if you wanted to go to the island(s) on the right that there were a lot of ""lower unit"" rocks and to be careful. ?????"
