2444825,deadhead1,2014-02-12 14:03:00,193,It is a good lake but being close to two major cities it gets a lot of fishing pressure. If you are driving all that way I would suggest going a bit further north and you will get away from the traffic and should get better fishing. If you are in the area doing other things and just want a day on the water thenyou can't go wrong.

2445265,Wickerman,2014-02-12 15:29:00,119,Deadhead is right. I would go further North. Having said that you will catch bigger Walleye without question on Last Mountain than a Northern Saskatchewan Lake.
2446649,deadhead1,2014-02-13 05:39:00,193,"Yes if you go to the ""north"", past the farm land you will not get as big of walleye but if you want big fish without going too far north head to Nipawin and Tobin Lake."
2446929,Mike Kansas,2014-02-13 07:39:00,1463,"Thanks, we have made the decision to go to Tobin. Mid September before the Vanity Cup and it's pre fishing. Thanks, Again Mike Kansas"
