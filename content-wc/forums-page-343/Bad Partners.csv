2389105,Bakefish,2014-01-27 10:17:00,1077,"The Bad Fishing Trip got me wondering about those that have had members of their party turn out to be less than desirable. No names. I have been going to Canada since 1975 or so and have been there with several different people. Some good, some not so good. One guy stands out in particular. I used to work with this fellow and fished with him locally. We'll call him Sam. One year, my usual partner and I weren't in real good shape with our vehicles and needed someone to come along that had a decent vehicle. Sam was out of work at the time and had a brand new Suburban, so we asked him if he wanted to tag along, all expenses paid, all he had to do was bring his vehicle. He jumped on the offer. Now, he had never been to Canada before so we weren't real sure how he would react. Well, we got there and ended up catching more and bigger northern that we ever had. Our first morning we caught in excess of 30 fish over 13 lbs., with several approaching 20 lbs. The total number of fish caught that morning was staggering. He asked if it was always that way. We told him that he was probably ruined for life, because that was definitely the exception. Right about day 3 he went to the main lodge and called home. He came back all depressed and remained that way for the rest of the trip. He definitely cast a pall on what was left of the trip. A few years later he asked if he could come again. After much discussion with my partner, and against our better judgment we agreed. This time it was a totally different situation. We arrived to cold driving rain and a 40 degree temperature drop. Fishing conditions were, to say the least, tough. Well, about day 3 we hopped in the truck and drove out to a cell phone tower so we could call home. Sam's turn came and we watched as his expression and animated conversation indicated that the call with his wife wasn't going too well. He got back in the vehicle and said, ""Well, she just ruined my trip."" I kind of expected that and said, ""No, you're 900 miles from home, if your trip is ruined, then it's your fault."" The rest of the week was a disaster. He sulked and pouted the entire time, except when he got drunk, and that he did. One day we went in for lunch and he started pounding rum and coke. After lunch we went back out and I realized that he had brought a giant drink with him. By this time he was loud and obnoxious. I told him that alcohol was illegal to have on board, and since it was my boat he had better get rid of it one way or another. You know which way he chose. When we would come in at the end of the day my partner and I would go to the fish house to clean fish and leave Sam at the cabin to start dinner. Every time we returned he had barely made any progress in his endeavor and was acting like a total fool. We also noticed that he would disappear by himself several times during the week, returning glossy eyed. When this nightmare of a trip got down to the last day it was time to pack up for our trip home. I asked Sam to give me a hand loading up the boat and getting it tarped before the mosquitos came out. Well he decided that he needed to work on cleaning the cabin instead. I tried to convince him that I needed help with the boat because #1, the bugs were starting up and #2, I had recently had knee surgery and was having some trouble climbing in and out of the trailered boat. Still no help. The ride home was pretty silent and seemed to take forever. We got to my house where he had parked his car. We separated all the gear and I left him in the driveway to load his car. I haven't spoken to him since. I think it's going on 4 years now. Any other stories?"
2389385,Guest,2014-01-27 11:22:00,0,"Your guys are lucky he, or you guys didn't get busted at the boarder with the pot that he was sneak smoking. My freinds son smuggled pot in. Thought it was funny. He was told not to try to bring it home, because if he got caught, his Dads truck,boat and everything in would be gone."
2389497,Bakefish,2014-01-27 11:40:00,1077,If we'd have gotten busted at the border I would've gotten charged for a lot more than smuggling.
2389905,bigwalleye1,2014-01-27 13:10:00,2632,"I trypically trip 4 guys and 2 boats. Had a partner (my dad) in my boat, and knew the other boat owner, fished locally with him a number of times. Had an opening for Canada and he was interested, told him he'd need a boat partner. Said he knew just the guy, older fella, good stick, and I was getting close to go/no go, so I gave him the go ahead. Last minute he gets a substitution, he brings his buddy who is there for a guided trip and vacation. I'm pretty clear, I plan the meals, buy the groceries, cook, I clean the fish, cook lunch, and there's three of you. Wash/dry/sweep, take your pick, work it out. You guessed it. Mr Special says it's womens work and he won't do it. Took my guy aside, and suggested he square his guy away, after my 70+ dad and I do the dishes. One day, He got dropped at the landing to get the trailer, and he goes blasting out of the lot, empty trailer in tow, running for town to get to the beer store before they close, while the boat and boat owner are sitting at the dock. Every day when we arrive at camp, Mr Special changes clothes, grabs a beer and goes to stand in the ice house because he's hot. Same story with the dishes, the cabin, etc. No offers to help, no help even when it's suggested it's his turn. By the end of the week, I was hot too. His guy couldn't get him moving, and I couldn't either. When he didn't like my lunch fare the last day, and insisted on cooking his own, that was the limit. That boat stayed on the island to feed Mr Special, and my boat went fishing. That evening, doing steaks and lobster tails on the grill and trying to pack the truck, He can sense that something's wrong. I asked him if he had a good time in Canada, and he sure did. I told him that was good, because he wasn't welcome with me again, and if it was up to me, I'd have left him on the island cooking his own lunch the day before. Lucky his buddy is more accommodating than I am. Found out later that is 100% Mr Special's MO. I can be wrapped pretty tight if my buttons get pushed hard enough, but my Dad is Mr Mellow, always has been, and he was ready to pop the dude. I've never had a bad trip, but that guy made that one ""memorable"". We laugh ourselves silly trying to figure out how he made it home alive.... Lesson learned. I meet all newbies. No exceptions."
2392081,Pikeslayer8,2014-01-27 19:57:00,1460,"Doing all the work, yeah, he has it coming to him."
2392329,HeHooksHimself,2014-01-27 20:46:00,725,"Pikeslayer, Sometimes it is just easier to get it done than try to explain how to do it to someone that presents themselves as with it as a jelly sandwich, you know what I mean?"
2393153,MrSimon,2014-01-28 08:04:00,922,"Last year I took my 15 year old cousin on a trip. He is a good kid for sure, but he barely says a word, spends all his time playing games on his phone, and doesn't seem all that in to fishing. And for some odd reason .... he always took like 45 minutes to an hour in the bathroom .... I can't imagine what was going on in there. Anyway .... I'm glad I took him and I think he enjoyed himself .... but it made me REALLY REALLY appreciate my regular guys."
2393177,packpro,2014-01-28 08:14:00,695,"Father and son were new guys to our group. We are pretty much a blue collar hard working group of guys. Nothing really fancy about anyone. We all love fishing, but life's circumstances have us only getting to enjoy it once a year. Our gear, mostly middle of the road in terms of expense. Our clothes are usually jeans, ball cap, and a sweatshirt. Just a group of ordinary guys. We all drive up as group and share some camaraderie along the way. Not these new guys they drive alone. So we have these two ""pretenders"" in camp for a week. On the first day they show up at the boat dock. OMG it looks like they just stepped out of the Eddie Bauer catalog. Fancy. Very fancy, and colorful. Those two outfits cost more than just about everything I brought. We gave them a packing list, so all this was personal choice. Our clothes list says ""this is not a fashion show. Pack the clothes your wife will not let you wear at home."" On the first day they follow in their boat. Fancy clothes aside we always make an attempt to make sure the new guys are having a great trip. We put them on best spots and we take lesser positions near by. It works, those fancy clothes fellas are reeling in 20"" plus walleye and a few over 25"". Turns out the fancy boys are meat hunters as well. They each keep four over twenty inches. In our area, each license is allowed one over 20"", but our group only keeps under 18"" Technically they are still legal. With 12 guys in our group we would be allowed 12 over 18"". Nevertheless the Eddie Bauer boys have now lost favor with the group. At shore lunch, they never lift a finger. You don't have to cook, but anyone can pick up, or set up. With this group you will never be asked to do anything, but you will be expected to have enough initiative to jump in and help were you can. They bring canvas chairs so they can relax. At the time, the first rendition of fluorocarbon lines were being introduced. Not perfect back then, and expensive. Not for the Eddie Bauer boys, they spooled every reel with the stuff. If you remember the first fluorocarbons had a memory and ""kinked"" like crazy after the first day of use.. We watched them for a few days fight and struggle with it freely unwinding from the high end spin cast reels. We thought they had enough so we extended another kindness and lent them some of the spare rod/reels we brought up. They were grateful, but still not helpful, and they still looked catalog pretty. Wait, do I smell cologne???????One of founding members fights it every year having gone through three back surgeries. He can't get around like he used to, but he is a good friend to all, and we pitch in to get him and his gear to/from the boat for fishing and shore lunch. He is a prideful man, and really appreciates the effort, so he pitches in anyway he can. He gets up one hour earlier than the group to get his stuff organized and he makes the coffee in the morning for the group. He needs that to feel like he is contributing. Well now they EB Boys are P.O.'d that he wakes up so early and shuffles around robbing them of their precious beauty sleep. The choice was to call them out and make a scene, possibly ruining the trip for the others, or to just let them be and make the best of it. The wise old sage says to leave them be, who are they are is punishment enough. We abide. On they way home they made arrangements with a non fish eater to take his limit. They drove with us to the border, and the exchange was made in International Falls. After that...taillights. We still see them and they inquire about returning but, that is the appropriate punishment, as they will not be back. The rest of us did not let their foolishness ruin the trip for us. What did they contribute.....well lets just say you do not want to wear anything new or colorful for fear of being labeled an ""Eddie Bauer boy"" much to the joy and laughter of the group."
2393321,dutchboy,2014-01-28 08:44:00,5717,"I took a friends kid with me one time. He was 14 and I could tell he was getting bored being in the boat. I took him to a small island (150 yards x 100 yards or so) and asked if he wanted to get out and explore around on his own. His eyes lit up and he said sure. I told him to grab his rod and two lures and dumped him on shore. I told him I would be in the bay right there and to wave or shout when he was ready to come back. I expected him to take 5-10 minutes to stretch his legs. I watched him bounce around the island for the next two hours. He would putz around a bit, then go down and cast a bit, then go mess around some more, fish ect, ect. Of the things we did that weekend that was the first thing he mentioned when I dropped him off at home. Sometimes I think kids don't know what's expected of them or what then can or can't do on those fishing trips."
2393609,BreezyPoint,2014-01-28 09:31:00,1581,"On my trips, I like to leave work behind. I once took a former high school buddy to the English River. Thought it would be a fun trip. We had some of the best fishing ever. But he wanted to talk about work constantly and I mean constantly - every minute of the trip. On the third day of the trip, I had my best northern pike fishing ever. We caught far in excess of 100 northerns over 10 pounds. Or should I say, I caught. He just sat in the boat and talked about work. I told him if he didn't drop work, I would throw him overboard.Well he continued and guess what, the first opportunity I pushed him over the side. The work talk stopped then for the duration of the trip and he began to contribute as well. He hadn't done any cooking or cleaning to that point.I guess the moral of the story for me is that I want a work free vacation and expect a contribution from all partners and I am not afraid to warn them or let them know."
2394065,deadhead1,2014-01-28 11:05:00,193,The worst I ever had was an ice fishing trip. I told my buddy I would bring the booze if he brought the mix. We have been friends for a long time and he knows I drink dark rum and coke. When we got out on the ice I brought out the dark rum and he brought out the mix-----it was a dozen of dark stout beer. Have you ever drank dark rum straight with stout beer as a chaser? We still talk about that.
2394857,Simple Man,2014-01-28 13:49:00,92,I think our group will implement a full blown interview process that rivals National Security Background Checks for future additions to the group to ensure we don't end up with stories like some of these.

2397081,kzoofisher,2014-01-29 04:04:00,5144,"Worst partner(s)? Probably me and my brother. My first trip to Canada, 30 years ago, was with my brothers brand new father-in-law and brother-in-law who were avid fisherman. I was the only avid fisherman in my family but had never been walleye fishing before, my brother hardly fished at all but he can sit looking at nature all day long so we figured it would go OK. And it would've too if only somebody had made it clear to the Smith's that my brother suffers from night terrors and what those are really like. After a long drive on dirt roads that had a lot of logging trucks on them we camped on an island because of bears and hit the water. Everything smooth and beautiful so far. I caught my first walleye, we saw loons, heard grouse drumming in the woods, saw a wonderful sunset, everything you hope for in a trip. Then came bed time. If you've never slept with anyone who suffers from a disorder like this it's hard to really imagine what happened next. My brother dreamed he was walking down one of those roads and was going to be hit by a logging truck. He started screaming, really screaming, in terror and tried to get out of the way. Unfortunately, between the sleeping bag and the walls of the tent he couldn't go far but he sure was trying. The rest of us woke up to the whole tent shaking like it was going to come down and blood curdling screams. Poor Mr. Smith thought my brother was being dragged out of the tent by a bear so he grabbed a big handful of black bear fur and started punching. John has very dark hair and the punching woke him up pretty quickly. You can imagine the adrenaline rush for the newbies. Me? I'd put up with this sort of thing for nearly 20 years, stuff being thrown around our room, dragged out of bed to save me from enemy fire, lots of screaming, so I just called him a few choice names like a loving brother should and went back to sleep. I don't think Mr. Smith or Gary slept much more. John had a couple more episodes during the week and I think the suspense of when the next one would come prevented some people from really getting their rest.That particular group never camped together again though some of us did go back."

2402769,brochet,2014-01-30 14:19:00,88,"ive been fishing Canada for some 40 years,it was always my truck, boat,all equipment,me doing all the planning,driving ,cooking,cleaning fish,ect,ect,ect.but if it wasn't that way I wouldn't have anybody to go with.and I wouldn't have all those fantastic fishing trips to remember."
2438426,troutwater,2014-02-10 18:13:00,299,"Unfortunately our group knows all too well about having a bad partner on our trip. First of all I had to ride up with my oldest brother(lets call him Dave) and his son for 15 hours up to our lodge as the other two were already up at the camp. Well as everyone knows the drive up 502 and beyond can be rather miserable...and I heard about it...the whole time. I remember several comments of, ""There is no reason to drive this far into Canada, I've seen two dozen lakes I could be fishing by now,"" and other such comments. He had put me in a bad mood thanks to all the complaining just by riding with him and scoffed at the offered of an ice cold beer by my other brother and friend when we finally got to the lodge. Then a few days later he went with his son and our friend(lets call him Leonard) to do some perch fishing while my other brother(lets call him Anthony) and I went fishing for muskie. Turns out they had the best day perch fishing anyone of us have seen and filled a 5 gallon bucket full of real nice jumbos. Well when we met them back at camp all he did was complain because they ""weren't walleye."" Nevermind it was the best day any of us had ever had fishing for perch. Anyways, Anthony and I only raised one muskie, but we found a spot LOADED with walleye and they were aggressively chasing our muskie baits. At dinner after hearing Dave complain, and complain, and complain we told him about the spot and said he should go fish it. Well Dave said it was too late in the day for the 20 minute boat ride......this was at 5 o'clock in the evening in the middle of the summer. I guess he didn't want to catch walleye that bad. The next day he finally decided to head over to where we saw all the walleye at. The fish were still there, but had definitely moved out some and weren't as aggressive. After catching several nice walleye Dave hooked a real nice one(which the size of it has grown over the years), but for some unknown mysterious reason he reeled the fish right up to his rodtip as my nephew was going for the net. Well sure enough the fish rolled and gill cut his line so he lost the fish as my nephew was trying to scoop it up. My brother Anthony and I heard the commotion and saw him slam his rod down, cuss, and then yell at my nephew who had started to cry(12 years old) because he thought it was his fault for not getting the net fast enough. Anthony and I found it very funny from a distance and Dave heard us laughing...probably didn't help things any. He then proceeded to fish for a full hour trying to get that last fish for the limit. Well when he finally did catch it turns out they already had the limit and spent that hour to be 1 over the limit. The rest of the week followed with him complaining every day about how crappy the lake is and other comments along those lines. By Friday he was very anxious to get home and was even packing my stuff into the truck while I was still out fishing in the early afternoon with Anthony and Leonard. We did have some fun with him on the way home though. Anthony and Leonard somehow convinced him that they were way ahead of us...like 40 miles when they were actually behind us thanks to a pit stop in International Falls. I thought Dave was going to blow up the Tahoe trying to catch up to them on the way home...pretty funny. Sorry for it being long winded, but I feel better now"
2456169,bigwalleye1,2014-02-16 08:22:00,2632,"Wow...HE was anxious to get home??? Interesting read, Trout, but only two questions remain. With him being family, did he get therapy or did the rest of you? and Did it help?"
2462057,troutwater,2014-02-18 05:06:00,299,"Big,Yes he was very anxious to get home...you know because the lake sucked and was no good...just ask him. The only kind of therapy we had was not inviting him back on any more trips, but our nephew went last year(caught his first muskie at 40 inches) and is now going every year with us it looks like. We all love it when he starts ripping on his dad. I could go on about another incident last summer, but that's another story."
2394169,IaDave,2014-01-28 11:29:00,476,"Reading Packpro's post reminds me of the time I went with a guy I worked with for 20 yrs. He had always talked about camping on the Bloodvein River in Manitoba back in the 80's so when he retired we went up to Lac Suel at an American Plan camp and hired a guide for 3 days. I'm glad it wasn't a fly-in because his duffel bag must have weighed 100# packed with clothes only. When he got to the cabin he unpacked his clothes on a spare bed- I think he had enough to last 2 weeks w/o doing laundry and he put them in nice little stacks. Then he dug out his shoes and he had 3 pair of white tennis shoes(the same make & model) that looked brand new. Keep in mind we are good friends and still are to this day so we can kid each other. I said "" why 3 pair?"". He said "" 1 to fish in, 1 in case they get wet and 1 to wear to dinner"". After we came in the fist day he showered and got ready for dinner- I swear he was dressed like he was going to a b-bque at the country club. I just laughed and he gave me a dirty look as I'm in the same clothes that I wore fishing. Still had a great time but I can't imagine he dressed like that when he was camping."
2394217,packpro,2014-01-28 11:39:00,695,"Had one odd man trip so we switched around fishing partners and fished 3 to a boat. One guy just didn't fit. We are a one for all all for one. Most of us are in businesses were we have to compete or not eat. Highly stressful every day. This trip is an escape from all that pressure. Not him, A whole day of, ""mine was better"", ""Mine was bigger, I caught more."" ""We have to try another spot"" so I can get the next +1"" bigger fish. If you are on a walleye bite, he wants pike, and vice versa. If you get bit off, once you retie, you will find that the whizzing sound over your head while rerigging, was him fishing every spot on your side of the boat. Then he insulted the camp guides by relaying that other guides in other camps got to drunk to show up when hired. Our guides were from the same tribe and were nothing but ultra professional and highly successful in putting us on fish. Pretty embarrassing for us since it took place in front of the entire group. Or there was the time he spent a day talking about just how great his marriage was, and how wonderful his wife and life are. The other two guys in the boat....recently divorced and just looking for the escape that take us to Canada in the first place. Summary.....no social skills and even less of a clue."
2394721,Mike Kansas,2014-01-28 13:21:00,1463,My worst fishing partner is my wife. She always catchs more and bigger fish than I do which is actually fine with me. It's the long winter of hearing about it that bugs me.
2390265,Pikeslayer8,2014-01-27 14:42:00,1460,"I'd bet he somewhat learned a lifelong lesson here. Don't piss off Bigwalleye1 Great thread there Bakefish and awesome story!When my dad first started going to Canada in the late 60's, it was more of a business trip. He was a Dupont explosives distributor, one of 3 in the state. All three of these guys began going together and began bringing important customers along. Wasn't long before my dad abandoned taking customers and began taking his sons but the other two continued to bring highly valued customers.I've been on several of these trips and of all the guys (Iowa quarrymen) ole John G. was the absolute worst. Like BW's Mr. Special, he thought everything should be catered for him. He would sit around camp expecting the fish to be filleted, meals cooked, motors gased up and dishes washed by everybody else. My dad was between a rock and a hard place as John was not his customer and did not want to ruin his relationship with Ralph, but my dad was workin his arse off on these early trips. Wasn't too long till my dad had a little talk with Ralph about John, encouraging Ralph to get John to try to pull his own weight. Well, the next year John came with Ralph and it was obvious that ""the talk"" helped and ole John pitched in where ever he could. He apologized to all of us and said that he just didn't know what to do. I remember my dad saying that we are not there to tell ya what to do, if there are dishes that need washing or food that needs cooking, jump right in and be a part of the group. Apology accepted.Bit of a side story on ole John. When we flew into camp and we are unloading the airplane, ole John was smoosing with the guys coming out. They told John that this particular spinner type lure was the hottest thing going(looked a bit like a Prescott Spinner on steroids with feathers and chains), and that they only had 1 left but he could buy it for 20 bucks(35 some years ago). Well, ole John bought the lure and as my dad would gleefully tell this story year after year, about ole John dragging this high dollar lure around the entire lake with nary a bite. Ralph and ole John, may you both Rest in Peace."

2390897,Skywagon,2014-01-27 16:44:00,1106,Words to live by. That applies to more than a fishing trip.
2391241,HeHooksHimself,2014-01-27 17:54:00,725,"We were a guy short one year and good ole Dunkin' Bob said he had a buddy that was very anxious to join us. We said sure and since then we have had a lot of fun at his expense impersonating him. It started with the trip up when Doc told a joke that included the word ""squaw"" in the punch line. There was nothing derogatory about the joke but it did need to be told from a native American point of view to be funny. Well Chief FullaBull, as we named him, began to lecture us on how offensive the term squaw is (maybe it is, not the point) and then launched into this fantasy about how he was the grand chief for a local tribe in his home state. Now this guy is whiter than Steve Martin and Dunkin' Bob thought it was al BS, but that was his story. Hence ""Chief FullaBull""All week long he watched the other three of us work, preparing his food and cleaning up after him as well as cleaning his fish. He would stand there, hands in pocket, large stomach protuding, flat footed and chin on his chest and watch the work happen. As you can imagine, every once in a while one of us assumes the ""Chief"" pose when we can't think of what to do or we are obviously watching someone else work.Several quick things that he is known for:1. One night we were all fast asleep when all of a sudden a blood curdling scream comes from the Chief's bed. All of us sat up in our bunks startled from the terrifying scream. There is old Chief hopping around the cabin screaming ""I got a cramp!"" Now I know that cramps can be uncomfortable but really? As you can imagine every once in a while one of us will scream loudly about a phantom cramp.2. One day Chief was dragging around a basic smithwick floating lure completely silver. Finally he hooked a mid 20's inch pike, like we have all caught about a million of and he was so proud of his lure choice he offered us an opportunity to use his lure for the rest of his week. now when one of us hooks a mid 20 inch northern it is usually accompanied by an offer to the other anger in the boat to use the lure.3. Chief had a hard time staying on his feet most of the week. One time after tripping over a root he uttered, ""I'm a little clumsy with my boots on."" Now whenever anyone slips or trips, it is followed with that phrase.4. One day Chief was fishing in the front of the boat and he couldn't find a jig head that he had out to hook up on his line. After looking around for an inordinate amount of time, he found it hooked onto his pants in the butt area. Now whenever someone drops a jig head or can't find one, it becomes a reliving of that moment.5. Chief would tell stories of fishing on the Great Lakes and he would describe a place like we were there with him. ""Yeah, we were down where that stream comes into Lake Michigan with that line of rocks. Sam and Sally (who?) were up on that jetty by the boat slips....."" Now every now and again one of us will break into a description of an event and begin describing it like the Chief.6. We asked Chief to make sure he had a PFD and he spent the week in Canada with one of those puffy orange vests that secure only at the neck and it was just an amusing picture.Now, I am not saying we wouldn't allow the Chief on another trip, but there just hasnt been room for him since that trip. We might invite him again just to get some more comedy routines."
2391289,davenathe,2014-01-27 18:00:00,113,Fortunate to have great partners. Everyone chips in and does something. We get in from fishing 2-3 guys get started on fish while the rest of us tiddy up cabin and begin preparing meal. All goes smooth and we all get to relax that much sooner.
