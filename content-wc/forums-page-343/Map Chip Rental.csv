2439378,icepro680,2014-02-11 07:01:00,74,Lowrance owns the insight maps that can be used on their units.
2440258,Obabikon,2014-02-11 09:53:00,2370,"Yeah a couple years ago, hummingbird purchased lakemaster. So, lowrance started producing their own chips (or purchased a company to do it under the lowrance name)"
2426474,Obabikon,2014-02-06 18:44:00,2370,"Lowrance is not a downloadable chip, so that might be different. Also, rentals is not in the ""prohibited uses"". Reproduction and copys/redistribution are banned of course."
2426690,LOW1,2014-02-06 20:05:00,2828,"I don't want to sound like a scrooge, but your guests/lessees would not have license and your license is limited to your use."
2426874,Obabikon,2014-02-06 21:01:00,2370,"We will see. I don't think it's an issue. If the license was limited to ""my"" use, then it'd actually be illegal to loan it to a friend. Since they technically hadn't paid for it."
2427042,James Morris,2014-02-06 22:11:00,544,"LOW1, if your perspective is accurate, wouldn't that prohibit selling chips in the secondary market as well?"
2427202,LOW1,2014-02-07 05:20:00,2828,"Yes. Whether the maker of the cheap feels it is worthwhile to pursue the matter in that scenario is another issue. I suspect that the manufacturer is more likely to address situations where the chip is rented, but that's a business decision."
2428482,James Morris,2014-02-07 10:44:00,544,"I suppose I'll summarize my thoughts this way - from the legal perspective I don't agree with your assessment, but another interesting and relevant question is - would it be ethical? If someone wanted to work out a chip rental business, the right thing to do would be to have a discussion with the company and work out a mutually beneficial deal."
2438290,Obabikon,2014-02-10 17:41:00,2370,"Ok... got an email back from Lowrance. Renting CHIPS is not against any rules. Not a very descriptive email, but it works. ""Hi Jared, Yes, it is ok to rent the chips. Thank you for choosing Lowrance! Donna"""
2438602,CamoHunter,2014-02-10 19:32:00,363,"I didn't think there'd be anything wrong with it. It kind of seems like the old movie rental stores (before Netflix and online). They bought the movies outright, and made their own profit off of their initial purchase investment. If you want to purchase enough mapping chips to supply the demand for map chip rentals, and the risk of losing them occasionally, then more power to you. Like any rental business, you have the large cost of purchasing several chips upfront, and it will take XX number of rentals before profit kicks in."
2438618,CamoHunter,2014-02-10 19:34:00,363,Does Lowrance make any map chips? I thought Navionics and Lakemaster were the main two players in this field.
2407545,btmbncr,2014-01-31 22:59:00,492,James Morris I have no idea what you are talking about . If I produced a GPS chip and sold it I would be real upset if you rented my chip out if that was against our sales agreement. I am after all a principled Curmudgeon.
2407593,Nimstug,2014-01-31 23:55:00,2605,But wait; There's more!! For a limited time we'll also include a second chip. Just pay extra shipping and handling...
2408169,dutchboy,2014-02-01 08:28:00,5717,
2408441,Obabikon,2014-02-01 10:20:00,2370,"I'm not sure that it would be against any sales agreement. As a camp owner, I'm allowed to rent things (boats, gps units, depth finders, trolling motors). These companies happily sell to me, knowing I will be making a profit off of their equipment. As long as you don't reproduce the chip, I can't imagine the chip being any different than the other items mentioned."
2408473,CamoHunter,2014-02-01 10:47:00,363,I'm not sure how it is much different than a movie rental? Or tool rental. Or anything else for thar matter.
2408601,kzoofisher,2014-02-01 11:27:00,5144,"It depends on the licensing agreement. If you rent out the chip are you sending royalty checks to Navionics? Netflix pays a small royalty every time you watch something, I don't think tool rental pays royalties. Can you buy a single chip and then load it on 10 different sonars among your friends? The new SonarCharts program is taking advantage of crowd sourcing to build detail but you pay to sign on to that. An outfitter who has bought ten units to put on ten boats is doing as much or more advertising as he is ""renting"" the units and he could use that crowd sourcing of the lake very much to his advantage. Just imagine the detail you would get from the logs of ten boats fishing the same lake everyday for a season. I would carefully read the agreement before building any sort of business model based on rental."
2408673,Obabikon,2014-02-01 11:41:00,2370,"Technically, if it's illegal to rent the chips, then it is illegal to have them in rented equipment. Meaning, any boat that a resort owns, could not have a lake chip in it. Simply because that would be the equivalent of renting it. The more I think this through the more certain I am that there is no legal issues with renting the chips. The chips we have are not downloadable. So, it is one unit for one chip."
2426154,KHedquist,2014-02-06 17:08:00,4367,What plotter do you have now? Do you fish in the US and do you have a chip now? If so what chip?
2426226,LOW1,2014-02-06 17:28:00,2828,There's your answer^ Read the fine print. You can't rent your Word program either. And they may be watching you.
2426314,Obabikon,2014-02-06 18:00:00,2370,I sent lowrance a detailed email asking if units and corresponding maps are allowed to be rented.
2402737,icepro680,2014-01-30 14:12:00,74,"Has anyone ever seen this or thought of doing it? I am looking to go to Canada for the first time and am starting to look at map chips. I dont know when I will every go back to Canada if I do go, so the $100-$150 chips seems like a reach for me. In the back of my head I was thinking a guy could buy a couple chips and rent them to the non-annual Canada guys like me, to basically pay for theirs. Now I understand there are license agreements with everything these days, so I don want to get into a debate over legallity of actually doing this. But it does seem like a good idea. (Remember me when you are making millions doing this)"
2404289,Tamarack,2014-01-30 21:04:00,16,If you come to our camp. We have gps units with the chip already installed. They are hummingbird 788's and come as standard equipment on all of our camp boats.
2404673,Skywagon,2014-01-31 06:00:00,1106,I think you can buy ad space on this site Tamarac.
2404785,btmbncr,2014-01-31 06:47:00,492,"Far be it from me to be the ""ethical policeman"" but renting the chip rather than buying it just doesn't seem right. Buy the chip,use it,if you don't go back to Canada,sell it."
2404993,dutchboy,2014-01-31 07:32:00,5717,It's only a half ad. For a full ad they would need to include phone number and web address.
2405001,dutchboy,2014-01-31 07:38:00,5717,"You could follow the infomercial models.FREE GPS chip, just pay $15 per week shipping & handling. Then mail it in a .49 envelope with a pre-paid return envelope included. Take a credit card only for the transaction with a automatic $150.00 charge after 2 weeks."
2406281,Obabikon,2014-01-31 12:35:00,2370,"I'm not sure what model you have, but I know that Lowrance chips have lots of different lakes (including Lake of the Woods)"
2406441,port1042,2014-01-31 13:42:00,509,"Are there any good maps for the smaller lakes in NW Ontario? I fish Cedar, Cliff, Perrault, and Wabaskang. If there are good chips available for these, I'd buy one. Are there?"
2406505,James Morris,2014-01-31 14:18:00,544,"In practice, that's not much different than renting the chip if you view the purchase as a ""deposit"" of the value of the chip and the money from the sale as a return of the deposit less a sum for the use of the chip. Only one unit can access the data at a time. If someone was talking about copying / redistributing data, that is another story all together."
2407049,tackleman,2014-01-31 18:12:00,444,"if the cost of a lake chip is causing you to put off your trip, I would suggest that you shouldn't be coming to Canada with such a tight budget.What I did, I purchased last seasons chip at Cabelas for $50 less than the current years chip. works just fine and has my lake on it so i'm set for the seasons to come."
