2445689,camp chef,2014-02-12 17:43:00,915,"My fishing partner usually uses the lightest jig he can get away with given the depth and speed of the drift. I , on the other hand usually use the heaviest jig I can get away with during the same drift. Some days his catch rate gets me to change and other days he ups the jig weight. You never know what they are going to prefer. We have both switched to using a snap swivel to connect the jig to the line. walleye catch rates have not gone down and Northern saw jobs have gone down by probably 90%."
2448481,Mike Kansas,2014-02-13 13:28:00,1463,Once in a while I will drift jigs in deep water on structure. I like deep points and sunken islands for this and it is done later in the season after transistion has occured. I like a 3/8 or 1/2 oz jig and I have a plastic minnow dressed with a minnow or worm. At times I will put 4 glass beads ( different color than jig)above the jig for some contrast and an increased bait profile. I try to stay at about a 10 to 15 degree angle in my line so I can stay in touch with the jig and vary my jigging action from aggressive to just letting it drift. Great way to catch some bigger fish and have caught some nice Pike doing this. Mike Kansas
2449985,roscoe33,2014-02-14 01:40:00,653,"We usually use Fireline 10 or 14, as we are in pike infested waters and the heavier line helps with bite-offs, but it just doesn't work with lighter jigs. When the fish are finicky and less active, I will drop down in jig size, first to 1/8, then down to 1/16 if needed. This will usually mean I need to switch to a rod with lighter line, 6 or 8# mono. Our resort owner fishes with 3/8 and 1/2 ounce jigs, and is only looking for active fish. He will hit 5 or 6 spots, and call it quits. We generally use ball jigs, but I like the Northland fireball stand up jigs. They keep the minnow up off the bottom an inch or 2. They do tend to get stuck in the rocks a little easier, so I tend to use them on soft bottoms, or on gravel."
2437362,gordy28,2014-02-10 13:02:00,437,"Hey thereIn prep for our trip this summer I have been doing lots of reading, watching - specifically for late summer (3rd week of August)Our group has fished this time of year before - but typically we have pulled or drifted harnesses behind bouncers and done some vertical jiggingHave noticed quite a few videos and posts talking about drifting with jigsSo - few questions:Line at a 45 degree angle similar to trolling with a btm bouncerImparting action (lift drop etc.) or simply dragging?Specific speed you are looking for?Any type of structure where this would be a better technique - expecting the lake we will be on will have a weed and a structure bite (described as: has a gravel bottom and is weedy with a depth of 15 to 40 feet. )Thanks in advance for any tipsCheersGordy"
2437506,octanehi5,2014-02-10 13:54:00,1104,"when jigging the closer to vertical the better. when not drifting jig up and down, when moving need a small jigging motion or just drag, speed as long as you can keep contact with the bottom. Rock piles, humps, weed lines, areas that the water constantly moves thru"
2437698,MrSimon,2014-02-10 14:50:00,922,"The correct drift speed is usually not the same speed as the wind. Which means some method to either slow down or speed up the boat. Personally, I think the slower the better. I like to have my jigs as close to vertical as possible .... even when drifting. Sometimes no bouncing .... sometimes hard pops .... experiment."
2439186,BornToFish,2014-02-11 06:28:00,1224,"I fish in NW Ontario for two weeks in early August and then again for two more weeks in mid-September. I believe that not all walleyes are doing the same thing at any given time. Some walleyes are suspended chasing baitfish, some are on structure and some are using weeds. One thing that I've noticed for the structure and weed walleyes during August and September is that they tend to be in bunches. If you can find one walleye on structure or near weeds, you probably found them all. I focus on structure walleyes. Vertical jigging is the name of this game. The question is always: what depth are the walleyes using? The range in depth can be very narrow (e.g. 26-28 fow) in August as the lake temperature is near its peak. I haven't found a technique better than vertical jigging to keep my lure in the strike zone at all times. I do drift with rigs such as bottom bouncers, but I use this as a search technique. For example, I might SLOWLY drift or back troll along a weed edge or a particular contour line off a weed edge. I abandon the drifting/backtrolling technique as soon as I locate some active fish. I don't want to drift away from a school of active fish - have a good reason to leave fish to hopefully find fish. I sometimes anchor but most often vertical jig this area to more fully explore it for fish. I return to drifting or backtrolling if nothing develops. However, my experience is that if I can catch one, there are often more in the same area. Good luck in your upcoming trip. Show them no mercy!"
2440442,ftfarms,2014-02-11 10:39:00,444,We drift jig a lot I like to maintain about 0.4 mph on my gps it's usually close to that. I like using whistler jig and drag them with a slite twitch every now and then. A lot of the time we find there following along and need inticed. This is my favorite way to catch walleye. All you need is whistler jigs and I also like nuckle ball jigs both out perform regular jigs by a long way. I use live bait and no plastics Well I will use a piece of plastic to hold the bait on.
2440746,tv4fish,2014-02-11 12:10:00,2694,"We vertical jig mostly by using a ""controlled"" drift. Once we find the depth that the walleyes are in - let's say off an island point or ??? - that is the depth we will work by controlling our drift with my trolling motor to try and stay at that depth. Obviously, the wind speed is going to have an effect on our speed, but we try to move rather slowly as we work that depth - it is not uncommon for us to have doubles and triples as we do this. We have experimented with quite a few ""techniques"" over the 30 years we have been going ""up North"" and this has been the most productive. We drop down to bottom and lift up only about 1-1 1/2 foot and let it drop again. If you're working Canadian shield type bottom - you need to have a good ""feel"" when you set it down - they have ""hungry"" rocks up there. We certainly DID go through a lot of jigs the first few years - but experience is a good teacher....."
2440922,Tylumps,2014-02-11 13:02:00,73,"Don't forget slip bobbers. When anchored, and you have some luck vertical jigging an area but the bite seems slow, try a slip bobber. These can be used at any depth and a plain hook with live bait works best. A little breeze moves the bait up and down and over an active fish area. The only trick is when a bobber goes doewn at depths 20-30 feet you need to reel in all the slack and point your tip down to the waters surface and set the hook with a long stroke where your rod tip is way over your head. With a little chop in the water, this is a deadly presentation. Use metal collar bobbers only. Cheap plastic line holes wear quickly and screw up the depths. Good luck!"
2440946,Sportdog,2014-02-11 13:12:00,6735,"My fishing partner trolled a ball head jig and minnow while I was pulling crawler harnesses and did just fine. Not vertical, long lining. As always YMMV."

2445633,gordy28,2014-02-12 17:26:00,437,Sure is thanks all for the tips. Greatly appreciated 192 days to go. Woo hoo Gordy
