2427762,MrSimon,2014-02-07 08:10:00,922,"I always pay the full deposit myself ahead of time, and then make a big stink about the guys reserving their spot by giving me the deposit in January. Truth be told though, I don't care if they pay me on time, late, or never. I love fishing with my crew so much that I'd personally finance the entire trip just to spend a week in Canada with them each year. So far, I've never been stiffed and everyone pays mostly on time."
2427850,HeHooksHimself,2014-02-07 08:26:00,725,Can I get on your crew?
2432570,jimmie,2014-02-08 22:08:00,123,"There always seems to be at least one that either does not know how to read or tell time and gripes about every penny. Usullay that is the one the best one off financially! Go figure. Even drives a Caddy! After a few years eveyone ( the other three of us) got thier $$ on time and I let them know ahead of time by months so there would be no question. Always kept the deadline an actual secret just in case another penny picher joined our group. We all came to a consensus after year three that Mr. Caddy should not be invited. He got so PO'ed he never spoke to any of us again when we did not invite him. He never got it. Now tow of the guys are in declining health and the other moved to a warmer climate. Now I fish alone and enjoy the solitude . . . most times without regret. I don't mind a few extra pennies out of pocket but then I kept all the cash receipts for Mr. Caddy that he never bothered to pay. Just a few small m,eals and a bit of extra gas and part of his resort bill. Other than that no problem likely saving for a neww Caddy!! Have a great summer guys and no matter what do not sweat the small stuff just find a replacement LOL"
2449961,roscoe33,2014-02-13 23:58:00,653,"Haven't had problems with deposits, but have had a few guys back out over the years. I even had to back out one year, as the mother in law died, and we had to fly across the country for the funeral. Getting people to commit at all is the problem. Seems they like to call me in April and ask if there is room. ""Um, no, we have a cabin with ""x"" beds, and they are all spoken for, and all the trucks are full. Unfortunately, our group is getting mighty small. Most that used to go, are in their 70's and eighties. I still take mom and dad (78 and 79) but that will be ending in a year or 3. I think mom will want to go until the day she dies, but at some point, her dementia and other health problems will be too much. Most of my buddies spend their vacation hunting, not fishing. So, soon it will likely be just me, and my nephew. In 5 years or so, he might bring his girls along. ??"
2451281,2746,2014-02-14 10:26:00,3206,"This could be the subject of a new thread.....""What could make you back out of a Canadian fishing trip?"" we have guys that would miss their MIL's funeral and never think twice about it."
2451833,bigwalleye1,2014-02-14 13:21:00,2632,"She'll never miss ya'.... Wife might, though...and that's how the fight'll start."
2452049,Sportdog,2014-02-14 14:46:00,6735,"My first Canadian trip came about as a result of someone backing out and I filled the void. I can understand why there could be multiple reasons for backing out, especially with the employment situation in some areas. Guys lose jobs, change jobs, unexpected drains on savings, etc. etc. Getting reservations well in advance is a necessity and lots of things can happen during the time span between deposit and hitting the road. Getting that deposit money committed will most certainly be a strong indicator that they are serious about going. That's about all you can ask of someone. If I had to back out on a trip, I would forfeit my down payment making it easier for them to get someone else to go and if was required that they have a certain number and couldn't find someone to take my place, I'd eat the entire cost. (Unless I was dead and that's why I wasn't going!) It's like getting a substitute on a golf league due to another commitment, you pay for the subs green fees."
2421089,Mark R,2014-02-05 10:02:00,1538,Does anyone else have a problem getting the guys in your group to commit and by commit I mean paying deposits in a timely manner or paying deposits at all? They say they will go but I'm never sure until 15 or 20 days before we leave. How do you get a firm answer yes or no from these guys?
2421105,SinOrSwim,2014-02-05 10:08:00,1528,"You need a base number of guys. Tell them there is a deadline date to have X deposits in or you can't reserve the cabin. So, if you need a base of 6 make sure at least 6 deposits are in and then you can let the rest wait awhile. But, for plannign purposes if they don't have a deposit in a few weeks prior then they don't go."
2421305,HeHooksHimself,2014-02-05 10:55:00,725,"Everyone that goes with us knows that the deposits have to be in by Jan. 1. No deposit, you are out."
2421313,JDP,2014-02-05 10:59:00,1457,"Sin or Swim is right.I have found that Communication works for me.I have organized Canada trips for a couple of decades.Dates, costs, trip details, trip participants, etc.Some years are more diificult than others.You may need a smaller/larger cabin some years as people drop in/out."
2422089,btmbncr,2014-02-05 14:20:00,492,In the past I have told members of the group I need the deposit money by such and such date.My guys have been serious about the trip and sent the deposit money. Now I go mostly with my wife.
2422137,octanehi5,2014-02-05 14:30:00,1104,"I have learned over the yrs. no matter who it is they are not going until you get their deposit. Also learned to keep the groups small very hard to get a large group to agree on anything. I have a prime time week in northern Quebec. I book as soon as I get off the plane,then fill the trip"
2422313,jdoaks,2014-02-05 15:10:00,89,we have steady group of 4 others come and go.ive kept it where i could do trip with 2. ive tried large groups they are fun but alot of id like to goes.we could put 2 more in on trip 1or2 days before we left just need to know how much food to buy.
2422321,Mr. Sauger,2014-02-05 15:14:00,285,"Yep, lots of guys say they want to go but won't pony up the cash when it comes to deposit time. Most years we have a core team of guys whose word is gold, have their act together, give you a solid commitment, secure the vacation time form work/spouse and offer the deposit cash without being asked. And then there are the other guys. They won't/can't provide a commitment and deposit because:· They can't plan that far ahead· Can't commit that far ahead (hey, something else might come up). Maybe a trip to Canada is not their #1 priority (blasphemy) · Can't get vacation time scheduled from work (crazy schedules or?)· Waiting for the OK from the Mrs.· Don't have the cash available for the deposit or are afraid they might not have the thousand for the trip later OK, then how do you work with these guys? We tried the bluff where we ask for deposit or else you don't go. That usually does not work as we are looking for an extra guy and cave in later. Pressuring them does not work, you sound like a nag and it still is ineffective.We have tried the buff where next guys with the cash gets to go, second guy stays home. We usually cave in anyway when they ask to join 30 days before departure. A few times we said sorry, we already have a full cabin/boat If someone is a real pain, we just stop recruiting them unless we are close to the trip and need a quick substitute. Or we tell them without a cash deposit you only get considered if someone else backs out. That way we can fully recruit others without feeling guilty. Bottom line  we take the chances and book the trips (thus rewarding the procrastinators). We've never been burned as are lucky enough to have great trips."
2422361,Richard B,2014-02-05 15:17:00,735,"My group has had issues even when people did give their deposit on time. One year we had 6 people going and 2 weeks before we were to leave 3 cancelled. Talk about ticked off. For that reason, we don't ask for deposits from the people that want to go. The rules are if you want to go the entire cost of the trip has to be paid by a certain date. If you can not go you do not get your money back."
2422505,Pooch,2014-02-05 15:54:00,4619,"Used to have this same problem about every year and finally got tired of it. Now keep our group small and the same guys every year. Rarely will one of this core group have to cancel, but they always let us know many months in advance and that usually gives us time to find a replacement.Some guys never commit or if they do then bail at the last minute making it tough to fill the position. We try to not invite them again. Sorry, but your decision or lack of affects all the rest of us in the trip, too.Sudden illness or family emergency are always reasons that the rest of the group understands and work around.Deposits in by a certain date or go to the next guy on the list usually keeps guys honest. As long as you are working with a group this will always be an ongoing hassle.Get a small group of like minded guys that are solid and committed to a trip and let the others put together their own trip. It's not rocket science!Hope everyone has great trips this year.Pooch"
