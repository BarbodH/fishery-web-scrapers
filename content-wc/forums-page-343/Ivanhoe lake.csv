2436402,aprils fool,2014-02-10 07:59:00,22,"I have been invited to go along with a group fishing Ivanhoe lake near Foleyet, Ontario. This will be my first ever trip to Canada. I was just wondering if anyone else has any experience fishing this lake. Are there any hp restrictions? Planning to take my 17' starcraft with a 90hp on it unless I can't. It sounds like I fish more often than anyone else going but am a serious rookie when it comes to walleye. Any info or advice of must haves for tackle,lure/colors would be greatly appreciated. PM's are welcome if you would rather contact that way. Thanks, Troy"
2436570,adempsey,2014-02-10 08:41:00,963,"I fished it for a week in late summer a few years ago. I can't imagine there are any restrictions on HP, the main lake isn't inside the park. Not sure about the ""river"" portion, but there is nothing indicated on the Provincial Park site. Also, Air Ivanhoe flies out of that lake.Walleye fishing is typical, depending on time of year. Earlier in the season I believe they will be down the river portion. It's a rather long extension of the lake and there are five boat-in outpost camps along it. You should do fine with the standard presentations used for inland Canadian lakes, such as jigging and pulling bait rigs.The really nice thing about this lake is the jumbo perch. They are true jumbos, which I have only caught in a few lakes. They are primarily in the river area, but we caught some in the weed beds in the main lake as well.Lots of pike hanging out in the pencil reeds as well. Never caught anything too big though.There are also a lot of whitefish in the lake. The lakes gets down to 60+FOW near the beach in front of the park. My sonar was showing them piled up, but we never managed to catch any. I am sure it's possible though, especially during the mayfly hatch.Good luck!"
2439066,aprils fool,2014-02-11 04:49:00,22,"Adempsey,Thanks for the reply. Just wondering what tackle you use targeting the perch? Do you use a traditional style perch rig with the beaded hooks? Or heavy jigs like Swedish pimples /hali jigs? Beaded spoons? Plain hook and sinker? Baits used? Minnows/ wigglers/waxies/crawlers ? Not sure of your regulations yet if some of these lures or baits are even allowed or available. Thanks for any info,Troy"
2439618,adempsey,2014-02-11 07:41:00,963,"Hmmm, not sure if I recall what tackle we used. Nothing out of the ordinary I am sure. No vertical jigs like Swedish Pimples or Halis. I might consider using a Slab Grabber, Jack Spoon or similar type of Russian spoon, but I've only used those ice fishing. Although, I'd bet all the ""ice fishing"" gear would work pretty well though.Most of the time it would be a worm on a jig head. I also like to use 1.5"" micro tubes, they work really well. Minnows would probably be ideal, but I am just too lazy to bother fishing with them 90% of the time. Everything you mentioned should work. The fish were more weed oriented or in the river in deeper pockets.Ivanhoe Lake is in FMZ 8. I did not see any exceptions to the standard rules for this lake."
2439802,bigdog8837,2014-02-11 08:17:00,30,I fished this lake about 3 years ago the first week of Aug. I just stayed in the main lake for my fishing. I just drift fished with a live bait rig with a floating jig head and leach and caught lots of walleye with the method. I also trolled husky jerks on the weed edges and cought lots of pike and some walleye that way. At that time of year the lodge owner said most of the walleye were on the main lake so we did not go into the river. I hope this helps and have a good trip. There are not any motor restriction I can remember.
2441642,aprils fool,2014-02-11 16:25:00,22,"Adempsey and BigdogThanks for the info guys its much appreciated. I tend to get a little ocd about making sure I am well informed prior to so that I can be well equipped. I am really looking forward to this trip I had to pass on the last couple invites but was able to get everything to come together this time.Thanks again,Troy"
2445913,Merc115,2014-02-12 18:59:00,1,I fish this lake every year around the beginning of July targeting walleye. I troll around the sunken island (middle of lake) using bottom bouncers with spinners and worm. In the evening you will see everybody still fishing around the sunken island. In the evening try trolling in front of the beach using the same set up. The mouth of the river is also popular for still fishing or go up the river till the first cottage where it gets narrow and cast using jigs in the fast water. The river gets shallow at some location but you should be ok. The only restriction is a slot size for walleye. Lots of pike in the river trolling along the weeds.NOTE: It might be the last year for the provincial park to be open.
