The ice will get the minnows very active and they are ingesting the salt. 2. When the minnows are dead usually 30 to 60 minutes, net them out of the water and place on large table with cardboard and paper towel. Pat them somewhat dry and start layering them in a bucket, pan whatever you have. minnows, salt, minnows, salt. Leave them there 2 to 3 hours (this is when you drink beer). 3. Take your minnow net (good sized one) and rinse the salt off the minnows (in the cooler you purged them in) and back on the cardboard and paper towel. Dry them as best you can (we put a fan on them) We then take gallon zip locks fold paper towel to fit and put 2 dozen minnows in each zip lock. Into the freezer. when we go to Canada we put all the minnows in a cooler with a couple freeze paks. When you go out in the mourning grab as many dozen as you need..happy happy happy...I've seen them out fish live minnows more then once. This method make the minnows very shinny."
2441986,drlee,2014-02-11 18:32:00,409,"I have purchased rather than prepared my salted minnows. I can get them really cheap in Fond du Lac, WI at a local bait shop. The guides on Winnebago actually use salted minnows a good deal of the time. I have been using them in Canada for many, many years and have had very good results. I have fished side by side with guys using live minnows and don't see any real difference. The only time I have had trouble getting fish on salted minnows, I have switched over to night crawlers and that solves the problem. I think that during late summer, the minnows are so plentiful in the lakes that something different, i.e., crawlers, result in a better bite. I am flexible. I have used leeches when guys are catching lots of walleyes on leeches. I have gone to live minnows on rare occasions, but would not hesitate if that is what will get me fish. When I am spending about $1,000 for a week in Canada, if I have to spend $3.50 a dozen for live minnows part of the week, so what? Just my thoughts..."

Pack a few dozen in a zip-lock bag between a paper towel and store in the freezer.http://www.lakemichiganangler.com/ti...ed_minnows.htm"

2431410,yoopertrout,2014-02-08 13:29:00,1172,"Greetings, Thinking ahead to this summer's Canada trip, and the high cost of bait at the lodge. I've seen lots of mentions of salted minnows on this site. Is it legal to take frozen or salted minnows to Canada? How do you salt them? Do you just pack them in pickling salt and let them dry out, removing the wet salt? I'm thinking I can set some minnow traps this spring and stock up. How long do they keep after salting? Thanks."

2432330,BornToFish,2014-02-08 20:09:00,1224,"I read a post on this forum last August/September that pertained to how to salt minnows. The process involved one pound of minnows and a mixture of salt and borax. I followed this procedure and was quite pleased with the result. You should be able to find this post with a simple search. I had no issues crossing the border with the salted minnows. They worked very well for me. They were a bit messy in terms of salt on the hands and making its way onto equipment. The salted minnows stayed on the hook. We kept them in a sealed plastic container, with paper toweling, in the refrigerator. We took out just enough for the next outing on the lake. My limited experience with frozen minnows is that they get mushy."
2432354,BornToFish,2014-02-08 20:15:00,1224,"This information is from a post by ""FishOil"" entitled ""How to Salt Minnows"" on this forum: I thought I'd start a new thread for this since people are always asking and this should make it easy to find with a search.I've been doing them this way for several years and they keep for months if properly done and refrigerated (NOT frozen).Take a 1 gallon Ziplock bag and add 2 cups of pickling/canning salt and 1 cup of Borax (available at your local grocery store near the laundry soap). Now add about 1 pound of live minnows. Shake them up so that they all get coated well. Put the bag in your refrigerator for 24 hours.The next day dump the minnows out in a sink. Grab a handful at a time and rinse them under cold running water, shake all water off and put them in an ice cream bucket. When you get all done dump the bucket back in the sink and then put the minnows back in it. The idea is to get rid of any excess moisture, if you have liquid in the bucket the minnows won't last. Now put the bucket in the refrigerator until you need the minnows. Keep them cold, not frozen, and they will last for a long time."
2432962,epiepenburg,2014-02-09 06:43:00,365,"We have purchased salted minnows before, big thing is to not freeze them, just keep them cool. If you freeze them they will turn to mush."
