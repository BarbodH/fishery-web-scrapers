2433658,zeebee,2014-02-09 09:57:00,1144,As long as you walk in backwards......Keep the receipt showing where they were purchased.
2434242,adempsey,2014-02-09 12:22:00,963,"As long as you don't put them in earth/dirt while your in Canada, I don't see why that would be problem."

2435386,hogridnfool,2014-02-09 19:00:00,349,"I've been bringing leftover Nightcrawlers (packed in dirt, newspaper bedding, muck, etc.) that I purchased in Canada back into the US for decades and have never had a US border guard ask questions about it."
2440770,tv4fish,2014-02-11 12:16:00,2694,"Same here - as far as being asked about bringing crawlers INTO the U.S. -- that ? has never been asked (of us, anyway)."
2440850,Sportdog,2014-02-11 12:36:00,6735,"I brought a half a flat back two years ago and don't recall it being an issue. To be honest, I never gave it a thought and nobody in the US Customs asked about nightcrawlers. When I go up this year I will have a bunch, rinsed, and packed in shredded paper."
2443121,ftfarms,2014-02-12 06:26:00,444,I would leave them up there. We got pulled aside by US costoms so they could look at them. What a pain. Thirty times I've crossed and they never asked;one time we bring a few back and they need to see them of course they were packed away in the boat.
2443345,Fishoil,2014-02-12 07:37:00,1277,I don't take them anymore but have never been asked about any kind of bait on the way back on any of the 50 or so trips I've taken.I don't see why it should be a problem considering they probably came from Canada (packed in dirt) to the US before you purchased them.
