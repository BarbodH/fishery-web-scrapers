2457137,5 of Diamonds,2014-02-16 14:09:00,151,"Kitty. Eliminates all the BS and when the trip is over, the trip is over. No chasing down $'s. We do have 1 person buy all the food to prevent duplication (or triplicate!), reduce unnecessary weight and ultimately save everyone $'s. Everyone brings their own alcoholic beverages and whatever else they want to drink. This system works like a charm."
2460929,Fishin Fun,2014-02-17 17:41:00,218,I plan the trip and keep track of who pays for what on the trip. At the end I add it all up and split it up between the guys. People that paid for gas or other things just deduct that amount for what they owe. I usually pay for a majority of the expenses on the trip so they just pay me. It's what we've been doing for years and it seems to work well.
2460953,GFinck,2014-02-17 17:48:00,4,"Our group struggles with how to split the lodging costs with kids on our annual father/son trip. Some guys don't have any kids, some guys have three kids. We first started by saying a family unit is a family unit so a father and son is the same as just a father without a son attending. We then changed it so that the kids must be in school (college would count). Now we are thinking of changing it per person with a kid counting as a person. It's usually a week-long trip. Some guys only stay half a week but we charge them the same lodging costs as someone staying the whole week. Please help."
2461985,btyreprich,2014-02-18 04:00:00,1067,"The lodge we have been going to for 10+ years has a printed rate for kids.Basically it is half off the adult rate. This seems fair to our group.I think once the child reaches 18 years of age, they are considered to be an adult.With regards to the groceries we buy for the trip, everyone pays an equal amount regardless of age. There are days when the kids don't eat that much and the next day they eat half a cow and a gallon of milk!!"
2461993,kzoofisher,2014-02-18 04:04:00,5144,"The lodges we use have a per person price and a minimum # of adults for the cabin. The adults split the minimum and I pay for my kid(s) if there are more adults than the minimum. No matter how many people you have each adult still pays the per person price so we make that clear to newbies. We used to have a cheap guy who always wnted to save a nickle by overcrowding cabins and boats. Not any more. If there are fewer than the minimum that usually means it's just me, one friend and my brood and we divide it evenly with me paying 66%-75%. We always use his truck and boat so I don't mind a bit. We each bring our own food, snacks and drinks because my kids make Jethro Bodine look like he was on a hunger strike. I can't push that off on anybody. Truck is on full when we start, full when get back and I fill it up along with the boat and extra gas cans before we cross at the Soo. I'm really lucky that nobody left in the group counts pennies. We all know it's going to cost about $1000 per man once you include everything and we've winnowed out the guys who are desperate to keep it under $985. Really the cost of food and lodging is pretty fixed and the biggest variable is travel. We've done the math and for the area we go it's a wash between renting a boat/taking a high mileage car and just hauling the boat. If I ever make it over to the far west of ON that will change and I'll probably rent a boat."
2426618,pjshorthorn,2014-02-06 19:23:00,5654,"All the years going through Chicago on the way north, I've never had a problem with toll attendants being unfriendly. Exact change and a good aim into the basket.....never a cross word was ever said On the way home, the only cross words were when a fella would throw a Loonie into the basket. What a mess that is...."
2426706,HeHooksHimself,2014-02-06 20:06:00,725,"I am not saying I ever had a problem, but a smile and a ""thank you"" is rare."

If you can't chip in and help or find your wallet, please stay home. Never could understand a group of friends going our for a meal and one wants a separate check. This is the same guy who will let everyone else buy a round and then go buy himself one. If your that guy, you cant afford it. STAY HOME!"
2427706,MrSimon,2014-02-07 08:01:00,922,"This is exactly what we do and it works perfectly. We all hate the ""kitty"" method because it means hauling around thousands in cash and it gets confusing. Its SOOOOO much easier for one guy to just charge everything and bill everyone after the trip. We don't even keep receipts cause you can get it all on-line after the trip. If someone takes their own vehicle or boat .... they don't have to chip in for gas."
2430418,jaximus,2014-02-08 02:48:00,117,"we take my car, holds all the guys + gear + 2 canoes(one of which is mine), i chip in for gas and we charge the gas on one guys card and the park fees on another, i buy the groceries ahead of time. we have a group of 4, been going for 8 years. i end up throwing in a little extra money for some extra perks on the ride, be that snacks or dinner the night before we leave. total cost of our trip is under $150 a person, so its really not a big deal"
2430498,55walleyes,2014-02-08 05:53:00,131,"We use kitty fund for gas, tip, hotel, bait and camp incidentals, etc... Buy your own meals coming and going. Food included in fly in cost. Vehicle owner pays half of what others pay."
2449977,roscoe33,2014-02-14 00:25:00,653,"Kitty is used if its the guys. A scrap of paper is used if it all family members. We split gas, cabin, minnows, and the groceries we buy before hitting the ""gravel road"". You pay for your own booze, license, meals along the way, or anything you forgot to bring. Usually someone throws the driver 30 for an oil change. One year $200 extra appeared in the kitty, still don't know who was the generous one, but everyone agreed that we should make it a 2 day drive home, and spend the $$ on a nice hotel."

It's bad enough when I take my wife as she has taken to Kokanee Beer as her favorite.At $45.00 a case in Ear Falls, I really wish she didn't drink like me.Heck your on vacation.I don't know how many more trips I have to Canada so the money is the last thing thing I'd ever worry about.Bill"
2453458,djcoop52,2014-02-15 07:41:00,1411,We have a group that goes N WI every year I book the resort and put down the deposit we get two cabins one cabin might cost more than the other but we add rental costs together and divide by number of guys each pays same amount. We take 6 boats and six trucks two guys in each rig fills of gas are split. I pick up grocreries for the trip for the cabin I'm in I keep the reciepts and split up cost between who ever is in my cabin equally. Everyone brings snacks and own drinks also whatever you and your partner need for lunch on the boat is up to the boat partners. I always take my truck and boat and bring venison and grill supplies no charge to any body others bring items from home also. My deposit is used towards my portion of cabin rentals. My son and son-in-law come every year and I pick up there cabin rental. Resort keeps log of minnows which each boat pays there own. We spend one night in a motel on way up which two guys share room and split cost. No problems so far.
2453601,LLewellin,2014-02-15 08:42:00,1790,"We like the kitty method and have been doing for quite some time. We get a cash zippered bag from one of our local banks and that is where the kitty goes, no more messing with envelopes. Also, all kids go for free. Dad and two boys count as one until the kid is out of school weather its high school or college. Once they are done with their education they are now an adult and are expected to pay their way. Works well for us."
2423977,Glenman12,2014-02-06 08:00:00,762,we do it the same way except for the motel rooms..the two guys who room together split that cost...also on the way up the two private boats fill up in Int Falls and the owners are on their own for that though one year a newbie did get his 30some gallons of gas paid for out of the kitty..
2424057,SinOrSwim,2014-02-06 08:14:00,1528,"We have used the Kitty system for years. It's really the only way to make it fair. We all put in about 200 to 300 each. My brother buys ALL the food for the whole trip and we just pay him from the kitty. Gas, food, etc all comes out of the kitty. We always paid duty from the kitty as we take a fair amount of booze. We did start having some of the guys who don't take much booze to put in a little less into the kitty. We do not compensate for trucks. We don't take our own boats. We do borrow a trailer from a guy who doesn't go so we take money from the kitty to give to him for the ""rental"" of his trailer. ***** The BIGGEST key to this process is to put your money in and DISAPPEAR!!!!!!! NOBODY wants the kitty and that responsibility LOLI almost felt bad for the guy last year who had it. We had 14 guys so at 250 per that poor ******* was walking around with over 3 grand in an envelope. LOLMaybe if I ever turn to a life of crime I will go to I-Falls and hang around the gas stations. Every group fills up before the border and I will target the kitty keeper."
2424073,2746,2014-02-06 08:15:00,3206,"No kitty but everyone keeps receipts for what they buy for the group including groceries, gas, etc. receipts are kept in my briefcase and the last night there, after receiving the camp bill, we divide it all and settle up. One of the guys has a spread sheet on his computer. We've got three accountants so it gets interesting. Those driving don't pay for gas and those not providing a boat throw in $100 for the week. That goes to boat owners.....we fish 3 to a boat so means if you provide a boat you pick up $200. Been doing it this way for 20+ years with basically the same group."
2424569,tv4fish,2014-02-06 10:12:00,2694,"I'll bet it does............ To expand a little on what my group of 3 does -We keep a ""log"" - in a spiral bound small steno pad. The cost of the groceries, cost of bait, cost of any meals eaten ""out"", cost of any booze brought/purchased on the trip all gets entered into the log under the name of the guy that paid for it. The cost of the cabin for the 3 of us gets paid (1/3 for each) when we check out, of course. On the trip home (in the vehicle) it's pretty easy for one guy with a calculator to go through, total up those costs and determine who owes whom. We usually hit a bar before we go our separate ways - and that's when we ""settle up"".As I said - the big difference between what most of you guys do and what we do is that my 2 buddies agree to pay all gas costs since I have the tow vehicle and the boat. All concerned seem to think this a fair way to split the costs."
2424657,Gregking,2014-02-06 10:37:00,2658,"We have been using ""the kitty"" since around 84. I was still in school so dad covered mine as do I cover my daughters now. We however only use it for gas. Everyone pays for their own meals, lisence and room. Lately some of our group drives up and back separate in their car for reasons idk other than they can get 34 mpg vs my pickup getting 14. So its usually dad, my two girls and myself, I'm in for 3/4. This all started happening when diesel went up. Gets kind of irritating at times but its my boat and with at said I don't let anyone drive it now since nobody wants to pay for me to have it there."
2424793,bcmss396,2014-02-06 11:20:00,296,"We had used the Kitty for many years to cover everything on the trip and it worked well. Everybody paid an up-front amount and we would roll over the extra.Until one year at camp, when one of our boats (2 guys) used 55 dozen minnows in a week! We got our final camp bill from the resort and almost s#%t!!!!! That was the last time we handled bait that way.Otherwise, the upfront kitty worked well for us. Still use it today.Blair"
2425449,btyreprich,2014-02-06 14:37:00,1067,55 dozen minnows?? Must have been a raccoon or other animal eating the minnows at night! That is what happened to our group one year.
2425673,Nimstug,2014-02-06 15:14:00,2605,Simple ... don't use the i pass. Take it out of the vehicle. Then everyone shares in the tolls. More in tolls overall but less out of your pocket. Nimstug

2422921,wallydave,2014-02-05 18:17:00,2151,"Now that its usually me and another guy in one vehicle, one pays for gas on the way North, the other one the way home. Meals are your own expense. We have a grocery list we split for housekeeping trips. Your beer or whatever is your own too! Whatever your group does its good to have an understanding on how your group works out the details and expectations ahead of time!"
2422985,Hawker,2014-02-05 18:37:00,3967,"Been using the ""Kitty"" system for years and no problems. Almost always I end up taking my truck (no boat, we use camp boats) and start off with a full tank, fill the tank close to home and evenly split any remainder. Many times though, the guys will vote to donate the remainder of the kitty to me or whoever provided the vehicle for the use/wear & tear whatever, which works out well."
2423009,HeHooksHimself,2014-02-05 18:48:00,725,"The only problem I have had is my ""I Pass"" gets used for tolls (we have to go through Chicago). It seems like I eat about thirty extra dollars unless I can make a case to the other guys. Another problem we have is paying for gas with credit cards. Sometimes we just take turns paying for gas if we need to use the cards. We take almost everthing else out of the kitty, even meals. It all seems to even out."
2423041,mudpusher,2014-02-05 18:54:00,248,"Everyone puts in $ 250 before the trip. I put everything on a credit card, groceries, gas and meals. Pay for the camp with a check. When the credit card bill comes in, split by number of guys. No compensation for boat or trucks. Have used others truck to pull my boat but not usually. Total cost of last years trip was $ 598 each. Where can you vacation for a week for that?"
2423145,97roughneck,2014-02-05 19:31:00,899,"I usually drive since I have the newest pickup. We usually use my boat too. I don't ask for any compensation for their use since I'm glad to have the company. I put truck & boat gas, ice, bait, rooms, oil, ect on my credit card & put the receipts in my wallet. Everybody is responsible for their own meals and booze. When we get back home, we stop at my office on the way into town, while everyone is still there and before anything gets unloaded. I add up all the receipts and divide by 4. That's your share. Everybody usually pays in cash on the spot. I've never worried about it. If you're worried about it, you're fishing with the wrong guys."
2423169,NARDA 1,2014-02-05 19:37:00,636,"We took the ""kitty"" concept a little further. We opened a checking account with debit cards for the group ""NARDA"". We have a ""Chief Financial Officer"" for the group and he calculates what the trip will cost (the cost has been honed over 25 years) and each person deposits his share into the account. All expenses are paid out of this account except for meals on the road, poker money and bar tabs at the lodge. Some cash is taken out for tips etc.. the lodge is paid with a check (to avoid international fees on the debit card) and the debit cards are used for everything else. This also gets us the exact exchange rates at time of purchase. The CFO then generates a report at the end of the trip detailing how all moneys were spent. Any extra money is left in the account for the next year as it is usually the same guys. It has worked great for us for years and we also don't have to worry about carrying around a lot of cash."
2423177,pjshorthorn,2014-02-05 19:39:00,5654,"I've used the kitty system as well when traveling with a group to and from camp. Beer or liquor was up to each fella, as it should be, otherwise everything was split up evenly. The person who drove their vehicle to get us there and back would always have a free JiffyLube visit on us. If a fella had a 200 mile pull home after dropping me at the airport, I'd make sure to give them enough cash to fill up one last time. Those two things were always one of the cheapest parts of the trip for myself and just a small way to say thanks for the extra effort to swing by the airport to pick me up and drop me off. PjShorthorn"
2423201,btyreprich,2014-02-05 19:46:00,1067,"We have used the kitty approach for gas, tolls, and groceries. In our opinion, this is a fair way to share the expenses. My buddy and I take turns driving. No extra compensation as it is an every other year turn. Each person on the trip buys their own beverages. Other than that, we share evenly. Now my buddy's son comes along and boy can he eat!!! Sure he eats way more than my 12 year old, but it's not that big of a deal in the scheme of life. When you work out the details of the trip, everybody knows what to expect and budget for. This makes for a far more enjoyable vacation."
2423241,port1042,2014-02-05 19:58:00,509,"My fishing partner and I play cribbage, but instead of winning or losing, all the losses go into ""The Canada Fund"". We play for a dollar a game / nickle a peg -- double on a skunk. (I got double skunked last week and it cost me over $17.00, but that was the first time in 2 years). We pretty much play year round, probably 3 times a week and average about $35.00 a week into the kitty. ""The Canada Fund"" pays for all the travel expenses, gas, food, bait, etc., with the exception of the actual bill from the lodge, for both a spring and fall trip. Since we're being ""nickle and dimed"" all the time to contribute, it makes the actual trip really cheap!"

With all the shrimp I use and other ingredients that comes to about $70. Balances things out for me plus I sneak a few drinks out of their private booze stash!!!! Mike Kansas"

He kept track of where we spent our money over the years and it always ended up just about even for everybody.I have his collection of little notebooks on expenses over the years.Any money left in the Kitty at the end of the trip was either split up or rolled over to the next trip.This has worked great for us over the years.Bill"
