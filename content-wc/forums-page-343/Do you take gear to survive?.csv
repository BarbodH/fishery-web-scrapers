2453777,Guest,2014-02-15 10:04:00,0,"First rule of survival. Let someone know where you're going, how you're getting there, and when you expect to be back."
2455481,roscoe33,2014-02-15 23:23:00,653,"Unfortunately, vhf, especially handheld portable vhf radios are very limited in range, due to the antenna and the structure around the lake. When my b-i-law started doing pack horse hunting trips a few years ago, he rented a pair of sat phones. Last year, we did the same for our Ontario trip. We put a phone in each boat. $30-50 per phone with 40 minutes of air time included. Worth the peace of mind knowing we could reach help if a medical emergency arose."
2445873,Pikeslayer8,2014-02-12 18:53:00,1460,"My group usually consists of 8 fishermen, 4 boats. As long as we have 2 boats paired together, we consider ourselves safe. We have our boat safety kits in every boat and I do have lighters and stick matches in ziplocks and plenty of cigars. Lol The biggest issue can be when a storm blows in and we are on the other side of the lake. You guys know how it is, fish are biting like crazy and you don't want to leave but going across the lake with 4' whitecaps is not much fun. Anymore, we got a pretty quick trigger if the wind starts picking up. We will either head to safe sheltered water close to camp or just head in and regroup."
2445993,Pooch,2014-02-12 19:15:00,4619,"When my wife and I are in camp we always leave a note on the kitchen table as to where we will try to fish that day just in case we have trouble out in a remote part of the lake, at least someone will know where we might be should our boat not be back in at night.Spending the night stranded isn't the worst thing that could happen unless it was in the cold part of the year. Or someone was injured. Fly in remote outposts could be a problem if there is no care taker in camp to keep an eye on folks.We usually just carry some extra snacks, fire starter and water in our dry bag plus a little bug spray and decent rain gear ought to get even the wimpiest of us though a night or two. A little self reliance and common sense should keep all but the worst of luck at bay.If my wife and I were on a remote lake by ourselves a satellite phone might be a little reassuring.Most folks I've ran across who have had trouble admitted to having their head up their butt and got lost then ran out of fuel. Only once have I seen someone totally disabled and stranded.Pooch"
2446241,guidedfishing,2014-02-12 20:47:00,531,"Ah yes, one of our spring trips is strictly camping off the grid, a couple lakes and rivers worth of travel in. Since we are camping all the food, fire etc is part of the program and in the boat Goes without saying solid first aid kit Quality pair of side cutters (critical item) Optical saline solution for flushing out eye's if needed Kicker motor to supplement main motor 2 additional props and extra jesus nut Additional fuel line and hose clamps hose clamps for bilge and aerator lines Additional plugs to seal of hull aerator and live well intakes if needed separate electrical systems for Main motor, trolling motor, and electric motor. Rope strong enough to drag another boat with. Yeah I have all the must have survival gear but the above more times then not has prevented me from deploying into a full blown survival situation."

I got stranded once, for about 6 hours, not a lot of fun. That bag goes into the front of the boat everyday. Two guys in our group had motor problems and were paddling back to camp at dark, they told us where they were going, I would have gone looking for them, because it was a dead end bay about 3 miles long, right next to the cabin. Pick a travel plan and stick to it."
2447377,46Harley,2014-02-13 09:22:00,149,A VHF radio is a good idea. A lot of camps monitor 9 & 16.
2449929,roscoe33,2014-02-13 23:30:00,653,"Wow, just went through this thread, and the list is getting pretty long. What is in my boat for survival: lighters, 2 sterno cans 8x10' plastic tarp and para cord huge ($150) first aid kit, with supplements, aspirin, tylenol, bolt cutter, now a cable cutter also, SAM splints, mylar blanket, bug repellant, sunscreen, half roll of TP, small coffee pot with purification tablets, marine distress flag (3' x3') blaze orange about $7 reflective mirror (old music cd's) extra gloves and hat Rented sat phones last year, will do the same this year. What else is in my boat: Tools, knife, wrenches, hose clamps, boat plugs, electrical tape, spare prop, spare key, fuses. The motors have separate fuel tanks, but the hoses are interchangeable, as are the battery connections. bug repellant water led flashlights (low battery usage) rain gear A 12"" saw sounds like a good idea. I only have an 18' boat, and its full. tools are in a plastic box, first aid kit is self contained, and everything else fits in a small stuff sack. More tools and spare engine parts are back at the cabin. Here is an interesting read about giardia. It seems humans are to blame, not the beavers.http://archive.tamaracksong.org/view...20Giardia.htm& I will update with the preventive info, when I find the email in my computer. I have been exposed to giardia and cryptosporidium several times, and for some reason, while others around me were doubled over, I had little or no symptoms. I routinely drink water straight from the lake. Have for 40+ years. Be prepared as best you can. Likelihood is that no one is going to come looking for you in the dark, especially if the weather is bad or visibility is low. They are more apt to start searching at first light in the morning."

2451481,MrSimon,2014-02-14 11:35:00,922,"Someone mentioned it earlier, but a sat phone is almost a non-negotiable on fly-ins these days. Many of the outfitters offer them for pretty cheap, or free. Frankly, its almost foolish not to take one."
2451793,SinOrSwim,2014-02-14 13:14:00,1528,"Agreed. It's been a couple years since we have flown in and we took a sat phone with us but we always left it in the cabin. We didn't want it lost etc. Plus, many times if we had 4 boats fishing, we would split up. No way we would know if someone was lost or broken down until much later. If I had the time and money to go on a trip and try to survive, it might be kind of interesting. However, I am not going to take a vacation to purposely be miserable. LOL But, it would be interesting to get dropped off with basic supplies and see what happens. Granted, have someone who knew exactly where you were etc but just the challenge of it."
2443657,SinOrSwim,2014-02-12 08:22:00,1528,"The conversation in the crazy things thread was taking a turn and I didn't want to hijack, so thought I'd start a new thread. I watch the show Survivorman all the time. Really enjoy it and I have come to the realization there is a good chance I'd be dead in most of his scenarios. LOL That said, do you take gear for emergency survival? If so, what and where do you keep it? For instance, I have some stuff in my tackle box and dry bag but if our boat sinks or something happens where I got tossed in the water I wouldn't have any of that with me. I have some basic stuff. Lighter, flint, mylar blankent/tarp etc. But, nothing for like a multitool with a saw etc. Not sure how I'd make a shelter? It's also interesting I started taking most of this stuff since we started a drive in trip on Lac Seul. We went years and years on a fly-in and I took very little survival stuff. At least on Lac Seul the cabin owners would realize we were missing.Also, have you ever been in this situation and what did you do?"
2443801,camp chef,2014-02-12 09:10:00,915,"We boat into some pretty remote areas and always have a pretty substantial ""boat bag"" of survival gear. We are known by our camp owners as "" the guys who keep really good 10 year old cheddar in the boat"" so they have a reason to come search for us if we don't show up back at camp. LOL"
2444065,MrSimon,2014-02-12 10:34:00,922,"Like most of us, I have a well stocked first-aid kit in the boat at all times .... along with a couple sets of rain gear, fire starting materials, 550 cord, basic tools, electrical tape, some food, a water filter, and a few other things. But that stuff only helps if I have my boat and its in good shape. On fly-ins, we pack a small dry-bag with a lot of the same stuff mentioned above and keep it in a handy spot in the boat. I actually think that is a lot better than having things stowed away in the hatches of a larger boat .... much easier to grab if you have to ditch. On remote trips, I've also started carrying a disposable lighter and a Leatherman in my pocket at all times. As long as the weather is warm enough, it really doesn't take much to survive at a lake. But if the weather gets cold/wet, it can get real serious."
2444361,GuideBoy,2014-02-12 11:48:00,7,"Hey, some things I always have ready when on trips. 1. Garbage bags are great for keeping warm. They trap heat really well. Wear them as close to your skin as possible to get warm fast. Used to use them treeplanting and with sleeping bags in May all the time. 2. At least THREE different items to start a fire. Both matches and lighters. 3. Water purification tablets, cheap and easy. Nothing worse than beaver fever."
2444369,SinOrSwim,2014-02-12 11:53:00,1528,"I have a shot in Canada. But, watchign Survivorman if I ever got stranded in the jungle or somewhere just stick the knife in my head. I'm screwed. I would die of fear the first night with all those bugs, snakes etc crawling around me LOL"
2444441,lassh,2014-02-12 12:22:00,553,"Sorry for unintentional hijacking of the risky things post. I deleted my post there and reposted below- my post is directed at remote flying or portages to remote lakes on fly-ins. I would like to hear more info on this survival story as well. How did you keep the bugs off? Did you build a fire and roast fish in coals or did you wrassle the black bears for berries? I do keep one of those mylar ""space blankets"" with my tackle when on fly-ins. I also have a lighter (and magnesium fire starter stick) in tackle box. What I haven't done is carry water filter along and I don't have a pot or pan. I always carry rain gear regardless of current weather as experience has shown repeatedly that weather often changes with no notice in northern Ontario. I imagine you had to ration your gas and fish close to the pickup area probably anchored most of time. Getting stranded is another reason to make sure you have at least on paddle in the boat. Its much easier if you have two guys paddling but the paddles get in the way when stowed in the small fly-in boats. Does anyone carry contingency gear in case you get stranded out on an isolated lake? If so, what do you carry?- para cord, Al foil, pan, tarp, antiseptic, water container, water filter or disinfect tabs, granola bars? I know theres a trade off because you don't want extra crap in the boat and you can't take extra stuff on the plane. The probability that you'll need contingency items is low but the consequence could be high. What do some of the other seasoned vets do?"
