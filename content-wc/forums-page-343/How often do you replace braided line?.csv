2454393,Cash,2014-02-15 14:59:00,73,"I have some line on my bait cast reel that's been on there for about 5 years. Don't remember the brand. Probably something like 50 lb test @ 12 lb dia. I have never lost a fish on this line. I only use it casting for northerns. It still seems good as new. I know I should replace it, but how often?"
2454473,Jimmy Jig,2014-02-15 15:34:00,1905,"It would depend how much you use it. But, if its 50 lb. test I wouldn't worry for a LONG time. I replace 10 lb. maybe in 5-6 years. This stuff is strong....."
2454489,CI_Guy,2014-02-15 15:35:00,2118,"I run power pro for 4 years. After 2 years I peel the line off, then re-spool it backwards so I'm using the line ""new"" line that was closest to the spool before."
2454689,Cash,2014-02-15 17:20:00,73,I like it!
2454745,Obabikon,2014-02-15 17:48:00,2370,"I respool on even years (so I can remember). Using the backside of braid. So, I get 4 years out of it."
2455033,Glenman12,2014-02-15 19:45:00,762,if I recall theres an easy way to reverse it...care to share???
2455433,KurtG,2014-02-15 22:32:00,259,"Sure is, it is called a spare spool. I usually go the a football field late in the day and tie off at a goal post, walk away until spool is empty, cut off line, return to goal post and reattach line and reel it back on the reel. Also, I use a chamois soaked with line conditioner to clean and refresh line at same time."
2455473,roscoe33,2014-02-15 23:05:00,653,I stick the rod in a rod holder and transfer the line to a different rod/reel.
2455577,Gipper,2014-02-16 04:25:00,76,I once called a manufacturer on this very question regarding nylon braid 45 lb and the rep could not give me a number. The line was 5 years old at the time and he did not seem concerned. He said to inspect it. The line (on my sucker rod) is about 10 now and seems to be doing just fine. If I was casting I would have changed it. I reversed it once.The rep was more confident with longevity of the synthetic Power Pro type line. I believe re-tying a couple times a day is more important for success. After a few years it lets me know it's too short to cast as well as I like.
2455689,Obabikon,2014-02-16 05:56:00,2370,I do the same... put it on a completely different real. It's quick and easy... and no mess.
