2444465,Guest,2014-02-12 12:26:00,0,You should give sportsmens lodge a call they have what you are loking for plus xcellent trout fishing. the owner acually caught the trout for the M.N.R. to tag for their trout survey's. www.eaglelakesportsmenslodge.com
2454321,jld235,2014-02-15 14:15:00,11,"Thanks everyone for your help and suggestions. After talking with a few lodge owners, we decided to try out Cedar Lake. We will keep everyone's opinions and suggestions in mind for future trips. Special thanks to everyone for the PM's and the lodge owners that I was able to talk with. WC did not let me down with great information."
2454345,wallydave,2014-02-15 14:37:00,2151,"Good luck on your trip! One word of warning, this trip can lead to addiction! You may find yourself searching the Internet for lodges and camp in Ontario. You may check the sky looking for eagles when you get home. Enjoy your trip, cherish every moment! And let us know how it went!"
2433850,jld235,2014-02-09 10:43:00,11,"A few of us firemen from WI are looking for a new place to fish. We have been fishing the Thunder Bay area the past few years and are considering coming to the Dryden area. Our trip is usually the first or second week of June; we bring our own boats; we like to target perch and walleye; if there is a Lake Trout lake near by that is icing on the cake. We'll have 4-6 in our group. We have been looking at Eagle, the goon, dinowric, Cedar, Perrault, Lotw. If anyone has a recommendation, I'd appreciate it. PM or reply here publicly...which ever you choose. Thanks for everyone's help! Jeff"
2433874,wallydave,2014-02-09 10:47:00,2151,"You might have to settle on any open cabins. Try the search function too. Cedar looks like a place to look into, happy cabin hunting!"
2434010,Glenman12,2014-02-09 11:27:00,762,"I agree on Cedar as far as the walleye and perch go but Cedar doesn't have lake trout and I don't think Perrault does either...but since they are bringing their own boats they can do what we did a few years ago..did a day trip across 105 to Cliff and launched at the public launch on the south end of the lake..from Cedar Lake Lodges dock to the launch on Cliff was about 3 mins...and yes, we actually caught lakers.."
2434338,prov1800,2014-02-09 12:56:00,5010,"I agree with cedar.you will enjoy your time on the water there.17 miles of cedar and can get to perrault also.check out. clarkes northern lights cedar point resort cedar lake lodge these are the camps I deal with when I guide there.there are two more but have no input on them.northern lights runs a minnow business and your minnows will be free there.could be a huge saving in bait alone. lost bay resort on cliff lake, therefore is lake trout in there and would be hungry at that time of the year.large w alleyes to be had there but slower. good luck with your trip.if you need anymore info on eagle lake or lac suel message me or call ."
2435418,2746,2014-02-09 19:27:00,3206,"If it were me I'd take a look at eagle. Big but one of the most beautiful lakes I've fished. Walleye, pike, musky and trout......lots of water means the opportunity for big fish."
2435522,prov1800,2014-02-09 19:56:00,5010,"There all beautifull,"
2437066,2746,2014-02-10 11:30:00,3206,"Guess that's why they say beauty is in the eye of the beholder. For my eye I've not been on a lake any prettier than Eagle. I should add, the many islands, bays and tributaries that make it so interesting also make it a lake that's easy to get lost on. We fished it for years prior to gps equipment but I'd not want to venture out very far without one today. We've taken a number of 30 inchers from there over the years and the occasional musky (we don't fish for them on purpose) always makes our day."
2438826,Happy Camper,2014-02-10 20:52:00,22,Try Cedar Point Lodge on Eagle Lake or Bonny Bay Camp on Wabigoon Lake I know both of them are good.
2441418,tackleman,2014-02-11 14:57:00,444,"give Vermilion Bay Lodge a try. it 's on eagle lake and that has bass, walleye, northerns, muskie and lake trout all within minutes of the lodge. the owners are great people too and will make you feel more than welcome"
2441714,prov1800,2014-02-11 17:02:00,5010,"I agree eagle is beautiful, I usually get to guide on her 30-50 days a year, but have you ever been on lac suel."
