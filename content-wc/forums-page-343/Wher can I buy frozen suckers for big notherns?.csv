2447513,Perch56,2014-02-13 09:58:00,17,I know that it would be cheaper to do them myself and I did it two years ago with some success. After that I saw a post about a place where one could buy BIG frozen suckers....but I can't find the post or get it to come up on Google.I want them in the 8-10 inch range and the cost is not much of a issue......so long as it is somewhat reassonable.Any suggestions on where I can buy them would be apprreciated.Thanks

2451217,SinOrSwim,2014-02-14 10:08:00,1528,I might try this on our trip this year. We fish for walleye and have always just used the minnows the outfitter gets us but we had one guy buy his own big chubs at the border and he ultimately caught by far the most big walleye. Didn't win the biggest of the week but a ton of really nice fish.

2451273,Jig Man,2014-02-14 10:24:00,95,Rocko By chance did you buy any shinners and if so were they any good?
2451489,5richards,2014-02-14 11:36:00,131,I bought the shiners and the suckers --- needless to say I won't be making my own anymore
2452289,prov1800,2014-02-14 16:19:00,5010,"Sin.stop in at clarkes northern lights on cedar lake.they run a minnow business there.you can get the good stuff there.not the crap the camps have.3-4"" dace minnows is what you need.then you might need me to show you how to use them.lol."
2459305,rocko0305,2014-02-17 09:34:00,138,"I didn't buy any of the shiners, but someone else in our group did. For us and where we were at, they didn't produce any better than the Gulp or other soft plastics we were using. But, the suckers were worth it as good follow up bait for northerns, or as something to throw out when you need a break from casting or need to eat lunch."
