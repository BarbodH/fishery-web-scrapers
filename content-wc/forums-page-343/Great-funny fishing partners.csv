2411305,MorganMan,2014-02-02 11:12:00,341,"LOL, I was in the same truck driving up one year as this guy as he is a college friend. We stopped and gassed up the trucks. Back on the road, he says pull over at this rest area as we approached. I said "" dude, we just stopped"" and rolled on by the rest area. He started to sweat and had this look of horror on his face. I said ""what's the problem?"" He said he couldn't talk right now, he had to concentrate on not sh@*tting his pants. I apologized and laughed so hard I couldn't see. Then during the fly in trip, he sat in the boat one morning with his line in the water so everything seemed normal. He then pulled it in and there wasn't anything on it. I asked if he thought it was a northern? He said, ""No, I didn't tie anything on so I wouldn't catch anything."" He was having more bowel issues, but didn't want to draw attention to himself. I am crying I am laughing so hard right now just typing this. Good times, good times! That may have been the same lake as the bear? No wonder he was up at night!"
2431434,Pikeslayer8,2014-02-08 13:43:00,1460,"Just as in the ""Bad Pardner"" thread, with Ralph's customer John. Ralph is back being the character who is missed most other than my Dad and that is a whole nother category.Ralph and my Dad were again the original founders of the group we have today. Ralph was an Alabama born Iowan who never forgot his roots back in Alabama. He spoke with a southern drawl that was just friggin hilarious. Each phrase he uttered would have a ""Jimminy Christmas"" interspersed somewhere. All the time, he'd say something like ""Jimminy Christmas, dang ole dad gum walleye I'm a fixin to catch betta not be one of them there dad gum hamma handeles cause they aint welcome in my boat"" or """"Ah don't drink no farn liquor, specially no Rooshin vodka."" Back in the day,no one ever got to sleep in around Ralph. He was usually the first up and when he was in the kitchen, man, did he ever have a distinctive stomp. Coffee makin was the only thing he did cookin wise. A deft touch he lacked. I still don't know how you can rattle so many pots and pans just making coffee and why he would put on his dad gum goolashes to do so. Ralph's thing was doing the dishes as well as fillet man. He was a big fan of the paper plate and always made sure we had enough for the week. When washing the dishes, he was always sayin that the most important part of properly washin camp dishes is to have a good dryer.One of my favorite stories on Ralph was on a fall trip years ago (I wasn't on this particular trip) Ralph and Bill were crossing the lake with my Dad's boat following a few hundred feet behind. Ralph was running the motor and Bill was nodded off in the bow and they may have been a bit overtrained. Well, as my Dad would tell it, the boat slowly started to veer off and bam, Ralph ran the boat right on top of an island, tackle flying everywhere. Luck had it that they found the only smooth sloped little island on the lake. When my Dad pulled up, those guys were pickin themselves up outta the trees. My Dad says, ""what happened""? Well, Ralph says ""I was markin a burd but the burd flew"".Yea, Ralph was a good one. On his last trip before he died, he told my Dad that his heart doctor told him that he strongly recommended Ralph not to go on this trip. Ralph pulled my Dad aside and told him that if he were to die on this trip, to find a nice cool bay and to just store him there till the plane comes.We surely miss you Ralph! RIP"
2444753,patricktjms,2014-02-12 13:42:00,67,"I started going to Ontario LOTW in 1987 when I was 9. I went with 3 of my uncles and we always stayed for about 10 days. Well, at the time, 2 of the uncles drank a lot of beer and were tight as a snare when it came to money so they were always looking for beer on sale on the way up there. Somewhere in Wisconsin we stopped for gas and there was a sign at the station that read ""Hamms Light $2.99/Case COLD"". Well, that was too good of a deal to pass up so they bought about 10 cases of this stuff. After 10 days in camp they couldnt pay people to drink beer for them. My 3rd uncle would always reach out and tug on my line as we were trolling to make me jump up and think i had a big fish on. He always got me with that one. I will be returning to LOTW with the 3rd uncle this July after 24 years of not going. Cant wait to get back up there."

2448641,2746,2014-02-13 14:25:00,3206,"A few years back on a trip to Gullrock a black bear began visiting our front porch at night. After the first night or two one of the guys went to bed saying, ""if anyone hears that bear tonight wake me up. I want to see it."" As luck would have it I was up taking a wheez when I heard a noise. Went in and woke the group up and they all tip toed to the front door to see. What a picture! Five over weight guys in their tighty whiteys grouped tightly together peeking out the front door.....grabbed a camera and got the picture of them all from behind. Scared the bear away but we've still got the photo!By the way, that same bear drug off one of the guys tackle boxes. He thought sure it had been stolen until someone thought to go look in the woods behind the cabin."
2448681,2746,2014-02-13 14:38:00,3206,"Got to share another one. On a trip to Eagle Lake some 10+ years ago one of our guys who was a heavier drinker than any of us appreciated had one to many and then, in his shorts, laid down on the picnic table outside our cabin and fell asleep. We took a picture of him laying on his back with his beer belly stickin up but didn't tell him. That winter the wife of one of the guys had the picture made into a table place mat. We laid it out for our first meal on the next summer's trip and he didn't take it well at all.....lost his cool and took 2-3 days to simmer down. But shortly after that trip he must have decided to kick the booze because all the sudden he went dry and hasn't had a drink to this day. Changed him completely."
2451841,Aaron-IN,2014-02-14 13:23:00,500,"My brother-in-law (who likes to drink HEAVILY) always provides some great entertainment. I don't really have the time to write it all here but one that sticks out in my mind is the day he drank too much Crown. He had two or three too many and when we went out to bass fish in the evening he ended up passing out in the boat, he was laying on the back deck area of my Tracker. Every time I would catch a bass I would make an effort to bring it up and over his face dripping all the good stuff on him. An hour or so after passing out he sits up after getting a little water on his face, stands up, takes two steps forward then falls completely out of the boat. This was early June so the water was still pretty cold. I've never seen a person fall in the water and get out as fast as he did. I continued to make him suffer by not going back in but continuing to fish until I was ready to go back."
2398353,billy weaver,2014-01-29 11:25:00,470,I have been taking my grandson to Canada with me since he was six years old. He did real well that first year. I let him fish when he wanted to fish and rest when he wanted to rest. He is now 13 years old and every bit as good as anybody I have ever fished with. I get a great deal of satisfaction when he lands a big one. During these winter days I enjoy all the photos we have taken. (Take a kid fishing)
2398417,MrSimon,2014-01-29 12:13:00,922,"My cousin and my brother are my best fishing buddies! The three of us went with our grandfather on our first trip to Canada in a beat up old motor home when we were in our early teens. We have been going together ever since. We don't all make it every year, but most. We've been through everything together and know each other better than our wives do. About ten years ago we added a fourth guy who fits in perfectly. The four of us just click so well its scary. We must have hundreds if not thousands of hours logged in boats together without a single argument or disagreement. These guys are irreplaceable!"

2403505,misanthrope,2014-01-30 17:48:00,43,"A story from my brotherinlaw: A group of fine young Irishmen from clan Murphy on Chicago's south side, as well as a number of friends and assorted alcoholic hangers-on. A fishing trip in Manitoba, and a stranger on the plane to camp. So a fine young gent by the name of Terry inquires as to why this gent is alone, and the man replies that his fishing partner backed out at the last minute. So Terry inquires if the man likes to fish, and he replies in the affirmative. Terry asks if the man likes to drink, and he states he does. Terry asks if the man enjoys playing poker, and he vigorously nods his assent.Terry, that loving soul, then tells the man, ""No problem, mate, you can hang out with us."" Terry then leans in and stage whispers to the stranger, ""Is this your first all gay fishing trip?""I've been told the look on the cat's face was worth the price of the trip."

The other guy whips out his phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps, ""My friend is dead! What can I do?"" The operator says ""Calm down. I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead."" There is a silence, then a gun shot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says ""OK, now what?"""

2406665,Pooch,2014-01-31 15:11:00,4619,"Over the years we've had some guys come and go on our trips these guys were usually ""fill ins"". One guy in particular was pathetic, but his saving grace was that he was one of the best joke tellers I've ever met. What he lacked in ""work around the cabin ethic"" he made up for in funny. Told jokes all week and never repeated a single one. Dead pan funny.Another guy was just simply afraid of bears. To many late night horror movies when he was growing up I guess. One day I edged the boat up on a gravel point while he hopped out of the boat to pee. After he was just out of sight I reached down and threw a couple rocks into the bush over his head. He came flying out and into the boat in about two leaps telling me to go-go-go! Didn't even have his pants secured. Maybe you had to be there, but it was just split gut funny.Another trip a bear or some critter was rummaging around the outhouse while one of our regulars (Milt) was in there. This was during the night. He didn't give it much thought until the camp dogs got wind of the bear as he attempted to enter the camp. All of us were a little more careful making a late night trip to the privy after that. Especially poor old uncle Milt.Every trip seems to have several funny high lights and just can't remember them all. Everyone of us have been on the receiving end of a lot of jokes or misdeeds. Planned or not planned.Love fishing with my wife, but the boys trips are a totally different story. Mice in the cabin (bed), skunk under that cabin, camp dogs are always cheap entertainment if something is out of the ordinary around the camp, seeing old friends in camp the same time every year, etc.. Anytime you are spending weeks in the same cabin with a bunch of guys there is something constantly happening. Most of it devious and funny.Pooch"
2397729,SinOrSwim,2014-01-29 08:30:00,1528,"Okay, with the bad trip and bad fishing partner threads, what about those guys you have taken here and there that turned out to be really good but they didn't necessarily turn into regulars?We had a guy that went with us years and years ago. Not the outdoors type at all. Far from it. But, man did we have a couple memorable trips. First year he went he had absolutely no idea how to fish or tie a simple knot. So, I sat there and taught him how to tie a knot in the boat. He was like, sweet I got it. I watched him while he fiddled with a jig head and got all baited up. You could see the pride on his face. He casted that jig head a LONG WAY. As he flung it you could see it come off his line and his line was flapping in teh wind and there it went. Seemed like it was in slow motion and you hear it go PLOP in the water. Tied to NOTHING. LOLSame guy was told there was an Indian cabin about a mile away and the periodically came to tidy up, cut wood etc. This was a fly in. Turns out he was having nightmares about this Indian coming in and scalping him. LOL I know that isn't politically correct but he had a genuine fear of Indians. Same guy, same trip as the nightmares. Woke everyone up and said he heard something outside. Go back to sleep. Ok. Few mintues later he wakes everyone up again and said there was a bear outside. Okay okay, there is no bear. Back to sleep, could hear a pin drop when all of a sudden the metal portion of the screen door gets slammed in with a huge BANG!!!! He is the only one up and starts yelling there is a bear outside there is a bear outside. LOL We we all go out on this screened in porch and listen. Every once in awhile you could hear the faint sound of an aluminum beer can beinig crumpled. Next thing you know a big ole black bear comes out of the woods!!!!!!!!!! We yell, it runs and we all go inside. We are now sitting at the table in the center of the room having a beer and talking about the bear. Wehn all of a sudden the screen door gets slammed in again!!!!!!!! BEEEEEAAARRRRRR. I have never seen 6 grown men move that fast in my life. For some reason we all ran into one bedroom and huddled up. NO IDEA what to do. PANIC!!! The bear was only on the screened porch and couldn't get into the cabin but holy moly was that scary.Rest of the trip it iddn't matter how much you had had to drink if someone woke up at 2am and said they had to pee you would hear someone else say.......me too...........yep, me too. All of us would go outside and pee off the deck with flashlights shining into the woods. That was one of the most memorable trips I've ever had. LOL"
2397753,BreezyPoint,2014-01-29 08:37:00,1581,"Well I have to say my best fishing partner has been my wife. She has been going to Canada with me since 1979, the year we got married. This is pretty good since she grew up in Chicago and never held a rod before that. She also catches her share of big fish, including many muskies and a 25 pound (estimated) northern. There are never any surprises and every trip with her is as smooth as can be. A lot of guys scoff at the idea of bringing the wife along, but if you haven't tried it, you should, at least once."
2397873,Carnhzkr,2014-01-29 09:16:00,964,"You needed my 75 year old mom along with you to keep you safe from those big ol bears. A few years back, my mom left her purse on the steps leading into their 5th wheel camper while she went inside. She heard a noise and looked out the window to see a bear walking off with her purse. She immediately thought about her glasses and cash for the trip she had in her purse, so she bolted out the door yelling at the bear and clapping her hands. The bear decided it didn't want to tangle with a Nebraska farm woman so it dropped her purse and headed off into the woods. I wasn't along on that trip, but that story has become family lore to be handed down."
