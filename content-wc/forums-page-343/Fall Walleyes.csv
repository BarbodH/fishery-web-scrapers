2424417,J Arendt,2014-02-06 09:12:00,45,Hey MikeHead up to Gullrock end of sept
2427026,prov1800,2014-02-06 22:04:00,5010,"All our lakes have big fish mike, if you want big fish you just need to stop fishing number holes there usually not there.usually you need to target single fish.slower fishing but thats whats needed to be done.got to use the electronics, that kind of fishing is not for everyone.i see you fish lac suel and there are good fish there but hard to get them much bigger than around 27-28"", beautifull fish.we used to catch lots of 30"" walleyes 8-10 years ago, but they have been disappearing steadily.eagle has a bunch of big walleye well over 30""but they bite at night mostly and night fishing there is a no no.cedar lake truly has a lot of 30"" + walleyes if you look for them.probably my favorite lake for big walleyes is cliff lake, somewhat slower but worth it in size, no boats hardly, its like having the lake to yourself."

2428530,IaDave,2014-02-07 10:53:00,476,I would think a 2nd trip to Lost Island Lodge in Sept would be great- Basil may have headed back east by then though.
2435026,luv2fishcanada,2014-02-09 16:53:00,41,I have always gone to Gullrock in June. Where do you find most fish in Sept
2435530,2746,2014-02-09 19:56:00,3206,"I'm no expert but have concluded that big water provides the best opportunity for big walleye. I'd choose between Eagle, Lac Seul and Red Lake with no real preference for one over the other."
2437378,Esox2hart,2014-02-10 13:07:00,3,Lower pressure Deep clear water and Big fish!! Now that's if you target them. Looking for smaller pods of fish moving slow and finesse fishing for big trophy walleyes. As Pro-V said lake to yourself end of September with a shot at a huge walleye...Big Lakers are a bonus!
2438706,prov1800,2014-02-10 19:58:00,5010,"And muskies, definatly the most peacefully lake in our area.beautifull fish you caught, well worth it fishing there.spring is awesome to."
