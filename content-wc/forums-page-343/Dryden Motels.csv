2439498,Skyraptor,2014-02-11 07:25:00,291,Don't think I will have a problem when I go up in October to hunt moose on finding an open room. We did discuss staying in Dryden instead of Sioux Lookout so this thread is a good read. What about a good place to get a good dinner in Dryden?
2440426,dkrusin,2014-02-11 10:31:00,97,"Thanks for all the input. Found rooms for Friday the 30th of May at the Hide a way motel just east of Dryden. I think I got lucky and its the top rated motel in Dryden by travel advisor. Nothing fancy, but clean and reasonably priced. I also like the fact I can back my boat right up to the room."
2441778,prov1800,2014-02-11 17:24:00,5010,Good place bit expensive is the riverveiw lodge.go past the mill and hang a right at the light.another would be the patricia in.go over the overpass to the light cross the road into the parking lot.
2441938,Limeyangler,2014-02-11 18:24:00,563,"You might try this place too, not sure about parking, but a nice place by the looks of it.http://dockholidays.webs.com"
2442410,nitroman,2014-02-11 20:13:00,368,http://thunderbirdrainylake.com Stayed here last year nice place nice view good parking and just 10 min east of international falls.
2437130,dkrusin,2014-02-10 11:42:00,97,Looking for a decent place to overnight in Dryden. 3 trucks pulling boats so parking and security important. Thanks
2437170,Mike Kansas,2014-02-10 12:12:00,1463,Try Riverview Lodge
2437194,Carnhzkr,2014-02-10 12:18:00,964,"I've stayed at the Best Western. Nice and clean, as you'd expect, and kids enjoyed the pool. The info I had when I booked said there was a continental breakfast, but that wasn't true, so had to go to McDonalds. I've also stayed at the Chalet Inn, which is right where the highway turns. Definitely NOT recommended, or if you do stay there, do not use an ultraviolet light. You won't like what you see."
2437258,IaDave,2014-02-10 12:43:00,476,I think we stayed at a Holiday Inn Express a few years back. Big parking lot and right on the highway across from the A & W
2437314,btyreprich,2014-02-10 12:53:00,1067,"Our group also thought of staying in Dryden but could not find an open room on a Friday night. Now your post did not say when you'd be in town so once you have your trip dates set, I recommend calling one of these hotels right away.Seems every hotel from Virginia, MN to Kenora / Dryden fills up completely on Friday & Saturday evenings.In fact, I make our group's hotel reservation almost a year in advance.The holiday Inn does look nice from what I remember."
2437338,wallydave,2014-02-10 13:00:00,2151,"Have you tried Fort Frances? Crossing on Friday is less crowded, than Sat. I have been staying at the Rainbow Motel last couple trips, ask for the remodeled room, pretty nice. Good luck!"
2437370,btyreprich,2014-02-10 13:04:00,1067,"We basically gave up staying overnight in Fort Frances or Dryden on Friday night. International Falls for our group.Close to the border, fill up on gas before crossing the border and a good selection of restaurants to eat at.As the border is only a few blocks away, we can get an early start and not have to worry about a long delay crossing the border."
2437410,Tx Jig tyr,2014-02-10 13:14:00,140,"We have stayed at the Holiday Inn Exp. in Dryden, and been please each time. Just to the west is a restaurant/hotel that looks like you would not want to go in. The restaurant has great breakfasts, and good service. Looks can be deceiving."
2437770,Allstate48,2014-02-10 15:10:00,121,"dkrusin, sent you a PM. Thanks Doug"
