2444593,Carnhzkr,2014-02-12 12:55:00,964,"My dad and I have gone on some real adventures. Probably the most exotic of those was a lake trout trip to far northern Canada, to Yathkyed Lake / Kazan River. We couldn't have been much more remote. We flew to Winnipeg, then drove a rented car to Thompson where we overnighted. The next morning, we flew to Rankin Inlet on the Hudson Bay, then to Ferguson Lake, where the outfitter's main camp was located. It happened that the outfitter had rented his main camp out to a mining company, so the pilot for the mining company flew us in a helicopter to our outpost on the Kazan River. If I remember correctly, the outpost was an old rail car or maybe it was a semi-trailer that was made into a make-shift shelter with a couple of bunks, stove and a freezer. I think it had a dirt floor. When he dropped us off, the pilot provided a rifle because he said they had spotted barren land grizzlies in the area. Yeah, comforting. There was no communication back to the camp, and there would be no check flight. We spotted a canoe along the banks of the river, so one day we pulled the canoe downriver and portaged around a set of falls to where there was a boat cache, then pulled the canoe further down river to a longer set of rapids / fast water. This was about a mile-long stretch of fast water just before the Kazan dumped into Forde Lake. The river was about a half-mile wide at that point. There were several small islands of rock out in the middle of the river, and we decided we could paddle out to them and fish, so we took the canoe down the current and landed on one of the small islands. I was throwing 2 oz. Husky Jr. Daredevils into pools below the islands and I had my single best day of fishing ever. I probably caught about a dozen lakers in the 18  22 pound range. These fish would really scream out the line. I hated for the day to end, but we noticed dark clouds moving in from the north, so we decided it was time to start the trek back to camp. We could only go one way, downstream. So we let the strong current push us toward Forde Lake, at which point we would turn left toward the bank in the calmer lake water. However, a strong wind had come up and was blowing directly across the lake and into the current, creating really rough water where the river dumped into the lake. We hit the waves head on, then turned the canoe sideways to paddle toward shore. We've canoed a bit, but neither of us are expert paddlers. At one point, we both plunged our paddles down on the port side, just as a wave smacked our starboard broadside. In slow motion, we caught each other's panicked expression as the canoe turned on its port as far as it possibly could without dumping. We took in water, but she didn't capsize. We were probably a good 200 yards from land at that point. At that brief moment, neither of us had any doubt that we were going to capsize. To this day, I don't know how we stayed afloat. Ultimately, we managed to beach the canoe and walk back to our boat at the top of the rapids, leaving the canoe at Forde Lake. A couple months later, we talked about that experience and my dad asked what I think would have happened if the canoe had tipped. I thought about it for a second and said, I think we probably would have drowned. Kind of scares me just to think about it. It's crazy what someone will do to catch a fish!"
2440978,MrSimon,2014-02-11 13:18:00,922,"The thread about how it all started got me thinking. On my first trip to Canada my Grandfather's buddy had a small float plane docked at the camp we stayed at. On multiple occasions over the years, he would fly us back to little lakes and drop us off for the day. He had boats stashed on three or four different lakes. He would drop us off around 8AM and pick us up around 5PM. No flight plans were filed anywhere. Nobody else knew where we were. No sat phone. No GPS. etc etc. And we had next to no supplies with us. Just fishing gear and some snacks. Imagine what would have happened if he crashed on his way back .... or if nasty weather rolled in and he couldn't fly for a few days. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. But we never gave it a second thought. Looking back on it, I can't believe we did it. What are some stupid things you did in the past that worked out fine .... but could have been a disaster?"
2441010,Gregking,2014-02-11 13:34:00,2658,"I've cut gas tanks out of cars with a torch, tried to see how far I could jump my bike and my favorite running my motocross bike WFO down through the corn stubble doing a wheelie. No gear, helmet. Corn stocks fresh cut at about 2 feet. Seeing how fast the works mini van would go. Driving gravel at 100 mph. Just plain stupid stuff."

2441330,HeHooksHimself,2014-02-11 14:39:00,725,"Things we did as kids we didnt think was stupid but now society is horrified by.1. Riding in the back of pickup trucks as tykes- we added danger in the teenage years by holding ropes and jumping off. Also pulled ourselves in various cart like contraptions behind hot rods and junkers.2. Swimming in currents, rip tides and jumping off high bridges. Chicken fights in deep water.3. Growing up in Florida we battled mosquitoes. A fogger truck would pass through our neighborhood and we would ride our bikes in the poisonous fog. Who knows what ailments I am now suffering because of that.4. Water skiing fast and out of control. Also the same on the snow.5. There is a joke about people in Wisconsin. The last words of most male cheeseheads is ""Here honey, hold my beer and watch this!""6. Now that I am older, my stupidest things involve fish hooks (see my handle) and broken ribs that have resulted in my wife's only rule for me when I go to Canada- ""stay in the boat!"""
2441426,Aaron-IN,2014-02-11 14:59:00,500,"Years ago myself, father and grandfather were flown into a small lake for a day fishing trip in NW Ontario, the weather turned very bad and we didn't get picked up until day three. We had no food, sleeping bags, tents or anything. It was quite the adventure, one I don't care to repeat."
2441482,Larbo,2014-02-11 15:27:00,231,I heard a few of my dads stories from his friends and relatives. So dad always said don't get caught and your mother and I do not want to know... I've been told I have a barbwire halo floating over my head sometimes or that lucky horseshoe located someplace...

2443097,MrSimon,2014-02-12 06:20:00,922,Can we hear more about this? What did you do for those three days? How did you stay warm and dry?
2443417,Aaron-IN,2014-02-12 07:41:00,500,"When we landed on the lake it was clear, no wind kind of day. They were forecasting bad weather but it wasn't supposed to hit until that night but it ended up moving in faster. Luckily we did have matches in a tackle box so we were able to start a fire and did roast a few northern over the fire for food. It started with really bad winds then a lot of rain, I mean a lot. We ended up flipping the boat upside down and getting under it to stay out of the rain. That lasted the entire next day, then the temps changed drastically and this really heavy fog moved in, were it not for the fog they would have been able to get in and get us the afternoon of day 2. I was in high school at the time so the conditions didn't bother me much but my grandfather suffered for sure."
