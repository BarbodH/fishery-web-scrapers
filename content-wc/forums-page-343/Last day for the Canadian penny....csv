In the states you cannot wrap your own money because it's a matter of trust they say. But they use coin counters. As far as the Canadians not havuing coin counters and using their hands. I can still use mine too and they don't break down (often) and do not cost a ""cent""!! Like Lucy says everything should be 5 cents!! Get rid of the silly sales tax that almost all states have and you would not have need for a penny. The government no matter US or Canadian will get the advantage of you and round up everything to the next nicklel instaed of the next penny. Maybe melting will be allowed as it is for gold and silver one day and we can give those who think they matter a ""token"" of our appreciation! I'm going fishin'this summer in NW Ontario anyway. See ya there! Jim"

1533089,wallydave,2013-02-04 07:01:00,2151,"I heard the news about the penny on the radio driving to work this AM. I have a few in my tackle box. I always keep the Canadian money from the last trip as an excuse to take the next trip! ""Hey, I have all this Canadian money to spend next year!?"" Somehow my wife doesn't ""buy it""?!"
1533094,Slushfish,2013-02-04 07:08:00,263,That's funny. I do the same thing. Got a special cup in the cupboard that contains all our leftover cash which is the start for the next trip.

1533153,Guest,2013-02-04 09:40:00,0,"I just use a margarine container and for some reason we always come home with more change than when we left. I took the whole container(almost full) to the bank in Red Lake and I expected the teller to just pour the coins into the coin counter. No such luck, she didn't have one. So she counted it by hand. I really didn't expect to make her work so hard. I apologized, but she said it goes with the job."
1533177,Skywagon,2013-02-04 10:30:00,1106,"Same here in Dryden, can't believe the bank does not have a machine. Need to go to the bank some day and get rid of the poundage of pennies we have sitting around, or just trade pennies for jigs."
1533228,Cash,2013-02-04 12:45:00,73,I wish the US would do the same thing.
1533251,Wall-i-Lama,2013-02-04 13:28:00,1524,Never happen in the US. Makes way too much fiscal sense!
1533280,wallydave,2013-02-04 14:34:00,2151,"If the US got rid of the penny, how could we pay congress what they are trully worth?"
