1947529,dane56,2013-07-14 06:36:00,18,"Hi Bill,Met you last year at Goose Bay. Three guys from Iowa.Can't wait to get away next week. We are going to go back to Goose Bay as my son met the owners daughter and said we had to go back there! Don't know whether he will be fishing or courting on this trip. Would be interested to hear how you like Gawleys. Maybe we will also trailer down closer to Mackenzie as it is a long run from Goose Bay. I am bringing my own boat this year too.Take care and good luck fishing."
1947553,dane56,2013-07-14 06:42:00,18,"A question Bill. What is the Four Seasons? I ordered some leeches online, but the lady said she might be out by the time they ship. Really want to have some to fish with.Thanks."

1944145,btmbncr,2013-07-12 13:09:00,492,"I can hardly stand the wait.I'm putting another depth finder in my boat to use as my GPS screen.That way I can use one for the side imaging,down imaging and regular depth finder screen and one for just the GPS.I'm more proficient with the side imaging now,I'm going to use it more on Lac Seul this next trip. Got all the tackle ready,check lists ready,just need to buy groceries and pack the truck.Bill"
1944257,rommel,2013-07-12 13:31:00,369,were heading up on the 25th also. where are you staying? this is my first visit to lac seul were staying at onaway
1944705,kereid,2013-07-12 15:35:00,10,"Checking the list and getting packed! This will be our fist trip to Lac Seul, we have been going to Minaki for many years and wanted to try something new. Anyone have words of wisdom about the resort or where to start looking once we get there. Looking for a fishing hot spot map for that end of the lake but no luck, I did get a navigational map from Canada DNR that is pretty good. What part of the lake are you guys going to?"
1944801,wallydave,2013-07-12 16:32:00,2151,"Bill, I hope your trip goes well and you get some fresh blueberries to go with your fresh walleye!"
1944865,rather-be-fishin,2013-07-12 17:04:00,429,"15 days until we leave for Lac Seul on 7/27. I'm getting very excited. Tackle is all ready to go. Trying to do some organizing and packing every day, so won't have so much to do at the last minute. Were staying at Fisherman's Cove. It will be our 10th year fishing Lac Seul & it's Always the highlight of my year!!! KeReid - You can find good lake maps of the northwest section of Lac Seul at Tony's bait shop in Dryden right across from the paper mill. They are also at Four Seasons bait shop in Ear Falls. Safe travels every one and see you on the water! RBF"
1944881,WalleyeWally28,2013-07-12 17:08:00,298,"Bill, glad to see that you will be heading back to LS. We will be staying close to you at Whitewing from Aug, 3rd to the 10th. We mainly fish McKenzie and on south into the main basin. It will be my Wife, Grandson and myself in a Crestliner Sportfish with a 175 Opti and 9.9 kicker. If you see us stop by and say hello to some fellow South Dakotans.Wally"
1945449,btmbncr,2013-07-12 21:45:00,492,"We're staying at Gawley's Little Beaver lodge.Bigtimelectric told and showed me Gawley's last year. Kereid my favorite Lac Seul map is the one the Four seasons puts out.I have 3 different sets of maps for Lac Seul and I like their's the best.At this time of the year look for structure close to the deep water,50 ft plus,hint,hint,hint.WalleyeWally28 My wife and I and two dogs will be in an Alumacraft Navigator 16 ft tiller with a 75 hp Yamaha.I plan on trailering down to a public ramp closer to Mc Kenzie Bay and the main lake basin.We fished Mc Kenzie alot last year and down past Manitoba Point. We found the fishing better down that way for size and numbers. If any of you are planning on using leeches you might want to consider calling the Four Seasons and reserve some.They run out sometimes at that time of year.They did last year anyway.I reserved 3 lbs. for my wife and I.The last two times I fished Lac Seul we did really good with leeches.My wife was catching more big fish than me last year.I caught her putting two leeches on at a time.She said she had seen me do it earlier in the week.Maybe some evening the South Dakotans can say Hello.Dave On the real windy,blown out days we will be out picking blueberries for sure.Maybe with the late spring there will be some raspberries left.I'd rather give up fishing spots than good blueberry patches."
1945905,kereid,2013-07-13 08:49:00,10,Thanks for the info on where to buy the maps! We want to get on the fish ASAP and I hear lots of stories of loosing lower units so a good map is key. Thanks again! Any recommendations on a guide for that part of the lake? We may hire one for the first day to get a quick feel for the lake and what is working.
1945929,fish 4 fun,2013-07-13 08:52:00,101,"Fellow South Dakotan here, We are leaving a week from today. We stay at Fisherman's Cove. Is sounds like fishing has been very good. The numbers of big fish seems to up from the past few years. I can't wait."
1947441,WalleyeWally28,2013-07-14 05:39:00,298,Have a great trip!!! Looking forward to a report when you get back.
