We troll harnesses most of the time, may do the troll to find them then some jigging. As always, will be looking for wind swept areas to go shallow for them.With the lake cold and water high, any other suggestions?Thanks again. We leave tomorrow!!!!!!!:thumbsup :Just a little excited..."
1914450,Dorelover,2013-07-01 23:28:00,2,Gearing up for 2013 season at Gouin. Headed up July 16. Anyone out there have info on recent water level for the reservoir?
1914522,Andre (wallyandre),2013-07-02 04:29:00,2274,The water is very high at is maxmum.
1914722,Freytown,2013-07-02 06:32:00,770,"Late spring flooding along the St Lawrence forced the hydro reservoir's in the St Lawrence watershed to hold back on water releases. Like Andre said, levels are at maximum. I was at the Gouin the 1st of June and the water levels rose all week."

1915842,Dorelover,2013-07-02 11:00:00,2,Thanks for info concerning water level on Gouin. Lets us be prepared for limited beaches and definite need for hip boots to do some off shore spinnerbaits for shallow pike and hiking the dog.
