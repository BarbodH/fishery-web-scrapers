Stayed at Miles Bay camp, loaded all our provisions in 3 boats and headed out for a week of fishing and solitude on a island on LOTW. 3 father and son groups and on x-tra person. Matt and Jen have a awesome setting, great accomidations, and great fishing close by. Had just a awesome time and caught some really nice fish, best for me was 28+ and almost 9 lbs. The wed. afternoon fish fry that they put on for the whole camp is great, icing on the cake. Highly recommend staying there."
