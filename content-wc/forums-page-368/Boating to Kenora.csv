1943777,balsl6,2013-07-12 10:46:00,426,We are taking a day trip to Kenora by boat. Does anyone have any must eat at restaurants or must see things while we are there. We will be staying over night at the BestWestern and will only have a boat. Thanks

The Second Street Bakery has great Deli Sandwiches.The Farmer's Market on Wednesdays should not be missed.A new brewery/restaurant just opened across the street from the Second Street Bakery in the old fire station. I have not yet been there but it looks like a good place to check out.All of the above are within easy walking distance of your hotel.

1945017,stillangling,2013-07-12 18:37:00,149,Borellis is a reasonable spot in the summer and the view can be good it is an easy walk from the lakeside inn a couple of other good bets are the plaza and Dino's both in middle of town both are Greek I would suggest the calamari platter at the plaza they call it an appetizer but it makes a meal

Not sure what type/length your vessel is, but the slips are not that long and the boat traffic going by is non-stop and will beat the crap out of your boat continuously. There are other places really close to the hotel that are much better...."

They were not very nice about it. The traffic is awful and the docks are not very well padded for any type of protection from the waves. Bring a lot of bumpers."
