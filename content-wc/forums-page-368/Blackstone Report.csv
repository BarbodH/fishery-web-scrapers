1947585,55walleyes,2013-07-14 07:00:00,131,Fished July 7 - July 11. Quantity was average but quality above average. Lots of walleyes from 20 - 26 inches. Overall numbers were pretty average for fly-in but that still means we caught quite a few fish. Cannot really say there was a definite pattern. Found the fish in different depths and locations from day to day. Always great to spend 5 days in seclusion with nothing to worry about.
