1918530,keek,2013-07-03 06:15:00,1003,"Gull island is the rocky island (not very big but plenty of shoals just below the water line south of the island) NW of cabin 25. You can't miss it. It will have seagulls all over it. The north side drops off into 45 FOW. Start here your first day. If you can't find them then go 10' deeper and look, repeat until you hook up. When Octanehi5 gets back (he's there now) he will post a report. Enjoy!"
1931001,octanehi5,2013-07-08 14:10:00,1104,"Arrived 6/30. The week before there was a low pressure system around for 5 days, very slow bite, things started to pickup sunday night as we found, walleyes in all the usual haunts. weather was getting better but still only 60 s, 40s at night.We had a nice fish fry that afternoon. monday big cold front came through, slow morning but, sun came out and the bite improved greatly by evening,Many walleyes were caught in alot of areas.Tuesday the wind changed 180 degrees twice, suprizingly it did not effect the bite, The wind on weds. morning moved to the south west 15 to 20 mph, got stronger th next two days, If you are a walleye, we all know wind pounding a shore will produce great fishing in that area. add to that those spots being pounded by these waves, are very good with out all that wind. There production of walleyes increased by 4 times the normal for 3 straight days, any time of the day,And the evening it was off the charts. Saturday In my boat we toke the day very slowly, pike fishing with paddletails, walleye and pike were caught in nice numbers. back to camp for breakfast, after head down the the nort end o f the lake to do a little jigging on th area that has been just pounded for the 4th day,A pare of our guys were there just sleighing walleye's whole sale.we started fishing the spot,from 22'to 8' drift, we started to sleigh them wholesale.After a while the wind was to strong to drift fish even with a sock. we anchored, in 16' wind blowing 35 -40mph, It was not even fair to the walleyes. it was like fishing in a hatchery.After this we went back to the camp for our big steak dinner. 600 pm back out to the far north end of the lake,the wind had died down, the first drift we caught 8 nice walleye in the 20 to 22""range,clouding up the next drift was 15 walleye as big if not bigger. totally getting very dark from the cloud cover ,the third drift was a drift that many will only dream about, 25 walleyes on that drift. I looked at my friend Eric,And said On that note I'm done,He agreed,we headed back to camp and drank a few beer smoked a cigar and ended The best fishing trip of my lifetime. 6 guys showed up that week with 2000 night crawlers,3 lbs of leeches,gulp alive, trigger X, Fished very hard all week , The summary,for there efforts, many personal bests were made pike and numbers of walleye per man per day,After we added each day up , Walleye 2,250 biggest being 27"",Pike 50, biggest 38"". I personallyboated over 900,By far the best trip of my life. The lake Hebert report is if you have never fished it.put it on your bucket list.you will not be sorry you did. octanehi5[aka Walleye Ron ]"

1933369,octanehi5,2013-07-09 08:00:00,1104,"I have to say we hit the perfect storm, for our week, wind out of the south west or 4 days ,new moon cycle,water temps started at 59 and rose to 68,The week before had 5 days of low pressure systems all week it really put those walleye down, and the bite was very slow, Our bite Increased from sunday, got better every day, and the last day was what a walleye fisherman only dreams about. our jigs did not even hit bottom before you had a bite, with not many missed fish. Make sure you tell air Tam you spoke with me and be sure to report here or send me an e-mail [email protected] I will chat in more detail, with you about hot spots. Have a great trip Our group set the bar very high but a 1000 walleye week is not out of reach on this lake anytime."
1942985,octanehi5,2013-07-12 06:53:00,1104,"Trapper your week looks good in the long range forcast, new moon coming your week,usually the water temps are warm by this time,But not this yr,the lake will not reach its normal highs . with everything being 3 weeks behind.You are staying in one of the best locations on the lake with quick access to many fishing spots. the biggest bowl of fish is northeast of seagull island. goes to 80 feet."
