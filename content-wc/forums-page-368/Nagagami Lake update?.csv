1927722,Redear,2013-07-07 13:15:00,40,"Thanks for the report Dan. Hope we can catch some of them hogs you released,or there mama's . You ever hear of a good portage lake from Nagagami other than Moose. Fred"
1942081,buckeyedan,2013-07-11 18:02:00,44,"Fred - we have done several ""side trips"" in our years there. When we used to go to Nagagami Lodge there was a portage to Lake Hiawatha. Not sure if they still do that or not. Rumor is that the locals started fishing Hiawatha and it's not worth going to anymore, except for the adventure. At one time there was a boat and motor there, but it's been so long that I really don't know if it's still there or not. We have also been up the rapids in both the Buck and Foch rivers. One year when we were younger we walked (and waded...chest deep) to the 3rd set of rapids in the Foch. We have also carried a canoe through the woods to above the first set of rapids in the Buck river, and paddled upstream for a while. I have a friend who claims to have caught a trout in the Foch river, but nobody saw it but him, so we make sure we give him grief about it whenever he brings it up...My brother and another friend did a portage to Pody Lake one year. Said it was beautiful and the fishing was good, but they had to paddle the boat themselves. If it had been windy that day he said it would have been a struggle to move around the lake. When the water is high you can get by the big rocks at the entrance to Pody creek and play around in the little ""bay"" on the other side. Again, not much to speak of fishing wise, but a decent place to hop out of the boat and stretch your legs. We almost always see some wildlife of some kind back in there as well."
1945809,Redear,2013-07-13 08:01:00,40,Thanks Dan just what I have been told by others.Now I can sit in the boat an catch 50 to 100 fish a day an tell the young'uns to go an do all the exploring they want lol. US old guys love Nanagami!!!Fred
1874370,buckeyedan,2013-06-17 15:09:00,44,Just wondering if anyone has been on Nagagami yet this season and how things went for you? I know it's been cold...our outfitter said they lost 2 weeks to the late ice out. We fly in next Saturday and I was just looking for a little info on what we should expect. Thanks!
1874938,Mich_Fisherman,2013-06-17 17:24:00,292,"Dan, Our group spent the week at Nagagami last week as Expeditions-North last week. Water was still between 58 and 62 degrees. Surprisingly warm considering the ice was out only 2 weeks before. Fish were not as thick in their usual places but we did manage to catch our share. Definitely had to move around to find them. Caught them mainly on minnows and jigs but had success with slip bobbers, Rapala jigging raps, husky jerks and an occasional night crawler. Once again we were at Expeditions North and the accommodations and customer service and hospitality were top notch!! Thanks David. PM me if you want more info. Good luck and be safe!!"
1875114,Crede,2013-06-17 18:32:00,134,"Mich Fisherman, Where did you get your minnows? Thanks."
1875330,Mich_Fisherman,2013-06-17 19:26:00,292,The camp (Expeditions North) had them for sale. I took preserved minnows last year.....didn't catch a fish on them. I did better with Gulp.
1881481,Redear,2013-06-19 18:52:00,40,"Thanks for the report Mark sounds like you got to see more of the lake this year,but still had a good week.Only me and my son going last week of July everybody else got tired of catching to many big walleyes to go this year.Dan hope you have a great trip an post when you get back.Were staying at uncles cabins the night before this trip to rest up since we only have two drivers.Fred"
1882793,buckeyedan,2013-06-20 07:26:00,44,"It's interesting to hear about the success that others have on Nagagami with plastics and minnows. I have given both a fair shot over the years, but we always seem to do substantially better with just yellow and white jigs and nightcrawlers. Whenever my brother would go with a jig and a crawler and I would play around with something else, he would outcatch me 4-1. Fred - thanks for the well wishes and I will definitely bring an update back with me. Unfortunately, we could only swing a 4 day trip this year, so I will be back sooner than I would like to be. Such is life with a family and young children..."
1922522,buckeyedan,2013-07-04 17:05:00,44,"Returned from a 4 day stay at Nagagami last night. Stayed at Walton's Kay-Vee Lodge, and the accommodations were great as usual. Highly recommended. For me, the fishing was best on the first two days. Weather was overcast and windy, which seemed to have everything all stirred up. I caught a 28.5, a 26.5, and a 23 inch walleye the first day. After that, wasn't able to beat those sizes personally, but several members of our party were. We had a 30 incher, a couple other 29 inchers, several more over 25 inches and many many more over 20 inches. The size of the fish was beyond anything I have ever seen. I caught a 22 incher on the last day that had to be the fattest walleye I have ever seen. I swear he was just as wide as he was tall. Just amazing. Hot spots were the flats in the middle of the lake, the west side of Timberwolf point, and toward the end of the trip, the meadows. We caught a lot of nice fish there the final night. Also caught some nice ones at the reef on the north side of Twin Islands near the entrance to Pike Alley. After 3 consecutive days of sun and warm temperatures, the water temperature had increased from 60-64 degrees to 66-70 degrees. The fish seemed to be in the process of fully moving out into the lake while we were there. If we could have stayed for 3 more days, I would have spent almost all of my time in the flats and the edge of the weedbed in the meadows.We primarily used 1/4-3/8 oz. chartreuse, yellow and white jigs with crawlers, although when the weather got hot, calm, and sunny on the last 2 days some of our guys had a lot of success using minnows. Also had a guy using ""Gulp Alive"" minnows and having luck with them. As always, had a great time with a bunch of great guys. Caught several hundred walleye between us and ate fish until we were sick of it. The only downside was having to come home after 4 days, but when you have young kids at home, you have to pick and choose your battles. If anyone has any more detailed questions, please just ask or PM me if you want."
1923042,grand pa,2013-07-05 05:29:00,5,"great to read fishing report on nagagami. this will be our first trip on the lake and will be staying at pullen's camp with my 11 year old grandson, our trip will start sunday july 14. would you please let me know how bad the black fly was."
1923810,cabin6,2013-07-05 11:03:00,47,"You will have a great time there- they make you feel like family. I'll be there Aug 16 (no bugs, less people) for my 15th trip to Nagagami Lodge. The shoreline areas on each side of the bay as it widens to the large part of the lake are usually good for walleye when the wind is blowing into shore. The banana reef is always a spot to try expecially when windy. If the water gets flat, use bobbers to float jigs & crawlers over the reefs. The reef north of twin islands is a favorite of mine in late summer. Have a great time and tell Harold I said hello."
1924842,grand pa,2013-07-06 05:56:00,5,"Cabin 6 - Thank you for the info, I will for sure say hi to Harold for you. Hope to give a good report when we return. One thing is for sure, the kids can't wait they have been counting the days from the time we booked the trip in Feb. Don't know what they may do if they catch walleyes in the 25 - 28in. To be honest I don't know what I will do But it will be fun regardless."
