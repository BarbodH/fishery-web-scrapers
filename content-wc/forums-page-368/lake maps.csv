1942409,quintessential,2013-07-11 20:25:00,3,Navionics makes a great Canada/US lakes map app for iPhone or Android. Its basically all I use and it's always up to date using official maps.Cost is about $15.00
1943401,LOW1,2013-07-12 09:12:00,2828,"Try Federal Publicationshttp://www.fedpubs.com/maps.htmAnd this is a really good map store that I have used, but I do not know how much Quebec inventory they carry. If you call them I bet they could send you in the right direction if they do not have what you want.http://www.maptown.com/And here is a link to the Canadian Hydrographic Service, which is the Canadian Government Agency which prepares the government-issued nautical charts. I am not sure what Quebec charts they have prepared.http://www.charts.gc.ca/index-eng.aspPerhaps there are also local map publishers which local large sporting goods stores/marinas/nautical stores could refer you to?"

If you are looking for digital to use with a HH GPS I am using trakmaps or if its for a FF I have navionics. If there is a particular lake or area that you are looking at I can send you some screenshots from the navionics chip to see."
1945289,mr limit,2013-07-12 20:44:00,17,I am looking for a paper chart on Lac Pountricourt in Quebec.I also have a hummingbird 595c fishfinder and gps combo that takes navionics chips.Thank you for your taking the time to help me out.
1945337,rnnonmt,2013-07-12 20:59:00,992,The navionics chip I have does have that lake however it is not surveyed. It's just the outline of the lake. Nothing else.
