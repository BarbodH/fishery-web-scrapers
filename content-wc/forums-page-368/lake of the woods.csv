A houseboat trip on Lake of the Woods or Lac Seul is much different than a houseboat trip on Lake Cumberland in Kentucky for example. The pictures of houseboats I've seen up north do not look to be the nicest in the world. Granted, it's a fishing cabin and plenty nice for that use but might not meet the women's expectations."

We had to go find a tie up spot from a marked map and it was ""first come - first serve"". Spent the better part of first day looking for a parking spot. And have you driven one? Rocks are everywhere on LOTW.They had no knowledge of where or how to fish the large lake and kept pushing hired guides, which we should have hired. The screens had holes in them so 'skeeters were inside the cabin the whole week. And you had to run the noisy generator all night for the inside lights, etc. Lastly, we felt claustrophobic inside, especially the john. And it was expensive to rent drag boats on top of the house. Granted, it was RL but I much prefer a cabin rental from a reputable lodge."
