They added a week to accommodate everyone and added a day for the inconvenience so we flew out of Winnipeg on 7/1 and back in on 7/7. The weather was great all week no rain highs in the 70's low's in the 50's. WE did not hit the fishing as hard as a guy should when in this remote area we only fished 6 to 8 hrs a day. Day number 1, 4 of us My Dad, Wife Son and myself caught 175 walleyes ranging from 2 to 5lbs. The next 2 days were the same action all you wanted when you wanted. Then not sure what changed if they started moving out deeper or I do know there was some kind of larva hatch that happened due to all the empty shells that could be seen in the weed lines. Even though it wasn't nonstop action the rest of the trip consisted of 50 to 80 walleye per boat. We fished pike for a little each day but never connected with the big one while trying for them. We did catch a 40 several 38 and several 36 while walleye fishing. The outpost was very nice it consisted of 2- 4 man sleep cabins, 1 kitchen cabin and 1 shower house. Food provided was all of good quality and plenty of it, they even had a deep freeze full of bagged ice for taking in coolers out on the boat. This was my second trip with Big Sand Lake and would recommend it to anyone they were very friendly, helpful and the accommodations and equipment were in good order."
