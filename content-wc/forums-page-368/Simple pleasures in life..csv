He will fish for about 5 minutes usually then he's done....lol....lucky for me he just loves being in the boat. Last night i find out he is not only excellent company but an accomplished net man too!VIDEO LINK (change setting to HD in Youtube)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPizNjzIrFQhttp://i263.photobucket.com/albums/i...l/IMG_5516.jpghttp://i263.photobucket.com/albums/i...l/IMG_5517.jpghttp://i263.photobucket.com/albums/i...l/IMG_5518.jpg"
