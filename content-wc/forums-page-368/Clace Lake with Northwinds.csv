1932153,Silverwiskers,2013-07-08 19:10:00,5,Has anyone fished Clace Lake through Northwinds out of Vermilion Bay lately ? It has been several years since we have been there. Heard that the cabin has been updated . Thinking about going back. Any updates would be appreciated .
1935881,MikeinMN,2013-07-09 18:16:00,190,I fished Clace Lake with Northwinds quite some time ago also. Clace was a great fishing lake then and the cabin was appropriate for the times. I have heard the cabin on Clace has been updated but I have not been there since the year after Rod passed away. Rod was a very big reason we stayed with Northwinds and we still miss his hospitality. I will continue to watch your thread as I have some great memories from that lake and have often thought of returning.

That would be our entertainment after supper, reading all those (lies )stories. Just wanting to hear from anyone who has been there in the last year or so.I know Gale could tell me what she has been told, but want to hear from one who has fished it."
