1948265,wallydave,2013-07-14 12:27:00,2151,I'm going to Black Bear Lodge on Red Lake in a few weeks its on the west end of Red Lake. Bow Narrows also on the west end mentions dead bait fishing for pike on their blog. Anybody have some tips on this method? Thanks!

1949097,5richards,2013-07-14 19:19:00,131,Surprisingly enough there are fisherman[to each their own] who look askance at the use of dead bait. It is a very effective method when used properly and will at times out fish other methods. The key is always to limit the impact to the targeted fish and to effectuate a release asap. I didn't wish to stimulate a pro or con discussion on this topic -- merely to share information.

Discovered their efficacy one day after running out of live minnows, have stuck with them since. Now, the ""beyond dead"" minnows are a different story. The ones that make an audible ""pop"" when you put a hook in them and ooze some ghastly fluid...not so good. The recently deceased work as well, possibly better, than the lively ones in our application...Just our experience, and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future success. Your results may vary.-42"
