I am wondering if the resorts out on the islands have stores that sell ice and small items like the stores do on the mainland? I hate to run back to morson every couple days for ice when I will most likely be running up and fishing the miles bay area daily. Thanks for all the posts by the way my group has been fishing Lac Seul for the last 10 years and we are going to give LOW a try little closer to home and sounds like very good fishing!!!"

Mylie's Place, Duck Bay Lodge, and Buena Vista Resort have ice machines so would guess you could get ice at the three facilities. You should e-mail Black Island Resort ( [email protected] ) Obabikon Bay Resort ( [email protected] )Rex Tolten's Miles Bay Camp ( [email protected] ) Grassy Narrows Lodge ( [email protected] I am pretty sure that Gills Marina (in Hanson's Bay) has ice also. I would guess that since you are going to fish Miles Bay as much as possible, these resorts would be near the area you will be staying and all would be much better than going to Morson. The resorts listed are between Hansons Bay and the north shore of Miles Bay except Duck Bay which is a little further east on Hay Island. Mylies Place Resort has a very good supply of grocery goods."
1932321,BB3,2013-07-08 19:44:00,48,"Even though it would be out of your way, Mylies Place DOES have ice. I just bought a few bags there this weekend."
1933233,Shorelunch,2013-07-09 07:34:00,554,Obabikon Resort is near the south end of Miles Bay and is much closer than Mylies and BV. (807) 488-5815.
1935713,fishanytime,2013-07-09 17:32:00,63,I freeze water in half gallon jugs for ice needed for coolers during the day. I exchange them every day between the cooler and the freezer. Cuts back on the amount of ice needed for a trip.
1935785,Obabikon,2013-07-09 17:43:00,2370,"There's a lot of directions you can head out of Morson, and the Aulneau is huge. If you're close to us, we do sell ice. I usually charge $5 if you bring a big cooler with you."
1936561,aggie kolisnik,2013-07-10 04:42:00,39,We have ice machines in the cabins and provide the big bottled jugs from kenora for the guests.
1942449,Guest,2013-07-11 20:40:00,0,Matt and Jenn at Rex Toltens are great camp owners and also have an ice machine and sell ice. They are on an island in the NW portion of Miles Bay. No doubt they would sell you ice. Best camp owners I know of. I'll be there the week of 7/20. Good luck.
