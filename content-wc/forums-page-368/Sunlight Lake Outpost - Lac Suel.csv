The inlet to the lake is just south of McKenzie Bay and north of Windigo Point. I've fished out of Goose Bay a couple of times, but only ventured to McKenzie once. I'd really like to hook up with someone familiar with the area that could help us get on the fish that time of year. I'd appreciate it of anyone familiar with that area would shoot me a PM or send me an email. Thanks."

We caught fish around that island but never did anything great. Hard to get in and out of main lake, that is for sure. They told us between the island and a beach area there is supposed to be a big ""hole"" that is very deep and the fish in the fall hang out there. We never did find that. All we found was flat."

It was unsually HOT, like shorts and t-shirt hot for that time of year. Also, I recall it was very calm water with little chop. It was a long way for us that day and quite a tricky navigation through the river. Good luck and give a report when you return."
