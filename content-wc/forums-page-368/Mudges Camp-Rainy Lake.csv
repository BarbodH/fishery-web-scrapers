You launched in Mine Centre and went thru Bad Vermillion to a river system which were in the upper system..you would then portage down and come to the resort..great food served family style as I remember..the people running it were French Canadians..the old man was Johnny, along with his daughter Brenda who ran the dining room and the son in law Dennis who ran the docks..it was such a long time ago but I hear it is still up and running..anyone been there?"

They didn't offer to put me on a waiting list or contact me if anything opened up. I heard that the spring fishing can be really good. Also heard that their boats and motors are about the oldest in the industry but are very well maintained. I would be interested to hear from others that have stayed there. Also don't bother looking for a web site...there isn't anything that I could find."

There is a small water fall that runs through the camp and dennis diverted the water into a small gen house that had a water wheel hooked up to a generator, the used the water to make power from a 10kw gen unit to power the camp.Dennis runs the camp, but as you remember doesn't really talk much at all, (really quiet guy)I was on rainy about 5 years ago and stopped at the camp in July. All the camp boats were flipped over in the grass and everything looked shut down. They had all the 1950/60's motors on racks in the motor house and the only person around was Dennis. I told him that I used to go there as a kid and I just stopped by to look around. He let us walk around the property and everything look just like it had in 1987, nothing had change, kind of like you were going back in time. They still had the water powered gen., the one cabin on stilts in the pond by the bridge over to the lodge was still there (don't know how it has lasted this long)Not sure why they said they were full and were not taking new guests? As I mentioned we were there 5 years ago in July and it was totally closed up?We did have some great trips there, but it doesn't look like any new people are going to experience it."

The Bouchard family ran it back then. John and his wife. The daughter and her husband were also involved. We always had a cabin that sat on stilts in the upper lake (Bad Vermillion, I think). The lower lake was actually the Seine River from what I knew. There was an old fishing guide named Jack; a native indigenous person and to us from the USA a Native American. He used to get drunk on Saturday nights and sit on an old cabin cruiser type boat on the upper and drink his whiskey. I have not talked with any of the people I knew who used to travel there for many years. A lot of people from the Mesabi Iron Range fished out of that resort which was about 35 miles NE of International Falls. If anyone has any knowledge of whether or not the place is still open, please post on here or e-mail me at [email protected] and let me know please."

Mudges use the dock at Mine Centre resort to take guests and supplies out to their camp, never see more than 2or 3 people going or coming. Must still be in business, not sure if they are open all season. If you want info on Mudges, try contacting Fred Dennis, Mine Centre Resort they are the closes neighbor. Hope this helps"
1945737,papaw1964,2013-07-13 07:38:00,1,A group of very special freinds have been dragging me up to Mudges for about 7 or 8 years now and I look forward to that trip every fall.And I'm sure that the place is just as it's been for 60 years.
