You come up from Kabetogama, Ash River or Crane Lake you must go through Namakan Lake to get to Kettle Falls. If you fish the USA side of rainy you will not find any resorts until you go a long way west about 30 miles & Stokes bay is the only place but without a RABCP you must stay on the USA side. A guide is a must & should put you on lots of fishing action. This area sees very little fishing pressure but Kabetogama is loaded with resorts, cabins & homes it has extremely heavy fishing pressure, Ash River is also packed with resorts,cabins & homes this adds to the fishing pressure & boat traffic on Kabetogama. Namakan has moderate fishing pressure on USA side little on Canada side. Fishing wise Kabetogama is good if you are good at fishing, Namakan is very good if you are a good at fishing. Rainy I have yet to fish but watched to little kids with Micky mouse fishing equipment catch 2lb bass one after another on the pier at kettle falls & talked with people who stayed at Stokes Bay & raved about the fishing but didn't like the fact of only being able to keep one Walleye. Also those that fish Namakan on the Canada side state the fishing is awesome but also complain about being able to keep one Walleye. Great fishing but only allow you one Walleye seams to be what everyone says on the Canada side in these areas."

1943153,dutchboy,2013-07-12 07:54:00,5717,"I will clarify that what Kevin is saying, the Kettle Falls Hotel is ""boat in only."" That's the only way to get there. You can travel up through Rainy or as Kevin said from Kabatogama into Namakin or the Ash River Trail. There is a mechanical boat portage to get you across the dam. I think the cost is $35 and they can handle any size boat you show up with.There are at least a dozen resorts to choose from on Kab. & the Ash River Trail. Also there are 6 licensed guides I think. Being a border water a coast guard six pack license is required to guide. Don't be in the boat that gets caught without one!Hope you have a great time!"
1932849,Guest,2013-07-09 05:30:00,0,Our group is tired of all the hassles of the border crossing and long drives from Chicago to Canada;interested if anyone has fished camps on rainy lake Minnesota ust south of border;from my research 6-7 camps in area lost land resort looks interesting;appreciate any report on camps and fishing experiences probably not as good as Canada but plan on going prime time for walleyes last of may next year james wolf Chicago boys
1933225,camp chef,2013-07-09 07:33:00,915,We fished Rainy this last spring from the Canadian side(boated in). Fishing was very good. We have also stayed for many years on the way into Canada at the Thunderbird Lodge on Rainy just outside International Falls. This is a very nice place with great service and food as well as a beautiful cocktail lounge and deck overlooking the lake.

1933553,camp chef,2013-07-09 08:34:00,915,This is where we fished this spring. Very interesting. It is actually in Canada.Search threads for my report after we returned.
1933817,Guest,2013-07-09 09:21:00,0,"I fished the US side of rainy in July a few years ago. We took a guide the first day and he got my friends about 20 or so walleye. Then we spent all week fishing these spots and it was pretty tough fishing. I would get up at 4 AM and get minnows and boat ready and be out on the spots by first light. We caught some slot fish we threw back that were suspended 20 feet down in 60-80 feet of water. Also caught small sauger and walleye scattered on the spots we had. Maybe we got 50 walleye all week aside from what the guide caught us. It was tough fishing for us. looked like some guys did better fishing mid lake humps by jigging all sides of them. That was pretty much the only game in town. Maybe you can fish with guides more than we did, but no one was catching that many and everything over 18"" was thrown back."
1936569,Guest,2013-07-10 04:54:00,0,I appreciate the help on rainy lake fishing lodges on the Minnesota side and will check them out;fishing woman river camp September 14-21 but this year staying at the outpost camp 20 miles north of main camp to fish narrow portage lake (12 miles long);our 3 hour experience there last year was excellent on walleyes size and quantity;will issue trip report upon returning and the fisherman going to black bear lodge in august please issue a report thanks jim wolf Chicago boys
1938065,Guest,2013-07-10 13:05:00,0,camp chef could you comment on stokes bay camp fishing experience this spring;did all the applicances work stove refrigator etc was fishing good for example did you normally catch 20 walleyes/man/day any size also how was northern and smallmouth fishing;did you do most of your fishing within 5 miles of the outpost;and did you use your own boat and follow them in or use the outpost boats;did the cell phone and marine phone work and was the boat and motor decent;finally were the owners helpful and dependable thank you jim wolf Chicago boys would you go again???
1938265,camp chef,2013-07-10 13:43:00,915,"Most importantly,Yes we are going back again. The rest is a little tricky, but here goes. We asked if we could come in a day earlier if there was room and we were allowed to do so. We chose to go in on our own rather that incur a $150 fee for a guide in. We are adept at navigation and had no real problems finding our way in. With the late spring the camp was still in the process of getting up and ready for guests and as such the first night we stayed in a cabin that wasn't quite ready. Ie. no fridge etc. HOWEVER. this was our doing by coming a day early. We moved into a very nice cabin the next day. The camp shower was functional and the outhouse was a decent outhouse. The people were super accomodating and while we were there a new partner joined the ownership,so I have no doubts that the camp will continue to improve. Fishing was great for Walleyes but we did get lucky with such a late spring. We found Females coming off the spwn and for four days cought hundreds of 22 to 27 in fish. We are purely catch and release so this was great. After the spawners came back down the river, We searched for a while but finally found Walleyes in another current area and hammered them again for the rest of our trip. We searched for Northerns,without success but again I think the late spring had an effect on them as well. We did find alot of cool structure for future trips.Places that will hold fish later in the year.There is good fishing close to camp, but we always try to fish new spots everyday so we traveled quite a bit. We had our own boat,but the camp boats looked good and they were bringing in new motors the day we left.As they state on the website this is not a resort. It is an old time remote fish camp. Which is just what we were looking for. Nice people, nice place, nice water.....probably not for everybody. If you decide to contact Dan at Stokes Bay, be sure to tell him Aged Cheddar and Sardines says hello."
1939905,Guest,2013-07-11 05:12:00,0,"camp chef (what is your first name) thanks again for all your help sounds like a place we will fish next year the last week of may;fished wine camp this year but came the after spawn and walleye fishing was difficult I had the personal best of 25"";another fisherman reported a camp 10 miles south of us that it was the most difficult time for walleye fishing in 20 years is it true that after spawn they shut down from 4-12 days scattering and going deeper as they are not feeding this is what the owners told us and upon further reading it sounds pausible finally what week did you actually fish at outpost?? thanks again for all your help and we will issue a report from woman river outpost camp for mid September;debbie the owners wife caught a 43"" northern her personal best last week and posted on wrc website jim wolf Chicago boys"

If you stay at Thunderbird and want to go back, make sure you make a reservation immediately. Reservations are first come-first served and you can lose your next year's reservation before you are able to check out. We lost our annual reservation by having someone reserve our cabin before we could pay our bill."
