1944185,btmbncr,2013-07-12 13:15:00,492,I'm retired now and so is my wife.I've been kicking around pulling the travel trailer up and spending the summer on Lac Seul next year.My parents did it for a few years on Lake of the Woods when they retired. I was just wondering if anyone on this forum did that.Bill

If you don't like it you can always go back to the States. The only issue I could see is if one needed regular medical care. And that risk could be limited by staying reasonably close to one of the several decent hospitals in the area."
