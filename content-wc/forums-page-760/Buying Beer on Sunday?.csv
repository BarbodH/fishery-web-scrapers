What about the duty free store in International Falls? If you buy Blue, is the same as the beer I buy north of the border? Thanks, Fritz"
548064,Guest,2005-05-18 07:00:00,0,The beer Stores are open on Sunday in Ontario.
548065,Guest,2005-05-18 07:06:00,0,Actually you might want to call ahead and check......I think it might depend on the municipality you are in....they also might have restricted hours for sales on Sunday. I'm sure I bought beer on Sunday last year though.
