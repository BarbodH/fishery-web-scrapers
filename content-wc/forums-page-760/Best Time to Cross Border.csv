548132,Trailerguy,2005-05-19 15:45:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]The best time is always in the wee hours of the morning, less trafic. The worst time is 8-5 M-F when the full 1st shift is looking for somebody to shake down."
548140,Andre M,2005-05-19 20:21:00,86,Best time is when all customs officer are sleeping!
548155,MoWalleyeguy,2005-05-20 09:28:00,409,"We normally cross at 7:00am and its wide open then. Never a wait! When we come back through its normally 9am a week later, and there is a pretty good line coming back at that hour."
