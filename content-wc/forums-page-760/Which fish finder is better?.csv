548147,Guest,2005-05-20 06:39:00,0,I would like to get some opinions too. TTT
548160,Guest,2005-05-20 10:28:00,0,"I have the hummingbird to take with in the jon boat for small water and river trips. It's a basic machine, but it does have temp, which can be critical. I would have no problem recommending it."
548161,wooglin,2005-05-20 10:32:00,371,"Would you recommend it for a 14 footer with 25HP that maybe goes 18mph at max? How about for Lac Seul, I need to pick something up prior to our trip next month. Lastly, does it show fish accurately? Thanks!"
548179,IA  DAN,2005-05-20 18:31:00,53,"If your going to Lac Seul all you need to know is your depth,the fish will jump into your boat. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."

The 480 is a little bit more expensive than the models you listed, but the 320 or 240 are probably in that range. A person I know with the hummingbird (think it is same model) really likes his."
548204,Guest,2005-05-21 18:44:00,0,I like Eagle portables much better than Humminbird as well.
548207,wooglin,2005-05-21 19:41:00,371,"Thanks fellas! I bought one yesterday, its the portable Eagle Cuda 128. I know its like a baby perch on the food chain (not much), but it shows depth, fish and temp....so, that is all I need. I don't fish more than maybe 10 times a year (excluding my Canada, eh, trip) so this will suffice. Thanks again ya'll."
