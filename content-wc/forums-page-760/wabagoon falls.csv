548055,nitroman,2005-05-17 21:07:00,368,Has anyone driven past the Wabagoon Falls north of Vermillion Bay lately and if so are they way up like last spring ? We usually stop there and catch a few northern before going to our camp but last year it was so high we could not fish it. 16 days and a wake up and the excitement is almost unbearable. Does the excitement ever fade away as the years pass? I hope not.... Good luck to all those fishing the opener and leave some fish for the rest of us....
