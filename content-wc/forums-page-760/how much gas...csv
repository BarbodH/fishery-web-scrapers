548103,gus,2005-05-19 08:27:00,17,are you allowed to take into Canada? I have four 6 gal tnaks can I fill them before I cross?
548104,wooglin,2005-05-19 08:31:00,371,"Not sure of a limit, but we crossed last year with 5 6-gallon tanks with no issues."
548106,Guest,2005-05-19 08:35:00,0,"As far as I know, you can bring as much as you are going to use for the time you are up there. We were asked about 5 years ago how much gas we had in the boat and we had about 15 gallons in red containers, we told customs that and they didn't go any farther than that. We stopped doing that now, we fill up the boat tank and then buy what we need at camp. It just wasn't worth hauling all this extra gas around plus just the safety factor of having gas all this extra gas and gas fumes in the boat."
548121,Guest,2005-05-19 11:53:00,0,Declare all the gas that is not in your built-in boat tank if you are asked about gasoline. They may or may not make you pay duty. If your have to pay duty it will still be quite a bit less than gas purchased in Canada and a whole lot cheaper than any gas purchased at a resort. Some resorts restrict you from bringing any gas to their resort except for the built-in tank in your boat. Check the resort literature or web-site for any restrictions.
548149,stumcfar,2005-05-20 07:23:00,451,"A few years back, we brought two six gallon tanks full. We had to pay duty on one and were given a pretty good lecture, as we were told only one tank per motor. I think it depends on the mood of the border agent that is on duty."
548151,czy42strokes,2005-05-20 08:35:00,419,I have never been asked how much extra fuel I am bringing in. I have been going to canada for 30 plus years. I always bring in 3 six gallon containers plus a generator full of fuel.
548152,wooglin,2005-05-20 08:45:00,371,"Ditto. Does anyone know if there is a regulation regarding how much gas can cross the border before they tax it, if there even is a rule?"
548176,Guest,2005-05-20 16:22:00,0,"Why haul any gas up there??? The stuff you get there is way better than we can get here, at least in South East Wisconsin! I pull empty, less chance of fire less weigh too, besides your not saving much with it as high as it is here anyway."
548183,Guest,2005-05-20 20:58:00,0,"Border mountie told me what is allowable is what will fit into the fixed/built-in gas tanks in both boat and truck. Anything other than that is subject to duty tax. 1-2 gas cans for a non built-in gas tank is a reasonable amount. They don't like it when I reply the boat holds 60 gallons and the truck 30 gallons and then top it off with another 30 gallons in ""jerry cans"". the extra duty usually amounts to about $12-15 can"
548185,Eyesore,2005-05-21 04:14:00,455,"Last fall I took 2 30 gallon drums across. In addition to having all the built in tanks full to the cap. The drums were inside my truck camper and thus not conspicuous. They never asked about extra gas. However, 6 years ago they asked if I had any extra boat gas. I did have one extra 5 gallon gas tank, but I answered ""no"". The extra gas was for my truck...grin I would take all the gas you need for the entire duration of your stay in Canada. If ya gotta pay duty, then so be it. Sorry to sound like a tightwad, but gas is THE MAJOR cost in alot of these once per year trips. Just cause we visit Canada dosent mean we are loaded. Some of us work a bunch of overtime to squeek out these trips. The gas bill, anyway... Good luck"
