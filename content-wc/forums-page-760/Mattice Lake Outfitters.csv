547744,jigman 2003,2005-05-10 11:05:00,981,"Yep, that is where we always stop. We don't need the crawlers though, plain twister tails, power bait tails, gulp tails/crawlers is all you really need."

547964,Wisconeye,2005-05-15 10:15:00,79,Jigman: Sent you message with a link to a map I've marked up and scanned of the area around camp. I'll scan and mark-up the moose crossing area later.
547973,jigman 2003,2005-05-15 18:29:00,981,"Very nice map, you put some work into it! Thanks again, and I will give you a report when we get back. If you can email the Moose Crossing map, I'd appreciate it. What can you tell me about the camp? I have stayed with MLO for a number of years now so I know the accomodations and service will be excellent. Always looking for ""tips"" on items to bring or that you wish you had while there. Good fishing to you. Are you going with MLO this year?"
548091,Wisconeye,2005-05-18 17:17:00,79,"We are going back to MLO and Ogoki again this year. June 18th through the 25th. This will be my fifth time there. The camp is great but the bugs....well they have some. Facilities are outdoors and if you need to make a visit at dusk or dawn hang on to your .... After the first year we took two of those large Dairy Aerosol Fly spray cans. It was standard fare on the trips to the outhouse, open the door spray some in, wait for the mosquitoes to die and then do your business. We are consistently short on drinking water but MLO has it there or will fly in your own. Check with them on some of your supplies rather than lug your own...we found them very reasonable. Walleyes in this water are better than average size with 3-4 lb average, and many numbers. I can't emphasize enough to take plenty of 3/8 and 1/2 jigs as the fish are in the wood...it's all wood...and snags are inevitable. Good vertical jigging technique, fireline and light wire jig hooks will limit your losses. Northerns are also plentiful and some big ones lurk there and enjoy spoons. The ol' Johnson Silver Minnow 3/4 oz and 1 1/8 oz in plain silver, weedless will yield all the northerns you want, and some are large. Interestingly enough there are not a lot of hammer handles, but a lot of 24-30 inch northerns. Last year yielded one 45"" 20 lb. The spots I've marked on the map are mostly sure fire, but I do believe you can stop about anywhere and catch fish. Minnows have always been a favorite for these fish, leeches not so much. In fact, a piece of nightcrawler on a jig has consistently outperformed leeches here. I'm almost exclusively artificial and use jig and twister tails in various colors but my son probably outfished me 1.5 to 1 by using minnows....he claims it had something to do with skill, but then he's a teenager. I also take along about 50' piece of rope for the boat. I find many times I need a bit of rope to tie up the boat to the stumps. Last year I took a 6' piece of chain with hooks on the end. Wrapped the chain around the stump, sometimes submerged a foot or two and tied the rope to that. The chain seemed to dig into wood and hold better. I'll get the other one marked up and get it out perhaps this weekend. You'll love the place and as you know you can have a lot of faith in the outfitter."
547623,jigman 2003,2005-05-06 07:00:00,981,"Who is going with MLO this year, when are you going, and which lake are you going to? I am going to Ogoki Reservoir the week of June 25 to July 2."
547627,stukaboy,2005-05-06 07:32:00,14,"I'm going to Bellsmith Lake Jul 2 -Jul 9. I've been to Ogoki (2002) once and Whitewater once (2003). Missed Canada in 2004, so I'm eager to get back. Have you ever been to Ogoki? If not, let me know if you have any questions."
547629,stukaboy,2005-05-06 07:34:00,14,Maybe I'll see you at the dock. You'll be flying back to the base and I'll be flying out on Jul 2!
547641,jigman 2003,2005-05-06 10:54:00,981,"No, I haven't fished Ogoki before. Been at Pringle the last 4 years and Vick one year before that. What can you tell me about Ogoki? Lots of wood in the water is what I have heard. What kind of pattern can I expect the 'eyes to be in at that time? In the wood, on reefs, at the falls, etc.?"
547656,Guest,2005-05-06 17:13:00,0,"Hey Jig, Tell me about Pringle And Vick. Thinking about a trip with MLO in the future. Looking for good walleye. Been to several lakes in that area when they were owned by Nakina Air. Thanks"
547696,stukaboy,2005-05-09 08:16:00,14,"We were there late June 2002 (flew back to Armstrong on Canada Day). While there we found fish in 8-12 feet of water. We would troll shad raps / spinner rigs fairly close to shore. A good spot for this technique is a point (I believe they call it Scorpion point) approx 1 mile south of camp. If you look at the map you can't miss it -- it is the most prominent point south of camp. This is a great spot to troll because there isn't a whole lot of timber in the water around this spot, but alot of good structure. Another good spot is the ""honey hole"" northwest of camp -- sort of a mid lake hump. The camp attendant will be able to direct you to that. It is between camp and where the Ogoki river enters the lake. This is a good spot to drift jigs or spoons. We did not fish there much but a couple of guys we knew did very well there. Another great spot is right below either set of rapids where the Ogoki enters the lake. From what I understand this is where alot of people fished around the season opener. But we always did extremely well here, especially in the evening. Find some slack water near the current in 8-10 feet of water and jig. At the rapids closest to camp there is a dead tree right in the middle of the channel. This is a great spot to tie up the boat and jig. Also some huge pike in this area. We used nightcrawlers and salted minnows with a curly tail grub -- eating sized fish would hit the nightcrawlers, bigger fish the salted minnows. This pattern almost always held true. As for loosing tackle.... You can count on it. Make sure you bring plenty of tackle, especially jigs. The light wire aberdeen hooks are the best. If snagged you stand a better chance of freeing the jig since the wire will bend if enough pressure is applied. And don't forget the camp attendant. He will be a valuable source of knoweldge while you are there. He'll even go out with you the first day if you ask. Hoped this helped."
547698,jigman 2003,2005-05-09 10:02:00,981,"Ole Timer: Given a choice I would go with Pringle for overall 'eye numbers and sizes, as well as larger pike. Vick had larger numbers of average size pike. There were also areas on Vick we did not explore. The structure on Vick is more diverse and plentiful than on Pringle. Both ends of Pringle are quite shallow and once June is over, I would not imagine you would catch too many 'eyes on the ends of the lake. That leaves you with quite a bit of water eliminated, and concentrates the fish on the few reefs that are available. Stuka-thanks for the info. Did you ever go all the way down to the end of the arm of Ogoki that the camp is on? I believe it is called Moose Crossing. If so, how long was the boat ride?"
547703,stukaboy,2005-05-09 10:45:00,14,"We never made the trip out to Moose Crossing, but I undersand the fishing was great. I believe it was a 1-2 hour trip out there. If you plan on making the trip tell the camp attendant. You'll need an extra tank of fuel to make it back to camp. Do you know anything about Bellsmith?"
547714,jigman 2003,2005-05-09 13:08:00,981,"I believe Bellsmith is catch and consume only, other than that I do not know anything about it, sorry."
547733,stukaboy,2005-05-10 07:25:00,14,"No Problem. I forgot one other thing -- A good place to get bait is the Silver Minnow. It is on the road to Armstrong just outside of Thunder Bay. The guy there runs a good business. Perhaps you stop there already, just thought I would mention it."
