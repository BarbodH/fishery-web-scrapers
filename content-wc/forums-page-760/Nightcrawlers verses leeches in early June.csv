We did not use nightcrawlers last year but are picking them now. Dont intend to pay $39.00 a pound if crawlers work as good. We are going in early June. Should crawlers be as good or better then leeches?

Have to say the water we fish, the jumbo leeches out fish minnows and nightcrawlers. WIth nighcrawlers the best bite was coming on jigs and floating rigs, simply dragging them across the bottome wasn't working."

Last year the biggest fish was on a crawler. The year before it was on an artificial. The point is, don't forget to use artificials also. Fritz"

But still for many years we took up and fished with minnows and leeches with mixed results. One day while on top of one of those big school of walleyes there were three of us in the boat my leech doubting 40 yr old son said ,dad you keep fishing with minnows, Joe Six pack and I will use leeches. I don't remember how many more I caught but never took leeches that far north again. Try it some time while on a big school. Granted different time and place could prove different but thats the fun be it leeches, nightcrawers, or minnows. PS. There are water worms swimming around up there but their not leeches."

547887,Guest,2005-05-13 08:02:00,0,"I believe you are correct. Those big (12"") things swimming around Lac Seul that appear to be a huge leech is a sub-specie of the leech that we use for bait, which I think is called a mud leech. I think. The huge version the fish do not care to eat, but the smaller dark colored leech they do find very tasty. There are lakes that far north that have good populations of the smaller variety. Don't take this as written in stone, but I think it is close to correct. The world according to grumpy."

We have both leeches and crawlers along to use with jigs. I prefer half a crawler to leeches, but not all in my group agree. I think it's all about what you have confidence in."
