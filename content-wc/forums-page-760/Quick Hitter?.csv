548094,Guest,2005-05-18 19:32:00,0,"Hey Bevy, With your fish catching talent, you can go anywhere and they'll jump in the boat for you. Even Ed will be able to catch them if he goes with you. Ever think of trying Kabetogama. I understand that this lake has come a long ways in the last couple of years. Your ol man and I could even point out some of the old hot spots. Oh heck, just go to Gullrock. If you go as far as Ear Falls, you just as well go another 30 miles. Like Tommy Wilson used to say, why not spend a few more hours in the car to get somewhere that you can catch fish as to spend that few hours in a boat on a lake not catching fish. Besides, you already know the lake. Pat T"
548095,Guest,2005-05-18 20:46:00,0,New place just opening outside of Dryden on Thunder Lake. Close to alot of lakes to catch walleyes. Dryden Walleye Hideaway http://www.geocities.com/fishinginontario/?200523
548120,Gary_IA,2005-05-19 11:53:00,144,"You might try Cascade Camps on Rainy Lake. It is on the north end of the north arm. About 5 years ago we stayed there, an older bare bones camp with daily rates. Resort operator arranged for our pickup at the goverment docks in a camp boat for a 20 to 25 mile boat ride to the resort. (Thank god for good weather on the way in and way out.) Excellent smallmouth bass fising below ""Devils Cascade"" a waterfall about 100 yards from camp. Best fishing off the docks. I think there are some nice drive to resorts on Rainy and some island resorts that are more upscale than Cascade Camps. There are a number of resorts on Lake of the Woods out of Morson, Ontario.(Mailing address is Sleeman, Ontario) Mylies Place and Buena Vista Resort are near town on the mainland. There are several island resorts or boat in resorts that you can acess: Tamarack Island Lodge and Grassy Narrows Lodge in Miles Bay are two that come to mind. There are a number of other island resorts in the general area. You might do a Google Search if interested."

548222,Trailerguy,2005-05-22 12:52:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Another good choice would be Wabaskang Lake at Perrault Falls. http://www.sleepydogcabins.com/ They often times can accomodate a quickly planned trip. It's not a big resort, but that means more personalized attention, and he's just finished another new cabin this spring. It's located right around the bay from my cottage, and the fishing is great."
547994,bevy8,2005-05-16 14:12:00,8,"Looking for some ideas or suggestions on a quick 3 or 4 day trip to Ontario to fish some walleyes? I usually take a week trip in late September to Gull Rock with a group of guys but for some of us the ""walley bug"" has bitten early this year. We are thinking of trying a different quick hitter trip during early/mid summer to a new location for 3 or 4 days bring our own boats. Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated....Thanks!"
547995,Guest,2005-05-16 14:42:00,0,Where you comiong from???
547997,Trailerguy,2005-05-16 15:41:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Since you know Gullrock, go to Ear Falls, get a room at the Trillium, then launch into Lac Suel on a nice day or into the Engish River below the dam on a windy day."
548018,bevy8,2005-05-17 07:52:00,8,"Coming from Cedar Falls, Iowa."
548019,Fred_G,2005-05-17 08:21:00,908,Check out www.oldpost.com. It's a long haul up there but the fishing is worth it.
548031,Renn,2005-05-17 12:22:00,87,"Bevy, Since your in Cedar Falls and your looking for a long weekend trip you might want to consider Rainy Lake on the Minnesota/Canada border. We fished there a couple of years ago in the middle of June and had a blast catching 3-6 lb. smallmouth in very tough fishing conditions! The nice thing was that we caught quite a few very nice walleyes pitching crankbaits, Rapalas, and spinner baits for bass. Were we stayed we were able to fish Red Gut, Seine and Swell Bays. If your not familiar with Rainey, these bays are about the size of Gullrock Lake. :-) It was a fun trip though and it's about 8 or 9 hours from you. Later, Renn"
548034,Guest,2005-05-17 12:50:00,0,If you want to try something different and unbelivable go to the Red River north of Winnipeg and fish for Catfish. You will catch fish until your arms get tired. Average day with four guys in boat run 100++++ fish with average weight 20lbs. Its different and it is a blast....sore arms...you will get them....tons of fun....you will have it. Its a great short trip with guranteed results.
548038,Guest,2005-05-17 15:21:00,0,"Bevy, Depending on how ""quick"" you want. Dryden area with Wabagoon and Dinorwic Lakes is pretty nice!! about 10-12hr drive from CF. We are leaving from Happy Chef on 1st St. the morning of the 27th for our week of ""fun in the sun"" I can't wait. Finding it hard to concentrate at work...."
548073,Guest,2005-05-18 08:54:00,0,Why not come up to the Angle on LOTW. Any number of resorts in the area. Fish MN and Canada.....
548077,Guest,2005-05-18 11:39:00,0,"bev , i agree with trailorguy , u cant go wrong at ear falls area , and as he said , if windy on lac suel . right below the #### on the river is awersome walleye fishing , if your interested on the other side of lac suel , try www. country camping at sioux lookout , it sits on big vermillion lake with many lakes all around you , including lac suel , your choice , contry camping will accomodate on daily basis , good luck .. key"
