548046,Guest,2005-05-17 18:17:00,0,"I am a Canadian & think its a bloody shame we are not allowed to have a couple of pints in the boat. As long as you are not looped, whats the big deal?? Its part of the Canadian heritage!!! Speaking of which, I saw someone talking about ""Bloody Marys"" Up here we have ""Motts Clamato"" juice we use instead of Tomato juice & we call it a ""Ceasar"" Give it a try next time your up!!"
548053,Guest,2005-05-17 20:10:00,0,Thanks for the bloody mary tip....I'll try that.
547922,Guest,2005-05-13 14:02:00,0,"Ok....despite my name this is no joke. This is my daily routine while up at my place in Ontario for the week. Awake around 6:00 am, get breakfast cooking while my bro-in-law makes us a bloody mary. Eat, clean up, have another bloody mary. Get fishing tackle and boat ready to go while the bro fills the cooler with a combination of the following: 50 ale, XXX, Maxima ice, maybe a few waters or cokes. Fish until around 2:00....come back for an after noon siesta, wake around 4:00. Fix a bloody mary and get things going for dinner. After eating have another bloody mary and get things ready to go while the bro fills the cooler up for the evening of fishing. Been doing this since 1993 with no worries short of being stopped with a cooler full of beer."
547937,JimH,2005-05-14 07:17:00,320,"About 20 years ago, I watched a friend lose a 50""+ muskie that was destined for the wall because he was too boozed up on brandy to remember which way to turn the star drag to loosen it. Each year I remind him of his stupidity and how much that fish must appreciate it. Needless to say, he doesn't drink while fishing any more. ;)"
547943,Guest,2005-05-14 09:29:00,0,"I guess I'd better explain. We never have any alcohol in the boat. I won't allow even my thirstiest ""alky"" friends to do that. The beer gets consumed later, back at the cabin."
547944,Guest,2005-05-14 09:30:00,0,That's ok...I'm not a meat hog or wall hanger angler...I let em all go anyway. Just like having fun on the water while on vacation.:P
547979,Guest,2005-05-16 07:49:00,0,Why is it illegal to have booze in the boat in Canada?
547984,Guest,2005-05-16 08:34:00,0,"lots of people have died and it costs Ontario a lot of money for search and rescue up there. Most deaths involve alcohol and people not wearing life jackets. Don't get me wrong....I don't get plastered or anything, just like having a beer or two while I'm fishing. I'll take my chances and pay my dues if I'm caught."
548028,Guest,2005-05-17 11:24:00,0,"Our beer ration is 2 cases per person for the week for our fly-in. Thats about a 6 pack per day for each guy. We fish from about 7 am to 9 pm every day, rain or shine. Thats less than one beer every 2 hours in the boat. Illegal? yes. Dangerous. Absolutely not. If we get caught we'll pay the fine. Part of the cost of vacation. Been doing it for over 20 years and never been drunk or had a problem yet. Its not about the alcohol, its the taste. Beer just tastes better than any other drink when fishing. Flame away, oh holier than thou types. Yes I knowingly break Canadas boating laws. I should turn myself in to the authorities. But the outfitter supplies the beer and says not to worry about it, so we dont. I have to admit that it does look funny, 16 cases of beer stacked up on the dock for our group of 8 guys. Had to pay for an extra flight one year to carry the beer. It was worth every cent. If I was a border guard and someone told me they were fishing for a week and only taking a 6 pack, I put them in the strip-search line. Thats way too suspicious. :-)"
548029,Guest,2005-05-17 11:32:00,0,I've been stopped twice in the last two years...once by the OPP and once by the fish cops. Both times we had beer in the cooler and both times neither said a word about it. These were just random stops and the only two times I've ever been stopped while on the water in Ontario in the last 25 years. The OPP was just making sure we had all the legal equipment in the boat and the fish cops just wanted to check our liscense and live well. In both of these instances the authorities were very nice. If they want to write me a ticket for having a few beers while I'm fishing than more power to them...it's the law and I willingly broke it so I'll pay my fine and be on my way....no big deal.
548030,Guest,2005-05-17 12:06:00,0,If you do get that ticket would it affect your ability to come back to Canada or would you be banned like the guys with the DUI's?
548033,Guest,2005-05-17 12:49:00,0,If you are arrested for operating your boat while intoxicated (not sure what the legal limit in Ontario is) it would be a felony and you would go to jail and be sent back to the US and denied entry back into Canada. If you get a ticket for an open container of alcohol in the boat you will just be fined.....I've heard up to $200/CA.
547813,north_alabama,2005-05-11 20:00:00,172,"take a fishing trip to Ontario without bringing or procuring my body weight in beer? Was only thinking of a 6-pack for beer batter, but I don't want to get turned away at the border (or expelled once there) for being too far outside of the normal profile!"
547815,BuckeyeWilly,2005-05-11 20:36:00,41,Do it every year there bama. Just enough for the beer batter. I'd much rather fish - a week just isn't long enough.
547820,Guest,2005-05-12 01:11:00,0,Hi. the way some people post and go to canada you would think it just to drink beer. it would be cheaper to stay home and drink. cant take it in the boat anyway. If you fish as much as you can then there is no time to drink.
547821,Catman59,2005-05-12 04:27:00,345,"I know a group from Iowa that buys a new Gas Tank every year for the boat and fills it with Whiskey , then takes their limit in beer too !!!!!!!!!!I have really never heard a good fishing report , but always hear how much ""fun"" they have..........I must be getting old , because I enjoy the fishing . Happy hour is a couple beers at 5 ish before supper, then back to fishing."
547822,jerry bark,2005-05-12 05:05:00,822,"i hear you catman, last year bought a six back at the beer store, stayed four nights, took two home.... cheers jerry < leaving next friday for 8 days of fishing, might have to buy a twelve pack!"
547826,jigman 2003,2005-05-12 06:26:00,981,"I have been going to Canada for the last 6 years with my Dad. He doesn't drink so I don't either. Not much fun to be stupid by yourself. I have taken a 6-pack for beer batter and that is it. This year I am going with a bunch of buddies, I will be taking my case of beer. 24 beers divided by 7 days equals about 3.5 beers a day. This isn't overkill in my opinion, but then I am from Wisconsin ;-) I do not want to be drunk or hung over for my week, but I do enjoy having a few and playing some cards at night. Guys that go for a week and drink themselves into a stupor every night are foolish in my opinion. Too short of a time to be in ""heaven"" to waste it."
547831,czy42strokes,2005-05-12 07:33:00,419,"We always seem to bring along someone that fits into the stupid mode. Once guy was so drunk,he fell off the bow of the boat as it was coming into the dock and went under the boat. He surfaced a little later on the other side of the dock. Days later he was still dumping mud out of his pockets. He had his tightie whities hanging in the trees trying to dry them out. He spent the entire next day in the cabin hung over. He was never asked to go fishing again."
547839,Frankm,2005-05-12 10:17:00,154,We usually bring 2-3 cases for 3 guys and a bottle of Brandy. We don't ever drink in the boat while were fishing. We have a couple after dinner. We usually have 1 night where whoop it up pretty good but still get to bed at a reasonable hour.
547840,Guest,2005-05-12 10:50:00,0,"I can easily do it with no beer. My Candian friends won't, however. :) I force myself to go with the flow....eh?"
547907,IaCraig,2005-05-13 11:51:00,434,"A case will lasts me a week easily, unless it rains hard for a couple days then I just go buy more. An ex co-worker of mine was explaining how much beer and liquor they have their resort owner line up for them each year for their 1 week trip. (something like 1 texas fifth of whiskey and 3 cases of beer for each person). I asked him when they had time to fish, and he said they drink beer all day while they fish and the whiskey is for at night. I figure that is what many of these other guys must be doing too in order to get rid of that much, unless they don't even leave the cabin. Personally, I've always lived by ""beer is for after fishing"". IaCraig"
