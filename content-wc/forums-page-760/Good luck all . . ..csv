For those not in northwestern Ontario (NWO), the weather is looking better, and we are poised to experience a much better opener than last year. The last few days have warmed up, and though some showers are in the weekend forecast, so too are temps in the upper-60s. It seems like good walleye weather. Hopefully there will be some good reports after the weekend. Well, gotta go, 'eyes be warned . . . NWO Fishing Bum"
