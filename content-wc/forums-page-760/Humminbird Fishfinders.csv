547670,nitroman,2005-05-07 07:16:00,368,I use a sealed 12v 7 amp battery from towerhobbies.com that fits inside my portable. Battery and charger are around $25 and I made a stainless mount that clamps to the transom no chance of losing it. I do have to charge the battery one time during a week long trip but considering that i am using it dawn till dusk that's not to badhttp://www2.towerhobbies.com/cgi-bin...?&I=LXL370&P=7
548061,Guest,2005-05-18 03:54:00,0,"I know you need a 12Volt battery to power humminbirds, but what AMP does it have to be? Nitroman indicated that he used a 7-amp battery but can I use other ones like 12A, 10A, etc...? Thanks"
548109,Greg Walters,2005-05-19 09:02:00,176,"Sure, it just means that the battery should last longer between charges and would generally be larger and heavier. Greg Walters at Humminbird"
548118,Guest,2005-05-19 10:50:00,0,"I have a Humminbird portable about 5 years old...don't remember the model. Two new lantern batteries have always lasted the whole week. I have never had the suction cup pop off, but the safety string advice is excellent. I'll be doing that this time. We run 40 hp motors that move along pretty good, and so far it hasn't come loose, but it is inevitable I suppose. Good Luck."
547461,Guest,2005-05-01 06:34:00,0,"I am considering purchasing a Humminbird Fishfinder. I have narrowed it down to the Piranha 20 and 535 Portable. I would purcahse the portable package with the Piranha 20. What are some pros and cons regarding these two models? For the 535 PT, how long do the two lantern batteris, which it requires, usually last? Could I go an entire fishing trip (one week) on the two batteries? Thanks for any insight."
547462,Guest,2005-05-01 07:28:00,0,I had an Eagle portable that used 2 lantern batteries and they lasted for the season. One week will not be a problem.

I have an earlier portable Humminbird, Model 300. Works well except the battery life, which sucks. I need two pairs of lantern batteries per week of heavy use."
547544,Guest,2005-05-03 08:00:00,0,"Another point about portable fishfinders. If they are suction cup models, the cup pulls off easily. The transducer can then hit the prop, get damaged or cut off, or conceivably pull the whole fishfinder into the water. I used to tie a short line directly to the transducer and a cleat. Still had to reach down and remove the transducer every time I wanted to run at full speed, then replace it when I wnated to fish. Now I punt the suction cup, tape or screw the transducer to a 1x2 piece of wood and clamp the wood to the transom. Adjust the length of the wood to put the transducer at the height you want, then cut off the extra wood. >>I am considering purchasing a Humminbird Fishfinder.

547580,Guest,2005-05-04 14:41:00,0,"Wow! Those are two discrepant reports regarding the life of the lantern batteries. Does anyone else have any other info? Also, in a rented boat with 9 ro 15 hp motor, do I really run the risk of having the suction cup transducer fall off?"
547581,Lovetofish,2005-05-04 15:10:00,458,"I tie a string on the transducer and when it's in place on the boat tie the string to the boat handle on the back so there is no slag in the rope. If the cup comes off the line will keep it out of the motor. If you are moving the transducer stays on top of the water anyway. Just don't forget to tie it on. I've done this for years when we portage, never a problem."
547584,Reels,2005-05-04 18:50:00,2876,I have always bought a small motorcycle battery to power portables. I never had much luck with lantern batteries. Vexilar also sells a nice sealed small battery for thier flasher unit. Comes with a charger. <{{}}><
547592,Guest,2005-05-05 00:28:00,0,Hi. have had a protable hummingbird for about 15 years now. the batteries last the season for me. 2 weeks in canada. I too made a dohicky that clamps the transmitter to the boat and is not a problem. clamped on never have to woryy about it again. Now I have a lund tyee and I still clamp it to the boat at the rear where I sit in addition to the one on the boat already. a real handy thing.

Does anyone else have any other info? >Also, in a rented boat with 9 ro 15 hp motor, do I really run >the risk of having the suction cup transducer fall off? Yes I have had the suction cup pull off going 1/3 speed with a 25 hp motor on a 16 feet long Lund. As mentioned below, be sure the safety line is tied off without much slack so the transducer cannot get back into the prop. I know another guy who glues his suction cup to the transom with silicone cement. Never tried this myself."
547613,Bx2(IL),2005-05-05 19:16:00,62,"I have 2 Humminbirds. One is a NS 25. A permanent mount. The other is a TCR101. That is a portable. I have used the portable for many years. The 2 lantern batteries last a whole season. I could probably use them well into the next season, but I change them every year to be safe. When not in use, I rotate the batteries so that the contacts don't make. I have lost one transducer because the suction cup did not hold at high speed, but I didn't have the safety line on. I now attach the safety line & keep it tight. I have not had a problem since."
