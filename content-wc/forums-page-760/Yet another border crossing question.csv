What is the appropriate response to that? Are they wanting you to tell them everything you're bringing in the vehicle, or just items/quantities subject to duty? If I've got my fishing gear, clothes/toiletries, some food but no banned items or large quantities of beef, tobacco and alcohol within the duty-free limit, no weapons etc., do you run through the whole list and quantities or just say ""no""? I don't want to get there and sound like a smart alec by answering questions with questions. Though I'll have nothing to hide, I find being subject to extensive searches unpleasant, and would like to get through as easy as possible both for myself and the customs/border people."

I just let them do the asking and answer them as short and simple and to the point as possible."
548157,Guest,2005-05-20 09:38:00,0,"I recall that they ask specific questions and not the general ""do you have anything to declare"""
