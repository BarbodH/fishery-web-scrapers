548040,IaDave,2005-05-17 16:01:00,476,Is that the beer in the black cans- I think it was called Labatt's Maximum Ice? That stuff packs a punch and it tastes good also. It's too strong for this old man who still thinks he is 21.
548087,Guest,2005-05-18 14:00:00,0,"IADAVE.. there are 2 kinds of Labbatt ICE. 1 is the one you refer to and I see a lot of Americans buy that stuff when they come up to fish and that is 7.3% alcohol. It still tastes like Labbatt ICE but has a stronger flavour. It comes in a silver and black can. Then there is the the regular labbatt Ice which I drink. The alcohol content is a little less at 5.5% Great smooth taste, and it comes in in an all black can. Give the regular Ice a try, I think you'll like it alot, espically under $30 CDN for 24 bottles.

547891,Guest,2005-05-13 09:05:00,0,"Since beer has been a recent topic on the board....I figured I'd throw this out for discussion. In the past, a case of Blue, Crystal, Canadian, whatever.....all cost the same. The price of a case was set, and as the tax-swallowing Canadians we are, gleefully paid. Now we see these big brewries charging quite a bit more for the often unremarkable beers. The prices have even recently encroached into the level of premium beers...pricing close now to a case of Sleeman's or Moosehead....far superior beers IMHO over the likes of Blue and Canadian. Now, with an opportunity clear and present, enter the discount brewry. Lakeport Honey Brown, Carling, Bohemian, Lucky et.al. Now, i realize that some of these lower priced beers are made by the big boys as a means of competition against the insurgent discount beer makers. But, the bottom line is, why would anyone by a regular priced case of beer nowdays? If I'm going to pay $38 for a case of blue, why not spend another 5 and get an awesome case of Sleeman's? On the flip side, if I don't want to go that high, I just shell out $26 for a case of Carling and I'm good to go. The funny part is that as much as I used to turn my nose up at some discount beers, the likes of Carling and Bohemian are VERY palatable and are good to the last drop (unlike Canadian, whereby you can't drink the last bit of swill in the bottle). Again, with good quality, taste and price, where do the big boys stand now? What are you guys buying now?"
547892,Guest,2005-05-13 09:20:00,0,"It's all the same after the 1st 6 or 8 anyway so buy a case of the good stuff and sevral cases of the low end drink 6 ""good"" ones and then start with the ""low end"" and you'll save some $$$. $38/case I guess paying the duty to bring the $14/case Bud Light across isn't such a bad idea."
547895,jigman 2003,2005-05-13 10:01:00,981,"You are going to Canada and you are going to drink BUD LIGHT??????? Come on man, at least bring Bud. Better yet bring some real beer like Sam Adams, any of Capitol Breweries beers (especially Capitol Amber which is available in cans), Pete's Wicked Ale, even American Labatt Blue would be better. Sorry if I offended you Bud Light drinkers, couldn't help myself."
547902,FIB,2005-05-13 11:26:00,23,"Usually buy a case of Labatts ""50"" and then try something new for a second case. That gets me through the week. Maybe I'll try Sleemans this year."
547910,Guest,2005-05-13 12:08:00,0,I buy Labbatt Ice..little bit stronger then blue or CDN and it is under $30 a case...I love the stuff and get more %alcohol and save about $8 a case...if you have never tried it..give it a shot. Tight Lines Pike Man1976
547934,AL,2005-05-14 05:49:00,89,"I don't mean to sound stupid, but what is the ""50"" you refer to. I've seen that a few times this spring on the board. I want to make sure I'm not missing something."
547935,grt1,2005-05-14 07:06:00,259,"I just bought my first case of Bohemian and it isn't bad, as a beer drinker, I usually got blue or blue light, but the cost is too much for a retired guy like me. at $27 per case, I'll be just as happy with the discount beer, #### after a few, I need a nap anyway!! It is interesting to see Sleemans refered to as a premium beer, Here in Red Lake the organizers of a local avaiation festival brought in truckloads of it for their beer gardens and all they got were complaints. in the end, they sold the cases they had left over for about $5. just to try and recoup some of their losses."

Well, Sleeman can be a bit of an aquired taste. I think their line has some of the best tasting beers ever made. Their Cream Ale, Lager and Honey Brown are second to none. I think a lot of those that have never let their palates branch out beyond the brown-bottle type beers are really shocked at what good beer tastes like. Some people just prefer the samey-blandness of coors, labatt's and Canadian. Too bad Sleeman's is so expensive. $39 a case is quite a bit."

They all get into office, blame the last administation for all the fiscal ""surpises"" and then ditch all their promises and hike every tax they can think of. Sound familiar? :-)"
