548093,Guest,2005-05-18 18:52:00,0,Heard that they were looking into a new hybrid bald cypress that will survive in northern climates to add additional structure to compliment the barren sand flats. Figured through research that it would be great spawning habitat for Saugers and Perch. Would guess this would also help the Smallie population. Lac Suel>>>>Swamp of the north???
548004,IA  DAN,2005-05-16 20:05:00,53,"Hump, First of all I'm from Cedar Rapids.If your staying at Evergreen you would be to far away as far as where we fish.You drive right by the Lodge we stay at going to Ear Falls(Lac Seul Lodge)around 15-20 miles south of Ear Falls on 105.We put our boats in there and then have a 30 mile boat ride to Black Bay(paradise).Dan the owner owns 2 outpost,one on Sunlight Lake(sleeps upto 4)and Black Bay(sleeps up to 9).If you know where Manitoba Point is well thats about 15 miles from our cabin(theres a waiting list for this outpost).As far as presentations Mike from Kansas would be your man to talk to.Hes been going up there since mans been going into space(sorry Mike haha).Hes usually on this board so try and locate him.He goes up to Lac Seul 3-4 times a year staying at different places including Evergreen.Usually fishing the windy sides of Islands will get you walleyes.Perch and crawdad colors in 1/4 oz.and 1/2oz. Rat-L Traps works for us when fishing for Smallmouth,walleye and northerns.We use 12-18in. snells with #4 wide gap hooks with chartruse beads.Iv'e used 10lb. fireline in the past but Iv'e switched to Power Pro.The rocks can be brutal to the line and Fireline has a tendency to fray,Power Pro does'nt,IMO.Since the the Lake is a stained color you dont have to worry about using invisible lines on snells.By the way where are you from. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."
548007,Guest,2005-05-16 20:32:00,0,Better call your resort host..... Lac Suel will be drained right after walleye spawn for MAJOR lake renovations. These renovations should take approx 2-3 years to complete. Access to deeper pools will difficult and not recommended unless 4X4 or track loader are used. Other possible fishing area would be the old English River channel. Hope this message makes it to all those who are considering LS for this and future years. Suggest other lakes to satsify your fishing needs....
548008,wooglin,2005-05-16 20:36:00,371,"Nojoke - can you elaborate a little more on this topic? When will it be drained? I was there two years ago, water was down 6 feet, can we expect the same this year? If so, when? Not sure if you're serious, so I figured I'd ask. Thanks!"

548023,Mike Kansas,2005-05-17 10:00:00,1463,"Ia Dan, Dan, thanks for letting everbody know that I was on the work crew that built the Dam at Ear Falls in 1935. We are getting ready for our annual trek to Black Bay. I think it will be our 20th year there. Im getting so old I cant remember. We started there before Dan owned it and it wasnt as nice as it is now. The fishing has always been great but in the early days you needed to make sure the mosquitos didnt feast on you all night. My wife and I fished at Evergreen last year and the fishing was good. Wife got a 31 1/2"" Walleye. The lodge owners at Evergreen are great people and will help whoever stays there get on fish. Dan , how did you guys do at Black Bay last year? Black Bay is my choice for the #1 spot on Lac Seul. In our early years there we never saw any boats or fisherman, but now we see people every day...but there are plenty of fish if you work the wind and have a few Honeyholes when the wind dies down. Do you guys spend much time dragging Crank baits? We have been catching most of our big fish doing that the last several years in June and early July. August should be a great time to fish the deeper water (25+) with some Bottom Bouncers and really get on the Big Girls. We did that last August at SWWL and caught a lot of big fish. Hope to hear from you and wish you a safe and fish catching trip. Mike Kansas"
548048,IA  DAN,2005-05-17 18:26:00,53,"Hi Mike, I thought you might get a kick out of how long you've been going to Lac Seul.We always do good on Lac Seul its just that some years are better than others.Last year we ran into strong winds about every day so we had to pick and choose where we fished.Aldous Bay was alright one day and the wind changed and made it tough.We went over to Wolf Narrows and caught afew.Last year we had our best luck around Fish Gut Bay and the cove between Fish Gut and Rocky Point.The Island with the Foxon Light (we call it Bird**** Island)had a lot of walleye stacked in there.We went back in alittle farther to get out of the wind and had some luck on Small Mouth.This year were planning on starting at Mcdonalds Light and checking out the Islands going towards Wolf Narrows and working our way to Aldous Bay and back to the cabin for a day trip.Heck theres so many places to fish that we probably drive by alot of them.After 5 years at least I'm starting to know my way around alittle bit with out having to turn on my GPS everytime we go out fishing.Make sure you give us a report when your group gets back.I was bored so I changed all of my Rat-L Traps back treble hooks to Red and all of my Spoons also,will it make a difference,probably not but they sure look pretty HAHA.Good Luck and have a safe trip. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."
548049,IA  DAN,2005-05-17 18:35:00,53,"You heard right,two years ago the lake was so low that alot of the boaters were losing there lower units and skags from the rocks.So they decided to drain the lake and paint all of the rocks and boulders bright orange so they would be more visible to the dummys driving to fast in a area that there not familiar with.If your colored blind then you might want to find a different Lake to fish.They said it should be back to normal in 2 years. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."
548056,Guest,2005-05-17 21:12:00,0,"My guess is the fishing will be awesome @ the spillway once the lake drops another 10' or so.... Heard that there will be no size or quanity limits once the""official"" after spawn draw-down occurs. Bet the ""meat hunters"" will finally be happy??? Wonder what impact this will have on the quality of fishing below the dam @ Ear Falls?? My guess is it will become an incredeble fishing area like LS used to be. Can't wait till it's filled and restocked with true sport fish!"
548059,gus,2005-05-17 21:45:00,17,"they are not lowering the water level, they are raising the rocks off of the bottom!!!! the reason? rocks hold heat and that way the lake will not freeze over anymore"
548069,Mike Kansas,2005-05-18 07:58:00,1463,"Dan, It is always good to hear from you. You are 100% right the Black Bay area is a Walleye fishing Paradise. Our group is conversing every day and even though we all fish a lot of places all year this trip to Lac Seul is our favorite. You also hit the nail on the head when you tell new Lac Seul fisherman to fish with the wind as your friend. One of the things I love to do there is fish new areas that the wind is beating on. While there are not many spots that we havent fished close to camp we do venture out and hit new windy spots and it pays off. We have had a lot of luck east of camp fishing the north shoreline and its islands. There are many nice flats in that area and of course plenty of islands. Since you guys go in August I would think that area could hold some nice fish in the areas of the flats and their drop offs. It could be some great August fishing with bottom bouncers in the deeper water. That area has a little different structure than the Aldous Bay area and it has held some nice fish the last several years. August should have some main lake fish in that area. One of the groups with us two years ago boated over 250 Walleye(two guys) in that area in one day jigging windy shorelines. I will definitly let you know how we do when we get back. Good Luck and stay safe. Mike Kansas"
547903,FIB,2005-05-13 11:28:00,23,"It's not iced over, don't be ridiculous. I did hear however, that the commercial netting is so bad that the fishing is terrible."
547913,Guest,2005-05-13 12:31:00,0,I'm not worried about netting cause I have read here and other sites that it is not a problem doesn't harm the fisheries in any way.
547920,Guest,2005-05-13 13:51:00,0,No ice and no netting on Lac Seul but the Walleye all have a calcium defiency and their teeth are all falling out....so the bite this year will be really soft.
547923,Guest,2005-05-13 14:14:00,0,"Destroyer, I would guess that ""EVERY"" lake in Canada freezes during the winter. That was supposed to be the joke. There is an equation that covers this. Water freezes when it is very cold + Canada is very cold in winter = Water freezes I am not about to convince someone to go up north to fish. I have several friends that will not go north because they do not want to spend the money, or they complain about the drive, but they will drive a boat all day long on a Wisconsin Lake looking for a walleye over 15 inches. I come home every year with plenty of pictures of Moby Walleyes caught on Lac Seul, and still only have the same six friends going, and no additions. Fine by me...their loss."
547924,Guest,2005-05-13 14:41:00,0,"Destroyer said: > Are you handicapped???!!! Lac Seul always freezes >over...its not an ocean numbnuts!! I don't care if you were taking the bait or not, that was pretty funny! Been going there 18 years. We dont count the numbers and your arent gonna have 100 fish days every day. But you prolly will one day if you have a little luck, fish hard and have a little knowledge. On the other hand, catching 30 nice walleyes in a day is a pretty good day too. Personally, I get sick of catching them after a while, they really dont fight that well. So we fish pike some. As for your brother. If he doesnt wanna go, leave him home. He will believe you next year. I will say this, no one year really sticks out as way better or way worse than other years for us."
547925,Guest,2005-05-13 15:42:00,0,Bor is right. Lac Seul froze solid last winter from top to bottom. Go figure. I might still try it in June if its thaud out yet. Git er done.
547957,IA  DAN,2005-05-15 07:35:00,53,"Duckhunter, Weve been going up there for 6 yrs. now for one week at BlackBay Outpost, 1st wk in Aug.Your not going to have 100 aday catches all the time but you will not get skunked.I took my 30 yr old son with us for the 1st time last year and after we came in I would ask him how many fish he had caught that day and he could'nt tell me.I told him if you don't know then it must of been a good day and he agreed.Every yr. we explore new areas and we havent been disappointed yet.They had to teach me how to catch walleye and if I can do it anyone can.We use alot of nightcrawlers and leeches on homemade snells.TAP TAP TAP,feed them line,feed them line,feed them line, set the hook.The nice thing about fishing up on Lac Seul is if you miss one fish theres probably another 100 down there waiting for you to try again,can you say that about lakes around where you live?I'm from Iowa and I look forward to making the 13 hour trip to Lac Seul,I catch and eat more walleye and northern in aweek than I can catch and eat in a year at home.Take in the scenery also, its really beautiful up there with all of the wild life.Its not uncommon to see a moose or a bear swimming in the lake and a lot of bald eagles with the loons always near by.If your brother goes up there once I'll bet he will be hooked just like the rest of us.Its the one fishing trip that I look forward to every year. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."
547980,Hump,2005-05-16 08:01:00,578,"Where is this area located. I will be at Evergreen the last week of June. Any suggestions, tips, places to fish etc? Where in Iowa? If you would prefer my e-mail is [email protected]. Thanks"
547992,duckhunter,2005-05-16 13:04:00,2,Thanks for the replies. You convinced my brother to go along. I think it was the guys who were subtly trying to tell him to stay home so they had more walleyes for themselves. It worked.
547993,Guest,2005-05-16 13:48:00,0,"we can tell the truth now. Bullheads and Crappie galore in Lac Seul....some big ones too....8""+++"
547802,duckhunter,2005-05-11 16:08:00,2,I am trying to convince my brother that he should come with us on our fishing trip to Lac Seul. This will be our second year at Lac Seul and he thinks our trip last year (which he couldn't make) was a fluke. We had tremendous fishing and I told him it was like that most of the time. He thinks I'm telling fish stories so I need everyones help. For those that have fished Lac Seul please tell him how great the trip will be. I will then print off your responses and let him know how the real fishermen view Lac Seul. Thanks in advance for the help.
547812,gus,2005-05-11 19:50:00,17,we go up every year with 8 people have counted up to 500 walleyes in a week. only had one bad year in 20 that our group has gone.
547816,Guest,2005-05-11 20:52:00,0,Our group has fished for one week on Lac Seul for over 10 years. Six of us caught over 1200 Walleye during that week at least half of our trips. the worst year that i can remember was around 900 walleye. this doesent even count Pike and the ever increasing Smallmouth population. Lac Seul is #1.
547819,Guest,2005-05-11 22:38:00,0,"If you spend a good 5-6-7 days on lac seul, there is NO reason why you shouldn't catch at least 150+ fish for the week. That is a VERY low ball number. I have had single days where I know me and my one (1) fishing partner boated over 200 fish. It can be rediculous at times. Find the right spot and it will be like crappie fishing. Catch one on literally every cast. Nice thing is, these spots are every where. It is such a great feeling to have later that night when you can hardly move your arm because it is so sore from setting the hook all day long. I don't care who you are, you can never get tired of jigging 3-7 lb walleyes no stop. All that being said, it does depend on what time of year you will be going. Was up there early june last year and actually had 2 days where we didn't catch an under to eat...unless you want to knife a 10-12 inch fish. It was TOUGH to say the least. But the last two days before we left, 60-75 fish days easy. And that is just walleyes. If one were to just fish for walleyes all day long, never throw a big spinnerbait for pike or flip for smallies, whatever. Strictly 100% walleyes, I bet with 2 people in a boat, you could boat over 300 fish. SOme might call me stupid or say I am lying but we only fish maybe 4 or 5 hours for walleyes a day and catch around 30 or so. Key is finding them. ONce you find them and figure out what they want, get out the icy hot bc your arm is going to be tired."
547855,Guest,2005-05-12 17:09:00,0,Your best bet is to leave him at home! More fish for your group and the rest of us. If he can't believe his own brother who can he trust?
547867,Guest,2005-05-12 20:51:00,0,Lac Seul actually iced over this winter causing a lack of oxygen and all the big ones died off. Very unfortunate because the past years we always caught hundreds per person.
547875,manitobawalleye,2005-05-13 05:03:00,885,untrue
547884,Guest,2005-05-13 07:31:00,0,"Are you handicapped???!!! Lac Seul always freezes over...its not an ocean numbnuts!! And the idea that all the big ones died because of a lack of oxygen is simply ridiculous. Just about every lake in Canada freezes in the winter and all the fish don't die. During long cold winters with lots of snow on the ice will deplete SOME of the oxygen in the lake but doesn't cause much mortality, it simply makes the fish very inactive during the winter. As a result they might weigh slightly less from not eating as much but they will make it through the winter. Use that empty round thing on your shoulders before you speak and we will all be better off. D"
547885,Guest,2005-05-13 07:43:00,0,"Wow! The bite is on and two so far in the net. The best bait seems to be a stupid comment designed to get a laugh. Top it with a sober tone in the writing and an aggressive bite is sure to occur. This presentation is used often in forums in the states but appears to be a new type of lure up nort. lol, The world according to grumpy."
547893,Guest,2005-05-13 09:24:00,0,"No kidding it iced over completely. I never heard that before, I'd better call my camp owner and see if iy's worth making the trip."
