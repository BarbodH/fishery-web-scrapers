548122,gus,2005-05-19 11:59:00,17,last year we got checked and the guy never said a thing about our 2 10lb bags of potatoes. Why does everyone on here say that you cannot bring potatoes
548127,Trailerguy,2005-05-19 14:20:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Because the potatoes carry a disease from the soil they are grown, from some regions of the USA.Which is why Canada won't let them in, (unless you are a big importer who pays to have the potatoes inspected). Canada doesn't want the disease to spread, because it would hurt their domestic production and the USA would shut down importation just like they did on cattle. It's all politics. Besides what would the customs people be looking for if it wasn't potatoes?"
548129,snaggletooth,2005-05-19 14:33:00,135,We usually bring a grocery bag full of midwestern-USA-grown sweet corn to the island resort on LOTW that we visit. The resort owners tell us its a treat for them. We've always declared the corn at the border crossing too. It has never been questioned or confiscated. Consider all the nasty little bugs that can hide in an ear of corn !!
548138,Catman59,2005-05-19 17:55:00,345,We didnt take any potatoes last year as usual and werent asked about them at Ft Francis either. We went on our grocery run in Dryden and bought our Idaho Russets there !!!!!!!!!!!
548139,Andre M,2005-05-19 19:46:00,86,"I cross the US border every week-end and because I'm not allowed to bring: beef,veal,lamb I habitually take my 30.06 and shoot myself a nice beef right after I cross the border. I don't want to died eating Canadian beef so I rather kill one on the other side of the border."
548146,mdgretz,2005-05-20 05:30:00,3,"Potatoes have not been allowed for a couple years. Whether or not you've been asked about them at the border crossing is, like everything else about crossing, just luck of the draw. It's just a matter of time before it's your turn to be pulled over for the BIG SEARCH. We've never been asked about potatoes, but last year as we were leaving the check point at Thunder Bay, I saw a ""mountain"" of confiscated U.S. potatoes over in the area where they strip down the unlucky vehicles entering from the U.S. We joked that those potatoes would probably end up at the store in Ignace where we will buy our weeks supply potatoes later that afternoon.
