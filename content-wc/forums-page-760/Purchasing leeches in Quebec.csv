I am looking to either order some and have them shipped to our lodge, or pick them up on the way if I can find a store close to our route of travel. I will be going to Senneterre, Quebec via Ottawa and Maniwaki the second week of June. Any help would be greatly appreciated."

548083,Guest,2005-05-18 12:13:00,0,"Bruce: I know exactly where you mean. This is the subway station that is open all night, right. We always stop there late at night for a bite to eat. Do you remember if the Texaco station is open 24 hours?"
548116,Guest,2005-05-19 10:46:00,0,Evetyone Yank who passes through Maniwaki must stop at that station. Up and back. I wonder where the guy who owns that place spends HIS winters?
548119,Guest,2005-05-19 11:24:00,0,"i don't know if the texaco station is open 24 hrs. look up the algonquin hotel tele. no, ask for rock and he'll tell you."
