549244,Mille Lacs Guy,2005-06-14 12:29:00,401,I borrow my brother in laws Navionics chip for Minaki and I'm not sure of which chip it is for sure but I think it is the one you are referring to. I does show depth contours. I think they are 5 or 10 foot contours but it definately has contours. I go up with some guys that have been going up there for 20 years plus and they were looking for some sunken rock islands on Big Sand and couldn't find them and I pulled right up to them with the Navionics chip. I also think the chip has navigation trails or whatever you want to call them on it. It shows you were you should be driving etc. It's a pretty good chip.
549249,Guest,2005-06-14 14:56:00,0,Yes that is the chip you need. It does show contours and it is quite accurate. Also great when the fog rolls in and you can't see the front of your boat!!!
549253,Reels,2005-06-14 15:27:00,2876,"So, it is the navionics great lakes west? If it does have that info, then I stand corrected, it would be a good investment for me at least. Thanks! <{{}}><"
549258,doc,2005-06-14 16:40:00,143,"Yes, The Great Lake West chip has contours. I just have a problem paying $200 for a chip I only need a small portion of. I wish they had the option of a smaller area at a reduced price."
549261,Reels,2005-06-14 17:17:00,2876,Maybe we should start time sharing some of these chips? <{{}}><
549263,doc,2005-06-14 17:37:00,143,Thats a great idea! Maybe A Local pro shop would do that.
549266,dockehr,2005-06-14 18:22:00,67,"doc, go to the Lowrance website and look into their FreedomMaps series of chips. The one you would be interested is their F29-Northern Ontario chip. This chip will include the Minaki area BUT these chips do not have contours. So you have two choices: $199 for the Navionics chip with contours or the Lowrance chip for $89-$99 without contours. I have both chips; the FreedomMaps chip does a great job on lake outlines and many if not most islands on even smaller lakes ( I use it for my fly-in trips). The Navionics chip I got for fishing the Canadian portion of LOTW. Hope this helps. dockehr Dr. Roland E. Kehr, Jr. Lindy Tackle"
