549271,Guest,2005-06-14 21:07:00,0,"That's a big one....but 53""? Looks more like 45. Nobody believes me except my boat partner because I didn't get a photo (my camera got wet and the film didn't develop) but I caught a 60 incher two years ago South of Minaki in the River while fishing for smallies...the friggin thing was so big I couldn't get it in the boat...had to release it at the side of the boat after measuring it. There are some big ones on that system."
549272,Guest,2005-06-14 21:15:00,0,Awsome fish and boy does that ever get a guy pumped!!!!!!!!!
549288,Reels,2005-06-15 07:03:00,2876,"Maybe even 54"". We had three hands under her, and did not do the tail pinch. We wanted to get her back into the water. 36 on the tape on the side of the boat and 17 on the judge. She did come out of the river south of Minaki, on a bottome bouncer and spinner. <{{}}><"
