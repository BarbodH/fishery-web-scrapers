549191,Stu,2005-06-13 21:58:00,472,"Spirits, yeah I think that was what ben was talking about."
549017,Guest,2005-06-10 10:15:00,0,What is with the little pile of rocks on the sides of roads? They are placed on top of bedrock outcroppings...
549018,Guest,2005-06-10 10:58:00,0,Aliens...LOL. Sorry. Don't know for sure but I saw some tourists building one one time.
549019,Guest,2005-06-10 11:32:00,0,"They are called Inukshuk's. They were originally unique to the Canadian north, but now people build them all over. Inukshuk's are very symbolic and represent cooperation. Much like a team, each stone in an Inukshuk is supported by the other stones around it. Inukshuk's were used to help guide people through the arctic wilderness, and moreover Inukshuk's simply demonstrate that other people have been across that land and/or have used that land for some purpose."
549021,Guest,2005-06-10 12:20:00,0,The fact that people erect such symbolic creations for no reason makes me sick. These people should be put to sleep after they are beaten to within an inch of there pathetic lives. I make a point to knock over every one i see on the road...this takes me awhile to do cause they are freakin everywhere. I need help with this so i am calling out for volunteers to help me eradicate this rediculous tradition of moronic tourists trying to be creative. So next time you are out driving and you see an Inukshuk please take the time and kick it over and kick the #### of the person doing it if you catch them in the act. D
549022,Guest,2005-06-10 12:23:00,0,"yeah, but before you beat the crap out of the guy and his two little kids, make sure they aren't 'legitimate rock stackers'. I'd hate to see them beaten down because of the post above. booooo"
549023,Guest,2005-06-10 12:35:00,0,"Destroyer, who are you to decide what is and what isn't the real stack of rocks? I guess god decided to make you the enforcer of the north. Some of those rocks that you knocked down could be put there for the real reason and I feel sorry for people like you. Better to put your time on other more productive things besides being a ""rock hound"""
549024,Guest,2005-06-10 12:43:00,0,Hook line and sinker....LOL
549025,Guest,2005-06-10 13:29:00,0,"Actually these rock piles are set up by american tourists returning home after their vacation. Because they are not allowed to bring open liquor back into the US, all the partial bottles are stashed in the woods for the next trip back. The rock piles are merely a way of finding these liquor stashes...so quit knocking them over! Oh, by the way did you hear the tragic news that Willy Nelson died yesterday after being hit by a car? Apparently he was playing on the road again. Pity."
549078,grt1,2005-06-12 06:49:00,259,"As the tv shows explain the inukshuks were designed to show that someone had visited that place but the number of stones used in the topping of the statue indicates the number of days travel the person would be going from that spot and the arms were used to indicate the direction travelled, however with 2 arms how the #### did the people following know which direction the erectors of the inukshuk went?"
549096,Guest,2005-06-12 12:56:00,0,These piles of rocks have religious significance and are sacred and guide souls and ancestors to the after life. Any body who defiles or damages these these monuments will answer to a higher power. Many who have defiled these have been cursed. Why not just leave them alone......
