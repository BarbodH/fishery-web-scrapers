My wife and I will be leaving this Friday and staying at Goose Bay. I have read just about everything in the archives on Goose Bay, but still had a question. Can I buy my license at the resort or should I stop somewhere along the way to pick it up? If not at the resort, any places someone would suggest along the way from Fort Frances? Also, haven't seen much for reports from up there recently. Have the Walleyes moved out into the main lake now? From the archives it seems like this time of the year is about when they are moving. Just trying to get a bearing on where to start looking the first day on a new lake! Thanks for any help!"

I will plan on stopping. From the archives on this board I pretty much found that they echoed your exact comments on the lodge. Therefore I am taking my own boat (always have in the past) and am certainly not expecting 4 star accomodations. As long as it is well kept and the people are friendly my wife and I should be happy. We are pretty easy to please. She stays happy as long as we are catching fish! Thanks again!"

The history of the place is interesting, one of the very first camps on LS, started by a the owners father, but he was killed in an airplane crash while hunting wolves a very long time ago. Don't know if it still run by the same people or not."
