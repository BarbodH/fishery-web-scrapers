We've been told that alot of the big Northern this time of year are caught while simply jigging for Walleye. My question is what type of line or leaders to use while jigging for Walleye to prevent bite offs and increase our chance of landing a big fish. We have our large baitcasters rigged up for the Northern but as far as our jigging poles go we typically use 6 or 8lb iron silk any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Tight Lines,"
548666,Fred_G,2005-06-01 09:23:00,908,"I prefer 10 lbs Fireline. You'll still get some bite offs, but not as many as with monofilament. I also like the increased sensitivity of Fireline for jigging."
548668,Guest,2005-06-01 09:34:00,0,"I agree fred, fireline is what I use when I know I am not going to get snagged up on the bottom very often. As long as you trim the last few feet off at least every day, should not have a problem bringing in those big jacks as a bonus."
548670,Guest,2005-06-01 09:52:00,0,"i like taking one pike rod/reel setup along when jigging for walleye. you'll find that once you get a bite off you can drop a heavy jig (1oz) with a small chub and entice the pike to bite it. i've been jigging in 30' of water catching walleyes in the fall, then when pulling them up a pike will cruise around at 10-12 feet and attack the caught walleye like a shark as i'm reeling in the walleye. its cool at first, but after 3 or 4 times in a row it just gets annoying, plus, if a pike enters the area, the walleye bite will completely shut off until he leaves or you catch him on the forementioned rig."
548706,brian1785,2005-06-02 07:16:00,1534,I'll use fireline with a 3ft leader of 10 or 12lb flourocarbon on the end.
548710,wooglin,2005-06-02 07:43:00,371,"I usually just fish with one pole, even when I'm targeting walleye or pike, and its a big pain in the ash to keep switching baits, retying...etc. I was thinking about picking up a second pole for my trip, keeping one rigged for pike and one rigged for walleye. Let me know what you think for this. Pole 1 on 8lb or 10lb fireline for jigging pulling cranks for walleye. Pole 2 on 12lb or 15lb fireline with a 3 foot 20lb flourocarbon leader for tossing spoons, topwaters and cranks. Thanks!"
548718,Guest,2005-06-02 08:22:00,0,"definitely get a second rig. less time retieing means more time with your lure in the water = more fish. in my boat arsenal i carry atleast 2 rigs for each species. for eyes i prefer a light action graphite to jig with and will use a med-light to troll lindy's, a dependable reel is the shimano spirex 2000. pike i like a graphite med-heavy berkely bionix with a shimano spirex 4000RD. you have to get the 4000RD with the rear drag, because you can set the drag fairly light for the 4/5 pounders, then quickly up the tension (during a run) with the fightin' drag when a monster hits.

I use a rig much like this, 10 lb Spiderwire Stealth with 2 to 3 feet of 20 lb mono tied directly onto the jig. Sometimes I use a swivel between the main line and the leader. If you get a pike, check the line, cut if back and retie if the fish has nicked it. I have been using just cheap mono for the leader, the lake I use it on is stained dark. This line is very tough and easy to tie. Might try fluorocarbon although I often have trouble with the knots. If you get even a little nick from a pike's teeth in fluorcarbon, what happens? Big disadvantge of this rig is if you get a snag you lose everything. Regards, RSH"
548823,brian1785,2005-06-04 18:45:00,1534,"The flourocarbon is pretty resiliant. As far as losing everything, I usually pull hard enough so it will bend the hook of the jig. Otherwise I just break it off at the flourocarbon, thus the reason for the 12 lb test."
