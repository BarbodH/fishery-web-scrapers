According to the people who fly us in, we can only take crawlers that are in bedding, not dirt. Where could/should these be purchased? My feeling is that they would be cheaper in the US. Is that correct? Any input is appreciated."

549169,Guest,2005-06-13 18:23:00,0,"Getting crawlers in the US is definately cheaper than getting them in Canada. They sell them by the dozen in Canada--very expensive. You can get a flat of crawlers from any of the baitshops in Superior/Duluth, Minneapolis, Eau Claire, or can order them online from various places--prices vary but are usually 50$ or so for a flat(50 to 60 dozen or so of big ones). Enter 'night crawlers' into google, the last ones I ordered in bulk came from Wisconsin somewhere. They arrived in 2 days in excellent shape. You can take them across in bedding. Get bedding at Walmart, K-Mart, Gander Mountain, etc. We prepare it ahead of time, and usually pick up our crawlers in Superior/Duluth. You can put them in the bedding when you get them. We've never had a problem crossing the border at Ft. Francis or Rainy River. They ask if we have live bait, we tell them crawlers that are packed in bedding. They've never bothered to look.
