549211,tjsker,2005-06-14 07:54:00,301,Traveling east from Winnipeg to Kenora there's a bait shop (or shops) on the south side of the road. I'd like to pick up some live bait (crawlers or leeches) to use on LOW. Does anyone know of their names and if it's worth stopping there?

Also Bobby's on the south side in Vermillion Bay is larger, and also busyier. I've used them both in the past."
