549208,Otts,2005-06-14 07:10:00,119,Just got back from fishing. The fishing was really good when the wind was blowing. When the winds died so did the fishing. Minnows were the main bait in the mornings and by afternoon you could use minnows or crawlers. They never really wanted the leeches. Water temps were around 59 degrees. Lots of fish caught and they were mainly in the 15 to 21 range. Never made it to Sen Bay but had neigbors who did and they caught some big fish on the sand but they never said if they had numbers of fish. Looking forward to be in there in two weeks. Otts

Am trying some salted minnows this year, some people say they are good for tipping a jig. We will see, good luck at the new camp. Jim"
549290,Guest,2005-06-15 07:11:00,0,I am going to bring some salted minnows also. When the fish were really hitting we were catching them on the dead minnows also. So I think it is worth a try. Otts
