549015,Guest,2005-06-10 07:54:00,0,"Was up for opening week at Sioux Lookout. We fished some on Minnitaki and caught fish about everywhere we went, however, our best luck was at the ""chutes"" where Minnitaki empties into Abram. The water level is up and still rising. Some rocks that are normally exposed are just under water so be careful. Alot of guys I talked with were fishing down in SE bay and doing really good on main lake points. Keep in mind, the ice was out early and the spawn was over earlier than usual. That being said, look for walleye on points and a little deeper. Don't overlook shallow bays or thinner water though. Good Luck...eyesnatcher"
