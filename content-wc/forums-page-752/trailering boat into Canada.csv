Any special issues to deal with to get thru Customs, going either way? Another thread said we don't need Ontario-style safety equipment, just those items that satisfy regs here in our home state. Anyone know if this is official policy? I have a tendency to get stopped in boats by the OPP, four times now."

I taped them shut for the next couple years, but quit a while back and no one mentioned it again. IaCraig"

But the trailer, like the tow vehicle is subject to Canadian traffic laws. That's where the closed saftey chain thing, and the 80 killometer speed limit gets you. Just like the speed laws vary from state to state here."

549237,Trailerguy,2005-06-14 11:26:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]A few years back they even let you use a rubber band. But someone told me they were insisting on a closed hook now.

However, it is my understanding that when you are on the water in Canada you need to be carrying the required safety equipment. You can buy small cannisters that contain the safety equipment at any Canadian Tire. It has been so long since I have opened one of the cannisters, I can't remember exactly what is in them. I think there is a floating line, a whistle, a mirror and some other things. I am sure you can find out the details regarding the boating regulations for Ontario online. I have never been checked on the water, but I know other people that have been checked. Good luck fishing. The trip is well worth it."
