549247,Guest,2005-06-14 13:37:00,0,GRT1 I told you to put those spinners away and jig. My guys last week were having 100 plus days anchoring and jigging in 20ft. most are doing better anchoring and vertical jigging.
549250,Guest,2005-06-14 15:04:00,0,those are some nice pike...were they in gull or in the river?
549269,Guest,2005-06-14 20:23:00,0,"two of the pike came out of the river (also saw a young girl catch and release a 40"" + from the river as well. One came off of the dock while dead baiting, others came either from fishermans point or the flats while fishing for walleye."
549276,Guest,2005-06-14 23:20:00,0,I am getting ready to go fish the Nungusser Lake in 2 weeks. Anybody fished there? Any pointers on walleye and pike this time of year? It is apparantly a stained lake. thanks sidewinder
549303,Guest,2005-06-15 08:55:00,0,"nice. we've caught/released some big fish back in the water near there, fisherman's point is always a reliable spot. hopefully gull's trophy policy will pay off..."
548821,Guest,2005-06-04 18:26:00,0,Anyone just getting back from Gullrock? How was the fishing? What was the water temp? How deep are the fish? what were the fishing patterns? How were the bugs? What bait worked the best for the eye's? Thanks

548882,2746,2005-06-06 15:35:00,3206,"Got back Saturday. Good fishing but not the numbers of big fish we are used to on Gullrock. Fish ran in the 14 -18"" range with a few at 20-24"" and biggest 27"". Water temp in the 62-64 range and almost everybody either jigging or Lindy rig with the majority pulling Lindys. Minnows or leeches doing equally well. Fish were scattered and not yet schooled on the points etc. and, as a result, when you did find them there were lots of boats.....one of the only things I dislike about Gullrock is the amount of traffic and number of boats you find yourself negotiating around. The smaller average size and questions about where the ""big ones"" were was common conversation around camp and on the lake. Also unusually warm for much of the week with temps in the upper 70's and lower 80's and little wind."
548893,Guest,2005-06-07 08:58:00,0,Hey eyesnatcher could I get the name and number for the campground you stayed at. Is it possible for me to launch my fiberglass boat in the area. Would love to take a vacation up there with my own equiptment. Thanks in advance for your help.

548930,grt1,2005-06-08 07:33:00,259,"slow and tough in the wind, rain and cloud."
548931,grt1,2005-06-08 07:33:00,259,"the weather is cold, the wind is blowing and the rain never stops. who has the heart to go out in that?"
548944,Guest,2005-06-08 12:10:00,0,Opps. Thanks Larrym.
549058,Guest,2005-06-11 12:45:00,0,"Just returned Friday from a week on Gullrock. Cold, Windy, Rain...however, we were able to do fairly well (not as good as most years I understand) on Walleye for size and numbers. Also were able to catch a 46"",40"", and 39.5"" pike which provided some added excitement. We spent time drifting with bottom bouncers with leeches / minnows. Think they work equally well, could save money by buying leeches as they seemed to last longer (more fish per bait) than minnows. Also had very good luck pulling cranks in Ranger. bcon"
549200,grt1,2005-06-14 06:10:00,259,"the lake is up about 12 inches in the last week from all the rain and lots of debris is floating in the Red Lake - Gullrock system, be careful out there. A friend of mine told me yesterday they caught enough fish for dinner and the largest was 22 inches. According to him, the fishing was just ok. Must be the weather affecting the fish locations compared to normal."
