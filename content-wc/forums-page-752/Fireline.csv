549252,Guest,2005-06-14 15:18:00,0,fireline is some really tough stuff. instead of a stick or club for snags i wrap a few loops around the paddle on the handle. it has the same effect as a stick but i don't have to drag a stick around.
549143,wooglin,2005-06-13 12:13:00,371,"Anyone use Fireline 14lb test (Flame Green color)? What do you think? Would you change to simple mono, or power pro? I picked some up today for my new pole that I plan on solely targeting pike on. My other rig is 10lb mono for walleye..."
549160,Guest,2005-06-13 15:21:00,0,It's good line but I like the power pro better. If you put it on be sure and take some black tape and tape around the spool after you have a few strands on....it will keep the line from spinning around the spool.
549170,wooglin,2005-06-13 18:24:00,371,"Good stuff. I spooled it on tonight, I actually pre-spooled it with a bit of mono, then uni-to-uni knoted the Fireline on. It seems to work well. I'll have to cast a few times and get er wet to see how I like it. So far, so good. 14lb test, its strong as h3ll!"
549173,Guest,2005-06-13 19:22:00,0,"Good line! I have had the same line on a reel since 2000!(8lb black) I spooled the line on to another reel after 2 years so now all the line with what ever wear is down on the bottom and the new line is up on the front of the spool. And I don't see myself changing back to mono. You will also need a stick of some kind to break the line if you get hung up, that 14lb will seem like 100lb and will cut through a jersey glove easy! So wrap the line around a paddle or something Good luck. Steve"
549179,Guest,2005-06-13 19:36:00,0,Every rod I own is spooled with 14lb fireline both in green and black colors. I see no difference in performance of either color but I also fish stained water. The best advantage of it is that I have saved a few thousand dollars in jigs since I started using it because I will most often straighten a hook before breaking the line. I carry a small billy club to wrap the line on for those snags that won't let go. Fireline will really do a number on skin and gloves if you try and break a snag with your hands.
549181,wooglin,2005-06-13 19:50:00,371,"Great stuff guys, thanks for the reassurance."
549183,Guest,2005-06-13 19:55:00,0,Wooglin.....don't even think about using your hands or the reel to pull up a snag....bad things will happen. That stuff will cast a mile to. Best for jigging though.
549196,Guest,2005-06-14 05:12:00,0,I plan on using fireline for trolling for northerns/walleye. I've used a 4' flourocarbon leader in the past - anyone just tie fireline direct to lure? Any notable differences/preferences?
549216,Fred_G,2005-06-14 08:49:00,908,I have tried both ways and found no difference in catch rates when using the flourocarbon leader. I always tie direct now. It just eliminates one more place for something to break.
549217,wooglin,2005-06-14 08:53:00,371,"Curiously, do you use a swivel hook so you can quickly change baits? I notice after casting a crank for a while with no hits, I change, I change again, and I change again....tying is a real beatch, so swivel hooks and leaders are nice because they're just 'click on's'."
