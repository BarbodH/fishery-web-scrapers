549221,1shooter,2005-06-14 09:32:00,1493,Heading up to Grassy Narrows in early July. Normally we bring our own boats but ended up 1 short. The resort we go to only rents small boats so we are looking to rent a 16' or larger boat. Does anyone know of a place that would rent such a boat?
549230,Bill Krejca,2005-06-14 10:28:00,6107,Try Buena Vista or Mylies.
549241,1shooter,2005-06-14 12:03:00,1493,Do you know if they will rent to you if your not staying at their resort.
549255,Bill Krejca,2005-06-14 16:19:00,6107,"I have rented boats from Buena Vista when I used to camp in Obabikon. Just act like you will treat them like your own, which you should, and they'll rent them. Give em a call and ask - 1-800-488-5652. Good luck,"
549265,1shooter,2005-06-14 17:53:00,1493,Do you know what kind of boats they run.
549286,Bill Krejca,2005-06-15 06:55:00,6107,"I can't think of the name. The ones we had were 16 ft. shiny aluminum, made in Canada, I think. They may also have 18 ft, donno."
