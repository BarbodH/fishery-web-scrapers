1171084,kgeary,2010-02-22 10:51:00,88,"You will have a great time no matter where you go. They are all good lodges. I've fished over 300 lakes all over Canada. Nungesser lake is the best Walleye lake that I've fished. I own Anglers Kingdom but I'm still being straight forward. big walleye and lots of walleye. There are a lot of people who will agree. Price is well under your budget. Can buy yourselves some nice tackle or ?? with the savings. Good food, good equipment, good accomodatons, good fishing. Have a great trip, enjoy yourselves."
1171119,a3dad,2010-02-22 13:34:00,115,wait a minute... you mean your wife is going fishing WITH you??? I thought only fiancee's went fishing!!!
1171120,Gary from Iowa,2010-02-22 13:38:00,74,"You have some nice lodges among your finalists. My uncle has been going to Uchi Lake- a fly-in resort-for some years and urges me and other relatives to go. While cost is an issue for us, it appears that the rates are within your budget. The American Plan menu looks great and the lake is ""only"" 12 miles long and narrow. www.uchilake.comBTW, I have no association with or financial interest in the resort. Have a great trip.Gary"
1171252,SinOrSwim,2010-02-22 21:16:00,1528,"http://www.slatefallsoutposts.com/La...criptions.htmlVerne (slate falls)sold about half his lakes/cabins a couple years ago so we don't use him but his facilities and service are top notch. Would highly recommend him.He sold half of them to John at Red Pine Outposts (below). Either way, they have solar power, frig, freezer and INDOOR toilet/shower. Everything is always in very good working order.http://fishredpine.com/thelodge.htmlThe onel below is Walston and it's been YEARS since we used them. But, we did stay on Snowshoe one year when we took wives/girlfriends and had a great time. Beautiful cabin. Fishing was average but it was our first year and we might do better now. http://www.walstenoutposts.com/mandi.htmI will say, we had MICE like crazy at the Walsten outpost and rarely have mice at the Slate Falls outposts. However, like I said, it's been a long time. I don't think you can beat the fishing going with either Red Pine"
1082160,Old Timer,2009-02-19 10:09:00,255,Email me through WC. I have some ideas. Been doing this gig for a long time.
1082183,Dan G,2009-02-19 11:37:00,31,Hi There:Try Northern Outposts. They are very good people and will take excellent care of you. Regarding wall hanger.....take a good camera....take a picture of it...and have a replica made. That trophy fish has lived a good long life and deserves to live even longer. Release it and have the replica made. You will never regret that decision. I have my replica and am very happy to know that the one I caught is still swmmin'.
1082195,Guest,2009-02-19 11:59:00,0,"Take a look at Tetu Island Lodge. My wife calls it ""Fantasy Island."" great cabins, food, and staff, and plenty of big walleyes, and a lot of interesting water to fish."
1082216,PowerClown,2009-02-19 14:51:00,32,check out www.slatefallsoutposts.com
1082240,Guest,2009-02-19 16:18:00,0,"Try any of the Halley's camps on English River system. Some are fly-in and you can also drive to others. They have both types of plans and the people are great for customer service. If you want to have a boat in trip to a private island spot on Lake of the woods, email me at [email protected] or call me at 807-468-3624 ask for aggie good luck on picking a place."
1082437,SSA,2009-02-20 11:44:00,19,"Tetu is a fine place. I would also look at Oak Lake Lodge if you want a fly in American Plan type trip. Heard good things about both places. If going for fly in outpost, acouple outfits are offering husband wife discounts so be sure to shop around. Budds Gunisao I think would be my number one pick from what your looking at but costs are high."
1082686,GBS,2009-02-21 16:34:00,2271,"You might consider Grass River Lodge, ""near"" Flin Flon in Manitoba. Ike Innes and his wife run a fantastic spot. Yes, it is a ""drive to"" lake, which may put some immediately off - but it is a full days drive (450 mi) from Winnipeg straight north, so no day trippers there. His is only one of two resorts on the large lake, and I don't believe the other is even in operation any more. There is no where else to stay except a small campground within 75 miles. Very remote, and no one else there except the lodge guests. Northern, walleye and lake trout. Really nice full service resort, and he will fly you and a guide out on day trips to many different out lakes for specific kinds of fishing whenever you desire. We caught many, many northerns over 45"" DAILY. Her largest was 49.5"", Mine was 51"". Walleye were all over 26"". Flew out to a lake where I personally broke the 100 fish per day count in walleye. None under 26"". Most 28-29.5. Guide apologized for the really bad day - he had been catching many over 30"" on every trip, but we weren't able to break that mark that day. Not an economy lodge, but not the most expensive. And you save a lot by driving. No maximum luggage limit, either!"
1082731,10lbeye,2009-02-21 20:05:00,61,I would highly recommend Esnagi lake( www.northtoadventure.com). Fantastic accomodations and food is outstanding. Took my wife there twice and it met her test for cleanliness. Great walleye fishing--lots of numbers and some good size too. Monster pike as well. Can't wait to go back someday. It was the perfect camp for a couples trip.
1082763,Bigfishhunter,2009-02-22 07:20:00,803,"Grass River Lodge on Reed Lake is very nice. I love fishing reed, world class Lake Trout, Walleye, and Northern all in one shot. The owners name is Ike and Liz Enns. You may also want to check out Ikes son Curt Enns' Lodge Kississing Lake Lodge - here you will be flown in. Now there is a road to Kississing but we are talking almost 80 miles of logging roads that are very rough. This is a top notch facility with amazing fishing. The probably specialize in the big pike more than the big walleye though. Walleye's are found more in numbers here. This is why I mentioned Gunnisao, it is simply an amazing Walleye fishery for both size and numbers."
1082888,nictye1,2009-02-22 16:36:00,13,"I am now looking at three finalists being Grass lake by Flin Flon, Totem (Wiley) on LOTW and Gunisao. Looked closely at Gunisao last year but found it to be costly..Over $5K us. Most likely could end up on Wiley point as I can drive in and looks like I can find what I am looking for. Any reason to be concerned with boat traffic there around Totem on LOTW do you think? ...Still looking in to Grass Lake a bit more."
1082025,nictye1,2009-02-18 16:51:00,13,"My wife is turning 40 this year and we would like to do a Canada fly-in to celebrate her birthday which is a beautiful thing . The thing is that we would like something with nice accommodations, american plan, etc.. We are from MN and do a fair amount of fishing so we would like to find a place with some seriously good Walleye fishing affording us the opportunity to catch lots of fish while still having the chance of getting a wall hanger. Does anyone have any recommendations? Thanks all, I appreciate your help. Todd"
1082033,Golden Eagle,2009-02-18 17:26:00,2642,"I know of some great camps, but they're C & R on large walleyes. None for the wall."
1082034,nictye1,2009-02-18 17:29:00,13,"By saying ""wall hanger"" I just meaning large fish. I understand that they are all C & R."
1082053,walleyeduran,2009-02-18 18:26:00,286,"Check out Silver Water Wheel lodge, www.sww-lodge.com (drive to lodge on Lac Seul) I have never been there but everbody responding on this board has very good comments about the lodge. I checked into this lodge 13 yrs. ago for a trip after my wife and I got married, but the price was a little more than we could afford. They are supposed to have complete American plans with guides available to put you on fish and I think you can either rent one of their boats or bring your own if you are more comfortable with that. Good luck, Duran"
1082072,Golden Eagle,2009-02-18 20:15:00,2642,"Angler's Kingdom on Nungesser Lake and Totem Lodge on LOTW are two I've tried and they produce large walleyes. Food is excellent at AK and great at Totem. I would use a guide every day at Totem and maybe a day or two at AK.Enjoy yourselves where ever you go and good luck.Whoops, need to edit. AK is a boat in and Totem is a drive in. Don't know of a good fly in that meets all your requirements."
1082074,Bigfishhunter,2009-02-18 20:37:00,803,"Budds Gunisao Lake Lodge. This is the answer to your question. I have been in the industry for 10 years. These guys are considered competition and so for me to plug them takes a lot. However I know that their product is good. Ultimately the tourism industry is all in it together. The lodges that I have worked at and managed may beat these guys in the pike and trout category but nobody comes close to their walleye fishing. It is the norm to catch 5-6 pounders there. 28"" + fish are caught by the dozens almost daily. I think there website is buddsgunisaolakelodge.com"
1082117,lobo1,2009-02-19 06:43:00,734,"Todd - The sky is the limit. Did you have a budget in mind? Some of these places, as I am sure you are aware, can be thousands per person. Did you want to stay in Ontario or is it open to Manitoba etc. Is the float plane ride a must?"
1082135,nictye1,2009-02-19 08:16:00,13,"Wallhanger, Budget would be somewhere in the $2K per person area I suppose as this is one of those special occasions, Ontario vs. Manitoba is not really a big deal - no preference.The float plane is not a show stopper if I can get to some great fishing by a boat or drive-in."
1082136,lobo1,2009-02-19 08:26:00,734,www.oldpost.com will get you there within your budget. I been several times and took my wife last year - just the two of us.This place will do as much or as little as you like - they will totally ignore you for a week or baby you and put a minnow on your jig! or anything in between - your choice. I would grab a guide for a day or two and mark up a GPS with trails and waypoints and then you will have the place to yourself. We only saw one boat in 4 days on the water last year had about 1000 islands to pick from for secluded - shore lunch etc.place is very clean - my wife is VERY particular and she was very comfortable here.there are tons of other places too but this is my choice!lobo1feel free to email me for more info you like.
