I don't know much about the process, but if he hasn't been in any trouble since then, it shouldn't be a problem. I don't know if an expungement completely clears your record, but it's a good place to start. Good luck - Stu"
1057930,evy TN,2008-09-29 12:13:00,15,I got a buddy wanting to come up fishing who has a felony from 20 yrs ago. How far do they look back. Do you have to prove rehabilitation or just send money to the queen and hope she gives you the all clear?

1070058,Guest,2008-12-24 12:45:00,0,There are some in Canada that would love to export felons for certain crimes. Our neighbour to the south is fussy as well as to who gets into their country. Most Felons especially ones with drug convictions are excluded for life. So we couldn't export there. Siberia comes to mind. They don't need fences there.

1076209,Dan G,2009-01-26 14:52:00,31,"I highly recommend you look at this site: www.bordercrossing.caThis is a firm that helps people get the temporary permits to travel into Canada. Many times they can get you permanent relief from old felonies. They should be able to tell you whether or not your friend still may have an issue crossing. Their email address is: [email protected] Again, it truly does depend on the felony, and whether or not there have been any other offences over the years. But, they will clarify better than myself, or anyone else here at Walleye Central. Check them out!Good fishin'"
