1141335,squirt,2009-10-10 18:57:00,3,"Rob,I have been fishing at Andy Myers for 16 years on Eagle, two weeks consecutively each year. Before that, when I was in college, I fished at Eagle Lake Lodge for 7 years. I can tell you first hand that Andy Myers Lodge, just as everyone has said, is first class all the way. There is no comparison for accommodations, guide quality, or service from the entire staff. I usually fish in late June/early July, so I can't speak for August patterns, but the lodge is all about putting you on fish. If you tell them you are having trouble or are new, they will go the extra mile. If you stay quite and don't say anything, they can't read your mind. Ask, and you will receive. I would definitely get a guide for at least half your trip if you are new to the lake. They are all good. The only thing that can dampen the fishing is Mother Nature. That is why I go for two weeks. Prepare of all types of weather. There are years when the weather is great, and years where the weather is not. Most of the fish don't really care, as long as the weather does not threaten your safety. Have a great trip, and learn what you can from the guides. It probably took me 5 years (10 weeks on the lake) to figure out how to pattern fish on Eagle. If you keep on Eagle, you will learn to enjoy the lake.Squirt"
1141363,muskihntr,2009-10-10 21:47:00,1,"Ive been going to AML for over 10-12 years and i can tell you that unlike other places i fish Eagle Lake continues to get better and better each year. I am primarily there or i should say was drawn there years ago for the trophy musky fishing, however each year i find myself walleye fishing more and more. The walleye fishery has excelled the last few years and has been awesome! The walleye population has exploded with multiple year classes from eaters to trophys in the last 6 years or so. It truely has become a world class fishery, its just not the same lake as it was 10-15 ys ago. just take a look at how many pics of big walleyes on the AML website. 50-100+ fish days are common with many fish 20-28"" besides eaters. Danny Herbeck has 80 some walleyes this season over 30"" in his boat. Aside from the fishing I personally dont think there is a better choice of camp on the lake, the instructors, and guides in camp work hard to keep people on fish throughout your stay! whether you are there to be guided or not there is always someone to get you headed in the right direction or Herbie and Danny are always around to mark maps up for ya. You cant go wrong with a trip to Andy Meyers Lodge."
1141367,Illinois fisherman,2009-10-10 23:05:00,9,Went there on a father and son trip it was unbelievable for my son. We took the fly out and the 4 wheel trip and we were wore out catching walleye and pike. The only thing I was not ready for was all the out of pocket gas expeince with the guides and if you use their boats youare charged a full tank of gas even if you use half. But now I know about the charge it would not be a scare at the end of the week when I get the bill. Still a #1 fishing lodge andthey know how to fish.
1141446,stevie,2009-10-11 12:30:00,21,"steve here from AML. i'm not a regular visitor to this forum but it seems to be a good and honest source of reliable information. a guest e-mailed me and told me about the on going thread ,thought i'd give some. this isn't going to be an advertisement or defense because i'm totally confident in our services and quality of fishing as the past 1-3 seasons with the economic situation we are all facing and most resorts/lodges down 10-50% some not even open we have had consecutive record seasons so that tells me we have what our guests want in both services,accom.,quality and diversity of fishing opportunities,and keep coming back for and we strive to improve on them all yearly. to illinois fisherman, it was great having you and your son with us,his excitement and enthusiasm was great and we look forward to seeing you again however i wanted to explain the gas situation as you are mistaken or did not understand. depending upon which pkg a guest selects you are allowed from 18 to 36 gals of gas as part of that pkg. daily the gas used whether it's your boat,our boat OR a guide boat what is used or asked to be filled is recorded on your dock sheets and what is used over and above your allottment at weeks end is what you are charged for. you are not charged for a tank of gas on a guide date only what is used goes against your allotment. same with bait. even if you bring your own boat you still recieve gas and bait allowed in your pkg. and no dock,elect,ice,or fish processing fees. now the fishing; if you are thinking of eagle as 20,15,even 10 yrs ago,forget it.period Eagle lake has one of the most diverse fisheries and multi dimensional ecosystems in nw ontario with all five gamefish species walleye,pike,muskie,smallmouth bass,and lake trout as well as perch and whitefish with the options of fishing from gin clear to coffee colored water and rocks to slop and everything in between within boating distance on any given day. this gives the angler multiple options to key in on seasonal movement and patterns as well as beat or move according to weather and enviromental changes. i have fished the lake for close to 30yrs and have owned and guided at AML for 15 and what i can confidently and excitably tell you is the good old days of fishing eagle for all species but particularly and especially when it comes to walleyes was not 20 yrs ago or in gramps day, IT IS NOW AND COMING!!! i must commend the MNR for installing the intelligent slot of 18-23"" and 2-4 possession limits but even more importantly is the avg. fisherman in the last especially 4-8 yrs has become much more conservation minded and have embraced our camp policys installed 10 yrs ago of voluntarily releasing all walleyes and pike over the slot,c/r on bass,c/r on all trout over 6#,and c/r on all muskys over the min. 54"" size limit unless it is a potential world record.most reputable opertions have recently also installed some of the same policys so essentially 90%+ of all over slot fish are being released to reproduce. it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why a lake that is as fertile with superb genetics as eagle has literally exploded in the past 4-6 yrs. besides the large numbers of slot fish and over 18-30""+ there are huge numbers of diff years classes from 10-18"" coming up with multiple consecutive success full spawns so the future looks to be even better coming up and continuing on . much of the lake is relativley clear with incredible forage bases so you do need to brush up on and refine finesse presentations but do so and 50-100+ fish days are common with many fish 20-28"" and the 30""+ potential on any given day as well as plenty of 14-17"" for the frying pan. thanks much and good fish'n to all regardless of where you wet your line. steve herbeck AML"
1170537,stevie,2010-02-20 09:21:00,21,"glenman, just wanted to clear this point because i can't tell you how many times at shows,phone calls,or e-mails and get asked if we do bus trips. back in the 70's and 80's when AML was run by the guercio family you are right it was a bus trip camp. we have operated it since 1994 and do not do bus trips,we are a drive in facility with full service and a high priority on individual service,providing our guests with the best guides and equipment if they need it,and a bit diff formatt than most with an emphasis on providing the best and latest fishing information available with seminars available to attend in the pm and daily updates. while bus trips have thier merits with some groups we just found that the majority of our guests who did them and wished to return loved the lake and facility but prefered to drive themselves rather than deal with the long bus ride and frequent stops,interaction on the bus with people some who wanted to party and some who didn't,little or no flexiblity to take a drive into town or see the area,no option to do thier own hskpg if that was thier choice of pkg,limitations on equip.,and many of our guests do like to bring thier own boats,etc. diff strokes for diff folks and just the route we elected to take,for those that like that kind of trip there are several on eagle in the central section and 1 i know of on lowds that do a good job. regardless of how you get there eagle lakes fishery is excellent,diverse,and has exploded in recent years. steve aml"

1141449,jpknud,2009-10-11 12:49:00,1,"I've been going to AML now for 6 years and went twice this year. First off, Eagle and the NW Ontario area brings me back just by itself. I could never catch a fish and I would still love the time spent up there. Love the area, people are great. I've fished alone, with my dad, with my kids and with a buddy just for muskies. I always been on fish and that's because the AML folks have put me on them. Like Steve said, it is an incredibly diverse fishery which is a blessing and a curse. You need to know how to adapt but every type of condition is there for a successful day whether its clear water and bluebird skies to chocolate milk and monsoon conditions. I've caught every species in Eagle and lots of them and that's because the AML guides know how/where/when to get you on the fish no matter what the conditions.As far as the camp itself, top notch. Wonderful people, you simply cannot go wrong. Every price range is available. I personally guide as much as possible to keep my kids on the best spots always and they always get me home safe in the evening and that's not a small thing on a big lake like Eagle, especially this time of year. Everything Steve says is true, Eagle's best days are just starting, this last week I was there I've never seen so many 42""-48"" muskies in my life. Group from NY came in mid week, never been there, and caught a 32"" walleye and 6# smallies on the first day. I'm pretty sure they'll be back and more sure they'd come back to AML. Heaven on earth to me.Almost forgot, walleyes specifically. It has been tough there in the past but slot limits have really helped. Weeds, rocks, reefs, breaks, you name it they are there. Get a guide for a day or two to show you some of the best spots and techniques and you will have no problem filling limits and many days will be 80+ fish. As you can tell, I prefer AML's guides with Danny being tops for walleyes. He will find them and the AML guys are great about telling their guests where and how to go to get 'em.John"
1141709,Guest,2009-10-12 17:08:00,0,"Hey Rob, I have stayed at AML about 40 weeks (give or take a few) in the past 11-12 years and let me tell you I will never go to another lodge or even consider staying at another no matter how cheap it may be. Herbie runs a class act and the number of repeat customers speaks for itself... In the past 6-8 years fishing has taken off like a shooting star for all species of fish. Unlike fly-ins to most remote lakes in Ontario, Eagle lake offers awesome chances at trophy fish of ALL five major game fish species. If you want to do a fly-in for a day - it can be done, if you want to go on a 4x4 trip guided to a remote lake - it can be done, if you want to portage to a lake and catch white fish and lake trout till you arms fall off - it can be done; and this is only scratching the surface. The main reason I go back is Eagle, I live to fish that lake. JW"
1141850,ROBBY,2009-10-13 08:56:00,20,Thanks to everyone who responded including Steve. We were just concerned that with such a big lake we would have a hard time finding fish. Sounds like everyone there is helpful and that finding the fish shouldn't be a problem. We are really looking forward to next year and Andy Myers Lodge.
1142162,Guest,2009-10-14 16:38:00,0,"We have been going to Andy Myers Lodge the 1st week of August for the last 5 years. We have had groups of 16, 10, 8, 9 & 17. We have brought home our limit of 4 walleyes per person each year. Also we eat lots of fish at our own fish fry each night. We do not keep any walleyes in the slot (18"" - 23"") or any over the slot. Only exceptions being a 32"" and 34"" that were turned into beautiful mounts. The fishing gets better and better each year. I went to other Ontario lakes from 1985 - 2004 and never caught as many 24""+ walleyes as I do on Eagle. I caught 9 myself over 24"" this year in one week. I should preface that by saying that I did not go with a guide this year. I had my own boat (16' Alumacraft with 40HP motor) and went after them myself. If you have the money to hire a guide, you might catch that many in 1 day. The guides are that good. A GPS and a good depth finder will help your success. If you are not locating fish, consider trying a different spot. It is hard to catch fish that are not there. There are numerous under water sunken humps, points, islands, and shore lines to explore. Most hazards are clearly marked in the heavily traveled areas. Best advice I can give you is ask if you have questions and listen to the advice you are given. They cannot help you, if you do not ask. You will be amazed at the copperation and extra effort that you will receive. Good luck!"
1146422,HEMIPOWER,2009-11-04 18:45:00,1,"I had been fishing the Canadian side of the Lake of the Woods for the past 10-15 years with the same group of guys sometimes twice a year. The place we were staying at never provided us with any useful fishing information and we were looking for a new place to try. After hours of looking for a new place to go, we decided to give AML a try. The thing that sold me on giving AML a try was the fact that they seemed very willing to help you get on the fish. I have to admit I was a bit skeptical at first but Steve and the staff at AML quickly proved that they were going to make sure you caught fish. We stayed at AML for a week this past August and we had a blast. We caught more big walleyes in a week fishing Eagle Lake than we caught on all the trips fishing Lake of the Woods combined! 3 out of 4 of the guys in my boat caught their biggest walleyes ever on this trip! I would recommend getting a guide for at least 1 day to show you around a little and to show you the ""local"" techniques and current fish patterns. We considered ourselves pretty good fisherman but having a guide on one of the first days on the lake will save you hours (if not a couple days) of trying to figure out the best ways to catch fish there. I highly recommend Danny for a walleye guide. I would have say couple of things that will make or break your trip to Eagle Lake would be A.) Good information (you will get that from Steve and all of his guides) B.) Using the right bait (Steve will make sure you have that available to you as well). When we were there you big minnows worked the best and AML has the available for you right at the dock. I can honestly say without the help of Steve and his staff we would have caught fish, but not nearly as many, and not nearly as many big fish. This is truly a fishing camp Steve makes sure everyone on his staff is willing to help you out. Every night when we came in Steve and other members of his staff asked us how our day went, and provided suggestions to make the next day even better by sharing information from other guests and the guides. We also took the camp boats to adjoining lake (Clearwater) and our entire group caught our limit of Lake trout to take home that day. Most of us had never even fished for them before! We spent the majority of our time chasing walleyes but did catch Pike and Musky as well. This is great place to stay and being surrounded by people who truly want you to have successful trip makes the trip allot of fun."
1138892,ROBBY,2009-09-28 14:05:00,20,My group is going to andy myers lodge next august and I am wondering if anyone out there has any experience with that camp on eagle lake. We have been going on fly in trips for the past twenty years and want to try something different. Any info would be helpfull.
1138907,lonewolf73,2009-09-28 14:54:00,17,"Robby,Check out this website: Fishinginfo.comOn the left side go to fishing reports and then Canada. Once you get there if you scroll down you will see a link for reports for Eagle Lake from Andy Meyers Lodge. From everything that I have read it looks like a first class operation. It has been featured numerous times on TV on John Gillespie's Woods and Waters.Hope this helps! Lonewolf"
1139009,Glenman12,2009-09-28 20:43:00,762,"Back in the day, didnt Andy Meyers have a bus like Temple Bay Lodge?"
1139071,KSauers,2009-09-29 09:26:00,385,Check the message board on the AML website. The camp is about fishing. If you are diehard fisherman go there. Great bunch of guys from the owner to the dock boys.
1139120,ROBBY,2009-09-29 13:14:00,20,We are definately looking for a fishing camp not a resort. We like to fish during day and play cards and drink some beers at night.
1139146,2746,2009-09-29 14:51:00,3206,"I have not stayed at Meyers Lodge but have been there. Our group fished Eagle twice a year for a number of years until about 6 years ago when we started to go to Gullrock and Lac Seul. Prior to that we did several fly ins but then wanted to use our own boats. As someone else said, Meyers is a die hard group of fishermen. You'll have a couple of seminars/meetings during the week pointing out locations and patterns and Eagle is a decent lake to fish. Like many Ontario lakes it's improved greatly over the years with the slot limits. It's a big lake and your likely going to see a lot more fishermen than your used to on a fly in and, depending on where you flew in, the fishing could require more effort. You said you wanted a change and this will certainly be different than a fly in...."
1140567,Guest,2009-10-07 04:53:00,0,"Are you the Robby from Ottawa that went to Chimo a few years ago? When you have a chance, I'd like to compare notes and hear about your experiences at other camps. In the meantime, I'll double check but I may have some info for you on Andy Meyers."
1140861,ROBBY,2009-10-08 11:24:00,20,Yes that's me. We have been going to north of 51 outposts out of pickle lake for the last three years and they have been wonderfull. Fishing has been grreat. We have one of our guys that just had a heart attack and can't go on another fly in so we are trying something different next year.
1140961,Guest,2009-10-08 21:01:00,0,"If you are targeting walleye, it won't even come close to your previous trips. Better places fo for the eyes without flying. Let us know what you think after the trip."
1141071,ROBBY,2009-10-09 11:53:00,20,Give me a clue.
