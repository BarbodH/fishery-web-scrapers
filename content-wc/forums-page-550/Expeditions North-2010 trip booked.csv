I also stop at the Cabelas in Dundee. I only live about 1-mile from the Bass Pro.Good luck on your trip this year.Regards,Rob"

It""s a Friday to Friday fly-in 7/9/-7/16 and we talked David into providing the supper meal at a nominal cost. It looks like good fishing and a all around plush deal. Posts are kind of slow this time of year so I thought I would share the excitement of another years trip. Seanik"

1161195,retire55,2010-01-18 14:38:00,1029,Congratulations Jerry. I know part of the fun of these annual trips we take is to finally make the decision and send the deposit. I'll look forward to reading a trip report. Have a great trip!!

1161418,Seanik,2010-01-19 09:46:00,218,"Hi Jay, We made a decision last Nov. to go to Lake Nagagami but the question was which outfitter. Their rates were very close and both have great accomodations and locations. What tipped the scale to Exp. North was a sauna and electric start motors. Our group is all retired older guys and a hot sauna at the end of the day and not having to pull start motors made for a quick and early decision. We haven't been on a fishing trip to Ontario for quite a few years , always Quebec because of the distance advantage, maybe a late Aug. trip to the Gouin and Nemio's. On the way to Hornepayne we plan a stop at Cabelas in Dundee, Mi, got to get some half wave spoons and Gulp alive, always need more stuff. It's true much of the excitement and pleasure of a fishing trip is the research, planning, anticipation and having everything come together. Seanik"

1162608,Guest,2010-01-23 14:01:00,0,I hope you made the right choice because were flying in the day your leaving.July 16 to 23. David and the others on this sight talked it up so much we had to go and try it out for our selfs. Good luck and hope to meet you at the dock. Fred
1162617,Mich_Fisherman,2010-01-23 14:43:00,292,"Redear, if your group has a week like we had last year, or even half as good, you will be chomping at the bit to do it again.... We re-booked immediatly for 2010 and are contemplating a second trip in the fall (depending on the boss )."
1169461,adempsey,2010-02-16 11:41:00,963,I am very close to finalizing a trip there myself. The week prior to yours - but that might change. How did you manage to convince him to provide you meals?
