1165108,Guest,2010-02-01 12:03:00,0,"ya onaman river resort is second to none i have been going for the past 10 yrs and its a great place to fish we wake up every morning and fish a different lake for a different species, i go with guys that have be going there for 45 yrs so we know all the lakes and find some too, like they say that northwind is excellent for numbers and the pickerel arent blue just look that way, onaman is the best lake for numbers and size its simply amazing, and savage or savas is simply getting hammered too much and the small pond is slowly getting fished out, but in all weewillie our group havent fished in like 8 yrs and yes toronto and jackfish are great spots but quite a aways away.... i hope to see some of ya in the old waterways as ill be up there in end of june gd luk my pals"
1165120,sptrix,2010-02-01 12:41:00,175,What have your experiences been for pike fishing on Nipigon?
1165391,PIKEMAN330,2010-02-02 11:30:00,101,"We have stayed at Onaman River Resort two times.(07 and 08),I think. I love it there.We went the first time in August. Caught lots of Walleyes in the river right at camp.We caught lots of nice Pike,32 to38 inches on back lakes and also lots of Walleyes.Second trip was the last week of May. Spring was late so the fishing was just taking off,our last day there. We caught tons of Pike on Nipigon just at the mouth of Onaman River in very shallow water. We never saw another boat on the back lakes and just one or two on Nipigon. I have been going to Canada for 47 years and this camp is one of the best.T he owner and his Dad are great guys ,that really do a great job.My next trip will be back there. Good fishing,Pikeman"
1168735,Guest,2010-02-13 21:32:00,0,"Went there for the first week of July this year. Caught brookies to 25 inches, pike to 45, and roughly 1500 walleyes for five of us in six days - no BS. Biggest walleye was 30 inches. Northwind was 150-200 walleyes per day (per boat) when we were there. It has gold, black and blue walleyes in it - weird and cool. Onaman Lake is worth the walk in for at least one day as the fish average 3-5 lbs and lots of them. Lots of walleyes right in the Onaman River, too. Pike fishing was good for us at the river mouth and the bay to the south. Also, bigger fish (pike) were out around the islands as we fished for the brookies. Don't bother bringing live bait - bring twister tails and Berkley Gulp!. BRING BUG SPRAY!"
1169044,northernbite,2010-02-15 07:01:00,1186,"Pikeman330,How are you wintering? Went there last year for a couple of days, had some real bad weather so we didn't get the action we were looking for. The charter wasn't catch any trout either. Will go back again some day. I think I still have your number, I'll call some day.Paul"

562495,Larry S,2006-12-30 08:45:00,666,Has anyone stayed here or fished the northern part of Lake Nipigon Would appreciate any information anyone can give me Larry S
562499,Guest,2006-12-30 10:35:00,0,"I have not fished it or stayed there. From what I have been told about Nipigon, it is a great lake trout water (there are a number of charter boats that exclusively fish lake trout). You will also find some very big pike. I have not heard much about walleye... or know of anyone that has targeted Nipigon for walleye. Nipigon is also known for having some streams connected to it for good brook trout fishing. All the best, Greg"
562506,bellbuoy,2006-12-31 07:48:00,490,"I was looking at this place and sent them an e-mail last spring and another one this fall, no response to either e-mail. Bellbuoy"
562508,Larry S,2006-12-31 10:08:00,666,We are going there in June for 5 days after a fly-in to North Caribou Lake Larry S
562515,toby,2006-12-31 20:42:00,49,"I would highly recommend the Onaman River resort. The trophy lake trout fishing is second to none. Trophy brook trout are a daily occurance on lake nipigon. Not many lakes can support brook trout. On our first trip we caught and released 140 walleyes over 18"" in 4 hours. The camp is clean and inexpensive with improvements every year. Stay away from Pasha lake as Cap't Bob is a total jerk. The owners at onamon river are super nice people and are very accomodating. There web site is www.onamanriverresort.com"
562525,Larry S,2007-01-02 14:21:00,666,"Toby, When were you at Onaman River Resort, and where did you catch the walleye's? What other lakes there did you fish? Larry S"
562529,toby,2007-01-02 19:41:00,49,"We have fished Toronto, Summit, Goode, Savas, Weewullie, Onaman,and Northwind lakes to name a few. Northwind is unique as it has blue walleyes in it. The premier walleye spot is the Jackfish river on Nipigon"
563412,milton,2007-02-15 21:39:00,15,"Toby, It's Milton. Our group is going back up to Nipigon again this June for 6 days. Staying at OnamanRiver Resort again. Are you going this summer? Milton"
563413,toby,2007-02-16 06:13:00,49,Hi Milton--Hoping to go twice this year--third week of July and June 9 for the walleye opener. See you there.
563433,milton,2007-02-16 21:49:00,15,Good. We will be there June 8-14. Last year wasn't long enough. BTW- Thanks for the Pic. Milton
