1167584,B Werner,2010-02-09 17:59:00,4,"I have a trip booked to Lake Ogascanan last week in May. Can i get advice like what to use, where to fish, etc. Bringing my 19' boat. Troll, cast swimbaits, drift bottom bouncers ? ? Has anyone had recent experiences they care to share ?"
1167637,Mich_Fisherman,2010-02-09 20:32:00,292,Long ride down an unimproved road...take it slow there are some real oil pan busters in the road. No live bait (minnows) although I'm not sure about leeches. Worms are ok.. We went on a 4 day trip...weather blew us off of the lake for 3.5 of those days. We did catch nice pike...never really got into walleyes.
1167919,B Werner,2010-02-10 17:12:00,4,Would you consider going back to Ogascanan again ? Is wind a common problem on this lake ? What time of the year were you there ?
1168184,Guest,2010-02-11 14:47:00,0,"I would not consider going back just because of the great places I've fishing in Ontario that are the same or less of a drive and do allow live bait. The wind was an issue because of the size of the waves and we didn't feel comfortable in the boat. If you're taking your own boat, you should be fine. We went in September. I'm sure that wind is no more of an issue there than any other (relatively small) Canadian lake...we just hit it at the wrong time. I believe that the proprietors of the lodge are Ginny and Brad?? They were very hospitable and did their best to make the stay a memorable one. It just didn't work out for us."
1168206,celticbass1,2010-02-11 16:06:00,67,"I have two suggestions if you must go in May. #1 From my experiences fishing in Canada realize that if you fish in May the fish may be absolutely stacked up but this may mean they are in a relatively small portion of the lake, normally near running water (an inlet or outlet) so the fishing can be rather boring. #2 bring some VERY warm clothing. You may not need it but you may need every stitch of clothing you own just to stay warm. I'm from Michigan and pretty used to cold weather but May in Quebec can be really cold. We once had to wait for ice to break up the third week of May so that we could fly in to our lake. Hope your trip goes well!"
1168875,Guest,2010-02-14 13:31:00,0,"I live in Montreal Quebec and I used to go fishing early in May just like you. I don't any more because fishing is about timing and as far as I am concerned I do not see the point of killing yourself to catch fish. When the water warms up and the fish become active is a far better choice for angling for the elusive walleye. Last year we ventured out on July 7th,2009 and believe it or not I took out group to one spot where there is an inlet and at 10 am we started fishing and in a couple of hours we limitted out with 15 walleye wieghing 24.5 kilos or average size of 3.1 lb. the absolute best I have ever done. It will be cold in May so bring your long johns, you can always take them off. Dress in layers. If you have to catch pike then have fun catching pike! Next time take my advice and go a little later, when good weather is assured ( it never is). From the second week in June through to the second week in July, you are sure to have a good time, fish are active, sun is shinning if overcast all the better walleye are active. I hope you liked what I said. Tight lines! Dollardmikey"

As well, if you're going to haul in your own boat, I'd advise that you make some preparations to prohibit the stones from marring your paint finish. The road isn't that bad at least not any time I drove it. It's probably a 2 hour plus drive from the highway to the camp. Contact Brad and Ginny and request that they mail you a copy of the bathymetric map for the lake - that will give you time to identify potential fishing locations."
1169165,gholtz,2010-02-15 13:50:00,14,were going up there the week of june 20th. if u want we can gameplan together.
