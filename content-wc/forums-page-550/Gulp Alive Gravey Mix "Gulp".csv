I never used Gulp Alive and have some questions that a search here could not answer. Is all Gulp Alive Gravey the same and can the various baits be mixed together without harming their effectivness? If regular Gulp is put into the gravey will it be enhanced and more effective? I also found out that the GA containers leak and I plan on transfering to Glade or Tupperware, any thoughts or suggestions about this. Seanik"
1167699,Mr Ranger,2010-02-10 07:09:00,272,I have been mixing my Gulp Alive which works well. The only thing you will get is some color transfer but not too bad. As far as the leaking it is a real pain. I noticed a few of the pro's do not remove the paper seal and just punch a slit in the middle of the seal to retieve lures. I think this prevents the juice from leaking around the edges. I will try that this spring.

Tupperware might work better. I will have to try that. I also poured out half the gulp gravy and replaced it with water. less stink when it leaks out. It might shorten the shelf life but I dont care."
1168212,keek,2010-02-11 16:19:00,1003,"A solution I have found to storing GULP and the gravy is to use a wide mouth Nalgene water bottle. These bottles are leak proof if you screw the top down until it stops. Guaranteed. I keep a spoon in the bottle too (trim down a spoon if need be). I then can swirl the GULP around and spoon out the one I want. Another option would be to use 6"" plastic tongs or an old school ice cube tong to get the baits out."
1168229,Jimmy Jig,2010-02-11 17:44:00,1905,"Walmart sells a container that is leak-proof. Its the right size. Thay are not sold where the other containers are. They are in a difference dept. They are need the dishes, tea towels, etc. Ask some one for them.... They have a cam-type lock on each end with built-in rubber gasket. Comes in difference sizes. Cutting a hole in the paper gasket that seals the GA will not keep them from leaking in the original container! You can also buy these leak-proof containers at Kohles but they are twice as expensive....."

Of course, combining colors like white with pink will probably produce some color transfer I am sure.Berkley needs to fix these **** containers. It's disgusting considering the cost of the product. Their solution of selling a container to hold the baits is is even more of an insult.I suppose the only upside is that I can combine a bunch of containers into one of my own and save some space."
