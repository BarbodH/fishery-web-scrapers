They are rustic, comfortable with no uninvited guests. We always have something for the the friendly and entertaining camp dogs. If you are doing American Plan, the food is very good; if not, the kitchen area in the cabin works very well.It's about a seven mile trip from the ramp to Camp. That part of Rainy fishes 'small.' There are plenty of island and cuts to get out of the wind. My son's best walleye (27"") and smallmouth came from those waters. Lots of 'eyes over the slot. Northern are everywhere. I had a 40""+ break off on me. We did get get lucky one day and boated 14 walleyes in about a half hour. Send me a PM if you have any more questions.NimstugThe physician can bury his mistakes, but the architect can only advise his clients to plant vines. -F.L. Wright"
