1166802,PJM,2010-02-06 23:37:00,3516,This is interesting and is a quick set of rules if you are going to Canadahttp://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety...tor-1610.htm#g

1167397,alanb,2010-02-09 09:22:00,56,"Something jumped out at me on this website for Operator Competency Requirements near the top of the page; specifically the second (*) item under ""The Regulations apply to non-residents"": * If they operate a pleasure craft that is licensed or registered in Canada (including rented or chartered boats). Did something change with this regulation from last year? I thought there was a several posts about this topic a year ago and this rule applied only if you had your own boat in-country for over 45 days. Now rental boats are part of the requirement? (It should be noted that this website was updated on 1/21/10, the date is at bottom of the page in the lower left corner.) This website further states ""For non-residents, proof of competency can take one of three forms"": * A Canadian-issued pleasure craft operator card. * A completed boat rental safety check-list (for power-driven rental boats). * An operator card or equivalent that meets the requirements of their state or country. Does this mean that resort/camp operators will be providing a rental safety check-list for each boat? Are they going to be proactive and make those renting boats aware of this paperwork requirement, or do we need to make sure we ask if this paper work available? Or is this a case of one government agency giving out different information from another one? If you read the actual regulation on the Dept of Justice website, under PROHIBITIONS (2.1); it allows someone to rent a boat to a non-resident (for less than 45 days) without needing to provide anything for the Operator Competency. If this is the case, it is the responsibility of us non-citizens to meet the requirements of (3) under PROHIBITIONS, which requires everyone to have their passport on their person if they are operating a rental boat. At least for me, I usually leave mine in the cabin to prevent it from getting lost. I know, I should ALWAYS have it on me to identify the dead body - but that is a tangent discussion to the question I have posted and will get us off topic. So, which is it? Should those renting boats provide a rental safety check-list, or are those renting required to have our passport on our person at all times? Thanks for your inputs! Alanb - 97 days until we are on the water in LOTW!"

1167642,Guest,2010-02-09 20:58:00,0,"For many years (20+), I went to Canada...LOW, Sioux Lookout and Lac Seul. Ran into some hard times and lost some fishing partners, so I haven't gone for quite a few years. Now, I'm in a position to go again. For several years, I went to the All Canada show at Pheasant Run and tried to put together a few guys for a trip, all to no avail. With all the hoops, regulations and confusion (from both sides of the border), I've found it impossible to find people willing to go thru the hassles. I give up! When the boy gets out of the army, we'll head to Reelfoot, Kentucky Lake, Minnesota or just to the camper on the Miss."
1167658,Nimstug,2010-02-09 22:07:00,2605,"I have had something of an opposite response. I have put together a trip and have found no resistance to perceived 'obstacles.' Some have had to turn down the trip for monetary / economy reasons-meaning the total cost of the trip as opposed to an item or two, not because they think the regulations are confusing. Basically you need a fishing license, outdoor card (good for three years), passport (good for 10 years) or passport card, and no felonies as defined by Canada. If you are legal to operate a boat in your home state, you are legal to operate a boat north of the border. You order the outdoor card when you buy the license. In '98 on my first trip you didn't need the passport or outdoor card. Everything else is the same as it was back then. I could be wrong but that's how I see it. NimstugI need to get a job......."
1167913,alanb,2010-02-10 16:51:00,56,"Kruger, thanks for your input. It would make the most sense if the lodge/renter of the boat provided you with a check list. Still looking for some feedback from Canadians ""in the know"" on if the checklist or passport on your person is a definite requirement. Thanks, Alan"
1169443,adempsey,2010-02-16 10:24:00,963,"You would think the resort owners were up to date on these regs, but this is definitely not always the case. Sure, they know about the operator card but many have no clue that you don't need one to rent a boat. I live in Ontario and go on weekenders all the time and have encountered this situation a few times already. The resorts that know do provide a checklist. It's not required for you to bring one.So, if you're concerned you can bring a copy of the regulations and can get an example check list (lost the link, sorry - but attached the pdf). These are both provided by the government. Probably best to just call ahead to wherever you are going and sort it out before you get there.I am just going to get the card to avoid any future hassles. I have no clue on the passport. Seems a bit ridiculous to have to carry it around with you. I wouldn't. Maybe a photocopy."
1169548,Bluff,2010-02-16 15:43:00,152,adempsey - thanks for the pdf of the checklist. Our outfitter is insisting that we need the card and that they know nothing about the checklist. I'll send them a copy and hopefully save a few bucks.
1170069,alanb,2010-02-18 14:47:00,56,adempsey - thanks for the pdf post. I see another post is up that this is required to have in a rental boat. I will make sure that I take a copy with to have filled out if one is not provided this year. As for my comment on having a passport on your person to identify the body - if you know the story of my group from 2 years ago you would understand! Alanb
