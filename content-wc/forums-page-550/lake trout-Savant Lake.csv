1166588,rdunk,2010-02-06 07:10:00,20,For the 1st time we are going to do some laker fishing on our trip. Any of you laker guys have some tips on gear and catching them?
1166649,Angler Donny,2010-02-06 12:00:00,11,For fishing lakers. Large silver spoons work great especially the half chartruse half silver 1 0z type Johnson spoon. Big five of Diamons and 1 oz fire tiger daredevil spoons. Bring 50 lb power pro or other braided line.Also uou may try verticle jigging with big spinner baits too. Best wishes luck and a great time.

Good baits are crankbaits, spoons and even flatfish. On sunny days, I prefer something with a lot of flash, so anything with silver seems to work well. On cloudy days I've had better success with chartruese, purple, etc.If you can find them on the bottom, you can really put the hurt on them jigging. I use 1oz - 2oz bucktails (again, white, blue, chartreuse and red seem to be the best colors). If you can tip the jig with a strip of sucker/whitefish belly, it seems to help. Early in the year we find them between 20-50'. Look around structure or in narrows that have substantial depth nearby.Later in the season, you can catch them trolling, either with downriggers, snap weights or inline sinkers. A linecounter reel comes in handy big time because it's easier to dial in the depth after you catch one. I've used as much as 9 oz of weight to get down 75' on 14# mono. I use a musky rod when I try this technique. It's fun, but tiring. Same baits as flat lining tend to work well.You can also anchor on deep structure and dead-bait them. We use a lindy-rig type system with a 1oz - 2 oz egg sinker and a strip of sucker belly. It's really easy, and we've caught them up to 42.5"" this way. In fact, most of our BIG fish (over 35"") have come dead-baiting. Lake trout are not difficult to catch, but they can be challenging to find. When you find them, however, they are PIGS. They eat all the time, in my experience. I can tell you that the first few years I fished for them, I was happy to get a handful in a day. When I finally realized that in paid to really spend time using the electronics to locate fish, our ""luck"" started to change. Typically, we have had our best success fishing deep structure on the windblown side. A lot of times we see clouds of baitfish on the structure. If you can find that scenario, you should be in luck.Last year was the best we have done for numbers. In a week we caught (and released -- with no known casualties) over 340 fish, between the two of us. We also fished a lot of walleyes and pike, which added over 500 additional fish to our totals.Have fun. I really think lake trout is the most fun fish to catch (with all due respect to my fellow walleye anglers). Once you get on them, you'll be hooked.SPTRIX"

If you are there later it is still effected by the weather. Two years ago the ice out was so late that they were all over and not in their usual spots. I caught both of my lake trout (one over 20 lbs) in less than 20 FOW and during the second week of June. However, some of the most valuable information will come from sources in camp. Savant is small and the spots are well known (if the weather, and therefore - the fish, are acting normally) so checking in to see how the usual spots are producing can be a good first indicator."
