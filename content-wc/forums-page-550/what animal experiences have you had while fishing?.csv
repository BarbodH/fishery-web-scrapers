1165559,Angler Donny,2010-02-02 20:32:00,11,Im a bit curious after reading the article on Woodland Carribou and Timber wolves on Nungesser. What kind of animal experiences have our readers had while fishing in the great North American outdoors? Please tell us.
1165574,Hawgeye,2010-02-02 22:05:00,1355,"I had a pretty interesting event happen to me while fishing on the Missouri river. I was fishing with a couple guys on a calm-ish day. I thought I had noticed something in the water coming toward the boat. As it got closer I realized it was a large snake. I ignored it thinking it was just going about it's merry business when after a period of time, I saw something pop up over the transom climbing into the boat. It was a 4' snake! Since I am not real familiar with snakes in that area (we don't have much for snakes except for garter snakes around Fargo) I thought it was a big rattler!!! I grabbed the oar and nervously started to try to push it into the river... Turns out it was a ""bull"" snake. I think that is the one that looks like a rattler. Just was really strange that it wanted to go fishing with us! Eventually I got it out of the boat, cranked up the trolling speed and got away from it...it did continue to follow us for quite some time though...interesting."
1165575,Angler Donny,2010-02-02 22:07:00,11,Could be that the snake was trying to escape the water so he intended to get on the boat.... Nonetheless that is very very very scary!
1165584,tly,2010-02-03 03:03:00,1900,"Snake stories are always good. Was hiking in to a remote beaver pond to fish t###t (is trout a bad word?) wearing waders. As I was passing through some trees a pine snake dropped from a branch and fell across my shoulder. Scared the heck out of me, not knowing what kind it was. Ever since I wondered if it had gone into the waders what I would have done."
1165600,Guest,2010-02-03 05:15:00,0,"We were working a shoreline up at Minaki a few years ago, and saw a cow moose with a young calf in the water when we came around a big rock pile. They were 100' away from us, and really didn't care that we were there or didn't notice us. As the wind drifted us closer the cow decided we were close enough and started swimming toward us, leaving the calf in the shallows. We were mesmorized at her huge size and just kept watching until she got about 10' from the boat. I decided she was close enough and hit the pedal on the trolling motor, unfortunately it happened to be pointed the wrong direction. By the time I finally got the boat reoriented, the stern had swung within an arm reach of her. That's when my fishing partner decided to high-tail it to the front of the boat. We didn't say anything for about 5 minutes after that -- we were simply dumbfounded! Oh yeah, we were so caught up in what was occurring, that we didn't even think about snapping some pictures. Duh?!? Chuck"
1165621,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2010-02-03 06:52:00,629,"Over the past 20+ seasons on LOTW here are a few of my encounters:#1. Black Bear sitting on his butt @ shoreline taking a bath? He orshe was splashing water on itself anyway! (Fish Narrows) #2. Both Moose & Deer swimming from island to island. I have alsowitnessed several Black Bears swimming from place to place.#3. Cub bear in camp during the fall foraging for acorns. It was motherless & tried to make a den. It was in camp for most of the week. Camp dog kept it busy! My wife thought it was socute, that I actually thought she might try to coax it into ourcabin! (Grassy Narrows Lodge/Miles Bay)#4. While in Miles Bay fishing close to shore, 2 Otters but on quitea show, playing on a nearby rock.#5. 2 adult Eagles roosting side-by-side near their nest. I was fortunate enough to get a picture of what I would classify as a ""Picture Post Card"" of the 2. (Basil Channel) #6. A pair of Loons with their 2 young in the same bay as we were,protecting the little ones. Always kept the chicks between them& eventually the chicks road on their parents backs as we have all seen by post cards or other art work.#7. The ever endless antics of the Gulls & Pelicans @ shorelunch, bickering over fish cleanings.#8. A Musky hanging onto a stringer of fish right @ the boat!#9. Watching a mink go up & down the dock from boat to boat stealing minows out of buckets!#10. Multiple lake & river Sturgen jumping & clearing the surface by a foot or two, to get rid of Lamprays & just missing the boat. That says nothing for the surprise they generated!!!!"
1165632,jackd1023,2010-02-03 07:20:00,41,"I was in Minaki Canada and had what looked like a Ferret sitting on a rock point, it was watching us following us around the point. Come to find out it was a Mink.That same trip we watched two bald eagles chasing a seagull, one of the eagles landed in the water next to the seagull attacking it. ( I had no idea that bald eagles could float)"
1165640,lonewolf73,2010-02-03 07:29:00,17,Cedar Lake three years ago....we were drifting over a reef jigging for walleyes and noticed a loon off in the distance. As time passed the loon kept getting closer and closer to us until he ended up about 4 feet off the side of the boat. He seemed to be somewhat tame. We actually were feeding him dead minnows out of the bucket. He hung out with us for a good half hour or more. Managed to get some really good photos out of it too. What a beautiful bird!
1165647,v-bay gord,2010-02-03 07:38:00,3168,"This was not an ""exotic"" encounter but it has always stuck with me for some odd reason. Years ago I was guiding and trying to make it back to camp in a bad storm....high winds & big waves. We didn't have big boats in those days.....I think it was a 16' Alumacraft with a 20hp, but I degress. We came past a point and saw a squirrel ahead in the water swimming like crazy trying to make it back to shore....unfortunately with the wind he was losing ground. I couldn't really manouver, but swing as near to him as I could and sort of held out the net to him. Well, he grabbed a hold and before I knew it he was up the net and into the boat.....sitting on the bench seat next to me. Kind of looked at each other and came to an understanding......just get me to shore was the look he gave me. Well, he rode pretty nice and we did get back to camp where he was the first one to hit the dock. I just thought it was interesting that a wild animal would shed all fear of humans in the situation he was in......but I guess he didn't have much choice!"
1165853,kgeary,2010-02-03 18:35:00,88,WOW very scary story about fishing with a lawyer for a week. I've fished with two of them for a week each June since 2005 Makes dealing with bears childs play by comparison. LOL
1165889,joeman79,2010-02-03 20:01:00,417,"3 years ago while on a Fly-In to Richardson Lake with NWO StevensInk fellow WC'er saw a Wolverine while trolling the shoreline for Pike. He was with another guy and both these guys are Outdoor Experts and have been all the world over hunting and fishing. Even so the rest of our group Intergogated them like they were on Trial for a serious crime. Telling them they saw a giant weasal or a Pine Martin. But they ended up convincing us that that had indeed seen a Wolverine. Does anyone know, are there Wolverines in Ontario??? Very Curious 176 more days till the next Wolverine Look out!"

While it's trying to stay airborne, seagulls are dive bombing it, thinking it's got a fish.The poor thing just looked like it was asking us for help, so we did. There was fishing line attached to the lure, so as it flew down close to the boat, Rick reached out and grabbed the line. The Tern splashed down to rest before it put up a fight to stay away from us....meanwhile, I'm using the net to swoosh seagulls away from the bird and the boat.It poked Rick's hands, but he was able to get her under control while I got the side cutters out. Clip...clip...and she was free. She sat in the water, tired, but didn't stray to far.

1165931,scotttheguide,2010-02-03 22:00:00,73,"Just this past August, I had a couple guys out Musky Fishing and was pulling up the bow trolling motor, it was just about dark, reached down to lock it in place and when I stood up a ""Bat"" flew into the side of my head.That freaked me out! It landed at my feet and started flopping around I about jumped out of the boat. I hate creatures! My guests were laughing there butts off! Gives me the ""Willy's"" still.Had a couple of wolves chase a deer into the water about 50 yards from my boat. We were in a small bay with a sand beach and all of sudden the peace was broken with a loud splash and some thrashing. The wolves saw us and did an about face back into the bush. The deer just stood there and then took off swimming. Smart. The funniest thing about that happening is my guest just asked me 5 minutes before that if I ever see any wolves walking around. I said once in a while but not real often. He said man I would really like to see one and then, bamm, there they were. We all just looked at each other in shock for a few seconds, then I said, ""there, I told you good guides always deliver, now do you want any thing else?"" We busted out laughing so hard.Good times!"
1165936,Nimstug,2010-02-03 22:47:00,2605,"On Eagle Lake, On. my son and I saw a ""beaver"" swimming along so we thought we would follow it with the boat. Turns out what we thought was a beaver was just the head of a bear. It became obvious when he (?) climbed out the water.On another trip, we had to run to the hospital in Dryden to get a crankbait removed from my son's hand. On the way back in the dark we came across a lynx. What a beautiful cat. Imagine a really big house cat pumped up to about 20 psi. HRG will like this one. I was by myself on the Turtle-Flambeau Flowage. The sun was getting low and it was time to go in. As I pulled out of a bay, the bright orange sun was going down but still visible through the trees. Then an eagle swoops down between me and the sun a picks off a fish and climbs. Just seeing that was worth the price of admission. NimstugHere, kitty, kitty, kitty....."

1165969,schandm,2010-02-04 05:43:00,18,"We were on a small lake by Armstrong 2 years ago and had an encounter with a bear. On the drive up from Ohio, we came upon a road killed bull moose that had an antler broken off when it was hit. The boys wanted that velvet covered antler, so we stopped and picked it up, having no idea how to remove the velvet.When we arrived at the outfitters, he suggested we take it in with us and perhaps burn it to remove the velvet. (This does NOT work by the way.) The boys laid it on a rock by the cabin and the sun went to work drying this thing as well as making it pretty rank.The last nite in camp, we drew straws to see who the drivers were for the trip home, and the rest of the crew proceeded to dispose of the remaining beverages. I awoke about 3 AM and told them to go to bed as I was turning off the generator. Everyone went to bed and I was awakened about 4 AM by a noise in the cabin , sounded like someone stumbling around in the dark. I got up and investigated and no one in the cabin so I was going to walkout and use the facilities. Opened the cabin door and looked around the deck and to my right saw a bear licking the grease off the propane grill about 10 feet away. I hurried to close the door and then thought, ""this bear will surely be scared to death of me "" so I grabbed a frying pan hanging by the door (only thing I could think of to use as a weapon) and slowly opened it again. Of course, Mr Bear heard me this time and instead of jumping off the deck, he proceeded to calmly turn and walk back to the steps to get off the deck. In the meantime, I am screaming (Yes, like a little girl) for the guys to get up as there is a bear in close proximity. The others were yelling obscenities at me about ""Yea, right, no f****** bear here. Go back to bed.) because we had been joking about this all week.Now this bear is about 6 feet from me and not in any hurry to leave. He walked down the steps and mosied off about 30 feet, turned, sat down and just kind of looked at me. ( I am not any great physical specimen and I am thinking about how I could not possibly outrun anyone else in camp if the bear decided he was hungry but at least I would have a bit of a headstart.)Well the bear eventually walked of into the bush, and we tried to get back to sleep to no avail. He showed up again right outside my bedroom window at daylight, again looking at me like he was sizing up a fat old morsel. We were able to scare him off again, and no harm done. We found muddy paw prints all over the windows in front and he had torn 2 screens off the windows. He has also put his paws on the door. I can't imagine what would have happened if he had been able to crawl through the window and enter the cabin, because there was only 1 door out of there. Pretty hilarious after it happened, but the adrenaline was sure flowing when that bear walked by me on the deck.Dave"
1166075,wolverine fan,2010-02-04 11:48:00,71,"A few years ago whuile fishing in minaki my dad and i saw a deer jump into the water and start swimming for the other side of the bay maybe 1/2 mile away. No big deal we'd seen it before but then a minute later a pack of 6 large timber wolves were scouring the area the deer jumped in. We got great video footage of them, I had never seen a wolf and didn't know they come in different colors. We continued to fish the shoreline of the bay and lo and behold about 1/2 hr later the pack was trying to pick up the scent of where the deer reentered the woods..man i'm sure glad i wasn't that deer!!If you've ever stayed in minaki with Rob and Jan you'll surely know about the ""friendly"" fox that hangs around their rental houses. I just about #$% my pants when it arrived the first night while i was drinking a cold canadien beverage on the back porch!!!! every day same time, same place.Last one was in minaki also, we almost ran out of gas in our rental boat and barely made it back to i think its northstar village near the bridge. We parked but nobody around and defiitely no gas available. My brother and i took off walking back to the cottage to get a car. On the way back, we crossed the railroad tracks and realized we could save a heck of a alot time following the tracks cause they ran right behind the cabin. We started down and i stopped dead in my tracks and reminded my brother that i was way faster than him and did he want to continue, he was puzzled and i reminded him of the i swear almost 500# black bear we saw croos those tracks on the way into the camp the day before, he suddenly realized what i meant by me being faster than him!!!!!! Needeless to say that extra mile or so was much easier knowing i didn't look like an oversized pork chop walking down the train tracks!!Gotta love canada"

1166219,celticbass1,2010-02-04 18:30:00,67,"In 17 or 18 years of going to northern Ontario we've had some pretty interesting situations and pretty much have seen most of everything that's been posted here with the exception of the Lynx. The scariest situation was about five years ago we were staying at a camp and when we came in the front porch screens were all torn to bits, to be honest we didn't put two and two together and assumed it was probably damage from tree limbs. On about day two of our trip we were all awakened to a bear on the screened in front porch of the cabin. The cabin had two quarter inch thick plexi-glass picture windows so the bear was about 2-3 feet away from us and absolutely did not care that we were there. Four grown men were in our underwear banging on pots and pans, yelling, screaming like school girls, and blowing an air horn for what seemed like an eternity before the bear finally lumbered off through one of the only screens that wasn't ripped. The bear joined us in camp two more times that week and at the mid-week check we told the outfitter so he gave us a large knife and an axe (thanks loads) to defend ourselves. He said he would try to fly a gun in later if he had time but apparently he never had time. The next group that flew in he provided a gun to and two of the guys said they were going to spend there time trying to kill the bear rather than fishing."
1166234,fourize,2010-02-04 19:31:00,287,"A few years ago, my Dad and I were fishing the back end of a lake up in NE Ontario Canada, when we heard a ruckus up in the bush. A few seconds later, a big cow moose and her calf come busting out of the pines and go about 20 ft. into the lake and stop. A few seconds later, out comes a black bear. The bear stops at the shoreline, and just stares down the moose for atlest 5 minutes, then turns around and heads back into the thick bush. The cow and her calf slowly make their way down the shoreline...staying in the water...going about 100 yards and taking their time, then get out of the water, head into the bush and that was the last we seen of them. Apparently the bear must have been after the calf. The lodge owner told us, that bear knew that it didn't have a chance with mama in the water. Bears are exellent swimmers, but are defenseless in the water. Mama moose would had kicked the crap out of him. BTW, we have the whole incident on video. It is something my Dad and I will never forget."
1166242,Chad,2010-02-04 19:56:00,3523,"What, no turkeys? You've seen about everything else. We saw a few getting chased by sheep on Waubay last fall."
1166260,kgeary,2010-02-04 20:44:00,88,That would be really great if you could post that vidoe of the bear chasing the moose. Have witnessed bears hunting moose several times and each time it was a cow with calf. as an aside I've run over bears twice at night. for some reason they seem to swim quite a bit at night. have seen them swimming in the daytime across expanses of over 5 miles. I recall one time more years ago than I really care to recall.??? I was carrying a canoe across a portage. I was walking with the bow low to the ground I heard some noise and tipped the bow up and about 40 feet away was a bear going after a calf moose with the cow fending him off. after getting my heart out of my throat I backed off a bit and watched. each time the bear would come in the cow would kick at him with her front feet. this went on for quite a while and then suddenly the cow got her legs up a bit to high and the bear went in underneath and latch on to her underside like he was climbing a trees. Then his back feet looked like a buzz saw and it was all over in a few seconds. the calf stayed around for as long as I did and the bear never paid any attention to the calf at all. Kind of changed my perspective on things. I've been told and can deduce myself that black bears kill more moose than hunters. Makes me wonder why they stopped the spring bear hunt. My powers of deduction lead me to believe it was to keep the moose population in check. I hadn't noticed the place was being overrun by moose. my apologies but after all sarcasm is a form of humor. LOL Hey I like this thread lots of good stories. thanks kg
1166273,eyemike,2010-02-04 22:32:00,233,"This is a great thread, it brings back alot of memories and smiles. One Day my dad and I were portaging our boat around a dam going into this secluded lake when my dad lets out a yell and about climbs over the top of me. I thought right away that there was a bear! No, on the shore was a fair size snake all coiled up. I got to laughing at him which didn't help things at all. He is scared to death of snakes. I think he would rather have tangled with a bear than any snake. Over the years I have seen alot of animals I will never forget. Two bucks sparring in a stream 20 yards from me. A cow moose walked past me so close I could have touched her. A bald eagle perched on a moose carcuss 20 feet from the boat. A porkupine grunting eyeball to eyeball at me coming out of the fish cleaning house. A ruffed grouse male standing on a stump ""drumming"" away for a date while we fished just a few yards away. A bald eagle taking a walleye that I just released right at the boat. I watched a wolf walk the shoreline while we fished the same shoreline. One foggy morning a pack of wolves were howling on the shore of the lake, you could not see them, it brought the hair up on the back of your neck, very primal. Three otters stole our fish right in front of us one year. I have so many stories... Mike..."

You know when you startle a house cat how it can jump straight up in the air and backward at the same time. Well I saw my buddy do this he was laying on the ice starring down the hole with a coat pulled over his head to block the light... nose inches from the water.... and up pops a muskrat.

1167653,nitroman,2010-02-09 21:41:00,368,"2 years ago fishing on Cedar lake I look down at the water and notice a large musky following our stringer of walleye. I killed the trolling motor to see what it would do. All three of us with our heads over the side of the boat watching and the musky surfaces 3 ft from my head sticks its head out of the water, rolls to get a better look at us then disappears under the surface again. We were dumbfounded never seen a fish break the surface to look at us before. Seen 2 bears chase a Mom and calf into the water mom ditched the calf and took the bears for a run while the calf hunkered down on the shore. We listened to them run around thrashing thru the woods then it got quiet. An hour later we hear a sploosh look over and the mom's back to collect her calf. Many hours last year messing with an otter on the dock they are quite persistent when it comes to trying to steal you bait and stringers! Standing beside the deck last year and had a fox walk out from under just 6 ft from me nearly filled my pants I was talking to my wife on the phone at the time she thought I was lying. Found out later it was a camp pest. Many cool eagle feedings and hours watching them watch us waiting for us to sacrafice a perch to them. Pileated Woodpeckers are also pretty cool to see!"

1167725,oldblue2008,2010-02-10 08:41:00,313,"In 1981 we were at a flyout lake near Wollaston, and were staying in a shack tent. My father woke up one night to see a mouse sitting on his sleeping bag, chewing on something white. So, the chase was on trying to catch this mouse. Finally cornered it in a duffle bag, didn't want to step on it and make a mess, so I swatted the bag with a flashlight. Out flew the mouse and he was gone. Two mornings later, my dad wakes up, and minutes later, is scowling at the rest of us. Pretty soon he says ""ok, who stole my teeth?"" We asked him what the problem was, and he said that he would take his teeth out and wrap them in some toilet paper and put them beside his bunk for the night. Ah ha! That was the white stuff the mouse was chewing on! So, we do a little searching and see a opening under the plywood bunk. Good thing we had a hammer along, as we had to take the bunk apart. Sure enough, there were the teeth, still wrapped in some mouse eaten toilet paper. We all had a good chuckle as my dad did some serious cleaning on his choppers. About 4 years later, at a different flyout near Wollaston, we were again in a shack tent,(I really liked the shack tents, it was pretty much roughing it in those days). First day on the water and we came back to find one of the coolers we had left by the woodpile. We looked up in time to see the bear going over the hill. We lost a lb of butter, and a package of bacon. So, we knew we now had company, and were very careful and kept our eyes open the rest of the week. We always took a shotgun with us into these remote flyouts, as you were on your own for 3-5 days with no way of contacting the outside. Three mornings later, we were just rising, and getting organized. I could hear a blue jay outside raising a ruckus, so I stuck my head out the door to see what the problem was. Coming over the hill was our camp robber, about 100 yards away. I alerted the crew, and one of the guys grabbed the shotgun. We watched as the bear came within about 20 feet, and was growling. we figured that was close enough, so Brian let go with the shotgun. The bear humped up, ran about 50 yards and that was it. After making sure he was dead, we rolled him on a small tarp, and dragged back closer to camp. Brian was an RCMP member who has spent quite a bit of time in the Arctic postings, so set out to skin the bear. It was early June and the hide was still good. We commented on how much the bear carcass looked like a human shape once skinned. After skinning it out, we put the carcass back on the tarp and into the boat, depositing it on the shore about 4 miles south of the camp. It was not something we wanted to do, but the next party in there might not have been so lucky, and come without a gun. Brian ended up trading the hide for a greyling mount. Reading the story about the musky swimming with its head up reminded me of something similar. About 3 years ago, I was shore fishing at Rafferty one evening. I saw something swimmng in the water about 150 feet away. I thought maybe it was a turtle or whatever. About 10 minutes later, I see the same thing coming towards me, about 50 feet out in the water. As it came closer I could see that it was a pike, cruising along with its head out of the water! I estimated it to be about 5lbs, judging by what I could see, which was about 6 inches of head. It swam this way for probably 75 feet. We have had many adventures over the years on our fishing trips in Saskatchewan, and each one brings something special to remember. From these stories, to bears sunning themselves while he watched us fish, moose and their calves, northern lights.etc. Saw a funny looking bear swimming to an island. turns out the cub was riding on the mothers back, but, unfortunately no camera along that day"

We found one great spot that we just kept hammering them (and Ladyfish too) when out of the corner of my eye I see these big dorsal fins pop up out of the water. It turned out to be dolphins that were waiting to snag an easy meal from the Ladyfish we were throwing back. As soon as a fish was released the dolphin would hone in on it and dive down to slam it. Although we missed it, the guide said they usually will surface with the dead fish and come up to the side of the boat and show it off."
1168144,doubleheader,2010-02-11 12:31:00,2652,"In western PA we have a lot of black bears, but almost 30 years ago at my buddies 30th birthday party I had an encounter that was too close for comfort. We had two campsites set-up a couple hundred yards apart. The party was going on at the lower site. Around midnight I took my young lab pup up to the upper site and nestled down in my sleeping bag. I could look out the screen tent window from where I was laying and see a beautiful full moon. Despite the noise from down below I quickly went to sleep. A raccoon trying to get into our cooler, which was just on the other side of this tent window, woke me a short time later. I shagged it away and went back to sleep. The next noise I heard I figured, it's that darn racoon, but I quickly realized the moon in the tent window had been replaced by this black glistening fur. Still, I don't figure it out until a second later when the bear turned and looked right at me, our two faces literally a foot apart. He had gotten into the chicken and he just sat there eating, staring at me, while I tried to figure out what was the best course of action. After a few seconds I grabbed my pup and started to run down to the other camp in my underpants. Of course everyone was partying and totally oblivious to the bear, but the party animals see me coming and one guy yells, ""Hey Fred, there's a bear chasing you"". I covered the last 100 yds in world record time, and when everyone realized there really was a bear up at the other site we all had a great laugh. I once saw an eagle take a brown trout within yards of my boat. Between PA and Canada, I've seen all kinds of critters swimming squirrels, snakes, bears, moose, beavers, otters, deer, and the like. I've heard wolves but I've never seen any. Aren't these experience what life is all about? Makes me feel sorry for the cityfolk."
1168416,Old Timer,2010-02-12 13:10:00,255,I've had a few. Here's one. While smallmouth fishing the BWCA/Quetico we had a bear turn our camp upside down on the Rose/Rat lake portage. The bear was still there when we returned to camp shortly before dark. My dad kept the bear at bay with his paddle while I piled our torn tent and gear into the bottom of the canoe. Then we took off with the bear looking at us from the portage. This was in the 60's.
1166734,MoWalleyeguy,2010-02-06 17:27:00,409,Seen a lot of what has already been mentioned so I thought I would just share a cute picture of a Beaver giving a younger Beaver a Piggyback ride. We were Muskie fishing on LOTW and here they come swimming by.
1166990,slugger doug,2010-02-07 19:33:00,15,"Great reading!!!!!!! This year after camping for 15 years and not having any wild animals come into camp we have become lazy and not put up the food and we had a visitor in camp twice. The first time we were out fishing and when we came back to the camp a bear had gotten into all the food and tore up the cook tent. Thinking we need some type of protection in the tent while sleeping I go to the boat. The camp is 200 yards from the water and the boat and our filet knives. When I get 20 feet from the boat all of a sudden the bear stands up after he hears me and luckily takes off. After cleaning my drawers I grab the fillet knifes and throw the fillets of fish that the bear was munching on into the lake. So the next day we fish some and then take an hour drive to Savant Lake for some bread, eggs and pancake mix. Two days later as we are making a camp fire the bear shows up grunting and smelling our freshly caught filets and wants another dinner. After banging pots and throwing rocks for 20 minutes I finally got the chainsaw and he finally took off. Looking forward to our trip next year with a little less excitement."
1166995,Guest,2010-02-07 20:16:00,0,"Nine years ago at Lac Suel. Our guide just finished making shore lunch and we had sat down with our plates of food. Perhaps a bite or two had been eaten, when a branch snaps behind and to my left. I look down the shoreline and about 6 feet from me is the head of a bear sticking out from the brush. I mention to our guide we have a visitor (how I did calmly I will never know). The guide asks us to be quite, to stand slowly, and walk backwards to the boat. One line I thought was funny was ""don't stare at him, but don't look away either."" For every step we took backwards, the bear took one step forward. How a bear managed to maintain perfect eye contact with three different men standing 4 feet apart I will never know, but we all swore he was staring directly at each us individually. As we backed up, the bear would continue to give a low growl. We backed our way to the boat, and then backed the boat away from shore. The bear proceeded to help himself to our lunch and at one point pick up our Coleman cooler with our bears and carried it around by the handle like my retriever. He never did get it open and we still have the cooler with the bite marks. After he ate the food and licked the pans and sand for the grease, he decided the beach was his and took a nap right were we had shore lunch. A few years later (different guide, but same resort), we landed on a beach for shore lunch, our guide just started to unload the boat, when he ordered us back in. When asked what was up, he said he smelled a bear. One minute later, sure enough a bear steps out of the brush. Now I will never know if he really smelled the bear or heard something (I was next to him the entire time and never heard a thing), but both were pretty neat events. Cheers... IAWalleye"

1167004,MidWestFishman,2010-02-07 20:45:00,44,In 2007 I fished at Dubwant Lake which is part of the Tukto lodge group. I was within 50 feet of a pair of muskox and got great video. While there I also saw a grizzly Bear and a caribou. It is a very remote camp. The first night there the guide handed me a 375 H&H and told me that if anything came through the metal screen door on the huge very solid tent we were in... start shooting.. it would be a grizzly. I slept like a log every night after great fishing 9 hours a day with no incident. Caught a 35 and 28 pound laker while there.
1167104,Guest,2010-02-08 08:29:00,0,Many years ago by Loon Rapids on Lac Seul a friend & I saw a couple of Timber wolfs that cornered a new born moose & it's mother against the shore. The mother moose ran after the wolfs into the woods while the baby moose stay on the shore. about 5 minutes later the baby moose started walking into the woods & that was the last we saw of them. This while we were jigging 75 yards off of shore

Have also seen grouse w/chicks and porcupines at our cabin.Similar to V-Bay Gord's squirrel experience, we had an in-boat encounter with a rabbit.

I grabbed it by the scruff of its neck and dropped him in the boat where he stayed until we got back closer to shore and let him go. Click the video link below.

1166516,kgeary,2010-02-05 19:01:00,88,"As I've read these stories it has reminded me of a lot of great memories. Ed08walleye you are absolutley correct a fishing trip to Canada is about so much more than just great fishing. You will experience things that you simply cannot experience anywhere else. I've often wondered why some people come all the way up here and then when I spot a moose, Caribou, Linx etc they dont' even take a glance. I was feeding an Eagle some fish last summer and the guys with me didn't even turn and look when the Eagle was picking the fish off the water 30 feet from the boat. I suppose it is something that a person grows up with. The more time a person spends with nature the more he/she will appreciate nature. That is why I take Seanna and Hayden out as much as possible. On our blog I have hundreds of photos of fish but almost as many of wildlife and the kids. I've been toying with the idea of an online kids nature show. Should be fun. I guide virtually everyday but can't guide everyone in camp and can't be out all the time so hire some guides. Besides teh obvious talents, and overall friendliness, one of the things I look for in a guide is what understanding and appreciation he has for nature. I know that the majority of my guests really like that in a guide. and I consider it my responsibility to facilitate the best opportunities for them to enjoy the available encounters. ( and believe me there is a huge amount of knowledge and experience that is required to optimise those encounters.) I've attached a photo of a Woodland Caribou swimming not that I'm fixated on Caribou but they are a pretty rare animal. ( as opposed to barrenground, alaska/yukon or Quebec/Labrador Caribou) I have hundreds of photos and stories of all kinds of animals, bird, etc. fun fun fun"

1166547,point12,2010-02-05 21:14:00,95,"I have had a lifetime of fun observing wildlife while fishing. But, the problem is that there is never a camera around when you need one... Here's one adventure when we had a camera - a huge cottonmouth was handily swimming across Bull Shoals Lake, in MO during the big flood of 2008. As we got closer he perked up, turned and came right at us like he wanted on my Ranger. A friend took the camera and I ran the trolling motor to keep a good distance. I had to back away at quite a fast rate and eventually started up the big motor to get away from him. They are very agressive and pesistant. These pics were NOT taken with the lens in telephoto. The little Nikon digital was set to normal lens. I don't think it was a prudent thing to do - but we got some great shots... :-) Enjoy, Al point12"
1166556,SinOrSwim,2010-02-05 22:38:00,1528,"I have to say I literally laughed out loud on some of these.We had a year a long time ago. One of our first years going up. On our 14th or 15th year doing a fly-in now. Flying out of Kenora. Stayed at a little Motel there the night before. I worked nights at the time and was awake at about 4:30 or 5 a.m. Thought I heard some people around one of the buildings so I went to say Hi. Had a pr of shorts and no shoes. Came around the corner and there was a BEAR standing against the dumpster. I RAN through the parking lot screaming BEAAAARRRRR, flew into the room and slammed the door scaring the crap out of the other guys inside.Then that same trip, we had a cabin with a screened in porch. The sliding glass door had a 2x4 to keep it locked. Thought that was odd. Then a few nights into the trip someone heard something. Like an aluminum can getting crinkled. We got up and there was a bear on teh screened in porch. We all had a good laugh and sat around the kitchen table and had a beer. A few minutes later the bear knocked down the screen door to get back onto the porch. 6 grown men flew out of our seats and ran into a bedroom. All of us huddled up looking at each other like wtf do we do now. LOLOL The rest of the trip (no indoor toilet) if someone had to pee at night they would almost whisper....anybody have to pee. You would hear....i do.......yeah i do.....me.....etc. Then all of us would go out on the porch with our flashlights pointing into the woods peeing off the deck. Didn't matter if you were passed out drunk. You would wake up so you wouldn't have to go pee by yourself. Ahhh, good times!"

Remembering to bring a bag of garbage to throw to the bears at the dump so you can get out and unload the rest of the garbage is also quite interesting when there are 20-30 bears waiting. Last fall we saw a lynx swimming between inlands. One of the more memorable events was a bull, cow and calf moose swimming between the inlands near where we were fishing. Watching the same eagles year after year in the same places is also breathtaking. Same with the loons, building a nest in the same area year after year."

1166687,campchick,2010-02-06 14:45:00,96,"This did not happen to me personally, I heard it from a guest of ours. It seems he and his fishing buddy were trolling down the shoreline and noticed a seagull sitting on the ground by the shore. As they approached the seagull, it sprang up and tried to fly away but it only got so far before being jerked back to the ground. Upon closer inspection they could see a hook imbedded in its foot and some fishing line tangled in the bushes nearby. They decided to do their good deed for the day and free the bird. Between the two of them they grabbed the seagull by the legs and one man held it inverted firmly under his arm. The bird immediately quieted down and they removed the hook. Happy ending all round!"
1166729,Guest,2010-02-06 17:14:00,0,"Fishing on Thaddeus lake in late September several years ago, we saw a lynx walking along the shoreline. About 75 yards ahead was a rocky point with about 25 mergansers resting/sleeping. The lynx dissappeared into the woods, we knew what was going to happen so we stayed and kept fishing and watching the ducks. Well it took about twenty minutes but the lynx came charging out of the woods headed for mergansers. I had never seen so many mergansers explode into flight so fast before, they went from sleeping to flying in a nanosecond, an instant cloud of ducks. The lynx ended up shoulder deep in the water, he missed every duck. Coolest thing I have ever seen in Canada."
1166476,kgeary,2010-02-05 16:22:00,88,"SOMEBODY COINCIDENTLY EMAILED ME THIS STORY TODAY. TOO GOOD NOT TO SHARE. We came upon this Cow and Calf on a very small island. As we were taking pictures, the Cow took off in the water towards shore and the calf followed. As we turned the corner of the island, we saw the Cow almost on shore but the calf wasn't even half way to shore yet. All of a sudden, I noticed that the calf wasn't going to make it. As we were heading towards the Calf, it went under a few times. At one point it stopped moving. As we got about 10ft away, it started moving and coming up to surface again. When we got beside it, all I could see was his ears. I grabbed the Calf by the ears to pull it up a bit and then I lifted the Calf right into the boat. The Calf coughed a few times and started breathing. We took a few pics as we rushed to shore to drop it off to Mommy.

All three boats investigate and find a bear swimming from point to point. Of course we are stupid and get close enough to get some really great pictures. We follow along with this bear. As the the bear then gets to shore. He shakes off and with almost a human attitude cusses us out. I am sure in bear talk the four letter words were flying. He postured and grunted and then ran into the woods. It was a great day one for me the first time in a Canadian Camp."

Best story , though, was being greeted at 5 a.m. on the front porch of our cabin at Chamberlain Narrows at Lac Seul by a young black bear. Taking out luggage for pick up (as we were leaving that morning) the bear was on the front steps. After getting him off the steps , we threw firewood at him until we were clear to run up and get the camp hands out of bed to ""deal"" with him."

The audio is hilarious. Screaming like a schoolgirl is a good description. And the calm relaxed look on the Linx face says it all. I literally grew up in the wild. My kids are doing the same and its awesome. My daughter has fed walleye by hand to a wild loon. I've nursed back to health, baby bear, moose, eagles, ducks, loons, etc. I've had a bull moose literally drool on my boots. Cow moose attack me. I've had wolves stalk ME while calling moose. I've had Linx, Wolverine, Bear and Wolves stalk me. I've got pictures of Pine Martin 6 inches away from the camera while hanging on the outside screen of my cabin window waiting for food. have made friends with countless Eagle, have called in owls, had whiskey jacks sit on my shoulder. shared hundreds and hundreds of such experiences with my guest. counted 27 black bears from the doorway of my tent sat in the middle of over 75,000 caribou. I'm sure there are many others that don't come to mind right now. In short I've had a great life. I've shared many of these stories with my guests countless times. I'll share some of those stories in detail as time allows. If I started writing all the stories my dad and my brother have experienced we'd have a book. well this has put a smile on my face Thanks kg"
