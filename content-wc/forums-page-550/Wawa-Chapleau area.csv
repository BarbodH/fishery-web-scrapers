The Wawa-Chapleau area would be great but willing to drive a little further. My wife and I went to Pine Portage Lodge about 10 years ago and had a good time. Any other recommendations? thanks everybody!!!"

1169291,pikemaster,2010-02-15 20:01:00,1,"You might want to save some money on a fly in trip and drive in to fishing thats just as good ,maybe better than some of the fly in trips. I've been going to canada for well over 20 years and the drive in trips produce some of the best fishing opportunities to fish different types of fish.I like the hornepayne area for a chance at some good Walleyes and Pike along with Lakers and even some of the largest smallmouth Bass I've ever caught.If you like nice Perch fishing try the Prov.Park north of Hornepanye up highway 631 off of highway 17 at white river. Good Luck wherever you end up !"

1169426,Kruger,2010-02-16 09:40:00,259,You might look at Pine Portage again. Kabinakagami has been getting better every year. The last 2 years I have had a couple 100 fish days during the week. The average size has been going up also. When I first started going (about 15 years ago) I would say the normal walleye was 14-16 inches. Last year we caught way more fish over 18 than under.
