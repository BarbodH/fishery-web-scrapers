1169831,Pooch,2010-02-17 15:10:00,4619,"A little off subject, but just a thought to share.Every crank bait I buy gets the barbs removed with a Dremel tool before even going into a tackle box. Also, on most cranks I can remove the front set(s) of hooks and it doesn't seem to matter to the fish that the action isn't quite perfect anymore. I can't say I've ever lost any fish because of not having a barb. Darned easier to get out of your hand also!Jigs get the barb pinched as flat as my old hands can get them as I use them. Dice a bunch of old plastic worms and slip a small piece behind your live bait to keep it on. We've proven to each other that the small piece of plastic (and I mean small) seems to act as an attractor and as usual, color does make a difference from day to day and hour to hour.It's hard to believe that a little color half (or less) the size of a pencil eraser can make a difference, but it does. The brightest chartreuse plastic I can find works most all of the time. Especially with a dark leech. Just sharing my experience for any interested.Pooch"
1169976,Kruger,2010-02-18 08:18:00,259,I understand the barbless making it easier to release a fish unharmed. But do that many people actually get hooked themselves? I have been fishing for 45 years and have never got a hook in me past the barb. or for that matter I have never been with anybody who has.
1169998,Pooch,2010-02-18 09:34:00,4619,"Years ago, on our very first full day in Canada my experienced boat partner put a treble hook from a crank bait deep in his little finger. Luckily it was a drive in lake and I drove him 60 miles to Geraldton to get it removed. The bard was caught in the sinew and had to be cut out. Not pretty.My other partner had a niece lose an eye to a hook. Whether the barb removed would have helped is up to speculation.Two years ago I stuck a #2 hook without barb in my hand and was amazed at how hard I had to pull to get it out of the meaty part of my hand. Even barb less. Within a couple days I couldn't tell where the hole was other than it was a little tender.Another friend was on a fly in years ago and walked around the last part of the week with a treble in his belly. They took it out when they got back to base camp.Ran into a Canadian camp owner vacationing in Eleuthera last week and he says it is fairly common throughout the summer. Other camps we have fished have said the same thing.I'm a believer. If you fish long enough the odds are you will get hooked sooner or later. Sometimes it's not too big of a deal, other times it could ruin a trip. Or in the first example above it could alter your life. The Treble in the little finger guy was a helicopter pilot and he had a bum finger for quite a while after they took the hook out. I think he was restricted to doing check flights for awhile before he was allowed to fly full time again. Imagine what would have happened had he had damaged or lost an eye.Just my nickel's worth (again).Pooch"
1170043,AllenW,2010-02-18 12:21:00,11482,"Ask any resort or town close to a popular fishing spot hospital and better chance that they'll just smile and say yes they do get a few.All my Musky baits have had the the barbs bent flat since the mid 80's.Twice I've been on a boat when a bait lodged its self into a person, luckily not me, but both times resulted in time at the local emergecy ward, one while fishing a tournament.It can happen, no matter who you are, bending the barbs back will usually make it easier to remove, whether its the fish or you.I have been bending the barbs on my walleye stuff also, haven't quite convinced myself on the crappie stuff yet though..Al"
1170124,Bill Krejca,2010-02-18 20:37:00,6107,"I've taken 4 out of folks' hands, two of them were 20 minutes apart (not the same guy). Bill Krejca"
1170203,Kruger,2010-02-19 08:00:00,259,And some of you people gave me a hard time about wanting to have a couple beers while I fish?
1170240,AllenW,2010-02-19 09:37:00,11482,"Not sure, but I think drinking in a boat in Canada is probably illegal, I don't believe hooking yourself is...yet That might be the difference..maybe.I'd also probably think most wouldn't care if over the course of a day you had 2 beers, but I also think most of us have heard the remarks, ""but I only had a few"" way to often.Al"
1170254,Kruger,2010-02-19 10:17:00,259,I was wondering if the guys who hook themselves often are maybe having one too many.
1170275,AllenW,2010-02-19 11:07:00,11482,"I'm sure it happens, in my case one was a musky spit a suick and it came back and hit the guy I was with in the face, the other time a northern had a musky bait attached to it and while the guy was trying to get them both out of the net, his grasp on the fish slipped, two treble hooks to the hand and still attached to the fish.Nothing drank them times, but a lot of swear words.But yes, I bet it's caused a few to hook themself...or others Al"
1170573,Bill Krejca,2010-02-20 12:01:00,6107,"My very limited study (4 cases - of hooking, not of beer!) was that the hookup on 3 occurred while getting the hook out of a caught fish. all were hooked on crank baits, 2 pike, 1 walleye. Both pike were small, and they slid down the hand holding them, weren't squeezed tightly enough. The walleye just wiggled/flipped at the wrong time. No beer involved. I make it a practice to first take pliers to any crank bait hanging from any fish before I grab the fish. the folks making the films for TV would do their viewers a favor if they practiced this simple precaution.

1168792,Guest,2010-02-14 07:10:00,0,"I need a clarification on the regulations. Can you have barbless hooks in your posesson, or can you just not be fishing with barbed hooks? I hope I ony have to smash down the barbs on the hooks of the lures I am using."
1168796,Guest,2010-02-14 07:20:00,0,"You can own and posses barbed hooks. You cannot have any barbed hooks tied onto any of your rods while you are fishing in Manitoba. So you are correct, you don't have to mash down the barb until you want ot use that particualr lure or hook."
1168820,LeeMB,2010-02-14 09:16:00,83,Once most of our anglers fish barbless they continue to fish barbless at home. It is a lot easier to release a fish with barbless hooks.
1168830,freespoolin,2010-02-14 10:00:00,472,"Being a life-long Manitoba angler I suggest pinching down the barbs not buying barbless hooks. When you pinch the barbs you're still left with a little ""bump"" on the hook that helps to hold bait. For live minnows, place a small piece of a rubber tail on the hook after putting the minnow on. Even better is to use a one hole punch and punchout some pieces from the plastic used to hold six packs of beer/pop together."
1169040,northernbite,2010-02-15 06:56:00,1186,"I agree with LeeMB, once I started fishing barbless hooks 10 years ago, because of safety in far out regions of Canada, I fish them all of the time. just one big Johnson spoon in hand with barb on could be a trip stopper. I do bend them with pliers and not file. I've had them in my hand twice and they pull right out. I don't see us loosing any more fish because of being barbless. I now insist that anybody in my boat bend there barbs down.i've had enough winter,Paul"
1169064,stumcfar,2010-02-15 08:04:00,451,"Just remember that rods that are not being used must not have barbed hooks on them either. So if you have rods in storage or on the floor and never plan on using them, make sure you have no barbed hooks on them. I fish Buffalo Bay in Manitoba alot. You do lose some fish because of the barbless hooks, especially ice fishing, if you are not carefully near the hole, but you get used to it. We fish alot of shadraps in the summer and nothing better than barbless for that."
1169361,Bill Krejca,2010-02-16 05:59:00,6107,"While fishing Manitoba, I noticed little, if any fish lost due to the bent down barb, and sometimes use them elsewhere. I would caution, however - it is very easy, in the process of several lure changes, to forget to make sure the changed-to bait is barbless. This additional step in bait changing can be overlooked in the process of trying a different color, weight, etc. Bill Krejca"
1169731,Chad,2010-02-17 08:40:00,3523,Bring an empty plano box along and use it to store lures that you have pinched the barbs down on.
1169745,Backwater Eddy,2010-02-17 09:05:00,3871,"In use, they must be pinched back...in the box, not considered to be responsible for them being barb-less. Any tied on a rod....they must be pinched back, even if they are in a locker or case.Hope that helps."
1169794,pike50plus,2010-02-17 12:43:00,584,Have made all my medium to large hardbody baits single barbless too!
