I do not get the opportunity to fish for smallmouth much here in Kansas so we would be after smallies, and anything else. Want great scenery and lots of fishing action. Any suggestion on where to go? My boat is an Alumacraft V-16 with a 40 hp tiller."
1170871,Bigfishhunter,2010-02-21 14:46:00,803,"You really have to check out the Flin Flon/The Pas area. Has everything that you want and much much more. Best scenery and fishing you will ever find in a drive to location. I know it is a bit of a hike, but if you get up here once, you will never go anywhere else, trust me."

The bay has great smallie fishing, and regardless of the wind direction there will always be an inshore place to launch and fish."

I would recommend somewhere from the International Falls, MN area to Atikokan, ON and mix the Smallies with Northern and Walleye fishing. There are tons of areas to camp along with endless fishing opportunities for smallmouth bass."
