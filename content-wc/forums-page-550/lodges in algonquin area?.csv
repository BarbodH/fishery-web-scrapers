1169353,haybay larry,2010-02-16 05:11:00,136,It has been quite a while but I have stayed at Kingscote Lake Lodge in the southern tip of Algonquin Park. It was a great resort. I think I spelled it correctly?...Larry

However, I find that you get so much information back it makes the decisions even more difficult!!Cheers."
1170122,wvwalleyegal,2010-02-18 20:36:00,7,thanks! we have stayed in huntsville a few times - makes a nice place to stop and get up to head into marten river the next day - i'll check out that build a trip site too! :-)
1170140,ohiojmj,2010-02-19 05:00:00,1262,"Just thought i would mention that some lakes in Algonquin Park do not contain large walleye/pike populations. For example, Lake Opeongo, contains smallmouth, lake and brook trout. If I recall correctly, some highland lakes have no natural way for fish to migrate upstream (falls/rapids) and the water has low nutrient content due to rocky watershed. Suggest checking this out when picking a lake. I'm sure many have the usual pike/walleye/smallmouth combo package like the lakes closer to Huntsville, also like Marten River area mentioned above and Red Cedar lake that i've been to a few times.I've been to Opeongo, Smoke, Burnt Island, Canoe lakes in Algonquin a couple times, fishing Opeongo over a couple days and caught only smallies (not geared up for deep lake trout)."
