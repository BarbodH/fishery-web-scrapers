I have a few questions that maybe someone can help me with: first, how difficult is the test? Second, do you have to be in Ontario / Canada to take the test? Also, how long does it take and where can you take it? I appreciate any help."

The FCC handled the paperwork for US citizens getting Canadian licenses............Don't ask me. LOL Call 888CALLFCC to see how this works these days."
