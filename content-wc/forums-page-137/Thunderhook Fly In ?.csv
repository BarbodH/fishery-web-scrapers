The owner Drake Dill is fantastic to deal with.Have heard great things about Shab, the south camp is palatial, really beautiful! Besides Shab, they have some of the more interesting outpost camps in that region north of Armstrong, primarily Keezhik and Machawaian.I think it's a great choice, I really don't think your friend could go wrong choosing that camp."
6268580,jimirjr,2018-12-13 06:39:00,1149,Thank You Mr Borger ! I will relay the info and Have My Buddy look at the web site soon...
6271706,Guest,2018-12-24 14:18:00,0,I have not fished with this outfit but have done a ton of business with them throughout the last few years. I changed careers in spring so I haven't talked with Drake recently. They are outstanding to deal with and understand the business to guest relationship. Drake is a very interesting guy with a lot of life experiences and extremely down to earth for his age. In my opinion that dictates 1/2 the trip in itself... the stay/hospitality and next the fishing. Wish you luck and welcome to god's country!
