6272480,The tank,2018-12-27 11:47:00,340,Gawleys parkview camp on wabaskang is a nice place. Brevon and Afton are great to deal with. Got the little store at the end of the driveway on 105 makes it nice.
6274160,gullrockguy,2019-01-01 15:04:00,44,"gullrock lake lodge, just south of red lake is the spot you want, good facilities, terrific walleye and northern fishing just minutes from the dock, lake is relatively small compared to lake of the woods . the owners are top notch, give it a look."
6274210,JAY221,2019-01-01 17:10:00,877,"I'll second the Sleepy Dog Cabins and yes Tom does have RV Camping spots and very nice cabins. Tom can and will take care of your needs. We have never had a problem there and will be back in July. Later, Jay"
6271490,Bergy,2018-12-23 20:33:00,83,"Looking for a northwest Ontario Resort with nice cabins and camping for RV’s. Live in Minnesota and would like to stay within no more than 2 - 3 hours north of the border. Mainly interested in targeting Walleyes. Would like a place that has a swimming area, protected docks, etc."
6271492,That Minnesota guy,2018-12-23 20:43:00,8293,Tomahawk Resort.
6271498,Bergy,2018-12-23 21:06:00,83,Is Tomahawk in good proximity to Walleye fishing spots? We don’t want long boat rides to fish.
6271504,That Minnesota guy,2018-12-23 21:21:00,8293,Probably not.
6271518,bigwalleye1,2018-12-24 05:55:00,2632,"Red Pine lodge near Sioux Lookout, but that may be further than you want to go."
6271578,NARDA 1,2018-12-24 08:36:00,636,Check out www.birchdalelodge.com
6271586,Guest,2018-12-24 08:51:00,0,"I wouldnt recommend Tomahawk. The area around Sioux Narrows has been netted the last few years and the walleye areound that area have definitely thinned out. The decent walleye fishing required a 40 minute ride and with their pump gas going for well over $6 a gallon, its quite expensive to get dinner walleye."
6271738,MN_Moose,2018-12-24 18:07:00,964,You might consider Sunnyside resort on the Winnipeg river.
6271902,x4flatfish,2018-12-25 11:08:00,319,"Abram Lake Park just outside of Sioux Lookout. They have nice cabins, camp ground with showers, boat launch, dock, and beach. Lot's of walleye fishing close by.http://www.abramlake.ca/cottages.htm"
6272310,tadler,2018-12-26 16:07:00,43,I believe Sleepy Dog on Wabaskang Lake has a few RV spots as well as great cabins. www.sleepydogcabins.com
