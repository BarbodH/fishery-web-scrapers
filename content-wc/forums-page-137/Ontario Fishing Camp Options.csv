5921482,prov1800,2017-12-31 19:13:00,5010,I'll agree with rich.many camps in our area with good fishing.worth the extra few hrs drive.definatly a long one.did the drive in May to pelee island.we crossed over the Mackinac bridge.beatiful drive through the north although speed limits were slower than the interstate.thete are many nice camps on wabigoon lake as well as eagle lake.both cutting a bit of time off your trip.
5922258,fsz,2018-01-01 08:47:00,144,"Prov, Maybe you have friends/family on Pelee and went for the May long weekend? Not too common for anyone to be fishing there that early. Anyway, back to the original post. Pasha lake cabins is within your distance from Cleveland I enjoyed it. However, it is a ""drive to a back-lake"" style camp- there is no genuinely good fishing on the home lake you drive out every day to a different lake and portage in to boats he has cached (or in some cases trailer a boat). Onaman is one of those lakes and fits the bill for size but depending on how full the camp is you may only get to fish it once or maybe twice as there is a limited number of boats."
5923890,Obabikon,2018-01-02 08:02:00,2370,As pointed out on the other thread.... Cleveland to LOTW's is about 1025 miles.
5924106,prov1800,2018-01-02 09:40:00,5010,No relates.no friends there.wife wanted to go look at song birds.great little island.very peacefully.did bring my fishing rods and caught a lot of smallmouths and my first ever carp.lots of them.first week of May.saw and talked to guys with boats and they were catching walleye.i was nust mentioning that the drive was long but enjoyable except for crossing through Detroit.
6270204,RichA$1970,2018-12-19 19:17:00,1159,I Am in the same boat but looking for a camp to go solo to in Ontario. May have to camp with a tent based on cost
6270270,Bstar,2018-12-20 05:31:00,564,Check out this camphttp://holinshead.ca/
6270282,pjshorthorn,2018-12-20 06:05:00,5654,"Check out Vermilion Bay Lodge. I have been there a number of times and have enjoyed it each time. Walleye, northern, Musky,lake trout, perch, rock bass, smallmouth and whitefish are all species that can be targeted within easy runs from the lodge. The price point is phenomenal if one is looking for an affordable trip.http://vermilionbaylodge.com/ Although not a remote based lodge, it has plenty to offer in terms of the camp atmosphere, amenities and a remote fishing feel. There are 3-4 remote lakes that can be portaged into if you really want that getaway experience from everyone else. There are no cabins on the remote lakes so they are just day excursions. If one wanted to do a day flyin trip to another lake I think that can be set up through the lodge as well. PjShorthorn"
6270294,pjshorthorn,2018-12-20 06:21:00,5654,"Check out the link above that I posted. Gord has a two person cabin that is lakefront and would be perfect for your situation. Prices are in Canadian so just get on a currency calculator website and you will get a good idea of what the current cost would be in US dollars. It would be quite a bit less than the $800 US budget you want to stay withinThe packages are all housekeeping and camp boats are 16 1/2' Alumarine flat bottom with depth finder and 25 HP Yamaha motors. On your trips up to Red Lake for the flyins you've done through Chino, you would have driven right by it in Vermilion Bay before turning onto the 105 to head north . If you want, PM me and I can give you more detail . I'm going back the week of June 15th and the last I heard, the two person cabin was still available but it would be best to check with Gord.Best of luck finding a trip that fits your needs.PjShorthorn"

5903642,Rls825,2017-12-19 10:46:00,9,"Looking for advice as to the best drive to Ontario fishing lake and camp that is within 1000 miles of Cleveland.. this includes, and we are focusing on, lakes near Nakina / Geraldton, or as far west as Upsala. Late May to mid June. Primarily Walleye, secondly Pike. More interested in size than quantity. Combination of lakes with decent cabins, camp and boats. Thanks"
5903850,MrSimon,2017-12-19 12:15:00,922,"O'Sullivan Lake.http://www.osullivansrainbow.com/ Widely considered the best drive-to camp for trophy walleye in NW Ontario. I'm sure there are lots of other drive-to gems that fly under the radar, but O'Sullivan has been producing, and producing well, year after year for decades."
5904426,andreindy,2017-12-19 18:51:00,308,"I had researched previously the area you are inquiring about. You may have a very difficult time securing a place for the dates you are hoping for as most folks lock in before their current trip is even over. There may be hope though....some places wait until after the first of the year and if they do not have deposits for reservations, those spots open up. However, some of them may already have waiting lists to get in."
5904506,bthomas3333,2017-12-19 20:19:00,465,What is the price range?b-
5904530,adempsey2.0,2017-12-19 20:24:00,611,"While there are likely some great options on the Nakina area, I'd recommend checking out Lady Evelyn Lake. There are five boat-in camps on the lake, but it's a large body of water. While it's not very far from ""civilization"", it's not easy to access by road. So, public access is very limited. Essentially you have to either canoe in, or if you want to bring a boat, you must enter via the Montreal river, trailer your boat at the dam and relaunch it in Lady Evelyn. The Walleye fishing is pretty good, although not everyone does well there. We did reasonably well on our two summer trips. If you are interested, I'd suggest focusing on Garden Island Lodge or Island 10 due to locations. Garden Island is in the best location, especially for the spring. However, Island 10 isn't too far from good fishing either. Some really nice Walleye come out of that lake. I'd probably go there every other year if I could afford to.Another is Old Post Lodge on St. Joseph. Although, it's a bit further than you wanted to drive. St. Joseph is a massive lake with very few camps on it. Any interest in boat-in or drive-to outposts?"
5904602,Rls825,2017-12-19 21:44:00,9,"Thanks. I have also been to many different camps in Ontario, and a few in Quebec, over the decades. I did fish O'Sullivan near Nakina once. Walleye fishing is definitely strong there ( although I did better at the O'Sullivan lake in Quebec ). The other three in my party have not been to O'Sullivan / Nakina and have had limited experience in Canada. .The cabins at both O'Sullivan / Nakina resorts are not much and I was wondering about some of the places farther west ( though not as far north ). Drive to only. Let's put the price up to $800/ wk per person for cabin, boat/motor. Just looking for other ideas; a new adventure."
5915634,Bill Krejca,2017-12-28 08:26:00,6107,"I have stayed at O'Sullivan's Rainbow many times,and will again this summer. Last year, I boated past the other camp, which is located miles away, and a ways up the river flowing into O'S. My opinion is that the camp on the river appears to be less attractive than Rainbow, which is very clean, and well maintained and run. Bill"
5916994,MrSimon,2017-12-29 07:57:00,922,"If you want more cushy cabins, great walleye fishing, drive-to location, with a price of under $800 per person all in, I don't think Nakina is your best option. Certainly the fishing there is great, but I'm not sure how many drive-to camps you'll find in your price range that have really nice cabins. It's pretty rustic up there and most of the best camps are fly-ins. You guys might be better off heading over to Lac Seul or Lake of the Woods. I'm sure there are a bunch of camps out there that meet your requirements. It's still within your 1,000 mile limit."
5918242,Ruddiger,2017-12-30 08:37:00,649,"Howdy,I live in Avon, Ohio and if I was insistent on DRIVE TO, and wasn't willing to go as far as western Ontario (LOTW, Eagle, etc) I would steer you to Nipigon.Take care,Ruddiger"
5921442,Rich B,2017-12-31 18:24:00,1081,"In reading the different responses, I agree with Mr. Simon's comments about heading west. If you're OK with a little longer than your 1k drive limitation, that would open a large number of excellent lakes and nice resorts and camps in the greater Vermilion Bay area to you (northwest of Int'l Falls about 3 hours). I've fished the Cedar Lake chain just north of Vermilion Bay for the Spring Openers and early summer, and it is excellent for numbers of walleyes, pike, SM Bass, trophy Musky as well as crappie and perch. A nice clean camp (www.cedarpointresort.ca) that we stayed has very fair prices, and offers quality upgraded camp boats (see website). I have towed up my Lund Pro-V several times, and once rented one of their upgraded tillers for a week. PM me if you have any questions on the camp. This lake chain is easy to fish and navigate, and offers a number of protected bays and side lakes - one of the local professional guides in Vermilion Bay posts on here frequently (prov1800) and guides on the lake chain. Eagle Lake is just south of Vermilion Bay, and Lac Suel is north on the 105 - lot's of great water in that area, and many good camps that meet your requirements. Only downside is the drive up and back, though I've done the drive a number of times and never regretted doing so. Have done the drive west and around Chicago and up through Wisconsin, as well as up through Michigan and across the UP to Duluth and north. Both were good routes, though different. Would mention I live in Dover (straight south of Cleveland); so I know that getting to good water up north is a chore....good luck with your decision. Rich B"
