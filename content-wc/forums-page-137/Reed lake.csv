All guests get their own guide for the whole period they are there. When I asked our guide about how he learned to lake, he frankly said ""I just followed the other guys until I learned where to go"". Shouldn't be to hard to develop the same methodology, just be there when they depart in the morning.... Ours didn't disappoint..personal best was a 52"" northern. Lots in the mid 40's. Anyplace that looked like it should have a walleye, did. Only caught them for shore lunch, which only took 15 min. to do."

6274258,JWN1,2019-01-01 19:30:00,6,Sounds like a rumor to me and everyone that has been on that lake. It is a great fishery but be sure not a person in this world that knows the lake will admit to knowing the depths or reef positions of that lake even 70% of that.
