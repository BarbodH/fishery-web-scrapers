6273198,Pooch,2018-12-29 16:18:00,4618,Looking at past trips and ran across this one. I remember it well as it was a perfect day to be on the water trolling for walleye. Fish turned out to be a large northern and while that was great we were hoping for a really large walleye. Fooled us as the fish just stayed down using it's weight to advantage. Give and take went on for many minutes before we got a first glimpse of her.This picture makes my heart go pity-pat every time I look at it. I can't be the only one...........Pooch
6273218,fishron,2018-12-29 18:28:00,317,"Pooch, the one's that get to me are, heavy fish, rod doubled over, can just barley feel the fish move, locked on the bottom, and the hook pulls free. I don't mind losing a fish as much as never getting a look at it."
6273258,Pooch,2018-12-29 21:25:00,4618,"Agree 100%. All I want is to see the fish. Measuring it is just frosting on the cake. We are all C&R, but for a few eaters. Nothing I catch comes south of the border.Pooch"
6273266,jackpotjohnny48,2018-12-29 21:59:00,153,"Count me in as somebody who also agrees with this sentiment. In my 29 prior trips to Canada, I have only brought home fish on one occasion. (We took 3 walleyes home from our first Canadian trip back in 1989). But the whole process of wrapping the fish (after being careful to leave skin on the fillets), and all the other hassle, just seems like a nuisance to me. Plus, Northwest Ontario is such a beautiful place, that I basically want to leave it exactly as I found it. So we do everything we can to minimize the number of fish that we kill. We may occasionally have a fish fry, where we keep 1 or 2 walleyes per guy, but we never keep any walleye over 17 inches. And since 1989, we've never brought any fish back into the U.S. with us. I'd rather spend my time catching fish and enjoying the scenery, than wasting all that time cleaning fish. We've found that the catch and release is a lot more fun and hassle-free.

6273344,BornToFish,2018-12-30 08:04:00,1224,"Greetings,I normally like what I refer to as an ""auto-release"" for walleyes. I enjoy the thrill of feeling the bite, setting the hook and battling the fish to the side of the boat. It's normally okay with me if the hook pulls out of the fish at boat side, as I don't need to deal with hook removal or risk injury to the fish.I used the word ""normally"" above as there is one fish that has eluded me: my first 30+ inch walleye. I have on my bucket list a picture of me holding that first 30+ incher! I have netted at least a dozen 30+ inchers for my fishing partners. I have caught many walleyes in the 28-29.75 inch range. I have had many walleyes on my fishing line that I would legitimately put in the 30-32 inch range, but have yet to net one.A few years ago, I had a walleye at boat side that I thought was 31-32 inches. The hook pulled out as I was reaching for the net - fishing solo that time. The image of that fish laying on the surface of the water, flipping it's pectoral fin at me is burned into my memory. I relate to FishRon's comment about feeling the bite and not being able to budge the fish from the bottom, and then the hooks pulls out or the line breaks.My wife and I normally do not take fish home with us. We have a few shore lunches on most of our trips. That's enough fish for us. We brought some walleye fillets home with us last August, as my mother asked for a fish fry. We were stopped at a MNR game check on our way home. I still remember the quizzical look on the face of the officer when he realized that the number of fish in our cooler was less than our allowed limit.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

My hands are shaking. You can hear the click click click of the drag. For a cold Dec day this video always helps me get through the hard water season.https://youtu.be/59s0220ROz8https://youtu.be/59s0220ROz8I netted the fish pretty fresh so the handling of the fish isnt the best. I apologize.In late December it is nice to see a big girl hit the net.Brett"
6273476,Fishin Fun,2018-12-30 16:45:00,218,I love days like that. Calm water and huge tug of the rod. Awesome.
6273702,skindzier,2018-12-31 09:40:00,137,"Ouch - this thread reminded me of probably my biggest screwup ever with a fish. On Lac Seul I had one of those big ones that went down to the bottom and sat there. No head shaking - nothing that made it seem like a northern at all. Well, it sat there, & sat there, just pulling a little drag occasionally, but moving very little. Well, I got impatient & started to try to horse it up. End result, straightened the hook on the jig. I am 99% sure this would've been my 30"". My current biggest is 27"". Worse then watching my Lions play every week..."
6273746,bthomas3333,2018-12-31 11:33:00,465,For what it is worth...I have found big pike. Those above 45in/20lbs fight a lot more like a big walleye than a pike. They tend to fight to stay down. I have seen times where they come up with a mouth full of mud/silt from staying down. If I get something big on that stays down I don't automatically assume it is a walleye. Of course once the big pike finally does come up the experience is VERY different. lol.Brett
