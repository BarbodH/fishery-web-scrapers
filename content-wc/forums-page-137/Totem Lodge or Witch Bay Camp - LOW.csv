6266328,ManitowishWaters,2018-12-05 19:40:00,39,Been to Witch Bay and had a good time. Fishing was good. Service and food was great. Check out Stormer Lake Lodge good food and service and incredible walleye fishing.
6266852,bellbuoy,2018-12-07 06:49:00,490,"I first went to Witch Bay about 20 years ago. I've been going back on and off ever since, it is a fabulous place. Steve & Gail Hockett are always putting $ back into the camp. I will say this, I see Totem Lodge boats up in Andrew Bay - that's a long boat ride. And as for the 7 mile road back to the camp, it's part of the experience. One of the gentlemen who used to come up annually from Fl called it the Burma Road."
6267936,Ruddiger,2018-12-11 06:55:00,649,"Howdy,Respectfully, I've been to WBC quite a few times and I can tell you that the condition of the road can vary greatly depending upon rain and when it was last grated. I wouldn't let it deter someone from coming but my travel estimate is closer to what they actually quote customers as far as drive time.Take care,RuddigerPS-And everything said about Gail and Steve is true and then some. They are fantastic people and run a fantastic camp."
6267972,chris165,2018-12-11 08:17:00,128,Another option in that area is Motlongs Rod and Reel. Family owned and ran.
6268014,eyeman_1,2018-12-11 10:13:00,690,"Bergy,I have been to both, and have enjoyed both, however, they are very different experiences. If going to Totem, I stay at Wiley Point Lodge. Give me a PM and I can elaborate further, but here is just an off the top of my head comparison.The road into Witch Bay... is a very trying experience... especially if you have a nicer boat and tandem axle trailer. The road is narrow, windy, unpaved and in some cases just ruts filled with water.... but it is passable and at around 7mi long took us an hour to come in on... going slow with a Ranger, Lund and Alumacraft from 18 - 21'. If another guest is headed in the opposite direction... you may have a tough time getting by each other without some tree rash... Once at the lodge however, Steve and Gail are terrific folks and will go out of they're way to make your stay wonderful. The docks are fair and the whips keep boats safe. Launching bigger boats is ok, just tight. Cabins especially the deluxe one's are nice... we took the American Plan and the food was traditional camp food and good.Witch Bay offers great help in locating fish/spots... they have helpful folks and Russ is awesome to help and offer any tips he can.... Other than traveling some to get to bigger fish... it's a wonderful family place and there were lots of kids around. Access to the outside world is via WiFi at the lodge... but that's why we went there too.Totem / Wiley Point is a different experience altogether. To get to Wiley you boat in from Totem about an hour following a lead boat or someone who knows how to get there safely. The ride is scenic and fun as long as the wind isn't up... Cabins are first class, docks are great, and the food on the American Plan is incredible...! The lodge has a game room for kids, TV and bar. Great deck to have meals on or relax. There is a work out room, paddle boats, canoe etc.. for guest use... and my back loves the hot tub...that alone makes it a great day.Fishing is awesome... what species do you want to chase... they are all there and close to camp... you honestly don't need to go far! Bass, eyes, ski's, pike, crappie... it's all great and close. The really big difference is likely going to be cost... As I said, Witch Bay is an excellent place and the folks running it are just awesome, great people to work with. They will make you feel at home and they love what they do. Totem/ Wiley is another fantastic lodge... different in some ways, but really nice. I don't think you'd go wrong at either place, it will boil down to what you desire for experience, and cost. Good luck with your choice... you will like either."
6269210,Bnicov,2018-12-16 11:30:00,4,I'd look at Smith Camps. It's up on Bigstone Bay and is a 25 min ride down to Andrew Bay but there is fantastic fishing for walleye to be had within a 5-10 minute run. The place is well kept and the restaurant / pub is great. My in laws had a cottage nearby and that's where the boat was put in and pulled out. Good spot for a family.
6271486,Bergy,2018-12-23 20:27:00,83,The other family we are going with has decided they want to bring their R.V. and camp. Any suggestions where this will work other than Tomahawk on Lake Of The Woods? I like Tomahawk but it sounds like Walleye fishing is a long boat ride from their resort.
6271522,bellbuoy,2018-12-24 06:18:00,490,"Laughing Water has some cabins for rent, never stayed there. It's also Lake of the Woods Houseboatshttp://lowhouseboats.com"
6271824,MN_Moose,2018-12-25 08:25:00,964,You could look at Sunnyside resort on the Winnipeg river. Not fancy but they have both camp sites and cabins. Fishing spots are close. The only drawback is that non Canadian have a reduced limit. A big positive is that Sunnyside is probably the cheapest vacation you'll ever have.
6263938,Bergy,2018-11-28 15:02:00,83,"Hi Everyone, I am looking for a good place to go with my wife and 2 kids. We want a drive to resort and we would be bringing our own boat. We would also cook our own meals. Main things would be: Fishing close by (less than 10 miles) Help from the resort on where to fish Mapping for electronics available Protected docking Good road to resort Swimming or other activities at the resort Many have suggested Totem Lodge or Witch Bay Camp. Any experience with these? Do they fit what we are looking for? Are they close to good fishing? Thanks."
6263946,IAranger,2018-11-28 15:20:00,352,"Based on what you said Witch Bay may not be a fit for you . The fishing is outstanding and Gail is the best Host in Ontario. But the road in there was pretty rough last 5 miles or so. They used to be American Plan only .... that may not fit what you asked about but your wife would love it! Witch Bay is more of a fishing camp and caters around fishing as the main type of entertainment, there is no pool / beach but lots of fun to be had there !"
6264000,That Minnesota guy,2018-11-28 18:02:00,8293,"Contact Tomahawk Resort. Road is good, cabins are great, docks are second to none. Fishing will depend on how good you are."
6264138,Thompmd,2018-11-29 10:10:00,320,You might also look at Indianhead Lodge. This was our first year there and we are returning in June . I'll help any way I can
6264164,MN_Moose,2018-11-29 12:14:00,964,"I would say no one place is going to be perfect in every respect. I've never been to either resort but I've been by each several times. Fishing close by (less than 10 miles) * nod to Witch Bay on this one. Witch Bay, Andrew Bay and several areas near French Narrows are within 10 miles. Totem sure you could fish within sight of the lodge but better fishing out past yellow girl bay smiley face. Help from the resort on where to fish * again Witch Bay. They have a program where guides go with you, you follow them to spots all of which is included in the price. Mapping for electronics available * map cards for either are good Protected docking * I don't know about Totem but I would guess lots of traffic. Witch Bay Camp for sure is good protected docks. Good road to resort * nod to Totem. It's right on 71. WBC would be a dirt road off 71 for quite a ways. Swimming or other activities at the resort * Totem would be close to Sioux Narrows for all the tourist activities."
6264240,Obabikon,2018-11-29 17:34:00,2370,"Steve at Which Bay will have more of a personal touch. Eric at Totem will have the nicer amenities. I don't think you can go wrong with either experience, but one is a ""mom and pop"" type place, and the other is a Hilton high class place."
6264244,Obabikon,2018-11-29 17:40:00,2370,"Sorry, I should have looked closer at your post before responding. I'll go through your topics. Fishing close by (less than 10 miles) - Which Bay will be superior in this (Unless you're talking Totem's Wiley Point). I suggest staying away from the clear water of White Fish Bay. Stained water will produce better daytime fishing. Help from the resort on where to fish - Which Bay Mapping for electronics available - Both Protected docking - Which Bay (I'm not even sure you can go to Totem with your own boat) Good road to resort - Totem (if I'm not mistaken, there's a long gravel road to Which Bay... is there anyone that can confirm this?) Swimming or other activities at the resort - Probably both Hope that helps! Have an awesome trip no matter where you go!"
6264404,Ruddiger,2018-11-30 07:28:00,649,"Howdy,I believe WBC has everything you wan't, however, it does not offer housekeeping until late September after they close the dining hall.If your set on housekeeping you may want to consider the angle or the Morson area and find a drive to resort that caters to it.Also, the road to WBC is 7 miles of logging road. If you go slow your fine but it does add almost an hour to your drive.Take care,RuddigerPS-Full disclosure, and no disrespect to any of the other great camps in Ontario, but I consider WBC to be the best ran resort I have ever been to and I am a frequent guest."
6264876,martinbns,2018-12-01 15:17:00,1520,"Totem is all about the 5 star experience, guides, nicer boats, excellent gourmet food and you pay for it. Why not look at renting a cottage of your own, we rent this place. The owners are great, will give you some spots, their home has a nice little beach, excellent docking, bait is a quick drive up the road in the AM. About a 15 minute drive into Kenora. Three bedrooms, very well equipped, the Owners live on site in the main house.https://www.vrbo.com/1256932"
6264982,Knutson21,2018-12-01 20:41:00,348,"I have been to Witch Bay twice and love the place. Yes the 7 mile road is rough but it doesnt take 1 hour to get through it. Pulling my ranger it is about 25 minutes, and i dont rip it up. I take my time be patient. If it takes you an hour you are just crawling at idol, its not that bad of a road."
