6274260,billy weaver,2019-01-01 19:34:00,470,I have been taking my grandson to Wabaskang since he was 6 yrs old. That was 11 years ago and he will be with me again in 2019. I wish I would see more young kids with their families doing these kind of activities.

My son loves doing the cooking videos for his gramma and aunt in England. Plan came together pretty well.VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/TslsPSkhT5E"

6273284,jackpotjohnny48,2018-12-30 00:29:00,153,That was pretty awesome. I love the way your son shakes the flour / coating bags. That's the same way I do it. (I put on some dance music and do my best MC Hammer impersonation... very similar to the way your son does it). Very enjoyable video. Well done!
