6269930,BornToFish,2018-12-19 05:58:00,1224,"Greetings,Tank offered a great reply to the question about ""best time"" to fish in NW Ontario. My wife most often fishes with me in July and August as that is when the weather is about as stable as it gets.I will offer a different view on the same question. Fish eat on a fairly regular schedule. I encourage the original poster to select a body of water that has a good population of the fish (type and size) that he/she wants to target. Once chosen, about the only thing that changes throughout the season is where and how (presentation) one best targets these fish. Obviously, an angler that is locked into a particular technique for presenting lures should fish during the part of the season when the chosen presentation is effective. Angler comfort then plays into the equation as well.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6269968,Duflebag,2018-12-19 07:53:00,218,"I will add to the discussion on fishing in NWO in July and August. By that time of the year the weeds should be up and easy to spot. this is some of the best time for casting for pike in the weed beds. Casting weed beds gives you smething different than just walleye fishing all day every day. Plus, there is nothing like the thrill of a crashing strike by a big pike. A musky strike is probably better but all musky fishermen know the dedication you need to even see a fish much less get strikes. Pike being beingas aggressive as they are will give you the opportunity for multiple fish in an afternoon. Just a little to add to July/August as being a good time of the year for what you are looking for."
6270006,BornToFish,2018-12-19 09:25:00,1224,"Greetings, I offer a follow-up comment to the previous post. I fished a lake several years ago that was notorious for offering an early morning walleye bite and another walleye bite just before dark. The walleye bite from mid-morning to early evening was a very difficult sell. We followed Dufflebag's suggestion and often fished for northern pike during the middle of the day. We spent many afternoon's bending our fishing rods with northern pike over the edges of weed beds. We often found our bigger northern pike during summer to be associated with mid-lake rock humps. The lakes that we now fish are somewhat different than the lake referenced above. The lakes that we now fish have weed beds that hold good numbers of bigger northern pike throughout the season. The rock humps still hold some bigger pike during summer A key to fishing success in NW Ontario is being flexible and targeting what is biting at the moment - be it northerns, bass, walleyes, perch or whatever. Having established weed beds can help establish viable patterns in fish behavior. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6269232,ttbowhunter,2018-12-16 14:14:00,5,"Guys, Iâ€™m looking for recommendations on a quality outfitter/guide service in NWO for both myself & my wife to fish walleye / pike. We definitely like more of a blue collar environment with good people & good fishing. We are looking for someone very professional & serious about what they do and care to develop long term repeat clients. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated!"

6269728,Ricky Spanish,2018-12-18 11:12:00,1298,Temple Bay Lodge on Eagle Lake fits that bill for us. My wife and I have been going there since 2002. It came under new ownership a few years back and it has been one positive improvement after another ever since.
6269762,Obabikon,2018-12-18 12:57:00,2370,That Obaibkon place is pretty cool! Certainly is husband/wife friendly.
6269764,Ricky Spanish,2018-12-18 13:00:00,1298,"I have heard that, too. That Jared guy sure seems like good people."
6269888,ttbowhunter,2018-12-18 21:13:00,5,"Thanks everyone, That gives me a solid place to start. On a general note, what is everyones opinion on the best all around month to chase eyes in NWO?"
6269902,The tank,2018-12-19 02:56:00,340,I allways say it depends on what kind of weather do you like to fish in. My wife and I go july-mid august. She wants to get some sun. Ive fished from opening week-mid sept. I think walleye fishing is weather related. You get a week of stable weather you should have good fishing. We used to fish 1st week of june every year. Got tired of rain and temps up and down. Going by averages of my weeks of fishing i would say mid july-mid august. But it can be hot. Weve had big number days and big fish days during this time. Most people like the month of june.
