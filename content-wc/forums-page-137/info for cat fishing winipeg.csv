As I recall June was a peak periods for cats. There was a ramp at the old Cats location just north of the Dam on the west side and also one in the city park further North. It seemed that the bulk of the cat fishing was done closer to the dam. If you are coming from the states do the money exchange at the border. That far north they do not like taking American money. The motels in the area were not real good 10 yrs ago so I'm not sure what they would be like now."
