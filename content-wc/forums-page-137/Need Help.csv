6271636,mlure,2018-12-24 11:33:00,15,I have a place in Morson and have no problem catching walleyes during the day in open water. We do real well in late afternoon and early evenings through the ice but have not been able to really do good during the day. Any advice would be helpful.

I'm wondering if the walleyes move off the structure/shallows during the day. If so, look to the nearest deep water. They might be a ""cast"" or two away from where you catch them in the low-light conditions. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
