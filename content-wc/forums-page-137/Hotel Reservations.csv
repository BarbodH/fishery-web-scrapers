6271294,kzoofisher,2018-12-23 07:19:00,5144,"Stayed at the Water Tower Inn on the Canadian side last year, 6 vehicles broken into, 2 were ours. Manager said it never happens, OPP said it happens all the time. Heads up to those making reservations."
6271466,andreindy,2018-12-23 18:39:00,308,"I can relax a little. Today, I formally booked our ""apartment"" for Friday, July 12th in Nakina. It will accommodate our 6 guys. The outfitter has an on-site bunk house at the airbase, but this was grabbed by someone with more foresight than myself. Next best was grabbing a room in Nakina 5 minutes away."
6270430,BornToFish,2018-12-20 11:01:00,1224,"Greetings, I waited last season until late January to make our hotel reservations for our fishing trips in 2018 - both to and from the fishing lodge. One of our preferred hotels did not have any rooms available for one night on our way to the lodge. I waited several weeks and tried again to make the one reservation. Fortunately for us, there was a room available due to a cancellation. We made all of our hotel reservations last week with no problems. Maybe something for folks to ponder? Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6270444,That Minnesota guy,2018-12-20 11:26:00,8293,Good heads up! For anybody planning to stay in International Falls Mn. on a Friday night book now. Get a conformation number and write it down someplace you wont lose it.
6270584,NARDA 1,2018-12-20 17:19:00,636,When we check in for the current year we make the reservation for the next year!
6270596,Mojo-NC,2018-12-20 17:59:00,1929,We had the same problem in Dryden last year. We were still able to have dinner at the Riverview Lodge but weren't able to stay there. It's a nice rustic place. I guess there are a lot of people with the same idea. We ended up staying at the Holiday Inn Express instead. The upside is that we woke up smarter.
6270710,Bstar,2018-12-21 06:49:00,564,"Just made our reservations this week at the Rendezvous in Fort Frances and the Super 8 in Rice Lake, WI. for our trip in August. It's never too early to make your reservations but it's always too late if you can't get into your preferred hotel."
6270738,BornToFish,2018-12-21 07:32:00,1224,"Greetings, Mojo: I love your sense of humor! Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6270826,Mojo-NC,2018-12-21 11:06:00,1929,"When we drive up from International Falls, we always stay in Dryden on our way up to Ear Falls. This year we're flying into Winnipeg, so I booked a place in Kenora called Brewers Inn, which is located on the north shore of LOTW. Is anyone familiar with the place? It got good reviews and was very reasonably priced."
6270872,Lovetofish,2018-12-21 13:44:00,458,Ironic I checked earlier today the two newer motels in Sioux Lookout for rooms in July and both show none available.
6270878,Bstar,2018-12-21 14:18:00,564,When I checked online at the Rendezvous in Fort Frances it said there were no rooms available so I called and there was no problem reserving three lakeside rooms in August. Best bet is to call them especially the hotels in Canada.
6270886,Lovetofish,2018-12-21 14:35:00,458,Same for me this past summer and I was late checking on rooms. Nothing available but a direct call got us a room at Days Inn. Suspect they only allow so many rooms to be booked online. But I am surprised this far out there is nothing available next summer for July 12th at either place.
