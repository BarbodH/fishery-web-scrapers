6272202,prov1800,2018-12-26 11:28:00,5010,I'd say a blanket would do the trick.but nature can turn nasty even in July.id get a middle of the road one.they weigh nothing so it wouldn't effect the weight your allowed on the plane.

You can get a good bag for under $50 at the usual sporting goods stores. I suggest the following features.• Rectangular shape - Roomiest and also allows you to unzip it fully to be used as a blanket - Comes in handy when it is too hot to sleep in the bag. I also bring an old sheet to cover the mattress. Mummy bags can’t do that.• Nylon exterior material – easier to keep clean. Flannel lined bag may feel more comfy but they get dirtier and smellier. • Synthetic insulation will work just fine. Yeah, down will be a tad lighter and insulate best, but you don’t need to pay for those advantages. Also, the synthetic bag will perform better and dry faster if gotten wet.• Get a good stuff sack (should be included with the bag) to protect the bag and save storage space."

6272366,Bstar,2018-12-27 05:10:00,564,Thanks! That's the kid of info I'm looking for!
6272372,phishfearme,2018-12-27 06:20:00,1242,"another thing to consider is to simply make a bed roll - I really dislike the restrictions of a sleeping bag so I bring a bed roll that includes an old fitted single sheet, regular sheet and a light comforter. roll a pillow up in these a I think you have a much more comfortable sleeping situation for little if any additional weight. phish"
6272384,Bstar,2018-12-27 07:24:00,564,That's a good idea too. Thanks!
6272434,Esoxmike,2018-12-27 10:19:00,114,Always take a light sheet to cover with in case it's warm and the skeeters are bad!
