With that said Bearberry outpost with Chimo is still on our short list. We fished Bearberry for many years through 2016, then had to step back due to members job changing and health issues. Looking for any current/2018 reports. We understand Chimo is under new ownership and are therefore more interested in cabin, boat, motor, portage boat conditions and your impressions of the new ownership and their future goals. Also if you stayed at other Chimo outpost camps this year, please feel free to chime in. Thank you"

I've been wanting to go to Bearberry for years but it's always been booked when I wanted. Hornby was awesome- I would recommend going. With that being said, the dock was ****ty and had to spend 6 hours cleaning the cabin and sealing it from bugs. My impression of the ownership is mixed. After 25 years of friendship with Peter, it will be hard to move on. Daniel is part owner of the camps and has been with Chimo for years. He's a very good guy. Chris is the money guy and is enthusiastic. There are talks of ""improvements"" but I am skeptical of the changes. They got a brand new 16' flat bottom with live well, electric start, 20 hp 4 stroke on Roderick. $300 per week. Personally, that isn't a change that I need. I would prefer them to fix the beat up Portage Lake landing on either side.If you want my summary- For the 1st time in 25 years I will be going to the ""All Canada Show"" checking out new camps. I might not switch, but we will see which way the wind blows in 2019."

Biggest northern was 36” n walleyes were 16-18”. Everything ran well except they were 3 hours late picking us up Saturday as they had to drop off fuel at Roderick. Going to Lake St Joe or Nakina area this year.
