We have 12"" of ice on the lake we live on and there was 8""-9"" on the lake I travelled to for a quick session last Friday. Bite was on right away with a pike hiding a foot under the ice that slammed the minnow almost before it was under the ice, then lots of lost fish and after an hour and a half I left with 4 nice eaters. Good start. Still only around 4"" of snow on the ground, less time plowing and snowblowing = more fishing. VIDEO OF SESSIONhttps://youtu.be/pkTYaAPQFsI"
