Technically we stayed on Slender Lake at the outpost run by Pipestone Fly-In Outposts (very nice outpost cabin). Our main tactic for the week (in terms of walleye fishing) was to troll larger sized crankbaits late at night. (Our best time window was the 3 hours from 930 pm until 1230 am the next morning, although we never really stayed out ultra late - never past 1 am). We experienced our best success fishing the upper 20 feet of the water column in water that was 80 to 130 feet deep. We were specifically targeting suspended walleyes that were there to intercept the ciscoes, as the ciscoes made their daily vertical migration. (The depthfinder was absolutely littered with ciscoes - EVERYWHERE - between the hours of 930 pm and 1230 am - see attached video). Since we were targeting bigger fish, we ran lures that would be considered a bit bigger than the typical walleye bait, or on the smaller size of the musky bait range (In fact, we trolled our crankbaits on musky rods). Best producing baits were: 1. Yo Zuri Crystal Minnow Magnum Size (approximately the same length as a size 18 rapala). We were trolling the Yo Zuri crystal minnows about 3 feet down over water that was 80 to 130 feet deep. But the walleyes didn't seem to mind, as they were suspended quite high, and didn't have any problems coming up to hit it. 2. Rapala Husky Mag 15 We ran this about 15 feet down over the 80 to 130 foot depths. 3. Rapala X Rap Magnum 20. We ran this down about 20 feet down over the 80 to 130 foot depths. These 3 lures are actually all considered to be saltwater lures, so I had to order them online, as they are not generally sold in any of the retail outlets here in Wisconsin. Trolling speed was generally a bit faster than what we would typically do with smaller lures. We kept our speed at anywhere from 2.7 mph to 3.1 mph. This suspended fish bite was aimed at targeting larger fish. In fact, the smallest fish we caught in open water was 23 inches. The largest was 30 inches. During the daytime and early evening, we trolled crawler harnesses and rapala jointed deep husky jerks on some of the shallower, more classic structures (reefs and island points in 16 to 20 feet of water), and caught a decent number of smaller walleyes (average size on structure was only 16 to 17 inches, with only 1 fish over 18 inches - a 25 incher which was relatively shallow). But the bigger fish were definitely suspended in deep water and targeting the ciscoes. Attached is a pic of our 3 best lures (listed above). I put a size 18 floating rapala at the bottom of the pic, just to give it some scale. And I'll also provide a link to a 1 minute video clip from our trip, in which the ciscoes, whitefish, and lake trout made substantial upward vertical moves after dark. I think the walleyes probably either spent all day suspended, or deliberately swam out into open water at night to intercept the rising ciscoes. Anyway, here's a pic of our 3 top producing lures from the week.... ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
6273278,jackpotjohnny48,2018-12-29 23:08:00,153,"And here's the one minute video of the ciscoes, whitefish, and lake trout moving way up in the water column just after dark. I actually caught an accidental 30 inch lake trout on a deep diving walleye bandit in 85 feet of water, while trolling for walleyes at about 9 pm one night. It seems that some of the lakers make vertical migrations to follow the ciscoes as well. In any case, the depthfinder was lit up like a Christmas tree (ciscoes everywhere) during the after dark hours. Here's the video....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C9w8C5H7Ro"
6273326,Ogoki,2018-12-30 06:55:00,291,"I saw where you said 9:30 pm to 12:30 am was your best fishing. Wife and I usually go in June and we always say we wouldn't trade 8:30 pm to 11:30 pm for the whole rest of the day. When I started going to Ontario years ago with my friends,we would fish all day and be burnt out and go back to cabin around 7 pm to eat. When my wife started going with me we found out ,go back mid afternoon have fish fry ,nap and head back out around 7 pm until dark. Makes for less tiring day and better, much better fishing."
6273362,Beer King,2018-12-30 09:00:00,146,"Great post John - thanks for sharing. This pattern is something I have been working to get better at. We do it a few times during our annual trip, usually catch some but never consistent or good numbers (Tho I have never seen my graph lit up with fish like yours). Can be hard to pull off a jig bite to go after them but as your results show the big girls can be had this way. It is kind of amazing the variety you will catch over that deep water - bass, walleye, northern, trout all out there near the top during the nightly migration. Cool stuff :-). Do you find certain conditions (weather, wind, moon, etc) better than others? Dan"
6273370,jackpotjohnny48,2018-12-30 09:31:00,153,"Dan, I don't have quite enough data (yet) to form any strong opinion regarding moon phase and weather patterns - at least with respect to walleyes. I have been mostly a musky fisherman for the vast majority of my prior trips to Canada, and have just recently switched over to walleye fishing - mostly by accident. We were trolling for muskies at 11:30 pm during August of 2017, when I caught an accidental 24-inch walleye on a 10-inch Jake, running it about 12 feet down over 65 feet of water. About 5 minutes later, I caught a 27 inch northern (surprising to catch a pike after dark) in about 60 feet of water on the same Jake. So my fishing partner and I switched to smaller sized baits (like the one I mentioned in the OP), and between midnight and 1 am, we were able to catch another 4 walleyes, the smallest one being about 21 inches. This accidental walleye catch occurred on the last night of our trip in 2017, so I didn't experiment with it again until 2018. In our 2018 trip, I dedicated all of our night fishing excursions to walleyes, and didn't even try for muskies. (I'm basically attempting to switch my overall tactics, including musky fishing, to mostly an open water / suspended gameplan, but I want to start with walleyes, since walleyes are more abundant and therefore easier to develop a pattern). My guess is that the weather patterns for night walleyes might be the same as for night muskies. With respect to muskies, we always tended to do better on warm, muggy nights (whenever the mosquitos were awful). We developed a motto: ""When the mosquitos are feeding, the muskies are feeding."" My guess is that the same general rule (warm, humid nights) will apply for walleyes as well. So one of my main overall tactics for night fishing is to spray my night fishing clothes with Permithrin bug spray about 1 week before my trip. I also have a mosquito suit, and leather gloves with the fingertips cut out. One of the main reasons I troll a bit on the fast side (3 mph) is that it helps me to minimize the mosquito attacks. (A friend of mine actually trolls for night walleyes at 4 to 5 mph with 6 to 8 inch musky type baits, and does extremely well on suspended walleyes, even at those really fast speeds). Generally, after about an hour or two of darkness, the mosquito activity dies down, in which case I think I could slow down the trolling speed, which may, in turn lead me to downsize to more ""normal size"" walleye baits (size 14 husky jerks, Smithwick Perfect 10 Rogues, etc). So my tactics so far have been dictated a bit by the mosquitos: 1. Until dusk, troll with walleye size crankbaits at 2 to 2.5 mph. 2. When the mosquitos get bad, SPEED UP, using bigger sized baits. (This isn't necessarily designed to catch more fish. It's just designed to outrun the mosquitos. But we definitely catch fish while doing it). 3. After the mosquitos die down, it's ok to slow down and maybe switch back to normal walleye sized baits (based upon the results). I don't actually have enough data (at least with respect to walleyes) to conclusively say anything about patterns yet. But for our 2019 trip, we are playing with the idea of sleeping all day, and fishing all night. I would like to start at about 8 pm, and fish until about 5 am the next morning. The biggest challenge to this system is dealing with mosquitos for the first hour and a half of darkness. So my top three tactics for nighttime walleye fishing are: 1. Spray your clothes with Permithrin about a week before your trip. 2. Buy a mosquito suit and gloves. 3. Troll faster during the worst of the mosquito bite. With musky fishing, the mosquitos were always less of a factor, since we tended to be trolling closer to 4 mph, which tends to minimize the mosquito factor. Now, in terms of where the fish are located..... They are within the top 20 feet of the water column in deep water (40 to 140 feet of water), waiting to intercept the ciscoes, as the ciscoes make their daily upward movements. They will definitely come up (basically all the way up to the surface) to hit a bait, even in very deep water. The Yo Zuri Crystal minnow did very well for us, and it was only running about 3 feet down, I'm guessing. We will also run some Rapala (size 18) floaters in 2019, and I have no doubts that we will catch walleyes within the top 10 feet of the water column in water that is very deep. Hope that helps, ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
6273374,jackpotjohnny48,2018-12-30 09:41:00,153,"Yeah, My dad and I used to always say the same thing. Back in the days when we went to LOTW for musky fishing, we got to the point where we spent our days basically relaxing and messing around with smallmouth bass. But when 7 pm came around, then we started to get serious about musky fishing, and most of our musky efforts were from 7 to 11 pm. We did just as well fishing this small, 4 hour window, as we had previously done fishing all day. That evening window of ""prime time"" is definitely something special."
6273396,Beer King,2018-12-30 12:13:00,146,"Appreciate the additional details John. We have dabbled at this pattern for several years. I believe the very biggest fish in these kinds of clear, deepwater lakes are most available by doing this. Before dark when its calm you likely observed schools of baitfish jumping over the deep water - no doubt what is causing that :-). Have never gone way late into the night, may try that sometime but after long day on the water a nice campfire and such takes priority. The best we have done is maybe half dozen fish in the last hour or two before dark. There are times we don't get any. I did talk to a group on the lake once - they do all their fishing from dark to dawn, trolling crank baits. Said they can't find fish during the day so its the only way they can get em and that they do quite well. Fortunately we have good daytime fishing so don't have to go to that extreme. Good Luck Dan"
