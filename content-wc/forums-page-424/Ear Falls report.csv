1452774,SinOrSwim,2012-06-22 15:00:00,1528,"I don't understand why people have to bag on others whether they fished in the rain or not? Some of us go up to fish and just relax. I have absolutely NO desire to fish in really crappy weather. Have I fished in the rain? Sure. Do I always? Nope. Then again we don't do a full week because I have no interest in fishing that many days in a row. Sometimes a rainy day where we stay inside, drink beer and play poker is just what the Dr. ordered."
1452816,lcwhit,2012-06-22 16:54:00,104,"canada is always a crapshoot re the weather. i've been rained on every day. one august it never got out of the 50s. i've been so hot, so cold and so wet i can't believe it. but i always go back. love that place. i don't like fishing in the rain, but i'll do it if they are biting. i did sit in the cabin one day in 10 years, just couldn't face another day wet. i'll usually fiddle around nearby goose bay camp. we always go in july or august or both. don't believe i've ever had a week that we did not get wet at least once and get blown off lac seul at least one day if not two."
1452899,trapper_john,2012-06-22 21:19:00,83,My wife and I have been going to Kingfisher on Wabbie for a number of years. We hardly ever hit the water before nine in the morning. Never fish after five. We catch more than enough fish to keep us happy andwe just relax and enjoy the time up there. To each his own. What ever blows your skirt up.
1453239,wallydave,2012-06-24 05:18:00,2151,"Well we are back home now from our trip to Goose Bay! If you only consider the numbers of fish caught as a rating for a trip North, then this trip would be a bummer. A couple of days when we all took turns getting skunked! Our group still had a good time! Our biggest walleyes went 26,25.5 and several solid slot fish. A couple of slot pike while jigging walleye and we got a couple of meals with jumbo perch too! Andrea was saying three out of the four week season had very wet weeks and very slow fishing. We did have moments where the bite turned on, one fish after another but it was one or two then nothing. Everyone at camp no matter where they tried had much luck this week. The Rapids and the mouth of the Wenasaga were our best spots right off the bottom chart, pink and sunburst seemed to be best with minnows and leeches. On the way home everyone we spoke to reported bad weather and slow fishing! Hopefully things will settle down. Stay safe and good fishing!"
1453385,KTroller,2012-06-24 12:20:00,237,"Also had slower fishing this year in the Ear Falls area, though not as bad as two years ago. Rising water and a mayfly hatch along with north and east winds made things tough. Made the trip to McKenzie bay three times and had good success there in a number of areas. Had rough rides on three of the legs and three where it wasn't bad. Definitely worth it to get away from all the boats in the sanctuary area.Still a great week and fun to get away from the everyday grind.KT"
1450213,wallydave,2012-06-17 07:13:00,2151,We got to Goose Bay Camp in time to get settled in and in time for thunder storms! That's life eh! In the evening the rains stopped and went out. We caught a few walleye and perch. Cloudy again this am.
1450252,WalleyeWally28,2012-06-17 08:13:00,298,"Thanks for the report. We will be fishing the same areas next week. Looking forward to more reports, if you have time."
1450966,wallydave,2012-06-18 19:46:00,2151,"A great Fathers Day of fishing!! A few showers in the am. We caught enough walleye and perch for a nice dinner. A sunny afternoon to relax on the deck after our big lunch. A pretty good way to spend a Fathers Day!!! A Cold Blue and a cigar while looking at the Lac!! The Rapids and the mouth of the river were good to us. The rapids are a long time favorite spot, that we haven't been able fish for a couple of years. Cold windy and thunderstorms made for a tough day. Some sun for Tuesday sure sounds good!! Thanks to Steve for the jigs!!"
1450970,Pooch,2012-06-18 19:52:00,4619,"Received an email from Tom and Rick (You met them at BP with me a couple weeks ago) and they are working for fish on Savant as we speak. Weather spanking them and everyone else making fishing or just staying on the lake work. The fish taste better if you have to ""earn"" them.Have a good trip and keep the reports coming. Stay safe.Poochj"
1451924,wallydave,2012-06-20 19:31:00,2151,"The weather man missed today's forecast, thankfully!! The morning was slow, after a lunch break we hit the water again. We caught enough for dinner. The mid day rains came after dinner, so we will try again in the am. Even with the slow fishing, it is still good to sit on the deck with a beer, cigar and listen to the eagle and the loon and listen to the silence. PS.Pooch we were wondering if anyone else was facing tough fishing. When we invest so much planning, and dreaming about our trips, and the weather doesn't cooperate its gets frustrating. Fishing is all about adapting and making the best out of the situation!"
1451942,Guest,2012-06-20 20:07:00,0,"The fish bite in the rain! Go get after it unless it's thundering and lighting. Did you really drive all that way to look @ the lake from the cabin?? Some of my best days have been fishing in the rain. I can remember one two weeker when there was only 1.5 days that the rain suit came off the entire trip. Soggy sandwiches suck but I'd rather be out fishing than thinking about it! If the lake is to rough you can catch fish around the island and reef just SW of camp. There is a hump between the island in front of the camp and the small island just to the south (the timber will get you close to the area). Tops out between the two islands around 6'. Found fish on either side of the hump. Also in Goose bay is rock wall due east of Whitewing resort that holds fish. That same shoreline to the east past the cove where the cottage is is a small bay that has a Large rock sitting out in the middle. Have caught fish there as well. On the east side of the island in front of the camp I've caught a 26"" walleye a few years back. These spots I hit after dinner or if the weather is real questionable and have produced fish. Then you can always go fish below the dam in Ear Falls. Ca be really good place to catch em. Hope these couple of spots can get you out close to camp to catch a few.. Lookin for more reports... I'll be back in 8 days."
1451992,lunker99,2012-06-20 21:40:00,236,"We were up there last week, had plenty of rain then too! Traditional spring spots produced a few fish for us, but not very many nice ones. Started fishing our summer spots in 12-18 ft of water and found more and nicer fish. Sanctuary opened up our last day up there and saw a few nice fish caught near the falls, but we didn't stay up in there long."
1452025,fLyInOnH20,2012-06-21 05:08:00,15,Sorry the reef is SE of camp. Has a green buoy marking it.
1452547,mpSnagger,2012-06-22 06:54:00,31,Can you advise me of any road constuction bettween International falls to ear falls.Thanks
1452767,wallydave,2012-06-22 14:53:00,2151,"We did fish in the rain Thursday day!! The best day yet, and we did fish in the rain!! Thunder did keep us close to camp!! We did catch enough to eat and take some home!! Despite the weather and tough fishing it has been a good trip. The Canada trips are much more than just the fishing!!! Time away in the Bush with loons cry the eagles overhead and the sky that seems to have no end!! Sure great fishing always helps! But its the time away with nothing but nature and friend's and family that count!!"
