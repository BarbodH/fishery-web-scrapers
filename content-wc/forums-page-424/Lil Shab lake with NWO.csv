1452319,Bandit81,2012-06-21 14:48:00,8,"I'm part of a group headed to Lil Shab Lake with NOrthern Wilderness outfitters in August. Just hoping to find someone on here that has fished this lake at all? Ideas on what kind of tackle is best, how much bait we should get, and any other 'must haves' that you think a guy would need? I have found some reports, but they are 5 years old. Any info would be greatly apppreciated! Thanks!"
1452796,garybur,2012-06-22 15:54:00,1,We've fished this lake many times. Great numbers for good sized Walleyes. My buddy got a 9 pounder there. Lots of big Northerns. Anywhere there is a tree in the water is a guaranteed Northern. The lake is full of reefs and that is where we concentrated our fishing. We used 1/8 and 1/4 oz jigs with tubes and twisters. A little pinch of a crawler or some Gulp for flavor will produce on the reefs. Be prepared to tie on some jigs as there are a lot of rocks that hold on and you'll get a ton of bite offs too. For shear numbers of fish I don't know of a better lake. I think you made a great choice if you like catching a lot of fish.
1453756,Bandit81,2012-06-25 09:34:00,8,Hey that's great to hear....I know they say it's 'fast fishing' which normally means a lot of fish but the size isn't real big. Awesome that your buddy got a 9lber though! I have also heard that the north end of the lake has way better fishing than the south? Was that case with you guys too? Have you been there in August? I'm wondering how deep the fish will be then or if they will be shallow? How many crawlers do you say a guy should bring per day? Thanks for the response Garybur....I appreciate the help!

I don't know if this is your first trip with Vic and NWO or not but he runs a first class operation. Brad, Chris and Brian are great pilots and will point you in the right direction if need be. Ask the party leaving what worked for them and where. That's the best info you can get. Kinda looks like it's pretty much north or south of the cabin. In August, you will probably want to look for deeper water and fish mid-lake reefs and humps. They may be in shallower in moving water. As far as crawlers go, my group brings up a flat of crawlers (aprox. 500) for 8 people. We also bring about 2 pounds of leeches as well. I also brought 5 doz. homemade salted minnows for my own use and they worked great as well. Always lookin for a secret weapon. On my trip to Wabakimi this year I was extremely pleased with Captain Redbeard Jigs. 3/16oz. and 1/4 oz. in pink was killer. http://www.capnredbeards.com/newww.html With Lil Shab being a catch and consume lake, should be some fantastic fishing in store for your group. Good luck to you."
