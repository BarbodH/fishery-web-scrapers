We rented a boat that was in very good shape with a 60 HP 4 cycle engine. Fishing was outstanding with 10 walleyes over 20 inches the 2 biggest were 27 inches and many more in the slot. We had many Northers in the 30's with the biggest being 37 inches. We had 5 Muskys the biggest being 48 inches 2 37's a 38 and a baby 19 inches. Even though it rained every day, at sometime, fishing was great."

One day was like old times, but the rest were pretty slow. We are guessing it was the weather, which was the worst we have ever had there. Did get a 30 1/4 and two 28 inchers though. Some days it was hard to even get slot fish. We are writing it off as just an unusual year for us."
1450549,camp chef,2012-06-18 07:36:00,915,"Well I am back from a week on the Winnipeg River. We had a wonderful time and some great fishing despite a Mayfly hatch.The water is a little lower that usual for this time of the year and the flow was at a minimum so not a lot of current although it did pick up a little through out the week. It rained a lot and we had 6 inches on Saturday.Although we had a mayfly hatch there was no black flies,no seeums or skeeters the whole week. We did manage 50 or so walleyes with the largest being 26 in. We caught over 150 northerns with 6 or 7 over 15 lbs and one around 18 #s. We hooked up with 3 muskies. the biggest one in the boat was probably just shy of 25# and the biggest one....50 inch class... broke free during a tail dance right next to the boat. The 25# bit after 2 different follows earlier in the week. We did catch probably 8 or 9 bass during the week and a handful of big perch. All fish returned to the river. Other sightings include many deer (1 swimmer) several foxes, mink,and many Eagles.This fishery just keeps getting better."
1450573,Slashorn,2012-06-18 08:27:00,19,Thanks for the report! Sounds like you had a great time. Our group is going up July 13 for week staying in Minaki. Could you indicated what areas you thought had better success than others? Did you fish mainly north of the tracks or south? I can't wait to get up there.
1450577,camp chef,2012-06-18 08:30:00,915,We fish exclusively south of the train tressle. By mid july the walleyes should be on the reefs.

1452708,camp chef,2012-06-22 13:03:00,915,Actually those are Canadian Crayfish that we caught off the dock
1452756,briand,2012-06-22 14:31:00,48,Glad it was a good trip.I honestly can't remember fishing more then once or twice south of the bridge all the years I've been going.
1452783,camp chef,2012-06-22 15:24:00,915,There is definately a lot of water to choose from that's for sure.
