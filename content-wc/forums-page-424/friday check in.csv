1452485,BennieS,2012-06-21 21:41:00,108,"Just curious, why the change at a number of resorts to a Friday check in Friday check out? Seems awckward and would require taking another precious vacation day in my case. There must be a good reason for it but i've never seen it discussed. Anyone know?"
1452491,spikeidji,2012-06-21 22:11:00,10,Crossing the Border on a Saturday may be one reason.
1452511,adempsey,2012-06-22 00:07:00,963,"I assumed it's because the outfitter charters a separate air service that is also chartered by other resorts, or in the case of a place like Air Ivanhoe, they have so many outposts and not enough planes [which wouldn't be efficient either if they did] they need to stagger everyone out.Not all that fond of the Friday to Friday either. My trip this year is exactly that, but the week includes a statutory holiday so it's not as bad."
1452517,Pooch,2012-06-22 03:58:00,4619,"We have moved all our trip dates to avoid border crossings on Saturday or a holiday. Did that years ago whenever it worked out with the camp owners. Finally went to camps that are flexible on dates.Still, if we like a camp we will put up with a week end crossing. Just hit the border at off hours and that helps. Sometimes (most) that's not possible.Pooch"
1452771,2746,2012-06-22 14:55:00,3206,I don't get it either and it has caused us to eliminate some lodges on Lac Seul we used. On the other hand these owners aren't dumb so it mut be working for some guests. We have several in our group that need to fit it within a Mon - Friday week.
1452790,camp chef,2012-06-22 15:48:00,915,We always try to get in Friday and leave friday.Travel on Thursday and get better motel room rates for a Thursday stay and then have less traffic crossing the border both ways on friday.
1452795,luv2fishcanada,2012-06-22 15:54:00,41,"Here is my take on the Friday check in and why it works great for me. I have been going to Golden Hook Camp on Gullrock for 25+ years. The current owners still have the Saturday check in but allow us to arrive in camp Friday night preferrably after 7:00 PM. Here's why this works so well and is one of the reasons I will never leave Golden Hook. Taking an extra day of vacation to be able to drive all day Friday (12 hrs. for me) during the daylight is well worth it. Pull into camp Friday night, unpack, and get a great nights sleep. Up at 0630, check in at 0700 Saturday and fishing by 0730. We check out Friday morning at 0800 and again the drive home is during the daylight hours. Crossing the border on Friday's is usually very quick. Technically we are not checking in on Friday's but Bill and Maureen let us arrive then. Plus on Saturday morning not all groups from the other resorts are out fishing yet. Might have wrecked a good thing will this post. In the 80's and early 90's I remember driving all night and arriving barely with eyes open and thankfully no moose dents. This current way is perfect for me."

Then lodge owner has just a bit more time to handle all the transitional kaos (sp). Same money coming in, less money going out. Sort of like the food manufacturers keeping same size packaging but putting less product inside."
