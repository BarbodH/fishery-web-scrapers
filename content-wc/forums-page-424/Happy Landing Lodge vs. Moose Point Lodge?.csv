518254,Guest,2002-04-07 10:43:00,0,I am the dock boy there. Matt has one of the nicest camps i have ever seen. I would know because i live on rainy lake. All the cabins are electric ans heated. everyone is there to plaese you.
518255,Guest,2002-04-07 18:27:00,0,As a dock boy are you also a fishing guide? Have you fished much into Shistose Lake? Do you find that most of the clients that stay there fish primarily up on that end of the lake or are they venturing down in the areas where Cedar Lodge and Pipestone Lodge are Located?
518256,HLLGuide,2002-04-07 19:08:00,10,"I guide up there. It really depends on what you want to fish for. I fish everything all over the place but there are certain species of fish that I will go into Schistose for, although most of the time I won't have to go that far up. I do venture down towards the other resorts once in a while, but usually I like to stay out of their way. There is fish all over on that lake and there is no sense on crowding someone else. Are you coming up our way this year?Guide"
518257,Guest,2002-04-09 14:01:00,0,Only some times i got to guide but not to much more this year. Guest go any where they want.in the spring some people go to shistose. We got 13 lakes so people don't get to go to all the lakes we got.
1338178,IMT00FIERCE,2011-08-07 17:39:00,8,"This thread is long dead, but I have some interesting information. If you are talking about Moose Point Lodge on shikag lake, as a guide for that Camp I recommend it. Funny thing about Moose Point is that the Owner Brad, looked into buying Happy Landings and Moose Point Lodge, decided the Fly-In was the route to go to have a phenomenal fishery. Happy Landing went out of business this year, so he took the right route. Brad also set-up one of the First Catch and Release policies. This ensures that the 30inch walleyes that spawn huge amounts will keep the population high and also may even get caught a year or two later at 31 or 32 inches. On Shikag an average day of fishing will net you 100 walleyes a person and trophys do get caught often."

Have you heard of a guide named Hat or is he still there?I can answer that question for you, Hat passed away a few years ago. We were all sad to hear of him going, he really knew the fish in Shikag. He'd go out Guiding and in the morning he'd say, Well I figure we'll catch a 40inch Northern Today. He'd come back in the afternoon and say, well we didn't catch 40, we got a 45! Yeah and Ted's Lake is still their, the portage doesn't get used very often though as the walleye fishing in Shikag has gotten so amazing it isn't quite worth the hassel, unless you like the adventure. If it's been 20 years since you've been up the fishing has changed a lot for the better, and the camp has gotten nicer as well. On the Ted side of things. Did you ever hear the story of when he wrestled the muzzled and declawed black bear at the All Canada show? I have a question for you. Did you ever catch and Smallmouth Bass while you were up at Shikag? MPL Guide David"
1453011,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-23 09:01:00,1460,"Hey David, This is a hard story for me to admit to on this forum. When I set up my trip with Vic at NWO, I specifically told him that I did not want a guide as I was on my honeymoon. When we arrive at Moose Point and as I departed the plane, the guides are getting introduced to their new clients. This man came up to me and said ""My name is Hat and I shall be your guide this week."" Without even thinking, I replied ""Sorry Hat, I specifically set this trip for no guide. Did you not get the word?"" Well, ole Hat spun around and marched off visibly upset. I don't think that I even tipped him a dime as I was upset that I was even in this predicament. I regret that decision and how I handled it to this day. It was a decision based on pride as I envisioned myself as a mighty know-it-all Canadian fly-in angler who had nothing more to learn. In my mind, I thought that I could teach Hat a thing or two. What a self-absorbed maroon I was! The first night back at the lodge, everyone is talking about their conquests of the day and I soon figured out that we were getting outfished by the guided guests. I had no electronics, just an unmarked map. Was runnin and gunnin all over the lake just fishing blindly on this lake. On the second night, Ted Davis pulls me aside and takes me to the map on the wall. Ted says, ""Bill, you take your new bride here! Ted's Lake. You will catch many fish here."" Well, first thing the next morning, we take the easy portage into Ted's Lake all prepared to catch walleye. I was armed with minnows and crawlers that I was tipping my jig with. Now as I try to remember, Ted's Lake is a small inland lake without much structure to it. I think there were small trickle inlets on either end of the lake. Man, let me tell ya that I have never experienced such fast walleye action in my life. Still haven't! It did not take long before we quit tipping our jigs with meat as we just couldn't get our jigs to the bottom. I remember that we were using Fussy Grubs at that time and the walleye would eat the bodies off these jigs after about a 100 fish per hour pace. It was even hard to get a bare jig down to the bottom. I do not think that of all those fish, any were over 17"", but that did not matter as I had saved face. Ted Davis knew and I respected him for it. When in camp, I could not get enough of Ted and Faye Davis. I loved to listen to this legend of a man speak. I found out on this trip that it was Ted who built the outpost camp on Wabakimi (as well as many others) that my people just cherish. He would talk of his traplines and how he would check them with his 180 Cessna on skies. He was such a fine gentleman that it was hard to get him to speak about himself. He always wanted to learn about you. To me, he reminded me of the Canadian version of Brian Dennehy. Faye was known for the homemade breads and pies she would make everyday. The food was truly spectacular. She was friendly gracious and quiet. And finally David, no I haven't caught any smallies on Shikag nor do I remember anyone else talking about catching any. In my 40+ years of Canadian fishing, I have never caught a smallmouth bass. Again, I do not profess to be a great angler, just do not question my passion for fishing in Ontario. To anyone who might be interested in going to Moose Point Lodge. Please don't make the same mistakes I made. Use the guides provided. Since I have been there, ownership has changed and I think for the betterment of this amazing fishery. The only fish that are killed are to be consumed and not brought home. Moose Point is the opposite of what I have been used to. I am used to ""roughing it"" in an outpost camp. I think Moose Point Lodge is like the ""Holiday Inn"" of the great north with many amenities I've been unaccustomed to such as maid service. It is the ultimate place for those who do not wish to rough it and do want abundant trophy fish."

I want a guided lodge with new or improved facilities, great staff and steady fishing. NOT concerned about trophies. I want lots of quality fising for the kids. I am close to booking with either Happy Landing Lodge OR Moose Point Lodge. Do you have any comments? Do you have a better lodge idea? Best week to book trip after June 21, 2003?Thanks,DAVID PWISCONSIN"
518245,Guest,2002-03-18 19:15:00,0,"I took a 5 night guided trip to happy landing lodge last year, It was a family trip with my dad, my brother, and my son. This was our sixth trip to canada over the last ten years and this was by far our best trip. We went in august last year and we caught lots of walleyes on the reefs, pike all over, bass on the rocky shorelines, and we even caught two muskies. Our guides were professional, very knowledgable with the water, always kept us on fish (my son in very immpatient, needs to be active), and cooked a great shorelunch.We stayed in cabin two, a very nice 4 person cabin with two seperate bedrooms and a shower and bathroom in each bedroom.The lodge was beautiful, the food was good, and the staff was great. I highly reccommend this lodge to anybody who is looking for a great american plan lodge with good fishing.We'll be back this august with 7-8 guys."

518249,Fitch,2002-03-22 21:40:00,75,I was at Happy Landing last summer with a large crew and had a great time. Fishing was good and the service was unbelivable. Wish it was as good at home!! Ha! Ha!. I am taking my 7 year old and going with a buddie and his kids. Can't get 7 days off work but will go for 4. You will have a great time.
518250,Guest,2002-03-24 13:09:00,0,"If your looking for a good place with top of the line guides, you should check out ross' camp. Thats where the people from happy landing lodge pick up there guests, so you'll be in the same area.Ross' is a very nice place to stay and the staff is excellent. Just check it out before you book a trip to anywhere else.www.rosscamp.com"
518251,Guest,2002-03-25 13:00:00,0,"I also stayed at Happy Landing Last year and we parked at Ross' and Ross' worked great for parking my car. Happy Landing is 28 miles and three lakes from Ross' so you are only fishing the same water if you travel that far everyday. Also Ross' is on Clearwater along with many many cottages and other resorts vs Happy Landing is remote with 12 other lakes that they can also fish, many of these lakes they are the only ones that can have a boat on that lake. The eating hours are more flexable at Happy Landing and as far as I am concerned the guides are way better also."
518252,Guest,2002-03-25 21:09:00,0,"Have any of you been to Pipestone Lodge in the last year or so? You pass it on your way to Happy Landing Lodge. Saves you about 8-10 miles of water travel from your car, but some of the better fishing is up near the top of the lake. We have always found plenty of good fishing spots before the narrows which is closer to Pipestone Lodge.Mainly wondering about current service at Pipestone Lodge since it's been about 12 years and three owners ago.guide#7 out"
518253,Guest,2002-04-03 21:13:00,0,"Yes, I know of the Pipestone Lodge Owners. I was a fishing guide on this chain of lakes for a year and would stop there when I was in need of gas from working a long day on my own up there. Pipestone Lodge owners were very pleasant and I knew a guide by the name of Darcy who became a school teacher and may still do some guiding up there on his summers. It seems like their lodge has a good reputation of getting good anglers in and getting them on fish. Myself, I feel like it would be nice to stay at Happy Landing as it is a lot nicer facility and they have an excellent reputation up there for I also knew a guide that was on the system for 30 years and would ""Sub"" for them every once-in-a-while and would have very good success on mixed bags of fish. This is a very versatile system of water to fish for many species but can be quite difficult on the sunny days due to the gin clear water. Hope you have lotsa luck in the future and enjoy that portage ride over the big HILL! FISHIN' MORTICIAN!"
