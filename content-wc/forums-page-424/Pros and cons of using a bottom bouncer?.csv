It is a great system to troll spinner harnesses or crank baits. Also great to drift a simple hook loaded up with a fat leach or minnow. These things let you get as complicated or as simple as needed."
1453899,Behle,2012-06-25 14:19:00,51,"A rule of thumb is to use 1 oz of weight for every 10 feet. We just returned from fishing in very windy and rough conditions. Our bouncers allowed us to fish water that those with jigs couldn't get down to. One tip for when you do get hung up is to ""banjo"" the line. As the line is tight, pull line from just in front of the reel about 2 feet away from the rod. Quickly let go and the resulting snap often gets the bouncer out from the crack or crevice. Always keeping the rod up when doing this also."
1453338,Bozotheclown,2012-06-24 09:46:00,15,I have read articles on the use of a bottom bouncer.What has been yourexperience?I will be fishing Eagle Lake in August and would you reommendthe bouncer?THANKS
1453344,Red Pine J,2012-06-24 10:01:00,44,"So, I'm no help in regards to Eagle Lake. I did prefer bouncers to chain weights when back-trolling. I'd say my ""pro"" of the bouncer would be less hang-ups compared to say a chain type weight. Good luck in August!!!!!!!!! RPJ"
1453345,adempsey,2012-06-24 10:01:00,963,"Love them. Trolling them around covers a lot of water.Pencil weights and three-way rigs are an alternative as well.If you like to drift, Lindy rigs are great too. I'd imagine you could troll with them too, never tried.Never fished Eagle, but the only time I wouldn't be using a bouncer is if there are a lot of rocks, weeds or stumps to deal with."
1453392,JayM5209,2012-06-24 12:39:00,1050,"You gotta have them!! Take a variety of sizes and use enough weight to keep in touch with the bottom, but not so much that every rock crevice you pass grabs a bouncer. I use mostly 3/8 oz. as the all around bouncer, but always have some 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, and several 3/4 or 1 oz. for drifting or back trolling the really deep stuff. I think some people go heavier but 1 oz. or 1 1/2 oz. is as heavy as I go. Some of the Eagle lake pros here will give better advice than I can."
1453418,2746,2012-06-24 14:04:00,3206,"I thought the biggest pro for a bouncer is the snag free aspect so I'd be tempted to use them around rocks etc and when the bottom is more free of snags go to a lindy rig. The biggest negative, for me, is they are more difficult to ""feel"" the bottom compared to a sliding weight like a lindy. (just my experience)"
1453422,Guest,2012-06-24 14:12:00,0,"I use lindys when it is calm, or when the fish are in a negative mood and go with the bottom bouncer when it gets windy and the fish are more active"
1453425,lcwhit,2012-06-24 14:25:00,104,"in august the fish should be in the 20-30 foot range. so take 1 to 2 oz bouncers. i use the straight wire not the l shaped. as you become proficient at it, you can walk right through rocks and up and down humps. must maintain contact with the bottom and then lift it up slightly. keep checking for the bottom periodically and let out line and take it up as needed. just dragging those things around the bottom will cost you lots of money and time retieing. try to maintain a 45 degree angle with your line, get away from that and its trouble. adjust boat speed or weight to do so. i always have drift socks on board to slow the boat. use the quick change clevises also."
1453471,adempsey,2012-06-24 17:03:00,963,"Sorry, yes that is true compared to a three way or slip sinker. I just meant if it's really rocky (i.e., rocks are larger than the bouncer) or quick depth changes. I've snagged my bottom bouncers MANY times."
1453654,Bigfishhunter,2012-06-25 06:07:00,803,"I live in the canadian shield territory, and while the majority of people here jig for eyes, I like to use BB's during certain times of the year (late/mid summer), and on certain bodies of water, and certain structures (mid lake humps). I backtroll in a tiller boat when I pull my BB's, so being that I am running the boat, I will use a heavier bouncer than the rest of the people in the boat. The reason for this is that I want to be more vertical so that I am not getting tanlged up with other peoples lines. The bouncer weights will go down in increments toward the front of the boat, so the heaviest is at the back, and the lightest is at the front. (I would do the opposite if front trolling with a bow mount) Of course this isn't as necessary if you only have 2-3 in your boat, but I often have 5 in mine, so trolling is a bit of an art and everyone needs to be in control. I don't have any issues catching fish while trolling with the heavy weight directly under the boat (sometimes in shallow water too)."
1453683,bassface44,2012-06-25 07:18:00,96,I also use the pencil style and not the L shaped ones. With the pencil style I clip the wire so it is close to the weight to have better bottom contact. I also use 1oz exclusively and add and subtract rubber core sinkers to the top portion of wire as conditions dictate. As previously mentioned I find the key is to keep the rig just off the bottom and drop back every once in a while to make contact and make sure you are where you need to be. You will save a lot of bouncers that way. I used the same weight last year for our entire trip and we use bouncers and spinner rigs pretty frequently while we are up in Canada.
