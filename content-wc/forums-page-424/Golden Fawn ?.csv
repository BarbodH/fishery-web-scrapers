Guys in the cabin next to us at Gold Pines last week was supposed to be over there but found out she wasn't open when they called to confirm two weeks prior. Scrambled around and got into the camp we were at last minute. Shame to see that nice spot on the lake go downhill like that. We drove down there one night and nothing was mowed up, all docks and boats were on the shore. Heard Pope got a nice pike last week."
