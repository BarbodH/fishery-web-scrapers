Jigged reefs mostly, but, ran all the way to Miles Bay for the most consistent bight.Didn't catch any in places we had in the past. Still caught a lot of fish but wound up throwing for musky on the days we didn't want to go all the way to Miles. My question is, what's the best locating tool for that time of year. Mid July? Thanks for all the help. Like to keep the wife and boys in the fish. Slushfish"
