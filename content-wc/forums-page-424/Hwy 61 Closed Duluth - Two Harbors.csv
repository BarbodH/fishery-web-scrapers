1453708,Lovetofish,2012-06-25 08:03:00,458,Were you able to get through Cloquet on 33?
1453924,rather-be-fishin,2012-06-25 15:16:00,429,Hwy 33 North out of Cloquet to Hwy 53 is OPEN now. It's amazing how fast the water has gone down. Safe travels everyone and happy fishin!
1452151,Mr Ranger,2012-06-21 09:08:00,272,I just talked to one of my Dealers and he said you can get from Duluth to Two Harbors and beyond on Hwy 61. There is one detour for sure off to scenic 61. There may be some delays in Duluth as well but sounds like it is doable Duluth to Thunder Bay.
1452191,jiggster,2012-06-21 10:32:00,183,Go HW 33 to International Falls Closed. They have post a great map. Looks like Grand Rapids / Hibbing route is open. Can keep updated there.
1452567,Guest,2012-06-22 07:28:00,0,I'm from duluth and now live in thunder bay. I would highly recommend AGAINST going the I'falls way especially if you are going to thunder bay and nipigon. It is WAY out of your way.
1452596,smbrickner,2012-06-22 08:56:00,276,From what I am seeing international falls to Sioux Lookout is still ok though right?
1452663,Guest,2012-06-22 11:30:00,0,"Leaving northeast Wisconsin tomorrow morning for the Nipigon, On area. We typically go through Duluth and take 61 to border. We could go through St. Sault Marie, but will take us 3 hours longer. What do you guys think? Looking at the MN DOT website it looks like the only detour is Knife River. Thanks"
1452886,guidedfishing,2012-06-22 20:43:00,531,"just came thru on 61 from Pigeon River to Duluth, Main high 61 is closed bridge is washed out between two harbors and duluth. No problem traffic is re-routed on old / scenic 61 thru Knife River. Added 10 mins to the trip not an issue. You can see the mud line extended at least 2 miles out into Lake Superior. They must of really go the water trees and stumps washed up on to bridges that are now 20 feet above the water line. No problem on travel they have it under control. good luck GF"
1452952,phishfearme,2012-06-23 06:12:00,1242,"thanks for the first hand report!! we'll be driving thru knife river on monday and this is a ""load off"" for our threatened travel plans. phish"
1453246,Further North,2012-06-24 05:55:00,2008,"Duluth was easy yesterday, but we went up to Int'll Falls (we 're fishing a couple hours west of Thunder Bay and it's about the same distance either way for us).High water along 53, north to Int'll Falls, but no bad road conditions anywhere along our trip."
1453294,wallydave,2012-06-24 08:04:00,2151,We came through Duluth on Saturday high water in the area but the roads were open coming from I Falls.
1453676,Mike Kansas,2012-06-25 07:01:00,1463,"wallydave, We are headed up thursday. Are there detours around Duluth on the way to Int Falls? I assume that 33 through Cloquet is a no go. Would you be kind enough to send me a PM with instructions on what route we should go. Thanks, Mike Kansas"
1452042,Mr Ranger,2012-06-21 05:50:00,272,I am checking to see if anyone has a reliable source for road closing in Duluth. Current report is that Hwy 61 is closed from Duluth to Two Harbors due to floods. We are headed up on Friday to Thunder Bay and then Nipigon and from what I am reading no one can get up to Canada or back until it reopens. Any status of the road would be appreciated. Thanks
1452048,Sidge61,2012-06-21 06:09:00,59,"From what I heard it is scenic hwy. 61 that is closed at Knife River, not the main hwy 61 that runs to Two Harbors."
1452052,Sidge61,2012-06-21 06:13:00,59,"As of 6:15 a.m., Highways 2/53 at the Nemadji River in Superior reportedly were open, but with water on the road and some lane restrictions.Highway 33 closed at White Pine River north of CloquetHighway 61 Expressway closed at Knife River with detour in place; Scenic 61 reportedly is open to Two Harbors.Highway 61 open at Silver Creek Tunnel, with shoulder damageHighway 53 is now open past the Miller Hill Mall.Highway 2 open from Proctor west.Highway 23 closed at Fond du LacHighway 210 closed through Jay Cooke State ParkHighway 210 closed east of McGregorHighway 65 closed south of McGregorHighway 73 closed west of Moose LakeHighway 73 and County 61 closed at Moose Lake"
1452060,phishfearme,2012-06-21 06:31:00,1242,sidge - thanks for the highway info - is there a site from which this is updated periodically? phish
1452069,worthsr,2012-06-21 06:54:00,52,"I found this information on the MN DOT websitehttp://www.dot.state.mn.us/ Flooding in DuluthÂ—(last updated 7:30 a.m., 6-21-12) Take care driving in and around Duluth. Flooding is making many roads hazardous. The following highways are closed: I-35 between Carlton and Mahtowa Hwy 2 from Floodwood to Brookston Hwy 2 from I-35 to Boundary Avenue in Proctor Hwy 2 from the Iron Horse Bar and Grill to the golf course Hwy 23 south of Duluth Hwy 23 in Fond Du Lac Hwy 33 near Independence Hwy 33 from White Pine River to North of Cloquet Hwy 61 at Knife River Hwy 65 south of McGregor Hwy 73 west of Moose Lake Hwy 200 between Hwy 2 and Hwy 65 Hwy 210 completely closed through Jay Cooke State Park Hwy 210 four miles east of McGregor More information will come as we get it."
1452080,smbrickner,2012-06-21 07:09:00,276,I am leaving Midnight Friday after I swing through and pick up my Brother in Eau Claire. Wonder if I will be better off heading north from the cities? Instead of Duluth? Or do I just trust that there will be a detour?
1452132,81Saluki,2012-06-21 08:34:00,97,"I was just looking into this issue as I will be heading up mid next week. You can get a MN DOT map showing closures, etc. at the link below:http://hb.511mn.org/main.jsf I've already started planning an alternate, more ""scenic"" route from the Twin Cities to I-Falls (takes me past Mille Lacs Lake, through Grand Rapids, then on to I-Falls from the west). 81Saluki"
1452139,jiggster,2012-06-21 08:53:00,183,"I called and talked to the state office. I asked if I could go thru Grand Rapids up to International Falls, they said NO. I talked with the Brainerd office, I found the only way for sure to International Falls from the cities is up 10 to 371 thru Walker, Bemidji and up 71."
1452149,UKBDM,2012-06-21 09:05:00,178,We are headed north in the AM from Indy.Looks like 169 runs from the Twin Cities to Grand Rapids and then over to Virginia. No closures as far as I can tell.Anybody have any local knowledge about this route? Bad idea?
1452150,81Saluki,2012-06-21 09:07:00,97,"Thanks Jiggster for the info! Their DOT map shows one stretch on Hwy 169 south of GR is ""difficult ... look out for flooding"" ... which I took to mean that flooding hasn't actually been reported yet. I'll keep an eye on things to see if anything changes and plan accordingly. At least I've got a few more days for the water to go down compared to anyone heading up (or coming home) this weekend. 81Saluki"
