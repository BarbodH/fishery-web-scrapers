1452759,WalleyeRip,2012-06-22 14:36:00,44,My brother says he knows a guy who says he has a cabin on Ghost Lake near Eagle lake. I have looked at all kinds of maps and cannot find a Ghost lake in that area. It is not Ghost River but Ghost lake. Anybody know anything about it or exactly where that lake is located. Thanks Rip
