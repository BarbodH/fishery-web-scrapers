1431610,Redlabel,2012-05-06 19:09:00,279,I am going to cross at Baudett into Rainy River then heading up to Morson putting in at Gills Marina. Where is the best place to buy minnows $$$? Is there any bait shops or sporting good stores in Rainy River? thanks for any information

It is off one of the side roads from hwy 621. As for which has a better price I do not know, you would have to give them a shout to see what they are charging but my guess would be Buena Vista charges less."

Don't complain or you are back to a non-baker's dozen. If you don't like the price of the minnows go ahead and buy some bacon, gas, eggs or bug spray. You'll see the minners as a bargain."
1451988,Guest,2012-06-20 21:25:00,0,Gill's Morson Marina charges $4/doz plus taxes.... seems the going rate in the area ... always have great bait when I pick them up there....
1452696,Dogbreath,2012-06-22 12:46:00,494,"Buy em where you use em....the local dealer usually sells what works in that area.VERY IMPORTANT BIG POINT - it is against the law to transfer minnows from one area to the next - its one of those ""invasive species"" things - see the attachedhttp://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...ge/198684.html"
1452714,johnboat,2012-06-22 13:14:00,2014,"I've been told, in that area it is required to keep your reciept in the boat to prove they havent been hauled in from south of the border."
1453262,Dogbreath,2012-06-24 06:38:00,494,"Keep your reciept. ???That would not be a bad idea, it could potentially save a lot of hassles, but it is not necessary, as I understand it, they would have to prove that you did not buy the minnows locally. Always a good idea to ask the local shops about any local regulations and/or what the local fish cops are looking for."
1453272,J-Man,2012-06-24 07:03:00,191,"I would certainly dispute the report of sticklebacks being sold out of our place on a regular basis. Have been times in the past that there has been some received, but they are few and far between. I personally sort through them by hand when there are too many. And if I happen to notice a stickle back or two that I didn't get out, they are always free. We have always been widely known to have had the best minnows in the area when we were supplying many of the resorts/lodges because I was willing to grade them and ensure the smallest and sticklebacks did not get in the sale tanks on a large scale basis. Minnows are a huge pain in the butt in general relative to what you make on them. There is a reason there aren't many bait shops on the Canadian side of the border. Prices are competitive at most places up in the Morson area. We don't have it like they do in MN......if we could get alot of them and they were cheap, we'd be generous with ""scoops"" instead of by the dozen. We're down to one bait delivery per week from our supplier after getting out of the harvesting business because of the hassles, having to judge the needs of a busy area based on guessing and weather. Managing bait is difficult. The Marina and us have the same supplier at the current time. What you get here and there should be very comparable.Cheers."
