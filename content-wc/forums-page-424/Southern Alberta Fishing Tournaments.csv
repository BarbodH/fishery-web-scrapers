507031,Guest,2000-02-08 16:11:00,0,i checked on this earlier this fall. as memory serves me chin had the highest win weight total of any of the sawt's. just over 30#. only a fraction separated the top 2 or 3.
507032,Guest,2000-03-13 22:40:00,0,Chin CouleeHave ben fishing this place for the last fifteen years. It produces very well from the beginning of June until at least thanksgiving. If you know the where to fish spots you will find many and very good sizes as well. Have pulled many in the 5-8 lb range from here. The largest I have seen is about 13 lbs. Lots of monster pike as well. If you need any other info send me a line.kgb
