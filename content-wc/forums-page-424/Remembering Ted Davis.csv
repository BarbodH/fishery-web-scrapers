I had my honeymoon there 20 years ago(ya I married well) He kinda reminded me of the Canadian version of Brian Dennehy and every bit as charismatic. Fasinating man.Edwin James ""Ted"" Davis passed away at his home on the Manitou at the age of 74.Ted Davis built many of the outpost camps in that area (NW Ont.) including my beloved camp on Wabakimi(NWO) in the ""70's"". I truly think Northern Wilderness Outfitters would like to upgrade this camp but for the long time clients like me who like it old school.Ted, rest in peace. You will be remembered."

Separate cabins, shower, fish cleaning, guide service, awesome home cooked chow and even maid service. When I lined up my trip with Vic @ NWO, I told him I did not want a guide, however, when I got off the plane at MP an Indian guide said to me ""Hi, my name is Hat and I will be your guide."" I said ""sorry Hat some sort of misunderstanding I requested no guide"" so I flipped him a tip and Hat sulked off knowing he will have to wait on the next group. I did feel bad. Everybody else at the lodge were using guides and doing better than my boat was and (I blame my wife) Ted Davis pulls me aside, goes to the map, points to a place and says ""Bill, you take your bride here. Ted's lake. You catch all the fish you can here."" Ted's Lake(namesake) is a short portage off Shikag with a boat and motor there. Well we started catching fish like mad, pretty soon we quit the live bait, could not get our jigs to the bottom, walleyes were chewing bodies off jigs so fast we just fished with bare jig and still barely able to get to the bottom.I was told by Hat later that Ted never sends or allows his guides to go to Teds Lake. Awesome experience and highlight of this trip"

We will miss him, the Manitou will miss him. Ted could tell a story and I always wanted to be in camp when he showed up. Ted would often show up around dinner time and always liked some of Betty Lou's home made deserts. He died on the waters he lived on, made a living on, and loved. He will be missed. I am going to the lower Manitou July 22nd for a week and can hardly believe Ted won't be there plying the waters in his 20 foot alaskan blasting through shallows and cutting corners I never would. I think he knew every square foot of the lower and upper manitou. God Bless you Ted and may you rest in peace."
