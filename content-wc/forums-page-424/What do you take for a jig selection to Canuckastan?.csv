I'm sure we'll do some vertical jigging on the trip.Is a 100 of each size and color enough?Thanks.Bill"
1453347,SinOrSwim,2012-06-24 10:04:00,1528,Either you are staying for a LONG time or you need to learn how to tie a better knot.
1453348,adempsey,2012-06-24 10:05:00,963,"Are you really going to lose 500+ jigs to snags and bite-offs in a couple of weeks?? Seems like overkill to me, but I tend to bring way more than I need as well."
1453349,NathanH,2012-06-24 10:06:00,697,Thats an amazing number of jigs. It could take a 3 lifetimes to go through that many using braided line.
1453405,joeman79,2012-06-24 13:22:00,417,"I think last 2 yrs ago on Lac Seul I lost between 20-30 jigs total in 6 full days of fishing. I don't even have a 100 jigs total in my box. We just about started using pretty much 3/8 exclusively and have had great luck. Pink, Chrt, Gold, Orange and Blue have been our best colors."
1453413,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-24 13:41:00,235,"Be prepared to up to lose six to eight jigs per day per person. It will hopefully be less than that, but man those rocks are everywhere. Over seven days this would be 49-56 jigs per person. Make sure you have at least that many plus 10 in each weight. No need to be that deep in each weight AND color (but then again, I'm not a big believe in color). It's probably overkill, but rather err on that side than wish you had more during a hot bite."
1453428,pikeman14,2012-06-24 14:47:00,144,"I have also been pouring jigs for next year, but I was going to make less than that for 5 guys. It seemed like a great idea at the time, since I can get lead for free. But its not as fun as it looks."

1453441,Bill Krejca,2012-06-24 15:20:00,6107,"I've found that most rock snags can be unsnagged using the following process: - After determining you are snagged, grab the line and snap it. Most folks I've observed hold the line tight and try snapping the tight line, like playing a banjo. Instead, give out enough slack that your rod can be sat down. - Take the line in both hands, grab it (say with right hand) an arm length ahead of you. - Place the line that is in back of the held line and hold it (say with left hand), bringing it up at 90 degrees to the tight line. - Snap the line with the right hand. This should be done in such a manner that the line is stretched somewhat - mono stretches better than braid, but braid will also stretch just a little. Upon the snap, the line should snap back toward the snag. While snapping, the left hand continues to hold the line, but the result should be a loose line, not the banjo pick. - Continue holding the line with the left hand and again grab with the left hand and repeat, unless the snag is off. -Repeat as necessary. -If the above fails, move the boat around to the other side of the snag (where the jig was moving from). - Repeat above procedure. I have found that most rock snags come off using this procedure. Use caution with braid, as it can give a very nasty finger cut. If all else fails, grab the wooden dowel I just told you to keep in your boat and wrap the line around it, not over wrapping to prevent the line cutting into itself, and pull until the line either breaks or the snag comes free. Resharpen the unsnagged hook. Try it, you'll like it. Bill Krejca"
