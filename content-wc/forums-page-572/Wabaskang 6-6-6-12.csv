That holds true once again this year as it seemed like the week flew by, even with somewhat crappy weather. The water temps were relatively cool ranging from 50 degrees in the morning to 53 by the late afternoon. I thought this would spell doom to any hopes of catching big northerns on jerkbaits and crankbaits, but luckily I was surprised at the aggressiveness of these fish this week. We landed 5 over 40"" with a pair above 43"". The key was very slowly retreiving the bait with many slow pauses and also slow trolling below 2 mph. There are very few weeds with the cool water temps and high water, so any area that had even the slightest weed growth starting to come up was the ticket. Areas on your graph that looked like shag carpet were areas we found our big fish. The large clumps and even strands of cabbage aren't anywhere to be found as of yet. Walleyes were caught quite easily, and everywhere throughout the lake system. Many boats were fishing west of gawley's bay, along the opening of the big lake, close to the reservation, ruby bay, and keynote. It didn't matter where, the walleyes seemed to cooperate. The best catches were on small jig/minnow combos and slip bobbers fished still with a minnow. One group of guys just pounded them with this little used approach. When the fish are still a little lethargic the slip bobber keeps it right in front of them. Finally, the bass where just starting to get going by the middle of the week. The males are starting to show up near the bedding areas with females also lingering out in 5 to 8 feet water close by. We had a 19 and several 18's over the last few days on everything from topwater, to spinnerbaits, to tubes. They were truly a blast to catch and release! Well, after 5 straight nights of fish frys my body needs a break and its back to work for a few weeks and then back up north for another good week (hopefully). It was tough to leave wabaskang camp after this trip especially the way the bite is starting to set up. My buddy just called earlier and wondered if we were drinking wild turkey tonight back home like the last 7 up north! I told him it doesn't get any better than last week!"
