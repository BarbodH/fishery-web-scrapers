Theres an area to the north where you can access the second part of the lake theres running water there, fish that we back trolled use walley spinners with a yum craw dad night crawlers minnows leaches, gulp night crawlers. if you bring a portable graph you notice theres a drop off there we fished the middle like 10 to 12 fow. otherwise fish the bays the same way and you'll catch plenty of fish and the best one are 14 to 16 inches when you pan fry then they taste like candy. Those guys at northern are awesome to good group of people to do a trip through"
