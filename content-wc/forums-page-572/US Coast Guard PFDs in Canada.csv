My life jackets are approved by the US Coast Guard. Are they able to be used on a trip to Quebec? I have used them in Canada before but have never been checked. Thanks, Chris"

1113423,Seanik,2009-06-14 08:32:00,218,"Hi Chris, Good post, I bought and use a stearns automatic inflatable pfd(USCG approved), wears like a large pair of suspenders and comfortable all day. It should be a legal pfd in Canada. There isn't a lot of us that post on this board and fish in Quebec, it seems that Western Ontario gets most of the action and justifiably so. Great fishing, tremendous lakes and friendly people make this area a strong attraction. These old bones can't take the long ride anymore so Quebec with it's shorter travel time is where it's at for me the last few years. Where in Quebec will you be this trip? I will be at a lake 65 miles Norteast of Senneterre the 2nd wk of Aug. (Lac Athapabanca). It would be nice if more who fish Eastern Canada let us know about their adventures. Sorry, I didn't mean to hijack your thread but this old geezer still gets excited about the yearly trip. Seanik (Jerry)"
1113485,slug72,2009-06-14 14:18:00,34,"Thanks for the reply guys. Seanik, I am going to the Gouin Reservoir. We'll be staying at Nemio Outfitters. Your past posts helped me narrow down my choice between Walleye Pointe and Nemio. McQ will be at Nemio the week that I am there. So having someone in camp with that much knowledge was what persauded me to go with Nemio. I would love to get out to the parts of Ontario that most of these folks fish but coming from near Hershey, PA makes those destinations 24 hours + for me. Since I am taking my two boys 12 and 14 with me, that's pushing it for travel time. So, Gouin seemed liked a decent choice to get them into catching walleye. Chris"
1113503,Seanik,2009-06-14 15:56:00,218,"Chris, The Gouin Reservior is a great choice, you and the boys should catch a lot of Walleyes. We usually found them late July & early Aug. in 20-25' near points or rock faces. A leech on a #2 red tru-urn hook weighted with a 1/2 once slip sinker was all we needed to catch them untill our arms got tired. On the way to the Gouin, we usually spend Friday night in Mt. Laurier, decent resturants and reasonable motels are available. It's then about a 4 hour drive to the reservoir. We wanted a change of scenery this year but definitely will go back to the Gouin.
