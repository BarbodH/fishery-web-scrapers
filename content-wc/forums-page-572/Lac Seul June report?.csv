1113854,LoDo,2009-06-15 19:35:00,721,"Couldnt agree more Jigger and Wally. We typically fish for walleye's 75% of the time and cast for northern the other 25%. Several of the reports are coming from Ear Falls area of the lake. I dont think we'll make it up there as we tend to fish Ghost Narrows, Big Island, Manitoba Pt areas. I know we are going to get into the South Inlet this trip too.I'd like to see the waterfall to the far south of the South Inlet. I was told about an unamed lake on the way to the waterfall I'd like to check out too.LoDo"
1113899,Steve of Madison,2009-06-15 21:51:00,230,I was advised to amend my recommendations about South.....after June 1 it's a Dead Sea!There...is that better Nate?
1113971,Mike Kansas,2009-06-16 08:08:00,1463,"Water level was normal to a little high. I can only judge that by the dock position and the depth at some saddles between islands we fish. With the water warming up like it should be I'm looking forward to going back the 26th. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1114214,JT Rod Bender,2009-06-16 20:26:00,18,"Were heading up the first week of July - this will be our eighth year in a row this time of the year. In the past seven years we have seen what I view as major changes in fish patterns due to water levels, weed growth, etc... Honey holes good one year don't hold a fish the next. One thing we have learned at least for this time of year is if you want to consistently catch mama, fish them deep 20-30' and slow, plus use larger bait. Find a shallow shelf near buy and your set. If you want to catch numbers, 75-100 fish a day, 15-20 inchers, find shoreline structure pockets. We have found it amazing that a out crop of reeds or rocks can hold lots of fish and they will be there all week. We like to mix the two make a great day and week of fishing. Ever year we catch our 28-29"",s and see plenty of action. Just got to find that 30"". This may be the year. LAC is truely a great fishery!"

1113527,gfsf12715,2009-06-14 19:05:00,4,"Just got back from the Ear Falls side Saturday evening. The fishing was outstanding! We caught more fish then any other year. Mostly on jigs and minnows. Did not seem to matter what color. Saw Mill Bay was on fire and we burned them up in there. We took a trip to Mckenzie Bay on Thursday and Friday. It was pretty much fishing for dummies. Put and jig down and you had a walleye. Caught all sizes from 7"" to 27"" with many slot fish the norm. Just an estimate but our group of 8 guys probably came close to a thousand walleye caught for the week! Several 23"" and 24"", 3 at 25"", one 26"" and 2 at 27"". Water depth was different each day it seemed like. One day it was 6' to 9', the next was 12' to 14'. Just needed to find the right depth and they were there. I did hear of several big fish being caught on Friday between Lunker Point and Saw Mill in a bay somewhere. They were picthing jigs up to shore. Resort owner said they caught large fish and one at 28.5"" -- fish must be up looking for warmer water while feeding. Water temps were cold (50-55) while we where there, but had rain and cold temps for most of the week. Mckenzie Bay hit 60 on Thursday but back down to 57 on Friday all day. The fish were still up in the spawning areas but just starting to move I think. This week should be excellent with the warmer temps up there. This was a trip to remember for our group. JR"
1113698,LoDo,2009-06-15 10:49:00,721,"WOW!! I'm loving the June Report from gfsf. Thanks! I'll be fishing McKenzie Bay, Manitoba Pt and South Bay all next week. Leaving June 19th. I'm in the office right now and totally checked out.Keep the reports coming.....Thanks,LoDoDenver, CO"
1113739,stumcfar,2009-06-15 13:06:00,451,"It is funny how people see things differently. We fished Wed.-Fri. of last week in the Ear Falls area. Fished all the same spots that the fellow above mentioned, with the exception of Mackenzie Bay. This was our poorest year in the 9 we have been fishing Lac Seul. Our group of 6 guys boated just under 450 walleyes for the 3 days. When I do the math, that is probably more fish than the group above, per person. I guess we must be spoiled. We fished jigs and jigs under slip bobbers. We caught alot of fish in the mouth of the sanctuary also. Even though fishing was slower than in other years, it was still very good. We did not find the size though. A number of fish 22""-25"", but nothing over that. The one difference this year was the number of 2 to 3 pound northerns. We boated around 100 for the 3 days. Some may like that, I found it to be a stinky nuisance. All in all, a great 3 days and it should only get better."
1113746,walleyeduran,2009-06-15 13:21:00,286,After years of checking this site out you start to realize that one person's incrediable fishing trip is defined differently than anothers. A good week on Lac Suel should be around 450-650 eyes per person. Duran
1113769,LoDo,2009-06-15 14:57:00,721,"You also have to figure in how many hours per day someone fishes. If you'll are catching 100 fish per day and fishing for 12 hours then I think you are having an avg year, however if fishing 8hrs and catching 100 per day you are having a solid trip.My opinion."
1113774,Mike Kansas,2009-06-15 15:13:00,1463,"Just got back from central part of lac Seul. Water temps were 44/46 range and fish were still spread out pretty good. Did find some 51/53 temp water and had better luck but no big schools. Jig Minnow was best and usally is. BB with crawlers was fair but with fish being a little lathargic that is to be expected. Biggest Eye was 28"", lots of slot fish Did catch a lot of Smallies with biggest being 21"". Rate fishing at a 4 on a scale of 10...based on 22 years in the same area at the same time. Mike Kansas"
1113783,Hump,2009-06-15 15:43:00,578,What were the water levels.
1113815,Jigger1,2009-06-15 17:39:00,234,"I know this is getting off topic but it also depends if you're out to get your rod bent or trophy hunting on Lac Seul. I've been in spots where you can litterally catch walleyes 16 - 19"" one after another which is a blast, but the likihood of a trophy in that same spot is less than remote. On the other hand while trophy hunting your overall production goes way down and you're left with catching the occasional small or medium walleye while hunting for mama. Personally I'm going to keep hunting for mama!"
1113831,WalleyeWally28,2009-06-15 18:19:00,298,"Good point Jigger. After 12 years of fishing LS my wife and I literally have dozens of ""honey holes"" from Ear Falls down into the main lake basin. We usually can catch fish in any wind and weather conditions, but we like to explore. We'll leave a spot that's producing and move on to see new scenery, look for wildlife and, of course, look for that hole that the big ones are laying in."
