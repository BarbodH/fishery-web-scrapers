We will be fishing out of Lac Seul Adventures in the Vaughan Lake Area, and i am looking for some fishing imput. I am used to trolling lindys with crawlers in 20+ feet of water and hammering fish, but am thinking that may need to change. Will I only be jig fishing or should I be thinking about spinner rigs and rapalas? What about Bait? I was thinking about only bringing minnows or should i have crawlers and leaches available? Thanks for your imput.JIM"
1105887,SSH,2009-05-18 10:36:00,526,"You cannot transport live minnows or leeches into Canada. Crawlers must be in commercial bedding not dirt. There are places to purchase leeches in bulk in Ontario and most resorsts can supply you with minnows at a premium price. I bring salted minnows if jig/twisters/gulp doesn't produce. Most years, never touch the salted minnows, but have fellow fisherman that don't have confidence without some meat on the jig. We have purchase bulk leeches and they produce well, also."
1105901,CH47,2009-05-18 11:48:00,29,"Jim, Stating the obvious I know, but make sure to check the regs. Vaughan is not open for fishing until the 15th of June and you can't target muskies until the third Saturday in June. Here's a link to the Ontario MNR regs for Zone 4 (Lac Seul) http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR_E001324.pdf As for tactics we've used both jigs & minnows and Lindy's & worms with equal success. Jigs usually allow for more time in the water but both catch fish. We tried salted minnows for the first time last year and really didn't notice any difference between live. We've never used the Gulp Alive! up there so can't offer an opinion on those. You'll probably want to start a bit shallower than 20' however. We generally stay between 16' - 8' for the walleyes. Good Luck, CH47"
1105908,JimSticks,2009-05-18 12:09:00,11,"Thank you alot for all the input, can I get everyone to be a bit more specific?I am aware of the regs, and we typically bring crawlers in the newspaper bedding and buy minnows in Dryden on the way in.I am more intrested in the fishing techniques, (rapalas vs jigging vs lindys) bait (minnows vs crawlers vs leaches) depths, trolling speeds, and maybe even a couple of spots to start. thanks,JIM"
1105929,Guest,2009-05-18 12:58:00,0,"Jim, try slow death hooks with half a crawler, on a 4 foot lead, off a bottom bouncer. Red seems to work the best. That time of year, look for sand banks on shore, means you're usaually fishing flats. Try and find cabbage weeds, 5-8 FOW. Windigo point is such a place, a little far for you but worth the trip. Fished there last year, did really well. Alot of 23-25 walleyes and a few northerns to boot. We used lindys with leeches, red # 4-6 hooks on a four foot florocarbon leader. Water temps were in the low 60s. The west side and the south side are where you want to start out. If you need more info, holler."
1106989,Guest,2009-05-21 18:06:00,0,"Jim. I have been staying around the corner from where you will be staying. I would be interested to find out how you like your stay. I inquired a few years ago but decided to stay at Mahkwa where we have been for years. Put a posting after you get back please and tell us how you liked it there. Anyway, like I said, we have stayed in the vaugn lake area for many years. I think our bait of choice is 3/8 oz jig head with either crawlers, twister tail or gulp. We usually fish the bigger water and refrain from vaugn as we have seen better quality in the big water. Some in our party use bottom bouncers and do quite well with that also, it just depends how you like to fish. If the water is still cool, you will do best in vaugn otherwise hit the big water and fish somewhat shallow- 6 to 14 feet."
1107202,JimSticks,2009-05-22 10:34:00,11,Thanks for all the feedback so far...keep it comming.I have stayed at Lac Seul Adventures in the past and it is nothing to write home about but the price is right. All we require is a big table to play cards and a bed to lay our heads. They offer that and then some. The owners are horrible at returning calls but they treat your nice one you arrive.
1113238,al goben,2009-06-12 19:44:00,6,Just a note - last year we were at Lac Seul Advenures and liked it very much. We caught a LOT of walleyes right off the dock and some really nice ones too. It was a blast.Good luck.
1113504,al goben,2009-06-14 16:23:00,6,i was on my way but fried a berring in cloquet i have stayed at brians and was pleased with everything but it is hard to get 6 people to go so i will be staying at ricks place we have fished vaughn in the past and have done real well with 1/4 oz jigs any live bait will work fish the sand pts start shalwow you may want to try spinners with bullet sinkers like they say find em with a rig catch with a jig good luck throw a few back we are going on the 26th let me know how you did
