I haven't been up north since 2007, so I am really excited to get back up there! Probably going to concentrate on walleye and northern. This will be the fourth time I have been up there all at Rocky Shore. Every time the weather has been different but the fishing has always been very good! Anyone else on here stay at Rocky Shore??"
1107090,Kevin R,2009-05-22 05:53:00,305,"I have been fishing Perrault & other area lakes for about 40 years, But never before the 4th of July. Last year we arrived with the Mayfly hatch never seen anything like it before. The fishing was as good as I have ever seen. I understand it was a late hatch seemed to turn the fish on Bass, Pike & Walleye were large & very easy to catch. Thought about going up in June this year for the first time but looks like it will be a cool June again & my plans have changed."
1107749,team walleye,2009-05-24 19:58:00,336,What kind of weather are you wanting? I usually go up the second or third week of June and the weather is usually very nice.
1108460,team walleye,2009-05-27 10:15:00,336,Any reports from this area yet?
1108627,Kevin R,2009-05-27 20:26:00,305,Low 50 at night 80 daytime. Have seen light snow a couple times 1970's in August. 2007 was hot July & August.
1113061,mpschweiger,2009-06-11 21:10:00,3,"We fished Perrault Lake from 29 May thru the following Friday first week in June. There were still a lot of eyes in the Ord River. We had decent luck each day. Weather was pretty brutal. Coldest I've experienced. We had our limit in three days. The issue was (not that it's bad) was we kept catching 20 plus inchers. My brother in law caught a really nice 28"" near Cedar Lake by the burned out bridge. My brother couldn't seem to catch anything small enough to keep. My group never keeps anything considered trophy size. We also caught a bunch of 12 to 14 inchers. The lake even when we left was still 49 degrees. We also had some really nice eyes on the main lake, and east bay. Buddy caught a 22 incher while bobber fishing for northern in East bay by Spadina. We caught more small mouths last week than the other 4 years combined. Some real toads. All while fishing for eyes. I'm sure there all out of the rivers now and in the main lake on their normal post spawn places. Good luck we had a great time. Mike and Chris at Rocky Shore Lodge are great, and I couldn't recommend them any higher. Northern bite was great as usual also. Biggest ones caught right off the dock at the lodge. Hope this helps. I hear some locals call Perrault the dead sea I hope they don't realize their wrong. This place is getting better and better every year. Let's hope Global warming continues (hahahaha)!!!"

1113311,nitroman,2009-06-13 12:10:00,368,"just got back last night we stay on cedar lake but we did venture up to the Ord river on Wednesday morning. 6 boats in the mouth of the river 2 on the outside by the weedbeds 4 on the first bend pitching to the weeds and we had a rocky shore boat pass us going into the mouth like we were on the way to steal their spot. We turned to leave again and there was 7 boats headed in! Wow!!! We enjoyed some great walleye fishing elswhere. Most fish averaged 17""-20"" with alot of 15's here and there. MNR was checking all the camps on thursday on Cedar lake. West wind blowing into to weedy bays pulling cranks or jigging with 1/8th oz. in the narrows was our best bet. Good luck and leave some for us next year.."
