1091775,theeyeshaveit,2009-03-28 05:07:00,15,I'm hearing they are up for sale. Could have alot to do with it
1092364,oleJoe,2009-03-30 11:40:00,114,Fr my understanding they are being sold accordding to the gentleman that I talked to last year. He said he and his son were buying Bill's fly in camps. I do know that artic watershed outfitters bought 2 of his lakes being Kaydon and Hebron. Kaydon he has had maybe 3 or 4 yrs and just bought Hebron last yr. Will be fishing Kaydon this yr for the 2nd time. His 09 prices are on his web site at AWONAKINA.COM

Alwasy somehting not working at their outposts, fridge, boats leaking broken down cabins, filthy matresses no ice hots, stoe not working..just a bloody discusting dump..don;t kjnow how they stay in business...discusting.."
