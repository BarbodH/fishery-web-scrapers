1113346,Moondog,2009-06-13 18:20:00,362,"Fact: We have been stopped on Gull Rock and inspected 3 times in 9 months (twice in the last 4 weeks) by the OPP. VERY professional and looking for alcohol and life jackets. Yesterday we asked these gentlemen what they would do if they stopped someone taking A BEER or BEERS to shore lunch. ""That individual would be walking a fine line. If they had one beer in their cooler? maybe. If they had a six pack they would get fined."" I asked what they would do if they found empties in the boat but no open containers and they said ""again a fine line."" They pulled up 100 yds from us before proceeding and watched us for a number of minutes presumably to see if we were drinking or stashing stuff. BTW......tossing the cans in the lake so you don't get caught really sucks and the officers can smell it on your breath and they do get up close and personal. They can haul you in and get a blood alcohol with little or no reason. And (can you believe it?) we were also stopped by Warden Don Maw, MNR, 2 days ago (I am getting good at finding our licenses etc) and he was interested in fish, fish in the boat (inspected both live wells and cooler), fish at camp, did we intend to take fish home, how long were we in Canada for, where we were staying......was not unpleasant but certainly not friendly. So......if you think this is a joke... the joke may well be on you and wreck what you have looked forward to for a year......a week of heaven$$$$$$ We are American Citizens with our registration clearly marked on our boat. This is meant as a first hand story and FYI only. Have a safe and fine-less trip!!!"
1113354,tackleman,2009-06-13 19:30:00,444,"I suppose you know by now that canadians are supposed to have a recreational boaters card and the american visitors are supposed to be instructed by the lodge owner on proper boat handling and safety. I asked an opp officer who was responsible for enforcing these laws and they told me that both the mnr and opp were responsible. 'they also told me that if checked for the safety equipment required by the canadian laws weren't in the boat the fines could be severe. for instance $200 ticket for no whistle. no copy of your boat ownership (that almost no one carrries since they are paper and will be destroyed if wet) carries a $500 ticket price.'so yes, they can sometimes overdo it but just because you have american registration on your boat doesn't mean you don't need to follow the laws of the canadian waters you are boating on.I also believe they are equal opportunity enforcers. they stop both US and Canadian boaters."
1113375,Moondog,2009-06-13 21:03:00,362,"Completely agree with everything you say. Yes, we were briefed by our resort owner. Yes, we carry all the law requires............ Have we seen some ugly stuff? Sure. Just trying to save some people, that believe that nothing like this is going to happen to them, some grief. Maybe they need the grief. And yes..........they seem to be indiscriminate of Canadians VS Americans. Did not want any one to think that we were Canadians pointing fingers and this was a hoax."
1113377,Moondog,2009-06-13 21:06:00,362,OH and NO.....we didn't think they were over doing it... Heck we thanked them for taking such good care of this lake so that our grandchildren can enjoy it as much as we do.

1113476,AllenW,2009-06-14 13:19:00,11482,"I find that hard to believe, that alone would make me find somewhere else to go....btw I have run into maw about three times, each time we were not violating any laws and were treated like felons out to rape, plillage and plunder.If you have worse ones up there, its a crying shame.All the other officers we've run into over the last 30 years have been very professional.Al...who likes to be proven guilty before being hung."
1113494,Jimmy Jig,2009-06-14 15:17:00,1905,I think in the past 7 or 8 years I have meet every CO that has worked out of Sioux Lookout and I have yet to meet one I didn't like.....
