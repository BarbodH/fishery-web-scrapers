1113396,Kino,2009-06-14 00:38:00,101,Was wondering if anyone on here has fished lake diefenbaker (sask. river) ??? I make an annual trip there for freelance waterfowl hunting and have ALWAYS thought it would be awesome to fish!
1113915,Chris K,2009-06-15 23:52:00,278,"Deifenbaker is awesome for walleye, and it doesn't get a lot of pressure for it's size. Every year walleye up to 13 pounds are caught. I fish two tournaments on the lake, one in late May and the other in the middle of July. In May we fish out of Elbow and head to either Coteau Bay or the Qu'Apelle dam and fish two coulees that are on the west side of the lake. THe fish are usually shallower and lots of fish from 8 to 12 pounds are cought in the tournament. In July we fish out of Sask Landing and can run about 22 miles to the east, and fishing can be really good if there is little runoff from the mountains. Fishing is good at Swift Current Creek, Bearspaw, Beaver Flats, and even the Sask Landing bridge. Lots of big walleyes are in there and it's definately worth taking an extra day or two to fish for some walleye. Chris K"

I know you can't hunt within 500 metes of the water but are you still allowed to get on it during the season?? Not sure if or what is considered ""refuge area""??? I know the river from the top side very well from beaver flat to north of cabri."
1114345,Backwater Eddy,2009-06-17 09:17:00,3871,Fall walleye is very good there. I would try to hook up with a local guide and get after some fall river walleyes.Generally mid day and afternoons are good walleye bites on rivers in the fall so morning hunts and a late afternoon/evening fishing combo is very doable.
