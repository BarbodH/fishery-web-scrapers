1114332,tiz,2009-06-17 08:52:00,18,I am putting together a trip for next summer and I value the opinions of those on this board. I will be heading up north next summer with my 11 year son for a week of bonding time. I made a trip a few years ago to Lac Seul for a hard week of fishing that I believe may be to much for him. Would you suggest a large lake such as Wabingoon with several species to pursue or a smaller lake or river system. I like the idea of Wabingoon being close to Dryden for the times he wishes to be away from the water. Any suggestions or ideas will be greatly appreciated.
1114356,IowaDave,2009-06-17 09:56:00,69,"To me, it depends on how much he likes to fish, how many fish you'd like to catch & what you want to do when you're not fishing.I've never been to Lac Seul, but here are my thoughts on the subject just for what it's worth......I've made 3 trips to Wabigoon (just got back from my 3rd trip Saturday) and the fishing has varied from terrible to above average. When I read about the posts from Lac Seul, I froth at the mouth and am trying to get a group together so that I can end the Wabigoon annual trip & go to LS. Of course, the reason for this is that (from what I gather from the messages about the lake), you can catch a tremendous amount of fish with some real trophies on LS. Since you've been there, you know the lake a little bit & I'm sure have some honey holes marked. Basically, I just think you'd have better fishing on LS. When I was 11, when I went fishing I wanted to catch fish, and lots of them....not sit in a boat looking at a depth finder & chasing fish all day. Unless you know of or find some really hot spots on Wabigoon, chances are he may become bored fast (heck, I even got bored at times last week). If you choose to go to LS, there's nothing saying you'd have to get up at dawn & fish until dark. You could go to where they're biting, fish until he tired of it & go in. But then comes the 'what do we do now'. Having never been there, I have no idea what there is to do, but if he enjoys hiking or things of that sort, I would think there would be enough to do to keep him interested (maybe not though). If he wants to go to town & mess around, that may be an issue. If you DO end up going to Wabigoon, I would highly recommend getting one of the big detailed maps that are available (you can get them in dryden or they sell them on the net. I have the website at home if you're interested). We've had one for a couple years and they're worth their weight in gold. They have a lot of the rocks marked, which is a huge bonus. If I were you, I would have the map in hand and ask the camp owner to go over it with you to show you some of the rocks that are out there that aren't on the map (there are a few and they're NASTY). The guys I've been going with have been going there for nearly 20 years & they're still very cautious about the rocks. There are a lot of them that are just a foot or 2 under the water and they can be 100 yards from shore and some are even in the middle of the lake, some are marked with bouys, some aren't. They spook the crap out of me and I'm very glad that someone with a lot of experience is behind the wheel of the boat. One plus of Wabigoon is that there are a lot of other lakes attached to wabigoon that you can go & explore and we've had some really good luck on them. They're also nice to go to if the wind is blowing because Wabigoon can get pretty rough when it blows, but you can always find a nice calm spot in those other lakes (Butler, West Butler, Olsen, Larson & Paulsen). If you choose to go there, I would try & talk to some locals or somehow get some info on where they're biting & what on. I posted for some info on here before I went, and I don't think anyone that posts here fishes there, so don't expect much help as far as that goes. This year we did stumble onto a kid that works at the bait shop in Dryden, next to the 7-11 on the main drag. His dad owns the bait shop & this kid was a wealth of info. He was more than willing to tell us where & what to try. He was only about 17, but he's very polite & knows his stuff. He said he also guides there and that would be worth looking into if you get there & it's tough IMO. There's my $.02....for whatever it's worth. Let me know if I can get you any more info on Wabigoon....I'll do my best."
1114366,Larry Mac,2009-06-17 10:38:00,530,"Hi Tiz, I have been taking my boys along with other father, sons and daughters for many years to Ghost River Lodges Sioux Lookout Ontario. They are wonderful people and offer reduced rates and plans for families.We are going there in August of 2009. The camp and environment provides the full experience. This is boat and portage in camp. They Have access to 15 lakes and the only camp on these lakes. Wildlife is outstanding i.e. Moose, Eagles, Beaver, Ect. The lakes are mostly Walleye and Northern and they will mark maps and give tips if requested. This is a river system with tea colored water so fishing is good all season long. It is truly an adventure and we always catch fish. My youngest is 13 years old and has been up north (9) times. He has been to this camp (7) times and tries to Drive the boat from the front. He knows too many spots. lol We have fished there the months of May, June, July and August. Catch fish all months, of course have to adjust to the time of year. My son(s) have experienced many 100+ fish per day per boat. They also can catch fish right off the dock. Below is the website link and have a great time wherever you go up north with your son. You are building memories of a lifetime. Have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Macwww.ghostriverlodges.com"
1114367,Golden Eagle,2009-06-17 10:38:00,2642,May 23-30 we spent a week on a fly in lake and had a 10 year old & a 21 year old along. They both started joining us when they were 8 years old and haven't missed a year since. They did fine every year. Don't underestimate an 11 year old. They fish long and hard. They camped out at Chukuni River Campground the night of May 22 in Red Lake during a cold rain. There was no whining.
1114379,Guest,2009-06-17 11:07:00,0,"I don't think the size of the lake really matters but maybe things to do in the area if he gets bored. My dad started taking my brother and I to Canada for two weeks at a time when I was 7 and that was when we just picked an island and camped there the whole time. Those were the best times I can remember, and I really could have cared less how big or where the lake was."
1114387,cast_and_blast,2009-06-17 11:29:00,1098,"Size of the water probably doesn't matter as much as being flexible and prepared. I have 3 boys (11, 9 and 2) so I'm speaking from experience here. 1. Make sure the boat is prepped. Snacks, drinks for the time on the water. If you'll be fishing through inclement weather make sure he has good rain gear (as good as yours). Other diversions like books and or handheld video games are up to you, but sometimes the kids just need to take a break even if the fish are biting. Also, make sure he is using good fishing equipment and get him involved in learning about the elctronics and how to drive the boat - both main motor and trolling motor. 2. Make sure you are mentally ready. You're going to need to take a break from fishing - period. This might mean going swimming, tubing, boat rides, chasing frogs in a pond with a net, going to ""town"" for lunch and/or ice cream, playing a game in the cabin, roasting hotdogs over a campfire, etc. If you go with the idea that it's all-fishing all-the-time and it turns out not to be you'll be disappointed and it will show. 3. Catch fish. He probably doesn't care if it is a northern, walleye or perch. Most kids are not to hip on the idea of sitting in the boat and jigging with no results for hours. Gotta be flexible. 4. Get him involved a little with the planning. This could include packing for the trip, planning the route, researching the area on the internet, getting fishing reports, learning to read a lake map and picking spots to fish, meal planning, etc. Some 11 year olds like this and will take to it, others are so-so. Give him some responsibiility though - get him invested in the trip. 5. Plan some fun things you know he'll like and keep them as a surprise. Could be as simple as S'mores over the campfire, maybe a new Lego set to build in the cabin, going to the local town for pizza, etc. 6. He's a kid and want to have fun. Have fun with him. 11 year old humor is, well, pretty basic. A burping contest in the boat can make for great hilarity (especially in their eyes). Ask me how I know... Good luck! Scott"
