1111317,TJP,2009-06-05 19:35:00,6,Looking for suggestions on musky lures and colors for Wabigoon Lake. will be fishing in eraly July. Are the Walleyes safe to eat or should they be avoided due to the mercury content/
1113518,Guest,2009-06-14 17:46:00,0,"Lure choice on the ""Goon"" is blacks and reds with maybe the odd plastic trailers...Weagles, Suicks and bucktails all work fine. The ""Goon"" is known for being a shallow bite so therefore bucktails work great ! The Walleyes are fine to eat. The ""Goon"" is upstream of the dam and therefore the fish are excellent to eat ! Down stream of the dam had issues many years ago because of the effluent from the mill. Enjoy the ""Goon"", it's a great lake with many options ! Take care, Rob ""Great White North Guiding"" [email protected]"
