1113355,BenBeattie,2009-06-13 19:32:00,232,Water is average for this time of year. Fishing in the Lost Lake area has been good lately. Sandbars are hitting well in 6-12 feet. Most fish are still traveling along mainland shorelines as they transition between spawning areas and their summer haunts in the main lake basins.
