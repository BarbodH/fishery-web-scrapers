The kit, which I did purchase a few years ago, does not have everything to make me legal in my home state/country or Canada...Minnesota requirements for my size boat (18 ft) requires a number of items including a throwable floating rescue device and a fire extinguisher, items not included in the kit."
1112675,v-bay gord,2009-06-10 15:21:00,3168,"Teddi.....according to your post a $10 kit will NOT make them legal because a majority of the PFD's used by US residents are US Coast Guard Approved.......NOT Canadian Coast Guard Approved. If you are going to interpret the regulations incorrectly in the first place then go whole hog on it. Numerous meetings that I have attended have had the OPP present explaining the boating safety requirements........each time it was explicitly explained that the regulations that apply in the home state of a nonresident using his/her own boat will apply here. There is no talk about having them meet the requirements as you list (even though most are similar with some exceptions or additions). I suggest you talk to someone in the marine enforcement section of the OPP in Dryden or Red Lake......or wherever is closest to you. I disagree that it is ""up to who ever stops you""."

After watching some episodes of: ""Survivorman"" & ""Man vs Wild"", last winter, I decided to assemble a small kit to keep on board my boat during our visits to LOTW. Its seems so easy to hit rocks there & become disabled/stranded miles, perhaps a dozen miles, from your camp. What would you need if your outboard or hull is broken miles from others and you are forced to bivouac overnite without any camping supplies? You're stranded on some little pine island in the middle of LOTW. Even though you may have contacted outside help, if its after dark, you may be waiting until tomorrow for a rescue. I made a kit, a little bigger than a shoebox, with: 4 foil survival blankets, 50ft of 1/4 inch rope, serrated folding knife that can cut branches for fire, orange distress flag, magnesium fire-starter, butane lighter, flares. Any suggestions for other items to add ? We already have a first-aid kit, so this one is for bivouacing/rescue supplies while on a large, semi-wilderness lake."

1113275,Bigfishhunter,2009-06-13 07:45:00,803,"Snaggletooth, why not add a couple of those chemical hand/foot warmers. Then I would also throw in some power bars or granola bars or something to take the edge off. Although there might be snacks in the boat already?! My safety kit includes a decent but cheap compass, lighter, knife, small amount of tinder, in a sealed bag (birch bark is the best), a flashlight, rope, spare batteries for flashlight, hand warmers, flagging tape, toilet paper - 1/2 roll, pencil and paper, bandages, gum, and tea bags. All of this goes into a metal coffee can that has the lid sealed and then wrapped with some tape for two reasons, one to keep me out on a daily basis and to ensure that water does not seep into it in the even that the boat gets swamped. The reason I use a metal can instead of a waterproof box is so that I have something to boil water in!"

If you do require proof of competency (because the above doesnâ€™t apply or you want to operate a boat licensed or registered in Canada) then you may use an operator card or similar proof of competency issued by your home state or country. Either way, you must keep proof of residence on board with you at all times. Safety Equipment Requirements Foreign boats (those that are licensed or registered in a country other than Canada) need to comply with the equipment requirements of the country in which the boat is usually kept. If you are a non-resident of Canada operating a boat that is licensed or registered in Canada, the boat must meet Canadian safety equipment requirements. However, in either case, you may bring your own lifejacket to use as long as it fits and meets the requirements of your home country.

1112646,teddi,2009-06-10 13:28:00,349,i think you will find it is up to who ever stops you. not every one reads things the same way. for 10.00 you can get a boat safety kit that makes you legal [wal mart or canadian tire in canada]. why take the chance?

If you are up there fishing with your boat that is lienced in the states you only need the things that are legel in the state you are from.

1112337,teddi,2009-06-09 16:07:00,349,this post is not wrong. go to www.boatingsafety.gc.ca and you can find the info on what is required. it pertains to all boats operating in canada.
1112340,v-bay gord,2009-06-09 16:12:00,3168,Jimmy Jig is correct........a U.S. registered boat is required to have the safety equipment needed for the State of origin. If you are a Canadian registered boat then you require the list that Teddi posted. Obviously there is a universal requirement for life jackets and other items that will be similar. Same goes with the boater safety card.....you don't need a Canadian boater safety card if you are bringing up your boat from the U.S. (unless you are spending the whole summer).
1112343,v-bay gord,2009-06-09 16:19:00,3168,teddi....I'm not going to search through the link to prove you wrong. Suffice to say you are wrong. Should you feel the need for confirmation I suggest you contact the local O.P.P. office and ask for their marine enforcement people. They will set you straight on the regulations and how they will be enforcing them.
1112350,teddi,2009-06-09 16:39:00,349,i guess it is how you read the regulations. if it is me i will write tickets for infractions and i would let the courts decide.

Do a search for a post on the General board called ""What's in Your Boat"". It started 4/7/09 and you'll find the link that clarifies the regs.Bottom line for non-Canadians, if the boat is not in Canada for more than 45 consecutive days, the Canadian requirements do not apply. I should have such a problem......"
