When I crossed the boarder coming back I asked what the rules, or wiggle room was on the passport law.They said that as long as you can show that you have registered for a passport, you more then likely will not have any problems for the immediate future.Now, who knows, maybe they will make an overnight change to that without announcement. ""remember the birth cirtificate change""But if your going up in June or early July I wouldn't think you will have much of an issue, If your going up in late July, get your passport request in now.Peace in the Middle EastSteve"
1113574,lakerlover,2009-06-14 22:36:00,7,I know that it is OK to have reels in carry on. TSA allows them to be spooled with line. Does anyone know if this is OK with the Canadian counterpart for TSA? Heading to Lakers Unlimited July 2nd. Lakerlover
1113588,rebs,2009-06-15 05:26:00,7587,"KS Thank you for the information. However isn't this part of your response a little political sounding or at best a crued attempt at humor? ""Granted I cannot speak for pseudo communist New York State"" I can assure you New York State is not any more communist than your state while you attempt to play golf, I will be on the water catching walleyes. Try it sometime it will lower your blood pressure and relieve alot of your stress and anxiety"
1112685,Ralfeee,2009-06-10 16:05:00,33,"Let's see here, it is a photo ID that is accepted anywhere in the world, or just about anyway. If you would lose your Drivers License you can get a replacement easier as you have a government issued Photo ID.If you get a job, it can be used as an ID for the I9 form used by your employer. Don't need to carry your Social Security Card with you. It is valid for 10 years.You need to be a little more open minded about what this is for. It is not just for people fishing in Canada wanting to get back into the country.Yes, it is a revenue source, but if you want to complain about revenue sources the government has, there are a few more important ones out there to choose from."
1112689,rebs,2009-06-10 16:16:00,7587,"I was simply addressing his statement about if his friends license to carry was affecting the time it is taking to get his passport, there was no attempt to change this thread into anything. I think you are assuming again. As far as the rest of my post it is accurate. get your facts straight. we are talking a license to carry concealed which means hand gun. A hand gun cannot be transported across state lines without a federal firearms license, neither can one be shipped without same license. I also have not heard anything about Canada requiring a passport as of yet and doubt they will anytime soon. The passport to return to the US started as part of homeland security to help prevent unsavory people such as terrorists etc from entering the country so easily.whats your problem ? You are spending way too much time assuming.You Sir should get your facts straight before putting forth your 2 cents which in this instance turns out to be about 1/2 cent worth.Have a great day and keep on assuming !"
1112775,joeman79,2009-06-10 22:02:00,417,I pm'ed Rebs My whole point was nothing to do with carrying a weapon. It was what I think is the reason his passport is being delayed and taking longer than normal. That's All. Everyone please remain calm.

1112870,Kruger,2009-06-11 08:45:00,259,I've lived for 50 years traveling back and forth between the U.S and Canada without having to spend $100 on a passport. The examples you gave could be a valid reason for you wanting to get one. But I asked what purpose it served forcing me to get one. Just because the government takes more of my money in other ways doesn't make this one any less annoying.
1112882,AllenW,2009-06-11 09:25:00,11482,"fwiw the wife and I both have carry permits and we got ours almost a week earlier than they said we would.I think Mohleye hit it when he said ""As far as going without a passport and taking your chances coming back, the rest of your group might not appreciate cooling their heels for however long it might take to get straightened out when they want to get home.

1112891,KS TrophyHunter,2009-06-11 10:06:00,10,"Well Rebs, my old dead daddy always told me not to get into a battle of wits with someone who was unarmed, but in this case I can't resist.From your earlier post:I believe that license (concealed carry) is only good is the state of issue as it is illegal to carry concealed weapon across state lines and Canada will not honor that license.You are one hundred per cent correct that Canada will not honor a concealed carry permit. You are 90% incorrect in your statement that it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon across state lines. Some 37 states have reciprocity agreements with their concealed carry permits, I just took the concealed carry class and this was covered extensively (Hmm, I wonder if having a passport will hold up my permit???). The internet can also be used for research and not just posting inaccurate statements, try it sometime. From your second post:A hand gun cannot be transported across state lines without a federal firearms license, neither can one be shipped without same license.COMPLETELY WRONG. I can transport a handgun (concealed) into 37 other states. Further I can transport or ship a handgun (non-concealed) pretty much everywhere in the states and a lot of other countries. Granted I cannot speak for pseudo communist New York State and am not going to spend the 30 seconds it would take to find out. From Wikipedia, A Federal Firearms License, (FFL), is a license that enables an individual or a company to engage in a business pertaining to the manufacture of firearms and ammunition or the interstate and intrastate sale of firearms. Regarding Canada requiring a passport, they currently require proof of citizenship, duh, can you guess what is coming, WHTI compliant documentation. The US passport requirement is based upon the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, as Canada is in the Western Hemisphere and a party to the WHTI, they too are changing their entry requirements. Having traveled internationally extensively (the basis for my previous assumption), I can assure you that other countries will not allow a non-resident into their country unless they are assured you can go back home, ie, If the US requires a passport to return, Canada will make sure you have one before they let you in. Visas may be next, you heard it here first!!! Kinda makes sense, doesn't it? And if any of us thinks that the passport requirement is going to keep unsavory terrorists out of the country we are delusional. In a previous post it was pointed out that for $100 you could go to the Viking Bar in International Falls and get a boat ride over to Fort Francis. OUR BORDER IS ESSENTIALLY OPEN.You guys chew on that for a while I have to go play a little golf and drink a beer or two. Another hmmm, wonder if it is illegal to drink beer in a golf cart???? OH NO, now I have started another one."
1112904,Guest,2009-06-11 10:50:00,0,"I'd like to see you try to walk 18 holes with a golf bag on one arm, single beer and cooly in one hand and a 12 pack cooler in the other..., I'll take my chances...LOL."
1112922,elmo,2009-06-11 11:54:00,43,I don't have a carry permit.. but I did stay at a Holiday Inn last night. And I will carry the golf bag and be the caddy for a beer .
1112484,rebs,2009-06-10 04:47:00,7587,license to carry concealed weapon from what state ? I believe that license is only good is the state of issue as it is illegal to carry concealed weapon across state lines and Canada will not honor that license. I believe this is true atleast in NY state where a concealed carry permit is not valid in NY City and it is not allowed to carry across state lines. A federal fire arms license is required to carry or ship across state lines.Also it was on our local news that they are not going to turn people away at the border for not having a passport right at the beginning as long as you have a drivers license and birth certificate with you. The passport is being fazed in for approzimately the first month.
1112510,Backwater Eddy,2009-06-10 06:29:00,3871,Worse case scenario ..they deport you to Quebec ..and make you learn French.
1112514,Larry Mac,2009-06-10 06:43:00,530,"Hi PMH, Rockpt is correct. My sister in law and niece just got back from a vacation in Ireland. I week before they were to leave my niece realized she had misplaced her passport. She went to Chicago (She lives in Illinois) and was able to get her passport immediately. I do not know the details but I do know the story had a happy ending. Have a great tripThank you,Larry Mac"
1112529,KS TrophyHunter,2009-06-10 07:38:00,10,"Hey Rebs,If you are going to turn this into a carry thread at least get your info right. Here in the free American states we do have reciprocity with a large number of other states. And, of course, NOT with New York or Canada. That being said, at any time I would expect Canada not to allow someone in, without proper documentation to get back out. IE, you will be required to show your passport going into Canada. I would assume they will start as soon as US starts enforcing the passport requirement."
1112542,Mohleye,2009-06-10 07:58:00,368,"I do not believe that to be correct. (That Canadian customs will not let you in without a passport) I was in Canada fishing last week. The customs agent simply asked for ID, never mentioned passports. Also, the previous post about getting a passport the same day in Chicago is right on. My daughter did this 2 years ago, that's when the passport offices were all clogged up. She had to wait in lines virtually all day, but she did get one. The big passport rush is over, so I doubt the waits would be that long now. As far as going without a pasport and taking your chances coming back, the rest of your group might not appreciate cooling their heels for however long it might take to get straightened out when they want to get home."
1112641,Dark Diz,2009-06-10 13:10:00,14,"I go across from Manitoba to the US at Sprague/Warroad and then into Ontario at Baudette/Rainy River. To be honest, it really depends on the day, and who is asking the questions. I have been asked everything from what is my specific job title, to if I had more than $10,000 cash with me (to which I replied ""I WISH!""). I have also been pretty much waved through, only asking if we were all Canadians.Most times they seem to be more concerned with what you are carrying I have found, and again, sometimes they are more thorough than at other times. It seems that the customs guys target certain areas on a given day, like last week was citrus fruits. We told them we didn't have any, except for a few apples (not a citrus fruit, he didn't ask anything further).Like I said, it really depends... sometimes it does not matter what you say, you are going to get searched... guess when your number comes up, it comes up.If you have kids though, and are not travelling with BOTH parents of the kids (this includes friends of your kids) MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A SIGNED NOTE from the absent parent(s). Lately, they have been pretty thorough in that area."
1112650,MagicMan,2009-06-10 13:51:00,15,I just received mine in the mail. It took two weeks expedited. You pay more but it is well worth it. I got both the card and the passport when you break it down each month over the next 10 years it is pretty cheap.

1112669,teddi,2009-06-10 15:17:00,349,maybe the governments of both countrys should issue passports at birth. it would save a lot of bs

She also made some comment about flying to Chicago at the last minute to get a passport of you need it. Even though it's not required to enter Canada, I wonder if Canadian customs is asking for it because they know you need it to get back into US..."

1112375,NemegosendaRiver,2009-06-09 17:31:00,66,"Trade associations and groups also have been spreading the word. Travel Montana added a link on their Web page to sites that explain border-crossing regulations and WHTI.""If you come back to the border and the agent asks for documentation and you say you only have a drivers' license, we'll do what we do now, ask where you were born and establish your citizenship,"" said Milne. ""At that point, you are admissible to the United States. We'll give you a tear sheet and ask you why you weren't compliant with the rule.""What if you've applied for a passport that hasn't arrived yet?""Let me put it this way. I'm not going to tell you you should go to Canada before it arrives,"" said Milne. ""But if when you come back we can establish your ID and citizenship and you tell us your passport application is pending, that's great. You are on your way to becoming compliant, and the next time you come through, you'll have your passport. This isn't a gotcha situation.""---- My brother is in the same boat. We are not that worried about it."
1112376,WalleyeAve,2009-06-09 17:32:00,8,Yes from what I understand you just need them to get back into the States. It doesnt take that long to get them in.

That is what was reported last week!!!! Good Luck I would not take the chance myself"
1112430,GNO,2009-06-09 20:33:00,153,"You will get into Canada without a problem. You will just be delayed getting back into the US. Be sure to bring your drivers license and birth certificate. They will probably have you go inside and verify that you are US citizen. They will not make you stay in Canada until you have a passport. There are also not any monetary penalities for not having it yet. Go on your trip and bring as much id as possible, I am sure you will be fine."
