We will be fishing June 21-24, so as I understand the lake trout may be a bit deep 40 to 100 feet. I bought a few dipsy divers and think I understand the general idea, but wanted to ask if there were any tips or tricks?Thanks"
1113206,BenBeattie,2009-06-12 16:48:00,232,"Funny you should ask... I'm in the middle of writing an article about Dipsey Diver Lake Trout for a major Canadian magazine, however it won't be released until after your trip. I will get back to you with some tips when I have some time to sit down and write them out."
1113207,pegasis0066,2009-06-12 16:51:00,64,Thanks - looking forward to it.
1113209,new hips,2009-06-12 17:09:00,498,"I have used on the Great Lakes, for salmon. Usually 3, you can swivel the weight left or right or centered. A 7-8 ft trolling rod - Penn Reels, This year I also want to try it on Lake Trout. You can use a snubber (like a shock absorber) with a small flasher also. I'm taking my line counter reel this year, or count footage with loosen drag and give it pulls about a yard at a time. In fact I'm taking J-Plugs and assorted flutter spoons. Larger spoons for larger trout, If catching smaller ones drop it a little bit lower. I take a clamp on rod holder also. There is an adjustment on the Dipsy so when a fish strikes the Dipsy straightens out and stops diving. Adjust that release to match the lure and the size fish your going after."
1113366,BenBeattie,2009-06-13 20:10:00,232,"Here's a quick list of Dipsey Diver tips for Lake Trout. Hope it helps. - Rigger rods, or similar work well. Long and relatively soft. You don't need to 'set the hook' when trolling Dipsey's.... it sets itself when the fish hits. - 14-17lb line, mono! Run a similar # fluoro leader from your mainline to the dipsey. Fluoro is more abrasian resistant when you're banging bottom with the dipsey. Believe me, banging bottom triggers hits!! - There are dive charts on-line for the different sizes of dipsey's - look em up so you know how how deep your dipsey will run with X amount of line out. - if you can, get a line counter reel. Critical for repeatability once you find fish at a certain depth. Takes the guess work out of depth control. - Run a 4-6' mono leader from the dipsey to your bait. - As new hips suggested... Jointed baits (eg, rapala J-11 and J-13) and Spoons are excellent baits to run behind dipsey's. In recent years I've been switching out all trebles for single siwash hooks. Hook-up ratio's are still high and the best part is how much easier it is on the fish to unhook. Makes a huge difference, I find. - When trolling for trout, your electronics are just as important as your boat and rod/reel combo's. Scan likely areas looking for bait, trout and structure. Note the depth and use the depth control of the Dipsey to put the bait in the strike zone. - Rod holder is a must!! Run the tip of your rod low... 4-6"" off the water is ideal. - Trigger hits by changing your speed... drop into neutral for a moment, speed up, slow down, run 'S' curves over structure. You'll be surprised how many hits come when you 'change up' your presentaion like this. If you have a GPS - note the speed where you pick up fish and establish a pattern. - Dipsey's troll relatively close behind the boat allowing tight turns. Great for targeting smaller pieces of structure, eg deep humps or underwater points more efficiently. Good luck!!! Ben"

The deepsix has a snap swivel release which you can adjust also for strikes and depth you fish its a far better system http://www.xtremesportfishing.com/al...in/deepsix.jpg"
