1113496,SimilarIsland,2009-06-14 15:19:00,121,"No, but a guy in our group lost his wallet and never had a passport and they let him by just as fast as us. All he had was a Birth Certificate."

1114100,Guest,2009-06-16 14:11:00,0,"We just crossed on May 31st with one guy who only had birth certificate. I specifically asked the border agent on the U.S. side what would happen if we had tried to cross after June 1, 2009. His reply was straightforward ""we will never deny entry to a U.S. citizen""...""however, you may be delayed""."
