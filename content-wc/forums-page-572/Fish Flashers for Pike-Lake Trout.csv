I borrowed some trolling rods/reels from my brother this morning and he also loaned me a little tackle - to include some j-plugs and a flasher. Do flashers work well for lake trout and/or pike?On another note, I have never caught a lake trout before, but assumed they would taste like a rainbow. My brother informed me they are virtually inedible unless smoked - is this true?"

Do them on the grill - wrap in foil with butter pats, sliced onion, sliced lemon, and salt and pepper. Or, put some onion slices in the bottom of a baking pan, add laker fillets, lemon, salt and pepper, and butter on the fillets. Cover and seal with foil and bake at 325-350 degrees until done. Add any particular spices you like - lemon pepper, dill, whatever. You'll have a dinner fit for a king!"
1113364,JRW7,2009-06-13 20:08:00,9,"Lake Trout on the grill can be excellent. The way I prefer it is to boil it. Bring water to a boil, add potatoes and onions, bring to a boil again, add trout, bring to a boil.......done. Add @ a cup of salt (first)to a gallon of water and season as you like."

1113410,tcasica,2009-06-14 07:18:00,14,I would have to agree that Lake Trout is probably the best fish to eat regardless of cooking method. It's probably one of the only fish we eat during our stay in Canada that we do not deep fry with batter. We've even got up early an caught small pan size Lake Trout and cooked them (minus head and guts) for breakfast.
