4751954,Eandjfish,2016-04-19 14:04:00,4,"Beer slayer, sent you a PM. The walleyed there seem to stay in 10-15 feet of water (mid July) and don't hang in the deep holes..."
4422641,beer slayer,2016-01-03 20:40:00,33,"Happy New Year to all my fellow Fisherman. To start the year right, I just booked Auger Lake for 2 full weeks in August with Mattice Lake outfitters. Having stayed with this outfitter last year at their Guerin Lake camp, we were so impressed, we just had to go back! They have a slew of nice camps, on good water. We are a fishing couple, and for the last 5 years have spent our vacation on Canadian Fly-in trips. Last years trip to Guerin was really fishing the Attwood River, as it flows in and out of the Lake. We debated long & hard about returning to Guerin, but after careful consideration decided Auger fits our bill. With that said, I am hoping someone on here has been to Auger and can give me some info on it. Any & all information, tips, and advice much appricated! Wishing you all good fishing this year! Thank You very much, Beer Slayer (Kenny)"
4448273,Bass Lake,2016-01-12 20:39:00,20,Beer- Ditto. We just booked Auger for last week in July. Pretty excited. Never been there.
4453185,beer slayer,2016-01-14 19:23:00,33,"Bass Lake - Cool man! We are going in August 5th, so we will miss you by a week. Fished last year with Mattice, outfitter is fantastic! CABINS ARE GREAT! Wishing you good luck! Sending you a PM, check it out, thanks"

We had the choice between several lakes, but chose Auger Lake because it is fairly small and probably easier to get on fish right away. Kag Lake was our second choice, but I didn't like the idea of fishing a large, clear water lake in May."
4458921,TIGHTLINER,2016-01-17 05:30:00,223,"Kag is a fantastic lake to fish in the spring. It can get hard to fish if the winds are blowing but you can. Always get back into bays or inlets. Lots of nice eyes about 5 min run from cabins on the south end. Some great pike fishing 5 min in the other direction from the cabins that were owned by corky, i believe twin lakes now owns them. I am not sure where the cabin is for mattice outfitters. In the early spring lt can be caught across from the cabins..."
4460017,adempsey,2016-01-17 10:38:00,963,"The MLO cabin is at the mouth of the Opichuan, not far from Kag lodge. We were at Kag lodge in 2014 and had non-stop high winds all day and night. Never experienced that before. They weren't so strong that we couldn't go out fishing, but they dictated where we could go comfortably. Definitely would go back."
4460113,Ogoki,2016-01-17 10:57:00,291,"We fished Auger one year in mid June . Only trip I ever ate pike in all the trips with MLO. First three days were flat slow . On check flight we got our minnows which were accidently left on the dock , while the plane was loaded . Walleye fishing got much better with live bait . I inquired with others when we returned to MLO dock and there was an overall slow down that week. If I remember correctly the large body of water to the north of camp was basically a dishpan . After much exploring , we did much better east of camp , where the lake turns south. That year was a double trip and the second week was on Ogoki Res. Caught fish like we normally did . The camp attendant there , said the previous week was a little a little slower . As far north as Auger is, the only pressure it could have would be the fly in camp with the odd canoe going thru . I feel the fishing would normally be much better than we experienced BUT I would take live minnows with me , to be safe . Awesome camp with shower , nice dock etc . Typical MLO camp."
4461817,Bass Lake,2016-01-18 03:17:00,20,Thx to those that have commented on Auger lake info... if anyone else cares to chime in we would appreciate it! Bass Lake.
4467282,Bass Lake,2016-01-19 12:43:00,20,"We have over 700 views here on this topic... any info anyone can share would be much appreciato. Not asking for GPS co-ordinates or spot on spot. Just wondering about depths, lure types/colors/baits any have used and/or any other general info on lake. Have been on phone with MNR up there. They have little to no info. Am trying to find a lake contour/depth map as well, but to date, that has been unsucessfull as well."
4468778,adempsey,2016-01-19 22:37:00,963,"There's a depth map you can download from here:http://lineonfishing.com/index.php/o...ake-depth-mapsFishing strategies will basically be the same as every other inland lake in Ontario. You're fishing the summar, so for Walleye target shoals, wind blown points, neck downs, rapids etc.. between 10 and 20+ FOW. Areas where rivers and creeks flow in are good, especially near deeper water for pike. Jigs with live bait, grubs in pink/white or paddletail minnows; trolling harnesses, slow death; drifting Lindy meat rigs all work for me for Walleye. Pike attack anything, I prefer chucking spoons (Johnson's Silver Minnow with white grub, Len Thompson, Eppinger, Williams etc..) along shorelines, cabbage, beaver dams, etc.. Not sure about the brook trout in August though. If I were targeting trophy fish I'd probably troll in deeper water that drops shallow to deep relatively quick with larger minnow type lures.Of course, I am a horrible fisherman so some corrections to my strategies may be in order Best of luck!"
