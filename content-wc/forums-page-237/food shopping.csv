They don't know I'm only using blanks.I discovered my wife in bed with another man, and I was crushed. So I said, 'Get off me, you two!'When I was a kid I used to pray every night for a new bicycle. Then I realized that the Lord doesn't work that way so I stole one and asked Him to forgive me.I'm a great lover, I'll bet."

4727994,BennieS,2016-04-11 20:54:00,108,Going to Cedar Lake this summer. Will probably skip 502 this year and go up through Nestor Falls and Sioux Narrows. Is there a Safeway along the way or another well stocked grocery somewhere where I can stop and buy our food?

4728834,LOW1,2016-04-12 07:45:00,2828,"There is a Safeway in Ft Francis, but it would be a little out of the way. There is a large grocery store in Emo on the north side of the road which would have everything you need and would be more convenient. Dalseg's is on the east side of the road in the northern portion of Nestor Falls and is not as large but will likely have everything you need plus is an LCBO outlet and would also be very convenient. There is a smaller grocery store in Sioux Narrows. The Kenora Safeway is very nice but would be out of your way unless you were going into Kenora for other reasons."
4728986,camp chef,2016-04-12 08:06:00,915,Highly recommend Dalseg's....Cheap beer well stocked store with good selection of bread and bakery. Bait store also in the same complex.
4730346,Bill Krejca,2016-04-12 13:11:00,6107,"I'll second the Emo store, just across the street from the police station. They have a huge selection, and the help is more than accommodating. Also, the bread is always fresh. Also, the beverage store is almost right next to it. Bill"

4730898,Bakefish,2016-04-12 15:09:00,1077,I just can't get past the haircuts in that town.
4731514,nitroman,2016-04-12 18:50:00,368,Yip! Best place bar none! And there is a tackle store next to it!
4731866,BennieS,2016-04-12 20:44:00,108,"You guys are great. Thanks for all of the options. I gotta' know though, what kind of haircuts are we talking about?"
