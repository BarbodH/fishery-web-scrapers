4755994,ftfarms,2016-04-20 15:19:00,444,Thanks. I'll try that.
4744610,ftfarms,2016-04-17 15:08:00,444,Does anyone know if the new store or any place else in morson sells leeches or maybe rainy river? Last year mid august the resort didn't have any we stay at.
4745194,Obabikon,2016-04-17 19:47:00,2370,"Buena Vista usually has them... but, a lot of leech availability will depend on the time of year."
4745322,Fisherman Ted,2016-04-17 20:59:00,461,Once you get into August leeches are pretty much gone.
4745394,Lotw1,2016-04-17 21:55:00,36,Gil's marina usually has them
4746826,Yamagator,2016-04-18 10:40:00,28,and is the store selling beer yet?
4747706,Obabikon,2016-04-18 14:47:00,2370,"Last I heard, the store was NOT selling beer yet, but I'll know for sure in a couple weeks."
4752042,SILVER MINNOW BAIT SHOP,2016-04-19 14:18:00,18,Where will you be crossing into canada?
4752378,Lotw1,2016-04-19 15:41:00,36,He mentioned rainy river so I'm guessing there
4753442,ftfarms,2016-04-19 23:06:00,444,That is correct. Rainy river.
4754482,Lotw1,2016-04-20 08:44:00,36,"Ftfarms,I thought I read in another post that you stay at Miles Bay Camp. If that's the case I would maybe try letting Matt know you want a half or a pound a couple weeks before you go and he might be able to have some at camp waiting for you."
