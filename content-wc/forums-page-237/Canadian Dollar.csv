4751898,Obabikon,2016-04-19 13:45:00,2370,"While it is currently pointed almost straight down, I don't think it will fluctuate that much in the next 3 months. I'm guessing for an exchange between 1.25 and 1.30 most of the summer. I hope so anyways."
4752050,adempsey,2016-04-19 14:19:00,963,"Oil is forecasted to slowly rise in price over the next two years [the US election will cause some temporary havoc though]. The value of the Canadian dollar usually follows. I doubt you will lose out by much, if any, if you wait though."
4752178,gonefishing13,2016-04-19 15:04:00,46,"We are in the same predicament and have decided to ride it out. The time to do it was back in like Jan/Feb when it was like $1.40. While the Canadian dollar has gained slightly the last 2 days, the forecast is for it to drop again as the price of oil drops. Since Iran is refusing to put a limit on their oil production, the rest of the oil markets won't either.. so the belief is that oil will start dropping again.."
4752426,Bakefish,2016-04-19 15:50:00,1077,I am offering 1.50 on the dollar. Just send your money or bank account number to my office in Nigeria.
4752602,Obabikon,2016-04-19 16:57:00,2370,"HAHAHAHAHAHA.... such a coincidence, I apparently have a long lost cousin from there that gave me 28million. Just waiting for the check!"
4755722,spw2350,2016-04-20 14:01:00,26,My brother and I booked our June trip in January. The amount due was $587 (canadian) @ that time exchange rate showed I would need $404 U.S. to cover it. I have been watching the rate go up. Today RBC Canada posts rate is $452 U.S. needed. Since I am retired on a fixed income I have been saving as much as possible but I still have to buy my license and incidentals... wish I had the money needed at booking time to take advantage of lower rate of exchange. (sigh)
4755882,adempsey,2016-04-20 14:45:00,963,"Sure, but the rate is still really good. It's been over 12 years since it's been at the current rate (well besides the past few months ;P)."
4755946,Obabikon,2016-04-20 15:00:00,2370,"What I've kind of said from the start of all this... exchange rates don't really matter. What you end up paying matters. He might not have booked the trip if he thought it was going to cost him $450 instead of $400. There are times when it saves you money, and times when it costs you money. It has everything to do with where it goes after prices are set."
