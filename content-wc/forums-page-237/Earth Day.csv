Along the way, I have ordered on-line from both Bass Pro and Cabelas. Next thing I know I am receiving catalogs on what seems like a weekly basis. While I love getting some of the stuff, I couldn't help but think what a waste of money and resources. Finally after receiving two more catalogs yesterday, I decided this morning it can't be that **** complicated to get off the list and of course it wasn't. Only took a minute. Nothing personal against either company, was at Bass Pro last night getting more stuff I really don't need. 800.237.4444 Cabelas 800.227.7776 Bass Pro or emailhttps://cabelas.custhelp.com/app/askhttps://basspro.custhelp.com/app/ask"
