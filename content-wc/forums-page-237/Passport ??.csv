4692986,spw2350,2016-04-01 04:37:00,26,"go to their website: travel.state.gov > Passports & International Travel > Your Passports and follow the instructions. You might have to go from passport info to passcard info page but the link will at least get you to the site. You can print out the form,fill it out then you have to mail it with your passport & a new passport photo and the check for $30."

4755842,Walleye_Guru,2016-04-20 14:38:00,62,"Remember - You do not need a passport to go to Canada - just a state issued pic id (usually your DL) and your birth certificate. Most people don't know that. You do not need a passport when driving into Canada.Technically you need one to reenter the US, but we have NEVER had an issue with our guests. Many to this day still dont have a passport.Good LuckPS - this is quoted from the CBSA web site""Identification requirements for U. S. citizens and permanent residentsIf you are a U.S. citizen, ensure you carry proof of citizenship such as a passport, birth certificate, a certificate of citizenship or naturalization, or a Certificate of Indian Status along with photo identification. If you are a U.S. permanent resident, ensure you carry proof of your status such as a U.S. Permanent Resident Card."""

4682490,hogridnfool,2016-03-28 22:39:00,349,"My Passport Book expires 11 months from now and rather than spending $110 to get it renewed I would like to get a Passport Card instead, so does anyone know if I have to pay $55 for the first time applicant for the Passport Card or the $30 fee for a renewed card? https://travel.state.gov/content/pas...-and-Card.html"
4682554,Guest,2016-03-29 00:44:00,0,"Personally, I'd go for the Passport again. It's only $11 a year over 10 years. Unless you plan to NEVER go flying international in the next 10 years, or need to make an emergency flight back home half way thru your Canadian fishing trip. then get the card. The card is only good for land border crossings, cant use it for international flights just my 2 pesos"
