Last rear I bought them at a bait store that would not take a credit card for them and charged full amount in US dollars. Felt like a rip off but we had already done everything before we were told the policy.

Your credit card company will determine the exchange rate on the date it processes your transaction. I happen to use VISA and have always been pleased with the exchange rate and the foreign currency fee. You might consider purchasing a three year license to take advantage of a favorable exchange rate. You were entitled to feel ripped off by the bait shop charging you in US currency. They made considerable money on your purchase. It's always been my policy to not reward bad business with future business."

Margitta McLeod and Luc Levesque of Fort Frances pleaded guilty and were each fined $3,000 for illegally importing live leeches into Ontario. Levesque was also fined $500 for not maintaining a commercial bait licence log book, as required by the ministry. The court heard that on June 27, 2015, McLeod entered Canada at Fort Frances Customs. During a secondary inspection of her vehicle, two bags of live leeches weighing 20 kilograms were discovered. An ensuing joint investigation involving the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry and the Canada Border Services Agency revealed that the leeches, purchased by McLeod in Orr, Minnesota, were being illegally imported for intended sale at Anglers Pro Shop. It was further determined that Levesque, owner of the bait store, was party to the offence. The investigation also found that Levesque was not maintaining proper documentation of his bait acquisitions and sales, as required by the conditions of his commercial baitfish harvester's licence. Justice of the Peace Pat Clysdale-Cornell heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Fort Frances, on March 11, 2016.The Ministry reminds the public that importing live organisms can threaten aquatic ecosystems by introducing invasive species, and transmitting pathogens such as parasites, viruses and bacteria not native to Ontario. To report a natural resources violation, call the MNRF TIPS line at 1-877-847-7667 toll-free any time or contact your local ministry office during regular business hours. You can also call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477)."
