I highly recommend them.Reasonable rates, clean well maintained, and really good fishing.http://clarksresorts.comEdit to add;Both Cedar Lake and the Indian chain are family friendly. They are small enough that you are unlikely to get lost and they rarely get windy enough to make fishing difficult. However they are large enough so that you shouldn't get bored. They are also fairly easy to fish with walleye in all the classic spots. Rocks, weeds, wood, flats, and open water. And you can catch them trolling, casting, jigging, rigging, etc.. And the fish bite good during the daytime."
4736698,Guest,2016-04-14 13:52:00,0,"With all due respect (maybe) the Chain has a HUGE walleye population, it's a numbers fishery with a chance for a big fish and in the last 5 years the pike have invaded the Chain from Corner Lake (due to high water over flow) lots of pike some big. The 3 camps on the Chain can rub elbows with almost any camp in the area and are at least 25% cheaper also. No crappie! Don't know where you got your info, but your walleye &pike info is wrong, fished the Chain for 25 years, now I go to Devils Lake, N.D. The Chain doesn't need to apologize to anyone.."
4738186,Skywagon,2016-04-15 06:00:00,1106,"Dinorwic is only slightly less muddy than Wabigoon. The Wabigoon river was dammed 100 years ago, raising the water level (creating the chain of lakes). Wabigoon and Dinorwic lakes both have a lot of clay soils which is interspersed with rock along the shoreline, when the water level was raised, the water started eroding the clay shorelines and continues to do so to this day, creating the muddy lake floor. After a windy day, areas of these two lakes looks like coffee with cream in it. You can see in many places where the clay has eventually eroded away to rock, I suspect some day in the distant future the shorelines will be mostly rock and the lakes will be much clearer."
4738554,Walleye will,2016-04-15 07:47:00,218,What lodge did you stay at? What is the average walleye size?
4739322,Guest,2016-04-15 11:02:00,0,"I owe you an apology Will, I had my taxes done Wed. and I turn into a BIG A$$hole for a couple of days afterward. We stayed at Indian Lake lodge with owners Bill Ballentyne and then Kevin and Karen Welniak (who now own Busters BBQ) in Vermilion Bay. My younger brother owns a cabin on Indian lake also. The Chain is a numbers fishery, all different year classes of fish, loads of different sizes, you usually work your way through abunch of eater wallys ( 13-15 inchers) to get to bigger fish, that's jig fishing, OR YOU TROLL CRANKS for the bigger fish. When you troll you'll also have a real good chance for a ""SKI"" or pike. Little Brother got a 30 and a 32 incher (walleye) last year and I saw on here that bobbylfishermon;s wife got a 51 inch musky last fall trolling for walleyes. I've heard nothing but good things about the new owners and the accomadation are still as good as anybodys and are still fairly priced, I would be glad to help out if you need more info.."
4739394,bobbylfishermon,2016-04-15 11:35:00,241,"Will, read your post and the ""carps"" He hit the nail on the head pretty much, If you need some help concerning the ""Chain"" PM me, glad to help out and I got my taxes done 2 weeks ago,I feel your pain carp!!"
4745034,Walleye will,2016-04-17 18:39:00,218,It's all good. Would you say the numbers are better then eagle? Also what kind of structure would you look for walleye on th Indian chain? Sounds like it's a pretty good multi species lake.
4746114,Guest,2016-04-18 07:59:00,0,"Nobody has numbers like Eagle except Lac Seul, Eagle was almost a dead sea years ago (netting) and the ministry put the slot into place and saved the lake along with the help of the camp owners. The Chain, Loads of fish,smaller water and any type of structure you could care for, rocky points, mud flats, weed beds, wood, suspending fish, it has it all. We went up spring and fall, everything that swims is ""UP"" shallow those times of the year, because that's where the forage is, after the second week in June, the fish go down and you fish rock piles and points ( 10-20 ft.) you know, summer haunts, my favorite though, casting shallow running cranks on the outside of stump fields, don't let warm water fool you, there are ALWAYS wallys in that wood, they are resident fish, they live there, yearound, until the cold water pushes them deep for the winter, plus you don't really assume it's a wally you've got on, could be a ski, smallie, pike whitefish. One thing though, The Chain is a very good fishery, but I loved to fish early and late( first 2 hours and last 2 hours of daylight) in those time slots things can be magical.Hope you find place, it's a great area.. Take Care"
4746314,bobbylfishermon,2016-04-18 08:32:00,241,"Great post Carp, I stay at Indian Lake Lodge and I think I know your brother, big guy (not fat)60ish, named AL, took him to EYE a couple years back, and he got a 28incher. That cat can drink some scotch, wish you still coming up, but I'll bet OPP is glad you're not......."
4746370,Guest,2016-04-18 08:36:00,0,"That's him bobby, make him pay for the scotch, he can afford it, miss the Chain, and the area, but we don't drive as well as we use to, have fun you guys!!!!"
4732122,Limeyangler,2016-04-13 04:27:00,563,"There are good numbers of walleye to be had, also bass, crappie (the crappie have exploded in numbers gonna post some ice fishing videos of them soon) good pike fishing and also huuuge muskie. I'd say the Dinorwic end of the chain is your best bet, plenty of camps to choose from and only 20 minutes from Dryden with it's Walmart, Safeway, Extra foods, 3 or 4 pharmacies, Canadian Tire etc etc .lol no I don't work for the Dryden Tourist Board."
4732530,Walleye will,2016-04-13 07:31:00,218,How are the hazards and water depth?
4733186,kcguy68,2016-04-13 10:42:00,51,"My brother and I spent our Summers on Eagle Lake and are still going up there to this day. As many of others have suggested, get a guide to show you some spots. Regardless of the lake you choose, a guide will make the trip much more productive."
4733538,rzep,2016-04-13 13:03:00,1196,"Is the paper plant still around in Dryden ? My biggest problem with the area was the chemical smell from the plant. Although, I have to admit, I never smelt it on the lake... only around the town ..."
4734002,kcguy68,2016-04-13 15:40:00,51,Paper mill is still up and running in Dryden.
4734066,Blue Lk,2016-04-13 16:27:00,269,"Will,you could also consider the Indian Lake chain,just north of Vermilion Bay."
4734362,Limeyangler,2016-04-13 18:33:00,563,"Just like Eagle there are many hazards to navigate, if you have a GPS you can download all the hazards on Wabigoon at this linkhttp://www.drydenyachtclub.com/wabigoon-hazards"
4735234,Skywagon,2016-04-14 06:08:00,1106,"If the family likes to swim, the water clarity is much better on Eagle than Wabigoon. The locals call it the muddy Wabigoon because of all the clay particles in the water. No worries from the mill, they have cleaned up their act in the last 15 years and the smell is much better than it used to be, the mercury pollution from the mill only effected the water flowing down the river from the mill (Clay lake was one recipient of that), but Wabigoon was given a clear bill of health."
4735586,Walleye will,2016-04-14 08:28:00,218,I've taken a good look at it and found the walleye population is down compared to eagle. Also I believe that there aren't crappie and lower pike population? I've heard it a really good muskie lake.
4735626,Walleye will,2016-04-14 08:30:00,218,Is Dinorwic muddy too?
4726330,Walleye will,2016-04-11 13:35:00,218,I have looked there but there arnt meny lodges in that area and that are resonably priced.
4726618,NARDA 1,2016-04-11 15:02:00,636,"+1 on what Danbear said. Check out www.birchdalelodge.com 807-227-5262 owners name is Marcel. Nice cabins and equipment and fairly priced. I'm headed up for my 28th year there this year, can't wait. Terry"
4727178,emma17,2016-04-11 17:26:00,436,"I know you said you want to stay away from LOW- and I won't question your reasoning. I will say that I used to say the same thing as I always envisioned a bunch of boat traffic, ruining the peace and tranquility I wanted. My wife and I now go to Witch Bay on Lake of the Woods and it is a great family place and very peaceful. She won't even consider another place. Eagle Lake is great too. Best of luck."
4727218,fishinnut 3446,2016-04-11 17:37:00,638,"What Gord said ! Never stayed with Gord but got to meet him when my Son/Daughter had a fuel problem with my boat and was towed to his place, good guy and cold OV ! I do stay at that place those 2 Knuckleheads Danbear and NARDA stay at All kidding aside Eagle is a great lake to fish and Greg and Cal are great guides! and have had the pleasure of staying in camp with Danbear/NARDA 2-3 time the last couple yrs. just try to plan the trip around Terry's wing night"
4727730,Nimstug,2016-04-11 19:40:00,2605,Shush!
4727890,brant,2016-04-11 20:22:00,89,Don't overlook Vermilion Bay Lodge. Gord and Suzanne will take awesome care of you.
4728810,Walleye will,2016-04-12 07:38:00,218,I was worried about the boat traffic cabins and hazards. Ive also heard go things about walleye and even crappie for the family on LOTW.
4729786,Limeyangler,2016-04-12 10:34:00,563,Wabigoon?
4730026,Walleye will,2016-04-12 11:48:00,218,Would you recommend it for walleye? And also a place to stay at?
4731890,fishinnut 3446,2016-04-12 20:52:00,638,Is the the lake that guy Simon lives and fishes on with all those great videos ?
4724802,Walleye will,2016-04-11 07:38:00,218,I'm trying to get in a last minute family trip to Ontario. We cant go north of vermilion bay and would lake to avoid LOTW. The only family friendly lake (for numbers of fish) I can think of is eagle. I was wondering if anyone agreed with me or had a different idea? We would stay in the vermilion bay area and would like to got for walleye and pike mostly.
4724978,Skywagon,2016-04-11 08:08:00,1106,"I think Eagle would be a great choice using your perimeters, good fishing and plenty of camps to chose from."
4725026,Walleye will,2016-04-11 08:11:00,218,How would u suggest fishing for them? Jigging and bottom bouncing rock humps? And casting for pike in weed beds?
4725074,Guest,2016-04-11 08:21:00,0,"Eagle isn't much different than LOTW, and being new to the area , hire a guide for at least one day.Tons of lakes, and tons of camps in the Dryden, Vermilion Bay area, punch in Sunset Country, Ontario on your computer, tons of choices."
4725138,v-bay gord,2016-04-11 08:31:00,3168,You might consider hiring Greg or Cal for a day or two........www.eagleeyeguiding.com www.calritchie.com
4725202,Skywagon,2016-04-11 08:48:00,1106,Gord made a good recommendation on hiring a guide. He will show you the ropes (and rocks) plus help with what techniques and locations will be best for the time of the season you are there.
4725474,strength22,2016-04-11 09:37:00,49,"My opinion only...i stay away from such big lakes. I know fishing is good but i do not like to fish LOTW, lac seul or eagle....just too big for me...again..my feelings only. I would rather find a smaller more maneagable lake to fish."
4725802,ftfarms,2016-04-11 11:22:00,444,If your not wanting lotws why not the west part of rainy lake. When I think of taking the family I like less of a drive. It's hard to beat the pike fishing in that area and walleye fishing is as good as anywhere.
4725962,wallydave,2016-04-11 11:54:00,2151,Will check with PJ Aka Pat and Frank aka Breezypoint! They are going back to VBL and saying with Gord.
4726026,Danbear,2016-04-11 12:14:00,72,I have been going to Eagle for 8 years and my group enjoys it. We stay at Birchdale Lodge and love the place but there are many other fishing camps to choose from. You will have to decide what side of the lake you want to be on. The west arm has many protected bays to fish in which for me is a plus when the wind picks up. Hope you get to go and have a great time.
