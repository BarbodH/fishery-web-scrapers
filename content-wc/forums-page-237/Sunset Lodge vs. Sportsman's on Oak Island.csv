I'm curious to see if anyone has stayed at both of these lodges and if one has a clear edge over the other in terms of quality. Pricing seems to be fairly similar except they seem to charge a bit more for the guides out of Sportsman's. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated... Thanks"
4720082,stillangling,2016-04-09 13:29:00,149,Why not just stay on the Ontario side? I have made the trip to the Angle a few times now and could never understand why anyone would bother staying there considering the fact that almost all of the angling from these resorts takes place in Ontario. You have to call into customs everytime you cross. I have been told that some of the resorts advise otherwise because they want to downplay the pain in the a%$ factor. If anyone tells you that you can cross without calling they should not be listened to. Not sure about then rest of you but i like a bit of a break during the day. A trip back to Oak or an after dinner fish all require another call to customs and in order to do that you either have to go to Cyclone Island or Young's Bay. The last time i was at the Angle there was a long line of people trying to get through to Canada Customs. It is easy if you have a RABC but they are not free and only make sense if you are a frequent visitor to the Angle. Another issue is bait. You cannot cross with live bait other than worms. Dead minnows are just not as effective as a lively one. I also like to have leeches as an option.

Sportsman's is in Bobby's Bay on the East side of the island with a nice view. Sunset is on the west side with a rock break wall for safe harbor and a beautiful view of sunsets and Flag island. Never used the guides but I know they network and would guide out of either place. Dan Schmidt guides out of Sunset very good and willing to help you out in any case. You will catch fish in MN you will catch more across the border. If you have any other questions PM"

Yes, you have to check in each day. You can do it over the phone however at 800-Can-Pass. You do not need to go to you Young's Bay just to make that call. One way around this however is to get the Canada RABC card that was mentioned as well above. This stands for remote access border crossing. You can print out the application online at home and bring it up with you to have it approved at a border crossing. This eliminates the phone call each morning if you plan to fish on the Ontario side of any body of water where a border crossing station is not present. It costs $35 and is good for a year. Plus, you can put your entire family on the same application so they are all covered. I used mine this weekend up on the Rainy River. You cannot go wrong with Sunset. They are great people and it is a nice facility. Good luck!!"

Like the RABC program it sounds like you need a squeeky clean backgroud to qualify. In spite of attempts to downplay the significance you are still crossing an international boundary. Personally, i would not want that stress on a fishing trip but maybe it is just me. Crossing borders and dealing with customs people always wiggs me out a little. I always have a sigh of relief when i am done with that experience. The fewer times the better for me at least"
4749002,Flag Island,2016-04-18 20:21:00,32,"Both resorts are nice and both are different. sunset has a new lodge with bar and is very nice. If you go with their meal plan you do not get a lot of options. Dan Schmidt went back to Flag Island Resort which was a huge loss to them. Otherwise their bar menu is a short menu. Sportsmans has a nice meal option as you order off the menu and it is a nice menu. Sportsmans guides are pretty tight lipped about giving out advice, not like Dan S. Calling in to Can-Pass is easy but the remote pass is very nice. If you stay in Mn you also can have a Mn limit so that is a plus. You won't lose with either one."
