There I was about to mention the string yank method to remove a hook but ziggyzag beat me to it!The hook removal method is described with animation here: http://www.netknots.com/fishing_knot...l-string-yank/There are a bunch of YouTube videos showing actual cases. One is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkvsnb2qvSYThis method works very well. I've had to use it three times to remove hooks from fishing partners hands. Three suggestions from my experience:1) DO NOT try to pull the hook out. Yank it out with one very quick, hard yank.2) Have a boot lace in your boat and in your tackle or gear bag. The last thing you want is for the line to break so you have to do it twice. Been there, done that.3) Never allow anyone in your boat to grab or hold a fish that's been caught on a multi-hook lure, especially a lure with multiple treble hooks - with or without the barbs pinched down. It's an invitation to get a hand hooked, or worse. Land everything with a net or Boga type grip.As REW says, Be Safe."

Hard to hold a finder steady enough so a good yank can be accomplished. Particularly with kids. I think the push through and cut off the barb method might be better. Had it happen to me -- sunk a hook in the meat of my index finger. We pushed the hood through, cut off the barb, pulled the hook out and kept fishing."
4741322,spoonchucker,2016-04-16 05:57:00,82,Tell the guy you are going to yank on the count of three then do it on two - it avoids the tensing up or the pull away. Yank with fishing line or shoelace you have in tackle box really works and especially easy if you fish barbless.
4741754,last chance,2016-04-16 07:54:00,3262,just be sure to push down on the hook so the barb doesn't catch so bad on the way out.
4742298,Moondog,2016-04-16 11:22:00,362,"The danger in pushing the hook thru cutting off the barb, pulling it out or even cutting the eye and pushing it on thru is.......infection and nerve damage. As for the nerve damage it depends on where the hook is. As for the infection you are contaminating the wound worse by increasing the track of the hook and pushing or pulling it thru or out. The best method is the yank it back the way it came method. You won't wreck anything that isn't already wrecked nor introduce anymore infection than has already entered. And it works great!!! Be sure to watch the video however! Also helps if you have a little lidocaine in your first aid kit. Keeps those pesky ""patients"" from pulling back in anticipation."

That is just idiotic and a great way to stick a hook really deep in your hand if it pops loose. Of course, a thrashing fish can do it all on its own. I understand the desire to be gentle with fish that are going to be released, but I'm not going to take a risk on personal safety over it. I keep an old ribbed rubber car mat on the floor in the back. The fish gets netted and set down on the mat. Very little of the fish is in contact and a minimal amount of slime wipes off. I can extract the hook without squeezing it or torquing on its gills."

After that little ordeal the son netted the fish and releast it for me."
4751842,jerry1928,2016-04-19 13:20:00,216,We had to remove a hook once in my boat. One exception was I hooked my Drahthaar under the tongue when he grabbed my jig as it comer over the side of the boat. My buddy got hooked in the finger by a pesky trout that was flopping around in the bottom of the boat. I didn't know about the method to pull it out the way it came in so we tried to push it through to cut off the barb. My fishing buddy has some tough hands and we tried and tried to push the hook through but all it would do was push up the skin. We finally had to use a second set of pliers to press down on both sides of the hook while we tried to push the hook through. We got is done and went back to fishing.
