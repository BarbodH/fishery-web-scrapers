The thought is to head out to the islands off shore to locate a decent spot to camp and then fish as the water conditions allow. Looking for advice, stories or other thoughts? Thanks!!"

4704738,speckmaster,2016-04-04 18:48:00,17,Not sure if I'd ever leave my vehicle at that launch. Heard some interesting stories...

Good Fishing Pikeman"
4737386,MikeinMN,2016-04-14 18:39:00,190,"Pikeman, did you fish for lake trout while at Onaman?"
4739810,vteye,2016-04-15 14:10:00,812,What weeks have you been there? Thanks
4744010,PIKEMAN330,2016-04-17 09:34:00,101,We have not fished for lakers but others at camp have.We have been there first week of June and last week of Aug. Spring is better for Pike on Nipigon because of weed groth.In spring we fish very shallow and close to shore.In the late summer they are as you know they are much deeper and harder to find.Eyes are better later in the river because of suckers spanning and sometimes season opening.River goes by the lake rules up to first falls which is above camp. Good fishing Pikeman
