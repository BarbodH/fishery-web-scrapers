4721586,Clairebear,2016-04-10 06:35:00,937,I would look up a few of the school bus companies in and around London. Langs comes to mind and they are located in Strathroy. They have a lot of multiple passenger vans for school purposes. I know of groups who have rented to travel to sporting events. You may need a certain class of licence depending on how many passengers. Good luck.
4729042,acplumber,2016-04-12 08:14:00,80,Thx for all of the replysNone of them panned outSo we are taking my ford work van instead. We are bolting seats to the floor with belts. Gunna have a ton of room. And we r going tow a 4x8 utility trailer to so we have lotsa leg room. I'll post some pics with a report when we get back
4711066,acplumber,2016-04-06 14:47:00,80,"Hello everyone. A group of six of us are going on a flying in out of Nakina and wanted to rent a full-size passenger van. Out of London or nearby area. Does anyone know of a rental company that does rent these styles of vans? I have checked all the rental places and no one does this, the only place that I have found is Bennett sales and rentals and they're way too much Thx"
4711122,adempsey,2016-04-06 15:08:00,963,"I assume you want something larger than a Dodge Grand Caravan, which is what most places rent?"
4711194,acplumber,2016-04-06 15:44:00,80,"Yes by the time 6 big dudes get in. There isn't much room for our gear. We took a mini van with six of us 4 years ago and had a utility trailer and it worked great. But we used my brothers van then which won't make it now. I have a Ford e-250 work van. Might have to find some seats, if there's no place else"
4711258,Mike Borger,2016-04-06 15:57:00,1554,"Just for fun I did a search. Do exactly what I did and you'll be golden. Go on expedia.ca and do a specific search for rental vehicles in London, Ontario and vicinity. My search had me picking the vehicle up on a Friday morning and returning it 8 days later on Saturday evening.Refine the search by selecting only ""van"" (not mini van) in the menu bar on the left.It appears as though I can rent an 8 passenger commercial van from Enterprise in London, ON for a grand total of $444 Canadian.Your welcome. https://www.expedia.ca/"
4713186,acplumber,2016-04-07 08:25:00,80,Thx mike I tried the same thing. But wouldn't do it for me. So I called enterprise and they said all of their cargo vans were all 2 seaters.
4713330,Mike Borger,2016-04-07 08:52:00,1554,I just tried again and it worked for me LOL!
4713930,adempsey,2016-04-07 11:37:00,963,"Might be easier to rent a U-Haul trailer and a minivan/SUV. An enclosed utility trailer is $120 to $160+ CDN, depending on size, for 8 days.I think the Expedia results vary by the date you put in. The Enterprise website sucks too. The older website is still available and is OK, but I couldn't get a passenger van to come up at all no matter what I did."
4716450,oleJoe,2016-04-08 08:32:00,114,We rent a big ford passenger van and have them take the back seat out to put our gear in. They are not as big as they use to be but got all the gear in for 6. Taking 8 this year so its going to be super tight. But we will make it work. Will be in Nakina in 48 days. Have a good trip
4716714,ziggyzag,2016-04-08 10:31:00,125,ole joe: we will be in Nakina in 48 days! what lake are you flying to?
4720594,youngknight,2016-04-09 17:46:00,228,"If you were planning on renting a vehicle AND a trailer, be aware that few if any places rent vehicles set up for towing...even pick up trucks places I have tried forbid towing...an insurance thing I think."
