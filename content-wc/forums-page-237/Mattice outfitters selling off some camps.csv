4735986,Mike Borger,2016-04-14 10:22:00,1554,"I've heard the same comment that the clients are all old and dying off from a bunch of outfitters. I can say with confidence that in general bookings this year industry wide have been incredible, probably because of the strong U.S. dollar. My take is the fly in industry is as strong as ever, maybe even starting to grow. I know a number of outfitters who just bought camps and are looking for more. There is always turnover and change. Most outfitters know going in they're temporary caretakers of the resource."
4736890,phishfearme,2016-04-14 15:30:00,1242,"I hope you are correct but it's not the experience my most recent outfitters have expressed. the best test would be to see what the trend is for what these LUP's are selling for - maybe there's an industry average that is available for trending - or if the agents consider this a buyer or seller market. it is costly to maintain the LUP's and one outfitter I've used tried to sell a few of his and never even got an offer. my evidence is certainly anecdotal and limited but years ago I would have to book a lake in the fall or winter to get anything for the following year - there's just no need for that now (except possibly for june) - and a one-two month season cannot be good for profitability. I frankly think most outfitter do these flyin fishing trips because they love to outfit and/or it holds them over till moose season - not for profitability. also, the large majority of flyin outfitter post rates in US dollars so the exchange rate is mainly irrelevant. phish"
4737010,Old Timer,2016-04-14 16:12:00,255,"I agree with Phishfearme. The recruitment of new young fishermen/women is way off, especially for those who pay their own way. A fishing friend of mine was in the hunting and fishing industry for many years. Before leaving the business e purchased market research that revealed that Canada camps were just trading back and forth the same pool of fishermen who were getting older and older every year. Now there is an age class falling by the wayside each year without new recruits to fill their spots. Sad, but very true."
4737146,pikeman14,2016-04-14 17:28:00,144,"Over the winter Don did mention that he thought most Canadian fishermen were getting too old to do the trips. I thought it was odd that he called my group the new generation. We are all about 40, but I guess I get it. We had someone show us the ropes when we were younger and now it's up to us to pass it along to the new group of kids. It is odd how kids don't even play outside nowadays. Hopefully mlo is just scaling back in preparation for retirement instead of being pushed into it."
4737666,BrianE,2016-04-14 20:31:00,98,"Pretty much what i have heard from outfitters at the shows, think about it? how many young fisherman attend the All Canada shows? unfortunately not enough.I know of two groups who had been going to Canada for some years, one of them used to be a group of six that drove in just over the MN border, that group is now down to two, the other has not gone in years and the youngest is in his mid fifty's, the rest have been too old to go for some time.Kelly & Maureen's operation went down over the years (they were third generation in the business) and said the younger generation is doing other things like playing Golf, etc. they just could not see a viable business in the future and sold to MLO.Some years ago Kelly & Maureen had a booth for a couple of days at McCormick Place in Chicago and received deposits from i think they said 16 groups! imagine! those days long gone they said.As for my experience it seems the majority of the fisherman are over 50, very unfortunate. My son is 15 but probably would not have the patience, loves Hockey, video games & friends but some day i will drag him up there."
4737778,michigan walleye guy,2016-04-14 21:35:00,95,"I have booked Auger Lake for late May/early June, and can't wait to get up there. My first time with MLO. Have always gone with Nestor Falls Outposts, this is my first time with a different outfitter. I also travel with my family to the Gunflint Trail area of Minnesota several times each summer. Gunflint Lodge, which has been owned and operated by the Kerfoot family forever, it seems, is also for sale, and I, for one, will be very sad to see it change hands. But, Bruce and Sue are well into their seventies, and, understandably, are looking to retire. I do know that each of their sons tried their hands at running the resort for several years, but ultimately decided that the extremely time-consuming duties involved in running a lodge of that size got to be too much. I know that Gunflint is trying to sell off more than a few of their cabins, too. My point of all this is I wish good things in vacationing and fishing would never have to change, but they do. Sadly. Just have to love and appreciate those special places and people while we can."
4737818,adempsey,2016-04-14 21:57:00,963,"I know a lot of guys who would go with me on a fly-in fishing trip. Problem is, they have no money or no time or both. These aren't inexpensive trips either."
4737866,BrianE,2016-04-14 22:51:00,98,"Well you made a good choice, Don & Annette run a first class operation with very nice cabins, should have no trouble catching lots of fish."
4738346,youngknight,2016-04-15 07:08:00,228,"Amazing where a thread goes. Anyhow, I think declining population of fishermen taking these trips may have a lot of other factors than kids not going outside anymore or just playing video games. If that is true, I think we have to take some responsibility for that. Let's face it, kids of today - I..e. from true kids up to even 30 year olds where raised with both parents working normally so no one around when you get home from school or having to go to an after school babysitter, in an age where you didn't play outside without supervision for fear of all the bad things that can happen. Most of us when we grew up you were shown the door and away you went...see you at 6 for supper sort of thing. Sure, head on down to the creek down the road on your bike, see you in 8 hours. Any parent that allows that now and something bad happens - a landslide of condemnation for letting their kid out of their sight. Then so many parents for years have using the TV as the babysitter. I have a couple of kids in their 20s who are resourceful and hard working but employment income and opportunity for advancement is not great, certainly a lot less than 30 years ago when I was in their same position...so the price of a fly in fishing trip is pretty steep...especially for a young married guy who has a wife that wants to spend a week in the south...how do you afford both. Lastly, do we do enough, or have we done enough to take kids fishing...not just the big outings, but patiently sitting on the dock with our kids, putting on worms and taking of sunfish? My dad's hunt camp decided that if they invited sons along, there would be too many, so no sons were invited...now they are all 80+ or dead...hasn't been a hunt for almost 10 years - the traditions of that camp has completely died. So Point is, it is easy to point the fingers at young people and say they just want to be inside and play video games instead of playing outside and going fishing...think we need to look a little harder at the reasons for that."
4740818,Sidge61,2016-04-15 20:44:00,59,"Your right, it is not us older adults the resorts need to address and attract but the younger they need to attract and hold to keep coming for years. Last summer my two brothers in their late 40's/early 50's went with their 2 sons age 14 and 17. The lodge (Ghost River) made a comment that they are not looking at getting my brothers there year after year but pointed to their sons and said they are the ones we need to keep coming back because they are our future. They get it. Having a father/son or daughter deal is great. My son is older now (25) and plans on going to Canada once college bills are paid. Wish more resorts had a husband/wife package because we all know the wife does drive a lot of when and where we go!!!"
4741066,BrianE,2016-04-16 00:06:00,98,Agree...great post and pretty much this.
4738434,youngknight,2016-04-15 07:20:00,228,"...as a follow up note and perhaps a little more directly tied to the thread. I give two thumbs up to outfitters that offer great deals to dads with kids. I do NOT give thumbs down to those that do not because I don't understand their business - but they don't get my thumbs down but also not my business. My first fly in with my son was with Air Cochrane - half price for a child 14 and under...no restrictions like requiring at least 2 adults sharing or anything like that. Some camps have no kids specials or pretty insignificant ones - e.g. under 12 %25 off when accompanied by 2 adults.. While I will not comment on the viability of kids specials - I'm not in the business - I will say that if we all - camps included - want to get kids going as the next generation - the ones with the meaningful rate specials for kids and families will be more successful. (I understand that the seat in the plane and the fuel in the boat costs the same whether the client is 13 or 33). Certainly, when I have browsed websites on outfitters - I spend about 2 minutes on a site that has given minor cost savings on kids - and much more on the sites like Air Cochrane (and there are others) that have meaningful price reductions that encourage and allow dads to take their kids on these trips which hopefully they will continue on their own later. My 2 cents. My financial resources are limited so the camps that are reasonably priced and offer a good deal for a Father and Son trip..those are the ones that will get my serious consideration for the fishing trip with my number 1 fishing partner."
4732674,youngknight,2016-04-13 08:14:00,228,"Wishful dreaming about someday owning a little camp on a northern lake I was browsing some websites of properties for sale. Came across a page with Mattice Lake Outfitters selling 5 of their camps including one on Vick Lake which was recently inquired about and their Mojikit Lake camp - the same one Mike Borger wrote out about. Website also mentioned about two planes being also available. Camp on Troutfly and 2 camps on Hurst Lake were the other camps. Found this a bit surprising as MLO gets such good reviews and common mentions that I would have thought they would expand their business, not shrink it or are they getting out of it altogether. Ad also states that camps on other lakes could be made available or at a later date. Price tag for the 5 camps offered - $325,000 Cdn. which is ~$250,000 US."
4732770,Mike Borger,2016-04-13 08:34:00,1554,"They've been trying to sell some of those camps for years but Vick and Mojikit is new. Not sure what's up, but I'd buy the Mojikit camp in a heartbeat if I had the money."
4732786,youngknight,2016-04-13 08:38:00,228,"I went back and reread your trip report to Mojikit...and yep, that would be a pretty sweet spot. I could see spending a few weeks a year there until retirement, then spend most of the summer there...enough water to explore that it wouldn't get old. Out of idle, wishful thinking curiosity - do you remember how long a flight it was into Mojikit from Armstrong?"
4732810,adempsey,2016-04-13 08:41:00,963,"Camps change hands all the time, for example over a dozen have changed hands this year so far. People retire or get worn out and want to move on. Sometimes it's best to streamline the operation or get a return on your investment; and other times it's a good time to expand. It's like any other business.Besides, I believe that website has been up for over 3 years . It's no indication of the health of the operation."
4732826,youngknight,2016-04-13 08:45:00,228,"I hear ya Adam. With camps on other lakes being possibly made available and two float planes available...was just wondering. That Mojikit Lake camp looks so nice with updates - would seem one that a business would want to hold onto but then I know my business..I don't know their's? For the record, in no way was my post meant to cast any shadow over the place or make people nervous of booking with them...their reputation from what I have read in a number of forums should speak for itself."
4732874,Mike Borger,2016-04-13 08:53:00,1554,I agree totally! Only problem is commercial LUP'S can't be sold to the public. Once acquired one has to show that they're viable businesses. That said I know certain camps have been purchased privately recently - there always seems to be loopholes available.Flight was roughly 30 mins I think?
4734218,smithcr1981,2016-04-13 17:45:00,42,I booked a trip with MLO for short lake this September. I have nothing but high hopes. it seems they do have a lot of camps and may slimming down a bit to keep the quality up to where there return customers expect. what should I expect at short lake? any info would be helpful
4734290,BrianE,2016-04-13 18:06:00,98,"You are right Mike, Don & Annette told our group a few years ago that they were thinking to retire and if the right deal came along that they would sell out. I guess Austin & Marina do not want to continue with the business? They purchased Kelly & Maureen's operation a few years ago and the newer cabin on Mojikit was theirs, Don has an older cabin across (12 o'clock) Mojikit but they were looking to burn it down (may have by now) as they did some others on other lakes (Don showed us some pictures of the cabins burning ), said he has to pay an annual $1000 fee to the Canadian government and said they were not worth keeping. I looked into purchasing a cabin in that area but as you said you have to have an outfitter permit and or a viable business to qualify, i did talk to a couple of outfitter's and they told me that they would in no way sell to someone who does not have a business. Appreciate all your input."
4734378,Mike Borger,2016-04-13 18:36:00,1554,Don's original cabin is still there on Mojikit along with a fleet of 14' Lunds lying there in the grass. We took shelter in it when a huge thunderstorm rolled in when we were there in September.It's still standing but is getting pretty worn down. The dock is pretty much gone...
4735674,phishfearme,2016-04-14 08:41:00,1242,"we've used Mattice quite a few times - one of the best around. two years ago we chatted with Don on his dock about how the flyin business is going and he said bookings are down and his costs are way up - ""i'm watching my clients die off and there's no one replacing them"". my view is that not too long ago you really had to flyin to lakes to get really great fishing - but the slot regulations, catch/release and lower creel limits have allowed drive-to or boat-in lakes to provide excellent fishing without the high cost of flying - not to mention weight limits and weather risks. Mattice is totally flyin lakes. and - there's just fewer kids coming up raised around the outdoors to replace us old farts - they have the internet and video games. Don and Annette are not that old at all - I think they may just see the future for flyin lakes as not all that good and are slowly getting out. phish"
