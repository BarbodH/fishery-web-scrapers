4752466,ziggyzag,2016-04-19 15:55:00,125,Hey headed to Nakina the 27th of May with (14) guys and was wondering what the average price of Canadian beer was running? We will be taking (20) cases and just was thinking we might as well get it across the border maybe even have our outfitter take it in early to avoid the overweight that comes along with so many cases of beer and pop. Also this would allow us to each take a bottle across apiece. LETS Party!! Getting excited!! Which would be better buying the beer or Booze across the border price wise compared to buying in the states?
4752698,phishfearme,2016-04-19 17:29:00,1242,"in general, for your ""one bottle of booze or one case of beer"" duty free allotment going across the border - choose the booze as it's more expensive than beer in Canada. you can get the duty free booze and buy cases of beer (cans) at the duty free store then declare them going across the border. in general, this is cheaper than buying beer in Canada but after the duty, it ain't much of a savings and paying the duty could cost you half hour sometimes more. ask your outfitter how much he charges for a case of beer ""at the cabin"" - so you can avoid weight problems. some outfitters take beer/pop in and only charge what they pay and others add a significant fee. it's up to you but I'm usually up for letting the outfitter make a few bucks - the convenience to me (and you) should be worth it. phish"
4752786,Slushfish,2016-04-19 18:05:00,263,"X2 what phishfearme said. For us, what little you save at duty free isn't worth the extra stop to pay the duty. But, that's just me. We have this discussion every time we take someone new to our camp. Some people get excited about saving the couple bucks a case. Once I get in the truck, I'd rather pay the extra cash and not have to stop."
4752810,Hidden Bay Lodge,2016-04-19 18:12:00,12,"PFM has good info there.Here some more:Case of 24 - 355ml case of Blue at the beer store is $38.95 cad today. 24 usually goes on sale during the summer.Same case of beer at the US duty free store in International falls, last time I checked $18 usd.you are allowed 1 case of 24 beers or 1 1.14 liter bottle of booze rum, vodka, what ever duty free.You can bring more above you duty free allowance, you just might have to pay duty. Depending on the officer that day. They may give you a break or not. Depends on how friendly they are and you are that day.let say you have to pay the duty. Different duties for the different provinces you enter into. But lets use Ontario today. You pay on the Canadian dollar about of the item. So $18usd beer is $22.23 cad today. you could pay is $11.66 for a total of 33.89cad or $26.26usdNow the hard stuff. Say you buy a 750ml of smirnoff vodka at 40%AV for $11us south of the border. I looked online for a price. Its then $14.19 cad. The duty you would pay today is $16.41cad today for a total of $30.60 cad or $23.71 usd with the duty. Same bottle at the LCBO is $26.75 cad.I was told by boys manning the border. The dont total the duty on a per person basis in a car. That would take time. They do the whole car at once regardless of the number of peeps in the car. 4 guys in the car, they minus 4 duty free allowances and work with the rest.They also told me, have your receipts at the ready. Keep your receipts for all the booze you buy south of the border. Saves them for looking to rates on the line. and who knows what prices they might find. Probably will be more. Keep your receipts, save you and them time. The more prepared you are the betterOntario have very high Personal Alcohol import limit. It's 45 liters you can cross the border with into Ontario. Manitoba is no limit where most of the others are only 9 liters.Hope this helps!Shaggy"

4753474,Hidden Bay Lodge,2016-04-20 01:11:00,12,"Hey Dave!Ya, the border folks are pretty good usually. Respect them they will respect you.If folks are over a case or two, CBSA usually lets it slide.Great luck with the with the charity auction Dave!Cant wait for the season to start!Shaggy"
4754770,Bakefish,2016-04-20 09:39:00,1077,"I've had to pay more often than not. Lately though, they seem to be a little more lax on collecting duty. We prefer to take our own brand and have no problem paying the duty. When they ask about alcohol I always answer that I'm over on the beer. Right then they decide if we pay or not. Really not much of a problem."
4754890,Obabikon,2016-04-20 10:22:00,2370,http://www.lcbo.com/content/lcbo/en.html#.VxesDzArLIU There's LCBO's website. They have all their prices.
4755202,Bstar,2016-04-20 11:18:00,564,We have always bought ours at home and paid the duty at the the border. It always surprises me at how little the duty turns out to be. Most of the time they will credit you the hard liquor duty free and you pay on the beer. It never took long to pay either. Sounds like you guys will need a trailer and an extra plane just for your party stuff! Have a good time!
4756378,ziggyzag,2016-04-20 17:16:00,125,Thanks Bstar: We will have a great time and a great party for the week. I guess we decided to buy all the beer and booze at the duty free store and have our outfitter fly in some extra beer pre flight. To all who responded Thanks and everyone have a safe and fun fishing season!!
