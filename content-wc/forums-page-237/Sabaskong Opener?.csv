4743530,ftfarms,2016-04-17 05:07:00,444,In my mind it all depends on how you want to fish. That time of year we pitch jigs and troll rigs and when it's time for a break we go to slip bobbers and a jig. We always start in the Sandy areas with small rocks mixed in. We do alot of shallow fishing than. Less that ten foot.
