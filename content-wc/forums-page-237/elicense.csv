4733058,J Arendt,2016-04-13 09:55:00,45,Just putting this out as an time saving measure for those who want to. Just purchased my fishing license on line took less than 3 minutes. Now have in my wallet and one less thing to do upon arrival in camp.
4733074,deputy dog,2016-04-13 09:56:00,305,can you do this for quebec also?
4733130,J Arendt,2016-04-13 10:16:00,45,This was an Ontario purchase

4733570,fishlipz09,2016-04-13 13:20:00,26,How much convenience fee did they charge you for their convenience?
4733610,camp chef,2016-04-13 13:36:00,915,No extra charge......I buy my license this way every year. Already in my pocket for May.
4734050,Moondog,2016-04-13 16:21:00,362,I actually watched the exchange rate and when it went to 70 cents on the dollar I bought my license. We get annual licenses so maybe saved a few bucks!
4734138,Downrigger,2016-04-13 16:58:00,60,"I also renewed my Outdoor Card and purchased the Ontario 2016 fishing license. I printed out a temporary Outdoor Card, and a permanent card followed in the mail a couple weeks later. I printed out the fishing license which I have in my file. I have received nothing in the mail. My question is then, is my printed license all I will have and/or need? Thanks, Phil"
4734162,camp chef,2016-04-13 17:03:00,915,yes....nothing will come in the mail
4734202,oleJoe,2016-04-13 17:17:00,114,"I get my license thru e-license every year. So much easier. One of the guys in our group got his license and out door card this year and on the back of the outdoor card it had his license for the week we are going. That's a first for me but always print out 3 copies of the license in case I lose one. I also got my Canadian money already from my bank . I,m ready!! Just waiting now. Have a good trip."
