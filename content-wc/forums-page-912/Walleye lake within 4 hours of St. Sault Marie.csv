I know there are good michigan lakes and I do fish in that area, I'm sure I'll get blasted for wanting to go north, any thoughts are appreciated though.Thanks, Joe"
525978,Guest,2002-12-17 19:58:00,0,Just about every lake around Wawa has good Walleye action. I worked there for a couple of years and the fishing is pretty good. Nothing compaired to where I live now but you can't go wrong.Wawa is about -2hrs from St. Sault Marie Ontario.
