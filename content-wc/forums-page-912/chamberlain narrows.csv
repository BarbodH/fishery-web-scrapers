By far August was the best time with the warmer weather. The staff will point you in the right direction for fishing spots. No guides are necessary. Walleyes are present just about everywhere. 50 to 100 15 to 22 inch fish per person are the norm with a 28 incher coming in every now and then. The last two times I was there we took a day and devoted it to northern fishing resulting is a great day of action. On another day we sat around with some other guests and fished off the dock. We had a blast. We had a pot luck barbecue and caught fish all day. Accomodations are nice as the owner has poured a lot of money into the resort over the last several years. Sometimes they might be missing a few things or some maintenance is deferred, but if you let them know they get right on it. All in all this is a good spot to spend some vaction time."
