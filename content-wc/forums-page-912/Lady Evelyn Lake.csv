525603,Guest,2002-11-26 15:46:00,0,We are planning a trip to this lake next spring and are staying at Island 10 lodge. Does anyone have any fishing reports or fishing info about Lady Evelyn Lake. Any info would be appreciated.
525604,WillieB,2002-11-26 20:41:00,292,You might want to post your question on www.ontariofishing.netThey have a lot of folks on there thru that area.
525605,Guest,2002-11-27 17:35:00,0,"MD Musky,You're going to be staying at a very nice lodge. I have fishedLady Evelyn Lake 5-6 times over the 90s, but only once in the Spring.I have stayed at the Island 10 lodge most visits, but the last visitwas at the Red Pine Lodge....not as ""upscale"" as Island 10, but Ibrought in my own boat (as well as my son, so I was paying for 2);and Red Pine had good food and clean accommodations.You'll most likely be fishing down towards the main river and severalweed beds in back bays; as well as another arm that has a waterfalls(the folks at Island 10 will give you good info).My son and I did well on twister tails worked over a stump field,and off island points....most fish around 2 lbs, but there are somewalleye that go up to the mid teens (far and few). There are alsolarge Northern Pike in the lake, and decent side lakes if you wishto do a ""walk-in"", though I never have done so myself.The lake is beautiful and you should enjoy yourselves."
525606,Guest,2002-12-05 20:59:00,0,"I have heard that this lake has some really big walleyes, but they are hard to find. We will be there during the opening week. I spoke to one guy who told me that his group only caught one small eye in a full week of fishing. Anyone have any info that may help us locate fish on Lady Evelyn Lake."
525607,Guest,2002-12-11 10:47:00,0,also am planning on going up to island 10.how many lodges on this lake? any one else been there and can add to this?
525608,Guest,2002-12-11 11:18:00,0,"Spent a week on Lady Evelyn 2 yrs ago. 6 guys. 2 of us are die hard walleye anglers, talked to the locals, got the hot spot maps, asked others in boats, lodge owners etc.... and guess what NOT ONE WALLEYE ALL WEEK! and certainly not for a lack of trying, we fished 10 hours a day, gave up on the walleye and cought lots of pike and some SM. Everyone says the fish are ""Stacked"" in the narrows but nobody could catch any.My general comments on Lady Evelyn.Would I recommend it? - if you like large lakes and searching all overWill we be going back? - noWe have done much better on many other lakes.I think there are 3 outfitters on the lake by the way.Just my 2 cents, I have heard about people doing well there or else I would have never gone.Good luckKevin"
525609,Guest,2002-12-12 14:25:00,0,"kevin,is there some place that you would reccomend?drive-in,fly-in,american,housekeeping..it doesn't matter.thanks in advance"
525610,Guest,2002-12-13 10:02:00,0,"Where, when, what do you want to catch? how much do you want to spend?"
525611,Guest,2002-12-13 11:00:00,0,"kevin, where is up for debate...most sites except island 10 have been north west ontario..hopefully this june/july but new jobs might nix this hope,so even as far away as june/july '04.we would like eyes,northern,maybe lakers,musky...we just want to enjoy and not be in a place with a lot of traffic.one lodge on a lake would be ideal.as far as the $$$$$,it's a first time for two of those going,so we wanna do it up right.any one with suggestions ,feel free to add them.like every one always says......get references before you send your money and this is as good a place as there is.thanks to every one in advance."
