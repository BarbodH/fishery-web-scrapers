525823,Guest,2002-12-09 18:15:00,0,generally the lodge owner where you stay can put you in touch with a guide that is familiar with their section of the lake.
525824,Guest,2002-12-09 19:21:00,0,I know a great guide for you. I'll let him know and he can post a response right here.
525825,Guest,2002-12-10 13:19:00,0,Contact Evergreen Lodge in Ear Falls. Gary guides quite a bit.

525827,Guest,2002-12-11 14:18:00,0,Best Pike Guide on the lake is J.R. Derksen...The sad news is that J.R. is only on the lake one week a year and he is fully booked. If one would contact him and twist his tail a little he might help you [email protected]
525828,Guest,2002-12-11 23:10:00,0,I don't think I would hire a guide for a lake that size that only spends one week on it?
525829,Guest,2002-12-23 12:54:00,0,"You really don't need a guide unless you have never fished before. This is the best lake/river/flowage I have ever fished. And we went up in late July. Merry Xmas,2Fishy"
