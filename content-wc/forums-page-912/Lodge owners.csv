525969,Guest,2002-12-20 16:40:00,0,"Sorry I did not mean to cause all this. What I was refering to was the post like ""top rated walleye lakes in Ontario"". Not very many posts said anything more than this lake is great call Bill at www.??? I have fished Canada for 7 years but I don't know the outfitters web address. I just thought it would be nice to hear about the amount of fish you caught and the size, did you see any bear or moose. Everthing sounds like advertisments."
525970,Trailerguy,2002-12-21 13:17:00,1407,"Paul, Don't feel bad, you have to realize some of these guys only come here to whine and cry, being able to P on someone's parade is the high spot in there day."
525971,Guest,2002-12-21 16:22:00,0,"I am a lodge owner and many times when I post I do not identify myself as such, but guess I should in the future, so everyone will know to be careful of what I say. I understand where you are coming from and appreciate the skepticism of posts by guests....you never know who they are and never really know their motives. I use my real name so those that know me might comment or email me back. I have not posted anything recently because I felt like some viewers would see it as a commercial etc...Unlike many lodge owners I do fish! That's why I bought a lodge."
525962,Guest,2002-12-16 22:06:00,0,"oh boy, here we go again."
525963,AL,2002-12-17 03:33:00,89,I feel violated. I always do what is being accussed. I truly give my experiences when asked including the names of lodges and owners that have treated me well. I guess I need to stop being so naive.
525957,shadowalker,2002-12-17 08:59:00,101,stratman you didnt leave your e-mail address so i cant contact you.
525958,stratman,2002-12-17 09:41:00,16,"Shadowalker, just click on my email box in the upper right corner of my page. When the page pops up it won't show the email but just type the message and click send. Thanks"
525964,Mike KS,2002-12-17 13:13:00,18,"Al, Dont feel so bad. There are a lot of us who speak the truth about the places that we have enjoyed fishing at. That as I see it is one of the goals of this site. Anyone who picks a place to fish should do extensive research into that choice...but hopefully information provided at Walleye Central can help the party looking for a great fishing trip."
525965,ackermannsacre,2002-12-17 13:44:00,196,"Aaron, you are such a wealth of information. You make the experience of coming to this site so enlighting. Can we all just stay with you when we get ready to go fishing, you do have enough boats don't you?Bill"
525959,Guest,2002-12-17 13:54:00,0,"why do I still show as a guest user when I signed up a couple of weeks ago?DavePhx, az"
525966,Guest,2002-12-18 01:07:00,0,"As a long time guest user of this site, I have learned to recognize posts by other long time guest users. Not only by name, but also with the syntax and style in which they write. For example, I value posts that are made by REW. He is a guest user. I can also recognize his ""style"",-to the point and factual. However, am I happy to give that value to all guest posts? I try to use due diligence.Also, just because the post may be from a member does not mean that this divests them from any unpronounced promotional slant. When a more recognized user has had their name ""stolen""-typically the person will speak up. Again, sometimes use your instincts and apply due diligence."
525967,WillieB,2002-12-18 06:12:00,292,"I love the sound of a well contrived conspiracy. I wonder if there's any input on ""the grassy knoll"" or ""pristine bullet"" theories?"
525968,Guest,2002-12-18 14:38:00,0,"Good advice Bob, I really enjoy this site and love to read the posts.DavePhx,AZ"
525948,Guest,2002-12-16 13:57:00,0,"This would be a great site if the lodge owners would stop putting up fake posts just to advertise there lodges. All the winter shows are just ahead of us, save your sales pitches for the shows. For what its worth. Thanks"
525949,daveaz,2002-12-16 14:24:00,16,I agree its hard to tell if its truley a recommendation or just a lodge owner in disguise.
525953,Reels,2002-12-16 16:53:00,2876,Who are you reffering too?<{{}}><
525954,oneforseed,2002-12-16 17:25:00,65,"i have quit listening to the guest users for reccomendations for lodges.you can't be sure if they are customers or owners...now if you're a guest user and the customer of a lodge then sign up and log on and i'll listen to what you have to say.i don't mean to p*** you off who ever you are,but there are alot of us out here that want to spend our money in canada and have the trip that we have decided on thru this site to be what we were told it would be."
525955,shadowalker,2002-12-16 18:04:00,101,"im not sure about who or when but i sure hope that tommy from camp narrows lodge comes to indiana or somewhere close to ohio,,,,shadowalker"
525950,Guest,2002-12-16 19:49:00,0,"i think you mean those posts that go something like this-------------------""considering lodge abc on lake abc. anyone got any experience with them?"" then you get the posts that say the owners (always mentioning them by their first names) walk on water. then a couple of posts later comes the guy who says ""our group has been going there for 75 years and always stay at lodge abc, it's great"". then a little later on comes the guy that says our boat of 2 usually catch 800 to 1000 walleye per day and many of them are over 40"". sometimes, when we tire of walleye, we throw lures for pike and muskie, catching many in the 80-90"" range."" and finally comes the guy who helpfully posts the website. and, did you ever notice that those posts never die? they can be on page 4 and someone finds them and bumps them to the top. those the kinda posts you are referring to?"
525951,sdyer,2002-12-16 20:07:00,34,"Whit,you said it perfectly. it always seems that those posts are ""happy"" if you know what i mean."
525952,Guest,2002-12-16 20:18:00,0,"duffy, actually some outfitters are very open and honest about identifying themselves when posting. i salute them. others are very suspect, or as you say ""happy""."
525956,stratman,2002-12-16 20:43:00,16,"Shadowalker, could you elaborate on this ? If not could you email me as I was looking at that website and considered it a possibility."
525961,Guest,2002-12-16 21:42:00,0,"IT makes me sick too,lodge owners have homeshows to do all winter.Thats why this site caters to lodges,amateur fisherman and people that honestly dont know that they are just deposit slips.I wish there was an alternative,there is!"
