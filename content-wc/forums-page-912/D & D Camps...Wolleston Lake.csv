525973,Larry L,2002-12-19 21:46:00,335,Very nice people. Reasonable prices. I haven't fished there since they sold their outposts. My brother has fished out of their Wolloston Lake lodge and considers it fair fishing. His party caught two Northerns just over 40 lbs each at one of their fly-ins several years ago and are spoiled though. You can trailer your own boat to the lodge. The last two hundred miles north of La Ronge can be bad in sloppy weather. Dust and traffic can also be bad. I think that they catch some dandy lakers when everything falls together. The last time I was there it was early June and some of the bays on Wolloston were still frozen. Good luck. Larry
