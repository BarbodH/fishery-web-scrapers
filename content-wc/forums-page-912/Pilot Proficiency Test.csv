Santa is no exception and has agreed to take the test.The instructor arrives and Santa invites him aboard his sleigh. The instructor replies asking for Santa to wait a minute while he goes into the shed for something. He come out with a shotgun and sits himself down in the sleigh.Santa asks,... What is the shotgun for???The instructor replies,.... We have to simulate a partial engine failure.Happy Holidays CF-JFX"

I'm going now to talk to the elves about getting a special gift for your wife that requires you to be home on the weekends. Maybe if you leave a fifth of Jacks special brew instead of that Milk and cookies I'll think of putting you on the A list next year.
