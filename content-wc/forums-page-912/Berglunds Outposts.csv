If the area seems to be unknown to most, the reason would be the lack of tourist campsin that area.The lakes are relatively inaccessible (not too bad by snowmachine) and and have not attracted tourist camps (maybe due to the preponderence of trout - Americans generally favour walleye).Ignace Airways has fly ins to Irene and Berglunds has the outpost on Nora. I am sure that the owners of either will be glad to fill you in on fishing opportunities in the area.There is great fishing south of the highway but it is remote. Trying to find good fishing holes on your own would be a waste of valuable fishing time. Go with the locals."
525658,Guest,2002-11-30 19:10:00,0,Does anyone know anything about Berglunds Outposts on Nora lake? I believe it is located south of Ignace.
525659,Guest,2002-12-04 18:49:00,0,I cannot beleive that no one knows anything about Berglunds. Please help me out.
525660,Guest,2002-12-05 07:32:00,0,I searched the Canada Message board including archives and didn't find anything of interest. I note that http://www.justfishontario.com has a link for Fishing Reports. Berglunds Outposts is discussed but I think the latest post is August or September. It might be worth looking over the various posts over there.
525661,Guest,2002-12-06 16:31:00,0,"Since nobody knows anything about Berglunds. Can anyone help me out with info. about Nora lake, quality of fishing, summer & winter. Please help me out, I have a buddy that wants to head up there.TMMN"
525662,Guest,2002-12-07 19:09:00,0,"I am a tourist operator in the Ignace area so normally just readthe posts to see what people want. But since no one else can answer you..I and many Ignace locals ice fish Nora for trout - great fishing. From what I understand it's a great summer lake too. A short portage takes you to White Otter Lake and the castle and more good fishing if you need it. Berglunds have a newly redone outpost on Nora Lake so you're not looking at staying in a dump. I have never stayed there but it looks good. Lake is big, very little activity on it due to remote location. Lots of bays and islands. Worth a trip for the scenery alone but I am sure the fishing will be excellent."

525665,Guest,2002-12-10 05:29:00,0,"Barbara, Do you have any other suggestions for the lakes south of Ignace? We are looking for lg. walleyes & lg. lake trout. Any help would be appreciated."
525666,Guest,2002-12-14 15:57:00,0,"It seems from the lack of responses,that this area between Ignace & Atikokon is largely an unknown area, or is not a very favorable area. It is such a huge area, with a large amount of lakes. Is it all locked up with Crown land? Any help would be appreciated please.I have heard from a very small group of people about this area. Is it a well kept secret?I have heard about Nora lake & White Otter Lake, but there are 1000's of other lakes in the area.Please help with any information. I am not asking anyone to give up any their secret lakes, just a general layout of the area."
525667,Guest,2002-12-14 17:21:00,0,"tmmn, i do not think that anyone is holding back info on you. you will find that the regulars on this board are very sharing. if it's great, they will let you know. if it's a dump, they will let you know. i believe that you have hit on a spot that folks here are unfamiliar with. my advice to you would be to call the owners and ask for references from folks who have fished the lake around the time (weeks) you are considering. they should have nothing to hide and will probably share those names and numbers with you."
