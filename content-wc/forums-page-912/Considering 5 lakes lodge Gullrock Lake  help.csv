525254,Guest,2002-10-31 07:08:00,0,Am not familiar with Five Lakes but have stayed at Poplar Point Resort several years. No matter where you stay the fishing will be good.
525255,Guest,2002-10-31 19:26:00,0,JeffI fish the Gullrock and stay at Five Lakes Lodge. The owners are Bud and Melinda Murray. This coming year 2003 will be my 5th year going. I have had great fishing each and every year. The camp owners are very fair. We go the last week of July first week of August. Fishing is always good. You will catch many walleye. Jeff J
525256,Guest,2002-11-01 12:11:00,0,Next year will be my 15th year @ Gullrock. Wonderful fishing. I have always stayed at Weavers Camp. Nice clean affordable camp.
525257,Guest,2002-11-05 09:18:00,0,I also have been going to Gullrock for a long time fishing is great I've been there all different time thru the summer and had great fishing everytime I started going to another camp but swicthed to 5lakes lodge a couple years ago and plan on keep going back. The owners do a good job.

(first of August) Very good fishing for walleyes (don't expect Northerns or small mouth) and the lodge was excellent. Plan to go back. As a side benefit your close to the main highway and can get into Red Lake within 15 min. to play golf or eat if you get tired of your own cooking. Golf course was excellent.(Fished mornings, played golf afternoons and fished again in evenings...don't get much better than that!)"
525259,Dave,2002-11-14 07:24:00,258,"We followed Bud up from his old camp on Cliff lake. The fishing is 100times better on Gullrock and the other lakes. Bud and his family go out of thier way to make sure have a good time he put cable wire in our cabin so we could watch the Tiwns games last year.(we bring a satelite dish up with us,we're not hardcore fishermen)"
