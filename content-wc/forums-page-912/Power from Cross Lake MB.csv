Seems like Minnesota (Exel Energy) wants to buy about a billion dollars of power from MB Hydro, but the people of Cross Lake are pissed about the sale to Minnesota because of the damage the dam has already done, and this sale to MN will make it even worse. I am not sure if its a compensation issue or what, but the pictures of the shore line looked real bad. Anyone know the real story? Thanksdw"

If the utility wants to construct a dam, they construct it! If it means displacing and relocating an entire community of people, so be it! Such practices in the name of progress, have been carried out for generations. There's always been controversy surrounding hydro's policies, but in the end, they have the final say. Don't get the wrong impression about this utility, theyact in the best interest of the province. If it means moving an entire community of people and relocating them somewhere else, they people do receive compensation?"
