525784,Guest,2002-12-07 14:03:00,0,"Mark,I fished the lake about 25 years ago. A good muskie and smallmouth lake. You could drift into a bay and see several fish that you would assume to be pike, but they would be muskie, as there are no pike in the lake. Mepps spinners with squirrel tails worked great. Biggest muskie was 6-1/2 lbs, but we fished only for bass with small baits, so probably would have gotten some bigger muskies have we tried. There are also some lake trout, and a few walleyes, according to a French speaking guide who we talked to. He was the manager of a large fly-in camp located on a large island. The camp was owned by Westinghouse, or another large corporation and was used to treat their special customers. I don't think it is still operating, could be wrong. I believe one or two camps now have fly-in cabins on the lake. The presure is probably still fairly light, although I heard that some kind of rough road now goes to it, but cannot confirm this. It is a very pretty lake; the lakes connecting it were also good for smallmouth.We portaged in with canoes and small boats and only fished 3 days, staying in tents, camped. It takes 5 portages to get in.Have fun.Bill K"
525785,Dave,2002-12-09 07:54:00,258,Mark:Red Deer Lodge out of Nestor Falls may still have cabin there. Winter phone 941-639-9134 Wayne & Herma Puckett. I fished it for smallies back in the mid 80's. It may have lake trout too? Good luck.Dave
525786,Guest,2002-12-09 09:27:00,0,fished the lake about 10 times in the 90scamped when we started and rented a cabin the last few yearsalways brought our own boats in through the portages saw a few big boys........ nothing in the boat over 42 inches......... but lots of themif your fishing for the 50 ++ odds aren't good..... LOTW much better option
525787,Guest,2002-12-10 10:28:00,0,"Mark,Been on Kish about six times over the past 15 years. By far my favorite lake in Ontario to fish. I've done a few portages and flown in a few times. Tinkers has a cabin they rent there. Very pretty lake with tons of smallmouth. I never really fished for the Musky but you sure couldn't keep them off your line. Caught six in one day late May of 98 with the largest being 45 inches. I witnessed my fishing partner catch the largest Musky I've ever witnessed being caught.....it was a whopping 51 inches, it was a monster. He caught it on a mini silver rattle trap. There are also decent numbers of large mouth and trout in that lake, no walleye or pike to speak of. When we would string a few small bass to eat for dinner on the stringer you could look over the side of the boat and see big musky following them.....this is a lake you don't let your guard down on. I would highly recommend Kish."
