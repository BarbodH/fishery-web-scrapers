Our group was there this year and caught hundreds of small walleye. The last couple days the bigger one's began showing up, so all in all it was a good trip.Need some help though. What kind of structure will the post spawn fish set up on in this portion of the lake? Long tapering points, sand flats,etc? We found what could be some favorite spots, but would like to figure this part of the lake out a little more and the type structure to look for.Any help would be greatly appreciated.eyesnatcher"

I would talk to your outfitter and find out the spawning ares close to you and fish them and the adjacent areas that will provide passage to the main lake. Look for areas that provide structure close to deep water and use your electronics to help you locate heavy baitfish concentrations. The Walleye will be hungry after spawning and windy points or flats provide excellent feeding areas. We have the best luck that time of year fishing very slow and staying as close to the bottom as possible. Jigs with Minnows or Leechs are the best for us. Look for entrances to bays,creeks and smaller lakes and fish your way from the back of those areas to the front and on out to where deep water begins......GOOD LUCK"

It is not that far, especially if you are at Anderson's outpost at Kekabekka(?) Narrows.The NE corner of the island across from the camp has very good structure as well. And of course never rule out Skidoo point area.Good luck."

Should be wild action with some in the 8-10 range. Have done early many times and it works good. That time of year, you might find them right in Chamberlain Narrows right out front of Ojibway Outposts."
