525363,Thumper,2002-11-12 18:35:00,133,30inches is a pretty average winter in NW Ontario. I prefer icefishing out of a shack to summer fishing. We are always busy at work in the summer and winter is our relaxation time. walleye run larger as well and the Northern lights and winter landscape is awesome.We're getting close to hauling shacks now...a few more weeks.
525364,Guest,2002-11-12 19:33:00,0,"do you move these houses around? do the fish stay put, or do they move around?"
525367,manitobawalleye,2002-11-12 19:38:00,885,"they are both good units...friends have jiffy's i have had strikemaster for 20 years...bought a lazer mag last year and have no complaints...the old one is with a friend still drilling holes without complaint...drilled many many holes guiding and fishing with friends through ice up to 4' thick stayed with strikemaster because they are lighter and whatever one you purchase unless you are a serious piker the 8"" has never left me wanting a 10""...p.s. used a tanaka years ago surveying...nice and light also, only concern is availability of parts and qualified repairmen in your area... seem to be not as ruggedly built if you sled in for lakers"
525365,Thumper,2002-11-13 05:35:00,133,"I fish out of an 8x16. It is comfortable. We fish on a shoal that has deep and shallow areas and we stay on fish pretty much the entire winter. We have no need to move but they can be moved with a little work. I move closer to spring into an area where the fish hold for their spawning runs. Some of the boys use lightweight ""day shacks"" with a wood stove in them and will move around quite a bit."
525366,Guest,2002-11-13 11:22:00,0,sounds like fun. good luck. keep warm.
525368,Stevie B,2002-12-13 10:34:00,157,"I personaly have never had a problem with a Jiffy. For the last 3 years I have helped put on a ice fishing derby. Every year we drill 1000-1500 holes. The only problem is ice building up near the motor. Some years we have had up to 40"" of ice. Personly there are faster augers out there than the 8"" 3hp jiffy, but I don't think that they would have the durabilty that the Jiffy blade has. The last hole cuts just as fast as the first one.Keep your line in the water!"
525369,Bobby,2002-12-16 11:14:00,211,"I'm leaning toward the Jiffy Legend 31, I believe its called, 3hp 10"" blade, with teflon. I won't bother with Jiffy's new Stealth - who wants to look down at that yellow stripe around the shaft, going around and around around and...I'm getting sick..."
525370,Guest,2002-12-16 13:01:00,0,"Hey while on the subject of augers, could someone tell me if a 3 h.p. auger is the way to go or would a 2 h.p. auger do the job? And is the extra horsepower to go through thicker ice or for speed? Thanks in advance."
525371,Bill P,2002-12-17 07:45:00,2,As far as any two stroke engines go always use a fresh mix. In the bricklaying business we have seen more saws die from old gas than anything else. Instead of mixing up 5 gallons at a time we only mix 1 gallon and if it is not used up in 2 weeks we make up a fresh batch. Since doing this we blow very few engines and they start better.
525360,Guest,2002-12-17 08:23:00,0,"Hi,I fixed several Jiffy's with the same problem, stalling and not kicking in to power.All I did was play with the carb adjustments. They all work fine now except for one of them. No matter what I did it kept stalling while idleing and at full throttle (still not kicking into power at full throttle either).Roger Mayer"
525352,Bobby,2002-11-10 21:53:00,211,"Thinking about maybe getting a gas auger this winter. Which make and/or model would be the best one to get? Haven't put much research into this, however have always heard good things about Jiffy."
525353,Backwater Eddy,2002-11-11 07:49:00,3871,"If your looking at a new model I would say take a good hard look at the new StealthÂ™ by Jiffy.For reopening old holes it will be very hard to beat. They really hog through all types of ice well. www.jiffyonice.com/products_stealth.htmEd ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson...><sUMo>Backwater Guiding""Ed on the RED"""
525354,Guest,2002-11-11 17:31:00,0,"I own a 10"" Jiffy and its the biggest POS out there. The thing hasn't run right ever, stalls all the time and it doesn't like to kick into power mode.Had the thing in the shop numerous times replacing this and that, then they told me the gas cap was no good.EVERYONE I know that owns a Jiffy as well has had nothing but problems around here.I have a friend who owns a strike king power auger, its only 8"" but the thing will run and run no problems.Go figure.. the strike king is 1/4 less the cost of a Jiffy.For what its worth, I'll NEVER own another Jiffy again!!"
525355,Northern Manitoban,2002-11-11 19:46:00,195,Piece of crap? everyone you know that has one has problems with them? like what kind of problems?I ice fish 6 months of the year and my Jiffy has cut thousands of holes so has most other people i know on the ice.I have never seen or heard anybody that i know have a problem with theres.Except one person.But he didn't know how to operate it properly.Jiffy makes a great auger and i'm sure theres other good brands also.FISH ON.
525356,gms,2002-11-11 22:27:00,91,"Sorry about that Northern Manitoban, but a very good friend of mine experiance exactly the same problems with his 10"" Jiffy. Actually the Fishin Hole actually ended up giving him a new one. Fortunately the second worked very well.I do agree however that I have seen many more ""great"" ones than duds. Unfortunately when it comes to ""engines"" it is hard to find anything other than a Tecumseh power unit. What I think is great is the Teflon coated blade on the Jiffy.A partner of mine has had a Tanaka for over 17 years and the thing still keeps a ticking (power head), did eventually replace the auger portion with a Eskimo 2 blade unit. Starts first pull every time. Note sure if you can get these anymore.One think extremely nice about a Tanaka Head is the choke assembly that is easily manipulated with the ""biggest of mitts"". Not sure what one was thinking when they decide where to put the choke assembly on the Jiffy.A nice feature on the ""upper"" end jiffys is the nice pull handle which I believe is only on the 3hp Tecumseh. Same story here, you can get your big bulky mitts on this one to give it a tug.Myself I have owned an Eskimo for the past 6 years and have not too many complaints other than its ability to ""warm"" up after I have used it and put it down for a couple of hours in the cold. The first startup is always easy....after that I really have to ""feather"" the throttle delicately for a long time until it warms up real good."
525359,Guest,2002-11-11 22:30:00,0,Hey allI had a magnum and burnt out the motor is 3 yrs so I got a jiffyhad nothing but trouble with it ....was brand new took it out ...it would not start...took it back they fixed some carberator problem ....took it out again....carberator leeked gas down side of motor ...took it back....they fix carberator ...took it fishing...would not start...took it back....lol u get the idea!well I went and bought a tanaka ...it is a japan made ice auger. Wow I love it!! have had it for about 8 yrs ..runs great! Is light and easy to carry ....and cuts holes sweet !it also takes a magnum bottom end so u can use the d icer if u want tooany way it is something else to consider!Good fishing all!
525357,Backwater Eddy,2002-11-12 05:35:00,3871,"I think you and your friend may have fuel problems Eh.I have owned several Jiffy augers and as long as I take good care of them, they do the same for me.Mix and treat your fuel properly and 99.9% of all your problem should go away. Your high speed jet is not set right the way it sounds too, that is why it will not open up at speed. If the carb is all plugged up with goo that would do it I would say.

525358,chrism,2002-11-12 13:28:00,429,"I have to side with Ed here - most problems I have seen with these units is related to fuel. I have never had a problem starting mine (3 pulls max) even in the coldest of weather, but I'm anal about what goes into it...I use fresh premium gas, the right amount of seafoam, and Amsoil 100:1 - 2 stroke oil mixed at 50:1.It works everytime... auger, chainsaw, weedwacker - never a problem starting any of these engines.Oh yes - I have a 2hp 10"" strikemaster lazer and it works great - going on year 6 and never has it let me down!Chris"
525361,Thumper,2002-11-12 16:05:00,133,I own a 9in Jiffy and its ok...Never had any problems and it always goes. I have cut lotta of holes with it. I used a Strike King last year and was really impressed. Lighter and faster than the jiffy. I'd have a long hard look at that one before you buy.
525362,Guest,2002-11-12 17:33:00,0,"ice fishing, what a horrible thought. sounds really cold to me. how thick does that ice get up there? brrrrrrr."
