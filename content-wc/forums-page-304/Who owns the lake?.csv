3169505,Obabikon,2014-09-11 14:47:00,2370,Minnetonka and Lake of the Woods aren't very comparable in my opinion.
3169729,Manitou,2014-09-11 16:30:00,125,"We have a ""water lot"" in the City of Kenora. It is ""in front of"" a land lot.It allows us to have a boat house. Not sure on the specifics of the dimensions or legal rights.But we pay the ""rent"" for this lot to the province.There is also the ""Crown Reserve"" which is 1 chain length (about 60') of every shoreline on the lake, unless you have purchased this reserve from the province through the Ministry of Natural Resources."
3170769,tv4fish,2014-09-12 06:47:00,2694,"Manitou: Are you referring to the ""road allowance strip"" (66 feet)? http://www.ontariorealestatesource.c...20Own%20It.pdfThat is interesting (and perhaps archaic). A lot of people think that Minnesota had/has a similar law - but that is not the case."
3171073,LOW1,2014-09-12 08:23:00,2828,"Unfortunately not all states are as enlightened as Minnesota is on that issue.http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ia-suprem...t/1307162.htmlIn this case the Iowa Supreme Court decided that a 30 acre lake was not navigable because historically if had not been used in commerce but only for recreation. This meant that a lakeshore owner, whose deed included portions of the lake bottom, could exclude other lakeshore owners and the public from using the portion of the lake described in his deed. It also meant that the lake bottom owner could drain the lake to extract the gravel, etc from ""their"" property. The decision notes that Minnesota and many other states have a different rule. Also Minnesota and Ontario with the fur trade, etc of course have a much more extensive history of using its water for commerce than does Iowa and also has far more natural lakes than does Iowa.Overall its a bad decision for Iowa which hopefully will change some day."
3171225,tv4fish,2014-09-12 09:14:00,2694,"LOW1: As soon as I read that - that changes everything (at least in Minnesota). Ownership of the bed of a non-meandered body of water - as per the original PLS (Public Land Survey) IS in private ownership. If at the time of the PLS - a body of water (lake) appeared to be less than 50 acres, it was not meandered, and therefore could be owned privately.I have to admit - that was an interesting read, however."
3171305,LOW1,2014-09-12 09:28:00,2828,"I think Minnesota takes a different and far better approach to the problem than does Iowa. And in Iowa there are a number of man made lakes which were formed by damming rivers and streams which may have been navigable. Are these lakes also ""navigable""? For what it's worth the historical level of the Lake of the Woods was significantly raised in the early 1900s by the dams at Kenora - does that make the increased portion of it manmade?."
3171385,tv4fish,2014-09-12 09:49:00,2694,"I don't want to ""get into trouble"" with the Mods - since this thread is under ""Canada, Eh"" - but I think you and I could have an interesting discussion about water rights elsewhere......."
3166481,Obabikon,2014-09-10 13:42:00,2370,"I think you miss understood what I was saying. However, what you said is correct. ""medical care for guests injured on the property"".... if below the high water mark is not my property, I don't believe it would be covered on my insurance. But, the leasing of the surrounding water covers everyone playing below the high water mark. So, the question goes to... if a NON guest is fishing on the leased portion of lake, and is injured... with out any negligence... and wants my insurance to cover it, I would probably have to. Technically, if the water is low, and leasing does nothing for privatization, they could park a houseboat on the shore line. Anything below the high water mark is ""crown land"". I know this isn't very realistic, because I don't think anyone could be that big of a jerk. However, people do constantly amaze us. I still believe that the leasing of the surrounding water entitles the leaser to have some control over it."
3166489,Obabikon,2014-09-10 13:44:00,2370,Interesting... I will have to ask the MOE specifically.
3166569,BreezyPoint,2014-09-10 14:06:00,1581,"You know, I fish docks frequently and I think a lot of common sense should prevail. I never fish the docks of a resort as I think that is impinging on the guest's stay and the desire for a little privacy on their vacation. I also never fish a dock when someone is home and using the property. Quite a few years ago, property owners on Deer Lake, WI asked the DNR to remove the muskies because musky fisherman were casting big lures around the docks while children were playing. So I think dock fishing is OK, but we should be extra cautious when and where we do it.Frank"
3166681,LOW1,2014-09-10 14:34:00,2828,If you do have a true lease on the water then I think the leased area would be part of your premises and covered under the med pay portion of the policy. I have seen policies which provide med pay coverage for everyone and others which provide coverage to guests and invitees only. But I have no idea of what Ontario law on that is or what it's policies typically say. And your health care system may also have a bearing on who pays. I'd run this by your lawyer and/or insurance agent. One of the reasons why you may not have a true lease is because of the difficulty/impossibility of determining the area that you leased. What is the size and the dimensions of the leased area? A hundred meters? Any other specific area? One would think that a lease would have to have a description of the property which has been leased.
3166841,bigwillies,2014-09-10 15:57:00,515,i know the feeling.watched a guy clang a spinnerbait off the back of my outboard when my boat was at the dock.all i could do was throw a couple f bombs at him.now have a slingshot handy if it ever happens again.
3168801,Wawajake,2014-09-11 10:08:00,413,Glad to see someone has it correct ............thanks phishfearme. Extremely few leases or land ownership in Ontario cover water bed rights when the water is crownland. Only exceptions types are if the private land was flooded for example for hydroelectric dam then the water bed rights are maintained with the private owner........see details at this government site https://www.ontario.ca/environment-a...ement-policies Any lodge owner that is chasing away fishermen that got onto the lake legally is 99% in the wrong.
3169073,BreezyPoint,2014-09-11 11:57:00,1581,"Wrong or not, I say again common courtesy should prevail. For example, in Obabikon's case you would have to be fishing right on top of the dock to catch those crappies (I have seen his dock and his guests fishing it). It just doesn't seem like the right thing to do. I wouldn't expect that at Red Wing where I stay. It just doesn't match the experience I expect, especially on such a vast body of water with thousands of place to fish.Frank"
3169089,tv4fish,2014-09-11 12:01:00,2694,"Just a FWIW: The Canadian definition of ""navigability"" is very similar to ours - basically, if you can float a canoe on it, it's navigable.Quote: Wrong or not, I say again common courtesy should prevail While I agree - have you ever seen how they fish docks on Lake Minnetonka???"
3169153,BreezyPoint,2014-09-11 12:17:00,1581,"I have fished the docks many times on Minnetonka, but never when people were home (if I could determine that) and certainly never when they were outside using their property.Frank"
3169497,Obabikon,2014-09-11 14:46:00,2370,"Interesting discussion. I may have to adjust the way I handle these situations moving forward. However, my guests pay for a service, and it is my job to ensure that they enjoy every minute they have here. My success as an owner depends on that. We work very hard to have a good/positive reputation."
3163905,pwbmlr,2014-09-09 13:56:00,37,"So on our last car ride home from a fly in trip we got into the conversation of who owns the lake? We all think that the Providence owns the lake and and the land surrounding it and then the outfitters have to lease the rights to the lake and land. Are we right? If so, do they do long term contracts? I guess we questioned it because if they only leased the lake/land we thought it would be a large risk to do major improvements to the camp if you have the possibility of not getting your lease renewed. Also, what stops them from leasing the lake to more than one outfitter?"
3164281,bigwillies,2014-09-09 15:42:00,515,as far as i know nobody owns the lake.the camp may own the property but not the lake.usually fly in camps are remote enough u just don't see antbody else.
3164433,Obabikon,2014-09-09 16:19:00,2370,"Each situation is different. Our property is deeded property (we own it up to the high water mark), we pay property tax on it, and we do NOT have any type of lease program for the island. Many private cabins were set up on 100 year leases or ""life time"" leases. Much of that depends on what the government was doing when the land was originally purchased. I don't know of any resorts that were set up on long term leases. That is simply because the value of a resort on a lease program would be VERY minimal. I can't think of anyone who would buy something that eventually would be lost. Even if there's 50 years left on it, and you only hold it for 30.... by the time you go to sell it, the value is gone. We do, however, lease the water around the resort for the purpose of construction out over the lake. That's something to keep in mind when fishing around camps. Many people have come by and fished out docks for crappie... I've politely asked them to leave. Having had a few debates with the inevitable ""you don't own the water"" comment. I don't own it, but I lease the rights to it. In the same way, when someone rents an apartment, it is only for them and their guests. Food for thought."
3164601,bigwillies,2014-09-09 17:28:00,515,did not know u guys leased the water around the resorts.good to know.had a situation last year at the neighbors camp(private) where a couple guys were acually casting over kids swimming to fish the docks.neadless to say things got ugly.when the o.p.p showed up they said to put markers out for a swimming area so they can't fish.that was news to me too.
3164753,phishfearme,2014-09-09 19:11:00,1242,"much of Ontario uses the LUP process - land use permit - which applies to ""crown land"" - land owned by all Canadians. an LUP may be issued for a cabin, a boat cache, etc. but these LUPs DO NOT give sole rights to the water - the public is welcome as long as they can get there (and legally camp for example). so who owns the water in crown land lakes - the Ontario/Canadian people. north of about the 51 parallel - there are native rights that complicate the process - usually the local natives are involved in permitting. LUPs are issued for differing durations - a permanent structure LUP may be for 99 years - a boat cache 10 years, etc. but abuse of the LUP can result in cancellation which has happened to a number of outfitters we've used. the LUP rights vary significantly from region to region. phish"
3165657,BrianinVA,2014-09-10 08:11:00,160,I'd be interested in seeing the actual verbiage of the land lease that gives sole access to water around docks to camp owners.
3166081,LOW1,2014-09-10 10:30:00,2828,"So would I. Our dock and boathouse is at a prime spot for smallmouth but I would never begin to think that the water was ""ours."" In fact I enjoy watching people fishing in the area. And I would never assume that getting MNR permission to install a dock or whatever somehow created an exclusive property right to use the area around the improvement. Perhaps its different for resorts, though."
3166113,Obabikon,2014-09-10 10:55:00,2370,"Interesting thoughts, and I may be incorrect in my understanding of the lease. However, if someone is hurt while swimming off a resort's dock/island on the rocks (bellow the high water mark)... the resort's insurance has to cover it. If that was the case, would we be responsible for the safety of guests fishing in the same area? Would we be responsible for the public fishing in the same area? This is by no means a reason I don't care for non-guests fishing in the docks or around the island... it is simply thoughts and uncertainty. Maybe my attitude should change some, and I do try to always be polite to everyone off the lake. However, guests do pay me to provide a service, and part of that is remoteness. Just want to keep guests happy so we can make a living."
3166265,LOW1,2014-09-10 12:08:00,2828,"I did not mean to suggest that people SHOULD crowd your docks and interfere with your swimming guests, etc. To me, common sense suggests that everyone respect each other. There's enough water to use and fish to catch without having to get crowded - that's a luxury that many south of the border don't have and that many north of the border take for granted. The resort insurance plans I have seen have a Medical Payment coverage which will pay for medical care for guests injured on the property (up to a usually small limit) regardless of fault. Otherwise, I would think that your liability would depend upon whether or not you were negligent. But a Canadian lawyer and insurance agent could give you much better info."
3166425,Mike Borger,2014-09-10 13:17:00,1554,"Fishing around private docks here in southern ON has raised the ire of many cottage and camp owners, especially on the popular lakes where bass tournaments are held. In a couple of notable cases people have ultimately ended up being charged with impeding someone's legal right to fish. Personally I would never do it myself and I can fully understand someone losing their mind when 10 bass boats in a row cruise in to flip their dock when they're out their sunbathing or swimming.This is an educated guess, but it's highly unlikely that anyone would have exclusive water rights on any navigable waterway in Ontario. Different story altogether if someone ties off on the dock or gets out on it to fish. Otherwise I believe you could be very much in the wrong chasing people away."
