The spawn can really affect the fishing at this time but if you are there at the right time you can hammer the walleye all over the place! Also the Lakers are shallow early with the cold water and you have a good chance of catching one. Summer is typically slower late June-August but I have always had success with Northerns far as numbers go for most of the year. I picked up one of those baitballs from live target and the pike go nuts for that thing. I stay at Kingfisher with Jerry and Linda nice cabins, Lester and Walleye Jon the dockhands are a great guys to talk to about the lake. Every Wednesday Lester gets out the guitar and/or accordion for some good times around the fire. To sum it up I just love being on that lake any time of year. I'm a walleye guy so I enjoy the spring if I had to choose one."
3141097,Big Mike,2014-09-01 10:35:00,35,"Just returned from my last trip to canada for 2014. The week prior to our trip was very stable and calm weather. Reports had walleyes still scattered but starting to set up on off shore reefs. We were greeted sat and sun with clouds and rainy conditions. Ideal for pike we casted the weeds and had little success. Wondering what was wrong I noticed we still had 70 degree plus water temps, not what we needed for good pike bite. Luckily the weather changed drastically on Monday with strong winds and rain which really set up a fantastic pike bite on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday. The water temps dropped to mid 60s and the pike were back in the weeds and on a tear. Jerk baits and large plastics put well over 2 dozen pike over 34 inches over the side of the ranger in those 3 days, with the biggest topping out at 42.5 inches. Man I wish I was up there for another week! Walleyes magically appeared on the deep reefs after the weather change and the jigs and Linda guys just killed them at 21 to 28 feet. Mornings were best but an all day bite was had by the die hard walleye guys in camp. I was lucky enough to net my buddies pig 29 inch walleye in the evening in the weeds but 95percent of the eyes have moved out to rocks. The bite will only continue to get better for the walleye guys and once again I've got to figure out a way to squeeze in another trip during this time frame next year! Good luck to all who can make it up this fall and congrats to all who made the trip this summer, hope it works for next year! Take care, Big Mike."

3142329,billy weaver,2014-09-01 20:56:00,470,"I have been going to Wabaskang every year for 26 years. I usually only go for one week sometimes two and have fished in August a couple of times but have settled on the fifth week of the walleye season, the middle of June. I stay at Peffleys on the north end of the lake. I enjoy your reports and wonder if you have ever fished a hump in the middle of what they call Mean Lake. It is the open water before you get to the portage going to Wine Lake. I see boats from other camps fishing it so it is known. It has a reputation for big fish. Keep your reports coming."
3144825,Big Mike,2014-09-02 16:04:00,35,I have been going to Jim and Julie's camp since they bought it. I went to John and Diosa all of their years also and even got one year with Jim and Gert back in the mid 80s. There are other quality resorts on the lake as well and I wouldn't hesitate to stay at any of them. My brother Jim taught me most of what I know as he took me along since I was 9 years old. He still thinks he knows more than me though even though he only gets to hear about the fishing from me when I get back to camp! There are numerous big fish spots n Wabaskang and that hump in Mean lake is one of my favs! I love to troll the lake as that is how I have found many of the reefs and humps that I put on my milk run for big fish. Dang all this talk about fishing has me wired to get back up there!
3146905,AB,2014-09-03 08:25:00,61,Always enjoy your posts Big Mike and enjoy your sibling rivalry as I am the Big little brother also. Nice pics of you and your son on FB.
3161857,whip2,2014-09-08 19:18:00,35,"Mike I was up there last week with my brother & his wife (Craig & Kady). I thought we did pretty good but Craig said it was real slow compared to previous trips. We caught many Walleyes but the largest C & R Northern in the boat was 34"". There were larger ones that got off just shy of the net though. We caught the majority of our nicer Walleyes on what Craig called ""Mikes"", which is a hump out on Big Lake. This was my first time there and I had a great time. I even went & picked Blue Berries with Craig, Kady, Diane, Terry & Julie. Julie even made us a Blueberry Pie which we enjoyed greatly along with some ice cream. Craig told me you were a legend up there & I believe I saw a few pictures of you on the board in the Lodge. Jim & Julie are very nice folks & run a nice place. Steve Mericle"
3163073,billy weaver,2014-09-09 08:49:00,470,"I know that weather, high water, bugs and other factors make the choice of a week a crap shoot. But if you was to pick one week to fish Wabaskang next year what week would it be?"
3165041,Big Mike,2014-09-09 21:32:00,35,"Glad to hear you had a great trip. Craig is a good stick up there too and he has the spinner rig fishing down to a science! He's the man you want to ride with for the eyes, and Kady lets him catch a few now and then, too!"
3165057,Big Mike,2014-09-09 21:51:00,35,"Billy, a lot depends on what your fav fish is to pursue and also how you like to catch them. I luv the early June trip because wall eyes are super shallow and fun to catch pitching light jigs. Pike is usually good too if you are willing to downsize the baits and fish slow. Downfall can be cold, rain, and shorter days than summer. Early July is usually awesome for big wall eyes in the weeds but mayflies are usually a problem so the smaller eaters can be tough to catch. Pike are usually active and easy to find shallow in the new weeds. Late July and early August finds me working weed edges and reefs for walleyes and open water for pike. This week is usually the toughest for numbers of both but a lot of big fish are the reward. Finally, the end of August brings a lot of deep jig and minnow fishing for walleyes and throwing super big lures for pike in the weeds. So....my favorite week is very hard to choose because I have a lot of fun using different techniques but if I had to choose it would be early June or late August/first week of September. The summer months are great too but can be more challenging....hope this helps!"
3167577,cough6609,2014-09-10 22:25:00,48,"I've fished Wabaskang early June through late August and the previous post is correct in asking the kind of fishing presentation and conditions you want to fish in. June can be a shallow bite and follows the weed line out as the water warms. Casting that shallow weed line can be a blast with Pike and 'Eyes duke ing it out for the right to hit your jig or crank. Smallies are also defending their beds viciously...just make sure to release them back quickly to get them back on those beds. It's also the best time to find those jumbo perch if you really want to fill your freezer. July's weather is the most stable with shorts and t-shirts the common boat wear (though the coldest 4th of July I've ever experienced occurred 12 years ago with a high of 48). The pike heat up, the eaters 'eyes are abundant along the 12'-15' weed lines and bigger 'eyes off the windswept points. August gets tricky as you can find the 'eyes hot on the deep humps one day and next day the weed line produces...mobility is the key. Decent Pike can be had in the 8'-12' weed flats casting big baits, but the trophy's are hanging off those deep humps with the big 'eyes. Best bet for big Smalls are the reed beds early am and late pm pitching cranks, soft bodies and gulp crawlers. Slip bobbers can work the humps great in the day and even better in the evenings in narrows. The perch get a little obnoxious fishing the weed lines using any live bait and you wonder how a 6"" perch can possibly swallow a 3"" minnow. Every month will bring you different challenges and ALWAYS some type of curve ball will come your way. Best advice I have is...fish as many times as you can in as many months as possible because it's a long break between October until May!"
