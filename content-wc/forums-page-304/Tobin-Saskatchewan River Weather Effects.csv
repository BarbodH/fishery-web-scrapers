About 8 years back we switched to mid October and definitely caught bigger fish and sometimes lots of them. However, about the last 5 years our timing has been awfull and we haven't caught very many fish period. The weather has been just lousy with snow and cold temps and wind.. I'm just curious what kind of success and weather conditions others have had in October the last several years? My experience has been if it's not nice outside, the fish don't seem to bite our baits..Thoughts on that?? I fish the Missiouri river and the weather has almost no effect on the fish in the river. Switching back to Sept this year and the weather certainly looks promising for the near future!!!"
