Bottom line is it's quite remarkable to have a process to get anything back. Whether the owner opts for the instant rebate or the application rebate is their business decision. If you want to base your resort selection on that aspect then you will choose your next vacation from a much smaller list of candidates."
3162577,tv4fish,2014-09-09 06:28:00,2694,"Too funny Gord -- his post kind of reminds of that thing about complaining about a ""new rope"" and a hanging. Geez - my opinion is that applying for and receiving ANY kind of a rebate is worth the small amount of effort that it takes."
3164793,phishfearme,2014-09-09 19:32:00,1242,"I guess you didn't care to note that I intentionally embellished this list - but let me add some other real world examples: - your $500 rebate request is rejected because the receipt is not clear enough to the ministry even though the outfitter said it would be - you try to re-apply but only an original receipt is acceptable and of course it was sent to the ministry and never to be seen again - you ask the outfitter for a clearer one and he complies - you resend this in and AGAIN it is not detailed enough for the ministry - you tell the outfitter again and he says he can't do anything else - you give up or one more: - you send in the form with original receipt - you never hear anything again I guess that if you don't care about this significant chunk of money then more power to you. we do!! and I will at least request that the outfitter apply the rebate at the time of payment to avoid this form-filing gambit - and he better be at least willing to consider it or we may/will go elsewhere - the list of outfitters is quite large and what I've seen over the last few years, none are all that financially healthy and they all want the business - especially the fly-in operators as the cost of flying is going - excuse the pun - sky high. and - I would encourage all qualified clients to ask their outfitters about the instant rebate - there's power in numbers. phish"
3164857,port1042,2014-09-09 19:51:00,509,"I'm with Gord on this. It's just not that big a deal. I sent in my request today for my trip last week. It took me about 15 minutes including the time to print the form, scan a copy of my invoice (so I would have a copy), find an envelope at home, stop at the Post Office to get an international stamp ($1.15) and mail the form. This wasn't for a lot of money. My rebate request is for about $78.00 on a $156.00 tax amount. If it's anything like the last 4 times I've done this, in about 4 to 6 weeks I'll get a rebate check and my original invoice back in the mail. My bank will dun me about $12.00 to handle the check and I'll have about $66.00 towards next years trip. That will buy a weeks worth of minnows! No one else is sending me tax rebates so I'm not complaining. As far as my camp owner is concerned -- they give me a qualifying invoice. I don't see any need to ask for more from them."
3164961,v-bay gord,2014-09-09 20:46:00,3168,"Apparently not all of us are ""not that financially healthy and want your business"", because I've learnt long ago that it's not worth the extra stress to deal with ""difficult"" clients....there are plenty, the majority in fact, that are dream guests who only ask in return for a fair cost, a quality vacation that is memorable and enjoyable. If you wish to be anal about the tax rebate that is your loss, and definitely not mine!"
3164977,JayM5209,2014-09-09 20:55:00,1050,"I'm definitely with port1042 on this. (Guess that makes me with Gord, too!) Every time I've applied for the rebate the check has come in the mail in five or six weeks. The form is right there on the web to print out, complete, and mail in. The bank deposits the check in my account and sends me a letter ten days later telling what the exchange rate adjustment was. What's it take, all of ten minutes and sufficient postage?Geez, maybe we should all start telling the outfitters we use that they need to throw in two days of a guide at no charge or we'll go elsewhere. Or tell them they need to deduct $100 from the final tab for the group 'cause the boat seats had dew on them one morning? I know . . . . I'm being facetious. But Lordy, Lordy, Lordy!! In my 50 +/- trips to NW Ontario, with one exception, the quality of the experience, the level of service and hospitality, the welcomes I've experienced are so much more valuable than the costs that I would hesitate to ask the outfitter to give me anything or do anything additional other than fix a boat/motor problem, give me some tips on how and where the walleyes have been behaving, or see if he can get the water heater in the cabin re-lit. JMHO . . . . . but then, after tipping any dock staff, I also tip the owner/outfitter. It's still an incredible bargain."

3187201,revitup,2014-09-18 18:54:00,140,"Our taxes totaled $546 American funds. Submitted a request for a $273 refund. About 5 weeks after submission, received a check from Canadian government for $296.21 and a statement stating the difference was for conversion into Canadian funds. Deposited in my bank, which then took out $32.61 for conversion and fees. So my request for $273 resulted in getting $263.60. In my opinion not bad for 15 minutes at a computer and an international stamp."
3011897,Guest,2014-07-19 14:06:00,0,"You are correct PFM! In order to apply for the rebate. You need to have purchased Sort Term Accommodation and a least one service. Any Service of some kind. ""Fillet Service"" is fine in the eyes of Revenue Canada. Ours is Flying service / Airfare. Now to get the refund. When you send in the Rebate form, you must send in your original invoice / bill showing its paid in full AND it needs to needs properly formatted reflecting you have paid for short term accommodation and a least one service. It must be stated on the bill or RC will deny your refund. They are very sticky on this point. I called RC to get the right info to make sure your clients receive a correctly formatted bill for their refund. As mentioned in an earlier post, our bills state the HST in Canadian dollars. Take 50% of that amount, write it on the form and thats is what our clients get back, 4-6 weeks later of course. No guessing, no Revenue Canada exchange rates. You get back what you apply for Years ago, outfitters were able to apply the 50% rebate at source, ie on your final bill for the GST only. Then the government took away that program and replace it with the latest Foreign Convention and Tour Incentive Program. Basically,rebate of the (GST/HST) you paid on an eligible tour package, or on short-term and/or camping accommodation that you purchased and resold as part of an eligible tour package. I'm guessing the government change to this current program because they thought perhaps, alot of people would not even apply, or screw up their application and just plain gives up; Therefore, RC keeps your hard earned cash. This year the government has again began to allow the out fitters to apply the refund at source to you when you pay your final bill, the only trick to this is you must pay a deposit of 20 or 25% or something of the total cost of your trip pre tax before you arrive for you trip. I'm not sure of the correct percentage. As an outfitter, we have decided to keep an arms length away from this process. Sure it would be nice to pay less right away. I would like to do this with my income taxes. There is just to much room to screw up and get in hot water with RC for making any mistake. When RC audits, they love looking for mistakes and collecting interest and arrears. Happened to us and others we know. Not a fun process If there are overdue taxes needing to be paid to RC, who pays? We do! And good luck trying to try to retrieve outstanding taxes from the clients. They are gone. So yes, filling out a rebate form is slight pain, much less than a triple hook getting caught in the back of the ear or waiting at the DMV. But in the end, our clients get their refund."

3014401,phishfearme,2014-07-20 12:51:00,1242,here's from the rebate form: An eligible tour package is a tour package that is sold for an all-inclusive price and includes:  short-term and/or camping accommodation in Canada; and  at least one service. from this I would assume that if the package you bought included a guide along with the lodging then you should be eligible for the rebate. if you bought the guide service outside of your package then it's less clear - I thing it would depend very much on how your receipt is written. most outfitters worth their salt would ensure that their receipt is properly written to that it will work for this rebate - as long as the package they offer qualifies. phish

3161305,polaris-pete,2014-09-08 15:21:00,343,"Here in NY when you pay the NYS Sales tax on anything, you don't get a cent back from them! Its an easy process to get your 50% back. Fill out the Form with your original receipt, send it in and in about 3 months you have your money back in Canadian funds. I have tried to cash mine at the local bank and the fees and exchange were ridiculous so now the Outfitter I am going with the next year takes it at full value and puts it on towards our deposit."
3161889,phishfearme,2014-09-08 19:30:00,1242,"Pete - each taxing body can attempt to drive business if they wish by offering rebates - Ontario does and NY doesn't. but let's review your ""it's an easy process"" statement: step 1 - you need to get the form from somewhere step 2 - fill it out step 3 - make sure your original receipt contains the needed info - is it in US or Canadian funds? step 4 - mail it with the correct postage from the US to Canada to the correct address step 5 - wait 3 months step 6 - try to deposit (or cash) your check which is in Canadian funds into a US back step 7 - pay whatever fee the bank charges (mine wants $35US) step 8 - pay the exchange rate fee - around 3% or so step 9 - get your less than 50% rebate back I embellished this a bit but this process is by no means easy. what you do with your check - send it to you next year's outfitter as a deposit - is exactly what we do (what would happen if it gets lost in the mail???) which is the best option IF YOU HAVE TO GET A CHECK IN THE FIRST PLACE - but the best option is for the outfitter to deduct the rebate DIRECTLY from the bill in the first place. as far as I can tell, you need to send in a deposit of at least 20% to qualify for this instant rebate. if anyone knows of additional requirements, please let me know. phish"
3162289,revitup,2014-09-08 22:06:00,140,I received my rebate approximately 5-6 weks after sending it in. I was also pleased that the Canadian Government increased the dollar amount to reflect a change in the currency. We paid $546 in American funds. 50% is $273 which is what I put down on the form to get back. I received approximately $291 with an explanation that the difference received was due to the exchange rate. I couldn't have been happier!

3010145,port1042,2014-07-18 15:33:00,509,There is another option. Don't rebate anything. Many of the collections of the 13% do not qualify for the rebate and it's unlikely that it would keep too many of us from going. I'm going to quietly keep applying for the rebate and be glad I get the check regardless of the currency it's drawn on.
3010273,JayM5209,2014-07-18 16:23:00,1050,"x2!! I'm not an outfitter, just a guy from the U.S. that won't miss my several trips to NW Ontario every summer. I pay the full HST when settling my bill at the end of the week and fill out and submit my claim for the 50% rebate when I get home. We go 'round and 'round this discussion regularly on WC and I just don't get it. If the package I paid for qualifies for the rebate, I get it. If it doesn't, I don't. Why should the outfitters be responsible for doing the accounting and paperwork and problem solving related to my requesting a possible tax rebate?? And, given the dollars, time, energy, and fretting I put into boats, tackle, etc., to get ready for a trip north, the last thing I'm going to invest time and energy in is frettin' about what currency I pay my HST with and what currency the rebate is in. Life's waaaaaay too short.As usual . . . just my $0.02 worth. Time to take a Shiner's Bock out to the patio and ponder where I need to go for a September trip."
3011073,Muskie Bob,2014-07-19 05:48:00,45,"The resort or outfitter should know whether your trip will qualify for 50% refund of the HST. They should be able to provide the proper ""paid bill"" that qualifies you for the refund. When you get your ""paid bill"", ask them if it qualifies you for the refund. Then, if you don't get the refund, contact the resort or outfitter and ask them to provide a ""paid bill"" that will qualify for the refund. It really shouldn't be that hard."
3011161,DavKin,2014-07-19 06:46:00,104,"Our outfitter will rebate 50% of the HST when we pay our bill. However, he needs 20% payment a month in advance of our trip."
3011313,JayM5209,2014-07-19 08:13:00,1050,"Bob, I get your point, but I beg to differ a bit. If you file for the rebate you must provide a receipt showing what you paid. However, the receipt is not what qualifies you for the rebate. What does qualify is the services you paid for, and the receipt is documentation of those services. It is not the responsibility of the outfitter to provide a receipt that qualifies you for a rebate . . . . it is their responsibility to give you a receipt that accurately reflects the services you purchased. Those are two different things.I mention this because I have personally seen receipts that successfully supported a rebate request but did not accurately reflect the services actually provided. 'Nuff said."

I asked about a refund/rebate and I thought he said they haven't done that for the past 4 or 5 years unless I misunderstood. (Gov't quit offering it) I assume it doesn't matter where you stay, if some of you are saying you get 50% back, I would again assume I would also qualify. Is there a website I can go to apply or see if I qualify? On my receipt, it just says HST tax - $$$."

I assume the outfitter has to return the HST to the government but does (or can) he do this in US dollars? maybe some of the outfitters on this board can shed some light. thanks, phish"
3005170,GNO,2014-07-17 07:43:00,153,As an outfitter you have to file in Canadian dollars and remit the amount owed. We do not have to send it in and get a refund.
3005402,Fisherman Ted,2014-07-17 08:33:00,461,In this case the Canadian government is making out. What I would do is when filling out the form I would adjust the amount paid to Canadian dollars so they are refunding the marked up amount.
3006570,Guest,2014-07-17 14:38:00,0,"Yes! Sounds like the government is making out the difference. As an out fitter, we submit the HST monthly to Revenue Canada (our IRS). We submit to RC the HST we have collected from our clients in Canadian Dollars. The Government will not except any other currency from us. It is the clients responsibility to send in the form to receive the rebate. The Rebate is 50% of the HST paid in Canadian Dollars. You will receive your rebate in Canadian dollars. We do not collect any refund To make it easier for our clients, our final bill is printed in Canadian dollars, showing the HST paid in Canadian Dollars. The same bill that is sent in with the rebate form. Then any commission or fees collected after receiving the rebate is collected at the bank when the check is cashed. Any bank always make some commission either buying or selling the Canadian dollars. Cant get away from that, unless you cash your check at a Canadian Bank. Then you are stuck if Canadian dollars, which you could use on your next trip. I hope that helps."

3008010,phishfearme,2014-07-18 05:48:00,1242,"ok - thanks for the info everyone - I kinda thought that the gov would be making out here - I would've rather seen it be the outfitter. for my most recent situation, the outfitter provided a receipt for me to send in for the HST rebate but the receipt did not specify that we paid in US dollars - so, I assume he converted our US dollar HST payment into Canadian dollars then sent that amount to RC. we then sent in the rebate form claiming a dollar amount and the government would naturally assume the amount we're requesting is in Canadian dollars. I need to point this out to the outfitter. Freytown's comment is quite interesting though - what if the Canadian dollar is higher than the US dollar?? this has been only a very infrequent situation but has occurred. the REAL solution is to reduce our HST amount to be paid right at the transaction and NOT have to go thru this rebate form. some outfitters do and some don't. I've said on this board many times that we should insist that this be the case. I insisted with my most recent outfitter and got no where. and for pooch - cashing the check in Canada is a good option - or sending the check to your outfitter for next year's trip to be applied to the deposit is an even better one. we try to avoid EVER having cash around - US or Canadian - almost EVERYONE for EVERYTHING takes credit cards - especially in Canada. thanks again, phish"

If the outfitter does the discount immediately and for whatever reason the credit is not awarded then they take the hit. Easier to do the rebate later and if all goes smoothly the fishermen get a nice present in the fall.Bottom line is that there is a currency exchange rate risk no matter how it is done. If it goes wildly up or wildly down during the rebate process someone is going to take a hit. The real (or ideal) solution is to allow the operator to discount immediately at the point of sale (or not even charge the full HST) and then this all goes away. But that would assume CRA (IRS) will always give the rebate, something probably not always guaranteed.Similar issue. As an operator I don't have to pay HST at all on nearly all my goods and services but I am always charged it on everything I buy all summer. At the end of the quarter I have to fill out a form to get it all back. Boy, would it be easier if I didn't have to deal with HST at all.........."
