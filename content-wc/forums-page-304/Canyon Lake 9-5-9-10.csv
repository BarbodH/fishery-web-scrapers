Arrived early on Friday morning (9/5) after a stop at the Middle of Nowhere coffee shop in V Bay where we got yet another lesson on how to handle the French Press- good coffee though. We met John, the owner of McIntosh Lodge and discussed our options. Since we were eager to tangle with muskies (both Doc and I were miuskie virgins) we decided to go to the muskie only lake which would almost guarantee us a muskie. Doc hooked the first one but I didn't have the net handle extended or ready and he lost it before we got it in. I hooked the next one and somehow Doc acted like it was his first time netting a fish and pulled the lure out of its mouth, leaving it hanging on the net as the fish darted away. Finally, Doc caught two muskies around 30"", but we left the lake with my virginity intact. That afternoon we went out on Canyon to investigate a few walleye spots John had marked for us. On literally the first drop of the line I felt a light walleye bite but it immediately got heavy. As I got it closer we could see in the clear water a small walleye t-boned in the mouth of a large muskie, probably 40-45, but I am claiming 55-60"". He would not let go and we got it almost close enough to try to net but he broke the 12 lb. test line. We fished along that bank and I caught what turned out to be the largest walleye of the trip at 20"" We let it go thinking that the walleye would be productive. We went back to camp with only the story of the 55"" muskie that t-boned the walleye. The next day we tried that shoreline again, along with some non productive spots that John suggested and managed to get a few bites, but nothing to take home. We ventured to the narrows and took a couple smallies for dinner. A little fishy but still pretty good with beer batter breading. We went through the tube (a railroad bridge tunnel) and Doc caught another muskie about 32"" on a bucktail. He pulled it out of the weeds casting. On Sunday we decided to arm ourselves with some crawlers and managed to get a few walleye eaters. When the wind picked up we decided to troll a little and I put on a perch x-rap with a longer bill and managed to get my first muskie. It was another 31-incher. After another trip through the tube we fished for whitefish as John suggested. It was calm and we were able to stay over the school and caught one. John told us he pulls the fergie lure until he pisses them off. We were able to piss off one, but then they pissed us off as we could not get another one. We had to have three for him to smoke them but he eventually traded us that one for a smoked one. Monday we revisited places that we had been and caught a lot of walleye at the original bay, but it was difficult to find an eater as most were under 14"". Also the perch got involved. Doc caught one that barfed up 3 crawlers but at least it was action. Smallie action was slow and we went back through the tube again. My perch x-rap produced the largest muskie for us at 38"". You can see the picture on the McIntosh Lodge website since I don't know how to post pictures here. We finished up on Tuesday spending most of the day at the original bay and managed to get 5 keepers to take home. Through the tube we did a lot more casting and had some curious musky, one pretty large, check out our baits but no takers. The lodge is well kept but the boats are not cleaned. The motor ran well and we did not have any problems with it. On Monday and Tuesday the wind was from the northwest and it was a rough ride in the larger and wider portions of the lake. Particularly where outlet bay joins the main lake the north wind through the bay and the west wind down the main lake led to a few terrifying moments until Doc mastered how to cross the area. The railroad tracks and number of lodges and homes on the lake will never make Canyon Lake a remote location and the fishing pressure is likely much more prevalent than what we are used to but we had a lot of fun on this trip. we are thinking this might be a good ""first time"" Canada experience for our grandkids. I did upload a few pictures from the trip in an album on my profile, feel free to take a look"
