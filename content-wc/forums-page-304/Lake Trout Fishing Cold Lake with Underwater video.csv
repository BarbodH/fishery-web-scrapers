Stopped filming after these since we were just catching too many.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbXpa0uo5jc This is a great lake trout fishery and it is not that far away. So pack up your boat / downriggers to go check it out for yourself if you haven't yet. It is a beautiful lake with frequent aerial shows as fighter jets fly in formation over the lake in and out of the air weapons range. We had four jets flying in tight formation over us, pretty cool stuff. Bait really isn't needed as these fish are very willing to hit a lure. Trolling speed should be varied from 1.5 mph to 3 mph for best results. Second, my first Cold Lake Underwater Trolling Video. This is the Luhr Jensen Test, didn't even do it on purpose, just realized when I was editing that I had tried three different lures they make. #1 J Plug #2 Coyote Spoon #3 Manistee Spoon. They would come charging in really fast and then something was wrong, cause they'd swerve last second. I think the camera and ball three feet away were spooking them. Check it out, kind of interesting.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YocfnKWhnA"
3177233,MrSimon,2014-09-15 07:30:00,922,"Nice videos, thanks for posting. Beautiful fish!!!! Why the heck don't those little kids have life vests on?"
3178153,fireboat,2014-09-15 12:24:00,752,"First thing I noticed, NO life vest on the kids."
3179433,Brandonkop,2014-09-15 19:57:00,124,"They don't have life jackets on because this is in Canada and there is no law stating that children have to wear a life vest, so just personal choice. We get to decide when we think they need one and when they are probably fine without it. They do wear them most of the time, but when we're just fishing with three adults on board (my wife and mom in the boat as well who are not fishing, there is plenty of supervision). I understand you think it is foolish and not responsible. You are right kids around water should be wearing life jackets."
3179953,MrSimon,2014-09-16 06:21:00,922,"I'm all for personal choice. And based on your circumstances I agree those kids were in very little danger, if any. Personally though, I've seen overboard incidents happen so fast that even an aware adult wouldn't be able to respond quickly enough .... so my kids always wear them. Honestly, I'm not ever sure what the actual laws are here in Pennsylvania. I suppose I should look those up."
3180969,NMG,2014-09-16 12:49:00,1053,The law in Canada is that you have to have a life jacket onboard for every passenger. You don't have to wear them. My little guy always does. I've read too many stories about people drowning while life jackets sat unused in the boat to conclude that they are of no use if they aren't on.
