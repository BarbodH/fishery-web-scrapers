3184442,lassh,2014-09-17 15:03:00,553,Amazing report and pics. Great job! And the fishing was crazy. You are so blessed to have been able to share that fishing and that serene scene violently interrupted every 10 minutes by slime bomb explosions with your son. I sure would like to try that someday.
