3152569,Redlabel,2014-09-04 17:05:00,279,I fish this area the first week of the season. Thinking of going back in September /Octorber what FOW would the walleye be in and is the muskie bite good here? Thanks for any info John
3152865,BreezyPoint,2014-09-04 18:30:00,1581,"I fished that area once on a one day trip in late September for muskies. Saw them everywhere; caught one. We found them shallow that day in decaying weed beds. There was no wind an it was a long, but easy trip from Morson. Of course, one day doesn't make a solid pattern.Each trip, when I go up to Morson, I take a long boat ride, just to see and familiarize myself with more of the lake. I thought that are had a lot of promise.FYI, Mike, at Red Wing Lodge, has compiled historical data on more than 12,000 catches. One of his charts, which he doesn't post, shows the average size by month. The average size increases every month of the year from June through October. The difference in size during this period increases from 37 to 42 inches. That's a big jump and fall is truly trophy time on Lake of the Woods. If you can take the weather, I'm sure the muskie bite will be good.If you are in that area, you might want to try Deepwater Bay. Our club fished this several times when we stayed at the Northwest Angle. It has been hit or miss, but when they were in there, there were a lot of fish. Just watch the weather.Frank"

3154249,Redlabel,2014-09-05 10:33:00,279,"Thank you Breezypoint for the muskie info, were you fishing Deepwater Bay for walleye?Walleye 990, are you going after walleye of Muskie?Would the eyes be in 20-30 ft or deeper?Thanks John"
3154433,BreezyPoint,2014-09-05 11:31:00,1581,"It was muskies we fished in Deepwater. It was definitely hit or miss, but when on there were numerous follows, and some really big fish. It was best when the wind was blowing in. With a brisk south wind it could get nasty, so be careful. Unfortunately, I never caught one there, but other guys did. Maybe next year I will get back up there to try it again for my big boat ride.Frank"

3179425,muskybones,2014-09-15 19:56:00,24,"What depth seemed to be the best with your crawler rig? Single hook, double hook rig? What was your water temps? I am heading up there Saturday and can't wait!!!!!!Thanks,Bones"
3179497,Walleye990,2014-09-15 20:05:00,8,"20' to 25' seemed to be key, we worked the reefs from the outside in. We used 2 hook harnesses and I made up a few 3 hook harnesses. Hammered brass was the big winner for us. Water temp was 63 degrees. Good luck and let me know how it went"
3179713,muskybones,2014-09-15 21:59:00,24,Excellent. Thank you for the information. Now back to packing for the trip.Bones
