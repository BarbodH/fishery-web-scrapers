It's perfect for people like us that like to use our own boat and prefer flexible arrival/departure days. Doug is always helpful with the bite and his minnows are high quality and affordable. I have to thank the guys on this site a few years ago for recommending them to us. We fished from Steamboat to Manitoba point throughout the 3 days and had really good numbers and average size in all areas. We caught fish from 8-35' but the majority came in 25' range on a 1/4 or 3/8 jig and minnow. When the wind quit bouncer/spinner rigs with crawlers or minnows outproduced jigs slightly...but most of the time we had at least a decent chop and jigs outproduced everything else. We did not boat anything over 25"" but there were a ton of 20-25"" fish caught. We did not target pike but they seem to have their feed bags on also as we caught quite a few 25-30"" and came very close to landing a solid pike around 35"" that attacked an 18"" walleye boat side...which is always fun. Can't wait to get back next year."

Very well written, I am surprised you are not a registered WC guy we would love to have you as a regular walleye freak like the rest of us.... lol And yes I have stayed at several lodges in Canada and have stayed at no better camp!!"
