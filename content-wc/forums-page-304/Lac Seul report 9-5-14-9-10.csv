3168625,SinOrSwim,2014-09-11 09:21:00,1528,"Trip report:Went up Thursday as far as Virginia. Stayed at Americinn, train side. LOL Actually I only heard one. Had dinner/drinks at Sawmill. Some lady stopped me and asked about my Iowa Hawkeye shirt. She then said, I look familiar and proceeded to know exactly where I went to high school. 25 year, 80llbs, bald and now a goatee and she recognized me as dating one of her friends in high school. WOW. Left Friday am to cross border. We have been doing this trip for over 20 years. We take 2 to 3 vehicles depending on size of group along with a trailer filled with supplies and gear. All the beer and booze is always in one spot for easy inspection. Well, Mr Border Man decided the rules changed. Unless the alcohol was in your specific vehicle you could not count it toward your free allotment????? So, 5 of us in other trucks didn't get the liter of booze or case of beer duty free. I wasn't in the lead truck but MorganMan was. Suffice it to say he is sick and tired of getting verbally abused by basically being told we are morons because we don't know the rules. It seems to happen when we have a larger group, thus A LOT of extra beer and alcohol. We have been told once we needed a liquor license???? We didn't have that much but when you have 10 to 12 guys and it's all in one spot, it seems like a lot. Arrived at Onaway Friday afternoon. Got out fishing about 4 or 4:30. We all sort of went ot different areas. MorganMan literally had a 26inch walleye on the line within minutes of being there and even before his son in the front of the boat had a line in the water. That was a good sign for this trip. We didn't have any true HOGS but biggest of group was 27 then 26 ¾ and a 26. With another 26, several 25's (one by MorganMans 16 year old son on his first trip) and I'm not sure how many 24's? I had two 24's and a 24.5 and I know others had several as well. The number of fish between 20 and 23 was a lot! They were fat and healthy too!!!!! Weather was cold. We had one day it was in the 70's but it was crazy windy that day! Easily the roughest water I have navigated. We did manage to get to Manitoba point but could not fish the south side of anything. Way too rough. I tried very briefly and the one time we got turned sideways, we were in the bottom of the trough and I couldn't see out. It was time to head back to the protected side. Fishing was still good. But, I wasn't going to risk capsizing. We did explore the south inlet one morning. Saw the waterfalls. Meh. Okay, but I was expecting something a little more spectacular I guess. But, a neat area all the way down there. We fished it back up toward the narrows along with the little unnamed lake to the west side. Not much luck for anyone. A coupld 16 to 18 inchers and some perch but that was about it. That was Sunday. We decided with the slow fishing to have a sandwich for shore lunch and head back in. We went to Ear Falls to find football. That was quite the adventure. LOL Stopped at a gas station to ask where to watch game. Guy says try hotel 105 or you could come to my house if you want. Hahaha.. So, we tried 105. Sent my Dad in. They said no tv and bars are closed on Sundays. Try Trillium. It was closed. Stopped at another gas station they said Legion then a customer said no it was closed. The customer said unless you can find a private residence you probably won't have any luck. LOL that cracks me up. Stopped at the bait shop. Guy, who was watching it on his laptop said go back and try the 105. We did. Apparently the first girl we asked was new. The other girl who is daughter of the owner, Brooke, Said no we have a TV. It's back here I'll turn it on for you. It's a S H I T T Y picture but it will work. LOL I then said so bars are closed Sundays so no beer right. She said well the bar is closed but the restaurant is open and we serve beer. So, we were able to watch the last part of the 3rd qtr and all of the 4th quarter with some Kokanees. Vikings played well too! Went back out fishing and did okay. Tuesday was COLD and sort of windy. Stayed in Bay of Islands because we dind't want to deal with the wind/wave and get wet. It was a high in the low 50's. Fished Bay of Islands for about 2 hours and Bill (in my boat) has a fish on. I said any size, you need a net? He said if you drive 30 mph it might feel bigger. So, I'm watching and I said you sure you don't need a net. It gets closer and he says well maybe. But, probably a northern. I get up and get ready to net. I see it surface and yelled ..DUDE .and started laughing. Scooped up a 27 walleye. Very nice fish. We went back in for shore lunch later since we didn't want to cook in the wind. Then, back out for awhile. In a couple hours we had a 24, 25, 26.75 and several others. Onaway Lodge is probably one of the nicest facilities there is up there. Cabins are new, well kept, fish house is perfect etc. There is some disagreement in our group on whether we are fond of the owners. Some are some are not. A couple examples. One guy walked into fish house in AM with minnow buckets. She was handing 2 buckets to a guy in another group. She asked, how do these look for you, they were hand-picked. So, our guy says can we get some larger minnows. She flatly stated I'll get you minnows but I won't hand pick any. Tossed a couple scoops in each bucket and that was it. Last year I got word my 4 year old was in the hospital. I was trying to find out the chances of getting flown out sooner. I asked the owners about this. I was told .well I don't know. You can call the airports in Dryden or Ft Frances. That is probably your best bet. Then they went about what they were doing. So, I traveled up to the highway where I could get a signal after using the wifi to google a phone number. Called Dryden and they were nice enough to get me the number to Ft Frances airport. Turned out it wasn't going to get me back in time to make any difference so I went home with the group. But, for me I think that is where an owner could step up and help a guest out. I wasn't asking anything outlandish. Now, a few of the other guys in our group think they are great. So, maybe I just had a bad experience and caught them at a bad time? I just think if we are going to post reports, it should be an honest report. We will go back in a heart beat. Like I said, you can't beat that facility. It is top shelf.All in all, it was a fantastic trip. The fishing was probably as a group, our best ever. We are finally starting to learn the area of the lake we are on to be able to change targets when one area isn't working. The food was phenomenal. Night one: burgers and fresh walleyeTwo: fish and fried potatoesThree: Cajun seafood pasta topped with blackend or fried walleye (your choice) and garlic bread. Also, cheesecake with chocolate crust topped with raspberry sauce. Plus fresh walleyeFour: Walleye/Seafood Chimichangas topped with white cheese sauce with Spanish rice and chips. Plus fresh walleyeFive: We roasted a whole ribeye roast. Sliced and served with a horseradish mushroom cream sauce along with asparagus and garlic mash. Plus, fresh walleyeBreakfasts were all on the go. MorganMan pre-made breakfast burritos along with sausage,egg and cheese bagels. All individually wrapped. Grab, toss in microwave and go. Lunch: Baja walleye tacos, potato salad and beans. Another day walleye wraps with fish, lettuce bacon, tomato and different sauces. The other days were sandwiches. This could have easily been our best trip for food ever. MorganMan and Hawkfan were dialed in. I was hoping for Hamburger helper but was able to deal with what they served!!!! LOL Oh, and the two 16 year olds on their first trip did a magnificent job cooking fish. MorganMan and Hawkfan can add to this. This got long and I know I left a lot out."
3168633,SinOrSwim,2014-09-11 09:24:00,1528,"Some more pics. Am tyring to upload some fish pics and waiting for pics from others in the group. Also, I have some really cool pics of an eagle grabbing a fish. But, for some reason it says those are too large. I'll try to tinker with that later too"
3176177,vaquero01,2014-09-14 17:06:00,101,"We were at Onaway the week before you, I posted some info on a MorganMan post. After seeing your post from this year we booked a second week hoping we will be invited for dinner. Every night. And shore lunch. My wife and I like Cathy and Blair. We talk to them about things other than fishing and camp. And we have a Lab. I love the camp. Hope to see you next year."
3176329,Bill Krejca,2014-09-14 18:23:00,6107,"Re: border - We just account for everything the people in the same vehicle have - beer, tobacco, fish, etc. regardless of any other folks in other vehicles that are going with. It used to be that it was OK to carry other's stuff in one car, but either their rules gradually changed, or the border folks are now just more particular. If they write down your answers, be prepared to empty your vehicle. Bill"
3177601,SinOrSwim,2014-09-15 09:23:00,1528,"Come on down for dinner anytime Vaquero. For the record though we don't eat til late. LOL Which is a point of contention with a few. I think we broke 2 records this year. One night was the earliest we had eaten in years and hte last night ended up being the latest. whoops. The meat takes a couple hours to cook. We do separate our fish now after one year of not. But, we have been going across the border for over 20 years the same exact way. This was the first year they have ever done that. We have the lead vehicle with all the gear go through first letting them know the next 2 vehicles are part of our group. We have done it this way so we make sure we get an accurate count of everything we take across. So, now we have to have a couple random bottles of vodka or case of beer in each vehicle seems nit picky to me. To me it was his way of showing us he was in power. Probably cost us an extra $50 in duty. I have the same issue with rental inspectors etc. Make the rules and I will follow the rules. But, don't change them as you see fit. It comes down to two words.Recommendation or requirement. There IS a difference."
3178065,bigwalleye1,2014-09-15 11:53:00,2632,"Sin, Great report and Awesome food pictures. Is there a ""drool"" icon?? Did I mention that I love to do dishes???"
3178105,Hawkfan,2014-09-15 12:09:00,237,"We did have a good week. This was our 4th year at Lac Seul and it has gotten a little easier each year, having a better idea of spots that produce. Was also nice to take some time and go exploring. I didn't think that south inlet would ever end. I also got a chance to try some presentations I hadn't in the past and even spent a small amount of time casting for northerns. Might have been a little longer one time around the corner from camp if it wasn't for some of the biggest raindrops EVER coming down. I spent more time using jigsthan I ever have in the past . Caught some nice fish on those Sirmanski jigs too (thanks Mike!). I also enjoyed taking a little break after lunch because past years have shown some slow bites early afternoon. Plus it was a nice break for your back. That was one of the rougher trips I remember. There was some big water at times. As far as boat traffic, it was one of the busier years too. And the rough water may have had something to do with that. But there was one day in the bay of islands, I look over and along a ridge or sand flat between a couple if islands, there were 7-8 boats. Wasn't expecting to see that, especially in September. But all in all, a great trip. Good food, good fishing and good times."
3170169,Pikeslayer8,2014-09-11 19:45:00,1460,"Man O Man, great detailed report! Loved the food pics. I just love how your group is so creative with your walleye dishes. Well done! You guys might want to rethink your alcohol distribution when crossing the border. Bet that was some hefty duty. Glad that you guys had a great trip."
3170345,bigtimeelectric,2014-09-11 21:02:00,174,Great report. Did you guys jig with minnows mainly? did you notice the current out in the main lake? We through a marker bouy out on a calm day out in steamboat bay and the current was making a wake on one side of it. I was amazed. Sounds like great fishing. We have never tried to cross border in a large group. We always bring over on the booze as well and it is very smooth. Maybe they don't like Iowa.....LOL oh well however hard it is to cross border it is still worth it!! We had a storm day so we went down and drove through a few camps just out of curiosity and onaway is a very impressive looking camp was very surprised at their dock system wow.
3170465,rather-be-fishin,2014-09-11 22:21:00,429,"SinOrSwim ~ Great report! Glad you had a good trip. When staying in Virginia, another option for lodging is the Holiday Inn Express. It's located just 1 mile west on 169 off of Hwy 53. Still close to AmericInn area, but further away from the train tracks. RBF"
3170721,SinOrSwim,2014-09-12 06:35:00,1528,"Slayer, the food was amazing this year. Always is but there are years we forget a thing or two or it gets forgotten in the cooking process (read too many beers before cooking lol ). But, this year each one was made to perfection and couldn't have turned out better.The thing about the border is we have been doing the same thing for over 20 years. Plus, they have said it was easier for them to inspect if it is in one spot. Then they don't have to search through everywhere to find what we are claiming. We always have a hefty duty. We take way more than we need. A result of flying in for years and running out a time or two in the early years. Will have to ask Morgan but I think he got scolded last year because the tobacco wasn't all in the same spot? We try to make a list and hand it to them so it is simple. I crossed a month ago with a little bit more than my allotment and it was smooth as can be. Maybe it is the size of the group and the quantity? I don't see how that matters though?I didn't notice the current as it was pretty windy most of the time we were there. We used everything. Jig and minnow and pulling bouncers and spinners. Gold spinners seemed to do well. yellow jig with a red eye was the go to jig. But, honestly if they were ""on"" I don't think it mattered. There were times two people in the same boat were using the same thing and one guy would catch 5 to 1? Then, it would switch. Best fishing by far was between 0930 and 1130. Then again around 5 to 7 but the morning bite was amazing. I netted the 27"" which won our big fish contest. Same guy as last year and I netted that one too. He booked me to be his ""guide"" next year after we got the 27"" this year. LOL I asked him about payment and he said he would pay me but he doesn't want me to have to worry about paying taxes so in my best interest he won't. How thoughtfulOnaway has to be one of the nicest camps up there. I can't imagine it being nicer? He has been replacing cabins the last few years so everything is literally brand new. Big commercial appliances in the kitchens. The docks and fish house are fantastic. The metal mesh covered in rubber isn't slippery. It is the same way in the fish house. Dump your ice from your fish cooler and it just melts through the floor into the lake. Has a plastic bench top to clean fish that has plywood boards that fit into the slots. We hired a guide last year and he said it was the nicest set up he had ever seen. And, he lives up there.Hotel was a strategic decision. I stayed at the Holiday Inn express last month with my son but since we had 10 guys and a trailer we decided it was easier to stay at the Americinn. That way we could walk to the Sawmill for drinks/food. People could come and go as they please. We knew we would have some that wanted to stay out late and some that wanted to hit the sack early. Otherwise, we would have to all pile into trucks and go back at the same time."

3174921,MikeinMN,2014-09-13 22:40:00,190,Liked the food pictures! The savages I go to Canada with are requesting no less than frozen pizzas next year. I have wanted to do the whole ribeye roast for a while and it looks like you guys have that down. How long does that take?
3175497,lassh,2014-09-14 08:45:00,553,"Great report. Are you guys from Iowa? I'm a Hawkeye fan too. I went to school there when Woody Hayes was coaching Ohio State. Back then about the only team we could bank on beating was Northwestern...can't count on that anymore. The breakfast burrito thing is a great idea for those who have access to a microwave. You really can't have communal duty free in one vehicle when multiple vehicles are in group. Same goes if you bring any fish back. It used to be that they would understand and check it out, but strict compliance is the name of their game now. 6 or 7 years ago we came back in 2 vehicles, had the fish frozen flat, individually wrapped, labeled with species, length, and person's name, taped together with each person's license in the cooler. The second vehicle was right behind us. We declared all the fish and explained but the US agent pretty much chewed us out, had us pull over; chewed the next group out. She didn't fine us but made it clear that she could have. If we choose to bring fish back, we don't do that anymore. It sounds like y'all had a really good trip. I've not tried LacSeul yet, but would like to someday. Are you taking long boat rides every day? Do you see a lot of other boats around? Thanks for the great report and for the realistic assessment that you provided."
