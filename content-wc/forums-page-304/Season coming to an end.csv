3170817,fishron,2014-09-12 06:53:00,317,Hi Ron. My guys will be fishing a walleye lake just over the border beginning the 21st of September. This cold week coming up can only be good for us. The late season chill has always turned them on along with a healthy population of smallmouth. Lucky thing for us is our week trends a little warmer. Still no shorts and tees in the boat. I think your buddy Kevin will be fishing Charlestown Lake that week. Maybe he'll come over to Wolfe for a day.

3172729,Golden Eagle,2014-09-12 18:20:00,2642,I'm in. October 4 week. Same time just about every year. Only one boat on the lake that week.

3183874,bear52,2014-09-17 11:58:00,3,"Went with Air Tamarac from 9/7 to 9/12. The wind blew every day.Not the ""nice"" drift wind ,the ""need to tie a big rock"" on your anchor wind.Couldn`t even fish one day due to 30/50 MPH wind.Had long johns on most days.Fish were very picky.Would just hold bait for a second and drop it,not to return.We caught enough (barely) to eat,but the fishing was definably not at it`s best .Two mornings below 26 degrees.Instant hot water,propane fired, did not work.Took one COLD shower for the week.Water froze in the am one morning.The wind blew into our cove so hard that it riled the water so bad that we didn`t have any water the last full day.This is a return trip to Hebert after 20 some years ago,for us.I am sure that the fishing was off due to the weather,wind,full moon and low pressure.Too late in the season to chance going that far north.The week before Labor day will be the latest for me from now on.We stayed at the north end of the lake in camp 26.Very nice accommodations .Just wasn`t our week...I think that`s why it is called fishing.We were the last group of the year for that camp.They took the boat motors in the plane with us on our flight..To be fair about the hot water shower malfunction ,,,They did fly in a new thermocouple for the unit.It worked for one shower,It was NOT mine.

3183978,octanehi5,2014-09-17 12:33:00,1104,"Sorry you had such a bad week in camp 26, Those camps are not designed for weather below freezing for any period of time.With this yr temps being below normal the whole season The highest water temp we recorded was in the last week of june it was 70 the last day we were there. The bite was on the last week of june and the first week in July. Weather and wind on this lake,greatly effects the bite. Knowing the lake greatly increases your catching %.I have fished this lake the last 11yrs. In 2013 my weeks total was over 900 wqalleye, this yr it was 450. The fall bite is never going to match,the post spawn bite and into July, My crew of 6 guys will be at camp 26 the last week in June 2015, Hoping to hit what I called the perfect storm in 2013,One can only hope to catch that many again. Good luck in your future"
