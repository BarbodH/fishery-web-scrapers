I am looking for a place in quebec province now or maybe east Ontario. I Walleye fish and pretty much all I want to fish for. Something less than 1000 mile from home and decent price for the week. 1000 or less for sure. I do not have a boat to pull. Any ideas on great walleye fishing spots in quebec? Thank."

However, after a couple of severe drawdowns of the reservoir, our favorite spots ceased to produce. If the level is maintained for several years, I would give it another try. Do a search here for threads pertaining to Cabonga. At present, a six day package with a boat for two, all gas, bait and taxes and park fees is $1050. Not much has been reported on Cabonga this year but there are several that post here that are familiar with the lake. The drive would be well within your limit."

Great fishing, beautiful, remote and totalled a nice boat. I have since heardnumerous: totalled my boat stories from Lac Albanel. Summer of 2013 wedrove the extra 5-6 hours and fished Ontario. We are going back 2015.I have heard good reports from Hebert but check out the # of cabins on that lake before you book. Our group originates from VT & MA, send me a PM."

Three lakes The Gouin which is under your $1000 a week Lake Hebert and Chorlotte come in at just under $1100, But no better lake in quebec for Walleyes. we have had many 200+ wallweye days in one boat. Hebert being 12 miles long and over 1 mile wide Supports all the fisherman that stay on the lake,Charlotte has only one camp on it . I have been fishing Hebert for 11yrs now ,Live in Ct. Good luck in your search"
