As always, the camp was immaculate, the service top notch, and the accommodations remain the best I have ever seen for a fly-in.I took my neighbor who had never done a trip like this and he was a bit reluctant at first about doing a fly-in when I first floated the idea. Suffice it to say he is now hooked (no pun intended) and is already planning to make it an annual trip.I have been fishing this lake since 1995 and can honestly say the fishing has only gotten better each year. Truly an amazing ecosystem that is teeming with walleye and pike. If your thinking about a fly-in and live in Ohio or Michigan I can't imagine a better place to go. Take care,Ruddiger"

Fish were caught in both the Foch and the Buck rivers. We had never been up the Buck and it was quite a pleasant surprise. Gave us a little bit of a chance to explore some new areas. Most consistent location was off of the point on Twin Island out to the break at around 15 feet. David and crew provided us with a camp fish fry one night which was nice to get to know or to catch up with the others in camp.
