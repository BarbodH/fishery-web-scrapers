3182097,tlars,2014-09-16 20:25:00,137,I'll second this. I'm leaving for SWWL tomorrow.
3044665,camp chef,2014-07-30 07:42:00,915,Check out big north lodge on the Winnipeg river. I have been there many times. They have nice boats or you can bring your own. Fishing is awesome as is the accomodations. Bignorthlodge.com
3044977,rich1775,2014-07-30 08:56:00,4,"my wife and i just got back from century lodge in osbourne bay of eagle lake. it was our first time to osbourne and we raised 26 muskies. lost 3. caught 7. one of the lost ones was big enough to make us both fall to our knees in the bottom of the boat for about 10 minutes. i caught 16 incidental walleye and feel if you really targeted them you could do real well. I fished for smallies as well didnt do as well as i hoped but did catch 2 over 18 inches. the lodge is a boat in but it wasnt a hassle of anykind. we did not upgrade our boat which was a big mistake. the upgrade is an 18 footer with 50 hp. four stroke yamaha trolling motor up front and casting deck. lots of areas to fish but its not too vast to get lost. they did real well pointing out hazards and also fishing spots they definitely wanted us to catch fish. one group there was fishing only muskies and they got 15 for the week, the biggest 49.5. we did the american plan and food was good. just know there's no alcohol in the dining room. we didn't."
3047537,Stu,2014-07-31 07:25:00,472,"I would suggest Press Lake or Thaddeus Lake. Both are very remote and are the only lodges on the lakes. The only draw-back to Thaddeus is that it is connected to 2 other lakes by a large culvert. You can motor through it, but when you return you have to pull yourself back by using a large rope (this could be a problem if you have health issues). Thaddeus has really good walleye and musky fishing, and the connecting lakes have walleye, musky and smallmouth. I have been there and it's a really nice place. I have never been to Press Lake, but it comes highly recommended on some of the threads on here. Hawk Lake Lodge looks like an amazing place, but is very pricey ($385 per night). You might also consider Wabaskang. It's one of the favorite lakes on Walleye Central and you can find a ton of info on it. Good luck on your retirement Â– Stu"
3049633,stillangling,2014-07-31 17:17:00,149,"If your primary interest is walleye fishing, then Lac Seul. Hands down but I would avoid the west side out of out of Ear Falls unless you like long boat rides...at least in the summer months. Central portion of the lake and Williams Bay portion in particular would be my suggestion. Average fish can be just crazy. Silver Water Wheel gets lots of attention on this site. Never stayed there and no need to for a local but they fish that portion of the lake. LOW gets my vote if muskies are an important part of the equation. The diversity of the fishery cannot be beat. Trophy perch and crappies are there too. Not normally a spot known for huge walleye but there are lots of 14-20"" fish. I would avoid the Morson area of LOW. I would also avoid Sabaskong Bay. Lots of pressure from a variety of ""sources."" Just my opinion. The central portions of Lake of the Woods (north of the Aulneau and south Shammis island) would be my suggestion."
3049873,port1042,2014-07-31 18:38:00,509,"I'd second Cedar Lake, but personally I fish Perrault Lake and it's great. Wabaskang is very good option in the Perrault Falls area as well. I've stayed at Manotak Lodge 4 times and the first week in September will be trip number 5. It's an excellent choice. I've also talked with a lot a people on the lake that recommend the other 3 lodges on Perrault Lake as well. And I've also heard very good reports from about the lodges on Cedar and Wabaskang. In short, the Perrault Falls area a great choice for a drive-in trip."
3050681,Skyraptor,2014-08-01 04:50:00,291,"You can also look into Ghost River Lodge near Sioux Lookout. It is a drive to lodge and then they boat you in with a short trip. You have about 15 lakes to fish on and the staff, lodge and fishing is excellent. My brothers and myself have fished it for a number of years and always had excellent results plus they do offer a father/son fishing package. Gary Roach fishes out of GRL. Heading there in October for a combo moose/fishing trip with the wife."
3052953,pale ryder,2014-08-01 18:44:00,1937,"X3 on Cedar lake, BIG muskies, lots of walleyes and SMB. I highly recommend Clarks northern Lights resort. Good rates, good rental boats, free minnows.I also recommend Clarks Camp on the Indian chain, lots of muskies, walleyes and SMB.You also can't go wrong with LOTW."
3060385,Jigger1,2014-08-04 16:42:00,234,"Lot of great comments and I would agree with several, if Muskie needs to be in the mix then I think you have three world class choices between LOTW, Eagle, or the far east side of Lac Seul. If you can pass on the muskie and speaking to the heart of your post, then I think you'd have a hard time beating SWWL as one of the best, drive in fishing lodges in all of NW Ontario. It just that good. I'm sure there's oodles of good ones out there, it's just I think it's one of the best. When I started looking for the lodge I wanted to call my home away from home for a week or two a year, I first picked the body of water I wanted to fish which was Lac Seul as I'm out for big eyes, I then wrote an email to several resorts on Lac Seul and that's when Mike set the hook. His response nearly 16 years ago, to this date, is exactly what I've experienced at Silver Water Wheel Lodge and that's some of the best walleye fishing on the planet coupled with incredible service and top notch fishing equipment. Throw in the incredible team he leads and it's why I just keep going back. Will be back at the end of the month."
3180937,derek204,2014-09-16 12:25:00,56,"I always stay at Kingfisher on Wabaskang Lake. The fishing is great, Walleye, Northerns, Perch, not a lot of Muskie but they are in there. Also Lakers and Whitefish if that is something you enjoy. Beautiful drive up the Red Lake hwy about 40min north of Vermillion Bay. Accommodations are great, the atmosphere is excellent and even if you feel tired at the end of the day you can usually grab a few walleye right off the dock while enjoying a cold one. (or a hot drink whatever you like lol) Jerry and Linda the owners are excellent folks and Lester the dock hand will make sure everything you need is taken care of before you head out. He will also clean your fish for you when you get back in off the water! Every Wednesday night they have a fire for all the camp to come and enjoy which Lester Plays a few tunes on his guitar and/or accordion. definitely worth a look http://kingfisherlodge.com/ have fun and tight lines!"
3180977,BreezyPoint,2014-09-16 13:06:00,1581,"Based on what you said, I would have to say Lake of the Woods out of Morson. They have trophy muskie, walleye, smallmouth and pike. As a bonus, it is only an hour's drive to medical care in the U.S. if that is a consideration for you. There are many resorts to choose from right in Morson and several near by boats ins, including Obabikon's place. Frank"
3043745,machster,2014-07-29 19:31:00,6,"Hey guys, I am retireing at the end of the year. My health is not great, so not alot of fishing trips left in me. If you could go to just one more trip to ontario, to fish walleyes, smallmouth and pike/muskies, where would you go? I would like a drive to place, have been on many fly-ins and i would need a more cofortable boat than most fly-ins furnish. I can take my own boat our rent a good boat from outfitter. Give me your opinions. Thanks in advance. Machster"
3043793,Rich B,2014-07-29 19:45:00,1081,"Congrats on your upcoming retirement.....wish you the best with your health for the years ahead....There are a number of top quality camps that could work for you, though tell us where you live and how far you want to drive....8 hours, 12 hoursor several days to get to a great camp....I know you'll be retired, though some guys have a shorter limit on how far they are willing to drive than others.Once you tell us how far you're willing to drive north, I'm sure you'll hear about a number of quality drive-to camp and lodge recommendations.Faith, Family, Friends.....and Fishing,Rich"
3043809,machster,2014-07-29 19:54:00,6,"I am in north central wi. and do not mind 12 to 16 hours of drive time. do not have to do it in a day. my main thing is great fishing and accomadations. All my fly-in had great walleye and pike but no smallies. I have heard lake of the woods has great fishing for all spiecies, but i want to hear it from guys who have been to these places. I was burned by photos and broshures once. thanks again, machster"
3043825,Tayzak15,2014-07-29 19:55:00,48,"I live up in Timmins Ontario and there are a lot of lodges in the area! One lake I would recommend is Horwood Lake. There are 3 lodges on the lake two are drive to and the other one is a boat to one. Horwood Lake Lodge, Big Bear Camp and Horwood Lake outpost. Feel free to look them all up. Horwood is very well known in this area for its high numbers of Pike and Walleye with lots of eating size ones and good chances for monster sized ones as well! there are no Musky in the area and the small mouth are few and far between but they are in there. Feel free to look up all of these lodges. Wish you the best with your health!"
3043865,Mike Borger,2014-07-29 20:11:00,1554,Best drive to lake in the province bar none is Nipigon imo. But the only way to fish it properly is by camping on one of the islands and that's not likely an option for you.Considering your wants and needs the easy answer is Lake Of The Woods.
3043873,toolman1502,2014-07-29 20:13:00,13,"Check this place out, making my 17th trip up next week . Has everything you mentioned 600 miles from central Wi. http://rockyshorelodge.com/ Tight lines to you."
3043913,ftfarms,2014-07-29 20:42:00,444,I've fished many lakes in northwest ontrio and my favorite smaller lake for what your looking for would be cedar lake in puerrualt falls and my favorite large lake would be lotws We stay at cedar point resort on cedar lake and grassy narrows on lotws. Good luck and god bless
3043985,Glenman12,2014-07-29 20:59:00,762,"I second Cedar Lake if your looking for a smaller Ontario Lake..trophy Walleyes, Trophy Muskies and Trophy Smallies...doesnt get better than that..."
3044449,Obabikon,2014-07-30 05:58:00,2370,"You can't go wrong with Lake of the Woods, and if you stay in Morson, it is a shorter drive. Plus the area has very little traffic. As far as drive to resorts go, you can't beat Justin at Mylie's Place! Top notch fishing, and top notch accommodations.http://www.myliesplaceresort.com/"
3044553,SinOrSwim,2014-07-30 06:48:00,1528,"There was a thread similar to this a year or so ago. There were some cool places people mentioned. I wanted to take my son on his first trip this year and decided on Hawk Lake Lodge after looking at many different places. It fits what you are looking for based on what I have read. We haven't been there yet. Leave this Sunday.But, they have the current catch and release world record walleye and an 11 or 12 year old tied the catch and release world record small mouth just a month or so ago. In addition, they have Northern and Lake Trout. I have never caught a lake trout so that would be cool and I have only caught one smallie on my trips to Canada. I also have been extremely impressed with the booking process and how quickly my questions were answered etc. I know Ted reads this forum but it should be mentioned he not only gave me dates that were open, he pointed out some of the dates when other kids my sons age would be there. I'll try to post a trip report when I am back. Suffice it to say my son is extremely excited. I was out of town working the last couple days and when I got home last night, he met me in the garage before I even opened my door and the first words out of his mouth were......Less than one week Dad."
