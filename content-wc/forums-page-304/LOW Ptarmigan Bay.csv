So I didn't make it to the barrier islands, or Ogema, or Shoal as I had originally planned. I stuck around Ptarmigan and Zig Zag. We did very well on walleyes. I caught 2- 29's, a 28.5, 2- 27's among other large walleye's above 23 and above. Most were caught on jigs in 16' to 23'. We were using twister tails sometimes sweetened with a crawler piece or leech. One of the large fish was on caught on the smaller size gramma crank bait casting for pike. We caught some nice pike but no trophies. Smallmouth fishing was inconsistent. I think they are in transition to intermediate/deep water. Some people reported having difficulty catching eater size eyes. We didn't experience that, but the ratio of small fish to large fish was smaller than normal. IMO thats a great problem to have, as long as there are some younger year class fish to grow large. We did very little musky fishing and didn't even see any which is quite unusual for LOW. It was a very good trip and I can't wait to get back."
3172777,jimirjr,2014-09-12 18:47:00,1149,Is Ptarmigan close to Kenora? I am not familiar with that area.... Did You try minnows?
3172817,lassh,2014-09-12 19:26:00,553,Its closer to Clearwater Bay. Maybe 14 miles from Kenora. I didn't use any minnows. I did use some minnow imitating plastics with success. They were like drop shot minnows that I used on a jig.

Had a hard time getting slots until we moved into Ptarmigan proper. Didnt keep count but Im sure we hit triple digits on 22""+. Best was also a 29"".Heading back up next weekend if the weather forecast reverses."
3173441,jimirjr,2014-09-13 06:47:00,1149,My Group will be in a HB out of Sioux Narrows beggining the 24th... We mainly fish near Yellow Girl and spots West.... Hoping the bite (and weather) is good for Us...
