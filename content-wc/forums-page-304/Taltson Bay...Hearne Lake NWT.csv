In short summary......My son got a PB 47in pike and I got a PB 47in Pike as well, I had a bigger pike on but my fish gripper broke in half from the power of these beautiful fish. I had her boat side but could only hand grip her....... and she swam off, easily a 48-50 inch fish.In one evening for the camp (there were 7 of us total) a 49,48,2/47,2/44 and many in the 41/42 range were landed. One of the guys had 9 master anglers in one night. Hearne Lake..........many trout, 140 total for 3 days, 3-5lb average, really fun on a small rod. They were incredible fighters as well. Water was in the upper 40's...........Northern Lights were fantastic as we had a couple of clear nights. Here are a couple of teaser pictures.Enjoy.......New Hips"

3178393,pike50plus,2014-09-15 13:13:00,584,1st week of August we got 60 over 40 biggest a 45 I caught and 257 between 35-40 and we lost a day to weather and smoke got us into camp late om first day too. That place has to be the best big pike fishery anywhere in NA. Coach Bull

3179105,new hips,2014-09-15 18:29:00,498,"Sam, I added up 44 fish over 40 inches for my Son & I. 320 fish total.....With one day lost to weather.......and one day we went on a 27 mile(one way) boat ride up river to the falls. Average pike was 35 inches. Incredible fishing.........the last day I had 9 master anglers, if a storm wouldn't have moved in (with hail) at 8pm we would have got at least 4 more....easily.......we couldn't land them fast enough."
