By far the best for catching was just a week ago. We again went to Fisherman's Cove a great place to go for cabins ,docks ,fish cleaning , boats and just great general information. Dan and Devon once again put us on huge numbers of fish. The first day we put 205 walleyes in my boat by 5:30. Two boats of guys 1713 walleyes for the week biggest being a 28'' and very many 25'' or larger. We don't even count the Northerns but one was over 20 pounds. It was the best walleye fishing we ever had for numbers with most coming from a jig and minnow in 22-27 fow. The place was on fire, what a great trip."
