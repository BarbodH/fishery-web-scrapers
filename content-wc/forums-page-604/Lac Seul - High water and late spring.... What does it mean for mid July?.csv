575944,Guest,2008-07-11 09:21:00,0,"I suspect that it means that the fish will be a bit more scattered than in a ""normal"" year. Probably not completely set into their summer pattern.... might need to vary depths and structure types more than you usually would that time of year. I think you might spend a little more time looking for fish than you have in the past. Good luck."

Found fish in very shallow 4-6 ft along weed edges in the warmer back bays. NONE deeper or in the main lake basin. BUT this may all change by mid week this week and going forward. My usual spots were dead, our group had to put all the pieces together to find fish, when we did they were very aggessive. Main bait used for our group was backtrolling spinner rigs with worms, minnows then leeches, some jigs tipped with minnows, but these fish were HUNGRY! and anything was working, the hard part was finding them. The water is way up, but that does not mean you can go crazy, there was stuff floating everywhere, and alot of really stupid boat drivers going between islands and cutting short over some reefs that only last year you could walk between without getting your knees wet. Be carefull!"

Good luck....things may change dramatically with some warm weather and sunny days, and you get past the mayfly hatch. I was fishing in South Inslet on weds late afternoon, dead calm, and there was a blanket of mayflies, and the only sound was that of 100's of fish slurping the surface at any time. I had never witnessed it before and may never again, but 100's of rings on the surface and some jumping into the air to swallow these things, quite a sight to see. Disheartening when you are trying to catch fish, Ohhh well, there are worse things!"
