575248,Guest,2008-06-20 11:47:00,0,Hi. But frankM as someone said above the plastic ruler will distort over time and not measure correctly. I will have to check mine the next time I am at the boat. Maybe we should bring a ruler and measure the COs box for accuracy that or make our own box instead of using the plastic tape that we all have.
575254,Frankm,2008-06-20 14:20:00,154,Ok thats reasonable but why take any chances if its even close? Is a ticket worth it for less than one bite of fish? In my opinion there is no reason to have a fish over the limit. There is no reason to have too many fish. You act like thats the last fish you'll catch. No I'm not a PETA guy or an overboard catch and release guy. I was just surprised this year with everything I saw.

It also applies to the nearby MAPB lakes (Minnitaki, Abram, Pelican, and Botsford)and perhaps others. The regulations have been revamped this year to avoid such confusion, as well as improve conservation efforts.

Anyway we are on the same page you have your own limit of 17 to keep you protected. This year was just an eye opener for me on how many people that intentionally cheat. The big thing they were cheating on was too many fish. That is just wrong in my opinion. I understand fish can measure different and it is ridiculous. However like you and others do is take precaution by not even taking the chance. >FrankM- I am truly glad you were not my father! LOL Make a >mistake and pay the piper with you huh?

575677,Guest,2008-07-01 13:01:00,0,"Two Ontario Conservation Officers were puling up to boats on Lac Seul on Sunday, 6/22/08. They professonally asked to see our fishing license and measured the fish in our deadwell. A friendly reminder was offered to be careful when measuring fish. Lay them flat and pinch the tail (one could get bad measurements using the plastic tape on the side of the boat). He even complimented our fish as it was under the slot by an inch. They did ask us open our cooler and found some beer in the bottom (now how did those get in there). They informed us that the laws had recently changed and no alcohol was allowed on board. HOWEVER, he went on to say they were not there to ruin anyone's vacation and they understand one needs a litle brew for mixing fish batter or maybe one on shore with lunch. 5 minutes later later they were on to the next boat. *** Disclaimer *** The following information is not from any official source so take it for what is is worth; second hand heresay from an annymous poster.

575801,Guest,2008-07-05 16:20:00,0,Due Dillegence requires the officers to ticket or intervene. If there is beer evident in the boat there could be a safety issue and he or she has to get involved. If they choose to ignore and there is an accident or issues he/she is liable.

Had a group of 8 guys arrive in camp, they were on a fly out fishing trip, all the hotels in Red lake were full, they were just staying the night. The fellows were pumped about their fly out trip & asked if they could fish off the camp docks, I said it was OK. In drove C.O. Don Maw for a camp check. It turned out these 8 fellows didn't have their fishing licenses and all had rods in hand casting off the docks. I was surprised, I thought here we go, a thousand dollars worth of fines being handed out. The fellows explained to Officer Maw that the fly out camp they were going to supplied the conservation fishing licenses with their package, and showed proof that they had prepaid for their trip, including their fishing licenses. Now I guess you want to hear the rest of the story...... We all know fishing license first then go fishing. Conservation Officer Don Maw suggested to the fellows if they were to have fishing license when he was finished checking the other cottages no charges would be laid. They came into the camp store & bought fishing licenses. Believe it or not a couple of the guys wanted to argue with the game warden about why should they have to buy fishing licenses because they were already included, talk about stupid people. The guys mental math skills were in the tubes, a fishing license for $26.00 or a fine of a $100.00 plus. Too late to make a long story short. Officer Don Maw let the whole group off with a warning after everyone had bought a fishing license. Conservation Officer Don Maw didn't have to give these guys a break, but he did. I am sure there are lots of stories like this out there."

The Ministry of Natural Resources checked 353-anglers and laid 18-charges. Offences included overlimits of fish, possessing walleye of prohibited length, possessing live fish, consuming alcohol in a boat and throwing beer bottles into the lake. And some of you wonder why C.O.'s seem to lay a lot of charges. Try putting up with what they have to deal with on a daily basis.

If it is $165 for 1 fish being 1/8 inch over...in my opinion this is excessive. Since we all know the rules on this site, we should error on the side of caution. Additionally, since we are probably mostly from U.S. we do not have a direct voice to impact changes. Just be careful. That being said, I still beleive the CO's know, for the most part, the difference between a lame excuse and an accident. While it is within their autority to write the ticket, discretion can be used and offer a little compassion and education."

Yes, ignorance is not a defense, but come on people. Most people can spot the difference. If you don't feel the same way.... lets give everyone a ticket for going 1 mile over, driving to slow, spitting on the sidewalk. I personally believe that some CO's and cops, get a little power and feel they have to use it. Not all mind you but some.

Tickets for 1 mile over, spitting on the sideway, criminal prosecution for all minor errors on tax returns.

575152,Guest,2008-06-17 08:35:00,0,"Hi all, These folks are just doing their jobs. Like it or not the law is the law and ignorance is not an excuse. Read your regs and throw anything questionable back. I've had an expierence with MNR on Dryberry about five years ago. Don't know the gentlemans name and really don't care. When he first pulled up he asked for our lisences and what we were fishing for. After a brief conversation and a once over the boat he was on his way. The man was buisness like and very professional. I had my things in order and avalible for him and he treat me and my father with the respect and kindness we showed him."

It would not surprise me his measuring device was off. While I have no sympathy for those who are blatantly violating the law, a 1/4"" seems like BS to me, but that's maw and like suggested better to release fish that close than to deal with him. Obabikon is correct, Ontario is not depleted or even close, at least by the MNR and a email I received from them last fall, the slot limit is to keep the levels of fish at where they are, not to replenish number of fish. Better safe than sorry I guess. Al"
575112,Guest,2008-06-16 11:17:00,0,"You have to be assertive in your dealings with MNR. You have to respect what he is there to do while looking after your rights. I have heard Maw this and Maw that. ""Illegal"" searches can only take place if you allow them to. Know your rights. The officer may say ""I am going to search your cabin"" and if you allow him...he is doing a search with permission. Say no or bring in the OPP the provincial police. To complain about it after the search and charges is wrong. Deal with it at the time. The fish thing was preventable...Learn from the experience and move on."
575115,Frankm,2008-06-16 11:37:00,154,"I don't understand this ""what about a warning"" or ""it was only a 1/4 inch over"". Bottom line is they broke the law period. Whether or not we like it those are the laws. Its not like the wardens are just going around the lake boat to boat checking licenses and fish and everyone is legal. Unfortunately as I said earlier they are going out there catching alot of people fishing with too many rods, keep too many fish, keeping slot size fish, keeping fish over the limit. The day I talked about earlier the warden had probably 50 rods that they confiscated. Thats alot of people breaking the law. In my opinion thats why they are unfriendly because they are catching people cheating left and right. To me its ridiculous the amount of people cheating. Another thing I see too often is fish mistreated. Every year I see guys walleye fishing and catching small pike. For some reason they feel the need to throw them back overhand pitch style. I've witnessed it done with walleye too. What is the point of that? I'm sure the MNR has watched plenty of that too. Sorry for the rant and I'm not pointing any fingers. In my opinion I would guess most of the people on this board are true sportsman. It's too bad the cheaters make it stressful for all of us."

They surely wouldn't survive with even MORE additional pressure. Don't act like American fishermen are saving the Canadian economy! That's the dumbest thing anyone can actually try to say. Canadian fisheries are saving US fishermen! (and I'm an American citizen, and I think you're acting like an idiot) Anglers take out more fish per year than do netters. The average camp can put 300-500 guests through per season. (let's say they average a 4 day stay) That means they are allowed to keep 8 walleyes per trip (2 per day, which almost everyone does). So, each camp takes out 2400-4000 fish per year. Conservative estimate, that there are around 100 resorts on lake of the woods... 240,000-400,000 fish are taken out by resorts alone every season. That doesn't include weekend fishermen, or people who own cabins. Also, that's assuming that everyone follows the rules, and just keeps 2 per day. Many people get two in the morning, eat them for lunch, and get two more in the afternoon. The commercial fishing is an issue, but in Ontario, it doesn't do the damage that the fishermen do. I'm probably waisting my time even debating this with you. All I can say is this... don't break the law or you're going to get a ticket.

Canadian >fisheries are saving US fishermen! (and I'm an American >citizen, and I think you're acting like an idiot) > Actually, that is not completely true. Lake of the Woods is one of nature's best naturally reproducing sites for walleyes. But in the mid-1980's LOW had to undergo walleye stocking. The fishery had been harmed and couldn't keep up with the fish being taken from it by fishermen and commercial fisheries. It has thrived after most of the commercial fisheries were bought out by the Canadian government during the 1990's. As far as ""acting like an idiot"" (your words as quoted above) -- you might avoid that yourself by being more informed ... and being less strident and more tolerant in your opinions."

I did not make that claim or anything of the sort about 20 years ago. My statement was not directed towards the 1980's, and therefore was correct. LOTW's is thriving right now. They adjusted fishing regulations (I believe it was 8 walleyes per day in the 80's... 6 most of the 90's, and now 2per day 4 total). You are correct that they have bought out many of the commercial fishermen, and that along with the changes in regulations has helped LOTW's thrive. You're probably right, that I am a little too opinionated. However, I try to keep them factual, and I appologize when I'm incorrect. Which has happened several times. This is not one of those spots though. The arrogance that muskyhunter was showing about the need for US fishermen in Canada, which should basically give them a free pass to ""bend"" the law irritated me.

575043,Goldeneagle,2008-06-13 17:22:00,78,Donny Maw is the king of illegal searches. And does so with no probable cause. Over and over. Year after year. His superior is his enabler.
575047,dewyg,2008-06-13 18:48:00,1006,"Muskygary So the jist of your statement, is that to ensure the resorts stay open then the mnr should allow people to break the law. That makes a lot of sense. The hollow threat that if we as Canadians do not let tourists do what they want then they will stop coming to Canada, therefore crushing our economy. You kind sir are simple!"

Passports, high gas prices, and game wardens >who are jerks and then you wonder why no one is going to >Canada? Just remeber- no american money- no open resorts! I compare ""dangling a rod over the edge"" to netting. It makes catching fish easier. You're more likely to catch/injure/kill more fish than you are with a single rod. If fishing with two rods is ok, is fishing with three ok? What about four? Five? Where do you stop it. It stops at ONE... that's the rule, anything more than one is a criminal activity, and deserves a ticket. Remember, if there are No Canadian resorts, ALL US FISHERMEN WILL HAVE TO FISH MINNESOTA!!! The lack of rule enforcement and crazy amounts of pressure have already damaged the fisheries there! They wouldn't last 2 years. Infact, it would probably have to immediately go to all catch and release, just to keep the sport active. Both sides benefit from Canadian fisheries... you're a guest here, act like it."
575052,v-bay gord,2008-06-13 19:19:00,3168,"So then, Musky Gary, in your opinion then we should bow to the pressure of the $, relax our fisheries regulations (so that everyone can bend the rules a bit) and be happy and content when things go down the sh*t hole. I beg to differ. The law is the law...if you base your arguement on the supposed rod dangling over the side scenario, well maybe that happens occasionally. More than often, I would bet, that people who intentionally break the law have similar, dumb explanations as to what they were up to. I would bet that anyone who has had to enforce any regulations would soon become hardened because of all the ""weasels"" who try and squirm their way out of a fine. To maintain a great fishery you need some regulations to back it up. If some think it is too tough, well then tough sh*t....spend your money elsewhere. There are plenty of Americans who appreciate the fishery we have up here and the way we attempt to protect it."
575057,Obabikon,2008-06-13 21:04:00,2370,"What?!?!?!?! You mean people would lie to get out of a ticket? Sad thing is, they teach their kids to do the same thing, but that's an entirely different arguement. I agree 100% that the officers hear that story all the time, and maybe one out of 500 are actually true. Find a new excuse for using multiple rods..."
575060,Muskygary,2008-06-14 05:42:00,137,What ever happened to giving a guy a warning? You can see he's from out of country. He makes a minor mistake and you ruin his trip by finding him half his money! If it's not a fun trip I won't go back.
575061,Muskygary,2008-06-14 05:46:00,137,Dangling a rod over the side means the bait is in the top six inches of water. Im not talking about dragging a bait on the bottom. Here in Indiana we usually leave a bait over the side just in the water to keep it wet. Were not fishing with it. Like I said why not give the guy a warning?
575063,pepe,2008-06-14 07:23:00,269,"getting back to the original post, about finding the northern to be to long and then releasing it. when i fished lac seul about 3yrs ago they made us use a club on every fish we were going to keep to kill it, so we could not cull. the fact that you had a live fish in the boat would have been a violation, or has the law changed?...pepe"
575068,Muskygary,2008-06-14 08:35:00,137,As far as the fishery being depleted - it is because of the netting and commerical fishing by the Indians. Does the Indians still sell croppie from your bay? The problems you have are made by your own government! Don't blame out of country fishermen!
574891,Guest,2008-06-10 15:49:00,0,"Yes we pinched the tail. Also our measuring device is a 36"" steel ruler which my buddy has glued to the gunnel of his Lund Pro-V. No shrinkage with the steel ruler. You can bet we'll let anything close go back!!!"

574976,v-bay gord,2008-06-12 07:20:00,3168,I don't agree that their job is to fine people. Their job is to enforce the fisheries regulations. If an infraction occurs (the fish is either in the slot or not) then the process is in place to deal with it. It should be a cut and dry matter....excuses should play no role in whether the individual is fined or not. Too many people have no ethics and would use any loop-hole to bend the rules if they could. I don't envy the job the CO's do and the bad rap they get for just doing their job.....which for the most part is very professional. It is up to the fishermen to know the laws before they leave the dock.
574981,Guest,2008-06-12 09:20:00,0,You can take the citation to court. The judge will make a ruling as to the measuring device used. We make it standard practice not to keep any fish close to the slot. I would have measured the officers device with my ruler at the time he was there. He may have cut you some slack. You have a tough battle ahead of you. You are also bringing possible issues to the officer by mentioning him by name. Instead of going on a chat board talk to his supervisor. At least if his equipment is not in order others will not share the same fate. By the way the type of board he measures with is carried by a lot of COs.
574995,Guest,2008-06-12 14:26:00,0,"I would just pay the fine and be done with it, not worth the bother."
575035,Guest,2008-06-13 13:47:00,0,"It is a poor excuse to be as strict as many officials are.I've been very conscious over the years to be within the rules but every trip into canada has spawned polite jerks every time. Officers and agencies absolutely benefit from fines and tickets indirectly and yes they are made aware of how past performance is to current results.I grew up around and with alot of officers in the states.New equipment cars,boats etc. for the aqgencies is usually the kind of thing the monies are spent on."
575036,dewyg,2008-06-13 14:15:00,1006,"If you break the law you pay the fine! Simple everybody is complaining about being charged for breaking the law. Hint YOU BROKE THE LAW! Who cares what the guys name was you still broke the law, he is there simply to enforce rules set forth by other people to protect the fishery etc.. I would be embarassed to go on a public forum and cry about being charged with violating a rule."
574832,Guest,2008-06-09 19:22:00,0,"We were on Gullrock May 31st to June 6th. We were checked by the MNR, Warden Don Maw, on the 31st. He checked our licenses and the fish we had. We had a northern which we measured 4 times and by our measurements was just under the legal limit of 27.5 inches (70 centimeters). When the warden measured the fish with his measurement device, which was a home made trough with a lip board at one end the fish measured 71 centimeters, or just over the legal limit. The northern was alive and was released. I was still cited for possesion of a slot length fish to the tune of $125.00. Just a word of warning...Mr. Maw's measuring device has a steel ruler on it , but the ruler doesn't start at the lip board, but starts appoximately 12 inches from the lip board. My only mistake was not asking to compare the two measuring devices. We have been fishing Gullrock for 9 years and bring our fathers up in the spring. I am not a violator! We had kept the fish for a meal of northern at camp. I just wanted to get this out there in case any one else keeps a fish close to the legal limit. I was polite with the warden, he even thanked me for being polite and honest, but still got cited for possesion of a slot length fish. Just make sure as his ruler is the law!!!!! P.S. Had the warden not been able to release the fish the fine would have been double!!!"
574846,Whopper,2008-06-10 04:54:00,340,"Never met the man but heard a lot of stories about him, seems as if he operates on his on agenda. I'm all for following the rules but he seems to take it to extremes to find infractions. I was stopped and checked on the 105 on the May 24th by a road block set up by the MNR & OPP to check for fish and just glad Mr. Maw wasn't the officer to check my truck, I had no fish but somehow it seems to me that if Mr. Maw would have checked he would have produced a violation of some sort. The officer that did check was very professional and polite though Sorry to hear about your misfortune."
574849,v-bay gord,2008-06-10 06:18:00,3168,"I'm sure you didn't intentionally break the law but by definition the fish was illegal whether it was only 1 cm over or 10. Unfortunately you are assuming your measuring device was correct and his was wrong. My suggestion to people with a ""on the border line"" fish is to be on the safe side and release it. Conservation officers get a bad rap when they enforce the law to the letter, but hey, that is their job. It was unfortunate you had to be on the receiving end of a hard lesson due to a simple mistake."
574856,Guest,2008-06-10 07:41:00,0,"Made ""my"" own length limits for the boat. On my measuring device, all legal lengths are marked, Walleye below 17.5 Pike below 27. Half inch doesn't seem to matter much if you are using a large enough cooking pan when you fry them. I've been checked a few times, but only out on the ""busy"" spot jumping lakes. The MNR folks have always been professional. Try offering them a beer sometime after they check you..LOL! Then come back and post the results, sorry kevin had to put that on here I still get a chuckle about that one.......... Happy Fishin' Wallace"
574861,Guest,2008-06-10 08:36:00,0,"Matt, Just one thing, because you didn't mention it...did you pinch the tail of the fish?? Length is measured as total length with the mouth closed and the the tail pinched. The standard rule is no matter how much you stretch to get that total length, the MNR will always be able to get another 1/4"". The above mentioned policy of just tossing away anything close would prevent such occurrences. NWO Fishing Bum"
574868,Frankm,2008-06-10 10:05:00,154,We do as others if its even close toss it back. They have zero tolerance and for good reason. I was very upset to hear from someone that stayed at the camp next to us. Several cabins were busted with too many fish over the possession limit. It was $180 per fish. This year the MNR had survelliance from the land and also busted several of them for fishing with too many rods. Last year a boat at the camp I stayed at got nailed for too many rods. That $100 per rod and they keep the rods. You wouldn't have believed the bundles of rods in the back of the MNR boat. Its a shame that there are so many cheaters out there.
574869,Guest,2008-06-10 11:08:00,0,What is the limit on the number of rods? Is it different in other regions?
574873,Frankm,2008-06-10 11:55:00,154,You can only use one at a time in NW Ontario.
574875,Hump,2008-06-10 12:36:00,578,"Several years ago, I had the misfortune of meeting a conservation officer on Keg Lake. We had been given misinformation where we had obtained our licenses. Long story, but he wasn't nice. After he nailed us(after following us back to camp) he proceeded to nial a fisherman for two many rods. He had used one and put it down with the lure dangling over the enge of the boat. Nailed him for two many rods. Big fine and confiscasted the rods. Dave Hamlin was the officers name."
574878,Guest,2008-06-10 12:56:00,0,"I have the Iowa DNR measuring sticker (28"") at the front of my boat and the longer (48"") in the middle of the boat. I was just up at Gullrock and saw the MNR guy take a rod from someone and was at their boat for quite some time, rightfully so as the guy in back was jigging with a pole and dragging another. We had some 18 inchers right on the button in the boat. A buddy in the boat asked me how long I had the stickers on, it was about 3 years for the front one and 2 years for the longer. He asked me if I had ever checked them out to see if they were accurate. When I got home I measured them with a tape and the older one was almost 1/4"" off. The newer one was a little over 1/16"" off. So, if you have a spare minute, it's good idea to do a quick check before you go out. I feel tho, that in your situation, common sense would have let you go with a new awareness of your measuring sticker. JohnB.O.A.T."
