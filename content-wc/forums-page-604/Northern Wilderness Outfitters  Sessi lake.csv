Sessi was a hard one to get a spot in according to a friend of mine who uses this outfitter every year. The cabin was nice and boats and motors adequate. Planes are definetely TOP NOTCH!! The owners were so busy working did not get chance to talk to us at all. Mitzie was a huge help in getting trip up. I would do my own food package next time but I am picky. Heard mostly good things about outfitter. Is nice taking off in Ft Frances VS Red Lake or Sioux Lookout. saves ya at least 4 hours.
