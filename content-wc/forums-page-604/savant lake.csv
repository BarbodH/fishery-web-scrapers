575319,pmarasco,2008-06-22 16:07:00,13,"Got back from Savant last night. The weather was cold and rainy for the first few days with a high of 38 degrees F on one day. But the last two days were warm and we got out of the rain gear just in time to get sun burned. You could see a lot of minnow forage around but the weed growth looked to be about a month behind. However- there were a bumper crop of ""new"" rocks to hit since the water was about 8 to 12 inches higher than normal which submerged a lot that you could usually see from the surface. It appears that the spawn was over the week before as the walleyes were no longer in Never Freeze and had not yet completely moved to their normal post-spawn/pre-summer locations around the islands. If you weren't on the lake by 5 am you could sleep in until noon. The fish in Finger Bay, Bear Paw, North East Arm, and the Lungs (I told you that I only go north) didn't seem ready to be caught until the afternoon when the wind (and the water chop) picked back up. We got completely skunked in Southeast Bay which may be because we switched to Northerns for the afternoon. Numbers in the above spots were below normal but we still had no problem limiting out on 17 inch fish by Thursday morning. The biggest walleye was 27 inches and a 38 inch northern was caught and released ( - go get 'em). The lake trout were very confused. They were completely scattered and I caught two (one 17 lbs and the other was 6) while trolling for Northern in 14 to 18 feet of water in Whitefish bay. One group went south of the Narrows and caught 8 lakers but we were the only ones that I know of that caught any others. MNR came down in a float plane and pulled someone over in the Narrows on Wednesday and gave out a ticket for having beer in the boat. They had to return to camp (about a 45 minute ride) to return the beer before they could go back to fish. We re-booked for next year a week earlier. Let the 2009 spring thaw betting commence!"
575553,Guest,2008-06-28 06:02:00,0,"Just got back last night. As always Cliff and Roma were great host. Cliff was around all week and helped us with our lake trout fishing. The fishing was slower than other years but we caught all the fish we wanted and the lake trout topped it off. Big, several 25""/over walleye and smaller ones. One day we had trouble catching ones small enough to have our meal for the day. ""Never Freeze"" just opened and was a hot spot for all you wanted. ""Bear Paw"" was hot also, so had to travel a little to fish. Rained off and on the whole week and only seen the sun a couple days. Our last day it seemed ""Finger Bay"" was just getting started as we caught them right and left the last afternoon. Cliff said everything was behind. I'd give the fishing an 7 out of ten compared to the other years we've been there but had a great time. ""Walleye, fried potatoes, beans and Labatts Blue, it doesn't get any better than that!"""
575563,Pooch,2008-06-28 13:33:00,4619,"We leave tomorrow (Sunday) morning. Just now loading the truck and finishing up odd jobs around the farm. My brain left sometime before lunch, with a little luck I'll catch up with it on the water. Thanks for the reports. I'll post when we get back. If you guys think of anything else shoot me an email. I'll do the same. Leeches? Worms? Minnows? Pooch"
575568,Guest,2008-06-28 18:19:00,0,Minnows and a bare jig hook worked for me. Some of the guys used twister tales.(pink and green) Lots of northerns after the walleyes we caught. Have fun
575967,Pooch,2008-07-11 18:17:00,4619,"Arrived back home from Lake Savant Tuesday. Trip was a good, but fishing was tougher than in the past. (Different time of year) First part of the week good numbers and size were located in the back of wind blown bays. Two days later there wasn't a fish to be found in those same area. Not even on the LCD. Last week seemed to be the time when they were moving out of the bays and into deeper water. By the end of the week we could locate fish in deeper (20' maybe more) water. Bear Paw was dead with the exception of a few stragglers. I did pick up a legit 29.5"" @ 7.2# on the point going into Bear Paw. (Not skill on my part, just poor karma on the fishes part! Yes, she was released.) Only fish I caught that morning! Other boat caught a dozen or more deeper in the bay. Like I said the fish were on the move. Fished the narrows every night with it being dead the first few days then a couple good evenings. One night it was minnows and the next night it was completely dead. Then the next night it was a hot leech bite and they totally ignored minnows. The fish were telling us something, but I don't know what it was. The narrows has changed and isn't nearly as good as it was years ago. Fish and or baitfish pattern is changing. There has got to be some really good evening fishing further north on the lake. Too far for us that use the south camp to go to at night. There are several spots I'd like to fish, but I don't want to be over an hour boat ride at night back to camp. Especially during the dark of the moon or cloudy. When the fish disappeared from the bays we started catching them trolling cranks. You could see them suspended about three to ten foot off of the bottom. Spinner bite was slow except a silver blade seemed to ad flash and was a factor when things got tough. Even if the blade was not turning. New owners of Wildewood seem to be very pleasant folks. Only was able to speak with them a couple times as they arrived back in camp the night before we left. New cabin(s) under construction. With more to come. Lots of changes in store for the camp over the next few years. We saw more wildlife this trip than all of the past years trips put together. Whether on the road or on the lake. Caribou and calves were everywhere. Moose with twins swam across the bay in front of camp about every day. Bears in the water and one young adult bear in camp the first night. Anyone ever noticed how big a bear looks when you come upon him as you are headed for the outhouse?! Nobody made anymore late night trips to the outhouse that week. Biting insects were bad this year. Not enough to make it uncomfortable, but enough that all of us came home with welts. That's all I can think of. I'll be headed back in ten days or so for two weeks with another group. If any of you are up there before we leave, a report would be appreciated. Pooch"
574766,Guest,2008-06-08 10:28:00,0,Any one got any news on the fishing on Savant Lake so far this year?
574771,Pooch,2008-06-08 13:00:00,4619,Three weeks from now I could tell you! We will be at Wildewood. You? Pooch
574773,Guest,2008-06-08 15:15:00,0,Cliff and Roma's June 20th-27. I usally see reports on the Wildwood site but none this year.
574779,Pooch,2008-06-08 21:34:00,4619,"New owners this year. Updated website over the winter, but nothing lately for fishing reports. A number of people from both camps follow the weekly reports. Waiting to see how it goes with new owners this year. We've gotten pretty comfortable with the former owner over the years. When you get older you hate change! One of those ""Who moved my cheese?"" things. I wonder why Cliff & Roma and Cat Track don't advertise or have a website? If you didn't know they were there you wouldn't even be aware that they had a camp. How would you know who to call for a booking? Word of mouth? Wildewood seems to be the nicer of the camps, but Cliff & Roma and Cat Track are more centrally located on the lake. Price seems to be about the same. Cliff seems to be a nice guy. Have met some of their kin on the lake and they are nice folks also. When are you there? We will make our first trip over the fourth of July. Pooch"
574780,Pooch,2008-06-08 21:35:00,4619,I just saw your reply on dates. You'll be coming out about the time we go in. Have a good trip. Pooch
574788,pmarasco,2008-06-09 07:29:00,13,"Our party is going to Cat Track at the end of the week which is two weeks later than we usually go. I guess we lucked out in delaying the trip two weeks this year. One of our group spoke with the owner when we were making plane reservations about a week ago. There was still ice north of Neverfreeze as of May 26. Fishing was ok at the time as spawn just seemed about to be getting started. As for the Wildewood/Cat Track/Roma's discussion. Our party used to go to Wildewood before we stopped in at Cat Track one year to buy some gas. After seeing the location and the accomodations we have not been back to Wildewood in over 10 years. Since we fish North East arm and Neverfreeze a lot it makes much more sense to be at Cat Track. If you fish the south end then I can see why Wildewood is your choice. Plus we really get along with Carol, the owner of Cat Track."
574949,Guest,2008-06-11 18:15:00,0,"Will be my 4th or 5th time at Cliff and Roma's. Can't beat the hospitality and that's a big reason we go back there. Started going with my brother-in-law who used to go every year, now we're down to once every 2 years. Where's the best spot for lake trout. Haven't fished for them on Savant yet but plan on this year. Haven't ever went south either but hear the narrow's is hot. It's been great fishing every time we've went. Have a good time. We'll be there the week of the 21st. later"

574954,Pooch,2008-06-11 20:25:00,4619,"Cliff seems to have the lake trout dialed in. Sometimes I see him on the south end of the lake across from the bay where Wildewood is located. He's in fairly deep water and I think there is a break about where he fishes. I also see guys from that camp fishing west of the wall in deep water. Watched them catch several in a short period of time last year on that spot. We were fishing walleye not far from them and they appeared to be having a good morning. I don't have the patience for lake trout fishing. But, the couple I've caught by accident were a hoot. Feels like the walleye of a life time then it turns out to be a lake trout about five or six pounds! Have a good trip and let us know how it went. I'm hoping pmarasco gives us a report when he gets back too. The narrows is hit or miss. Some nights it's fish every cast others it's a bust. It's about the only place to go at night if your staying on the south end of the lake. If we were at one of the north camps, there are several places I'd like to try at night. All of them way to far for us to travel at night back to our bed. Take care. Pooch"
