575792,Guest,2008-07-05 10:13:00,0,I bought a boat and am heading down to South Dakota to pick it up. Any heads up on what I need to make this as painless as possible at the border crossing. Do you have to let the border crossing know in advance that your bringing a boat back? Thanks for any info on this matter CURRIE

You will pay GST on the trailer and the RIV fee of about $210. Don't try to get a receipt for 1/2 of what the rig is worth; the border guards are all over people like that. Otherwise it's like buying something at Target. Claim it and pay your taxes. If you are taking more than 10K US cash, into the States, you must declare it when you enter the US. Pretty easy..........."
575806,Guest,2008-07-05 22:14:00,0,"Thank CYVA; Just to clarify, are you talking about the original receipts from when the boat and trailer were purchased new or the receipts(bill of sale) from my transaction when I buy the boat. If it is from my bill of sale, would you guess to what the trailer is worth on its own?"
575813,Guest,2008-07-06 11:46:00,0,CYAVs post is very clear. It is painless if you have receipts. I always had clear title to the equipment I bought as well. RIVs web site is also very clear. Never lie about the value. Good luck.
575820,Guest,2008-07-06 20:22:00,0,Any links or total name of RIV so I can acess their website?
575842,AMPHIB206,2008-07-07 10:14:00,191,"The simple answer to the above inquiry riv.ca The second answer; Your receipts needed are from the person you are buying it from. It would be nice to have the title of the boat/motor/trailer to know for peace of mind that there is no outstanding loan on the rig. Having said that the US border/ CDN border doesn't care if there is a lien on the rig. Make up a price for your trailer. That's what I did. $250, and no one batted an eye............."
