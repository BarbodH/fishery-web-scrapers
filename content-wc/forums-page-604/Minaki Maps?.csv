575883,Spike the net man,2008-07-09 05:33:00,18,"Yes, Very good maps can be purchased at the marina in Minaki or if you are in the Minneaplolis area, Thorne Bros. has the maps as well."
575886,Guest,2008-07-09 07:32:00,0,"Spike, Thanks for the info. Do you know what brand the maps is so that I might be able to get one before I go up there?"
575893,Guest,2008-07-09 10:01:00,0,"Hi jigstop I have purchased maps for Minaki from the following people in Neehah Wisconsin. They have two maps for that area, 1-being from Minaki to White Dog (map 6286) and 2-being Kenora to Minaki (map 6287). The name of the Co. is US/Canadian Map Co., the e-mail is [email protected] and there web site is www.uscanadianmap.com. Phone number is 920-731-0101 and fax is 920-731-0101. The maps come already laminated. deisel"
575894,Guest,2008-07-09 11:06:00,0,"Don, Thanks for the advice! I know that you fish out of Paradise Lodge quite a bit in fact I even left a note on your Suburban a couple years ago at the boat launch there thinking you were Bruce Elliot - sorry about that! I assume that I would need the Minaki to White Dog map for the area around Paradise namely Big and Little Sand Lakes. Do you by chance have a chip of the area? I could work out a nice trade to borrow it for a week if you do and are not using it. I have just about every chip for Wisconsin but none for Canada. By now you are probably wondering just who the heck I am! Email me at [email protected] and I'll fill you in on who I am. I also live in Manitowoc."
575897,doc,2008-07-09 11:58:00,143,The Navionics LOW 2k chip covers that area. I used it a couple weeks ago when I stayed at Paradise Cove and found it to be very accurate.
575918,Guest,2008-07-09 21:06:00,0,"Thanks guys, I just ordered a new chip."
575920,TECK,2008-07-10 07:29:00,151,How has the fishing been.I'm all packed and will be on my way Fri. Hope to get some Muskies.
575922,Guest,2008-07-10 09:54:00,0,Would this also cover the English River system where Halley's Camps are located- NW of Minaki?
