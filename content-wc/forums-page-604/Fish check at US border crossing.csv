575821,SoDakMac,2008-07-06 20:42:00,218,"We just got back from Canada and must have lucked out. We had two outfits with all the fish in one cooler in the second truck though the border. We were in the first truck and just told them the number of fish and species and that they were all in a cooler in the truck behind us. They removed the cooler (we had it at the back of the box), counted the fish, checked a few bags and sent us on our way. They never said anything about having all the fish in one cooler and in one truck. I guess we had better pack differently in the future if we bring fish back."
575898,fourize,2008-07-09 12:58:00,287,"We always cross at the 1,000 Islands, and in the 15 years my Dad and I have been going to Canada, U.S customs has checked our fish twice. No problems what so ever...just a quick look. Actually, we just started bringing fish home 3 years ago, and the 2 times we've been checked, were the last 2 years. Maybe they can smell 'em. About the 3rd year we went up, we were checked by the Canadian DNR once during a roadside check, about 30 miles from camp. It was the first week in June, and alot of cars from the states were pulled over. The gentleman asked to open our coolers, and we told him ""sure but we have no fish"", but asked to check anyways. He then asked, ""fishing that bad?"" We told him no, we were strictly catch and release, and he told us thankyou for doing that and have a nice day. Heading up friday, and i'll post what happens on this trip when we get back."
575685,Bill Krejca,2008-07-01 17:38:00,6107,"The 2 countries have a reciprocal agreement, which covers fish checking. It is not unusual for U.S. authorities to check fish caught in Canada. Sometimes, they'll even do it miles down the road from the border on the U.S. side."
575697,Guest,2008-07-02 07:46:00,0,I always have people in our group fill out a sheet of paper stating how many fish they have in their coolers. The sheet also states how many are large and small. We have handed the boarder guard this paper and have never been checked.
575700,Guest,2008-07-02 08:41:00,0,"Last August the Minnesota DNR was at the border when we came through. We had 2 vehicles & all fish in one cooler. The other vehicle went right through. I had all 6 limits in my cooler and only 3 licenses. Customs lets us through but told us we had to stop at DNR check. We were in violation & I asked the officer if I could call the other group on cell phone. None of them had their cell phones on! They were waiting for us at Border Bob's Duty Free to buy dry ice for the trip home. I asked if I could send one of the guys walking to bring them back. He said no, but to hop in his truck. There they were standing in the parking lot looking for us. He made me stay in vehicle and went and talked to them. He asked them to come back to the check point. They went through the fish and inspected both boats and vehicles. He checked all 6 of our licenses and then called us all together for a lecture. He was polite and so were we. I was issued a warning ticket - no fine. Warning. Split you fish up between vehicles & licenses. There was a post on this I started when I got back about Minn.CNR doing fish checks at the Falls. Somebody replied that had been in the same situation later the same day. They were each fined $160. I got off luck. Hopefully being polite and answering all their questions truthfully helped my case."

575714,jokerjim,2008-07-02 17:05:00,473,T wonder if you had all six fishing licenses in a freezer bag in the cooler that the fish were in would have been o.k.?
575716,Guest,2008-07-02 18:02:00,0,"Came through last Friday morning. 1st time they ever asked us about fish and we were honest and legal but had to stop anyway. Minn DNR. He was nice, but did look. I also couldn't figure out why they were checking on the USA side."
575734,Guest,2008-07-03 09:44:00,0,"I can't believe how many times I have read about people taking an entire groups worth of fish, in one vehicle. If we're smart enough to keep our fish individualized in the boat while fishing, you should be smart enough to keep them individualized in the car on the way home. You have to have more than 1 cooler on your trip, right? Wow."
575737,Mohleye,2008-07-03 12:19:00,368,"You know, the guy made a mistake, and was nice enough to share his experience so it wouldn't happen to someone else. In the rush of trying to pack and get out of camp early to beat the lines at the border, it would be pretty easy to throw all the fish in one cooler, especially when that's usually the last thing packed. We're not all perfect, Mr Unlogged Unlogged. Please consider trying to add something positive sometime."
575775,Capn Hooker,2008-07-04 18:15:00,333,"One year on the way to LOTW we were pulled aside at the crossing in Baudette by the Canadians. They went through the car & boat. Didn't make much of a mess & were very polite. They found everything ship shape. Two days later we were stopped on the water by the MNR. They checked licenses, fish, gear & safety equipment. They were very polite. On the way home we were pulled aside again at the border by the U.S. guys. They went through the car and boat, didn't make too much of a mess, were very polite and didn't find any violations. Driving through Minnesota we went by a DNR station and were tempted to pull in voluntarily just to make the trip complete. We must have had that ""look"" about us.

575630,woods,2008-06-30 12:24:00,646,"The last two years, the US border people seem to be so concerned about the fish we have, do they have skin showing, and how are they packaged. This year, they even looked at them in our coolers. I am curious why the US is so concerned about the fish we are bringing back from Canada, especially since we usually have a game warden check while in Canada. Anybody know?"
575631,nicko,2008-06-30 12:41:00,508,"Just went through Baudette. Nobody checked anything. Canada checked nothing on boat or trailer, US did no fish checks, only made us pull the tarp on one side of the boat and did no other bag, bait or cooler checks. During our trip to LOTW, we saw no MNR staff all week, no checks along highway either. Maybe we just got lucky....."
575633,Guest,2008-06-30 12:51:00,0,"we've never had anyone at the border ever ask any questions about fish we are bringing back,if indeed we even bring any back. We've been going to Cananda several times a year for the past 15 years or so."
575634,Guest,2008-06-30 13:10:00,0,"We told the customs officer that we had our limit of fish, gave him our pasports and we were on our way. No checks of any kind."
575635,Guest,2008-06-30 13:29:00,0,Hi. only a couple of times were the US border guys interested in fish and how many. I think that was for personal info so they would know if they should go up for a week of fishing.
575636,Muskygary,2008-06-30 13:38:00,137,"Several years ago; coming back from Rice Lake through Detroit the Candian side asked us if we were bring back fish. I said yes we had some walleyes. He said ""If you have limits I have to count fish"" I said we don't have our limits. He replied ""Good go ahead"". Had a good laugh over that one. (WE really only had four legal walleyes for a grandfather back home.)"
575638,2746,2008-06-30 13:57:00,3206,"We were checked last year and were traveling in two vehicles. We had all our fish in one cooler (dry ice) and in one vehicle which is a no no. They gave us a lecture about that and sent us on our way. We understood we had made an error and I'm not faulting them for pointing it out but, like you, we wondered why they would have any interest in fish caught in Canada."
575646,Guest,2008-06-30 17:16:00,0,Came through Manitoba south of Winnepeg June 14 and all three vehicles had to show fish in the coolers.
575654,Nimstug,2008-06-30 21:09:00,2605,"The son and I were checked at I.F. last year, but it was not the U.S. people doing the checking. The Park Service (?) guys were just there to help direct traffic. Talked to a nice Park Service guy while Jeff dealt with ODNR. Anticipating being checked, we put all the fish in one cooler to make it easy. The ODNR people went through everything in the back of the Blazer to be sure we didn't have fish stashed in with our clothes, the boat box, or under the seats. They thanked us. We thanked them and were on our way. Cost us maybe 10 minutes. Nimstug Any team can have a bad century. -J. Brickhouse"
575675,Guest,2008-07-01 12:57:00,0,We cross at Baudette 5-7 times per year. Last trip through on 6/22 was the first time in recent memory that our fish were not checked! They advise to keep your coolers at the rear of the vehicle for easy access. They also always make us untarp a corner of the boat so they can look inside.
