575814,Guest,2008-07-06 12:27:00,0,"Ok, that's the island we were told was called First Island. So where is Stevenson's Point that everyone is talking about in previous posts??? and Fisherman's Point? one and the same??? We can use the Golden Hook Map is reference."
575815,Guest,2008-07-06 14:05:00,0,Fishermans point is across from 3 sisters and is the point with the island beside it. Stevenson's point is the point that you will find if you come out of gullrock bay(where golden hook camp is) keep to the left hand shore and follow it around until it hooks into the opening of the main lake. (kind of looks like a bottle opener on the map)
575822,Guest,2008-07-06 20:42:00,0,"Okay.......now this is all starting to make sense. We have only been fishing the Rock for 7 years and all of these spots have nicknames depending on who you talk to and where you stay. Yes, we have caught fish on all of these spots, just know them by different names. Thanks for the clarification!!!"
575733,Guest,2008-07-03 09:10:00,0,Haven't seen any Gull Rock reports for a while. Are the mayflies finished?
575738,dirt,2008-07-03 12:26:00,144,"Fished the Rock from June 21st through the 27th. Had our best year ever. We basically found walleye almost everywhere we fished. didn´t see any mayflies yet - water temps were around the mid 60´s. We caught a lot of walleye around weeds - if we found weeds, we found walleye. Bait didn´t seem to matter. Minnows, worms, Gulp leeches and worms even worked. Biggest walleye of the trip was 29"" Like I said - I think it was the best trip we ever had up there. Can´t wait to go back."

575749,Guest,2008-07-03 20:11:00,0,"I went out for 2 hours yesterday, and wasted one of them by the mouth of the river coming in from Keg, just got 1 little sauger, then I moved to round island. it was windier than a son of a gun so I went to the lea side and fished and area about 25yards square, just jigging and pulled up about 20 in an hour.So I would say the fishing is really good. I'm sure that if I went to the windy side I would have done better."
575753,Guest,2008-07-03 22:08:00,0,Where is Round Island???? This is a new name for me.
575767,Guest,2008-07-04 11:54:00,0,this island is directly across from the bay that is between the end of the boot and the next point.
575783,Guest,2008-07-04 22:35:00,0,We call that Burnt Island....burnt in the mid 70s.
575797,Guest,2008-07-05 14:33:00,0,Burnt island is off the toe of the boot. the Island I'm talking about is on the opposite shore of the lake
575798,Guest,2008-07-05 14:39:00,0,"I was out this morning, the wind was blowing and the waves were rolling. I used my last 3 minnows in 5 minutes butonly got 3 small walleye. then I switched to gulp alive and had a 4"" minnow on. I got a 15 inch walleye in 1 drift over the flats off the clay banks. I tried a second drift and got nothing, so I switched to a gulp alive 3 inch leech on a floating jig. I got (in one drift over the same area) 8 more walleye, the largest being 24"" I was impressed how well the leeches worked."
575802,Guest,2008-07-05 20:18:00,0,"http://www.goldenhookcamp.com/lakemap.html Guys, On this map burnt island is towards ""the wall"" and I am guessing ""round island"" is under the ""G""? or is it the island that is fairly close to the rear of the northern going passed the point by the ""clay banks""?"
