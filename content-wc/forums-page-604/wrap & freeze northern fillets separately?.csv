Can we freeze each fillet in a separate bag, then keep the frozen fillets + bags together in the cooler in case we get checked on the way home? That way we can thaw only one fillet at a time when it is time to eat them. We would not do this with walleyes, only the big fillets from northerns. We know about keeping skin on etc. Thanks."
