575847,Guest,2008-07-07 17:33:00,0,FIshing would have been better if the indians havent harvested so many fish in the spring.

575640,Guest,2008-06-30 14:31:00,0,I meant - does anybody possibly know the Top 10 from the Classic this past weekend?
575653,Guest,2008-06-30 20:59:00,0,Hello Everyone. The 2008 Minaki Walleye Classic was a huge success! We had 50 teams which is largest turnout in 6 years! The weather was tough on Saturday but great on Sunday. There were 6 fish caught that were over the 70cm limit and lots of HUGE 35-45cm slot fish caught. Lots of comments on how great the fishing was. Many many fish caught between 24 and 27 inches that were immediately released. That slot limit is really showing it's success. Here is the top ten. 1st - Jim Martin/Jesse Hanson - 18.80 lbs 2nd - Clarke Barr/Wayne Palson - 18.77 lbs 3rd - Rich Loeb/Rob Scott - 17.65 lbs 4th - Jamie McLean/Jason McLean - 16.76 lbs 5th - Tony Shirley/Paul Marion - 14.71 lbs 6th - Roy Lemay/Terry Lemay - 14.51 lbs 7th - Larry Snow/Rees Snow - 14.26 lbs 8th - Clint Steele/Vaughn Doyle - 14.25 lbs 9th - Craig Stapon/Justin Stapon - 13.98 lbs 10th - Bob Duncan/Jason Wiebe - 13.44 lbs Thanks to everyone who came and all who helped out. It was fun! Full results and prize info will be posted on www.fishminaki.com by Thursday. J.P. Kennedy

Indians are from India."
575024,Guest,2008-06-13 10:04:00,0,We were in there on first ice off a few times and so far have done better then last year in Vermillion lake. but with all this rain it will be a sloppy. We used to fish sword years ago but we find the trout to be much bigger and a limit is easy to come by on Vermillion. I'm surprised you never ice fish Vermillion
575028,jpkennedy26,2008-06-13 10:55:00,14,I was never much of an ice fishing guy till this past year. I always spent so much time and money fishing the spring/summer/fall that I used the winter to save some money. I hear they get some big pike in Vermillion.
575029,Guest,2008-06-13 11:11:00,0,"5 years ago or so I landed a 48"" pike out of there. As well lots of mid 30"" in there as well. I never have gone after pike as a target in Vermillion but in spring there are lots of back bays that warm fast with creeks flowing in that would be worth trying if after a bruts"
575033,Guest,2008-06-13 12:44:00,0,Ever think that some of us don't want you ruining Canada with your tournaments? Minaki use to be a quiet place. Not everyone is happy you are doing this. We have a right to ask you not to bring big city life in our quiet little town. I dont want to hear the argument of bringing money here either. We dont need that kind of money.

Funny how not one person has ever asked me to stop doing this. Absolutely everyone I have talked to is excited about what I am doing. That includes cottagers, business owners and townspeople. Are you saying that the lodge owners don't need bookings? Or that the Bait shops don't need to sell bait? Perhaps I do not understand your concerns. What could they be? Fish mortality? Boat traffic? If you have concerns, please contact me. I would be happy to hear you out."
575042,Guest,2008-06-13 16:08:00,0,Catch & Release would be pretty tough when you're spearing walleyes. So no.
574999,Guest,2008-06-12 14:49:00,0,Not a tournament fisherman....just fishing for smallmouth. Thanks!
575001,Guest,2008-06-12 15:09:00,0,Lots of big smallmouth in big sand in 40 feet of water in august 3 4 lbers

575012,Guest,2008-06-13 07:41:00,0,The water is up and should keep rising rom all the new rain in the area. I'm not sure where it's at right now as we've been toward vermillion bay trout fishing lately
575014,Guest,2008-06-13 08:30:00,0,">Tony,.....what's the water level like this year......above, >below normal, rising or falling? Thanks, I'll be there >tomorrow. Water went up 11 inches last weekend. I bet its going up more with all the rain. Current is picking up big time. Most fish are shallow, hanging in or near the warm water bays. Lots of fish near the new weeds. I'll be up there fishing this weekend and will post a fishing report for anyone interested. I will be mostly targeting walleye. JP"
575015,Guest,2008-06-13 08:33:00,0,"I have never fished on Vermillion lake. How has it been this year? I fished Worth & Sword last weekend, did very well but mostly small fish in the 1 lb range with a few bigger. Natural Resources (MNR) was on Worth Lake doing some kind of survey I think. They were dragging some sort of line behind their small boat. JP"
575016,Guest,2008-06-13 08:49:00,0,">Lets all sing together > >SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM > >SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM I want to know why people like you feel the need to come on this thread and turn it into garbage. I am trying to organize a nice event for Minaki and people keep posting dumb crap in my threads. I would hardly call posting a thread 8 weeks after the last spam. I would have continued that thread, but some other guy decided to spoil that one too. All I am trying to do is make people aware that there is a nice walleye tournament in Minaki and that I am trying to make it grow. Now if you have a problem with that, don't post. Let the other people out there read a nice clean thread and spare them childish useless posts. Maybe people who do these things should get off their butts and volunteer in there communities or do something productive because they obviously have too much time on there hands. Maybe you should post using your real name. It's pretty easy to talk up a storm when you can hide behind your computer. I use mine and I'm easy to find so come talk to me if you have a problem."
