575684,Guest,2008-07-01 17:34:00,0,"bigredeye, what were you smoking when you posted that stuff about Lake Evans? There is no way you can get there without flying to go fishing. If what you say is true than I guess Great Bear Lake is available without flying from the river to the north. Good luck. What are you going to bring a tooth brush, 1 can of beer and a rod? Went there 3 weeks ago with Bushland and had a wonderful trip. 3 dozen pike over 40 in. with a 48 incher being the top fish. Couldn't believe the weight they allowed for a fly-in trip."
575849,deputy dog,2008-07-07 18:32:00,305,"just got back from lake evans sunday and had another great trip with numerous pike over 40"" largest being 44 1/2"". weather was horrible cold, wind, and rain every day with at least one cold front sat night into sunday. walleye were easy at the one foot falls and the caretaker was fantastic! even did our dishes. didn't see one other boat for the whole week contrary to what has been said. would highly recommend the lake and the outfitter for anyone looking for great fishing and great service. bugs were the worst we have seen in all of our trips north but still can't wait to get back!"
575868,pike50plus,2008-07-08 13:31:00,584,"Wow, the old owner is up to old tricks again, eh! D-Dog, I see DD is posting misinformation here about Evans, he just won't let go will he. I have the old web add he ran on internetoutpost site when he owned the camp, quit a different opnion of the lake then, eh? I canb put it up if anyone wants it, it had his old contact info and address tto! Evans is a great fishery, PERIOD!"
575885,pike50plus,2008-07-09 06:42:00,584,"Pike 777, did you fish out of Crow or Kirk? Jim's friend The Guide"
575902,Guest,2008-07-09 14:33:00,0,"Hey pike50plus, We went to Lake Evans in June and if anyone can show us a fishery that produces better than Evans for the price we'll go there. Stopped reading that crap a long time ago because it was the ranting of an idiot. The caretaker was the best ever in all our trips to Canada."
575912,pike50plus,2008-07-09 19:12:00,584,"777, I have fished Evans SWB 10+ yrs ago and know all parties that were infolved , Known Jim the longest and trust him the most! Just booked Kirk for 1st week August next year. I just wondered which camp you were at becuase the others guys who were at Crow early did really welll too!"

574636,deputy dog,2008-06-03 19:24:00,305,"how much farther north is that than evans? have you been there before, any luck?"
574659,Guest,2008-06-04 13:17:00,0,I read somewhere that Lac Evans now has road access? Do you guys know if there is any truth to this. I would love to get in there. How much do they charge for 1 week? Thanks
574660,deputy dog,2008-06-04 13:41:00,305,"contrary to rumors there is no road access to lake evans, the price for one week at evans is $1950 per person. check our bushlandadventures.com for more info on evans."

How much do they charge for 1 week? Thanks my group just got back from goeland lake north of matagami (drive in) cheap do it your self trip, dirt road. a few 15 pound pike, ok walleye. with gas prices it still cost us over 1000 in fuel, but it is the fun of being in the bush and on the water.. heard from town people that you take dirt road near K116 , off pave road past gate. that leads you into lake evans. they also said there is another road into dana lake that goes into evans, but did not know kilometer where road was yet. you can fish evans for free according to game wardens we saw."
574685,Guest,2008-06-05 06:54:00,0,this is a 100% false rumor started by the x owner of the permits on Evans. the camps are set up and running beautifuly as we speak. there are no access roads. Please call bushland adventures 866-359-2874 for the truth. thanks
574686,Guest,2008-06-05 06:59:00,0,what did you take a bus? Hi Dave and Greg.
575346,Guest,2008-06-23 07:25:00,0,">what did you take a bus? > > we did not know that a bus into lake evans, where does it leave from? we heard there are canoe trips from the broadback river into evans and then they pick youo up by bus along the james bay road. is that what you mean. have you been on them? thank you."
575682,Guest,2008-07-01 17:21:00,0,"We had gone to Lake Evans for years and had our greatest pike fishing trips in memory there. Then the outfitter became unprofessional and eventually went broke because they lied to the clients and obviously didn't know how to deal with people. He cheated our group and cost us thousands by not refunding the trip they did not produce. We hear now that a new company is running the lake and an honest business, which is good news for all pike fishing anglers. The old owner has surfaced all over the internet spreading more lies about the lake that they claimed was a top 5 Pike fishery in all of North America. We have talked to many people who have gone to Lake Evans this season with Bushland Adventures and they couldn't be happier. They said the fishing was stronger than ever and the staff is light years ahead of the old bankrupt owner. I have read where he is trying to tell people they can get into Lake Evans by road and other nonsense. For everybody's sake please don't buy into these lies because he doesn't care who he hurts or costs money because it isn't his. He must really miss the lake to be so obsessed with it"
