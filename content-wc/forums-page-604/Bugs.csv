575856,Guest,2008-07-07 21:54:00,0,We go to Gull Rock the second week in August and want to know how to stop no see ums from coming thru the screens in the camper. Any cures?? Ma-lady is allergic to insect bites so fixing this would be a plus for me. mike
575859,Jimmy Jig,2008-07-08 08:40:00,1905,Best way is to close all windows about 5:00 PM and don't open until dark.

Your screens are probably some type of plastic, so you may want to test a small area to make sure it doesn't damage the screens. I've been to Canada many times in June, and always had noseeums, but when I've gone in July and August, I can't recall having problems with them. I always thought it was more of a June thing."
575877,Guest,2008-07-08 18:40:00,0,You can buy noseeum proof screen cheaply. It can easilly be attached over the existing screen with velcro stickies. I did this for years with our camper. Good luck

575891,Guest,2008-07-09 09:10:00,0,Wow..If you did that in Lac des Mille Lacs area you would need a blood transfusion. Worst year I've seen in over 20. Wet fall and spring.
