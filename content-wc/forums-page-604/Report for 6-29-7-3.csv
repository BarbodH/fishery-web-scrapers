575796,clemento,2008-07-05 14:07:00,48,Just returned from a fly-in to Hooker Lake with Hidden Bay Lodge in Sioux Lookout. Fishing was great. Lots of 20-24 inch walleye and lots of smaller ones also. Most caught in 10-15 feet of water. I agree with other posts about things running a little late. Water temp was 63 and very little weed growth. Floating jigs seemed to do a little better than bottom jigs thisyear. Can't wait till next year. Hope I can afford to go as my oldest starts college next year and that may take away my Canada money. Thanks Canada for making your wonderful resources available to me. It is my favorite place in this world to vacation.
