The current owners have made the decision to tear down the old cabins and put up luxury log cabins and swith it over to a time share place. While I agree that the owner has the option to what they need to do to make money it really changed our vacation plans this year. Luckily my friend was able to purchase a cabin on the same lake late last year and we have been up there a few times fixing up the place. We go up next week to do some final major work for the weekend before our annual family fishing vacation the first week in august. Looking forward to getting away for a week of fishing. Even with the higher gas prices this year we are still planning on going and having fun fishing, water tubing and running around the lake just like we have done for more that 30 years."
