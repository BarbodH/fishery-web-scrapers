Expecting our first baby at any time so did not want to leave before because of so much to do and am not going to leave after so that means I am not going this year. However, I can get on this board and read all the posts about fishing, travel, food, etc.... and sit back and think of memories and put myself in your place and be right there fishing. Alot of places you have gone--i have been there or traveled the same roads or stayed in the same area or hotels that have been talked about. I am taking my canada trip pretty much through you guys this year. I miss it like crazy and wish i was going to be on that canadian lake and with friends and also around the always great canadians! thanks. I am glad I will have a new fishing buddy pretty soon though!!"

I am leaving for Caribou Lake(Forrest Lodge) near Armstong in nine days with three buddies, my dad and brother. I only get to Canada every other year because of work so this is my year to revel in God's country and all those eyes waiting for my line. I will bring one in the boat for you. Congratulations and good luck with the new addition to your family!"
566779,Guest,2007-06-28 14:42:00,0,It is posts and people like you that make fishing and canada special and why I am on this board all the time. Thanks for fishing for me.
566785,Guest,2007-06-28 18:40:00,0,"Thank you for your post! it was short, sweet and too the point.. Sure people gripe about the price of gas, the exchange rate etc.. But in the end it is about the experience of just being here! How can you put a price tag on life long memories?!? I am glad you enjoy our fair country and am sorry you cant make this year... but heck man.. your about to experience one of lives greatest pleasures (other then fishing).. fatherhood!.. I wish you and the wife all the best.. I am 1000000% positive (s)he will be a keeper... (even if there is a slot limit) LOL Awesome news brother! A Canuck"

566797,Guest,2007-06-29 09:05:00,0,"CONGRATULATIONS!!! It is nice to see that your priorities are in the right place. Another thing that may help is a trip to your local tackle store for a spiderman or spongebob rod/reel? We just got back from LOTW a couple weeks ago and had a good trip. The highlight for us was getting in on some good crappie fishing. The nice thing about our trip is I get to experience it with my father. The bass,northern,walleye etc were about the same with the biggest change was the low water levels this year but it showed us some more places for next year!!! What lake(s) do you normally fish and what do you normally fish for?"
566800,Guest,2007-06-29 09:28:00,0,"thanks for all the kind words. I started going when i was 7 with dad and grandpa(both have passed on) We went to north star lodge on clay lake for like 4 years. Still the biggest northern I have caught was my first year there in macintosh bay. It was like 12 pounds on my zebco 33 baby! We have been to paskakogan(?), indian chain, gullrock and a few fly ins through women river. We are walleye fishing for sure. Thr drive through northern minnesota and through canada never gets old no many how many times i have done it. the excitment and the scenery is awesome. Getting into your cabin for the week and getting settled in and unpacking. getting the gear ready for the boats and finally heading across the lake. Coming back for dinner and looking over the map with friends and talking about where to go next. Playing cards and sipping drinks. great times. there is no price tag for that!"
566807,skindzier,2007-06-29 13:02:00,137,"Congrats! It won't be long... My 11 year old daughter has been going up since 2004. For that trip we got her fishing hat - We've been getting her a pewter stick pin of each species she's caught since to put on the hat. The hat's getting pretty heavy! So far she's got a northern, bass (LM & SM), walleye, rainbow trout, lake trout & brown trout (we haven't gotten her pins for panfish - sticking just to gamefish). I've bought her a muskie pin - she's hoping to get that this year :) We're leaving a week from Thursday - spending 3 1/2 days on Eagle Lake for muskies & smallmouth and 4 days on Lac Seul for walleyes. I'm already watching the clock!"
566808,2746,2007-06-29 14:03:00,3206,"Wishin, there is a poll on the general discussion board checking out the ages of those that fish Canada. Only about 15% of the respondents are under 37.......that makes you a rarity (sp?)"
