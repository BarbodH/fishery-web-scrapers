We were up there a few years ago and did real well with the Blakemore Malibu jigs with the small blade. Of course everything changes with the condition of the weather. Our group used to go to northern Wisconsin but switch to Canada in 2003. The drive is worth it. Not only the fishing but the awesome scenery and wildlife. We're pretty much walleye fisherman but love jumbo perch too. We release all bass, northerns, muskies and trophy walleye. We get enough for supper and we're happy. Actually, that's the only time my dad, son and myself fish during the year. You never know when it's your last trip together so we make the most of it. To everyone.........tight lines and friendships.......plus memories that last forever."
