I am wondering about water levels and the condition of the 170 miles of gravel road from St. Michael to Walleye Point. This will be our third trip to the Gouin and we always had a great time there, Walleye are not giants but plentiful."

Luckily there were a couple of posts this week - the road is in good shape. Have a great trip!
