Not bad to have on hand because the doctors, EMTs may not have them. The bolt cutters vary in quality. You can buy an inexpensive one from Menards."
567031,fire105,2007-07-05 20:06:00,40,"think about using a cable cutter. the cost is around 25 bucks. used them working with garage door removale, cutting through 1/2 inch cable is a snap. they have a thin small point so you can get into had to reach places."

Don't remember what it's made of, but it burns HOT. I've used it at home to see how it works. It's great. I guess some dry tinder would be good too, those cotton balls soaked in vaseline sound like a good idea."
565928,Guest,2007-06-04 12:03:00,0,"The silver metal is a magnesium bar, you scrape it with a knife to make filings, and it will burn very hot when hit with the sparker. It will burn hot enough to catch even wet kindling on fire."

566684,Guest,2007-06-26 13:04:00,0,"You know i have been going to canada for almost 25 years and have never thought of any of these things??? I have been on fly ins and even our own canoe trips to nowhere. Reading this post has changed my mind that I might want to get me a little survivor pack together and that maybe I have been very lucky not to have been in a ""survival"" situation. Once again I have learned from this website."

566893,Guest,2007-07-02 14:24:00,0,"This may not be the exact spot to offer my suggestion, but a hook remover is a must with me. I've been going to fly-ins and outposts for 30 years now. Just got back last night to be exact. Needed one 5-6 years ago for a buddy that had a hook in his thumb and this year ended up with a treble hook buried in the palm of my hand. The kits are cheap, work great, don't take up room in a tackle box, and I was amazed that the entire process was pretty ""pain free"". Good luck to all on the water. dcrum"
566926,Jazzy Lu,2007-07-03 08:30:00,11,"ALWAYS have a strong wire cutter in the boat . If someone gets a treble hook in the hand with a good sized muskie also attached it is good to be able to cut the treble!!! Unfortunately, I am talking from experience. It was my muskie. Regarding maps: check out google satellite maps of any lake. Sometimes the satelites update it in early spring/late winter. With the melting started it is easy to see where the actual flow of water is in the lake or incoming rivers. It also shows some structure. Pretty handy to study before hitting new waters and puts a new perspective on familiar water."

564208,Nimstug,2007-03-31 21:08:00,2605,"While preparing for our last trip to Canada, I got thinking about ""what ifs"", such as what if something happened to the motor and we couldn't get back before dark. I made sure we had a good working flashlight, a gps, a compass, small wax soaked rolls of newspaper (I think Scouts call them firebugs), strike anywhere matches, and a butane lighter. My son and I each had sweatshirts to ward off the morning cold and rain wear, so that would have been of some help. Now I'm thinking about this year's trip. So I was wondering, what do you bring along in your boats for emergency use? This would be equipment beyond the usual stuff required by law, such as life vests, horn or whistle, etc. Space in the boat could be an issue as I think many of us use a camp boat which is typically a 16'er with little or no storage. Thanks for your thoughts. Nimstug When I Grow Up, I Want to be a Little Boy"
564210,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-03-31 21:54:00,80,"My friend takes along a small tarp and some clothesline in case he's stranded on shore and has to make a lean to. He also takes along a small ditty bag with energy bars, aspirin etc.. He also has a first aid kit. If I think of any more I'll let you know. Joe"
564211,Guest,2007-03-31 22:00:00,0,"About 6 years ago me, my wife, and my aunt and uncle spent a week in the Boundary Waters. We were 15 lakes back at one point. Came home and everything was fun. Two weeks later he was mowing his lawn in a Chicago burb and got stung by a bee, and dropped. Had he not been 3 minutes from a hospital he would have been dead. If someone in your group is away that they have an allergic reaction to bees or anything else, then an EPI-PEN is a necessity. Simple, small, and will save a life!!!!!!!!"
564218,dollure,2007-04-01 12:02:00,71,"Besides equipment listed my son and I take 2 of those silver space age blankets, a small air horn with a couple of refills, and roadside flares. Also take canned food that can be opened without a can opener. Roy"
564219,Mondo_OH,2007-04-01 13:24:00,58,"Do a ""search"" on Field & Stream, they have had some great articles on this in the past last year or so, showing you ALL kinds of options."
564231,IaDave,2007-04-02 09:59:00,476,"Great ideas. On a fly-in we were stranded on shore because of motor problems for 8 hours. Not fun,couldn't even fish. After that day we talked about what we could have done different and decided to stick together more and if you go off by yourself have a plan to meet at a certain time. We had 2 way radios but I don't think they work the best up there as we were 10 miles from the cabin."
564236,Guest,2007-04-02 14:09:00,0,"I probably keep way more stuff on my boat than I need, but here are a couple ideas that'll work with camp boats as well - you have to stay warm, and out of the weather for an unplanned overnight. You can survive hunger, but wet, cold, no shelter, might be more problematic. A tarp to make a lean-to or tent, as the occasion requires, and a little cord, was mentioned by someone else, and a couple space-blankets. A few candles - you can hold one of those for a long time under wet needles/branches to get a fire going. And dip the tip of your strike-anywhere matches in nail polish to make them very water-resistant, and THEN put them in a waterproof container. A saw - I carry a sven saw on the boat, but you can also get the wire saws, kind of a wire coil with a couple metal bars at each end to hang on to. Might find them in the camping section at the sporting goods store. You can do lightweight woodcutting as needed with them. A couple led flashlights and spare batteries. You can get the very compact ones that use the 3v lithium batteries - with led's, they last quite a long time. Two flashlights makes it a pretty good bet that you'll have at least one that works. A small siphon hose to get gas out of your tank. It'll burn real well...."
564601,Grappler,2007-04-17 10:53:00,47,"I agree with the epi-pen as I am allergic to fish. Go figure, Love to catch em but can't eat em... Along with the epi-pen, I always have brought these, and is a good thing as last year one of our guys had to use it, is allergy medication such as Benedryl. Helps in case of hives, and other kind of allergies that may pop up, and are easy to store in the boat/tackle box. Also, one of those insect bite sticks to put on mosquito bites."
565227,Guest,2007-05-13 19:50:00,0,A good and compact fire starter is cotton balls dipped in Vaseline. Keep them in a small prescription or medicine bottle. They work great even in the wettest weather.
