567055,jfrealty,2007-07-06 15:29:00,7,Anyone taken highway 594 off of 502 to Eagle River then to Vermillun Bay? If so is it hard surface and faster then going to dryden?
567062,wooglin,2007-07-06 19:07:00,371,"Actually we took 594 to and from Ear Falls...the roads are a bit scary when you see them as they're one lane, curvey and sometimes gravel - HOWEVER, you see some great scenery, some small towns and it is indeed faster. I asked a gas station attendent in Vermillion if 594 is faster and she said its a quicker route than going through Dryden. Take it, it's pretty fun actually."
567063,wooglin,2007-07-06 19:12:00,371,"PS, when I say scary, I mean 'not your typical HWY through Canada' and not 'like riding through South Central LA'. The roads are fine and the scenery is pretty nice....I'd suggest it for anyone heading that way that doesn't need to stop in Dryden."
567064,dave10,2007-07-06 20:59:00,342,wooglin - isn't 594 all rutted and patched? I had heard that the poor condition made it a bad choice. Thanks. Dave
