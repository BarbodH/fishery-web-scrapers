This is about a month earlier than we usually go, so we were wondering how the lake levels are, and if we're going to have to drastically alter our strategy. We're also wondering if we're going to be hit with a lot more bugs this year than we usually get. Thanks in adavance."
567030,Guest,2007-07-05 18:02:00,0,I was there two weeks ago but the wind was so strong four out of the five days we were there that we were really limited in the areas we could travel to safely. We still caught fish but it was much more difficult than years past and less comfortable having to wear rain suits and getting doused with waves while jigging. We still had a good time but it is fun to get out and try new spots. Water was a little dirty due to all of the rain. Casting the shallows for northern and bass had very minimal results. We caught some bass while jigging for walleye and bigger northern trolling for walleye. Water is back up to normal after the rain that came the week before we were there. I am sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
