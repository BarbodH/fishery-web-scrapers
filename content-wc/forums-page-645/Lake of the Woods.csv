Jig fishing on the reef or extended point is what to do and in this area there are to many of those to count. Get a topo map and and look for the reefs. I will be in this area next week. Good luck"
566979,Guest,2007-07-04 09:27:00,0,Hoffy - any reports when you get back would be appreciated. I am looking forward to getting on some new water (although there sure is a lot of it). Good luck.

Am staying at Tomahawk Resort out of Sioux Narrows, and just wondering if anyone has been fishing up there and what kind of success they had. I plan to fish both smallies and walleyes. What kind of depth and baits where working the best? have heard that you do have to travel some distance for walleyes, what areas are they fishing?"
566999,Guest,2007-07-04 21:09:00,0,"Been there 4 times this year. Fishing has been great. May flys slowed it down last week or so, but our luck in July has always been good. As the other wise gentleman stated, talk to Rick Gate. It would be worth your wile to hire him as he has guided the area for many years. Kevin the guide or Rob at the dock will also try to help you find fish. Miles bay reefs and deep island drop offs as well as reefs out west are the best bet. Many of us move from reef to reef with 3/8 or 1/2oz. jigs with minnows. Check out the big fish list at BVR web site. Many of the people actually state where they catch fish(or at least a general area)http://www.buenavistaresort.com/bigfishlist.html Must have Nav maps of area (BVR usually has them) or get a guide for sure. Check out Rick's BVR daily journal. Lot's of great pictures and Rick tells how fishing is sometimes. Might be there at same time. You will love the area and the people at BVR!"
