Any updates on he water/fishing conditions would be appreciated. Primarily going for Muskie, Smallmouth and Pike. Also, If anyone is aware of a responsibly priced and clean private cottage for rent for four poeple in the area north of Ash Rapids please let me know. Three more days! Thanks in advance.
