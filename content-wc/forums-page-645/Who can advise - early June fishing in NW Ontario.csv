564751,Guest,2007-04-26 12:30:00,0,"I'm breaking new ground this year by fishing the second week of June. We have a small lake completely to ourselves for a week that only gets fished about half or less of the season, so I'm pretty excited. Will have some portage lake opportunities to lakes that get even less pressure. Lakes are stained, and I believe relatively shallow (i.e., not trout lakes, probably top out at 30-40 ft depths). I picked early June in part because it will give me a better shot at a 40"" northern, which I've never got before. But, all my trips going back to 1979 have been between the fourth week of June and the second week of August. So my question is, for a pair of anglers dialed into mid-summer patterns for walleye, bass and pike, what should we expect to be different, look to do differently? The main thing I've picked up are to key on dark bottomed bays/warmer water, especially for walleyes. Is it too early to troll with spinners/crankbaits? Minnows aren't really desireable for us, but is it too early for crawlers/leeches? What should we be looking for? Any and all thoughts welcome and greatly appreciated. I posted the same question a couple months back, but couldn't find it, and was hoping now that the season's closer and the board's more active, a few others might care to weigh in."

I will start by saying the obvious that it depends on the weather/water temp(I know that is obvious but true). Walleyes(I'm not a walleye fisherman) we catch our limits every year simply fishing a jig/minnow pitching in the deep edge of the weeds(4-5'). Pretty easy to catch. I read a lot about the different techniques but that is what we do. We used a native guide a couple times and he used a jig/minnow and fished deeper on mud bottoms in 22-23' Pike: we catch on spinnerbaits,rattletraps in the backs of coves in the weedbeds or reeds. Bass: small round rocks. we catch them on 1/4oz spinnerbaits,crawdad colored crankbaits(normans perch colored in gelcoat)tubes,rattletraps but the key is round rocks.usually from the surface to 10'. Muskies we catch accidentally while fishing for other species. we fish LOTW. If you want more specific info I send me your email and I can get you more specific stuff. The other thing I am hearing lots about this year is low water levels so be careful. The other thing I think is important(I am fron Indiana) is to keep in mind that fish in the north are not as effected by cold water and cold fronts. good luck and enjoy your trip."
564757,Mr. Walleye,2007-04-26 15:49:00,74,"We've gone for many years the 2nd or 3rd week of June with great success. We almost exclusively target walleye, but manage to accidentally catch some nice pike (35-45"") as well. We start by looking for points, bays, shorelines, weedbeds, etc. with the wind blowing IN. That time of year we almost always get most of our fish in 7-12 feet of water. Trolling crankbaits like shad raps, rattle traps, etc. works well especially when we want to cover water and find fish. Once we find them, we vertical jig and drift or back troll. Three or 4 inch twister tails on 1/4 oz. jigs are usually all we need, however I like to replace the twister with half a crawler if they are a little finicky. We've never had to mess with bottom bouncers, lindy rigs, etc. on the lake we fly in to. Hope this helps!"

564768,Guest,2007-04-27 07:07:00,0,"We go the first week in June, out of Nakina. Walleye we use jigs and 3"" twister tails and for pike Johnson silver minnows with twister tails. Also use minnow type baits for trolling. Walleye caught near incoming streams and off rocky islands. Pike in the heaviest weeds/reeds you can find. Good luck.:popcorn:"
564779,Grappler,2007-04-27 13:59:00,47,"We have been fishing this time for the last 8 years. Agree with all that the others have said already. We have had luck with all of that. I will add this: Walleye--The most inhospitable place for human beings on the the lake!! If you are uncomfortable, the fish will be biting there. Also, weeds, and structure WITH WIND are the spots. Leeches, nightcrawlers on rigs, hook/splitshot/leech, trolling crankbaits along the deep edges of reefs, casting cranks (#5 Rapala GSR Citrus) Shad bodies on jigs, color varies according to weather, water, temp, etc Northern--almost anything this time. Smaller bucktails, and spoons, tube baits and other jerk baits, esp x-raps Bass--Same as Northern, esp the tubes/xraps Hope that helps...Good Luck"
564782,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-04-27 16:15:00,80,"Can't add much to what has already been posted. Last year was my first trip. We had good sucess for walleyes using leeches on a #6 or #8 hook, with 6# line and as small a split shot as you can. Gonna target more smallmouth this year. Quite a few people have said tubes work well. Did okay last year but didn't get to go for smallies much. A color that is supposed to be good is pumpkinseed or ""puke"". Light tan/brown and orange with black flecks. We're also going to try senkos rigged wacky style. Basic black and red shad. What lake are going to? We're headed to Dogtooth the same week. Grappler is at the same lake the week before. Good Luck, Joe"
564797,Guest,2007-04-28 09:04:00,0,"Thanks for all the words of wisdom. Looking forward to it now more than ever, and the challenge of trying some new/different things with a better shot at some bigger fish. For those that asked, this is about the unsexiest trip you can imagine. We're going to a small lake called Moosetrack (""Miserable"" is the French name I've seen on a couple maps, hope it's not an omen) about 5-7 miles west of Lac Des Mille Lacs in Northern Ontario. There's only one cabin on the lake, and access outside of a floatplane is inconvenient, at best, so we'll almost certainly have the place completely to ourselves. So what it lacks in degrees north latitude, I hope it makes up for in seclusion and low fishing pressure. The lake has pike, walleye, and a few bass, and the fishing has allegedly been very good there the last couple years. There's a couple portage lake options as well. The outfitter is Wilderness Outfitters out of Ely, Mn. We've had a fairly long relationship with them going back to our Boundary Waters/Quetico days."
