Your left hand is covered in blood and scales and the right hand hand is alternating between holding the fillet knife or a can of Labatt's. Suddenly these yellowish bees(?) start flying all over you, your fish and inside your gut bucket. You don't want to swat them for fear of stabbing yourself or spilling your beer -- so you just tough it out (After all, you are in the bush up in the Woodland Caribou Provencial park and don't want to appear to be a wuss). The questions I have are: 1. What are they; Sweat bees? Yellow jackets? 2. What is it about fish guts that attract them. Some guys have said that one's own sweat (salt) attracts them. 3. Has anyone tried using some of those yellow jacket traps to keep their numbers down?"

567004,Moss,2007-07-04 22:08:00,7,I see a lot of bees with white stripes when I am out bear baiting. Those nasty little creatures eat meat. They have a mean bite. Setting some fish skeletons off to the side should help combat some of them. Good luck.
