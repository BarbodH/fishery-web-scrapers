566844,wooglin,2007-06-30 21:00:00,371,"I've been home for about 24 hours and still have a bit of the sea-legs. We stayed at Gold Pines Camp from 6/23-6/29, fishing 6 days. We've never fished this section of the lake before, all 4 years prior being out of Hudson/Sioux Lookout area. The fishing was great; on the week I'd say that our two boats caught over 250-300 fish total, and we're proud to say that we netted 16 'overs', biggest being a 27"" walleye (still swimming today). I could tell the water was still down 2-3 feet, maybe more. We used our GPS religously every day, which turned out to be a great asset when traveling by boat in heavy winds/rains and we couldn't see rock markers. Pike fishing seemed a bit tough to come by, anything caught was typically on accident via jigging, or just by casting into shallow warm bays. Biggest pikes were 30.5 and two 29.5's. Most walleye were caught in 8 FOW or less, sometimes in 2-3 FOW jigging into the sand/mud transitions. Bait of choice for us was crawlers, leeches seemed to hit or miss, but the pike seemed to love them. Weather was so-so. We had a few nice storms roll through (Monday night was bad, downed trees all along 105), Tuesday being absolutely miserable on the water, where we had to go 8 MPH from Steamboat Narrows back to camp, with probably 4-5 foot rollers on the lake. The night prior came through a cold-front, which turned the fish off. The last day we fished (Thursday), it was blue skies and warm weather and the fish were hot! We netted about 10 'overs' that last day alone. Gold Pines camp was great. It was nice to be on the water where we could just get up and go. The camp owners were great; there to send you off and there to greet you when you got back to camp. What I didn't like about that part of the lake was the amount of people. The mouth of the river (into the Sanctuary), was just loaded with boats. We saw sometimes 12 boats in about a football fields amount of area....somewhat disappointing, considering I love the seclusion of fishing in Canada. We did however pull a tube through there mid-day; it was quite amusing. :) Overall the trip was great. We were able to see some moose on the way out, and one of our boats saw a mother/calf moose on the beach. The deer seem to be plentiful in the northwoods as well. PS, 594 route bypassing Dryden was interesting, but nonetheless a great ride. Lots of deer, we were about 10 feet from hitting a deer on this road. We also saw a blind man walking right down the road as we drove through, it was kind of sad. PSS, we saw a MNR fish check on the way in, stopping each car at a pulp-check. On the way home, we heard on the radio that they stopped 1,100 vehicles (yes, eleven hundred), and only 10 (yes TEN) tickets were issued, and only 40 warnings issued. Keep up the good work guys! Later!"
566850,Guest,2007-07-01 05:17:00,0,"Great to hear you had a good trip to lacseul. There is a reason 12 boats were at the mouth of the wenasaga, there are LOTS of fish and an easy boat ride from several camps. The area is protected until the 15th of June. Probably the only spot you'll see a concentration of boats other than maybe steamboat in July and under the ole railroad bridge in the fall. Best thing about the NW corner of lacseul is the short distance you have to travel for fish. pat"
566852,wooglin,2007-07-01 07:56:00,371,"Right on Pat, that is a true true statement. All of our pigs, with the exception of three, were caught at the mouth of the river. A 24.5'er was caught on a spinner bait in 4 FOW up river between the mouth and the rapids in the stumps. The other two pigs were caught down in steamboat....."
566864,Guest,2007-07-01 19:40:00,0,"Wooglin, did you fish around any of the small islands between Goose Island and Sand Point or did you just head right to Steamboat? Last year was our 1st year on LS, and we never saw any reason to travel any farther than Lunker and Sand Points because we were catching fish(lots of 14""-17"" fish with a few over 20"" per day). However, LOTS & LOTS of boats blew by us heading for Steamboat, which makes us wonder if that area produces more ""big fish"". Also, what live bait worked best? Minnows, crawlers or leeches? Thanks for the report!!"
566867,wooglin,2007-07-01 20:29:00,371,"Great questions. We didn't really fish much between the river (sancutary) and Steamboat, we just blew past the boats and we directly to Steamboat. My thoughts are that we were a bit early in the season to fish Steamboat, however, it did produce for us (not like the river though). I did see quite a few boats out in what I thought was deep water, but was actually mid-lake reefs on the way to Steamboat, where the water went from like 50 FOW to 12 FOW in very little time....we never stopped though, just kept going. We did hammer Lunker Point for quite some time with zero results. We did see quite a few boats there when we were fishing it, but we couldn't get much out of there.... Crawlers worked great for us, followed by leeches. The other boat tried minnows, and had no better results with them than they did crawlers. Good luck!"
566889,Guest,2007-07-02 12:13:00,0,"Nice to see a thread for the NW section of LS!! We arrive for our 5th year out of Golden Eagle Lodge on the 6th. Our first year there was in late August (did okay), but have been going early-mid July since. Since my father-in-law is somewhat hyper-active, we (seemingly) have fished most rock piles, points, reefs, etc in the NW section. We try not to fish Wenasaga due the crowding, but have caught some nice fish (25"") up the river. Lunker point can be okay, but it has such a steep drop off that we don't fish it unless there is very little wind. There are some points near there that we prefer. Those small islands, rock points from Goose Island to Steamboat can be very good depending on wind. I've personnally had three 26"" fish from different reefs/islands over the years, so I can't complain! To be honest, we've had our best days in and around Steamboat. The channel is good, but crowded. We like working the shoreline/points, mostly with jigs minnows/worms. I think you might need to go futher if you want to catch consistently bigger fish. We've gone down through Manitou (sp?) point and have done well, it's just uses alot of gas and the time. Best of luck inthe future!"
566909,wooglin,2007-07-02 19:49:00,371,"We did take a bit of a trip to the Shanty Narrows and it was really shallow for our boat, we actually beached it on a sandy reef. We picked one or two dinks up down there, but nothing too hot. We never did see the bi dropoff around Lunker Point, but then again, maybe thats where the other boats were (on the East side of Lunker Point). Thanks again, fish hard!"
566911,Guest,2007-07-02 19:58:00,0,"I agree that Lunker Pt. wasn't as good as a number of other small islands/reefs between Goose and Sand Island for us last year, but what type of structure does Steamboat Narrows/Bay have that produces bigger fish? Also, since we saw almost everybody else go towards Steamboat, how crowded does that area get? Thanks for the info!!"
566924,Guest,2007-07-03 07:11:00,0,"Almost due south of Lunker's point it drops to 80 ft or more and it drops very quickly. Our resort owner normally marks it on his maps, but we've never had much success. We've had more luck on some points NW of Lunkers, nice place to fish in the late afternoon because they are fairly close. Steamboat Narrows, near the light, draws lots of boats. It can be very good with a strong north/northwest wind pushing water through there. We fish the points and banks east and west of the channel opening, but alot of folks are in the channel. As for the rest of the bay, we have tried the west banks and points with limited success. We've fished some along the south and it has been very spotty. Have had the most luck along the bay's north shore. There are a couple of small bays which we fished the points that have been good. Also the far east end there are some small island with points that we hammered them on last year, working between humps in 14-24 FOW."
567012,Guest,2007-07-05 07:44:00,0,Do you have an e-mail address? I would like to get some input from you. I believe we were on the lake the same week.[email protected]
567015,wooglin,2007-07-05 09:00:00,371,E-mail sent.
567016,Guest,2007-07-05 09:26:00,0,"I'm sorry, I mis-wrote! I will be heading up from Texas to Minnesota this Saturday and will head to Golden Eagle Lodge on the 14th. I've must have come down with ""Walleye Fever"" and it's clouding my mind! I wish I had my map and GPS with me, there up north and I'm in San Antonio! I think I know where Wooglin is talking about, we had the resort owner guide us and he showed us a spot south of the the area that Wooglin is talking about. After you pass through Shanty Narrows (isn't there an upper and lower?) you come to a very large bay which is mostly to your north (McKenzie?) there is a very nice shelf to your left not far from the opening. Only problem is that alot of folks see you as they exit the narrows and want to see it for themselves. One last spot I would like to mention that's been good for us in previous years is a small island north of the opening into Steamboat Narrows. I've never seen anyone else fish it. The easiest way to get there from Goose is to head for the nav light on the small island between Goose and Steamboat. Pass that light and head for the opening of Steamboat. There will be several reefs on either side, but this island is located on your right (west) and is very small, just a few trees and a couple hendred yards from the last large island before you get to Steamboat Narrows. When we fish it in mid-july there is some cabbage in the area and we fish the edges of that. Sorry for the long explanation! BlackJack2, when do you leave Gold Pines? Maybe we can exchange some info?"
567027,Guest,2007-07-05 14:35:00,0,I'll be at Gold Pines from July 10-20th with my wife. Beige and green 19ft Polarkraft with a Mercury saltwater 135 Optimax. I fish around Steamboat narrows alot.
567028,Guest,2007-07-05 16:26:00,0,"We have a 16 ft Alumacraft Dominator w/ a 40 hp Merc. It looks similar to a typical resort boat, but without the advertising! My father-in-law has a blue and white 17 ft w/ a 90 hp Suzuki. We normally travel together, but will split to cover more water. We both have marine radio to talk between the two boats. The last couple of years we have tried to head farther upstream and have had good success, but not sure how far we will go with gas prices being up. I'm sure we will see you in the Narrows!"
567032,Guest,2007-07-05 20:18:00,0,Headin up in 15 days... Heard that Hwy 105 had been damaged by the excessive rains over the past month or so. Curious how bad the road is or was it just a rumor?? Thanks fer the update.
567033,wooglin,2007-07-05 20:27:00,371,"There is evidence of washouts on 105. Some are OK, they're marked with stakes in the shoulder. Some you can see they patched with just gravel, and some were so bad they had to fix the entire road. Some of them you can drive right over, others you have to really slow down for. No worries though, you'll have no issues getting over them! PS, keep an eye out for all the busted up trees from the storms early last week. Heavy heavy winds blew through there last week!"
567036,Guest,2007-07-05 21:57:00,0,"just drove over 105 on the 3rd from ear falls to vermillion bay and only 1 place we had to slow down. What was worse west of vermillion bay around Kenora on 17 there is a ton of one lane roads and flagmen because of road repair, very slow as in between flagmen speed limit 40 km per hour and they are patroling it heavily for speeders"
566927,wooglin,2007-07-03 08:35:00,371,"We never found that big dropoff, as the wind was so bad that day we fished Lunker Pt., we couldn't hold a drift with the trolling motor. Where we fished in Steamboat is near the light, as we went through the mouth of that bay, we just hung a hard right and fished that area. We pulled a 24.5"" out of there and a 30"" northern. We also fished the West side of Steamboat in the sandy waters and had success with numbers, not so much big fish though. Shallow warm bays in Steamboat put out quite a few northern, nothing of major size though."

566928,skindzier,2007-07-03 08:55:00,137,"Where did you go around Shanty Narrows? We always have had good luck at the south end around the reef by the red buoy. It drops off real quick there toward open water. I lost a monster there a couple years ago... I was consistently cathing fish in the 18""-24"" range and the bite felt just like all the ones before, even once I started reeling - so I lazily started bringing in when it decided peel a bunch of drag and cut off on the motor. I don't think it was a northern - it had a decidedly walleye-like bite... (The ones you don't catch are always 10 pounders, right?)"

566936,Guest,2007-07-03 14:28:00,0,"Wooglin, What time of year do you normally fish LS? We are usually mid-July, (we head up this Saturday!!) so that is what I base my ""info"" on. Over the last couple of years we've tried to find some emergent cabbage beds and have had some good success. Several of the small islands south of Goose have cabbage around them and can be worth a try. We, too, fish the bank just to the ""right"" of the light, we have caught several slot/over slot fish there. We actually don't fish the bays in Steamboat, but the entrances. Our 2nd year there we found a 10 ft hump that went down to 30-35 FOW and caught over 125 fish between two boats just jigging with worms and minnows. Also, had two bald eagles watch over us for two hours, screeching all the while! Try some of those islands east of Steamboat Island and some areas north of Steamboat Island. Always depends on the wind as to which ones we hit. Have had several good days there too."

That might explain why the river (Sanctuary) was so good, I think we're 'early' in terms of fishing up there.... Make sure you post how you do. PS, I was looking at my GPS last night, I have no problem posting some coordinates if you want to see where we were fishing...."

Nothing big in size, a few slotters. There is a stump top sticking out of the water, just jig around that area. I also have coordinates for Goose Island, a few rocks, paths to/from SteamBoat and Shanty Narrows. Some of my coordinates are in the area of where we fished, not directly on them (I was a bit forgetful to mark spots, so I marked them on the way out...) Good luck."
