566436,Guest,2007-06-19 14:09:00,0,"I thought the point of this post was to how to improve this tounament not so much for or against tournaments. As of now I would be against walleye tounaments. I see no reason why a fish needs to be put in a live well and then paraded to the public. And generally speaking these are the breeding stock fish being targeted. Like I said before I would consider entering 1 day if a close to zero death rate could be reached. And I beleive that changes would have to be made to determine on how a fish is measured up to the others. Now with that being said I see reason to have an argument between tourny fisherment and recreational fishermen simply because 1 is not going to convince the other of their point of view. I know the tourny is going to happen regardless what I think. Now if I understood what I read that fishermen will have a say in the future tourny's ( and not just tourny fishermen )perhaps a lot of concerns can be addressed if people are open to new ideas. And my point of view of the strenght of the walleye fishery at Minaki. I fished on the weekend as well, and did very well too. But I have to say if the MNR didn't step in with the new slots and limits the fishery was bit by bit going down. And I don't beleive for a minute that the rules changes simply because there was a couple of years of less then productive fishing by the guests. Over 5 years ago I was survayed on the lake on trying to determine the pressure, and who was doing the fishing. Now I don't remember the numbers of how many fish were being harvested daily but it was a lot. Ontario typically screws thing up with wildlife management. I think they got it bang on this time."

I just took over everything on Saturday and need all the teams I can get. 10 days is very little time for promotion. I'm doing really good so far though, I can only imagine what will happen when I have a full year to promote this. New sponsor as of today... Battery Man in Winnipeg has donated 2 Trojan Deep Cycle batteries!"

566440,Guest,2007-06-19 15:49:00,0,"Brian, I fully support the new regulation imposed by MNR. 18 to 27"" walleyes are indeed the breeding stock and must be protected to insure the future of the fishery. In fact, its the 21 to 25"" walleye that do most of the reproducing from what I have been told by MNR. This is a catch AND RELEASE tournament with penalties for dead and stressed fish, so no one... not even the bad man tournament fishermen want to harm a fish. In all honesty... one of my main goals of taking over this tournament is not to parade fish around and make tons of money. I take ZERO percent of the money for myself, it's 100% payout for prizes. My main goal is to give the community of Minaki something exciting to look forward to every year. I want to bring money into the town, for ALL businesses, not just Paradise Cove. I have no affiliation with Duane or Paradise Cove other than being a friend. Duane has been very generous in giving me this opportunity to take over the Classic and turn it into something I think will be a good thing for the town. As far as getting a zero death rate for fish... better weigh scale practices and teaching the anglers how to handle their fish will be top priorities. Also for next year, I am working on having a 1 day kids tournament off of the government dock in Minaki with lots of cool prizes. It will last for 2 or 3 hours and should be a lot of fun. So if any of you have young kids who like to fish or want to learn, next year will be a fun time. It will be for children 12 and under and free to enter. If you are in town that weekend, you should come and talk to me if you have any concerns about this tournament and I will do my best to address them. Plus I wouldn't mind meeting someone who values this fishery as much as I do. J.P. Kennedy"

No doutd that lodge tourist are the large part of the economy, And it should be no surprise that most MB res bring there own gas , food and booze for the weekend. But there are more way's to support the town. I know we used a local contractor for our boat house, and other stuff, as I know others have. Plus we pay a local to clear or drive way, we could use a quad but!! I don't know the numbers, but I would think Yurk's relies on mb res. Plus I am really sorry to see the store gone, But really I didn't find it a surprise to see it closed this spring. When they had such a limited service, and open for such a short period of time of the year. Now I wasn't trying to pick a fight, I do beleive this post was about J.P taking over control of the Minaki clasic ( not your opion's ) and how it can be improved in hopfully to make it a bigger & better tourny in turn help the town of Minaki. I'm sorry for the way you feel, but your open attack on mb res will not help anything. Have a good day !!!"

566541,Guest,2007-06-20 06:15:00,0,"Ok here is my take, by the way J.P god for you on taking this tournament over. I will call you tonight or call me anytime on my cell 807-738-0152. What bothers me are most people even the MNR have no idea the impact a tournament DOESN'T have on a fishery. If you have lets say 2 tournaments on a system in a season and you kill every fish caught during the 2 events that would be less than now get this less than .5% of the over all harvest on the lake during that season. So come on everyone and get off the tournaments are bad because reality and numbers show they never have been and never will be. Numbers DO NOT LIE people do and miss information does. Now I truly believe every fish in a tournament should be released alive but that is not realistic so if even 20% die and they are used up for charity that is a non issue to me. I fish many events in the US that are fantastic fisheries that have tournaments on them very weekend so I do not buy that argument. I also do not buy having a tournament very weekend on a body of water because the locals and tourist deserve to have there time away from the craziness that tournaments can create. What hurts a fishery is over harvest by ignorant people who do not respect the fishery. Canadians and tourists alike. I know many camp owners have stepped up and do control what their guests keep and I commend them for that. The fisheries are there for all of us to enjoy not just a select few. Overall tournaments have had a huge positive effect on fisheries and local economies. This is fact and here is why. Before tournaments no one talked about catch and release it was all catch and kill no matter the size. I saw it first hand as a kid. But as a tournament angle like so many I respect all fisheries and most of all respect the fish that make it all possible. Like s many other tournament angles I spend tons of time preaching catch and release and not keeping fish over 18"" to eat. We as tournament anglers spend lots of time shaming our friends and family into to not doing this as many still have the old mentality. If I catch it I keep it and I eat it. The world of catch and release and selective harvest has changed because of tournaments and fisheries are improving because of it. I dare anyone to pull up and show me or any good tournament angler your fish you kept over the slot because you will get a real butt chewing, see I made a funny get it BUTT chewing!! Anyway we all need to respect the fisheries first and each other and as I said we all have the right to enjoy this great past time. Overall I think the MNR is doing a great job in protecting our fisheries but I also think there is still to much miss information out there about the true impact a tournament has on any fishery. Just my thoughts on this very important issue. John Butts"

Anyway we all need to respect the fisheries first and each other and as I said we all have the right to enjoy this great past time. Overall I think the MNR is doing a great job in protecting our fisheries but I also think there is still to much miss information out there about the true impact a tournament has on any fishery. Just my thoughts on this very important issue. John Butts"
566420,Guest,2007-06-19 09:20:00,0,J.P. just wondering what ideas are being looked at to have a near zero death for the fish ???
566422,Guest,2007-06-19 09:48:00,0,"great neews JP nice to see that this tournament is getting a little young blood LOL. I'm happy about the big fish as I'm sure eveyone else who fish's tourny's is. One over the weekend is a great idea and should not put any added pressure on the system at all. As far as the system comming back i have only fished it for the last 5 years and i thought ""the system never left"" its been a great walleye fishery everytime i've fished it. You might have to spend a little time searching but that's why its called fishing not catching. LOL.Anyways I hope to be out there fishing the tourney i just have to find a partner? JL is bussy with a catering so a hunting i will go."
566425,Guest,2007-06-19 10:50:00,0,I can assure you that if the fishery wasn't struggling the MNR would not have put the slot and possession limits on it. I commend the MNR for addressing the problems and not caving to the resorts in the area who in my opinion could care less (to this day they are still doing everything they can to get the restrictions lifted).
566427,Guest,2007-06-19 11:36:00,0,If all of you are so concerned about the fish maybe you could throw fiberglass fish in the lake and catch them. Or cardboard cutouts. Or better yet not have a walleye classic at all.

566430,Guest,2007-06-19 12:55:00,0,Too funny if someone thinks a fish tourney will have an impact on a fishery.I think it would if they were every weekend.We all as tournament anglers do everything in our power to release the fish unharmed.Not like most recreational angler that cut em up on shore I dont think a walleye has a chance escaping hot oil.I fish tourneys on the mississipi and they have tourneys every weekend and lots with two tourney on the weekends.Fishery is very strong there.Arron who are u by the way.

566339,Guest,2007-06-16 19:29:00,0,"Hello tournament anglers and Minaki area lovers. As of this year, the Minaki Walleye Classic is changing. Held at Paradise Cove in Minaki, Ontario for the Past 8 years by Duane #### & Staff, it has been very successful. This year I approached Duane about making it even better, I presented him with new ideas for rules, promotion and sponsorship and after a little thought, he thought it was in the best interest of the tournament if I gave it a go at running the whole thing. I will use this year as a feeling out process and keep the format basically the same with a few minor changes. I plan on using a ballot box system for major changes to let the anglers decide; have a voice... after all, the anglers decide if it is a success or not. As an avid angler and conservationalist myself, the health of the fishery and handling of the fish during the tournament is a primary concern. Steps will be taken to insure a near zero death rate. For this year, sponsors have generously stepped up at the last minute and even more will be involved in 2008. This years sponsors include; Lund Boats, Tim Hortons & Pro-Am Tackle (Winnipeg). Entry Fee is $400 (Canadian) and many spots are open for this year. Please visit www.paradisecoveminaki.com for more information and entry forms. In 2008, even more changes will be made, including more sponsors, possibly better payouts and refined rules. A new website is being setup and I hope to have it completed this week. It will include posted results after the second day and lots of information regarding the exciting changes to happen in 2008. The new site will be located at www.fishminaki.com . Please feel free to ask any questions regarding the Minaki Summer Walleye Classic and check us out at both the websites mentioned above. I am looking forward to a successfull tournament in 2007 and even better ones to come in 2008 and beyond. J.P. Kennedy Tournament Director"
566344,Guest,2007-06-17 07:55:00,0,good luck
566356,Guest,2007-06-17 19:46:00,0,"Myself never being in the clasic, but if more steps were taken to prevent less loss of fish I know myself would be in. Good luck as well"
566359,Guest,2007-06-17 21:30:00,0,do you fish in other walleye tournaments?
566363,Guest,2007-06-18 07:13:00,0,"A few in the fall around manitoba, but this was more then a few years ago already"
566365,Guest,2007-06-18 07:16:00,0,Hi Jp Will u resinstae the big fish rule?What do other fisherman think of havin one big fish for the weekend? Thanx for an replies
566375,Guest,2007-06-18 12:35:00,0,JP....I was bing sincere. I agree with Brian D...do what you can to preserve the fishery.
566379,Guest,2007-06-18 14:40:00,0,"absolutely. Aaron, I have been fishing Minaki since I was 4 years old (28 now), and it irks me whenever I hear someone say bad things about Minaki. I want this tournament to be one of the good things people talk about. I would like it to be good thing for the Town and something for people like you and me to be excited about. Minaki is a great fishery, period. Caught (and released) 20 plus walleyes over 18 inches on sunday. All from 8 to 14 feet of water."
566380,Guest,2007-06-18 14:46:00,0,"Yes, it's official. Big fish are back. You will be able to weigh one over 70cm for the tournament. You will have the opportunity to catch it either on the first or second day. It's still four (4) fish per day, so if you don't get that one over 70cm, you can still weigh four (4) slots between 35cm and 45cm. From 45cm to 69.99cm are illegal fish and will result in an immediate dq from that days weight, so make sure its on or over that 70cm line on your ruler."
566411,Guest,2007-06-19 06:57:00,0,"JP....got you beat, this will be my 30th year up there :) It is a good fishery but it has taken a beating over the years and in my opinion the walleye fishing has really taken it on the chin. Alot of the complaints are warrented. I'm just talking about the walleye fishing in general, the smallmouth and Musky fishing is outstanding and has really been picking up over the years. I'm glad they put the restrictions that they have on that system, that along with a big drop off in the number of people going up there now should result in a pretty good come back in a few years."
