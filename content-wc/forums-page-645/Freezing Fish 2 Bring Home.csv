567052,Moss,2007-07-06 14:13:00,7,"Transportation of fish is a touchy subject with Conservation Officers. Here is what we do at our camp and they appreciate it. One fish (2 fillets) per clear plastic bag. NO water. When filleting walleye, clean the fish and then when skinning, skin the fillet all the way except leave a half inch attached to the fillet. Don't cut any of the skin off. Slide fillets in a bag skin sides out and lay flat. Like some of the other guys say, the fish must be readily identified, length measurable and number counted. You can put more than one fish in a bag BUT they must freeze in a position they can be counted. We often do this with Perch fillets. With Northern Pike, I cut a chunk of skin and leave it attached. When you get home and want some fish, you don't have to use your knife again. Just grab the chunk of skin and tug it off. Now I don't freeze too many fish for myself and they surely aren't in the freezer long enough to get freezer burn. Eat em up and come back up! I hate hearing comments around the fishhouse that there are still fish in the freezer from last year! I just got a vaccum sealer for Father's Day and it is great. I had a little trouble with sucking in liquids and one of our guest's explained how he freezes the fillets for a couple hours and then vaccum seals them. There is no liquid running out then. Works great. Another note for you guys is to be sure to have proper limits with each vehicle if you are in a big group. Not all in one vehicle travelling together. Don't forget to keep your licenses handy. Jigem Up Moss."

566693,v-bay gord,2007-06-26 18:04:00,3168,"The key is the fish can be identified and counted. The recomendation is one fish per bag in clear plastic. That being said, adding a little(you don't need much) water to help get rid of the air should be no problem ""as long"" as the above criteria is satisfied. Also I would venture to say that packaging more than one fish per bag would be fine ""as long"" as they can be identified and counted. I have often packaged six perch in a bag.....or alternatively half a northern or lake trout in a bag (two people may not be able to eat more than that and why defrost more than you need)...clearly label the bag as to contents and make sure they can tell species and number. More than that, and if not satisfactory to the conservation officer, I would suggest that the fine if challenged in court would not stick. Of course who has the time. I think most CO's are looking for a reasonable effort.....you may know that ""ball"" of fillets and water was one walleye, but why should they trust you? Freeze them flat, clearly marked as to species and number......forget the freezer paper unless you want a big hassle. It's not rocket science, but be dilegent in your packaging."
566696,Guest,2007-06-26 20:16:00,0,"When I package fish to take home I butterfly the fillet and leave the skin on. You can leave fish in the freezer a couple months like this. The skin actually protects it from freezer burn, plus the type of fish is easily recognized. Just try to get out as much air of the zip lock as you can."
566722,bensen,2007-06-27 21:32:00,155,"This was the first year we started using a food saver. Always did the water thing in the past, but got sick of that. Food Saver is it no doubt about it!~ We had most of the Walleyes single but some double packed. Northern packed by themselves. We went through a fish road block on the 502 out of Dryden on June 22. Warden easily counted 2 limits of Walleyes for my truck & thanked me for using the foodsaver bags. He wished everyone used them. He told me if he cannot verify the type of fish, they just start handing out fines. They don't have time to let the cloudy water melt. He said they had fined 4 people for over the limit Walleyes so far that day."

566777,Sturg,2007-06-28 14:26:00,3,"Any vaccum sealer will work. Just make sure the fillets are moist, not wet and becareful no moisture gets into the sealing area. We have been doing this for ten years now, the fish last longer in the freezer and taste better as well. Sturg"
566939,Guest,2007-07-03 16:46:00,0,I have been using a Tilia Food saver for years and they are great. I pack 4-6 fish per package and they keep great. I agree the best way is to slightly freeze them on a cookie sheet first if you have the time. If not put paper towel on both the top and bottom and let them dry while your having a cold Labatt's. You can easily identify the fish and they will keep for a long time. I wouldn't leave home without it!!!!!!!!

567000,Guest,2007-07-04 21:18:00,0,"We just bought a Foodsaver brand to leave in camp. We have been packing fish with it for years. We pat them dry with paper towels and the vaccum fine. Try to eat them as soon as possible, but they are fairly good for up to three months. Make sure all rib bones are out and pack one fish per pack. Six inch rolls are most efficient if you pack one per bag. Just make sure they can see the skin on both fillets. Been checked several time as recent as last month. Never a problem. It's worth the extra time."
567041,jdngfd,2007-07-06 06:14:00,6,"I took along the Foodsaver this year and it worked out great. Just vac em and lay in the freezer, if all the air is out they should stay for at least 6 months, mine never seem to last that long, we eat them too fast. Check on Ebay, there is usually a lot of the foodsavers for sale, got mine for less than 1/2 price, works like a champ."
566612,Newby,2007-06-23 16:43:00,148,"Well we got into some trouble this year with the way we freeze our fish. Normally we put 2 fish in a freezer bag with a little water, make sure all the air is out, then freeze. On the way home on 502 we were stopped at a game check. The MNR checked our fish and told us we were doing it wrong. They said we should not put any water on the fillets and only freeze one fish per bag. Well, anyway they confiscated 4 bags of fish because the water was cloudy and they could not easily recognize the type and number of fish. They also fined us $125. We asked if we could break the fillets out of the package or thaw them out and were told no, they did not have the time. We have been stopped before and never had an issue, but no big deal, we were in the wrong. My question is, does anybody take a vaccum sealer with them? And if so, what brand do you suggest and any issues with this? I like to bring fish home so my family can enjoy it, but I don't think the fillets would be very good if I just stuck them in a freezer bag and froze them. Anyone have any other ideas on how to freeze the fish and not get fined? The way I discribed above is how we have been doing it for 15 years and never had an issue before. We have even been stopped at game checks before and told we did it correctly. I suppose the laws have changed and we did not keep up with the times. thanks."
566616,Guest,2007-06-23 19:01:00,0,Thanks for posting this..for years we've only put one fish per bag but added water and got the air out..I was not aware you coulnt do that..but we havent been checked for years either..will be glad to see what those in the know have to say
566617,Guest,2007-06-23 19:05:00,0,HI. we use a vacuum sealer and it works real good unless you have a bone about to poke through. one fish per bag though. we tried a little water once but it sucked it all out. now we pat the fish dry and do the bag thing. it puts such a vacuum in the bag that even without any water its sucking a little liquid out. it works good though. we have been doing it for the last 5 years or so. I would think that just a little water in a bag would not obscure what the fish is though. good luck.
566618,Trailerguy,2007-06-23 19:06:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]We use a ""foodsaver"" brand sealer, 1 fish to a package and try to use the fish within a few weeks. We slightly freeze the fish on a cookie sheet before packaging, sucking water into the vacum sealer is hard on it, as well as leaves fishy water to spoil in the machine, phew! Fish checks are common practice on Saturdays, they like hwy 105 as well as hwy 502. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
566621,Newby,2007-06-23 20:26:00,148,"Trailerguy, Do you happen to know how many volts/amps the vaccum sealer uses? My only concern is that it would be to powerful for the camp's electric system."
566623,Guest,2007-06-24 05:56:00,0,"I don't think your issue was a little water in the bags, I think it was the fact that it was cloudy, and they couldn't easily recognize the fish species. And having more thanm one per bag probably didn't get you off to a very good start. If you don't want to mess with the food sealer, just rinse your fillets a little better, package them per regulations, and leave a bigger piece of skin on. You won't have any problems."
566626,Trailerguy,2007-06-24 07:38:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]They have very low amp draw, a toaster is one of the biggest energy users and every camp's cabins have a toaster for the guests breakfast. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
566627,Guest,2007-06-24 07:45:00,0,"We use the old freezer paper method. Put plastic wrap around each fillet and than freezer paper,with paper between the 2 fillets also so you can break them apart if you only need one. Takes a little time but works will and will keep the fish almost a year. Only one fish per package. Never been checked,but I think it would be alright."
566630,Guest,2007-06-24 20:31:00,0,We wrap the fish in cling (plastic) wrap. When we get home we than use a vacum sealer for longer term storage. Fritz
566646,Guest,2007-06-25 12:14:00,0,"Must be only 1 fish per clear plastic bag, frozen flat if you freeze them. Must have large patch of skin, and must be easily counted, identified, and measured. Here is the official website: http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/fishing/N100CD_p917.html Some of these pictures look like there is more than 1 fish per bag, but DON'T DO IT. Only ONE per bag. This page also says you may add a layer of water, but don't add too much. Water clouds when it freezes, so make sure the layer is very thin. We, too, got nabbed on ""easily counted"" once to the tune of $100. Won't make that mistake again."
