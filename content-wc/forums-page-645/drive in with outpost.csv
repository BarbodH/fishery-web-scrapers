Black bay would be a good choice as far as remote location, and excellent fishing with numbers and big fish! Sunlight lake is full of smaller eye's, but you can access the big lake thru Broad Lake and Altimeter creek. Dan Macdonald runs an A1 operation @ Lac Seul Lodge ... you won't be disappointed."
566525,5richards,2007-06-19 15:51:00,131,what is your price range/distance you'll travel and are you looking only for walleye.
566535,Guest,2007-06-19 22:14:00,0,Not too worried about price (not crazy either). Just want a remote spot with good fishing. Walleys are great but not the deal breaker. Remote is most important. Thanks.

567002,Guest,2007-07-04 21:43:00,0,"Try http://www.buenavistaresort.com/locationBVR.html they have a great marina, cabins, store, motel units and an outpost camp in Basil channel. They are just an hour north of Baudette and it's family run by very nice people. We are there several times a year for 20 yrs. Never been to outpost camp, but it's in a great area."
567021,Guest,2007-07-05 11:33:00,0,Andy's Graystone Lodge - He keeps a couple boats on some remote bush country lakes and he'll haul you there for a great day of fishing. Not quite as expensive as a fly in. The lodge lake can be good but you won't likely catch any trophy sized fish there.
567023,Guest,2007-07-05 12:56:00,0,"Try Gateway North Outfitters, good service, good prices and great fishing. Lucas has been in the camp business his whole life, and knows how to take care of his people. they have a main drive to camp as well as boat to and fly in outposts on some really great lakes, and they are close to the border Bubbawww.gnofishing.com"
566390,Guest,2007-06-18 18:30:00,0,Has anyone had good luck with a drive in camp that has a seperate boat in outpost? Would like the remote without the fly in price. Any help is much appreciated> Thanks!!

566431,Guest,2007-06-19 13:31:00,0,"A slightly different choice is to drive to boat in resort (arranged by camp operator-fishing boats and motors available at resort). Cascade Camp Ltd on the northern arm of Rainy Lake is a bare bones fishing camp with hot and cold running water, flush toilets, rental boats. Its been 5 or 6 years since I've been there. Resort is next to a waterfalls (Devil's Cascade) outstanding smallmouth fishing plus northern, an ocassional walleye. Also big crappies are available. Prices are reasonable. The Morson Ontario area has several boat in resorts in Miles Bay on LOTW. Peffrey's on Wabaskang is a boat in resort that I have heard good things abount."
