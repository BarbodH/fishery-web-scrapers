5019489,lama231,2016-07-25 22:31:00,29,"Stanley's resort All of the species mentioned. 20 Minute ride to the far West end of Eagle Lake Dock staff that will greet you when you leave, meet you when you come in, tie up your boat and clean your fish. Best cabins I have seen. 17.5 foot Lund boats with 50 horse engines, 2 fish finders, trolling motors and live wells. Guides that work for the camp and know the lake 1/2 to 2/3 the money you are looking to spend Third generation family business owned since 1948. Not to sound like a commercial but we were there the week of 07/09/16 with a terrible week of weather and still caught over 30 24 inch or better walleyes. The proof is that I believe they have 12 cabins and our group was the only ones in camp that were not repeat guests"
5019953,MN_Moose,2016-07-26 07:48:00,964,Possibly Witch Bay Camp. I'm not certain about a private guide in your boat for 5 days. They do have a guide system where guides accompany guests each day. I've never been there but I think it meets all the rest of your requests.
