5019017,pjshorthorn,2016-07-25 18:44:00,5654,"TV, Just to clarify a little bit....The person we should all feel sorry for is Gord's wife Susanne. She will have to listen to all the whining when they retire for the evening every day we are in camp. That is a lot of stress for her to endure. Thanks for the compliment on my time management skills. It is a little challenging to balance all of the normal things in life with a very aggressive agenda on our fishing trips, but that is what keeps our group karma fresh leading up to the trip. What happens on the trip........just happens PjShorthorn."
5019025,pjshorthorn,2016-07-25 18:46:00,5654,I can't agree more. I have a special place in my basement for my short rod award. PjShorthorn.
5019057,pjshorthorn,2016-07-25 18:51:00,5654,Just remember that we have a LOT of windshield time together on the way up. We will see how well you manage that PjShorthorn

5019177,pjshorthorn,2016-07-25 19:51:00,5654,"Coffee pots are out. According to Gramps, he found a ""slightly"" used Frog Toggs suit on Ebay for $20 and change. Somehow he got a refund on the shipping costs and now he claims that he only paid 2 cents out of pocket for the suit. Even I can't make this kind of stuff up. I hope I won't be following him around the cabin with a broom and dustpan this year, sweeping up the pieces from his rain pants. PjShorthorn:rock-on:"

We will be using portage boats as well to go deep into the bowels of Vermilion Bay Lodge lore and fish a remote pond where giant smallmouth and northern exist within the fading memories of local fishermen.. I think I estimated that we will need to replace at least 4 props so we will pack them along on our adventure. PjShorthorn."
5019009,BreezyPoint,2016-07-25 18:32:00,1581,"If you want all those props, you will need to eliminate the extra coffee pot and gramps rain gear. Especially the shedding variety of rain gear.Frank"
5017393,pjshorthorn,2016-07-25 06:20:00,5654,"Gramps, Breezy Point, Stickman and myself will be descending upon Vermilion Bay Lodge on Saturday for a week of shenanigans, monkeyshines and intended harassment of WC's beloved Lord V-Bay Gord. Although this may be a breach of fishing etiquette on WC, I thought I would post a ""pre-trip"" report to give everyone a flavor for the week's agenda while we are in camp. Here are the highlights: - We will kick off the week with having the 2nd annual ""Bad A$$ Baits by Ben"" fishing tournament. Every cabin will receive one specially tuned beer cap lure to try and catch a whopper. The winner who has caught the largest fish on the beer cap lure will get the honor of being named the Bad A$$ champion. - I'll be personally holding beaver dam jumping lessons for guests using camp boats out of binocular range from V-Bay's perch on the lodge's porch. - We will be instituting a free range chicken program in camp to perpetuate musky growth and provide guests with fresh eggs if any chickens survive wading in the shallows. - Clearwater Creek will be widen and dredged using a couple of the 18' upgrade camp boats lashed together so a fella can blow right through there to get into Clearwater Lake. Gord, you may want to pick up a couple, make that 4 , extra props. - A nudist colony will be established on Gull Rock. The bylaws have already been written and approved by the group. For those not familiar with the lodge, Gull Rock is a very large rock reef out in front of the lodge in Vermilion Bay. Guests will be able to easily tell if there any ""full"" moons, waning moons or waxing moons on display for viewing . - Daily boatloads of large beaver felled logs will be brought to camp so We can build our own outhouse in order to avoid the insanely high costs of using the coin operated washrooms in the cabin . I mean, charging in US funds for the washroom, really ? - We do anticipate some peeved off beavers following us back to camp each day so a holding pen will be built to keep them at bay. It will kinda be like a petting zoo of sorts, but we will be charging in Canadian funds explicitly. - We will be establishing the inaugural Pocket Fisherman fishing tournament where each person will have to hold onto a short rod for at least one hour each day. The largest fish caught on these short sticks will reward the champion with a nice swimming floaty and some water wings. One can never have enough PFD protection when on the water. - We will be ""attempting"" to have Gramps wear a little more than just a thong to the lodge fish fry this year. - The lodge fish fry will be replaced with a Rocky Mountain Oyster fry on Sunday. There is a sheep farm in Oxdrift where oysters can be harvested and a fella can pick up a nice pair of fuzzy slippers at the same time. We will be a little busy chasing sheep around on Sunday morning,but Stickman has been practicing his roping skills so we should be good there. - A water bomber ""flyover"" has been coordinated to drop flamingos in proximity of Gull Rock to help add some color to the nudist colony. Hopefully, we will see a new species of birds next year after the flamingos have mated with the seagulls. They will be called Flamingulls. - Good ole church revivals will be held in the fish cleaning house every day at 7 am and 9 pm. B.Y.O.B. is encouraged, but not required. - Seminars will be held on the proper sex identification of nightcrawlers. Bring your magnifying glass. On our second day in camp we will be covering these topics.......... Never mind, it may just be better to wait for the fully disclosed trip report when we get back. PjShorthorn, Breezy Point, Gramps and Stickman."
