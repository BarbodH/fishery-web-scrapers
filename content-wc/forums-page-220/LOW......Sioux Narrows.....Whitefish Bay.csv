5023905,Lake Of The Woods,2016-07-27 16:28:00,124,"I still do it the old fashioned way with Nautical maps.If interested see the links and attached photos. I lived in the Kenora Lake of the Woods area for many years and am familiar with fishing these waters.Whitefish Bay is a good bet for a large trophy fish as the depth of the water is quite deep with fantastic Musky habitat and plenty of forage fish.The very large fish during August can be found in 50+ feet of water where the females will be feeding on Lake Trout,Ciscoes and or Shad.I have caught Muskie at these depths while trolling for Lake Trout on many lakes in the area.However,there are plenty of Muskie to be caught off of the thousands of reefs and rock structures throughout Whitefish Bay.In August I would focus on rock hump and saddle structures adjacent to deep drop offs.I have always had good results with black Suick jerk baits,large plastic Dawgs,Jakes,Top Raiders,Top water baits like the Ramblers and Poe's Jackpot's.Bucktails with large colorado and willow leaf blades can still produce some fish during early August but not as much as during the June and July months.My baits all range in the 8"" to 12"" for length. Again,trolling with large Shad or Ciscoe type baits can produce very large fish that are suspended over deeper water off sharp drop offs.I set my baits anywhere from 20' to 50' feet depending on the maximum depth of water I will be fishing over. I have attached some maps of Whitefish Bay with the red 'X's"" indicating where I have had Musky follows,hits or catches over the years and the green lined areas will indicate where I have had luck trolling baits. Also,White Sucker live rigs can also produce some large fish during this time of year.I usually drift with the rig over deep to shallow areas with the bail open and let the fish grab it with no resistance which allows it to swim with it for a minute or so giving it time to turn it head first into it's mouth before setting the hooks. Sabaskong Bay on the other hand is a much shallower body of water which I find has good numbers of Muskie but on average are not as large as the ones that roam the waters of Whitefish Bay.
