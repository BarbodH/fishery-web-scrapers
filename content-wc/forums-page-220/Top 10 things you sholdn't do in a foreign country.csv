5014625,zeebee,2016-07-23 16:05:00,1144,"As a retired VP of a CDN bank....I suggest your interpretation is too literal, not likely to be adopted by the public, never to be supported by the court and politically unwise to pursue. You are asking a businessperson to refuse cashunder the guise of being a ""responsible citizen"". Once you retire you will realize how silly towing the company line can be; its an exhilarating, ""I can speak for myself"" experience. These laws were never drafted with the small lodge owner in mind andthe courts can distinguish that fact."
5014985,v-bay gord,2016-07-23 19:21:00,3168,I wish I was being deluged with amounts of cash that would be considered criminal. I did notice lately that my bank has a cash deposit fee......what? I'm being charged to put cash into my bank account...............
5015025,martinbns,2016-07-23 19:38:00,1520,"Different rules govern business' that deposit significant amounts of cash, in your case the Bank just needs to verify where you got the money, ie sold a boat or car, won at the casino. If you are a business that regularly deposits large(well under $10k qualifies as large depending on the business) you have to effectively be able to vouch for where your clients got the money. It's often very challenging for Small Business' and Banks to comply with these regulations."
5015033,martinbns,2016-07-23 19:41:00,1520,"I completely agree with you, the rules are often goofy. I am just reporting them, it gets harder and harder to deliver a good customer experience and be compliant with AML regulations. I'm not towing the party line, I also wasn't suggesting they refuse cash. It's just far easier for the lodge owner to do it all electronically and far cheaper."
5015425,pjshorthorn,2016-07-24 04:51:00,5654,"So you don't mind if we settle up for our trip using Bitcoins,right? No fees and easy peasy BTW, what is your current Bitcoin rate? I need to make sure you wouldn't be trying to hork me on the exchange rate PjShorthorn"
5020633,Stein67,2016-07-26 11:37:00,19,How is taking cash not cheaper than eating a 2.9% transaction fee on a credit card?
5021497,Obabikon,2016-07-26 16:43:00,2370,It's also actually cheaper to do checks with the bank than CC's. Electronically is by far the most expensive way to pay (or receive payment)
5021681,Guest,2016-07-26 18:40:00,0,"It isn't but those costs should be part of the business model, and typically are spread across the board."
5021705,Guest,2016-07-26 18:47:00,0,"That is an interesting comment. Since retirement, I pay most of my bill electronically and I transfer funds often to other accounts or other peoples accounts. Other people also transfer funds to my account. Honestly I don't ever recall being charged for giving or getting electronically. Electronic banking is actually pretty convenient for the consumer however those cost are 'spread across the board'. Imagine though the cost once you're hacked. Yikes."
5022409,Obabikon,2016-07-27 05:11:00,2370,"There are fees associated with direct deposits. However, I was thinking more wire transfers and credit cards."
5004625,mickr,2016-07-20 12:56:00,74,"in honour of today's two top 10 list, the ""Really Now"" thread and several themes I've read recently on this message board I am creating my own list 1. Don't expect to use your country's currency and expect that change will be available in that currency. Business owners are not in the foreign exchange business although many accept foreign currency as a courtesy to their clients 2. Don't complain about the procedures to enter said foreign country. The country is foreign, and sovereign, and makes up its own laws on entry procedures. As a aside, those entry procedures are often discretionary so don't complain when that discretion is exercised. 3. Don't go to a foreign country and expect things to operate the same way that they do in your home country. Foreign countries have their own laws....some of which you may find to be a bit ..... foreign 4. Don't go to a foreign country and expect that the rules are the same as in your home country and whatever you do don't go to a foreign country and expect that you have the rights that you do in your home country. I am expecting to get flamed pretty hard for this.....but go ahead and fill in the blanks."
5004657,Guest,2016-07-20 13:06:00,0,"The number 1 and most important rule, don't act like me.."
5005345,bearfvr13,2016-07-20 17:24:00,174,"I live in Illinois--i totally agree with everything you said !! It's a privilege to come to Canada. If people don't like rules and regulations,..then stay in the states!! There is only ONE complaint I have,....the fact that I have to leave after my week is up !!!!!!"
5006825,Babamel2,2016-07-21 06:19:00,414,"If you behave with good manners, accept differences, live above your frustration and act as though there was an invisible police man behind you at all times, you will be just fine."
5007241,AllenW,2016-07-21 08:20:00,11482,""""" Business owners are not in the foreign exchange business although many accept foreign currency as a courtesy to their clients"""" Considering the mass advertising the resorts in Canada do to promote US tourism, I'd agree they are not in the foreign exchange business, but if they want the US dollar it's a service they might want to consider. And most do. Dealing with any business or country is a two way street, unfortunately not everybody understands this, on both sides. If one were to go off this forum, you'd think there are nothing but ignorant self centered yahoo's on both sides. I must be missing them as in the 30+ years I've went to Canada I have only run into one yahoo and was the infamous game warder out of Red Lake, who left my legal limit of fish sit on the hot roadside while he went though his song and dance, I threw the fish away after that. I'd suggest if your having troubles on either side, to take a long look at your attitude before you blame someone else. imho Al"
5007369,Fishoil,2016-07-21 08:45:00,1277,"Well said!! I have to agree with you on this. In nearly (over??) 50 fishing trips north of the border I have ran into only one Canadian who I would say was ""disrespectful"" and have seen very few fisherman that could have used an attitude adjustment. Overall, I'd say most people bring their problems upon theirselves through their attitudes."
5009329,NP4ME,2016-07-21 16:12:00,378,Can we post this on our southern border?
5013761,martinbns,2016-07-23 09:47:00,1520,"Just a note on that, I am a Bank VP in Canada. Anti-Money Laundering legislation on both sides of the border in North America is becoming an issue for business's like fishing lodges and duty free stores. Anti-Terrorist legislation often creates unplanned issues for companies that accept significant amounts of cash, particularly foreign currency. The company is required to report the source of funds when they deposit significant amounts into their own bank. The legislation is getting to the point that the onus is on the lodge owner or store to know who gave them the money and where they got it. Some Canadian Banks are closing business accounts because of it, just too much risk that some of the cash is ill gotten gain and they are liable for huge fines if are found to be accepting deposits of funds generated that way. It's not a judgement on whether the Lodge Owner is laundering the money, but whether their clients are. Do your lodge owner a favour if the amounts you are paying are significant and use a credit card. He pays a small fee, but has no issues with depositing large amounts of US cash."
5013873,That Minnesota guy,2016-07-23 10:26:00,8293,"In regards to the large amounts of cash. It makes me laugh. Banks are pushing the heck out of credit, debit cards to collect the fee's associated with those cards. The government is pushing the cards to control the flow of cash (which they desperately need) so they can tax and collect easier. The world is being driven to a cashless society by the governments and the banks. Period. I have never once been turned away when I wanted to pay with cash. Once I was advised I would need to sign a form stating I paid with over $10,000 but I wasn't refused. To the original post, I suggest we treat others the same way we wish to be treated. It's really not all that hard. Obey the law wherever you are, respect others wherever you are."
5013905,IL-Rebel,2016-07-23 10:30:00,349,"No matter what country, swallow your pride, get rid of that chip, bring patience and be respectful."
