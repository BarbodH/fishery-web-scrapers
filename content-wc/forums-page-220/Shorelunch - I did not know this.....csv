The day before her flight we have 2 limits in the freezer, legally caught and possessed. The day she leaves do I now become illegal?"
4985961,gullrockguy,2016-07-13 12:12:00,44,"if she leaves her licence with you to accompany the fish, you should be ok."
4986065,LOW1,2016-07-13 12:46:00,2828,Why would you not be as guilty as sin? You are twice over the legal possession limit.
4986105,Shellback,2016-07-13 12:56:00,8083,"I have a conservation license with a limit of 2. Yesterday a caught and ate 2 walleye. I haven't had a bowel movement today, am I able to keep any fish today? Sounds like nonsense not being able to eat at a fish fry that someone else provided the fish, just because you have a limit in the freezer."
4986113,The tank,2016-07-13 12:58:00,340,I think as long as it's in the freezer and you both have a license your fine but once you transport it your in violation. She has to be with her fish in transport.
4986177,retire55,2016-07-13 13:16:00,1029,"A person does not require a fishing licence to be in possession of a limit of fish (they can legally receive a limit of fish from someone with a fishing licence). That's why a family (husband, wife and 4 kids) with only one fishing licence can legally have 6 possession limits in the freezer."
4986345,fergiefish,2016-07-13 14:07:00,197,"I do not think that would fly with Canada officials. You may have it at home but in Canada, if you do not have a license you can't take fish back with you. My nephew gets a one day license for each of the kids and full license for his wife and himself."
4986369,stumcfar,2016-07-13 14:11:00,451,So if I have 2 in the freezer and go to the Trillium and order walleye am I in violation? What is the difference in that over eating one of my buddies fish during shore lunch?
4986385,Curryale,2016-07-13 14:18:00,50,Absolutely 100 percent correct.
4986425,bigdaddyguns,2016-07-13 14:27:00,608,"A rational approach would end the ""chain of custody"" and accountability thereof at the frying pan. As long as everyone abides by possession limits into the shorelunch I don't see any laws governing the post fry stage. Otherwise (as already stated in this thread) one would need a license to eat a walleye or one could not eat 9 fillets or more as that would constitute possessing more than 4 walleyes assuming no other fish in possession. BTW what course of action did the ""newbies"" take?"
4985561,BornToFish,2016-07-13 10:36:00,1224,"I vacationed last week in NW Ontario with a fairly large group of people. Several of the ""newbies"" within our group were concerned about catching enough fish during the week to be able to make their take home limit. Thus, their first few walleyes went into the freezer for the trip home. They did catch and release the remainder of their trip. Our lodge offers shorelunch on the lake three days during the week. Guests simply bring their fish to lunch. Everything else is provided. The camp staff cleans and cooks the fish. My boat partner and I do not take fish home with us. Thus, we planned to bring enough walleyes with us to shorelunch (within our limits) to provide fish for ourselves and our ""newbies"". The lodge owner advised that a MNR Conservation Officer would view the ""newbies"" as being over their limit for eating walleye at lunch when they had their limits of walleyes in the freezer at the lodge. The lodge owner advised the ""newbies"" could take their chances with regard to a Conservation Officer showing up at lunch or have sandwiches rather than fish. He left the choice to the guests. I did not know this aspect of having a limit of walleyes."
4985601,LOW1,2016-07-13 10:46:00,2828,I think that your lodge operator was right. If you have your possession limit in the freezer and are eating another fish you are also in possession of the fish that you are eating and are therefore over the possession limit.Just another example of the silliness of possession laws. Daily/yearly kill limits are what matter as far as protecting the resource is concerned.
4985609,bigwalleye1,2016-07-13 10:46:00,2632,The limit is the limit regardless of where they're located.
4985657,Obabikon,2016-07-13 11:01:00,2370,"At what point does it become legal though? Is it illegal to have a fish fry and invite friends to eat who do not have a fishing license? Since technically they can't be in ""possession"" of the fish? Then that would mean it is illegal to legally shoot a deer and share that meat with people too. The main issue would be if your friends showed up with fish that they had caught (with walleye in the freezer). There are some C.O.'s out there that use ""scare tactics"" for some reason, but they would not want to go in front of a judge and try to enforce that type of ticket."
4985681,fergiefish,2016-07-13 11:03:00,197,"Not a big deal for people taking fish home. We typically take two fish each for take home fish early in the week. We can then have one shore lunch fish and one for back at camp for dinner and still be within the limits. During the week it is mostly catch and release only. The last day we are there we catch our final fish, and either have a sandwich for or hot dogs on an open fire, and then brats for dinner. We have been asked on the lake on the last day by the conservation officers the typical questions; how many fish at camp; how many in the boat, and typically if you are full on your limits, they will ask if you had any shore lunch. We can answer truthfully no on that last day. No sense taking more than you are entitled to and no sense having to pay a fine on the last day. Possession limit includes any fish you eat that day. A great resource to protect."
4985745,tjandy,2016-07-13 11:17:00,107,"So if I take my family to Canada and lets say my kids and I fish, but my wife doesn't. She can not eat any fish that we catch, because she can not possess any without a license???"
4985801,55walleyes,2016-07-13 11:23:00,131,We eat fish for lunch every day except last day. After lunch on day before our last day we will dump all guts and then get our take home fish that evening so they have 2 nights and a whole day to get frozen hard before traveling. Probably still a violation by strict enforcement but we are never over our possession limit. P.S. If you are worried about getting limit in a day of fishing might want to explore other options.
4985809,BornToFish,2016-07-13 11:23:00,1224,"Obabikon, You raised an interesting point with inviting someone to shorelunch that doesn't have a fishing license. Would they be in violation if they ate a fish that I provided for them under my fishing license? It could very well be a scare tactic by a Conservation Officer that they would be reluctant to stand behind in court. But who is going to take the chance and expense of being in court? Our group talked about this matter. Those that take fish home will keep one short of their full limit in the freezer. They will use the open spot to provide their fish for shorelunch. They will fill their remaining open spot on the last day of fishing. Seems pretty silly to me, but ........"
4985849,fergiefish,2016-07-13 11:37:00,197,"Technically yes; you are in violation as the person without a license is in possession of the fish. A little picky, but the law is what it is. Just get a conservation license if the full week license is not desired."
4985881,bigwalleye1,2016-07-13 11:41:00,2632,"Seems like we go through this every year. Start with your limit of 4. At no point can you be in possession of any in excess. Eat 2, one in the freezer, one in you, one in your non-licensed friend = 4. You're done for the day. Next day, you still have 1 in the freezer. You can catch three more, freeze them, eat them, give them away, but until they're consumed, they're part of your limit of 4. Deer are somthing different, in that it's one deer. One deer divided amongst one hunter and 4 non hunting friends is still one deer, and it's still part of your one deer limit. They've been gifted the meat, so they're not in violation."
