4813026,Painter1,2016-05-07 14:51:00,26,"I recently (mostly) retired so now have more time than money. We have a 22 ft Triton bass boat that is normally on Table Rock Lake in SW Missouri, and while fishing is great right now, the lake gets overrun with wake boats in the summer so we are looking to head north. We want to find a good drive-in location(s) in Ontario or Manitoba to fish this summer and would welcome your suggestions and thoughts. I haven't brought a boat with me for decades, but we are comfortable in this one and it handles chop pretty well. Nevertheless, it is just a bass boat so I'm not interested in taking it on really BIG water. I spent a week at Duck Bay Lodge last summer with a buddy. We were treated like kings And had a guide every day but the fishing was disappointing. Our last fly-in trip with my sons, several years ago, was also subpar with respect to catching. We are really hoping to find someplace with better catching ratio. We aren't that particular on species, just enjoy being out there with something tugging the line. We are strictly C&R folks except for a walleye or perch every couple days for the skillet. We appreciate your suggestions"

4813706,ftfarms,2016-05-07 19:40:00,444,Cedar lake-cedar point resort. Lotws-milesbay camp. Rainy lake-any of the resorts on the west side. These are places we fish in the summer and done very well. One guy used to have a R91 ranger that I used to go with. If duck bay resorts the one I'm thinking of I question the guide you had. There's some incredible walleye fishing and smallmouth fishing not that far from there. Well maybe it's farther than I think.

5017561,Kevin R,2016-07-25 07:27:00,305,"I loved Table Rock Lake clean crystal clear water my grandparents lived in Shell Knob from 1975 -1983 in those years very few boats & most were fishing. I have often thought how it would be to visit or buy a home on the lake. I live all summer on Kabetogama in MN it's a nice lake but a bit over run with boats (50-1) & Resorts (30-8) especially compared to Perrault/Cedar Lake chain in Canada. Fishing on Kabetogama has been awful according to most locals, guides & resort guests the past couple years especially this year the guides have been leaving Kab going through Namaken & portaging to Rainy to get fish. I have found fishing fine the few times I have fished, but action will be better on almost any lake in Canada. Boat size is more important on big water but most days a 16 Aluminum rental boat works fine. If I was coming this far for a week or so I would definitely go to Canada for much easier fishing & less boats I also would not bother trailering my boat. Perrault Lake Camp is a Great place to stay & they will show you how to get into good fishing without taking a long boat ride."
