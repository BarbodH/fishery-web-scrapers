We fished out of Evergreen Lodge and made the daily 30 minute boat ride down to Steamboat Narrows. The walleye bite was on from day one. Water temps were 66-68 with winds out of the west all trip. We found them consistently in 16', ranging from 12-22'. In 12 years, we never caught as many slot and overs as we did this trip. Biggest was 28.5"" with numerous 18-25"". We used jig/minnows, color did not matter, though, 1/4 oz gold being the best. We decided on our 4th day to make the extra 20 minute boat ride to McKenzie Bay and I can honestly say the fishing can't get any better. Tuesday we returned to camp and was met by the CO. They were as friendly as one could hope for. They went through the camp's freezer, cabin refridgerators, did boat inspections, checked our licenses and only found 1 group in violation for having one too many walleye and one slot walleye. I'm not sure what their fine was, but I heard it was $360 for both violations. We didn't target Pike, however, did catch 50+ on the trip. One group member did catch a 18 3/4"" smallmouth in McKenzie on a spinner rig. I have to say Evergreen Camp (Pat), runs a tremendous operation. The cabins and boats cannot be topped. Boats are always gassed up and minnows are in the live wells by 7:00 a.m. Camp staff are always around to make the trip an enjoyable one. I'm ready to head right back up there!!"

5021953,LoDo,2016-07-26 20:08:00,721,The common theme to those who have successful weeks on the water is consistent weather. Glad you had a great week on the famous LS!
