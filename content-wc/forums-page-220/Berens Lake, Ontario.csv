The fishing was always great and I'm looking for any information on the lake. I would like to go back someday, but would rather stay in a cabin rather than tent it. I think it is northwest of Red Lake. Any info would be great. Thanks"

4420073,appleyard77,2016-01-03 00:49:00,4,I spent 3 weeks up around Red lake ontario in Sept/2015 and i camped at berens lake.where i met two brothers from ohio that come up every year . I would have stayed longer but there was a heat advisory and it was to hot to fish so i headed back to red lake and camped at South bay on gull rock lake
5015417,hoppy63,2016-07-24 04:04:00,367,How is the drive up from red lake?
5015929,appleyard77,2016-07-24 09:08:00,4,Last year when I went up to berens lake from red lake the road was all fresh gravel so it was dusty and the shoulders were soft other than that it was good

5023353,saikk,2016-07-27 12:40:00,14,"No lodges, there is a trappers cabin on the east shore of the south arm that went up a few years ago. The residents from Pikangikum that used to use the landing as an access point years ago have a closer access point now so there is very minimal traffic on the lake at most times. I have never bumped into the guys who collect the camping fees for the site, wonder how often they collect from users camped there? Fishing is still very good there. If you want an easy drive to cabin in the same area that is getting good reviews check out / search Stormer Lake. A 20 km drive from there would get you into Berens but if you were booked in at Stormer you would likely just fish there. If you have a camper there is a camp site at Coli lake roughly 35 km up the Nungessor (90 km to Berens Lake)."
