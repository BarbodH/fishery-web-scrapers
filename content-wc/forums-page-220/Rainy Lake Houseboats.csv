You need to check in at Canadian customs or have a RABC permit (Remote Area Border Crossing) from Canada (Google it). You also can't take live bait, except nightcrawlers packaged in bedding, not dirt, from the U.S. into Canada."

5007289,tv4fish,2016-07-21 08:31:00,2694,"THAT bad , EH ?????????"
5007681,bigwalleye1,2016-07-21 09:44:00,2632,"With remote border crossing passes, notification of crossing in advance of, live bait issues crossing borders, issues with limits caught on both sides, failure to be able to prove in the ?US that you actually crossed, since you didn't have a receipt that put your feet in Canadian soil, and the fact that the houseboat was moored in the state park, there were only about 12 different law enforcement groups that had some kind of jurisdiction, it was a nightmare."
5007721,mms3rd,2016-07-21 09:54:00,148,How will fishing on MN side of Rainy be? I'm from Minnesota but always considered Canada to be MN on steroids. I've never fished Rainy. I'm looking at $1250 boat for a week..but there are lots of extras.
5008793,bigstorm2,2016-07-21 14:25:00,33,"I fish the MN side in the fall. Avoided going thru the hassle of fishing both sides too. We've been there 3 years (early October) and each year gets better for us. We havent used a guide, trying to learn on our own so we have a few tough days but there is so much water on the MN side to move around and try different spots. I look forward to the trip every year"
5011361,Jakerides,2016-07-22 10:59:00,223,Once the Walleye are on the reefs the MN. side is pretty good fishing. Good size pike can be caught along with the Walleyes. Very good smallmouth bass fishing too. The U.S. Side is big water with more good spots to fish then you will have time for in a weeks trip. The Park is awesome with fantastic houseboat moorings and great shore lunch spots. Enjoy your trip.
