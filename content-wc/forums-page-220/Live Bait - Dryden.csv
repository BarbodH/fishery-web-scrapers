Unfortunately, Bobby's has left me disappointed more than once. Thus, I now try to get my live bait before I reach the end of the line so to speak. Rainy Lake Sports in Fort Frances normally has what I want. I was wondering if there are shops with live bait in Dryden, Ontario. I've never heard of any being mentioned, but assume there must be at least one good bait shop. Any recommendations for shops with live bait in Dryden? Kindest regards....."
