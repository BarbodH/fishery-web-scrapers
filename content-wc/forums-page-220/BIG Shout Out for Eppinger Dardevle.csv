I noticed that one of my favorite Eppinger Dardevles had come into contact with a rubber twister tail, while in my tackle box. Most of the paint came off the Dardevle - completely my fault. This particular Dardevle (one ounce, yellow five of diamonds) is one of my favorites, so I contacted Eppinger and asked what other guys do with such lures. I was hoping someone at Eppinger could recommend something so that I could keep this lure going. The lady that answered the phone said that all that I needed to do was put the lure in the mail and send it to them. They would either repaint or replace the lure. I mailed the lure last Saturday. A new lure was returned to me today (six days later!), along with a bunch of assorted other items (e.g. a pen, key fob, stickers) and a very polite handwritten note. Wow! I am thoroughly impressed by Eppinger's customer service. They went above and beyond anything that I was hoping for. It's good to know that such high-quality products and stellar service are available from an American company.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

5014465,bthomas3333,2016-07-23 15:02:00,465,I had a similar experience with them. A HUGE selection of lures. Colors / sizes / styles not available at big boxes. They offered free shipping / a free lure / fast and accurate shipping. If you are looking for Daredevles I suggest a quick peak at their site.B
5015193,Mike Borger,2016-07-23 20:55:00,1554,On both a personal and professional level Eppinger has been an incredible company for me to deal with as well. Glad to hear your story but not surprised in the slightest.Beyond being an iconic lure manufacturer the people behind the scenes are all fantastic. What I like about Eppinger is it's still owned by the same family even after all these years and they care about their customers. Big thumbs up!

They even gave me a free lure called a Spin-n-Rex, and a nice selection of single barbed hooks in different sizes to modify my spoons and other lures. I have honestly not seen a negative difference in my hook-up ratio using single barbed hooks, so I avoid treble hooks whenever possible. Ultimately, single hooks are easier on the fish and the fisherman."
