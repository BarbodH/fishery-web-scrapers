4996289,BennieS,2016-07-17 15:23:00,108,"Leave for Cedar Point Resort in about two weeks with my ten year old Grandson. I don't fish all that much. Have fished a few times Ontario in June and have by and large pulled Lindy/spinner rigs for walleye. Will this be an effective technique at this time of year, first week of August, or do I need to be focused on some other methods such as jigging? Would also like to catch some perch and/or crappie with him. At this time of year where would i best start looking for those two fish, in the east arm or the west arm? thanks Jim"
4996585,prov1800,2016-07-17 17:14:00,5010,Hi jim.just finished taking thee partie out on cedar this past week.fishing was ver good for walleye in between storms.fish were hanging in around 12-13 ft.suspect they will be wuite a bit deeper when you get here.normally they should be deeper right now but have stayed shallow so far this summer due to cool water temps.those water temps have climbed into the 70 f.fished crappies also on friday and found them at around 25 ft.you will need to think lindy rigs in august for both species and will need some good electronics.
4997169,pale ryder,2016-07-17 20:45:00,1937,"prov1800 covered it pretty well. I'll add, expect to find walleyes on weed edges, rocky points and reefs. For lindy rigs I like Northland gumdrop floating jigs and 3/8 or 1/2 oz no-snag type sinkers and don't drag the sinkers you'll get too many snags, just contact bottom and lift it up about a foot. Also, some day minnows work better some days leaches.you can also catch walleyes trolling or casting crank baits, on jigs with bait or plastic, using slip bobbers and on spinner rigs.One of the great things about Cedar, and many other lakes in the area, is that just about any standard walleye technique can work."
5005281,BennieS,2016-07-20 16:54:00,108,"Thank you both for the advice. My Grandson and I will use it in an effort to catch us some dinners. I'll be doing my best to get him hooked on fishing regardless of our success. Sounds as if i should focus on minnows and leeches. Not nightcrawlers or is that a decent bait to use at this time of year as well? One final request. Should i focus on the west side or east side or is it just a horse apiece? I guess one question leads to another. Is it ""easy"" to find a spot to pull into shore for a shore lunch? I think the kid would get a kick out of that. Thanks so much guys."
5005777,bigwillies,2016-07-20 19:17:00,515,There is a couple spots a guy could pull in (on the rocks) one out in front of Nelson and one past the burnt bridge. Just look for the picnic tables.
5006057,pale ryder,2016-07-20 20:24:00,1937,"I haven't ever tried crawlers on Cedar, because the resort I stay at, Norther Lights, has free minnows and leaches. But I'm sure crawlers would work. I spend more time on the west side because that is where the resort is, but I do fish both sides and they are normally equally good. I'm sure the resort owner can show you a good shore lunch spot, and I bet your Grandson would like it and it would likely be a fond memory forever."
5015241,Rich B,2016-07-23 21:12:00,1081,"Bennie, Ray will let you know where to go to start (he's always talking with his regular customers that pull fish) and will help get you guys onto good fishing....the picnic spot out in front of Nelson's lake is an excellent choice (your grandson would enjoy the island). Be sure to post a report when you get back home on how the week went for you two....great that you are making ""Up North"" memories with your young grandson, that he will have for a lifetime.
