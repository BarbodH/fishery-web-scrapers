Every aspect of this trip was a pleasure! The cabin was clean and sound, the appliances worked great and no leaky boats with temperamental motors. Their attention to detail was greatly appreciated by all! Now the fishing: The walleyes were scattered and still munching on mayflies. Jigs with twister tails in pumpkin orange color worked better than anything resembling a minnow . Biggest walleye was a 24.5 incher. I have to admit though that after the first day, the pike kind of lured us away from the walleyes. So most walleye fishing was from 2pm till dinner. We caught some nice pike: four 40 to 42 inchers for the group with several 35 to 39 inchers thrown in. Pike were in deep cabbage 8 to 9 ft and caught on silver minnows, daredevils and swimbaits. Overall a great time and I will definitely be using Slate falls in the future. Thanks to all who responded to me with your suggestions and tips!"

So now we target pike a couple days while we're there. Biggest in the boat this year was 39"". This year's big pike for us got away. My fishing partner had a monster and managed to get it close enough for us to see twice before it broke off. The sight of big fish like that and the ones you caught are jaw dropping, ""Holy #@$#"" moments. Thanks for the report. Glad you had a great time."
