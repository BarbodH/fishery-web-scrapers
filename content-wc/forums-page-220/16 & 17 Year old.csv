5006769,kzoofisher,2016-07-21 06:10:00,5144,I get the letter notarized at my bank for free. Just have to call ahead and make sure the notary is working on the day I want to go in.
5009961,Guest,2016-07-21 19:32:00,0,Thank You all for the shared experiences and advice. I'm going to take along letters and passports. Thanks again for the feedback. Guest11
5010105,rnnonmt,2016-07-21 20:15:00,992,"Not trying to stir the pot but I have yet to find a law that requires the spouse or legal guardian of your own child to sign a letter consenting to bringing your child into Canada. Please don't get me wrong - I'm not wanting to start an argument. Each year I have taken my son to Canada I have brought a letter from my spouse just for the simple fact that it has been a recommendation and I really REALLY don't want to ruin a fishing trip just trying to cross the border. To me this simple effort of obtaining a letter from my spouse is well worth the reduction is hassle at the border. Although I have never been asked for the letter I am wondering if it is Canadian law to enter, USA law to return or just simply some insurance as to reduce the hassle at the border when taking a minor."
5010185,bigdaddyguns,2016-07-21 20:28:00,608,While not a hard and fast law seems that the border agents have flexibility in probing for proper documentation if they feel the need.http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/minors.asp
5010337,rnnonmt,2016-07-21 21:46:00,992,That is what I have found as well Bigdaddy. Although it is not a requirement by Canadian law to have a letter from your spouse it is insurance to lessen the potential of being delayed or scrutinized during entry.
5010657,Bowtech84,2016-07-22 06:19:00,572,"Ya the rules get me too. For example, last year while coming back the border agent said he needed to see our id and passports. This year coming back I handed the guy our Id and passports and he looked at me like I was an idiot. He then handed it all back and said I don't need your id just give me you passports. This years experience crossing back was 10 times better than last year. Last year the border agent was a douche. This year the guy joked with us and smiled the whole time. I thanked him for that."
5010753,Lmbkiller,2016-07-22 06:55:00,639,"Another one of my favorites when crossing into Canada is the beer question. One yr I say we have 8 cases for 4 guys. Border agent looks at me like I'm an idiot and says, I only want to know how many u are declaring for duty (4cs then). The yr prior I tell them I'm declaring 4cs for duty, border agent looks at me like I'm an idiot and says, I need to know exactly how many cases of beer u have total....so which is it? Where's the consistency? It doesn't have to be that difficult. Pick which way and stick to it"
5010977,Shortline,2016-07-22 08:29:00,234,"I carry a notarized letter from my wife that states permission to cross with our son. It is written to encompass the entire year. I have been thanked multiple times for presenting it. One agent commented ""Thank you for having this ready, as it makes my job a lot easier."" Happy border agent = smoother crossings."
5005545,Guest,2016-07-20 18:36:00,0,"Got a question on entering Canada. The 17 year old is my son, and he has a valid passport. He is bringing his buddy who is 16 yr old. He also has a valid passport. He is not a relative. With all having valid passports, will we have any problems entering Canada to go fishing?"
5005705,Bowtech84,2016-07-20 19:02:00,572,We took an unrelated 15 year old with us last week that had a passport and had no issues crossing. He did have a notarized letter from his parents stating he had their consent but he never had to use it.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
5005857,Jesse-WI,2016-07-20 19:31:00,534,"It is best to have letters and a phone number where the other parents can be reached if requested for both of them. If they ask for the letter and you do not have it, you will be detained until they sort it out in many cases."
5005865,3 Z's,2016-07-20 19:31:00,133,I think it would be wise to have a notarized letter for both boys. One from your wife for your son and one from the friends parents.
5005897,bearfvr13,2016-07-20 19:41:00,174,"Just crossed with another parents child,....they told me at the border (i called b4 I went up there) that it needs to be notarized and to make sure the parents phone number was on there also. That way they could call if they felt that they needed to. Passport, birth certificate, and notarized letter is all they said I needed. Have a good trip !!!!Bearfvr13"
5005937,kzoofisher,2016-07-20 19:50:00,5144,Agree with all of the above. Cheap insurance against a long delay.
5006065,Obabikon,2016-07-20 20:25:00,2370,"If you want to have it notarized, you can. However, you don't have to. Simply have the parents write a letter with their cell numbers on them, and the dates that you'll be traveling."
5006657,BornToFish,2016-07-21 05:13:00,1224,"Greetings, My wife traveled with our daughter to England many years ago. They did not have a notarized letter of authorization from me, giving my consent for my daughter to travel with my wife. They were detained in the airport, not being allowed to board the plane. I wrote a letter and faxed it to the airport security department, along with a copy of my passport. They were then allowed to board the plane at the last possible moment. Since then, my wife and I always have a letter of authorization when traveling alone with our daughter outside of the USA. We have taken our nephew with us to Canada on two fishing trips. We had his parents prepare a notarized letter of consent. As you might expect, we have never since been asked for a letter of consent. Go figure! Someone may have said it above, the notarized letter of consent is cheap insurance. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5006665,martinbns,2016-07-21 05:18:00,1520,"We took one of my daughters friends with us to Mexico, notarized letter with phone #. Wasn't really needed but cheap insurance, cost them less than $50."
5006697,pjshorthorn,2016-07-21 05:36:00,5654,"I brought notarized letters every year my son came with me on trips to Canada as a minor. I was never asked for them,but I handed a copy to the agent with my passport and my son's birth certificate regardless. I wanted them to know we were prepared in the event they would have a question about bringing a child into the country. I brought at least 3 copies. One for both US and Canadian customs if they wanted to keep it and one as a backup. Cheap insurance as already mentioned and a lot less stressful. Kids need to have fun and a wonderful experience on their adventures to foreign countries; not being possibly detained for hours and being asked a lot of questions which can be quite intimidating for a child. PjShorthorn."
