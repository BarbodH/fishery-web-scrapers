Any of the island structures better then the others? I'm assuming they will have the feed bag on and will troll 2-3 mph using mostly spoons unless somebody says trolling cranks would be better. Any info will be most appreciated, if you don't want to share here send a PM. Also any large rivers in the area? I like casting weed beds in the mouth of rivers. Thank you."
