Interested in any good smallmouth or larger pike lakes (with decent launch) along 129. Anyone ever fish Wakomata, Tunnel, Cummings, or Big Basswood? Feel free to pm me if you don't want to post. Thanks, Russ"

The Pike bite is great too. Cumming probably has bigger pike, but not as many lunker bass. You can check with Mike and Pauline at Grand Falls camp about using their boat launch which is right at the highway or you have to drive up the lake to find another launch. I would do it on your way up though. because space is tight at the launch. I'm not sure how far up the lake the other launch is, but Mike and Pauline can give you that info as well. As far as the launch on Cumming goes, I can't believe I don't know where it is. I will find out though and get back to you or again just stop at grand falls camp on your way up. GOOD LUCK!"

5017481,Algoma Guy,2016-07-25 07:01:00,48,"I have fished all four of those lakes. If you want bass and nicer pike go to Wakomata. I think there is 2 launches. One is at Wakomata Shores and one is at Snowshoe Camp. I think there is a charge to use launch. Big Basswood has some very nice smallies in it and decent launches but pike fishing is limited. Cummings is decent also and is right on the 129 hwy. Tunnel is more of a warm water species lake. It has walleye, bass and pike and will be a lot warmer temp wise than the other three lakes which are mainly lake trout lakes. I would think Tunnel will give you numbers but smaller overall size. In the mornings and evenings, trolling an original black and silver Rapala along the shorelines is deadly for bass. If the fish are a little deeper off the drop add a split shot. For pike find some weed beds and cast spoons, spinners or cranks along and over top of weeds. To target the lakers you will need downriggers or you can try and vertical jig with white tubes tipped with minnow or smelt (dead of course). Try points and humps that are adjacent to really deep water. Concentrate on 50ft and deeper. Another person you may want to talk to is Keith at Tunnel Lake Trading Post. Hope this info helps!"
