5021489,Obabikon,2016-07-26 16:40:00,2370,It depends on the owner. I have people call my cell phone... which is a US number so no extra charges.
5020377,mms3rd,2016-07-26 09:49:00,148,"I can't find an answer to this, so I thought I would ask the smartest people in Minnesota and Canada. When an owner does not have a toll free number, is the call to Canada (Ontario) an international call? I'm on AT&T. I'm calling about walleyes (just to make the question relevant)."
5020409,lawson2343,2016-07-26 10:08:00,459,"What is your AT&T plan? Maybe it includes calls to Canada. Mine does. I'm on the Mobile Share Value 15GB with Rollover Data. Here is info from the AT&T site: Unlimited Talk & Text to Canada and Mexico All Mobile Share Value plans and the AT&T Unlimited Plan include unlimited messaging to the world1 including Mexico and Canada. Our currently available Mobile Share Value plans of 15GB or higher, and the AT&T Unlimited Plan, include Unlimited Talk & Text from the U.S. to Canada and Mexico.2 For Mobile Share Value plans with less than 15GB or for other AT&T plans, add AT&T World Connect ValueÂ® for $5/mo. per line to a domestic postpaid voice plan and get discounted calling rates from the U.S., Puerto Rico, and U.S Virgin Islands to over 225 other countries.3"

5020665,Jesse-WI,2016-07-26 11:54:00,534,"yes, but your actual plan determines if there is any extra charge. Some plans include Canada and Mexico using base minutes."
5020721,Freytown,2016-07-26 12:15:00,770,I have used the 10-10-220 and 10-10-321 services with my landline. Very inexpensive for occasional long distance calling.
5020753,mms3rd,2016-07-26 12:30:00,148,thanks.....I said smartest guys in North America....or somewhere.... I don't have enough data to qualify on my mobile share plan.... I'll have to see how much per minute I'd get charged when I call lodge owners at 1:00 a.m. for an hour long chat. thanks...
5020793,Hot Runr Guy,2016-07-26 12:47:00,16061,Why not have them call you? HRG
5020809,That Minnesota guy,2016-07-26 12:52:00,8293,"My guess, not very much. You call me at 1 am it will be a very short conversation before I hang up."
5021049,lawson2343,2016-07-26 14:06:00,459,"So I checked AT&T and if you don't have a plan that includes Canada, you can purchase AT&T World Connect Value. $5/month. $0 per minute to call Canada. The other option I saw w/o this plan looked like it was $.39/minute. So, looks like for $5 you could call Canada as much as you like for one month.https://www.att.com/shop/en/wireless...-distance.html"
