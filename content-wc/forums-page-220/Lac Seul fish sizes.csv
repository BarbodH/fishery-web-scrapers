5008089,bigwalleye1,2016-07-21 11:33:00,2632,"OK, after one trip in June, and one from which I just returned, for the Lac Seul fishermen out there... What was your experience re: fish sizes this year? Seems like we got a lot of fish in the 14 to 16 in range, which bodes well for the future, but the 17 in range ""take home"" fish and the 18-21s seemed pretty well non-existent for us, as well as for numbers of other fishermen in camp. Any other experiences out there? We fished the same places as well as new places, and these fish seem to be very absent in the system. What are the experiences out there in this particular fishery? Theories re: what's caused this??"
5008337,tv4fish,2016-07-21 12:30:00,2694,"big: We were up ""there"" June 18-25, and if you remember - that (the 19th) was when that nasty storm came through. In our opinion - that cold front kind of shut down the fishing until Wed., the 22nd. We DID catch more smaller (15-17 inchers) fish year than ""normal"". That said - the numbers in the slot and over the slot were close to ""normal"" for us. Our largest was a 27"", but quite a few in the 22-24"" size. Surprisingly, they were in shallower than I expected (12-14 feet). Just our experience.........."
5008345,dt_rob,2016-07-21 12:31:00,3,"I fished the end of May, first week of June and we had a lot of fish in the 16-17.5"" size. We also caught more than normal of the above the slot size, mostly in the 24-27.5"" range. It will be interesting when I go back up the first week of September. Will have to try a few other areas."
5008945,tanderson15,2016-07-21 14:50:00,37,"We just got back from Lac Seul fishing the eastern side. We caught many under 18"" but a large portion of our catch was over 20"" up to 28 1/2. At one time we wore out our guide netting fish all around 23"". What a school of fish. The graph was all red with hooks."
5010169,Knoxabilly,2016-07-21 20:24:00,225,We caught 77 slot and 44 over the slot walleyes this year. We were up for the opener fishing out of Ear Falls. Amazing year
5014361,PeteyK,2016-07-23 14:06:00,7,"Was up July 15th to 18th. We caught all sizes of walleyes but seemed to catch more slots and over including 2- 27.5"" fish in 2 days of fishing than usual in past trips. Concentrated on the mid lake to east side of Lac Seul. One comment the guide made was that the fish roamed the lake quite a bit and there is a migratory pattern for bigger fish in his opinion. This may explain why one part of the lake may have more smaller fish at a certain time of the year? One continuing good theme: we caught tons of fish."
