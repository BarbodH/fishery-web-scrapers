5012833,martinbns,2016-07-22 20:04:00,1520,"That was a LEO professional courtesy, it wouldn't apply to a civilian."
5013049,BrianE,2016-07-22 21:07:00,98,Yep! That is a great point! and if the Canadian Gov. allowed what our country has allowed Canadians would be livid!
5013313,rzep,2016-07-23 05:40:00,1196,"Few years back friend of mine went up fishing with group of 4 or 5....for some reason he was coaxed by wife and family to take his new brother in law with. The brother in law is Latino with green card and on the top of it his english is not that good. If he does not catch what you are saying,he will kind of repeat loudly some of it.... Anyway,after week of fishing they are coming back as it usually is - tired and beat up..some are sleeping in the van ...some are not...got in the line to cross the border ...started waking everyone up....the agent comes over looks at the car,ask questions...usual stuff....then asks to open window where the in law is and asks him ""where you from..""....poor guy who is half awake with broken English looks at the agent and says ...""where you from,?"".....well this was it....they get pulled over to the side for further investigation..after hour or two everything got cleared up and they allowed to cross...agent thought they were smugglers..."
5013449,jimirjr,2016-07-23 06:50:00,1149,"I'll have to relate the story of My ""5 years on the smuggler list"" to You Guys sometime... All over an UNDECLARED 12 pack of OLD STYLE beer.... UN FK'N believable...."
5013609,pjshorthorn,2016-07-23 08:28:00,5654,There is no doubt that you were tagged as a smuggler. No one in their right mind would legally declare that crap. PjShorthorn
5013937,jimirjr,2016-07-23 10:50:00,1149,"Pat... remember, I was born in Chicago..... I mean, no excuse, BUT..... Wanted to go back in time to when I was a teen and had no $$$'s... OLD STYLE was a step up from Drewery's, Pilsen, Prima, Schlitz, et al..."
5014225,bearfvr13,2016-07-23 12:38:00,174,"I don't drink much anymore,....but oh how I remember drinkin a lot of Old Style !!!!"
5014377,pjshorthorn,2016-07-23 14:17:00,5654,"Now that ""splains"" a lot PjShorthorn."
5009745,Blue Lk,2016-07-21 18:24:00,269,"Sorry,I have to ask.Protection from what?"
5009785,tammybrian2,2016-07-21 18:27:00,12,"well this thread peaked my interest. our group has been discussing this exact issue. long story short.... i have a brother going with us for the first time and he has been hellbent on taking a handgun to canada. it seems on one of the border websites there is paperwork you can send in that supposedly allows you to bring one in. protection from bears would be the only reason one could use. so, the 'NO you can't bring one in to Canada' was the answer i was looking for."
5009793,pjshorthorn,2016-07-21 18:35:00,5654,Hunting rifles can be registered for use in Canada. Handguns a big NO. Your brother may need to revisit the regulations on allowable gun use in Canada when crossing from the US. PjShorthorn.
5010801,GWC,2016-07-22 07:14:00,1021,"It's far less inconvenient to just obey Canadian law(s) & leave the prohibited stuff at home. Never know when they're going to do a vehicle check. So far in 7 or 8 crossings, we've never been selected for that privilege. We usually get more questions coming back through US customs. My fishing partner & I live in different states & have similar last names. That always causes a few extra questions & we understand that one."
5010865,rnnonmt,2016-07-22 07:40:00,992,With the proper paperwork and a small fee paid in the Canadian border office you can bring in a shotgun. Did that one time. Shot sporting clays up there once.
5010953,rnnonmt,2016-07-22 08:23:00,992,"Sometimes crossing into Canada is a hoot for our group. I go with a fairly large group. We have people from Arizona including myself and folks from Minnesota. When we cross I'm usually driving with my son in my Father in laws truck from MN towing my boat from AZ. The typical questions come out from the border agent while he is looking at my passport: Agent - ""where you from?"" Me- ""Arizona"" Agent - ""who's truck is this?"" Me- ""My Father in Laws"" Agent - ""where is your father in law?"" Me - ""he's a few vehicles back in line."" Agent - ""where is your vehicle?"" Me - ""I didn't bring mine"" Agent - ""Who's boat are you towing?"" Me - ""Its mine"" Agent - ""From Arizona??"" Me - ""yes"" Agent - ""how did you get it from AZ to MN?"" Me - ""my neighbors motor home."" Agent - ""where is the motor home?"" Me - ""a few vehicles back in line."" Agent - shaking his head in confusion ""ok, go on through."" Another year I was driving a rental car crossing the border into Canada and the agent asked me where the vehicle was plated. I said ""I don't know. On the back bumper and possibly the front."" She pulled me over for a secondary inspection immediately.... I didn't know she meant what state. LOL"
5011025,Shortline,2016-07-22 08:44:00,234,"In well over 100 crossings, I have had very, very few issues or unpleasant chats. There have been a few ""prohibited items"" violations over the yrs, but they were unintentional and admitted, so there was simply a hike back to toss something in the dumpster that we didn't know we were supposed to have. The times when there were tense issues, were when coming back INTO the U.S. So from my personal viewpoint, Canada Customs is a far friendlier and easier building to deal with than their neighbors to the south. I have been checked by several genuine jerks on re-entry. Yes, I know they are doing their jobs, and allegedly keeping our country safe, but when I see the issues of illegal immigration and the unwillingness to address that at by our gov't, the efforts that have an affect on me seem like a bunch of hollow B.S."
5011249,Fishoil,2016-07-22 10:13:00,1277,I think he means protection FROM the lodge owner. Two beers must put him down for the night??
5011737,pjshorthorn,2016-07-22 13:24:00,5654,"You sure Jimi's wife didn't send you some of those ""Colorado"" brownies ? PjShorthorn."
5012489,rnnonmt,2016-07-22 18:27:00,992,"No Pat, I'm naturally serious and goofy in the same moment. Although if a Jimi's wife did send me Colorado Brownies the border agent would probably wonder what all of the empty doritos bags and empty pizza boxes were all about and then I would have to answer those questions too. Its just not worth it. lol"
5005129,Shellback,2016-07-20 15:59:00,8083,"Just curious. Probably one of the worst things you might try to bring into Canada would be a handgun. Actually you aren't trying to bring the handgun into Canada, but you have an Oh S**t moment when the agent asks you if you have any guns. So you inform him, yes as a matter of fact I do have a pistol that I'm licensed to carry in the US, but forget was in my glove box. At that point, would you be prosecuted, or be escorted back into the US?"
5005145,Obabikon,2016-07-20 16:01:00,2370,"You would simply have to turn around and return to the US or... give up the weapon itself. You were honest about it, and there wouldn't be any prosecution."
5005241,fishinnut 3446,2016-07-20 16:28:00,638,"This yr. camp owner wanted me to bring fireworks again as I did in the past and no questions were asked before so what the heck ? Well this yr. same ??? then asked any fireworks ? I never lie to them so I said yes $600 worth and was asked to turn around and surrender them on the USA side and did so, Man that lady on the USA side was a B I T C H !but got them out of the truck and did another U turn and crossed with 2 boxes of sparklers But did also ask him about having CC and if I would have forgot to take out and he informed me that the USA side has a lock box for this and pick it up on the way back."
5005249,The tank,2016-07-20 16:32:00,340,I talked to a guy at the pheasant run all canada show a few years back. He was a Chicago city cop and forgot about his hand gun in the glove box. He told them about it and they checked it in for him and he picked it back up on the way home.
5007985,mms3rd,2016-07-21 11:13:00,148,"I came back from Canada and was asked three or four times about whether I was bringing something back I didn't take in. I said a couple fillets and that was it. He kept asking. Then I remembered I had a stick to use to make a cane for a friend. It was weathered from being in the water. He sent out the agricultural specialist who studied, asked what kinds of trees were around....told me I just couldn't throw it away in their trash.....then decided it was not a harmful species....45 minutes later we were on our way."
5008281,Sportdog,2016-07-21 12:16:00,6735,When I cleared customs returning from Vietnam I was pulled out of line and taken to the interrogation room because I had a small embroidered pillow one of the local girls made for me. It so happens that she had used plants for the stuffing and the agents thought I was transporting MJ. After what seemed like twenty minutes of questioning and me continuing to state that I did not know what was inside the pillow stuffing they finally opened it up. I received a lecture about transporting plant material from outside the country and was sent on my way. I still have that pillow case.
5009641,tammybrian2,2016-07-21 17:48:00,12,"with the proper paperwork, can a handgun be brought in to canada for protection on a fishing trip? --Brian"
5009681,Shellback,2016-07-21 18:06:00,8083,NO!
5009729,v-bay gord,2016-07-21 18:16:00,3168,I find that if you give the lodge owner a couple beers there's no need to use the pistol.....
5009737,pjshorthorn,2016-07-21 18:23:00,5654,"After a couple of beers, what protection tactics would said lodge owner use? Just curious....is that two brews per guest ? I'll make sure to get some of that extra potent CO-OP beer on the way in. PjShorthorn."
