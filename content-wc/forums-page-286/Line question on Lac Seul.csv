3755873,BoxingRef_Rick,2015-04-11 17:10:00,34,Thanks much sir!
3760057,Aspencreek,2015-04-12 21:31:00,2911,"I use the same rig when we really want to cover a tight area. I will use this set-up, my brother will slip bobber. Toss it out let it get to the bottom and SLOOOWLY retrieve, works with minnows, worms or leeches, and catches walleyes, SM, and the occasional gator."
3729234,fishman10,2015-04-04 18:58:00,226,"When I started walleye fishing 50 years ago in northern Canada, the spinner of choice was called a little joe. These were tied with BLUE 40 pound ( clothesline), they bit it just the same as now with the guys using fluorocarbon leaders. Yes the tackle manufacturers would like you to believe that you have to try ( and buy) the latest and greatest stuff on the market."
3730050,zeebee,2015-04-05 00:03:00,1144,"Yup, I remember the Little Joe's. They were also tied with aberdeen hooks........gold plated as I recall."
3732234,Aspencreek,2015-04-05 14:24:00,2911,"The only difference between the original Lil Joes and the ones I use today is...now that I think about it, a lot....but the idea is the same. I just tie them up myself."
3732634,fishman10,2015-04-05 17:16:00,226,"I tie them myself as well, much cheaper."
3733882,BoxingRef_Rick,2015-04-06 01:30:00,34,Hi. I use the 6# Stren gold for all of my Crappie fishing. What pound Stren do you use for Walleye etc...? Thanks much!
3733890,BoxingRef_Rick,2015-04-06 01:53:00,34,Hi are you using the weight of the bait to take the floating jig down to the depth you are fishing? How are you using this? thanks much!
3733906,BoxingRef_Rick,2015-04-06 01:55:00,34,How do you rig this set up with the floating heads sir?
3734978,pjshorthorn,2015-04-06 09:58:00,5654,"Box: I can post a picture a little later this evening,but it is similar to a lindy rig or carolina rig for bass fishing. Egg weight above a barrel swivel so that it has freebom to slide when hitting rocks or timber as it moves along the bottom. The floating jghead is about 18 inches below the swivel. Been using them for 10+ years on Lac Seul with great success. PjShorthorn"
3737210,ftfarms,2015-04-06 20:00:00,444,I use 6lb and 8lb for walleyes.
3738602,pjshorthorn,2015-04-07 07:19:00,5654,Here are a couple of pics of the jig types and how I rig them. Let me know if you have any other questions. Vary your weight size based on your drift or trolling speed in order to stay in contact with the bottom. PjShorthorn
3723514,Knoxabilly,2015-04-02 21:28:00,225,"I know this probably has been beat to death but I'm getting geared up for the Walleye Opener on Lac Seul and was curious what you guys are running for line. We do lots of vertical jigging. I've always ran mono and recently started using Trilene Sensation blaze orange and love it. Everyone swears by braid and floro- I wasn't a big fan of floro but love braid for bass. Does anyone have issues in Lac Seul with all the snags with braid? I know you can run a floro leader but I'd rather run it straight to the jig if possible, with the water so murky does it really matter?"
3723738,ftfarms,2015-04-03 00:35:00,444,"When I was using braided line to jig with I tied to the jig. I always had a 12"" long doll rod to wrap around the line when I got snagged that helped in several ways. The feal with braided line is the best but I went back to mono to each his own but I liked it better than floro and braided. I use the gold line in the stained water it is the easiest to see. I never understood the floro leader on braided I used braided for feal and to get more jigs back out of the rocks I put the floro leader on and it broke off when snagged Just my 2 cents."
3723746,ftfarms,2015-04-03 01:12:00,444,I use the gold stren but just went on eBay and got a small spool of sensation orange I want to try it.
3723970,bigwalleye1,2015-04-03 06:20:00,2632,"We jig A LOT and used to usee stictly Trilene XL in green, 6 lb. Once I got a really good jigging rod ( St Croix Avid, and low a ST Croix Legend Extreme) I switched to braid. I like the no stretch, better feel, and almost unbreakable nature of the stuff, but it's a bear when you hang up. I started useing a double uni knot to attach 5 feet of 6 lb trilene to the end. I can change jigs easily, if I hang up, I can break off without a tug of war, and i get just a little bit of stretch on the hookset. Seems like it helps me hook up, and maybe prevents or reduces the chance of a tip snap if you accidently high stick a rod."
3724018,pjshorthorn,2015-04-03 06:37:00,5654,"Strictly a mono guy....... fishing on Lac Seul for close to 30 years. Normally I fish UL or ML rods so I haven't really felt the need to switch to braid. I have caught plenty of 28-30"" walleye and nice northerns up to 40"" on 6 or 8 lb mono. One caveat is that I primarily use floating jig heads which probably reduces the number of lost jigheads compared to the weighted jigheads. Lac Seul's water is really a dark tannic color and I never felt the color or visibility of my line had any effect on overall results. The fish are there or they aren't. PjShorthorn"
3724066,BornToFish,2015-04-03 06:52:00,1224,"The vast majority of my walleye fishing during mid-summer through autumn is vertical jigging. I tried a popular braid when it first came out many years ago. I could not get this line off my spool fast enough, in order to return to my preferred monofilament. I found that my lightweight jigs would hang up in the middle of water column, when I thought that I was near bottom. I'm sure that the braids are much improved by now, but that doesn't matter to me any more. I exclusively use six pound Trilene XL on my spool. I tie a small SPRO swivel (35 pound) to the end of the line and then tie a dropper of six pound Vanish fluorocarbon to the other end of the swivel. The dropper is around eighteen inches or so. I tie the dropper directly to the jig (either 1/16 or 1/8 ounce). This setup is simple and works extremely well for me. I use a light power St. Croix Legend rod. I have listened to many people argue that braids offer supreme sensitivity to detect bottom and the bite. I believe that the sensitivity works both ways as the fish is now able to better detect me. Is that sensitivity good or bad? I absolutely believe that the setup that I described above offers me all the sensitivity that I could possibly want. But, you have to use what offers you the confidence that you need to have when you are in the boat. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3724778,Bassmandpe,2015-04-03 10:09:00,42,"Everybody likes something different so experiment while you are there. I use mono 6# Sensation on one rod, 8# Berkly Nonofil on another and still use a floro rod too. Vertical jig, Lindy Rigs and Drop Shot to mix things up. They all catch fish! Great to play around and come up with your favorite. Wish we were leaving in the morning! But have a few more weeks of Florida Bass Fishing on Lake O in the mean time!"
3725162,Knoxabilly,2015-04-03 12:28:00,225,"Thanks for the replies so far fellas! I've been so happy with sensation hard to switch but I might take a spool of power pro up to see how it goes. Yes I do want to try to drop shot for some eyes this year, I've never tried that before for walleyes"
3727842,fishman10,2015-04-04 09:39:00,226,"Don't over complicate things, I live in this neck of the woods. Line is the least of your worries. 8-10 pound is good, no need to use 6, you will only be supporting the tackle stores Our fish have not gone to hook school, they are not sensitive to these things., same as finesse fishing, no need for it. Your question is like asking. : what calibre is good for deer."
3728586,Aspencreek,2015-04-04 15:15:00,2911,"X2, a man who ought to know!!! Did you ever hear the saying ""fishing tackle is designed to catch more fishermen than fish."" Words to live by. The same tackle my dad and uncle used to boat walleyes almost 30 yrs ago are the same things I use every year."
