And you will probably be "" sorry"" some day when you try to cross the border into the U.S without the proper documentation listed under the WHTI. The question is will you come back on the website and say how wrong you were when that happens? Somehow I doubt it."

And the rigs over in the naughty lot that you refer too are the guys who didn't have the proper documentation and that didn't do the research you wish we all would do. You have a passport, you did the right thing, so I really have to wonder why you are taking the stance you are. For those who have a question about getting a passport or not, the answer is simple, GET ONE!"
3776297,ftfarms,2015-04-17 05:55:00,444,I think LMBkiller is someone that likes to get people going on and on for no reason. You know he has a pass port and so does his brother.

While LMB apparently has one, I wish his brother luck. While you're all certainly free to make your own choices, you all certainly also have the obligation to deal with the consequences. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. BTW, you also don't need to declare guns, mace, or excess food or alchohol going into Canada either...."
3776737,Lmbkiller,2015-04-17 07:38:00,639,"Great post. Did u call and inquire about it like we HAD to? I didn't think so. In our circumstances if all we did was go to that website and read that we would've cut our trip short by 2 days. So is that what u guys do if something unfortunate happens short notice? Go online, read some stuff, and then say ""well I guess we're screwed out of 2 days of fishing"". I certainly hope not. The Internet, even reputable sites, aren't all gospel truth"
3777457,ftfarms,2015-04-17 10:16:00,444,Here's the part were you are right. The US customs can not denie re-entry of a US citizen for any reason. So if you can prove your a US citizen you will be allows re-entry. Now you may be arrested if your wanted or doing anything illegal and may have to prove your citizenship. In 2011 I was in the Canadian customs building in fort Francis and a guy walked in and he said thay pulled him in because he left his pass port at home. All of us were like didn't think you had to have one to get into Canada? He was there for a long time over 30 minutes while we was there and still there when we left. It just seems easier to just have a pass port.
3777649,CI_Guy,2015-04-17 11:39:00,2118,"Unlike a beauracrat on the phone who is always 100% correct! We're just saying it is the law and things will go much faster if you have the passport. We all adjust to the circumstances, some might have cut the trip short most probably would have rolled the dice. I've had to wait 2 hours for ""that guy"" from our group while he proved to U.S. border officers he was a U.S. citizen. Actually they made him sit in a room for 2 hours while they probably spent less than 5 minutes checking his license & birth certificate. He knows next time he better have a passport or bus fare home because we won't wait a second time."
3778041,forgop,2015-04-17 14:35:00,880,"We have millions getting here without a birth certificate, drivers license, or passport and they don't seem to have any issue along with government benefits to boot."
3778057,Draco1206,2015-04-17 14:38:00,175,"I think I would trust what's written on an official government website more than what some beauracrat tells me over the phone. Try telling the border crossing agent that "" so and so said I didn't need a passport"" and see how far that will get you. Better to have something in writing. I think the border agent will tell you the same thing I would. There are a lot of sh-thouse lawyers out there that have nothing to lose by giving you bad advice."

I can assure you anyone with a passport will spend ""significantly less time"" at the border crossing dealing with the agent than that of someone who does not. Now you can be defiant, not get your card or passport, dig in your heels and try to be THE guy all you want. But if I'm in line behind you and YOUR the guy holding up the rest of us, after the border crossing, the rest of us would like to have a short discussion with you, maybe a mile up the road to try and convince you of the errors in your judgement."

Facts are facts. U guys don't want to the research like I did and pay for one, great, u guys must have lots more money than most. I will continue to go to Canada 1-2 per yr like I have since I was 4 and laugh at all the rigs over in the naughty lot when it only took me 5min worth of talking and I'm on my way. Carry on gents"
3774473,Oldschool,2015-04-16 15:26:00,163,"The cost of a passport and/or card is variable. The simple and best way to discover that cost is to delve into the matter and do the research. How much does the passport picture cost? How much is the processing fee by the agency (yes, it does vary)? Do you need to have it expedited; yes, it costs more that way. It varies by age of the holder. I consider the cost to be decremental resulting from the number of years that it can be used, hence my original estimate of $6.50. That is for me going to be a tenth the cost of the total passport as I enter into Canada once per year and eventually am forced to return to my home. Considered that way, it is $3.25 for each border crossing; it gets less expensive the more one uses it. Those that argue the necessity of a passport are probably riding on the back of Bigfoot as they enter back into the U.S. I may not need one either had I such a suitable ride as that"

3765113,dkrusin,2015-04-14 08:53:00,97,Some countries require that your passport not expire within 6 month of entering their country. Anyone know if Canada has such a requirement. Thanks in advance.
3765153,Walleye_Guru,2015-04-14 09:08:00,62,"No, but you'll have to articulate when you will be leaving the country. Best advice is to have the booking confirmation from your outfitter with you."
3765345,larry0418,2015-04-14 10:04:00,16,"My wife and I went through last fall and was alerted by the Canadian border officials that my wife's passport had expired. At this point I figured we keep on going since we had already crossed the border. You don't need a passport to enter Canada - only to get back into the states. I figured worst case scenario we stay longer than we planned to. We stayed about 10 days and when we came back across to the states, the US authorities excepted the expired passport with no problem. We were told to get a new passport and they prefer an expired passport over a drivers license. Anyway this was our experience crossing with an expired passport. Hope it helps."
3770145,Lmbkiller,2015-04-15 12:04:00,639,"U don't need a passport, passport card, whatever, to get back into the U.S. A certified/or copy of birth certificate and DL is all u need. How do I know? My brother did it 2yrs ago, I was there, his girlfriend was in Madison, wi at the time, we had her get ahold of homeland security, they said it was fine. We were driving not flying. On our way back to wi, hit the border, was there maybe 5min, no problems, no comments from customs agent, everything fine. We made the agent aware prior to handing our documents to her that my bro only had BC and DL. If all I did for traveling was driving to Canada and back I would not get a passport/passport card, I would simply use BC and DL. No reason to pay passport money, it's too much if u don't have too"
3770601,Oldschool,2015-04-15 14:10:00,163,"Yes, a passport is required. While there are anecdotal experiences where the Border Agents let people through without a passport, that does not change the law. There are more experiences where not having a passport caused grief for both the offender and the Agents. We may all speed and push those limits at times, but that does not mean that we are immune from the law just because we 'get by.' The $6.50 per year that the card costs has to be weighed against the inconvenience and trouble caused by not having one. As frugal as I am, I will purchase the passport card."
3770657,Obabikon,2015-04-15 14:28:00,2370,"Canada does NOT require a passport for people driving in from the UNITED STATES. That is a US law. You can get into Canada with just a driver's license/birth certificate. However, a border agent might require you to have your passport so that you can RETURN to the United States.You need the passport to return to the US... as it is a US law.... Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI)All that said... the US will not prevent a US citizen from returning home. (what happens if you lose your passport while on a trip)? So, to answer the OP queation... the Canadian Border guard will not care one little bit the expiration date. He might remind you that it expires soon, but it will not be a reason to deny entry."
