3760001,Limeyangler,2015-04-12 21:18:00,563,"Hi all, Ice is starting to go fast now. Lost almost a foot of ice in front of our hose in a matter of days, and of the 2 foot or so left it is well honeycombed almost half way now. The ice has come away from the shore around the rocks in the last day, and just about all the snow has disappeared from the lake and our property. Will still get out a couple more times before walleye closes in a couple of days, but have already started on the boat today by changing the bearings and started to re-floor, re-carpet, build new front trolling motor platform. NOT LONG NOW! Here is my adventure in front of the house from Friday evening.VIDEOhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYpOP4nAYkw"

3761137,Walleye_Guru,2015-04-13 08:34:00,62,"Tried to open up the drive way last week and still too much snow... dang Lake Nipigon lake effect stuff. Hopefully this week. If the weather keeps up, we'll be open in the next 2 weeks or so.Side note - logging roads are in BAD shape. Off road travelers be prepared! Shovels, chainsaws, good tires, strong backs and weak minds (we call them youth where we're at)"

3770449,Limeyangler,2015-04-15 13:39:00,563,"Not sure to be honest. Would expect it to be pretty similar to the rest of the area, ice will be gone by opener this year for sure!"
3770457,Limeyangler,2015-04-15 13:41:00,563,"Yup, it certainly lost a lot in the last week, and the stuff in front here on the Goon is all honeycombing quickly now too"
