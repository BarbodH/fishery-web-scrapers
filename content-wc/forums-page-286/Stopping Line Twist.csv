3765401,larry0418,2015-04-14 10:17:00,16,"When I begin to see a lot of twist, I will run the spool out behind the boat w/o the lure - just bare line - and let it un-twist a few minutes while motoring. It will get the twist out for a while."
3773225,rnnonmt,2015-04-16 07:48:00,992,Im a baitcaster guy but have a couple ultralight spinning reel/rod combos that don't get much time on the water. I recently re-spooled them and I hate to admit it but all along I was putting the line on my spinning reels the same way as a baitcaster which caused extreme line twist. The line would shoot off the spool like a rocket when I released the bail. So hopefully you can use my ignorance to your benefit just incase you have suffered from my same mistake and didn't know why!
3773729,last chance,2015-04-16 10:32:00,3262,x2 on getting line twist out once it gets in. any time your using a spinning reel and the drag slips or you reel against the drag and not gaining line its going to twist the line. any time you spool new line on a spinning reel your going to put some twist in the line. after I fill my spinning reel with new line I go out to the lake and let out as much line as I plan to use off the reel with nothing attached to the line and just drive for a few minutes then reel the line back on the reel. that way your starting with 0 twists in your line. and this will also work if you put your line on like a baitcaster. but you have to let the line out very slow so it don't twist up as your letting line out.
3778593,CanoeHead,2015-04-17 17:59:00,22,"Spinning reels put a twist in line no matter what you do. That's just the nature of the line bending at the roller and being put onto a spool at 90 degrees to the rod. A good roller bearing can make a difference. Check if it spins easily. Was the line put on the reel correctly to start? If it wasn't, then running the line out the back of the boat will fix it. If you're using mono it should be the appropriate lb test for the reel. ""Limper"" versions work better then ""tougher"" ones. Fluorocarbon can be a real challenge for some. Braid usually is better for twists. A good swivel can make a difference if you're using spinners, spoons and jigs. And then some attention needs to be paid to the condition of the line, if it gets too twisted then run it out the back of the boat again."

3759369,longline,2015-04-12 19:16:00,5,"Would like to know how any of you keep line twist away while trolling or casting for pike. Have tried many different swivels, but still seem to have problems. We normally use spinning reels when we fish. Thank you for your input."
3759418,ftfarms,2015-04-12 19:25:00,444,We use reel magic. Spray your line every so often during the days fishing it makes a big differance.
3759729,mswope13,2015-04-12 20:38:00,73,We had the same problem using mono. Problem eliminated when we went to braid.
3761185,Walleye_Guru,2015-04-13 08:44:00,62,second that! Go to braid or spiderwire
3761361,Algoma Guy,2015-04-13 09:31:00,48,You stated you are using spinning reels.....make sure your drag is set properly and try not reel when you can't gain any line. The number one mistake people make while using a spinning reel is reeling against the drag. Try this it might help.
3761601,tv4fish,2015-04-13 11:06:00,2694,+100 -- Good post and right on.
3761761,Mark R,2015-04-13 12:00:00,1538,I was told that if you close the bail by turning the handle it will twist your line. Since then I have been closing the bail with my hand that isn't holding the rod.
3762121,longline,2015-04-13 13:31:00,5,Thanks for the advice. Can always count on WC for help.
3762153,camp chef,2015-04-13 13:35:00,915,Closing the bail by hand will create less stress on your reel components but the physics of the situation suggest that act of closing the bail one way or another should not have any affect on line twist.
3762225,BornToFish,2015-04-13 13:45:00,1224,"There is a lot of wisdom in the post from AlgomaGuy. You might want to carefully review if the line twist is from a certain lure or type of lures. You might find that the line twist is from certain lures or types of lures and not others. For example, many in-line blades create line twist when the bucktail rolls over. Several years ago, I bought a batch of bad quality ball bearing swivels. I made these into leaders and found that I was getting line twist. The swivels just weren't turning freely enough. You might want to check this aspect too. Also, are you per chance using the same rod and reel when jigging for walleyes? Vertical jigging will twist line faster than anything that I know of. If so, you might be twisting your line in this way, but the problem is presenting itself when you are fishing for pike. There aren't many things that will give an angler fits faster than line twist. I hope that you figure it out. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
