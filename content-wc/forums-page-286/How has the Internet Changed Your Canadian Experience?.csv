3749362,Carnhzkr,2015-04-09 16:21:00,964,"Beyond just the ""Canadian experience"", the internet has expanded the marketplace exponentially. I bought my boat from a listing on WC. The seller lives in a city about eight hours away. Twenty years ago, I would have had been limited to classifieds in the local news paper and calling area boat dealers listed in the Yellow Pages."
3744522,MrSimon,2015-04-08 13:22:00,922,"It's kind of a broad question, but I'm curious. Obviously there is more information out there, it's easier to contact lodges, easier to do research, easier to plan routes, and easier to share info with strangers. But is all that for the better, worse, or neither. What do you think?"
3744594,tv4fish,2015-04-08 13:41:00,2694,"My opinion - It IS a good thing. Forums like this one can provide a lot of ""feedback"" about the resorts/lodges/fly-ins that we may want to try. Without it, we would then have to rely on the marketing efforts put out by the resorts, etc. themselves. ""Word of mouth"" testimonials/advertising by customers is one of the best things for any business."
3744610,vteye,2015-04-08 13:50:00,812,My first 3 trips: Canadian Arctic - Char and 2 unguided float fishing trips in Alaska were pre internet. Subsquent trips have been further refined using the same basic formula. I value the opinions and wealth of info availablebecause of the internet in general and forums. One concern is the increase of promoters working directly on an outfitters behalf.
3744650,Draco1206,2015-04-08 14:01:00,175,"Without a doubt the internet has made things better when it comes to preparing for our fly-in outpost trips. From the information gathered from websites such as this one and from satellite maps, we are now able to put together a game plan before we leave instead of taking several days to learn a new lake once you get there. When we first started going to Canada we were lucky if we got a map at all from the outfitter. And most of those only gave a basic outline of the lake. Now with satellite maps I can see underwater reefs, drop offs, points, etc. I can get waypoints off the maps and put them in my GPS and go right to those spots when I get to the lake. Another great thing about the internet is I can now learn more about the outfitters and what they offer, their prices, lakes, boats, motors, fish species, cabin, etc. without having to call each one. I can learn how successful other anglers have been, the methods they used,and where they caught fish. One of the things I enjoy most about going to new lakes is trying to figure out where the fish might be and how to catch them. In the past you couldn't do that until you got to the lake and it might take 3-4 days of your vacation to figure it out. Now I can do it months before I get there. It also helps pass the long months between trips. Research, education, information. It's all good."

3744698,Walleye_Guru,2015-04-08 14:21:00,62,"The internet is invaluable when it comes to communicating to our guests. I am constantly updating them with reports, current conditions and changes in regulations that may effective their trip. I also love the fact I can share their pictures with the world. Guys that come back with their trophy catch know that their buddies at home will see those bragging rights pics that same day. It's also a common place where seemingly strangers can become close friends. I can't tell you the number of guests that have exchanged personal information after meeting at our lodge, and then stayed in touch using the web. Now they plan their trips together every year. It's a cool thing to see! Also, to dove tail off some of the other comments, the internet does allow for efficiency in communicating to inquires. It's easy to tell if someone is really interested in visiting our camp or if they are just kicking tires. If we know someone is serious, we reach out to them right away with a phone call, provide references and answer all their questions. In directly, that helps us focus our efforts and provide the best service to those who need it."
3744922,Freytown,2015-04-08 15:39:00,770,"I'm never going back to the pre -internet days...I'm a web junkie, lol. There is so much info on the web and once you make a few good connections the info transfer is ""priceless"". It does take time to sift through the BS and lock in with the good folks. Google maps, lake maps, ice out maps...OMG. This saves so much time that it's possible to get on fish as soon as you arrive. Walleye Central is a God sent and all the folks who provide us fisherman with this tool...my hat is off to ya."
3745306,Pooch,2015-04-08 17:39:00,4619,"My thoughts on the internet.I've met with numerous guys whom I would never have known without WC. Some I fish with or are in camp the same time as our group. We stay in touch all year around now.I've gone to new camps just from conversations here on WC.Information sharing has been fantastic learning tool for a bunch of us here on WC.Regardless of how stupid of a question I've posted here over the years, I've always got good information back and usually get my question answered.The internet has been tough on brick and mortar stores, but fantastic for everyone else. There are products out there that I never knew existed and would never have heard about them with the internet. The internet has changed our world about as much as any one other thing in my lifetime.Good post.Pooch"
3745354,btyreprich,2015-04-08 17:55:00,1067,"I remember the pre Internet days when going to the sports shows in the dead of winter was the first step in planning a fishing trip. I'd spend countless hours pouring over the brochures I collected at the show - as would my friends. We meet over a pizza a few weeks later yo decide which camp to go yo that year. After getting burned a few times, we decided to just stay at a lodge & lake that never let us down. When it came to our second trip of the year, we then decided to choose camps after checking a reference or two. Now with the Internet, you can do so much more research on all aspects of the trip to Canada: what lake to fish and when, what hotel to stay at on the ride up, where yo eat, etc. it's great to be able to pull from a vast source of experiences on this site."
3746690,Bigstorm,2015-04-09 06:45:00,799,"For me, the Internet hasnt changed much for our group. We have been going to the same place because we are happy with the service and fishing."
