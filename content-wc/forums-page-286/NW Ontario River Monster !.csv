3763961,v-bay gord,2015-04-13 21:07:00,3168,"As promised, some behind the scenes drama from the River Monsters season opener.... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOBtEetlBh0"
3765369,Carnhzkr,2015-04-14 10:10:00,964,"Bold of you to include that last shot of you and Jeremy. When you say ""behind the scenes"", you really mean it. Whatever you're into, I guess. Who am I to judge?"
3765601,v-bay gord,2015-04-14 11:20:00,3168,That's a sauna in the background.....just for clarification!
3745138,pjshorthorn,2015-04-08 16:59:00,5654,"Prov, Out of curiousity, over the years as a guide and fisherman have you ever been bitten by a muskie or pike? PjShorthorn"
3745162,prov1800,2015-04-08 17:02:00,5010,"Nope.onlywhen theve been in the net, but that was my own fault.lol."
3745266,v-bay gord,2015-04-08 17:27:00,3168,"C'mon! The dude in the garage being interviewed by Jeremy was totally awesome....and yummy! You are right about Scott Jaeger though.....I would totally recommend him as a guide on Eagle Lake....if you can book him. As the new owner of North Shore Lodge ( http://northshorelodge.ca/ )...his dance card might be pretty full. As far as the show.....well, to each his own. I just think it was pretty amazing to catch that fish the way he did, and with the native legend stuff thrown into the mix. I was there, so I know it was true!"
3755657,pike50plus,2015-04-11 14:15:00,584,"i had a similar experience on a Quebec bush trip. Fishing early morning in Rapids for walleye, 6 lb line, jig and no leader in an inflatable boat alone. Landed a 42 in pike, keep the piece of line that was still tied to the jib, it broke off about 6 in from the jig as I unhooked it in the boat. Great memory!"
3755673,rzep,2015-04-11 14:27:00,1196,"About 4 years ago, on the Eagle lake my wife caught 42-44 Musky while walleyes fishing. See pics. On one you can see the yellow jig on the side of the mouth. Seems as all the commotions of catching and throwning back fish draws in the Muskies. Took her probably 20 min to get the fish in on the 6-8 lbs tackle with 1000 Sedona. Thanks to the guide, we got the fish in.. I recalling tipping the guy pretty well that day."
3755977,Carnhzkr,2015-04-11 17:52:00,964,"I was swimming at the State Lakes outside of Fremont, NE and a bluegill bit my nipple. I could make some phone calls and Jeremy could stay at my in-laws' place in Fremont while he's filming ""Horror in the Heartland""."
3756137,Blue Lk,2015-04-11 18:26:00,269,I survived a savage bass attack a few years backhttp://vid631.photobucket.com/albums...vids/008-1.mp4 Perhaps Mr Wade should fish off my dock
3756185,Carnhzkr,2015-04-11 18:48:00,964,"""Behemoth at Blue Lake""?"
3756201,Blue Lk,2015-04-11 18:55:00,269,"[QUOTE=Carnhzkr""Behemoth at Blue Lake""?[/QUOTE]That pretty much put the end to ""skinny dippin"""
3756513,v-bay gord,2015-04-11 20:27:00,3168,"Geez, that ranks right up there with the Billy Balinski musky attack. I think there's potential for a Canadian Horror Part Two.........!"
3736018,KSauers,2015-04-06 15:11:00,385,"Well,they did fly into Rowan."
3736906,v-bay gord,2015-04-06 18:48:00,3168,"True, there was a period of time they spent fishing Rowan Lake, which is a fly-in. They also ""fished"" somewhere in Wisconsin (a bum lead in my opinion) where the river flooded and there was the ""secret"" spot. Out of two weeks I think they only fished on Eagle for 3 days....it was the last stop.....although in the show you are back and forth which I guess is creative license. Kudos to Bryce, my 15 year old dock hand who was pictured in the boat with Jeremy, as well as in the driving shots. He was impressed with his luck. Also some footage from inside the Bayview Hotel....lone guy at the table talking about another attack. There was also some footage in Bobby's parking lot. They say that over 40% of the audience for River Monsters is women.....supposedly because Jeremy is one hot dude....which is inspiring for the rest of us who are approaching the ""best before date""..."
3738386,Carnhzkr,2015-04-07 06:33:00,964,"Jeremy has better hair than me, and he's better looking when he keeps his mouth closed, but my teeth are way straighter than his. Orthodontists must have been in short supply in his native England."
3739146,bigwalleye1,2015-04-07 09:14:00,2632,"On topic, you guys have gotten me interested. I DVR'd a rebroadcast and I'm going to check out the show. Off topic, I've seen LOTS of people from England. No offense intended here, but I don't think the supply is short for Orthodontists across the pond, I'd suggest it's an overabundance of customers....."
3741146,Skywagon,2015-04-07 17:30:00,1106,"Gord, were those the petroglyphs at the entrance to Teggau? They at least looked similar."
3741298,v-bay gord,2015-04-07 18:09:00,3168,"No, those were on Delano Lake (Clearwater lake), which is connected to Eagle. For those Canadians who couldn't get the show here's a UTube site that appears to have it (for now).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4boMiLKZ7Q"
3741570,Blue Lk,2015-04-07 19:05:00,269,"Just watched it. I'm soooo ashamed,lived on Eagle for 15 years & let my kids swim in that monster infested water. Gord,have you & Brent got agents yet?"
3741610,v-bay gord,2015-04-07 19:16:00,3168,"You were lucky! I'm thinking the Bayview will have to add another sign: ""As seen on River Monsters"" That should be good for business. I wonder if I could charge people extra to sleep in Jeremy Wade's bed.....???"
3741786,rzep,2015-04-07 20:04:00,1196,I really think Jeremy and Rham Emanual (mayor of Chicago) are one and the same person...
3745090,prov1800,2015-04-08 16:46:00,5010,"I dont normally watch river monsters, now i know why.that was a lot of drama .lets see he came to vermilion bay to look for a twenty foot serpent.uhhuh.ok.thats acwaste of time.went to a reserve, not surecwhere but i assume it was eagleriver, they were playing there drums, ok that was cool.then there on a rock in eagle lake.i know that rock.then there in clearwater lake catching lake trout.then rowan for like 5 days.nothingvthere, back to eagle and hes fishing forcwalleye and catches a muskie with scott jaeger.**** he should of spent mire time on eaglecwith scott he woukd of had better luck.so in the end three myskies swimmjng in a row coukd have been interpreted as a twenty foof serpent.give me a break.oh yea some kid got bit by a pike or a muskie.that was a total waste to watch that show.sorry if iam offending anybody that likes the show, this is just my opion."
3734218,v-bay gord,2015-04-06 06:27:00,3168,"Well, it was interesting that the show's premiere turned out to only be in the U.S. Fortunately I was in New York City over the weekend and was able to catch it. Here's a few interesting bits that I can talk about. (Spoiler alert!!) The day of the musky ""catch"" was their last day.....they were pretty much giving up on being able to produce what they needed for the show. In fact there was no real ""musky fishing"" planned for that day.....just some underwater shooting around ""spirit rock""......which in no way shape or form can be considered a musky location. He actually did put tabaco on the rock before catching the fish......and yes, on a jig and minnow. Totally bizarre to have the combination of Indian legend and just plain luck work out in the end. It was a super windy day and to manage to land such a fish on 6 pound line does show that Jeremy is a good fisherman. Anyways it was fun to see some of Vermilion Bay, and Eagle Lake feature so prominently in such a well known show."
3734410,Draco1206,2015-04-06 07:21:00,175,"Landing that big musky on light tackle was awesome and the best part of the show. Overall I thought the show was a little ""hokie"". Reminded me of the Searching for Bigfoot and the Ghost Stories/paranormal shows. It looked like V-bay Gord could barely keep a straight face and not bust out laughing when Jeremy was interviewing him in his tool shed."
3734482,LOW1,2015-04-06 07:37:00,2828,"Great Show, fun to watch. Although I have spent considerable time appealing to the Spirit of the Lake and he/she/it has yet to produce for me."
3734570,jambi,2015-04-06 08:04:00,504,"The show made it seem like he went from Eagle Lake, to Rowan Lake, then back to Eagle Lake. Regardless, was glad he caught one. How long ago did that kid get bit at your camp?"
3734842,Carnhzkr,2015-04-06 08:52:00,964,Forget the minnow/leech/crawler debate. What type of tobacco works best for walleye? And where's that double-secret spot? The one where he didn't catch anything.
3734882,camp chef,2015-04-06 09:03:00,915,I thought it was a great show. I watched it twice. I actually caught my two biggest muskies on 6 # test with a Jig and crawler fishing for Walleyes. Nothing wrong with being a little lucky.
3735474,JayM5209,2015-04-06 12:03:00,1050,It's gotta be Five Brothers or Bull Durham.
3735498,SinOrSwim,2015-04-06 12:12:00,1528,"I don't typically watch that show but it was fun seeing areas that are familiar. Never fished eagle but have been past it on way to Lac Seul many times. I watched with my son. All was good until the kid attack in the water!!! LOL whoops. So, it begs the question is this serpent a real story? Also, I did get a kick out of the fact how they said it was in this remote area where the best way to get there was by float plane................or you could use the highway that goes by. Pretty cool all the way around though!!!! Gord is famous!!!!!!"
3735706,Carnhzkr,2015-04-06 13:12:00,964,"I forgot to bring that up. I laughed at that too. Eagle lake is so remote, the best way to access it is by float plane. I thought, ""or you could take the Trans-Canadian Highway that runs right by it."""
3735946,tv4fish,2015-04-06 14:33:00,2694,"In fact ""Rumor has it"" that a LOT of fishermen would sooner be lucky than good..............."
3634738,1/4 oz Jig,2015-03-10 12:34:00,90,"I must say I enjoy watching the show. I just have feeling that this river monster is the supposed fish of 10,000 casts. I'm just curious how this fish can kill someone. I guess that's why I have to watch the show!"
3634810,fishinnut 3446,2015-03-10 13:04:00,638,"I was thinking the same thing The lodge where we go to, owner last yr. caught a 53"" and got the whole thing on video, I have no doubt there are some monsters in there! One of the first yrs. going my Son caught his biggest walleye at 29 1/2"" and had bite marks on both sides."
3636970,rnnonmt,2015-03-10 21:53:00,992,Are you referring to one of the native girls??? Cant wait to see the episode!
3727178,pjshorthorn,2015-04-04 06:15:00,5654,Remember to watch V-Bay's worldwide television debut tomorrow night!!!! Does this mean we will all have to address him as Mr. V-Bay Gord from now on ??? D
3727298,fishinnut 3446,2015-04-04 06:58:00,638,"Just in case I forget, the DVR is set ."
3728834,Jul0682,2015-04-04 16:45:00,315,That's awesome. Can't wait to see the show and congrats of meeting such an awesome guy and such a great show as well
3728994,BuckeyeBill,2015-04-04 17:41:00,76,Got my DVR set also. Can't wait to see it !!
3733570,Carnhzkr,2015-04-05 20:49:00,964,I know one thing; I'm bringing some tobacco on my next trip!
3733746,JayM5209,2015-04-05 21:41:00,1050,"I know I will never again dangle my feet over the gunwale when I shut off the Merc to drift in the breeze of Eagle Lake, pour a cup of hot coffee and enjoy a cigar! 'Twas a great show to watch, especially identifying all the places where I've wet a line. Bet I could put you within fifty feet of where that lake trout was caught early in the show!Wonder if V-Bay Gord is going to have to hire a security detail to fend off the autograph seekers when he ventures out to downtown Vermilion Bay?!?! Well done, Gord!"
3734114,zeebee,2015-04-06 05:52:00,1144,From V Bay Gord to H Wood Gord.........good job. Missed the show in its entirety but watched the snips on the shows website. I will be on Eagle this Oct. Will need to remember the 6 lbs test.
3630114,v-bay gord,2015-03-09 09:43:00,3168,"I had the interesting experience last fall of being involved in the filming of a River Monster episode. The new season starts April 5th on Animal Planet, and I just found out the NW Ontario show is the premiere segment! Here's a link to a new season trailer... http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows...s-ssn-7-promo/ ""It had the intention to eat him!"".......says V-Bay Gord!! What is that all about?....."

3630482,Mike Borger,2015-03-09 11:35:00,1554,That is so cool Gord!
3633394,NWwalleye,2015-03-10 07:50:00,223,I am watching it ... got the date circled on the calender ..Thanks for the heads up Gord ..
3633482,fishinnut 3446,2015-03-10 08:05:00,638,"I guess I'll have to watch it also ! Gord, was it filmed on Eagle lake ?"
3633546,v-bay gord,2015-03-10 08:31:00,3168,"There were several locations, but the big climax occurs on Eagle Lake. Here's the crew at VBL."
