3749930,WalleyeMatt,2015-04-09 19:05:00,93,How are they in Sioux Lookout on Abrams and Minnitaki?
3749978,fishman10,2015-04-09 19:10:00,226,"Thunder Bay Area, 40 inches ish. Info from Thunder Bay fishing website. Shack renter on black bay of Lake Superior claims there is still 4 feet."
3750010,v-bay gord,2015-04-09 19:16:00,3168,"There seems to be plenty of ice here, but, I went out on the 4-wheeler and passed a very nice big hole into deep water. Was going to take some gas into portage lakes tomorrow, but I think I'll do it in the spring...either open water via boat, or by floatplane. No need to be the first to go swimming.....(although yesterday I saw a truck come off the ice....obviously an idiot)"
3751562,Walleye_Guru,2015-04-10 09:01:00,62,All the current sat photos show no open water yet anywhere but Superior. Probably early May as usual. PS - Hi Troy Mansfield!
3752090,Yaktumsqueegie,2015-04-10 11:18:00,17,The guy I talked to said the ice out will probably be normal ?? and the cars are still driving on the ice. so maybe it was just some fast moving water at the West end of Red Lake that was open.
3753066,Cil,2015-04-10 16:49:00,10,Ice out on pipestone lake will be 1st week of May no snow left anywhere and the water went through the ice so it is all honey combed and blue ice and going to go fast. It is going to start to heat to heat up this Saturday. Bring on the fishing season!!!!!
3753682,tackleman,2015-04-10 19:49:00,444,the neighbour said there was 24 to 30 inches on gullrock but it was getting punky near the bug river entrance to the lake.
3753866,fishman10,2015-04-10 20:28:00,226,They are still driving anywhere on lac des Mille lac. No problem. But tomorrow + 16 and warm all week. She will go fast.
3756505,Travis Schallock,2015-04-11 20:26:00,37,"I was out on Marshall Lake today, about a mile south of Ara and Meta. I measured 34"" total ice, 20"" good blue ice and 14"" slush/frozen slush."
3756529,Walleye_Guru,2015-04-11 20:36:00,62,Ugh!!!!

1414972,TroyMansfield,2012-04-01 19:38:00,92,"I was out on Lac Seul with a boat today, went up to Crooked Narraows and got into a mess of walleyes today, and also went and broke some ice to get to pickeral narrows and caught 20walleyes in there, our biggest was 26'' and alot of 18-21'' fish and 5 pike biggest was near 40'' the rest aroud 30-35'', wont be long till the ice is out fully"
1415389,115 optimax,2012-04-02 17:59:00,650,"Been pouring since 3:30 pm,ice is taking a total beating."
1415442,pickeralarm,2012-04-02 19:17:00,16,Troy where did you launch your boat on lac seul? Might try to get out this weekend
1415453,Gunner_Fletch,2012-04-02 19:28:00,74,Ice is out all the way to Keewatin Channel on LOTW. Hoards out fishing this past weekend. I'm guessing most gone by Easter Monday. Water level lowest I've ever seen.......most people would be lowering their boats on dirt from their boat houses. Good luck with that!
3748426,Yaktumsqueegie,2015-04-09 12:32:00,17,I talked to a cabin owner on the West end of the lake that indicated the ice is open in spots.
3749410,P&y only,2015-04-09 16:29:00,133,It's hard for me to know where everyone is. Please tell me your not saying we're having a super early ice out..Please.....
3749458,Yaktumsqueegie,2015-04-09 16:39:00,17,I only know what he said and that was guys were going to try to get some planes in via landing on water and taking off on ice. If that does not make sense maybe he is pulling my leg. All I can say is watch Bow Narrows for updates on the ice. I will e-mail my friend in Red Lake and get his observation on the ice issue.

1410350,BenBeattie,2012-03-22 20:58:00,232,Read in the paper here that a guy went through on Lac Seul up by Manitoba point. Said he walked 40k until someone found him. I did stand on the ice on Lac Seul today but it's in really bad shape. Won't be long now and boats will be out in force.
1412718,115 optimax,2012-03-28 00:18:00,650,"Cool and cloudy for this week,rain/snow mix.Will slow down the ice melting process.Need warm weather again,but with lots of wind this time to get the ice moving.Still way ahead of schedual for this time of year.Wont be too much longer."
1413111,Campcountry,2012-03-28 17:52:00,164,http://www.kenoradailyminerandnews.c...aspx?e=3517343 The ice is on the move.
1413743,Limeyangler,2012-03-29 20:39:00,563,Parts of Eagle are good to go. Will be out there on Saturday for 'eyes. Will post a report.
1413789,ManitouBass,2012-03-29 22:24:00,201,"Me and Harv have been fishing soft water for 2 1/2 weeks, jealous? lol, hope all is well on your end Limey, make sure you pm me sometime so I can head up there for some fishing."
1413793,115 optimax,2012-03-29 22:37:00,650,"Colder,and snowing like crazy right now!This SUCKS!!"

1414375,115 optimax,2012-03-31 13:11:00,650,"Rained most of the day,also a bit warmer.Sould help kill some ice!"
1414383,v-bay gord,2012-03-31 13:31:00,3168,"Still a ways from ""ice out"" here in Vermilion Bay!"
1414842,F250,2012-04-01 15:16:00,75,Just spoke to the lady at the desk of the Kenora Best Western Hotel. She advised the ice is gone from the Kenora harbor area.
1408285,bpetersen,2012-03-17 19:15:00,251,"You beat me to it, Dave. bigdog"
1408372,Fisherman1792,2012-03-18 06:44:00,927,"+ 11 degrees C here this morning @ 8:30 am and another thunderstorm rolled in earlier this morning. Snow is almost gone. Suppose to stay like this till the end of next week at least.Have not been on the ice in a while, but we only had about 2 feet of it and not really great ice at that. I could be on the water before walleye season closes in mid april for a month. Fisherman1792"
1408655,Guest,2012-03-18 21:01:00,0,"I was out to day and never seen ice melt so fast we lost 8 inches in 6 hours of fishing on eagle lake . Ice turned honeycomb and was getting really black. Temp hit 24C (about 77F) record breaking for March 18th. Anyone venturing on ice better becareful, I know I will be tomorrow picking up lake stakes. This is last day for me on the ice. Oh Ya, fishing was good - caught our limit! Russ"
1408760,TroyMansfield,2012-03-19 08:43:00,92,"Out on Minnitaki lake there is still good ice lots of places, but there is bad ice some places, anywhere there is current, we hauled our skid houses off yesterday, no issues at all, we used atvs to do the pulling, there seems to be at least 18'' of solid clear ice with the honeycomb slurry on top for 6 inches, its gonna go quick though it seems with this weather we are having, high of 24c today, Ill be out fishing today in the Rice River, open water at the narrows, but there is room along the shoreline to get in safely still. We slammed the perch, and walleyes over the slot there two days ago, and 4 pike over 40'', gotta get back in there before the ice season is over. good luck and be safe this time of year"
1409100,Skywagon,2012-03-20 05:11:00,1106,"I pulled my shack off the ice Sunday evening with the 4-wheeler, by last night (Monday) the ice was so bad I won't be back on it. Guessing ice out will be a month early on our lake."
1409385,TroyMansfield,2012-03-20 17:27:00,92,"I was out at the Rice River off of Minnitaki lake yesterday afternoon, there were 7 of us total. We caught 8 walleyes and 20 some perch, the ice was about 12 to 14inches still, but you could tell its on its way out, definiltey last time I have my snowmobile out for ice fishing, the lake has popped so there is no water,slush or snow for lubrication. ATV time for those still wanting to go out, biggest problem now is the ice at the shorlines are receding fast, so getting off and on is dangerous, and I think the ice is going to be unsafe very soon. I went to Big Sandy this morning to check ice conditions and did a little fishing, caught a few whitefish while were there. We brought ATVs with but only to get to shore, we walked out on the ice, the shorline is open where the trail goes out and the ice around the point is pretty thin, we tested it, the quad broke through, so I had to call my next group of 8-10 guys and tell them to cancel because of unsafe ice conditions, so there plan now is to bring boats before the season closes in April, gotta love the enthusiasm of fishermen"
1409482,Limeyangler,2012-03-20 20:14:00,563,"Ice on wabigoon has popped too....open water for all our shoreline. Walked out on the ice, still at least 12"" of clear hard ice, but its going fast. Like others have said...good ice for a few days but getting on and off will be the issues, looks like i'm gonna be able to test my new I-Pilot before walleye close....AWESOME!Now i have to keep an eye oon our new puppy......he's new to ice out!http://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...IMG_1232-1.jpg"
1409925,TroyMansfield,2012-03-22 01:10:00,92,"I was out on Louis Lake just north of Sioux Lookout a bit and several of us headed out fishing with quads and sled, and I will say that it was some ugly ice out there, pressure holes everywhere, shoreines going quick, narrows opening, and the fishing wasnt good enought to stay out till dark so we called it early and probably a ice season over for now, when we returned to shore we had fun getting off with the ice breaking off at shore at the beach, so we screweed around for a few minutes loaded up and called her a hardwater season come and gone, now maybe we can get some early boat fishing if the weather keeps doing what shes doing"
1409981,NWwalleye,2012-03-22 07:24:00,223,"I gave up on the hard water fishing on Tuesday, couldn't get on the ice that night ..My boat is ready !!! Got her all set up yesterday . We will most definitely will be open water fishing for Walleyes before the April 15th closer .."
1410307,Skywagon,2012-03-22 19:37:00,1106,I heard someone fell through at Bear Narrows (Eagle Lake) today and his friends had to throw him a rope. It's pretty well all over.
1407902,waterwick,2012-03-16 13:38:00,32,She's warming up. Here's a link to the Sioux Lookout weather. For our fishing buddies in the USA an easy way to convert celsius to farenheit is double the celcius figure and add 28. You will be within a degree of the actual farenheight temp. http://weatheroffice.gc.ca/city/page..._metric_e.html
1407919,jignminow,2012-03-16 14:20:00,168,you think the ice went out early last year? Just wait.
1407945,Manitou,2012-03-16 15:07:00,125,I'm 53 and this is the warmest shortest winter I have ever seen.The snow is gone here in Winnipeg.I hope to have a boat on LOTW in a 2-3 week if this keeps up.The earliest I have ever been on the lake is April 20.
1407948,jignminow,2012-03-16 15:16:00,168,was that last year? Wasn't ice out a month early?
1407958,IaDave,2012-03-16 15:51:00,476,"FYI Just click on th ""c"" by the the temp and it will change it for you."
1408045,Outfitter17,2012-03-16 20:24:00,127,"I am guessing its going to be a record year for ice out in my area and all the lakes within 2 hrs of the border. We only have 12""-18"" of ice right now on Lower Manitou Lake with no snow cover at all on the ice. We have 1""-5"" of standing water, once the ice pops and the sun and rain hit the ice it will be gone in no time. Our record was April 13 in 2010 and we are quite a bit ahead of that the way it looks. I am guessing April 5-8 range if the forecast doesn't change. Here are the highs for the next 9 days in Fort Frances 71,70,71,65,58,61,50,49,55 with rain 3 out of the 9 days. It hit 71 today, My yard is totally snow free and on Tuesday I couldn't see any grass.If you are still going on the ice, be careful."
1408075,ManitouBass,2012-03-16 22:02:00,201,"Stay off the ice now. For the most part, NW Ontario ice season is done. Don`t be silly people."
1408120,PRO-V1,2012-03-17 06:45:00,142,"The boys have started to pull shacks off of LDML the last couple of days, trucks are not going on the ice only quads and sleds, it's going to be a tough pull for some guys with monster shacks. Mike"
1408240,Cash,2012-03-17 15:17:00,73,"Are the water levels on the lakes back to normal? Did you get enough snow over the winter? The reason I ask is, when I was at Pickerel Arm Camp the 1st week os Sept., the lake was very low. I've been up there 20 times and have not seen it that low. Will the lakes be closer to normal this spring?"
1408254,BenBeattie,2012-03-17 16:25:00,232,water will be lower then last fall after ice out. thats how it always goes. they have been drawing water at the hydro dam at ear falls non-stop.
1406047,wallydave,2012-03-12 12:50:00,2151,"It looks like the Lac Seul area is getting some weather today! Is it rain, snow, or ""Wintery Mix""?, like the Weather Channel likes to call it! No matter which it is, things look to get mushy!?"
1406052,Busman,2012-03-12 13:08:00,146,I'm going to Sportsmans in Baudette this coming weekend. Hope they still have decent conditions.
1406097,ManitouBass,2012-03-12 14:34:00,201,"Rainy River is going out in record time, lol. Last week we had 35"" in between Baudette and Loman, now the river is almost fully clear. Especially east. Not too sure about past Baudette though."
1406143,BenBeattie,2012-03-12 16:06:00,232,"It rained today in Sioux Lookout, not a lot though. The sun and high temps for the next 10-14 days will really do a number on the ice."
1406172,ManitouBass,2012-03-12 17:03:00,201,It poured all day thus far in my neck of the woods Ben. High of plus 14 tomorrow and similar weather for the next week. The ice on Rainy River will be out in two days. Rainy Lake etc should be good for abit though
1406332,Limeyangler,2012-03-13 02:22:00,563,"Yup...rained all day here too manitou, i'm beginning to think i might be fishing walleye close in a boat again like 2 years ago...unbelievable really! Temps for this weekend up to 18C! Ice might be around for a while though, i seem to remember it was pretty cold at first ice with no snow....lots of good ice this year."
1406360,ManitouBass,2012-03-13 06:45:00,201,"Gonna be plus 21 over here Limey. I just walked down to the river with my coffee and I might be fishing as early as tomorrow. I still can't believe how fast ice out was. Like you said, it really was good quality ice this year. That being said, I have no idea if little fork river let go (it usually goes before Rainy), but there is almost zero ice drift???? Pm me your number again man, I lost all my info over at the other site. We'll have to meet somewhere up the 502 this year for some fishing. I've been scouting all winter, lol. Hope all is well and happy b-day to Jack!!!"
1406361,ManitouBass,2012-03-13 06:51:00,201,"I'd be making a phone call...I'm an hour and a half away and there is NO ICE.It might still be froze up there though (I'm an hour east).Worst case scenario, you'll be fishing from a boat!That doesn't sound so bad..."
1406630,BenBeattie,2012-03-13 17:40:00,232,I have no doubts that I'll be fishing walleye in a boat on Lac Seul before the season closes April 15th. Not saying the whole lake will be ice free (although at this rate it could be) but sections will be open for sure. It's getting HOT... supposed to be 70F on the weekend. Insane. I wasn't ready to say bye-bye to ice fishing yet.
1407200,nitroman,2012-03-14 21:13:00,368,Ten day for Kenora calls for highs at or near 60 and lows are above freezing cant imagine ice can hold on to long with that kind of weather!
1401407,Aaron-IN,2012-03-01 15:36:00,500,"Sorry if this has been discussed. Just wondering what the ice conditions are right now, has this been a normal year up there? Is it looking like an early ice out or too early to tell? I just know our winter down here has been very mild."
1401461,BenBeattie,2012-03-01 17:03:00,232,"Quite a lot of ice and snow here in Sioux Lookout. Hasn't been the coldest winter recently. No signs of thawing yet though. Still lots of ice fishing left! I would guess average ice out... i.e. not early, not late."
1401522,tackleman,2012-03-01 18:21:00,444,"I was on the ice in january in red lake and there was only 2 feet of ice, but then i left for sunny florida and the weather up here got colder, so i don't know how much is covering the lake now.i'm guessing the ice should be gone the last week in april or first week of may."
1401626,wallydave,2012-03-02 03:26:00,2151,"According to Rob at Cherob Resort in the Ear Falls section of Lac Seul, the average ice out is May 5th. Our group will be a little later than usual, so we hope for a late ice out!?"
1401674,bergsh,2012-03-02 07:17:00,183,I just got back from Red Lake on Tuesday.There is atleast 24 inches of solid ice. Plus a good 14-18 inches of snow on top of that.
1402083,The Canuck,2012-03-03 04:44:00,67,"Hey bergsh, how did u make out? Hope you caught some fish."
1403538,bergsh,2012-03-06 11:12:00,183,We didn't make out well at all. So much snow we couldn't get around. Will not go again without a snowmobile. Live and learn.
1405643,BenBeattie,2012-03-11 15:56:00,232,We are having a major warm spell. 2-week long term forecast shows unseasonably warm weather with lots of sun. Going to be an early ice out.
1405755,Skywagon,2012-03-11 19:59:00,1106,"I agree Ben, our road melted down to rock today. At this rate it won't be long until we trade the snowmobiles for 4-wheelers to get around the trails. Slush was a major issue on the lake we were on yesterday, got stuck in it once and was happy to make it off the lake."
1405833,TroyMansfield,2012-03-11 23:32:00,92,"definitley going fast, prolly be pulling the skidhouse off minnitaki this week, definiltey be spending the final weeks of ice, on the ice slammin em"
