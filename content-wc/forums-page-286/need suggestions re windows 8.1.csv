3771113,tackleman,2015-04-15 16:47:00,444,bought the wife a new computer and she had windows 8.1 as the operating system. the problem is that she used incredimail and had a heck of a time getting it downloaded. so she spent a day and a half with the techs at the geek squad getting it working. what they did was remove the Norton anti virus that they installed on it and that made the incredimail work but she only has 30 day free trial of macfee on it and we have paid for the Norton antivirus . I was wondering if anyone out there has had this problem and if so how was it corrected. any help will bring peace to the house.

McAfee is no better. Use a free solution, such as AVG or Avast, which are FREE and actually superior.I'd also recommend trying to find your wife an alternative mail client. That Incredimail looks pretty sketchy to me. However, since you already paid for Norton and your wife is probably attached to that weird email client, you really should try contacting their support team. You bought the software after all. I imagine there is a way to modify some setting in Norton so it bypasses the anti-virus check for Incredimail. Alternatively, ask on the Incredimail forums. I had a quick look there and didn't really find much, but I suggest posting there."
