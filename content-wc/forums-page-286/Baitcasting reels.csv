3747282,maddogg,2015-04-09 08:43:00,178,I'm thinking of getting a baitcasting rod and reel this year for Canada I mostly drift and jig. I've only used right hand spinning reels as of now I'm wondering how many guys use a left hand casting reel? I think it would be easier to use my right hand to fight the fish and reel with my left. Any thoughts?
3747354,jfaisten,2015-04-09 08:52:00,1060,I agree --I'm right handed and use left hand retrieve casting and spinning
3747418,Draco1206,2015-04-09 08:57:00,175,I crank with my left hand for spinning reels and right hand with a baitcast reel. It's just the way I learned many years ago when baitcasters were right hand wind only. My son cranks both reels with his left hand. We are both right handed. It feels strange for me to do it any other way.

3750186,bassnblast,2015-04-09 19:40:00,56,I crank left with spinning and right with baitcast. It's a good way to rest your rod-holding hand over the course of a long day/week of fishing...

3754889,zeebee,2015-04-11 08:23:00,1144,What the heck has a tiller mtr got to do with it ....u still need two hands to reel a fish in.U guys think before u post?

3755865,polaris-pete,2015-04-11 17:09:00,343,"have you ever tried to steer a boat with a tiller? REALLY REALLY hard to steer and hold the rod both. With a right hand reel, when you set the hook you have to switch hands.With a left handed reel it ready to reel using the left hand."
3760081,Aspencreek,2015-04-12 21:39:00,2911,"I get it, makes sence! But when I'm driving the boat (tiller) when either me or my partner gets a fish on, the boat goes into neutral, and I only have to ""drive the boat"" if the wind or waves is pushing us onto shore or some hazard. I want to fight the fish, not the boat and the current from my continuing to motor. Or is that just me?"
