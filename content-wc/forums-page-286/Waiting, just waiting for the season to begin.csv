For those owners who are in it for the long haul, we appreciate the opportunity to offer the NW Ontario ""experience""..... Hopefully that will continue into the future for you and we will see your kids as well!"
3767345,Walleye_Guru,2015-04-14 19:21:00,62,"Wow... never thought of it this way, but you are on target, big time. Good post!"
3768985,KevinSB,2015-04-15 08:18:00,73,"Thanks, Gord. And while this is a guys trip for now, I know my wife is interested in a trip and at least one of my two daughters would as well. Over time, I can see a spring guys trip and a fall family trip. Just too busy for now. But I'd definitely like to share the serenity of NWO with family over time. Thanks again for your help in making these trips happen!"
3738802,campchick,2015-04-07 07:44:00,96,"It has been a long, cold winter here in Northwestern Ontario and we will welcome Spring when it arrives. Right now the snow is all but gone from the lakes and we are down to glare ice. Hopefully warmer weather is just around the corner so we can look forward to open water in early May. Camp owners that can get to their properties are already working on building projects. Do you think it will be a ""good year"" for the tourism business?"
3738826,LOW1,2015-04-07 07:54:00,2828,"I think and hope so. My purely anecdotal sense is that the last two years have seen progress over what had been several lean years. Low gas prices and a good exchange rate have to help. Long range, I would like to see NW Ontario continue to transition more and more into an outdoor vacation/lifestyle destination instead of just a fishing destination. That will broaden the tourism business."
3739058,v-bay gord,2015-04-07 08:52:00,3168,I agree with your thinking. Any idea on what changes you would like to see that would head us in this direction?
3739114,Golden Eagle,2015-04-07 09:09:00,2642,We seasoned fishermen are going to show up as we had investments and made money in the market in spite of the recession. Young fishermen with car payments and home loans are not showing up in fish camps. It's not a good time to be a young fisherman and the future doesn't appear great for camp owners. Hoping we can turn things around. We need young bucks and does to take our place when we slow down.
3739138,oldfart,2015-04-07 09:12:00,21,"Be careful what you wish for...along with the increased tourism can come overdeveloped lakeshore, loss of fishing resorts to PUD's, opening more lakes to development, along with the increased retail facilities that come with it. There are many examples of this in N Minnesota...the ""Up North"" feeling and identity are lost. Plan carefully!!!!!!!!!!"
3739306,v-bay gord,2015-04-07 09:54:00,3168,"I agree with your sentiment as well. Last thing we want here is the overdevelopment as seen in the U.S......nor do we want a Disney World version either. Fishing is the big selling point right now, with scenery, isolation, clean water ect some of the fringe benefits. What needs to be done is to attract the folk who may not be that interested in fishing, but the other benefits could be what they want. Right now we don't do a very good job of reaching those people."
3739338,Ogoki,2015-04-07 10:09:00,291,"Golden Eagle, That is my exact thoughts too. At least in my area of the country it is that way. In the 1990's I knew of 58 paid fly in trips from my area . Some were two trips so there was probably around 40 different guys . Now those guys are dead, too old too go or just got tired of the cost. Their sons who went don't go either. My freinds sons ,like you said have heavy mortgages, small kids or kids in college. Our original group is doing canoe trips into Quetico. Only way some can affford to go. The quality of fishing on thses fly in lakes will probably get better as they sure won't have the pressure on them."

Im 36 and have been going with a group of young 30 somethings the past 8 years. This trip will continue! Its the only trip any of us guys do every year. Sure, we do plenty of vacations and other trips with our families, but this is the one trip the ""guys"" will continue to do. As far as the finances are concerned, hopefully the youthful folks haven't over extended themselves and make smart investments. Fish on!!"
3741850,Blades-n-Beads,2015-04-07 20:21:00,484,"I personally feel many folks don't expose there children early enough on a Ontario fishing trip. Some folks look for plush camps with tv, radio, Internet and gourmet meals. More of a Disney world setting as Gord stated, to each there own I guess, for me I started taking my children at a very early age and they all still look forward to our family trip every July, no tv, no radio, no Internet, meals are basic and tasty, it's the peaceful, quiet, relaxing camp we all long for. I would hate to see the remote camps get more modernized but if they must to keep the camp full I truly understand there reasons. Times change and so do we as we get older, I can't do nearly what I use to but sure try. I do feel the camps will all have a fruitful year with a better economy for all."
3765793,KevinSB,2015-04-14 11:57:00,73,"Just wanted to chime in to say that I agree that Canadian fishing is so fun in large part because of the remote setting. I respect owners' need to keep camps full but wanted to share my view as a random guy who fishes Canada. I'm a 43YO married male who heads to NWO annually; this will be our sixth year. We're busy with work, wives, and kids, and while we love all dearly (maybe not work as much as the others), we head to Ontario to have great fishing for a week. We rarely get to fish the rest of the year due to kids' activities so we need to schedule this to make sure we get in any fishing. My goal each year is to enjoy the serenity, have lots of fun catching fish with buddies, and having uninterrupted conversation with friends (and other returning and new fishermen at our camp). Maybe some year this will transition to include kids but for the foreseeable future it's where 40-something guys can get away and enjoy the beautiful scenery and fishing. Thanks to Gord and others who run camps or otherwise enable guys like me to escape north one week out of every year. And best of luck as you continue work to make camps profitable, whatever direction you take."
