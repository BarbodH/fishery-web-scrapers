3743994,Travis Schallock,2015-04-08 11:12:00,37,"It all depends on which sanctuary. Some close Mar 1, some Mar 31, some open June 1, others June 15. It all depends on what kind of pressure the MNR thinks the system can handle, and when the system get most of its pressure. Sanctuaries are also used to keep different user groups apart such as natives harvesting large numbers of fish in spring when licensed fisherman can't, thus preventing conflicts between the different user groups."

3744786,Walleye_Guru,2015-04-08 14:42:00,62,"Nipigon opens June 10th for walleyes.Onaman Lake opens June 1st for all angling. It's a sure bet you'll see me out on Onaman come day light on the opener!!!! (Oh boy, now I am excited!!!!)"

In fact, I've had a couple August days over the years when the Puzzle Bay 'eyes were there for the taking . . . in the weeds in only 3'-4' of water at midday. Also, the last mile of the road promises to be in much better shape this from what I hear."
3748506,bobbylfishermon,2015-04-09 12:45:00,241,"Thanks again guys, the ""big bite""has spoiled me, but like you say Jay, there's always fish around, and on second thought, a day in Puzzle bay chasing those jumbo perch around with a few wallys and northerns thrown in (plus a flask of 40 Creek in case of snake bite) well, does it get any better, I think not..... besides I'm a fish whore, ****, I fish for carp here in Nebraska, Thanks for the info Rick, we'll see you in a little over a month!!"
