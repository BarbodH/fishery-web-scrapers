I just didn't care for the many curves and changes of direction. I vote for 71, even if it is a few more miles. Bill"
3725010,Pooch,2015-04-03 11:32:00,4619,"I thought that was Canadian speak for ""Rest Area"" too. I think it's French/Canadian/USA dialect or something like that.Hey Bill K! Aren't you taking the really-really long way to O'Sullivan by going 71!! Or, do you retired guys just have time on your hands? :-)Pooch"
3725042,ftfarms,2015-04-03 11:40:00,444,Its 28 miles farther going up trans Canada 71 over to 105. Time wise there isn't much differance. (5-10 minutes) 71 is a much safer and nicer way to go. We do both usually go up one down the other. You do have two places on 11 west of the fort where the Indians have the speed limit slow for a while.
3725586,Pooch,2015-04-03 15:04:00,4619,Agree with ftfarms. We usually go up 502 and come home 71 when headed up the Red Lake road at VB. That way if there is a line backup at the border we are coming into the back of the line and don't have to go past and find a place to turn around.Pooch
3725794,port1042,2015-04-03 15:45:00,509,"We always take 71 since taking 502 a few years ago. In fact, on the way up we stay in Nestor Falls rather than International Falls or Fort Frances. It works out time wise for us. I like having a place to stop for breakfast on the way home too. Better roads, places to stop, and I think it more scenic. The 20 miles/minutes extra is accurate."
3725810,Carnhzkr,2015-04-03 15:53:00,964,"I understand your point, Pooch. It used to be that it made sense to take 71 for the return trip so you were going the same direction as the border traffic, however this has not been necessary for several years. Even though we usually hit the border at what I'd guess is primetime, about 11:30am on Saturday, I haven't seen the line extend past the first or second intersection in FF since they opened up additional stations for the Border Patrol four or five years ago. It used to be that the line extended west on Hwy 11 for a good ways when we hit at that time, and it was a PITA to come in from the east and make a quick U-turn at the end of the line. We'd wait in line a good hour in those days, but I haven't had to wait more than 30 minutes since. The line usually starts about at the railroad tracks."
3726154,Pooch,2015-04-03 17:51:00,4619,"When we were doing flyins out of Red Lake we would hit the border after lunch and most of the time would be by the cemetery or as far back as McDonalds in the border line. Have seen us set in line for up to nearly two hours. Hated it and was a factor in going to drive in lakes so we could hit the border earlier in the day. Now we seldom set in line for more than fifteen or twenty minutes since we hit FF late morning at the latest.Maybe later in the day border wait times are different now, but it sure was discouraging to set for hours waiting to cross when we still had a long drive before stopping for the night ahead of us.Your post recently about Friday to Friday would find me voting for the Friday to Friday camps in order to miss the Saturday turnover, but it hasn't been near the inconvenience that it was ten years ago. Pooch"
3728226,rather-be-fishin,2015-04-04 11:21:00,429,We go up 502 & come home 71. 71 is about 30-45 minutes longer. On the we way up we are in a hurry to get on the water fishing & not in as much of a hurry to go home.
3737546,cuamb,2015-04-06 21:37:00,203,"I have no idea how much longer it is to take 71 but I have driven both and 71 is much more enjoyable. For me it is because it just feels safer, and there are places to stop."
3771953,scar,2015-04-15 19:04:00,196,"Bstar, I sent you a PM as I am also from Minocqua"
3724090,Bstar,2015-04-03 06:58:00,564,Our group will be headed to Fishermans Cove on LS at the end of July. We've been there several times but not recently. We always went up 502 to Dryden. Is there any advantage taking 71 to Sioux Narrows to 17? Less traffic? Google maps says it's only about 15-20 miles difference. Any thoughts?
3724098,btyreprich,2015-04-03 07:03:00,1067,502 has parts of it that are quite scenic and is totally under developed. Some of the hills can be nerve wracking to drive on in heavy traffic when towing a trailer or boat. Just my opinion. 71 goes through towns and is therefore developed. Nice if you have car problems and such. We always take 502 to avoid traffic = but I can tell you 502 has more than it's share of traffic back ups and people taking crazy chances to pass others.
3724122,Bstar,2015-04-03 07:06:00,564,We did take 71 back to I falls once when 502 had construction going on. I remember that the road seemed in better shape than 502.
3724202,JDP,2015-04-03 07:30:00,1457,"I drove many times to Fisherman's Cove.In my experience Hwy 71 is a little longer of a drive.Given that 502 is in pretty good shape now, I would take 502."
3724210,SteveZ,2015-04-03 07:32:00,271,We go to Ear Falls each year and we try and steer clear of Dryden. There is a lot less traffic going the other way and it is a much nicer drive. There are a couple of rest stops along the way that make it nice. I believe it is a bit faster as well.
3724322,wallydave,2015-04-03 07:59:00,2151,The one year we took 71 one member of our group got a speeding ticket from Native Police. Ever since we have stuck with the 502. As mentioned scenic and less development. Either way the route you like is the best for your group!
3724370,Carnhzkr,2015-04-03 08:18:00,964,"A couple people mentioned that 502 is scenic. To each his own, I guess, but I don't see it. To me, the only scenic part of that highway is the S curve as you cross the bridge on the south end. The rest is curves, hills and trees. On 71, you pass several scenic spots along LOTW and the beautiful falls at Rushing River. There's only one ""official"" potty stop on 502, and that's about a half mile as you turn off of 11. That's probably only a concern if you have your wife along. We have to plan for that on my family trip. There is noting on 502 from the time you turn off of 11 until you get to Dryden, so make sure you have ample gas and snacks & drinks. As mentioned above, you pass a police station on 71 as you enter either Sioux Lookout or Nestor Falls, I forget which, but I know that always causes me to hit the brakes and check my rear-view when I see it. The biggest problem with 502 is the traffic snarls. You will certainly get into a long caravan of traffic behind several boat-pullers traveling together and it seems they always tailgate which makes it nearly impossible to pass. All that said, I've gone both ways and 502 is my choice. As far as avoiding Dryden, you can skirt around Dryden by taking Gordon Rd before you get into town. Avoids the entire city."
3724434,Bstar,2015-04-03 08:35:00,564,"I thought the ""pulp check areas"" we're the official potty stops on 502. I think we have stopped at almost everyone of them over the years!I think we're going to try 71 on the way in just as a change of pace and we're in no hurry since our check in time is 3 pm at Fishermans Cove. We'll probably take 502 on the way out since it might be a little quicker. We have a fairly long drive back to Minocqua, WI."
3724770,Carnhzkr,2015-04-03 10:09:00,964,That's a good idea. Time it both ways and post your results. I'm sure a lot of folks would be curious to find out which is actually the quicker route. My guess is 502 beats 71 by 30 minutes.
3724930,tv4fish,2015-04-03 11:11:00,2694,Well --- Of course they are
