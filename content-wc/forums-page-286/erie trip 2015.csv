I would appreciate any info on the subject.i have a 14 ft. boat ,neen protected water,prefer south eastern part of the lake(we are from ne pa)can go aug or sept,dont care about accommodations but want to catch fish.thanks."
3730562,jfaisten,2015-04-05 07:10:00,1060,In August or September the walleye are out in the lake -- much of the good fishing is in Ohio water that time of year. I don't think a 14' boat will cut unless you get a perfect day. You can catch walleye in the Detroit River where it dumps into Lake Erie -- drifting and handlining will get you fish and it is protected except for a hard south wind.

Presque Isle Bay is ideal for a 14' boat, and with the right weather conditions going out on the big lake for perch, Sm Bass and walleye would be ok. There are many free boat launches East and West of Erie and several in the bay. On a calm Aug. day the perch pack is usually located about 3 miles of Seagull point and I have counted near 100 boats in it. Many small boats are there, even saw a fellow fishing off a jetski, 30 fish limits are common Seanik"
