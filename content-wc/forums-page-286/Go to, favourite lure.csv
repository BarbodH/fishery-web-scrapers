3754921,packpro,2015-04-11 08:37:00,695,"For catching I like a jig. Once we have the freezer and shorlunch covered ( usually about an hour in Canada). Then it's fun fishing. The jig bite is subtle. The lure bite is vicious/exhilarating. 6"" power bait/ paddle tail on a weighted hook. So versatile and selects for bigger fish. In one hour, on one good shore line drift, 24"" walleye, 18"" Smallie, 36"" pike. All caught 25 yards from then boat. I always have one baitcaster rigged and ready to go. Not to mention, you gotta love that ""zing"" when you buggy whip that bad boy out there."
3751722,Walleye_Guru,2015-04-10 09:24:00,62,fishman10 - come see me in the fall. I think I could convert you. I'd enjoy the challenge...
3751794,wmd,2015-04-10 09:39:00,388,"couldn't agree more, well said. wmd"
3751842,Algoma Guy,2015-04-10 09:58:00,48,Jigs when the water temp is cold......bottom bouncers and spinner rigs when water temp is warm. Pretty hard to beat either rig in those conditions.
3752466,fishron,2015-04-10 12:57:00,317,"I've found that different presentations work on some lakes and not so well on others. On last years fly-in we were told that the lake was one to ten in favor of jigging. They were right! My usual presentation for walleye is a trolled hot'n'tot. Watching that rod tip vibrate and double over on a strike is exciting to me. If the depthfinder lights up with fish just prior to the strike or at any good looking spot, a second rod is always ready with a jig. I don't find one method more pleasurable than the other. Trolling covers water and finds fish. Jigging usually puts more in the boat, (not always). When I troll I'm more aware of my surroundings an see more neat stuff. When I jig my senses are on the feel and my eyes rarely leave the rodtip."
3752554,Freytown,2015-04-10 13:37:00,770,I'd be curious to see the choice if we could take only one lure type to Canada. I'd be torn between the jig vs the spoon. I believe that a spoon could offer a bit more options.....soooooo. #1 - Spoon.
3752562,Freytown,2015-04-10 13:41:00,770,Drifting can move one around the pond. Snap jigging with a slow troll. Fan casting covers ground too. PS: Leave the anchor on the dock next time.
3753018,eyemike,2015-04-10 16:36:00,233,"Not even a second choice, it would be a jig. The techniques used to work that jig is unlimited. I get bored fishing a jig I change the tail."
3753178,jWN,2015-04-10 17:20:00,62,Lazy Ike yellow with red dots. If you doubt me try one but only good up to 8ft or so.
3753194,jWN,2015-04-10 17:21:00,62,Oh ya number 3 size
3753282,fishman10,2015-04-10 17:43:00,226,"Sure, book the cabin and the boat guide, food, oh and the beer, I'm Canadian.hahaha. I'll admit, fall time is a good time to jig as the walleye go deep over sharp drops. So tell me, are you buying the beer???"
3748442,fishman10,2015-04-09 12:33:00,226,"We all have our favourite s, our go to lure,bait spinners etc. the ones that have produced for us over the years. Our confidence is high when we use these lures. For me: when trolling, the hammered brass or gold spinner. An all time favourite. Jigs: 1/4 ounce, for murky water, white head with a white grub tail or a chartreuse and orange head with bright tail. All though I must have 50 + raps etc, I find I don't use them much.( I don't know why) So what are yours?"
3748522,HeHooksHimself,2015-04-09 12:46:00,725,"For crankbaits, my favorite is the Rapala X Rap (12 size) in the perch color. Deadly for spring lakers, walleye and northerns. I have a bunch of others but this is my go to."
3748626,bkw67,2015-04-09 13:06:00,70,"Little Joe - (Red and White) on a bottom bouncer (Walleye and Northern)Hot N Tot's - Met Silver/Red Herringbone for Walleye and [unfortunately] one that is no longer made for Northern (Plastic ""reflective"" lip, Yellow eyes, dark top, lighter side and red at the mouth) I only have one left. Anyone have one or more they are willing to part with??????"
3749738,jaximus,2015-04-09 18:00:00,117,"trolling: hot n tot mad flash, any of the UV/glow colors. jigging: 4"" chartreuse ring worm on an 1/8oz orange jighead"

3749834,pikeman14,2015-04-09 18:42:00,144,Bill Lewis rattle trap in silver blue. Somehow always use it to test the waters.
3749898,eyemike,2015-04-09 19:00:00,233,Road Runner jigs. Just a ton of walleyes on these over the years. Pike like them too.
3750594,JayM5209,2015-04-09 21:02:00,1050,"- Road Runner jigs, usually yellow or chartreuse- bottom bouncing spinner harnesses with chartreuse/red diamonds five o' diamond pattern or gold French blade- Dave Storm's Kaboom Shiner in water melon color."
3751434,Walleye_Guru,2015-04-10 08:29:00,62,"I like to Jig... alot! When I get tired of jigging, I usually just tie on a jig and do some more jigging. But if jigging doesn't work, then I might shake things up a bit and throw a jig on. If that still doesn't work, I go to my tried-and-true method... jigging. I jig for lakers, pike, brookies (just recently), whitefish, and, your not going to believe this, walleyes. It, by far, is the most enjoyable way to catch fish. Your active in the hunt, you feel the hit and the reward from the challenge is out of this world. So my vote is a jig! But if for some reason that doesn't work, try another jig."
3751522,fishman10,2015-04-10 08:53:00,226,"Personally, I find jigging boring, sitting in 1 spot and waiting for the fish to come to me. I fish more aggressively, I go after the fish, bottom bouncing with a spinner, working structure, working with electronics. Covering new water until I find them, I just find it more enjoyable."
