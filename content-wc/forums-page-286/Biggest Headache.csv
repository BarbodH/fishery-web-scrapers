I've watched them come in and watch a group of boats. As soon as someone catches a fish, they start to move in. Not my idea of a ""guide"". I look at it as I work too dang hard for this trip to have someone do that to me, and obviously others. Now if it is a new group, especially a group with kids, or even a group who is struggling for the week, give me a map and i will put you on fish or have you tag along. I know what weeks of not catching fish are like. Common courtesy goes a long way...especially when you might be 20-30 miles from a boat ramp."
3743514,pjshorthorn,2015-04-08 09:36:00,5654,"Walleye Meat: I've fished that part of Lac Seul quite a long time and have seen Anderson's doing the same thing to other boats around Manitou Rapids and in Chamberlain Narrows. I've never had them crowd myself though. What part of the lake ( in general terms ) do you normally like to fish? I fish between three sisters / Kekabeka Narrows all the way up to Wapesi. Just curious where they are typically crowding folks so I don't end up in the same situation when I go back to the area. The last time a boat horned in our drift that included 3 boats from our group, a 20 inch northern was returned to the water across their bow. They left pretty soon after..... Thanks, PjShorthorn"
3744482,MrSimon,2015-04-08 13:10:00,922,"Over the years our biggest headaches came from vehicles, trailers, and boats. Ironically, those headaches also gave us the best stories and memories. Nowadays, our vehicles and boats are in good shape and cause very few problems. On fly-ins, the outfitter handles about everything and those trips are stress free. We've never had the slightest issue at the border .... so no stress there for us. All in all, at this point, trips North are nothing but fun and relaxation. Very very few headaches."
3744642,fishman10,2015-04-08 14:00:00,226,Perhaps this is a complaint from the guides at Anderson's? The people that fish so close to us?. Who was there first? You or Anderson's? I am quite sure that many fisherman have stolen waypoints and followed the guides around the lake. 2 sides to every story.
3744930,Guest,2015-04-08 15:41:00,0,"There are two sides to every story...i know the truth and i have not given any misreprentations. Every time this has happened to me, someone in our group, or someone else we've witnessed, the Anderson boat creeps in. Never have i seen another boat encroach on them. Its one thing when you are in one area and there are 20-30 boats in one pocket but I'm talking about a HUGE open bay with points, drop offs, you name it gallore, no other boats in sight...and they come sit on top of you."

3742282,michigan walleye guy,2015-04-07 22:59:00,95,"My concerns:Like a lot of people, my number one concern is the weather. Last June, we weren't able to fly out on the 14th, due to pouring rain, and losing a day of our trip was disappointing. But this was the first time in about 20 trips that this has happened. And the wind speeds, once we get to the outpost. I can handle cold, rain, heat, etc., but high winds that keep us confined to camp are no fun. I'm talking the 20-30 mph stuff, that absolutely kills any and all game plans for the day, especially when the outpost boat and motors are usually fairly modest in terms of being able to handle the big winds.Weight constraints for the flight in. Like a lot of people, I pre-order the beer and pop, and have it flown in ahead of time, but it's rare to not be sweating things as everything gets weighed in.Getting across the border is probably number three. But leaving early enough in the morning to allow for possible delays usually makes the crossings fairly uneventful. But its all worth it. Once the plane has dropped us off, once the unpacking is done, once the beers get cracked and the rods get assembled, and once that first jig and minnow cast hits the water, it's truly like being handed the keys to heaven. Only 52 days till Larus Lake."
3742602,Guest,2015-04-08 06:01:00,0,"1) Safe travels -truck, trailer, and boat 2) Weather 3) Whether or not the a-hole ""guides"" ( and i use that term loosely) from Anderson's out of Sioux Lookout are going to come camp out litterally 20' away from our boat. We have all kinds of spots on LS but I swear these jack@$$es have my waypoints. Every year they do it and i just can't get away from them. As long as #1 holds up, we don't worry about wait times at the border. For the past 10 years or so, i bet we have only seen 75-100 vehicles combined going across and coming back. The last three years on the way back we were the only ones. Years before that we would have to 1-3 ahead of us."
3742690,tv4fish,2015-04-08 06:37:00,2694,"Walleye: We have had the same issues - after the second time - I took some pics of the Anderson boat and how close it was to us (so I could describe the guide). Then I proceeded to call Anderson's and let them know how I felt - doubt it did any good, but I felt a lot better (AND - at least Anderson's KNOW what their guides are up to -- pi**ing a lot of people off)..........."

3742898,btyreprich,2015-04-08 07:30:00,1067,"With regards to ""guides"" that crowd you on lake spots, might I suggest the following. Have a bait casting rod & reel set up and ready to use in the boat. As the other boat starts to crowd you, someone needs to start casting in their general direction. This has worked for us and I am happy to say there have not been any verbal exchanges when the lures start flying. Just a non spoken message to back off. With a lake as big as Lac Seul, there is NO reason for anyone to crowd another boat."
3743170,tv4fish,2015-04-08 08:21:00,2694,"When the guide has an entire family with young kids in the boat - we did not feel that would be appropriate (although, I admit that thought crossed my mind)............."
3743202,bthomas3333,2015-04-08 08:27:00,465,Is it just me or when a guide does this I really question their ability to guide. Are they really so limited in their knowledge that they can't quickly go to another spot? I don't know LS that well but can't they just run to another spot in 15 mins?From an overall perspective how are guides found and do they really know the water they work well?
3743218,Guest,2015-04-08 08:36:00,0,"Their guides don't care. I've got the ""uou don't own the lake"" b.s. many times. I've been very polite which lead to me being asked to ""settle this on shore."" I have said it before, i would rather not go up to Canada than have a free trip to Andersons. Like TV, I too have discussed his with the owners and have been brushed off every time. Classless organization and the owners should be ashamed of themselves I just don't get it. Lac Seul is HUGE!! Why do they need to come sit down right on top of another boat? Or if they want the spot, they will try to crowd you out. There are too many spots for them to do this."

3736290,btyreprich,2015-04-06 15:58:00,1067,"When we had our boat, it was the leaky transom. Near the end I purchased an extra bilge pump to have on hand should one give out. Next would be the trailer / tow vehicle. Had to change a flat tire on both over the years. The changing of the truck tire on Highway 502 EARLY in the morning was quite memorable. Never experienced so many mosquitos in my life! Final concern was what was happening at my job while I was gone. The lodges that have wireless internet allow me to check emails early & late in the day. Helps put my mind at ease knowing there will not be a major ""fire"" when I come back to work. As I read these posts - and just speaking for myself - I have to count my blessings in life. I earn enough to take a trip once a year with my son, God son, & best friend. My health is good enough to carry more than my share of gear to & from the boat each day. Our neighbors to the north allow us in their country for memorable vacations each & every year."
