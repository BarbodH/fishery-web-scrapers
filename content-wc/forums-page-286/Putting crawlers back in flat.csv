3768401,bigwalleye1,2015-04-15 06:01:00,2632,"Because if there's one partial, dead, or sick crawler that comes back from the boat trip, it'll kill every crawler in the flat. Better to keep them in a separate container to be used first."
3768569,Pooch,2015-04-15 06:55:00,4619,"Once crawlers leave a healthy flat and spends a day on the water keep them in the boat container and put it back in the fridge. If you have plenty of worms pitch the unhealthy ones as they will continue to deteriorate and kill whats left of the healthy ones. Half dead worms will kill a flat in days. Better to lose a few than an entire weeks worth of bait trying to penny pinch. If your in the boat and have a sickly looking worm, use it now or throw it overboard.Always keep all bait cool all the time. We have one cooler just for worms and leeches.It's worth a little extra attention to have good lively bait the entire trip. Unless you are really confident with plastic....Pooch"
3769025,JayM5209,2015-04-15 08:28:00,1050,"Pooch and bigwalleye1 have nailed it. It's amazing how quickly a dying crawler, one that got too warm during the day, or that half that got tossed back into the boat container can kill off a whole flat if returned to the camp container. Two additional items - I don't like using refrigerator space for a flat of crawlers, and a larger container makes removing the day's supply less likely to result in bedding all over the floor. For a week long trip I buy a cheap styrofoam cooler (or use a styrofoam shipping box for meds if you have access to them) and fill with new bedding. As soon as I pick up the flat of crawlers, they go into the larger styrofoam container with fresh bedding and an ice pack is added on top. Every day when crawlers are picked out for that day's fishing, a fresh ice pack is exchanged. At the end of the week any crawlers remaining are as fresh as when the week started.P.S. Don't store the crawler box under the cabin or on an unenclosed porch. A skunk or racoon will find them!"
3769441,dukntz,2015-04-15 09:50:00,11,"I agree with what's been said, but if I have lively crawlers that I want to add back to the larger storage container, always dump them on top of the bedding. Then check then in hour or so. Any that haven't crawled back into the bedding by then get pitched. You can also use your nose to check Health of the container. Sickly crawlers give off a gas that sours the whole box in short order if not removed........"
