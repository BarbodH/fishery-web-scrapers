3759449,ftfarms,2015-04-12 19:44:00,444,Me also. Jig and bait no plastics
3760593,forgop,2015-04-13 06:10:00,880,Berkley Gulp Alive minnow....yeah or nay?
3760649,pjshorthorn,2015-04-13 06:20:00,5654,"Never tried it so I have to say nay. Never saw the need to use plastic when natural bait works so well. Granted, it an be pricey but that is a small part of the overall cost of a trip for myself. PJShorthorn"
3760657,forgop,2015-04-13 06:21:00,880,I already have some. Thought I'd give it a try and see what happens
3760697,ftfarms,2015-04-13 06:30:00,444,Thay work; I like the leeches also. When we fish moving water areas is where thay are at there best I like the ones from northland tackle the best.
3761177,Walleye_Guru,2015-04-13 08:42:00,62,"Tested it time and time again. When searching for fish, use the live stuff. Once on an active bite, you can switch to plastics and do well. Rarely (i.e. never) have I seen plastic out preform live. Both have their pluses, but if given the choice I'd take live over artificial every time. My preferred is my custom made, 1/4oz orange and yellow jig, tipped with a dace minnow. My preferred plastic is a 3"" white or green grub. Ring worms work well to if you're snap jigging."
3745754,forgop,2015-04-08 19:27:00,880,"Do you find that you have better luck with certain colors in Canada than you do with colors that produce for you in the states? Is there a favorite you always start off with no matter where you go? What is your favorite type/size for jigging in Canada? Luckily I packed a Mr Twister grub kit and had some jigs last year without having ever attempted it. Grubs were 3-4"" and the jigs were the Reel Bait flashers I got at Cabelas. Luckily the group of Russians who were there before us had written up their daily tally but drew a picture of a jig with a grub with YELLOW!!! in all caps (and the only thing in English). We took that as a sign and sure enough, we were catching fish with yellow grubs in no time. We didn't switch up colors too much, but can't say we tried anything other than varying shades of yellow and white with 1/2 crawler. Our trip last year was in early August and I'm going back in mid-June to a different camp this year. Just curious if there was a method to your madness of determining how you go about getting them to bite."
3745778,Knoxabilly,2015-04-08 19:32:00,225,"I usually use 1/8 or 1/4 jig heads- gold plated, red, orange are typical colors. For the twister tails 3-4"", Yellow, Chartreuse, White are my main but I have every color under the sun it seems! These all seem to work great in the murky waters of Lac Seul- I tip the jigs with a minnow or leech also. If the bite is real slow then I lose the twister and just got live bait."
3747042,tv4fish,2015-04-09 08:06:00,2694,"With my group of 3 - we each will start out with a different color jig (we pretty much vertical jig while doing a controlled drift). IF one guy seems to get more hits than the others, we will switch to that color, otherwise we will stick to what we have. We usually go as light as we can, depending upon the wind. It seems that we have found that the northerns up on the part of Lac Seul that we hit prefer white - so we don't try white very often............"
3747226,maddogg,2015-04-09 08:33:00,178,Old standby 1/4 oz green chartreuse jig with a 2'' yellow double twistertail.Try different colors you never know. One day we cleaned up with a fluorescent orange jig with a purple double tail. Ugly but the walleyes liked it.
3748346,green&orange,2015-04-09 12:15:00,28,Chartreuse twister tail with a chartreuse head is always an old standby. We always start with that and go from there.
3748642,adempsey,2015-04-09 13:11:00,963,"My experience has been that white and pink always work. So, that's what I start with.If I am not successful, I will sometimes change to a pumpkin with flake or just randomly pick something. I usually have a variety of colors like chartreuse in various forms, black, green pumpkin and brown, with and without flake, to try.Of course, I often will change tactics before I change my grub color.I don't rally pay attention to jig head color. A lot of my jigs are white, pink or black though."
3748802,KSjim,2015-04-09 14:03:00,88,"We are partial to Kalin 3"" grubs. We like to have a variety of colors but we buy orange, white and firetiger in 100 count bags. The other colors in 20 count bags. It seems like we run out of each color about the same time this way."
3749722,jaximus,2015-04-09 17:55:00,117,"i use 4"" ringworms for 90% of my soft plastics. tannin stained water i start chartreuse on an orange head. clear water i start brown with a chartreuse tail. i have pretty much every color you can imagine. dirty water is usually chartruse/white/pink clear water is usually brown/silver/dark green head color usually matches the tail portion if the tail is different than the body, but thats mostly just me being weird"
3753442,jaym,2015-04-10 18:31:00,89,"My favorite is a silver plated jig head and a 4"" chartreuse glitter twin tail grub from Cabelas. Others in our group dabble with different colors but I usually catch as many or more walleyes with that combination."
3755561,P&y only,2015-04-11 12:44:00,133,"honestly, the best color for me has been no color at all. I've tried everything and i'm pretty certain I catch more with just a minnow or crawler on a jig head with no plastic."
