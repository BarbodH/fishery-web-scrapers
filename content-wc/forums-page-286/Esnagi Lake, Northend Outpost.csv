Is esnagi a clear water lake or heavily stained . we jig plastics, any colors better than others. we do a bit of bottom bouncing with harnesses and spin-n-glo's also bounce 3.5 & 4"" original rapalas. Any tips or responses that would give me a edge over the rest of the gang would be appreciated. Thanks Halfmoon"
3763113,Mauserbowser,2015-04-13 17:49:00,6,Nothing good happens for a fly-in lake that has been accessable since 2000 by the logging industry roads making both Gourlay and Shekak available to atvs and four wheelers. The days of driving from St STE Marie to White river and WAWA and having great fly-In walleye fishing ended long ago. Do yourself and your checkbook a favor and drive farther north and west and you will increase your fishing success 100%. My buddies now go up north of Geralton and they tell me the size and numbers increased dramatically and the fly-In prices were the same. They said it was like going to Shekak and Gourlay back in the 1980s. They will never return to the White River area....it is fished out and they weren't real happy sharing the lake with guys who didn't pay the money to fly-in and launched their boats from homemade launch sites. WRA WONT TELL YOU THAT TIDBiT OF INFORmATION. WRA AIR WAITED WAY TOO LOOK TO IMPLIMENT A SLOT AND then THEY NEVER ENFORCED it.
3763369,Mike Borger,2015-04-13 18:36:00,1554,"If people are accessing the outfitter lakes other than by snowmobile in the winter then they're doing so illegally - unless of course they're native. As far as the quality of the fishing goes I've never had any trouble catching lots of fish myself on any of their lakes. Beyond that I've helped numerous people book trips with WRA and have heard nothing but positive comments. One of my best friends fished Gourlay last summer with his family and they had a fantastic trip. If anyone's interested he posted a nice write up about the trip on my website:http://www.canadafishingguide.net/fo...ite-river-air/ The only thing I'll say is most of the lakes in the Wawa/White River region are on the smaller side. I've done plenty of trips in this region but all have been 4 night trips - I'd get bored going for a full week. If you want to fish bigger water then yes, you have to go further north. Personally I think they offer a great experience at a very good price and in my estimation they're darned nice people as well."
3763769,Mauserbowser,2015-04-13 20:26:00,6,"I fished Gourlay in the Summer of 1973 fresh out of high school........We 3 guys caught over 150 walleyes EVERY day and put back what we didnt eat. No wallyes under 18 and always multiple wall hangers every day. The biggest Northern I caugth was 48 inches. The chance of that lake producing those sizes and numbers is now is somewhere between slim and none. I fished it again in 1987 and it was disapppointing and very average. If I didn't have my Eagle 6100, we would not have found the fish. Caught just enough to eat every day. Then we switched and the group started going to Shekak in 1990 as I went with them in 1994. The results results were small walleyes and not a huge number of them as I had a Lowrance 350a. The last time the group went to SHekak was I think in 1999 or 2000 and by then they poor fishing was considered untolerable and they went up to Luenbergers's Air. WRA had a major screw up and mixed up our propane re-supply bottles with somebody elses mixed gas. Hence we had tons of gas but no propane fridges for 4 days. They refunded us $200 per man. As I have reached 60 years now, I only go to fly-in or drive in American plan lodges. I have went to two drive in American plan lodges and 3 house keeping cabins AND the fishing was equal to or greater than any WRA fly-in trip but less than a far north fly-in. the point I am making is encroaching civilization and the timber industry has made good fly-in lakes acccessable to the ""wheeled"" folks, legal or illegal, it doesn't matter. As a side note, the WRA pilot that flew us in in 1994 crashed a float plane and 4 people including the pilot drowned with one guy being a prosecuting attorney from Grand Rapids, MI and his son."
3763881,Mike Borger,2015-04-13 20:47:00,1554,"I've fished all over Ontario, have done well over 50 fly in trips and have always enjoyed my experiences in this region. I still have a hard time believing that locals are driving in and fishing these lakes on a regular basis. I've never seen it and as mentioned it's illegal unless you're native. The fines are huge. Regardless I'll be interested in seeing how my experience at Shekak this summer jives with what you're saying."
3770537,10lbeye,2015-04-15 13:59:00,61,"Halfmoon: The 3 best outfits I've seen on this lake, in no particular order are: jig and leech with or without a twister (jig and crawler a close 2nd); Plain Lindy rig w/ a leech or crawler. depending upon mood, I've seen the lindy outproduce the jig on that lake; and..... Believe it or not, a Thin Fin in silver/blue or fire tiger pattern. Someone I went to Esnagi with who's fished that lake for YEARS swears by the Thin Fin as his go to search bait. He will troll weed edges to locate walleyes, then jig or rig at that spot. It is a great search bait because you can fish flats and weed edges relatively snag free and even over tops of weed edges. A small split shot 18 in above the leader will get it down a few more inches. I've caught a ton of walleyes there on that bait. I have also had lots of success vertically jigging bladebaits (1/4 oz). Finally, the silver Williams Wobbler is killer on Esnagi for pike (along with that Thin Fin..). Hope this helps."

3727794,unclepaully,2015-04-04 09:31:00,112,"I was wondering if any of you have stayed in White River Air's Northend Outpost? Due to a scheduling conflict we had to switch up our destination. Originally it was going to be Shekak lake but now we will be flying into the Northend this coming August. I had a ton of info gathered on Shekak but now I am starting over with Esnagi. I did use the search function here and on other sites. Also watched a bunch of videos on Youtube and the like. I was wondering if anyone had any info on that end of the lake. I know the lodges are all down at the opposite end. For those of you who have stayed in the Northend outpost, how would you rate the experience. Thanks ahead of time for your responses."
3728050,Mike Borger,2015-04-04 10:39:00,1554,"Would love to hear about the Northend outpost myself!Ironically I'm fishing Shekak myself in late July this year, going in more or less blind. If you have any intel on that lake I'd love to hear it."
3728306,unclepaully,2015-04-04 12:12:00,112,"Mike I talked with several different people who had been to Shekak over the years. I will gather all that info and pm you. Originally we were suppose to fly in two weeks after your week in there. I was looking forward to getting the info from you, lol."
3728346,Mike Borger,2015-04-04 12:35:00,1554,"I'll figure things out, it's not a huge lake. No doubt I could've marked things up for you. Any info you have would be great though, thanks for doing my research for me LOL!Hopefully someone chimes in about Northend."
3728354,unclepaully,2015-04-04 12:38:00,112,PM sent Mike.
3730226,10lbeye,2015-04-05 05:16:00,61,"I've fished the North End and have seen the cabin from the boat. It looks very nice, as do all of their outpost cabins. That cabin is really close to Stove Island with some classic rock/dropoff structure. It also is a fairly short trip from there to Columbus Island, with similar structure. Find the humps and dropoffs and eventually you'll find the walleye. But I've only fished that end of the lake one or 2 times. We had dead calm water and almost 90 degree temps for 3 days and quickly learned that we needed motion and trolling to take fish. Good luck!"
3737882,Mauserbowser,2015-04-07 01:28:00,6,"You would be doing well by NOT fishing Shekak. I have fished Shekak twice with my old Lowrance 350a sonar and my other friends have fished it in July over 8 times in the 1990s. Both times I fished it in 1993 and 1994, I wasn't impressed in size or numbers because I worked way too hard for too few fish and those ones were small. It is a medium sized lake, medium depth 10-20, shallower and weedy in other spots. Shekak has been fished very hard over the years and all the walleye run real small. The average size has shunk over the years and my fishing friends don't go there anymore and I quit going with them after 1994 because they kept returning to Shekak. White River's Gourlay Lake is much better but it seems to be booked all of July and the first 2 weeks of August. In the course of a week's fishing by 8 guys fishing hard and smart, the biggest walleye was only 23-24. Biggest Pike was 33-34. The numbers of walleye per day averages about 8-10 per boat per 2 guys fishing 6-8 hours per day. I think you are smart to look at Esnagi because the Shekak has been fished hard and is on the downslide. There are better fly-in lakes at what you will pay White River for Shekak. Esnagi Lake is a huge lake and I recommend you don't fish it without a sonar and if you have a locator with GPS, all the better. I had to take a small Honda generator in the 1990s to recharge my batteries too."
3737970,Mike Borger,2015-04-07 03:34:00,1554,"Yikes, that sounds terrible! I'll find out for myself this July."
3738634,adempsey,2015-04-07 07:29:00,963,A lot can change in 20 years.
3740450,unclepaully,2015-04-07 15:01:00,112,Thanks for the reply but like others have said alot can change in that amount of time. I talked with someone who's been going for the past 25 years to Shekak. He said over the last few years the numbers that you catch is going down but size of the fish is getting better. He also said they have 50-100 fish days in September. From what I understand WRA implemented a slot on the lake years ago and that has really paid off. Also heard the same thing about Esnagi.
