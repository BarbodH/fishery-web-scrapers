2918081,LOW1,2014-06-20 07:36:00,2828,Here's an article from the Fort Frances Times about the projected very significant rise in Rainy Lake and the risk to Fort Frances. http://www.fftimes.com/node/270626 What goes through Fort Frances eventually has to go to LOTW.
2918457,deadhead1,2014-06-20 08:48:00,193,We only got 1/2 inch of rain in Kenora last night. Lake still came up and now almost totally covering my dock! At least now the wind is down and the sun is peaking out.
2895233,Obabikon,2014-06-13 15:43:00,2370,"We have a 2nd one LOL... Also, there's reports that the already very high water levels will be coming up at least 6 more inches in the next week. We're going to be 3 feet high soon. (more rain coming this weekend)"
2902825,deadhead1,2014-06-16 10:40:00,193,"I just got back to Kenora after a week of vacation in Saskatchewan. The water came up close to a foot since I left and we got 2 1/2 inch of rain on Sunday. Last evening it was below my steps on the beach and this morning it is well over them, up about 4 inch since last night. My dock is close to being under water, never seen it this high since I have been here."
2903145,LOW1,2014-06-16 12:15:00,2828,"Here's an interesting chart:http://www.lwcb.ca/pdf/LakeoftheWood...2014.06.16.pdf Massively increased inflows into Lake of the Woods, but its a large basin with at least some gradual shorelines, meaning that the water can spread out and not just go straight up. But that's small comfort to those in areas where this does not happen. I would encourage everyone, especially those travelling at night, to be aware of rising water near roadways. For example, there are a number of stretches along north/south Highway 71 between '""The Junction"" and Kenora where the water could rise. Caution and Common Sense, please."
2904545,Obabikon,2014-06-16 18:31:00,2370,"We are absolutely flooded here on LOTW's. The water level spiked 12 inches last night (I've never seen it come up that fast... less than an hour). Most of our permanent docks are under water, and there's a ton of stress on our anchors for our floaters. That said, we have it better than a lot of places. But, the water level is up at least 2.5-3 feet for this time of year. Lots of trees floating in the lake, so those with fast boats... slow down and watch for logs."
2905225,Further North,2014-06-16 21:28:00,2008,Thanks - that's worth a lot of thought.We've been seeing heavy rains around here as well and I'm seeing more stuff floating than normal. I keep focused on what out in front of the baot ans slow way down if anything looks even slightly odd.
2905289,Mooseman,2014-06-16 21:52:00,10,Here is a data website to help you figure out the lake levels. On a direct eye contact level; our cottage sits right on a feeder lake into LoTW and our lake is the highest I have seen in almost 20 years. I have had to lift both docks and raise stairs to accommodate the new high level. Now I suppose this isn't a bad thing as near surface obstacles (rocks etc) are now deeper but the lakes levels may drop fast. Just how fast is another big guess.http://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html
2905801,Skyraptor,2014-06-17 07:17:00,291,a picture of the water level
2905873,Obabikon,2014-06-17 07:32:00,2370,More bad news on the water front... potentially heavy rain on Thursday. They're calling for just under an inch.
2906041,LOW1,2014-06-17 08:00:00,2828,"Highest water level on LOTW for many, many years. Attached is a media release from the office which regulates water level in the LOTW basin. Note the warning re debris in the lake - I am sure that goes for all lakes, not just LOTW.http://www.snnf.ca/wp-content/upload...ia-Release.pdf"
2907769,KM1,2014-06-17 15:47:00,374,"Geez...the lake is hazardous enough with normal water levels....now we are going to have to watch for floating trees and logs, pieces of dock, and what have you...along with all the normal hazards. Plus...what about rocks that used to be clearly visible...now they are under water. How are the gas supplies at the resorts...how the heck do they keep water out of the gas (or gas out of the lake) when it rises this much?"
2867921,Obabikon,2014-06-04 20:09:00,2370,"Dave, if it comes up another 8 inches or so, we will have to. At the moment, we're doing fine... You know we like to save those big winds for you guys! It keeps things interesting!"
2868873,deadhead1,2014-06-05 06:47:00,193,Levels continue to rise on LOW. We have had rain again. Based on my beach it is still not at highest I have seen it but getting close. I don't mind high water but it could do some damage if wind gets up. I wonder if high water effects the fish much?
2877017,Wallii1,2014-06-08 10:22:00,37,Lake was about a foot high this last week. Water temps dropped after the big rain but were back up to low 60's by the end of the week.
2883521,LOW1,2014-06-10 08:20:00,2828,Another recent newspaper article re high water levels in the Lake of the Woods basin area. Note the warning to be careful.http://www.kenoradailyminerandnews.c...ing-lake-level
2888985,Obabikon,2014-06-11 16:45:00,2370,I officially weighted down my permanent docks today. Water levels still rising. More rain today and tomorrow.
2890705,LOW1,2014-06-12 08:26:00,2828,"http://www.lwcb.ca/noticeboard.html I have been regularly watching this LOTW water level notice board for years and seldom is at as ominous-sounding as it now is. REW would say be careful, and you should."
2890801,Smallmouth Hunter,2014-06-12 08:55:00,84,Headed up in about 6 hours. Thanks for all the info. Sounds like the water isn't going down anytime soon. Everyone be safe.
2890889,tv4fish,2014-06-12 09:29:00,2694,"Obabikon:Have you ever tried putting ""zip ties"" on your dock sections to keep them in place?"
2891521,Obabikon,2014-06-12 12:39:00,2370,"I haven't. I don't think it would work with our setup. Those would need to be 5 foot long zip ties, and I'd need to be able to get underneath to the cribbing. Pretty easy to put the canoe on the edge of the dock and fill it with water though."
2894505,Guest,2014-06-13 11:20:00,0,Unless someone wanted to canoe. :-)
2854593,Smallmouth Hunter,2014-06-01 12:14:00,84,I have been checking out the Control board website and the best I can tell the water level looks pretty similar to lat year. Will be heading up in 10 days. Anybody been or local who can confirm this? There's a good chance I can't read the Control board website correctly. Also anyone with water temps? Thanks
2854625,Guest,2014-06-01 12:32:00,0,It looks like the water level is coming up very nicely. There was a sharp rise during the first week in May. The rain over the region must have come down in buckets.
2856345,MN_Moose,2014-06-02 05:26:00,964,The water level on LOTW stays quite consistent. I wouldn't give it much thought. The water temps are rising. About 60 - 62.
2856873,deadhead1,2014-06-02 08:19:00,193,"I live on LOW so I can tell water level by how far up on the boat lift water is. I would say it is normal for this time of year but not as high as I have seen it. My understanding is that they draw it down before thaw so that they have room for spring runoff, then it will rise until mid June depending on rain. We have had good amounts of rain so very normal conditions."
2862081,LOW1,2014-06-03 12:01:00,2828,http://www.kenoradailyminerandnews.c...g-water-levels
2862489,Obabikon,2014-06-03 13:20:00,2370,"The water level is actually quite high for this time of year on LOTW's. Right now it sits about a foot above what the maps would say. However, usually in early June, we have water that is 6-12"" bellow that number. If we have a normal June's rain fall, it could cause some problems for permanent dock structures."
2863225,sept61,2014-06-03 16:36:00,91,"http://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.htmlAll the information you need,"
2863721,Obabikon,2014-06-03 19:20:00,2370,"Those charts (after about an hour of trying to figure them out) show the lake at about .25 meters (8-9 inches or so) high right now, and the inflow is almost double what the outflow is. With the big rain we had yesterday, I can't imagine that slowing down any."
2863977,Smallmouth Hunter,2014-06-03 20:18:00,84,Thanks for all the info. All that data on the website is good but someone actually with eyes on the lake seems better.
2864137,muskyman73,2014-06-03 20:57:00,402,"Hey Jared, puttin rocks on the docks again ? Just get those bad windy storms out of the way now. We look forward to seeing you"
