It also has a fantastic authentic German restaurant on site. Been going to Dinorwic since the mid 80's and love the fishery. Usually go in August, less people and weather is more stable."
1874098,Simple Man,2013-06-17 14:27:00,92,Brown Bay Camp for sure! Went for the first time last year. Loved the Lake and our group would echo everything that has been said on here about the Camp....we will go back again someday for sure. Cookies are great but I am surprised noone has mentioned the homemade pie!
2926081,fishmanric,2014-06-23 08:33:00,219,"I've been fishing out of Pine Sunset Lodge for many years now and can tell you that Mitch and Sharon are two of the hardest working owners in the business. They are constantly upgrading the equipment and buildings and Sharon now guides. If you like shallow water walleye fishing, jumbo perch with the chance at a big musky, Dinorwic as well as Wabigoon will not disappoint and the price point is right. Love the different water variations from the crystal clear water of Minnehaha, brown stained main lake, greenish color of Rock Lake and root beer colored back bays of Moose and Stanawan. If you would have booked this year at one of the trade shows one day free guiding was included. I will be up there at the end of July once again this year. Good luck to all and happy fishing."

They were allowed entry into Ontario on a work permit for the camp; however, they do not meet residency requirements defined by the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act.In 2006, conservation officers found Mitch Gusick with an Ontario resident hunting licence and warned him to correct it, as he was not an Ontario resident. In December 2007, Sharon Gusick was found to have upgraded her Outdoors fishing card to an Ontario resident hunting card. In November 2008, conservation officers again caught Mitch Gusick with an Ontario resident Outdoors Card.On November 10, 2008, the Gusicks were advised they did not meet the requirements of Ontario residency for hunting and fishing in Ontario. They were also advised that an investigation in Ontario was underway with the assistance of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to determine their residency status. Less than three weeks later, both Gusicks renewed their Ontario Outdoors Cards online, claiming resident status.Justice of the Peace Edith Baas heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Dryden, on April 20, 2010.For the purposes of obtaining an Ontario resident hunting and fishing licence, a resident is a person whose primary residence is Ontario, and who has resided in Ontario for a period of six consecutive months during the previous 12 months"

1855449,Babamel2,2013-06-11 06:53:00,414,"I have fished Dinorwic for twenty years staying at Brown Bay Camp -- just across the lake from Pine Sunset. the cabins are very clean and well organized. The owner is very careful about accepting people whose interest is to fish, not party animals.The fishing on Dinorwic can be off and on. Knowing where to go is a great help. My personal best was a 14 lb walleye that I got about 1 mile from Pine Sunset. Enjoy"
1855657,Skywagon,2013-06-11 07:31:00,1106,"Spill the beans Mel, it's not just the nice clean cabins at Brown Bay that keep's you coming, it's the cookies! Finally got on the lake Sunday, just took a spin, did not fish, didn't hit any icebergs. You should be good to go."
1858721,lund rebel,2013-06-12 06:42:00,138,Cookies?????? What about cookies!!!!!!!!
1859073,1jigfish2,2013-06-12 08:22:00,110,"If you fish Dinorwic, take a run up to Minehaha. It is a 18 mile run by water from Brown Bay Camp. It was well worth the run when we fished it."
1860137,Walley Guide,2013-06-12 13:27:00,67,I would pick Brown Bay too! I agree the cookies are great!
1860257,115 optimax,2013-06-12 14:09:00,650,"Did you catch any big ones?I've only been there once for a joy ride and I erased my tracks on my gps,do you just stay in the middle through all of the narrows or is there a secret to getting in there?I remember weaving through the weeds in an S pattern."
1860417,Guest,2013-06-12 15:02:00,0,Ive been to Pine Sunset a couple of times. Cant beat the price and cabins and common buildings are being upgraded. Fishing was above average every time. Too many walleyes to count. The owners were helpful in putting us on fish. Lots of water to explore. I would definitely go back.
