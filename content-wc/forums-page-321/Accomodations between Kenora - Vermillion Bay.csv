We will spend 3 days at Ash Rapids Camp on LOTW, because I want to take her pike and bass fishing on Shoal Lake. But then we will have 5 to 7 days to kill in the Kenora area. I would like to take her canoeing on the Lakes between Kenora and Vermilion Bay. Just want to go in random lakes along the Highway east of Dogtooth Lake. Does anybody have any suggestions for some reasonably priced accomodations in that area? Something near Dogtooth preferably, or half way between Dogtooth and Vermilion Bay. Just need a basic cabin, nothing too fancy. Any help or suggestions would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance! ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
2924873,stillangling,2014-06-22 20:47:00,149,There is nothing along that stretch that I would recommend. Dogtooth Resort is an option but it is just to the south on highway 71. Another suggestion would be to pick a cheap hotel in Kenora and do the commute each day. If you stayed in Kenora you would also have the option of exploring that stretch north of town along the Jones Road (Highway 671). Generally speaking the lakes along highway 17 east of Kenora are trout water. If that is what you are looking for you have better options on the Jones Road. It might make the wife happier to be in Kenora in the evenings.
