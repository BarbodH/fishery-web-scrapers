I was there three weeks ago and I would guess it was 3 foot higher than normal then. Going back next week and it should be interesting checking out the old hot spots if I can find them. Mike Kansas"

We had great luck on that pattern three weeks ago so I will try it again next week. Give it a shot It might still be worthwhile. Good Luck, Be Safe, Mike Kansas"
