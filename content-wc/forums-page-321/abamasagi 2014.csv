Chad really goes out of his way to make everything happen for the group. We stayed again in cabin3 up in the arm of the lake....but finished almost exclusively towards the big lake and the islands in front of cabins 1&2. The fishing was the most unpredictible we have ever seen on this great pickerel lake. We fish generally 3 times a day...morn till lunch....lunch till dinner then always head out for a great night time fish till dark. Every session on every day was different. You would have to totally change your tactics each time you set out...never has this lake, at least in June been like this. A spot that you were killing it in the morning was either shutdown by afternoon or you had to change your lures,lure colours, or go to live bait...or they had completely moved. Sure pushed you to think each trip out...but each time you locked in to where they were and what they wanted, it was amazing,as always there. As always with Chad, our flight in and our flight out was bang on. I recommend TLO to anyone. BTW, this cabin is available nxt week if anyone is thinking of a last minute trip...wish I could get back!!!"

Im sure others have had a medical issue while in camp, I know we all think about it and wonder how it will play out. We had our after almost 10 or so trips with our group. On our last day of fishing, getting ready to head out on a rainy fri morn, our father slipped on a set of stairs, went down abt 4-5ft, hit his head on a stump...yep the same stump you look at 100s of times, but think nothing of it. We arent sure if he has a concussion, broken ribs, or worse broken back. If you have the opportunity to have a SAT phone...take it...we were sure glad we did!! One call to Chad at Twin Lakes and Greg from Nakina Air and we were packed ina bt 1hr...totally packed...plane arrived and within abt 2hrs of making that call we had him in Geraldton hospital. No broken back was determined in camp, but definately assumed broken ribs and or internal bleeding. Hospital was amazing care and attention to detail. Only couple broken ribs!!! My real point in this post isnt the drama abt wht happened but how well we as a gropu were taken care of from the moment we called. TLO was on it right away, Nakina Air was there in 1hr and helped load our plane extra quick, then the boys who helped unload, then as mentioned the hospital. You know when an event like this happens, you are with a fantastic outfitter. This isnt a generator problem, or boat issue, but you know if it was, it would be resolved in the same manner. It turned out to be not to bad a medical situation, but you never know...i hope its our last and I hope none of you guys flying in ever go through anything like it....although I realize thats impossible. I cant imagine what some of these seasoned bush pilots have seen and dealt with. Kudos to all involved! HAVE a SAT phone!!!"

But, I look back over some of those trips and we were young and dumb. lol Made some very poor decisions. Usually alcohol related. But, nothing that ever required an emergency call.We did start taking a Sat Phone with us as soon as it was available too. We wanted that peace of mind."

Much better care than I got at the famous Cleveland Clinic near my home. Nurses and docs actually cared, unlike the ""Walmart"" mentality of US hospitals. Also Nakina Air has always been topnotch with us..."
