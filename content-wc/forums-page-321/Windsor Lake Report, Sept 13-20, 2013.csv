My group of 4 fished Eddie North's newly aquired camp on Windsor lake the week of Sept 13-20. The camp needs some work, but overall (after a bit of work) it was perfectly habitable and fine for our needs. This trip was a last minute one as I had originally been scheduled to fish northern Saskatchewan that same week. That was unexpectedly cancelled and Eddie came through for me at the last minute. Water was very low and we were forced to land at a beach about 1 km east of camp. Not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things and ultimately only added to the story. The amount of fishable water at Windsor is vast, you're only scratching the surface in a week. For what it's worth we travelled as far as we could before being stopped by rapids both upstream and down, I doubt there's much more you could navigate without portaging even in high water. We mainly targeted pike and the results were very good. Casting mostly spinnerbaits, inline bucktails and a variety of spoons we caught scads of pike between 40-44"". Key spots were deep weed edges directly adjacent to deep water and current. Much of Windsor is comprised of backwater areas nowhere near the current. We quickly eliminated these areas, but I'm positive in the high water of spring the big gators would be stacked in those spots. Walleye fishing was, in a word, stupid. Honestly if all you did was fish for walleyes you can EASILY catch 100 a day at Windsor. One caveat though: no big ones. Elsewhere on the Attawapiskat I've always caught larger specimens in the 7-10lb class, but not here. Windsor walleye average 17-21"" for us with a handful slightly larger. Pretty much every current area (and there was many) held untold numbers of fat, feisty and aggressive walleye. We brought worms as I always do but never used them. My go to bait for walleye was a 4"" Fin S Fish in a variety of brighter citrus colors on either a 1/4 or 3/8 oz head. Sounds impressive, but in all honesty those fish would've hit anything. All in all a truly great trip, it was an absolute pleasure exploring such a vast and interesting body of water and I definitely plan on going back. For those that are contemplating Windsor I amassed a great amount of information on the system and would be more than happy to pass it along, just shoot me a pm. If you're interested I posted a detailed report on this trip complete with lots of photos and videos, you can see it here:http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...owtopic=71660# Cheers, Mike"

Thanks for sharing, as always, and looking forward to your next adventure. Also, thanks for helping out with new, to us, venues!!!"
