2846633,jdoaks,2014-05-29 19:17:00,89,from n outfitters go thru narrows small island to right jiged eyes there a few times. i run a blue and white sylvan merc. outboard. i usually n. end mid week.
2849977,keek,2014-05-30 17:06:00,1003,"From Northern Outfitters head towards the main channel and you'll see an island with a small house on it. You can actually see this island from the outfitters docks. Behind this island are numerous rock/boulder flats which we have done well on for walleye. Lots of cool places up there and it's pretty easy to get lost if you go exploring. Take a GPS. Side story- I remember finding fish all around a small island that for some reason had an old bike chained to the trees. The closest place to ride that bike wasn't for MILES around unless he road it out on the ice back in the day. Also watch your prop. Lots of stuff to hit when you get out of the main channel. Go slow your first few days and get to know the place. Even then don't let your guard down. Bring a spare prop. One of the bigger islands in Misery Bay has a great spot for a shore lunch. Thin fins (smaller size) in blue, silver and gold were killer for us. The Rapala Floating minnow F-11 in Fluorescent Red was also a good one. Worm rigs on bottom bouncers will produce. My biggest pike came from the Decelles (44"") and it hit on a Bone colored Zara Spook in the rain. Enjoy!"

2901137,jeremyho,2014-06-15 21:51:00,2,"Got back from a tough week of fishing yesterday, not terrible but not nearly as good as I had hoped. Numbers weren't too bad but a lot of small fish, less than half made the 12"" limit. Had some luck towards the end trolling size 6 thin fins and gold nuggets in 4-8 fow near weedy shorelines in North Bay, jigged some off rocky points in 10-20 fow but those ran pretty small. Must have hit a dead post-spawn week. Some reports of bigger fish at the big notch (narrows 5 miles south of n outfitters). Equipment/electronics problems limited our explorations some. Good luck to everyone else, I'm sure it will come back but according to locals I would plan my next trip end of June/first of July."
