2913889,Mike Kansas,2014-06-19 09:09:00,1463,"I know what I'm about to say is not a revalation. While fishing Lac Seul last week we of course saw water that was at least 3' above normal. The high water made some of the spots we have caught a lot of fish on in the last 30 years into non producers. Not to mention the 51 degree water temps. High cold water made us move into the backs of bays that we normally don't fish and it was a successful move. We still of course found good structure in these areas but also found 59 to 61 degree water. When we found a drop or hump or basically any change in structure we found eyes. Couple of these bays produced a couple 450 fish days for five of us and there were more 23"" to 25"" fish than normal. With high water being the norm for most Ontario lakes this year I urge you to do a little searching for the conditions we found success in. Hope this helps and I hope you all have a great trip and a safe one. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
