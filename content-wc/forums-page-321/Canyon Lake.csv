2490450,HeHooksHimself,2014-02-26 04:59:00,725,"Thanks, lip ripper! We appreciate the info. Looks like we are going to take a shot here, probably at Macintosh Lodge in mid Sept."
2542569,Musky Husky,2014-03-11 11:43:00,4,"I would echo what everybody else has said about the walleye fishing in Canyon Lake. There are some very big walleye in there. I got my personal best there back in July of 2009 on a jig and leech. Slip bobbers and jigs with leeches and crawlers work well there. The clear water does make it a morning and evening bite. The lake has a lot of muskies and some big fish. I would say it is more of a numbers lake for musky and then a lake to go out and catch a 50 incher. The number of follows you can get in a day is outstanding certain days. I have stayed at McIntosh Lodge twice and the camp is top notch. It is has always been clean and the cabins are kept up well. The owner John is a great guy and really funny. He fishes for walleye nightly if the weather isn't bad and he is willing to share spots with you. His slogan for the lodge is ""we do our best to put you on fish"" and that is very true. Before I went to McIntosh Lodge for the first time I was looking into Blyth's Canyon Lake Lodge, but when I talked to the owner at the Chicago All Canada Show he was rude to me. I was not impressed with him or his lodge, so I found McIntosh Lodge on the internet. One thing about the lake is that if the wind is straight out of the west it can get really rough to the point where it is tough to control the boat/fish."
2542921,HeHooksHimself,2014-03-11 13:18:00,725,"Thanks Musky Husky. We are booked at McIntosh from 9/5-9/11. If you could only afford a few musky baits, what would be your choice for this lake? We will assume the walleye bite is morning and evening even in Sept."
2544057,Limeyangler,2014-03-11 19:22:00,563,LOL something that resembles a big walleye by the sounds of it!
2551353,Musky Husky,2014-03-13 14:56:00,4,He hooks himself check your private messages. Messages me back if you have any other questions.
2551449,38bill,2014-03-13 15:21:00,331,We always stay on a lake just a couple of miles east of Canyon. Does anyone know if Canyon has a decent boat ramp that the public can use? It could be fun to make the run over to try for some of those big eyes.
2551562,Carnhzkr,2014-03-13 16:06:00,964,"There's a place just as you cross the railroad tracks. It's not really a boat ramp, but you can put in there. It's a beachy, sandy area that gradually tapers in. You might want a 4x4. I've put in a 17 foot Lund Explorer with no problem. Otherwise, I don't think there's a public ramp. One of the lodges might allow you to use theirs for a fee."
2552002,38bill,2014-03-13 18:34:00,331,"Great, I'll have to check it out. Shouldn't have any problem as I too have an 17' Explorer and a 4X4. Thanks."
2559865,bobbylfishermon,2014-03-16 09:58:00,241,"We stayed at McIntosh Lodge with John& Becky Snyder for 4 years, great people and very nice camp, BUT, it's really a world class musky lake and the wally's are not easy!! Snyder fishes walleye like a bass guy, casting jigs and crawlers or jigs and leeches to the shoreline rocks. WARNING, This lake turns into a unfishable body of water from midlake to the eastern end if the wind blows from the west, northwest, or southwest, and we are talking 4ft-5ft ROLLERS and I have a 1850 Crestliner and NO FEAR, but this lake will make you a GOD fearing man when the wind blows, and trust me, in September the wind will blow! I've been spending a month in May-June and a month in September since 1985. P.S. Easy walleyes right down the road on Indian Lake Chain!!"
2923361,kvman1959,2014-06-22 08:59:00,45,just got back from a week on Canyon Lake at Mcintosh Lodge with John and Becky. Walleye fishing was great with the biggest being 30 1/2inch 11 1/2 lbs caught by my son. We used leech's and crawlers with for every 2 on crawlers 3 would be caught on leech's. They would only hit half a crawler for some reason would not hit a whole one. Throw out a half and they hammered it. We also had 6 muskys on at different times during our trip as they would smack little eyes we were reeling in. Weather was nice but I can see as stated before how if the wind is out of the west it can get rough.
1897346,bpetersen,2013-06-25 15:58:00,251,"Hi all, Looking for any information on Canyon Lake by Vermillion. How would you rate the fishery? Looking for mainly walleye and northern and possibly bass. Most likely early June."
2455601,HeHooksHimself,2014-02-16 05:06:00,725,"Hi, I was searching for information on Blyth's Canyon Lake Lodge and the fishery of Canyon Lake. This post from 2007 was the only thing I came across. Anyone have any knowledge or feedback?"
2455865,Limeyangler,2014-02-16 07:11:00,563,when i googled it this came up http://blythscanyonlakelodge.comI'm pretty sure V-bay Gord would know a bit about it too.
2455889,Limeyangler,2014-02-16 07:12:00,563,oooopsâ€¦.
2456417,Carnhzkr,2014-02-16 09:36:00,964,"I've fished Canyon Lake four trips. I've never stayed at Blyth's, but right next door at North Country once and three times at a private residence. It's known as a musky lake, but has a good population of large walleye and some bass. There are no northerns in the lake. I've never fished it in June. I've been there the first week of July once and three times in September. It is a clear water lake, and we found the walleye deep. My first trip there was probably my single best walleye trip. Three of us caught somewhere between 60 - 80 walleye over five pounds. My best there is a 28"", but I've netted one pushing 31. Now, with all that said, I haven't been back to Canyon in five or six years. For me, it's been pretty hit or miss. There are big walleyes there, but sometimes it can be hard to find a bite, at least for me. Being a clear water lake, we typically could find a good bite in the morning, then they'd shut off at about 11. They might pick up again just as the sun touches the horizon. We've caught a few musky there while fishing for walleye, and that was a thrill. The lake is about 13 miles long and narrow on one end. There are three lodges that I know of, and quite a few private homes, but we never had an issue with sharing fishing spots with other boats. I don't know much about Blyth's, but I would recommend North Country. Nice folks. When we stayed there, they put on a pot-luck dinner and furnished a delicious moose roast. I had called the other lodge, Makintosh (or something like that) several times, but they are always booked solid all year. If you go, I'd be curious to find out how you did. I might go back again sometime."
2456649,plumberjoe,2014-02-16 10:58:00,54,I have stayed at North Country Lodge 8 times in the last 6 years great people. Last year I went early Sept and again in Oct. Sept walleye were in about 28ft and Oct 40ft both trips we caught good numbers of fish but nothing real big. As far as northern they have boats on a small lake down the road that has good action. They took us Trout fishing to a nearby lake and that was alot of fun to.
2457225,HeHooksHimself,2014-02-16 14:55:00,725,"Limey, I saw the website, but for some reason they don't mention anything negative..?? Joe we are looking to book something for our 4 day September trip so your info. is valuable. I haven't had a lot of luck on clear lakes, it seems like they see you coming. Hooking a muskie by accident would be fun though. Would they attack crankbaits on the troll like northerns?"
2457369,plumberjoe,2014-02-16 15:50:00,54,Sept walleye bite was in the morning and the evening we didnt try anything but vertical jigging with a minnow. They were feeding on deep rock humps if you go I can tell you where we caught them. During the day we trout fished twice otherwise tried for musky. We are not musky fisherman but did catch one and saw probably 20. Someone that knows how to fish them would do better. Nice time to be up there almost no one on lake.
2465785,shortmag,2014-02-19 05:43:00,70,We have been to North Country three times(one week per year) in early July. Wayne and Lydia are great hosts. As a clear water lake the walleye bite tends to be evenings and mornings unless it is overcast/choppy. Lake has smallmouth and muskies and some nice perch as well. The walleye action has been variable for us but some of my best evenings have been on Canyon. You will catch plenty to eat. Very little traffic as a rule. They will take you on other lakes if requested and the adventure is awesome.
2489089,ripnlipstaknnames,2014-02-25 17:49:00,27,"I have been to canyon 5 or 6 times, fishing is always good but have found better fishing elsewhere and have not been back here for about 7 or 8 years. as far as walleye i will echo some of the other posts and say it is typically a early and late in the day bite with the clear water. it is not usually a numbers lake but the average size is great with good numbers of 24-28 inch fish and i think all but one of the times here someone in the group has caught one over 30 inches including my personal best at 31 inches and 11 pounds. for us the secret here for walley was leeches hands down over minnows and usually on a plain octopus hook and split shot or lindy weight over a jig head. musky fishing is great here but no northerns. bass are there but not in big numbers although we have caught some big ones on accident. if you do want northerns just ask the owner(if you stay at blyths) they have a lake nearby you can drive to and fish off shore and catch all you want. we usually went first week in june except for once when we went later to hit the musky opener, earlier was better. hope this helps"
