2922777,jkwildhunting,2014-06-21 22:52:00,361,"Drive on up 105.....unless you own a car. We took 3 trucks and a conversion van thru it today around 10:30am about 10-12"" water as stated they had flaggers on each side and the lady at 105/17 corner said if you have a car recommend the detour. I took a go pro clip of us going thru kind of cool. Go slow n stay in the middle and you will be fine!"
