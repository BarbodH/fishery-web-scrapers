Launching was a little precarious. I thought he said that the docks and fish house were flooded where they stayed. Cleaned fish outside and the skeeters ate them up.Not that it makes much difference. Just curious from what other fellows are seeing.Pooch"

We were there for a week and saw the water go up up quite a bit. It was already higher that normal for the week we go. The restaurant called desperate dick and naught nellies had sand bags around the building. Water in the parking lot of the hotel behind the restaurant. Frog rapids camp boat houses looked like there was only about a 2 ft gap between the opening and the water level. Water is supposed to crest next week is what we were told. Rainy lake, rainy river radio news was claiming they were taking precautions to prevent water turbine electrical generation problems due to the water levels. We launch at deception daily and noticed the smaller dock to the right of the large dock floated away on Tuesday. Many many islands looked different because of the water levels."
