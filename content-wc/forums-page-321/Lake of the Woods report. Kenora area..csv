2925729,patricktjms,2014-06-23 07:24:00,67,Any updates on fishing or water levels from the Kenora area after the weekend?
2925777,deadhead1,2014-06-23 07:30:00,193,"water is still going up but not as fast as it was. up about 2 inch overnight. Most of the docks are under water unless they are floaters. Fish are starting to move out to summer humps but still not fully moved. On weekend we caught a lot of smaller walleye and the odd good one but had to fish in current. Places like tranquil channel, for example."
2925849,patricktjms,2014-06-23 07:39:00,67,Thats good to hear. Hopefully the water will start to level off and receede in the next couple of weeks.
2926601,mrpike24,2014-06-23 10:32:00,54,"Just got back on Saturday from 8 days of fishing. Walleye fishing was best in 5-12' FOW, had very good luck, especially on cloudy/wind blown days. Had trouble catching fish at or under the 18"" mark, biggest was 29.5"" for the week, with lots over 25"". Bass were really scattered and tough to pin down, very slow fishing for them....definitely couldn't get a good pattern on them. Caught some nice northern and noticed the Musky getting active towards the end of the week as well. Water is as high as I've ever seen it, much more rain and cooler temps than previous years as well. Can't wait to make it back....."
2926697,patricktjms,2014-06-23 10:48:00,67,Thats great to hear! Thanks for the report!
1450928,eyeman_1,2012-06-18 18:32:00,690,"Nick, Anytime. Hope it helps you out a bit and you guys get on them. Maybe the fish Gods will be good to me and no problems going up or back... that's all I'm wishing for."
1453643,bassface44,2012-06-25 05:12:00,96,We are a couple weeks from our trip and I was wonderin if someone might have any new info.
2908081,Lunkerbass21,2014-06-17 17:36:00,25,I'm going up to Kenora on Saturday and will be there all week....I'll post everyday on my twitter account and blog. @Lunkerbass21 Looks like the weather is going to be sweet. We will be fishing the barrier island area (around Witch Bay). Hope the fish are biting!!!
2908153,Dog,2014-06-17 18:03:00,210,Lunkerbass we are going to be fishin the same area next week too. Have you heard how high the lake is? I guess they have had a lot of rain. Dog
2908169,stillangling,2014-06-17 18:09:00,149,"It takes longer than that to drive across Ontario! I do admit that I don't just jump into the truck to see my buddies in southern Ontario like I used to. As I like to remind people, you could cut hours off the drive, fish closer to home and spend the week washing lures in frustration. If it was close, it wouldn't be what it is. It is hard to describe to people who have never been to NW Ontario what it is like. Best drive to fishing for walleye, pike, muskies and smallmouth available. Musky season starts on Saturday and I am pumped! Temps dropped off last week so fish will be in the skinny water and lookin for small baits."
2908241,patricktjms,2014-06-17 18:27:00,67,ill be following you on twitter as I am heading up on July 4th!Sent from my SCH-I535 using Tapatalk
2910625,deadhead1,2014-06-18 13:23:00,193,I think you have been looking at a different forecast than I have. I see wind and rain all weekend. I hope you are right. The water is exceptionally high right now but I don't think that should effect the fishing. I was talking to some locals and they say walleye are hard to find but some are getting some. I will be on the lake in the same general area as you.
2911449,cbprov,2014-06-18 15:48:00,1010,"i have a waterfront cabin close to Kenora on LOW water is really high! ,surface temp 60 f on sat morning ,it rained all weekend really hard ,supposed to rise another foot still ,walleye was good still"
2914769,patricktjms,2014-06-19 12:10:00,67,Make sure to keep those updates coming from Kenora for me. Only 15 days until i head that way!
2915049,deadhead1,2014-06-19 12:45:00,193,Water levels keep going up. Looks like up about 3 inch overnight. Hope we don't get more rain. I have been talking to some guides and walleye are scattered so you will get a few just about anywhere on the lake. If you want to catch any amount you have to find current. Forecast is better for weekend and next week so hopefully things will settle down.
1450093,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-06-16 19:05:00,84,"Just got back this morning. Gotta love that 21 hour drive. Saturday the 9th was a great day. Water temps were about 72ish in. Caught tons of smallies on topwater. Walleye were in shallow water. Found them in 6 to 8 feet of water. Found them trolling and casted once we marked them. Caught a very good number and were some hogs mixed in. Sunday was a unique ay to say the least. Got caught in a major storm. Very heavy rain, hail, lighting and big wind. About sank the boat before we could get behind a island. Been going for 22 years. First hail, first time I was standing in high shin water in a boat. Very scary thought we were going down. Completely messed up the morning and afternoon fishing. Did decent on bass and walleye in the evening. Monday was heavy wind and tough for bass. Walleye was still decent. Tuesday and Wednesday cold front moved in. Fishing dropped way off. Still windy. Thursday was better for the bass. Walleye were still pretty scattered. Caught them but was pretty tough. Basically water temps went from 72 to about 65 after the storm and never really recovered. Saw 67 on Thursday. Wind was heavier than normal and does not bode well for topwater smallmouth fishing, which is what we do. The cold front seemed to mess up the walleye bite. Still caught some but it was tough sledding. Water was slightly down. Didn't really affect the fishing Overall less then average year. Still would have went even if I knew what it was going to be like. 51 weeks to go."
1450128,Rich B,2012-06-16 21:22:00,1081,"Sounds like you were on a good bite until Mother Nature got riled up (ha) ! With your rig taking on water big time glad to hear you were able to get to a safe area behind an island....last time I had water in one of my rigs around my feet, I had left the transom plug out of the drain.....not from a bad storm ! Where do you stay when you go to LOTW ? 22 years heading north is a good record ! We drive up 24 hours to the Perrault area from Eastern Ohio....I hear ya about the drive time, as we had a new guy with us this year.....kept asking when would we get to camp ? Kept telling him it was only 3 more hours (ha).....we had a very good time and now he's also counting down the weeks until the Opener next year when we will be heading back up north ! Rich B"
1450211,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-06-17 07:11:00,84,"Moore Bay Lodge for the last 11 years. It's a great place. Can't beat our cabin and the boats are really good. It's right in the middle of where we like to fish. It's a boat in, so it has pros and cons. That 22 hour drive seems a lot shorter on the way up."
1450234,brant,2012-06-17 07:50:00,89,Thanks for the report. We will be at Moore Bay 3rd week in July. Just got back from Nortwest Bay on Rainy and the weather and wind slowed our fishing down too. Was there many people in camp?
1450343,bellbuoy,2012-06-17 13:22:00,490,"Leave for Witch Bay in a week, can't wait!"
1450364,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-06-17 14:42:00,84,"There was 6 of us. Another group had about 12 or 14, another group of 6 and a couple of guys from Germany. Pretty full for Moore Bay."
1450403,eyeman_1,2012-06-17 17:10:00,690,Headed to Wiley Point in 12 days... but who's counting.
1450536,nicko,2012-06-18 07:21:00,508,Who's not counting........ 18 days and a wake up to go. Thanks for all the good info Jim. Might have a few more questions in a few days. Nick Wiley point here we come!
1450849,MN_Moose,2012-06-18 15:58:00,964,we found the same maybe tougher. After the big storm the walleyes moved deeper like 35'. Smallmouth still biting. Water temp dropped from 67 to 62. Our old realiable spots didn't help much. Had to scratch out a few fish each day. Here's a pic of our dock from the cabbin. Almost didn't make it back in time. That was one errie storm with green skies.
1450884,Flip Silverlake,2012-06-18 17:10:00,645,It's been very windy all week. Forecast is for better weather starting Wednesday. Walleye are running around 23 feet. Lots of big fish all have been caught off points. I still have untill the end of August to get them.
