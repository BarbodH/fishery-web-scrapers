Cabins, docks & grounds are first class. We love fishing for smallies and Big V did not disappoint. We had planned to also fish on Lost Lake but never made it over there. Even though the water was still a little chilly we managed to catch quite a few fish on topwater. I spend the winter months making top water balsa baits and the smallmouth loved them. A little extra added satisfaction catching these guys on your own baits. I know we had to catch close to 600 bass for the week. We did one shore lunch and had a hard time catching 4 fish small enough to keep. Everything else was released. It's a long trip from Ohio but we already booked for next year and can't wait. Eagles flying, loons singing and fish biting. You just can't beat a Canadian fishing trip!!"

2917409,BuckeyeBill,2014-06-19 21:35:00,76,Here are a few of the topwater baits I made that the smallies just loved to bust. We also landed some pike on them. Tough on 6# mono.

2919681,Pikeslayer8,2014-06-20 15:28:00,1460,"Yeah, I gotta agree with Bakefish. Those plugs are top shelf for sure. They belong in the the Walleye Central Home Grown Tackle ""Wall of Fame"". Well done Buckeye Bill!"
