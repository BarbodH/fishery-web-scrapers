Decision went between Horwood Lake and Firth but something drew me to Gowganda. Looking for some points of interest since we are only there for one week. Spend most of the time trolling with 1/4lb roadrunners with white tails tipped with crawler---has been the ticket for years. Since this is a very deep lake what tactics have others used--thinking inline 2lb sinkers with harness,jigs etc. So for those that have fished this lake--please throw out some points I should pencil on the map--techniques etc. Lastly, where can I get a topo map prior to getting to camp--anyone have a filed saved with a copy to send?? Thanks, David"
2923897,polaris-pete,2014-06-22 15:07:00,343,David- I think you meant 2 oz sinkers not 2 lb ones! I fished this area many years ago and back then it was really good fishing.Used nothing but small floating Raplas behinf a 3/4-1 0z inline weight. Hit bottom a few times and reel up a few turns to keep the snags from getting you. The last many Years we have used worm harnesses with great results. Good Luck. I also fished Horwood many years and had tremendous fishing there especially in the Groundhog River. Good Luck.

I have some - don't show much but paper only . Forget where I got them I never hit the real deep portions - then I was on there mainly in early May. Points - weedbeds - etc. the rest of the year.

Fishing has been pretty good so far this year, with some nice walleye 24-26"" being caught trolling about 20ft level with worms. Last night the guys caught lots of small one's returning all to lake. Nice smallies caught also some as big as 4-5lbs."
