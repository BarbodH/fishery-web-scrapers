2909305,eatsleepfish,2014-06-18 06:06:00,52,I sent an email to the Ottawa River Regulation Planning Board and they sent me the last 5 years worth of Cabonga Surface levels. Based on past experiences I marked where Sterns and WaWa Pass would be to too shallow to get through on the graph. The top surface level of the Reservoir is 360.88 (m) or 1183.99 (ft) so what you see in the graph is change in depth from the highest level.

One thing to keep in mind is that the Ice there wasn't out until May so the fishing was a couple weeks behind previous years and very spotty. Most people did very poorly, (us included) with some having 1 or 2 good days with the walleye but no consistency. We fished in 2 days of rain and total cloud cover and the rest on Sunny days. Also no luck (one in our group lost a big Lake Trout) by cranking down all the way on the drag with only 14lb mono on the reel. A total of 1 1/2 days trolling on the big water with no lake trout to show for it."

In 5 mile I had a nice one only to loose him by the boat. Today we headed down to the big water and caught three lakers. Biggest one was 8 lbs caught by my dad and I got a one pounder and he got another one. Somebody caught some big ones, too, and they were all females, laden with eggs. Tomorrow, we are off to Burns Bay."
