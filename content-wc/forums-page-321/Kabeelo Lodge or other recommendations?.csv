My family (dad, 2 uncles and 2 cousins- all from Iowa) are looking to take a trip for our first ever fly in trip next summer- I'm already excited!! We are eyeing kabeelo lodge-- has anyone been there? Any outposts you'd recommend? What do you think of the place?Are there any other places you'd recommend? We'd like to keep the trip to around $1500/person for 4 days of fishing- but that is alwasy subject to change. I have been to canada 4-5 times (Amisk lake, SK) but the rest of the group is newer walleye fisherman- so something with high numbers of walleyes/pike would probably be a place to look at so we can try to make this an annual deal.Thanks for the recommendations!"
2931753,bigtimeelectric,2014-06-24 13:48:00,174,"Eyegator, welcome and thanks for registering. I have been on a couple fly inns and man you guys are in for a treat. There are lots of good operations up there to choose from. It would be helpfull for you guys to discuss what your prioritys are as far as1.Great walleye ok pike2.ok walleye big pike3.whatever species is more important there are lots of lakes that are great for 1 species and not the other.4.creature comforts5. outhouse or toilet6. how far to drive to get to plane7. extra freezer Its a bummer to run out of ice on day 2 been there done thatI am sure Kabeelo is fantastic also check out Clarks Camps like I say lots of choices also If you go to the sportshows in the spring you will get a better feel for the operators and camps...Good luck"
2931865,eyegator,2014-06-24 14:22:00,29,Thanks for the info. We'd probably prefer great walleye on the first trip- as I am the big pike guy of the group the rest just want to catch a lot and eat a lot of walleyes. We'd prefer to be in the 12-14hr drive range from Central Iowa. I will keep my eyes posted for sports shows. thanks!

The Lohn family which runs Kabeelo Lodge are really ""can do"" people, and it's clear that they know what they are doing. It's the first fly-in we've done, and the best Canadian fishing trip we've ever had. We don't go to Canada every year, but, when we go again, we will probably go with Kabeelo."

2932865,pwbmlr,2014-06-24 18:50:00,37,Try either Parks flyin or hawk air. Both are good operations with great walleye lakes and you will be well under your budget.
2932969,adempsey,2014-06-24 19:22:00,963,"You have a lot of options at that budget. I am sure Kabeelo's would be an excellent choice. Similar to Kabeelo's, some of the more deluxe cabins are operated by: Air IvanhoeBig North LodgeHalley's CampsHidden Bay LodgeHowie Bay ResortKnobby's Fly-In LodgeMattice Lake OutpostsNestor Falls Fly-In FishingNorthern Wilderness OutfittersNorthwest FlyingOgoki FrontierRusty Myers Outposts CampsShowalter's Fly-In OutpostsThousand Lakes OutpostsWhite River Air (North to Adventure)Ok, that's a longer list than I thought it was going to be! I am too lazy to link them, so you'll have to use Google."
2933161,Basser,2014-06-24 20:11:00,31,$1550 for 4 days at an outpost in Ontario is extremely expensive! Pm me if you want an easy walleye lake that might fit your wishes.
