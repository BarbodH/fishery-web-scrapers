We left the Detroit area at 6 AM -- hopped a train in Hawk Junction and were fishing by 5 PM. Great 6 days. Fishing was solid -- Walleye's mostly -- we had the dinner plan and the dinners were much better than expected -- shore lunch was fantastic, so much food -- the staff was bend over backwards helpful and the owners, Al and Doris, couldn't have been more gracious. The only negative was no smallmouth in this lake -- highly recommended."

2922201,jfaisten,2014-06-21 17:31:00,1060,"We caught walleye all over the North end -- used jigs tipped with minnows. Went through 7 dozen minnows. We ran into guys who didn't bother with minnows and did as well or better than we did. They threw 'small"" Rapala's and beetle spins tipped with a rubber tail. Wonderful lake to fish."
