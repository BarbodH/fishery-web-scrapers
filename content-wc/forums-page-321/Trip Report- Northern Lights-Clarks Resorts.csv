This year we fished Antenna Lake which is a smaller lake with good genetics for quality Northern fishing. Finished the week with numerous fish over 34"" with the biggest being a 44""/20-25lb gator. Interesting part was the great walleye fishing right off the dock.. We caught hundreds during the week after our evening meals.. Had several walleye's hit by northern's right at the boat. Always a fun experience.We fished Grace Lake last year and the walleye fishing was very good. Hard to pick between these two lakes..Wayne/Karla have a number of other lakes that have a loyal following based on the feedback from other groups we have met at the docks the last two years..So many great lakes to fish and so little time Great service again from the Clarks and we will be back in 2015."
