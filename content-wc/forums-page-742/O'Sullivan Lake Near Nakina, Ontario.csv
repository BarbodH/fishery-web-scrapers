550421,Mr Ranger,2005-07-17 20:07:00,272,Was just up two weeks ago. My third year. New owners are great but he really gets booked up early. If you want to go plan early. This year we hit the mayfly hatch dead on. Only 25% of the walleyes we normally caught but by far got our biggest fish. Many over 25 the biggest being 29. Really did well on the lake trout as well. Some mosquitos at night but other bugs non existant. Cannot wait till next year. We really enjoy O'Sullivan's. Good luck Jerry
