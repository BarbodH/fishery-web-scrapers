549909,Guest,2005-06-29 15:49:00,0,"Eric....the water level....LOL, well, we don't handle the dock issue very well. Haven't been able to use that fixed boat house in about three years because of the high water and two of our three docks are still under water. The water level does subside late summer every year and seems to drop like a rock when it does. A few years ago...before all this high water of late, right after I graduated college my dad and I spent a month or so up there just fixing things up and luckily had the forsight to build a big fixed dock with an attached floater that could sustain a rise of 50 inches before going under.....it's worked out well. I doubt we have established a new normal level.....probably just a temporary thing. I can always remember the water levels going up or down over the past 25 years...just not as drastic as they have over the past five years. The weather during the spring and early summer hasn't exactly been what I would call normal over the last five years either. Good luck, heading back up on July 9th for a week."
549913,IaCraig,2005-06-29 16:36:00,434,"Thanks Eric By Duane, I meant Duane H-e-l-l. He is the owner of Paradise Cove Resort and has earned my respect as a fisherman, as has his son Corey. Even though I haven't stayed at paradise cove for several years, if they are fishing you can usually hear them & Archie chatter on the radio (channel 65 or 68, I forget which). We do the evening troll with #9 shad raps & deep thundersticks too. I know it works in fishermans channel and aroud Bud's buoy too, but usually I hit Big Sand when I do it. Does anyone slip bobber fish at Minaki for eyes? If so, will you share a couple locations that it works best at? My wife loves to fish with a bobber, but hates my favorites of bottom bouncing or jigging. I figure this year with the wife and both kids I will have to give in and use slip bobbers to keep them happy. IaCraig"
549914,Guest,2005-06-29 16:38:00,0,where did all thise big fish come all over?
549919,Guest,2005-06-29 19:06:00,0,Water is very high and the bridge is unfisable tourney there this weekend
549966,Guest,2005-06-30 22:25:00,0,i can't believe you people waste your time at minaki. especially if your after walleyes. i can catch as many here in wisconsin.go to lac seul even lotw is better.at least its easier to catch a limit now[2 a day].
549994,woods,2005-07-01 12:58:00,646,"Our group has been unable to find a vacancy at Lac Suel for the 3rd week of June, so that's why we keep going to Minaki!"
549996,IaCraig,2005-07-01 13:46:00,434,"Why Minaki in 2005? 1 - My past success at Minaki has been good 2 - I know the lakes well enough to find fish and avoid the hazards. 3 - I like my resort owner IMO - I surely wouldn't call Minaki a dead sea. Granted it isn't the walleye hole it once was, but with the right regs it will make a come back. However I do agree with your question and I do fully intend to stretch my horizions by checking out places like South Dakota and Lac Seul. It takes time to learn new lakes, and I do intend to start learning. IaCraig"
550375,Guest,2005-07-15 09:32:00,0,"I guess u better learn how to fish,maybe get your wallyes and put in your pool so u can catch some ,becuz there tons of walleyes in minaki.Get the walleye insider magazine they have a few tips in there."
550460,KSauers,2005-07-18 19:33:00,385,The 2 walleye limit is killing the resort owners. Was just up there for a week and a half and there was hardly any walleye fisherman as compared to recent years. Maybe thats what the government wants. Put everyone out of business and supported by the liberal Canadian government.
549804,Guest,2005-06-27 14:59:00,0,I would head up to the Big Sand.
549809,Guest,2005-06-27 16:54:00,0,"Most of our fish were under 13.75, 3 were between 13.75 and 17.75, and the 3 over were 21.5, 25 and 25.25. Some of the places our groups bigger fish were caught are A-Frame bay, Echo Bay, Power lines, Blueberry Island, Big Sand was dead. We trolled bouncers and spinners, lindy rigged, trolled crankbaits and jigged. All produced fish and nothing seemed to produce more bigger fish than others. Good luck to you guys."
549846,Guest,2005-06-28 11:04:00,0,"Everyone, I'm not really adding anything, but a group of 17 of us (celebrating our 25th year fishing Minaki!) fished the week of June 18th through June 24th and harvested 19 walleyes (between 35 cm and 45 cm) We fished Harbour Island (the west bay and Baker's point) Raspberry, Strawberry and up in Big Sand. We (like others) caught many fish that were 30-34 cm (13"") probably 90% of our walleyes were this size. We did have a day of excellent bigger walleye fishing (like the old days!!) on the ""L"" shaped shoreline north of sand beach that I think is called Trappers Cabin. The wind blew in there all day on Wednesday and we caught 50-75 20"" + walleyes between 3 boats in about 3 hours in 9-12' water using leeches/crawlers on lindys/spinners and bottom bouncers (it didn't matter, everything worked!!) Our biggest walleyes were 29"" and my 10 year old (on his first trip) caught a 46"" Muskie back in Moose Bay! Clearly something has happened the last couple of years because the lake is missing the year classes of 14"" to 20"". Anyone have the answer? Hopefully the new regs will help, but I'm fearful that these 13"" walleyes will be 14-15"" by fall and the majority will end up in freezers and fry pans! Also, many of the small walleyes had parasites on the roofs of their mouths, does anyone know what they are? Harmful? Thanks for all the posts! The Minaki guys (Reels,Aaron, Craig, Slim, etc.) have always been so selfless in giving good info! Good Fishing! Eric"
549863,Guest,2005-06-28 15:28:00,0,"Eric, I have seen those parasites for many years up there...never seemed to be harmfull at all and were always found on the smaller walleye. In following up on your post, if I were looking for the bigger variaty of walleye I would concentrate on Big Sand (north shore), seems like you did well there as well."
549885,Guest,2005-06-29 09:12:00,0,"Hi Insurecic How many walleyes did u get over 28 inches,U caught them shallow for that area,was it good for a few days,Could u be more specific , i would apreciate it thanx"
549893,IaCraig,2005-06-29 11:24:00,434,"Eric - Thanks for the report. a few questions. 1. Was it overcast or was the water cloudy the day the big fish were in 9-12 foot? 2. Did you see Duane anywhere around, if so where was he fishing? 3. Were the numbers of fishermen down? Your experience gives some credibility to 2 of my walleye theories. 1 - Follow the wind, especially if it has been consistent for a while. 2 - Similar age classes of fish tend to school together to feed. When big-uns are hungry, the dinks go hide with the perch. Shhhhh about trappers cabin, there are no fish there . ;-) Just kidding, it is a popular spot and can be fire or ice. I usually stay away from it because when it is on fire it gets so crowded that there will still be a dozen boats parked on it 3 days after the bite has quit. This year I plan to target it more so my family can play on the beach & we can be in sight of each other. By parasites, do you mean those little leaches that hang on in their mouths? If so, yes I've noticed them and I doubt if they are harmfull. (the fish always look very healthy in spite of them) I've never kept a walleye much under 16"" for shore lunch yet. All reports have me thinking in 2005 I may need to or else I'll get tired of Spam :9 . To compound matters, other years I've been able to count on someone in my boat to out fish me. This Minaki trip will be my wife & young kids, so I expect most their action to be snags. :rotflmao: IaCraig"
549895,Guest,2005-06-29 12:15:00,0,Craig.....I fished up around trappers cabin six different times when I was up there a few weeks ago and never saw another boat even close to the area....if you can believe that.
549896,Guest,2005-06-29 12:47:00,0,"Aaron did u do well at trappers,all six days lol,hopin to catch some good ones,anyone fishin by the bridge."
549898,Guest,2005-06-29 13:25:00,0,"tons........visiting trappers six times in a week is nothing for me as I come in and go out fishing three times a day, but yes I did really well up that way, however, I was fishing for smallmouth not walleye. Did catch a few walleye casting for bass though."
549908,Guest,2005-06-29 15:24:00,0,"Guys, The days (Wednesday 6/22 and Thursday 6/23) we caught the bigger fish up on trappers in shallower had to be caused by the wind. I am only up there one week a year (usually the week after Father's Day) and have always believed that the Big Sand bite is dependent on the SW/W wind. We stay in private cabins on Harbour Island and if the wind is quiet, I usually stay in Little Sand or beat the water to a froth for smallies/muskies. The best day (Wednesday) the wind was consistent all day and we fished that spot from 2:00-5:30 (after not doing much east of sand beach and on the sand beach drop off and reef of of St. John's Island) I don't know who Duane is but we fished by 2 boats from South Dakota that we've seen before and they said they've been coming to Minaki longer than we have!! The parasites are what you said Craig and Aaron, those littlesuckers on the roofs of the mouths and like Aaron, I've only seen them on the ""dinks"". Understand what you mean Craig, I had my 10 year old along for his first trip so I was ""busy"" doing alot less fishing!! Well worth the memories though!! One tip... Every evening I troll cranks (normally #8 or #9 deep runner shad raps in perch, crayfish, silver or gold)fairly fast, 3.0-3.3 MPH in the west bay of Harbour Island in 14-20' of water and do quite well on walleyes and occasionally toothy critters! The walleyes were slightly suspended around baitfish and we generally caught bigger 20""+ fish. They never seem to respond to this during any time but 7:30-9:30. It works well out on Raspberry and on the reef between Raspberry and Harbour bay as well so I'm sure it is a lake wide pattern. Tons, we caught probably 8-10 walleyes in the 27-29"" range for 17 guys which I would say is down from normal. That was always the allure of Minaki for me...Big fish potential... I know I could go elsewhere and catch more fish(mainly walleyes I'm speaking of), but Minaki always had bigger fish. Are we ever going to get ""normal"" water levels again or have we established a new ""normal""? How do you guys handle the dock issues Aaron? Our guys docks are shot! and his floaters are over the posts holding them on! Good Luck to all! The trip sure comes and goes in a hurry! Eric"
549786,IaCraig,2005-06-27 09:54:00,434,"Some clarification please? The reports are saying almost everything was below the slot. My question: What are you calling the slot? Everything from 18 - 27.5 that you can not keep? Or is it the fish in the range of 13 - 17.75 that you can keep? I'm asking because the last few years most of what I catch at Minaki is over 20, and the good eaters are hard to find. So, if people are catching lots of 15 - 17 inch fish, that is Great! IaCraig ;)"
549788,Reels,2005-06-27 09:57:00,2876,"Lots of 13 1/2"" walleyes. Slot fish are hard to find. I could not find those 20-22"" fish this spring, and it sounds like no one else has yet either. I can't imagine they just dissapear? I agree, last few years, we could not catch smaller fish for lunch. It was a nice problem to have. <{{}}><"
549790,Guest,2005-06-27 10:35:00,0,Craig....my experiance was (and from others I have talked to) that most fish being caught were in the smaller protected slot limit. Meaning those fish were under the 13.78-17.72 allowable slot size. Probably is confusing to most people as the protected slot is under 13.78 and over 17.72. In other words fish between 13.78 and 17.72 were few and far between.
549792,Reels,2005-06-27 11:23:00,2876,"So, waht happened to all those big fish? Netted? Caught? Jumped the damm? Sounds like a case for CSI Minaki.... <{{}}><"
549794,IaCraig,2005-06-27 11:49:00,434,"Really?? So when everyone is saying ""the slot"" they are referring to the 13.75 - 17.75 inchers they can keep? So to paraphrase Sweept's post of 200+ fish in 4 days with only 3 in the slot and 3 over, they caught about 194 dinks under 13.75 inches, 3 eaters between 13.75 & 17.75 and 3 over 18? Wow.....what are people doing for shore lunch, rock bass & Spam? It's good to hear they are catching some younger age class, I hope they will have a chance to grow up. IaCraig"
549796,Guest,2005-06-27 12:07:00,0,Reels...I dunno. I guess we will have to see what the late summer evening trolling bite brings up on Big Sand. If they aren't being caught then I guess the MNR knows what they are talking about or it's a simple case of Alien abduction.
549797,Guest,2005-06-27 12:09:00,0,"Craig.......I don't want to quote Sweept but my guess is you are correct. Again, I spoke with one of our Candadian neighbors who said that his group caught several hundred walleye that week and they were all mostly under the allowable slot."
549799,woods,2005-06-27 12:34:00,646,"Reels - Our group caught many of the 12"" walleyes last week (18-25th). Largest was 27 1/2 out of Gun lake. Caught quite a few of the 20 to 24"" in Gun, Deadmans, A frames, Washtub. Big Sand was dead. The boathouse location you told me about yielded a 12 incher about every 3-5 minutes! Had to go without fish one of our fish nights due to lack of slot fish. Woods"
549800,Reels,2005-06-27 13:53:00,2876,"That is so weird, Gun has some big fish, but for numbers, at least for us, gun had smaller fish, and little or big sand had the schools of bigger fish. Glad you did find some though. <{{}}><"
549803,Guest,2005-06-27 14:48:00,0,"caught lots of 16 to 18 inch walleyes last weeknd.looking for big fish,could anyone help me"
549673,Guest,2005-06-23 14:56:00,0,"Just got back. The water is about 42 inches high, the weather was outstanding and we hammered the smallmouth...so much I didn't bother fishing for walleye but did catch some while fishing for smallmouth. Saw many boats fishing the typical early summer hotspots but was told by others that the walleye were scattered somewhat. We had very good luck with tubes, senkos and absolutely killed them in the evening on top water baits (mostly torpedos)....there were many spawning bass. It was a great week...and to top it off I caught a musky that was so big up on Big Sand we couldn't get it in the boat so I ended up yanking the lure from it's mouth at boatside, not an exact measurement but it was close to 55 inches. This fish hit a top water lure in the middle of the afternoon. I saw the biggest musky of my life fishing off of our dock so if your going up there fish the big bay on the east side of Harbour Island and hold on to your rod. Good luck fellas."
549679,Reels,2005-06-23 20:49:00,2876,Nice report. Glad the smallies cooperated! Any word on the walleye size? <{{}}><
549695,Guest,2005-06-24 07:55:00,0,"Reels...I spoke with one of our Canadian neighbors who had some guys up from Wisconsin for the week...he said they probably caught 300+ walleye that week and 75% were under the slot. His wife did land a 31 incher out by Raspberry island. My dad caught a few over the slot up on Big Sand but for the most part they were few and far between. Tell you what, Minaki looked like a ghost town and I saw fewer boats up there than I have in years...I suspect next year will be even worse for the resorts. Great smallmouth fishing last week and I have never seen so many musky up there before."
549701,Reels,2005-06-24 09:46:00,2876,"I was thinking the same thing, it seemed very bare to me. Nice though, being able to fish spots by yourself again. <{{}}><"
549746,Guest,2005-06-26 10:54:00,0,"Aaron thanks for all the info. My son and I had a great time on Minaki. In 4 days of fishing we caught over 200 fish 3 were over the slot 3 were in the slot and the rest were under. We also got some Smallmouths and Northerns. We had 1 musky on while we were fishing for walleyes, had it to the boat 3 times as I was going to net it, it spit out the 12"" walleye that was on my son's hook. Very Exciting!!!! We had that happen in A-Frame bay on Harbour Island. If I am not mistaken that is where your cabins are at. Thanks again to all who provided the info previous our trip, made the trip for a couple of greenhorn's a lot easier. Thanks Troy and Alex Sweep"
549763,Guest,2005-06-26 18:37:00,0,Sweep.....I think I was sitting down at the dock in my boat drinking a cold one when you guys hooked that walleye. I saw someone fighting a fish for a good while then only pulled up a small walleye.....guess it was you guys. Those red A-frames are ours. Glad you had a good time.
549777,doc,2005-06-27 07:52:00,143,"Aaron, Can you point me to some general areas for Smallies? I will be coming up july 9th for a week. Why is the fisherman count down? Doc"
549779,Guest,2005-06-27 08:41:00,0,"Sweeps where did u catch those big walleyes and all those fish,It would be nice if u could help me out ,thanx"
549780,Guest,2005-06-27 08:50:00,0,"I forget the name of the little lake, but it is just north of Bayview Resort. You have to pull the motor as you go in, but it is a very weedy lake. We had our best success with smallies throwing tubes into the weeds and at the weed edges. Most success was when we went to the right after we got in the little lake. Were there last week of July going to August last year, and the smallies were consistent there. The other good spot was in the northwest part of Little Sand Lake. It is just east of the narrows that lead to that channel to Roughrock Lake. There were a bunch of little islands that are nothing have steep rock ledges. We bounced tubes off of the rocks and let them fall. We also used slip bobber with leeches there and caught a bunch of smallies, but also caught a number of rock bass that way. There is one island that has a huge eagle's nest on the south side. That one was one of the better spots."
549785,Guest,2005-06-27 09:51:00,0,"Doc, send me an email at [email protected] and I'll get back with ya....going to be traveling today and tomorrow. I'll also be up there on July 9th for a week with my wife and kids."
