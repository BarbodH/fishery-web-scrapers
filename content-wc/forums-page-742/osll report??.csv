550348,Guest,2005-07-14 13:30:00,0,"gp-nj, nice report!! i believe i know you from the catch and release award plaque? i was wondering why you haven't won recently:-) of course 2 years ago andy smoked everyone w/his 34"", 10 lb. 10 oz. beauty that was released. you should see the false mount........absolutely beautiful. i love to bottom bounce and find it quite successful to but need to get my captain ""on board"" w/that technique so we can try it more often. by the way, what type of boat do you ""drag in""? obviously the clova had a word w/you on departure. did you have to drive into maniwaki to get replacement springs? if so, that really impacts the travel schedule. that's to bad. we've been there. we were trying to get in in one day and exploded the springs at about 9:15 pm, 30 miles from the lodge......we had to unhook, haul into to camp and russell and wilson hitched a trailer and we went back to transfer the boat and limped into camp around midnight.....it was a b@#$%, especially doing all that in the dark and getting eaten alive. the clova does call the shots, we'll never go in late in the day again. russell had ordered upgraded springs by the time we went for breakfast the next day, and then picked them up in maniwaki, and repaired our trailer while we fished all week. you simply can't beat that service. osll is fantastic, as is russel and his crew. great to hear about your trip!! bruce"

550351,beagle22b07,2005-07-14 13:58:00,34,"GP-NJ Thanks for the report. I just called the fellow that works on my motor and he told me how to measure for the springs. I'm definately going to get at least 1 for the trip. Also read on another site that fatigue is the #1 cause for failure. The older the trailer, the more likely you will have a spring failure. My trailer is a 1989 so I think the spares are a good insurance policy. They also talked about always replacing the u-bolts to the axle every time you remove them. Something about the stress in the bolts in tightening them. Anyways, I'll try to be prepared for whatever the Clova has to dish out, but hopefully won't have to use any of it. Was it the Clova Road that was bad or was it the road back into osll? I would think that the Clova Road gets enough traffic that it would be kept decent. Thanks again for the info. I'll post in mid August with a report on the fishing and the Clova experience. Larry"
550352,Lovetofish,2005-07-14 14:22:00,458,"I don't fish there, but you got my attention enough to order a spare spring. We fish near Pickle Lake so we put on a few miles. Thanks for the idea. I carry an extra hub and bearings so I may as well have a spring."
550362,GP-NJ,2005-07-14 21:44:00,156,"Bruce, Yes I am on the plaque and so is my bro John. I didn't notice it displayed in the lodge this year. I guess many anglers don't bother to participate. This year I did release 2 big walleye and decided not to bother with the C&R form- picture is good enough for me. I have a 15 ft Princecraft w/ vinyl floor & swivel seats. I tow the boat down the Clova road because of the comfort factor while fishing and I have the boat rigged to run Cannon electric downriggers if we decide to chase Lakers. We didn't fish lakers because we had walleye weather and fishing for them was good. When the road bit me I dropped trailer and drove to Mont Laurier to pick up 2 springs and hardware at Suspension DMS- they are located on left before center of town. Before the trip I mentioned to others in the group that I should have brought extra springs. These trips always creep up on us quickly and we always wish we had more time to prepare. I quess I'll get an earlier start on my list of things to do before our trip next year. Greg"
550402,Guest,2005-07-16 20:43:00,0,"GP-NJ You sound like you had an excellent week, and killed the eyes (not literally). I fish with Bruce and it was my boat in '04 that blew the spring on the trailer. And Russel fixed it while we fished. I love that place. We go second week of June; hope you can make it that week next year"
550407,GP-NJ,2005-07-17 06:26:00,156,"Andy, It was a great trip. Especially after not going the last two years. Russell does extend himself to make everybody's trip a good one even though experiences like the Clova road challenge do happen. Here's a link for two of my C&R eyes.http://groups.msn.com/FishingGreg/os...05.msnw?Page=1 Me, my brothers and nephew plan on a trip 7/8-7/15/2006 and my wife and I are considering another trip for the time period you will be there. I would like to try for Lakers on the earlier trip. Greg"
550410,Guest,2005-07-17 08:26:00,0,"Greg: Nicely done! And I recognize the backround in the first pic--now I know the hotspot...(not really) I am all for the C&R; eat the 17-22"" and toss all others. I hope you can make it that week and we can trade stories then. I'd like to see your Laker set up too. Counting the days.... Andy"
550309,Guest,2005-07-13 12:04:00,0,"thunderstick, well? pls report on your week and make us wish we were back in canada. i really need to go north more than once a year!!!!!!!"
550332,5Paulie4,2005-07-14 03:12:00,34,"Thunderstick The week began with the sighting of four moose on the very first day (at Clatouche) including a cow and two calves. One of our party then landed a 22 lb northern (c & l) plus we all got into the 6-10 lb pike. Walleye was excellent the first two days. The weather and a Mayfly hatch conspired to slow things down for two days but things gradually picked up as the week progressed. We tried your spot on the south end but it was on a slow day. One group blasted them there early in the week on bottom bouncers rigged with leeches. We dead sticked for pike but no monsters were caught. We tried some new spots, learned a few things, caught fish and had a great time. Another beauty at OSLL. Next year we go in mid June and the days are already being counted."
550333,GP-NJ,2005-07-14 05:50:00,156,"Bruce, Our group was there 6/25-7/5 and then I stayed another 3 days. This trip was the first trip back to the lac after missing the last two fishing seasons. The fishing was incredible! We always fish the lake with bottom bouncers as this pattern helps us find and stay on the walleyes. We caught many fish (too many to attempt to keep a log). Most fish were between 17 & 22 inches. What was most encouraging about the lake was the fact that we could find year class schools of fish any time of day. We found schools where most of the fish were the same size from 17"" to 20"". We often left these areas when the bite was still to target larger trophy fish. Our group of 4 fishermen caught 5 walleyes between 24 1/2"" and 31"". Bro Bill caught 1- 24 1/2""; bro John caught 1- 29"" and 1-30""; and I caught 1- 28 1/2"" and 1-31"". I caught several Northerns while fishing for walleye. BTW, We practice C&R and kept walleyes 17""-19"" to eat. I was able to land Northerns 34"" to 38"". I had larger ones on but my walleye snells were no match- several bite-offs. I don't target nor do I keep northerns so I never net or cradle them. On 7/6 there was a large mayfly hatch, they were on the north end of the lake water surface everywhere. Still caught fish but the action slowed. Changed presentation to establish new pattern. The Clova road? That's a loooong story for a different time..........."
550334,beagle22b07,2005-07-14 06:12:00,34,"GP-NJ What is the scoop on the Clova Road? I'm leaving for osll on Aug 05 and will be taking my 16 Sylvan boat. I realize conditions change daily, but was it really bad when you went in? Did you take your own boat? How long was the ride on the Clova? Anyways, can't wait to get there. This will be my first time at osll so I've been collecting information from bruce, andy, thunderstick and syracuse. I like the comfort of my own boat, plus it's rigged with downriggers for lake trout. Hope it's a good experience, I'm tired of going to new places every year. Larry"
550335,GP-NJ,2005-07-14 06:39:00,156,"Larry, There road is rough, rougher than other logging roads because of the lack of logging activity in the area at this time. The trip to the lodge was rough but was ok without any unscheduled events. It was indicated to me that Austin Gagnon from Stramond Lake Lodge (Russell's brother) who recently had a heart attack, maintains the road. We saw him by the entrance to the OSLL/Stramond road in his pickup truck and he appeared well. Now the ride out... This trip out was the worst I seen the road. We did have T-storms while at OSLL, and they usually destroy the condition of the road. It takes time and much work to improve the condition. One of the leaf springs on my trailer snapped in two. I got out o.k. after I replaced the spring. Long story........... It would be wise to bring extra springs and wheel hub/bearing assemblies if you decide to take on the road. Like I always tell people, the Clova road is the boss. It decides to let you in and let you out- hehe. I view it as one of the challenges of the trip. Be safe, hope this helps."
550338,Hump,2005-07-14 08:04:00,578,Where is OSLL
550340,beagle22b07,2005-07-14 08:28:00,34,"GP-NJ Did you have an extra spring with you? How do these springs break? Going too fast? Deep ruts? Just curious. Guess I'll need to get an extra spring to take along. Just had new tires put on the trailer and new wheel bearings last year so I should be OK in that department. I've taken the boat into what I thought was a real bad place 2 years ago without incident, just went very slowly. Took about 20 min to go the last mile to the lodge. What type of boat did you take in with you? Trailer problems are always on my mind and my worst fear. Larry"

550345,GP-NJ,2005-07-14 11:16:00,156,"The leaf spring snapped into 2 pieces approx. 2 1/2"" back from the front eye mount. The spring steel is 3/16"" x 2"". At the time of failure I was traveling at 20 m.ph. and the road was a rough washboard surface. I had no weight in the boat (all batteries & seats removed) The hull was secure with 3 ratchet straps across the gunnels; 2 ratchet transom tiedowns; 1 tiedown strap on the bow eye; and the 160 lb. Johnson 3 cyl. 25 h.p. outboard was secured with a transom saver/rachet tiedown strap. Ideally, it would be best to remove the outboard and transport inside the truck although this takes more effort and presents other problems. Over the years this setup has made it down the road several times without incident. My guess is the cumulative metal fatigue over time caused failure. Other most likely reason- I did note that the spring mounting/shackle bolts appeared to be too tight when I removed the broken spring. I was lucky that the spring broke instead of a weld failure on the trailer. During the winter I installed Tie-Down Engineering oil hubs/bearings which were flawless, no oil leaks past spindle seals. Don't forget the tools. Hope this helps."
550347,Guest,2005-07-14 13:11:00,0,"t-stick, sounds like another great year. as stated before, next year we'll be up in clatouche at least for a day. i'm glad to hear your success at the spot down south!! i love finding new, and in that case quite different fishing locations and structure. if your up the middle of june next year perhaps we'll finally meet as we go the 2nd week of june every year. until then, and its dar to long to wait, have good fishing."
