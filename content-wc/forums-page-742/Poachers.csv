550414,Guest,2005-07-17 12:04:00,0,Why do these idiots try to keep more than is allowed.If the meat is that important than stay at home and buy it at the supermarket for alot less money.Don't give us ethical sportsman a bad name.
550431,Canucker,2005-07-18 08:48:00,9,"Yep, I totally agree with you guys. The only reason I bother to post this here is in the hopes that these ""non-fisherman"" may suffer some additional embarassment for their actions. I don't understand people who abuse our natural resources. Is this just pure selfishness? Or what? Do they not have children and/or grandchildren who may want to participate in the outdoors in the future? GEESH!"

Wayne Sauve, 57, pleaded guilty to selling angler-caught fish on 10 different occasions without a license. He was fined $500 for each sale. Using a Quebec angling license and assumed name, Sauve sold fish caught in Ontario between December 22, 2002, and March 30, 2003. At that time, only angler-caught perch from Lake St. Francis could be sold within Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry. Fish caught in Ontario can no longer be sold without a commercial license. The sale of fish in the Cornwall area has been an ongoing investigation by Ministry of Natural Resources Conservation Officers for several years. In a related matter, two Quebec anglers, Eric Boucher, 26, of St. Valentine, and Francois Dulude, 43, of St. Jean, Quebec, were fined a total of $2,500 for illegally possessing fish from another jurisdiction. In March, 2003, both anglers possessed more crappie than allowed, They were fined $1,000 and $1,500 respectively. The infractions were discovered when conservation officers were investigating fish buying transactions. The possession limit for crappie in Quebec is 30 fish per person And Another FINED FOR FISHING IN WALLEYE SANCTUARY MINDEN - Two Haliburton men have been fined a total of $2,500 for fishing the Drag River fish sanctuary. Christopher Coty, 23, and Adam Henry, 21, who pleaded guilty, were also banned from angling for a year. Court heard that, on April 18 this year, an Ontario Provincial Police officer found the two men with a spear at the Haliburton sanctuary. He alerted conservation officers from the Ministry of Natural Resources office in Minden. The Drag River is a spawning site for walleye and the local community has invested funds and time in rehabilitating the sanctuary. Justice of the Peace D. Jackson heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Minden on July 7, 2005. Oops, did you intend to just show AMERICAN poaching issues - sorry!!"
550440,Canucker,2005-07-18 09:47:00,9,"Absolutely not - I live in MN by the by. And these ""non-sportsman"" do as well. American/Canadian whatever. I do not think that nationality is a prevalent factor or even location for that matter. Lack of character and extreme poor judgement maybe."
