I would be very appreciative of any other suggestion for this time of year. Thank you in advance for your help, JS"

I would think that if you can afford it that it would be well worth it...."
550180,Guest,2005-07-07 16:04:00,0,"We fished there a couple weeks ago for a day trip. Compared to other places on Lac Seul, it sucked. It seemed almost all the people there were taking long trips with guides to places like Japan Bay, about a 20 mile boat ride. Chamberlain Narrows has much better fishing, especially if you have a decent boat and know how to spinner rig. Just watch out for the owner Ken. Put a quarter between his butt cheeks and you'll get a dime back. However, there's one spot just north of Lost Island that the locals love in late July for monster walleye. It looks like a sand dune. Look for all the boats. Another great day trip from Souix Lookout is Sen Bay. It's about 10 miles north of the Deception Bay boat landing."

550192,Guest,2005-07-08 06:53:00,0,Thanks for the feedback folks. I'm open to ideas for the late July time period. We were hoping to be able to rent a decent boat rather than tow our rigs up from the states. On the web it looks like Lost Island has nice rental rigs but not worthy of a 20 mile run. Any other ideas for that time of year?
550202,Guest,2005-07-08 09:21:00,0,The facility and people at Lost Island Lodge are outstanding. Having talked to the guide from there he said that you might have a better chance at a wall mounter up in Chamberlain Narrows but otherwise fishing is about the same in both areas of the lake.

Seeings as i have travelled well over 20 miles in them, which didnt take me very long. Take note ive caught many walleyes all along the route of all sizes. great fishing, great lake, great times!:cheers:"
