550117,Guest,2005-07-06 07:59:00,0,I would suggest a Replica. There last longer and look better.
550128,Guest,2005-07-06 11:43:00,0,"Ditto on the replica Mount!!!!!! I just saw one in the Four Seasons Sport Shop in Ear Falls Ont. and that thing looked like it just came out of the water. Flexx something...it felt like a real fish....no skin over styro, but cushioned. Somebody else may have the name of the place to get them if not call Four Seasons. I am getting my pictures from past trips put together and having them do a stringer mount of all the big ones from the years. From what I understand you send them pictures and measurements and it comes back like you just took it off the hook, FABULOUS. And for only 10.50 and inch. Plus you get to tell people that it is still swimming in the same hole you caught it from, double bonus!"
550278,Guest,2005-07-12 11:20:00,0,The only problem is that is costs $7/inch is you do a skin rep. I have also seen alot of eplicas that I did not like at all. Looking for a skin mount.
550281,Guest,2005-07-12 12:14:00,0,"Don't do the skin dude!! Are you saying that conservation, maintaining our big fish population is not worth an extra 3.5 cents an inch? I pity your weak morals. Wait ten years and tell me how the skin mount looks then...i bet the replica would be looking pretty good. A big fish is not a prime spawning fish, it does not have the most viable eggs but what it does have is the right genetics. How many humans can grow to be 7 feet tall? Not all by any means right? The same holds true for fish, not every walleye has the right genetics to even reach 30 inches. And those that do have to struggle with all the other factors that are trying to kill them, so they don't need an uninformed angler yankin' them up and bonkin' them on the head so they can mount them...it just ain't right, and all the future 30"" babies it was going to have are now lost. Do the right thing and release the pigs for others to enjoy...you don't need the ""skin of the beast"" to treasure its memory thats what pictures are for. D"
550282,Guest,2005-07-12 12:57:00,0,I have 5 mounts of Walleye in my basement. Two of them are skin and three are replica. The skin mounts are older 15 yrs and 10 yrs and they dont look very good anymore. They dry out and get brittle and colors fade. They both were done by an excellent Taxidermist but any good Taxidermist will tell you that skin mounts age just like people. The replicas are awesome and will always look like new. People who see them are amazed by the realisim they portray. check out www.whitebeartaxidermy.com
550401,Guest,2005-07-16 20:38:00,0,"Consider the replica mount--really. I had a 34"" that I caught and happily released two years ago. I then sent photos and measurements to a taxidermist in Minnesota called Artitistic Anglers. These guys paint walleye year round and I didn't want one that looked like a largemouth bass (I'm from eastern Pa). The result was beautiful, right down to the detail on the fins. Check them out. If you google the name, you'll get the address. Good luck P.S. I have skin mounts too and they fade and get brittle with time and just don't compare to a good replica (and you can release the beast to be caught another day!)"
