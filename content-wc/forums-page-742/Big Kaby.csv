550377,Ketchenanny,2005-07-15 10:25:00,38,Was at Pine Portage the first week of the season. Temp's were high the whole week were were there. A couple of day's it got to the high 80's. Did not do as good on the number of fish this year but the size were bigger. Fish had already finished the spawn because of the warm water temp and were not in the spots we normaly found them. We had Dave as our guide and he worked his tail off putting us on fish. Tell Dave that Ralph from New Baltimore said hi and good luck fishing and have a safe trip.

Water levels slightly down. Average walleye size ever-increasing. Same strategy as always worked. Fish the wind. When no wind, find the holes. Minnows outproduced crawlers. Rattle raps were the top-producing crank. The only advice I could lend is that, although the MNR regs. have changed, I strongly encourage everyone fishing Big Kaby to stick with the lodge-recommended 16-22"" slot. Anyone who has fished there for more than a couple years can certainly see the positive impact this strategy has had on the walleye fishery. Good Luck and Good Fishin'"
