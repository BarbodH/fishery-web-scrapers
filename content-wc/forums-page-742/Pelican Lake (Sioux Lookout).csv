550411,Guest,2005-07-17 09:37:00,0,We have a cabin on Pelican in mid August. We always trailer our boats each day to Deception landing and fish Deception Bay and Sen Bay. Is it worth our time to fish Pelican for a day? It would be convenient to leave our boats in the water right below the cabin. The fishing is so good on Lac Seul that it is hard to mess with the formula. Thanks.

550426,Guest,2005-07-17 21:56:00,0,I can steer you on minnataki. Pelican is a different story. just below frog rapids this time of years is good at dawn and dusk. deeper though. 15 to 20 feet. they come in to eat. same goes with Abram chutes on minnataki with the same pattern. i have done well also at the top of the chutes on cloudy days. i have tried on deception a few times during June and have not found the fish in any concentraition. would not know were to begin. i have a cabin over on big v. but we fish lac suel and minnataki for eyes. i will be up there in a couple weeks with the kids. any advice on where to fish on deception this time of year?
550441,Guest,2005-07-18 09:51:00,0,We fish deception in mid-August. The fish are deep (20+). We have good luck on deep humps and in deep water off of shallow flats around islands with crawlers. I think that we will stick with Lac Seul unless I hear that Pelican is worth a shot. Thanks for the info.
