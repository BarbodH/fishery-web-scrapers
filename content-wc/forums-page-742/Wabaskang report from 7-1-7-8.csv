550394,Guest,2005-07-15 22:45:00,0,We will be traveling Des Moines. We will have two groups of Four.I am hoping to get into some big northerns.quality is more important to me than quantity.I am not against catching alot of big fish though.It will be nice to talk to you up there.
550418,Guest,2005-07-17 15:27:00,0,"I guess I didn't see you Big Mike, you should have stoped. I had the kids up, we had some tough days but mostly did well on walleyes and pike, just no real big ones. We were up for two weeks and the second week it was just the wife and I. That week my house in Iowa got broken into and they took my computor among other things. Using a borrowed one right now. Probably going to be a while before I can get back on here regularly."
550427,Guest,2005-07-17 22:40:00,0,"Sorry to hear about the break-in...hopefully the police will be able to run across your things. I'm pretty sure I seen you working on your eavespouts or something. Give me a p.m. at [email protected] I'd like to chat with you about some other topics. Thanks, Mike"
550237,Guest,2005-07-10 17:09:00,0,"Well, every once in a while a trip falls into place EXACTLY the way you would hope it to. That was the case last week. Despite a mayfly hatch that had occured last week and into our trip, the walleyes were still feeding. We caught numerous walleyes already in their traditional summer spots. The key was early morning and late evening, and even better when it was cloudy. Typical jigs and minnow combos were the norm, but we caught walleyes on cranks, leeches, and crawlers as well. Northern fishing was truly awesome as we caught over a dozen OVER the slot! The numbers of fish were not there but the quality definately made up for it. Our biggest was just over 40"" and we had alot in the 38 and 39"" range. Baits included jerkbaits and spinnerbaits, both casted and trolled. Towards the end of the week the weather turned really warm and the bite for both species really headed south as we found ourselves back in camp both Thurs and Fri in the afternoon drinking Labatts instead of getting beat by the sun and heat. TRAILERGUY...fished out front of your place couple of days but didn't see you until Thurs afternoon it appeared you were working on your eavspouts and we were just getting ready to head in and fry some fish. Maybe we'll hook up again. Did I see you on the lake anywhere? If so, I didn't recognize your boat."
550240,Guest,2005-07-10 21:05:00,0,"12 of us guys fished wabaskang lake hard,& stayed at tall pines camp from July 1st-9th. despite the fly hatch going on,& the excess minnow forage,fishing was pretty good. would of been nice to run into trailer guy or big Mike,...maybe next time. will fish wabby again. too much water,.....not enough time."
550243,Guest,2005-07-10 23:02:00,0,"John, I was the guy flying all over #### in the Team Crestliner boat. I had 3 guys w/me that wanted to catch big fish. We burned almost $300 worth of gas doing all that spot jumping! It was worth it though to see them guys catch some nice fish. What did you think of the storm we got Sun? It was wicked out on the Big Lake when it hit!"
550244,Fred_G,2005-07-11 06:49:00,908,"Boy, I must have been on a different lake than you guys last week. I had the most frustrating week of fishing I've ever had. We scratched out enough for a couple of shore lunches, but not much else. I've fished Wabaskang for three years now and thought I knew some good spots, but just wasn't able to put it together. Found loads of baitfish everywhere, and of course the mayfly hatch. I had blamed our poor results on that and the changing weather. Now I'm wondering what we were doing wrong. We tried minnows, leeches, worms, crankbaits and anything else we could think of. I'll be going back the second week of September. I sure hope it isn't as tough then."
550249,Guest,2005-07-11 09:51:00,0,"Hey Mike, So that WAS you in the big crestliner boat I saw all week,...nice boat. We made it back to camp before the storm hit. We were finishing up a shore lunch on the SW end of lake 4 when I heard some thunder in the distance. We planned to check out mud lake,but decided to call it a day with the black clouds rolling in. Was a good move as the winds were well over 40mph for awhile. Glad it didnt last long. I would of hated to be there last week with the nasty storm that took many trees down. Fred_G, Walleye fishing was tough,& we worked hard for everything we caught. Many fish between 12""-16"" on jig/minnow in deeper water. Best fishing times were early morning,& evening for us. Much bigger fish caught at night drifting jig/minnow,crawlers,or leeches on top of mid lake humps. Lots of pike caught,nothing over 28"",quite a few big perch,& a mess of CPR'd smallies caught around the islands. We fished lakers for a few days with no luck. Over all,......a very good trip, I will be back."
550267,Guest,2005-07-11 22:07:00,0,"Fred G...to sum up John's reply, he's with me in the fact the best fishing was definately early in the day and again in the evenings. There were a few days that because of Mr. Labatts we did't get out until after 0800 and as soon as we hit the water I knew it was too late for quality walleyes so we started norhern fishing. We typically fished for northern until 6:00 pm then would fish walleyes until 9:30. (That makes it tough on the drinking part of the trip when you don't start until 10:00 and want to get up halfway early to walleye fish) From my perspective if you wanted numbers of walleyes you needed to go all the way to the last lake and fish the humps and sunken islands. I did fine on the reefs on the big lake but again mostly in the early hours and late evening. Smallies...they were being caught hand over fist by many in Jim's camp but the northern fishing was so good I didn't chase them much. I did see alot of nice ones in areas on the big lake which they chased my northern jerkbaits. John...next year if your up same week you'll have to give me the wave over as i'm passin by and we'll chat about the fishing. As you probably noticed I was on a mission this trip for big fish as the next two trips my wife and small boys will be along so it won't be as hardcore. Fred...good luck in Sept..it will rock!"
550270,Fred_G,2005-07-12 05:50:00,908,"Thanks Mike. I appreciate your input. We had a couple of young boys in our group so we didn't get out very early. Usually between 8 & 9 AM. And they were pretty tired of sitting in a boat after 8 - 10 hours, so we didn't get out in the evening either. I knew there had to be a good explanation for our not doing well. I've had good success on the lake before. I'll chalk this one up as a learning experience."
550366,Guest,2005-07-14 23:23:00,0,Hey Big Mike We have a group of guys going to Wabby Sept. 17.We usally go in mid June.What will the difference be for northerns and walleye.Thanks for any info.
550367,Guest,2005-07-14 23:50:00,0,"The week of Sept 17th will be one of the best times to fish Wabaskang if you enjoy jigging. The walleyes have made their descent out to DEEP water...I'm talking 35 to 45 feet. Most guys are using 3/8 and 1/2 jigs w/minnows around Doe, Devil's, and other deep areas on the lakes. Many of the year's best walleyes are caught during this week in Sept. Expect very cold weather for the most part, but don't be surprised if you are dealt some very pleasant days as well. It starts to get dark shortly after 7:00 pm so you don't have as much time on the water nor the amount of sunlight to keep things warm. Northern fishing should be excellent as well with scores of large northerns returning to shallow bays and weedbeds to feed for the winter months. Many of these fish haven't seen lure all year because they have been out in deep, cool water all summer chasing tullibees and whitefish. This is time frame is probably a person's best chance at catching a truly legitimate trophy northern because they will be getting fat for winter, developing egg growth, and hammering alot of lures because they are actively feeding. You won't find many weeds standing anymore...don't let that fool you, the fish will still use the same weed beds just stay out near the deep drop offs coming out of the bays and weed beds...it will be great. I'm hoping to make a trip up there the same week with a group from my hometown that goes up that week every year, still trying to eeek out the vacation."
550383,Guest,2005-07-15 13:55:00,0,Thanks alot for the very helpful answer. We will be staying at Jim & Julies.
