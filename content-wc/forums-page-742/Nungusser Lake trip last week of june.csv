550384,sidewinder,2005-07-15 14:20:00,96,you are correct on dock hands .that is reason for the policy. they work until last boat is in or 9:45. We are used to taking care of ourselves and not being waited on. We seem to fish late and sleep in. some of my best fishing for walleye and pike is just before and after sunset. If we go back we will adapt to their policy sidewinder
550424,sidewinder,2005-07-17 21:31:00,96,"I am trying to put together one more trip late aug,with my wife. I have checked the rates and they are very reasonable. Would you recommend Gull Rock? Is it a difficult lake to learn? thanks sidewinder"
549277,sidewinder,2005-06-14 23:46:00,96,Going to Nungusser Lake for first time. Would like some advice and pointers on where and how to fish lake for walleye and pike this time of year. thanks sidewinder

550318,Guest,2005-07-13 19:08:00,0,"Keeping in mind I usually go in late June. We do well on all the typical patterns. If the weather is consistant, trolling spinners with minnows and minnow baits thru the 8-10 ft of weeds will produce. Once you find a school switch to jigs. If you can't find them in the shallows, then use a 1/2 oz jig in 15-30 ft. Bobbers work real well for the deep points. You need to use minnows! Worms don't seem to work. Never tried leeches. The bays near the camps get much more traffic, but produce. We like to take a drive to the less hit spots. Good luck. Post when you get back."

550354,sidewinder,2005-07-14 15:04:00,96,I am new to this site. Had hoped for feedback before we left. Assumed nobody had fished Nungusser. We travel from Tennessee to Canada once a year. Envious of you guys that seem to live up there. Our discussion in the car (i may submit this to the forum) is can you have quality fishing trips at drive-to camps? The answer seems to be yes but we only have one shot a year and try to limit visits to lakes that are hard to get to. What are your thoughts? sidewinder
550359,Guest,2005-07-14 20:49:00,0,"It's around an 18 hour drive for me to. I've tried several drive to lakes thru the years and have had limited success. Nungusser lake has been the most consistent Walleye catch. We have gotten to know the lake so we do not spend much time searching for fish. I know some people in camp can struggle to catch more then their limit, but I think it is their fishing style that is the problem. Our group moves around a lot and radio the other boats in when we find a pattern. If we don't catch something of size on a spot in 10 minutes, we move. I've noticed that big fish travel together. The lake can be finicky at times. One plus with a boat-in lake is that there are less limitations on gear (beer). A problem I've seen is that boat-in lakes can get more pressure, especially if there is a public boat launch and privaate cabins. I've tried to stay away from those lakes. Dispite this, I've been interested in all the posting about Lac Suel. It sounds like the fishing is great, crowded though. I think you need to do your research. Ask the owners about the amount of lodges on the lake, size of the lake, has it ever been netted, is public access availible. If you do your research, I think there are plenty of remote boat-in lakes with limited pressure in Canada. Just do a little surfing. It's definitally cheaper then flying in."
550378,Guest,2005-07-15 10:28:00,0,I fill Lac Suel and Gullrock lake are just as good as Nungesser. and more reasonbily priced. I have fished all three lakes more than once.
550382,Guest,2005-07-15 13:22:00,0,"I've fished Nungesser off and on for 15 years now. I also like the idea of a boat in lake because you don't have the weight limits of flying, the cost is less than flying, weather doesn't keep you from getting in or out, and there is less fishing pressure than a drive to lake. Nungesser Lake lodge also has a conservation fish camp policy so even though there may be more pressure than a fly to, the big fish are being released. I find it interesting your concern about having to be back in camp by 9:45 PM. It has not been my experience that may guys need or want to fish that late in Canada. I like the idea that if a boat isn't back by dark the camp will go looking for them. If there's no curfew they may not come looking. Plus I think it's fair that the camp wants to get the boats gassed up and ready for the next morning at a reasonable time. The dock hands I've seen work dawn to dusk already."
