However it was 90+ degrees bright sunshine and windy (hard to hold the boat) . but tonight they are forecasting thunder storms so maybe the weather will be better in the next couple days and the bite will improve"
550408,Guest,2005-07-17 07:26:00,0,Last week was great I had 1 group of 43 guys they eat fish everyday and took limits home. 6-8' of water on lindy rigs. Yesterday new gang in camp seen fish going into the cleaning house so they must of been biting. Mayflys seem like they're done so it can only get better.
550409,Guest,2005-07-17 07:32:00,0,"grt1 how did that jack taste, get all the bones out. If you need some walleyes come on over I'll put you on the hot spot."
550413,Guest,2005-07-17 10:50:00,0,"I was just doing some math regarding your group of 43 guys.IF each guy only ate 1 fish per day, for a week, and took home a limit, that one group took 473 fish out of such a great fishery,in just 7 days.Hopefully not all anglers are doing this,as there won't be much for the rest of us to look forward to a few years down the road. Gullrock is big, but not that big."
550425,grt1,2005-07-17 21:45:00,259,"no jack for me but I'll probably over for some tips and minnows, just trying to digest some deep fried turkey right now."
550451,Guest,2005-07-18 15:02:00,0,"Concerned angler, to let you know most of the camps on our chain of 5 lakes are harvesting less fish than in years past, due to the conservation measures of the camp owner enforcring thier own slot and paying for their guest conservation licences.Every year I have guest and locals tell me that the lakes are getting better for size and numbers."
550453,bevy8,2005-07-18 15:22:00,8,"Craig, Just returned late last night from GullRock. Really slow the first two days due to the heat and wind I imagine. The last two days Saturday and Sunday, we hammered them. Nothing really big, 23 was our largest (30 incher was caught in camp on Saturday) but plenty of fish 15-21. Unlike one of the posts above we were in 15-18 ft of water pulling lindy rigs with everything from spinners to plain hooks. We used minnows most of the time with crawlers occasionally by some of the guys. Leeches on a bare hook got hot one night. We fished the main lake most of the time, the Rock and Fisherman's. Had the places to our selves most of the time, heard most boats were up in Ranger or in Keg. There was a lot of boats over on the sunken island just west of the Rock for most of the week, don't know how they were doing but they camped out for most of the week. Hope this helps.....and Good Luck! PS- Leave a couple in the lake, heading up again in late September!!"
550456,cough6609,2005-07-18 16:55:00,48,"Thanks Bevy...A co-worker just got back from Bluffy Lake, just north of Ear Falls and talked about how the heat turned things off for the first couple of days of his trip. Things ""heated"" up though as he boated a 33 inch 'eye on Friday. He did Catch, Photo and Release...although I think a sow that old is no longer reproducing...at least someone else has a chance of catching her. Eleven days and counting!!! Craig"
