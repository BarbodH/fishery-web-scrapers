Didn't see you much while we were there, too much time on the water I guess ;-) We found the fish mainly in what I would call a summer pattern. Main lake points, reefs, and islands did the best for us. We caught fish at both falls, but not as many as I had thought we would. Once we started hitting windswept areas our fishing improved dramatically. While we didn't catch 100 fish a day per guy, we certainly caught 40-60. I rebooked with Yolanda on the way out. Will definitely be returning to Ogoki. LOTS of water to try."

550397,jigman 2003,2005-07-16 18:19:00,981,"No big pike in our group. Several 36"" and numbers of 30-34"". They are definitely in there though. Caught numbers of good size 'eyes with some helacious scars on them. No 36"" pike did that damage. We caught LOTS of 'eyes from 18""-23"". Biggest was a 24 1/2"". That far north it is not real commonplace for fish much over 25"". They are there, but for a mounter I would stick with Erie. I would recommend Ogoki to anyone, and Mattice Lake Outfitters are the best I have ever used, hands down. Very nice people, quality accomodations, excellent fishing, etc. Give them a shot, you won't be disappointed. If you go the last week of June in '06 I'll see you there."
