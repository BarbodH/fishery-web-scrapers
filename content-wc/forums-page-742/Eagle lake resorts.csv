550294,dutchboy,2005-07-12 17:26:00,5717,Call each lodge and get a client list for this year and last year and give those folks a call. They should be able to help you out.

550299,Guest,2005-07-12 22:05:00,0,i have had some freinds stay at century lodge with good accomidations and good muskie fishing. Temple Bay has always been the production resort. i have never stayed but those first timers i have known have said the production is good. back in the early 90's when we stayed on eagle we used eagle lake island lodge and had good accomidations and great time. Keep in touch if you ever get up the Lac Seul way.

550310,Guest,2005-07-13 12:18:00,0,"You are looking at very different parts of the lake. Temple Bay is south and is a larger resort that runs a bus to big cities (Chicago, Twin Cities) so is a way different feel than Andy Myers which is a more ""rustic camp"", great fishing camp though. Cedar Point is a very nice resort and as the other post said you won't find nicer people. There is another camp on the north west-central part of the lake called Stanleys Resort that is really nice. You need to look at their web sites to get and ask others on this web site the better areas of the lake to fish. Once you settle on an area then narrow down the resort. If you are going to rent a boat look at that as well. Some have the basic 16' 20HP combinations other have way nicer boats with trolling motor, live wells and electronics. I have stayed at Andy Myers and Cedar Point. Andy Myers is more of a ""fishing camp"" and Steve Herbeck will make you feel right at home. Cedar Point and Stanleys are more polished and may have more stuff for your son to do if he is not a full time fisherman. Good luck, Paul"

I have boats on some of the same lakes and I get good trout and walleye on them. eagle is a tough lake to fish but if you find the fish, you'll get some excitement, I have caught 5 pound walleyes and 15 pound northerns and 10 pound trout all in the west arm."
550412,bailey,2005-07-17 09:38:00,22,"We just returned from Eagle Lake (west arm) Stayed near Stanleys at Sportsmens Lodge. This is less expensive than Stanleys and just as nice. Stanleys is a larger camp and has dock guys that meet you when you come in and clean your fish for you. So if you want those amenities, Stanleys is for you. But we don't need those amenities so we prefer Sportsmens Lodge. (We stayed at Stanleys last year. ) Sportsmens Lodge has same great boats/new Yamaha motors and nice cabins but is smaller camp. Nice people run it (Jim and Cindy Buhlman) I can look up their web site address if you want it. I think you can do a search under Eagle Lake Sportsmens Lodge and get to it."
