I understand that you have to travel down Williams Creek to get into Lac Seul. (about a 30 minute boat ride?) Is the creek level ever too low to allow you to get into Lac Seul? Because that would be a deal killer. Also, I've heard varying reports on the walleye in that area of Lac Seul. Some say its the best, others say that there are no fish there! Any help would be appreciated"

His group does quite well for quantity and size of walleyes. They are very happy with Williams Lake Lodge. Regarding water level, the level is managed by the LWCB to rise through the season. You can research that at the LWCB site.http://www.lwcb.ca/ I have fished Lac Seul for over 30 years. Only dabbled a couple times in this area of the Lac Seul due to the distance to travel."
6278474,Limeyangler,2019-01-13 05:25:00,563,"Like JDP said, never heard the creek being too low to get to the main lake and the water was very low last year, so if his buddies still had no issues you will be fine. I have fished this area hundreds of times, if people say there are no fish there they are either protecting the spot or should take up golf or knitting."
6278478,Rodbender351,2019-01-13 06:22:00,8,I have been there quite a few times in the past and never had a issue with the water level in the creek. We no longer go there because of the long ride everyday.
6746059,Steve Comerford,2023-06-23 08:28:00,28,"I also am interested in Williams Lake Lodge. As I understand it, during mid-late summer you want to focus on the main basin areas. Doesn't everyone (except the houseboat guys) have a long drive to the main basin areas? I don't see any lodge that is close."
6746245,Limeyangler,2023-06-24 08:33:00,563,"No need to travel much further than where the creek gets you to. Plenty of points, reefs and bays that produce numbers and size."
