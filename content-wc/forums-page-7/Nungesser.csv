6746407,Spurgery,2023-06-24 20:28:00,79,Uh. Yes they do. Went there once. Never again.
6746435,Da' Walleye Assassun,2023-06-24 23:55:00,358,Three posters have told us how bad the lodge is. Not one has told us why. Why be so secretive?
6746439,pjshorthorn,2023-06-25 04:11:00,5654,Curiosity got the better of me Looked at their FB page. The Lodge had a glowing customer report on 6/3 and then on 6/17 their FB page was suspended for multiple violations of FB policies. No customer reviews were posted on the lodge website either. Those two things alone would make me take pause but that is just me. PjShorthorn

6235538,yoopertrout,2018-08-20 11:32:00,1172,"Also, the post is so garbled, it's hard to follow. Stop, think, and punctuate. Also, learn the difference between ""there"", ""their"", and ""they're."" The post is painful to read."
6235682,TritonEbbs,2018-08-20 18:23:00,16,I went to Angler's Kingdom and while the lake is heavily populated with Walleyes and Pike I wouldn't recommend this lodge... Nungesser has a few other resorts that would most likely be a better option Ebbs
6235694,packpro,2018-08-20 18:47:00,695,"Not sure what ""may"" have happened here. I was there twice 10 years ago. Thought it was pretty good. We had a large group so we had the new big cabin on the end of the island. Have to admit some of the other cabins looked like could need some work, but we never heard any complaints from those staying there. I know they lost their best camp caretaker a few years ago to an unfortunate unexpected passing. We chose AK as our outfitter for the boats. The other camps has 10hp and 15hp motors at the time. Most of those guests stayed in the bays near their camps. AK had nice boats. 40HP and 50HP motors. Boats had live wells, locators, and large fishing platform in the front. They were relatively new back then. We fished the whole lake and got to far away spots quickly. Those were the better spots in the early season. The owner is pretty laid back, but he has been in 100's of camps and knows what it take to run one. Surprised to hear. Our group had a great time. On the first trip we used the frozen minnows offered. Not bad just messy. Caught fish for sure. On the second trip the owner worked with us and arranged for 240 dozen (12 guys)to be at the end of our dock. Food was good in camp, and we had a weekly fish fry. As for the fishing. We didn't pay for a guide. No need to . Owner put us on fish both trips. Gave us number spots and large fish spots. Also gave us big pike techniques based on the season. Saw him guiding every day on the spots he gave us."

6235752,Golden Eagle,2018-08-20 21:00:00,2642,Pretty sure the guy you're talking about is Ron Mountain.
6746131,Steve Comerford,2023-06-23 12:57:00,28,Sounds like your friend is the nightmare. No other guests report anything like you described.
6746143,v-bay gord,2023-06-23 15:06:00,3168,Why is a post from 4 years ago even relevant?
