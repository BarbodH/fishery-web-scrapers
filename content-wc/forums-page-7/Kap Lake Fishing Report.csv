We stayed one night there and then traveled across the border to Geraldton for the next night. We stopped at Young’s General Store in Wawa for worms and anyone who had yet to purchase their license. We saw 2 young bull moose and one fox beating the heat by lounging in a rock near the road. We drove to Nakina early Saturday (June 10) morning for a 6am sea plane flight to Kap Lake. Kap Lake is an approximately 6 mile long, 1 mile wide lake that fishes walleye, pike, and the occasional perch. Four (4) guys from Indiana were before us and said it was very warm during their week. The first day we saw temps in the 40’s and 50’s. The next days after the temps seemed to rise about 10° each day. By Monday, we saw temps in the 80’s. The temps started going back down after that. On Monday (June 12) we noticed smoke rising above the tree line. On Tuesday, the smoke settled on the lake and we couldn’t see much more than 40 yards in front of us. That proved to cause some navigation issues that day. We decided to portage to a nearby lake that got us out of the smoke and up the river system for a little adventure. The smoke dissipated by the afternoon but never truly left the lake and surrounding area. During the flight out, we learned the wildfire was 12-15 miles away and was causing quite a bit of havoc near the Ogoki Lake area. We did notice an influx of planes heading that direction throughout the week. As far as fishing, we fished pretty hard, but felt like we could have caught more fish. We caught approximately 2,120 fish with 1,884 being walleye. Nothing overly huge but the average walleye size seemed to be 18-19”. Catching that number of fish set a new total number caught record by nearly 1,000 fish. We couldn’t believe the number of fish we caught. We caught over 300 walleye on 3 different days. One day we caught over 400 total fish. Our group caught 8 or so pike over 35” with two of them being 39” or more. One pike was caught after the fisherman originally caught a walleye and then the pike decided to feast on the struggling walleye. The walleye was pulled from the pikes mouth. Both the walleye and pike swam off upon release. The water levels seemed to be higher than when we were on Kap Lake in 2019. The group before us said the water levels dropped 3 feet during their week and 4 feet during the week prior. On Thursday (June 15) we got to witness the northern lights around 1:30am. We did see a mama moose with her baby one day. Overall it was a great week disconnected from the rest of the world and a great week of fishing. We flew out June 17th and made the 21 drive home to West Virginia."
