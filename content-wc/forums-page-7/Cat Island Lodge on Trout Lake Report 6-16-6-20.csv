Caught tons of walleye, with more 22-24 this year than last. Fish were on main lake humps and wind-blown points, 1/4 oz jigs did all the damage. Trout were good on the first day, I hooked one I could never turn, but that bite died after the first day. I caught two 40 northerns on a big spinnerbait and a 37 on a walleye jig. Weather started cool and got as hot as I've seen it in Canada. Saw two bears that were hanging around the lodge and a caribou swimming across the lake. Can't wait until next year. I don't know how photos got turned upside down."

6746633,Juls,2023-06-26 04:06:00,13414,That happens when the photos are too large. I fixed it for you. Nice fish!

If you can't see it, then just expand that little window, or scroll down to see the info. I use an app to reduce the size of my photos before posting them. It's called, ""PhotoResize""...and, it's easy to use. After it reduces the size, it sends them to a destination folder of your choosing on your computer, so you still have the original size in your photo album, and the reduced size in the other folder."
