Lee from PAC gave me a fancy knife for being a long-time customer- very cool. Would be hard to go somewhere else.We absolutely slaughtered them in Otatakan this year. The water was down about 2-3 feet from last June's really high water. We were able to explore the entire lake (islands, outlflows, arms/branches of lake) and found many new great spots. On the last day we fished around the big Island on the east end and between 2 boats in 2-3 hours we caught 150-200 northerns- it was unreal- they were feeding on minnows and would bite on anything. We brought several Northerns home this year, which is unusual for our group. This trip may have been the best trip ever for me as far as size/quality, consistency and good Northern fishing. You will enjoy!"

6746703,danvan18$,2023-06-26 08:33:00,67,"We used no live bait, Uncle Rico and Perch Berkley ripple shads were the favorite. Also one guy did awesome on the Mister Twister spinners with a ripple shad body. I know you like live bait, but might want to give these a try."
6746705,emma17,2023-06-26 09:10:00,436,"Nice report Eck. 25 Walleye and 35 Pike are beautiful fish, especially as they come to the surface. The hot weather is tough. We fished last week of May, it was hot everyday. I prefer long pants and a light jacket."
6746735,Eckohlt,2023-06-26 11:26:00,3685,"I used plastic also,they gobbled that up also,ripple shad n I had some old sassy shad,flyin lakes they ain't fussy what they eat,unlike humans haha."
6746737,Eckohlt,2023-06-26 11:27:00,3685,Thanks Emma.Ditto on the clothes.
6746833,wdkott,2023-06-26 17:54:00,26,"Danvan, can you provide some specifics on size/quality, consistency, and good northern fishing? I am organizing a trip to Otatakan for May 2024 and would like to let our group know what they can expect from someone who just fished Otatakan this Spring."
