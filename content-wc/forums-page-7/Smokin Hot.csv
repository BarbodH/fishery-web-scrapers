The smoke from the Quebec fires was noticeable and the week was hot and windless. Not what I would have chosen but you get what you get. We took a guide our first day and we learned and enjoyed a far off part of Lady Evelyn Lake that we haven't fished before. We had a great shore lunch, something we hadn't done for a long time, prepared with our own catch. The heat was so bad that my buddy and I would come in at noon and go back out after dinner, a good move. The Garden Isle staff looked to our every need. The food was good, equipment, cabins, boats always serviced and ready to go, were handled by a friendly and attentive staff. We fished mainly for walleye. Found them even in the hot still conditions and filled our limits. More important we met good fellow fisherman, had a great camp fish cookout. and totally enjoyed the well run camp. It wasn't the wild experience that we've had on some past trips but fit's our group now. We may go back next year. Time will tell as our groups age will dictate, but this one was a gooder."
