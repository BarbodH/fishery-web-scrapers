6745827,rather-be-fishin,2023-06-21 21:52:00,429,"What part of Lac Seul are you fishing & where are you staying? All we use are primarily jigs 1/4 to 3/8 oz. Pink, Chartreuse, Purple, Gold, Orange, White, blue & gold glitter. Aspirin jigs with red eyes, Moon Eye jigs & Danlure jigs work well. Colorado Spinners blades hammered gold, purple, orange, pink. Klass, Willow & Tommy Harris Spider Spinners work well too. Good luck & have a blast fishing! You wonâ€™t be disappointed! Two months & the countdown is on for our 20th year & this year 2 weeks to the mighty Lac Seul!!! Plus, bringing the grandsons 11 & 13 y/o for their 1st trip!!! Cant wait! RBF"

6745871,Mojo-NC,2023-06-22 07:43:00,1929,"In September the fish will still be pretty deep - focus on around 25' depth. Find fish with spinner rigs and then jig 'em up. Focus on places where deep water comes close to the shoreline and on deep water points and humps. Pull some deep water crankbaits like Rapala Deep Runner, Flicker Shad, Salmo Hornets, and Hot 'N Tots in any water that looks ""fishy"". You'll learn pretty quickly where the fish are and what they want. Also pay attention to where other boats are fishing and check it out after they leave if you get a chance. If they stayed there for a while, you'll know they were on fish. Look for other similar places. Try not to fish deeper than 30' as the mortality rate is high in deep water. Good luck and tight lines!"

6745971,Pooch,2023-06-22 15:07:00,4618,"Early September can be (weather) really hot or really cold. One year it was the hottest weather of the summer trips and next year we all but froze in that same time frame. Cold, wet windy.It is kind of pretty up there with the softwoods yellows against the stark greens of the pine trees. Post a report when you get back.Pooch"
6745977,MikeAnkeny,2023-06-22 16:12:00,67,We are staying at Gold Pines second week of September and we usually do well in Steamboat that time of year.
6746021,pjshorthorn,2023-06-23 04:16:00,5654,"I have fished the East End of LS a lot. In the fall I followed a pattern close to what Mojo suggested. As Pooch indicated, the weather can be squirrelly, but I love that time of year in Canada. Try all types of tactics and patterns. You'll find the fish. Just cover ground and then just sit on them if you get a few consistent bites in a spot. If you find necked down areas with a bit of current , try those too. Wind blown points for sure ..start upwind and then drift over the point, in and out, and then down that shoreline . I'll bounce in and out on that drift trying to find where the fish are holding. I hope you have a safe and an amazing trip. One day I'll get to the west end of LS been hard leaving the east end. PjShorthorn"
