6745587,Kman67rsss,2023-06-21 06:24:00,30,We are headed up the end of July for the 1st time in 3 or 4 years. Not looking good. I’m planning on bringing my 9yo for his 1st time. Not sure I can listen to him talk about it for another year if we get canceled.&#x1f602; We fly into a house boat not too far from obedjiwan
6745879,Bigredmf,2023-06-22 08:29:00,129,Maybe time to check with outfitters south of there that are currently open.I will be curious how full Lac Dumoine has been when I get there next week.
6746049,Peterpikes,2023-06-23 07:56:00,33,"I see the Gouin is still closed. I’m sorry about your trip. I’ve been fishing the Gouin for 20+ years and every year I see you on this message board so I know you have many years on that water too. I’m supposed to go 7/21, but I’m doubtful that any trips will happen in July. My thoughts and prayers are with the communities and outfitters in Quebec, it’s been a rough go for them canceling trips with Covid and now the fires. I do wonder how these fires will effect the Gouin in years to come though. Those few days of crappy air quality we had here in NY really put a perspective on how bad it must actually be up there. All the ash, soot, and nitrates finding it’s way into the Gouin could be devastating to the spawning grounds. Cancelling trips because of Covid sucked at the time, but I convinced myself that it may be a good reset for the Gouin by limiting fishing pressure for a year or 2, but fires have me worried for for future trips. It’s a shame, it’s such a beautiful fishery. Hopefully I’m just overthinking it."
6746055,tweedrules,2023-06-23 08:21:00,107,"Peterpikes Yeah we are cancelled. Really sucks. Like you, I feel for the outfitters. We re booked for another Gouin site through our outfitter (Air Mont Laurier). East Bay. We usually fish Lac Du Male but this is all we could get. We are going 8/21-8/26. I know August fishing is difficult but we don't care. We just want to get off the grid, have some laughs, drink some beer and well you know!. You ever been to East bay? It's just south of Baie Du Nord. After 17 years we are confident we can find fish but it's challenging when going to a new place. I hope the fires are gone soon. Especially for your July trips. Good luck!! have Fun!"

Good luck!! have Fun![/QUOTE]We have never fished the East bay. Most of the camps I’ve been to are in the northwest, but we have been at the same cabin in du male for the last 14 years. We fell in love with that area. I’ve fished up there early June through August and I have had some very good trips in august. The fish may be a little deeper and a little more scattered, but when the bite is on it’s on. I think the local weather pattern the week prior and the week of your trip is more important then what month it is. I agree with you though, great fishing or bad fishing….nothing beats a week in the bush. Enjoy your summer, I’m sure we’ll talk again."
6744289,tweedrules,2023-06-14 03:41:00,107,Anyone have any info from their outfitters about the status of Quebec fishing trips? The roads seem to be closed up North.
6744355,Peterpikes,2023-06-14 08:23:00,33,"Looking at the active fire map it looks like they still have some out of control fires. If memory serves me right you fish on the Gouin with either Cearsars or Tamarac. I reached out to Oliver with Ceasars 3 days ago and they said they are safe and doing ok. The fire was a threat to hit Clova, but fortunately never did. The issue is going to be dirt road access and when they feel confident reopening it to the public. I’m headed up next month so I’m praying for some rain, but it’s good to know for now that clova and outpost cabins are still standing. When is your trip?"
6744379,Matrix04,2023-06-14 10:38:00,13,"According to this map, which was updated today, areas in red are still prohibiting access to the forest.https://sopfeu.qc.ca/en/"
6744413,tweedrules,2023-06-14 13:15:00,107,"Lac Du Male. Air Mont Laurier. 17 years. Leave, HOPEFULLY, Sunday 6/25"
6744419,Peterpikes,2023-06-14 13:22:00,33,Good luck and keep us posted. I’ve been fishing de mule since 2005. I’m headed up in 4 weeks.
6744723,tweedrules,2023-06-16 04:06:00,107,We are confirmed to fly out of Air Mont Laurier (Lac du Male) on Monday 6/27. Norman said there may be some parts of the Gouin that may be off limits to fish.
6745271,Phillypat,2023-06-19 16:20:00,12,"Just got a call from my outfitter. Gouin is closed again effective 12pm June 19th. I am scheduled to fly out Saturday and he said my trip will be cancelled.Pretty pissed as I my first Canadian trip was in 2019 and I wanted to do it every year after. 2020 cancelled, 2021 cancelled, was finally able to go last year, now 2023 cancelled again. I imagine the outfitters are really feeling as they havent had a full year of fishing since 2019 as well."
6745505,Golden Eagle,2023-06-20 19:04:00,2642,hope you can find another camp. Quickly.
6745517,SweetD,2023-06-20 20:00:00,243,PhillyPat I’m sure you could find another trip if you go searching. Who knows maybe you will find something you like even better
6745543,MantuaGuy,2023-06-21 02:15:00,1,Our trip to Lake Evans for next week was canceled on Monday due to travel restrictions. All of the James Bay area of Quebec and the area south are shut down for non-essential travel. Doesn't look like any relief is in sight either. My guess is that it will be like this all summer. https://sopfeu.qc.ca/en/
