6746391,MCB,2023-06-24 19:22:00,12,"Trip report. Had 14 in the group including 2 young sons. In my boat with another fellow, we caught 433 fish in 4.5 days. More smallmouth than anything else, but walleye were everywhere. We caught almost all the walleye 2-12 feet on crank baits, tubes and 3.5 inch swim paddle tails baits. Largest walleye I caught was 28 inches trolling in 12 feet of water around an island. Caught 3 smallmouth bass 18 inches. A 38 and 48 inch musky were caught by others. There was a 52 inch musky caught off the dock by a guide in off time. Smallmouth bass were mainly caught with Mepps spinners 3-5 size, tubes jigs and swim baits ( reaction innovations). Food was prepared by chefs and was excellent at Crow Rock Lodge. Boats are great. MCB"
6744739,Obabikon,2023-06-16 06:38:00,2370,"The crappies never really moved into the dock. We typically avoid their spawn locations, trying to leave the big females alone so they can breed. We hit them pretty hard in August and September."
6744931,MN_Moose,2023-06-17 12:59:00,964,"MCB, sorry for late report. Had no access last week. Check you pm I have a good spot for you. Fishing was fantastic! Water temps 66 up to 68 and then back to 62. Smallmouth were on fire in the shallows. Puking up crawdads. So much I couldn't believe they continued to feed. Basketball size boulders in shallows. We were pitching jigs and crawfish crankbaits. The smoke was really bad Tuesday afternoon. The further north we went the worse it got. Copper island is 1 1/2 miles from Smith camps and there were times we couldn't see it. Jumbo perch were very active mixed in with walleye in 11-15 feet of water. Even caught my personal best 40"" Northern."
6744983,MCB,2023-06-18 04:37:00,12,"MN Moose,Very appreciative of your post and the PM. Will put your advice into action. Thanks,MCB"
6745293,sledman,2023-06-19 20:47:00,13,Any musky reports from opening weekend?
6745295,MCB,2023-06-19 21:01:00,12,"Those in the group (4), have seen but not caught any muskies. They have 2 more days to complete the musky dream. The rest of the 10 of us are catching plenty of smallmouth bass and walleye. The walleye seem everywhere. Tonight caught 14 up to 21 inches on the shoreline from a boat. Wonder where the crappie are? Would guess suspended over deep water. Here is a 28 inch walleye caught trolling the shoreline yesterday in 12-14 feet of water. MCB"
6745325,fishin779,2023-06-20 05:08:00,63,"MN Moose, I called Smiths Camp about having dinner there the other night and they said the dining was closed to the public. I really wanted a friend to speak with Al about the old historic trap lines ,etc. that he knows about. Can you give me any info as to why they are not open to the public. Also, why do you stay up in that area and not closer to Sioux Narrows or Kenora."
6745331,Iceshack05,2023-06-20 06:10:00,31,"We had 5 muskies hit the boat on saturday....biggest being 49.5. Sunday they shut right off for us, no fish landed and only a few followers on sunday."
6745493,sledman,2023-06-20 18:24:00,13,Nice job ICE. Seeing most fish in the weeds? Heading up this weekend. Thanks
6745573,MN_Moose,2023-06-21 05:45:00,964,"I may have been in the lodge when you called. The bar and restaurant is no longer in operation. Multitude of factors. Lack of cook staff, increasing government regulations. If you want to experience all the Al stories, hire him as a guide for the day. We have many great memories from his guide trips. We stayed at Crawfords camp in Sioux Narrows many years ago. Seems like the fishing spots were a long boat ride each day. Too much boat traffic going by each day. We know the North end of LOTW much better. I've stayed at other camps near Kenora, Longbow, Portage Bay. We simply like Smith Camps the best. I hope to get up again later this summer with my wife."
6745579,Iceshack05,2023-06-21 06:01:00,31,"Yes, most fish in the weeds in the 2-6 fow range. Seen a few around boulders and downed tree's as well."
6743933,MCB,2023-06-12 07:23:00,12,"Iceshack05,Thanks for your the report. Looks like the forecast is going to be hot next week again. Any smallmouth reports?MCB"
6744213,Iceshack05,2023-06-13 15:34:00,31,No smallmouth report from me...didn't try. But thinking and hoping musky opener on Sat. is good with the warm stable weather!
6744231,MCB,2023-06-13 17:52:00,12,"Looks like the smoke has moved in. Looking at Tomahawk lodge webcam, it has a smoky haze. Will arrive this Saturday at the lodge. Any other smoke reports?Thanks,MCB"
6744235,NETim1187,2023-06-13 18:22:00,166,I saw a post from Mylie's on FB today. Smoky there because of the west wind. First west wind in 10 days for them.
6744309,Obabikon,2023-06-14 06:11:00,2370,"Smoke was mostly gone this morning. Crazy how it blew in so quickly and heavy yesterday afternoon. It is certainly wind direction. North winds will bring it in... while our standard SW wind would prevent it. I've actually gotten the chance to smallmouth fish a couple times the last few days. We were struggling to find schools of them. Fish a bunch of spots and consistently catch 2-3. So, throughout the day, you catch a bunch, but you're having to keep things moving."
6744311,Obabikon,2023-06-14 06:12:00,2370,Crankbaits and tubes... because that's what the next question is
6744347,MCB,2023-06-14 07:46:00,12,"Obabikon,Appreciate the update on the smoke and the smallmouth report. Imagine the spawn is over with all the warm weather. Water temperatures must be in the low 70â€™s. Thanks,MCB"
6744405,MN Brandon,2023-06-14 12:42:00,14,My camp is in Crow Rock channel. No smoke today. Water temp is around 70. Fishing has been good/very good.
6744459,MCB,2023-06-14 16:04:00,12,MN BrandonAppreciate the report. MCB
6744543,hawks_rule,2023-06-15 05:19:00,115,Any information on the crappies? I would assume they have spawned already with the warm weather.Thanks for the information.
6742977,MCB,2023-06-07 06:45:00,12,Heading up to Crow Rock Lodge June 17. Group of 14. Any thoughts or reports on the fire/smoke situation? Crow Rock Lodge is top notch. Hope to get into the smallmouth bass again. MCB
6743019,MN_Moose,2023-06-07 09:22:00,964,I've not been to Crow Rock Lodge but I fish that neighborhood. We'll be at Smith Camps June 10-16. I'll try to post a report
6743031,MCB,2023-06-07 10:11:00,12,Thanks Moose
6743169,fishin779,2023-06-08 05:11:00,63,"I'll be heading up this Sunday. I'm staying across the lake from the Totem Resort. Hope fishing is good !! It was a couple of weeks ago, even from the boat dock. The people that I have spoken to in the last couple of days have said that both the walleyes and smallies have been fun and abundant !"
6743197,1shooter,2023-06-08 08:17:00,1493,anyone know if the smoke is bad?
6743235,MCB,2023-06-08 10:44:00,12,"Fishin779 and 1Shooter, Talked to the lodge owner this morning. Smoke so far is not an issue. I and my group are connecting in Toronto and Montreal, so in 8 days that may be an issue. Anyone have flight delays due to smoke?Thanks,MCB"
6743243,eyeman_1,2023-06-08 11:45:00,690,Headed to Wiley Point in 3 weeks will keep an eye on this post and the fishing reports.
6743263,Obabikon,2023-06-08 14:49:00,2370,"I can't imagine it being much worse up there... but Lake of the Woods near morson is pretty clear. If there's a SE wind, there will be s slight haze. However, for the most part, it is clear. Certainly not thick enough to smell smoke or anything like that."
6743285,MCB,2023-06-08 16:26:00,12,Thanks Obabikon
6743917,Iceshack05,2023-06-12 06:40:00,31,"I was out on the weekend. Currently smoke is a non factor and hopefully it stays that way. Walleyes are still scattered and can be caught at different depths., but they are definitely on their summer humps already. Not schooled up as thick as they can be though! We did the best in the 18'-24' fow."
