This is my / our first trip to Perrault lake and am looking for any fishing reports. Looking for feedback on Bait, techniques, lures anything you are willing to share in the regard. We will be fishing for all species ie Walleye, Perch, Musky, Northern and Smallies. We are heading up a week from today. Thanks,"

6745849,nitroman,2023-06-22 05:49:00,368,while i can't speak for Perrault I was on Cedar last week and it was on fire! Walleye bite was what we felt one of the best years ever. We fished the reef of Gull Island a lot as well as other rock reefs we know and wow!
6745859,BornToFish,2023-06-22 06:14:00,1224,"Greetings, I haven't been on Perrault Lake in many years, but I have considerable experience on the lake. Walleyes are most definitely an early morning and twilight proposition on Perrault Lake. It's almost always best to find something else to do during mid-morning to early evening. Your best bet for walleyes is to find and fish the humps. The key to fishing humps for walleyes is to go SLOWLY!!! You will be going too fast if your line is not vertical at all times. I would be looking at the Dunes, Shorelunch, Nelly's, Twin Islands, Sand Bar, Sunken Island, Graveyard, First/Second/Third humps off of Little Manotak Island and the humps between Little Duck and Burnt Island. The key to consistently catching walleyes on Perrault Lake is knowing the location of the rock humps and how to fish them. Many anglers on Perrault Lake get frustrated in terms of walleyes for these reasons. The majority of big northern pike will be on the rock humps that you will be fishing for walleyes. Get up wind of the humps by 2-3 casts and drift over the hump and past it by 2-3 casts. Throw any big profile lure that will get down to the vicinity of the thermocline (likely around 15-20 feet down). The pike will be at the thermocline and looking up. They will see the silhouette of the lure and come up to crush it. I use my musky gear and routinely threw bull dawgs. The best bite is often during the middle of the day. You can cast a hump and get nothing, then come back two hours later and get six. Pike less than 25-30 inches know better than to hang around these humps. Have the appropriate hook removal tools and be confident using them if you want to fish this pattern. Little pike will still be around the weeds - behind Twin Islands, Grassy Bay and Sand Bar (beware of the rocks). The top water bite for smallies should be going strong. Any of the common top water lures for bass will suffice. Any of the shorelines with wood in the water and shade will be a good place to start. First Bay, behind Duck Island and around Bird's Beak come to mind - especially after dinner before the walleye bite gets going. Muskies are often frustrating on Perrault - just like almost every lake they are found in. You can burn an entire week and not catch one. I always kept my musky gear in the boat and focused on them when I thought a window was opening. Most of my muskies in this lake were caught in the Musky Corridor - see if you can find someone with a copy of my book to get a photocopy of the map showing the corridor. Some places to check for muskies are Grassy Bay, Hopeless Bay, East Bay, Burnt Island, the weed bed by Camp Island, Tween Island to Little Hatfield Island and Cedar Island. Perch will be in the weeds. Just keep trying different places in the weeds until you land on some. Move after 20 minutes if you don't get bit. They will bite if they are there. Try Rainy Lake, Jackfish Bay, the weeds between Tween Island and Little Hatfield and the weed bed behind Twin Islands. I very much enjoyed my time on Perrault Lake. It's a fabulous fishery in terms of the species and size of fish. Something is always biting on Perrault Lake - it's up to the angler to figure out what, where and how. Perrault Lake is a frustrating fishery in that anglers need to know the location of spots and its also demanding of angler's technique. I know that this lake caused me to become a much better fisherman. Boat control is what separates anglers on Perrault Lake that catch fish from anglers that are just out for a ride. Let me know if you have questions. Please do not mention my name or this post on Walleye Central if you are staying at Manotak. I hope that you have a great trip. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6745861,BornToFish,2023-06-22 06:44:00,1224,"Greetings, I mentioned Tween Island in my previous post. I confused Tween Island and Drum Island - it's been a while. There is some interesting structure around Drum Island (hint)! There is a weed bed (lots of sand grass) between Drum Island and Little Hatfield Island that holds perch and predators. There is a nice drop off on the lake side of this weed bed. The drop off holds nice walleyes much of the season. Thus, when the boats were stacked off of Sand Bar in the evening, I would sometimes go over to Drum Island and fish the drop off - it fishes the same as Sand Bar. Start deep in the early evening and move shallower as the light fades to stay with the fish. Tween Island is a well known spring spot for walleyes. I often fished the slot between Tween Island and Hatfield Island for walleyes during the first week of the season. It can hold northern pike throughout the season, especially when the wind blows into it. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6746077,Springstead,2023-06-23 09:20:00,12,"Nitroman, thanks for your report on Cedar Lake. I hope we encounter good action like you did last week, It's possible that we may venture into Cedar during our trip. It looks like we will be experiencing cooler weather, overcast sky's and some rain. Honestly the mid 70's temperatures sound great to me! BorntoFish, wow thanks for the time you put in on the post! I will print this out today and take along on our trip. While we are Newbies on Perrault lake I have another friend that has been fishing Perrault for the last 5-10 years, which is why we are going here this time. He was kind enough to mark up a map and I was able to input the locations in my Humminbird already! Between your info and that from my friend I believe we will have a great trip. Paul PS - No worries as we are NOT staying at Manotak, however this looks like a great outfitter too!!!"
