6746393,MCB,2023-06-24 19:27:00,12,"Trip report for June 17-21. Had 14 in the group including 2 young sons. In my boat with another fellow, we caught 433 fish in 4.5 days. More smallmouth than anything else, but walleye were everywhere. We caught almost all the walleye 2-12 feet on crank baits, tubes and 3.5 inch swim paddle tails baits. Largest walleye I caught was 28 inches trolling in 12 feet of water around an island. Caught 3 smallmouth bass 18 inches. A 38 and 48 inch musky were caught by others. There was a 52 inch musky caught off the dock by a guide in off time. Smallmouth bass were mainly caught with Mepps spinners 3-5 size, tubes jigs and swim baits ( reaction innovations). Food was prepared by chefs and was excellent at Crow Rock Lodge. Boats are great. MCB"
