6746845,NM_Trout,2023-06-26 18:38:00,1094,"In camp June 18-25 myself and a friend who was a complete noob to fishing outposts.Flew into MSP June 16, drove to Fort Frances. Border crossing at 10pm was fast. Nobody ahead of us. Stayed at Bayview motel Friday night. Had breakfast at TH in FF, border crossing line to get into the US was backed up to TH on Saturday morning around 9am. Bought groceries on Friday in Iron Mountain Walmart. Got perishables in FF, and regret it. Portions at the grocery were very large. Could not find small bags of frozen veggies, cheese, etc. (Met some nice folks in the parking lot headed to Sunset Country Adventures. Might need to try that camp).Drove to Red Lake, stayed the night at the Super 8. Bought some last minute supplies. Up at 5am to be at Bill's dock at 6. Overcast skies, but we loaded up and were on our way. Before we got to camp, clouds closed in on us pretty heavily. I'm not going to claim IFR conditions, as that likely would have been somewhat illegal. Let's just say that the pilot's eyesight must be much, much better than mine. However, a clear spot was found above the lake, a little bit of left aileron and some right rudder and we dropped through that hole like greased lightning. Camp was great as always. Mattresses and pillows still need upgrading, but the previous guys left a clean camp. Boats and motors were in good shape, cabin was mostly bug free. This was my 5th trip to this camp. We set up beds and bug nets, put away food, rigged rods and were on the lake by noon. This is a walleye factory lake and fishing the deeper edges that the wind was blowing onto yielded good success. Imagine that :-)This was a 7 day trip. Weather was mostly good. Some smoke in the air from the fires when the wind was out of the north. We got chased in by an electrical storm one day, and got rained on while fishing for a few hours, but all in all very good weather. Best lure of the trip (far and away) was Zman scented jerk shadz in electric chicken color. 5"" with 1/4oz did better than 4""with 1/8oz jig head (pink or chartreuse head color). These things are the bomb. My buddy hooked a very nice pike, probably high 30's, on a F11 in perch color. Rest of the pike were up to about 24"" with lots in the 20"" range. Gobs and gobs of 14 to 18"" walleye, biggest was only 23.5"". Total fish for the 7 days was 848, and we sort of gave up on the last day to clean and just hang out in camp. A couple of disappointments... They advertise, and usually have a boat and motor on what is called west lake for portage. We hiked over to only find a fire damaged boat. No boat has been placed on that lake this year. It would have been good to remove that from the information letter, or at least let us know. The bbq grill on the deck has intermittent failure. It worked Wednesday, but not Friday, then worked again Sunday morning when host came to pick us up. That grill is very, very old. The outboard motor on U-Lake is well past its prime and can be finicky to keep running. Oh... will probably skip the Chocolate Moose in International Falls on subsequent trips. The service was terribly slow, even at 3pm yesterday. These are pretty nitpicky items. The camp was great, fishing was a lot of fun, and we experienced a new fishing technique too. Late in the evening, the mayflies were settling on the lake, and walleye were eating them on the surface. I had a fly rod, but no dries. But we would watch for a gulp, then fire a jig out to the rise and rip it back to the boat. 100% hit rate on that, which was a hoot. All in all a great trip."

6746857,NM_Trout,2023-06-26 19:03:00,1094,Likely so. But I think I want to take grandkids on the next one :-)
6746859,7 Mag,2023-06-26 19:05:00,1887,"Great report, sounds like a fun trip."
6746869,Eckohlt,2023-06-26 19:29:00,3685,"You ever tried unnamed lake,sounds like there's some big fish in it??"
6746881,kona77,2023-06-26 20:01:00,236,"You ever tried unnamed lake,sounds like thereâ€™s some big fish in it??Eck- Our group fished Unnamed twice with Loon Haunt. Caught my first 40"" Northern on Unnamed and we had some of our best big gator fishing ever on our first trip. Walleye fishing was OK and Bill/Louise Coppen always treated our group well.Thanks for the trip report NM. Monroe always looked like a good action lake to fish."
6746939,Bill Krejca,2023-06-27 06:19:00,6107,Nice report! Bill
6747085,Chevelle38,2023-06-27 16:50:00,5,Sounds like a great trip! Loon Haunt has been on my short list of places to go. Have you ever stayed at the main lodge/fished Goose Lake?
6747117,NM_Trout,2023-06-27 18:59:00,1094,No... unfortunately I can't find a group of 3 others to go with me. They hold Unnamed for parties of 4 or more early in the season. That camp is on a river system and I have heard that it is awesome for pike.
6747119,NM_Trout,2023-06-27 19:01:00,1094,"Yes... I stayed there 2010 or so. Goose camp is top notch. It is nice having indoor toilet, and the boats and fish house are clean and well maintained. They now have wifi in the camp too if that is something you like. I have also stayed at Whitelaw, but I don't think I would return to that camp. We struggled to find fish on the lake other than at the inlet. Perhaps it was also due to the weather being bad on us for all 7 days."
