A few close encounters at night with moose over the years had us change our travel plans to overnight stay in IF and then up Highway 71. Yes - it is a slightly longer drive - like 30 miles for our trip up to Ear Falls. Your decision of course - just be careful on 502 if this is what you decide to take. Safe travels."
6746063,N_of_Quibell,2023-06-23 08:35:00,151,"I was thinking exactly the same thing! Might encounter a few deer on 71, but less likely to wack a moose. Now that I'm usually towing a trailer, 71 has become my route of choice given better shoulder/pull-off conditions."
6746071,Habitual Eyer,2023-06-23 08:54:00,144,"Thanks BTY......Seems over last 30 yrs we've driven it in dark, early morn, late at night, pouring rain, fog,etc. It is a road one has to be just a touch cautious with. If not early enough we may hold up at FF. If enough daylight we may continue on. Appreciate the words of concern though."
6746083,7 Mag,2023-06-23 10:04:00,1887,"Have a great trip, are you spending anytime on Gullrock?"
6746117,Habitual Eyer,2023-06-23 11:47:00,144,Absolutely. Gullrock kinda special to me having fished it for decades and have some good friends on it. Staying up on Red for campsite availability and i have enjoyed expanding out to exploring Red lately. Both lakes are amazing in my opinion. Love fishing from West end of Red all the way to far reaches of Gullrock.
6746125,Old Timer,2023-06-23 12:40:00,255,There's a nice campground in FF. It's right on Rainy Lake and just west of the Rendevous. I drove through it last week and saw tent campers and some RVs. I suspect it's run by the city. Call the chamber of commerce and they'll fill you in. There was no gate keeper that I saw.
6745905,Habitual Eyer,2023-06-22 11:28:00,144,Crossing the border Friday evening (Aug 4th) with truck camper pulling walleye boat. Trying to find a place to pull over and sleep in camper for that Friday night in Fort Frances. Then head up to Red Lake in the morning. Anyone have any ideas or done similar or have any ideas on good place to pull over where we won't get hassled?? Thanks !!
6745913,UpNorthGuy,2023-06-22 11:58:00,53,I think you're allowed to park in the Walmart parking lot overnight. Ft. Frances has a Walmart so does Dryden.
6745929,N_of_Quibell,2023-06-22 12:46:00,151,"In the past, the Walmart in FF has given me permission to stay in my little trailer in their parking lot. I think they wanted me to park nearest the road - if interested, give customer service a call. If you aren't heading up 71, the Walmart might not be on your way, though."
6745935,7 Mag,2023-06-22 12:57:00,1887,Call the Safeway and see if they will let you park overnight.
6745943,Mojo-NC,2023-06-22 13:22:00,1929,There's a nice little rest stop right after you turn north on 502 called Great River Road Picnic Area. I'm not sure if they'll allow overnight parking though.
6745975,Baseline,2023-06-22 16:05:00,3207,Timberwolf Lodge on 502 has campsites. It is about 40 miles north of Fort Francis. Boreal Lodge in Nestor Falls has campsites. About 50 miles north of Fort Francis
6745981,Wallychowder,2023-06-22 16:38:00,1567,I believe the OP Mentioned he wanted to find a place in Fort Francis !....Lol.
6746003,btyreprich,2023-06-22 20:04:00,1067,I'd say Walmart is your best option. I see people parking their RVs in just about every Walmart I drive by. Well lighted parking lot and breakfast is available: donuts / OJ / Fruit / etc. Travel safe.
6746007,N_of_Quibell,2023-06-22 21:04:00,151,"Yep, I agree. But it is my understanding that this is not dictated by general company policy, but rather is left to the discretion of the local store manager - so the best plan is to probably call ahead."
6746025,Habitual Eyer,2023-06-23 06:15:00,144,"All very helpful info. Only goal is to make it across Border Friday night. Depending on time we may overnight in FF, may try to make Dryden if we cross early enough in the evening. Think we will probably take 502 but 71 might happen as well. Many great options to consider mentioned here so thanks everyone !!!"
