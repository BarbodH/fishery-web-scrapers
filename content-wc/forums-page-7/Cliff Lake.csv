6746515,Yellowfin123,2023-06-25 11:28:00,2182,this reminds me of the old theory of always keep the hooked fish in the water next to the boat and while its darting around it will keep all the followers interested in the biting mood and throw lures to all the followersweather and water sure look nice

In clear water, many times it can be seen very slowly sinking, as the fish is being brought up to the boat. I don't know if this throwing up is as common as it is with bass, perhaps due to bass maybe being fought higher up in the water, so what happens with walleye, etc. is not seen, due to water depth and water clarity. The followers maybe just be looking for an easy meal. I do believe there may be other reasons why a caught fish is being followed, other than the stated, and the big pike chase scenario, I just don't know why. Besides bass being followers, sometimes several at a time, walleye also can do likewise, so.... Bill"
