6393016,cpk,2020-02-04 17:26:00,27,"I'm looking for resort or outpost suggestions that are somewhat near Indian Island/Kleiner Point on Lac Seul. The Williams Lake outfit we gave gone with for the past half-dozen years has now decided they are not going to allow personal boats on their lake as a way to keep invasive species out of their waters. The ridiculousness of this new policy aside, we are looking for a place that is an easy travel distance to and from that area. We know the area well and are very familiar with it so it would be ideal to find a place near there.We are used to a 20 minute boat ride to reach this area, so if anyone has suggestions within that range, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks so much in advance."

6393052,JDP,2020-02-04 19:57:00,1457,Link to Lac Seul Lodge's website:https://www.lacseullodge.com/outpost...k-bay-outpost/ If you perform a search on this forum you will find people that have stayed at this outpost. I would advise against LSL's Sunlight Outpost if you want to fish the Kleiner Point area. Quite a distance to run.

6393144,pjshorthorn,2020-02-05 06:14:00,5654,"Take a look at Williams Lake Lodge. It puts you right on the doorstep ( so to speak ) of Indian Island and Kleiner Point. The lodge has a drive in or boat in option and they have an Outpost on the lake away from the main lodge as well. You would have to navigate Williams Creek each day to get out into Lac Seul where you want to fish, but they indicate that it takes about 20 minutes by boat to get to Williams Bay which has Indian Island and Kleiner at the northern end of the bay. From the map, if it were blowing a gale one day it appears that one could fish Williams Lake and have plenty of protected fishing as well. Looks like a fairly easy drive from Dryden....about 40 miles.I have not personally been to this lodge, but it has peaked my interest in the past. I just never have pulled the trigger as I always have gone to the NE section on Lac Seul. It looks to be a very affordable lodge as well.Hope this helps a bit. Have fun planning and best of luck on finding a great place for your group.https://williamslakelodge.net/plans.htmlPjShorthorn"
6393184,cpk,2020-02-05 08:17:00,27,"Yeah, that's the outfit we've been going to that no longer allows personal boats on the lake. They've had some weird rules lately that make them less attractive: no personal boats, they have their own slot limits for fish that are different than the MNR, no camp fires, no charging of trolling motor batteries at their outpost. They don't have the authority to enact and enforce rules on slot limits or boating on the lake, but they're doing it. And their cabin rentals are only 6 days instead of the usual 7. Just not impressed with them lately."
6393192,Carnhzkr,2020-02-05 08:28:00,964,"That's a good idea, OR they could try Williams Lake. JK - might want to reread the OP."
6746085,Steve Comerford,2023-06-23 10:05:00,28,"Yes, it does seem ridiculous to ban personal boats......if everyone else on the lake allows personal boats then what's the point right? But if you think about it, the Williams Lake Lodge has to rely on good fishing right there in Williams Lake. They can't say that the only good fishing is in Lac Seul after a long ride down the creek. So if a personal boat spreads zebra mussels all over Williams Lake, I can see where people might stop going there."
