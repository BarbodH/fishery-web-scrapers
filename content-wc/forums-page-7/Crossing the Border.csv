6746893,Lmbkiller,2023-06-26 21:05:00,639,"No one will ever be able to fix dumb, and often, Canada is dumb"
6746923,Eckohlt,2023-06-27 05:17:00,3685,"I love going to that dumb place as often as in can,it teaches me a lot about life!"
6746925,That Minnesota guy,2023-06-27 05:28:00,8293,Dumb is being to lazy to properly secure your trailer. But I'm guessing there are no dumb people in the USA right?
6746971,N_of_Quibell,2023-06-27 08:16:00,151,"One time, I forget to latch down my trailer hitch, and sure enough, it popped off the first bump I hit. However, because I had my chains properly crossed and attached, all I needed to do was re-hitch, change my shorts, and hit the road. Yep, pretty dumb. But thanks to being properly chained, no harm done."
6746549,brian1785,2023-06-25 13:40:00,1534,"Got a text from a buddy who came back from Canada and he said there's a new law in effect stating ""Trailer safety chains now require clips, not just S hooks by Canadian law."" Has anyone heard anything about such law? I've been scouring the Border Crossing Page and can't find anything of the sorts, but I'm a chronic worrier, so...Anyway, we are supposed to be crossing in about 6 days so I could use some help. Thanks all!"
6746551,Wallychowder,2023-06-25 13:46:00,1567,They've always been a good idea anyway !
6746553,brian1785,2023-06-25 13:48:00,1534,Don't disagree. Just need to know if it's the LAW. Thanks.
6746557,That Minnesota guy,2023-06-25 14:27:00,8293,Been the law as long as I can remember.
6746563,Wallychowder,2023-06-25 14:41:00,1567,That's weird ! The 35 years I've been crossing I've never had my chains inspected ! Although i do have them.
6746565,Yellowfin123,2023-06-25 14:54:00,2182,"i guess this is good to know, nobody's ever looked at my trailer crossing the border but its best to be prepared ..... last month i rented a u-haul trailer to go pick up a lawn tractor and the guy hooking up the trailer told me its the law that the safety chains need to be criss/crossed, never heard of that one before.."
6746567,Richard B,2023-06-25 14:55:00,735,I use these on my s hooks on the trailer. https://www.etrailer.com/Accessories...tent=Tow%20Bar
6746571,Wallychowder,2023-06-25 15:02:00,1567,Don't feel bad ! You'd be surprised about folks pulling trailers that don't know about the criss cross !
6746577,stjoeguy,2023-06-25 16:18:00,979,"This is from The Official Ministry of Transportaion (MTO) Driver's Handbook:https://www.ontario.ca/document/offi...andbook/towing Attaching your trailer Your trailer must have two separate ways of attaching to your vehicle so that if one fails or comes loose, the trailer will stay attached. If safety chains are used, they must be crossed under the tongue to prevent the tongue from dropping to the road if the primary hitch accidentally disconnects. The chain hooks must have latches or devices that will not accidentally become detached."
6746605,brian1785,2023-06-25 19:31:00,1534,THIS is what I needed to see. Thanks so much!!
