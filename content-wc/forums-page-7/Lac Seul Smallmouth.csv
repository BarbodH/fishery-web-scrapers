6746885,Lmbkiller,2023-06-26 20:27:00,639,Pretty simple ..make Mille lacs a trophy smb fishery there's gonna consequences And chowder ..I don't get hung up on grammar etc
6746887,Lmbkiller,2023-06-26 20:46:00,639,"N of Q I would say for empirical evidence possibly u fished Mille lacs in the 90s, now go fish there. It's much than a case of smb up walleye down"
6746903,Wallychowder,2023-06-27 03:20:00,1567,I thought this was about Lac Seul ? Your hung up on mille lacs !
6746911,prov1800,2023-06-27 04:25:00,5010,Think the stream/creek you mentioned comes from Little V.Have fished that creek often in the spring time and is full of walleyes also.
6746915,pjshorthorn,2023-06-27 04:58:00,5654,"91 ? You are a rookie still. I have 10+ years on you when it comes to Lac Seul. SMB have existed in Lac Seul , and many other lake systems in Canada, well before you ever knew what or where Lac Seul existed in Canada. The fact that few were caught on Lac Seul wasn't because they didn't exist in the system,it was because SMB weren't targeted heavily back in the 60's, 70s,80s and 90s. I would venture to say fishermen didn't target bass in general until the bass fishing TV shows became popular. Now, bass are all some folks want to target vs walleye. Bass for the fight, walleye for the table. If you want to prove your point .get the MNR creel studies for the last 6 decades. When it comes to the overall health of a fishery, SMB , LMB, Walleye, Perch are very good for the aquatic plants in the lake. If you want to worry about an invasive issue, it is not SMB. It is the rusty crayfish. The rusty destroys the plant life in lakes and thus the possibility for bait reproduction in the lake. SMB along with walleye,LMB and perch all help keep the crayfish population in check. We can go down all kinds of other rabbitt holes regarding whether other fish species Should coexist with the your holy walleye. How about crappie? How about musky and northern .they eat walleye. Don't forget perch .they feed on the holy walleye. Take your pick. If you aren't a marine biologist, I would say you need to go back to being the ball boy for tee ball games. PjShorthorn"
6746937,prov1800,2023-06-27 06:11:00,5010,Your right about the rusties PJ Eagle Lake is loaded with them from west end to the east end.If you leave jig close to bottom to long you will catch them.Have not caught any personally north of Eagle.They are deadly on weed beds that grow in sand.But yes they do provide bait for all species in the lake.I have seen some destruction from them muskie fishing where they have wiped out weed beds.They can get fairly big and are very tasty
6746955,Pooch,2023-06-27 07:22:00,4618,We used to stop and fish Little V on our way to LS. I wonder why if the SMB make it to LS then why don't Walleye make it to Big V and Little V? Just a thought. Little V is a very pretty lake to be on. Might be one of the prettiest I've been on. Pooch
6746961,N_of_Quibell,2023-06-27 07:52:00,151,"I think you nailed it. Aquatic ecosystems are pretty darn complex, and most have been pretty screwed up by things like exotic mussels, crayfish, spiny water fleas, warming, weeds. Putting the blame on a species that has co-existed in these water bodies for a very long time is probably naive."
6747081,v-bay gord,2023-06-27 16:18:00,3168,SMB are always the culprit when walleye stocks decline because of overfishing.
6747115,Jabs,2023-06-27 18:31:00,24,Been fishing Lac Seul since the early 80’s. Caught many Smallies back then. More now of course. Some people are just looking to stir the pot!
6746031,kayakmatt,2023-06-23 06:53:00,105,"Wife and I Going to Lost Island Lodge, Lac Seul next week. Fist time on the lake. My wife loves to catch smallies, likes to ""beat the banks"", as we have done over the years in early June at LOTW. The early July bass pattern is going to be more offshore. Do you find bass stacked up with the walleyes on the offshore humps in summer? Do they stage in current areas? What's your thoughts on catching bass in Summer on LS?Thanks."
6746035,Megatron,2023-06-23 07:01:00,13,"You’ll have all the action you’d ever want within sight of the lodge, in any direction. Excellent bass fishing in that entire area. They’ll help out you on fish, but it isn’t hard regardless. Have fun!"
6746043,Pooch,2023-06-23 07:16:00,4618,We catch quite a few bottom bouncing for walleye and we also catch them pitching about anything to rocky areas. There are some dandy's on LS.They are a blast to catch.Pooch
6746201,Lmbkiller,2023-06-23 23:38:00,639,Keep them all as they shouldn't be there anyways. They are vermin in walleye book. They basically didn't exist on lac seul prior to the 2000s. Fire away dumb guys
6746227,Pooch,2023-06-24 07:33:00,4618,"Not hijacking this thread, but has the introduction of SM to LS actually effected the walleye fishing? There was a discussion years ago about this then I've never read anymore about it since.The past couple years I've not caught the ""accidental"" SM as often as I used to. Especially in the western end. When we target them, we can catch them.Pooch"
6746235,x4flatfish,2023-06-24 08:15:00,319,I would disagree with this. Been going to Lac Seul since the 60's and have always caught small mouth there. In fact there is a stream from Big Vermilion into Pelican lake just above the rapids for small mouth and muskie to enter the system. So very natural for these fish to be in the east end of the system.
6746781,Lmbkiller,2023-06-26 14:27:00,639,"No ..smb range is slowly creeping north and they are proliferating. Been goin to lac seul since 91', didn't start catching smb frequently til about 2008, now I don't even have to target them to catch them. They are throughout the entire system in decent/good numbers. If u like your lac seul walleyes the bass can go away. Doesn't take a genius to know that. Perfect example is Mille lacs"
6746801,Yellowfin123,2023-06-26 16:14:00,2182,"down at the bottom of lac seul by pelican rapids makes sense in the early days, how long it has takin for the smallmouth to venture north, like say the chamberlin narrows area would be a question for the NE lac seul veterans...I've seen pooch talk about the mahkwa area, I just call that mid lake, last time i was there i couldn't buy a smallmouth, jig n minnow, beating rocky islands to death, shallow, deep, nothin.... it was hot and maybe i was just being an idiot, everything that looked like like smallmouth country, I just tore up the pike"
6746813,Wallychowder,2023-06-26 16:43:00,1567,Dumb guys ? By the way its Anyway NOT Anyways !!!
6746843,N_of_Quibell,2023-06-26 18:36:00,151,"Perfect example of what?? According to the MN-DNR, SMB are native to Mille Lacs. I suscept you have discovered what scientists refer to as spurious correlation: SMB up, walleyes down, but SMB abundance not causal of walleye decline. I'd happily accept any empirical evidence to the contrary."
