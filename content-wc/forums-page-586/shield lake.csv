This is some of the oldest known rock on earth. It also extends into Northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. Shield lakes are known for their rugged rocky out crops made of the same material they lay upon. For the most part these lakes are oligotrophic lakes (cool clear-stained, low nutrient with decent dissolved oxygen at depth) that we scraped out when the glaciers advanced and retreated. The end result was some of the best fresh water fishing on the planet. good luck GF"
