It is good for rigging later in the fall on shallower points, from Late September & October. If you prefer this kind of fishing, I would go then, but it can be pretty chilly. In the fall, Rowans, Wee Too, Swansons, Foxes, and Glenn Harbour points are all good. Each year, there are fish up to 14 pounds caught, but only a handful over 14. There are lots of 8 to 12 pounders and they fisht really hard. Best of luck, Chris K"

However you probably want to be in a boat, so I would hit it around mid June. The fish have been done spawing for a while and are just getting into their summer routines and locations. They are on a good bite too as they are still replenishing from the spawn. Also the mayfly hatch prob hasn't occured yet. I always like to fish prior to the hatch as during and just after can be a really tough bite."
