It's called Operation Muskie and gets 20 vets fishing at no cost with 10 world class muskie guides. This is the second year after a very successful first year in 2008. http://www.operationmuskie.org/The lots on the auction are mainly geared to muskie fisherman, but there are other great packages as well.To find out more, follow the link to the online auction. The silent auction is ending soon, but there are many great packages available for the live auction this coming Wednesday at 7pm CST. http://muskie.outdoorsfirst.com/boar...osts=4&start=1The first thread will give you some background and links to even more information. I haven't seen this mentioned on walleye central anywhere and didn't want anyone to miss out on a chance at some great packages. There is a couple of trips to Canada that are part of the live auction so check it out."
