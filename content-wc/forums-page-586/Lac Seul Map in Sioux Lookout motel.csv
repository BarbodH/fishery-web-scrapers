1087239,Pooch,2009-03-11 16:54:00,4619,Last fall I fished Lac Seul with some friends. We stayed in Sioux Lookout at the Lamplighter motel one night. Walking down a hallway in the hotel there was a really nice map of that area of Lac Seul mounted on the wall. Does anyone who knows of this map know where a person could purchase a copy? Pooch
