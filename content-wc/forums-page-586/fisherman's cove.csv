1085689,Bill Krejca,2009-03-05 17:38:00,6107,"I don't know for this particular resort, but sometimes it just means that the business hasn't yet paid the yearly fee to renew the site agreement. Unless someone knows that the resort has gone out of business, you might just periodically keep trying to open the site. Bill Krejca"
1085691,2746,2009-03-05 17:46:00,3206,"Bill, your probably right. I'll keep checking."
1085717,prov1900,2009-03-05 19:47:00,544,Isn't this the same resort we are discussing in the Golden Fawn thread below?
1085729,JDP,2009-03-05 20:37:00,1457,You can contact Fisherman's Cove @ 1-800-789-926 for reservations. This resort (Fisherman's Cove) is a different resort from the resort (Golden Fawn that was thought to have been sold and renamed Legends Lodge) in the other thread. I will bet there is something like what the Bill K. said with payment or a revision issue with the website. The ownership (the Denzler family) is very solid and has been in place since the early 80's.. JDP

1085766,teddi,2009-03-06 05:46:00,349,the family has been busy the past while. betty has been very sick and died last week. her funeral was last monday.
1085901,2746,2009-03-06 16:59:00,3206,I don't know these folks but I take it from this last post that Betty may be the wife in the partnership. I'm extremly sorry to hear of their loss.
