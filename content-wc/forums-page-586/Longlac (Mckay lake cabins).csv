1086865,Guest,2009-03-10 14:08:00,0,"if i remember right it was 30-40 minutes to mckay lake.did not fish any of the lakes on the way.had a good day for walleyes on little mckay.did not attempt to get to siegram but i think it would be worth the effort.we did not buy any minnows-we do very well with white tails or walleye belly.good bait shop in longlac but cant remember name of it.later,tim"
1087289,lenray,2009-03-11 19:55:00,467,Tim what is the name of the lake the cabins are on????? I have fished McKay and didn't realize there was a river you could take that would take a person to cabins. We were there in Later Sept. and the water was very low and we were not able to get up those rivers. Also we had a bigger boat 18 ft. with a 70hp. For that time of the year it was to big and heavy to get into a lot of the water. That boat is now gone. Thanks for any info.
