With the price of gold, er I meant minnows, going up each year, I wondered what kind of success anyone has had using this product. I sent for a catalog from the company and I can get 100 for $10.49 and shipping. Sure cheaper than minnows or gulp. Anyone had any experience with these preserved baits? Colors? Thanks."

I see the large package is about $9.00 at the local fleet farm. I have only used the natural, uncolored ones and have had good luck. Like plastic they need to be worked on a jig and don't do much unless you are putting some action to them, and they won't stand up to many hits but put plenty of fish in the boat. Its hard to beat a live minnow but they will do in a pinch. I have used the larger shad for pike with a quick set rig under a slip bobber, and also for lake trout. good luck GF"
