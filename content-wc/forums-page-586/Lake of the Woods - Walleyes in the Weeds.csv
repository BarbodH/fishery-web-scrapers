1087136,rpieske,2009-03-11 11:01:00,1276,Yep..I usually leave about that time. Might have to stay up longer one year just to hit those big fall fish. Good luck to you this year.
1087669,BWLCwalleyeguy,2009-03-13 09:22:00,26,"So when fishing these shallow weeds when it gets rainy, what is your weapon of choice? I just read the latest In-Fisherman article where Doug Stange talks about using large swimbaits in these weeds. I've tried fishing these types of weeds before for walleye, but get very frustrated with all the hangups and taking weeds off my jig everytime. I often lose patience quickly and move back to fishing points, humps, or trolling cranks. I am very interested in this type of weed fishing, I just need more insight as to what you guys do to make it effective. Is cabbage or coontail weeds the best weed for this situation or will any weedy bay work? Do you fish the edge of the weeds or get right up into the thick stuff? Thanks for the help and understanding, this is why walleye fishing is the best, there are so many variables and ways to catch fish. I've really fallen in love with slip bobbering the past few years, Greg Bohns book on the subject is excellent! Thanks guys, Blake"
1087720,BWLCwalleyeguy,2009-03-13 12:51:00,26,"Wow, very insightful, thank you very much for the tip. I dont get to LOW often, but next time I'm there I'll give you some business and learn more. Clipping the hooks is a good idea, it would help keep the weeds off and make it more stealthy. I wonder why the Kalin grubs have more buoyancy? The 16th oz jig will add less weight and keep it up in the column. Great advice, I really appreciate the education, I'm already trying to picture familiar spots in my mind to try this. Thanks Again!"
1085721,scotttheguide,2009-03-05 20:01:00,73,"If you are fishing LOTW this Summer and it starts raining, head for the weed beds or small bays with the wind blowing in that have cabbage. Big Walleyes in shallow water, it's a blast. When you find them you will forget all about the rain.For more information go to WC Classifieds, Guides and Lodges - from drop down list choose Canada, Ontario Resorts (Smitty's CFA).If you haven't fished Lake of the Woods recently then you haven't fished it."
1085836,Bill Krejca,2009-03-06 10:57:00,6107,"Scott, That's a good tip. I've had my best luck using an overhead spinner, semi-weedless jig head and a twister type tail in the weeds. A bright spinner and chartreuse/flouro orange tail, something that shows up well for the short time they see it between the weed stalks works best for me. Bill Krejca"
1085905,Bigfishhunter,2009-03-06 17:17:00,803,"Many Canadian Lakes - you will find walleyes in the weeds. This is my favorite bite to fish. It is especially true in shield lakes. I also do well in hot weather as well, they go there to get out of the direct sunlight and find shade in the heavy cabbage."
1085959,Lundexp,2009-03-06 20:38:00,901,"I've experienced the same on the lake of the woods. Whenever it rained, even temporarily, the guide led us to the shallow bays and we always caught alot more of them."
1086001,Golden Eagle,2009-03-07 06:19:00,2642,"Fish are already wet, so it's not the rain water that turns them on. Maybe the bite comes due to rain hitting the lake surface and breaking up light rays. Wave action from wind that comes with the rain will stir up bait fish in the shallows."
1086010,Obabikon,2009-03-07 07:25:00,2370,barometric pressure change is what causes them to move.
1086014,Larry Mac,2009-03-07 07:38:00,530,"Hi scotttheguide, We have had great success fishing Canadian Weed Walleyes Rain or Shine. It is one of my favorite bites. Your posts have been most enjoyable. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1086469,esgrams,2009-03-09 10:02:00,92,"Scott: Here's a question for ya-- What in your opinion is considered a hump that walleye's will relate too-- Is it 3"" a foot or does it have more to do with the depth and bottom structure.."
1086573,rpieske,2009-03-09 15:42:00,1276,Hey Bill: I have found the same setup works great for me too. The only difference is I use a white twister tail virtually all the time. I'll have to try your bright colored tails this spring. If you are ever around Nestor Falls let me know. I'd love to meet you. Have a great season.
1086578,Bill Krejca,2009-03-09 15:54:00,6107,"Bob, The spinner rig does the trick. I actually modify a shad dart jig mold to place the hook eye at the exact front of the head. This greatly help the weedless aspect, and the flat surface of the jig head makes it wiggle a bit more, which is good. Any color of head is OK as long as it is Floro Orange. I'll be there Sep 19, but I think you are gone by then. I'll be staying over at Young's, fishing for crappies. Bill Krejca"
