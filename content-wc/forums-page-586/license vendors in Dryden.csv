1086866,Pooch,2009-03-10 14:10:00,4619,"Probably many of the Gas Stations / bait shops along Rt. 17. If coming into town from Fort Francis as you pass the mill then cross the river there is a stop light. There is a gas station on the corner that used to sell bait and they also sold licenses a few years ago. Search Dryden, ON and there should be several places listed. Pooch"
