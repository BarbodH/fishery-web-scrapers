1087515,alanexpup,2009-03-12 17:51:00,278,Hi. we were talking about how barometric pressure affects fishing. I would think that as far as weather pressure is concerned that the pressure change from the atmosphere even the most change is only a matter of a couple tenths of an inch of water pressure. Now if a fish is at the surface of the water and decends only about 4 to 6 inches deaper into the water the fish has removed the total pressure that the atmosphere could change the effective pressure on the fish. normally the fish is going to move and down the water level maybe 20 or 30 feat and will never ever notice any change in pressure due to the weather. Is my thinking all wrong? thanks a lot. alan

IMHO I believe the relationship to the drop in barometric pressure and good fishing is the barometric pressure is only the indicator for what is about to take place. A low pressure system usually indicates the coming of a storm or such. With this comes the clouds (great for walleye), The wind (great for walleye) the light rain to disperse light (great for walleye) with the rain an influx of shore runoff water which can carry food into the system (great for walleye). I believe these things that can accompany low barometric pressure may be the reason for the great fishing. Have a great season.Thank you,Larry Mac"

However, I can say with certainty that there's a corolation with fish activity and the barometer. We have one in our office, and many days I can tell the guests when they caught fish before they even get back to let me know."
1087749,Pooch,2009-03-13 15:14:00,4619,"Do you suppose that since a fish's lateral line is so sensitive that it can actually feel the ever so slight (to us humans) change in pressure? If a fish can pick out a wounded minnow in a cloud of minnows, why couldn't they also sense a change in the barometric pressure also? I think that people react to an approaching storm also. Maybe we also have more visual clues to what is coming, but we do ""feel"" differently at the approach of a storm. I think I can actually feel myself ""speed up"" when there is a change in the weather coming. Don't ask me to describe it, but it is real to me. I think we are hardwired to react to indicators of foul weather, but have buried those senses under a big bunch of generations by our ancestors that no longer needed them. As humans, our senses are extraordinarily dulled relative to the animal world. A this point in time humans are the most domesticated of the domesticated. Weird answer to a good question......... Pooch"
1087783,Bigfishhunter,2009-03-13 17:56:00,803,"Obabikon, would you be willing to divulge the barometric pressure #'s (or whatever your indicators are) that you are referring to when you are able to tell good from bad. this is something that I would like to learn more about as well. I started a log last year but I don't have enough info to put together any patterns as of yet."
1087882,Obabikon,2009-03-14 07:37:00,2370,"The key seems to be dropping pressure. (or a downward trend) there doesn't seem to be specific numbers. But, if it was at 28.9 at 9AM and then at 11Am it is 28.2... then that often turns into a feeding time for the fish. Most of the time we'll be ranging from 28-30 in Hg. When the weather goes from sunny and bright to cloudy and ""threatening"" to rain... that pressure drops. It can usually turn into a feeding frenzy."
1087896,Glenman12,2009-03-14 08:33:00,762,"A few years ago me and my fishing partner got ahold of that device called the Anglers Edge..basically its an electronic hand held barometer that also takes into account moon phases..As far as predicting fish feeding activity, the thing is uncanny"
1087905,Golden Eagle,2009-03-14 08:54:00,2642,"Atmospheric Pressure - pressure exerted by the weight of the atmosphere. It varies with altitude.Barometric Pressure - measurement of atmospheric pressure. One atmosphere of pressure = 14.7 pounds per square inch.Hydrostatic Pressure - the force of water acting upon a body immersed in the water, equal in all directions at a specific depth. During descent, pressure increases 0.445 psi per foot of depth in salt water or one atmosphere per 33 feet of salt water. Absolute pressure - this is the sum of all pressures acting on an object. In diving (humans or fish) this is the sum of the atmospheric pressure and hydrostatic pressure. It seems that a fish going for a swim from deep water (25') to shallow water (8') or back to deep from shallow, will experience much more of a pressure change than any weather condition could offer. I believe weather changes can bring us good fishing by cutting down on light reaching fish and by creating wave action that puts bait fish on the move in shallow water. Give me favorable weather (changing) and a friendly moon phase and even I will become a pretty good fisherman. At least until a high sky comes my way."
1087957,Bigfishhunter,2009-03-14 12:15:00,803,"o.k. so bear with me now cause I am primarily a lake trout fisherman, but my best laker days have come during evenings with really high pressure where the water is flat calm. I can sit on a hole and jig out fish after fish after fish. Same goes in the fall or spring when they are on the reefs, still and calm with high pressure has been my fav. Maybe with the trout more light with the calm water is reaching the bottom making my offering more visible. Maybe it is the relative ease of the boat positioning, but these have been my observations. Again, sorry for the fact that I am not relating to eyes here."
