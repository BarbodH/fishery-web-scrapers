I am bringing my family up to Lac Seul but I'm starting to think it might be fun to load the boat up and give Pakwash a try for the day. Can anyone recommend where to put the boat in and areas to consider fishing in August? Thanks, Chris"

And the park is basically in the middle of the lake north-south wise. It would then be your choice to venture north or south from there. (In the spring, if the wind has been coming out of the west/southwest for a day or two, the walleyes stack up on the Provincial Park beach/shoreline too - not sure about August as they will probably be deeper than in the spring.)"
