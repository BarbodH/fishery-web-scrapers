1079217,bassface44,2009-02-07 12:04:00,96,"Heading out of Kenora on a houseboat trip this year after years in northern Quebec. None of our group have fished this area of LOTW. Our preliminary plan is to head down to the Barrier Island area (Allie, Shammis, etc) and use that as our first base camp area. My first question is how hard does the wind have to blow to make it sketchy to fish those main basin areas? Second, is this a good starting point? We want to fish productive water but also have a slight degree of secludedness. Would it be worth goin all the way down to Cliff Island to beat the crowds even more? Thanks for all your help in advance."
1079317,MN_Moose,2009-02-07 19:46:00,965,"You didn't mention what time of the year you are going. That will have some effect. To answer your primary question about going down to Cliff area, yes it would be worth the trip. From your base camp area you're not that far from Cliff. In a 17' boat with a 100hp motor it would be approximately 15 Â– 20 minutes. Cliff island area is not all that secluded. The big lodge (Totem) has boats running back and forth all day from main camp out to their guide boats and to Wiley. For more seclusion you might consider heading southwest of your base. We do like to make a day trip down once during the week. We don't need to, we simply like to as a change of scenery. Yes the devils elbow is a good starting area. In reality, on your way down from Kenora, you're going past most of my best fishing spots. Ya, we see a boat here and there every day but it's not like you're right next to someone. The outfitter who rents the houseboat to you will provide a map for camp areas. Those spots are primarily sand beaches with few rocks. By asking about main basin areas, are referring to the water south of the barrier islands? I've been out there is some pretty good waves but nothing like I've been on Leech or Winnie. There are many areas you can get out of the wind and still fish."
1079336,2Labs,2009-02-07 22:56:00,685,"I have fished that area for 27 trips starting in 1993. I have an 18' dual console Lund. When the wind reaches 25 mph, it gets pretty rough on the open water. If you look at the charts (and I suspect you have based on your knowledge of the Barrier Islands), there are lots of ways the wind can run through funnels for 6, 8, 10 miles. At or above 20 mph winds, boat control can be a real challenge if you are bottom bouncing or trying to vertical jig. I have an 80 pound thrust trolling motor ... my 65 was not enough.With winds above 25 mph, traveling through those funnel areas can be ""challenging"" (read ""nasty"") ... with rollers generally in the 3-foot range. I have been in constant 3-footers with occasional 4-footers mixed in, and it is NOT fun. One powers up the oncoming side under low throttle and then chops throttle to surf down the far side.Having said that, most of the traffic on the northern end of LOW (in the NE Quadrant) will be 3 or 4 miles south of the Barrier Islands and then north from there. YES, it will be worth your while -- depending on wind conditions -- to make the trip further south.I assume you are going for walleye fishing. If so, here is some input you may (or may not ... lol) find useful.If you are going in July, check the lake humps -- that is the typical walleye pattern if LOW is experiencing a typical summer. Food shelves along the windward side of islands work also, but the trade-off is your electronics are limited in effectiveness the shallower you get, of course. You will find few weed beds in that area -- it is all Canadian shield. But, if you find some, fish them!!If you are going in early to mid-June, start by looking at shorelines -- the walleyes may or may not have reached their summer pattern yet.GET GOOD Navigational maps ... preferably you want to be using GPS units showing contours ... and use them. There are a LOT of reefs out there ... some not even marked on the government's navigational maps. I have friends who have taken off lower units (one guy twice) even with good maps and lots of experience on that very water.Hope you have a good trip! LOW is a fantastic fishery!"
1079365,bassface44,2009-02-08 09:25:00,96,"Thanks for both of your replies. Sorry I didn't mention when we are going. I know that has a lot to do with how to fish. We will be up there the week of July 11th, Sat-Sat. We will only have the rental boats from the outfitter which are 16ft with 20hp motors. we are used to not having the luxury of a bow mount trolling motor or high HP motors though. These boats actually will have more HP than we normally get. Our group is primarily walleye oriented. Although there are individuals who take a more multi species approach, myself included. I imagine that most will focus on the eyes and a couple will spend some time on smallmouth and muskies as well. Sounds like the wind has to really blow to make things unfishable. Most of our group live on and fish Lake Ontario and Erie quite a bit where a 10mph wind out of the right direction makes things less than fun. It sounds like we will be spending a lot of time learning the hundreds of humps in that area. If you have any more info you wish to pass along I'm all ears. Thanks again."
1079429,2Labs,2009-02-08 14:43:00,685,"Make DARN SURE you get a locator on those boats. Those humps are hard to find. Get the MNR navigational map, too. They cost about $10. If you don't have a GPS, a GPS with mapping capability and a LOW NE Quadrant map from Lakemaster on it would be a very nice thing to have. You can get VERY turned around fast and those islands all look alike once you are lost. ALSO, some of the reefs I talked about are ONE FOOT underwater at times because the water level can vary from week to week per rain and per setting of the gates at the dam in Kenora. Like I said, there are a lot of reefs!Even a non-mapping GPS (if some of you are hunters you may have some an old hand-held one exclusively for hunting like I did for 12 years ... lol ... my wife just bought me a handheld mapping GPS for hunting as a Christmas present) will get you back to your houseboat. It will also help you re-find the humps to fish again once you located them originally. Mark the spot on the map with the waypoint number you code into the GPS and you will always know where you are ... that is how we did it for 6 years before we got our first mapping GPS for the boat.Quote: Originally Posted by bassface44Our group is primarily walleye oriented.

Most of our group live on and fish Lake Ontario and Erie quite a bit where a 10mph wind out of the right direction makes things less than fun. .In a 16 foot camp boat, things can get exciting fast when the wind blows. Make sure you check the weather on the horizon because it can change fast. LOW is big enough at 980,000 acres that it literally makes its own climate. Before we bought our own boat, my wife and I fished out of camp boats for 1 year (1993) -- and that experience is why we decided we wanted our own boat. Those camp boats won't have a lot of free board. Having said that, I fished in some 1- to 2-footers (not fun in 2-footers) in those camp boats -- but I stayed in leeward spots when anything bigger started. You won't get the huge rollers like on Ontario and Erie, but it gets pretty nasty and choppy on LOW with that funneled wind.The experiences you have on Ontario and Erie will help you a lot. I would imagine that gets much nastier than LOW. Just keep an eye on the wind and white caps.The camp we go to has switched to 17 foot Lunds and Crestliner 1750 FishHawks as campboats. Nearly none of their customers rent the old 16-footers anymore due to lack of freeboard and the desire to be a little safer in the 2-footers. Also just FYI.Quote: Originally Posted by bassface44It sounds like we will be spending a lot of time learning the hundreds of humps in that area. If you have any more info you wish to pass along I'm all ears. Thanks again.I will be up there for 2 weeks while you are up there. Too bad the houseboat services don't put their names on the side of the boats or I would watch for you. I bet I have 400 LOW waypoints in my GPS and probably 150 of them are spots in that exact area (combined total fishing shelves, bars, humps, and reef outlines ... lol)."
1079437,Rather Be Lucky,2009-02-08 15:38:00,256,"I've been going to LOW off and on since '86 and many of those have been on houseboats out of Souix Narrows. They are an awesme way to get out on the lake. We used the rental on the first year and it was OK. I recomend that you get some good info from the houseboat people and then go as far as you can on the frist day to the areas you want to fish...that time of year it will be humps...which as one poster said are really hard to find as the maps are right it is just hard to get the right perspective and you can be off by less than 50' and you won't know it. Reefs can come out of nowhere marked or not!!! You will need to find the humps with the locator and triangulating off of the map. A GPS with a LOW map chip lets you drive to the humps!! Anyway, go as far as you can and as close as you can, to the areas you want to fish. This way the size of the boat becomes less relevent as the ""base"" is close by...you can fish the early and late times with minimal travel. Then as the week progresses you can work your way back. The HB will only travel about 6mph so its a long journey where ever you go...Be sure to listen to the weather and the wind direction. Park your HB on a sandy shore in a well protected area. Be sure the wind is not going to push you on shore, it is really tough to dislodge one of those big beasts when it is truely beached...Been there Done that!! There are lots of those sandy spots (the are made by wind and waves) but there are other HB too, so when you have a plan to go some where have a plan B and C so you can find the right spot...These boats do not turn on a dime and have no brakes... just forget about the anchor except for an emergency. Basing out of Souix Narrows we would try to get the HB out to Deadbroke then work our way back from there the rest of the week and leave on our last morning form Yellow Girl back to SN About a ""3 hr cruise"". My advise is to read the map, mark it with a pointer as you travel to keep track of the islands as they all look alike from eye level. Pay atten to the shipping lanes and the bouys....Be sure to be on the correct side of the bouy...I have a rock named after me because it was the first bouy we saw after changing directions...went on the wrong side....they have removed some so don't use old maps or you will REALLY be confused. It is wonderful way to vacation....one more thing when you tow your boats (which is a piece of cake) remember when you stop on the beach...they don't!!! Have agreat time...go south you won't regret it...last year 31.5, 30, 28.5 the biggest off the humps near Cliff. Good Luck ,Swede"
1079439,bassface44,2009-02-08 15:51:00,96,"At this point we will have at least two Lowrance handhelds with LOTW lakemaster chips for the fishing boats and we have more than enough handheld GPS units to go around just not all of them can get the maps put on them. Hopefully someone else ponies up and grabs a lakemaster chip but at least everyone will have there own GPS. We have fished the Gouin Res., and several have been to the BWCA as well. I think everyone has been lost before on these shield lakes and thats why we have the GPS units we do now. I know 4 out of our group of 8 have the Hot Spots paper map for the area right now and all of us have been going over it again and again. The number of ""fishable"" locations is freaking awesome. I would say that navigation has been our number one concern as we have planned for this trip. Our otfitter mentioned that there will be cell service and we were planning on using our cells for emergency communication should one fo our group get turned around on the lake. How is the cell service up there really? Thanks for the info Swede. We have been missing the big walleye for a couple years now. We pulled some 30"" fish out of the Gouin res a few years back but the lake we have gone to for the past two years has only been able to produce 25"" fish."
1079500,2Labs,2009-02-08 19:39:00,685,"Oh ... and one thing good to remember ... the river FLOWS NORTH to Kenora. When you are following the navigational routes think of the following 2 items as you are closing in on marker buoys (and there are a bunch of them out there -- plus there are lots of very narrow openings between islands on the main navigational routes where you will come onto marker buoys suddenly).""Put Red to the Right Upstream"" or PRRU is when you are going SOUTH on the navigational route. Other people may know it as ""Put Red to the Right Returning"".""Put Red to the Left Downstream"" or PRLD is when you are going NORTH on the navigational route.Sounds like you guys are getting set up right with your GPS units. You should be in good shape.We scout the humps until we find fish and then we bottom bounce that area until we find concentrations of fish. Then we throw out a marker and jig. Once in a while we throw out cranks, too. The forage base is Perch, by the way."
1079717,2Labs,2009-02-09 15:37:00,685,"Lots of smallies in LOW. In that area you want to fish the reefs for them. They love the reefs and rock islands because they can move out of the wind and current when it gets bad and not have to go too far to do it. Smallies like current, but not like walleyes do (you guys probably know that already). Plus the reefs have lots of nice niches to congregate in. It doesn't hurt to fish the reefs around the navigational buoys for walleyes and smallies both ... but giant rocky reef complexes are better, in my opinion. If you look at island complexes -- islands close together with lots of exposed rocks (rocks are marked with an * or + on your Fishing HotSpots Map) and shallow flats (6-8-10-12 feet deep) inside the overall boundary of the island complex -- you fill find a lot of Smallies along with walleyes. They love to hit cranks and jigs with plastic crawlers on the shorlines and bars and flats of those complexes where basket-ball size and garbage can size or larger bolders are found in 4,6,8,10,12 feet of water."
1080263,Rather Be Lucky,2009-02-11 16:32:00,256,"Good point about the radios..the best would be hand held Marine radios as they have weather and much better range plus the Coast Guard monitors the emergency channels. Safety is key! But you shoudn't have too much problem with cell phones...we've had good luck calling Souix Narrows from way out there so I would think Kenora would be easier. I got to thinking about the other areas ""near"" Cliff...There are some real good humps west of Deadbroke...south and east of Rope...Gull, Britania, Whiteout (These all have good mooring spots close by)...really...all the humps seem to produce some fish... some better than others...if you slide off into the deeper water you will most likely catch some sauger and don't forget the perch...there are some dandies . We generally try to get there the last half of July to the middle of Aug., we find the weather to be somewhat more stable and the hump pattern is well established. So your timing should be good. As for the different spiecies, we don't target them, but a few smallmouth are a lot of fun, even a respectable ""slime dart"" is OK but rarely kept...not at all in my boat.. LOL. There is also some very good crappie water... Really.. if you keep your eyes open and watch what the guide boats are doing you can get there before they do and then go back after they leave...the advantage of having your ""cabin"" on the water. Some of my friends are planning a HB trip this year ...one I cannot make...but it sure gets me thinking....I was to LOW three times last year for a week each time..two of those were primarily for the crappies but those were the end of May and the middle of Sept...Different story. I know I'll be there for at least one week in Sept this year...By the way, all those big fish from the last post, went back in the lake. I got to net some of them...none were on my pole...but I claim superior boat control for their success!!! And the biggest one came from the hump I told the other guys to go to...What a Dummy!! A lot of hooting and hollering then!!! Camera flashes like a lightning storm!!! Leeches are like candy but really expensive...In earlier years we've gone thru 8 pounds for 6 guys plus crawlers when we were being conservative...a half crawler works very well and are easy to keep. We pull cranks over the tops of the humps with leadcore...minnows are also good but you tend to get 11 and a dead one for a dozen.. and they are some trouble to take care of too...Salted minnows (you can bring them) also work suprisingly well, as does gulp. We stick mostly to the crawlers as we can bring them with us from home...bring a lot!! Swede"
1080461,bassface44,2009-02-12 11:16:00,96,"Thanks for all of the great info you guys. I can't believe it's still only February. Swede, Do you guys still go through that much bait. We were plannin' on a mix of leeches and worms but not in the quantity you were talkin about. How many walleye are you catchin' in a week if you're goin' through 8 lbs of leeches? Sounds like a lot of fun. Right now it looks like we are going to try and stage around Allie and Little Allie. That way we can fish both North and South of there and decide if we want to move then. Thanks again for all of your help."

Thanks Swede, you just confirmed what everybody used to deny. Of all the slagging done towards guides, this just goes to show who the real problem out on the lake is. Why don't you work to find spots, just like the guides instead of being a A$$ out there. Good advice NOT to take. My advice, ASK one of the guides from that area who DO come here, we are more than willing to share info. I'm known here, & everybody who knows me will tell you that I am more than willing to share / do share."
1080578,Guest,2009-02-12 19:13:00,0,"as a fellow guide i find swedes comments disturbing.wait till they leave then go fish the spot.i'm betting you would also suggest to first timers on lotw to just pull right up on a guide boat and fish along side them too.having guided for some time now ive seen it all.i can recall being surrounded by private boats.i have at times had to ask my guests to refrain from yelling obscenities at them.so i politely pick up and move as i am non-confrontational. wouldnt it be just as easy to look at your map and check to see what type of structure or depth i'm fishing and then pick out other spots that are similar and try them? although not all guide boats would offer help you might just try asking,i have on many occaisions offered advice on where the bite is.although i wont give up my honey holes,i'll point you in the right direction. we all fish because we enjoy the outdoors and their is no reason whatsoever to follow swede's advice. with almost a million acres of water to fish there is no reason to provoke confrontations with other sportsmen.we can and should respect one another out there.i know if i was in a private boat and needed assistance of any kind,be it an emergency or not ,i'd like to be able to ask another sportsmen for help.so please lets all get along and enjoy our beautiful resource. as for some of the posts in the past about being buzzed by guide boats.have some of you picked a spot right on a blind corner in a major route and then surprised when we pass within a few feet of you?did you look at your map after and then realize that there was a reef or rock that prevented us from taking an alternate course at the last second?i put more miles on my boat in a single season than some of you do in a car.i avoid fishing high traffic areas and in blind spots for the safety of myself and my guests.i never intentionally buzz or wake out another boat and if it does happen it is most likely unintended as i didnt see you until the last second."
1080668,Guest,2009-02-13 07:47:00,0,"i am a guide and am seeing this more often , too bad you don't try to figure out why we are fishing there, instead of just raping our holes one thing i see is a lack of education from the guide followers,, if they took the time to figure out what was going on, they wouldn't have to camp out on another persons bread and butter, in essence ruining his livelyhood,, i fish my spots cause i actually understand what the fish are doing and why , maybe it's just laziness, , maybe , guess you just have to be smarter than the fish,,"
1080923,2Labs,2009-02-13 22:18:00,685,"[quote=1 totem guide;1080554] Thanks Swede, you just confirmed what everybody used to deny. Of all the slagging done towards guides, this just goes to show who the real problem out on the lake is. Why don't you work to find spots, just like the guides instead of being a A$$ out there. [quote]I don't condone what Swede said nor what he recommended.But what you state is only part of the story. Time to hear the other side.Here is what has happened to ME and my wife in the past 5 years on LOW. There are other instances as well over my 16 years on that water, but these specifics will do to make my point.1. I decided to check out and fish a hump I had never seen another boat on in the 3 or 4 years I had been fishing the general area of LOW being discussed in this thread. It turned out to be a great spot. My wife and I fished that hump for 2 days in a row with great success in numbers and size of walleyes. On the 3rd day I went back and there was a boat anchored on top of that hump with a bunch of guys casting cranks from every angle from every open spot in that boat.2. My wife and I were fishing a bar -- a fairly well-known and well-used spot just south of the French Narrows. A boat pulled up to the other side of the bar barely 20 yards away from us (having come from the southeastern horizon and having had enough ""eyes-on"" time to have clearly seen our boat there), anchored, and a bunch of guys started casting cranks while the driver of the boat pretended to ignore us.3. My wife and I were fishing 2 humps out of a close group of 3 humps south of the Narrows. All 3 were in a 50-yard radius. Our 2 were about 40 yards apart. I had put out 2 orange marker buoys -- one on the side of each hump. I was pulling bottom bouncers between the 2 orange buoys and over the top of those 2 humps. A boat came from the horizon (again!) and had enough ""eyes-on"" time to have clearly seen that I was fishing those 2 humps, and going back and forth over them. That boat pulled up within 10 yards of one of my orange markers, anchored, and a bunch of guys in it started casting. By the way, I was 20 yards away from that marker and heading toward it when that boat pulled up. THE HORIZON WAS EMPTY OF BOATS! I couldn't believe it! I got fed up and pulled my 2 markers including the one 10 yards away from that boat while that driver just sat and stared at me. Some of the people in his boat had to stop casting while I picked up and slowly and deliberately wound up the line on my marker nearest that boat. We left. I figured that water was big enough that I could find another spot that had fish on it even if that driver wasn't capable.Also, in none of those 3 cases was the driver fishing -- thereby leading me to believe those were ""guided boats"" and not just rude guests of the particular camp whose name was on the side of the boat in big white letters. In fact, in the 3rd instance I was so fed up with that kind of behavior I notified the owner of the camp we patronize, and the owner of our camp called that driver's camp to formally complain about what happened.I thought you might find these incidents interesting in light of your comment ""this just goes to show who the real problem out on the lake is"". Seems Swede isn't the only one playing the game of ""my best fish locator is a combination of my binoculars and another boat that worked hard to find fish"". Like the prior post says ... the ""guilt"" shoe here probably fits the feet of both guides and non-guides. I'd be real quiet about making broad generalizations about who causes what problems if I were you. Sounds like both sides are equally guilty."
1080981,Guest,2009-02-14 08:40:00,0,"""secret spot""? not much of a secret now was it?anyone with a pair of binoculars can have your secrets. ""navy fleet"" now thats a bit of an overstatement dont you think?ive never seen more than 2 lodge boats and thats any lodge out there on the same spot.the fishing on lotw isnt so poor that we need to do that but i have seen convoys of houseboat fisherman ganging up on humps.all the power to ya when that hump gets cleaned it'll just be one more spot that won't hold fish the following day.and i dont think its so much the case of poor fishing just poor fisherman.i think if great spots were what you wanted that everyone in the group would spread out and try multiple spots and then after talking to your buds you could figure out which structure types or depths the fish are located at. i think that if i had gone from spot to spot all day without much success i might have come to the conclusion that my approach was not working a lot earlier in the day.guys can spend thousands on a trip but just wont spend a few more to hire a guide who can in minutes show you what you are missing.fishing is a learning experience. if you just go out and wet a line all day without results then you're just not learning and cant be dissapointed with your results.fishing is called fishing because if it wasnt it would be called catching."

1081017,2Labs,2009-02-14 10:37:00,685,"Nice post, Jake. I think I would be pretty offended if I were being paid to put my customers on fish and someone I DIDN'T KNOW pulled up next to me (but my friends and buddies have an open invitation and are always welcome to fish alongside me). ""Good on you"" for being a bigger man than most of us.And, if I ever see Totem #8 out there, I will indeed stop and say ""Hi"". I won't fish alongside you because I won't take a chance on ticking off your customers and maybe costing you some tip money, but I will say ""Hi"" from a respectful distance, trade observations on what pattern works and what doesn't work for us that day, and then move on. (As I was about to hit the ""submit"" button for this post it just occurred to me ... I will probably never be able to find you because I don't have a pair of binoculars in my boat so I will never be able to check for #8 ... ... binoculars just aren't part of my fishing equipment! )Your invitation goes ""back at ya"" if you see a gray Lund Mr. Pike 18 with a dual console, a 150 black Opti, and a T-8 gray port-side kicker in the area south of the Barrier Islands. That'd be ME (or, I should say ""US"")! Stop and say ""Hi"" if you think your customers won't mind a little conversation with some friendly people from Wisconsin.You sound like a man I would enjoy meeting."
1081028,stinkycat,2009-02-14 11:35:00,2018,Nice Job Jake! Fishing is a great sport for all involved. I would feel very fortunate to be able to make my living as a guide and be able to enjoy the great resource more often. I know dealing with the public can be a pain in the neck but in my opinion I hope everyone catches fish. I will share any ideas or knowledge with anyone that is interested. When I am out fishing I hope to catch fish and maybe catch a new friend. One thing to remember is a lot of people have tight budgets and maybe have allocated just enough for the trip and the money for the guide just wasn't in the cards this trip. Maybe next time it will be!!!
1081230,2Labs,2009-02-15 10:11:00,685,"Bassface ... you will be able to forward troll in those camp boats. When we were using them back in 1993 we were able to vertical jig out of them even in wind ... by using the 20 hp motor and shifting forward/backward as needed to hold the spot. We have a bunch of friends who tag along with us in July for a couple of days each year (they say my locator always finds more fish than theirs does ... lol) and a pair of them always use one of the old 16-foot camp boats with a 20 hp motor and always bottom bounce going forward.If you do a search on Bottom Bouncing on this site, you will find a wealth of information here. We generally use 2 ounce weights for me in the front of the boat to keep my bouncer down and not tangle with the rearmost bouncer lines. We then use 1.5 ounce weights for people in the rear of the boat so they don't tangle with my bouncer. We are generally fishing in 15-35 feet of water and don't change weights just because depth changes.This is also an extremely good reference complete with pics. It is written by a friend of mine -- the guy who taught my wife and I to use the technique 15 years ago. He has retired now, but we spent a LOT of time in his boat and learned a lot about bouncing. I hope I am not violating any WalleyeCentral rules by posting the thread link. If it gets removed, PM me and I will send it to you that way.http://www.justfishontario.net/botto...ing_a_to_z.htmAs far as crappies go, I have only fished for them in the fall. But, from what I have read, they like to suspend off the reefs in deeper water (sorry, I can't define ""deeper"" as used in this instance)."
1081244,jakeou812,2009-02-15 11:14:00,8,"last summer these guys i guided turned me on to this they called the prop it was like a spinner but it was more like tiny buzz bomb that went onto the line with a couple of beads it had about a 5 to 6 foot lead with dual trout hooks tiped with half a night crawler behind a 1 to 2 oz bottom bouncer and was trolled 3 to 4 mph it worked well on windy days when the reefs where unfishable i found it was a great way to cover water fast and trigger non active big fish into bitting in 5 days we boated 17 walleyes between 26"" and 31"" i will post a few pics on my profole of some of the fish we caught i found the speed of the troll was key and you could troll these things with alot less snags you could really fish alot of spots where a jig would get snaged every time you put it over the side of the boat it worked with minnows and leeches but crawlers was best i hardley use worms but now i always have em in the boat"
1081250,Wall-i-Lama,2009-02-15 11:26:00,1524,"Jake, Thanks for the reply! I'm sure that what happened to me was the exception and I really didn't take offense and BTW: didn't catch very many fish on that spot Bass Face, Check your private message regarding some crappie info."
1081253,jakeou812,2009-02-15 11:32:00,8,for crappies if you were to make the east end of cliff island your base camp theres a place called blueberry inlet the entrance is just about 4 miles southeast of cliff island depending on the lake levels it can be tricky to get into when you go in just stay on the left side of the passage when you get near the end get a little to the right side and your in ive had great crappie fishing in there all season theres good walleye fising in there to its a great place to spend a whole day its like being in a whole different lake the water has a real stained color to it compaired to the main lake so if you get the chance it would be worth checking out
1081272,Guest,2009-02-15 13:12:00,0,"bass face if you havent had much experience with spinner rigs or bottom bouncers dont bother.if you are fishing with more than 2 people in the boat it will just lead to frustration and a lot of tackle donated to the bottom.although it is an effective technique vertically jigging is simply easier.you mentioned earlier in this thread that you would be using a 16ft'er with a 20 hp.hopefully it's a tiller not a console as it will make the following advice easier. when you find fish on a hump or reef using your graph drop off a marker bouy then circle back and put the rear of the boat facing into the wind .occaisionally slip the motor in and out of reverse just to say you're sitting still as the wind pushes you forward. this way you can hover directly over the school of walleyes.if the bite slows down move around a bit in relation to your marker bouy.if you find them again throw another marker out.walleyes are always moving so you move too. if the fish are shallow use a 1/8 ounce or smaller jig,if a bit deeper then use a 1/4 or larger jig always maintaining contact with bottom.if the wind picks up it may be necessary to go to a 3/8 or larger jig. these reefs are extremely rocky in nature and will swallow up jigs quickly if you let them sit on bottom for too long.as jigs are relatively cheap in comparison to spinner rigs they are the best bet for this type of structure.i cant stress enough the impotance of having enough bait as well.i have at times used 10 doz. minnows and 6 dozen leeches between four people in a single morning/ afternoon. as for crappies they are often hit and miss.there are areas or spots that have them with some regularity,and the ones i know are quite far from your stated destination.someone else here may be better able to tell you where to look closer to where you will be fishing. my apology for taking your questions off topic earlier,just trying to say that you can find fish on your own without ruffling anyones feathers.there are good and bad fishermen and good and bad guides.if you see a boat pulling away from a spot ask yourself if the fishing was so good there,why would they leave?in closing i wish you and your buds the best trip possible.i'm very sure you wont be dissapointed and will return time and time again.i think you might find that some would dispute or argue the advice i have given you,and they are all entitled to their own opinions or advice.as i fish for a living i'm not far off.good luck and good fishing."
1081371,bassface44,2009-02-15 22:36:00,96,"Thanks for all the great replies. The info is tremendous. I think I just like to talk fishing and this gives me an excuse. lotwguide, No problem on the small jaunt off topic. I think people said their piece and we are all better for it now. Sometimes its nice to get a small reminder to do unto others. As for bottom bouncing, my experience is mostly fishing threeway rigs, carolina rigs, and lindy rigging. All are essentially the same presentation. the difference I see in bottom bouncing seems to be the terminal end when pulling spinner rigs. That is where my experience is lacking. I know that a certain amount of speed is needed to get blades turning correctly but having not done it a lot and without a bowmount trolling motor I know it could get interesting. I know I can get certain spinners to use while drifting that don't require as much force to get the blades turning but they aren't going to displace as much water either. This idea of trolling at a quick pace though is intriguing. I would prefer to jig fish to the boat and if I can troll at 4mph with certain harnesses and find fish that way that could be the ticket. At the end of the day it gives me an excuse to buy more tackle. When it comes to blade sizes and shapes do people have personal preferences. Is there one that is better on LOTW? For example will willow blades outfish colorado or indiana, are hammered metalics better than straight colored blades etc. I have some components to build as necessary Thanks for the info on the Crappie. I think we are going to have a most species category for the trip and it wouldn't be a bad thing to bring a couple home for appetizers either."
1081854,bassface44,2009-02-17 20:21:00,96,This is what I was hoping to hear about the crayfish. I'm not as worried about them as a food source for the walleye as I was about them as a food source for our group. I have spent two trips in the Boundary Waters where the same invasive crayfish is readily available. Just as you both mention they are everywhere you look. My friend and I thought it was a joke at first when we saw so many but it sounds like a similar thing is happening on LOTW. I can tell you from experience that they are quite delicious. Almost the same as their southern brethren in Louisiana. Little more work then lobster but just as tender. Our plan right now is to grab a bunch and add em to a Fett Alfredo dish for one of our dinners. If we don't get enough they will likely become appetizers though. If we were going to start with an amount of bait for 8 guys where would you start. Right now we are leaning on at least a flat of worms and at least a pound of leeches...we can't decide on where to augment our livebait to begin. We can get reinforced on Wednesday of our trip so we don't have to bring a weeks worth to start with.
1081869,2Labs,2009-02-17 21:32:00,685,"The guys who run the docks at the camp my wife and I go to have a trap they use for crayfish and have an occasional feast based on their trappings. So, it is being done and you should be successful in your attempt.If you are planning on being able to refill your bait half way through the trip, a flat and a pound should be a good start. If you cannot refill, then I would double that. The problem will be keeping the crawlers from overheating and keeping the water fresh for the leeches. But, as you have been on Canadian trips before, you probably know that. Be careful about the crawlers. Some places don't feed them after they get them and you can get some very thin crawlers. Check with your source to make sure you don't run into that problem."
1082049,Chris K,2009-02-18 18:17:00,278,"I think you will need more than a pound of leeches. When I go to LOTW I pretty much use leeches, and most of the time we rig with them on humps. I go for a week in the middle of August each year. Most days of really good hump fishing we would go through 1 to 1 and a half pounds of Leeches that were 120 to the pound. That's what we go through in 10 to 12 hours on the water fishing pretty hard each day with two or three of us in the boat. I find the leeches to work better myself, and if I am pulling spinners, then I use the 6"" Gulp crawlers, and I don't really notice much of a difference for that presentation vs real ones. I actually think I end up catching more fish as the worm diesn't get ripped up when boating really small fish, and if I miss a bite, I can just keep things down there until I get hooked up instead of reeling up and checking to see if the crawler is still there. Chris K"
1083022,Guest,2009-02-23 09:23:00,0,"bassface, sounds like your fishing experience is some what limited. I believe you need more of a Wisconsin influence. It should be availabe for a slight fee when you arrive at LOW"
1085215,bassface44,2009-03-03 14:39:00,96,Anyone fish after dark up in this area?
1086016,MN_Moose,2009-03-07 07:42:00,965,No not really. The water is stained so there isn't a big advantage to fishing in the dark. Some good fishing at sunset. When your parked at your HB in the sand cove it might be good to pitch a twister tail right near your camp. I wouldn't venture far though. It's tough enough navigating in the day. Compound that 10 times at night.
1086910,Gussy,2009-03-10 16:00:00,2,"The center section of the lake that you are going to be fishing is ""traditional"" walleye water. There are some smallmouths, but there are much better areas in the lake for them. You are in the heart of the best walleye fishing on the lake though.You are getting plenty of quality advice from most of these folks."

1087906,Eatmore,2009-03-14 09:15:00,14,what are some of the best areas on lotw for smallmouth in summer? what baits do you use and what depths are you fishing at?
1081401,2Labs,2009-02-16 06:45:00,685,"We pull our rigs with crawlers at 1-1.1 mph -- which was recommended to me by Mike Brumbaugh of the pro tour. He said that was the generally recommended speed. There are times that the fish to prefer slower and there are times that the fish will hit those same rigs up to 2 mph if they are aggressive and if you want to use it as a search bait and cover ground.Our blade sizes vary from thumbnail size to double that. I have never seen shape make a big difference but have been told by pros that the order of importance is generally accepted as 1.) size, 2.) shape, 3.) color. We use primirily Colorado blades in hammered brass (gold) and hammered nickel (silver), and then to a lesser extent chartreuse and bright orange. We use the hammered stuff because we feel that flash is important in stained water like LOW (it is coffee colored). Last year we experimented with glow-blades from Cabela's and they worked pretty well in that dark water. (Expose the blades to sunlight and then they give off light at fishing depths.)"
1081736,bassface44,2009-02-17 09:53:00,96,"Again, thank you for the info and the speedy replies. My new inquiry may seem a little off the wall but I was wondering what you guys may know about crayfish population levels in this area of LOTW. I have read that the Rusty crayfish has found its way into the lake and localized populations can be quite large. I was thinking about experimenting with some crayfish imitations for walleye. Is it worth the effort. I was thinking it could be a way to focus on larger fish since the rusty is such a large critter itself. And if the populations are big enough I was thinkin of grabbin a few for the table too."
1081741,2Labs,2009-02-17 10:33:00,685,"I don't know a Rusty crayfish from a Shiny Oiled one (sorry, couldn't resist) but I do know that LOW is crawling with crayfish (pun intended) and they will be found all over the lake. We have even had them latch onto our crawlers while jigging in 30-35 feet. They love the rocks of the Canadian Shield. Both walleyes and smallies will be regurgitating crayfish when you boat them."
1081786,Guest,2009-02-17 15:40:00,0,"yes lotw is absolutely polluted with crayfish. as to which variety they are i am not sure.i have found that at about the time you are plannng your trip, the walleyes have eaten most of the young of the year baitfish on deeper humps and especially the really big walleyes cant expend much energy chasing small minnows so switch their protein source to crayfish.these humps usually top off at less than 10ft.you will find plenty of big bass on top of the shallow humps at say 2ft to 8ft. and off the sides of these humps in 8-12 ft.those big walleyes are present.if its overcast those big walleyes can even be right on top.but a match the hatch presentation isnt necessary.i'll use a light jig to avoid snags and tip it with a big leech.those big walleyes arent real fussy just hungry and will hit almost anything.one day as we were running low on leeches i switched to a shaky head jig and a finesse worm and did very well on both bass and walleyes. last year about this time 3 guests and i boated 22 walleyes over 22"" . one morning 5 over 24"" including a 29-1/2"" and lost a 30""+at boatside.(cheap jig broke in half)and all of them came from less than 12ft. of water adjacent to a shallow reef.as for eating those crayfish ,a few guests have just simply dropped them into the pan of hot oil and let them sizzle until they were bright red,and after a few minutes to cool they broke off the heads and sucked em back.they claimed they were delicious but i prefer their atlantic cousins with a bit of garlic butter.hope you find this helpful and bring lots of leeches. i suggest you buy them by the pound!!!by far the best money you'll spend on your trip."
1081040,jakeou812,2009-02-14 12:22:00,8,thats exactley the way i see it weather the tourists spend there dollors on guides gas bait food tackle whatever it is it bennifits the people who live here all year so all im saying is if a guy thats having a tough time out there needs some help getting a few more fish in the boat ill help him in a minute just cause that might be what decides if the guy comes back year after year and trust me us locals want you to come back ..
1081131,Wall-i-Lama,2009-02-14 19:35:00,1524,"Interesting Topic. I was fishing a spot last year on LOTW and got buzzed by a boat from Totem. At first I thought that he was just not paying attention. Then he did a 180 and buzzed me again. He made it very clear that I was fishing on ""his"" spot. No, I didn't poach the spot, just fishing around the lake with the wife and kids, pulled up on a hump and we fished it for the first time. Used the Map, GPS and common sense to find the spot. I think it is wrong to follow a guide or any boat and then fish that spot and I think it is wrong that someone buzzes another boat, guide or no guide. I feel this is real easy. whoever is on the spot first, they temporarily own it, first come, first serve. If you return to one of ""your"" spots and someone is on it, it doesn't matter if you are a guide or not, put on your big girl panties and find another. Happy hookin!"

1081174,jakeou812,2009-02-15 05:12:00,8,sorry to hear you and your family got buzzed by one of our boats i hear of storys like that all the time its really to bad that i work with people like that alot of the guides that work there come from out of town just as you do then they get showed or find 3 or 4 spots on there own and then for some strange reason they think they own these spots ive even heard them refer to them spots as there spots the funny thing about is i was fishing most of these spots while they were looking for where totem was on there road map but for the most part most of the guides that i know of there are good guides its to bad theres a few new guys every year that make the rest of us look bad if it ever happens to you again or anybody else for that matter you should take down the boat number and your location and time and phone the office and somthing will be done about it theres no reason for things like this to happen its a big lake out there..........
1081210,bassface44,2009-02-15 08:42:00,96,"Okay. Hopefully everyone got what they needed to out of their system so we can get back to feeding me info . Sounds like the consensus was: Be polite to your fellow anglers on the water whether they are a guide or not, and there is always a couple of bad apples in every bunch but don't let that cloud your judgment of the bunch as a whole. As an aside the name Wall-i-lama is hilarious. Getting back to the fishing side of things. If I am fishing out of a camp boat am I going to need to be back trolling spinner rigs or can I forward troll them too? How much weight will I need on the bottom bouncers, or pencil leads to stay on the bottom? We won't have bow mounted trolling motors and we haven't spent a lot of time fishing spinner rigs. In Quebec we jigged almost exclusively but the number of spots was far fewer than LOTW so we didn't have to cover nearly as much water. Also, what are the odds of finding some crappie while we are there. I know that spring and fall are more typical times to target them but they have to go somewhere right? As usual, any help is greatly appreciated. If anyone needs any info on the Gouin res or any of Berthelot Lake Lodge's lakes I would be happy to help."
1080769,bassface44,2009-02-13 12:43:00,96,"I have read the last few responses a few times now and I am still trying to decide how to respond. I will give it a shot though. I understand why the last three guide responses were so critical of the advice given in a previous post. The ""poaching"" of spots is a timeless debate and battle that has been around since fishing first began. Things always become even more complicated when you attach someone's livelihood to the issue. I can only speak for myself and my group when I say that you would never see us pulling up right next to a guide boat while they were fishing. I'm sure there are a myriad of stories of people doing just that but it would not happen with our group. The only time I have been near a guide when I wasn't the one being guided is on the Niagara River where the drift is only one boat wide to begin with. There are so many different types of users of the resource though that inevitably there will be people who will do things that you don't like. On such a large body of water with so many different places to fish I'm sure we will be able to find places to fish away from other people. That being said I can guarantee you that I, and everyone else who fishes, pay attention to where the guide boats go. The simple reason is because the guide supposedly knows where the fish are. So it makes sense that as a fisherman I would be curious as to where the guide is going. Now, I won't drive all over and look for the guide boats but I will pay attention when I see them. For myself, I am mostly interested in the depth of the active fish. This is a piece of information that is extremely useful and possible to get without even going over to a specific spot if I have a good map (which I do). Now, if I choose to go and fish the same area as the guide the next day, or even after they have left am I a jerk? It has been posted several times in these forums that the reefs are where its at in the summer. And it has also been posted that not all the reefs will hold fish. So you're telling me that if I have spent the better part of a day going reef to reef and not catching much and I see a guide boat leave a spot I have to move on to somewhere else? And I shouldn't fish that spot the next few days while I am there? And if I do I am lazy? This idea that because the guide makes his/her living, or a part of it, from fishing means that they should get preferential treatment when it comes to location is ridiculous. Last time I checked it is a public resource. By no means am I going to knowingly make it harder for the guide to do their job while on the water but realize that I am trying to enjoy the resource as well and that I have just as much a right as you to be in any particular location. I'm sure this sounds worse than I intend it to. I did not intend this thread to be a debate on guide vs. nonguide etiquette. I was just lookin' for some info to point us in the right direction before our first trip to a large body of water."
1080779,Guest,2009-02-13 13:21:00,0,"When we come to canada...Never been to Lake of the woods....as we feel there are too many people and too much civilization..we do whatever is necessary to stay away from other boats. Even having them in sight is too close. We have had to move more than once because someone else didn't value the serenity of the wilderness apparently as much as we do. The boats that have come close enough to move us off our drift have as often been guide boats as private boats.....So go figure. If you see me on the water,don't take it personally if I give you a grimace and move quietly away. I'll buy you a beer back on shore"
1080795,rockpt,2009-02-13 14:46:00,589,"Some of the summer reefs are small and definitely one boat spots. Others, like the Ball Field between Morson and Painted Rock Island, are huge and can easily hold several boats. I don't see any problem with approaching a large reef that already has boats on it. I've done it and have had other boats approach me. It happens all the time in the fall when the walleye school up in necked down areas with current. I enjoy meeting new people on the water, asking where they're from, where they're staying, etc. Have made more than a couple friends that way on LOTW. And if you want to be left alone, the lake is 70 x 40 miles with over 14,000 islands. Not hard to get away from other boats."
1080860,Guest,2009-02-13 18:20:00,0,"I am a frequent, almost weekly, LOTW fisherman. I am not a guide. I have been fishing LOTW for 20 years. Back in the day before GPS, I used to spend painful hours circling around with the paper map in my hand finding spots and calling them my own. I had many spots like this all to myself for many years. I would just like to respond to the complaining guides. I have had several occasions throughout the years when you ""expert guides"" would drive up and invade me on my spots. In many cases I would go to my secret spots and find a small ""navy fleet"" of lodge guide boats on them. Let's put the shoe on the other foot ! Don't throw stones when you live in a glass house !"
1079547,2Labs,2009-02-09 06:14:00,685,"Cell service is spotty. My brother can get service in spots from that area with his Verizon (we go up every August). I can't get it anywhere with my Cellular One so I take along a cell amplifier antenna and store it in a softside cooler under a console during our July trips (my wife and I). With it, I get service pretty much anywhere.OH, and one more point ... the Family Radio Systems (""walkie-talkies"") are an important thing to have. Range isn't going to be what the manufacturers say it is, but my ""7-mile"" current versions are good for about 2+ miles or so. REALLY helps when one boat finds a huge pod of fish or a pattern or a great-working-bait-setup and can notify the other boats. If you don't have them now, you can find them pretty inexpensively at Wal-mart. Be sure to buy the kind with ""security codes"" (most units have them now -- the code limits the people who can hear you on a particular channel) because you will hear a LOT of chatter on LOW no matter what channel you are on. Take extra batteries -- a set lasts about 1 day (2 at the tops) in my experience.Hand-held ""ship-to-shores"" have better range but will also be limited in range and are a lot more expensive."
1079648,bassface44,2009-02-09 11:53:00,96,Interesting news on the radios. We have taken them in the past and they have been worthless. What know you about the smallmouth in the area? I have heard that they can be pretty decent size but few and far between unless you hit the spawn.
