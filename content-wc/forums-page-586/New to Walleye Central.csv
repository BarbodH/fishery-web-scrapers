1085722,eyemike,2009-03-05 20:03:00,233,"Hi everyone just wanted to introduce myself, my names Mike. Been fishing eyes since I was a kid. We actually have quite a respectable river that runs right through the middle of town with a very good population of walleyes. Caught and released my all time biggest 32.25 inches, right in town. I have an older Daughter ""25"" who has been fishing since she was three. She has been to Canada several times with me and has caught several eyes over 7 lbs. My Wife and I are going to Stanley's Resort at Eagle Lake the second week of August. Been to Canada quite a bit but never to Eagle Lake. Well I am kind of rambling on but I just thought I would say hello to all."
