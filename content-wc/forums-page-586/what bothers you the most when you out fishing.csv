1085524,Pooch,2009-03-04 20:16:00,4619,"Bill, Good attitude. Did you learn that from those early trips? I've told my wife that if we can design our own version of eternity a lake in Canada with only her would be mine. The friend I mentioned a year ago who's early adventures with his dad almost paralleled yours stopped by today and showed me two old Kodachrome slides of him holding his first northern on a dock somewhere near Red Lake, ON when the only way there was gravel. Too bad the old Kodachrome had lost most detail and also turned blue. We scanned it and brought back a small percent of the detail and recovered some of the color for him. better than what he started with. He really appreciated the signed copy of your book I got for him. Thanks again for the good read. Good luck this summer. If you ever decide to try Savant let me know and I'll show you some of my sweet spots! We will be making two trips again this year. First trip will be with my wife. Second trip will be with four guys and six others from our other group at the same time. Group was getting too big and evolved into two groups. Logistics are much easier. My foursome will be there for two weeks the others just a week. O'Sullivan again? Pooch"
1085574,Bill Krejca,2009-03-05 07:43:00,6107,"Hey, Pooch, Yeah, back to O'Sullivan in July. Taking my son, 2 sons-in-law, friends. Expecting another great walleye trip. I've started my second book, on MY fishing trip experiences from around 1940's on, mostly about the LOW area. Once the north woods gets in your blood, like malaria, maybe?, it never leaves Bill Krejca"

1085651,Babamel2,2009-03-05 13:20:00,414,my wife got the biggest fish. I finally got a lure without hooks and showed it to everyone saying that was what I used so that she could purposely beat me.
1085657,muskiemamma,2009-03-05 14:03:00,6,"Well the only thing that bothers me, is the fact that people can't tell the truth about the size of there fish. I have caught two 29.75"" walleye and I won't let anyone give me that 1/4 inch. I have to catch one that is 30 to call it 30."
1085934,eyemike,2009-03-06 19:12:00,233,What I hate most is this pain I get right between my shoulder blades. About four days in the boat for 12 hours a day hoisting all those fish into the boat just about tears a guy up. The things we have to put up with just to fish is amazing!
1086933,Opti-Mist,2009-03-10 16:51:00,1402,Absolutely nothing bothers me when I'm fishing. Except maybe limiting out before lunch.

Boom! 9) Finding bait in the live well from last week. 10) No rain gear!
1083483,goldman,2009-02-24 21:57:00,1036,"One of many things comes to mind, that is my wife wanting to put her rod down, I say put it in the rod holder, no, she puts it down against the side of the boat, and wham! gets a hit on it, and it breaks the rod tip right off!(insert expletive here).Another one. A couple of years ago, my wife and I were enjoying a leisurly Sunday, casting for some Bass. She throws up into shore, and her lure goes right into a tree. So, ok, I motor up there, put her right where she can get her lure out of the tree, and a snake falls out of the tree, right behind her shoulder into the bottom of the boat. (a copper head). I say ""hunny, just turn around real easy like and sit down in the seat, and go ahead and get your lure, and then we'll see about losing this snake. Well, she starts looking at the water like she might like that better, but decides against jumping in. She got her lure out and we went back to the dock, there was a guy there with some of those long handle hook remover pliers, he reached in and grabbed the snake and threw it out into the water. The next Sunday we saw those same guys and they wanted to know if we had any copper heads in our boat today. Sorry for the extra long post. Looking back, it seems kinda comical now.Goldman"
1083611,Pooch,2009-02-25 11:05:00,4619,"Scott, My wife is absolutely terrified of snakes. It doesn't matter if they are alive or long dead, she just comes unglued. About ten years ago on a fly in the plane drops us off at the dock and there on the dock is the biggest d*** black snake I've ever seen. She didn't see it until we were unloaded when it made a run for the water. If the snake hadn't been in the water I think she would have made a dive to catch up with the float plane. Had my wife been in your boat with a snake she would have exited the boat no matter that she can't swim a lick. Good story. Pooch"

However, one day I was setting out some planer boards off the back of the boat and my 100 pound yellow lab came running back and was trying to jump off the back of the boat (something he has never done) just when I asked him what the heck he was thinking I got a whiff of something that would curl your nose hairs. I turned around and there on the bow deck was a dog rocket. (hes never done that before either) I calmly told the dog that it was o.k. (I quess I should have paid more attention but hey, Im fishing) and since I dont keep a flat shovel in the boat I used the cover of my lowrance unit to scoop away the unmentionable items. Later the boat got a good pressure washing and total detail so I would be ready for the popcorn and chips that no longer bother me on the floor of my boat, Ill take them any day."

If I could think of anything that maybe annoys me while fishing, maybe it would be steering the boat back to get someone unsnagged, and they get off 1/2 way back, but think I am watching them like a hawk and don't think to let me know they are free. Along the same ""line"", maybe, it would be a boat mate using other than a visible line, so I have no idea where the heck the snag is. It's still better than a good day anywhere else, Bill Krejca"
1082048,2Labs,2009-02-18 18:15:00,685,"Well, all my peeves have been mentioned. Except one ... and this one is just frustrating as heck because there is nothing I can do about it.FREAKING HIGH WINDS!!!!!!!!!Not the 10 or 15 or even 20 mph wind. But wind so bad I can't keep my 80# 60-inch trolling motor in the water -- 25, 30, 35 mph winds. Last year the wind was so bad for our July LOW trip I bent the latch pin on the 80# motor as the prop would cavitate and then dig, cavitate, and dig. Very tight sine curve on those waves! Incredible strain on that MinnKota! Usually I can cope by using that big TM or firing up the kicker ... but not last year. With the kicker we just got the snot beat out of us ramming waves. And that was nearly every day of that 2-week trip. GRRRRRRRRRRR!I finally gave in and started looking for fish in sheltered spots. First time I have ever done that in 27 trips."

1082187,Catcrazy3,2009-02-19 11:42:00,146,My biggest irritant is at the landings: people who can't wait their turn to get in/out of the water when other are also waiting OR the idiots at the double landings that pull into the middle so no one else can land/launch

1082821,way2goofy,2009-02-22 10:28:00,22,Wind bothers me the most. I'd rather fish in the rain than have a strong wind to fight while fishing. Many times you can go to a sheltered bay but if you are trying to hold on a reef in open water it's tough.
1082831,Guest,2009-02-22 11:26:00,0,I don't like jet skiers that buzz boats and cottages. I had the experience a few years back at our cottage in NW Ontario. I had to pur up with a pair of them buzzing our dock and being PITA. Finally peace and quiet. We went fishing a little later and I found them miles up our lake out of fuel. I could not leave them for the wolves and bears to get so I towed them back. I did not even get so much as a thank you. They were from the city with a pair of rented machines.
1082983,Bigfishhunter,2009-02-23 07:15:00,803,"You are way too nice a guy Limitter. I would have made them sit right beside me in the boat all the way back and given them an earful all the way home. If they would not have said a thank you - ooh boy I don't know how I would react, I am sure I could hold back on the violence but I am sure they would learn their lesson that is for sure. Like my uncle always used to say - too bad we couldn't carry the .357 - three below the water line sure doesn't let them get very far."
1083172,Fishin Fun,2009-02-23 19:28:00,218,What irritates me is the fact that it takes 12 hours of driving to get to my fishing spot and I can't stand to wait that long! Otherwise fishing in a cold rain I hate.
1083294,wolverine fan,2009-02-24 09:57:00,71,"What really gets me is when you slowly, quietly, stealthily motor into the most awesome spot and....your first cast misses by 12 feet!! or the lure gets hung up on the tiniest little branch overlooking that perfect spot if it would just fall.............nope-wraps around the finger sized branch and come to find out the branch is stronger than schwartzenegger!! pull till you know it has to come loose or break and thats about the time it zings right at you and your partners (who were not paying attention ) and the trebles now look like the anchor racing towards you!! the last one has to be when you have a great spot to throw to and that little piece of weed will not come off the lure..and you are sure you'll never catch a fish if its stayson there but you are not gonna bring it up to your hands until youve done all you can by slapping it on the surface, jiggging rod tip up and down a zillion times, faster and faster, swear at the lure, jerk it quickly thru the water wondering if this happens to anyone else but you!! HAHA those are some of the things that bother me!!"

For years we have fished lakes with camp boats, and continue to to this day. These boats have no sonar unless we bring it and no bow mount trolling motor. My biggest problem is knowing how to fish a spot and being unable to do so due to weather and boat constraints. I have been trying to focus more on what is possible but the mind will wonder"
1081950,Pooch,2009-02-18 10:22:00,4619,"When we fished some of the drive in lakes we took along our own trolling motors. Decided that with a 9.9 or 15hp motor that it was unnecessary. Most small camp boats with smaller motors really back troll nice. The weakness is not having some kind of splash guards when moving into the wind. I learned from others and through experience that fighting the wind will only frustrate you. After learning to use the wind and feel the boat in the wind, I now love to fish the wind. Then again we are mostly troller's and a good drift over a reef using the wind is a delight. Reading the wind and understanding how it is going to turn the boat are key. Last fall I had the opportunity to fish with a new group using their boats with consoles. Really nice boats. It was tough if not impossible to back troll for the driver. They mostly anchored and jigged. Some drifting too. There were a couple days I would have loved to have had a tiller on that trip and worked the wind. They were good at working the wind at anchor and were top shelf jig fishermen. Stay flexible and maximize the great maneuverability of those camp boats. Pooch"

He has a great boat but throws it in the hole so hard he tosses his wife and anyone else back into the motor well or outa the boat. He uses the trolling motor backwards on the highest setting and is often seen running in circles. The b#stard always catches the biggest fish. geez."

There isn't anyplace in the lake that you can't catch fish for crying out loud!! It speaks in general of the breakdown in civility within our society. A selfishness that carries over to our fishing. Nobody is that ignorant or are they? I'll tell you what else bothers me when fishing.

People who aren't catching fish running right over the hole you are fishing when there are miles of water on the other side of the boat much deeper and safer to drive through. Happens at least once a trip not just in Canada but in Devils Lake ND too. Musky interupting perfectly good walleye fishing. Northern interupting perfectly good walleye fishing. Smallmouth interupting perfectly good walleye fishing... actually I like that. Bear interupting perfectly good walleye fishing.
