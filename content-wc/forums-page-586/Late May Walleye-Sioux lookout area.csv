I have been fishing Sioux Lookout(minnitaki, lac seul) for about 10 years now and am bringing a buddy of mine up for the first time. I thought I was a fishing fanatic, but this guy is nuts, and he's NEVER been to Canada fishing. So, my question is... I have never been up there before June 15th and this year the only time we can get away together is over Memorial Day weekend, is this to early for good fishing? The dates will be Friday May 22-Wed. 27th. I'm sure the lake trout fishing will be awesome that time of year because they'll be shallower, but were after walleyes. The sanctuaries will be closed, but we dont fish those at all anyway, spend most of our time in NE Bay fishing various spots. I'm just scared the fish will be in a total postspawn negative mood and we'll struggle to catch walleyes. I'm sure we'll have to use techniques like we used in June before, fishing shallower in emerging weeds and away from the 20-30' humps we fish in Aug and Sep, but I'd like someones opinion on the matter. Thanks a bunch guys! Blake"

That lake is very good early but after June 1st it seems like Minnitaki gets hot. I have also been in Aug/Sept and we never fish in Abrams. Some of the spots we found good were at the mouth of the river that comes into Abrams(Sturgeon?), below Abrams chute and also above and below Frog Rapids. Alot of people take the long run to the falls on the far east end of Botsford Lake. We have ventured into Minnitaki that early and had good luck in Alcona Bay in the shallows-I think there are 3 creeks that drain in the bay and I have heard the bay they call the doughnut is good early. Where are you staying at? If you got any questions send me an email."

1087857,bad fisherman,2009-03-14 05:43:00,13,try across from the falls on pickerel arm. there is a good weed bed there and it is also a post spawn hangout
1087867,prov1900,2009-03-14 06:36:00,544,We fished that time of year in 08. We had no problems finding walleyes. You will do fine whereever you go.
