There is only one lodge on the lake, but near a dozen ""private"" cabins owned mainly by Iowans who ""lend"" them out to their friends on a weekly basis. By lease and law, they cannot rent out these cabins, but friends can volunteer improvement funds to the owners. If your looking for a smaller body of water with decent fishing, this will do. CCC"

The previous owner Brian handed over to reigns to his daughter (Gretchen) and son-in-law (Dave) and they do a great job running the camp. The boats and cabins are well kept and the fishing is very good which seems to keep the same guests coming back year after year. Wenasaga is a super easy lake to fish if you are targeting walleye. The two most popular places seem to be the upper and lower falls. The upper falls is a huge waterfall flowing in from a lake whose name I can't recall at the moment for the life of me. While the fish tend to be on the smaller side at the upper falls, the seclusion and number you will catch make for a fun time. My preferred tactic is to go with an ultra-light with 4 or 6 pound test and cast a 1/8 minnow or leach tipped jig up into the current. By the time your jig gets down stream you will more than likely have a fish. A few hints about the upper falls: If the water level is low you will not be able to make the run up the river as there is one tricky spot right before the falls. This has only been the case one year for us. Plan to be the first one up there - there is not a whole lot of room up there and it is a 4 mile run up river so if you get there before everyone else you can enjoy the tranquility of being away from it all. Don't be surprised it you catch a nice northern while bringing in a walleye - seems to happen there once every trip. There is a shallower sandy area to the right of the falls that is great for anchoring. While your fish finder will say 2 feet the left side of your boat will be in deeper water. Finally, watch the sky as the tall trees make it tough to see incoming storms. We got caught up there for a wild thunderstorm which was a bit scary at the time but made for some great laughs once we were out of harms way. The lower falls, which empties into a river that eventually makes it way to Lac Seul, produces great numbers and fish that tend to be on the larger side compared to the upper falls. This seems to be the most popular spot and it's not uncommon to see a handful of boats from the camp anchored here. Most boats seem to head to the left of the falls as it's easy to anchor but the right side will produce larger fish. I have a few other favorite spots on the lake but I'll let you discover those on you own. If you're like me, after catching fish non-stop at the upper and lower falls you'll want to challenge yourself to find some spots that do not receive nearly as much attention. Find one and you'll likely be rewarded with nicer sized fish. I have read some comments in past threads about 'the Iowans' who own the handful of private cabins on this lake. We normally make our trip in later June or early July and the greatest number of non-camp boats we have ever seen on the lake in a given day is three so we've never experienced any crowding. As the previous poster mentioned, it's a healthy walleye fishery with great numbers and good size. The northern fishing is tough but they do keep a boat on a catch-and-release portage lake that is loaded with pike if you want to get you fill. We have also landed some very nice walleye on this portage lake while targeting pike. I'd suggest silver minnows (with or without trailer) with the barbed pinched for easy release. OP, you will have a great time on Wenasaga. Tons of nice sized walleye on a smaller body of water and a great northern portage lake keep us coming back."
