520446,Guest,2002-05-18 06:49:00,0,"I am heading to Canada for the first time ever. We're fishing with Cobblestone Lodge Outfitters located in Ignace,ON. Here are my questions for anyone that is more experienced that I when it comes to traveling into Canada.1. Worms need to cross the border in paper not dirt, at least that is what I am told. Should I purchase them in the US or wait until we get to Canada?2. Can I bring leechs across the border? If not, can I pick them up in Ignace, and does anyone know where in Ignace?3. Past experience on the bug hatch in late June? Is there one or is it earlier in June. I know you're not mother nature, but your past experience will help.4. We're driving along Lake Superior and then heading west once we cross into Canada - heading to Igance. We're staying over in Duluth,MN the night before we check in. Does anyone recommend an inexpensive hotel to stay and where in Duluth?Thanks for the help ahead of time.Tight lines ----"

Castle baits on the right as you come into town from the east. You can buy a flat of crawlers there, probably around 55 bucks U.S.. Have never stayed in Duluth, I have stayed along lake shore drive just south of Grand Marias, there are plenty of places to stay, from Duluth, to the border. Have a great trip, I love it up there."
520448,Behle,2002-05-20 05:52:00,51,Yes worms must be bedding that is not dirt. We use buss bedding.You can not bring in leeches and they can be purchased at the place mentioned before. There are a lot of places to stay from Duluth on. The ones out of Duluth along the North Shore are mixtures of resort type places and small motels. If looking for a great place to eat I recommend the Northern Lights restaurant in Beaver Bay. After a week in the bush the food is great and there are usually a couple of cute servers that have pretty smiles.

Good news is that they didn't bother us once we got out on the water, but launching the boats was the fastest I ever did it in order to be kept from being eaten alive! Great up there otherwise!"
520450,Xplorer,2002-05-21 09:08:00,244,Since your coming up the interstate in to Duluth the easiest place may be the motel 6 right at the 27th St off-ramp. 218-723-1123 or 800-4mo-tel6. Easy off and easy on. Theres also a gas station and place to eat right there.Xplorer
520451,Wenty,2002-05-22 11:43:00,15,"Tight Lines S.D.#1 Buy your crawlers in the States.#2 Leeches must be bought in Canada.#3 Bug hacthes. I'm not sure what species you're speaking of, but bugs last May long weekend Opener were non-existant. Then agian the temperature was like 1 degree celsius. If you're worried about a May fly hatch, I wouldn't. I think it will run late this year, more like early to mid July, and secondly, I've never really seen it affect the fishing.#4 Motels in Duluth. I would recommend the Edgewater facilities on London Road (Hwy 61) 218-728-3601 or a cheaper set up would be the Chalet also on London Road 1-800 235-2957. It's tourist season in Duluth so rooms can be tough to get. You might also consider staying in Two Harbors. I think there's a Country Inn and Suites. All are right on your rout to Canada. Enjoy your trip."
520452,Guest,2002-05-22 18:34:00,0,"There are two places to get bait in Ignace, Vern's Minnows and also Castle Baits. They also sell fishing maps of the area, but if you want one ahead of time you can find them at this website www.fishingandhuntingmaps.com Good luck fishing!"
520453,Guest,2002-05-29 08:47:00,0,"Beware of getting your trailer, boat, motor, things in your boat or all the above ripped off at night from the parking lot. Seems thievesare always about. One morning we woke up and the cops were talking to some sports who had the whole rig taken. Another time a set of friends from WI had all the stuff from their boat taken on their way up to Canada--theyhad to return home for more stuff and came back the following week.Take along salted minnows and salted ciscos--no smelt in any manner.I prefer Verns Baits at Ignace. Better advice from the owner--not kids as at Castle across the road.Never fopund a good place to eat in Duluth. We stop at G Marais at South of the Border Cafe(SOB) for breakfast. And at the Ignace truck stop on the far east end--lot for cheap."
