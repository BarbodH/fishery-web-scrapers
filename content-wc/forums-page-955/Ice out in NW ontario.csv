518831,Guest,2002-05-18 20:15:00,0,Lac seul at Ear Falls is open and going strong.Great fishing close to camps. If your stuck and can't get into a camp north give on of the camps a call
518832,lobo1,2002-05-18 20:22:00,734,"Thanks Pat,Will give it some thought. I have one last hope at a fly-in that the guys really like and will find out on Mon if we can get in. This weather certainly isn't melting much ice but where we're trying to get in does have a pretty good current running through it. I'm hopeful but not optimistic. If we can't get in - it's time to scramble OR plan for September.lobo"
518836,duffy,2002-05-23 13:46:00,49,Any updates? Thanks.duffy
518837,Guest,2002-05-23 14:37:00,0,the guy on http://www.justfishontario.com/reports.htm just posted a good report from Silver Water Wheel lodge and says the ice is mostly out and should be out totally by tomorrow. they been getting good eyes and northerns.
518838,Guest,2002-05-26 09:32:00,0,"Ice is almost out on Trout Lake. Just got back from a week at Booi's. We missed our first day, spending it in Red Lake waiting to get to the island. The following days the ice melted gradually. At this point the main basin is still iced in but you can almost get to the north end of Cat Island. All the northeast bays are open as well as everything to the south and east of Cat Island. Ice is breaking off the main piece however and does blow around so be careful if your heading to a Trout Lake lodge. A few more good thawing days and you'll see most of the ice gone.Red Lake still had ice as well when we flew out yesterday. I didn't see how much was left but the bay that Red Lake Airlines is located at is all open now without hindering fly-outs or ins."
518839,Guest,2002-05-27 13:43:00,0,"Todd,How was the fishing on Trout lake?"
518840,Guest,2002-05-30 10:46:00,0,"Has anyone heard the ice conditions on Nungesser Lake? I would think it would have broke by now, but it's been a crazy year. Any fishing reports???? Thanks."
518841,duffy,2002-05-30 11:54:00,49,Ice is out as far north as 135 north of red lake. I am sure nungesser is out.

518827,Guest,2002-05-16 04:24:00,0,"Sounds like the ice will be out on Trout Lake by Saturday sometime. It looks like we're planning on heading up to Booi's very early Saturday morning and hope to actually get some fishing in on Saturday night. *crosses fingers*Any info anyone has on the Red Lake, Trout Lake area would be appreciated"

518829,Trailerguy,2002-05-16 20:03:00,1407,"I just got off the phone with an outfitter at Perrault Falls. He says the smaller lakes opened up last week, with Cliff Lake just yesterday. Perrault and Wabaskang are still iced. One campowner hasn't been able to get across Wabaskang to get in yet. He says some outfitters north of Red Lake are calling guests to cancel the opening weekend, 12"" of snow still in the bush up there. Very little has melted this week. Night time temps. about 20 degrees. The forcast is warmer next week. If you plan to go up you better check your lake out!"
518830,lobo1,2002-05-16 20:15:00,734,I've been cancelled and wasn't supposed to fly until next thursday.lobo
518833,Guest,2002-05-17 05:29:00,0,"Yeah, it appears that there are many factors that go into whether a lake is shedding its ice. There are reports of lakes pretty far north that are melting or melted while some southern lakes are just starting. One good source of information is the Ontario Provincial Police. They do the fly-overs for enforcement purposes and have a good idea what things look like on a daily basis.Trout Lake is open from Booi's island to Cat Island apparently and we're hopeful that it will be open Saturday late. Its more likely Sunday sometime however. Heading up to Red Lake tomorrow early to be prepared here.Anyone have any good fishing holes to suggest if we are delayed in getting into our fly-in at Booi's around the Red Lake area that would be open?"
518826,Howard,2002-05-18 07:53:00,33,"You did not get in neither did my group of 12Looks like next week. Ice still in at Balmer, no planes flying as of the 17th. Bring at double bladed ax, You will need it"
518834,Howard,2002-05-18 08:04:00,33,"Talk to ""Sandy Beach"" yesterday, all iced up. They hope to get into Otto Lake by the river. North is iceNext week should be ok for the south end around Boois."
518835,Karl,2002-05-18 14:46:00,63,"Just got back from Sioux Lookout last night. Lost Lake still had ice, but gone from Minnitaki, Pelican and Vermillion (Big & Little). Camp had to cancel flights to Faucett, Blackstone and Springpole though (basically everything north of Sioux Lookout).I got up there last monday and only small areas and bays were open, and by friday it was all gone, so it's going quick. Fishing was excellent for northern and lake trout, especially when it was snowing."
518814,duffy,2002-05-10 03:53:00,49,"Red laker,i started going up there when Kevin and Debra owned the place 6 years ago. I have been going back ever since because the fishing for trophy pike, walleyes, and lake trout is great. It's intersting to see how the place has changed for the better for the last 6 years and two owners. Last year me and my buddy caught and released 18 pike between 38"" and 46"". Two of those lakes are world class pike fisheries. Three of the five lakes we fish have great walleye and good size fish not just eaters. The trout fishing in spring and fall is unbelieveable for fish from 3 to 15 pounds. Thanks again for the updates. i spoke to Kevin last night and he mentioned that little vermillion is still covered pretty good with white ice but they were thinking (Brett and Kevin) of helicoptering in this weekend as they are booked with guests on Saturday."
518815,Guest,2002-05-10 07:00:00,0,"For those of ypu worried about ice in the Lac Seul area; I thought that I would give you the skinny. Ice here at Ear Falls is getting better by the day, real great melting forecast for the week end and next week.We've got open water to the Wenesagaga river and out on the lake to Goose Island. Opener will provide plenty of walleye dinners; we'll need to be careful of the big females full of spawn - let's let them go.We may have a few ice cubes in some of the big back bays , but that will go fast. Keep your dobbers up and bobbers ready!"
518816,Guest,2002-05-10 12:21:00,0,Do you have an e-mail. i would like to talk to you.
518817,lobo1,2002-05-11 13:03:00,734,"Sean,I don't think you have too much to worry about but my trip is in serious jeopardy. My guy called today to say there is still a foot and half of ice. The May 23rd flight will need some serious warm weather, unfortunately, I don't seee any coming. Looks like I may get that fall trip I've been thinking about.Steve"
518818,duffy,2002-05-11 16:08:00,49,"Steve,That sucks. i hope all will work out for you. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise as I am not worried about the ice for my trip but i am worried about very cold weather since the ice will only be out for a week or two. Snow in June again!!!!! i hope not. Good luck and i will let you know it goes and you do the same. Good luckSean"
518819,AL,2002-05-11 18:49:00,89,"Duffy,Where are you going that you're not worried about? I'm heading to Armstrong for the opener on a fly-in. I can't get any reply's on the ice conditions there. My outfitter won't check out the situation until Tuesday. I worried we may be canceled.Al"
518820,Guest,2002-05-12 06:06:00,0,"Al,I am going north of red lake about 135 miles on a fly in to way north lodge. I am not too worried becasue i don't leave until June 7th. Ice should be out by then (it better be). Good luck with your trip. Where are you heading?"
518821,lobo1,2002-05-12 06:24:00,734,"Al,The water I am going to is on the Winisk River system where it bulges into what looks like a large lake approx 150 NNE of Armstrong. If you have a decent Ont map it is about 40 miles west of Webequie. Anyhow he said the ice was NOT suitable for ice fishing or travel but was still 18"" in spots and mostly in tact. This should give you a rough idea on your camp.lobo"
518822,AL,2002-05-12 07:25:00,89,"Duffy,I'm heading out of Armstrong with Mattice Lake. About 98 miles North to Weese Lake. I'll give you an update when I return."

518804,Guest,2002-05-06 19:04:00,0,Nothing???Come on... it was 85 degrees here today and muggy. then again I'm 870 miles south of Ear Falls. Is the English River open below the Ear Falls Dam? Never fished the river...any good early in the season??
518805,redlaker,2002-05-07 04:36:00,0,Hey mp3553 if it dosen't warm up the dam will be the spot. But can you say Bumper Boats. Put a lot rubber around your boat.Hey Duffy where you fishin at up here? I'll see if I can get some more info for you I know alot of the camp owners.
518808,Guest,2002-05-07 04:51:00,0,"Talked to a lodge owner yesterday on the Lake of the Woods and he said the ice was out in his bay. Bays and current areas are the first to go. I think the ice will be out on the Woods, Lac Seul, Eagle, Rainy and many lodges in that part. The far north, who knows. Red Lake is a guess. Check with lodge owners.Just Fish"
518809,Guest,2002-05-07 05:37:00,0,I think anyone on a river system should be fine! Anything red lake south should be fine! Its the lakes 100-200 miles north of red lake that maybe in question. If it stays cold people at least hope for a 30 mph north west wind that will do the trick also.
518806,duffy,2002-05-07 18:24:00,49,Red lakerI am going to way north camp is which is a fly in 135 miles north of red lake. kevin Geary used to own it now it's owned by Bob korzinski who owns red lake airways. I fly in june 7th to the 14th. Thanks again for all of your help

518811,Walleye Wacker,2002-05-09 06:35:00,6,We flew yesterday up to about 200 miles North of Ear falls on our annual spring lake check. It seems that iceout is a little behind normal and snow cover about normal. We always cover a wide area and it is a fun trip to start the season out with.
518812,Guest,2002-05-09 06:53:00,0,"I spoke to mike Weaver, Weaver wilderness camp, on gullrock, last night. he didn't seem real worried about ice for the opener. The bay by his fish house is starting to open. he did mention that if the temp dropped last night they could get 10 inches of new snow.If you need a great camp. check out Weavers."
518813,redlaker,2002-05-09 18:48:00,0,Hey john I think Mike was pulling our leg I was at his camp two days ago didn't see any moving water on Gullrock the only place I can see opening is at the Bug river in front of five lakes lodge but that's all I can see from the road. As I said before Gullrock should open soon the ice is bad. The bad news is it snowed 6in. and is colder than #### right Now!!Hey Duffy I know Bob and Connie pretty good how's the fishing up there at way north I remember when Kevin & Debra got the place but they didn't have it long.
518795,Guest,2002-05-03 04:44:00,0,"Redlaker, any idea how much sooner Packwash Lake ice goes out than Gullrock??"
518796,redlaker,2002-05-03 05:57:00,0,I don't see much difference in time there only 20mi. apart. I didn't fish Pakwash this winter don't know how thick the ice was. The ice is not doing to much right now. It is still below freezing at night and not much warmer during the day. I'll see a camp owner from Pakwash tonight I'll ask him what he thinks.
518790,redlaker,2002-05-03 06:03:00,0,RK I think I'd call the camp owner and see what he thinks Red Lake won't be off by the 10th and Nungessor is 40mi.north
518797,Guest,2002-05-03 16:38:00,0,Thanks for the reply.More questions> Is there a good pulic access onGullRock?? We will be at Packwash the week of May 25-June 1st and were thinking it would be fun to visit GullRock if there is.Is there a good Lake Trout lake around with access?I've heard there is Lake Trout in Red Lake but thinkit would be hard to find them on such a big lake.Do you guide or would you point us where to go on Red??Still staying with the May 10 ice out for GullRock??Thought Packwash would go out sooner because it's shallower.Any info would be appreciated. If you want to go fishing with us on Red for Lakers we'll pick you up around the 30th or 31st.Have had great Walleye fishing on Packwash the last 8 years but would be fun to see new water.

518798,redlaker,2002-05-04 06:49:00,0,Hey Bruce the boat ramp on Gullrock is controled by the camp owner Assoc. they charge a fee to use the ramp. They are very protective of the lake and imposes their own slot limit which they enforce. The laker fishing on Red Lake has gone down the last couple of years I go down to Cliff Lake for Lakers in the spring they are pretty easy to find. WE do not keep lakers on Red Lakes anymore.Good with the May 10th date.
518799,Guest,2002-05-04 11:47:00,0,"Just heard from Ear Falls, 43 miles NE Confederation lake is still frozen solid. Ice is white and all the way to shoreline. Nights have been too cold!

When the little lake frees up...the big lakes are two weeks behind. It has not let me down for twenty years. Now the little lake is still frozen solid. I will extend my estimate to May 12th for complete ice out. I'll put a case of beer on it...any takers.
518775,smrainy,2002-04-20 21:20:00,4,"It's april 20th and there is still ice on rainy. Lots, but bad ice. I predict May 6th for north arm. depending on weather. it is chilly tonight.
