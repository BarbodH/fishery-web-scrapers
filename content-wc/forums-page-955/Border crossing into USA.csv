520535,Dave,2002-05-21 13:47:00,258,I would like to know how the border crossing times might be coming back into th USA on Saturdays. Mainly these first few weeks of the season. Does most of the traffic go thru in the morning? Would it be better to cross at 4:00 pm or so. We would be going thru International Falls.

520538,Guest,2002-05-29 08:53:00,0,Pidgeon River or Int Falls crossing? Depends on where are you going?Avoid Int Falls if you can;Always a delay there if anywhere.Crossing the bridge takes money-same fee in US or CanadiaI never had any trouble or time delay at P. River.n
520539,Pannyraid,2002-05-29 10:21:00,3,Our group crossed at International Falls on Sat. May 25th at noon and there was no wait to get back into the US.
520540,fishmaster,2002-05-29 16:20:00,209,"Our group crossed over at International Falls on Friday before the openner and we crossed at about 4 PM and we had about a 10 minute wait and 5 minute wait for them to check one of our trucks out and then they sent us on our way. Coming back we had about a 15 minute wait and we thought they were a little crabby coming back into the US and they again searched one of our trucks that was about 1/2 hour and they then sent us on our way.Good luck just don't try to sneak anything in just in case it is not worth it. We allways follow the rules and we usually get one of our trucks checked for some odd reason, but if there nice to you who cares they are just doing there job to protect us.fishmaster"
520541,Guest,2002-05-29 18:18:00,0,How much beer can you bring back into the States?
520542,SWeed,2002-05-30 01:20:00,66,"I came through there on Thursday before Memorial Day weekend. About 4 in the afternoon no wait no hassle. Had I.D.'s ready, As for beer One case per person of legal age..... I was surprised by the $10 bridge charge on the way in the week before.... Nice Bridge.... Went up to Gull Rock for the opener and ended up watching the ice melt...."
