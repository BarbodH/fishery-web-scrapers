""YET"" I now have my dock in the water but the boat lift still needs work. We will be heading out this weekend, drop in for a cold one if you're in the area. I am on the west side across from Mullock's point. Look for a set of caribou antlers on the boat house. I will be putting them up Friday evening. Don't have many stories to tell yet but would love to hear some.Look forward to meeting you.Le pic"
