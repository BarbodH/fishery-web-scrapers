520912,Guest,2002-05-30 11:52:00,0,"I crossed last week about 10:30 pm, only 1 lane open. The young ladyasked where we were going,were we leaving anthing in Canada? I handed her my list and my POL (purchase and aquisition license for firarms), She immediatly got flustered. I then handed her the registration card for the single shot .410 I'm taking to camp. She stammered around asking me about the gun, went inside to her supervisor who shurgged his shoulders at her, she nearly threw the paper work back at me and told me to have a nice trip. She didn't even collect the tax on the goods I was leaving in Canada. That's the quickest I ever got through, having a POL to show them is definatly worth the $$. They can ask for both a drivers license and your birth certificate if they want too."
