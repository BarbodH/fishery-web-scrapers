If you are going through Saskatoon, that's your best bet.Actually, around here, leeches by the pound are not common. That being said, try the Fishin' Hole in Saskatoon. Their shipment comes in every Thursday, and they normally sell them in 12's and 36's, size is dependent on what's available.Give them a call, and see if they will order a pound in for you when you are coming through. The number is 306-665-7223. If this doesn't work out, post again, and we'll come up with something different.Good luck,derrek.Just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get me."
