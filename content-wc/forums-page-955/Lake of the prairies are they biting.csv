520835,undertaker,2002-05-30 10:05:00,1,"ya they are suprisingly.lots of walleye over the slot size and some over 28"".the spawn was very late and alot of the fish are still around togo bridge and roblin 1/8 - 1/4 oz jig/small black twister tail casted from shore will do the trick,yellow ,and green work to.if your in the derby getting slot fish will be the hardest thing.the saskatchewan walleye chase down the river this year yeilded alot of huge fish and for the first week of the manitoba season the same held true in lop though the bite has slowed the fishing is still good if its big fish your after.the water is low and still pretty cold for this time of year so the fish ain't that deep at least they weren't yesterday caught a couple in 3'of water off shore the netting i think has taken ALOT of the slot fish but the lake is still producing."
