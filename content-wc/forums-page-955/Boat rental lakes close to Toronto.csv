There are a couple of camps with cabins and boat and motor rentals there. We stayed at Little's Cottages. Talk to Percy. Directions are (I think) 401 East to Rt 7 North. Follow 7 north through Peterborough to Lakefield. Go through Lakefield and turn East on CR 28(?) about 10 miles to the lake. Good luck.Tim"
