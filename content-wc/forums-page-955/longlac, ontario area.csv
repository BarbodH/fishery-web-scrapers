520783,Guest,2002-05-28 06:54:00,0,Going to Flint Wilderness Resort on Klontz lake first week in June. Any info would from a person that has fished the same lake would be appreciated!
520784,Fishoil,2002-05-28 08:11:00,1277,"I think it's actually Klotz Lake. I've never fished it, but I have fished many others in the area. I think the camp you're staying at has boats on Fernow and maybe Chipman. I'd recommend both of them if you're going to try other lakes."
520785,Guest,2002-05-28 10:18:00,0,"I stand corrected, it is Klotz Lake, and there are 11 other lakes the resort has for you to fish. Thanh you for the info on the other lakes."
520786,Fishoil,2002-05-29 05:39:00,1277,Are you planning to fish any of the other lakes? I've fished about 15 other lakes in the Longlac area. We used to go to a camp on Lukinto Lake and travel to other lakes & rivers to fish. I'd be glad to help you out if I can.
520787,Guest,2002-05-29 05:54:00,0,"I know we will be fishing Klotz,Flint and Kissimee. The rest of the trip is up in the air, and depending on the bite on these lakes."
520788,Fishoil,2002-05-29 10:27:00,1277,"Sorry, can't help you out. I've never fished those three."
520789,Guest,2002-05-30 07:34:00,0,"Fishoil,I'm leaving for Longlac in the morning (May 31st)!! Can't wait. Plan on fishing both Fernow & Chipman as well as Long Lake, McLeod, and maybe a couple of others. If you have any suggestions for Fernow or Chipman, I'd appreciate it. Last year it was just too windy (out of the north) to fish those two. You can e-mail me at [email protected]Thanks"
