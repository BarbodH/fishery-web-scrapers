520748,fishmaster,2002-05-29 12:51:00,209,You might want to gas up in International Falls and if you can avoid eating on the Canada side try to or else we stay at the Rend. on Rainy Lake and they have good food other places we have tried for lunch and that are not that great.Bait you can get at bait shop along the lake on Hwy.But then again you might want get bait closer to destination. Good Luck
520749,Guest,2002-05-29 18:25:00,0,"As far as bait, just remember you can not take leeches or minnows into Canada. Plus worms can not be in dirt, we use buss bedding and bring them from home.I usually gas up on the south side of International Falls on the left (going to the Falls). It is on a curve and it is a good place if you are towing a boat. Sorry I can not remember the name of it.Good luck,fritz"

When I drove up two weeks ago, gas was 1.49 all through Wisconsin. As soon as I crossed into Minn., it was 1.39 a gallon. At Intl. Falls, it jumped to 1.44 a gallon. As for groceries, the SafeWay stores in Ft. Frances and in Dryden are the best for selection and price (if you pay in Canadian dollars). Wait until you get to a Canadian bank or credit union to convert dollars. U.S. banks will give you about C$144 per US$100 plus charge a ""fee"". Canadian banks use the international conversion rate advertised on the internet - C$152 per US$100 and no ""fee"". The last time I went to a bank in Intl. Falls (the one nearest the bridge) they offered me C$128 - they're not real finicky about stealing your money."
