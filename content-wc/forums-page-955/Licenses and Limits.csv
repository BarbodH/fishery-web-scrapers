520897,Guest,2002-05-30 08:20:00,0,"If your son is fishing on your license, any fish he keeps count towards your limit. Any fish you (and he) eat during shore lunch also count toward your daily limit.If you need more fish, buy him a license. Better yet, throw them all back except for some for lunch and dinner; they never taste as good as on the lake. Catch and release on barbless hooks. Have a gret trip. Terry"
