520845,Guest,2002-05-29 09:38:00,0,Hey guys....I can't remember the last time I did much slip bobber fishing but with the cold weather I am preparing to do some in the shallow water for Walleyes. Couple of questions:#1....Bobber stops. How do you get'em on the line? How deep do you set the hook/Jig? Let's say I've found walleyes in 7-8 feet of water on a reef. Do I want to set the bobber slightly deeper the 7-8 or shallower? How long should I let the fish take it before setting the hook? Do walleyes do the Lake Trout thing of grabbing food...swimming several meters and then switching the minnow in their mouth or should I just set the hook when I tighten up on the line?#2. Should I use jigs or plain hooks with minnows when slip bobbering?#3. Line/Hook Regs. If I have a slip bobber out with a jig can I still cast jigs or plugs with a second line?Thank in advance for the help!Bob
520846,VMS,2002-05-29 09:54:00,1103,"Here is what I do.First, you will need some bobber stops. usually, they include a bunch of little tubes with string tied around them. Put your line through the tube, slide up a ways, then work the line off the tube, with the tube going toward the end of the line and not up toward the rod tip. Once the string is off the tube, tighten the string, cut ends off a bit.Next, you should also have a bunch of beads with holes in them. slide one on, then your slip bobber. Add an egg sinker heavy enough to just keep the bobber above the water..almost to the point of neutral bouyancy, then a barrel or ball bearing swivel. Tie on a snell of maybe 18 inches or so. you can use colored hooks (suttle but good). You are set to adjust the bobber.To adjust the bobber setting, all you need to do is slide the string knot up or down the line. In 7 - 8 feet of water, I would adjust the snell to be anywhere from 10 - 18 inches above the bottom. A lead depth guage (like they use for ice fishing) does really well to set the depth of the bobber.Leeches work really well with slip bobbers (at least in my experience). Any wave action will help a little, but the bobber, being almost neutrally bouyant, may slide under a wave here and there. The reason for the almost neutral bouyancy is so that the fish cannot ""feel"" the bobber as it grabs the bait. It also helps with suttle hits.Let the fish take the bobber under, reel in any slack, and Hit-em....all there is to it. If the bobber goes under, the fish has the bait. No need to wait.Steve"
520847,Walleye Wacker,2002-05-29 12:14:00,6,I dont slip bobber fish very often but it is a great way to catch Walleye in shallow water. I use a 1/8 oz jig with a Leech normally. I place a rubber band in my line to stop the bobber and this seems to work and it is a simple rig....I like to let the bobber float in from deep to shallow with the aid of a inshore wind. This allows me to adjust the bobber at the spot of the drift that is most productive. I fish this system with a open bail but I keep the line taunt and let it drift into shallow water. Strikes can be subtle so I sometimes feel the strike in my fingers prior to the bobber actually moving. I delay the hook set and make sure I have picked up any slack before useing a sweep set. I like a longer rod for better hook sets(7ft)....Good Luck...catch and release
