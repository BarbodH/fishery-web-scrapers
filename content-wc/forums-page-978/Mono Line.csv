Have read about the super lines but have not used any of them. I think I will stay with mono this summer. Which mono line do you guys think is the best, mainly for jigging. Thanks"
517557,BD,2002-02-25 14:36:00,739,I like Maxima Chameleon. It's in Cabela's Master Catalog. 4 or 6 lb test should be all that you need for eyes. One of my old buddies used 2 lb test year round for jigging and brought in a couple of 10 lb eyes on it.

517559,RANGER,2002-02-26 17:17:00,4341,"XT in whatever lbs. you want. I use 6 to 8 lb, normally for all around fishing."
517560,Jigger1,2002-02-26 17:38:00,234,I also use Trilene XT (8lb) but the Maxima Chameleon line struck my interest and I might give it a try.

517563,Guest,2002-03-01 07:20:00,0,"I did a fly-in July of 2000 using 6lb fireline. Must say it was the best! My brothers all had mono - they had bite offs and lost alot of fish. I on the other hand lost none due to line. Pulled in a 36 inch pike while jigging with a 1/8 oz. jig. My younger brother who was with me could not get over the strength of the line. It almost straightened the hook before landing the fish (took a while). I am going back this July, and all my brothers have switched to fireline because of what they saw it could do. Just be prepared to change your style of fishing though. Set your drags loose and remember - no strecth!Have fun with it and you will land more fish!"
