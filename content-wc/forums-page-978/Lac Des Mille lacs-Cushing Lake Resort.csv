517517,Guest,2002-02-24 14:19:00,0,You are more protected at that of the lake. Lac can get pretty nasty sometimes.
517518,Wenty,2002-02-25 13:39:00,15,"Rich,You'll be more protected from the wind at this end of LDML. Although last year was the roughest that I've seen the lake over the past several years. Weather. You never know. Have you stayed at the Cushing Lake Resort before? The Thunderbird seems a lot nicer, for what it's worth."
517519,rollie,2002-02-25 15:50:00,4,We stayed at the Thunderbird last Aug. I really hope that he gets his act together or he won't be there long. It was a nice enough place but the guy didn't seem to pay too much attention to busness. Sometimes was out fishing when he should have been around camp. His wife did a great job. Just an opinion. Not starting anything. Will probably go back again. Nice Walleyes and good Pike. Weather was great.
517520,Wenty,2002-02-26 07:24:00,15,"Rollie,If he was out fishing in August, then it was his first time on the water. I was around there from mid May through mid July when the place is busy and the guy was working his ##### off. I thought the family did pretty well for first time resort owners. Just my thoughts."
517521,Guest,2002-02-26 11:05:00,0,I feel it is really important that the resort owner make sure the fish are biting first hand at least once a week. That way he can advise his customers with that knowledge. Checking the beer is important too. You have to make sure that its ok for your guests.
517522,Guest,2002-02-28 17:14:00,0,It's nice to hear about the Thunderbird and it's owners. Has anybody been to Cushing lake Resort and like to give their opinions? Thanks for all the replies.
