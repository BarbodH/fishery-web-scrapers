517497,Guest,2002-02-23 15:25:00,0,Hear that they have excellent musky and walleye. Anyone fish Rough Rock Lake north of Kenora?
517498,Reels,2002-02-23 19:22:00,2876,"Great body of water for walleye and muskie. Food is great at rough rock from what I hear. Cabins are clean, and the folks there are nice.Only drawback is you have to boat all your gear for a few miles, but at least your far from town and thats kinda nice.<{{}}><"

Stay @ a place near Minaki....like Paradise Cove (do it yerself plan) or Birch Island (pay o-too-much-plan) And still fish the same waters. Get a local guide for a day or 2. I suggest RTMG..... he is a semi-regular visitor to W.C.He is a great guy to be out on the water with (##### good stories)very knowledgable, great educator & even provides beverages. NOT your average guide..... works more than is required. In my experiences with him, he's become a (what I would hopefully call) a great friend.His love of the Minaki area cannot be beat . Don't want to sound like a advertizment or any thing, just trying to help you out. My advice to you., contact rtmg early. He only does about 3 trips each year. ( work schedule thing)"
517502,Guest,2002-03-02 02:02:00,0,"DUH. forgot RTMG's e mail address. [email protected] is where you can get him. My advice, don't get him for a day...go for 2. first day was kinda slow & searching for fish wasn't fun. second day ... WOW. what a day of fishing ! ! I would say, the best day I have ever had on the water. I FINALLY caught a walleye over 28 inches. (mine was 30.5)We managed to also catch over 75 fish in the slot range of up to 19 3/4 inches. We had a feast & also manged to get enough wrappers for home.All in all, Rob is a heck of a guide. Understands the word of ""hospitality""Heck, not everyday that a guide can get Gary Roaches endorsment"
