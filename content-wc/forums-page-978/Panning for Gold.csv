Has anyone panned while waiting for shore lunch???Is it true or is he laughing behind my back when my head is stuck in the sand with my shore lunch plate in hand???If so, is it worth taking a metal detector???Thanks for the info and please don't laugh too hard."

If you find a good gravel bed in a river you might try that. BUT.......most mineral rights for accessed areas have been purchased by large companies. Also if you do find some I think gold might be hard to get back across the border and may fall under the soil transport laws. I do know of a person who purchased a moderate piece of land. He wanted to put up a drive in lodge. He started bull dozing a parking lot and scraped the layer of duff and soil down to the bed rock. The whole area was veined in quartz. Later tests resulted in a large gold mine!!!!Roger Mayer."
