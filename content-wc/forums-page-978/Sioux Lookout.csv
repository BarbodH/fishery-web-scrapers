517582,WCoyote,2002-02-27 12:55:00,200,"Karl is right on about Lac Seul, the fishing and the rocks. You ain't never seen anything like Lac Seul when it comes to under water obsticles. I intended to use a guide one day and then go it alone from there on, which I have done for years all over LOW and others. By noon the first day I decided it was in my and my Pro V's best interest to retain the guide for the duration. It was a smart move, easy on the health of my boat and he put us on a lot of fish.Lac Seul is absolutly terrific, you'll have a great time, but be carful.As info: Anderson's Lodge does a nice job. Ask for a guide with first name Colin, he grew up fishing Lac Seul, knowledgible and fun to fish with.wea"
517583,Guest,2002-02-27 20:12:00,0,"hi darwin and all.we have fished the east end of lac seul for about 10 years.we always stay at Mahkwa Lodge which is about 40 minutes from hudson on a gravel road. this saves us the 40 plus minute daily boat ride that most sioux lookout trips take to get onto the plentiful walleye.one of our hottest spots is about 5 minutes from the cabins but we always seem to believe the fish are more plentiful further up or down the lake. one drawback i have is the missing lake trout. they just aren't down there. unless someone knows where and can tell me.Ya might want to try www.lostislandlodge.com located on Lost Lake.they do guide trips and the lodge owner is a real friendly and helpful guy. good luck guide#7(great, now i won't sleep again tonite thinkin' bout eyes)"
517579,Karl,2002-02-27 20:49:00,63,"Yup. At least to the three top spots, ranked: Redpine Bay, English River, Rice River, and Southwest Bay (southwest bay is predictable and consistent after or during a good southwest wind). Moonlight Falls is good too, but that's a two hour ride for you. Redpine and Southwest Bay are over an hour, Rice River and English River are probable 45 minutes. THAT'S if there is little or no wind, you know the way, and you're going full throttle. Double those times (and bring a pillow to sit on in the boat) if the wind is blowing.Got stuck at English River couple years ago after a storm blew in and it took two and a half hours to get back to Pickerel Arm Camp instead of the usual one hour and five minutes. Three foot waves and a boatride I don't care to repeat.There are obviously good spots closer that may not hold as many fish. Every windword point in the entire lake system holds at least a couple walleye. Whatever you do, don't try jigs below Abrams Chute. The bottom must covered by a couple inches of old jigheads and loose line. The current hangs up your line in the rocks before any walleye can get to it. Did get some big northerns trolling #9 Risto Raps though.Just remembered you're going in early June. All the good spots I mentioned are closed until after June 15th except Southwest Bay. Just find any bay that has either reeds or round rock (not broken rock) shoreline with the wind blowing into it. Early June they hold at the first 13 foot break and move into 3 or 4 feet depth to feed. Check out members.shaw.ca/slguides/ for the best guide in Sioux Lookout area.Good fishing, and be sure to post a report after you get back."
517584,Guest,2002-02-27 21:11:00,0,"We stay in sioux lookout at red pine lodge. We will trailer or boats and drive 15 min. or so to i will get back to you on the boat ramp. One guy we go with has this place memorized so we just foolow him. I dont know where we go but it is about 30-45 minutes boat ride going 50mph. I will try to get a hold of him to see where we go.TRY THISTwo years ago we were fishing in Lac Seul and a Canadian DNR(whatever they are called) checked one of our boats in our group. All they wanted to know was how many fish we caught, what kind, how big, ect. Never checked for license or anything. The cool thing was they gave them some free lures and a map of all of lac seul that had everything marked. Good hot spots, rock ledges i.e where not to run your boat, good fish ledges, stuff like that. I bet if you tried to get a hold of them, that they would give you a marked map. Couldnt hurt to try anyway."
517585,Guest,2002-02-27 21:11:00,0,You have gotten some good advise. I have been fishing the area for 25 years and hear are some of my observations1. How much money do you want to spend? Makes a big difference when thinking about lodging and guides.2. How much high water do you want to deal with. You said your wife would be involved. If you stay at the lodges near Ear Falls (West side) you will be dealing with a lot of open water. If you want to stay away from this I would recommend the Pickeral Arm camps as they are in an area wear weather will not bother you and the fishing is very good. It also has easy access to the Minnitaki area and Red Pine Bay (excellent for walleye).3. When you say Sioux Lookout I am not sure what you mean. The city is on Pelican Lake which is not really a good fishing area. It is a pass through Lake for people going to better fishing. If you are in SL you will have a long boat ride to good fishing.4. Lac Seul is a tremendous fishery but when you say Lac Seul you are talking about a very big area. If you want to discuss this further just email me at [email protected]ThanksJim
517586,Guest,2002-02-27 22:09:00,0,"There are some excellent spots to fish that are only about 5-10 minutes away running at about 40mph. So even with a smaller engine, it wont take that long."
517587,Guest,2002-02-27 22:20:00,0,"Phish,Are you saying 10-15 min from pelican lake?"
517588,Karl,2002-02-27 22:53:00,63,"Wait 'til you see pelican falls. You have to go down AND up to get from Pelican Lake to Lac Suel and back. Ever watch whitewater rafting on TV? Anyone mention life insurance? Actually, the BEST spot (maybe it's the one referred to) is right below the falls. The eddies on the south bank are one fish per cast or drift over. An occasional 8 pounder. Bonus is some fat 18 inch smallies. It's a 10 minute boatride from the landing in Hudson otherwise. Always get a kick out of Andersons private landing there. It's a two minute boat ride to Pelican Falls, but they take their clients for an hour or two boat ride to ""better"" locations. Go figure."
517589,Guest,2002-02-27 23:13:00,0,"To All,Thanks for this great info, Karl and Phish Naked! I have already booked a trip to Moosehorn Lodge for June 2nd... If the water is to low at Pelican Rapids, the Lodge will trailer us across Pelican portage. It's great to know that fishing is good that close, are there other good spots withing a half hour? We will be primarily fishing walleyes, I assume that Jigs and Lindy Rigs are the ticket???We plan to use minnow and leaches and bring in crawlers.If you guys have any further info it would be appreciated.Karl(the expert) looks like your going to be there at the same time, any further info and I might just have to buy you a beer or two.Darwin... The folks at Moosehorn seem nice give them a call.Thanks Guys!"
517570,Guest,2002-02-25 19:19:00,0,"My wife and I have just planned a trip to Sioux Lookout.(early June)I've never fished this area before, does anyone have any fishing spots to recomend. We would rather not travel more then 30 minitues on the water.How far is Lac Seul from Sioux Lookout.I have been reading many messages about the west side of Lac Seul... Have we made a mistake picking the Sioux Lookout area?All replys welcome... I cant wait to go, talking about it seems to give me a quick fix.ThanksDarwin"
517571,Guest,2002-02-26 04:19:00,0,"I've been going to Pickerel Arm Camp since 1993. It's 20 minutes south of Sioux Lookout on Minnitaki Lake. 1st class cabins and service plus great fishing. They have everything you need right there at camp, no need to leave. They even sell groceries if you need them. Check out their web site at www.pickerelarm.com I've caught 6lb. walleye and 15lb Northern Pike and 4lb smallmouth there. What more can you ask for? Bo"
517574,Guest,2002-02-26 07:40:00,0,try www.andersonslodge.com They have a number of lakes of fish in this area including Lac seul.
517575,Guest,2002-02-26 07:49:00,0,If you are staying in Sioux Lookout you are very close to Lac Seul. Maybe 10 to 15 minutes. Once on the lake (about 140 miles long) you can go as near or far as you would like. I can't tell you any spots close in as we go early June also but travel back about 40 miles and stay there. Good Luck.
517572,Karl,2002-02-26 19:24:00,63,A cold Labatt Ice and a good Cuban cigar.
517576,Karl,2002-02-26 19:44:00,63,"You haven't made a mistake picking the Sioux Lookout area, but I would not recommend attempting Lac Suel without an extremely experienced guide, or reeeaally good lower unit insurance. There's a rock or reef six inches below the surface for every walleye in the lake.I've also been going to Sioux Lookout since '93 and have had no want or need to attempt Lac Suel.Pickerel Arm Camp is the best value for quality and service, which also means they're 99% repeat customers, which means good luck trying to book there. Andersen's is good too, but a lot more expensive. Donelly's is the cheapest (pun intended). Island Retreat (www.siouxretreat.com) is highly recommended if you like the solitude of staying on a island close to some great fishing. Frog Rapids Camp and Moosehorn Lodge both require one hour boat rides to good fishing, otherwise they're OK. No walleye in Big or Little Vermillion lakes, so don't bother.Hope this helps."
517577,Guest,2002-02-26 21:11:00,0,"Karl,Thanks for the great info, sound like your an expert in this area. Moosehorn Lodge is the resort I was leaning toward... can you be more specific about the length of boat ride to good fishing?We want to fish mainly for walleyes.I think the resort is on Pelican Lake... will we really have to drive an hour to good fishing?"
517578,Guest,2002-02-26 21:14:00,0,"Karl,I should add that we plan to use a guide and would like to get up into Lac Seul."
517580,Guest,2002-02-26 21:33:00,0,"i go to sioux lookout the 1st week in june and have had some great success there. The past 4 years we have been going to lac seul for 4-5 days. THere is no comparison. If you can get on lac seul, DO IT. There is more quality fish there then anywhere around. Dont get me wrong, Lookout has some great fishing too, but lac seul is unbelievable. If you go with a guide, you wont be disappoited. you will catch just as many fish around Sioux Lookout but your total poundage at Lac Seul will be alot higher. But you are going with your wife(not that this is a bad thing)and the weather particularly waves can get very dangerous at times. WE had waves come over side on 20foot long Champion boats. Typically, that doesnt happen as much around Sioux lookoutEither way you wont be disappointed.Hope this helps"
517581,Guest,2002-02-26 22:25:00,0,"Phish,(I'd ask how you got that name, but I think I'm better off not knowing)Thanks for the great info. Do you still stay in Sioux Lookout and fish Lac Seul?We will deffinatly be using a guide, at least for the first day, It's my hope to mark enough spots, as well as the hidden rocks with my GPS, I'm pretty good with it, the lodge also mentioned that they would also help me mark rocks.In your opinion do you think this plan of atack will work?Any good bars in Sioux Lookout? ps.I usally have to beg my wife to come in when the weather gets bad!"
