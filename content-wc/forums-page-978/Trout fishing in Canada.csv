517711,Russ,2002-03-01 14:03:00,17,Could anyone tell me when Trout fishing opens in Ontario Canada? And also Walleye?
517712,HLLGuide,2002-03-01 19:30:00,10,Trout is open right now until Sept. 31 and walleye opens May 18.
517713,bigfish1965,2002-03-01 19:45:00,3210,Actually the previous post was misleading. It depends on where you are going to fish. Where I live many areas are open 365 days a year for trout and walleye. However each area is different and the seasons are adjusted to protect spawning fish. Try the following link for seasons on Ontario waters. http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/fishing/gen.html To download reg's and seasons ( using Acrobat reader) use the following link.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/pubmenu.html
517714,Trophymuskie,2002-03-02 09:59:00,254,Just like bigfish said you need to check out the regulations as there are some great trout fishing to be had in Ontario and Quebec as well as BC and each province have different seasons for different types of fish as well as different lakes. It is very complicated and cannot be remembered by anyone. I remember the splake season on a lake I fished many years ago was open a week in January and 2 weeks in March and a longer summer season.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com
