Under the guise of protecting of its citizens the Canadian government is hosing every Canadian who bought items and bringing them back across the 49th. Nickeling and diming us to death with duty. Have a gift given to you? It's not duty free. Unless I'm wrong, for the individual, everything is subject to duty."
517152,Guest,2002-02-27 21:53:00,0,"You are right forsure, when you enter from Canada to the U.S. the U.S.Customs does the checking. If any bad boys got through it was because of U.S. Customs letting them through. It's not a few bad guys getting through it's the container ships with thousands of containers the size of a semi trailer that don't get checked. They could have anything from a ton of TNT to an ""A-bomb"" to any kind of diseaseknow to man in them. I think Fort Frances Customs has always done a good job and tried to keep things moving. I've been crossing for 30 + years and haven't been delayed more than 45 min. to an hour. You do have to know when not to cross unless you like to sit in line. A short sit is OK it gives FAT EDDIE a chance to get the duty free liquior for all the guys on the trip."
517153,rollie,2002-02-28 17:55:00,4,I'll be crossing in late Aug. :) I haven't been across there in a lot of years. Usually go in over at the River entry. Could you clue me as to the Duty free station there? Out of Pigeon river Dewers Scotch was $17.?? A 40 OZ. Do they have a similer set up at the falls? I'm not too worried about the crossing time. It's all part of getting there.

517140,David/MN,2002-02-11 15:18:00,249,"Just as an FYINew Customs facility to open ThursdayBy Sarah McGinnisStaff writer The old Canada Customs booths on the international bridge will be empty starting Thursday as the new facility on Church Street finally opens. Canada Customs spokesperson Nancy Schultz said the new location, with its modern facilities and technology, will make the border crossing here more efficient for travellers as well as improve security protecting Canadians. Signs have been posted to direct incoming traffic to the new facility. Fort Frances is Northwestern Ontario's busiest port-of-entry. Last year, more than 450,000 vehicles carrying 975,000 people entered Canada from International Falls. Schultz said an official opening ceremony is being planned for later this year.This was in today's Fort Frances Timesdw"
517141,Guest,2002-02-11 15:49:00,0,keep this info coming....everyone is paranoid this year...and there is no need to be.
517143,Guest,2002-02-11 18:19:00,0,State of the art facility. Has all the newest goodies and more lanes to make your crossing times quicker and easier. A number of my buddies worked on it.
517144,Guest,2002-02-11 20:21:00,0,Where is Church Street/ Where is the new one compared to the old/ I will becoming from the east. Where in fort Francis do you exit too. Thanks
517145,Guest,2002-02-11 20:43:00,0,"That is good news. When I crossed last year the wait time was up to 7 hours and the line was about 3 miles long, stretching down the hiway. Being a former ""Type A"" personality (reformed by my wife) I drove 35 miles to cross elsewhere."
517146,Guest,2002-02-12 12:50:00,0,"The new facility is to the right as you come around the corner at the papermill. Biggest problem is that even the supervisors at customs and our MPP admit that with all the updates etc. that the facilities are already undersized and out of date; I quote"" sill the worst facilities of there kind in Canada '. With the traffic at Fort Francis and the ripoff of the toll that Boise Casscade charges at the bridge,(over $5 million per year; they didn't sell the cash cow when the mill was sold); we all need to press both governents to look at a new bridge downstrea with the flow patterns to respect the trafic that crosses both ways."
517147,MN_Moose,2002-02-12 17:25:00,965,"""Improve security protecting Canadians""? Feel free to correct me, but didn't the Sept. 11 terrorists enter the U.S. through Canada?Why don't they tell the truth? They have made alot of dollars (George) for the paper mill, crossing the bridge."
517148,rollie,2002-02-22 10:44:00,4,"A little help here. We will be heading up there in Aug. I know, busy month for sure. We are coming from Cent. Wisconson so will spend the night in the falls and cross the next morning. Do to the anticipated trafic would it be of any use to go across at, say 0400?Also, is there a duty free store there to buy booze?"
517150,Guest,2002-02-22 11:06:00,0,Last time I checked when you enter the US from Canada you go through AMERICAN CUSTOMS not Canadian Customs why doesn't the media mention that!
517149,Karl,2002-02-22 20:00:00,63,"I drive from near Milwaukee and used to stay in Intl Falls until I realized that there is NO wait to cross into Canada on a late Friday afternoon, and the motels cost Ft. Frances are half what they cost in the Falls (if you use a credit card for the optimum exchange rate).Saturday morning I'm up early, already across the border, and NO delays."
