517646,Northern Manitoban,2002-02-27 22:29:00,195,"Went to Natural Resourses today to check if the natives will let us fishermen fish this great body of water,as of now,they are not letting anyone in,Natural resourses used to gather eggs from the walleye's there for stocking other lakes and they are not even being allowed in.From what i was told it all started over the goverment not maintaining the road into Norway House and leaving it to them to look after it.2 years ago they would let you fish there but had to pay 10 dollars to leave your vehicle on the side of the road.But not now.And the goverment is aware of this problem but of coarse has no guts.If you try to fish it you will most likely get your truck vandalized or even being charged for being on there land.The American lodge owner is trying to sell the lodge also.I will be keeping tabs on this situation as the fellow from Natural resourses is going to keep in contact with me.I'm hoping to go to Molson this summer as its not far for me to go.I will post any new reports as things might change, for people interested in fishing Molson.The funs in the catching not the keeping.FISH ON."

517648,Piscatorian,2002-02-28 20:54:00,12,"Just curious, what area are you from? I've fished a fair amount in Northern Manitoba , and I really love it up there. I've always thought that there must be soooo many places up there with awesome fishing that are off the beaten path, away from the lodges and commercial fisherman. Am I wrong? I'm kind of surprised that you fish a place like Molson, as a local since it gets hit fairly hard (or so I hear, but I haven't been there). I'd also love to hear your opinion about some of the best lodges in the region. That's too bad about Molson. I've had some bad experiences with the Indians too, but mostly good ones."
517649,Northern Manitoban,2002-02-28 22:29:00,195,"Piscatorian.I live in Thompson,i fish so many bodys of water in Manitoba,and Molson would just be another one to fish.Molson getting hit hard? i would say no,but it does get netted.Molson is a very big body of water.I have alot of walleye and pike lakes down the beaten trail around my area,we have caught many trophys in these waters.I've taken people into these lakes,but i don't advertise them as they are very small lakes and could get fished out.I fish for trophys and let all my fish go.Behind my house i have the Burntwood river system that has huge wallye's and pike,i'm only minutes away to alot of lakes.its a tough life lol.if your ever this way,i'll be glad to take you or anyone else out on an adventure.The funs in the catching not the keeping.FISH ON."
517650,Piscatorian,2002-02-28 23:03:00,12,"Alright, I must admit I'm completely jealous. You don't know how many times I've thought about chucking the daily grind and trying to find a way to subsist up there. I don't think I could handle the winters, though.I totally agree with you on catch and release -- I NEVER keep any big fish (except on film), and I totally support the barbless regs in Manitoba. Although there is still a lot of great fishing up there, the trophy fishing is a really fragile resource. I think the closest areas to where you are that I've been so far are Kississing, Cormorant, and Bolton. I'll be further north this summer, but who knows -- I'm lookng for an adventure for the following year -- and it looks like most of my usual group may be ""out"" for that year with the economy and whining wives and all. Have a great year on the big ones!"
