517626,Guest,2002-02-27 08:45:00,0,Is the Ice safe enough to take a snowmobile out to Harbour island (cabin owner)? What are the snow conditions up that way? Any help is appreciated.

You can call Peter Barber @ 807-224-6411. He's there all year. Im sure he'll be glad to help you out and give you more up to date info.<{{}}><"
517630,Guest,2002-02-28 01:22:00,0,"When I was out 3 weeks ago, the conditions were good. Lots of snow on the trails. I left from Paradise Cove # 1 and went up to the cabin. We're across of Green Island, so I rode right past your place. Everything looked ok as I rode past. When you leave from Paradise One (which I recommend) when you get out into the bay look for a trail that is heading north... (yah can't miss it) the trail just before it hits ""the river"" , you will see two pine trees on the ice.... ride between them. The trees are marking a ice ridge...... so don't hit it going 100mph. follow the trail exactly. when you get to highcliff don't stay on the ice, just follow the trail up & over the point. Then when you approach Gull Island you will see the trail head ""west"" or left.... follow it. I know that in the summer you will go right/east but trust me, follow the trail. I broke thru the ice when I went right/east. after that point, the trail will swing back out towards big sand. when you get up to harbour island, you will notice a ""superhighway"" trail all marked etc. I think thats part of some trail system. I didn't follow it to far, as it heads off up towards little sand / rough rock. Going the other way I think it may head off towards Vermillion Lk then continue on towards Ena Lk etc. I have ridden in the past across Ver/Ena but not this year. IF you head north, you will find a trail that runs into the bush, the bush access is just east of the rockpile. It was neat riding.... and I did see / ride some lakes. No idea what the names of them are. I tried to get into Margot lake, but the trail was not being used.I also did ride the logging road behind the cabin, you can access this by going into West Bay. The trail is located where the old Rough Rock camp dock used to be. The trail is kinda rough (hehehehe) but you can get up it. If you head north west, the road will eventually hook up to the Big Sand Lk. road.All in all, the conditions were good. It has been freakesh warm here ( mind you it's -40 here tonight) When you get to Minaki, give Rob Bennet a call. He's the best local for information on this kinda stuff. I don't have his number handy, but he is in the Minaki book.He has been doing lots of work on the lake (cabins) and he has ridden it a fair bit. Just one tid-bit, you'll be thrilled to see the fishing nets out, just east of Habour Island.... almost in front of the cabins. I know I was.........Good FishenRob"
