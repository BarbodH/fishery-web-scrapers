516971,NateW,2002-02-07 11:45:00,96,"I have not fished the first week in June on Lac Seul, we always go the in July. So I'm not the one to ask about those dates.As for nightlife...we've always fished from first light to last and never left camp except the one time we ran out of milk. (We do our own cooking.) I understand there is a small tavern in Ear Falls although I couldn't say how much it ""jumps."" With all that water to explore and only seven days to do it in, I guess the nightlife isn't very appealing to us.."
516969,Jigger1,2002-02-07 15:03:00,234,"Nate,Perfect - I fish a lot in the Minocqua/Woodruff area of Wisconsin so I'm very familiar with Joe Bucher and his lures. I'll pick up some of them as well as some Mepps Aglia Plain #5's before hitting LacSeul at the end of June. Mo - In regards to early June, I understand it's trophy time for big pike. Cooler water temps keep the big dogs shallow. We typically cast shallow wind blown weed beds adjacent to deep water for big pike. Thus far I've seen some 40+"" monsters, but my largest in the boat is only 36"" Like Nate, I don't think there's enought hours in the day for fishing. Additionally we fish out of Silver Water Wheel Lodge and it's 40 miles on dirt to anything. We're happy to spend our five days at the lodge!Best of luck!Jigger"
516973,Guest,2002-02-08 20:38:00,0,My best lure(#5). Copper color(better than gold) I found to be very effective along with silver.
516975,Jigger1,2002-02-11 16:14:00,234,What's the largest Pike you've caught on Lac Seul? When did you catch it and what lure were you using?
516976,Guest,2002-02-11 20:03:00,0,Have to echo what everyone else is saying. #5 Mepps are about the best Northern baits we use in Lac Seul during the first week of Aug when fishing shallow. Usually fish them right over the weed beds.
516977,Guest,2002-02-28 12:43:00,0,Go online to Mepps and build your favorite. My all time Pike spinner is a number 3 WILLOW LEAF Mepps. The willow leaf allows you to fish it fast without coming to the surface and it can still be fished slow and deep while still having good flash. I have caught tons of big pike on this size so I only go to the 5's and bigger if Muskies are the prime game. I like the silver with the red shank and the gold is pretty good too. The price is right online too. Good luck. Gunny.
516978,Guest,2002-02-28 17:33:00,0,">I usually visit Canada during August or September.While fishing for northern, I have fished spoons, in-line spinners, spinner baits, crankbaits and jigs.For a general rule, I start with the silver on a sunny day and gold on a cloudy day for lure colors for northern.Chartruese or other bright colors can work well.My favorite spoon is a 4 1/2"" Daredevil {yellow five-of-diamonds(red diamond pattern)} with a single hook replacing the treble hook on a cloudy or sunny day.Silver or Gold Doctor spoons work well.My favorite in-line spinner is a Blue Fox Tandem Hook Silver (blade) Bucktail(black) with one oz. weight added to the shaft. Gold or Fire-tiger blades are also key lure colors.You can cover water quickly fishing this weighted lure. I have caught 2 40"" Northern on Lac Suel and many 37 1/2"" and smaller.I have done very well casting shorelines and beaver dams with a #9 Shad Rap Crankbait in the silver or gold pattern.On Lac Seul, I've started fishing in-line spinners more for northern so it would increase my odds of catching a Lac Seul Musky.You need to fish big fish spots catch Big northern. Keep searching on Lac Seul, there are monster fish available of all species."
516979,Guest,2002-03-01 09:03:00,0,"I use spinner almost exclusively - I love them for fishing large Pike.I actually make my own usually 6"" with a red and white bucktail treble for a hook - I make both brass and silver blades - it depends on the water colour as too which ones I use.I love catching a big pike on something I made with my own hands - it gives me a great feel - it also saves me a lot of money - I can make a (Mepps Musky Killer) type lure for about a 1/2 the price you can buy them for.It kills some time during the winter months - I usually make about 30 to 50 per winter....Paul"
516980,RANGER,2002-03-01 09:53:00,4341,"Yep! I carry them, too; Giant Killer's, Killer's and Aglia's all Mepps. I hear you on mangled wires after a few strikes. I carry needle nose pliers to straighten them as best as can be done. I also have tandem spins that attract Pike nicely. Two years ago I picked up three Titanium tandem spins. These have been bashed every way possible and they look like new. The reason I bring this up is that I had heard the Mepps and Blue Fox were supposed to bring out the inlines in Titanium but I haven't seen any. Did I miss them? If they were/are out that might be the solution to the mangled wire syndrome."
516962,Guest,2002-02-05 15:23:00,0,"Do many of you guys use in-line spinners such as Mepps Giant Killer, Musky killer,or any bucktail spinner for pike. If so what type and colors are the best bets. Thanks"
516963,Guest,2002-02-05 22:05:00,0,"I currently have over 40 (Yes, 40) Mepps Aglia Plain #5 in my tackle box. I typically go through 10 or 20 each year pike fishing. The reason I need so many is how hard the pike hit them! A couple of years ago, the pike bent the shaft every time -- 28 fish in one day, bent shaft EVERY time! Once the shaft is bent, the pike don't hit 'em. While I do occassionally use other lures, this has been my most consistent producer.

516964,Guest,2002-02-06 08:03:00,0,"Our group has fished several areas in Ontario and 5 of the 6 40""+ northerns we have caught have been on Mepps #5 with dark hair. The gold or brass blade seems to work best in the tannic stained lakes.We've also caught walleyes on them on fly-in lakes.Good Fishing"
516965,Jigger1,2002-02-06 09:50:00,234,"Tom,While we seem to spend the majority of our time hunting large walleyes on Lac Seul there are some monster pike. We usually cast for an hour or two in the afternoon. What color blades have you had the most success with?Thanks,Jigger1"
516966,NateW,2002-02-06 11:47:00,96,"Jigger,We also chase pike in the afternoon on Lac Seul. I use a 5"" Buchertail, in kind of a pumpkin-colored tail with a brass blade. I had four in my tackle box and all four were junk by the time we left. Each one had simply been brutalized beyond repair! I'm sure you'd find the same results with a similar colored Mepps. I had a needle nose pliers and was able to bend them back into shape a few times, but you can only get away with that so many times. WHEW!! What fun! In-Line spinners were the way to go for us. This year I'll have twice as many along!"
516967,Jigger1,2002-02-06 20:17:00,234,"Nate,Great to know. I've mainly thrown spoons and done well with Johnson Silver Minnows in Firetiger color. Had a few monster follows but have yet to land one over 36"". I'd like to nail a hog this summer and I'll give the #5's a workout.Thanks,Jigger1"
516974,RDbiteN,2002-02-06 20:53:00,4,I always keep some in my tackle box. My experience through the years is they tend to be more productive as the water gets warmer.
516968,NateW,2002-02-07 10:49:00,96,"I don't think it's possible to go wrong with a Johnson Silver Minnow! We tip ours with yellow twister tails. Oddly enough, ""plain"" twister tails have always worked best for us. When we used same-colored Powerbait twister tails, we had far fewer strikes. I don't think I've tried the Firetaiger, it's always been silver. I guess I have new tackle to buy--WAHOO!!By the way, you can find all of Joe Bucher's baits, including the Buchertail at joebucher.com. Go to the tackle section. His stuff really worked well for us last time up."
516970,Guest,2002-02-07 11:04:00,0,"Jigger or Nate,we're heading up to lac seul the first week of June. Have you had good success on the northerns that time of year with the in-line spinners? on another note, is there any evening activities within reasonable driving distance that would interest us guys or should we just plan on kicking back at the lodge (anderson's) telling tall tales and enjoying some properly aged bourbon?MoFisherman"
516972,Guest,2002-02-07 11:04:00,0,Ooops! Can't imagine how I missed that! I use the Silver blade almost exclusively. Several people have recommended the gold but I consistently outfish my partners who use the gold when I use the Silver.Tom Kadlec((º>`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.. ><((((º>`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸><((((º>><((((º>`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸.·´¯`·...¸><((((º>¸¸.·´¯`·. ¸.`·.. ><((((º>`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸><((((º>¸¸.·´¯`·.¸.
