I stuck some velcro on the bottom and on the boat seat to hold it in place. Very easy to portage too. The first batch of AA batts lasted 4 days, I was pleased. The suction cup doesn't look like much but it held all week. The unit marks while on plane and it is a lot more sensitive than I origionally thought. I highly recommend the unit. Let me know if you have any more ?'s"
