517634,MNStarfish,2002-02-27 13:00:00,32,Have any of you had any expperience with the Goose Bay Camp on Lac Suel? Seems to be a nice set up with very reasonable prices. Any input or suggestions would be welcome!Thanks!
517635,Guest,2002-02-27 16:01:00,0,"WE STAYED THERE THE FIRST WEEK OF AUGUST LAST YEAR. WE HAD SOME OF THE BEST FISHING WE HAVE EVERED ENCOUNTERED IN CANADA,AND WE HAVE BEEN IN CANADA MANY TIMES. THE CAMP IS RUN BY ANDREA AND SHE DOES A VERY GOOD JOB. HER DIRECTIONS ANDS TIPS WERE EXACTLY RIGHTON. THE FIRST THING YOU WILL NOTICE IS EVERYTHING IS NEAT CLEAN AND HAS HAD THAT WOMANS TOUCH. WE HAD EXTRA PANS PLATES AN KITCHEN UTINCELS THAT WERE ALWAYS IN SHORT SUPPLY AT OTHER CAMPS. SHE HAS A GOOD SUPPLY OF MINNOWS ON HAND AND GAS AND ELECTRICITY IS AVAIBLE ON THE DOCKS. THE FISH HOUSE IS VERY NICE AND CLEAN,AND YOU ARE ONLY TEN MINUTES FROM TOWN IF THERE IS ANY THING YOU FORGOT ON YOU WAY THERE. DON'T FORGET ON LAC SUEL IF YOU BRING A FISH IN THE BOAT THAT YOU WANT TO KEEP TO EAT YOU MUST KILL IT. THEY HAVE COOLERS FOR YOU TO USE, AND THE CAMP HAS BAGS OF ICE TO KEEP THEM COLD. THEY ALSO HAVE A SLOT LIMIT WHICH HAS REALLY IMPROVED THE SIZE OF THE FISH YOU WILL CATCH. I HOPE YOU HAVE AS GOOD A TIME AS WE DID LAST SUMMER. WE WILL BE FISHING LAC SUEL AGAIN THIS YEAR. CAN'T WAIT! JEFF AKA TWO-DOGS"

517637,Walleyefisher,2002-02-27 17:03:00,159,I went to Goose Bay last year the last of May first of June and it was awesome. The fishing was the best walleye fishing I've seen. We would use an entire minnow bucket filled to the rim every day. Andrea is great and there are NO hidden charges. I highly recommend this resort. Go to http://www.lacseul.com for more on this place.Good Luck and Good Fishing
517638,Guest,2002-02-27 19:10:00,0,"Goosebay is a nice resort. Andrea will treat you right and send you in the direction of the fish. The camp is clean and well maintained.Cabins are...cabins. Nothing fancy but cozy unless you get one of the bigger cabins, those are very nice. Benn there for the past 9 years and will be back this year!LS is a BIG lake! Get a good lake map with depths. All the maps I've seen don't show ALL THE REEFS... so be carefulGO Fish!"
