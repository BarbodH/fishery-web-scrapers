How are you planning to use the GPS unit? Do you want a handheld unit or something more permanent? Do you want/require a GPS unit with mapping capabilities (will increase your cost)?However, to offer some help, I'll describe my use and what I purchased. I wanted a handheld GPS unit for use with my recreational fishing as an easy method to mark fishing spots on lakes (waypoints on a GPS). Since I tend to fish inland waters in Ontario and Quebec where there are few digital maps for use on a GPS, I did not require a GPS with a mapping capability.I wanted a user friendly, easy to learn how to operate unit that was light weight, was WAAS enabled (accuracy as close as 3 meters instead of 10 meters), and had excellent screen resolution. I purchased a Garmin GPS 76 last May and I am very happy with it (see http://www.garmin.com/ and click on outdoor).I would recommend you visit the folowing web site for excellent information on many GPS products: http://joe.mehaffey.com/The following URL provides a comparison of the various features of Garmin GPS units:http://celia.mehaffey.com/dale/tech.htmThe following URL provides a comparison of Garmin GPS screen sizes, pixels and resolution:http://joe.mehaffey.com/pixels.txtMany companies make excellent products. You need to do your own due diligence. However, a search on GPS on walleyecentral.com will provide many comments for you to digest. Good luck."
