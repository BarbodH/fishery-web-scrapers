You'll catch lots of 'eyes and with some luck the occasional large one (8 lbs+). Good luck you'll have a great time."
517270,stewart,2002-03-01 08:48:00,100,"Just flipping through the Manitoba master's book, and I remember a couple of years ago Crowduck had tons of walleyes listed. I see it less this year. Was it just an off year?"
517271,gofish,2002-03-01 12:20:00,24,"The story I'm hearing is that the large mass of trophy-class walleye are starting to die off due to natural causes. I'm not sure of the reason why the walleye fishing peaked when it did. It could've been a number of factors. However, I get the feeling that the number of large walleyes that were present in the system was beyond the carrying capacity of the lake. Ever notice how Crowduck walleyes appeared to be on the lean side, not the fat hogs that you see in the Winnipeg & Red River system? Don't get me wrong, the fishing is still very good.....just not quite the same size as in the past. Any other thoughts on this?"
517272,stewart,2002-03-01 13:19:00,100,"There's so many they are starting to stunt in terms of the max size diminishing? That's an interesting theory, but hard to think of loads of over 20"" fish as stunted ;)."

I guide at a resort on the Winnipeg river, we can walk into crowduck via crowduck falls portage. We have a boat cache in the lake and do fly-out day trips there.The fishing changed from day to day. I was only guiding in there for about 7 days this past year, mostly in the summer months. On my worst fishing day, two guests and myself caught about 80 walleyes between 8:00 and 4:30. On my best day, three of us caught close to 200 between 8:00 and 3:00. In the spring time, a couple of the guides were reporting more than 300 fish per boat.The average size this past year was about 23""-24"" and they mainly ranged from 20"" to 26"" with a few masters being caught, depending on the spot. The fishing depends mostly on the weather. If it's too calm, and sunny, it's not as good, but if it's too windy, it's impossible to fish. You need that moderate chop.Personally, I enjoy fishing on the river more. More fishing scenerios, more variety of fish and fatter fish. You may not catch as many, but I enjoy it more. I also enjoy crankbait fishing which isn't practical in crowduck. In crowduck, you tie on a jig, grab about 4 tubs of frozen minnows, and haul them in till your arm gets sore. Even if one looks like it would be tasty, you can't keep any, conservation officers frequent the lake. If you'd like to discuss it in more detail, just drop me a note at [email protected]"
