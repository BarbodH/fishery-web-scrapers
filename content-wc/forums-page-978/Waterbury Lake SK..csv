517552,Bruce,2002-02-24 21:29:00,48,Has anyone been to waterbury lake lodge? I am going in july looking for stories from someone who has been there.

If you can give me a general location, I'll see what I can dig up. Also, our Sport & Leisure Show is in two weeks, I'll see if I can find anything there.derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!""On Sundays some men go to church and daydream about fishing.

No onder I'd never heard of it.Anyway, if you go to www.waterburylake.com they have a testimonial section, and a way to email them to access personal references from those who'd been there.Hope this helps.derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!""On Sundays some men go to church and daydream about fishing.
