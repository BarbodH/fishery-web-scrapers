I agree with Bill, do not support the netters, we found a net on LOTW in May that had dead walleyes and notherns, was not idenitified, etc, etc..."

567497,Guest,2007-07-18 09:48:00,0,I will be doing a Fly-in out of Red Lake in a few weeks at a conservation lake but would like to bring home some fillets. Where can I buy Walleye or Perch Fillets on the way home From Red Lake traveling through International Falls on the way to Wisconsin. Also how much would I be paying per lb.
567500,Guest,2007-07-18 10:23:00,0,You can get them at Ronnings and Border Bobs in the Falls. Last year they were $11 a pound. LOL About $25 dollars a pound less then catching them.
567501,Frankm,2007-07-18 11:02:00,154,"I saw some at ""The Sportsman"" gas/tackle store in International Falls this year. I think they were $11-12 per pound. Check it out on your way up."
567503,Guest,2007-07-18 11:49:00,0,"In the Chicago area you can get good walleye fillet's at Supreme Lobster. They normally service mostly restaurants, but you can go in their storefront on Rt 64 near Rt 83 and buy fillets. Call ahead to make sure they have them."
567504,Guest,2007-07-18 12:33:00,0,"Sportsman's Service sells them, they are right across the street from the Border Bar in International Falls. They have fresh and frowen fillets. Great people and they will take care of you."
567526,Skylane,2007-07-19 15:25:00,101,"I guess my question is where did these fish come from, how many productive females were killed and what about muskeye and other fish that may have died in the nets and were thrown away. I would hate to promote the netting that is going on in the Lake of the Woods and other lakes in Canada. Kind of like cutting your own throat."

It is difficult for me to understand why it is a good idea to support a process that contributes to a decline in a fishery. I do not have a problem with supporting other fish related businesses that spin off from the sport fishing industry. I also do not support the consumption of salt water billfish. If there is no business demand for netted walleyes,crappies, and other game fish, there will be less prssure from the netting entusiasts. That's just my opinion, I understand there are others, but do not understand why imaginative minds of those in a position of power cannot create a variety of other income sources for those seeking employment, rather than short term answers to a long term situation."
