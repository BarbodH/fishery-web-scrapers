567702,Guest,2007-07-23 09:33:00,0,Heading here the last week of Sept. Any ideas on where to concentrate for Walleye's Never fished the lake. Any ideas would be great also any place to stay. My thoughts are to concentrate on the river on the upper end of the lake but not sure? Anyone know somewhere to stay near where we fish if we fish the river on the upper NW side? Thanks Joe
567706,Guest,2007-07-23 10:59:00,0,Might try a week earlier or a couple weeks later. The big tournament is right about then. Most of the fishing is done in the river in the fall. We always stay near or in the town of Nipawin. I think Nipawin has a website.

567715,Guest,2007-07-23 17:13:00,0,Hi. I am going up there the middle of august for the first time also. staying at tobin lake lodge. It can only be better than lake of the woods.
567729,waltstalker,2007-07-23 23:29:00,46,The Vanity is the first weekend in oct. and all the guys prefish the week before . You may have a tough time finding a place to stay as there will be an extra 300 fishermen in town that week and you will have to fight with them on a fairly small body of water . Other than that fish the river for wallys and the flats on the main lake for pike . Don't skip out on the pike fishing here it is amazing with 20 to 30 lb pike common.
567745,Guest,2007-07-24 13:07:00,0,Tobin is a great place to fish. We stayed at McSwaney's cabins located at the park by the boat ramp up the river. Tobin Lake Lodge is also a great place to stay on the lake. Barbless hooks are now required with a new slot limit 22-33.75 inches. You catch one over 34 inches and it is going to weigh well into the teens. Most big fish are caught during full moon pulling plugs at night. The area called Eagle's nest on the river is a good place to start. Most big fish are caught in the river when they are running water thru the dam. There are alot of fish of good size [9lbs. plus) to be caught in the river or the lake.

Please release ALL those big fish, as we have been doing for years....maybe you will catch a 13 that has been released many times before.....ok, off the soap box.... ;-) Get a replica made...."
567757,Guest,2007-07-24 17:34:00,0,"speaking of size, just how small is tobin lake? maybe miles by miles."
567764,mrwalleye5,2007-07-25 06:16:00,1922,"Tobin Lake combined with the river is not exactly small. If I remember correctly, there are 7 or 8 miles of river, from the power dam to the mouth of the lake, then once you get on the lake, wow it's a long ways across, I'm just guessing, another 6,7,8 miles?
