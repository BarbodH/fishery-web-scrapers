We just finished a bass tourney there yeterday, the bass are there and very plentiful."

567440,dewyg,2007-07-15 18:34:00,1006,As a nuisance fish while bass fishing I was not to happy. But if you wanted to catch them I would have to say fantastic. We had to move spots at times because big pike would move in and scatter the bass.

567578,Guest,2007-07-21 03:03:00,0,"Late in the day fishing if it is hot is ideal. I fished Shoal Lake myself until dusk and did great. Actually I prefer 6am if posssible. Return to camp if it is hot, Relax. Go out again after supper or around 5-6 until dark. As long as you know that area you will have no problems."

Got more familiar with the lakes after a few years and we found fishing during the day usually as well enough we didn't need to go out. Plus we were a bit into the beer then and by dark we probably couldn't find the boat anyway...for the better...:) Did troll or cast some musky baits at night with a close to full moon out, was pretty awesome when a big Pike cleared water on a flat moon lit bay though. Make darn sure you have a neat boat and everything you don't need tucked away, nothing like a 15+# fish trashing away in a messy boat. And have enough lights to be able to deal with any inncedent that comes along, spot light helps a lot too. Not many bugs by the time the ice forms on the docks in the morning, but I've been up there in July...no thank you. Also I'd take my time going anywhere on the water, you may not see that rock sticking up and at plane, easy does it untill your sure of where you are and I'd still go easy....imho Al"

I haven't reviewed this topic recently, so you might want to check this out with your resort operator. I think its hard enough to spot reefs, rocks, etc. in the daytime much less going out in a boat at night. Fishing from shore is another story."

567159,Guest,2007-07-09 11:37:00,0,"The farther north you go the longer the daylight is in summer. Where I like to fish 55 degrees North you get about 4 hours of night, 2 hours of twilight and 18 hours of daylight around June 21. When you wake up at 4:00 am in the morning and it's light enough to walk to the outhouse and it's still not dark enough to use lanterns until at least 11:00 pm. It's just not practical to night fish as it is in the States. The long twilight period is ideal for targeting walleyes. It just takes a long time for the sun to set. It maybe just not as much night-time to work with. Of course you get 6 months of winter up there to make up for those long days. I never seem to have much problem with skeeters on big water but the little devils can drive a man crazy in the backwaters. I swear they sometimes look like fog coming over the water."

567088,Guest,2007-07-07 08:54:00,0,"Yup. We don't talk about it because we don't want guys like you catch all the BIG ones. I night fish on the upper French River during the first 2 weeks of June. The daytime fishing on the French is 2 notches below terrible and has been for the last 20 years. The French is basically fished out. We use the biggest floating Rapalas made in the size bigger than the 13 to look like smelt. Use black, blue and orange back colors. Some of ours are custom air brushed painted and the colors remain a secret. Run 2 staggered lines only about 70 and 80 foot back and have all your stuff organized before you fish in complete darkness. Lures will tick bottom. We fish in shallow water about 4-5 feet sometimes less. Best night we ever had was 5 fish in 2 hours. Never been skunked and all fish we ever caught were always over 5. The oldtimers up there haven't seen walleyes of this size since the early 70s. Our best night, 1 fish was about 10 and the other 4 were between 7-9 pounds. After June you have to move to other areas cause the smelt bite has ended. Their bellies were stuffed with smelt. Pretty easy and no brainer pickens. Takes us longer to get to the spot than the catching of the fish themselves. Keep noise and all lights to an absolute minmium. Night fishing is an artform and 99.9% French River locals are clueless on how to do it."

567092,Guest,2007-07-07 12:02:00,0,"Try to find weed beds close to deeper water. Get on the water early, right at or before sunup. Throw baits such as a big black suick, weighted or unweighted,a bobby bait or any big topwater bait and hold on. If you go early morning and also fish evening till dark you wont have to be there at night , and with the top water baits you get to see the action as well with no night operating on an unfamiliar lake."
567097,Guest,2007-07-07 14:13:00,0,"I love to fish top water for pike,but sadly the guys in my group don't.Zara spooks,prop baits, and buzz baits all work just try different colors.It's fun to watch them hit and miss a bait 3 or 4 times then smash it at the boat.Alot of fun but why do they have to be so SLIMY!!! That stuff gets everywhere!! Terry"

567101,bigfish1965,2007-07-07 19:09:00,3210,It's not illegal to fish at night in Ontario. We do it all the time. Bugs may be a big factor up north that limits it. We take our GPS and go find some nice fish.

567106,bigfish1965,2007-07-07 19:54:00,3210,"I think Eagle Lake is the only one. Some lakes don't allow live bait either, but using a blanket statement like it is illegal to fish at night in Ontario or illegal to use live bait is terribly misleading."
567109,JimH,2007-07-07 21:38:00,320,"During the summer, mosquitos are horrendous at night, especially if the wind dies down. While DEET stops them from biting, they don't stop them from buzzing around your face. We tried wearing head nets and while they didn't get through to bite our faces, they congregated so bad on the netting, you could barely see. After spending 20+ years trying to fight mother natures little monsters, we've just given up and call it a night. The night belongs to the mosquito. When fall comes around, however, we are out there at night, and experience some of the best walleye and muskie fishing ever experienced. A good GPS is mandatory, along with some knowledge of the lake(s)."

Huh, In jigmans 2003 post he begins stating ""he's not 100% sure"" on the issue in question. How is that terribly misleading? Or did someone else post that its illegal to fish at night in Ontario?"
567069,Guest,2007-07-06 22:49:00,0,"First off I am from KC Missouri,,,our summers average about 14 to 25 days of 100 degree weather (the humidity is normally in the 80percent range) this makes fishing horribly uncomfortable for us and the fish! Serious fishermen in our area do a considerable amount of night fishing. You can find article after artical written on the subject. I can honestly say I have NEVER seen anything written on Canada and night fishing. I will be on Shoal Lake(see my other post)Aug 4th through the 10th,,,I know its late in the season,,but was hopeing to do some topwater Pike(or bass!) fishing. Has anyone tried this? I would love any feedback at all. I have 1 week to fish Canada and this would double my time on the water if its worth doing (subtract out that pesky sleep thing!) Thanks in advance Tim"
567071,Stu,2007-07-06 23:34:00,472,"I have never fished in Canada at night because I'm not familiar w/ the lake. Some of the resorts forbid it. I have seen alot of night photos, so obviously some guys are doing it. We usually fish off the dock a night or two if the bugs aren't too bad."
567073,T Medley,2007-07-07 00:52:00,5,"OK OK,,,,Before we go any further--- Yes ,we would be extreamly careful of lake conditions,,weather etc......For what we are talking about in theory,,,we have found a fairly large weedbed close to the lodge,,the moon is halfway full (so we can see) and we bring lights with us,,possibly a cove---is it worth it? I love the topwater bite,,can we expect Pike to move into the shallower water? How shallow and what to use? Talk to me !! Any info on this subject would help. Thanks Tim"

567079,Guest,2007-07-07 07:06:00,0,I hope it's not illegal because I do it every year fishing for smallmouth.
567081,Guest,2007-07-07 07:14:00,0,"I have fished at night thru serendipity. Camping out at Little Sturg Lake, I could hear fish working furiously in a small bay, a school of walleyes working minnows after a warm day. Friends that live on a lake near Thunder Bay fish late at night for big pike that move into their bay. The times I fished at night involve the need for flashlight to avoid tremendous snags, which in turn bring swarms of insects. I obviously don't go far, given lack of familiarity with the lake. Also, during those fortunate times when fishing is good, I either have a limit back at camp or am too tired from the day. Good luck and give it a try."
567082,Sutsgold,2007-07-07 07:15:00,219,"On some lakes it is against the law because the large walleyes are easier to target, however, on Shoal I am not aware of this being in effect. I have fished at night in canada and I can tell you this, if you are not in wind, or out in open water the mosquitos made it unbearable at times. Also, it is so easy to get turned around on a lake with many islands that it becomes dangerous. Outside of your cabin should be ok. Best of luck."
567086,freespoolin,2007-07-07 08:41:00,472,I've seen guys fish exclusively at night for musky on Crow Lake (SE of Kenora) You had better know your lake and take lots of high-deet mosquito repellant.
567087,Paul H,2007-07-07 08:48:00,1232,"I like to night fish, but usually find myself ran off because of the bugs most years. I hate bugs and skeeters get so thick you can't even see. However on years than bugs are few it's great. I know the lake well, usually could see by the stars if needed as it's so remote. I also don't need to go more than a mile. Camp owner, who gets to fish very little doesn't even start until 11:00 or later.... Unlike most of you guys that go from Mn to western On - I go to N. Eastern On - bugs may be worse. AFAIK - no general On rules against it. Lake I go is lightly used, very few camps, some day trippers use the ramp and I've seen guys trailer in for night fishing also. Usually mid-late August and night fishing is definitely better."
