They are always out, and we spend half of our first day looking to buy licenses. Does anyone know of a place in Winnipeg that is open 24 hours and sells licenses? We will be coming up at night and would like to stop and get our licenses on the way. The closer to the Perimeter Highway the better. Thanks"
