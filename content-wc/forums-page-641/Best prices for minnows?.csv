I saw that the Anglers Pro Shop in Nestor Falls had ""scoop"" prices for minnows on their website(approx. 6 doz. small minnows $16, approx. 3 doz. medium for $12 etc..) What about other places? Does the Four Season bait shop in Ear Falls have similar prices? Thanks for the info !!"

I can't say you would get the same number if you just stopped in but it might be worth a try. I would say you get at least 4 doz for every doz you order. Four of us in June could fish all day on 4 doz and we were catching fish all day.
