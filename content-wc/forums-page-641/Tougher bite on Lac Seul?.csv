567531,Guest,2007-07-19 16:26:00,0,"Just posing a question for all Lac Seul fisherman. The first time I fished Lac Seul was 2003 & have now gone every year since. It seems the 2003 was our best year for numbers & size of fish. The last 2 years have been our lowest. I know Lac Seul is a wonderful fishery & is far better than anything here at home in Missouri. I know weather can also be a factor, it just seems that it has been steadily worse. In reading the reports for Silver water wheel lodge, his reports seem to reflect the same thing, harder to catch fish. We fish the south west part of the lake out of Scout Lake resort. Is anybody feeling the same way or is it me?"

567626,Jigger1,2007-07-20 07:52:00,234,"I've been fishing out of SWWL since 2000 and in order of best volume years it's gone like this, #1-2005, #2-2003, #3-2006, #4-2007, #5-2002, #6-2004, #7-2001, #8-2000. So as you can see at least for this person and my group, the last few years have been pretty good. The number of monsters 27-30"" fish has gone down in recent years, but I see a really bright future with the strong number of huge 22-24"" fish we catch. One of the 24"" eyes this year was nearly 6lbs this year on a digital scale and it truly had the shoulders of a trophy. We always fish the last week of June and my only weather issue is that we haven't had multiple days of a consistant wind to really develop a strong pattern. In previous years we've been able to fish spots multiple times over several days because of steady and consistent directional winds. Over the past two years the wind direction has changed daily and often multiple times in one day. Moreover the winds have been very light the last two years from calm to medium at best. I haven't really fished in rockers since 2005 when we had an off the charts volume year. So with this being said it's been more difficult to locate concentrations of fish and primarily big fish. In both 06 and 07 we caught fish from 5' to 38' of water so they've been spread all over the system. In previous years at that time of year we rarely went looking in anything deeper than 20'. Long winded approach to a pretty short answer but my analysis is that this is simply year to year variation thing and weather plays a major roll. If we get 3 or 4 days of steady winds in 2008 I know it will be one of the best ever. Only 337 days until I'm back on that wonderful body of water for an extended stay in 2008."

567554,Guest,2007-07-20 09:36:00,0,"Thanks for your responses. What your describing is what we're experiencing. Plenty of fish in the 20-24"" range, but very few in the 25-29"" range compared to our fisrt 2 years. Just as indicated in the swwl fishing reports- the fish for us are not schooled as big & we mark plenty of fish-but more difficult to catch. Our first 2 years we would catch 25""+ fish daily, now just 1 or 2 per week?"

567556,Guest,2007-07-20 10:57:00,0,Don't you think with everyone bragging how the fishing is on Lac Seul that it is getting more pressure. I know it is a big body of water but when people take out trophies it takes a few years to replace them in the quantities people talk about. Not only people in the resorts on the lake are fishin it but locals and resorts on other lakes take day trips into the lake. Scott

That is set up for both my home computer and the one I am working at here. Thanks for keeping me in mind.

Every thing will depend on how things progess on this end, but things seem to be moving forward. This year was truly one of our best at SWWL and I have pictures pasted to my board here at the hospital to bring smiles to my face. All the best and cheers.....IA Walleye"

567607,onemorecast,2007-07-22 19:51:00,23,"just returned today fro a week at LS. I would say the numbers were lower than normal, but to the point on wind, it came from a different direction almost everyday. My 11 yr old son got a 30 and a 26 and both are still there for the catching, so it was a good trip. Live minnows are the best in my view, even though I don't like fishing them. Gulp shad (3 in) were good substitute but not as good as live minnows. onemorecast"

567574,Guest,2007-07-20 20:21:00,0,"Jigger1: Good responses. We have been fishing central LS for the past 9 years now. Our best year for big fish was that first year. However, our best year for numbers was this June 2007 and it was our second best year for big fish (30.5, and 2 28""'s). I agree there is a huge year class of fish in the 24 - 26"" range that in a few years will be master class fish. Despite the pressure, the lake is huge and I believe with good enforcment of the rules (both those from the province and those in addition that the resort owners have applied (ie no trophy catches kept, use of perma mounts only for tropies) will keep the lake way above even the Canadian norm. Jigger1, hopefully we connect next year. Last week I felt I was running out of steam. Pulling 12 hour day construction work early in the week and by the end, could only do a poor four hour work load. This Monday went to the family doc, and by Tuesday night I was at the U of Iowa hospital with a diagnosis of acute luekemia. The great news is the type I have has a strong remission rate and I am guy that loves a good challenge. Today the kids came to shave my head in advance of the chemo taking it. Good for a laugh and way to keep them involved in a learning mode. I have my list of goals posted to the wall and beating this year's 30.5 next June is one of them. Next to that goal is being in Madison to watch my beloved Badgers beat my adopted team the Hawkeyes. The line life if short so enjoy takes on a whole new meaning when you get to see that the statement truly has meat to it. Keep posting great fishing thoughts because on-line fishing is as good as going to get for a bit.....cheers... IA Walleye"

567570,Jigger1,2007-07-20 17:50:00,234,"The great thing about data is how many ways do you want to slice it and what end result are you looking for? When I look at size, here's how the last eight years played out for our group. #1-2002, #2-2000, #3-2005, #4-2004, #5-2007, #6-2001, #7-2003, #8-2006 In my last post which was volume based you'll notice that 2002 was one of the lower volume years, yet it was the best trophy year ever and it included 27 walleyes over 27 for our group of six. However this included one of the most memorable afternoons of fishing I might ever witness in my life on 7/1/2002. As a front was approaching all three boats in my group were fishing the same area and in a one hour span I saw 20 walleyes over 25 boated, this included 6 over 27 two of them MA's, the day before the same location produced 5 over 27. The weather was perfect for walleye fishing with three or four days of strong winds primarily out of the west and thus the results. 2003 was a silly year for volume, but other than one 29 and a 31, our group only caught four over 28. The last two years have been tough for us by Lac Seul trophy standards, but volume has been above average. I personally don't think fishing pressure has anything to do with it, not on a system of this size. I've caught the same, easily identified, fish three times within an hour on the same piece of structure so let's not give the walleye credit for being the most cerebral creature of the face of the earth, when they want to eat, they'll eat. I believe pressure is more closely correlated to deprivation of a population base and the slot limit does well to protect this. Year classes come and go and many theorize we may have simply passed by a few strong year classes of big fish that are no longer there. I'm a believer in cycles and I for one theorize another trophy hay day is on the horizon with the silly numbers of robust 22  24 fish in the system today. Lastly and probably the most important factor in my book is that the weather hasn't helped our group in two years. Two, three or four days of winds pounding into the same shoreline will produce significant concentrations of fish and I've not seen more than a half day of consistent wind in our last two years of fishing and this makes things tough and why we've seen fish spread throughout the system. There's always next year and I'll get a 30 sometime!"
