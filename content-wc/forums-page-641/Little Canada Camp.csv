Jigged up a 28"" and usually had several 20""+ fish each time we went out. I think the biggest advantage of fishing the river is that you don't get blown off like you would on Lac Seul on windy days and you are a 30 second boat ride from good fishing. The fishing is not as exceptional as out on the main lake, but the price is right and you can pull the boat out for Lac Seul if you want for a day as well. Kevin will work hard to make sure you have a decent stay. He is a straight shooter that has a lot of repeat business. Do a search for LCC on this board and you will find more info."
