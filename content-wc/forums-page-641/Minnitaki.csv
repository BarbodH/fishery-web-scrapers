566937,Guest,2007-07-03 15:44:00,0,"Heading up to Minnitaki on Friday, staying at Timber Edge on Butterfly Lake. I'd be grateful to hear what's been going on there, and I am willing to share info when I get back approx 21 July. The camp owners are good folks, but there's no point in asking them because they spend all their time running the camp, not fishing. Particular questions are: 1. What is the water level like? Can we get out of Butterfly easily, or do we have to creep along with the motor tilted all the way up? 2. Any action in the usual spots: the humps in the main lake, Redpine Bay, English River (water level there)? 3. What is the weed growth like? In general, there aren't many good weedbeds in Minnitaki, one in the east end of Redpine, one outside the entrance to Redpine, two in Lyons Bay: a) just south of the channel into Butterfly, and b) in the bay at the far NW end of Lyons Bay (have fished in the latter place but never caught anything). Indeed, I don't have a reliable spot anywhere on Lyons Bay, which means long boat rides to get to good spots. If the water level is different from previous years (last year was the lowest in my 5 years), maybe the weedbeds are elsewhere, if they exist at all. Thanks in advance."

566938,onemorecast,2007-07-03 16:16:00,23,"Redpine and English are always good for numbers. Find midlake humps or big flats 15 to 30 feet deep and you will catch fish. If the weather turns hot you will need to go deeper. I have fished Minnitaki 7 times at this time of year and the fish move a lot, so move until you find them, but you will find them and then have 50 fish a day fishing."

Right, this is what I've been told. This time last year, the only hump that had boats on it was the one SW of the entrance to Pickeral Arm. Tried several other humps on the main lake and didn't get anything. Might spend more time on flats than in the past, have not fished these much, except for the one at the NE end on Redpine. Might also spend more time going faster than in past years. We usually bottom-bounce in up to 25 ft at about 1 mph. i think moving slow is good when you know you are on a spot that holds fish. Could use heavier weights and try 1.5 mph, cover more water & find new spots that way. Two years ago we got fish every other cast at English River; all but a few were 14"" or less. Did not even go there last year, low water. There is a bar near where the estuary fans out into the main lake. Two years ago, when water was higher, there was just enough water for us to get over the bar. I wish there was a good hump or something on Lyons Bay, for fishing on days when the main lake is rough. Maybe there is some decent structure around the little islands west of Burnthut Island, at the east end of the bay."

Oops, forgot to say that all five over-the-slot walleyes we caught last year came from Redpine. We only had two other fish over elsewhere on the whole lake in the last three years."
566983,lazyk,2007-07-04 10:46:00,26,"I`m also interested in the water levels in butterfly and its outlet. It was pretty low last year and it sounds like the whole system is low this year(but on the way up). My motor gave me fits going through the channel and it took a long time to go through. Aside from that we had a great time. You named the weed beds we found but most of our walleye fishing was off the points, reefs, etc. Never did catch a lake trout but it was august so expectations were low. Redpine bay did produce for us as well but there was alot of good looking areas on the way down as well. One thing is for sure, you could spend a month exploring that lake and still not scratch the surface. One thing we did notice is that the walleyes aren`t afraid to go deep. We caught several in 35-40 feet of water of of the reefs. There was a fellow from illinois who used a 2 oz. jig and a 6 inch salamander who was fishing for lake trout in 60-70 feet of water. He promptly pulled up a four lb walleye. Maybe they go down once in a while to feed on ciscoes, I don`t know. I usually go swimming at that point. Good luck and remember to not fish in the first boat slot on the right. That is where the pet northerns are."

What amazes me is that my daughter would catch perch on one side of the dock and throw them to the wolves on the other side of the dock for them to eat. Thanks onemorecast and jdngfd for the feedback. How did you catch that lake trout? How did it taste? Good to hear that the channel seems a little higher- the fastest I could go was a trolling speed. We went to Redpine once last year to see what it was all about. I believe I had a couple bite offs from northerns. We had a great shore lunch in a bay on the way down. I recall moose and wolf tracks on the beach next to the poison ivy. Good to hear that Kevin and Diane are doing well. Did anyone catch any walleyes with a blue tinge to it? We caught two or three last year with a distinctly blue color to them that I have never seen elsewhere. I was wondering if anyone else noticed that. Looking forward to August at Timber Edge."
567300,jdngfd,2007-07-11 14:42:00,6,"lazyk, We just took Kevin's advice on the Lake Trout, fished the deep part of Lyons just outside of Troutfish and Minnataki. Showed tons of fish on the graph at 60 ft so we put on the divers(fishseeker brand) and let out 100ft with a taildancer on one pole and a spoon on the other. Taildancer got the fish, haven't ate him yet, looks good though not a ton of fat on him. To be honest I think we caught the smallest Lake Trout there, I think there is a size limit later in the year but Kevin said for June there isn't, check with him. We just kind of randomly trolled the 100 ft deep water with the divers set for 60 and got lucky I guess. There wasn't a whole lot of an art to it, but it was nice to take a break from the walleye and relax for a couple hours trolling deep. Good luck in August, let us know how you do. If you are thinking of anything to take up for Kevin, he told us one of the big bummers for him is no sour(50/50 or squirt I think in canada) for his Kesslers. Give him an email he would probably appreciate a case."
567700,Guest,2007-07-23 09:22:00,0,"Just got back and had a great time. July 7 thru 11 was the best fishing we have had in our six years up there, lots of eaters and big walleyes over the slot, biggest was 26 inches. July 12 and 13 were cold, windy and rainy, still got a 38 inch northern. The fishing slowed down some after that, bright sunny days, but it was stil good first thing in the morning and in the evening on main lake humps and narrows between islands. Spots in the shade were usually better than spots expose to the sun. We marked lots of fish stacked on the edges of this structure, usually with batifish in deeper water. The higher the level of sunlight, the deeper the fish would be, and the less eager they were to bite. Got most of the fish bottom bouncing with spinners and minows or leeches, did best while coming onto the edge at a right angle from deeper water, as if the fish were looking out toward deeper water. No problem going thru the channel between Buttterfly and Lyons bay, lots of water, even saw a bull moose up close there. One day we marked fish in 55 to 60 ft of water, right on the bottom. Thinking they might be lake trout, we put on heavy sinkers and went down after them with spinner rigs. Lo and behold, my wife pulled up a small walleye! We then quit fishing there, as they marks were small, we were already at our limit for keeping walleyes, and we didn't want to release more walleyes from such deep water. Thanks to all of you for your previous advice. We did indeed catch walleyes near weed beds the first few days, but things changed after that, as expected."

Me too, in one stretch there was only 2 ft under the transducer, had to slow down, trim way up and crawl thru. Then when it got deeper to 3 ft could trim down and go a little faster. Could not run the motor much above idle speed while trimmed all the way up, it would just push itself down, boat/motor guys claimed this is normal. Aside from that we had a great time.

Our favorite method is slow trolling spinners on 3-way rigs. Need 2 oz weight at least to get down more than 25 ft. I've also been told to spend some time working the deeper water outside the reefs and humps. Keep the lure at the same depth as the structure, just move the boat out into deeper water. If there are fish on the hump or reef, there tend to be some hovering nearby at the same depth in deeper water.

566991,onemorecast,2007-07-04 15:00:00,23,"if you are near redpine and continue on down the lake a 1/4 to 1/2 mile without turning toward redpine, there are some rocks/very small islands that narrow the path. Just before you get there, fish the area between 30 to 15 feet. We have picked up many 21 to 25 inch fish there, although some years they are there in plenty, other times not at all."
567042,jdngfd,2007-07-06 06:24:00,6,"We just go back on the 30th from Timber Edge. Kevin and Diane were great as usual, as was the fishing. The water level seemed a little higher than last year and we didn't have any trouble with the 18ft Alumacraft/140 Johnson in the channel from Butterfly to Lyons, just keep it on plane. As far as the fishing went, PHENOMENAL!!!! Got stormed out one morning so we went to Knobbys for breakfast, it was about 1230 by the time we started wishing Redpine, try the bay at the far northwest corner, 6 hours 82 fish. We went back to the ""falls"" on the English, not bad fishing wasn't overly impressed, watch the channel markers it get real shallow by Nicks Island, chewed up a little bit of prop. Our 16 year old fishing guru took home a thick 42"" Northern this year. We had the best luck trolling crawler harnesses in 9-15 feet of water off the weed edges, about 1.5mph. My buddy and I even took an afternoon off to search for the elusive Lake Trout, we caught one in Lyons right before the entrance to the big lake that proved that the Lakers are still breeding and reproducing, 17.5 inches, at least we caught one...good luck and say Hi to Kevin and Diane, we're already looking forward to next year, we got our site booked for the week that the refuge opens, one of the groups must have decided to quit going that week so were in now."
