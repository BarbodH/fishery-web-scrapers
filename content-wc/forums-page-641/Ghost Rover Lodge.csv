Each day we caught plenty of fish and had a blast watching the kids catch fish. You have a bunch of different lakes to fish within easy boating distance from camp. A clean, well run camp. Would go back again."

We caught plenty of walleye's, but most were in the 14""-17"" range. Recommended Ghost River to some guys at work and their group just returned last week.Same report.. Good Food and accomodations.. They caught plenty of Walleyes and Northerns, but no real big fish.. GeneT"

Accomodations are good and the boats/motors are very reliable. This is a camp definitely worth considering for future trips."
