Anyways, was fishing with him, and we got talking about the unit, said he'd like to load on some more ""detailed"" maps of bodies of water in Saskatchewan, the basemap details suck! Anyone know of any products out there that would be able to be loaded onto the unit? The only thing I really have heard about is Navionics, but I dont think any of their products have any lake/river details for Sask water bodies. What about Lowrance? They make any map products like that? Thanks very much for any help!"

561537,Cameron Muir,2006-10-05 17:07:00,11,"uzzi, I'm quite satisfied with my lowrance maps which came with their MapCreate Topo Canada CD-ROM. If you need just Saskatchewan you can buy a memory card with just that on it, but I think the CD is better value (< C$200). You don't get water depth contours, but the maps themselves seem to be reasonably accurate. This spring, fishing out of Mirond, my handheld GPS consistently showed me boating through a certain narrows. It only showed me on land when having shore lunch. But hopefully someday they'll create their HotSpots maps for Saskatchewan as well. Check out lowrance's site for more info."
561539,Mike M (Sask),2006-10-05 17:38:00,374,I'm from Sask. as well and I use MapCreate 6.3 Very detailed and about as good as you'll get for here.
561540,uzzi,2006-10-05 17:44:00,349,"Thanks guys, I'll pass the info along. Where did you purchase MapCreate from? Approx Cost?"
561541,Cameron Muir,2006-10-05 17:55:00,11,"The Fishin' Hole, Saskatoon 306-665-7223 My memory is poor but I thought it was about C$180 plus tax, which includes lowrance's proprietary card reader."
