Very lite bite, but still caught many once the front moved thru.Most of my fish came in 21-24 ft, but most of the fish were deep 40-60ft and not biting. I pulled 1 fish that was over 40ft down. We found alot of fish of the steep drops just sitting tight. Northerns were active in the weeds as the suface temps dropped about 6-7 degrees, little cleos and mepps spinners worked for us, caught about 50-60 in one afternoon. Fish of the week was a 28.5 walleye 39in Northern and a 22in. whitefish, (any reciepe for it appreciated)"

Biggest were 28.5"" walleye; 41"" pike (fatty). Weather was cooperative for this time of year. Weather front prevented us from the 15 mi. run to our spot 2 of the 4 days we were there. Great time with buds. Great place to fish. 360 days and counting."
