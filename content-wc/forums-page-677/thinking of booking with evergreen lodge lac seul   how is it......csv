You can travel as far as you want, or stay close to camp. You will catch lots of walleyes. IMO, the best drive to lake in the world. Bring a GPS. Buy a Navionics Canada chip. (Also my opinion)"
561448,Guest,2006-09-29 19:29:00,0,"First things first: Get your reservation made and deposit in right away, they fill up extremely fast, as a matter of fact you may have a tough time booking there at that time. Cabins are excellant, when you book your time you can request a guide, I'd suggest Shane. He'll put you on fish."

The owners Gary&Pat make sure that your trip is one to remember. Great Cabins, Great Service, Great Fishing....cant go wrong. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
561453,Hump,2006-09-30 11:36:00,578,I have been there for two years.Wonderful! E-mail me if you would like specifics. [email protected]
561454,Guest,2006-09-30 12:48:00,0,"wayne, believe you have two problems. june is a tough booking anywhere up there. lots of repeat customers. two people is even tougher. better get on the phone early. evergreen has nice boats and nice cabins. they fill up fast. good luck."
561460,Guest,2006-09-30 18:59:00,0,talked to pat got the last cabin thank god she sounds very nice...now that i got the cabin i don't know if i can wait 9 months..i would get a guide for a few days. i love the shore lunches so does my wife. the place looks great.. any more info about the resort and lac seul fishing would be great thanks again for your time WAYNE[email protected]
561465,Mike Kansas,2006-10-01 10:26:00,1463,"Wayne B, You have made a great choice. Glad to see that you were able to get in at Evergreen. Gary&Pat will give you a map and put you on fish. Might be a good idea since this is your first trip to hook up with a Guide for the first couple days. You will learn what is working and how to fish Lac Seul. Should be a great trip and I'm sure you and your wife will catch plenty of fish. Rig up with some 8lb test line and take plenty of 3/8oz and 1/4oz jigs. I like Char, White and Pink jig colors. When the bite is on they all work and the bite is almost always on at Lac Seul. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
