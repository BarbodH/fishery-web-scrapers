My son and nephew fished with me in my boat and my father, brother and friend fish in the other. On Friday, we drove up from Fargo and fished the Red at Selkirk from around 2 until 6. We caught about 20 saugers per boat with my father pulling in a 28"" greenback. We stayed at Pine Falls and went back to the Red on Saturday. Fished from 8:30 until 5 and caught about 50 saugers per boat with an occasional nice walleye. There were a smattering of boats catching the occasional master angler but probably one out of ten boats. Sunday had a tourney at the Red and we fished Traverse bay as long as we could stand it. There were 3 boats out there from when we got out around 8 until noon. Wind was howling from the South and the waves got to be a little much. We did manage a couple of nice greenbacks with the largest at about 7 lbs but it was slow. I marked a lot of baitfish. Water temp is around 56-57 degrees so still too warm. The Red River was about 1.5 degrees cooler. We finished off the weekend at the Red. My brother caught a hawg that was just over 29"" but estimated to weigh around 11lbs. I have caught some fat walleyes in this system going back to 1990 and this is the fattest walleye for it's length that I have ever seen! It was a chunk. ALso, we proceded to catch the occasional 21""-24"" greenback with many saugers in between. Summary: Fishing on Traverse bay is still a little slow. Talk to a few and no one had even as much success as we did. As for the Red River at Selkirk, they are in the system. Bring lots of salties or minnows as you will go through plenty with the saugers. We kept the 14""ers for the fryer and had a great couple days of shore lunch. Ended up able to bring back our conservation license limits from the last day. I am excited to go back. The fishing is picking up and the greenbacks are moving in. Water levels are as low or lower than I have seen since 1990. I'll be back on October 20 through the 23rd. If you have been out up there, please update this report as it's nice to see the trends."

The Greenbacks are defiantly in there, but will be a lot better once that water gets down a few degrees. The flow on both rivers is down, but not too bad. The Winnipeg could use a little more. Ended up with 9 fish over 27 inches, with the biggest being 32Â”. A ton of Sauger to keep you busy in the Red, and plenty of rough fish to keep you busy at Pine Falls. We did quite well jigging and trolling. Ended up catching the biggest trolling the Red on the MM and the break offs. (Be prepared to lose some crankbaits!!!!) Other than that, we caught a bunch of nice greenbacks and caught a lot of fish overall. Things are really starting to look good as it is still early in the run. We saw quite a few nice fish being caught all around us. At the motel, we had mixed results from different boats. Anywhere from 6 masters a day to hardly catching anything. Seemed like people were catching fish all over the River. It just takes some scouting and finding your spot. I will be up there again from October 12-16. I hope we time it right with the water temp them .I will report again on how it was."

Then moved up to the other side of the #### at St. Georges where a friend told me they had been getting a few eater size walleyes. Nice scenery up there and it was a good experience. We did catch several small eyes and a couple of eaters. Saturday we also went to Selkirk. As mentioned, lots of saugers. Got one greenback, 27.5"", 9#. Sunday was about the same, but only fished for about 3 hours -- all saugers."
