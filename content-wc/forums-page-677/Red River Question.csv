For starters, that QUAD is a #### of a lot bigger than me and out weighs me by at least 500#'s! IT WASN'T PRETTY,LOL! As of yesterday the water temps were sitting at 55 degree's. One again there were some nice fish produced on the mile!"

Ah...ya..I best watch out, er a certain Ol Man will bust me up. LOL! I spoke with a crew just up your way, they did very well and are planning another trip ASAP. I hope to fallow as soon as I get the chance to get a few days off again. That may be a couple weeks off by the looks of it now. Hope them ribs heal for you fast. I know from experance that kinda bump does hurt for a while. Be well. Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""ED on the RED"" ><,sUMo,>"

Pulling >cranks and working jigs has both been productive. Spoken like a true outfitter! Truth be told the bite is barely decent with a very occassional nice walleye being caught. Most people are getting some sauger but walleye are far and few between. It's a bit on the early side yet. >"

As we are coming from some distance and always look forward to this trip, Stu's advice is very welcome. I find him to be VERY fair, and not a bit self-promoting. I have never fished the Red (always Pine Falls), but certainly plan on it this trip. Steve"

I live here, I fish here, I know lots of other ppl who live and fish here. I even know Stu. LOL. You know NOTHING, except what you're reading on the internet. LMFAO! Trust me, they're not going yet. Soon I hope but right now I wouldn't drive 50 miles to fish the Red."

Any where in and around Selkirk can be good, most ppl fish south (upstream) of town though. Your never far away from a potential 12 lber. There is a big derby on this Saturday so there will be a lot of boats out to show you the spots. Good luck."

As a matter of fact, they ARE ""going"" and pretty well actually.Oh yeah, I drive about 1/4 mile. Hit the Mile, Reid's, etc., etc., and you'll find them. Look at some of the posts on our local sites, forget your ""buddies"" second hand reports. Better yet, get off the computer and actually go fishing!!! LMFAO, indeed!"

561392,walley250,2006-09-26 17:51:00,161,"Our group usually fishes at pine falls but this year we have decided to dedicate most of our time on the red. We were there last year for one day and caught 4 over 9lbs in the first hour in one spot. However, after that unbelievable hour we did not hook onto anything worth talking about. What I am wondering is this typical of the red. Is it a game of patience or should you be moving trying to locate fish."
561394,freespoolin,2006-09-26 18:48:00,472,"Living in Winnipeg, I've fished the Red River for 20 years. It can be the most rewarding fall fishery and the most frustrating. I've sat in a pack of 20 boats, two boats are catching, 18 are not. I've moved and caught fish, moved and caught none. The only advice I can give about the Red is to be prepared to put in a lot of time with no guarantee of results. I've fished Pine Falls once this year, the greenbacks are not there yet. A fishing buddy fished the Red last Saturday, he caught 17 sauger and three walleye including a 9# and a 12#. The greenbacks are starting on the Red, they're not numerous yet. Good luck, it's called fishing not catching."
561396,Guest,2006-09-26 23:05:00,0,the red is where you want fish if being surrounded by 100 boats and getting skunked is your idea of good fishing somebody is bound to catch a big one with that many jigs in the water if you want more action and plenty of room to fish go to pine falls
561405,Guest,2006-09-27 10:37:00,0,"The Red is hit or miss and the fishing can change day to day. I have had days where it is non stop all day, and the next day only a few. Better chances of big fish on the Red and usually more fish at Pine Falls. The conditions on the Red look great this year. Some big ones are being caught already, and things will only heat up more in the next few weeks. On the Red it seems to be a morning and evening bite, with a few mixed in during the day. I personally like to find a spot where I have been catching fish during the morning, and if the fishing slows down, but I still keep marking fish on the depth finder, and catch a few here and there. I will usually stay for most of the day. Just need to find what they want to bite on during the day. It never hurts to try new spots and look for active fish, but if you have fish moving under you, they will bite again in the evening. If people see you were catching fish in the morning and you leave, you may not get that spot back when you come back to fish it in the evening. I usually give each spot about an hour in the morning. If that spot isn't producing fish I will go and try another one. (Producing fish doesn't mean big fish. As long as you are catching fish that big one will come through) Fish under the boat means there is something that is drawing them there (structure, migratory path, ECT) It is only a matter of time when a school of big ones comes through. The old rule of thumb, if you don't catch one in 30 minutes, I do not believe at all. You need to give a spot an hour to see if fish come in."

""Leo"" best described the Red and how to fish her and enjoy some degree of success. Over all it is game of patience, at least this has been my observations that span thirty plus years. There are all sorts of ways to avoid playing bumper boats while on the Red. Many who are not in the know, will simply pull up into an existing cluster of boats and drop their anchor. Personally I hate that style of fishing and I simply refuse to do it! Instead I opt to locate area's (and they are endless) where no one else is fishing. Besides, as an accomplished and knowledgable angler, what have you accomplished muscling in on a spot that someone else has found!? Personally I love to fish both Pine Falls and the Red. Both venues offer great opportunites, both can be very rewarding. Unless the conditons improve over at Pine Falls, there's going to be a lot of disappointment! The problem she's facing at this time is....there's NO FLOW! Anyone and everyone who has any knowledge about P.F's knows that there has to be flow in order to attract the 'eyes into Traverse.....at this time there's so little flow coming through the dam, a dead walleye could swim upstream! For those heading to P.F's, Good_Luck and pray for rain and improved flow's!"
