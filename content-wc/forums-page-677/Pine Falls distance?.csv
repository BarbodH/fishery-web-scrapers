561506,Danny61,2006-10-04 00:36:00,42,How far from launch to bay? If I were to travel at 42mph how long to get to rock humps in the bay? First time out this weekend just need to know if I should bring a jerry can or is it only a 20minute drive?
561507,Guest,2006-10-04 02:07:00,0,The trip from papermill launch to the bay can't be more than 6 miles.
561509,Guest,2006-10-04 07:48:00,0,"15 Minutes...max if you slow down, you might be able to enjoy the scenery... J/K. I take it you are fishing the derby this weekend. I hope conditions improve out there. There wasnt much out there 2 weeks ago and the temps have not cooperated. If fishing the tournament, you'll want to get the red dace minnows from Hampshire baits.. They work best out there in my opinion. Roger"
561510,Guest,2006-10-04 09:38:00,0,"thanks for the info, first time fishing this tourney I'll pick up those minnows, what about worms or leeches?"

561512,lund115,2006-10-04 10:29:00,698,"All depends on the water conditions. If it is smooth, it will take you 15 minutes. If you are going against 3 footers, than 30 minutes. It has taken me up to 40 minutes to get out there in rough water. Remember to stay on the Right side of the river (left side has obstructions you could hit) Also, be very careful once you are at the mouth of the bay. It can get really shallow there. Couple years back, I thought I was in the clear, and I looked down at the depth finder and I was buzzing 2 feet of water doing 35 mph!!! There is about a 100 yards area that you can cross into the bay safely towards the right side of the river."

561519,Guest,2006-10-04 12:05:00,0,You are absolutely correct. A good north wind will slow your trip. Put some dandy choppy waves in the river. Roger
