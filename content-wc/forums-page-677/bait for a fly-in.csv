561355,Guest,2006-09-23 12:56:00,0,DKin Fished Warwick in August. We had fires to the east and south. Just curious which portage lake the fires got to. thanks pnnylfr
561371,Guest,2006-09-25 06:04:00,0,Copper Lake near Loree Falls was cooking when we were there. We also saw flames to the west near Tower Bay. We've had very little luck on Warwick in early Sept. How did you do in August? I'd appreciate any suggestions.
561374,pnnylfr,2006-09-25 10:40:00,114,"DKin Water was the lowest and fishing was the slowest I've ever expierenced for Warwick. Our locators showed alot of concentration of what we assumed were schools of perch and baitfish. Maybe the walleye did not have to work so hard for a meal. I also wondered if there was an earlier than usual turnover in the water. We did not go after northern to hard. Peter had a couple of guys come in on Monday and moved the boats around from Second Rapids to the walk across portage, but we never did fish Copper this year. One of the guys health limited him to stay on Warwick all week and I did not fish any of the portages. Four of the gang did make it down to Bullock for a day with fair results. Our best spots were across from the cabins and fished to the west in 20'-35' of water, a few holes on the way down to Bullock, and out on the main lake off a couple of mid lake reefs. The ""narrows"" was the Dead Sea this year. We mostly drift with a jig and crawler or plastic. Did troll with crankbaits but don't use that tecnique often enough to judge the results"
561398,Guest,2006-09-27 06:37:00,0,"Pnnylfr, Thanks for the reply. By chance, is Joe Michon your father? I know he fishes several times a year with Peter and that he was at Warwick just ahead of our group."
561399,pnnylfr,2006-09-27 07:16:00,114,DKin No relation. Joe came in on the day we left. He was using leeches. Do you know how they did.
561472,Guest,2006-10-02 06:50:00,0,"Pnnylfr, Are you going back to Warwick next year? May I contact you via e-mail?"
561499,pnnylfr,2006-10-03 09:10:00,114,DKin Feel free to contact me. My e-mail is in my profile.
561281,Guest,2006-09-21 07:13:00,0,"For what it is worth we ended up buying leeches on Sept. 7 at $46/lb Can from Rainy Lake Sports in Fort Frances. At our outpost north of Red Lake water levels were down about 4', we witnessed the forest fires in person and caught lots of walleye as shallow as 9' and deep as 35'. Next year we will definitely scale back on the leeches and go with mostly crawlers and frozen ciscoes. Speaking of ciscoes, we had great success using a piece of it on a jig with or without a plastic tail. Just curious if others use this very much."
561292,Mohleye,2006-09-21 14:37:00,368,"Am I remembering correctly that you can't take even frozen cisco across the border? I think they must be purchased in Canada. No matter what else you decide to do, I would take some crawlers. All the suggestions everyone has made are good ones, but if for some reason you hit a tough bite, nothing beats crawlers."
561293,Mohleye,2006-09-21 14:38:00,368,"Sorry, I should have read more carefully.........you're already back!"
561298,pikemike,2006-09-21 16:16:00,95,"yep, not the same but similar. we ran out of minnows one evening and had a couple of perch flopping in the bottom of the boat. after the sun goes down and its dark, nothing like scaring the bejesus out of the next boat by launching a perch throught the air and watching it land right next their seat in their boat! Then you yell something like, ""Holy Crap! Flying Asian carp!!"" It's even funnier when you tie it with line to a pole. When they reach for it you make it jump out of their boat and swim back to you. Then after they settle down you do it again. Seriously, when we ran out of minnows we've cut a piece of perch belly and threaded it on the hook like a minnow...works well."
561309,phishfearme,2006-09-21 20:57:00,1242,watch out - using any part of a game fish for bait is illegal in ontario. - phish
561310,phishfearme,2006-09-21 20:58:00,1242,i think cisco are ok but smelts are out in many areas - even frozen ones. - phish
561313,bugsy,2006-09-22 05:50:00,49,"DKin, Curious as to where you saw the fires. What lake was your outpost on & how close was the fire. Den."
561315,Guest,2006-09-22 06:41:00,0,"Den, We were on Warwick Lake, part of the McInnis River. Our outpost is east of Deer Lake. The fire never came near our cabin but one of our shore lunch spots on a portage lake was toasted. We were amazed that the fires mostly consumed dead wood on the ground and left many trees green and standing. It will be interesting to see the fire's impact when we go back next Sept. BTW, Monday, Sept. 11 was the worst day as the sky and horizon resembled that of a storm before a tornado."

561336,Guest,2006-09-22 14:12:00,0,"Whoa, didn't realize perch were gamefish...won't be doing that any more. Nevermind my previous post, have never used perch belly and don't intend to! Besides, heard they don't work for bait anyways."
560561,Guest,2006-08-22 17:27:00,0,"Given leeches will most likely be unavaialbe in two weeks, our group of six is trying to decide what to use as a substitute. Crawlers are reasonable and readily available. We're also looking at some frozen ciscoes and/or preserved shiners. We mostly jig fish for walleye on a lake 100 air miles north of Red Lake. Any potential sources for leeches or other suggestions will be appreciated."
560581,515,2006-08-23 07:37:00,254,We usually just stick to worms. Easy to keep and it adds just enough taste to keep the fish on the hook. Good Luck
560592,Guest,2006-08-23 12:57:00,0,WE JUST CAME BACK FROM LAC SUEL TEN DAYS AGO. I FISHED WITH GULP AND MY FISHING PARTNER FISHED WITH MINNOWS. I CAUGHT FISH FOR FISH WITH HIM AND I EVENTUALLY PULLED AHEAD IN THE COUNT BECAUSE I WAS IN THE WATER MORE. I WOULDN'T PRETEND TO TELL YOU IT WILL OUT FISH NATURAL BAIT BUT I CAN TELL YOU A HAND FULL OF GULP IS ALOT EASIER TO TAKE CARE OF AND IT WOULD MAKE A VERY GOOD SUPPLEMENT TO THE CRAWLERS YOU ARE TAKING ALONG. GOOD LUCK JEFF
560604,Guest,2006-08-24 06:24:00,0,"Jeff, Thanks for the advice. Which Gulp did you use? Color, size , leech, minnow or worm?"
560605,Skyraptor,2006-08-24 06:30:00,291,"I agree with Jeff, 3 weeks ago I was outfishing my boat partner with Gulp vs minnows because if you snagged up on the bottom you lost your minnow, if a fish bite at your bait you either lost hte minnow or had to reel up to see if the minniw was still there. Plus you had to take the time to biat after each fish. With the Gulp you just took the fish off and were back in the water. My choice next time is to skip the minnow and just go with Gulp. Best color that worked on eyes for me were the 3"" pink or white twister tail type of Gulp."
560606,Guest,2006-08-24 07:33:00,0,"Personally, going that far north on a fly-in; I wouldn't take bait either. We used to fly out of Red Lake to the west, never needed any bait there. I fly out of Armstrong now and don't take bait, plain old twisters, ringworms, Gulp baits and Power tails is all I ever take. A lot less hassle trying to make sure the bait doesn't cook on the way up, while in the boat, etc. Just my $.02"
560628,Dr. Lee,2006-08-24 14:15:00,15,"One simple alternative would be salt/borax minnows. I have used them on fly-in trips, but also on boat-in and drive to lakes with great success. I would agree that crawlers and/or ""gulp"" are also reliable. I probably would not fly in with only one choice. Could be a long week. Dr. Lee"
560631,Guest,2006-08-24 21:25:00,0,WE USED THE FLORESENT YELLOW AND THE SHAD MINNOW I THINK THE MINNOWS LOOK BETTER BUT I CAUGHT ALOT ON BOTH I GUESS THE FISH DIDN'T CARE WHAT I THOUGHT LOOKED BEST. I THINK I WOULD TAKE ALONG A SELECTION OF A COUPLE DIFFERENT KINDS AND A FEW DIFFERENT COLORS JUST TO COVER YOURSELF. JEFF
560636,Guest,2006-08-25 10:11:00,0,"Been up to that lake before used worms with crawler harness and bottom bouncers-worked great. If you can get minnows and work the area called ""the narrows"" with slip bobbers it's a killer!!! Good luck-"
560670,Guest,2006-08-26 20:30:00,0,"We used to fly out of Red Lake for years, never used live bait. Yellow and chartreuse single & double twister tails on yellow or green jigs. We always caught hundreds of walleyes. Never needed them."
