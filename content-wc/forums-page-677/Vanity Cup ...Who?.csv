561495,DaveD,2006-10-02 23:08:00,57,Got this of the Melfort radio station that was covering the Vanity. Sorry but missed the names of the 3rd place team. 1st - Team 22 - Tim Geni and Dan Gougeon 2nd - Team 83 - Ed Hexter and Craig VanMarion 3rd - ? 4th - Team 143 - Paul Brunette and Wayne Tumak 5th - Team 19 - Greg Earis and Rob Furutani Dave D
561496,DaveD,2006-10-02 23:22:00,57,"Another interesting stat. The businesses of Nipawin put up $1000.00/day for the largest walleye (by length) caught from Sept 23 - 28. The fish must be over 80 cm (~31.5"") and be releasable to qualify. The prize was claimed 5 out of the 6 days and the largest was over 15 lbs. The prize accumulates if not won each day, so one team won $2000.00 for their fish. Dave D"

561478,Guest,2006-10-02 14:42:00,0,"I talked to a couple of friends via cell phone, who are driving back from the tourney... but they couldn't remember who won it. They said the winner runs a Ranger and had also won it before. Anybody know who won?"

561483,Mike M (Sask),2006-10-02 16:17:00,374,"I heard it was Tim Geni from Regina, SK. I tried the web site but I can't confirm it. I also heard there was lots of big fish caught. I'll check around and see if I can get anymore info."

561488,Guest,2006-10-02 17:14:00,0,Mike Sounds great...now if I can just figure out a way to sabatoge my wife's line so that she doesn't out fish me again this year!! Clarkie
561489,Guest,2006-10-02 17:33:00,0,"My buddies who fished the tourney said the water was clear and ...actually a little low. (Surprising with all that rain in September). Sounds like everybody ""sore mouthed"" a lot of ""slots"" and ""overs"" during the tourney. They'll be ornery and hungry when we get there, Clarkie. ;) See you...(My new Pro-V looks just like last year's...red)"
561490,Guest,2006-10-02 17:38:00,0,"Thanks, Mike. I wuz thinking maybe that's who it was."
