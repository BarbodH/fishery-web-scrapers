We stayed at Young's Wilderness Camp in Stevens Bay, bait ship folks suggested we boat over from the camp to the falls for best results. We had the lake almost to ourselves, and did quite well around Hay, never went to the falls. Although the pods were not of any great size, there were enough to keep us interested. The location of the fish was very dependent on the wind direction; they would be in a different, but predictable location when the wind direction changed, with the 3 days of east wind producing the least, north being the best. Did not get over to Obabikon, due to 20'boat length, and advice that we wouldn't be able to navigate the opening. Summary: better than last year, not as good as 03. Gotta start planning for 07!"

A lot more walleyes mixed in with them this year. Heard of quite a few boats going into Obabikon, but never even attempted myself. Heard about a Ranger being wedged in the narrows and had to be pulled of the rocks. That had to hurt. Brett"
561440,Guest,2006-09-28 23:44:00,0,"Thanks for the report, Bill. I heard from Rick Gates blog that a Ranger got hung up on the rocks at the entrance to Obabikon and had to be pulled out. We may take a pass on Obabikon this year. Also heard some good reports of crappie at the usual Miles Bay spots. We head up Oct. 6 for our annual nine day fall trip. You aren't going back in Oct.?"
561443,Bill Krejca,2006-09-29 08:17:00,6107,"No, I'm afraid that's it for this year. I was up by Nakina in July, and if I went any more than twice a year, I would have to find a new home, he,he. Oct. can get pretty cool, I've tried it a few times, and if you aren't running the electric motor and facing the wind, it can be OK, but several years ago, I decided to go a little earlier. I may possibly go a week later next year, depending on cabin availability. Good luck on your trip, give us a report when you get back. Several friends are returning from the Morson area today, so I'll get a ""week later"" report from them."
