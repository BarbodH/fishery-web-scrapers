561422,Guest,2006-09-28 13:31:00,0,Any clue on what the Bite is like? I'm going to be fishing on the Red this weekend?? Would like some tips / reports. Thanks !!!!!
561441,Guest,2006-09-29 07:49:00,0,"Maal, Hit and miss on the river right now. Some are getting them, some are not. Have a look at http://manitobaanglers.com/Forums.html under open water fishing. Regardless of the reports, I will be on the water on saturday. Havent fished the Red this year. Was at Pine Falls last weekend and you could have used a CIL lures and not brought up any greens.

561466,Guest,2006-10-01 10:27:00,0,HA HA HA... You a funny guy!. Not really. Anchoring down for 5 hours really isnt my style. But on the red it does produce fish. No question about it. At least we had a good group around us to chat with in between fish. See you on the water.. Roger
