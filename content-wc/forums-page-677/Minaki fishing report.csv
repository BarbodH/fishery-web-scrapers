We had good size walleye, with a 30"", 2-29"", 2-27"", several 26"", and many others in the 20- 25 inch range, and smaller. I caught 2 muskies, 38 and 43 inch. My buddy caught a small 28 inch musky. Another musky kept grabbing a smallmouth that he was trying to get in. Largest pike was 37 inches. A couple pike of 36 inches, and many in the 28-34 inch class. Largest smallmouth was 17 inches, caught in about 15-18 FOW. Fished 90% of the time in Gun Lake due to the wind. Appreciate the advice prior to the trip on this site. All in all a good trip, Don"
561325,Guest,2006-09-22 09:00:00,0,That's good to hear. I'll be up for 5 days. I was hoping for it to cooled off more to try for muskies. I haven't been down for a couple of weeks . What were the walleyes biting on mostly. Plus we've seen a lot of grouse this year so plan to spend some time on those This all happens after we fix the bear damage to the place. momma and her twins did a number on the place

561352,Guest,2006-09-23 09:42:00,0,The walleye were caught on Reef Runners in 30-35 FOW trolling out from islands. The bright colors worked best. Don

I wasted lots of time in my fall fav spots. With no current there was nothing. So we trolled around the south end of big sand , running along reefs and islands. We started to pick up a few. And to stay out of the wind we fished Pistol the remainder."
