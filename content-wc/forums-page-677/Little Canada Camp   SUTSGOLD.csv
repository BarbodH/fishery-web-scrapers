First three days we got caught in a cold front and rain. Fishing was still good but the bites were really soft. We fished at the Dam and hit the points and rock areas down river. The last three days the fishing really picked up after the cold front moved out. We caught fish at the Dam and did well on the points down river. Fish were caught equally on minnows and crawlers with both baits being fished on a jig. The boat I was in concentrated on the Dam area the last three days and we consistently caught fish all day each day. We moved around all day on the left side of the water below the Dam from the bouys down to the corner (about 75 yards) working water depths from 6' to 20'. Sometimes we would just anchor and others I would try to control the boat by back trolling slowley up and down the drops. This area has always yielded the biggest and most fish for us. The biggest fish we caught were 25"" and we caught several of those each of the last three days and several during the cold front. The majority of caught fish were in the 17"" to 22"" range with numbers being good every day. Kevin, the owner of Little Canada Camp did a great job of taking care of us and is very helpful with information about the fishing. Little Canada Camp is ran very well and is a tremendous value on a piece of water that is easy to fish and productive. A big thanks to Kevin for making our trip a great one. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
