561409,pikemike,2006-09-27 17:02:00,95,"just returned from another Red Lake run, seemed down 18-36 inches. from last october. The upper chikuni had a decent amount of water flowing earlier this spring, now its all mud except for a small stream coming from little vermillion. saw several deer standing out in the dirt where the rapids usually are. was also lucky enough to by a new prop. rocks that are typically 4 feet down were showing at 2 feet."

You'll think 06' was the low year now. My pontoon sits on a set of rollers off the shore, in normal to high water I crank it down and it floats away, last week it was 4' above the lake when cranked down to the lowest point. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

561193,Guest,2006-09-14 08:46:00,0,Had conversation with someone who just returned from a fly-in North of Nakina. Water was 4/5 feet low. That is tough.
561207,guidedfishing,2006-09-14 20:57:00,531,"Just returned from the sturgeon lake area north of Silver dollar, fished several lakes, all were down any where from 2 1/2 to 3 feet. I managed to only take out one prop minor damage. I hope they get a good snow pack this winter, everything is extremely dry and fire danger is extremely high. good luck GF"
561234,Skylane,2006-09-16 17:53:00,101,I took my dock out of the water last week on Dinorwic and the water level was probably 3 feet lower than when I put it in the first of June.
561385,voyaguer,2006-09-26 08:40:00,54,Just returned from English River near Separation. Water was down about 3 feet from last year. V
