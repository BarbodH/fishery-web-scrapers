561408,topcat3820,2006-09-27 15:17:00,2,"""Are you saying that all 4 ramps are closed??"" Definitely not! As I replied on the other board, all 4 are open as of this morning and WILL remain that way according to Selkirk Public Works dept. They have also been working on the approaches and ramps and checking them daily. I believe ManitobaWalleye was talking about End of Main but certainly won't try to speak for him (that's what I think he meant, anyway). The ongoing dispute up at the End of Main is not going away anytime soon."

561251,lund115,2006-09-19 11:42:00,698,"Good Idea, How is the ramp looking so far with the water levels low...is it going to be an issue this fall????"
561254,Stu McKay,2006-09-19 12:13:00,18,"Here's the take on Selkirk's boat launch facility. Major upgrades are the order of the day, this has been the situation for many years now. ""If"" enough of the right pressure is put on the elected officials who are in charge and responsible for maintaining such public facilities, it will make a difference. As for the current status of the Red, she's in great shape! The water levels are down ""slightly"", but over all the river is in great shape. Judging by the vast amount of emerals and other important forage species in the system at this time, the ""fall-run"" should be awesome! The sauger action has been excellent during the past couple of weeks and my prediction for trophy 'eyes will be nothing short of fantastic! Now that we are experiencing much cooler temps which has dropped the water temps by five degree's since Friday, the 'eyes will continue to move into the river. During the past two days we have been experiencing strong northernly winds, once again an important feature needed to encourage 'eyes into the river.... In short, for those of you who are looking foreword to another year of hammering huge 'eyes on the Red......make sure your line is fresh and your hooks are sharpe!"

561387,Guest,2006-09-26 09:27:00,0,"as of right now, one US citizen has written Claude to support improving the selkirk ramp"
561390,Guest,2006-09-26 12:19:00,0,"I went to the website and read that he needed ""information."" What info. does he want? I agree that something needs to be done as I have heard of boat and trailer damage in the past. I know that the two ramps to the south can be used, but with the traffic that is there during the run, it can take forever to load and unload using only those two. Some in our party are now putting in at Stu's, and if things don't improve, I can see us doing the same. Does anyone have any more info. on End of Main? Is it permanently shut down?"
