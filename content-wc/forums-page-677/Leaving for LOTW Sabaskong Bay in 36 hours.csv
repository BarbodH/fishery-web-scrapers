561486,esgrams,2006-10-02 16:40:00,92,"Hey Dan, You lucky DOG!!!! Say Hi to Ray and Roxanne from the Grams family. If you want to get into the crappies try Gohre Bay along the East side before you get to Lake of the Woods Lodge. I heard a report on here I believe, that they were also biting at the Falls, which is right at Nestor. What cabin are you guys staying in? My dad started taking me there 36 years ago now, so I know you will have a very relaxing time. To bad I didn't know you were going earlier, I could have used a paid trip guiding. Just Kidding!! Give us a report when you get back or if you have any questions drop me a e-mail. I'll help if I can. [email protected] Eric"
561498,birddogger,2006-10-03 09:10:00,43,"AO I agree with you on those gps units,some are pretty complicated. I think it would be easier to fly an F-15 jet than navigate some of those big lakes in Canada.Now you have all winter to learn your gps. Good luck. Birddogger"
561521,top1,2006-10-04 12:32:00,1,"Birddogger, the x25 really isnt that complicated,most people will read the manual before using something like the x25 for navigation.At least have a paper map for back up . Common sense I would say. Just my two cents."
561528,Guest,2006-10-04 19:08:00,0,Ya AO just a little common sense would have saved your lower unit. It seems those rocks tend to jump out at you sometime.
561531,Guest,2006-10-05 11:43:00,0,No - it was someone at our place who did the deed....Fishing is great right now - crappies in Obabikon and Hay Island and Walleyes all over............Rick
561532,rockpt,2006-10-05 12:00:00,589,"Hi Rick, Thanks for the report. We arrive tomorrow for nine days. Can the big boats get into Obabikon? See you on the lake."
561421,greenhorn,2006-09-28 11:10:00,1,Any last minute words of wisdom or suggestions? This is my first trip to this area. We will be staying in Nestor Falls at the Red Deer Lodge. Thanks Dan
561428,Guest,2006-09-28 15:03:00,0,Only advice is to pack warm clothes and have a great time.
561439,Guest,2006-09-28 23:37:00,0,"Just a couple: Make sure you hit northern Miles Bay for the crappie. Watch out for rocks, water level is at the 10th percentile. If going for muskie, troll 10"" Jakes at the rocky shoreline breaks in about 12'-16'. Try the mid-lake humps for smallies (great fall pattern). Get over to Painted Rock channel to check out the Indian paintings. Post a report when you return. We head up on Oct. 6 for our annual nine day trip. Have a great time."
561444,Guest,2006-09-29 09:56:00,0,"Rockpt, Are you talking midlake humps in Miles for the smallmouth? How deep of humps are you fishing? Also are you using tubes and grubs as your presentation? Thanks for any help you can give. Brett"
561445,Guest,2006-09-29 11:40:00,0,"1700 SS, Yes, the typical mid-lake summer walleye humps. Plastics or live bait on jigs in 15'-25'. Just throw 'em back for us to catch. Good luck."
561450,Guest,2006-09-30 07:51:00,0,"Just got back last week and did O.K. except for the reef I hit taking off the lower half of my 225 Opti. Yes the water is way down so be careful. Thank goodness my brother in law had a spare boat at his cabin. The hot ticket was bottom bouncers with 3"" gulp minnows (white,chartuse,red)on spinner baits or which I hammerd them on was a One eye jigging spoon I get from Starks Marine in Praire Du Chien,WI. Another company called Wolf makes a copy of it now.Never used minnows since $$$$$. Good luck and be careful."
561457,Guest,2006-09-30 15:42:00,0,"please let me know how you do. we're leaving for lotw, miles bay on th 20th for a week. we'll be looking primarily for bluebills in the basil channel area with crappie, walleye and muskie fishing to fill in the rest of the time. staying at miles bay camp with matthew and jen. btw, anybody have a duck report yet. thanks in advance. br"
561463,Guest,2006-10-01 02:05:00,0,"AO, Thanks for the report. Where did that happen (and were you staying at BV? Rick posted something about a guy taking his lower unit off)? Would like to know as we're heading up next week. Those rocks are everywhere this year."
561464,Guest,2006-10-01 08:44:00,0,"No, we don't stay at BV,my brother-in-law has a cabin around the point. But we get our gas at BV and I am sure Rick was referring to me. It happened approx. 11mi from BV heading towards Sandy Bay right next to a red bouy. Totally my fault not realizing heading downstream left of red right of green. Good luck, and have fun. Andy"
561477,birddogger,2006-10-02 14:24:00,43,"AO Same thing happened to me two years ago.I invested in a gps with navionics chip and dont regret it.Cheap insurance, buy yourself one for your Christmas gift. Good luck Birddogger"
