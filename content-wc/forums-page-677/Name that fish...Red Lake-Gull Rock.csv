Her first cast produced a 30"" walleye. She released it at the elbow. We have her photo posted on our web site. Beginners luck or fishing skills, Don now has a new fishing partner. Bill"

Suckers it is then. I've watched your posts and am pretty impressed with your knowledge about the area. I'm not doubting you, but how would you catch a sucker with a rod and reel? Just need to prove it to myself, I get a little bull headed when a fish out foxes me..."
561389,Guest,2006-09-26 09:50:00,0,"that is a good story. what's your site url so i can check out the 30"" eye?"
561391,bigfish1965,2006-09-26 17:17:00,3210,A large group stacked in a deep hole...my bet is certainly Lake Trout.Find them stacked in the summer like that all the time here.
561401,pikemike,2006-09-27 08:49:00,95,"could be, i guess the only way to know is to get one pulled up. it would be cool if they were lakers, but i can usually provoke them into grabbing a minnow. theses fishes have me stumped."
561410,Guest,2006-09-27 17:30:00,0,"I have seen and caught carp (accidently) in Red Lake, I know that in fhe fall they will school up in bends of rivers. This could explain not being able to catch the fish you saw on your depth finder"
561414,Minnow Man,2006-09-27 22:12:00,85,"The 30"" walleye can be seen @www.goldenhookcamp.com"
561425,pikemike,2006-09-28 14:16:00,95,"super nice fish, glad to hear it went back to produce even more ""super nice fish"". Congrats, the smile she shows says a lot!"

561504,Guest,2006-10-03 16:22:00,0,"Ling= Marrya, bottom dweller, Red Lake Catfish, poor man's lobster....We catch quite a bit in the winter.... good fight butt ugly"
561294,Guest,2006-09-21 14:42:00,0,didn't know there were ling in the system?
561303,Guest,2006-09-21 16:57:00,0,Quite a few Ling and Rock Bass too.
561314,bugsy,2006-09-22 05:54:00,49,Could be ling. Most northern lakes have them & walleyes feed on the smaller ones.

561317,Guest,2006-09-22 08:07:00,0,"I KNEW THERE WERE LING ON THE LAKES I FISH UP THERE (LITTLE VERMILION AND NUNGESSER), SO I FIGURED THEY WERE IN RED LAKE TOO... IF YOU EVER CATCH ONE ( IT LOOKS LIKE A CATFISH/EEL SCIENCE EXPERIMENT OR THE CREATURE THAT SHOT OUT OF PEOPLE'S CHESTS IN ALIEN.) CLEAN IT ! IT IS SOME OF THE BEST EATING YOU WILL FIND....."

561327,Guest,2006-09-22 09:24:00,0,"Huh, all very interesting. I wonder how you catch ling and why isn't there more fishing pressure for them..."
561333,Guest,2006-09-22 12:19:00,0,"Can catch ling with a variety of lures, jig/minnow, etc... Ling is a cold water fish though and generally associated with similar depths to lake trout (at least that's where we catch them). Almost always off the bottom. Unless the water temps were in the 50's at that spot I would venture a guess that the fish were not ling."
561335,Guest,2006-09-22 12:58:00,0,"My bet is white fish. Lings are a bottom fish. I've heard they are good eating , and I'm sure they are. The meat is white and clean looking. But I like most people think they are ugly as sin and I can't bring myself to want to eat one. We catch lots ice fishing for lakers when our lines are to close to the bottom."

561265,Guest,2006-09-20 13:04:00,0,"OK, this one is for the locals in the Gull Rock area. On a recent trip to Gull Rock this fall we noticed several fish on the screen that have ramped up my curiosity... Traveling upstream out of Keg Lake in the Chikuni(SP?) river, you come to a bend in the river where it turns west toward RL. Just right at the bend (we call it the elbow) there is an island. The main channel runs south of the island, but there is some deep water on the north side of the island. In that area north of the elbow island there is a hole that goes from 20' down to 35 or 40' deep. This is where the mystery fish are. These mystery fish are stacked up on the screen in all different sizes at all different depths 20-40 down. What are these fish? I've tried just about everything I can think of to hook one. I've done everything from jigging minnows to trolling cranks with lead core. No biters. The only thing that I can think of is that they might be whitefish... Has anyone else marked these fish or does anyone know what they are??"
561266,Renn,2006-09-20 13:18:00,87,Are they larger arcs or seem to be smaller? I know there is a growing population of smelt in the Red Lake/Gullrock Lake system. Just an idea. It will be interesting to hear what the locals have to say. Renn
561267,Guest,2006-09-20 13:27:00,0,"all sizes, everything that looks like a 40"" pike to a perch. ...yes, this post is a serious question. at first i thought you might be messing with me with the smelt answer, but then i vaguely remembered reading something years ago by an MNR officer about smelt in the RL chain. ...my money's on whitefish...never caught a whitefish on purpose in RL but I know they're there."
561270,Guest,2006-09-20 14:09:00,0,I've marked fish in the same hole in the Chukuni River and never been able to hook one. I too look forward to an answer from someone who has been more successful.
561271,Guest,2006-09-20 14:30:00,0,We'll have to meet up and take some blasting caps with us!
561273,sifty,2006-09-20 15:24:00,46,caught a 12lb sucker on gullrock this year. Thought it was Walter on the other end until I saw that ugly sucker head. We caught alot more perch than years past hope they don't take over. I was under the impression that walleyes of same length weighed more in redlake because of the smelt population.
561274,Renn,2006-09-20 16:34:00,87,I know a lot of the fish we caught this summer and fall on Gullrock spit up some type of fish that was about 4 inches long. I have never seen a smelt before but that's what I was told they were. All I know is the walleyes we caught this summer were a lot heavier than they have been in past years. Renn
561282,Hawgeye,2006-09-21 07:20:00,1355,"Are there catfish in the system? I have experienced this exact scenario at the river at Pine Falls right off the drop off where it enters the bay. I dropped a jig down and within two jigs, I hooked into a 15lb cat. Tried it again and caught a 12lb cat. Spent 5 minutes over this spot and caught 5 cats over 7lbs. Then I left cuz I was walleye fishin'.!!"
561285,Guest,2006-09-21 09:28:00,0,"nope, not cats in the system that I know of. Fish in the system are: eyes, northerns, perch, a few lakers, whitefish, and the rumored muskies. Did some searching, smelt were introduced about the time limits/slots changed. Part of the rejuvenating efforts. Cats can usually be provoked into taking a minnow, we also dropped crawlers on rigs at them...these fish are stubborn. also, these ones are suspended. Good guess, but they don't act like cats."
561286,Guest,2006-09-21 09:34:00,0,WHAT ABOUT A LING? DO THEY SCHOOL?
