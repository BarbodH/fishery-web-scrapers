523679,Guest,2002-08-22 14:06:00,0,Would like to hear from anyone that may have fished this lake in the last few years. Considering a trip there in 2003 with Bauer's outfitters. Mainly interested in quanity and quality of the walleye fishery. Would also be interested in hearing from anyone that may have stayed with Bauer's outfitting (either the main camp or their outpost).Thanks.
523680,Guest,2002-09-17 20:16:00,0,I fished it last summer and stayed at Pasha Lake lodge. It is a great lake but like Northwind as well.

I am considering doing a family trip there next june (we have in the past tent camped in the Armstrong area) but since i have a newborn, a cabin sounds way better to mom than a tent for a week. Any comments on the fishing around there? Walleye's, lakers, pike or brookies doesnt matter. I have been told there are many lakes in the area, but no first hand experience.Thanks for any info you can pass along about the resort and fishing around it.Xplorer"
523682,Guest,2002-09-18 12:20:00,0,"Re:Onoman Lakethere must be 30 or more walleye lakes within a 3 hour drive from Jellicoe, which makes for a nice overnight or long day trip. It is extremely difficult to help unless i know more of your preferences and the time of year you are coming. I fish those lakes myself. E-mail me at [email protected] I may be able to help."
523683,Xplorer,2002-09-19 04:51:00,244,"bigguy, I will e-mail you. I would most likely be looking at coming up the second week of June. Would like to fish within 30 miles of Pasha lake where i would have a cabin. We usually fish the Obonga river system south of Armstrong, and fish for walleye's,brookies,pike and whitefish. I really like fishing lakers also (may think about going up to pasha lake this winter and trout fishing a few days to get to know the area. Thanks for any help, will email in the next day. Xplorer"

This past june fished their for two days rented boats from Call of the North and fishing was slow had to work much harder for the fish. Still had a good time. Be prepared for the 1/2 hour walk into the lake."
523685,Guest,2002-09-30 12:39:00,0,I have done pasha lake resort and Bauers. Bauers is a fly in and Pasha lake is a long drive and walk. If you are intrested in either send me a email at [email protected] and I would be able to give you the scoop on both.
523686,Guest,2002-10-01 05:59:00,0,"I fished Onaman a few years ago through the ice and had a ball. Although we had some tough weather that weekend, we caught alot of walleyes regardless. I would highly reccommend staying at http://www.pashalake.com/ Darrell and Susie Splett are great people and will take care of you well here. They have great accomodations there. Darrell we put you on fish day in and day out. I will definately be back someday soon. Since then, I have sent several friends his way and they have all have mentioned that they will be back and it was one of their best trips they have ever had.Save a spot for us someday Darrell!!"
523687,Guest,2002-11-17 07:38:00,0,Bode:If you're still interested in going to Bauer's on onaman lake e-mail me at [email protected] I've been there the last 4 yrs in mid-June with family groups of 8-12.
