525530,Guest,2002-11-22 07:30:00,0,Anybody ever fish the english river by Minaki? When I was up there last year there were people staying at paradise cove and driving to the english river everyday. We drove there and it seemed close. Had to cross the dam. Would appreciate any info including lodging. Thanks
