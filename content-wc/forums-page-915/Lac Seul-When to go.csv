525503,Guest,2002-11-18 13:35:00,0,Going to Lac Seul. Have to decide between last week of June or third week of July. Overal which would be better and why thanks
525504,Walleye Wacker,2002-11-18 14:22:00,6,Walleye bite is good on lac Seul both of the weeks you have chosen...but June is best for Walleye.. Pike are easier to find at the end of July because the weed beds are easier to find and fishing in and aropund them will catch you plenty of toothy critters. Both species can be found the last week of June and I would pick it because in my opinoin it would be the better of the two weeks. Others will probably have different ideas but one thing is for sure Lac Seul is good even on a bad day!!!!! CATCH AND RELEASE

Early June is great, and late June can certainly be great as well if there is a really late spring. In the same vein, you might also hit a transition period between spring/summer that can scatter the fish and make them harder to catch/find, especially in post frontal situations. In July the fish are in their summer patterns and are easy to find. Classic main lake humps and points will be full of fish by then and if you want the bigger fish just fish a little deeper in the same spots where you are catching numbers of smaller fish (15-23""ers). In the early morning and evenings work shorline flats and drop offs in shallower water for piggies by trolling cranks or spinner rigs. It just doesn't get much easier. The bottom line is that stability in the walleyes world will make for a more consistent bite overall, and the weather in June is typically inconsistent. The seasonal change is also almost impossible to predict. If you hit June just right it can be some of the hottest fishing ever, or it could be slower than you'd think. I'd play the odds and go in July. Good luck! What part of the lake are you fishing?"
525506,Guest,2002-11-19 12:59:00,0,My vote is for July because the weather is more predictable and on Lac Suel you can catch plenty of fish anytime. Bottom line is I was up there the last week in July this year and fishing was great. Aside from the Walleyes my son and I caught 4 Northerns between 15 - 20 lbs on surface lures. And this was or first time on Lac Suel.Can wait till next year.Best Regards

If you have or rent a snowmobile there are ton's of lakes within 30mins of Lac Seul and the fishing is awesome.Nice Walleye and some great Brook Trout, and wicked Laker action to be had on the hard water.Get the boys together for a week in the winter, not sure where you can stay but I guarentee you will have the Best fishing time of your life."
525509,eyewitness,2002-11-19 20:36:00,680,"MikMac, I have been dying to get some info on where to go ice fish for some big eyes up there. Can you drop me an email so I can ask a few questions? I'd sure appreciate it."
