525460,Northern Manitoban,2002-11-15 13:32:00,195,"what i do is when starting out i will start trolling,its the quickest way to find fish,bottom bouncers with spinners etc.I look for points,weedy bays,rocky shorelines and reafs,even river outlets or creeks.I have caught alot of big walleyes around beaver huts also.Once i find them i will keep trolling over that spot back and forth.And you can even throw in the anchor and jig them once you find them.Getting a good map will cut down alot of time also.And of course talk to the people at the boat launch,alot of people will give you some good advice.FISH ON."
525461,retire55,2002-11-15 14:58:00,1029,"Babamel:There was a good article about how to fish new lakes for walleyes in the Sep-Oct-Nov 1999 Walleye Insider. You might be able to get a back order copy.The jist of the article for lakes was to find the main deep basins and then note what structures projected into those basins. Obvious basins with just a few dominant structures (bars) is what you're looking for. Look for a major bar that extends into relatively deep water. Then explore those bars and find any spots that concentrate walleyes. Fast breaking structures are optimum.I concur with Northern Manitoban comments. During the winter months, try to obtain a bathymetric (depth) map of the intended lake and study it. You'll be able to pre-select the areas of the lake to attack first. FWIW. Jay"
