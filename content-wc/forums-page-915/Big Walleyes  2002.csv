Trolling a firetiger bomber long a, on the river at Nipawin, right at dusk on the 14th of October. We just about froze our butts off, but it was worth it. Those are my two biggest walleyes ever and I didn't even consider keeping them. Maybe if I break 15 pounds I'll keep it for the wall. I can't wait to go back and try again next year."
524954,Jigger1,2002-11-18 15:41:00,234,"Two fat 28.5"" were the big dogs for me in 2002. My father-in-law boated a 29"" and a 31.5"" and both were hogs. In 4.5 days on Lac Seul the two of us snapped picures of 9 over 27"" all of which were released to be caught another day. Counting down the days to June 28, 2003 and dreaming about landing a 30."
524955,Barney,2002-11-19 09:27:00,0,"I didnt catch any Walleye this year but i got a nice 22' Carp and a bunch of fat 15"" Bullheads. Awful good year for me...usally I dont catch squat. Oh Yeah, Big Mike let me reel in some of his big Walleye this year...he is such a nice guy."
524956,Mahumba,2002-11-19 09:49:00,345,"First I'll admit that I don't go by weight really. I call my 30 inchers ten pounds.(average anyways) I've seen some weigh more and some weigh less when they are 30 inches but I figure it averages out.28 30 inchers 4 31 inches 1 32 inches and 1 33 inches.The absolutely best walleye was a 32 incher. It was cuaght by my 3 year old son and was his first fish ever!All in all it was a great year. The best in three years.These fish were taken from ""fished out"" lakes. Roger Mayer."
524943,Walleye Wacker,2002-10-17 06:41:00,6,With the 2002 season drawing to a end I thought it would be a good idea to hear about some big fish. This year was one of the best I have seen for years and I hope the rest of you had as much success and fun as I did. If you would please tell about your big one and where and when you caught it......Thanks
524944,BD,2002-10-17 15:01:00,739,"I'll start by being honest and say I didn't break the ten pound barrier this year. My partner did get a ten pounder while we were trolling for northerns on Marmion (near Atikokan, Ontario) the end of Sept. The piggy hit a firetiger Magnum Rapala. Marmion has had a zero limit on walleyes, CPR only, for several years. That piggy is there for us to catch again next year."
524945,Northern Manitoban,2002-10-17 15:13:00,195,"Been a great year for me caught six 10 pound walleyes last month and one 11 pounder. Odei river,northern Manitoba.All were released.FISH ON."
524946,bigfish1965,2002-10-17 22:43:00,3210,"While I didn't break 15 pounds this year ( dammit) we still did okay. Dozens over 10 and the biggest probably 12 and a bit. They seemed to be mostly the same year class. The year class giving us all the 14,15, and 16 pounders has probably all died of old age. Port Dalhousie, Lake Ontario."
524947,Guest,2002-10-18 18:46:00,0,my biggest this year was bout 10 pounds. got it on a bomber magnum. do you guys catch the majority of walleye on cranks? also i was wondering if you get any from shore?
524948,iamwalleye1,2002-10-19 16:19:00,1589,My wife boated her biggest ever of 9.7.
524949,Walleye Wacker,2002-10-21 08:24:00,6,"My new wife caught her first Walleye this year. It was 20"" long and you would have thought it was a new record. She went on to catch many more and make me happy by telling me she wants to do a lot more Walleye fishing. I can handle that..."
524950,Guest,2002-11-14 12:44:00,0,"I have to report my biggest Walleye ever....October 24...Red River, Selkirk........34.5""...15lbs 3oz.....RELEASED"
524951,Guest,2002-11-14 14:15:00,0,"NICE FISH!!! I humbly must say my biggest this year was 31"" long at Pine Falls. I would estimate around 11 1/2 lbs or so. I also caught a 29 1/2"" at the same spot a week earlier. this summer I picked up a 30""er on a small Minnesota lake which was by far a bigger trophy than those stocky greenbacks. The reason is you don't see a Minnesota eye top 10lbs very often. Aside from those 3 fish, it was a really tough summer for me."
524952,retire55,2002-11-14 14:20:00,1029,Congratulations to those of you fortunate enough to catch a prize walleye as well as for having the fortitude to release them. I happen to support releasing big walleye rather than harvesting them. Using cranks to catch them probably ensures a better chance of survival after catch and release. JayPS. Post not intended to be interpreted as critical of those who don't release big walleye. Each fisherman has the right to do what he thinks is right with his catch.
