525398,Hunter,2002-11-14 05:42:00,346,"If you think its a trophy, then its a trophy. You would need to score it to see where it stands. Things like spread, tine lenght, and points need to be measured, also typical or non-typical.An 11pt. buck is a nice deer anyway you look at it but yikes, $450 is pretty steep."
525399,Guest,2002-11-14 07:41:00,0,"How much did it weigh? Have it scored for the point total. Did he take it with a Bow or a Gun?I live in Illinois and am an avid Deer hunter. Our Bow season has been open since October. Shotgun ( we can't use rifles ) season opens next Friday. I went to the check station the other night and a guy had brought in a 9 point but the the rack was very very small. I thought to my-self why in the world would anyone shoot such a small rack. I had passed on many Deer that were bigger than that. I was about to give the guy a little poke about shooting ""Bambi"". When he said it was his first year Deer hunting and it was his first deer with a Bow. He then said he was going to mount it. To him it was a Trophy. And that is really the point. Because there will always be a bigger rack.If your friend want's to mount it he should. If he doesn't think so or doesn't want to spend ($350.00 is a good price here ) just keep the rack.IvyI"
525400,eyedoktr,2002-11-14 08:12:00,2426,"Ivy, I don't want to start anything here and I'm not being judgemental. I just wonder why you pass up nice deer? Personally, I've never thought the antlers tasted that good :-). Here in NY they have an abundance of does to the extent they gave everyone who wanted them, 2 free antlerless only deer permits."
525401,Guest,2002-11-14 08:58:00,0,"Pete,Yeah I re-read my e-mail and it kind of sounded like I was just in it for the antlers. I'm not. The area I live in Illinois has a fair amount of Deer but I would not characterize our area as over populated. At the moment I have the luxury to hunt a 100 acre parcel that is on the edge of town and I can walk to my stand in 15 minutes from my back door. I pass on the smaller racks as a personal choice. There is a Deer Management Group called ""Quality Deer Management"". Their motto is ""Let him go so he can grow."" And I subscribe to that philosphy. I do shoot Does though and have already filled my Doe tag. If we were over run with Does, I could/would shoot more. In fact we have a program in Illinois where I could drop off the Deer to the Processor and I can donate the Deer to the Food Bank. The State will even pay for the $35.00 processing fee.So far this year I have had some great opportunities that just didn't work out ( that's code for getting busted by the deer ). But more importantly I have enjoyed watching the wildlife and decompressing while sitting up in my stand. I am not a Trophy hunter but simply trying to manage a herd that occupies the ground on which I hunt. I have 2 antler tags I can fill ( 1-Bow and 1-Shotgun ) and I am holding out for a large rack. If it does not happen I can live with it. And thennext year my maybe those deer will be bigger.Ivy"
525402,eyedoktr,2002-11-14 09:30:00,2426,"Ivy, thanks for the reply.Quality Deer Management definitely works when done properly. I'm trying to convince my older brother of that. He owns about 300 acres of prime deer and turkey land and his theory is don't shoot the turkey until there are lots and lots and don't shoot the does so they can be around and make more deer. I'm glad to see that you're an educated hunter with a plan for future generations."
525403,Guest,2002-11-14 09:53:00,0,"Pete,Have your brother check out www.qdma.com . With 300 acres he could have a pardise! Ivy"
525404,Guest,2002-11-14 12:27:00,0,"I dont know where to get it scored?...It was taken on private land,275-300yards;30-06.I would also like to thank the lady down the powerline for feeding them.Is there a site that could help me? THANKS HANK"
525405,Guest,2002-11-14 13:27:00,0,"Hank,We shoot Deer at 100yds tops using a slug. At 300yds all I could do is waive at him ..........or curse him.Try this article you can pull it up on-line ( I think ).http://www.edersbow.com/publication/...re/default.cfmIf that doesn't work, type in Scoring Antlers on your search engine.Ivy"
525406,Rick,2002-11-14 15:53:00,226,"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I've got a decent 9 pt. (10 with one broken) on the wall. I've seen lots bigger and smaller.$450 Canadian doesn't seem bad. Around here, its $300 - $375 US for a wall mount."
