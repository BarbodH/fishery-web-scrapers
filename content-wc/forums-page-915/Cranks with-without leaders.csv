525372,Guest,2002-11-12 09:25:00,0,Hey wondering how you handle this situation that seems to keep happening to me.Early season trolling the inlet of a creek/river into a lake in NW Ont. There is a channel that follows the in flow of water but it sits on a soft bottom bay. The channel runs 10-20 feet while the surrounding bay is shallow 5-8 feet. Many times we have luck for big Eyes while following the channel with 7-9 shad raps. Every year I loose several big Northerns that come out of the shallows to chase down my raps. It is frustrating to fight a big one for 15 minutes only to loose the darn thing more than half the time due to cutting the line. I always skip the leader when using Raps feeling the action will be messed up. Is this true?Not that I am a big Northern fisherman. Once in a while during mid day I will have some fun with them but my real questions is: Do most Walleye fisherman use leaders with their Raps while fishing Walleye? Is there a better way to handle this situation...different leaders that work better with Raps?Bob

Have had no bite-offs and have caught some very nice fish, both walleyes and northern, so I don't think it must be affecting the action of the bait too much, if any."
525375,Guest,2002-11-12 13:07:00,0,"I use inviso leaders from Walmart when I know there are big northerns to be caught. I also use 20# fireline when trolling and it will help, but they still can cut it. The problem with the leaders are they get kinked and then do not run true, so you have to keep changing them. I hate to have a big fish with a bait in its gills, so I would go to a small diameter leader. What area do you fish? Good luck,"
525376,Karl,2002-11-12 19:57:00,63,"I've also used Berkeley ""Invisi leaders"" from Wal-Mart with all crankbaits for years now. They have absolutely no effect on the action of the lure and will save you a lot of money on crankbaits. I occasionally use them (5"" 8lb) with jigs when northerns are pesky. The walleye don't care.Best part is they are cheap and work.I've looked at the titanium leaders. First of all, the leader shouldn't cost three times as much as the crankbait I'm trying to protect. Secondly, there's no way to make titanium ""invisible"". Thirdly (is that a word?), I gave up on overrated televised fishing accessories years ago. Cheaper can be better."

525378,Karl,2002-11-15 17:29:00,63,I stand corrected. Thanks Bo.
