525521,Walleye Wacker,2002-11-19 12:07:00,6,Thinking about going ice fishing around Selkirk for Walleye this year. When is the best time to go??? Thanks in advance...
525522,walleyedude,2002-11-19 20:12:00,34,"First ice is usually hot.The river is starting to thicken up now,some guys have already been out but the ice is only 3-4"" thick.It will be good until X-mas,then die until March when the bite picks up again.Hotspots include Willow Springs,the flats north of the bridge to nowhere, the old boys home,Sugar Island and Doc Reeds.Lockport can be good too,except it is mostly saugers and small walleyes.Good luck!"
