The cabins are only a few years old, ideal for up to 4 adults, well furnished/supplied and very comfortable. The Camp owners could not have been more accommodating. They did everything they could to ensure that we had a pleasant stay; however, they couldn't control the 5 days of rain which rapidly raised the lake level. The lake and river system have a lot to offer. Some terrific scenery, sparsely populated, lots of structure and plenty of depth. As a result of the extreme weather conditions our fishing was difficult; however, we did have some results with walleye,smallmouth and norterns on the few nicer days we had. We brought our own boat but the Camp's rentals appeared to be very well maintained. The only negative that comes to mind was the walk down to the dock. With that much rain the path got a bit dicey. Our photo used to be on their web site...we're the four guys standing in the boat dockside dressed in winter garb. Tried to return last summer but they were all booked up. Hope to go back in 03 and give the place another try. Good luck. Ken"

Good walleye, pike and smallmouth bass fishing.We had good weather for 2 out of the 3 years, and did well...theowners encourage C&R on the ""trophy"" fish, and I commend them fortheir approach. My son caught an 18 lb pike, and released it at thedock. I also brought up my own boat 2 out of 3 years, and used acamp boat last year. The camp boats are OK for up to 2 people, butI wouldn't fish 3 out of them as they are about 15'.This lake is 99% crown land, with only a few private cabins; and hasa good size river feeding the lake. I'd recommend this camp for either a fishing trip with your buddies, and is also great for afamily vacation with kids. They have a ramp at the camp, and alsoa sauna for the later evenings; and a very nice fish cleaning hut.If you're seriously interested, I'd book early because it fills upevery year. I found the camp on a websearch 4 years ago, and recommendthis camp to my friends. Email me if you'd like more info."
