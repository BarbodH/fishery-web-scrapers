525493,BD,2002-11-18 07:01:00,739,ggg; It's been a long time since I've seen you on this board. How did you do this year? Did you make it to Press Lake or pass it up for someplace else? I fished several lakes that are part of the Seine River system in the Atikokan area the end of Sept. My partner got a 10lb. eye when we were trolling for northerns. I nailed some big northerns including one that broke my fliping rod. I guess with that heavy line I shouldn't have had the drag set up so high. Sorry I can't help you on Burntwood Lake Lodge. Go Walleye has a lot of users from the western provinces. You might try there also.

Lots of small walleye but the staff was nice. A week later I went back to Maynard Lake. Always great at that place! 58 walleyes caught and released before noon on one day, all over 18"". 40"" and 41"" northern jigged up from 40' down on 8 lb. test. Press was excellant but I have to keep exploring ! Looking at Burntwood, Knee Lake, or North of Sixty Camps this year. Only going to take 1 trip with my son for his HS graduation present. Hey good luck deer hunting !"
