I was wondering if anyone reading this stays at or has stayed at Moore Bay lodge in the past and could give me a way of contacting them. i am looking to book a reservation with them and need some help.Thank you,Brett Ferguson"

My hazy memory has it catering North Americans as well as Europeans. The overseas guests flew into Winnipeg and the lodge handles road and boat travel arrangements for the guest. I think the proprietor stays in Germany in the off season.
