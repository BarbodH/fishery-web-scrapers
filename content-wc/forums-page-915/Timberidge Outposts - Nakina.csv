525495,Guest,2002-11-17 20:29:00,0,Has anyone fished with Timberidge fly-in service out of Nakina? What lakes? How were the cabins and service? Interested in private lakes with lots of big northern pike? Any suggestions? Also what about Luenburgers(spelling) Fly-in Outposts? Thank You

525497,Guest,2002-11-18 14:03:00,0,"I've never fished at any of their cabins/lakes, but fly with them each year into someone else's camp. The planes, pilots, and staff are all top notch."

525501,AL,2002-11-18 19:54:00,89,I fished Crayon Lake with Timberidge two years ago. The lake was good but as they advertise for this one a bit on the small size. The cabin could use some work but was usable. Most of the Walleye were on the smaller size but did catch some rather large pike.
525499,Guest,2002-11-19 05:01:00,0,Retire55:I'm pretty sure that's not Leuenburger's that's for sale. I think it's the flight and camp service just down the road from their base. They have never been that busy when ever I'm up there and the photo looks like their place.dennis
525500,phidelt157,2002-11-19 08:15:00,191,"It is Leuenberger's that is for sale, I just talked to Claudine. The price tag is 6.5 mill. If anyone wants to go in on it, I can front 50 dollars now, if you'll get the rest. I'll get you back when we turn our first profit, promise.157"
525502,515,2002-11-22 07:54:00,254,"There right it is Leuenbergers for sale. I've had great trip with them and hope it never changes but thats life i guess. Can't believe the price of it 6 mil+ for the planes and 14 outposts and then another 4 mil+ for the resort and one plane. Anyways as for the fishing there i've always had great luck, i can't comment on any others in the area though. I've been hooked on leuenbergers since my first trip there and haven't had any reason to change from them yet. Good LuckSmokey"
