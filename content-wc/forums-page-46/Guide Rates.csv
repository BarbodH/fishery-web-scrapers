6657366,prov1800,2022-05-19 07:50:00,5010,Agree to that.Fishing potholes is a lot different than a big lake like LS or say Eagle.Ive always enjoyed fishing different lakes in my area.Before all the big boats and electronics.But loved it.eceryday was a adventure.Now with my bigger boat and electronics and the know how I can take guests to a number of lakes and pretty confident on most days they will have a good time.If you got enough money and need a relaxing day why not.500 is also a lot cheaper than a 5-6000 lower unit for a safe route.
6657368,walleyecheek,2022-05-19 07:54:00,2231,&#x1f923; a guide with no boat is like a taxi cab with no gas in it ! A guide gets in my boat they'll be paying me !&#x1f923;
6657384,FishFry2012,2022-05-19 08:46:00,27,What would make a camp poorly run? I've gone to the same camp for 15 years and always been treated well.

6657416,proguidedream,2022-05-19 11:24:00,345,"18 foot lund alaskan with a 40 tiller , or most fly-ins will run a 14-16ft 25hp or under. unless its a real 5-star fly in... but then we wouldnt be talking about money. crawfords camp in souix narrows that will rent you a very nice full windshield with 115 yamaha, graph , trolling motor for $1400 a week , and 50 hp boats for $1000 a week. if you only want to fish one or two weeks a year , that is cheaper than owning a boat ! Musky is about the only fresh water fish i would pay for a guide. or a real northern lake trout lake with 50+ pound fish potential"
6657418,rjthehunter,2022-05-19 11:25:00,154,"Wait, are people actually paying for a guide to come fishing with them??? You're saying I could make $200 to go ride with someone and fish? No risk for the guide. Customer supplies the boat, gas, bait, rods, and anything else. I just show up and point at a map! I should get in to that type of guiding!"
6657444,Old Timer,2022-05-19 13:48:00,255,"Fish fry: Sure, there are many good operators. In fact, most are. In all my years I've been disappointed with an operator less than a handful of times. But going to the same lake for fifteen years? Sounds like the same old lake, same narrows, same rapids, same rock bar, same cookie-cutter fish. I suspect that works for you. But for me, I'd be bored silly. There are only a few Canadian lakes I have fished repeatedly. One I have spoken about in other posts. Anytime you can catch 28-31 inch fish on just about every trip, that lake deserves added attention. However, I don't go there anymore because it's size productivity has seemed to have drifted down a bit. One lake that never tires me is LOTW. One guy can't learn that lake in a lifetime. And any lake where you can get lost if you're not paying attention (and hit a rock) is a lake of adventure. And for me, the times I've used a guide on that lake has never been wasted money because I learn so much. Another is Dubwant Lake in the NW Territories. It's truly in a league of its own. Expensive for sure. But if a guy passes on three ordinary fly-in trips he can afford one trip to Dubwant. But each to his own. I get it. But a lake has to be pretty special for me to repeat more than a few times."
6657746,Pat,2022-05-20 10:46:00,203,"I've used a guide a few times, especially up north, the first time on a lake (been going for 60-ish years or so). For the bulk of that time it's with my own boat. One of the biggest reasons I get a guide for new waters is to pick the brain of the guide related to lake hazards. Of course you get Intel on fishing spots and techniques too for that water. But I want to quickly learn where I can go at speed on the new waters and where caution is needed. Nothing more deflating than taking out your lower unit the first day or so into your fishing trip."
6657754,Mojo-NC,2022-05-20 11:13:00,1929,"I think a guide can be worth their weight in gold in the right situation, especially when you are fishing new water, and definitely on big water. They always know where the fish are now, not last week or last year, and what techniques to use to maximize your catch rate. As others have mentioned, they also know where the hazards are as well. Our first year up to Canada we used a guide nearly every day and the days we didn't we wish we would have. One of those days I challenged our guide to a smallmouth fishing competition. He put on a smallmouth fishing clinic that day and put the smackdown on me. I learned a lot from him that day, not just how to eat crow."
6657758,Maverick31,2022-05-20 11:14:00,9,"I don't think there is any substitute for the local knowledge that a guide gives you. I really like to fish with a guide the first day of a trip. On our 17-day fishing expedition in 2017, we drove 3500 miles from Georgia to Ontario and return, fished 5 different lakes and a river for 5 different species. That trip covered Ontario territory from Kenora to Red Lake, to Nipigon. We used 2 different guides on 2 of the big lakes, and they got us started right without any wasted motion. I would highly recommend a guide to start the trip. Can't wait for our June trip this year. Tight Lines."
6657140,Eckohlt,2022-05-18 10:11:00,3685,"Sept 24 I'm flying into Abamasagi lake,with twin lake outfitters.So no go this year."
6657230,proguidedream,2022-05-18 14:49:00,345,"i agree that it seems like sticker shock . but it also depends on what you are after,, if you want to catch 40+ walleyes a day, there are a hundred places you can go do that in Canada at a camp that will rent you a boat for much less. bring your own food, simple cabin, simple boat rental, it is probably only a couple hundred a day. if your staying at a lodge or even a fly-in that provides guides, with simple small boats that is probably to expensive. if your wanting a day trip on a place like lake of the woods, now your asking a guy to meet you at the ramp, drive likely 20-40 miles on the water if your fishing a fish like musky, provide lunch, its not a bad hourly rate considering the expenses involved. if your looking for a simple stay in a cabin , and less expensive boat rental, with good fishing, feel free to PM and i will share."
6657254,prov1800,2022-05-18 15:37:00,5010,What is your version of simple small boats
6657256,RichA$1970,2022-05-18 16:12:00,1159,"I enjoy being on my own and learning on my own. Depth finder, lake map and school of hard knocks is what I prefer. Nothing against a guide if you need one, but Ontario is special enough to me I’d rather be on my own or with a good buddy to pass the time."
6657266,Old Timer,2022-05-18 16:35:00,255,"I've fished Canada for more than sixty years and almost entirely on my own. But there have been occasions when I've used one native guide on Lake of the Woods even though I know that lake quite well. The current cost is $200/day U.S. and that includes a terrific open-fire shore lunch. The boat and motor is a separate expense. The $200 (for two fishermen) is well spent. I always learn new spots, new rocks and usually do as well as well or better than I would do on my own. Plus there is none of the usual anxiety of navigating the LOTW minefield even when I know the safe routes. I used to poo-poo guides like others do but not anymore. Although I seldom use my guy, I thoroughly enjoy the outing every time out. And always worth the cost."
6657282,reddemon2,2022-05-18 17:32:00,255,"That's just for the guide in their boat, and if it's a camp boat that's extra"
6657298,Old Timer,2022-05-18 18:03:00,255,"The guide fee I mentioned was $200. A camp boat with a 20-30hp, bait and gas runs about $250. So all in about $450/day. If you're looking for a program with a big windshield boat the cost goes up another $100-150/day. Sure, pricy for one fishermen. But if you divvy it up among two or three the cost is manageable. And you're going to catch fish. If you strike out on your own for the first time on big water like Rainy or LOTW you may very well catch few or none. In my mind that's a very expensive trip."
6657304,Eckohlt,2022-05-18 18:55:00,3685,"Old timer I beg to differ with you,you've been fishing 60 years I know you know how to fish and I know you know how to find fish,so either you have more money than you know what to do with or your buying someone to talk to,that's an expensive chat,I've been fishing 60 years in Ontario and I need a guide like a seeing eye dog needs a boss with 20'20 vision."
6657306,Obabikon,2022-05-18 18:57:00,2370,A guide with no boat here is $250/day. Gas and boat rentals though will jack that up above $400 very easily.... depending on the boat.
6657358,Old Timer,2022-05-19 07:29:00,255,"Ecko: Sure, you don't need a guide if you repeatedly go to the same old lakes and the same old spots. But branch out on to new big water and it's a different story. Most of my Canada fishing friends go to the same old lakes and the same old spots even though they stay at a poorly run camps. They complain about the operators all the time, but still return. When I ask why, the answer is always the same. We don't want to risk not catching fish if we go someplace else. I've heard that reason a million times."
6656968,prov1800,2022-05-17 18:11:00,5010,You and everyone else.lol.
6656970,That Minnesota guy,2022-05-17 18:12:00,8293,I would expect nothing less from a guide.
6656972,prov1800,2022-05-17 18:14:00,5010,I've been fishing solo most of the last 2 years.It is pretty nice.
6656974,prov1800,2022-05-17 18:16:00,5010,It's true.All camps hand out lake maps from info from guests and guides over the years.I know cause most I found 30 yrs ago.Those spots are like a tim Horton coffee shop now
6657028,Hook_settr,2022-05-18 04:36:00,127,"I agree with John. I love fishing by myself. There’s only two guys other than my dad that I I’ll invite out fishing because I want someone that’s capable and dedicated. Plus, when I’m fishing by myself I go when and where I want and fish how I want without having to take anyone else into consideration. I almost always catch more fish by myself."
6657070,Golden Eagle,2022-05-18 07:36:00,2642,"Either is great. Over the years, I've fished 3 lakes in NW Ontario for a total of 7 days, with the same Canadian guide. I observed his actions and listened to every workd he said. I took notes, kept them in a file and check them often. He turned me into something I couldn't have done on my own. You guys who fish alone are crazy. Welcome to my club. A tank of fuel in the bow of my boat will be my fishing partner on this one. The guy who took me on my first fly in back in August 1972 asked to be on this trip, but his wife and doctor want him closer to medical attention due to his health issues. October is my favorite time for solo fishing. My 1460 mile drive to Red Lake is being made solo this time so I can go in 2 days early and stay in camp an extra week if that's what I decide to do. Fishing with a good guide is great. Fishing solo is great. Do both. Lots of times."
6657076,Eckohlt,2022-05-18 07:46:00,3685,Eagle I'm gonna hook up with you in the future in oct.
6657082,NWwalleye,2022-05-18 07:51:00,223,Guide rates haven't really gone up ..I would think that the prices you mentioned are for a guide and boat rentals. Not just the fee for the guide. I would be doing great if 50% of that came my way. Which it doesn't..
6657100,rjthehunter,2022-05-18 08:24:00,154,"Let me guess, $400 for a half day, 600 to 700 for a full day? Pretty on par with the rates in the Midwest. I guide because I enjoy teaching people about fishing and getting into more specifics on why fish are where they're at etc. I'm not doing it because of the money. It's not that great. After the price of gas, bait, insurance, equipment, etc. there's really not a ton of money in it around here. Most people who are going on a guided trip are just looking to get out and spend some time on the water. It's usually not people who are outfitted to do the fishing on their own."
6657108,Golden Eagle,2022-05-18 08:33:00,2642,Be careful of what you say. 2 boats some days. 1 boat a couple of times. September 24 week looks good to me in 2022. Go in when bow hunters show up and leave when they finish their hunt. I have a 3 day obligation in early October that keeps me down yonder in Tennessee this year. New moon September 25. My favorite. Outfitter will jump onto a 2 man booking for fishing since he'll be hauling bow hunters.
6656916,reddemon2,2022-05-17 17:02:00,255,"I understand the last 2yrs were tough, but **** guide rates are pricey, Finding anywhere between $450-800 per day USD Finding a place to go for a single guy is tough to find"
6656922,That Minnesota guy,2022-05-17 17:30:00,8293,You don't need a guide. You found your way to a lodge you will find fish. Ask your lodge owner I'm positive he could give you a few pointers to get started with.
6656924,reddemon2,2022-05-17 17:32:00,255,Fishing solo is a bit risky
6656928,That Minnesota guy,2022-05-17 17:36:00,8293,In which way? Finding fish or if something were to happen on the water?
6656932,reddemon2,2022-05-17 17:38:00,255,"i wouldn't have a problem finding fish, it's the other things beyond my control"
6656934,Eckohlt,2022-05-17 17:40:00,3685,"The best guide I ever bought is a helix 5 depth finder,learn how to use it n read it,no guide needed.if you go in the fall you can find plenty places for one."
6656940,reddemon2,2022-05-17 17:45:00,255,No boat
6656942,walleyecheek,2022-05-17 17:45:00,2231,"Friend of mine always referred to fishing in Canada was like fishing in a bath tub ! Don't need bait, dont need Depth finder !"
