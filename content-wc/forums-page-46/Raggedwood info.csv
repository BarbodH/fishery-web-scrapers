Had to change previously planned trip to accommodate all of my brothers as we take dad on one last trip (got a bad diagnosis this winter). Appreciate any information on the lake, tips/techniques and how this spring will play out with water level and cool weather! Want to make this one something special. Thanks!!"

Was hard not to catch them. I didn't count how many fish we caught, but my buddy and I instead decided to count how many 'doubles' we had. For our five day trip I think we were in the 110-120 range. I think we fished through Winoga, so we were on the island cabin in the central part of the lake. I think we were there at a similar time of year, and we seemed to have good luck in the 13-16 FOW range. A couple spots I remember, heading south-west from the cabin, you'll pass through two narrow-ish sections of the lake. After the 2nd narrow section, we fished the NW shoreline in ~13 FOW and just caught fish non-stop. Like directly across from the heart-shaped point that sits on the eastern shore. Other spot I vaguely remember:- The big island north of the cabin, we fished the North and NE corners of that and did really well. - If anyone is up for an adventure, we beached our boat where the lake dumps into a creek on the SW corner. Follow the creek through the woods and you'll eventually come to a small lake(careful as there's some rapids on one side of the creek). We casted jigs from shore to the bottom of the rapids and just caught fish one after another. Buggy, but was a cool experience."
