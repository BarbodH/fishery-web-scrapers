6657866,Hunts1,2022-05-20 19:00:00,123,AMEN Brother!!!
6658020,Lakefront,2022-05-21 09:39:00,179,I'm glad to hear that the camp's fill rate is up this year. We have our vaccines- do they still require the 24-48 hour Covid tests?
6658022,prov1800,2022-05-21 09:50:00,5010,No.just proof of vaccination.
6656440,SweetD,2022-05-16 10:01:00,243,"I think if camp owners and those headed up keep it in perspective in terms of having everything perfect/ready with this crazy weather and high water levels everything will be fine. I said to our outfitter the other day 95% of guys coming just want a bed, a boat and a place to poop……everything else is nice to haves!!!!&#x1f60e;"
6656454,Eckohlt,2022-05-16 10:39:00,3685,"I'm sure he will have the bed n boat,the other request could be tough."
6656558,Old Timer,2022-05-16 15:27:00,255,"I have a big circle of friends and contacts who routinely fish Canada. Unfortunately, I know of more people who have elected not to return to Canada, as opposed to those who actually are going this summer. How many are welching on rollover deposits? More than I few, I suspect but haven't asked."
6656564,Mr Ranger,2022-05-16 15:34:00,272,The camp we got go to is pretty much full except for some of the hot months which is normal. Different mix of folks but camp is pretty much as usual. Rule are the rules no big deal if you want to go. Have a safe summer.
6656654,Eyes_R_Us,2022-05-16 19:25:00,66,"We are going up twice this year which we have never done before. The first trip is in less than 2 weeks and the second one is during our regular week later in the summer. I will also be spending a day with a guide on our early trip. That will be a new experience as I have never had a guide before. Maybe the nano-technology in that vaccine is ""MAKING"" me go up there and chase fish. Those fish haven't seen a Lindy rig or Mepp's spinner for 2 years and I feel it is my duty to get up there and train them before they open up the border to everybody. I locked in our two trips in January and sent our deposits. Even with the high water, bait situation, bird flu, or whatever excuse I can't imagine calling them at this point and backing out."
6656952,drlee,2022-05-17 17:56:00,409,"One of my camps just posted vacancies for the season. Beginning right after opening week, every following week has only 1 opening each. When you get to Sept./Oct. it does thin out, but still busy. There are 7 cabins in this drive in, but remote, walleye, northern, small mouth 10,000 acre lake with additional 2 boat in smaller lakes.Long history of return customers. I am thrilled for them!"
6656960,SweetD,2022-05-17 18:05:00,243,What is the lake or outfitter DrLee???
6656978,Eckohlt,2022-05-17 18:26:00,3685,Check your PM
6657342,eyecatcher1,2022-05-19 05:55:00,323,Moosehorn Lodge in Sioux Lookout posted some open dates on their FB page a couple of days ago.
6657398,drlee,2022-05-19 09:27:00,409,Press Lake Camp. Google it.
6656306,RichA$1970,2022-05-16 02:11:00,1159,"If you or your party are not getting poked that’s perfectly fine with me, but they should have notified the camp owners at the first of the year. I suspect some were thinking Canada would follow suit with European countries that have waived this (imo stupid requirement). Another factor for those flying in is having to find a Covid test center to test you 1 day before flying back into the states as I had to do it returning from Thailand this week which was a complete goat rodeo, $125 & just an inconvenience in my situation (hopefully this gets waived) however the flights fromBangkok to Doha, Chicago & Bloomington were packed and no open seats. I know there are rules but it’s too bad there wasn’t a forum on here similar to Share a Seat but more like Last Minute Opening / Stand Bye that resorts could post on. It might be a challenge to be able to get a whole group to have time off for an extra week and then gas prices went up since 3 weeks ago when I left which is another excuse. Still no reason to leave your camp owner hanging like what’s being reported. Heck, we have a camp owner that won’t respond to us still after emails and phone calls as he jacked our trip up >20% in December before all the crap hit the fan with oil so will be stopping by to see him in Red Lake on June 5 before we fly out with Chimo to Hornby. He has time to post on Facebook and is getting a lot of PR from the Ontario Experience show as they must have gotten a free trip from him to say how great they are."
6656310,btyreprich,2022-05-16 03:53:00,1067,My friend owns the boat and I choose to go along with him at this point in time. This and the fact that our sons are not able to go this year so it'll just be myself and the boat owner.
6656316,Eckohlt,2022-05-16 04:36:00,3685,"Welcome back,coming back from one country n getting ready to go to another soon.should be a slaughter at good ole Hornby."

6656326,stjoeguy,2022-05-16 05:13:00,979,"Winoga Lodge on Lake St. Joseph called me recently with an opening July 2 - 9. For that group it's not a vaccination issue, but some other family issue that just came up. I'd usually try to put together a group, but that's when our kids and grandkids are visiting us. One group's change of plans is another group's opportunity to try another lake. It's a short, finite season for these camps and the last couple of years have been tough them, so I hope all the camps can fill out these openings."
6656346,Bill Krejca,2022-05-16 05:52:00,6107,"Besides those having an aversion to going due to vaccines and Canada rules, the price of gas is probably causing a number of folks to just throw in the towel. Due to the fact that rising gas prices in return raises everything else (everything else) it certainly causes folks to rethink where/how they want to spend their money. Back in 2008, or so, my trips to Snow Lake, Manitoba were stopped, due to the long ride and increased, at that time, gas prices. Couple that with border rules, and an aging fishing cliental, and a reduction in Canadian visits becomes a reality. I'll be heading up in September, God willing. Bill"
6656374,Knutson21,2022-05-16 06:48:00,348,"I did the math the other day. My vehicle will cost an additional $150 dollars in fuel than it should due to gas prices. If 3 guys are travelling that's only $50 each. I will tell you for $50 bucks you are not taking my week of fishing in Canada. Its not just about the fishing, its also a week where my work phone doesn't ring and I breath clean air."
6656376,prov1800,2022-05-16 07:05:00,5010,This opening week is going to be interèsting.Most camp owners are scrambling to get ready.the high water has hit about every camp.Be interesting to see who really shows up.
6656398,prov1800,2022-05-16 08:20:00,5010,Great attitude.
6656422,nitroman,2022-05-16 08:59:00,368,Unfortunately yes.
6656250,NARDA 1,2022-05-15 17:02:00,636,Are the Lodges you are connected with experiencing a lot of cancellations?
6656252,Camoclad,2022-05-15 17:19:00,628,"Yes, mostly due to the vaccine requirement as I understand it. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6656254,btyreprich,2022-05-15 17:39:00,1067,"We just cancelled out of our August trip to Lac Seul as several of the group members are not vaccinated and have no plans to do so. We will fish Rainy Lake out of International Falls. I hope Canada drops the vaccination requirement next year, but I doubt the Prime Minister will do this. Their country / their rules."
6656258,prov1800,2022-05-15 17:53:00,5010,.So why don't the vaxxed guys go to Canada.Seems dumb to me to ruin a trip because of someone else.
6656262,PRO-V16,2022-05-15 18:02:00,454,"I agree. We got vaxed plus the second booster. If you don't want to, stay home. Somebody else's decision won't affect my trip. I ain't dead yet from the vax and don't know anyone that is."
6656264,Camoclad,2022-05-15 18:12:00,628,"What's left of my group is coming but two of the 4 have already said this is the last one for them (age not vaccine). Don't know what will happen down the road. I will still come, with another group as an add on I suppose. Fortunate to have a few buddies who have invited me for 2022 and 2023 trips.

6656266,kettyspanky,2022-05-15 18:16:00,271,"I agree with the last couple of posts. Everyone has to decide whether to get vaxxed or not. Either way it would not change my plans. I enjoy the chance to go to canada every year. If my couple fishing buddies said they were not getting poked, that would be fine but I'd be going with or without them. Good luck to you all wherever you are going. I know where I'll be July 23rd."
6656270,Eckohlt,2022-05-15 18:23:00,3685,"I'm getting my 2nd booster this week,frickin things don't even phase me.like other posts ain't nothin keeping me from going.I'd go alone if it comes down to that."
6656276,SweetD,2022-05-15 18:39:00,243,"Total B-S if people are holding reservations this late knowing that requirement remains in place. These outfitters need confirmed guests and now are going to left hanging. Inexcusable and absolutely ignorant IMO not too mention completely selfish as F to do that to these outfitters many of which have carried deposits and are doing everything they can to save their business and their industry that so many of us love.Sad, disgraceful and just not right!I hope whoever does this had a 50% deposit down and they don’t get a dime back nor are they allowed to carry it to a future trip!WOW is all I can say!!!"
6656294,bthomas3333,2022-05-15 20:55:00,465,I have spoken with 5 different lodges/camp owners. Yes cancellations are up and they are happening later than normal leaving them with a deposit but little to no chance to fill the slot. What they really need is for the guys who normally go once to go twice and fill some of these open slots. This super busy year is looking above average but not the huge win they need. It really is sad all the way around. B-
