6656624,OneStevieG,2022-05-16 18:20:00,2,"Heading up for the opener. Fly in lake on river system. Usually fish both lake and the river. Bass, Walleye, Pike, Trout. I Am told the water is several feet high everywhere. What do the experts on here say about tips and tricks during extreme high water conditions this time of year."

6656640,Riding high,2022-05-16 18:36:00,69,In 2014 when the water was high like now we caught some of the biggest smallmouths casting jig and worm up close to shore. Walleye fishing was tough that week. The best walleye fishing was on a slip sinker and Phelps floater. Cast and let it sit reel a little let it sit.
6656646,SweetD,2022-05-16 18:58:00,243,If current is expected to be faster would think heavier jig might be in order. I always prefer as light as I can go (1/8 oz is my favorite) but may need some heavier arsenal to keep it on bottom if fishing river system. I would think incoming water spots maybe push back from those immediate intake areas and concentrate on those areas further back that are more manageable to fish and where there are still fish to lurk. Warm water bays with exposure to the sun all day and moving water would be my focus. The traditional year in and year out spots I’m sure could be impacted but probably not by much. Don’t be afraid to fish shallower than you might think in the Spring. We have caught alot of really nice fish in 4-6’ of water where water has been banging a shoreline point or small bay for a day or two. Good luck
6656650,Pooch,2022-05-16 19:20:00,4618,"No advice for fishing high water, but most lakes will be full of floaters. Lots of shore dead fall will have floated out into the lake and wind changes will be moving it from one area to another.Was on LS a few years ago during high water. Never ran WOT as there was a LOT of ""just under the surface"" logs. Hit them constantly all week. Even running at a cautious speed they really made a ""Thump"" when going over them. Then the next thing they hit was the lower unit and prop.Just saying....Pooch"
6656652,Luckydawg13,2022-05-16 19:21:00,363,I find in high water (river) look for cleaner water probably closer to shore also slower side of the river with less current good luck &#x1f44d;
6656776,stumcfar,2022-05-17 08:24:00,451,I concur with the previous post. Try find some slacker water shallower near shore. Fish slack water and eddies in close out of the main current. Anchored with a jig and minnow should work. Try bring a couple anchors to make sure you hold.
6656780,RRK285,2022-05-17 08:32:00,44,I have always found that high water make fish a little more active and moves them shallower. More water though means more areas to search for fish. I find lure depth becomes the biggest obstacle. Heavier jigs and deeper running baits are often needed for adjusting to water levels.
6657512,OneStevieG,2022-05-19 19:10:00,2,Good stuff. The Weather this coming week looks pretty darn good. &#x1f91e;
