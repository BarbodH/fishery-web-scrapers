Spending the night at Falls Motel was a treat, giving me 8 hours of sleep straight through. I'll be back. It was quiet, clean and what seemed like the best firm mattress I've ever slept on. At checkout I'll find out how to have one of those mattresses on my bed at home. High water will allow me to fish a river and 2 smaller lakes that I haven't fished in the past few years due to low water levels. I'm booked from Thursday until May 28 when the rest of my party heads home. If the weather forecast is somewhat favorable and my body holds up I may do an Ernie Banks and stay for another week. Banks got every day saying he wanted to play 2. It worked for him. Why not me too? Now I need to settle down before crossing the border. Several years ago I was so excited to be heading on a fishing trip that I alarmed the lady border guard and she had me pulled over for a check of everything, including x-raying my cargo. I could not have been a winning poker player that morning. Might my love for fishing in NW Ontario be showing?"
