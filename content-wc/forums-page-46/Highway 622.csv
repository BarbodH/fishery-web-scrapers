6656534,stumcfar,2022-05-16 14:01:00,451,Can anyone give me any info on 622 to Ignace? Is tar or gravel? Is it a decent road? Any washouts that anyone knows about? Thanks in advance.
6656762,stumcfar,2022-05-17 07:47:00,451,"We are doing a fly in and fly out near Savant Lake. Can anyone make a recommendation on getting there from International Falls. The quickest route on paper says take 622 to Ignace, but no one seems to know that road. Is taking 502 to Dryden and then to Sioux Lookout the best route? Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
6656798,camp chef,2022-05-17 09:46:00,915,are you flying into IF and getting a car? If driving I would cross at Pigeon river
6656826,stumcfar,2022-05-17 11:51:00,451,We are crossing at Baudette/Rainy River.
6656846,camp chef,2022-05-17 12:48:00,915,So you must be coming from the west. That makes sense.
6657238,Lovetofish,2022-05-18 14:56:00,458,To Dryden then east to Ignace and north on 599. All good roads.
