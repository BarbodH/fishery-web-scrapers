6656812,kona77,2022-05-17 11:11:00,236,Prov- Have seen the FB updates from the Clark's on opening the camps. Yikes this is some high water. I know the last year we could fish before COVD it was just the opposite with low water levels and it made some of our adventures/boat rides a challenge. Always something for the outfitters to deal with and I hope the levels go down a bit before the season gets into full gear..

6657004,prov1800,2022-05-17 21:07:00,5010,All camps are having problems with high water.cant see levels dropping for a while yet.
6657032,Eckohlt,2022-05-18 04:56:00,3685,Low water always better than high water.
6657036,walleyecheek,2022-05-18 05:03:00,2231,Don't tell that to the people that rely on Lake Mead !
6657042,Eckohlt,2022-05-18 05:29:00,3685,I mostly just tell the people in New Orleans.
6657044,Eckohlt,2022-05-18 05:39:00,3685,"Plenty of water in lake mead there good to go,they just have cut back alittle on the usage,From what I read from lakes being very low there finding people they were looking for,for many years,low water is good for the po po,bad for the criminal."
