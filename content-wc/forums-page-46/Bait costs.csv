6657942,Spartan1,2022-05-21 05:37:00,46,Thank you for the info. I believe Pennock's will qualify for the bait purchase zone regulations as well. We are headed to Tennant Lake with Twin Lakes Outfitters. Bring lots of plastics and body baits but it is always nice to have some live bait with us as well.

6657664,Spartan1,2022-05-20 08:25:00,46,My group will be traveling to Nakina in early August. Does anyone have an idea on what we should expect to pay for a flat of crawlers and per dozen costs for leech and/or minnows? Any insight would be appreciated. Tight lines everyone!
6657700,rjthehunter,2022-05-20 09:12:00,154,Call a local outfitter and ask!
6657726,SJC305,2022-05-20 10:02:00,154,"Give Skinners a call and see what they are running or if he’s still selling. I’m not sure of anyone around there selling by the flat/half flat. I know Lochlomond buys crawlers from him and resells. Minnows, there was a guy in Longlac that sold them, but with the new bait management zones…it could be more difficult to find some.I’ll be up that way the last week of August and into September."
6657744,1shooter,2022-05-20 10:44:00,1493,we are paying $100 Canadian
6657802,Spartan1,2022-05-20 13:57:00,46,Thank you. That is about what I expected.
6657804,Spartan1,2022-05-20 14:00:00,46,"Thank you. I called Skinners and they do not plan to handle flats this year, He is semi-retired now. The bait zones have an impact on where you can purchase bait. Longlac is not in the same bait regulation zone as Nakina. I heard Pennocks in Nakina plans to handle bait. Will need to give them a call."
6657842,hoppy63,2022-05-20 17:53:00,367,"Pennocks....$60 half, $100 flat....no idea on leeches and minnows. Where you headed?"
6657850,Eckohlt,2022-05-20 18:20:00,3685,Canadian dollar??
6657892,SweetD,2022-05-20 21:03:00,243,$5.50-$6.50 minnows
