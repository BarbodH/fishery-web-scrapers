These regs take effect January 1, 2002 and are the same for virtually ALL of Northeastern Ontario (Divisions 14,18,19,25,26)Walleyefour fish in one day two fish in one day/conservation licenceno fish between 16.1 and 22 inches in lengthonly one fish greater than 22 inches in lengthPikesix fish in one daytwo fish in one day/conservation licenceonly 2 greater than 24 inches of which only 1 may be greater than 34 inchesconservation licence/only one greater than 24 inches, and 0 greater than 34 inchesThere are exceptions to these rules in certain lakes, but it is mostly in provincial parks, check the regs to make sure, but if you are fishing outside of the parks, all lakes have the same regs now....Take Care,Melonbob :)"

516491,Guest,2002-01-20 20:37:00,0,"The only exception I could find is Kabinakagami River and it tributary lakes....only artificial lures allowed as bait. It doesn't say anything about the lake itself, meaning the new regs will apply to it"
