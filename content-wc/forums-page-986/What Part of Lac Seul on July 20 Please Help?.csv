515786,Guest,2002-01-21 14:58:00,0,"Been going out of Williams Lake and fishing the SW to Central for 3 years now. We find lots of eyes in the 25-29"" category. Makes for a fun 6 days. More Northern than you want and Small Mouth to give you a break when your arm gets tired of reeling in all those big eyes. I can smell the shore lunch now! Good Luck!"
515783,Guest,2002-01-21 19:26:00,0,"I'll be @ Goosebay 5/18-6/1. Told the wife for my B-day this year I wanted to be sitting my skinny little butt in my new boat fishing at my favorite spot and i would like her company. She went for it....Tried for many years to get her to go up early but she always said it's too cold! Like it really matters...hasn't been in the boat the last 4 trips! Shoot last year it snowed the 3rd week in June > go figure.Always wanted to get up there close to ice out > The way the darn weather has been that could be in April! Wanted to see what the spawn was like up the Winnasaga river, Turkey Creek and Sawmill bay. Seems like all the other trips the fish had already moved on.Don't ever recall seeing a website for Fisherman's Cove. Got phone #'sfor the camp... Sorry?!!"
515784,Guest,2002-01-22 10:52:00,0,"Yes if you can post the number I would like to check them out. Goosebay so far has the edge, but that's because of price. I take my son and it's just the two of us so cost becomes a big factor. Spent too much money this year, so tring to keep costs down for this trip. I am looking at going 1st week of July.Brax"
515785,Guest,2002-01-22 20:00:00,0,Was up last year during that time > had a great time. Check the archives for fishing infoTry these phone #'s1-800-667-5208807-222-3313807-222-3070
515772,Guest,2001-12-24 07:26:00,0,"We want to go to Lac Seul the week of July 20 and want to know what part of the lake we should focus on. We have never been there before. We are primarily interested in walleyes and northerns, however, smallmouth and muskie are always welcome. Where do we go at this time of the year. Thanks"

515774,Guest,2001-12-26 10:15:00,0,No Smallies up in that part of the lake.
515775,Riceburner,2001-12-27 21:00:00,436,"I have only one trip to refer to--but we stayed on the NW end and fished Mackenzie Bay/Broad Lake/Sunlite that time last summer---all good fishing on shoreline and midlake structure, mainly spinners and jigs--you name the live bait-they like it all. Takes a 16' or larger boat, to be safe."

515777,Guest,2002-01-01 18:55:00,0,"We go to Lac Seul every spring, usually the second week of June, and stay at the Golden Fawn. The camp is at the western end of the lake, a couple of miles from the dam. We fish sawmill bay and do well on walleye in shallow water-3 to 6 feet. On occasion when there is an early spring, the walleye have moved out to the main lake where we fish rock piles with jigs/minnows. There are a lot of rock piles, so be careful if you don't know your way."
515778,Guest,2002-01-06 05:44:00,0,Any more suggestions?
515779,Guest,2002-01-09 07:52:00,0,Still planning my trip. Any more suggestions would be appreciated. Especially if you have done well on smallmouth.
515780,Guest,2002-01-11 14:05:00,0,"If you're really set on catching smallies, go to the eastern part! Have fished the NW part extensively (avg 5 days a week on the lake for 4 months) for the past 4 summers and have seen 1-2 smallmouth a season. Lots of walleye and pike though."
515781,Guest,2002-01-11 20:21:00,0,"Your best bet that time of year is to fish the central part of the lake. That will save you from running down the lake 15+ miles each way. Camps like Lac suel Lodge or Fishermans Cove (west side) would get you closer to the better fishing. The Fish will migrate into the central part of the lake to reefs and humps. McKenzie Bay, Ghost Narrows, Manitoba Point areas are great areas. Those camps are due west of those spots.Happy fishing!"
