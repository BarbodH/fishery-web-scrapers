Good Lake Trout lake. But not so hot (at least on the south end) for Walleye. I don't know about the north end. Others on this board have talked about Sturgeon a couple years ago. So maybe that thread is still in the archives. Good luck.Pooch in central Illinois"

Sturgeon, is mainly a very good lake trout lake, but also as plenty of northern, the walleye are hard to find, but there are lots of small lakes in the area to chase walleyes, you just have to go up in the bush, plenty of logging roads. I would highly recommend bringing a boat you can carry to some of these lakes. You could also rent one from the camp, they are very nice people and treat their guests well, so they will hopefully return."

We have caught Walleyes too, but later in the summer the smaller lakes are more productive. The owner lives in Iowa and has a website. I would just search on camp midgard and you shoud find it. I have been very happy with the way we've been treated there and the fishing is great."

We go Earlier in June so we can get Walleyes before they spread out into the main lake. We love the lake trout there also. We usually spend two or more days fishing ""Bush"" lakes in the area that WJ lodge has boats on already for us to fish for walleyes. The ""Bush"" lakes are a lot of fund and you catch a lot of walleyes. Our guide at WJ Lodge, Dale Matthews, Phone is 807-584-2923. See if they have anything you would like.Goose"
