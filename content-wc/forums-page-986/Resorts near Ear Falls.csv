516576,Guest,2002-01-24 16:54:00,0,"IMHO I would rate them in this order: 1. Fishermans'Cove 2. Whitewing3.Golden Eagle 4. Gold Pines 5. Onaway 6. Golden Fawn 7. Goose Bay. You didn't mention several of these that are in the immediate area of Ear Falls, but good camps. First two have American Plans that are great."

Great place, great people and great fishing. Give Pete and Donna a call. You will not be dissatisfied.Have a good time reguardless.PKW in Ind."

Opt for one of the newer lund's with the 40hp. 4 strokes, if avalable & you wont be unhappy. You can save so much on gas that they more than pay for the upgrade. People were very helpfull & friendly. The fishing around there is AWESOME!!"
