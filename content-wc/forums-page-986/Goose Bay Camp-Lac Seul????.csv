515706,TomPGrouse,2001-12-13 07:50:00,124,Has any one fished out of Goose Bay? How about the outpost on Nungesser? I would appreciate any opinions or advice.Thanks

You must load all your equipment in your boats and go up the Nungesser River about 3 miles, then unload your boat and portage on a fine wooden ramp (about 125 ft), then load your boat again and boat in to the outpost about 5 miles. We went in June and July and I would consider the fishing fair. However it is hard work. If any in your group is a softey I suggest you not go."

[email protected] or ask Chad--we got honest info from them."
515709,Guest,2002-01-24 08:52:00,0,I have stayed at the main camp by Earfalls for the last 2 years and it has been great. We have camped but the cabins look nice. There is a bath house with a washer and dryer that you can use. They sell minows there and are very generous with the numbers. We have had great fishing. Two years ago we went later in the year and had to travel about 45 min to get into the really good fishing. Last year we went earlier in the year and were able to fish closer to camp and catch fish. Three of us caught 600 eyes in 6 days. We are going back again this year....
