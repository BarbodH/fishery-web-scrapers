516485,Guest,2002-01-20 18:52:00,0,Thanks MELONBOB for the map info in WAWA. I am the guy that you gave the info. concerning the lake out near the mine where you pumped the fresh water for the mine from--it was full of pike but smaller ones. We went to another lake a few miles away back towards town and took the quads back in we caught a 40 inch. pike and a number of decent eyes. We pulled the boat in with a quad and had some very good fishing. Are you at Missanabi at this time?We are planning on going to Horseshoe lake north of Pickle Lake and give that a try have you ever been up in that area.Take MB len in michigan

We're you the person who was asking around for Melonbob? The family got a kick out of that when we found out. My name is Bob Ruff, and my fiancee is Melissa, thus the Mel n' Bob....(:If you're in the area again, go to Ernies tavern and ask for me by Bob Ruff, most of the locals will know if I'm in town on a given weekend....Take Care Bob"
516487,Guest,2002-01-21 09:18:00,0,Hello MelonbobI asked Kenny-Ernies boy- and Earnie and the fella who keeps the campground down at the lake the slim fella from Michigan who spends his summers up there about Melonbob. Not a one of them had a clue about who I was asking about. I know there are more dogs in that town than people and with a name like that I was sure they would know you---THE MYSTERY SOLVED.thanks for your help in the past.len
