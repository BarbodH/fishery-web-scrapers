516548,Guest,2002-01-23 17:39:00,0,Can anyone give us their experience with Rusty Myers Flying Service?We are looking at using their services this July. If we use them we will probably go to their outpost at Hilltop Lake. Any comments will be greatly appreciated.Also any fishing tips would be great!Thanks!
