Does anyone know where I can get this ammo from in canada? Looking to buy a case at a time. Thanks to all who answer. JJ"

516594,BD,2002-01-26 16:16:00,739,A buddy had one of those. Have it checked out by a competent gunsmith. Many of those pistols were made in French Indochina (Vietnam) and China. They are suspect in quality and safety. I don't know of anyone that carries the ammo but then I haven't looked for it. You may have to reload your own. Check with RCBS to see if the dies are available.
516595,Jersey John,2002-01-26 19:12:00,202,Thanks for the info. Does anyone know who would carry the casings for this round? e will check the quality and safty of this gun before using it. We are not able to find anyone who knows anything about this gun. Do gunshops in Canada carry this ammo? Thanks for the help. JJ
