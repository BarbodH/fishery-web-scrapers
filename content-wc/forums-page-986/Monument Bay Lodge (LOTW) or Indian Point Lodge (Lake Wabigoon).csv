We are all experianced anglers (thanks to dad) and all but one (brother John) have been to Canada before.I am looking for a house keeping resort with good boats (trolling motor and finder) on good fishing water for about $500 per person. I have found 2 such resorts Monument Bay Lodge (LOTW) and Indian Point Lodge (Lake Wabigoon).The trick is to have it be exciting for John, as well as, comfortable enough for Dad.Have you ever been to either of these resorts or do you have another recommendation?Thanks,Steve"

I have been going here for a number of years now and can tell you that you will be very comfortable and catch a lot of fish, especially muskies, walleyes, and BIG pike! He has great boats and very nice newly remodeled cabins. I'll be there this summer at the end of July again. Dick Pearson, noted muskie expert, also fishes out of this camp. Good luck!Sincerely,Tom DietzJoe Bucher Tackle Co."
