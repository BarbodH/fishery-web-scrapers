I will say this...if I won the lottery, I would find the guy who owns that cabin on the west end of Pipestone and tell the guy to name his price! Can you imagine what the sunrise must look like there? As for almost feeling like a fly-in, that is also true. Perhaps once or twice in the two trips there we saw boats from someplace other than our camp, but it wasn't often.But a guy sure can get used to looking at the end of his line and sincerely saying, ""%#@&! Another 20 inch walleye!"" That's what we find at Lac Seul."
516495,Amdahl,2002-01-21 10:15:00,0,Just got my confirmation letter from Bow Narrows on Red lake (Ont). The owner informed us that a recent study had shown no small lakers. Anyone up there know any more about this?Amdahl
516496,Guest,2002-01-21 11:38:00,0,"Got the same letter...I guess lakers are all C & R this year...I'm not sure how that will work, the Lakers we caught we always in deep-DEEP! water and went belly up by the time we got them to the surface....Good luck up there...."
516497,Amdahl,2002-01-21 11:50:00,0,Nate-Spend most of my time in pipestone for trout in may/june. You? How many years have you been going?(Kevin) Amdahl
516498,Guest,2002-01-21 18:48:00,0,"We went ther once in June and once in July, had luck for the Lakers in June, but not much else. We started going to Lac Seul after and frankly we feel the fishing is better. However, I doubt there's a more amazing place on the planet than watching the sun go down over Pipestone!Where do you stay?"
516499,Guest,2002-01-21 18:50:00,0,Oh for crying out loud!!!! I should read before I write...never mind where you stay....
516500,Guest,2002-01-22 12:07:00,0,"I haven't been to Bow Narrows camp for about 6 years. Before that I went for 7 years straight and always in first part of July. I always thought it was a great camp and for an outstanding price. I still don't know how they make money on the american plan. Fishing has always been great for LT's and the average size was around 8lbs but people in our group always got fish in the 15 to 20 lb range. The largest one I saw was my wifes grandfather he caught a 36 lb on a old mithcell reel and doctor spoon when he was 82 years old, I thought that fish was going to kill him. I never fished for LT's that much but they are always there in the same spot if the northerns slowed down. I never had great luck with walleyes on Red Lake but I know people that have and go every year for them and from what I have heard the average size and numbers for the last few years have really gone up. Actually I 'm thinking about going up to Bow Narrows this year if I don't go to Bocca Grand for Tarpon in May. I hope this helps and I'm sure you'll have a great time there. Dan can mark the map for you for LT's and the are about 5 mins from camp on main Red Lake and you'll be going right over them as he brings you into camp. John L."
516501,Guest,2002-01-23 23:31:00,0,Is there a site for Bow Narrows or a wayto get some info on that lodge? How good is the walleye and pike population? THANKS
516502,Guest,2002-01-24 07:05:00,0,"I thought the pike population was about ""average"" at best. Frankly we caught more and bigger Pike on Lac Seul. Walleye fishing was very weak. We caught more walleyes in the first twon days on Lac Seul than we did in two years on Reed Lake.The only way I'd go back to that end of Red lake was for the Lakers. Bow Narrows Camp is a great camp, the people are wonderful and the scenery on that end of the lake is unmatched. But the fishing leaves a lot to be desired."
516503,Amdahl,2002-01-24 14:02:00,0,"Tom-I believe walleye fishing has improved dramatically over the last couple years and that 6 to 8# fish are not uncommon. I know that spring is the best time for lakers, probabley not the best for walleyes and northerns. I'm probley not much help for you here as we have always targeted trout. As for the website check:www.bownarrows.comNate could very well be right on numbers, check around, tough to beat Lac Seul. I can't let you go however, without putting in a plug for Dan. We have been going to Bow Narrows, not every year, but most, since the mid 70's. You won't find nicer folks, better chow, or a drive to experience that feels like a fly-in at a better price. Check them out. Amdahl"
516504,Guest,2002-01-24 14:15:00,0,Thanks to Nate and Amdahl.....what a great sitewhen I can get honest answers like that!
