516513,Cat Eye Outfitter,2002-01-21 17:42:00,9,There are two means of entry to buffalo bay via the Manitoba side. Both have good roads in to the point where you will launch your boat. The first will be the first road to the east once you cross the border. This point of access (the Buffalo bay prov. campground and Marina) has a Marina/store/ and near by campgrounds with good boat ramps. The other point of access has a store near to the boat launch (this is the point of access is to the north via the Moose lake road). The launch at the second point of access is good and has a fish cleaning shack and campground in very close proximity (it is a bit more rustic than the prior). Both launch sites are capable of launching any boat.Best of luck.Dan Cat Eye Outfitterhttp://www.geocities.com/dkiazyk2000[email protected]
