516558,Guest,2002-01-24 07:08:00,0,On our last trip up to NW Ontario we had heard that a few people were getting sick from the tap water at some of the camps. At the last minute we bought all kinds of drinking water and carried it up there. Has anyone else heard that or are the guys in my group being paranoid? Do you drink tap water or bring bottled water?
516559,Guest,2002-01-24 08:52:00,0,"Whenever you're in the wilderness, you got to be careful of a parasitic condition called Giardia. What the heck is Giardia? Well, Giardia is a microscopic parasite that can be found in the water from natural lakes and streams. Giardia causes an intestinal illness called giardiasis or ""beaver fever."" How do these parasites cause illness? The parasite produces cysts that are very resistant to harsh environmental conditions. When ingested, they germinate, reproduce, and cause illness. After feeding, the parasites form new cysts, which are then passed in the feces. What are the symptoms? Diarrhea, abdominal cramps, gas, malaise, and weight loss are the most common symptoms caused by Giardia. Vomiting, chills, headache, and fever may also occur. These symptoms usually surface quickly or up to 16 days after the initial contact and can continue as long as one month.How are infections treated? Giardia is usually cleared from healthy people without treatment within a month. How can drinking water become contaminated with these parasites? Giardia is often found in human, beaver, muskrat, and dog feces. How can these waterborne illnesses be prevented? In the outdoors, water should be boiled for for about five minutes before it is used for drinking, food preparation or dental hygiene. This treatment will destroy not only Giardia, but also any other disease-causing microorganisms that might be present. Certain types of filters (<5 microns) can remove the parasites."
516560,Guest,2002-01-24 11:32:00,0,Thanks for the info. I was asking about the tap water from the cabins at NW Ontario fishing camps and resorts. I am most interested in the quality of their well water. Has anyone heard or experienced any problems there?
516561,Guest,2002-01-24 11:41:00,0,"All of the fishing camps and lodges that I've been to in my 25+ trips into the Canadian north take their water right from the lake...hence the postential for Giardia. I'm not sure that the case with all camps, but it's very likely. Hope this helps."
516562,Guest,2002-01-24 19:07:00,0,We always bring our own drinking water. If you do not and there is a fridge available boil the water for 15min and then let it cool down and put it into containers in the fridge.
