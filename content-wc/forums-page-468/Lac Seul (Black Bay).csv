1333447,Mike Kansas,2011-07-24 18:30:00,1463,"Been fishing Black Bay for 25 years. Never have been there as late in the year as you are going. I would spend some time fishing Aldous Bay. Go up Aldous and fish the island points in that area. I would spend a lot of time with Bottom Bouncers and jigs both rigged with crawlers or leechs. Also 10 lb island on the east side should be holding eyes if the wind is blowing good. Warship area could be a good spot also. Ask dan to point out the spot called the Ledge to you. When you get to the cabin there is a map on the wall in the mud room which should show you where these areas are. Good luck, Mike Kansas"
1334521,crittergetter4,2011-07-27 13:01:00,5,Thanks Mike. I have been going 9 myself just curios on water level and how deep they were finding them. I know of some of the spots you are talking about. I will ask Dan about the ledge. I will post how we do when we get back. I know it will be good just how good I will find out.
1334549,Mike Kansas,2011-07-27 14:22:00,1463,Good Luck...Catch a bunch of fish and have a safe trip. Looking forward to your post about how you did. Mike Kansas
1340310,crittergetter4,2011-08-14 18:25:00,5,"We absolutely killed them. Biggest was 27. A lot of slots and overs though. Caught most fish from 22-30 foot of water. Seemed like they were a lot deeper this year. Five days in a row we caught fish after fish after fish. Caught a 41 pike on a 1/8 oz jig head and twister and the biggest smally was 2lbs 15oz. I definitely did not want to come home am already looking forward to next year, but that's no different then any other year though."
1340361,Mike Kansas,2011-08-14 21:05:00,1463,Great to hear that you had an awesome trip. The Black Bay area is as good as it gets on Lac Seul. Only regret you have is that I will be there next June and you have a full year to wait Ha Ha. Congratulations again on a great trip and a safe journey home. Mike Kansas
