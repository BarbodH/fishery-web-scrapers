If you have had any experiences with any of these resorts, please leave a comment or feel free to rank them. For a little background info, I plan on bringing my own boat and we are not interested in any type of american plan."

1341323,MorganMan,2011-08-17 17:49:00,341,"I don't know Lizzie, but we used to fly with the Walsten boys out of Kenora to their outposts. Good, hard working people who do what it takes to make sure you have what you need."
1341340,GreenLaker,2011-08-17 18:33:00,21,Couldn't pick a better section of lake! Have heard good things on all three. I have been staying at Fishermans Cove for the last 17 years - Keith and Dan are great guys and the accommodations are perfect.

Dan & Keith run a great business. I haven't had any experience with Lac Seul Lodge or Scout Lake so can't comment on them. However, I know people who stay at Onaway (right next to Fisherman's Cove) and highly recommend them too. Our trip this year was FANTASTIC with trophy walleye caught 32"", 28 1/2"", 27 1/2"".... & many, many very FAT walleye between 23 - 26""!!! Best year ever! Can't wait to return next year! RBF"

Great location, nice facilities and a great host. Have heard very positive things about both Fisherman's Cove & Onaway Lodge as well; since we have stayed at Scout Lake we have never needed to look anywhere else."
1341723,Mike Kansas,2011-08-19 08:29:00,1463,We have been going to Lac Seul Lodge for 25 years and it is as good as it gets. We also have been going to Lost Island Lodge on our second trip for the last 7 years. It is another great place with top notch service like Lac Seul Lodge. Have heard great things about Fishermans Cove and Scout. Which ever one you choose I'm sure you will be pleased. After all Lac Seul is a gold mine for Walleyes and you are talking about some of the finest places on the lake. Good Luck. Mike Kansaswww.sirmanski.com
