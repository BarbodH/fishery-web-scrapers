We probably won't get into town until some time after 7 p.m. and wonder if there is a good place to grab our licenses that evening.We've always stayed on the Int'l Falls side in the past years and are making our first Friday night crossing this year. We're at the Super 8 on the west side of town and don't really want to drag the boat all over town just to find the license. If that's what we have to do, than so be it.Thanks for any help."

Just head east on Scott street (the main drag), follow it and the road comes to the river with a left turn. Follow that for about 2 mins and look to your left and there it is. The Harbourage is right beside it for coffee and breakfast as well if needed. If you need live bait, get it at Can-op, its the best around town"

We usually stopped at the village corner in Vermillion Bay. Each little stop we can eliminate will get us on the water more quickly on Saturday morning...yeah, I know...15 minutes didn't kill anybody.We'll do some looking around. Thanks."
