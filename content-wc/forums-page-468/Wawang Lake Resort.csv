1340948,mlock,2011-08-16 14:35:00,2,I'm headed up to Wawang Lake in about a month and have never fished the lake or stayed there at the resort. Anyone have any info on the fishing at this lake? Everything I read about it says it's a big fish lake for walleye and northerns.

1341397,Guest,2011-08-17 21:34:00,0,"First off,wawng lake resort is a ""fishing camp"" not a fancy lodge or 4 star resort.The cabins and boats are good but basic.The owners are nice but not always around.If you like doing things on your own it's fine.When we were there (late Aug.) the pike fishing was steady(not great) although we did land a half dozen over 40"".Very few walleye but we were not targeting them. Others in camp were catching some eyes but not high numbers.To sum it up,the prices are low but you get what you pay for and your usually on your own here."
1341471,mlock,2011-08-18 09:12:00,2,how were you catching your northerns at that time? trolling the deep or casting the bays?
1341544,Guest,2011-08-18 13:27:00,0,"Hi mlock, All our fish were caught while casting,we did'nt do any trolling at all.As far as lure selection it was 50/50 between 5/8oz spinnerbaits(contrasting colors) and the 7""Bomber Long A Minnow(firetiger) both took an equal number of pike.We found the larger fish to the south and southwest of camp across the lake.Find the reefs in deeper water with some wind and you'll find bigger pike."
