1341706,IaDave,2011-08-19 07:30:00,476,The area you are talking about is Abrams Chute- not sure what area Shotgun is talking about. I can't imagine going thru Abrams chute with a trolling motor and I would think that is all rock.
1341709,IaDave,2011-08-19 07:34:00,476,Are you talking about the small creek that gets you from Butterfly Lake to Lyons Bay? We have stayed at Timbers Edge Camp on Butterfly and I can see where that could be a problem in low water years.
1341712,skap,2011-08-19 07:57:00,58,"Sorry all, I was referring to the Abram Chutes, or the channel between Abram Lake and Minnitaki. I think this is my 12th year up there and although some years are pretty low, I have always been able to get through that channel. The key is really to keep that boat on plane and hug the west side of the channel. Its usually only 5-6 feet deep in there but thats enough as long as you are on plane. Always amazes me those that go slow through there or dont hug that edge. Once again, sorry about the confusion. Just couldn't imagine trying to go up that with an electric trolling motor. There is no way that mine would pull me through that yet along go through it straight.Thanks for the feedback. Cant wait to go. Leave two weeks from yesterday. Just the boys and my wife. Should be a good time.September is my favorite time to go, fishing is more consistent than spring and the size is usually a little better. Hope that holds true this year since the spring was a little on the slow side.Take care all and good luck!"
1341751,Shotgun,2011-08-19 09:19:00,759,"IaDave, I don't know all the areas and names on this body of water, so sorry for any confusion. Your correct- the Timbers Edge channel is where we had the most difficulty. I fish a Lund 1700 Fisherman and the water level is just too low for this boat going through that area. However, be careful on the lake also as many humps are showing up vs. when water levels are higher. Fishing-we had the most success fishing the humps out on the lake 30+ feet deep. Caught the biggest walleyes at Red Pine just extremely low numbers. Had more numbers success on humps. Good luck!"
1338282,fishingMN4eyes,2011-08-08 06:47:00,108,Thanks for the report. We are leaving tomorrow. Is there any particular color or bait we should use for walleyes? Depth or structure?
1338428,kidsfishing,2011-08-08 14:28:00,12,Used mostly leeches with a few minnows. Walleyes hit just about any color of jig. If you are on the fish you will get them. Caught many walleyes while northern fishing. I would stay between 15' and 25' for the Walleye. Northerns when hitting well took just about everything. We use mostly spoons and mepps.
1340460,fishingMN4eyes,2011-08-15 08:56:00,108,"Got back Saturday. We had very goofy weather with unpredictable wind while we were up there. Wind would blow for a few minutes then lay down. It made it difficult on days when the sun was beating down on us(which was almost every day). Fishing was pretty decent, but not spectacular. We brought home limits so no complaints! We caught fish anywhere from 6-30ft of water with a couple stragglers in 30+ft of water even. No color seemed to outfish any other but I will say that anything with chartreuse on it was a good bet. We only used minnows which we kind of regret but minnow fishing was pretty steady. Lots of the fish we caught were in the 12-15 range. Caught a good handful of slot fish though. Not real pigs, our big walleye for the week was a 24"". For those who care, we caught quite a few northerns while we were walleye fishing. Some were pretty good size too.I'd love to go up to this area in September in the hope of catching some bigger walleye. All in all it was a good trip up north though."
1341011,fire105,2011-08-16 18:46:00,40,fishenMn4eyes: were you able to check out the weed growth. Looken for northerns. how is the water level? last report i saw the lake level was down 3-4' making it hard the get through the narrows. Heading up over labor day
1341211,Shotgun,2011-08-17 11:13:00,759,Returned Saturday after seven days on Minnitaki. Water levels down to the point I had to run trolling motor through chutes we travel. Many rocks showing up that are not marked. Will not go back until level is higher. fishing was nothing klie we've experienced in the past as we had hard finding Walleyes. Our best experiences was fishing flats out in lake. Did land a few very large small mouth.
1341244,fishingMN4eyes,2011-08-17 12:35:00,108,"As others have said, water level is way down. This was our first time on Minnitaki, but you can tell on the shorelines where the water level should be/has been in the past. And, as others have said, the walleye fishing was ok, but not great. Sorry, I didn't pay attention to any weed growth. We fished only for walleyes on Minnitaki."
1341531,skap,2011-08-18 12:13:00,58,"I am leaving for Minnitaki two weeks from today for my usual fall trip. Would be interested in hearing more on the water level situation up there right now. I was up in June and I would say the water was a little on the high side and according to the LWCB the water at least in Lac Seul appears to be average for this time of year. Curious why Minnitaki would be so low. They have not had alot of rain this summer so that is certainly part of the issue.I am sure it has happened, but I have never heard of anyone having to troll through the chutes. Thanks for the posts. Any other info would be greatly appreciated!!"
1341564,IaDave,2011-08-18 15:08:00,476,I talked to an outfitter on Abrams Lake this week and he told me there is 5' of water on the channel thru the chutes. He was able to get thru still on plane. The last time they were unable to get thru was in 2004 so it can happen. Hope for rain to the south and alot.
1341697,Shotgun,2011-08-19 07:02:00,759,"A little more on trolling through the chutes. The camp we stay at has a chute/channel we travel to enter the lake, third year fishing this lake. It's approximately 1/3 to 1/2 mile long, which is what we needed to troll through. The level is down to 2 feet in some of this area. Smaller boats were going through on plane but still fought areas of mud. First day out I sucked mud into my motor and had to clean the lines. Be careful as rocks are showing up many unmarked places out on the lake. Just my take on the situation but I will not return until levels are higher as there are other areas which you just don't need to fight this issue. Fishing was less than spectacular as well. Good luck and be safe."
1341702,tv4fish,2011-08-19 07:15:00,2694,"I'm wondering then if there is MORE than one area of ""chutes"" ??? The only area that I know of that is always referred to as the ""chutes"" is the area pretty much due South of Frog Rapids - or southeast of the Red Pine Resort??? The key to running that ""chute"" is to stay WAY to the west side - right next to the old boardwalk area. Are you guys talking about a different area???"
1331770,kidsfishing,2011-07-19 21:09:00,12,"Thanks. I'm sure we will do fine. We usually use jig leach combo for the Walleye, along with rapalas and twisty tails. Northerns, the wife only used 5 of diamonds. I use an assortment of repalas, spoons, and mepps type lures."
1333686,ChadJulius,2011-07-25 12:42:00,5,"Sorry for the late update...We fished mainly humps and points all over Minnitaki. It was our first time there and our camp owner wasn't helpful at all, so we aren't sure of the names of the areas we fished. Fished caught from 6'-20' of water. Did catch some suspended walleyes on raps run about 8-10' down over 40-60' of water. Didn't have any trouble catching fish to feed a group of 12 each night. Went to English River on the last day and caught walleyes nearly every cast. Was a really neat place and one we plan on spending a day at each year. Nightcrawlers and Gulp Crawlers were the best bait hands down. Spinners and jigs both produced. Big fish of the trip was a 39"" northern on Pelican Lake."
1333712,emma17,2011-07-25 13:43:00,436,"Just got back early this am from 4 days of fishing Minnitaki- I wish we had more as my sons and I had a blast. Weather was tough with cool temps and wind, but that didn't stop us.We fished the humps in the main lake, the chutes and East Bay and had good luck in all places. Mostly jigging leaches (sometimes minnows) with the larger fish caught in 21-30 fow. Large Walleye for the trip was 27"" and had some nice smallies with a couple at 18"" and fat- great fighters.Not much luck on size with Northerns- 32 was the largest- caught on a leach. Spent a morning with Smokey Cole- he was great. Put us on fish and we boated 10 over 22 inches. We only kept a few of the fish as we don't bring them home, so most of the biggies are still in the water waiting for you. Stayed at Abram Lake Park, very nice people there and helpful, plus a great location for hitting a variety of lakes."
1333718,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-25 14:07:00,1460,"27"" & 18"" & 32"" very excellent report. Congrats on the great trip"
1333754,IaDave,2011-07-25 15:22:00,476,"[QUOTE=emma17;1333712] Large Walleye for the trip was 27"" and had some nice smallies with a couple at 18"" and fat- great fighters. Not much luck on size with Northerns- 32 was the largest- caught on a leach. Sounds about right- Heading up in Sept for my 8 or 9th fall trip and we always get at least a few around 27"". Never really try smallies and up till the last couple of years we always get Northern over 36""."
1333889,kidsfishing,2011-07-25 21:10:00,12,Thanks for the updated reports. Leaving Saturday at 1:30 am. Have about a 15 hour drive included stops and boarder crossing. Should be fishing by 5:30 Saturday night. Hope the weather is good.
1334938,emma17,2011-07-28 12:30:00,436,"Iadave- how is the fishing in Sept/fall? Although I just returned Monday, I am hooked and have been thinking about the fall. Kidsfishing- I hope you have a great trip w lots of success. The funny thing is I'm sure our total fish count from last week would be a small number to some on this board (I read somewhere of 1,056 fish in 4 days)- but to us we felt we had action all the time. I can't imagine landing a couple hundred fish in a day- our best was probably 60- and we were/are thrilled."
1334993,IaDave,2011-07-28 14:23:00,476,I wonder about the fish counts I see on the this board- I think 60 fish a day is great the key is where you said you felt like you had action all the time.
1335138,kidsfishing,2011-07-28 21:09:00,12,"Last year 60 fish a day would have been good for us. With myself, wife, 3 year old, and 5 year old(now 4 and 6), we probably boated 30 fish a day on average. That was our first year on the lake, we are hopeful to do better this year. The year before our group went without us, at times they had 30 fish an hour."
1338191,kidsfishing,2011-08-07 18:07:00,12,"Just got back. Walleye fishing was very good. First night there, most of the walleyes we caught were 19-23"". Don't think we took home anything under 17"". Biggest Walleye was 25"". Has anyone caught a 30""+ in this lake. I'm heard it is too far north to grow the monsters. Any truth to that??Northern fishing was very slow most of the time. Largest one caught was 34"". It put up a good fight. We caught about 15 slots. Hard time finding notherns for taking home. Didn't seem to be many 24-25""ers around. We fished the mostly the arm for Walleyes, but did catch them just about every where we fished and with just about every lure we were fishing with. Tried many different places for nothern. Just couldn't figure them out. Weeds, rocks, deep, shallow, points, etc."
1326960,tv4fish,2011-07-07 10:09:00,2694,"I would say -- It must be - as we were there last week and every time we drove over the bridge at Frog Rapids - there w/b 4-5 boats on the downstream side and 2-4 boats on the upstream side. Obviously, there's some pretty fast current there."
1326988,contrail,2011-07-07 10:52:00,59,"We returned from Minnitaki on Sunday and had very good fishing. Generally we found all small fish in depths of 12 to 20 ft and larger fish a little deeper (25 - 35 ft). Classic points and underwater humps seemed have plenty of fish on them. Abrams Chutes is holding a lot of fish, we used 1/4 and 3/8 oz jigs with minnows and had very good numbers, but had to sort through a lot of fish to find what we were looking for. Be prepared to get hung up a lot in the Chutes - I think I personally put about a pound of lead on the bottom one jig at a time. This was my first trip there and am looking forward to heading back next year."
1327463,emma17,2011-07-08 11:27:00,436,"Thanks for the reports. Now that I have some advance planning, maybe I won't forget to put the plug in the boat like last year. Words you don't want to hear your first morning (or any morning) out- ""Uhh, dad, there's water pouring in the back of the boat""."
1327668,Guss,2011-07-09 06:48:00,27,"Just got back from Minnataki, stayed at Donnellys and fished the Pickeral Arm, Red Pine, Southwest Bay and areas between. People were also having good luck on the reefs. We caught walleyes on spinner rigs w/crawlers, Gulp baits and leeches. The mayflies were hatching and probably will continue into the first part of this next week, the walleyes were feeding on the mayflies and it made for excellant fishing. Caught walleyes in 8ft.of water down to 22ft. with our best fishing in 12ft. to 16ft. A lot of fish in the 21""-27'' range, excellent trip."
1327966,Guest,2011-07-10 10:01:00,0,"Just got back from two weeks on Minnitaki. We also fished Redpine one day and did great, got tired of catching 22 inchers. The last week of June, many walleyes were still shallow, 10 ft, especially in weeds. Then the first week of July that bite faded out and the fish were deeper, especially the bigger ones, 15 to 20 ft, points trolling cranks and humps bottom bouncing with spinners. It also took some doing to get 16 to 18 inchers, many fish were in or over the slot, which we only keep if the fish does not survive being released. We did not get a lot of eater northerns but did get one 41 and one 36 incher. We were carded out on the main lake by a MNR guy, very courteous fellow, even gave us a break when I had my wife's license while she was in a different boat a long ways away. Other guys in our camp (Timber Edge on Butterfly Lake) were busted for having live fish in the boat, they have been up there many times so I don't know how they thought they could get away with it. The MNR guy stopped at the camp, I wasn't there at the time so I don't know exactly what he did there, but he could have counted fish in the freezer in camp. He was a little miffed when we told him we were a group of six who had 16 fish frozen back at camp, he wanted to know just how many each of us had claim to. This is the third year in a row he has stopped us, so don't ty to pull any fast ones. Also be very careful with fires, they are very dry up there, my advice is not to cook over an open flame. Went thru Canadian customs on Fri night, back thru US Customs at 10 AM Friday. no line either time."
1329822,contrail,2011-07-14 11:13:00,59,"We were checked by him as well. We had 2 fish in the boat, he asked for us to measure the larger one for him. Nice guy - we chatted for a few minutes and he was gone."
1330824,kidsfishing,2011-07-17 17:37:00,12,"Heading up July 30th. Any advice on where the lake trout will be? Last year was my first year at this lake. Did well on walleye and pike, but didn't try for lake trout. Mainly fished the Pickeral Arm and SW Bay. Largest Walleye was 27"" and Pike was 41"". We do have down riggers if needed. Thanks."
1331114,Red Pine J,2011-07-18 12:06:00,44,I'd try Lyon's Bay & I've also caught trout while trolling for walleyes in Pickerel Arm. ( usually in @ least 40-50 ft. of water ) What camp ya fishin out of Kid???????? Good luck & be safe!!!!!!!!! j
1331382,kidsfishing,2011-07-18 21:10:00,12,"Staying at Donneley's. Second year in a row for me. Others in the group will be thier 6th year. It is a nice camp. A bit crowded last year with all the campers parked everywhere. I was really surprised at the number of other boats out on the lake. We saw people everywhere. It was a bit different from where we used to go, as we had to drive down a logging road for about 15 miles at about 15 mph. Therefore, not many people on the lake.We really only fished the arm and SW Bay. Going to explore a bit more this year. It will probably take me 20 years to see the entire lake. Lyons bay is on the list as is the reef on the main lake and ruby island area. I really want to go to the English River, but that will probably be waaaaaay tooooo far. I am open to suggestions."
1331386,Red Pine J,2011-07-18 21:20:00,44,Then you know the narrows .......as I call it........heading out to the main lake. There's deep water in two bays back from the narrows. ( will be on your right heading out to main lake ) I've seen anglers downriggin in that bay. Depending on your motor size.....English River is from 30-45 min. ride for yall. I'd highly suggest at least one visit Hope yall find good angling ----along with fine weather. j
1321664,Guest,2011-06-23 07:44:00,0,"We have done precisely what you say. I would take my boat and the guide would take the other boat with the newcomers. We would follow them around, fish in about the same places but not right on top of one another, meet up for lunch, then more fishin in the afternoon. The guys who were in the boat with the guide loved it, so much so that after a couple of years I demanded the guide fish with me some, since I was paying the tab. We got into our cabins on Saturday afternoon, fished on our own Sunday (often without much results), then had the guide go with us Monday all day. We then spent the rest of the week fishin in the general areas he showed us using his methods. We learned an awful lot from them. The guy who guided for us was Smokey Cole, 807-737-1200. I recommend him highly, very friendly and capable."
1321711,emma17,2011-06-23 09:56:00,436,"Thanks for the feedback RSH 8. I will give ol Smokey a call. I can see the two boats working well for Walleye jigging, I'm curious how we will handle casting shorelines."
1321744,tv4fish,2011-06-23 10:49:00,2694,We knew/met Smokey when he was a Conservation Officer - he's a great guy and knows the water up there.
1321882,IowaWalleyeGuy,2011-06-23 16:54:00,47,"I have used smokey twice in the past, he does a good job and has some great stories about his C.O. days very interesting stuff."
1325686,ChadJulius,2011-07-04 04:32:00,5,Any recent updates? Headed up in 5 days!
1325910,Red Pine J,2011-07-04 19:19:00,44,"I just talked to my pals that just got back. They fished out of PAC ( Pickerel Arm Camp ) & only left the arm 1 day to check out the RedPineBay area. I fished out of PAC from 1993-2008. My pals landed 3 master angler bass & numerous walleye. My pal said the biggest problem was catching eater size ""eyes"". ( The Horror ) I'm sure they trolled spinners for most of the walleyes. Water level is near normal with hardly any water flowing @ Moonlight Falls. On a side note... I've fished & known Smoky since the late 90's. Heck of a man for sure. but, not all locals are as fond of Smoky as I am. On one particular evening, I was fishing near dark & met a local & his young daughter trying to catch a lil' supper. I inquired if the local knew Smoky???..... his reply was.......lmao....THAT SOB!!!!!!!!1 Hopefully, God willing, I'll make a retun soon to PAC & Lake Minnitaki!!!!!!!!"
1326534,emma17,2011-07-06 11:13:00,436,"Thanks for all the recommendations. We have a day booked w Smokey and can't wait. I am excited yet a bit uncertain given the very novice status of half our group (how to hold spinning reel, tie hook, cast, undo tangles, etc.). I just hope they don't get frustrated. Per previous advice I did take them out fishing last weekend, but you tend to take for granted how many things you learn over time on the water."
1326630,ChadJulius,2011-07-06 14:28:00,5,"Thanks for the reports and suggestions. We are leaving tomorrow evening for a week, maybe longer depending on the weather and fishing...does anyone have any last minute information or suggestions? Any mayfly hatches going on right now? Depths?"
1326855,Red Pine J,2011-07-07 06:45:00,44,"Good luck!!!!!!...If you find yourself having trouble catching Walleyes.......try the English River. They'll be current & you can troll cranks ( 2 in.-3in. ) or just anchor & hold your bait in the current till the fish bite. ( and they should ). You could also anchor & throw crawlers, leeches, or minnows. Walleye size hook & split shot should work. You can also motor all the way up to where the river dumps into the bay, but, be careful as the current can be quite hazardous. There's a couple pools that you'll find & the walleye stack up like pickles. ( sometimes ) In 2007 or 08 I watched on Fathers Day, I watched ( @ the English R. ) a father & his two sons catch somewheres around 250-300 in 3 or 4 hours. The father was not fishing. The father was running between the boys as the fish were landed & the hooks rebaited. Another boat with a lone angler was within talkin distance of the father & sons. The lone angler caught well over 100 eyes during the same time. My pals said a ""second"" mayfly hatch was going on last week. Depths????? Could be from shallow to deep. I'd start in around 15 ft. of water & go either way from there. Let us know how yall do!!!!!!!!!! Take care & GOD BLESS!!!!!!!! J"
1326886,emma17,2011-07-07 07:56:00,436,"Chad,I hope you and your group have a great time and catch many fish. I think you leave tonight- drive safe. I meant to ask where you are staying.All:I've heard a lot about fishing in the narrows between Abram and Minnitaki- is this a good place to bring my new fishing friends? We will have one day to fish before going out with Smokey and I'd like to get them on fish. Is Frog Rapids another good idea for likely fish activity?Thanks"
1319970,IowaWalleyeGuy,2011-06-19 07:29:00,47,"Just returned from Minnataki Lake, last day fished was Friday June 17th.There was a deep, 25-30 foot bite and a shallow bite, 3-8 foot. We fished the rice river on wednesday and thursday, very productive.Lots of eaters, slot fish and trophy size walleye.Best walleye 25 inch, best northern 40 inch, also caught some smallies.Thanks to Kai and his wife Moyra for a great trip, and blueberry pie !!!!Also thanks to Colin Gosse for taking the time to come see us after a full day of guiding another group, to give us some great techniques and spots to try.Hopefully I can get back in Sept. with my wife and daughter for the fall bite.Worst part of trip...............heading back home."
1320020,Chris from MICH,2011-06-19 09:40:00,23,"Heading up in a couple weeks. Was your deep bite on structure or just basin fish? We usually see the same thing first week of July, shallow weeds or below the falls on the river, or deep humps and a basin trolling bite (20 - 30ft) over deep water. What were you catching them on? Is the water high this year? Staying at Donnelly's.... ThanksChris"
1320267,SeulAreaWalleye,2011-06-20 04:54:00,100,"Thanks for the report Eric, great to hear things worked out well for you. Any Lake Trout?"
1320346,Guest,2011-06-20 08:00:00,0,"Thanks for the info. We will be there starting 25 June. In addition to the questions noted above, may I ask how you went about getting the fish at 25 to 30 ft depths? Trolling spinners and bottom bouncers? Vertical jigging?"
1320702,RoughWaters,2011-06-20 20:25:00,98,"Our group just got back on saturday from a great week on Minnitaki. We also stayed at Donnelly's. The fishing was quite good in my opinion with catches of 35-70 walleye a day for two guys. Most fish were healthy and good size. (19-24 inches). Under slot size walleyes were a little harder to find. I never thought I'd complain about catching big fish. LOL. We were fortunate and had a decent wind and walleye chop most days. The fish were found in anywhere from 2-3 feet in the weeds on windswept shorelines, where jigs and gulp worked great. To drop-offs around points, to mainlake reefs. Out on the mainlake reefs our group did fairly well on walleye, and even caught a few nice lake trout incidentaly. Overall the bite was good and couldn't have asked for a better trip."
1320708,IowaWalleyeGuy,2011-06-20 20:39:00,47,"We fished structure in deep water, 45 to 50 feet using vertical jigs with minnows or gulp leeches, these fish were light bites.In rice we used very differant tactics.The walleye were in tight on the weeds, 3-6 feet, best bait was 6'' mister twister chartreuse.The best method that worked was to hold boat out from visual weedline about 40 feet, then cast out to weeds and let bait fall about a foot down, then reel over submerged weeds were the walleye's were ready to ambush....nice slow steady presentation.Sometimes they hit right on the drop.Colin, sadly no lake trout......maybe next trip.Colin, again you proved to us your incredible knowledge of that area and passion for what you do is invaluable !!Hope you enjoyed your well deserved day off !!!Water level was normal for early June."
1320802,Guest,2011-06-21 07:13:00,0,"Thanks for the info IowaWalleyeGuy. The bit about jigging was impressive. To jig all the way down at 50 ft, you must be able to keep your boat very still. Or were the fish suspended? It has also been my experience on Minnitaki that jig bites are very light, especially early in the season. Sometimes they even bite spinners on bottom bouncers very lightly, just a tiny tap and its a fish."
1320983,IowaWalleyeGuy,2011-06-21 14:54:00,47,"Sorry, the humps are 24-35 feet in deep water app. 50 feet.....using anchor.Walleye were on the break or riding the top on the hump.Dead stick with the lite bite."

Maybe sooner, if I can get onto the Internet in Sioux Lookout. My wife once caught a walleye on the bottom 65 ft deep, we saw it on the fish finder and thought it might be a laker."

I'd love to have Colin but he is booked for our trip - fishing July 20, 21, 22 and 23. We are due to arrive hopefully around 7 am on the 20th at Abrams Lake Camp Ground. 2 dads and each of us have two young teenaged sons. My sons and I have fished and can do all right jigging and casting. The other dad and sons are new to the greatest sport ever. Do I try to get a guide the 1st day or 2nd day? Do I have him guide the new group? Do I follow? Any ideas on guides for this sort of set up? My kids and I love to switch between walleye jigging and casting for the toothy critters. Thanks for any help you can give. Thanks for the fishing reports, we just can't wait to head up."
