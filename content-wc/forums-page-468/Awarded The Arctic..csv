1341658,HeHooksHimself,2011-08-18 21:52:00,725,"Bunk, I don't know you or what you do for a living, but you have a flair for writing. I was glued to my computer screen until midnight. Hopefully some magazine mogul will see your report and pay you to do that. How bad would that be? Best to you and your sidekick. Never ever leave that woman!"
1341660,Hawkfan,2011-08-18 22:07:00,237,Those are some amazing pictures.

1341701,jambi,2011-08-19 07:15:00,504,"Amazing photos, that looks like an incredible trip. Thanks for sharing."
1341705,Golden Eagle,2011-08-19 07:26:00,2642,Moosebunk has done several equally outstanding reports. A little searching should bring them up for you. They are worth saving and checking out during the slow season.
1341903,dhottle,2011-08-19 17:00:00,163,Your flair for writing/story telling is what helped you win the trip. Thanks for trip down memory lane. The tree is truly an awesome palce. Excellent photos too.
