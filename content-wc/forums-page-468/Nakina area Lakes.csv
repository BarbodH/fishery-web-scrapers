Just wondered if the smoke from all of the surrounding area fires is affecting the air quality. 12 days and counting - - - - - - - - - - - - We are going to Brace LakeThanks,Rob"
1338592,Mike Borger,2011-08-09 03:29:00,1554,"I doubt you've got anything to worry about Rob.When we were up last month 5 of the 7 days the sky was covered in firesmoke. A thin, gauzy very high layer.It took me a day realize it wasn't normal haze because we couldn't smell anything.If anything it was a bonus for us as it protected us somewhat from the sun. It was blistering hot that week."
1341387,njkrejca,2011-08-17 20:45:00,3,"Rob, I just got back from O'sullivans Rainbow by Nakina on Sunday. No smoke to be seen and crystal clear skies. The locals stated the fires were under control. Weather was in the low 70's during day and 50's at night. Bugs were almost non-existent and the walleye were biting...miss it already! I was also up there the week of July 15th and experienced the smoke filled air like solopaddler. The only thing nice about it was sun protection...it was 95 degrees and humid. 2 trips in one month...lucky me...one with the guys and one with my wife and 8 year old daughter....first time to Canada for both of them. We have already booked our trip for next year..they loved it. You should be in good shape unless fires have started since I left. Nate Krejca"

1341517,oleJoe,2011-08-18 11:26:00,114,Will be there in 8 days. Our outfitter said the lakes are low and no bugs. The weather is hot but when I look at the extended forcast it is calling for the hi's in the 60's and lows in the 40's. Dat ain't warm to me. But if the fish bite who cares. Have a good trip.
