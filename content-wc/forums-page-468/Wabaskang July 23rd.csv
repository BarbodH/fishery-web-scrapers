1335966,Big Mike,2011-07-31 19:22:00,35,"Just returned from Wabaskang...things changed for the better this week. After a difficult few walleye weeks in the middle of July brought upon us by the mayflys and sunny skies...things finally broke loose. Walleyes were easy to catch as many have moved off to the deeper reefs. Guys in camp were catching in the traditional late August spots...only a little shallower around 12 to 18 feet being the best. The traditional jig/minnow was the standby for most of the guys working these reefs and points. I personally enjoyed a fantastic basin trolling bite that I prefer to do while I am up there. Both walleyes and northern fell victim to our crankbaits that we trolled through the vast schools of cisco/whitefish that are found in depths of 40 to 70 feet. This bite was not fast and furious but rather a ""big fish"" selective hunt that did not dissapoint as several 25"" plus walleyes came to the net. Northerns were plentiful and easy to catch as well in both shallow weeds and deep rock structures alike. We managed two over 42"" that gave the kids some great pics to take back to their buddies in Iowa fishing panfish! Just tie on anything with flash (spinnerbaits, spoons, and plugs also), set your drag, cast out...and hold on! Those going up the next few weeks can expect an even better jig bite to start as I seen each day of the week seemed to get better and better with more fish arriving to these deeper rock structures and the walleyes will not have the mayflys to fall back on like we dealt with in July! Schools of minnows are being found on these reefs in droves too which is making August look great! I was lucky enough to run into Dave from Peffleys while fishing the big lake and he echoed the same thing...the bite is improving and should make for a great last two months of the season! Good luck and I will keep you posted...Mike"

1342391,Big Mike,2011-08-21 20:49:00,35,"Pintaildux...sorry for the delay but I was up at Wabaskang and just returned yesterday. As for a report...the walleye fishing was fantastic. The fish are biting on jigs/minnows or lindy rigs on the various reefs located along several places on the lake. I mainly fished wind blown points in the 15 to 31 foot range and had alot of luck, with the biggest taping out at 26.5 inches. Expect alot of 16 inch fish with an occasional 18 to 23 incher not uncommon! As for northern I was a little disappointed as the big fish just are not to be found in the weedbeds yet. Casting big lures in these areas just wasnt cutting it. We had to go searching or baitfish in open water to connect with bigger fish. We managed a 42 and a 41.5 while watching our electronics while crossing the lake and stopping to troll through the large schools of bait. I hope the weather cools and brings the big mamas back into the shallows where we can catch them casting...but I wouldn't count on it by next week. Either way I will be up again too and will be sure to hit the weeds as much as possible! Good luck next week...i'll be the guy in the team crestliner...Mike"
