567029,Guest,2007-07-05 17:15:00,0,"It goes back over 25 years ago when they shut down all fishing to the lake because of the low walleye numbers. And as far as I know the walleye is still closed ( unless it has been lifted of very late ) As a kid we built a cottage there and sold as soon as they closed the fishing but then only moved to lotw then to minaki. I'm mostly a walleye fisherman but the 2 share a lot of the same habitat. So I did catch my share of bass and a few 18 inchers in Shoal. Plus I did a lot of diving in that lake and would see piles of bass. This lake is conected to lotw so the conditions are very simalar. There are islands, reefs, back bays with weeds with huge pike, but this lake has huge open bodies of water that can turn big waves in a hurry. For bass my first choice of lure would be tube jig along shores that are seeing some wave action mixed with some big rocks. I would stick to natural colours of the crayfish But if it's pike your looking for there in early aug the smaller ones will be in the deeper weeds and top water lures work good along with shallow diving cranks. The big ones like colder water. It's not as fun but trolling along shores in about the 20' to 30' mark has produced a lot of big fish up at minaki which is connected to the same system. But I would narrow it down to places that hold a lot of perch. Where there are perch there are pike so not to far from weed beds is a good bet. Even reefs that would hold walleye you could cast cranks, and get a good pike here and there, and agian this is a place that will hold bass and even musky. When we where on lotw I would venture to the narrows of the 2 lakes. It's shallow lots of weeds this would be a good bet of some big pike and musky as well. And don't worry about casting big lures, pike have a real big mouth and can eat a fish 1/2 it's size. As for bugs in the end of july as a rule there should be none, but this year we have had a lot of rain of late, so I wouldn't bet on it, but as a rule there is none. Just watch our weather, if there is no rain no bugs, if we get rain there will be bugs. The water is clear enough to see down around the 6' mark maybe more maybe less but it depends on the algae this year. Again I'm a walleye fisherman, AND I WOULD STONGLY SUGGEST to re ask how bass and pike guy's do it on lotw, and I'm sure you'll get a better responce then I could give. anyway best of luck, your going to a lake I miss fishing a lot, and has lots of them. P.S if your fishing for pike use a leader they'll ripe your line in a hurry ( full of sharp teeth )"
567037,Illini Bob,2007-07-05 21:57:00,16,"We just came back from a week in the Ptarmigan Bay area. Like you were from the Midwest(Illinois) and primarily fish for Pike, Musky and Smallmouth. We ventured as far south as the Labrynth but never made it to Shoal Lake. Shoal Lake is still a Walleye sanctuary so you will have to be happy catching some big pike. I would suggest stopping at Cabelas in Owattana on your way up I35 and buying some large spinnerbaits for Pike and Musky(firetiger and white/gray worked best for us). If your friends like large mouth fishing the small mouths will thrill them to death. 4 inch tubes in earth tones(moss green, brown, etc.) work great and are easy to get out of the rocks. Have fun. Illini Bob"
567066,lassh,2007-07-06 21:37:00,553,"I fished Shoal Lake in late June/early July in 2005. Tim, Dave, and Katerine Kobelka run Shoal Lake Lodge. They are terrific hosts. The food is outstanding. I wasn't there as late in the season so I don't have direct experience in that time frame. We went to Shoal with the intent to primarily fish smallies. 2005 had some really weird weather early in the season and I think it disrupted the normal behavior of the bass. We had expected to do a lot of topwater fishing but it wasn't very effective. There were still some bass on the beds at that time. I don't like catching them off the beds so we did find tubes fished on rocks in 10 to 14 feet of water effective as well as rocks outside of weedbeds. Recommended essential bass lures- tube jigs, rattletraps, spinnerbaits. We did catch a couple largemouth on spinnerbaits. The biggest smalley we caught was 18 1/2 inches. We caught quite a few over 17. The pike fishing was outstanding. We didn't catch any 40 inchers but the two in our boat caught over 50 pike between 33 and 38 inches. Most were caught trolling over 20 feet of water near structure. Some people had success trolling open water. We ended up bending down the barbs to make it easier to release the fish. These Shoal Lake pike are thick, strong fish. My arms actually got tired during peak periods from catching so many nice fish. Effective lures included spoons and large rapala-type plugs. Shoal lake is a walleye sanctuary. You are not even allowed to fish for them. We knew that the lake rules did not allow the use of minnows so we brought in some leeches. We were told that even using leeches could be interpreted as illegal to discourage any walleye fishing. So we wasted $45. We did catch a couple large walleye while bass fishing. We didn't use guides and didn't really need them. A portable GPS would come in handy to keep you oriented on this large lake. It is probably a good idea to have guides with the new guys and maybe for a lake orientation. I was really windy a few days which made fishing difficult, but there are many bays etc. to fish that are wind protected. Bugs should be minimal at the time of year you are going. My experience at Shoal was positive. I will return sometime in the future. Even though there is only one commercial lodge on Shoal, there are many private cottages and retreats on the lake. The lake is largely bordered by a reservation and there are native homes along some of the shorline areas. There are no hydographic maps of the lake. Some of the locals think it helps discourage fishing pressure especially for walleyes. Shoal Lake is a source of water for Winnipeg. I think you'll have a good time. Tell Tim and Dave hello from Sam from Illinois."
567068,Guest,2007-07-06 22:27:00,0,"WOW You guys are really coming through for me! The best advice I have heard several times is the Tube Jig,,,I dont have any of those! The rest of the Lures I have at least a few of. I am still confused about the Walleye thing,,,I really planned on fishing mostly for Pike and then Bass,,large and smallies but would have liked to at least do some walleye fishing,,shore lunches at least! Please keep your advice coming! It was especially nice to hear from someone who has actully fished at Shoal Lake and even stayed at the Lodge! I always tell people true fishermen are the nicest people you can hope to meet! Thanks again! I hope I get 100 more responses! I am printing off the advice I get on these posts and putting them together in a binder to study on the long carride up,,,I am gonna share with everyone(on the Forum here) the best tips I get when I return! Keepim COMING! Tim"

1342286,yancimator,2011-08-21 13:06:00,1,"Tim, are you still out there??? I'm in the EXACT same boat as you, leaving in 10 days, from Missouri............chasing pike and smallies. Would LOVE to know how ya did and any tips you could share. If anyone else has done any pike or smallmouth fishing on Shoal Lake Lodge in early September, I'd love any advice, ideas, or feedback you would be willing to share. I'll be at the lodge from the 2nd through the 9th.Mike"
1342379,Beagle_Nut,2011-08-21 20:12:00,52,"We went to Shoal lake the last 2 weeks of September for a few years, only fished for pike and had a great time, lots of fish and good average size. If you're not experienced with pike first thing is to always use steel leaders. If you're not experienced with Shoal Lake first thing is to watch out for rocks (unless you want to be buying a new lower unit) - they have a well-marked map at the lodge, make sure you have one of your own and copy all the ""red dot"" hazards onto your map. On fishing, when we went we always found the bigger fish closer to the big part of the lake, i.e. closer to deep water. That requires ""playing the wind"" on this big open body of water, we always did best on days where the wind was out of the west fishing in and just outside the bays along the western side of the big part of the lake or the eastern side of the bigger islands. But if the wind is much over about 12 mph then forget it and just stay close to the lodge, maybe try bass fishing then because that lake is wicked when the wind is up. If there's no wind then you can get daring and try a few of the islands out in the middle, just don""t get caught out there if the wind kicks up. And always have a good rain suit (and I'm not talking about using it for rain lol).On pike lures we did well with super shad raps, deep husky jerks and swim baits, chromes / blues / whites or fire tiger. Also 5-of-diamonds, chrome or gold spoons. Feel free to PM me for more info. Dave"
567090,lassh,2007-07-07 11:28:00,553,"If you really want to do some walleye fishing, you can go up into the Labyrith Bay area. Shoal Lake narrows connects to Labyrith Bay which is on the Lake of the Woods. The Labyrinth Bay area I think is about 14 miles from camp. We set out with the intentions to head to Labyrith, but never made it. The fishing was just too good along the way to pass it up. Even though I really enjoy walleye fishing, the action was just too much to pass up and we didn't want to spend the ""down time"" preparing a shore lunch. Since your partners haven't had the shore lunch experience, it might be worth the trip up. I would recommend heading out early in the morning and going straight there so you're not ""distracted"" by the action along the way. Bring a few crawlers to sweeten your jig presentations, catch some eaters, do your shore lunch thing, then work your way back. I wouldn't recommend trying to take any walleye back to Shoal Lake to avoid any chance of hassle from the authorities. Make sure you have a good map, a compass or GPS and keep track of where you are at all times. It looks like it would be easy to get disoriented in Labyrinth Bay. There's a camp at Ash Rapids which is north of Labyrinth Bay and south of Ptarmigan Bay. We saw their boats on Shoal Lake on several days. I do know that people make long trips from Lake of the Woods to Shoal for trophy fishing. When I stayed at Wiley Point on LOW (Sept. 04), the guides took some of the guests to Shoal. Its probably a 2 hour boat ride from there and the biggest smallmouth, northern and walleye were all taken by anglers on the Shoal trip, even though there were many less fishing hours there as compared to LOW."
567091,lassh,2007-07-07 11:40:00,553,The water is not gin clear on Shoal. It is slightly stained and can vary based on what part of lake you are on. I don't remember exactly how far down you could see your lure. It seems like it was about 7 to 10 feet. I do know that the fish would come up more than 10 feet to take a lure. McCoy green mono worked great. My partner used fireline and it worked as well. Your green super braid should work OK. We didn't notice any line shyness as I did use some florocarbon on one of my spinning reel spools and noticed no difference between it and the McCoy mono.

We are all from Missuri,,I am an avid Bass fisherman who spends all my free time fishing,,my 2 friends are new to fishing (I got them both hooked last year,,to the extent that one of them went out and bought a boat after 3 trips to the local lake!) I have been to Canada once before and LOVED it! Getting these guys to shell out the $$$ and vacation time to spend a week in Canada was like pulling teeth. My goal is to show them a GREAT time so that this will be a yearly outing. Neither of them has ever caught a bass over 3 lbs or even seen a fish with teeth! I have always played ""guide"" on the waters around here and would like to be able to help steer them in the right direction up there. We do have a guide the first 2 days we are there (provided by the lodge),,,BUT I was hopeing you guys could comment on a few things; 1.Early Aug,,,what to expect when fishing for Pike (I know this is a Walleye page ,but I think Pike would be more what they are used to since it seems similer to bass fishing) Can we fish the weeds and shallows or is it too late in the year? 2.I cant seem to find any info on Shoal Lake,,,any info on color,depth,fishing pressure,weeds etc especially summer conditions. 3.I dont mind going out and spending $$$ on lures for every possiblity,,my friends however would like to narrow it down to what is the best handful of lures and especially stuff they might be able to use back here in MO for bass. 4. The bugs,,what can we expect in early Aug?? Any other info would also be helpful! Thanks in advance Tim Medley/KC MO"

Their telephone number is posted on their web site. They are very close to Shoal Lake and many of their clients fish Shoal Lake. I e-mailed Shoal Lake resort some time ago but never received a reply. However, I have sent several e-mails to other Lake of the Woods resorts over the past years and have yet to receive a reply. The KBI Bass tournament out of Kenora is held this year on August 9, 10, 11. Shoal Lake is a popular area for them. If you don't obtain the info you need let me know and I will put you in touch with several individuals I know that have fished Shoal Lake a number of times for bass.

567011,freespoolin,2007-07-05 07:10:00,472,"If there are topo maps for Shoal Lake I've never seen them. There is a bass tournament there this weekend, the catch in previous tournaments has been very good. Shoal Lake is good for smallmouth and lots of large pike. I've caught the pike in mid-summer on the deep side of reefs or trolling crankbaits and trout spoons on downriggers. There are also large walleye but the area is closed for walleye fishing. If you get up into the Clearwater, Echo Bay area you cannot use fish parts (live or frozen minnows) for bait. You cannot import live minnows or leeches into Ontario. Parts of Shoal Lake are in Ontario and part in Manitoba so make sure you have the correct licence. Tube jigs are good for bass, deep running crankbaits for pike."
