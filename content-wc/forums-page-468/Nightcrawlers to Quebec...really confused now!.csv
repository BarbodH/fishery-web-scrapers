1342566,tv4fish,2011-08-22 12:36:00,2694,"(I have posted this before in a different thread) This year I bought 3 packs of 250 each crawlers from our local Fleet Farm in Brainerd,MN. Guess what - they were packed in dirt AND clearly labelled as being sent out from Canada! You think I DARE leave them in that bag and take them BACK into Canada --- no way. Ironic, isn't it?"
1343129,kansasity,2011-08-23 20:45:00,80,"From what I know your best bet is to pack them in artificial bedding, then your sure to get them across. We take a thousand crawlers and it's best to be safe than sorry and loose all your bait at the border! My boat box I bought came with artificial bedding, from bass pro. Good luck and catch a bunch."
1343296,ohiojmj,2011-08-24 09:44:00,1262,"Yup, throw out dirt from Canadian worms, washer gentley, toss into man made worm bedding, take for a long ride and dunk in Canadian waters. Silly, but required. I've been asked about it several times at Peace Bridge in Buffalo."
1342469,joepa,2011-08-22 08:33:00,366,I am buying a flat of nightcrawlers from a bait shop here in PA. I told him the crawlers had to be packed in a commercial bedding such as shredded newspaper in order to transport them to Quebec. Well he said I was nuts and that he has been packing crawlers for 35 years and never packed them in anything other than what bedding they were shipped in. He buys them from canada and said they didn't need to be repacked in anything else. He also added that if he had to repack them he would charge me by the dozen and not the flat price. I emailed the mdr in quebec but they answered in french which I cannot read. I then called the lodge in quebec thast we are going to and they said we can take the nightcrawlers there the way they were packed in canada. I'm pretty sure canada packs the crawlers in soil. Now I'm totally confused. Is there a quebec regulation that covers transportation of nightcrawlers to quebec that someone can refer me to?
1342475,v-bay gord,2011-08-22 08:42:00,3168,"Last I heard Quebec was still part of Canada, and from my understanding nightcrawlers cannot be brought into Canada in soil, but must be in artificial bedding. It could be that the folks along that part of the border interpret the rules differently (we all know how the Fort Frances border has a passion for the dui issue!). Your best bet is to contact the border services agency where you will be crossing and ask them. This is a Federal issue, not a Quebec one."
1342507,2746,2011-08-22 09:57:00,3206,"You can get them from Cabela's (and I suspect other sources) and they will come packed for Canada. On the other hand, I repacked crawlers for years, changing them from soil to bedding, and it was no big deal. Maybe 15 minutes work."
1342508,Skyraptor,2011-08-22 09:59:00,291,Best thing for you to do is to re-pack them yourself in commercial bedding since the bait shop does not want to do that for you. Sounds like you need to find another bait shop to go to as well.
1342513,wobbie19,2011-08-22 10:08:00,71,"I just purchased two flats of nightcrawlers and they came packed in shredded newspaper (commercial bedding) with a sticker that said elgible for transport to Canada. I would just repack them in commercial bedding which you can get at most hardware stores. You can take them across the border as long as they are not in soil. This was in Ontario, I doubt the rules are different.And maybe look for a new sports shop as well. Good luck in Canada."
1342514,Larry Mac,2011-08-22 10:13:00,530,"Hi Joepa, We do the same, better safe than sorry and the crawlers love the bedding. many places will pack your crawlers in bedding for Canada. Have a great tripThank you,Larry Mac"
1342519,vteye,2011-08-22 10:28:00,812,Where you heading?
1342520,joepa,2011-08-22 10:31:00,366,"I just got off the phone with Canadian Customs - 613-659-2301, they will answer any questions in regards to border crossings, etc. Nightcrawlers can be packed in anything that is NOT dirt. The lady also indicated that a lot of Canadian sellers of nightcrawlers pack them in a material that is not soil but resembles it. She said it is legal to cross into Canada with worms in this material. Thanks for the input."
1342535,joepa,2011-08-22 11:06:00,366,Heading to Cabonga on Friday for a week. Missed it last year because of the water level.
1342547,TIGHTLINER,2011-08-22 11:33:00,223,ALL OF THE ABOVE SOUND LIKE THINGS I HAVE READ BEFORE HOWEVER SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE. REPACK THEM YOURSELF AND WHATEVER YOU USE TEAR OFF A LABEL FROM THE PACKAGE AND PUT THIS WITH THE WORMS. 7 YEARS AGO I PACKED THEM IN CANADIAN MOSS AND THEY WENT THROUGH THE BOX STILL LOOKING FOR DIRT. A PERSON IN CAMP LOST 15 DOZ BECAUSE THEY WERE PACKED IN DIRT FROM CANADA HOWEVER IT WAS HIS WORD AGAINST CUSTOMS SO YOU KNOW WHO WON. BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY. HAVE A SAFE TRIP..
