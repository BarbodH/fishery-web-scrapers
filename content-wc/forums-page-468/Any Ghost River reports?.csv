1341668,Skyraptor,2011-08-19 04:49:00,291,Did you do a search on Ghost River? I know there is good info on Ghost River. They might not be new updates but it can give you an idea of the fishing from year to year.

I work in health care, so I was looking for ""a second opinion""!! My wish list for future trips include Hidden Bay and Ghost River... if I had been at the dock instead of the airport when my ship came in...."

Cabins, boats, motors all good. We fished Clamshell, Stanzhikimi, and Singapore as well as Marchington Lake. Fishing was excellent on all lakes with Clamshell producing the most fish. Most fish in the 15-18 inch range but many also 20-22. If I remember correctly I believe 24 was the biggest. Good luck."

They are very helpful on any reasonable request and some not so reasonable that bI have seen a couple of times. Darrel's parents owned the lodge before him, he grew uo there and learned his lessons well. Fishing can be really good to excellent, lots of eaters, good numbers from 16-20 our largest has bee 26 inches. You won't be unhappy if you choose to go to Ghost River.wmd"
