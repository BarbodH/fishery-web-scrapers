Most of our fish were caught on bottom bouncers with a silver spinner blade and a worm. Nothing on spoons or rapalas.Emily Bay and Core Shack Bay seemed to be the most popular areas.Our best were a 6 1/2 lb Laker and a 6 lb Walleye. Had one fry and brought a couple home. Not a great week, but we will give it another shot next year. Marked lots of fish around most shoals, but couldn't put them in the boat.The road into Missinabie is hard surfaced and in good shape.Good luck and give us a report when you get back."

Hard work to catch fish as people had favourite spots, 'camped' on them early and sat. Could you please tell me where Fox Den is on Dog Lake? We saw Ernie's and Northern Cottages, as well as one that was closed down (Pioneer?) and Island View off on the Renabie Road a few klicks away."

We stayed at Northern Walleye Camp, used to be Camp Missanabie. Good camp, good equipment, clean and everything worked, reasonable price, owned by a young couple, Warren and Michelle. I would recommend it.Also, stay alert on the road. We saw moose, bear, wolves and Sandhill cranes. Also, on the lake, itself, we got checked out everyday, by the eagles."
