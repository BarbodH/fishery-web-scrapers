1342644,deputy dog,2011-08-22 16:49:00,305,"finally got tme for my trip report so he goes. arrived at nakina friday afternoon and checked into lower twin lakes lodge. basic and adequate and $25 per person. flew out of cordingly lake saturday around 10. crew at jump point was great and quick. after an hour long flight finaaly arrived at beteau lake and was greeted by eddie and craig. a four wheeler with a cart hauled our gear from the dock to the cabins which was nice. eddie gave us a quick walk around camp and sat with us while we readied our gear. great guy who really wants his clients to have a perfect trip. he and craig prepared two shore lunches for the group and eddie even fixed steaks and lobster and rigged his satellite tv so we could watch our beloved steelers thursday nite, wow! now the fishing....with the water levels down approximately 5' from normal navigating the lake was challenging. lots of rocks and sandbars/shoals made a spotter a necessity. with the weedy bays dried up we were forced to switch to trolling the channels which proved successful. my group managed 3 41"" pike with 12-15 35-40"". my boat alone lost around 4-6 more 40"" or better at the boat. gave up on the cradle nets after hooks kept getting tangled. taking a rubber hoop net next time for sure. walleye were larger and far more aggressive than anything we were used to. largest was 26"" with many over 20"". we even found it hard at times to catch any 16-18"" for shore lunch. the newbie in our group managed to catch two of the three 41"" after not having been back to canada since is dad became too ill to continue his yearly trips 15 years ago. it was also his first fly-in so he really had the trip of a lifetime. with the fish we caught and the ones we saw in shallow rapids this lake holds A LOT of huge pike. with normal water levels and a year under our belts next year will be even more productive than this year, which has us pretty pumped for the next trip. one will be hard pressed to find an outfitter more personable, accessible, and dedicated to making sure his clients have a trip of a lifetime. having been on dozens of fly-in trips as a fisherman like you and i he knows what it takes to be a successful outfitter. and the amazing fishery of beteau lake doesn't hurt either. special thanks to solopaddler and pike50plus for the marked maps and lure suggestions for trolling as we were spoon and cabbage fisherman prior to this trip. cant praise eddie and his outfitting/lake enough and we booked for june of '12 before we left. oh yea, the trip started off with my 68 year old dad stepping off the float of the plane as soon as we landed, right in the drink. no injuries, except his pride, but it was funny! eddie even scrounged up an extra case of molson for me when all of mine mysteriously dissappeared, still cant figure out where they all went......thanks a million eddie for everything. HIGHLY recommend this outfitter and lake"
1342649,Mike Borger,2011-08-22 17:09:00,1554,So glad to hear you guys had a good trip! Agreed Eddie is truly a salt of the earth type of guy. I've always enjoyed my trips with him.I think you picked a good week for next year.
1342847,phishfearme,2011-08-23 08:31:00,1242,"DD aka fellow steelers fan - thanks for the report and glad you had a great time - sounds like eddie is among the best outfitters. we fished large river based lakes in the late summer a number of years ago (achapi, miminiska, petawanga along the albany river just south of the attawapiskat) and low water levels can really be a problem - AND - a blessing as the fish tend to be more concentrated in certain areas - especially the deeper flowage areas where the river enters the lakes - ""100 walleye each a day"" catches are possible there. one request - i love reading trip reports like yours but could you please spread things out a bit into some paragraphs - it makes for easier reading for older eyes. thanks, phish"
1342865,deputy dog,2011-08-23 09:15:00,305,wil do about the paragraphs phish......our boys looked pretty darn good vs. the eagles
1342866,TIGHTLINER,2011-08-23 09:15:00,223,LEAVING THIS THURSDAY PM FOR EDDIE'S I HAVE TALKED WITH HIM SEVERAL TIMES ON THE PHONE AND HE SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT PERSON. HE HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE WATER LEVELS BUT THIS REPORT WILL HELP US FIND THE FISH. I AM SURE HE WILL PUT US ON FISH AND WE ARE HOPING THIS ALL PANS OUT FOR US. THESE REPORTS ARE VERY INTERESTING TO READ SINCE YOU ARE HEADED THERE ALSO. WE WILL GIVE A NEW REPORT WHEN WE GET HOME ALSO. TIGHT LINES EVERYONE.
