1123619,bogey,2009-07-24 15:35:00,87,"With White River Air, the size has varyied from year to year and lake to lake. Some of them we catch a 50:50 mix of Walleye/Pike, and some have been 75:25 walleye/pike. When I think back of the recent years the average walleye has been between 14-18 inches, with several each day over 20. Every other year my dad or I manage to get one that is 28"" or larger. From a numbers standpoint, we probably average about 20-25 fish per day per person, it all depends on the weather and beer consumption. We have been to roughly half the lakes that WRA flys to. Feel free to PM me with any specific questions.bogey"

1123851,Ogoki,2009-07-25 17:59:00,291,"I fished Little Miss. six times . The last time there my wife took a northern that broke 25 lbs. Had poor walleye fishing that week but had years with great numbers too. Fished three times with White RiverAir too. Herrick ( 7 1/2 lb walleye) , Hambleton (did not do well ,enough to eat) , Pike Lake lost the biggest northern I ever had hooked ,MONSTER) . Started going to Armstrong and kept going . 7 plus hours from White River and Wawa , but have done better on numbers and size too. Keep thinking I might try that area again but still keep driving the extra miles to Armstrong. Hard to leave a GREAT thing . Also we keep learning more about the lakes we fish and keep doing even better . My cousin fished Little Miss. at least one trip a year from 1986 until 2007 ,only quit because he passed away . He always had at least 6 and some years up to 10 so must have been something to it , Eh ? Good Luck wherever you go and if you are like me you will always have a good time !!!!!!!!"
1123866,labsrus,2009-07-25 20:03:00,557,"Our group just got back from Rush Lake that Air Ivanhoe serves. Nice lake, lot sof pie in the 20 to 30 inch range. We did get a few in the 30s. Had a couple of large ones up to boat but couldn't land em. It is around 10 hours from Buffalo."
1123978,villain189,2009-07-26 14:35:00,33,"Looks like Air-Dale also has a fly-in outpost on Little Missinaibi? Anyone ever use air dale and/or go to the Air-Dale camp on Little Miss? Any info on the cabin, assomodations, flight, boats appreciated. Are the two camps close to each other on the lake or spread out by a good distance?Little Miss is sounding better and better the more I look into it...beautiful lake, large lake, lots of structure, great walleye/N. Pike fishing. Just noticed that Hawk has Little Miss listed as Sun-Sun camp and we usually do Sat-Sat or Sat-Fri. I'm checking with them to see if they could accomodate us..if not we'll have to look into Air Dale."
1123995,Ogoki,2009-07-26 16:49:00,291,I used Hawk Air once when going to Little Miss. Used Air-Dale 5 times. With Air-Dale when I went was a Sat. Sat. camp. This year when coming out the pilot that flew us out at Armstong was needing a ride to catch a fleight out of Thunder Bay . He rode with us . Had 3 hours to talk. He flew for Air-Dale one season and said from reports from the customers that Little Miss. was their best lake . Their camp is located on a small island about a third of the way down the lake from the north . You will see LOTS of moose and bears . VERY scenic lake too. C.O. checked our license one day and spoke very high of the lake . Like I said on an earlier post my cousinn went there for about 20 years . He also went with us to Armstrong many times too. He said the lakes were better to him above Armstrong but as he got past 80 he could stand the drive better to Wawa . As far as bait he was a worm harness fisherman and one year I suggested minnows . He took minnows every year after that . Caught more fish on slower days .
1126765,villain189,2009-08-06 07:13:00,33,Thanks for the tips guys...in the process of trying to book Little Miss for 2010!If we get it I might be back looking for any tips of info on the lake.
1126850,Ogoki,2009-08-06 12:08:00,291,Over the winter I can mark a map for you of places where we fished .Ogoki

1342744,Guest,2011-08-22 21:08:00,0,"Denis @ Canadian Airventures (www.fishinglodge.com) has multiple camps, but due to the economy opens a couple which are really good fly in outpost camps. Excellent Service. Fishing can be very weather dependent, so go in for a week. Lynx River has excellent walleye fishing, small pike, and a very nice camp. Nice A frame for four people. Also, Whiskey Jack, a small lake with excellent bass fishing and large pike. Two person camp. Denis also has a lodge. He mostly uses 6 hp Yamaha engines. He has his own Beaver Aircraft, and airbase is in Chapleau, Ontario. Not as nice, but less money, try www.outpostcamps.com (Martin & Jennifer Wear). He has four camps but only opens two because of the down economy. Anjigaming Lake has a nice cabin, and large numbers of small/medium walleye and small N Pike. They us Hawk Air Service out of Hawk Junction. They use really good Mercury 8 hp 4 stroke engines.[email protected]"
1123196,villain189,2009-07-23 07:40:00,33,"We normally go to Elk Lake area to a drive in for the past 10 years and love it, but one of these years we'd like to do a fly in. Any recommendations on fly-in options that are drivable for us. Right now we drive about 7-8 hours leaving on Saturday morning...so anything in that general range is fine. There used to be a fly-in operation near where we go called Long Point Airways out of Elk Lake but it looks like they just closed up shop. Not sure if someone took over for them? Just looking for some recommendations on fly-in operations that would be feasible for us...of course with excellent fishing as well. Walleye, Northern & Bass are what we're looking for..mainly Walleye & Northern. thanks!"
1123266,onetimedave,2009-07-23 11:58:00,502,Farther than 8 hours but worth the trip. Look at Arctic Watershed Outposts out of Nakina. Remi and Christine run a superb operation. We have used them 13 times with 14 in 2010. All lakes have a abundance of eyes and pike with some of the lakes having lake trout and perch. Look at www.awonakina.com. I have maps and other info if you need. Contact me if I can help.
1123278,villain189,2009-07-23 12:36:00,33,looks like that's a 15-16 hour trip...sounds incredible from the reviews I've seen on here though. Definitely couldn't pull that off every year but would be fun to do once or twice. Do they usually want you to fly in/out first thing in the morning?
1123290,Hayduke,2009-07-23 13:13:00,11,I agree with onetimedave. I used to fly off lac Seul to some great places. I used Arctic Watershed for the first time last year and I am headed back up next week. They run a great outfit and the fishing is top notch. Well worth the 6 hours extra driving time. Two people from our group drove from Albany NY last year and it wasn't too bad.
1123358,bogey,2009-07-23 17:43:00,87,"We have used several outfitters over the past 10 years, but always seem to go back to White River Air. Our group is leaving in four long weeks for our annual trip."
1123375,villain189,2009-07-23 18:49:00,33,Interesting....fits the bill as far as the drive and sounds like good fishing. What lake(s) have you been to and how was the fishing? Avg #/size?
1123486,Mike Borger,2009-07-24 07:26:00,1554,"In your range and all very good outfitters. Lakes are generally smaller, but camps, equipment and fishing top notch.Out of Folyet: http://www.air-ivanhoe.com/ Also http://www.ontariowilderness.com/White River Air already mentioned is very good as well.http://northtoadventure.ca/view.php?...e=wwa_outposts"
1123499,villain189,2009-07-24 07:59:00,33,"Thanks solo...great recommendations. Nice to have a variety to throw out there. From a quick look Easey Point (Hawk Air) looks very interesting based on the size of our group, fishing and outpost cabin quality (hot/cold running water). Also sounds like you are the only cabin on the lake & have access to another lake or two? Can you give me a little more info on Easey Point? Cabin, fishing? How was the portage access to the other lake...was it good fishing there or did you just stay on Easey the entire time? thanks!"
1123515,villain189,2009-07-24 08:51:00,33,"How was Little Miss better than Easey...better size? Or just more area to fish? How were the portages from Easey...any quantity/size in those lakes or are you better off just fishing Easey? We would usually have at least 6..somewhere in the 6-10 neighborhood every year. Both of those cabins would comfortably hold 8-10? appreciate the info...I really like Nakina and will definitely check that out at some point for sure, but this outfitter might be an easier sell to the guys to get our feet wet with fly-in's based on the drive time."
1123588,villain189,2009-07-24 13:32:00,33,"Solopaddler, What were the average walleye/pike you pulled in on Little Miss? And what were the avg sizes? Both of those lakes are sounding great...going to pass that along to my crew. Do you happen to have any pics from your trips to Little Miss or Easey online?"
