In 2009 I filed for Criminal Rehabilitation because of DUI's in 1981 and 1990. The overall process took 11 months, I to wondered how they were doing on the application so I e-mailed the address they provided and received the reponse of your paperwork is in process. The Consulate does not give out info on your paperwork untill they make a decision and then they reply by letter only. Have your friend try e-mailing and see what happens. If he does go with you on the trip he should have alternate plans for transportation as the Border Parol may decide he is inadmissable and turn him back."
1341906,outdoorsron,2011-08-19 17:10:00,843,Hello: I have a friend that tried for over a year to get this. He finally gave up. It was before a passport was needed and it was over 10 years since his D U I. The year before at the border he had to pay 300.00 to get in. Since he got his passport he hasn't had any trouble. Good Luck O R
