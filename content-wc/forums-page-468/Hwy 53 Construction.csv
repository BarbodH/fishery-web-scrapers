1338559,rather-be-fishin,2011-08-08 21:07:00,429,No construction from North of Duluth to Int'l Falls. Slight delay on causeway bridge over Rainy Lake going East on 11. Other than that smooth sailing! Just got back from Lac Seul on 8/6 RBF
1338860,pnnylfr,2011-08-09 19:34:00,114,Thanks for the info RBF. Hope your trip was a success. Now you got time to plan for next year.
1338861,DavKin,2011-08-09 19:34:00,104,"Pennylfr, Are you heading to Chimo? If so, which camp? We'll be at Bearberry Sept. 5-12 Have a good trip. Dave"
1339119,pnnylfr,2011-08-10 15:49:00,114,"Dave, yes we will be at Bearberry. Our home away from home. Talked to Peter last week. The fire was still smouldering but he had a group back into camp. Hopefully they are getting some of the rain thats in the area. Peter said the water was low and that they built a new floating dock going into Bullock. Hopefully they repaired the launch at Bullock also. I will update when we get back. Don't worry, we will leave plenty of fish for you. Kurt"

We love Copper since we have done quite well there, but we struggle on Bullock and Warwick. If your schedule permits, please let me know if/how I can give you a call when you return. Good luck! Thanks, Dave"

The other area is north of Solon Springs where only the asphalt is being replaced. That is about 5-6 miles also. There are additional orange barrels where only a bridge suface is being replaced. There was no back up or time delay. You need only pay close attention in one lane traffic."
