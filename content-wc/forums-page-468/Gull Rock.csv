1335564,jkwildhunting,2011-07-30 08:00:00,361,September 10-17 I believe are days we picked. So travelin on the 9th. Hope the fish have the feed bag on and bite lot better then our July trip.
1337635,pattmit,2011-08-05 12:20:00,36,looks like you will be leaving the lake the day we are getting in. I leave Des Moines on the 15th and we drive up 16th/17th. Already started my countdown calender.
1337686,Pat T,2011-08-05 15:10:00,221,"Yup, it won't be long now! 6 weeks from this moment approaching Dryden for our overnight stay, before heading to Wright's Wilderness Camp. Pat T"
1341968,jkwildhunting,2011-08-19 22:02:00,361,"Hey Tackleman,Been watchin the weather and seen you guys been getting some rain. Have the lake levels came up any yet?3 weeks till we head back up"
1342059,Guest,2011-08-20 12:14:00,0,"the water levels are up about an inch, but the fish are everywhere. I've only stayed close to home so I haven't been past the boot for quite a while now. don't know how it going on the other end of the lake."
1331680,tackleman,2011-07-19 16:27:00,444,"the point that has the beach is tree in the lake point, the tree is on the back side of that point.Fishermans point is the next one down toward ranger."
1331683,jkwildhunting,2011-07-19 16:31:00,361,"This kind of shows you the 3 spots Maybe I am miss understanding spots but the spot that is known as ""Ealge Nest Point"" or ""Tree in Lake Point"" we always call it ""The Beach"" between our group. We normally do not fish the side with the ""beach"" marked we work the tip of the point were its got a really nice drop off back down the shore line to kind of the West/ NorthwestAfter I think about it that spot holds alot of bigger fish. We have caught ALOT of big fish outta that spot both 25.5"" walleyes this past week came from there along with alot of 20-24"" fish"
1331689,jkwildhunting,2011-07-19 16:43:00,361,I am not to worried on that spot Bill! Ian and Drew are going to turn that lodge around in a hurry I believe and I am totally jealous of you if you lived next to Ian for many years. The guy def knows his outdoor stuff and he helped us on making our trip successful even tho the catching wasnt there the tips and spots he shared to Dad and I were def worth the time being up there! Anxiously waiting for our september trip to pull in some big gull rock eyes!
1331859,Pezman38,2011-07-20 07:27:00,3196,"Yeah I wouldn't be worried about it either. Most of that side I see fished hard every year, which is why I hardly ever go over there. I might shoot over there though if the conditions are right. The other boat in our group is much smaller, so if any wind at all exists they won't venture out on Gull Rock."
1331875,jkwildhunting,2011-07-20 08:03:00,361,"Yup, There plenty of places to get away on that lake but last week and most of all the other weeks we have been up there we never see to much fishing off that point. We just had problem last week with a couple guys from a certain camp come in on us. It wasnt like we moved in on there spot they came in after we did and would camp out no joke 10-20ft away from our boat BUT of course they had to have a cooler full of beer to fish. Like the sayin is common sense isnt all that common. To me giving other fisherman there space to fish is ""common sense"" I give everyone there space till they invite me in closer."
1331957,Pezman38,2011-07-20 10:31:00,3196,"I have been lucky and not seen the beer drinking out of hand on the lake. Most I see are pretty tame, 1-2 beers a person. I don't like people coming in on me at all, most that do it will use my markers, or come close enough to tangle lines. I think it's fun to find the fish where others aren't, I just wish everyone was that way."
1332086,Fishin Fun,2011-07-20 14:53:00,218,"Last week I didn't see very many boats fishing close to each other. That's the beauty of Gullrock. There are a lot of areas that you can catch fish so usually you don't see a lot of boats fishing in one particular area. I must say that the boot can get fished by a lot of boats at times, but that's the exception, not the rule."
1332110,jkwildhunting,2011-07-20 15:41:00,361,"It was fun fishing on Friday! We had clouds most day with sun in afternoon and I think we only seen 4 boats all day! Everyone either left early cause of the ""poor"" fishing or left to beat the border wait!BTW that brings another thing up we crossed the border coming back to the US at noon...only have 4 cars in front of us. We were preparing for a 2 hour wait....what a surprise!"
1334606,jkwildhunting,2011-07-27 18:24:00,361,40 some days till our fall trip....Cant come soon nuff!Have a buddy up there this week excited to see how he did!Good Luck to everything headed up in next couple weeks!
1335554,pattmit,2011-07-30 07:18:00,36,JK when are you heading up there? Our group heads up Sept. 16th.
1331349,Moondog,2011-07-18 20:02:00,362,"Our biggest fish was a 26 and that was early on in the season. The largest one the last few weeks was 24. I did, however, catch a massive 42 inch northern off the dock the day before the opener........went 25 pounds. Used a sucker (cisco?) on the bottom. Now that was a lot of fun. LOTS OF FUN!!! That giant made 5 runs and no one had a net big enuf and finally some guy in camp flopped down on the dock and just grabbed him. A few quick shots and CPR and it swam off with gusto!!! Great way to start a season!!!"
1331355,jkwildhunting,2011-07-18 20:16:00,361,"We were all over the lake. Pretty bad when you have a heavy hand! Seemed to need gas atleast every other day most days we ran it down pass half tank!We fished alot at the lil island by fisherman point, 3 sisters, reef close by, went up and fished the reeds up by ranger by in the middle, tree in lake point, the boot, marker island, flats, clay banks, trappers cabin, big island and lil island coming out of south bay and 5 lakes, chukuni river mouth and the channel, stephson point, sunken island, couple of the good islands close by.The thing I love alot about gull rock is there is SOOOOO much structure in that lake either it be mid lake or weeds or drop offs close to shore you can fish that lake so many ways it can be a fun lake to fish when the fish are wanting to hit!"
1331361,Fishin Fun,2011-07-18 20:28:00,218,I agree JK. It's full of opportunities. I've been fishing there for years and still have not tried some of the spots you've described. There are fish all over the place on you find the structure.
1331376,Moondog,2011-07-18 21:01:00,362,"I don't know what this place is called but Tackleman mentioned ""tree in the lake."" We and all the folks we annually camp with call it The Restaurant!!! That is because when you want to have fish for dinner you can always catch a few at The Restaurant!!! Caught my big fish there last year......27 1/2."
1331385,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-18 21:14:00,1460,Restaurant
1331456,Pezman38,2011-07-19 07:20:00,3196,"Alright, Never heard of this ""Tree in the Lake"" point, anyone care to share where it is? If it truely is a tree coming out of the lake I would like to see it regardless of the fishing."
1331475,jkwildhunting,2011-07-19 07:56:00,361,"If I described it correctly to Tackleman I am talking bout the point between The boot and Fisherman Point. On one side of the point there is a ""beach"". I think tackle man stated at one time it was mentioned eagle nest point? Use to be a couple eagle nest back in off that point. Seems to never get fished to bad when we are up there and most years we have found alot of fish holding in that area!"
1331522,Moondog,2011-07-19 09:30:00,362,Ditto! There is a huge drop off at the point which always seems to attract larger fish. There still are a pair of eagles there but their nest is not apparently.
1331627,Pezman38,2011-07-19 13:58:00,3196,"OK, I guess directions won't do it for me, here is the boot and what I thought was fishermans point. Is the tree in the lake in the middle of that cove area?"
1331678,tackleman,2011-07-19 16:24:00,444,Well there goes another secret spot!!!! LOL
1331118,jkwildhunting,2011-07-18 12:12:00,361,"Yea, Wrights posted on there website they found one floating. We never have and never will keep a fish over 18"" much rather see them go back and produce more fish.The I-pilot saved our week once we started to jig. It moved us around in an area but it kept us still to were we could vertical jig."
1331140,jkwildhunting,2011-07-18 12:55:00,361,"Here 3 of our bigger fish. 38"" Northern I got casting a #7 Perch Shad Rap on a steep break by Fishermans Point. Then a 23.5"" eye and Dad's 27"" Eye off the spot we call the beach. (AKA. Eagle Nest Point, Tree in Lake Point if I remember correctly)"
1331154,tackleman,2011-07-18 13:19:00,444,"glad to see moondog made it home safely and had a good stay up here. Joe, I was at tree in the lake point this morning and the walleye were hanging in the 22 foot range. got a couple, none kept, then tried a couple other spots but only got little saugers. it was just too hot and smokey to stayout too long. the smoke is so thick on the lake today you need a gps just to find your way along ."
1331158,Pezman38,2011-07-18 13:30:00,3196,"I read about the 32"" that Lee and family found, Lee was pretty certain that fish died of old age and was not due to mishandling or fowl play! Still, leave those fish over 18 in the lake."
1331162,jkwildhunting,2011-07-18 13:35:00,361,"Quote: Originally Posted by tacklemanglad to see moondog made it home safely and had a good stay up here.

Hopefully I can run into you again in the fall and we can share some tips. Have to bring you some deer meat with us in fall! Yup, Our last day I was anchored in about 22FOW and we caught prolla 25 Walleyes there in few hours. Sounds like the fires are getting worse up there. 4 People in our group flew out of red lake for a fly in trip after our week at gull rock hopefully they make it back to red lake safely. Something I have never got to experience and I hope you guys get some rain. If I could I would send some of this Midwest (Iowa) rain you direction! We got hammered with a good storm yesterday morning."
1331233,Guest,2011-07-18 16:03:00,0,Heading to Gull Rock this weekend wondering about the fires ? Is smoke on the lake a problem? Cant wait to get there.
1331327,jkwildhunting,2011-07-18 19:01:00,361,Talked to Drew at 5 lakes she said smoke was pretty bad today at the lake. Several of the guys in camp got lost going out and coming back with all the smoke from the fires.Sounds like Tackleman posted same information. Turn on the GPS units if you have them guys and its better to go slow then go fast!
1331342,Moondog,2011-07-18 19:42:00,362,"Ah, yes. We have an that iPilot trolling motor and used the anchor setting and basically swirled around so we could jig. Yes, it was a huge advantage and has been at Gullrock since we bought it. We use it alot. Once we spotted fish on the bottom we hit anchor and had not problem catching them other than looking funny spinning around in the waves!!!"
1331345,Moondog,2011-07-18 19:47:00,362,"We had the pleasure of meeting Tackleman in person for the first time....several times on the lake and at our camp. Super guy and never reluctant to help out or give advice. We took him to our ""hot spot"" and got skunked. I will probably never live this down. never."
1331346,Bluestem,2011-07-18 19:49:00,7,"I was there the same week as jk, fishin, and moondog. Sounds like we had similar success, but none of those upper 20""s you guys found. We had a rental boat that did have a Lowrance depth finder, but told me little more than depth. I'll admit though that I'm not very savvy to their use. Someday I hope to have my own boat and have it outfitted my way and learn to use electronics better. We caught fish in the Chukuni River where it leaves 2 Island Lake the first couple days. Mid-week was SLOW, but we did well Thursday afternoon and evening. Had our best fishing Friday - lots of walleyes in the upper teens, and they seemed to hit our jig and minnows more aggressively. Also picked up a pair of 33"" northerns, one of which grabbed a 15"" walleye my daughter had at the side of the boat! It was pretty exciting for all, and I was surprised that he hung on. He made several runs when my girl would get him alongside the boat, but he hung on too long and I was able to net him! Was a memorable experience for all! Even if the catching is sometimes a little slow, there's nothing like a week on a lake in Ontario for stress reduction. If I could, I would spend a week of every month from May to October up there!"
1323344,Fishin Fun,2011-06-27 18:14:00,218,That does sound like fun. I hope for the same turnout when I get up there in about 10 days. Can't wait!
1323982,Pezman38,2011-06-29 09:39:00,3196,"Tackleman, If you aren't busy the week of August 6-11 stop by Wrights, I'll have a Molson or Labatts for ya. Usually cabin 6, but just look for my Avalanche if not. I'll be on channel 68 for those of you on Gull Rock during that time, just ask for Pezman!"
1325853,jkwildhunting,2011-07-04 15:10:00,361,4 Days and Countin till we head up to 5 Lakes
1325912,Bigfish10702,2011-07-04 19:27:00,60,"Lucky Dog, I am dying to return........"
1330744,jkwildhunting,2011-07-17 12:46:00,361,"Just got back late last nite. Fishing was slow to say the least. Met Tackleman for first time and was nice to chat with him. We found the fish in there usual mayfly lock down. They were there but not biting aggressive.Found fish from 5 FOW clear out to over 30 FOW. Tried spinners with lil to no luck. By Wednesday we were working the underwater structure and vertically jigging them. Presentation was the huge factor. Group of 13 had enough fish to eat every night and brought home our limit. 27"" was biggest walleye with few 25.5"" and alot of 20-23"". 38"" Northern was our biggest but walleye fishing was hard and we all wanted to bring walleyes home so we never got to go out northern fishin.Be back up end of september to get em with there feed bag on!"
1330829,Fishin Fun,2011-07-17 17:51:00,218,"Just got back on Friday. Boy fishing was slow compared to the prior 2 years. It was hot and sunny with little wind. Our largest for the week was 26"" and we caught a lot or 20-24"". We had more than enough to eat and brought home our limit, but the walleyes were hard to catch. Seemed to bite better on blue and silver jigs. Yellow didn't produce like they had in the past. Everyone in camp was complaining of slow fishing. Planned our trip for August next year hoping for a little better fishing. Nothing better than fresh walleye!"
1331032,Moondog,2011-07-18 09:30:00,362,"We just got back Friday. The fish are definitely on summer patterns and to quote another poster's wisdom......follow the wind. We jigged all the sunken islands and mid lake humps and did very well. I did not think that the mayfly hatch effected fishing very much at all. When we got to a place where the fish were suspended and obviously munching away of the mayflies ........we moved to where they were on the bottom. I think the key here is to have a good fish finder and only fish when you see actively feeding fish on the bottom. I suppose that is a disadvantage when using a camp boat in most places. Caught a lot of large fish (20-24's) last Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. Humps and windblown islands. Two of us boated 50-60 fish per day with about 30% over 20."
1331099,jkwildhunting,2011-07-18 11:51:00,361,"Yup, I will agree moon dog. We had our own boat on lake (Red Lund Impact) I was wanting to search the areas before we fished but we seemed to have our group in camp boats always behind us so searching for fish was not easy all time as they were always right behind us. Once I got away from the group I would search for fish on the bottom and spot anchor over them and it was usually on. Fish were not ""hitting"" the bait like we wanted but still fish there to be caught.Headed back up in September hoping we can hook into some big ones.Did anyone hear bout the 32"" eye found floating on the lake last week?"
1331108,Moondog,2011-07-18 12:00:00,362,"Did not hear about a 32"" altho that wouldn't surprise me. Someone probably caught it and took so many pictures it croaked. There seems to be a lot of people on the lake this summer that feel ""entitled""...saw a number of fish over 18 cleaned. I overheard folks say that their license says they can have one fish over 18 so they were doing it. Some people don't get it. We did hear from our camp friends that they saw a northern over 40"" floating down by 3 Sisters. Northern just can't take a lot of out of water time and they probably didn't try to revive it. sad."
1331113,Fishin Fun,2011-07-18 12:06:00,218,"Didn't hear anything about those fish floating. Too bad. We keep a very strict 18"" limit within our group. This lake has been soooo good to us over the years that we don't want to see it spoiled. I didn't see anyone at the resort cleaning a ""larger"" fish when we were cleaning. Moondog....Were you able to anchor and jig in those winds earlier in the week? We tried, but the 2 anchors I have didn't hold us."
1321387,Guest,2011-06-22 12:05:00,0,"I have also taken kids up to Gullrock that time of the year and one of the best and easiest ways to get walleyes, and occasional big northern, is to slip bobber the sunken islands that are south and east of the private cabin down from the 5 Lakes resort. The water level has a big impact on depth, but typically, the islands top off at 12ft and go down to 25ft. The owner of 5 Lakes (2owners ago) gave us the waypoints, but alas, I no longer have them. There are 2 out there and we could sit for hours catching 20""+ using leeches, crawlers and if ""slow"", minnows. Use a good size slip bobber and encourage the kids to wait for the bobber to disappear before setting the hook, than hold on! Have fun! CC"
1321406,Blue Fin,2011-06-22 13:05:00,47,"We got into Fort Frances at 12:30 and the line was all of the way past McDonalds and DQ. We grabbed lunch and ate it in the car while watching Tombstone....the whole thing.We did fish the boot a little and saw some others catching fish at the Clay Banks. We caught fish everywhere, just not the numbers or size we were used to. From the sounds of it, Tackleman sees fish in their summer spots now so hopefully you will have a little more consistency."
1321560,Fishin Fun,2011-06-22 20:27:00,218,"I just spoke with Mary at South Bay and she said fishing hasn't been too bad. Her counters show people catching 50-80 fish per boat a day. Weather has been the problem. She said the best fishing has been off the dock a lot of days, but things seem to be getting better. I want to leave now!!!"
1321593,Moondog,2011-06-22 22:04:00,362,Mary can exaggerate! Tackleman is right. Fish have moved quickly to warm water and summer patterns.
1321691,Blue Fin,2011-06-23 09:04:00,47,"We had days when we were catching 50 to 80 walleyes, but only a couple of them were 20 to 21 inches. When we looked around for bigger fish, we didn't have a ton of luck."
1322431,Bigfish10702,2011-06-25 03:20:00,60,"Just back from a week at Gullrock. Pulled into camp friday evening to see a problem bear about the place. Owner shot him about 10 min later. Seems he had been causing problems for some time, well, not anymore ! Fishing was good, week started out with some rain. Initial surface temps in main lake were 59 - 61degrees, by weeks end it was 63. temps in the bays were 65+. We did our best trolling bottom bouncers in 12 - 14 feet of water, then stopping and jigging after we hit a few. We had smaller fish on the rigs, and hit all our bigger fish when we stopped to jig. Big walleye for the week was 25"", most fun was a 41"" northern on a bottom bouncer with a spinner and a leech. We were stopped at a fish checkpoint on 502 just south of 594. It took about half an hour to get checked, and we were on our way. All in all a good trip. got stopped by Johhny Law for doing 9 mph over the limit in Wisconsin. Got a warning. All is well, goodbye to Gullrock for another year!"
1322637,jkwildhunting,2011-06-25 17:36:00,361,Thanks for the Reports. We are gettin boxes packed and tackle organized next week is last full week or work then SHORT week after that working 2 days with one day to get rested up and packed then off to Canada!
1322918,Bluestem,2011-06-26 17:54:00,7,"These later posts sound a bit more positive than the earlier season. Glad to hear as I'm taking my wife, son and daughter up the week of 7/9. We were there last year for the 1st time (a week later in July than this year) and caught lots of walleyes, most being 18"" or under. That was fine as the kids were more interested in quantity instead of quality. However, I am hoping to find at least a few in the 21""+ class this year. We are staying at Procyk's on Two Island . . . anyone have any hints for where and how to fish that lake? Is it generally a shallower lake with less structure than Gullrock? Thanks in advance."
1322921,jkwildhunting,2011-06-26 18:03:00,361,Have a buddy who stays back in on 2 island also and I think most of his fishing is done on Gull Rock but he says its nice being back there if the wind is a issue they can usually catch fish in 2 island. I mainly work that channel for pike. We will also be up there on 7/9 but stayin at 5 Lakes....Time is going SLOW!
1322976,Bigfish10702,2011-06-26 20:58:00,60,"We caught lots of fish, we had many many over 20"", and a few times we were searching for eaters but couldnt find many under 18""."
1320714,Fishin Fun,2011-06-20 21:00:00,218,We're going to be on Gullrock on the 9th and I'm bringing 2 boys up with for the first time and I really wanted them to have a good time catching fish. So I hope things really come around in the next couple of weeks!
1320724,Needinatripnorth,2011-06-20 21:25:00,6,"The owner of the lodge we are going to on Gullrock just posted that they had a pesky bear in camp last week. ""I've never seen them climb up onto the roof of a cabin before..."" Hope that the fish are they only things biting up there in a couple weeks!"
1320800,Guest,2011-06-21 07:02:00,0,"Just got back and fishing was a little slow for walleye in our normal spots so we had to fish a little harder but did get them. We looked for wind blown bays and then we hit them for a while but most of the week winds were calm. Biggest walleye of the trip was 26 1/2 caught in one of those bays. Northern were on the windy rock shorelines and the biggest ones of the week were 45, 41, 40. We do not use any live bait and never fish with the crowd so I have no idea of how the Boot was or the mouth of Ranger Bay was. Hope this helps for those going up."
1320812,jkwildhunting,2011-06-21 07:31:00,361,"Fishin Fun,Good Luck we will be up there also on the 9th. We are starting to get all the tackle put away and make sure reels are spooled up nice. Enough tackle to last us. Got big group of about 14 with us this year should be fun either way if the fish are biting or not. Just hoping its not dead calm. I dont mind some nice walleye chop!"
1320926,Blue Fin,2011-06-21 12:43:00,47,"Our group was up there from June 11th to the 18th. We have only been going to Gull Rock for a few years and this was the worst year by far. We had a tough time catching fish early in the week and when we did find them, there wasn't much size. The weather was way too nice for walleye fishing as low 70's and no wind was common. I think I had my raingear on for 3 hours one day and that was it. I still like the lake alot just think this is a weird year.We had most of our luck pulling live bait rigs in 8 to 13 feet of water. Minnows and leeches seemed to have similar results. Orange seemed to be the best color for jigging. When you do find the fish, I find that plastics work really well. We had a couple of good days up by the white signs on your way to Ranger. Plastics are nice when you are catching fish on every drift, esp when the fish are smaller, which was the case for us. It was still a fun week as I tried to enjoy the nice weather rather than let the slow fishing get me down. The worst part of the trip was the border. Going into Canada, we declared all of our liquor, paid the duty, and then got our boat and vehicle stripped down. Took an extra 30 minutes and not that big of a deal, just a pain to repack. BUT, on the way home, almost a 2 mile line that took about 2 hours to get thru. Now that is ridiculous. A bunch of us were hoping to get home to see the kids before bedtime and this shot that out of the water. Good luck all. Hope you hit the week better than we did. I would appreciate some feedback after your trip."
1321128,Fishin Fun,2011-06-21 20:27:00,218,Did you fish by the boot or clay banks? The last couple of years have been great for fishing up there. We caught a lot even off the dock before we even went out on the lake. I don't think I've ever fished any plastics on that lake. Not in 30 years. Always live bait. I'll have to try to buy some at Cabelas. What was working for you? Thanks for the updates. I'll update when we get back.
1321157,tackleman,2011-06-21 21:29:00,444,"I went out for the first time in the past week today and fished with my buddy from Lyle Mn and his wife at the flats by the claybanks.just drifted with the wind and in the first drift of 1/2 mile got 6 walleye, trolled back up got another 6, kept 4 for dinner.the wind came up and holding the boat was too hard so I headed home and was quite satisfied with the knowledge the walleye are now in their summer spots as the water has warmed up enough for them to be active."
1321212,Fishin Fun,2011-06-22 06:24:00,218,Thanks for the update tackleman. I appreciate your input.
1321245,jkwildhunting,2011-06-22 07:19:00,361,Thanks Tackleman!Ill drop a note the week before but maybe we will see you over at 5 Lakes. Just missed you last year we took off early that morning and they said you came over right after we left!
1321257,Mohleye,2011-06-22 07:44:00,368,"Blue Fin, that is the first report I've heard all year about a long wait at the border coming home. I was hoping for something different this year, as the past few years have been ridiculous. What day/time did you run into the long line? Did others have the same experience recentlY? Thanks."
1316937,Bigfish10702,2011-06-10 17:34:00,60,"I am heading up to Gullrock for the third time since 2007. This year I am gong to try to pry myself away from the Boot and do a little exploring. Last year we got into some nice perch, that had no parasites and were delicious! I hope we can do so again this year. Leaving in 6 days, can't wait. I am bringing my son and his buddy for their high school graduation. The friend has never caught a walleye or a northern !!! He is in for some big fun !"
1316945,Needinatripnorth,2011-06-10 18:08:00,6,We're heading to Gull Rock in early July. Any good suggestions on where to pick up a pound (or so) of leeches on the way? I haven't been fishing in Canada for a few years and the Outdoors Card thing is all new. Can it be taken care of online or do you need to buy one at a tackle store or other location? Good Luck everyone.
1316964,jkwildhunting,2011-06-10 19:30:00,361,If you can break away from live bait give gulp/trigger x a test. We hardly use live bait in canada altho we still bring flat of crawlers with us just encase but last 5 years I have yet to touch live bait and we seem to catch just as many fish and have some nice fish to brag for it. If you want live bait Bobbys in Vermillion Bay will probably have your leeches or possibly try one of the Ear Falls Shops?July 9th cant some soon enough headed up to 5 Lakes!
1316979,tackleman,2011-06-10 20:10:00,444,"johnboat, sorry I missed you this year, never got my boat ready in time and in the water until june 4 then the darn thing called midnight shifts got in the way of another week.I did talk to some guys at 5 lakes yesterday and they told me they got a 30 incher in Stoney Bay and a 25 inch lake trout during their stay.I have tried some of the summer spots but it is still very spotty, the flats by the claybanks, got a couple , Iowa point, got a couple, but I went to fishermens point and got about 6 in an hour but nothing bigger than 16 inches. During the opening weekend I was down on Eagle Lake with my buddies and went into a lake trout lake and the water temp was 59 degrees. Here it is 3 weeks later and gullrock is still 56 degrees in the warmest spots I tried. The weather man is calling for hotter weather next week so I'm hoping the water warms up and the fish should get more active."
1317072,luv2fishcanada,2011-06-11 08:09:00,41,"Just got back from Gullrock. Worst fishing in 25 years of going there. One front after another and cold. Frost several mornings. Water temp was 51 on the main lake Saturday. We caught fish but not near the numbers or size. Talked to several others who had been fishing Red Lake, Lac Suel, and Eagle and they reported the same thing. Picked the wrong week to go. Still better than work."
1317622,GWC,2011-06-13 05:53:00,1021,"We just got back from Gull Rock on 6/12. Loads of fronts & water temp was a little cold. We caught fish but it wasn't as good as we expected. Ice out was a little late this year. We did take a 32, 34 & 40 inch northern & that was fun on light tackle. Had walleye for dinner 5 of 7 nights (the other nights were steak & hamburger and this was planned before the trip). We caught some nice walleye. Guess we had gotten spoiled with numbers & size that first couple of trips . We took my Lund 1625 XL SS on it's first major fishing trip. We had one day of pretty rough water. The boat did everything we needed/wanted it to. Happy with that. We stayed at Poplar Point, We've been going there for 4 years. Will definitely go back. Great place to stay & wonderful people. Next trip, hopefully in September."
1317854,johnboat,2011-06-13 14:46:00,2014,"Tackelman, Was keeping my eyes out for you. Thought I saw the boat once, but when we got closer I noticed it wasn't you. Ian mentioned that you might be working that week. But I wondered if you wouldn't play hooky one or two days. Was probably a good week to work as things were tougher than usual. Picked up a few of your rigs at the lodge, I will let you know if the walleyes on the Mississippi River like them or not. I will look you up next year. Hope you have a great season. Keep'er On The Bottom!!, John B.O.A.T."
1317869,lightning rod,2011-06-13 15:12:00,15,"Our group found the same thing on Gullrock last week. We went down to an 1/8 ounce jig with no body, just bait, (1/2 crawler or minnow) and fished it as slow as possible. You would just barely feel the bite, but this produced a lot more fish than the usual drifting, or 1/4 oz jig and twister tail with bait."
1318445,Bigfish10702,2011-06-14 21:05:00,60,"Yikes, I hope things warm up a bit for next week. The forecast looks Okay and it was warmer this week. The ""worst fishing in 25 years"" causes some angst !"
1320664,jkwildhunting,2011-06-20 18:58:00,361,Anyone up there last week with a report?2.5 weeks out..... Cant come soon nuff!
1311123,DWT,2011-05-25 10:13:00,2,I am leaving for Gull Rock next weekend!! I was wondering if anyone had any updates on how the fishing has been and what they are biting on? We will be trying for northern and walleyes. Any help would be very appreciated.
1311300,jgollaher,2011-05-25 19:02:00,4,"I have been fishing gull rock for the last 5 years and will be going up the week after. We have fished the first saturday in june each of the last 5 years and the fishing has alway been very productive for walleye. The northern fishing is typically dead bait early in the week and by the end of the week as the water warms a bit the northern get very active. I would guess given the weather, you will need to dead bait if you want larger northern. Fishermans point, the boot and the intersate will always hold a lot of walleye. have fun."
1311395,bigdaddy66,2011-05-26 05:23:00,7,Where is the interstate? Never heard of that.
1311482,jkwildhunting,2011-05-26 09:18:00,361,"x2Never heard of anyone at our lodge/ let alone camp owner suggest fishing ""The Interstate"" Maybe its the flats?"
1311599,jgollaher,2011-05-26 14:13:00,4,What we call the interstate would be a point off the main lake on the channel that leads to Keg.
1311607,richf,2011-05-26 14:29:00,31,"If you fish a lake long enough you tend to name your own favorite spots. We have great luck at Dave's Diner, Lee's lunch Box, Black Marker Island, etc.There will be 15 of us arriving Gull Rock June 25.Leave some walleyes for us."
1311618,tv4fish,2011-05-26 15:01:00,2694,"You sure do We have islands, reefs, etc. that we named after ourselves."
1311658,jkwildhunting,2011-05-26 16:46:00,361,"Yup, I think we all name spots up there just our group knows. We will be up there 2nd weekend in July so keep some for us to"
1312412,cody123,2011-05-29 10:39:00,16,Just got back from Gullrock last night--been going going there opening & closing for 26 years. stayed at Wrights--when we left water temp was 58--walleyes were shallow & deep. started in the channel & then moved up the lake. minnows worked-- leeches & twister--twister & peice of crawler worked very well. Towards the end of the week the bigger walleys were found in 12-16ft on structure. all collors of tails. Take crawlers from home in new buss bedding--leeches 42$ pound at 4-seasons in Ear Falls--thats alot of fishing for a pound.------where are you staying?
1316740,johnboat,2011-06-10 07:56:00,2014,"Fished Gullrock last week. Numbers were about the same as the last 8 years but the size wasn't there as in the past. Still caught several good ones (25 inch plus) but just not as many. The weather was probably the issue there. I guess you could say we were catching more mid sized fish as it seems we weren't catching as many dinks either. 9 men and 1 boy went through 111 dozen minnows and aprox 1/2 flat of crawlers, and a few doz leeches. The bite was soft so we had to fish for them. I'm sure with the weather settling they will be back to wacking at it. No problem with take home fish and plenty of eaters. Stayed with Ian and Drew at Five Lakes Lodge. Was a pleasure meeting the new camp owners. Camp looked great as ever and we are booked again for 2012. Heading back toLOTW to see Justin at Mylie's with the family July 16th. Enjoy your trips & Be Safe! John B.O.A.T."
