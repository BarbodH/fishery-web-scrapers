1341299,PRO-V1,2011-08-17 15:55:00,142,"Phishfearme i have seen your pictures grace the pages of the site in Thunder Bay, like i said then, i know Dwayne personaly, and he loves the bush he knows how to put on a good show. I'm hoping to take the familyin next year.Mike"
1341429,phishfearme,2011-08-18 06:18:00,1242,"V1 - yah, you can't ask more from an outfitter than dwayne provides. as you know he's an OPP and we were referred to him by another OPP dwight monck at north of 51 outfitters - who is another excellent outfitter. i never thought i'd be happy to ""meet up with"" the OPP but meeting them this way has been a pleasure!! phish"
1342470,mendenhallt,2011-08-22 08:33:00,2,"Phish, The fishing on Kearns has only improved over the years. There was a few early years (late 80's) where it was harder to catch the 40"" pike but then the guys got into catch and photo, measure, release and get a rep made. 4 years ago we had 10 guys in our group and the trip produced 7, 40"" plus fish, all released! If you think Dwayne does a nice job on the fishing camps you should see his moose tents with wood floors, heat, hot and cold running water, freezers, etc. The guy just knows how to make things comfortable in the bush!Tom"

1328596,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-11 21:07:00,1460,"Very impressive, love that eye. I also liked your boat organization."
1328607,Knoxabilly,2011-07-11 21:42:00,225,Cabin looks great and the fishing even better!
1329030,Larry S,2011-07-12 20:19:00,665,"I was on this trip with Phishfearme and had a Great time.The fishing was fantastic,the average size(19 to 21 inches) and number of walleyes was amazing. There was also an abundant number of larger pike from 32 to 42 inches caught this trip The cabin was very upscale with satelite tv,satelite phone and many other features simply not normally at an outpost cabin. The weather was very comfortable,very few insects,the way the cabin was situated on higher ground when thw wind blew kept many insects away. Inclosed are a few pictures from the trip"
1329553,Larry S,2011-07-13 20:09:00,665,"On another note,this Chicago Bear Fan wants to know when Tooski will be posting a picture of himself wearing a Pittsburgh Steelers Jersey on his Canadian fishing trip!!!"
1330488,phishfearme,2011-07-16 13:33:00,1242,one item i forgot to mention in the original post (and for future searches) is that kearns lake for many years was referred to as JV lake or Jay Vee Lake. there are still no other posts on this board for either JVs or kearns. phish
1330663,tooski,2011-07-17 08:49:00,393,"Larry, Just returned from our 18 hour drive back from Richter out of Nakina. When I get my mandatory 19 hour sleep I will post the Pittspuke jersey photos."
1330848,Larry S,2011-07-17 19:13:00,665,"Thanks Tooski, How was your trip? Phish is really looking forward to seeing you in Steelers Colors! Larry S"
1340926,mendenhallt,2011-08-16 13:19:00,2,"Phish, Just got home from Kearns. What a great lake! This is the latest I have fished up there and the fishing was just as good as in early June. We had rain every day and the only slow day?? was the morning after the all night light and thunder show. A slow day is something like 40-50 walleyes! Oh, I looked it up and I have fished on Kearns 153 days since 1983.Tom"
1341294,phishfearme,2011-08-17 15:24:00,1242,"tom - first, welcome to WC and the ""canada, eh?"" board. ithink this is the best board on the web for all types of canadian fishing although we clearly focus on northwest ontario much more than other regions - just look at any map and notice lack of roads and all the ""blue"" in this area and you'll know why. ""you da man"" as far as fishing kerns lake goes. that's an incredible amount of days to spend on one fly-in lake - have you noticed much difference over the years? it's truly amazing that this fairly small lake can produce such large fish - and sooo many of them. let's hope that dwayne can keep the roads out - we saw 4 boats dragged in illegally during out 10 days there (over canada day weekend) and there's a huge pile of trash at the old cabin site from these guys. phish"
1327169,phishfearme,2011-07-07 18:12:00,1242,"We've been doing fly-in housekeeping outpost (private lake) trips for much longer than walleyecentral has been around and if you've read any on my annual reports for the last 10 years you know we've have some truly excellent trips  but this year's trip to Kearns Lake with Thousand Lakes Outposts (flying out of Armstrong) from June 25 to July 5 was THE best ever  and that's really saying something. The lake is a true trophy walleye AND true trophy pike lake and a structure fisherman's paradise. Although our largest pike was only 41 inches (with at least 4 others over 38), the group before us was proudly showing photos of their 48 incher!! This group, like us, also caught or had on many, many pike in the 3ft range. Pretty amazing for such a small lake (4-5 miles by 1-2 miles). Pike were all over the lake and made heavy leaders a must. The walleye were equally jumbo  our group's biggest was 27.5 and there were at least 4 others over 25 (which we referred to a flat-top class walleyes), 15 to 20 in the battleship class (23 to 25 inches), at least 30 to 35 in the cruiser class (21 to 23) and way too many to count in the destroyer class (19 to 21 inches). The group before us had a 29 incher as the maximum and uncounted ones in the cruiser to battleship class. We referred to one island as Cruiser Class Island for obvious reasons. And these large maximums were well off the lake records of a 32inch walleye and a 52 inch pike. For structure, there all kinds of feeding shelves and submerged rock piles that drop sharply into deep water and islands/points with shoals that protrude well into the lake. Walleye and pike were all over these structures. The sweet spot was about 12 ft of water but we caught them from 4 ft to 30 ft. There's minimal flowing water  the Grew River would be considered a creek here in PA  but even these areas produced excellent  but smaller - fish. Now for the cabin  which we referred to as the Taj Mahal of Outpost Cabins. In addition to the expected amenities (hot/cold running water, enclosed/lighted fish house, well equipped kitchen, solar electric, 4 bedrooms, etc.), this place had: - Flat screen HDTV with Dish Network - DVD player with large movie selection - Three very comfortable lounge chairs (aka: sleeping chairs!) - Unlimited use of a satellite phone (with a catch  it only works when a satellite is overhead  maybe 10-15 minutes every two hours) - Indoor toilet, shower and complete two sink bathroom - The cabin sits up on a cleared ridge, about 25 ft above the lake and mosquitoes were practically non-existent  we burned a coil maybe twice only when we forget to close the sliding glass door - Filtered well water  drink COLD, clean water right out of the tap - A view of the lake you have to see to believe - A very large Amish made, totally stainless steel propane fridge that works almost like a real fridge - A gas powered generator to power an electric fridge, a chest freezer, a microwave oven!! AND an electric ice maker that makes a try of ice in 7 minutes!! (Who ever heard of microwave popcorn in a private lake, outpost cabin?) - A 12volt DC connection in the fish house for an electric fillet knife OK  can anyone beat all of this stuff??? One other observation: we caught many, many walleye in the 13 to 15 inch range and also many, many walleye in the 19 to 21 inch destroyer class range  but remarkable few in the eater range (16 to 17.5 inches). I would say that our walleyes averaged a very respectable 17 inches but this average included very few actual 17 inchers. I think the ethic of releasing the larger ones and only taking the eating range fish is showing clearly here. It's also clear that the future looks excellent for this lake. Sorry for the lengthily report - but prior to the trip I did a WC search found NO other info on this lake  so here's the first  admittedly detailed - report. Any question? Feel free to ask. Phish"
1327177,tooski,2011-07-07 18:27:00,393,Did you wear a Browns jersey on any of the days?
1327181,phishfearme,2011-07-07 18:33:00,1242,no - but i did have some brown underpants after seeing some of the fish we got! best of luck up at rickter. phish
1327209,Mike Borger,2011-07-07 19:18:00,1554,"That sounds incredible, thanks for taking the time to share your experience!"
1328446,IaDave,2011-07-11 14:58:00,476,Nice trip- The cabin sounds nicer than my house for sure. I will add to my wish lsit for future trips.
1328461,Knoxabilly,2011-07-11 15:17:00,225,Post some Pics Phish..sounds awesome!
1328524,Ogoki,2011-07-11 17:15:00,291,"I am curious, where are Thousand Lakes Outpost lakes located ? I looked at their website but did not see a map of where they are . I am familiar with many, many lakes above Armstrong with all the fly-ins and canoe trips I have done from there . Thanks"
1328564,phishfearme,2011-07-11 19:58:00,1242,"ogoki - kearns lake is actually 70 miles SOUTH of armstrong - closer to thunder bay than armstrong. but, there's simply no commercial float plane operators that can service this 8 man camp in the thunder bay area so the outfitter has a contract with don and annette elliot at mattice lake air service to fly his clients into kearns and stonehouse lakes. so, we had to drive three hours above thunder bay to armstrong in order to fly back towards thunder bay to kearns lake. it would be great if the outfitter could find something in the thunder bay area and avoid 6 hours of driving. hope this helps, phish"
1328570,phishfearme,2011-07-11 20:10:00,1242,here's some cabin photos. i'll post one or two fish photos also but if you're like me seeing yet another photo of some guy holding a whopper gets kinda boring. phish
1328576,phishfearme,2011-07-11 20:23:00,1242,a few phish photos - note the pike in the water photos has a walleye tail out of it's mouth. that pike was maybe 32 inches and that walleye had to be 18-19 inches - and still wanted that plastic twister! whatta glutton. note also the walleye juggling act put on by LarryS - who said vaudville was dead! phish
