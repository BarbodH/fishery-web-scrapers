1300698,v-bay gord,2011-04-29 07:08:00,3168,"That's an ""interesting"" hypothesis. There is one commercial whitefish person on Eagle Lake, which is highly regulated.....and only allowed in one small specific area of the lake. Netting goes on in many lakes, Lac Suel, Lake of the Woods to name a couple. It is easy to point the finger at someone else to help explain your inability to catch fish. Maybe you could expand on your theory?"

1301223,stevie,2011-04-30 15:35:00,21,"one of the tougher lakes in ontario? a MNR pop. survey 2 seasons ago,published last spring, put it's walleye pop. in the top 10% of all lakes in ontario,both in recruitment year classes coming up and trophy fish already in the pop. i'm sure the study and results can be publically obtained and viewed. most of these ""expert"" opinions i'm sure are based on experiences 10-20 yrs ago when i will have to agree Eagle had been exploited to a degree and the walleye pop was not what it is today. however eagle is one of the most fertile, multi dimensional,and genetically superior lakes in NW ontario. with 20+ years of mandatory regulations including intelligent slots,a night fishing ban to protect a summer time pop. of big suspended fish and prime spawners,reduced bags,but even more importantly the voluntary conservational attitude of fishermen today especially in the last 5-8 yrs has and she is doing her job. the best days of fishing on eagle are now and will get even better. the pop. and year classes of walleyes coming up 12-18"",the large number of protected slot fish 18-23"",80%+ release of over slot fish with an excellent pop. of fish 25-32"" and true trophy potentail any day. if you are an internet and video fishermen who spends one or 2 times a year on the water if you're lucky and are not brushed up on finese techniques and willing to search out multiple pattern options you could have a learning curve on eagle. but do so and 50-100++++ fish daily with many of quality can be more the norm than exception these days except under the most adverse of conditions. for your first trips i would highly recomend a good guide to get you started and on the right track as there are many options and possiblities structurally and pattern wise seasonally. add to that the specie diversity of trophy muskys,big avg size smallies,lake trout 20-25#+,and pike all within range of you by boat from most sections of the lake and you are making a mistake believing or listening otherwise. there are numerous excellent lakes,choices,great fishing and experiences available in NW ontario and Eagle is one of them.alot has to do with how well you know and have become accustomed to a body of water as well as personal abilities. an season with lots of big fish to all and wherever you fish! steve AML"

I hear that what you are saying but at a lot of other Canadian lakes, just about anybody with rudimentary fishing skills can go out and catch fish without the aid of a guide. Most of the Eagle Lake proponents have suggested the use of a guide, which tells me that Eagle Lake is tough unless you know where to go and what to do. Most people have a week to fish and do not have 2 or 3 days to figure it out and may not have the expeirence or ability to do so at all. I think that we can agree that Eagle Lake is a productive lake but it may not be for the casual fisherman, a lot of people heading to Canada for a week aren't people that spend 60 to 70 days on the water every year. I have no issue with you defending your lake but we should probably look at it from other people's perspective as well. Don't get me started on Muskie- they don't call them the fish of a thousand casts for nothing."

I personnally would rather not ""promote"" the need for a guide because I am an advocate of being able to find fish close to home, on your own, with some help. Sometimes it works, but not always. There is something to be said for discovering patterns, and learning success through experience and time on the water."
1301516,NARDA 1,2011-05-01 09:51:00,636,"My reason for suggesting a guide is to insure that you get on the fish and not waste valuable time trying to find the spots, most people are only there for a week, and this applies to almost any lake that you are new to. A guide is NOT a must, you can cash fish on Eagle without one, the guide just increases your chances."
1302002,Danbear,2011-05-02 10:14:00,72,"I have been out with Greg from Birchdale lodge twice, once for walleyes and once for muskies, we caught nice sized walleyes and northerns even though the bite was tough at the time. Last year went on an evening muskie hunt and had 6 muskie follows to the side of the boat in 2 hours didn't hook any but talk about exciting. After fishing out of Birchdale the last 3 years we have found 6 good go to spots that always seem to produce, my key is you have to keep moving, don't throw the anchor in and sit for hours, I can't wait for this years trip!"
1298649,nd89sc88,2011-04-24 06:33:00,92,"Read a lot of posts about fishing Eagle and the consensus is that its one of the tougher Ontario lakes. What is it that makes it tough? Is it too clear? Checking out a map and it seems to have all the right type of structure . . . it's certainly large enough with diverse enough forage to sustain huge fish populations . . . any ideas? Or, is it just a different pattern you need to learn? I'm still on the hunt for a lodge and some of the Eagle ones look really nice (i.e. Stanley's and Andy Meyer's), but I'm a little wary about the fishing. A couple of the places I was eyeing previously have no openings now (my buddy took forever to finally commit), so I'm having to re-think things a little. But, I'm not really looking for camp advice, so much as info on the actual fishing. Thanks, Bill"
1298656,NARDA 1,2011-04-24 07:01:00,636,"I have been fishing Eagle yearly for 22 years. I would have to say the major factor is the size of the lake, there is just so much area to fish. The best advice I could probably give you is to take a guide out the first day you are up there, mark a map and then just pay attention to the presentation and techniques used and you will be set for the week. My group has never really had any problems catching fish, some years have been slower than others but we have allways caught plenty of fish. It's a great lake with some great lodges and you will have a great time. Terry"
1298680,fishmaster,2011-04-24 07:52:00,209,Eagle Lake is not as tough as one would think. Give Gord a shout at www.vermilionbaylodge.com he can answer you questions. We have been fishing it for years and you learn new spots every year. The qaulity of the fish keep getting better each year with the slot size they have.
1298734,Guest,2011-04-24 11:06:00,0,"Eagle Lake gets better each year. Having said that, I'd have to say that the Vermillion Bay area fishing for Walleyes has been more difficult, for me. to find fish than further South in the Temple Bay region. Eagle lake is HUGE and the slot size regulation has done a lot to improve the walleye fishery over the past decade or so. The best decisions I ever made, on Eagle Lake, is to hire a guide whenever I'm fishing in a new area. There are fish in that lake, and a lot of them, but finding them and getting them to bite is another matter. I have been to Eagle Lake enough times, that I know I'll get fish, but it has taken a lot of years to get to this point."
1298920,dave10,2011-04-24 20:43:00,342,"I agree that a guide is a real help. We've been going to Temple Bay Lodge almost every year for the last decade (great food and service). We used to get a guide the first day of each trip, except for the last year or two, just to make sure we knew what that year's pattern seemed to be. However, here's a theory as to why the reports make it seem tough. Maybe Eagle gets more than its share of newbies compared to other lakes, given the number of lodges and its easy accessibility for drive-ins. That means it probably has more novice fishermen, who aren't as likely to have huge success on their first trip or two. Perhaps that translates into more reports that aren't as positive? We're big fans of Eagle, and the slot sizes have really been effective, in our view. We've been getting more and bigger fish every year, and we love the variety the lake has to offer. Dave"
1299128,v-bay gord,2011-04-25 14:26:00,3168,"I would twist the question around a bit and speculate that ""what makes it tough"" for some are probably some of the same reasons that makes Eagle such a great lake for many others. Size, diversity of sport fish species, tremendous trophy potential, diversity of habitat and forage base, and diversity in terms of the lake itself....stained, shallow through the spectrum to clear and deep. No matter what species you are after the patterns change constantly...and from lake section to lake section. It's not a ""one pattern lake"", if such a thing exists, so having some knowledge and guidance is good to have. That being said it constantly surprises me......I've caught lake trout while trolling for walleye, I've caught big walleye while casting for muskie, and I've caught big muskie jigging for walleye. Factor in migration patterns that these fish have, and the migration patterns of the forage base,......it adds up to some interesting angling. Those who try it once and proclaim it ""tough"" might want to invest some time and learn a bit about the lake. That being said, fishing is fishing and there are bad days everywhere. I know, I've had them too.!"
1299175,fishmaster,2011-04-25 16:51:00,209,"I have to agree with the above posts, yes you probably do have a lot of newbies fishing Eagle Lake and without a guide and not a lot of knowledge it can be tough so yea if you are fishing a new area of Eagle a guide for a day or 2 can be of great help, once you start to learn patterns you will find lot of qaulity fish and like Gord has mentioned you never know what you hook into, I have been fishing for walleye and northerns and caught 15lb lake trout and fishing for walleye have caught musky, you just never know but it is like any lake you have to learn and want to try different things, I have lived and died on an old secret from an indian guide from back in the 70's and there are days that it kills and day's I can watch another boat from camp fish the same area and catch fish and we don't. Good Luck in your venture hope the info is helping you decide in what to do but don't let others scrare you away from Eagle..."
1299657,wallhawk,2011-04-26 19:08:00,22,"I have fished on Eagle for over 20 years. I agree that is has gotten better by far as the years go by. Good size and you can always find fish no matter the weather. Huge lake with all types of different fishing scenarios available. I would also say that some of the best fishing is in Portage Bay, the back channel and the opening to the Big Lake (Vermillion Bay area is spotty at times). Always a chance to catch a trophy muskie as well. Overall, just a beautiful lake that gets better with age. I can't say that I am in a hurry to go elsewhere (and I have fished other lakes in Ontario including fly-ins)."
1299901,Limeyangler,2011-04-27 09:47:00,563,"i have to agree with a lot of the comments above. Eagle lake is an outstanding fishery. I live 15 minutes drive for the Bear Narrows end and fished it consistently for the first time since moving here 4 years ago. like someone else said catching muskie while jigging for walleye, bass while trolling for muskie...even a few big whitefish landed. I have not even been further than a couple of clicks from the landing! i definitely enjoy fishing this lake. I admit i'm lucky living so close so spending time working out what works is ok...but spending big bucks to come up and catch consistently right off the bat i would suggest hiring a guide.Even without a guide the amount of different species that can be caught using just a jig and minnow is awesome.... you will catch fish...i'd recomend it to anyone...failing that lac Seul is different class too!"
