Thinking of doing some northern ontario fishing and was wondering if anyone had any helpful information about northern light lake, near Nolalu. Any and all fishing information and tips are very appreciated. Good luck to everyone this season..."

Walleyes were poor. We did not have a guide, only the guys who had been there before. Also, the year I went the water was way down. Had to moor boats and wade out to them. The resort we were at was mainly a campground of permanents and Thunder Bay's playground. Imagine a bunch of drunken fat older women in stretch pants at 4:00 AM playing Bocci ball and screaming at every shot. In the toilet/shower house a stool tipped over from rotted wood. Several of us left a couple days early. There are good walleyes I believe, we just didn't get it done. The lake abuts to MN Saganaga which is a fine lake. Nearby is Arrow lake, which is a great walleye lake. Most fishing there is done at night trolling. It is a long & narrow lake but huge 'eyes. No longer sure of resorts/camping there but not nearly the traffic."
