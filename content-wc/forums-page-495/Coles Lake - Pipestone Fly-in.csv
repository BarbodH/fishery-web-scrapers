1302918,dave macpherson,2011-05-04 13:20:00,7,"I was there about 8-9 years ago. Had a great time! The weather, unfortunately, was unbelievably hot and we had no wind almost the entire time,,,, and the insects were ferocious. We had good fishing on Coles north of the cabin, through the narrows, and on the the north shore of the north bay near the river very close to shore in shallow water. Most of them were 18 or 19 inchers. We also caught walleyes right in the narrows,, we could actually see them! The walleye fishing on the rest of the lake was sporadic. We only tried the river once and due to the incredibly hot, calm conditions and the incessant insects, we did not stay long. The portage lake, August, was terrific for walleyes, again in the 18 to 19 inch range. If you go to August, be prepared for a fairly long trek and pay close attention to the trail. When we went, there were trees down everywhere and the trail was faint. I live in the woods and spend most of my time outdoors, so I am accustomed to finding my way around outdoors. We went in July by the way. Mike and Renae Henry are dynamite people and run a very nice operation. You won't be disappointed. Good luck up there!!!"
