About two weeks ago, I thought this camera was showing a live shot of the North Pole, based on the amount of snow and ice. But as you can see, things are melting, slowly but surely.http://www.bay.tv/sioux-lookout-webcam,3026"

And I am declaring the ice out on this particular lake - although now that I have said this, I'm sure it will freeze over tonight or possibly tomorrow morning. But I'm very glad to see that it's looking very good for an ice-free opener when I'm up there in two short weeks! - Steve"
