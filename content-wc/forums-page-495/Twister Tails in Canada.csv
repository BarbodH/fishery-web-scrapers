1302036,camp chef,2011-05-02 11:52:00,915,We have fished them both ways....depends on what the fish want.
1302191,Mark Komo,2011-05-02 18:46:00,867,"Back in my college years, I visited Separation lake lodge for a few years. The only thing we brought was plain leadhead jigs and yellow twisters. Thats it. Smoked all fish. Pike, smallies and especially walleyes."
1302228,walleye1952,2011-05-02 20:21:00,13,"Twister Tails work great, especially in the stained waters on many Canadian lakes. Depending on the depth, current & wind/wave action..1/8, 1/4,3/8 oz. lead heads with 3 & 4 "" twister tails. If deeper, for suspended walleyes in 30 - 50 + feet water,heavier weight and longer tails (6"")...all colors good, depending on day/weather, especially yellow, black, white chartruse, red....and tip with a small to medium minnow or 1/2 a night crawler....caught 1000's of walleyes over the last 40 years with this method."
1302360,Mohleye,2011-05-03 07:32:00,368,"I grew up using and tying bucktail and other ""hair"" type jigs. When twister tails came along I gradually made the switch as they were just as effective and a lot less hassle. Fished with and without live bait, but usually with. Everyone I fish with does the same. Wasn't until I was exposed to the larger world of Walleye Central that I realized so many people used jigs without tails."
1302376,NemegosendaRiver,2011-05-03 08:00:00,66,There are a few things I wouldn't be caught dead on a Canadian Walleye trip without.Jig HeadsTwistertailsNightcrawlersHusky JerksTaildancersHooksSinkersToothpicksEverything else is just taking up room in the box.
1302746,Leeches,2011-05-03 22:46:00,106,"Like previous posts above, I had better luck with twisters or any artificials in stained water.Having said that if your fishing all day for a few days experiment away, you got time."
1303234,stevensinks,2011-05-05 10:33:00,330,Canada or Kansas if Im using a jig to fish for walleye I will have a tail on. 98% of the time I will also have 1/2 of a crawler on. If the fish are on a soft bite I think they will hold on to the jig longer with a tail on it. Also the tail makes chaning color very fast and easy.
1301826,JCsGoneFishin,2011-05-01 21:24:00,34,"Going to Canada in June and want to try twister tails as I read that it can be just the ticket -- sometimes better than crawlers or minnows. Do you folks agree? When do you use over live bait? What colors do you use? What size (2"", 3"", larger)? With what type jig? Do you match the color of the twister tails to the jig head?"
1301829,Golden Eagle,2011-05-01 21:35:00,2642,"Bobby, at Bobby's Corner, got our party started on twister tails in August 1972 by giving us a few free samples. We hesitated to use them, but they caught walleyes for us. We didn't know a whole lot about jigging for walleyes back then."
1301833,whitedot,2011-05-01 21:47:00,8,I still prefer live bait myself. Just a confidence thing.
1301840,tackleman,2011-05-01 21:58:00,444,"twister tails are a bait of last resort in my tacklebox. If i run out of minnows, run out of gulp then maybe i'll try a twister tail, but this is just that I know the lake I fish live bait works superior to anything else"
1301873,DonC,2011-05-02 03:04:00,93,"JCsGoneFishin, I like 3 inch Berkley Power Grubs mostly in the Natural Chartreuse color, which is a pumpkin head and chartreuse tail, fished on 1/8 - 1/4 ounce painted live bait jigheads (does not tear up plastic grub) from Cabela's. If I am fishing smallmouth I use the 1/8 ounce jighead, and a 1/4 - 3/8 ounce jighead deeper for walleye. I use mostly tender tubes from Pro Bass on 1/4 ounce tender tube jigheads for smallmouth though. DonC"
1301898,oleJoe,2011-05-02 06:00:00,114,We have been using them for 15 yrs now. Never have used live bait 3 inch chartreuse clear for me has always been the best but will use white and red and white. Its what you have the faith in. The biggest concern is to find the walleye and then they will bite on most things. Many guys take in crawlers and have heard good things about gulp leeches and gulp alive but finding the walleye is step number one. LOL there is no secret lure for the fish....just the fisherman.
1302006,Knoxabilly,2011-05-02 10:24:00,225,"I use 3 inch 90% of the time. Usually, green, chartreuse or white but I always tip the jig with minnow or leech. I feel like the flash of the jig brings the walleyes over investigage, then when they hit and feel flesh they hang on. Even when we are getting lots of bites...we have experimented with one guy using bait and other no bait...baited jig always wins."
1302011,camp chef,2011-05-02 10:38:00,915,3 in. Curly tail Gulp has been a go to bait for us.I have caught my 3 biggest Northerns on a Jig and yellow or orange 3 in curly tail Gulp. I have also outfished my boat partner using the gulp leech when he was using live leeches. They are just another tool in the box.
1302014,Jack77,2011-05-02 10:49:00,168,"Has anybody had any experience with Yum Walleye Grubs? I bought several packs of 3"" Yum F2 Walleye Grubs ( pink blush, white, chart/silver flake, and bumble bee) and I was wondering if anybody had any feedback. I have always had good success with grubs in general but mostly coupled with a minnow or piece of crawler. With these new scented and salted soft plastics is it neccessary?One more questioned about Gulp Alive 3"" leeches- do you hook it through the sucker like you would with a live leech or thread it on like you would a grub body?"
1302029,lassh,2011-05-02 11:34:00,553,"For walleyes we normally use 3"" twister tails. When the fish are active, oftentimes its better to use tails than live bait. If you need a smaller presentation, you can bite off some of the head or even trim down the body or tail with a knife or scissors. There are times when fish are tentative when the live bait or a grubbed jig tipped with a piece of crawler, minnow or a leech will outproduce the tails. I normally use a quarter oz. jig and try to keep it on or near the bottom. I like using power bait tails but just the old mister twister type plastics often work just as well. Most of the time I don't often use Gulp tails on jigs because of their stiffness/lack of action and they dry up out of water if not in solution. Gulp works but it is not always superior to plain plastic. If its really windy or fishing very deep, I will use 3/8 oz. jigs (or rarely 1/2 oz.) If no wind or casting into shallow water or clear water 1/8 oz. But 90% is 1/4 oz. For spinner rigs we typically use real crawlers, however, last 2 seasons at times Gulp crawlers, minnows, and leeches performed as well or better than real crawlers, and it was not during a ""fast bite"". As far as color goes, sometimes its a big factor, other times it seems not to matter. Standard colors are chartruese, white, black, yellow, orange and root beer colors. Jig color doesn't appear to make that much difference but I will usually have a different color head than tail and often use black or unpainted heads. For pike the bumblebee color or orange seems to attract them. You can usually catch quite a few fish on a tail. Bring some super glue to keep the tail from slipping away from the jig head and to patch together a chewed up tail. Stay aware of what is working at any given time. I was up there once with a rookie who wasn't rigging the tails on straight. He was threading too much of the tail on leaving twisted bend in the tail. He caught 4 fish to my zero. To add insult to injury, he was using a steel leader contrasted to my six pound test. I just knew my nice straight tails were rigged ""right"" and that he might have just been lucky. But after 4 to zip, I rigged my tail on crooked and proceeded to pound them. You just never know what is going to work; but I never go to Canada without about 25 twister tails and some super glue."
