I don't want to bring my vexilar because I want to be able to see structure and speed on the go. Obviously, I don't want to bring a huge marine battery that weighs a ton if smaller vexilar/marcum batteries will work. Thanks for the help."

Works well, at high speed it is a little touchy, but nice not dealing with suction cups and the such. Charge the vex battery everyother night and good to go."
