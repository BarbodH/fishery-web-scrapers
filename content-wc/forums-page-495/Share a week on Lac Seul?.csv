After weeks of research and discussion with a buddy, we had decided to book a housekeeping cabin at Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul during the week of June 25th to July 2nd. But, just as we are about to pull the trigger, his boss nixes his vacation request, so he's out. Unfortunately for me, that week is my only real opening for the summer, and having already gotten permission from the wife to go, I'm loathe to give it up. Going solo really isn't an option. Here's the basic plan, I anticipate leaving the Twin Cities very early on the morning of June 25th. I figure on buying most of our groceries and beer after crossing the border. I plan to make it a multi-species trip: fishing for walleyes for the pan, but also spending some time going after pike and muskies, and maybe even chasing some smallies. I'm 44 years old; married, and two kids. I'm a non-smoker. I'm a good cook, and will happily do all the cooking in exchange for dishes assistance. I like to have a beer or two in the evening, but I'm not a party animal. I'm there to fish. Cost is $895/person, which includes the rental boat and all boat gas. We would split groceries, bait cost and gas to get there and back. Anyone interested in joining me? If so, PM me, and we can introduce ourselves and discuss this. Thanks for your consideration, Bill"
