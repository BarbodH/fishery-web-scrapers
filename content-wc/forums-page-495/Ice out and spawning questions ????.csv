1303231,Ogoki,2011-05-05 10:29:00,291,As I have for years went to Ontario mid-June thru mid-September I am really not all that familiar with fishing just after ice out . I do realize the fish will be shallow . I hear some say the spawn messed them up etc. What is actually the prime time to be there for walleye or pike in relation to ice out ?? Very rarely do we not get into big numbers of walleye in mid-June . I have caught my big numbers of large pike then and also the first half of September . Just curious as to what you think is prime in relation to ice out ?? Thanks !!
1303250,Jack77,2011-05-05 11:24:00,168,"I was wondering the same thing, if the late ice out would push the spawn back and consequently keep the walleye schooled up and shallower later into June?"
1303291,Obabikon,2011-05-05 13:39:00,2370,"The absolute best time for BIG pike is when the ice is still on the lake, but breaking up. Maybe a week ago for LOTW's (if you could get to a creek coming into the lake). The best ""legal"" time for Walleye is probably going to be Memorial Day. Directly after the spawn, when they're still in shallow. Numbers and big ones typically. All that said, the Canadian Shield lakes provide awesome fishing for both those species almost year round."

I've found Lac Seul to be similar, and, while spawning wil lbe delayed with a late ice-out, I think you'll be fine in the shallows well into mid June. Once we get to mid-June, I arrive for a week, and after we're done, all the shallows in Lac Seul are totally devoid of fish, and you're on your own."
1303524,BenBeattie,2011-05-06 06:30:00,232,"Definitely a late ice out year here in NW Ontario. I've heard the ice is is pretty much off Eagle/LOTW but Lac Seul is starting to break up in areas, especially around the east end where we have a lot of current areas. Bottom line, late ice out on East end Lac Seul (Sioux Lookout) means excellent early season walleye fishing because we can fish for them while they are still stacked in the current (spawning) areas. Without current, it's all about water temperature. If you're here and it's in the 40's you can bet fish will be sluggish. This is when it really pays to find areas that are just a few degrees warmer then the rest of the lake. Typically shallow areas on mainland shorelines, bays with shallow avg. water depths or areas where cheeks/rivers enter the lake. On a sunny day you can even notice the difference between morning and afternoons... once the sun warms some surface water, the afternoon bite should pick up. Wind can also be used to your advantage as a breeze will push warming surface water to certain areas. Following the wind is never a bad idea when it comes to finding fish. As for ""Prime-time"" in relation to ice out.... again, water temperature is key. 60 deg (give or take a few degrees) will happen sometime in June and is always great fishing.... they aren't too deep yet and the action is explosive. IMO June is the best month for catching numbers of walleye on Lac Seul."

We have fished the same river system since I was 8 (now 37) and no matter what time of year it is (granted I have never been there right after ice out) the fish are always in the exact same spots. Granted there are times like 2009 when it was literally 18 incher after 18 incher for hours. I had 15, 14, and 13 casts in a row with Walleyes.But normally, we can go from place to place until we find where the fish are. Always 6-12 FOW along the edges of weedbed adjacent to deeper water. Occasionally we will dip minnows into deeper holes if all else fails but from everything I have read on here and other places, the weather and timing really determines where the fish are at other places. Very interesting."
1303700,Freytown,2011-05-06 12:27:00,770,I start watching the weather forecasts for my locations.http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/canada_e.htmlYou can see how things are warming up and see how the daylight keeps expanding at this time of the year. Ice ice out early or late don't bother me because I don't go until 6/10. I know it will be gone-zo by then.
