I know where our Lake/River is and depending on how clear it is, I can see if there is still ice. This probably is no good for your Western Ontarioers.Satellite ViewI always right click and save the image then open it up in paint so I can zoom in to where I need to look.Map Key: White is ice, Dark is not. Hope it helps. RC"
