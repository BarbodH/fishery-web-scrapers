1301919,wallydave,2011-05-02 06:57:00,2151,"Dutchies has always been part of the fabric of each trip I have made to Las Seul! I have stopped there for beer, licenses, and Cuban cigars as part of each trip. I'm glad there still open! Thanks for the reminder, just a few more weeks to go!"
1302158,Skywagon,2011-05-02 17:27:00,1106,What town is home Wallydave?
1302286,wallydave,2011-05-03 04:33:00,2151,"Skywagon, I sent you a PM"
1302294,Skywagon,2011-05-03 05:16:00,1106,"Thanks, I replied via PM."
1293765,wallydave,2011-04-12 09:00:00,2151,"Thanks Blue LK! It is too bad things have not moved along in rebuilding! It always seemed that they stayed busy, and employeed lots of local employees! Did you post they had opened up a gift shop near by? My boat and cabin buddy is coming up for his first trip to Ontario, we can't find the red eyed wigglers around here in Cen. Il. I have always had good luck with pike hitting the wigglers!"
1293819,Blue Lk,2011-04-12 11:18:00,269,"Dave,if you drive about 1 mile west of Village Corner there is a pretty good tackle shop,Bobby's is located on HWY 17.The place across the street from the corner(old Red Eagle building)also may have what you are looking for.The gift shop beside Village Corner had no tackle the last time I was in there.This may change.Say Hello to Andrea for me,tell her from Dan's cousin."
1293835,JayM5209,2011-04-12 11:53:00,1050,Looks as though Bobby's will be a busy place this summer! The line to those one hole restrooms will probably be longer than the line for licenses.
1293849,wallydave,2011-04-12 12:56:00,2151,"Blue LK, I'll pass along your hello! Does Andrea give family discounts for fishing! Just kidding!"
1293883,v-bay gord,2011-04-12 14:48:00,3168,"Jay, rest easy knowing that Bobby's has added another couple of bathrooms!"
1293910,Golden Eagle,2011-04-12 16:13:00,2642,What happened to stopping along the highway going north?
1294037,Skywagon,2011-04-13 04:03:00,1106,"Golden Eagle,Didn't you hear the road to Red Lake is closed this year and only open to locals? Of course for a fee..... With these high gas prices it doesn't hurt to have a side line business."
1294078,Golden Eagle,2011-04-13 07:06:00,2642,Count me in. I'll pay. Looking forward to knocking down 2 or 3 piles of rocks on my stops. Should be a bounty on those who spray paint huge rocks.
1294951,Skywagon,2011-04-15 04:39:00,1106,"The piles of rocks are distracting from the scenery, knock down a couple for me, as for the painters, grrrr. I came south on 502 early Saturday morning (heading to Illinios for the spring ritual) and could not see any piles of rocks or paintings, they were still covered with snow, but that is changing. I did see a total of 4 cars, 1 lynx and three grouse."
1301770,NWE,2011-05-01 19:35:00,13,"You can count on Dutchie's in Perrault Falls for all you gas, wet and dry ice, beer, liquor and light tackle needs. They stock everything you would need for your stay and trip home."
1276670,wallydave,2011-03-01 13:10:00,2151,"Thanks V-bay Gord, after following the resort thread, who ever was to reopen the Village Corner would be facing some of the same problems as a resort owner, if the average age of US fishers is going up, and less making the trip up North for fishing, less business for the gas station as well. Hopefully there is enough local business to make it worth while in reopening, we always stopped there for gas, dry ice and a few Cuban cigars, hopefully Dutchies will take on the dry ice business, we can always gas up in Ear Falls before we head home. Places that have been part of so many fishing trips to LS, become part of the memories that we treasure about our adventures!"
1276696,Blue Lk,2011-03-01 14:07:00,269,"Dave,there is gas,dry ice & cubans available 1 mile west of the Village Corner,I'm talking cigars not people"
1276697,wallydave,2011-03-01 14:19:00,2151,"Unlike the cigars, would the cuban people need passports to get into the US!? I bet they cuban people would not have any luck in bringing cuban cigars into the US... why can't we just get along??"
1276717,v-bay gord,2011-03-01 15:18:00,3168,WalleyDave.......if you like Cuban cigars check out www.calgarycigar.com . Apparently they will ship to the US.
1277356,bpetersen,2011-03-02 21:46:00,251,"I always thought that was illegal. Quite cheap, aren't they."
1277432,wallydave,2011-03-03 07:06:00,2151,"I looked at the prices! OUCH!! Cuban cigars are like what Coors used to be, because it was hard to get it somehow seemed better. When the exchange rate was better, it was cheaper to and fun, to buy the cigars in Canada! After the sticker shock therapy, I think I will be able to get by with some cigars, that the US customs folks wont confiscate!"
1277436,tackleman,2011-03-03 07:17:00,444,"I just got home from a visit to my friends in florida and he is a big cigar smoker, so he gave me a catalogue for the place he gets his cigars at and they are really affordable, they are located in michigan but the wharehouse is in kentucky and they ship ups.i ordered 4 bags of jenuwine coronas (that's what my friend smokes) and they give you another bag free, (20 cigars in a bag). the total cost was $59.95 , so that was100 cigars for 60 bucks, that is a cheap price per cigar when you look at the cost of the little colt cigars i buy now ( $8 for 8 cigars).they have a toll free number 888-232-4427 I'm pretty sure they'll send you a brochure of the cigars they handle. (there is a lot of brands)"
1277529,wallydave,2011-03-03 10:17:00,2151,"Tackleman, thanks for the info! But, we seem to have gotten off topic with this tread, but no harm done! Like I posted before, the Corner, was part of the fabric of so many good trips, and to lose part of that fabric can be unsettling. I'm sure the trip, cigars and walleye included will be fine! I hope they can rebuild, the Corner always had plenty of staff, that will need work in the future!"
1293716,wallydave,2011-04-12 07:07:00,2151,"Now that my trip to Goose Bay is just a few days away, 53 to be exact, is there any news about the Corner Gas station in Vermillion Bay?"
1293746,Blue Lk,2011-04-12 08:15:00,269,"Sorry to say that nothing has changed regarding Village Corner Dave,the burnt out building has been left untouched."
1240179,SNOPRO,2010-10-04 08:34:00,108,Does anyone know the status on the Vermillion Bay Village Corner resturant/ tackleshop plans? Are they going to rebuild?
1240217,wallydave,2010-10-04 12:03:00,2151,"There was a post from a friend of one of the employees recently. The owners want to rebuild and reopen by next Memorial weekend 2011. I hope things go according to plan! A group of us are heading to Goose Bay next June, we always stop there for gas and dry ice on the way home!"
1251079,wallydave,2010-11-23 07:14:00,2151,Hello to our Northern walleye wranglers! Any news on the Corner Station?
1251087,Blue Lk,2010-11-23 07:38:00,269,"They have reopened the gift shop (seperate building west of gas station & diner).The burned out building is still standing.I have heard that they still plan to rebuild.Lots of different rumours floating around.Hopefully somebody with more info will post it.Winter has arrived in the area, 2 degF right now & allmost 1ft of sno in the last few days."
1251353,Fonzie,2010-11-23 20:59:00,85,"My buddy just returned from his cabin in Eagle River and he told me the same thing. I hope it gets rebuilt, but there are a lot of rumors flying around.."
1256223,Sawmills,2010-12-18 08:49:00,3,My wife is an employee their (cook) and has talked with Wayne and Holly (owners) as of right now the insurance is still up in the air and from what I gather it's been frustrating. It doesn't look good for a summer start up period. So right now their hands are tied.
1259815,Blue Lk,2011-01-05 11:57:00,269,Took this todayhttp://i631.photobucket.com/albums/u...Lake/002-8.jpg
1259849,wallydave,2011-01-05 14:28:00,2151,From the picture is looks like my group might need a new spot for dry ice on the way home from Goose Bay in June. I hope they can reopen and put thier staff back to work!
1276655,wallydave,2011-03-01 12:27:00,2151,Has any one heard any news about the Village Corner in Vermillion Bay?
1276656,v-bay gord,2011-03-01 12:39:00,3168,"No factual news, but rumors that suggest there is little progress towards rebuilding the Village Corner. I would think this property would have potential for the right investor. Instead of a thread on buying a resort, maybe someone would like to put up a gas station, restaurant, truck stop on that corner? Seems like a good location and the whole area could sure use one............ On the other hand, this could all be a rumour and maybe there are plans to rebuild..........."
