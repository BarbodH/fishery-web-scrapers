1303451,stinkycat,2011-05-05 20:52:00,2018,Baitslinger.... I read somewhere that all you have to do is put some water in the bottom/back of the boat and put your ice/ducer in the water and shoot through the hull. They said it worked great. It makes sense to me but I have never tried it.
1302725,Baitslinger,2011-05-03 21:28:00,93,"We fish a boat in lake in NWO, and for a couple years I've pondered taking in my vexilar to use when vertical jigging. I already take an older Eagle sonar unit, which works fine for structure and depth, but isnt great on showing fish.Since we boat in, weight isnt a major issue, but I dont want to haul up another gadget unless its really worthwhile. Obviously I'm going stir crazy both waiting for the annual trip right now, as well as waiting for our local lakes to turn on.Any thoughts on the value of taking in the vexilar? I don't want to spend anymore time than I have too staring at a screen (I'd rather focus on the sunset or the lovely lady in the bow of the boat), but if it makes the fishing easier & better, I don't have a problem taking it along."
1302742,Leeches,2011-05-03 22:36:00,106,"I went on a fly in and brought a vexilar along for use as a depth finder, I did not have anything rigged up to hold the ducer vertically in the water, so when drifting or backtrolling it was useless and sat in the cabin after 1st day.I would say if your able to anchor or keep the ducer as straight up and down as possible it would be lights out deadly, esp. in your own boat. Messing with rigging it up in a rental boat...I'll be better prepared next time."
1303012,Bad Santa,2011-05-04 19:01:00,100,"Bring along a 2-3' 1x2, electrical tape, and a large C-clamp. You can tape the transducer to the board, and C-clamp it to the transom. It may not be perfectly vertical, but close enough. If you don't want to marr the resort boat, bring an old bike innertube along to place over the transom prior to clamping."
1303016,wmd,2011-05-04 19:16:00,388,"I have used my Vexilar for years in Canada and is well worth taking. A Vexilar doesn't lie , when it indicates fish it is a fish. It takes practice to figure your sharp breaks compared to a graph but it can be done. You need to buy a high speed transducer as the ice puck won't work correctly while moving. You can buy a portable transducer bracket from Cabelas for about $30, mount your transducer and it clamps to the transom of the boat and is adjustable for different heights of transoms. You won't be sorry taking it, the battery will last at least 2 days of fishing if not more.wmd"
1303025,MorganMan,2011-05-04 19:31:00,341,what does a vexilar produce that a regular fish finder won't??? is it just to know that something is there? normally you are trolling or drifting at at certain depth or over structure. what advantage in walleye infested waters does that give you?
1303036,Jack77,2011-05-04 19:51:00,168,"I agree, knowing the pattern and finding the depth and structure related to that pattern have always been more important to me. I do think that in the orginal post he was talking about taking both so I say go for it. If marking the fish while you are jigging over them increases your confidence then it can't hurt. Vexilar will give you more of a ""real time"" picture of what is going on directly beneath you. You can actually see your jig go up and down as well as fish rise or fall to it, a regular fish finder isn't going to do that."
1303046,adempsey,2011-05-04 20:09:00,963,"I think it all depends on how comfortable you are using it in open water. If you have the high speed transducer, I don't see why not. If you don't, but plan to anchor, it might also be worthwhile. I brought my flasher on a trip last year to try to vertically jig for some whitefish in deeper water in the summer, but didn't have a long enough anchor so I didn't end up using it much (I only have the ice fishing transducer). I love my flasher and can understand why you would want to bring it along."
1303078,Baitslinger,2011-05-04 21:30:00,93,"Thanks for the replies.I do not have a high speed transducer. I was pretty much thinking of just tossing it out on the floating ice transducer when we're vertical jigging or slow drifting.I still have my old sonar to locate structure and depth, I just have never really trusted the fish images on it, and thought it might be fun to try the vexilar and see if makes any difference. It certainly is fun playing with the perch when we jig through the ice."
1303235,Guest,2011-05-05 10:37:00,0,If you know how to set up your fish finder it will definately do that......
1303396,v-bay gord,2011-05-05 18:48:00,3168,"I think the issue you are having with your depth finder is having it set to the fish symbol mode. Try turning that off and you will have better results locating ""actual"" fish.....it may take some practise, but well worth the effort."
