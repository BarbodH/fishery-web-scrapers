Also is there any lake troutin the north west part of lac seul , I know theres over eighty feet of water just south of lunker point, and I didnt know if there would be any in there or not have never fished for themthanks"
1302776,teddi,2011-05-04 05:36:00,349,there is a long portage from brown bear creek to the lake. if you can drag your boat across go for it. lots of small walleye and northern.[big numbers] you may have problems with the outfitter that has the outpost cabin on the lake as he thinks the lake is for his guests only. lac seul has no trout in it as the water quality is poor.
1302903,BenBeattie,2011-05-04 12:17:00,232,"There is a small population of lake trout in Lac Seul. I've heard of about 5 caught while targeting walleye in the last 7 years guiding on the lake. One was a monster, 37 or 38 inches! All were from the same area. Probalby not worth your efforts to target them but there are a few in there!!"
