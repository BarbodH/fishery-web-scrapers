Friday night, you might have a couple of cars in front of you. Sat am you talking a couple of hours, at least that is the wait in late May or early June!"
1301943,camp chef,2011-05-02 07:58:00,915,We stay at the Thunderbird reort on Rainy Lake. It just East of I Falls about 10 to 15 minutes from the border crossing. Nice rooms great food and fun cocktail lounge.
1301948,ManitouBass,2011-05-02 08:13:00,201,"Without a doubt cross the night before. I'm from Fort Frances and I can tell you the lines can be 3-4 hours long this time of year, easily.Stay at Super 8, Boston Pizza is right beside it for some good eats and drinks. Or La Place Rendezvous which is a little pricier, but has a lounge and good eats as well.If your heading NE make sure to hit up The Great Bear for a tackle run. Grab live bait at Co-Op on the way, 2 dozen=4 dozen to them, lol.Good luck and have a safe trip!"
1301986,KevinSB,2011-05-02 09:45:00,73,"Thanks for sharing all; this is news to me. We headed up last year for our first trip, driving 12 hrs to stay in IF Friday night. We were up and in line for a very short border crossing at 7am Saturday and I thought that was ideal.But if crossing lines are short going north around 6pm Friday, we might need to look at that for 2012. Just another thanks to the great folks on WC for freely sharing knowledge."
1302738,MorganMan,2011-05-03 22:23:00,341,"I second the opinion of crossing the border if you are that close. I know it's a long drive, but after Orr, there is nothing. I have stayed at the Americinn (now Gateway Lodge?) and its nice, but get across at night and you will be pleased to be able to plan the rest of your trip without the crossing unknowns. I don't know what the Rambler inn is or where its is. We stayed at the Rendezvous Inn last year and will do that going forward. OK rooms at an OK price with a restaurant and bar. You then can plan your arrival according to your plans without worrying about crossing the border."
1301360,Guest,2011-04-30 21:26:00,0,Any suggestions on a place to stay just south of I-Falls on a Friday night on way to Canada in July?
1301364,Walleye10pm,2011-04-30 21:45:00,71,We always cross over and stay in fort frances. Less wait almost always the night before than trying to cross in the morning. Super 8 has nice rooms.
1301374,rather-be-fishin,2011-04-30 22:37:00,429,"There isn't much South of Intl Falls. Try searching motels in Orr, Mn. Not a bad idea to cross the border & stay in Fort Frances. Good luck & have fun fishing!"
1301378,Nimstug,2011-04-30 22:50:00,2605,"From our location, it's about a 12 hour drive to the border, so if we want to the there at 6 PM we leave at 6 AM. We leave on a Friday, which avoids the whole Saturday possible crossing delay issue. We've crossed going north anytime between 6 PM and 8 PM. and never had more than 3 or 4 cars ahead of us.NimstugMany me fish all their lives without knowing it is not fish they are after.

1301397,Tonyo,2011-05-01 05:13:00,212,"Same goes for our group. We try to time it so we can make the border on Friday afternoon in good time so we can make it to Dryden. We have been staying at Holiday Inn Express for the past several years. It makes the border crossing quick and easy and the final drive to camp, Five Lakes on Gullrock, quick and easy on Saturday morning. TonyO"
1301424,Mark R,2011-05-01 07:03:00,1538,If your going with Iowa Farm Boy and they find his hand gun I think the folks at the border will have a place for you to stay . CHEEP
1301508,NARDA 1,2011-05-01 09:39:00,636,"Cross the border on Friday, stay overnight in the Fort it makes it alot quicker and easier. LaPlace Rendezvous 1-800-544-9435 is very nice and has a nice bar and resturant."
1301525,Fishin Fun,2011-05-01 10:18:00,218,"We do the same thing. It's 12 hours or so from my place. So we drive up to Virginia, Mn and stay on Friday night. Get up early and go to I-Falls for breakfast and get across the boarder early. Then it's off to Gull Rock."
1301528,thunderatwork,2011-05-01 10:25:00,79,"we usually stay at the rambler inn, not real fancy but they serve our needs. have a variety of different sized rooms"
1301616,clearis,2011-05-01 14:27:00,47,Orr has the Gateway Lodge & Suites (formerly AmericInn Lodge & Suites) there is much of anything between Orr and I-Falls.
