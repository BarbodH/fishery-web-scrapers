1302935,Jack77,2011-05-04 14:17:00,168,Does anybody have any info on ice out of the Nakina area lakes? I won't be up there until june 12th but I was curious about what others have heard.
1303122,oleJoe,2011-05-05 05:49:00,114,"Still iced up but heard that a good guess is before the 15th. Don't worry, you will be able to hear my screaming if not open in 3 weeks. Counting the days."
1303139,Jack77,2011-05-05 06:37:00,168,"I was told pretty much the same thing, it was going to be close for the opener. 7 day forecast for Geraldton - http://texte.weatheroffice.gc.ca/for...l?on-97&unit=mToday - high of 63Friday - high of 52Saturday - 46Sunday - 54Monday - 63Tuesday - 57Wednesday - 55- not predicting too much rain over the next 7 days."
1303224,onetimedave,2011-05-05 10:09:00,502,I heard the same thing as Ole Joe. About the 15th.
