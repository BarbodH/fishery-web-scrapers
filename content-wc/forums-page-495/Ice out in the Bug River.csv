1300468,wallydave,2011-04-28 14:06:00,2151,I heard from Andrea from Goose Bay Camp today. She thinks the ice-out for the Ear Falls section will be May 15th.
1300738,J Arendt,2011-04-29 08:12:00,45,Gotta love the forecast for Red Lake at least for today. Weekend looks shaky.
1301202,Minnow Man,2011-04-30 14:13:00,85,"Hello J. Arendt Drove up to Red Lake today, Trout River is open, Chukuni River is open, Stone Lake river is wide open & Bug River is open water from bay at Poplar Point to Gullrock Lake. Stoney Bay on Gullrock has open water, but most of the bay is still ice covered. It is melting."
1302956,tackleman,2011-05-04 15:12:00,444,"South Bay on gullrock is 1/2 open with a south wind blowing the ice onto the shore away from the tourist camp (and my dock) if it keeps up tonight, we should be ice free in another day or so."
1303215,J Arendt,2011-05-05 09:57:00,45,All will be well for the opener on Gullrock. Good luck to all and have fun.
1296463,Fishin Fun,2011-04-18 18:04:00,218,I spoke with Mary and she's betting on May 9th or so for ice out. The weather sure isn't cooperating.
1297818,tackleman,2011-04-21 19:32:00,444,several large holes of open water from the bridge down to the lake. It's looking promisingI went to the dock today and saw the ice has pulled away from the rocks.
1297855,Moondog,2011-04-21 21:11:00,362,"As long as the ""hard water"" is gone by the opener......that's all I care about. Hoping to get there a few days before that weather permitting. I think we got there last year right after they plowed or was that the year before...... Tackleman.........thanks for the updates......keep them coming!!! We will have a cold adult beverage waiting for you at Mary's."
1297952,J Arendt,2011-04-22 07:05:00,45,Tackleman --Moondog-- That was 2009 when we had all the snow. I went into town on Friday at noon on the way back the OOP had shut down the 105. I said I was heading back to Golden Hook they let me go. Almost had to spend the night in the Sobey parking lot in Red Lake. Thanks for the update. See you guys on the Gullrock.
1297977,Golden Eagle,2011-04-22 07:45:00,2642,It's an exciting time. Time of change. Planning to be there May 13-28. We'll take whatever comes our way and we'll love it.Can't think of any other place I'd rather be when ice breaks up.
1299006,J Arendt,2011-04-25 08:03:00,45,Tackleman-- How are things progressing at the Bug?-- I picked up the spinners and the weights you talked about. May 18th cant get here soon enough. Thanks for all your help.
1299173,mswope13,2011-04-25 16:37:00,73,"Can anyone tell me what the lake looks like? When does the ice typically melt off? When does the die hards get out for the first boat trip out?Thanks all,Colorado"
1299259,tackleman,2011-04-25 20:11:00,444,"the river is open from the bridge to the lake and almost back to the boat launch, Thelake is not showing any sign of thawing but most of the guys I talked to in Red Lake this weekend tell me the ice is really going fast and is unsafe to walk on. so I can only assume gullrock is in the same condition. (I haven't been down tothe dock to check it) Any way, it should be long gone by the 18th of may."
1299371,J Arendt,2011-04-26 07:17:00,45,Tackleman-- Thanks for the update--good thing its a late opener.
1300435,J Arendt,2011-04-28 13:06:00,45,According to the reports Red lake looks like upper 60's for Friday. That should give things a boost.
1293440,J Arendt,2011-04-11 12:58:00,45,Hey--Tackleman what does the Bug look like these days?
1293502,tackleman,2011-04-11 15:44:00,444,"it looks pretty brown with slush on the top of it. but the creeks are running, the snow is going fast and it shouldn't be long before the bug starts to open (i hope)"
1294971,J Arendt,2011-04-15 06:22:00,45,Tackleman-- How are things looking at the Bug these days? Is the ice tight to the shoreline on Gullrock? As always thanks for your help.
1295164,tackleman,2011-04-15 14:00:00,444,"everything is still frozen solid. the lake has 10 inches of snow on top of a pile of slush then lots of ice under it. it hasn't started to break away from the shore . Bug river has a bit of a hole in the ice under the bridge but with the cold temps over the past few days, that has frozen again. the weather man is calling for another 4 cm of snow over the next 2 days, so it's going to be a while ."
1295315,Fishin Fun,2011-04-15 20:45:00,218,God I love it up there. Every year when we spend a week with Mary at South Bay I think about the fishing almost every day until I come back the next year. To have that kind of fishing around you all the time must be fun. Thanks for keeping us updated!
1295341,tackleman,2011-04-15 23:16:00,444,"in my previous post I mentioned we are expecting snow this weekend. the reason, Mary got home yesterday.Every year when she gets home from Florida we get dumped on, I keep telling her to stay in the south, but she never does."
1295431,Fishin Fun,2011-04-16 07:43:00,218,"How much snow did you get? The southern suburbs of the Twin Cities got 4.5"" last night. Luckily we only got a dusting of snow, but it's still only 32 degrees."
1295447,tackleman,2011-04-16 08:12:00,444,"I went to bed at 2am and there was nothing, this morning at 8am we had received 2 inches and they are calling for another 4 1/2 to 5 inches today."
1296358,J Arendt,2011-04-18 13:44:00,45,Tackleman--I'm getting bad vibes on ice out--maybe its a good thing that the walleye opener is late this year.
1296451,tackleman,2011-04-18 17:17:00,444,"well we got 1 month to the opener and there is no evidence the ice has even lifted. the temps at night have been in the -teens so that doesn't help and the 6-8 inches of snow we got on the weekend isn't great either.On the other hand, the weatherman is saying we will be in the +teens by the weekend so maybe the melt will kick in the ice will go fast. (hopefully)"
1285786,J Arendt,2011-03-23 08:42:00,45,Tackleman-- Thanks for all of your help regarding the spinners. One more favor if possible-- please--. keep me posted as to ice out on the Bug River. The pike fishing should be outstanding.
1285814,Moondog,2011-03-23 09:19:00,362,Ditto!!! Only 59 days...........
1285831,tackleman,2011-03-23 10:12:00,444,"Hi guys, I'll let you know when the Bug opens up.Gotta tell you though, we had another 8 inches of snow last week and it is going down to - 25 degrees at night so there isn't much of a thaw happening up here right now."
1285833,Golden Eagle,2011-03-23 10:13:00,2642,Thanks for the good fishing spot. I cross Bug River a few times every season.Will hit the bridge across Bug River around 5 p.m. May 13.
1285923,Moondog,2011-03-23 13:16:00,362,Just talked to Mary Spenceley (South Bay on Gull Rock) and she is planning to be back on April 14th.......snow or no snow.......she's had it in LaLa land (Florida) as she calls it. Told her we would race her there!!!! Last year we put in at her boat launch because the water level was high enuf but before that we always used the Bug ramp. It's ok with me if the ice doesn't go out until May 20th........may be a tad chilly tho.
1286154,tackleman,2011-03-24 05:38:00,444,"the later that Mary comes back, the better, for the last 5 years every week she came home, we got a wallop of snow, I blame her for bringing it north with her. hopefully this year will break the cycle"
1290519,tackleman,2011-04-03 20:42:00,444,this past weekend my neighbour had a fish derby beside our houses and they caught several big northern and a number of walleye.the weather is warming up and water is on the lake under the snow (about 4 inches of it). hopefully it goes soon .but it sure looks like the big boys are moving toward the spawning grounds.
1290746,J Arendt,2011-04-04 12:52:00,45,Tackleman-- Thanks for the update. Could a guy get a room at Howey Bay Motel if the camps are not open if the ice goes out ?
1290748,J Arendt,2011-04-04 12:57:00,45,Tackleman-- Thanks for the update. Could a guy get a room at Howey Bay Motel if the camps are not open if the ice goes out ?
1291804,tackleman,2011-04-06 19:12:00,444,"I;m sure you'd be able to get a room in town if the camps aren't open, but you should book ahead if you plan on coming early."
