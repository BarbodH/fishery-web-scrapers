1303131,Obabikon,2011-05-05 06:14:00,2370,"I'm out on our island out of morson. A couple patches of snow still fighting, but no ice."
1303219,1shooter,2011-05-05 10:01:00,1493,Nice....you working on finishing the Ice House? We can't wait to try it out in June when we come up.
1303361,Obabikon,2011-05-05 17:22:00,2370,We're working our tails off! Monday I'll have 7 guys out here all running around!

1303410,Ia Walihntr,2011-05-05 19:21:00,320,http://ge.ssec.wisc.edu/modis-today/ Click on the area of the map you want. When that comes up you can zoom from 2000 miles to 250 miles. You can also look back to previous days if you can't see what you want because of cloud cover.
1298563,whitedot,2011-04-23 20:18:00,8,Anyone have any guestimations on when its going to be semi-boatable?
1298673,Obabikon,2011-04-24 07:39:00,2370,I'm hoping May 1st... at least for the southern half.
1298697,wallydave,2011-04-24 08:48:00,2151,"http://www.tomahawkresort.ca/ReginaBayCamera.cfm Check out the webcam, plus they post ice-out pics on the message board!"
1299374,wallydave,2011-04-26 07:22:00,2151,Check out the progress on LOW!http://www.tomahawkresort.com/images...DSC00109_1.JPG
1299392,rpieske,2011-04-26 07:50:00,1276,Here's another webcam view out of Morson to the South...http://www.redwinglodge.net/webcam/ I think May 1st is a pretty good guess for ice out on LOTW.
1301216,Guest,2011-04-30 15:14:00,0,"Check out some neat video clips of the ice going out on Lake of the Woods in Sioux Narrows posted by Tomahawk Resort on the Tomahawk Resort facebook Page. http://www.facebook.com/tomahawkresort They facebook page is kept very active, become a fan and follow what is happening on Lake of the Woods around the Tomahawk Resort area."
1301217,Guest,2011-04-30 15:21:00,0,Looks like it will be all out for May 1st!
1301264,J-Man,2011-04-30 18:22:00,191,"The ice went out of our bay sometime after Wed night and before this morning. I didnt get a chance to run up and look out west, but will probably do that tomorrow.Time to get the water fired up and look forward to seeing everyone enjoy their fishing trips!"
1301311,Ia Walihntr,2011-04-30 20:07:00,320,"Satellite image of LOTW for April 29 shows Big Traverse Bay still pretty much socked in with ice. Open water for a few miles around convergence with the Rainy River. Some shore ice gone on the south west corner of Big Traverse, and several big cracks in the ice mantle covering Big Traverse with biggest running from open water near the Rainy all the way to open water near Angle Inlet. Scattered open water north and east of the Inlet. Stevens Bay, Stoney Bay and most of the water south toward Nestor Falls route appears to be gone. Some open water in areas from Hay Island toward the west. View from Redwing Lodge webcam shows their bay open with maybe a little ice left in the distance. Looks very promising. Water temps should almost mirror the 2009 opener. Should be a good opener! What do you think Justin---Jared? Marv"
