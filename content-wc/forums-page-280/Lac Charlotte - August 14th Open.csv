We're hoping some lucky anglers will take our week. Last August at Charlotte my group of 4 caught northern pike to 44 inches and over 500 walleye. We have fished with other outfitters, but Air Tamarac is the best. The cabin is but 3 years old and the only one on the lake - so it's your private domain. Check out Air Tamarac's website and contact them if you're interested."
