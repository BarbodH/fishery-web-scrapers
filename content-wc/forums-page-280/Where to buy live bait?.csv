There is a bait shop in I-Falls behind the Holiday station coming up 53 on the south end of town that packs crawlers for Canada. Depending on the route into Canada and how far you're going, there may be Canadian bait shop alternatives as well."

3851737,ftfarms,2015-05-08 11:20:00,444,Is that where the big walleyes at? Or is Jim's north of there? Thanks.
3851881,camp chef,2015-05-08 12:03:00,915,No The Big Walleye is a little north of Jim's . It is a huge store and Spur gas station at the corner of Hwy 53 and the Ash river trail.www.jimsashtrailstore.com/
3851889,ftfarms,2015-05-08 12:08:00,444,For some reason I thought that road was ash river trail. Thanks just making sure incase we order some worms from there. My buddy Steve orderd them last year and we thought he got them from one place and he ordered them from a differant. So I'm just making sure so that don't happen again. Thanks again.

3846217,Guest,2015-05-06 20:18:00,0,"Where do you buy your live bait? Specifically looking at getting either a 1/2 flat of crawlers or full flat. Looked a little online and see several different places. Speedy, Vados, WHolesale, etc. Any recommendations?"
3846337,JayM5209,2015-05-06 20:46:00,1050,"I've used Knutson's in Michigan and Vados several times (crawlers only). No complaints about either . . . prices were fair, good quality, delivery to your door when you specify. I'd use either one again. If you're buying crawlers to take to Canada, specify that when you order and they'll come packed in appropriate bedding.http://www.knutsonlivebait.com/index.htmlhttp://www.vadosbait.com/The last several years I've bought a flat of crawlers for my early season group trip at Dutchie's in Perrault Falls. If you are going north on Hwy. 105 to Perrault or beyond, it's an easy way to do it. Call ahead so they have a flat waiting for you. Number is (807)529-6556.And eggs are available at any of the food stores in Dryden."
3846345,halfmoon007,2015-05-06 20:47:00,121,we use Knutsonlivebait.com nice crawlers available on his web site

3847345,bus33,2015-05-07 07:52:00,289,We get a flat from Cabelas on the way up. It has always worked well.
3848833,Baseline,2015-05-07 14:20:00,3207,You can buy a flat in the US. Just have them packed in paper bedding. Throw them in a cooler and use frozen water bottles to keep them cool. Ba aware that Larry's in Kekabecka (?) Falls will sometimes close in mid-afternoon. Otherwise its a great bait shop.
