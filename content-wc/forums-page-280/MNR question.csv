Got checked by the MNR, no problems, they checked boat, tackle boxes, etc. They then asked about and inspected our coolers, ones that were outside and in the cab of our truck. But they never asked about anything we might have had in our popup camper that was on the truck. They even had a drug sniffing dog checking things out. Just curious if the camper is off limits to them, as if it were our residence. I would certainly have allowed them access if they had asked as we had nothing to hide but was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience."

The only issues I get with consent is when there is something to hide but if I think there will be dope or it's a regular I would already have a dog enroute. I am amazed with the amount of people that do not know there rights, I don't say that to be condescending but people should know their rights."
3884369,roscoe33,2015-05-18 22:33:00,653,"Maybe they didn't want to dig through your dirty underwear. Where'd you fish up the Graham? Plan on going up to Alley, and possible put in at the north end of Pakashkan, next month."
3884617,centralstater,2015-05-19 05:29:00,20,we were on grassy lake. you have to carry the boat to get in there so that keeps lots of people out. The road was good the first part but not so good later. I think the frost was still coming out and the loggers were hitting it pretty hard.
3886849,centralstater,2015-05-19 17:22:00,20,I guess I was just surprised that after being so thorough with their search that they never bothered to ask if they could look in the camper.
3887873,Curryale,2015-05-20 03:46:00,50,"I understand that a Conservation Officer has an ""expanded"" search power beyond that of a police officer in Ontario for instance; that is why they can search your truck, coolers ect without regular grounds necessary for another enforcement officer to do so. I don't believe that the expanded search power extends to your residence, cabin or otherwise which could be the reason why they didn't search it."

3890081,chris.brock,2015-05-20 15:53:00,112,"I've had them come into the cabin and check the fridge/ freezer so I can't see why the truck/ camper would be off limits. Then again, I'm not sure if they can have the authority to do that or not."
