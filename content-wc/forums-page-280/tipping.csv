The service that is provided by a person that works for the outfitter, and provides a service. its up to you to determin, you feel that that person went above and beyond, there normal duty. Example- We flyin to a remote camp north end of the lake,the caretakers job is to make sure that the cabin is clean ,you have clean boats, gas, propane, everything in working order. Part of his job.We sometimes have him to dinner with us or just a few beers,he checks on the camp every two days 6 miles to main camps from the remote camp. We cgook and bring in all our food drinks and gear. Tipping the pilot is a must for me even I know he gets paid to do it. Your life is in his hands. On a all inclusive trip were everything is done for you,cooking, guides , fish cleaned ,basicly you show up and fish.. those people are performing a service and should be tipped if your service is good."
3875426,jfaisten,2015-05-16 05:51:00,1060,10%/20% across the board depending on the level of service. Last year we gave the owners a big tip because they really went out of their way for us. Other times it's been a nominal tip because we were treated indifferently.
3875738,packpro,2015-05-16 07:30:00,695,"Our group-8 guys'. We throw $50.00 in a pot up from $40.00 a few years ago. Total $400.00. We think we are getting great value for that investment. This crew, in addition to the fishing is why we consistently return to the camp. Here's our break down: Main dock hand $160.00 + 2 cases of Budweiser delivered on arrival. Why so much. He delivers the gear when we arrive and picks it up when we leave. He help load the boats in the morning and unloads them at night. He helps clean the fish. Does odd jobs around the camp while we are fishing. Joins us for laughs and a few beers every night. And, most importantly he is also the camp guide. Once we deliver the beer. One of us will walk out with a marked map of 16-20 locations. We see him fishing those spots all week. All he asks is that we don't fish them when he is in there. No worries all the other spots will be producing. That small investment makes our week. He is also quite the comedian. Worth every penny. The cook gets $80.00. Makes lunch if there is no shore lunch that day (portages). Home made bread, and home made desserts all week. Makes breakfast and dinner. There is a second dock person who power washes the boats, re fuels, get bait, brings coffee to the cabin in the morning, etc. he gets 80.00. The cabin attendant gets $80 also. She serves meals morning and night, preps the cabin for arrival, give the floor in the cabin a quick sweep, lays out towels, and makes the beds. We might be on the high side, but three members of our group are 70+ so we draw more than normal service. Our routine has us putting the money in individual envelopes. If we have a rookie with us he makes the personal delivery,and expresses our gratitude at the end of the week. Best $50 we spend all week."

3881265,fish007,2015-05-18 10:04:00,120,"Thanks for everyones input , I didn't think about tipping the pilot . Like I said we have a very large group going. We are pretty much self sufficient but just taking care of the boats for a crew our size is going to be a job. Have a great summer !"
3886097,Baseline,2015-05-19 13:21:00,3207,"I don't think that tipping staff at a resort is necessary. I've used resorts in Canada for 35 years. I make between 4 and 6 trips a year. Most of the time my group is using housekeeping cabins and cooking our own food. About the only time we see staff is if we need gas or minnows. Other than that we are usually left on our own. I have used probably 40 different resorts and this kind of operation is standard. For the weekly or daily rate I pay for a cabin I expect the cabin to be clean, stocked with necessities, all appliances and lights in working condition. I also expect all resort facilities to be in good condition. I see no reason to tip someone pumping gas or dipping some minnows. I also see no reason to tip anyone for coming in and cleaning the place when I leave especially when most resorts have a checkout list that includes washing dishes, sweeping floors, wiping down counters, etc. Any additional cleaning is paid for as part of the rental. I would feel different is the staff grabbed my boat when I returned to the dock, cleaned it up, topped off the gas, plugged in the charger and made sure I had a supply of minnows ready in the morning. I have yet to stay at that place. My general view on tipping is that it is never required and is entirely up to the individual whether to tip or not."
3886153,MrSimon,2015-05-19 13:52:00,922,"I think pilots should always be tipped. We gave ours about $60 each way.I would imagine it's somewhat expected that dock-hands and other service staff receive tips if they work hard to make your stay more comfortable.Remember though, you are already paying a premium to stay at a lodge with extra staff, so it's kind of like paying twice."
3872361,fish007,2015-05-15 06:44:00,120,I'm going on a fly in trip next week . Having never been on one I was wondering what the rule of thumb is on tipping . The place we're going to is first class and I don't want to insult anyone as I hope to go back next year if things work out . We have a large group going and I was thinking we should all chip in ? Any input would be appreciated
3872969,Bstar,2015-05-15 09:38:00,564,"In my opinion, if the service is good then a tip should be given. I don't care if it's at a restaurant, a hotel or a fly-in camp. A group tip at the end of the week I'm sure would be much appreciated by the help at the camp."
3873585,octanehi5,2015-05-15 12:53:00,1104,"My crew and i fly in every yr. We tip our pilot $20 a man Both in and out,How you deal with camp personal is up to you as to the service you receive. Remember your not tipping the owner your tipping the workers."
3873761,Shellback,2015-05-15 13:53:00,8083,"Not to highjack this thread, but what about camps where they just provide room and dockage, with no basic personal service. Do you tip the camp owners?"
3873793,Juls,2015-05-15 14:00:00,13414,No. Why would you? There is not service given. You paid them for the room and the dock.
3873865,dkrusin,2015-05-15 14:23:00,97,"I totally disagree. The service is a clean cabin when you get there, everything working, a nice secure dock, a tip on where the fish are biting, a clean bug free fish house and someone around when you need gas, minnows or a wrench. 9 of us leave between 40 and 50 bucks a person on the kitchen table and leave the cabin spotless. Treat the camp owners good and the benefits are priceless."
3874081,Bakefish,2015-05-15 15:41:00,1077,That's why I'm always the last to check out of camp.
3874537,forgop,2015-05-15 18:59:00,880,"Sorry, but I feel like the above is what you're already paying for. Essentially, you're paying for the group ahead of you cleaning after themselves and the outfitter to provide the stuff they're already supposed to do."
3874553,NP4ME,2015-05-15 19:13:00,378,"I agree. Do you tip a hotel maid for your room being clean when you get there? I guess I'm cheap, but I would never tip for a simple room/dock package. I completely agree with Juls...you already paid for that."
3874657,Juls,2015-05-15 19:36:00,13414,"Your description is not what his sounded like. I would agree with you if someone is there to help make your stay more comfortable by dong those things for you. For example, if they just drop you off at an island for the week, and you're on your own, there's no reason to leave a tip."
