3885209,U D,2015-05-19 08:28:00,249,First timer to Canada here. What is this Partially refundable HST tax? Logistically - how do we go about getting our refund? Anybody have any experience with this?

It will get you started with most of the info you need.http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tp.../fctp-eng.htmlWhether or not you're eligible for the 50% refund depends on the package you paid for. It must include at least two eligible services, and your receipt must specify what they are. A few outfitters are kind enough to complete and file the form for you. Otherwise, you print the form from the CRA's web site and complete and mail it yourself. It is very simple and easy to do.Also, there have been a lot of threads on this forum in recent years discussing your question. If you use the Search function at the top of this page and look for HST tax rebate (or similar search term) you'll find a ton of information . . . . . plus a whole lot of opinions!Good luck. It really is an easy process and if your package qualifies you stand to receive a check for half the HST you were charged."
