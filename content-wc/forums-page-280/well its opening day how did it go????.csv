3884481,Freytown,2015-05-19 04:04:00,770,Did you fish near Saraana west cabins?
3884505,octanehi5,2015-05-19 04:46:00,1104,with the water that cold they did ok
3890545,whitewatersalvo,2015-05-20 18:35:00,11,"No we did a lot of fishing right in East Saraana Bay, and moved into the main bay thelast day to find some bigguns."
3876953,alanexpup,2015-05-16 19:31:00,278,"HI. It was opening day, so we all want to know how it went on the lake you were on. from lake of the woods to lac saul and red lake to Perrault falls how was the fishing and size???? I was looking at the dock cam at manotak lodge on parrault lake and only saw a few people. they dressed like the weather was not cold but it was hard to tell about the fish from their expression. let us know. please. thanks"
3877465,bthomas3333,2015-05-17 06:04:00,465,Weather was good. Nice breeze low 60s in the am. High 60s in the afternoon. Sunny day. We are walleye fishermen and although we fished a little for pike and smallies and caught a few. The walleye were the primary target for us. Fishing Hawk Lake delivered what we wanted. We got a 29 and 29 1/2 in the last 2 hrs of fishing...perfect day for what we wanted. The walleye bite this early is tough. The water was between 45-49 degrees. Most of the walleyes were caught in 48+. Now today and Monday are a different story because we may struggle to get out and stay on the water as the weather goes to ****. Good thing there is hockey this afternoon and a bar to watch it in. B-
3878457,freespoolin,2015-05-17 11:32:00,472,"fished Perch Bay on the Winnipeg River near Kenora. It was more fishin than catchin. Due to the slot limit there we released as many as we could keep, as several were over the size allowed. The largest walleye was 27"". But Saturday May 16th was a beautiful day. Sunny, warm with light winds. Great to be on the water in NW Ontario again. BTW, the lake level is very low."
3878769,fishman10,2015-05-17 14:15:00,226,"Fished lac des Mille lac near Thunder Bay. Didn't get out till 1 pm, hot day, no wing, lake was like glass. Fish were hungry. Decent limits in an hour."
3878945,Golden Eagle,2015-05-17 15:52:00,2642,"Fished Little Vermilion Friday and got one pike about 38"" and several smaller pike.Weather was much nicer Saturday and I got 6 pike 40"" - 43"". Our dinner was walleyes 14"" to about 15.5"". Little males were happy to see us and squirted the evidence.Big wind and rain about to start freezing is keeping us in the cabin today. We'll be catching our walleye dinner from the dock as wrap around waves are coming in, which should turn on a walleye bite."
3878961,Obabikon,2015-05-17 15:58:00,2370,"Saturday was great... walleye were fast and easy. BIG small mouth, lots of pike... several crappie. Even had a few muskies up to the boat (just following, no strikes)"
3879401,prov1800,2015-05-17 18:41:00,5010,Agreed yesterday was a very good day.but quit a turn around today
3879681,Glenman12,2015-05-17 19:37:00,762,"according to Accuweather..low of 29 tonight with a high of 37 tomorrow with snow, sleet and rain..enjoy.."
