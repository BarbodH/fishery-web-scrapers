3889249,KoolBlue,2015-05-20 11:26:00,23,Headed up to Demi-Lune for the 4th time this year leaving on June 11th. I've fished there plenty of times and always had great luck but was wondering if anyone has made it up that way and what the lakes/weather/ice look like. I know it's always hit or miss with weather and we usually hit it pretty good but any info would be appreciated.
