Used to beach the boats on sand below the cabins. Always enjoyed it there, but like others we eventually moved on.Wouldn't mind going back someday, but just too many other lakes to fish between now and then.Again, thanks for the memories.Pooch"
3562754,Erie Ranger620,2015-02-19 21:29:00,74,Yeah the best lake I have fished in Canada. My brother Mr Minnow Jigger is right place is awesome lots of numbers easy to target on typical walleye structure and catch them up to 30 inches. Typical the time I go is last of June but have fished in August where they are deeper on structure 20 plus feet or a less used technique is bottom bouncer worm harnesses on 20-30ft flats. Here was one morning last year on OS http://youtu.be/bmZlv-6OMxM and I have a ton more vids on my blog walleyewarrior.blogspot.com just scroll down have videos from about the last 5 yrs there. I try not think about Canada to much do not want to peak to early.

3503402,jwbsub,2015-02-03 02:26:00,5,I go up to Lake O'Sullivan in Ontario last week in June / 1st week in July with the wife every year. We do OK on walleye and lake trout but only catch the odd perch worth keeping. She really likes perch fishing so we try every year but with limited success. Is there a decent perch fishery on this lake and if so where do they hang out late June early July. What sort of structure and depth should I be looking at. Thanks

3506130,Live to jig,2015-02-03 20:03:00,159,"I believe I heard that they catch them in the river where the ""Other Camp"" is, otherwise just a few here and there. Reminds me of the year that a very good friend in cabin 1 said there were no perch in the lake, so we caught one and put it in his minnow bucket one night after taking the minnows he had left out....very good prank! Love that lake going in June and July this year!!!"
3506250,adempsey,2015-02-03 21:15:00,963,Find patches of cabbage and you should find perch.
3508050,Bill Krejca,2015-02-04 14:40:00,6107,"Interesting question. I have not caught one there yet. I know some folks do, it seems to be in the same category as sharing one's favorite mushroom hunting spot. Or a hot bite on Iowa's Lake Rathbun. If I were to target them, I'd look at getting into some very weedy and shallow bays. Also, perhaps a trip to one of the connected lakes would probably be helpful. I've seen pictures of some dandies from there, just a matter of wanting to ""pay one's dues."" Bill"
3508082,Mr Ranger,2015-02-04 14:50:00,272,"I caught a few one year up in the river channel but were quite small. Have heard of other guys that have done very well. Seeing them in the freezer they never seemed to have much size. I blame that on the walleye. As far as the story from ""Live to Jib"" and putting the perch in his buddies minnow bucket. What I heard is that this same buddy hid it in his duffel bag that day. Bet that really stunk when he got back to GA Good luck on the perch partner."
3520226,Guest,2015-02-08 07:08:00,0,"minnow I talked to shelly the owner of the resort yesterday and she stated its realistic to catch 25/walleyes/man/day on lake for 8 hrs of solid fishing has that your experience we plan on doing trip in mid September 4 fishermen out of Chicago the price seems good we housekeep any thoughts, suggestions, or comments you have resort would be appreciated she is almost booked for the whole summer which seems positive ;we will bring one 17' boat with brand new 10 hp motor and other 2 fishermen will use camp boat we fish 75% walleyes jigging and 25% northerns trolling and casting jim wolf Chicago boys"
3520962,Mr Ranger,2015-02-08 10:19:00,272,I think Shelly is very safe with that number but believe it to be even higher. We are always looking for bigger fish so unlike in WI we will leave fish if they tend to be on the smaller size in search of bigger fish. If the concern is that she might be stretching it I think it is a very conservative number. We catch a LOT of fish from 22 - 27 inches and a couple over that every year. Have never been up there in the fall and would think that will be very fun. Don't overlook the Lake Trout. That is a real hoot. Enjoy
