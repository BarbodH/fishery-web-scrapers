Im just guessing but this would have been our 10th or so trip together, almost exclusively with TLO. So we werent ""green"" on the ins and outs of being at a camp, but what happened goes to shows in a split second, things change. It was the 2nd last day, all had been going great,everything, the camp,boats,motors,fishing,etc. We had had a night of rain, but it had stopped for the days fishing to begin. Breakfast done,all cleaned up and my father, now 70, had walked out the door out onto the small porch and hit the top step which was wet and went face first down 3-4 steps and landed on the ground hitting his head off a stump. We all heard it,heard him moan and im sure some of you have been there, that sick feeling you get when you know **** welll something just went wrong. We found him basically semi conscious, face down, moaning. This group, on a whole had been or still are firefighters in Hamilton and i guess we all kinda tapped into some of that to access my dad. Realizing he was conscious was a big plus, but he was in big pain in his abdomen,side and back. So we were looking at broken ribs, possible punctured spleen,liver,etc and also a concussion for sure. Here comes in the SAT phone that proved to be a possible lifesaver. It worked like clockwork, got ahold of Chad at base camp and i was shocked at how fast Greg was in the air from Nakina Air arriving to take us all in. We basically packed up the whole camp,pulled boats up,etc as if it was the final day and did it all in abt 45min. My father who is one tough dude,was not looking too good and we really figured something was not good internally, so there was alot of anxiety to get him back to base and into Geraldton. Nakina Air and TLO are unbeleivable to deal with. The speed that they showed,safety,etc was impressive. We were back at base camp,my brother and I took our father into Geraldton, about 20-30min drive, maybe less on tht day into their hospital. TLO had already called emerg ahead and they expected him. I had no clue what to expect in a small town but I can say i will never forget how amazingly efficient emerg was in dealing with and treating my dad. Couple broken ribs,concussion, no internal bleeding or punctures, back to TLO base camp, loaded up and headed home. This is long winded and i apologize for that, BUT, we are very lucky. Lucky because he wasnt seriously injured but lucky because many yrs ago we found an incredible outfitter that we will forever be loyal to who uses a service, Nakina Air that is in my opinion #1. Having a SAT phone has become the norm and its a must! My brother and I and all the guys in our group would be remiss if we didnt extend, which we did many times over but its not enough, our gratitude to 2 amazing operations. When things go bad, and they will if you travel enough, its in those moments you find out what kind of outfitter you have..TLO is top notch!!! THANKS Chad.and Greg...cant wait to return Jun16', camp 3..and yes my dad is coming back!!"
3897241,BuckeyeBill,2015-05-22 18:47:00,76,Thanks for sharing your story. It should remind all of us how quick things can go bad. So glad your dad is ok and headed back for another trip. Do they have a camp on Kayedon Lake. Years ago we went on a trip to this lake with Twin Lakes outfitters (I think). It was run by an older gentleman at the time.

3897409,gmattbruin,2015-05-22 19:25:00,174,"BuckeyeBill,I would think that you are referring to when a couple, Bill and Michele Ferring ran TLO. Awesome people! Now it's run by another great guy Chad, from Wisconsin. As you can tell from my long winded post above, I have nothin but good things to say about him as well. Kayeden is a lake I haven't fished, but I think you maybe right in that TLO had a camp or 2, but I'm not 100% on that."
3897481,rnnonmt,2015-05-22 19:44:00,992,For sure an good ending to something that could have went the other direction. Thanks for sharing and it should help keep fresh in our mind how quickly things can turn. A few years ago my older son (12 yrs old at the time) tends to sleep walk if he gets too hot. We were with a large group of family and friends staying at a camp when I was woke up by my father-in-law saying that my son had fell off the stairs of the RV at 1:00am sleep walking. Talk about a wake up call. We were able to get him to the hospital at Sioux Lookout within about 25 minutes to be evaluated. By sunrise we were back at camp with my son in a cast for a fractured radius and ulna. It could have been much worse. Thank the Lord we were not on our usual houseboat trip miles from no where when this occurred.
