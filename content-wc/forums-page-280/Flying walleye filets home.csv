3895977,canyon,2015-05-22 09:44:00,37,Airline worker here. Dry ice has to be declared whether in your checked or carry on bag. You likely won't exceed the max amount in a checked bag but for a lot of airlines most only allow carry on of 5 lbs max. It is considered a dangerous good as it consumes o2.
3896305,KoolBlue,2015-05-22 11:58:00,23,"Yep, definitely have to declare it. Plenty say they never declared it before but that doesn't mean that's the rule. Below is Southwest's policy right from their site. Southwest does not accept styrofoam coolers. All perishable items are accepted at the customer's own risk. The perishables must be completely frozen and packed in a hard, durable ice chest. Preferable refrigerant would be a frozen gel pack(s) placed inside the plastic bag with the frozen perishable item(s). A small amount of ice is acceptable when packed in a separate, leakproof bag inside the ice chest. Loose ice is not permitted. Dry ice is acceptable in quantities under 5 pounds, provided it is shipped in a package vented to release the carbon dioxide gasses to prevent a build up of pressure. The outside of the container must be marked ""DRY ICE"" or ""CARBON DIOXIDE SOLID"" and display the net weight of the dry ice."
3896321,octanehi5,2015-05-22 12:09:00,1104,You could ship them to me frozen fed-x over night and you can have whats left after my fishfry
3896625,Bill Krejca,2015-05-22 13:45:00,6107,"A few years ago, my late father packed his plastic bagged Florida caught frozen grouper in his suitcase, wrapped in clothes as the insulation, and flew back to Cedar Rapids Iowa. Arriving home, he unpacked the still frozen fish and put them in his freezer. He said they tasted great each time he had them. Bill"
3896689,Tonyo,2015-05-22 14:10:00,212,"Thanks for all the great ideas. I'll make sure we have a cardboard box, duct tape, frozen fish in cube form and some dry ice. Should make the long day of travel from Red Lake to Kansas City to Lake Ozark, MO."
3897193,FrankLeigh,2015-05-22 18:25:00,80,"Just check with the airline before you show up with dry ice. Some allow it. Some don't (WestJet for one). I was denied by WestJet, returning from B.C. a couple of years ago with 2 salmon. No dry ice, no water ice. Only the frozen fish wrapped in bubble wrap in a cardboard container.Some will not allow it in checked baggage if there is a connecting flight (Air Canada).There is also some disagreement between the TSA and the FAA. (TSA website)Good luckFrank"
3894233,Tonyo,2015-05-21 19:32:00,212,I'm sure someone has tried this already so I thought I would ask. My brother and my dad will be traveling via commercial airline to Red Lake and home again. My dad is pretty convinced he wants to bring a few walleye home. I would love to be able to throw his in with mine and bring them home but I know that would be a problem. We have considered packing the filets in a small cooler with dry ice and carrying them onto the plane. Has anyone tried this or does anyone have any suggestions for our group to get the 2 guys flying their fish home. TonyO
3894305,wmd,2015-05-21 19:50:00,388,I believe dry ice is considered a Hazardous material and not allowed on an airplane. wmd
3894361,Pikeslayer8,2015-05-21 20:04:00,1460,I know that my dad used to bring fish back to Arizona as recently as 6 years ago. At that time you would declare the dry ice and they would put a fancy sticker on the cooler. No big deal.
3894801,Jesse-WI,2015-05-22 00:00:00,534,call the airlines(s) they will use to get exact details but it is definitely doable.
3895017,Tonyo,2015-05-22 05:32:00,212,I'll give the airline a call or just have them ask when they are at the airport. TonyO
3895073,pjshorthorn,2015-05-22 05:44:00,5654,"This may not possible due to the need for identifying the fish during an inspection by the MNR prior to entering the US ,but I would freeze them in water ( ziploc bag), wrap the frozen fish in newspaper and then pack them in a cardboard box with newspaper stuffed all around them tightly. Closed up the box and made a duct tape handle to carry the box on the plane. Total travel time door to door would average around 8 hours. Never had one spot of moisture on the newspaper from melting. One difference is that I would spend the night at a family member's home the night before flying back to my place so I had time to freeze the fillets and pack them up as described. It works and is less hassle than dry ice. PjShorthorn"
3895145,hdefjunkie,2015-05-22 05:58:00,10,"I've been doing this for years, although not crossing any borders (CDA only). Buy a soft, foldable zipper cooler, freeze the fillets in water and zip lock bags, making sure they're completely submerged in water. Get a block of dry ice and stuff it well, fill any gaps with newspaper. Longest travel time was 6-7hrs, things still frozen solid. Never had a problem checking in at airport security, just tell them it frozen fish packed in dry ice. If they need to open it, they can open the zipper."
3895273,v-bay gord,2015-05-22 06:40:00,3168,"I've flown frozen fish from Mexico as a carry-on (small soft sided cooler bag).....no dry ice was needed, but I would fill the excess space with something frozen (water bottles perhaps)."
3895377,KoolBlue,2015-05-22 07:00:00,23,"Dry ice is allowed on planes but they have a weight restriction for the amount you can use. When you check your baggage they'll ask you to remove the ice and they'll weigh it. I just put mine in a cardboard box with layers of newspaper and dry ice. I put extra duct tape in the box, weighed the ice and taped it back up and checked it. Worked like a charm and didn't have to worry about it one bit. Grabbed it off the conveyor belt when I got home and off I went."
3895433,Larry S,2015-05-22 07:18:00,665,When I fly from Las Vegas to Minneapolis I always bring steaks and elk for our fly-in trip I pack them in a soft cooler with dry ice and have never been checked for the weight of the dry ice. Most of the time the cooler goes thru the TSA checkpoint without a hitch. I can remember only one time when I was asked what was in the cooler. So you can pack up walleye fillets and bring them home via air travel
