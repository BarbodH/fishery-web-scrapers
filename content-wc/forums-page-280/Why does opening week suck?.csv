Fished in just about everything that week, 1 of the nicer days we fished was in 3-4 fter's Oh yeah, bad weather does matter sometimes, but usually more so for affecting the fisherman not the fish. I certainly wouldn't fish in a thunderstorm and extremely high winds will drive me off of a lake. Last year was the first time or group ever lost a whole day fishing. Cold, hard rain and 40mph winds kept us cooped up all day in the cabin. The day before was similar but we decided to head down the lake and up the river figuring it wouldn't be as rough in the river. Fishing was good in the river but conditions deteriorated during the day and I have to admit the five mile ride back to the cabin was the scariest boat ride I've ever had in my life. 40mph winds and sideways rain with 4-5ft waves are no fun in a 14ft boat and 10hp motor. Needless to say we didn't fish the rest of that day or all of the next day. Too busy cleaning my pants if you know what I mean."
3882857,fishman10,2015-05-18 15:40:00,226,"Reporting live from Thunder Bay. Terrible end to the weekend. I can see why I haven't been out for years now. Day trips when it's nice out, like Saturday. Sunday Monday windy cold, raining all day Monday , I'm sure maybe snow further north. Just not nice to fish in."
3883065,Skywagon,2015-05-18 16:34:00,1106,"3 inches of rain yesterday/last night at our place (east Dryden area), snow flurries all day today, plus wind. The water has a muddy-yellow cast, great days to sit by the fire and think about summer."
3884641,prov1800,2015-05-19 05:40:00,5010,Fished cliff last weekend for lakers and bass.did real good.caught some trolling and then we jigged some also.jigged one spot and caught bass in around 40 ft and therecwere walleye at that depth to.stopped fishing thats to deep to bring them up.took a guest out on cedar this weekend and did very good there.great weather but the rest of the weekend turned real ugly.but thats what happens this time of the year.should bring water levels up some.ill be out on cliff next weekend myself.ill be out there wednesday prefishing for walleye to see where their hiding.weather is perking up today.good luck.
3878169,v-bay gord,2015-05-17 09:45:00,3168,"I agree.....and on reflection my thread title should have been ""why does opening week weather suck?""....and more for the impending snow storm than your usual spring weather. Opening week is fresh, and the feel is totally different than later in the season.....only comparable with late fall."

3878217,billy weaver,2015-05-17 10:13:00,470,"Sunday low 25 Monday high 35 F. I tried the first week a few years back, it was nice, highs in the 60's low in the high 30's. It was great, do it again, 10"" of snow on the ground and highs in the 30s. The fishing was great but I am not tough enough. Being in my 70's my hands got so cold they would not work. I had so many clothes on that all the life jackets in the world would not keep me afloat if I fell overboard. I envy you guys who can do it. I have been going the fifth week for many years but still get the urge to go the first week after reading all the posts about great fishing."

We'll be there next weekend, please inform OPP,I promise to be good !! lol"

3879057,Rich B,2015-05-17 16:34:00,1081,"Got my twin brother and 2 good friends fishing up on Cedar Lake this week for the Opener, and I was scheduled to go as well, though a local family member is very ill so I did not head north. Just looked at the dock cam at Manotak Lodge and the dock flags are straight out pointed south, and all the boats are in.....so I checked out the weather and here's the report for V-Bay: Feels Like 31° Visibility 9mi Humidity 93% UV Index 0 (Low) Tonight - Rain showers early will evolve into a more steady rain overnight. Low 32 °F (0.0 °C). Winds NE at 15 to 25 mph (24.1 to 40.2 kph). Chance of rain 90%. Rainfall around a half an inch. Tomorrow - Snow during the morning will transition to snow showers during the afternoon. High 34 °F (1.1 °C). Winds NNE at 10 to 20 mph (16.1 to 32.2 kph). Chance of snow 90%. Snow accumulating 1 to 3 inches. That said, still wishing I was up in a cabin with a fireplace going, and playing cards with family and friends, though I am where I need to be....just cut the lawn and it's 80 in Dover, Ohio.....after tomorrow's snow storm, the rest of the week looks great....will give a lot of folks something to talk about the rest of the year when they talk about fishing through the snow storms of this year's Opener. Faith, Family, Friends....and Fishing.... Rich B"

3876961,v-bay gord,2015-05-16 19:33:00,3168,"What is with opening week? I'm thinking I should open in June! Alerts for: Dryden - Ignace Statements 7:26 PM EDT Saturday 16 May 2015 Special weather statement in effect for: Dryden - Vermilion Bay Ignace - English River Significant rainfall for Sunday followed by a brief return to winter like conditions Monday. Total rainfall amounts ranging from 20 to 40 millimetres likely by Sunday night, with a few locally higher rainfall totals in thunderstorms. A strengthening Colorado low, laden with moisture is expected to spread rain into Northwestern Ontario beginning tonight and then continuing on Sunday. As the low pressure centre tracks to the south of the region later this weekend, brisk northeasterly winds will start to pull in considerably colder Arctic air beginning later on Sunday. Temperatures will fall to very close to the freezing mark by Sunday evening beginning in the Red Lake area. Hence there is potential for rain to change over to freezing rain and ice pellets as the cold air continues to move in Sunday night. As the cold air continues to feed in from the north into Monday, rain may change through freezing rain and ice pellets to some snow in remaining regions, giving quite the taste of winter for the Victoria day holiday. Travelling conditions will likely deteriorate in areas that receive freezing rain, ice pellets and snow. Environment Canada is closely monitoring this situation. Warnings may be issued later this weekend as required."

3877041,Draco1206,2015-05-16 20:07:00,175,"Why does opening week suck? Because I'm not in Canada fishing opening week. Wouldn't matter to me rain, sleet, snow. Been there done that. Not going until late June this year but I prefer early season."
3877097,JayM5209,2015-05-16 20:19:00,1050,Ssssssssh! I planned it that way Gord. The rain and Arctic air are necessary to keep the lakers topside until I can hit Cliff Lake a week from Sunday. Don't tell anyone.
3877281,forgop,2015-05-16 22:01:00,880,Don't think I'd ever go that early. No way would I ever want to be worrying about the ice. I do know from 2 years ago the 2nd week in Sept can get pretty rough. Last day on the water was in the mid-30's and pouring down rain. I joked that there were seals sitting on a great big rock in the middle of a lake.
3877425,Obabikon,2015-05-17 05:09:00,2370,"Weather was tough... but man, yesterday's fishing was a ton of fun! Had our walleye limits in about 45 minutes (all 16-18"" fish)... caught 5 small mouth 19-20""... caught 5 crappie, tons of northern, and had 4 muskies follow up to the boat. The weather isn't going to cooperate, but the fish do!"
3877593,v-bay gord,2015-05-17 07:00:00,3168,You're right Jay! Was sunny and warm yesterday.....went out trolling for 5 minutes and caught a ten pound trout. The good news is the rest of the week looks outstanding!
3877857,mms3rd,2015-05-17 08:12:00,148,"We consider cold rain and windy to be walleye weather. A few years ago, when we stayed in Osborne Bay the second week of June we had four days in a row that did not get above 44 and it rained/sleeted pretty much all day long. I also had the worse virus of my life....but we fished!"

I feel ""renewed"", GLAD to be alive, and when I'm drinking my morning coffee and looking out on the lake, it doesn' get any better than that!! OH, no bugs either.. Stop and smell the coffee, take a look around you, it's great to be alive......."
