3888369,jimirjr,2015-05-20 07:22:00,1149,"Yep, And I thank You SO much !! (and Pat, also) But I was curious as to what might have been something new.... So....My Group will be there the second week of July....AND, with all the flooding in DENVER, I can't ""feed the need"" locally right now...It's gonna be a LONG 7 weeks waiting....ALTHOUGH, I have a week in WYO. coming up the first week of JUNE...IF.... They are not flooded out, also...."

I am sort of a map nut, and I found this while surfing Ontario.http://lakeofthewoodsmn.com/map.html LOTW's people probably are aware. It is a large map with most/many lakes in NW Ontario with depths and other markings. It can be set to meters or feet and nautical miles or km. You can also do a satellite overlay to see terrain around the lake. Sometimes you can do a screen shot of these but generally not very good results. Kind of fun."

It's now in my list of favorites. Thanks for posting. I'm a map nut too. I'll bet many people that frequent WC are guilty of that same pleasure. I'm always looking for or at maps and daydreaming of where I'll fish on my next trip."

3884865,mms3rd,2015-05-19 06:37:00,148,I'm not familiar with the app. But I would say yes...the url/address bar shows Navionics app version 2.
3885081,jimirjr,2015-05-19 07:29:00,1149,I CANNOT get either to open ... ??
3885129,rnnonmt,2015-05-19 07:45:00,992,Jimirjr. just go to the navionics web app. try this link http://webapp.navionics.com/?lang=en It is the same as the first post.
3885137,BayOfQuinte,2015-05-19 07:48:00,173,Navionics released a new web API the allows people to simply embed maps on their site. You will see more site starting to use the Navionics webapp. Scott Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
