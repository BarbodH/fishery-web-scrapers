I know that today they began letting water out of the dam and down the river. Is this why the good bite quit? Does this mean that fishing will be poor tomorrow too? Thanks for the help. We could fish one more day, but we are wondering if it is worth it."
543797,Guest,2004-10-15 16:40:00,0,"I wouldn't say the fishing will be poor, but they will be in a different location. Try any back bays you can find."

The creek mouth North of Sugar Island up tight to shore is another I would check, and the off current pockets out near the marsh. Snow huh...Mmmmm-Boy...Oh joy!

543806,Backwater Eddy,2004-10-17 08:14:00,3871,"So how did it go? Reports I am getting show the Draw Down has had little detrimental effect on the fishing overall. If anything it appears to have stimulated a few more bigger fish to bite. The few and the hearty who are venturing out are getting Greenbacks and many of them are on the hefty size. The boat numbers are low yet the catch appears to be on the upswing, so what does that tell a guy? The shallow jigging pattern that was on before the gates were opened still is the best overall producer. If you set of trolling your likely to get poor results. Many test the trolling and find the shallow jigging to be the best bet going. I have seen a lot of new sumo Greenback digital photo's over the past week so that is hard to ignore. If I could be up there this next week I sure would! Ice-up will be sooner then we all think..unfotunately. Yet I and other suspect this will be a ice season to remember on the lower Red. We suspect there are far more large Greenbacks in the system then are presently showing there faces due mostly to the mucky water. Early ice last winter produced a bunch of huge Greenbacks and this season there are most certainly more food in the river and greenbacks in chasing it. Odds are great they will stay in and feed long after the surface crusts over. We plan to hit the ice a couple of times up North this season for sure. I would certainly consider it if that is an option for anyone keen on getting into a big Greenback under the ice. Some time near or soon after out US Thanksgiving Holiday the ice generally gets safe to venture out on up North. A lot will depend on the weather and the flow but that time frame is a window to think about if planing a ice trip on the Lower Red River of the North. The water clarity should be better by then and the Greenbacks should find hunting a bit easier to do? Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""ED on the RED"" ><,sUMo,>"

543810,Guest,2004-10-17 23:00:00,0,Fishing continued to be great. Caught my personal best of 13.8. Overall we boated 11 fish over pounds from monday-saturday. Many eaters and some 6-8's as well. Best year I have ever had in the 4 years I have been coming. If I knew how to post a pic with message I would.

You can go to the main page and send the pic into Scott here at WC.com as an entry in the #10 Club. Here is the link.https://www.walleyecentral.com/ten_po...ub/index.shtml Sounds like you have a few of them on this trip that would qualify Eh? Did you spend a lot of time on the Miracle mile area, or points farther to the North? What worked best Jigs, Rigs, or did you get them to go for cranks?
