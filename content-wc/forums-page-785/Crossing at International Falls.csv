543788,Drift Sock,2004-10-15 12:43:00,302,My group is going up to Lake of the Woods next week. We can cross the border at International Falls either on Friday or Saturday. On either day our crossing will be at mid morning. If we get there on Saturday at mid-morning will there be a crowd / delay due to it being a weekend? GG
543798,Trailerguy,2004-10-15 16:59:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]Chances are the delay will be on returning to the USA. Every time I went into Canada this summer the line was short to non-existant. The USA side was blocks long. :)

543808,Guest,2004-10-17 12:45:00,0,This time of year it won't be as crowded as it was during the warmer months. The last time I crossed to Canada I waited maybe 3 minutes. Coming back we waited about 15 minutes. Still not as bad as it could have been. If I was you I wouldnt worry to much about it.
