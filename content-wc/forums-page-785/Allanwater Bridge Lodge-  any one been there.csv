543746,Stehle,2004-10-13 05:59:00,95,"I've been going to Allanwater every year for 4 years. The group that I go with has gone for about 20 years. John and Barney had put a lot of effort into fixing up the cabins two to three years ago. Each cabin has a new roof, but the motif is definitely rustic(The cabins were built in the forties or fifties by the Hudson Bay Company). I don't have any base for comparison, but I like it. Last year was the first year after a low water. I expected the fishing to be fantastic, but we had a little trouble getting them. The solunar table was not in our favor, and the bite was real light. We were there two weeks after spawn. Even though the fishing was slow, we still caught 2-3 dozen per day per boat. I've had hundred fish days before, though. We caught several slot or below and a few above 20"". Our groups largest of the week was 26"". I caught a 23"" and about 6 over 20"". My partner caught about the same. From what I've read, fishing was kind of tough all over this year. Barney and John(his son who runs the camp now...I think) are good guys. Their boats are Lund and the motors are Honda four strokes (15HP). Every year is hit or miss on whether you'll get a boat that will idle down enough for bouncer trolling, but the boats always run. If they don't, John will replace your motor or fix it asap. Most of the time, John gets it running inside of 15 minutes. They have 18 boats and that is pretty much all you see on the lake. There are other camps, but I rarely see anyone at them. We fly out of Rusty Myers near Savant Lake. This costs about $175 with the fishing license (15 minute flight). You can also take the railroad, but you generally get in around 2:00 am and they have more weight restrictions."

They stated that the fishing was not up to par compared to previous years and that the high water level was probably the cause. We fished the mouth of the Allanwater River as this was where we got the best bite. Biggest walleye I caught was a 24.5 inch but we had several over the 20 inch mark. Best day I had fishing saw me catch 47 walleyes in a 4 hour period. I went over to Allanwater Lodge to borrow his phone. Must say they are very nice people there. Pleasant and always willing to help. Nice thing about Kawaweogama is the lack of boats. Most I ever saw in one day was 4 and the last week we were there, I saw one other boat the whole week. I will be back out there next July."
