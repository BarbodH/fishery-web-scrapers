I have a 32 inch replica being made by Hawkins (Permatrophy) now and expect to receive it around xmas sometime. Can't wait."
543703,bigfish1965,2004-10-07 17:42:00,3210,Advanced Taxidermy in Toronto does it (I assume since you posted in the Canada forum you are in Canada).
543716,Guest,2004-10-11 08:23:00,0,"A 32"" walleye with 18"" girth is a real big. Anywhere. Red River, Winnipeg River, Gunisao Lake, Columbia River, Tobin Lake, Erie, de Noc, Detroit River, Bay of Quinte, or anywhere. Congratulations on a fine release."
543774,Chad,2004-10-15 07:36:00,3523,"I got mine from Matt and am Very Happy. One suggestion where ever you go, ask them to notch the fins rather than just leave them flat. If you look at a real walleye the tail, pectoral and other fins are never perfect. I forgot to request this and some of my fins are cut smooth from the mold. If you ask they will take a tool and put little notches in the fins. Chad"

543662,Guest,2004-10-06 11:38:00,0,I will get this discussion started: I think Matt Yernatich of Artistic Anglers (800)544-7466 in Duluth MN is hands down the best out their for graphite fish replicas. I believe he has 100's of his own big walleye molds to match any size walleye (lenght and girth).
543669,Guest,2004-10-06 14:03:00,0,"how big was the walleye? and what do you guys consider a ""trophy"" walleye? i have one pike replica and permatrophy did it.... it is a nice replica....."
543674,Guest,2004-10-07 07:03:00,0,"The Walleye is 32"" with an 18"" girth. Didnt get a weight on her but did get her revived and returned to the water."
543675,NEWMARGUY,2004-10-07 07:17:00,34,"Hawkins in Winnipeg, Manitoba has been doing replica mounts for quite a while and a 32"" walleye is a baby on the Red - well mabe not a baby but I have caught a 341/2"" and I am sure they can do it. Thats a nice walleye and its a good idea to return those big reproducing hogs back to make more. Hawkins does good work and i"
543676,Guest,2004-10-07 07:27:00,0,"32"" is not a baby on the Red. It may not be a giant but it is a trophy. I once saw Barney catch a 42"" Walleye on the Red but he returned it and didnt report it because he didnt want to break Robert Schofields record 39 incher."
543681,bigfish1965,2004-10-07 09:02:00,3210,But the Red is fully of skinny-azz walleye...18 inch girths don't even get measured here...it takes 22 or more inch girths to even get noticed...
543682,NEWMARGUY,2004-10-07 09:21:00,34,"blu1fin - I didn't mean to say your fish wasn't a trophy size, 32"" Walleye is nice - plenty nice - I just wanted to let you know that Hawkins is capable of doing a Walleye that size or bigger. I don't know about the large Walleye of the Red being skinny - the all appear to have big guts when the get to the 28"" or larger size. If it was a ""Greenback"" then I would be careful who does the mount because that color is not common. Nice to hear that you released your trophy. Good luck on your next trip."
543689,Guest,2004-10-07 10:15:00,0,Matt in Duluth is the best. He does several replicas for Cabelas. #### of a nice guy as well.
543695,skrut,2004-10-07 13:42:00,52,"Finantte in Antig, WI does excellent work. Has done replicas for top guides in WI. Advertisements in Musky Hunter Mag. and other fishing publications."
