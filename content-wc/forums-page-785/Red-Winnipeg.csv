Only twice in my whole life have I had to pull over. You get the feeling the border guard wants to go along. Pretty soon you realize you are actually in Canada. The roads are made different, things are in French, and you wonder how much faster you can go than the 100 km sign without getting pulled over.

Too many boats, maybe we'll fish the snowmobile sign side. Ah heck, there's room and boats are on both sides. You idle down when you hit the drop off and come up to about 11'. You hand out linecounter rods with lures on them. Maybe a 8 pearl shad rap with some blue dots, a fire tiger 9 and a blue/red Jr Thunderstick. Put some juice on lures and send them out until they tick bottom. Remind the guys to check their drags, leave them a little loose and put on the clickers. It feels good to have the kicker going, everything is working and you're on top of the world. You wonder how many guys out here fishing you know or have seen the past ten years.

You extend the net and make sure the boat is pointed away from everyone. The other rods are up and you put it in neutral. Suddenly you hear, ""Ohhhhh man, back out to 27"". Now you KNOW, this is a greenback and she just realized what happened. She comes up to 5' and you still can't see her but you all know it's the one.

You're going to release her right? Good man. Ok, let's get a few quick pics and video."" The other boats know now and they redouble their efforts, some make a trolling pass coming way to close. Others talk about it on the radio. Some are thinking big deal, ""been there done that"". Your buddy leans over the side of the boat with the fish in his hands. You can see on the video later how the big girl realized she was free and swam off, splashing everyone in the process. You ask your buddy how he feels and he can't even talk, just shakes his head and says, ""Wow, that was awesome. She was so big. Everyone else is teasing about the rod position he used, how she ran a few times, how you were worried about the net job.""

Decisions Decisions. A few more times out. Hopefully lots of fish, maybe everyone gets a trophy, maybe they don't. You see the nets and get a little steamed but it's not your water or your country.

It's the only time you don't read newspapers all year long. You wonder if any of these geese will be in your field over you decoys later this year. Will the nets ever get under control?

I won't be able to fish these systems but I do enjoy reading about the successes and not so great days on the water at these two excellent fisheries. Thanks in advance. :)"
543863,Backwater Eddy,2004-10-19 16:02:00,3871,"Reports I am getting show the Draw Down on the Red has had little detrimental effect on the fishing overall. If anything, it appears to have stimulated a few more bigger fish to into a bite. The few and the hearty who are venturing out are getting Greenbacks and many of them are on the hefty size. The boat numbers are low, yet the catch appears to be on the upswing. So what does that tell a guy? The shallow jigging pattern that was on before the gates were opened still is the best overall producer. If you set of trolling your likely to get poor results. Many test the trolling and find the shallow jigging to be the best bet going. But some still are doing ""OK"" ultra-slow trolling minnow bait style cranks on leadcore. I have seen a lot of new sumo Greenback digital photo's over the past week so that is very hard to ignore. If I could be up there all this next week I sure would! Ice-up will be sooner then we all think..unfotunately. Yet I and other suspect this will be an ice season to remember on the lower Red. We suspect there are far more large Greenbacks in the system then are presently showing there faces, due mostly to the murky water. Early ice last winter produced a bunch of huge Greenbacks and this season there are most certainly more food in the river and greenbacks in chasing it. Odds are great they will stay in and feed long after the surface crusts over. We plan to hit the ice a couple of times up North this season for sure. I would certainly consider it if that is an option for anyone keen on getting into a big Greenback under the ice. Some time near or soon after our US Thanksgiving Holiday the ice generally gets safe to venture out on up North. A lot will depend on the weather and the flow but that time frame is a window to think about if planing a ice trip on the Lower Red River of the North. The water clarity should be better by then and the Greenbacks should find hunting a bit easier to do? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ As of this afternoon we are planing to go North Friday and fish the Red this weekend. With the nice weather forecast it should be some interesting fishing, wish us luck.

543683,Backwater Eddy,2004-10-07 09:30:00,3871,"It may vary some too, it can be latter depending on what they decide there at the Lockport Dam. Weather and river levels may alter their plans either way? As a rule it is in mid October. I had miss-spoke earlier on another post by stating they may pop it in mid September...I jumped the gun there. I am not so certain if they do it will be completely detrimental to the fishing? Given a few days to clear I suspect there will be even more walleye drawn into the system by the influx of chow? Time will tell there I guess too?

I am going with a buddy on 21st of October again where we will fish really hard. Fishing was below standards there but above the last two years in my opinion.

If your headed North, the good word is 6', or less, with jigs and Salties. The farther North on the Red...the better, like past where the parking gets kinda sparse. Some 32"" sumo's caught out that way the past few days. ;) I may be headed that way again the weekend of the 24th with Big Shanon (He still needs that 14+). They will most likely blow the gates on the dam on the 14th or the 15th so....I kinda figure it may be stirred up tell at least then? When they blow them gates I am betting them sumo's will be pushed back into ""the corners""? Lots of sumo chow out there in duck country this year. Ya know..I bet the bite is on just down the road from you about now too? May just see me soon in those parts? I'll be sure to drop by for coffee if I am in the area snooping for sumo's. Ed"

I thought of your story and no doubt these fellows were going through the same experience you described. I told one fellow "" Is that your rig out front"" of course I knew it was (Iowa Plate - Lund Tyee and tow vehicle). He said yes and I told him he had a flat tire - His expression was priceless and even better when I told him I was ****ting him. Anyway I passed some info on the fishing on the river and wished the group luck - I was also heading out that am. Anyway the fishing is fair to good. Five times out this year and limits each time - one 30plus inch returned. The weather has been cold and windy but the weather promises to improve over the next few days. If you come up be prepared for anything - we had snow flurries on Sunday and forecast is for 70 plus F tomorrow. The greenbacks are here and with a little work a fellow has a good chance to nab a big hog. If you come up think about releasing any hogs - they are not good eating and a picture can get you a good replica mount if you so choose. I live here in Lockport and really enjoy meeting fellow American fishermen every fall during the Greenback run. Good Luck"

Heard that last weekend was extremely tough with high current and high waves from gale winds. Not much fishing done on the bay. Because of the conditions, there wasn't much that could be determined from the fishing. Water has been really muddy too. Maybe by now water clarity has settled some and rain has been holding off. Maybe we'll see ya... Mike"
543664,Todd_NE,2004-10-06 12:26:00,1330,"Mike, I don't have any set plans right now.

If that one goes well I can probably go on up but I don't have anything set up - want a rider!! I'm trying to work it out with Black Dog right now but he lives up in Northern Minnesota.

543665,NEWMARGUY,2004-10-06 12:33:00,34,Remember fellows - the dam is scheduled to start opening Oct. 15 - this results in more current - more dirty water and tougher fishing - usually. I fish until freeze up but I prefer conditions prior to the dam 's opening.

Money doesn't come first, but this time too much is riding on some things for me to take off. Never thought I'd be that important !!! lol Todd Oh yeah... I stuck her good... Feel that head shake..."

I'll be going on Thursday and all I can say is I hope it goes as described. Could use a few big greenbacks this year as it has been sketchy for a few. Good luck and hope you find a way up this year!"
