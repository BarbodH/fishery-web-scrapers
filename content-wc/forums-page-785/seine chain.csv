543548,BD,2004-10-01 04:36:00,739,What kink of info are you looking for? I have fished there a few times and I have some fishing buddies (retired so they go fishing all the time) who have fished there at least twice a year for decades. Years ago we camped on an island but us old folks just can't take that anymore. For the last ? years we have stayed at www.finlaysonresort.com and use various launches to fish the river and lakes in the area.
