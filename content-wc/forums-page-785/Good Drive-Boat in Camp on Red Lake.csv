543125,Guest,2004-09-01 14:17:00,0,Does anyone know of a good drive in or boat in resort on Red Lake?
543128,Guest,2004-09-01 19:13:00,0,I don't know of one on Red Lake but there is a nice one on Wine Lake which is just off of Wabaskang Lake.
543131,Guest,2004-09-02 05:37:00,0,Take a look at www.fivelakeslodge.com on the Gullrock which connects to Red Lake. Jeff
543132,Guest,2004-09-02 07:22:00,0,"I have to say that Bow Narrows Camp is a great place. It's a boat in camp on the west end of Red Lake. The owners are great, cabins very good, and food was wonderfull. I have taken my wife there a few times and she really likes the place too. They have a web site www.bownarrows.com. I would go back there anytime and would recommend it to anyone. JohnL."

543183,Guest,2004-09-06 15:24:00,0,"What does the camp provide for family entertainment. Just curious, wife and daughter don't like to fish."
543225,Guest,2004-09-08 20:11:00,0,"You can swim, weather permitting. The new owners have a couple of kayaks that they will lend out. Last couple days we were there they got a tube and knee board out to take some kids out for fun. They have a horseshoe pit. They pay a membership at the golf course for guests to use. There are a couple beaches in Red Lake plus an indoor pool in Balmertown and a little shopping in town. Depending on the time of year you go they can tell you how to get to a blueberry patch which I love more than the fishing. We have taken two kids with us for the last ten years- NEVER taken a TV or video game, have even increased our time to two weeks and never heard ""I'm bored!"". It's a good time for card and board games. Take some crafty stuff or a model to work on. Red Lake IS NOT the entertainment capital of the world but I doubt you'll have any complaints."
