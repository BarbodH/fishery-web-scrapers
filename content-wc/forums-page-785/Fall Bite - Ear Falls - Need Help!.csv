The question I have (pertaining to the Ear Falls area of Lac Seul) When does the later season bite start up? we'd like to head up mid late August. Is this to early? What could we expect during that time period???"
543735,Guest,2004-10-12 05:23:00,0,We have been going to the ear falls area for the past 8 years in mid August. We have never had a problem catching fish and the weather is usually better. The other up side is that in August there are a lot fewer bugs to fight. We've seen the weather run from 100 to highs in the 50's but fishing is great that time of year.

543818,Guest,2004-10-18 14:05:00,0,"I have fished on Lac Seul a little south, in McKenzie Bay area in August. We had 100+ fish days just about every day. We have not had as much luck in the huge walleyes, but we have caught quite a few in the 23 to 26 inch range. I think the big girls in the 30's are deep, or spread out more, but if I do get a 30 incher, she is definately going in the frying pan!!!!!! We usually drift bottom bouncers in 18 - 30 feet of water over humps. We have never caught much deeper than that. A guide the first day is worth the money. I will always get a guide the first day just to find out what the trends are that year. This year the weather was record colds throughout August. Last year we fished in shorts and T-Shirts the whole week, and even went swimming a few times. You never know what you are going to get, but it is definately better weather that June. The bugs are almost non-existant during the day in August. After dark though, you will be losing some blood if you are on shore."

543848,Guest,2004-10-19 04:51:00,0,Hey bor if we're there at the same time and I catch a 30 incher we can cook them together and we'll have 5 feet of fish to eat.
543849,Guest,2004-10-19 07:53:00,0,"Um...I thought that was pretty obvious that it was a joke. I eat small ones for shore lunch 3-4 times a week. My wife does not eat fish that much so bringing home fish really is not a big deal to me. I brought home two this year. One was 24 inches, but I tore up its gill and it was bleeding bad from the trebles of a Rapala 18 so putting it back was not an option. Fishing all day, drinking beer, playing poker and having bad gas that clears out the cabin is what makes a good trip."
