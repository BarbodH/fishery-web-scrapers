543707,tlars,2004-10-08 09:33:00,137,We're thinking about going to South Shore Lodge on Eagle Lake next June. Does anyone have any comments about the Lodge or that part of the lake?

For summer, tons of hot spots, Detour Point area, Viking, Coke Bottle, Three Sisters, all good places. Hope this helps. I'm not giving any secrets away, all are known fall walleye hangouts."

Most of our walleye fishing was done in Blind Bay. Got a little boring after a while having to fish the same area to catch fish. The lodge is scenic and in a nice location. The lodge owners were cordial."
