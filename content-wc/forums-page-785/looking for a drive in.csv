543828,Guest,2004-10-16 20:04:00,0,"I have to disagree with NW Fishing Bum. Sounds like Kashabowie Lake is being given a bad rap. There are only 3 resorts on the lake. Busy time is weekends with local campers. Otherwise very quiet, low traffic. Fishing for walleye, well sometimes you have to work for them, but who doesn't. Being compared to Southern Ontario.... get real."

Decent walleye lake (and good sized river feeding the lake) along with 4 - 5 lb Smallmouth bass and decent pike fishing (my son caught an 18 lb pike, as well as walleyes up to the 6 - 8 lb range). Cabins are very nice - website doesn't do the camp justice. Owners are great people. Rich B"

543846,Guest,2004-10-18 18:46:00,0,"Actually I thought NWO fishing bum had a point. He's right. Anything within an easy day trip of Thunder Bay sees pressure. I speak from experience as I suspect he does as well. Yes, maybe comparing the lake to one in southern Ont. is a stretch, but not by much. As he stated there's much better fisheries available if you're willing to drive a bit further."
543442,Guest,2004-09-24 07:26:00,0,"If you are are driving 13 hours, then go about two more and go to Lac Seul...Most places are more than $300, but the extra money is well worth it. I have fished more in the central area and Fisherman's Cove and Lac Seul Lodge are great places but will cost you about $500 per person for housekeeping. You will have 100 fish days all summer there. Get a guide the first day and have a great week of big walleyes. If money is really a problem, I have not stayed at, but have driven past Timberlane Lodge on Lac Seul. You are still on Lac Seul, but up near Ear Falls. The cost is closer to $350 per person. Here is the website...http://www.fishtimberlane.com/index.html. If you are going to canada,and want to catch big walleye, Lac Seul is incredible. PS. Do not waste your money buying tackle for the trip...stop at the bait shop in Ear Falls (four seasons Bait and tackle) and buy Klass Spinner rigs and lead weights with swivels for only about $1.25 Canadian each. You will catch 90% of your fish on spinners, and the other 10% with white or chartruse or orange 3/8 ounce jigs. I was always a jig fisherman but do better on Lac seul drifting spinners. I bring a HUGE tackle box full of stuff and use only a few things to throw for pike."

Check our web site http://www.agatebaylodge.com We are a small quiet fishing camp in your price range. All the best, Greg B."
543500,BD,2004-09-28 16:44:00,739,www.presslake.on.ca Farther than you want but great fishing for eyes and northerns at a nice camp. This years rate was $185 each (includes launching and docking) with a minimum of four in a housekeeping cabin. Just checked. The 2005 rate is $215 for each adult and $185 for each child.
543501,Guest,2004-09-28 17:53:00,0,"bd, that's one of those a la carte rate sheets. they need a boat and motor and gas and presumably bait. that quickly gets you into the $450 per week per guy range."
543529,Guest,2004-09-29 20:45:00,0,I know a little about this. I've been to about 400 different camps. The guys are right 300 for the week is a little light. 450 is on the low end.

543609,Guest,2004-10-02 19:07:00,0,"Phi Delt 157- You should consider Camp Kuha near Thessalon ON. Their website is www.campkuha.com. I have never stayed at the lodge, but several of my friends have. I believe the entire camp was built in 2000 by a retired orthopaedic surgeon from Toronto. Tunnel lake is not a fishery like Lac Seul, but you can catch good size walleyes. Cabin and boat is approx. $350.00 per person per week with 4 persons per cabin. Good Luck! Indiana Alpha #1862"

543395,phidelt157,2004-09-20 12:16:00,191,"We are looking for a drive in lake, approx. 13 hours from Indianapolis. We'd like to spend about $300 or so per man (4) and have showers in the cabins, not too many people, etc. Any suggestions? Thanks BB"
543397,Todd_NE,2004-09-20 13:02:00,1330,"Sounds like Lac Seul or Lake of the Woods to me (Morson, Nestor Falls, Sioux Narrows) Todd Doh!"
543401,Guest,2004-09-20 15:08:00,0,"try around Wawa just north of the sault. its a little further than 12 hours. I live at the michigan indiana line and it takes me 7.5 hours to the bridge at the sault and then two more to wawa. You will find a lot of drive in camps in that area and in your price range. if you google ""Wawa ontario"" you will get a city owned website which will allow you to find about 10 or so in the area for a start. if you would drive a bit further you could go where I fish, happy day lodge, near chapleau (www.happydaylodge.com) there are a number of other drive-in lodges in that area/price range near chapleau as well (five mile lake, pauquettes and moosehorn come to mind). in fact the drive from wawa to chapleau is about two hours and there are drive-in camps all along the route."
543405,Gary_IA,2004-09-21 13:08:00,144,"I noticed a resort in the price range you request on Lac des Mille Lacs, a large lake northeast of the Quetico. The link is: http://www.duenorth.net/thunderbirdresort/location.html (I have never been to this resort or lake.) The premier Walleye Lake is generally considered to be Lac Seul. Although prices are reasonable, they are higher than the $300 per person. I'd day about $450 per week per person, per week including boat and motor and maybe some gas. Evergreen Lodge, plus a host of others are near Ear Falls, Ontario and Sioux Looklout. These resorts are a lot longer drive from Indianapolis than Lac des Mille Lacs The Morson area on Lake of the Woods has some reasonably priced accomodations. Check out Mylie's place and Buena Vista Resort and Rex Tolton's Miles Bay Camp-a boat in with outside toilets and central showers but quite reasonable in price."
543410,Guest,2004-09-21 22:03:00,0,"13 hours will get you across the border at international falls, mn. good fishing 2 to 4 hour north of there. $300 is a little light. like gary said, 450-500 is on the low end. you could go up thru michigan, but that side of ontario gets tons of fishing pressure. my advice would be to drive another 2-4 hours, cough up another 200 bucks and have a really great fishing trip. if not, go to eastern ontario and catch bluegills, bass and bullheads. the key is to get way north and away from those major metropolitan areas--detroit, toronto, etc."
543413,Guest,2004-09-22 10:15:00,0,"Is that $300/day? That is about the going rate for a top-quality Canadian fishing experience on a full American plan at top-end lodges. Obviously, most places are cheaper, but you get less for it. How many days??"
543415,phidelt157,2004-09-22 11:46:00,191,"looking for a week - We're not interested in the full lodge - all you can eat american plan. We just need a cabin (shower) boats, and walleye. Nothing fancy. We'd like to keep it $300-$400 per man. Anyone have any thoughts on Lake Kashabowie? Thanks, BB"
543417,Guest,2004-09-22 15:08:00,0,"You may have trouble in the ""Walleye"" department if you're serious about Kashabowie. Shebandowan, Kashabowie, and to a lesser extent Lac Des Mille Lacs are the most heavily pressured inland lakes by the Thunder Bay fishing community. Among other reasons, these lakes are a reasonable single-day fishing trip out of T-Bay. I've fished Kashabowie, but it's honestly like fishing for walleye in cottage country Southern Ontario. Do not drive 13 hours to fish Kashabowie! Driving 15 hours to anywhere further north will get you into far more fish. In case you haven't figured it out from the high volume of discussion it receives on this forum (although I'm certainly not excited by increased boat traffic), Lac Seul is the best walleye fishery up here (16-17 hours). There are perhaps a few places down NEAR your price range, especially if you're willing to go early/late season. The weather can, and often is, punishing at that time of year, but you may get lucky (this past weekend was georgious by September standards on L.S.). The bottom line is if you're going to drive that far, go a little further and pay a little more for a much more positive fishing experience. I'm sure most experienced Canadian fishing travellers would tell you the same!"
543423,phidelt157,2004-09-23 06:11:00,191,"We don't mind driving a little further for better fishing, what do you suggest? We don't really mind spending an extra $100 or so either. Not sure if we want to get on a huge body of water lake LS......maybe something a little more secluded. Ideas? Thanks"
543427,Gary_IA,2004-09-23 09:31:00,144,"I haven't been to Camp Wenasaga nor do I have any connections to either it or Cascade Camp. I have been to Cascade Camp. My brother and family went to Camp Wenasaga when his youngest was 9. She is now sixteen. Anyway the lake is about 10 miles north of Lac Seul. Lake Wenasaga is about 8 miles long and is fed by the Wenasaga River and Wenasaga Lake empties into Lac Seul. I believe the resort offers a 15 hp electric start Johnson outboard on their boats. It is a good Walleye Lake. I think you have to call or email as to rates: www.wenasaga.com Another basic bare bones fishing camp near Fort Frances, Ontario, is Cascade Camp. The resort arranges to have a boat pick up at the government docks and boats you the 30 miles to camp-at the north end of the north arm of Rainy Lake. The best fishing is off the dock for smallmouth. The camp offers servicable 15 hp motors and boats. It is an old camp with mismatched appliances but they work. Indoor hot and cold running water, showers and toilets. No website but try this address and phone (from my 2000 brochure). In 2000 rates were very reasonable, weather was great, and smallmouth bass fishing was outstanding. Cascade Camps, Ltd. P.O.
