543795,Guest,2004-10-15 15:05:00,0,"My two cents on the issue are that the lake I fish at in Canada we follow the MNR regulations and the resort owner has his regulations. This is the only resort on the lake system we fish and we can't keep any walleye over 18"". We have no problem with this because you can catch plenty of 18"" walleye to feed yourself and we have 10 people in our group. The resort owner has a little incentive for any trophy fish caught. He puts your name on a brag board and gives you patches and pins. Plus at the end of the year he will draw one name out of the hat for a free trip back. He also has limits on Pike and Lakers. Every year since he put these limits in effect the size of the fish has increased and it is a wonderful time catching and releasing those 30"" plus walleye. For some people fishing is about getting a lot of meat not the enjoyment of being in a remote beutiful area."

543784,Guest,2004-10-15 11:46:00,0,"Figure the number of fishermen on said lake for the entire year... If everone kept their 4 fish that is how many? How long do you think a fishery can continue to sustain that kind of pressure? Maybe that's why the fishing sucks were you and I live! So in closing, ATTITUDE is the real issue!"
543785,Guest,2004-10-15 11:54:00,0,"Last year we made a trip to a local lake here in Canada for our annual trophy walleye hunt (CPR). Things were slow, but we managed a few. One boat, with a Wisconson crew aboard, hooked into a big fish. The guy fought it for a while, netted it and took some photos. Every boat around him then sat back to see if he would let her go. The angler then revived the fish and away she swam. Applause broke out amongst both the Canadian and WI boats...it was great to see. The angler took a bow and looked like a happy man releasing a big trophy to perhaps grow bigger and one day be caught again. Not all WI guys are meat pigs, and not all Canadian guys saints. Great to see when we're all on the same page though."
543786,Guest,2004-10-15 11:57:00,0,"You keep stating that these fish would probally die anyway? What do you base this assumption on? How many fish do you see out on the lake, dead? In my 10 years up there I can only remember a handful of floaters! Even if you let her go and she lives until the end of the season and 1 more person is able to catch her before she dies... Isn't that person happy as you were when you caught it? You can thank all of us who respect the fishery and practice CPR to give you meat feeders a chance to feast on the hogs!"
543787,Guest,2004-10-15 12:17:00,0,"Based on the number of posts, I would say you are the one ""slamming"" their beliefs down everyone's throat. A very unpopular belief from what I can gather. I doubt this is even a legit post/thread."
543789,Guest,2004-10-15 12:59:00,0,"This discussion has widened dramatically. Of course the guy has ""the right"" to the fish. As I said before, if you're at a camp you obey the MNR rules and the camp rules. If you're up here on your own you obey the MNR rules, though the ethical and ecological arguments (which the other group of people in this discussion are presenting) remain the same. Period!! Now, on to new stuff which has emerged. New to Canada, For what it's worth, I've seen the same 29-30"" fish caught multiple times in the same day on numerous occasions, let alone the even more common occurence of catching the same fish from the same location on different days. We can't always be certain it's the same fish, but through descriptions, measurements, photographs and markings we can often tell. Obviously, this applies to a small portion of fish caught, but it's often enough to be a significant point. In all likelihood, we probably catch many fish multiple times without noticing. If they are aggressively feeding, biting and fighting multiple times a day, I would suspect these fish are far from death! Yes, a 30"" fish probably does have a better chance of dying than a 25"" fish, but so what??? From what I can see on this discussion, the other side of the fence isn't saying ""Keep the 25's, throw back the 30's."" Are they?? Daveinmo, As always, an enlightening view from you. When you say ""there comes a point when hugging trees reaches a limit and most of you guys are way past that"" I assume you are addressing the whole conservation side of this discussion. The real beauty of this is that you're right, you're absolutely right!! MOST of us, now support the ecological argument based on the growing scientific information we have had for the last 30 years, and the numerous examples of collapsed fisheries because of poor management. But, do you know what ""MOST"" means in a democratic society Dave??? THAT'S RIGHT, big boy!!! (Well, actually, most doesn't always prevail in the United States, but they have another chance coming in two weeks here to get it right). Wooglin, THANK YOU very much for admitting that you come all this way for the fun associated with a fishing vacation experience, aside from filling your face with walleye. You were doing so well, and you should have left off there, but then you had to go prognosticate the next 1000 years, and you blew it!! No sooner do we get you straightened out over trying to relate the Canadian fishing vacation experience today to historic fishing for survival with that ""history"" comment, you then go and say things today could last 1000 years. Are you a history teacher or a fortune teller? I'm willing to bet neither. I'm not a history teacher either, but I do know the history of natural resource management issues. I'll use fisheries to ensure I stay somewhat on topic. The East Coast cod fisheries were discovered almost 500 years ago by explorers and it was rumoured around what is now western Europe, there was enough fish to feed the empire for thousands of years. Now, jump way ahead to the 1900's and the commercial fish industry on the east coast starts exploding (being shared by numerous countries). In the 1970's, like with many natural resource exploitation endeavours, science started showing up saying ""oh oh, we are taking way too much, and need to drastically reduce now."" Without going into the details, management alternatives were consistently improperly chosen based on economics and not ecology. And where are we today??? If you don't know, the fishery is closed and will be for some time before we see a noticeable rebound in fish stocks, if we ever do. Wooglin, don't make any comments about the next 1000 years on Lac Seul. For starters, you are probably there only a few days a year!! I'll admit I'm being somewhat picky, but your comments are over the top. I guess that's enough for today . . . gotta curling bonspiel to get to."
543790,Guest,2004-10-15 13:04:00,0,I highly doubt that my 4 fish per day is going to make Lac Seul go belly up.
543791,Guest,2004-10-15 13:44:00,0,It's not about YOUR 4 fish a day . . . read it again!
543792,Guest,2004-10-15 14:00:00,0,I remember many years ago(50 or more) when we went to Minnesota and caught lots of nice Walleye. Those days are gone forever because the state and the Resort Owners didnt pay as much attention as they could have to protecting the resource. We all thought it was great to fill up the stringer break out the old Brownie camera and take pictures of our prizes. At the time we thought it was the right thing to do but as I look back now maybe we all could have had a little concern for how it would effect future fishing. Im not saying that over harvesting of fish or keeping the big fish is entirely at fault for declining fish populations....but it does have an effect. Each of us that fish have our own ideas on what best protects the species and each of us have the right to take every fish the law allows. But after 75 years of fishing and enjoying not only catching fish but being with all the guys I have fished with I would say this. My fishing memories are more about good times and the buddies that I have fished with and the buddies I still fish with than about how many fish I cleaned and ate.
543793,Guest,2004-10-15 14:07:00,0,"nwo bum, thankfully for us, we are not a purely democratic society. and most of us feel that we got it right 4 years ago. hopefully, we will get it right again in a couple of weeks. other than that minor error, i would agree with most of the rest of your post. don't believe i've ever seen so much foreign interest in an american election before. very interesting."
543794,Guest,2004-10-15 14:52:00,0,My only question is why does anybody want to keep a hog? If the only reason is because it has more meat than I am dumbfounded.
543773,Guest,2004-10-15 07:32:00,0,What a bunch of crap. You caught the fish you cleaned the fish and you can take it home. There comes a point when huging trees reaches a limit and most of you guys are way past that
543775,bigfish1965,2004-10-15 07:50:00,3210,Which is why the limits are being reduced yet again...thanks Dave
543776,Guest,2004-10-15 07:53:00,0,"Rumors suck - If rumors were true, Favre would have retired three years ago, Jerry Rice five years ago. Send me proof the limits are being reduced. I see maybe 10 boats a day where we fish when we are out on the lake. I am sure Lac Seul will fish on for the next 1000 years, even if I eat 4 fish per day."
543777,Guest,2004-10-15 08:04:00,0,"My response is: If you enjoyed catching the bigger fish and would like to continue to catch bigger fish than throw them back. If everyone keeps a 29"" to 31"" fish to eat there won't be as many to catch. It's your decision as to which is more important."
543778,Guest,2004-10-15 08:29:00,0,Well bigfish go ahead and tell us all how lac seul will run out of fish and water and air...Geez I bet you yell the sky is falling at least once a day.
543779,Guest,2004-10-15 08:39:00,0,You know I find it very interesting to read both sides of this ongoing discussion. One thing I think needs to be remembered. The folks up in Canada that set the limits know far more about the condition of Lac Seul then we do. If harvesting one fish over 22 inches was a problem then they would stop that practice. Having too many large preditors is just as bad as having too few to breed. Its a fine balancing act. This man was within his right to catch and keep that fish. If conditions change so will the limits. I've always found that people that are quick to tell how you should do anything usually leave a trail of broken ideals behind them.
543780,Guest,2004-10-15 09:06:00,0,Very well said - couldn't have said it better myself. >You know I find it very interesting to read both sides of >this ongoing discussion.

543781,Guest,2004-10-15 09:44:00,0,"My thought at time, and the more I have thought about it, a 30 inch walleye is probably equivalent to an 80+ year old man. Now the stress of bringing in the fish, holding it out of water for the pictures, and the injury to the fish, I really do not believe that there is a large number of 30 fish that live after being caught. I think that they may swim away, but end up dead soon after from the trauma. I would think that a 23-27 incher has a much better chance of living than a 30 incher. You also get four five times the meat from one 30"" than you get from three 18 inchers. I also have heard that big fish do not taste good...that is a myth...they tast just as good. There are about 20 resorts on a lake that is 100 miles long. I would guess that there are millions of large fish in there. Taking a few hogs here and there (many that would have died anyway) would not hurt the population."
543782,Guest,2004-10-15 09:57:00,0,"New to canada, You are most certainly entitile to your opnion but remember this...100% of the fish that go under a fillet knife dont survive while the survival rate on those turned loose is much higher. Put them back and give them a chance."
543783,Guest,2004-10-15 10:07:00,0,"There is nothing wrong with a person who catches a fish, no matter the size (assuming its legal) and keeping it. The same goes for going to the local tavern for a fish fry - EXCEPT those were netted in mass quantities and put under the fillet knife. No matter what you eat, beef, chicken, walleye, perch, elk....they are all killed somehow..... This is ridiculous - let the guy keep AND EAT his fish. You shouldn't be slamming your beliefs down his throat."
543763,Guest,2004-10-14 13:45:00,0,"As a fellow Wisconsinite, and Lac Seul fisherman for two years now, we also take home one above the slot per person. We also eat a large one, per person, per day as well. If you don't like it, bite me. People began to fish back in history to eat, not take a photo and release it. I say this. If the law says you can keep/eat one larger than 23 inches, more power to you, do it if you want - I do, my friends do, the other crews in our camp do too. Now, if the camp you stay at has local rules disallowing that, try to respect it - maybe find a new place next year - no big deal. For someone, see postings above, to judge you eventhough you are well within your rights, is pretty hypocritical in itself. Do what you want to do, not what they want you to do."
543764,Guest,2004-10-14 13:57:00,0,"New to Canada, Well it is possible a 30"" fish could die in the winter, it is also quite posibble for it to live through several more winters (with the potential for a large spawn in the spring). If you went to a lodge then you obey the MNR rules AND the lodge rules. If you go up there completely on your own then you obey the MNR rules, although the ecological and ethical arguments (those in which the camp rules are often based upon) remain the same. Bottom line . . . in my opinion you were wrong, but that's based on my own protocol which stems from my environmental ethic and fisheries biology education/experience. Of note, there are rumblings (and they are only rumblings to my knowledge at this point) that Lac Seul's walleye population pyramid is becoming slightly worrisome in the form of too many old fish. This info could be complete crap, though some of it has come (informally) from both MNR and DFO technical circles. That said, from my firsthand experience on LS this year, there was a noticeably larger amount of sickly-looking fish in the 25""-30"" region. This is nothing to be overly concerned with yet, though a change in the slot or regulations may be forthcoming oonce more science is completed."
543765,Mike Kansas,2004-10-14 13:58:00,1463,"Wooglin, I agree with you. When we fish resorts that allow one over the slot...we do it. When we fish resorts that allow 18"" only we do it. Give respect...Get respect."
543766,Guest,2004-10-14 14:46:00,0,"Wooglin, ""People began to fish back in history to eat, not take a photo and release it."" Historically, people did begin fishing for food. Unfortuneately, your argument has a sudden, tragic death shortly thereafter. I must say, as a guide I would be excited knowing the guided fishing day ended as soon as you caught what you wanted to eat or had your limit. I would have you back on the dock most days before 9:00 a.m. with a full day's pay!!! Of course, I would then go back out fishing myself FOR THE FUN OF IT, including catching, admiring, perhaps photographing and releasing many more fish for the rest of the day. I guess you would be filling your face with 5-12lbs of walleye fillets. If you go there to catch fish only for food . . . One may wonder why you don't just walk down to the market to get your fish fix, after all it is only about EATING the fish for you. You could save $$$ on rods, reels, tackle, accessories, trips, etc. I'm certain most readers of this forum can relate to the desire to travel 10 hours to Canada, and deal with all the logistics and costs associated with such travel, just to get a good old fill of walleye. I'm positive you came all this way just for the food and not for the sport, for the enjoyment, for the solitude, for the comraderie, for the photographs, or for the releases of fish. COME ON!!! History is historic by definition. If you just want to eat walleye all day, and don't want to just visit your local supermarket, then stay home and catch your feed in Wisconsin! Oh, wait a minute, you can't, most likely because your father and grandfathers had the same view as you!!!"
543767,retire55,2004-10-14 15:10:00,1029,"Wooglin: I'll assume that you and your colleagues represent some of Wisconsin's bigger eaters (""We also eat a large one, per person, per day as well""). Eating a 27 inch walleye per day per person wouldn't be easy even if you ate walleye 3 times a day."
543768,Guest,2004-10-14 15:21:00,0,"Biggest problem I worry about is releasing slot fish that are bleeding heavily. I started fishing Lac Seul this year with barbless hooks as opposed to barbed I used in the past. It really reduces damage on slot fish and I dont seem to lose anymore fish barbless than I do with barbs. I would love to see Lac Seul go Barbless....I think it would be good for all of us, especially the slot fish."
543769,Guest,2004-10-14 16:46:00,0,"wow, if i were after meat, i'd stay home and save my money. i could eat a big porterhouse steak every other day of the year for the same cost. ""bite me"". very clever."
543770,Guest,2004-10-14 18:20:00,0,Is this a trick question from (new to canada) I'm not going to bite.
543771,Guest,2004-10-15 06:59:00,0,"Maybe you guys misunderstood me. I don't go to Lac Seul, catch my first four fish, and then head back to camp for food. I fish a good 10-12 hours on the water everyday, for 5 days straight. My boat catchs quite possibly 100 fish per day, releasing ALL of them minus the 8 we decide to keep (yes, there are two of us, so don't say I am 'breaking the rules'). My group of four eat breakfast before we go out, lunch on the lake then have one #### of a fish fry that night. Also, I don't go to Lac Seul only to 'stuff my face with fish', I go for the card games at night, the camp fires, the Northern Lights, chasing bears out of my camp, sleeping in tents, seeing some kick #### storms come in in less that 15 minutes, to see the great people at camp, to learn new fishing tactics, to catch fish I'd never be able to catch in WI - AND, I got to stuff my face with fish. Again, if that is not what you like to do, keep it to yourself, because I really don't care what you do - you choose to CPR, fantastic. I do too, I just keep four of them. What is the problem with that?"
543772,WillieB,2004-10-15 06:59:00,292,Looking for a rise and it looks like he got it.....
543751,Guest,2004-10-14 07:36:00,0,"I was at Lac Seul in July and had good luck with fishing for a change. I only fished before in Wisconsin. My group of 4 caught probably 30 fish over 25 inches during the week, and we let most of them go, but we filleted eight of them to eat. I filleted the 28 to 30 inch fish because I figured that they were closer to dying naturally, and let the 25 and 26 inch fish back. Am I correct that 30 inch fish are on their last leg, (or gill i guess) and will probably not make it through winter. I got yelled at by the resort owner because he saw the carcasses in the garbage. He said that I can only clean fish under 18 inches. The rules I thought said that you can have one in possession over 23. We ate the large fish one night, so we brought home other 4 big fish. If I paid the rate, I should be able to do whatever I want as long as it is within the laws."
543753,Mike Kansas,2004-10-14 08:05:00,1463,"While it is a fact that according to the law you can keep one fish over the slot per day it doesent always meet the camps rule. Most of the camps have a rule that you are not to keep any Walleye over 18"" unless it is going to be used for a skin mount. While this rule does seem unfair its purpose is to benefit all of us and help protect Walleye fishing for the future. Fishing is exactly that fishing...it is not eating. Besides that 18"" Walleye are great to eat and four a day per person is more than enough meat. Conservation and building a better fishery is all of our responsibility and Camp Rules should be followed. If you dont like the rules find someplace else to fish. There are camps on lakes that dont have rules like this but I bet the fishing is not as good...Conservation works....the rules and laws on Lac Seul prove it works. In my opinion the fishing on Lac Seul is much better since the slot limit began protecting the Walleye. After all isnt it more fun to catch and release lots of fish than it is to catch and eat a few."
543754,Guest,2004-10-14 08:57:00,0,YOU WERE WRONG!!!!
543755,bigfish1965,2004-10-14 09:23:00,3210,"IF the law said you were only allowed one fish over 23"" in possession and you took home four, you were in violation of the law. If this is correct, it is too bad you weren't caught."
543756,Guest,2004-10-14 09:27:00,0,"It is four in possession, one over 23, the rest under 18. We had four guys, so that means 16 fish, and four can be over 23. That is what we did."

543761,Guest,2004-10-14 12:31:00,0,"i seriously doubt that the 28-30 inchers are on death's doorstep. probably have another good 4 to 6 years left to live. i am aware that they are not the most prolific breeders, but they must have some really good genes to survive to be 30 inchers. i always admire large fish of any species and attempt to catch and release them. although you may well have been within your legal rights, be aware that many of the fishermen in the camp are looking down on you as some form of lowlife. maybe they won't say anything, but that doesn't mean that they are not having bad thoughts about you and your group. seems like there's always one group in camp that eats the big guys. thankfully, most guys don't and only eat the sub-slot fish. one thing to remember. no one will ever get the thrill of catching, fighting and releasing those big ones again. that includes you guys. if every group did what you did on a consistant basis, i believe that we would soon see the fishery begin to decline. just my opinion."
543762,Guest,2004-10-14 12:39:00,0,Save the fish....if eating fish is that important to you go buy some. Dont mess with the Camp Owners rules. Stay in Wisconsin and fish for Sauger.
