543715,Guest,2004-10-10 23:44:00,0,Hi. OK you must be back from the great white north by now. How was the fishing and the weather? Many people up there yet?
542480,Guest,2004-08-10 13:49:00,0,"Hope I'm not bumping this up too early, but just returned from my summer trip and am already looking forward to going back in 8 weeks for the great fall fishing at LOTW. Who else is heading up this fall? Eastwind, Matches, MTJ and anyone else? Last year early Oct. was unseasonably warm with highs in mid 60s and one day low 70s. The way this year is going we could be icefishing by Oct."
542496,TECK,2004-08-11 06:42:00,151,I'm going to Monument bay the 3rd week in Oct.This is my 2nd year and love this time of the year.
542500,MTJ,2004-08-11 08:48:00,106,Should be up Oct. 14-17.
542507,Matches,2004-08-11 14:59:00,236,Oh yeah! This year I should make it in October. Hate to think of not going and watching you guys post how great it was. That would make another long winter. Plus I have to clean PJM's fish!
543025,Guest,2004-08-28 10:37:00,0,"Well its that time of the year to start gearing up fpr fall hunting and fishing. This year we are giong to try camping on a island in the middle of October and try and earn the title of ""HommeDeNord"". Could be interesting. This year I am going up with a friend that is interested in the muskie and northern fishing. I can accomidate that I prefer walleye and crappie fishing, but, its a trip for two...From what I saw last year it looked as if the crappie fishing hit its peak in the middle of sept to early of october time slot, and that the walleyes did not come into many of there traditional fall spots till late in October. Is there a prime october period for northerns and muskies? And is it all trolling with cranks? Are there weed lines on LOTW in back bays where guys can cast spinners/spoons ect. For northerns and muskies? Thanks for any advise. How does the diver duck outlook look for this year? Hope everyone has a great fall."
543432,Guest,2004-09-23 13:58:00,0,"ttt - I'm heading up in two weeks...anyone else going up to LOTW this fall for walleye, crappie, muskie, ducks and the crisp weather and beautiful colors?"
543433,balsl6,2004-09-23 14:15:00,426,"I am going to go up to the northwest angle probaly in 2 weeks dependes on weather? Going up to the angle, how about you?"
543434,Guest,2004-09-23 14:44:00,0,"balsl6, Heading up to Miles Bay from Oct. 8-17. I did a web search and found the average high for that period in Baudette is 55 and the average low is 34. We've had some snow 3 out of the last 4 years. Last year it got up in the 80s twice."
543437,Guest,2004-09-23 16:53:00,0,just confirmed are reservations for oct9-12.hopefully we can keep my dad in the boat this year.

535512,PJM,2003-10-27 12:03:00,3516,Pulp Fishing Go to this site and it might give you some idea of what is going on on LOTW www.livejournal.com/users/buenavista
535519,Guest,2003-10-28 06:40:00,0,rgate. thanks for the link. it is exactly what i am looking for.. how do i get some info on the outpost. maybe next year? pf
535524,Guest,2003-10-28 13:10:00,0,The Blue Bill hunting has been terrible. Last week for about five days we were able shoot about twenty a day. But since then it's been pretty bleak. With the snow last night we are maybe things will change. Last year was so good and so far this year is a disappointment but I blame it on the warm weather. This snow is the first real weather we have had. For the outpost and Buena Vista info see buenavistaresort.com
535580,Guest,2003-11-04 06:22:00,0,"rgate, thanks for the post. i'm now on to lake st clair to chase the bluebills. lots of ducks there. we just need some wind. send some down from lotw for us. i'll be in touch about next october.pf"
535658,Guest,2003-11-13 17:02:00,0,The last three days of hunting on Lake of the Woods were great. We shot limits each day and saw a lot of ducks but had to set up quite few times to get under them. We did set up one day across from Drennen point on the small island and shot 18. The weather was cold and snowy and there was about two inches of ice on the boat. On Nov. 6th everything started to freeze up and by the 5th there was ice as far as I could see out from Buena Vista. So I left and headed south until next spring when walleye season opens again.
535720,Matches,2003-11-23 19:46:00,236,"So there was 3 or 4 days in November of open water on LOW. Rick, I'm curious if you saw anyone fishing those few days in November?"
535724,Guest,2003-11-24 09:44:00,0,"I left the lake on Nov. 7th and there was ice as far as I could see. The last three days I hunted - Nov. 3,4,5 - I never saw a fisherman anywhere. I think the last I fished was Sat. Nov 1st and the crappies were really biting but it was cold."
535795,Guest,2003-12-02 13:18:00,0,"rgate, how would you compare this years duck hunting on lotw with the last few. my experience this year was bleak. there were no bills when we were there from oct 12 to 18. there was noreal ringneck hunting because of all the rice in the bays and i'm now too old to slog for mallards (56). last year the bluebill hunting was great and the year before we found lots of ringnecks around the bays by boggy and in obabikon. this year nada. how was it for you guys. pf"
535797,Guest,2003-12-02 15:24:00,0,This year was hit and miss. One day we would do fine and then go back the next and there was no ducks and we would have to travel all over the lake to look for some more. Hardly any Ringbills this year. The last three days were the best just before freeze up. Last year was excellent and everyone came back looking for the same again this year. Last year it was colder earlier in October maybe that was the difference.
535814,Matches,2003-12-03 15:52:00,236,"So you're saying fishing on LOW in November isn't always out of the question. Nov. 1, 2004??? PJM, can I ride in your boat? I'd freeze to death in mine."
535390,Guest,2003-10-15 17:17:00,0,just got back grassy narrows the fishing was awesome!!! thanks to everyone who chimmed im with info.
535414,Guest,2003-10-18 14:18:00,0,"just returned from miles bay. crappie and perch were very active. some big crappie. not much on the muskies. absolutely no bluebills in the entire area. the only negative is that buena vista camp seems to have set up an outpost camp right next to drennan's which is bad news for anyone else ever trying to hunt there. just another example of the creeping nature of commercialism in an otherwise great part of canada. we had a nice response from a guide in the basil channel area. we were layout hunting beyond drennan. no ducks so we were picking up the decoys when a boat came out to see what we were up to. they saw us pulling stuff up out of the water and were concerned that we had a capsize on our hands. we were ok but appreciated the concern. checked at lake st clare and no ducks there yet either. oh well, they have to come sooner or later. pf"
535415,Guest,2003-10-18 20:10:00,0,"We (Buena Vista) have had a cabin in the Basil near Drennan Point for at least 12 years. Our cabin has been there for at least 30 years, it is the grey one that is hard to see, in fact you can't see it from Drennan Point and the first hunters we will have in it this year will be this coming sunday. So no one was competing with you. Besides the best hunting isn't always on the point. What we don't care for is when someone parks a houseboat right on the point."
535416,Guest,2003-10-18 22:25:00,0,Rgate How late in the season do you keep that cabin open and are you still fishing. Mortz..........
535422,Guest,2003-10-19 14:15:00,0,In relation to Basil Point where is Drennan Point? It's not marked on my map.
535425,Guest,2003-10-19 20:36:00,0,It's the long sand point off Bigsby at the south end of the Basil Channel. The cabin is open until freeze up.
535426,Guest,2003-10-19 20:38:00,0,I'm duck hunting but fishermen keep buying minnows and the weather has been great.
535435,Guest,2003-10-20 13:46:00,0,"rgate. if i was wrong about buena vista i apologize. when we went by drennans almost everyday there were hunters on the point. there is a cabin directly across the channel which had boat traffic every time we were there. i was told, maybe by someone who had their info wrong that this was an outpost camp and that it had hunters the last three weeks on a daily basis. anyway, the bills seem to be more elusive every year and i agree that houseboats on the beach there is a real pain in the kiester. there may be better spots to hunt but not many. i've hunted all up and down and around the basil and the islands east of fish narrows and for my money i'd take drennans over them all. good luck the rest of the season. they've got to show up sooner or later. pf"
535437,Guest,2003-10-20 20:12:00,0,Our first duck hunters went to the Basil yesterday. The party before that was three women and the closest they got to a duck was to play dress-up with the decoys by the stove in the cabin. We shot 28 Blue Bills today but not on Drennan so there are some ducks around. The wind is blowing from the northwest tonight and it could be better tomorrow.
535508,Guest,2003-10-27 09:02:00,0,"rgate. if you wouldn't mind, i'd like to know how the bluebill hunting is going as the season progresses. i'm not looking for your 'secret spots' or anything, just an idea of how the birds are coming down, how the shooting has been and the volume of hunters in the channel area. thanks in advance. pf"
533924,Guest,2003-07-29 16:12:00,0,Thanks for the helpful information!
533929,Matches,2003-07-29 20:13:00,236,"Question for those who have been in Obabikon lately. Once in, I have noticed some boats will split between the point and first island, and others will swing way around the island as they proceed going east. The map shows a 1 foot hump just a little east of that first island. With the lake so low, is that 1 foot hump now exposed above water? Thanks for the info?"
533951,MTJ,2003-07-30 07:05:00,106,I haven't been up into Obobikan this year but I would expect that if the charts show a 1 ft. hump then it is 1-2 feet out of the water. From what I have found the lake is 2-3 feet below the charts.
533962,Guest,2003-07-30 12:32:00,0,"Matches, I don't recall seeing that hump last week but I always swing north around the end of the grass and then head southeast to avoid that shallow area entirely. I did see a boat swing thru the grass to the south of that little island last week but unless you really know the area it's safer to go around to the north. HommeDeNord, as some of the other guys on this board have said, Oct. can be outstanding for walleye and crappie. Crappie usually can be found in the Elbow in Obabikon (look on your map and it's the deeper part of Obabikon that looks like an elbow) and in the Thompson Creek area. Crappie also are good around Hay Island. I've heard guides say the crappie relly turn on when the weather gets bad and I've had good luck in bad weather but also have had good days when it was mild and in the 50s. I use a crappie rig with with white twister tails on the upper hooks and a minnow on the bottom. Crappie seem to hit the plastic more than the minnow. I've found walleye in 18-24 feet in small bays near narrow channels and you can get 50-100 on a good day. Good luck."
534134,Guest,2003-08-04 21:30:00,0,"Thanks for all the info. I love LOTW. To be honest I believe there are many, many beautiful places to go in this world but LOTW on a calm evening watching the sun set, and a flock of bills flying over...Can't beat it. Reminds me of a poem in Aldo Leopolds ""Sand County Alminac"", called ""Goose Music"". Take care of our beautiful resourses guys wither in the states or Canada. They are truly few and far between. ...""Always leave your campsite cleaner when you leave than when you arrived""....This is a great site living vicariously through everyones trips and dreams...Keep em' comin..Have fun everyone."
535121,Guest,2003-09-22 12:02:00,0,Anybody had any crappie action in the past week or two (mid-Sept) in the Morson area?
535124,Guest,2003-09-22 13:27:00,0,Check out Richard Gates Live Journal on the Buena Vista Resort website. Looks like they've been doing real well in Miles Bay.
535202,Guest,2003-09-26 21:14:00,0,"Yes it is cold up here during October, and some of the lodges are closed only because of bookings no doubt. However as a former guide on this body of water for over 20 years, I would prefer the months of Sept and Oct for a couple of reasons. 1-no heavy traffic. You have almost the whole lake to yourself. Unless of course people believe this post as I say the fishing is awesome on LOTW during this time of the season. Bigger fish for sure. This is the time to hunt down that trophy of any species. 20-lb northern are not uncommon, large smallmouth, excellent muskies also. Every species is on the fed and putting on the fat for the winter months when there is 4 feet of ice on the lake. So in MY estimatation, if you can handle the cooler temps (like dress for this eh?) you are in for a wild time of great fishing."
535234,bubbalou,2003-09-29 07:43:00,29,Just got back last Friday from Nestor Falls. We fished two days on LOW and did okay on crappies. We didn't have to go any farther out then Cyclone Point. The fish were schooled up in 30-32' of water. You just had to find the schools and hover over them. Caught all sizes but more big the small. Went out the way out to Sand Bay on Tuesday and that was just a waste of gas. Looks like I should have
535236,Guest,2003-09-29 09:03:00,0,I don't deer hunt anymore but still enjoy the hunting shack and fellowship. So we fish the Rainy River between the lake and Baudette every opening deep hunting which is the first part of November.
533676,Guest,2003-07-22 00:10:00,0,where is buena vista?
533698,Matches,2003-07-22 12:57:00,236,Is the third week of October about as late as anyone goes up to fish LOW?
533699,Guest,2003-07-22 13:00:00,0,Depends on the year. Last year October 20 there was ice in the back of bays. I have been there November 1 and fished in 60 degrees. Most years you could probably get out until the end of October.
533702,MTJ,2003-07-22 14:14:00,106,"Buena Vista is two bays west of Hanson Bay. Im sorry for using a bad geographical reference. I don't have my charts, they are in my boat at the cabin, or I would give buoy #'s and/or GPS coordinates."

533894,Guest,2003-07-28 15:13:00,0,"You guys really got me going now. Returned last night from a ten day trip to Miles Bay area and we are returning for a ten day trip in October. I agree that the fall trips at LOTW are something special. The walleye spots mentioned by HommeDeNord sound like they could be great producers in the fall. I've never tried them because we have narrows less than half mile from camp that consistently produce lots of fish. I think I'll try a couple of those spots this year though. If any of you see a guy with a white dog in his boat this fall stop over and say ####o. Short summary of the trip I just returned from: had some great walleye fishing on the reefs off of Rubber and Pony Islands. Some summer crappie in Obabikon but man is it tricky getting in there with the water so low. Didn't chase muskies much, save that for the fall, but some guys in camp got some. The water was clear when we arrived but the algae bloom started to come on about the middle of last week. One bad thing about this fall is that currently there's a ban on bringing any moose or deer from Canada into the US. So, there may not be many moosehunters in the camps. October is only two months away!"
533915,Guest,2003-07-29 10:31:00,0,"Rockpt, I will be going up mid Sep. Could you be more definitive re: getting into Obabikon? Is it a wade and drag situation or just pole the boat, etc? Is fighting the current(?) when the wind is up a factor? Would you want to share where you got the summer crappies? Thanks"
533918,Guest,2003-07-29 12:42:00,0,"Bill, It's not wade and drag getting into Obabikon but depending on your knowledge of the narrows and your boat handling skill you might want to kill and lift the motor and pole thru the narrows, I'm talking about the really narrow passage where the rocks are. As always, stay way to the left but a couple of rocks that you probably would clear easily are now in play. The current is not much of a factor. I actually backed thru for more boat control but that risks doing more damage if you hit a rock. After you get thru it's about 1-2 feet (but soft bottom of course) until you get out of the grass so just gun it and get up on plane. Got some summer crappie up in the elbow but not the action you see in the fall. Have a great trip. rockpt"
533603,Guest,2003-07-18 22:51:00,0,"Going up to lake of the woods in october just wondering if anyone has experience in the middle of this month and what the potential for walleyes and crappies are. Any input would be greatly appriciated. If you possibly would have any advise on areas, that would be great. Thank you."
533605,Guest,2003-07-18 23:59:00,0,####o. We have been up to ear falls in the middle of september and were the only ones in the camp and it was cold all day. I cant imagine october. the ice must be forming by then. How is the fishing then? I thought the camps would be closed up by then.
533612,MTJ,2003-07-19 08:02:00,106,"LOTW in October is AWESOME. The walleys are usually active in chanels adjacent to deep water. The crappies are always hot throughout the month of October. Hay Island, Thompson Creek, Obobikan Lake are always hot spots. Muskies are also active in October. Best luck pulling cranks around rock piles and through main lake chanels. Not a lot of fishing pressure and beautiful colors. I could spend the whole month on LOTW."
533613,Guest,2003-07-19 09:54:00,0,"We Have had some fantastic luck for walleye, crappies, perch, and northern in the month of october. And yes, mother nature can be at her best and worst behahior. We go out of Buena Vista fron the 12/20th of october. Can be a bit chilly. We ran up to sabischosching last year and the wind changed on a dime and within 30 minutes we had a bit of trouble rounding the corner around nangoshing island and the final streach of open water that is open from the basil to the resort. We doo very well for crappies in miles bay. What I would like to know are some good areas other than thompson creek, sabischoshing, ect. for walleyes, crappies, and northerns. I really like expolring that lake, It is a beautifull lake at that time of the year. We do duck hunt at that time of the year but it seems to be a hit and miss venture. Some days unbelievable to the next day not understanding where the ducks went. Have any of you caught any fish at this time of the year in Dawsons Channel, Naongashing Channel, stairway pt., both sides of Comegan Island, the north side of Splitroock Island, and around Buckeye Island?....I have been studying the maps, and looking for spots that I thing the bait fish may congregate tooo spawn, around 30 ft. of water with island producing current lines. Thank you again for any info. I am not going to proof read this so sorry for the spelling and grammor.."
533619,Guest,2003-07-19 15:59:00,0,MTJ...Can you explain pulling cranks thru main lake channels...what kind of cranks and poss. where...Thank you
533624,kman,2003-07-19 19:29:00,641,"Better take your warm clothes! I fished lotw with a group of walleye fishermen for 3 years running for a week each mid- September. Cold front after cold front. The fishing can be good or not, it all depends on the weather. We gave up on late fall trips that far north. I really enjoy mid-summer trips up there when the weather and fishing is stable. It's much more predictable."
533625,Guest,2003-07-19 20:04:00,0,I can vouch for the fellow who fishes out of Buena Vista in October. I've been here thirty years and the first three weeks in October is one of my favorite times of the year but it's not for the faint hearted. It can snow or be warm and balmy. Last year was one of the great years for Blue Bills. You can count on the crappies biting in one of three places: Miles Bay or Obabikon Lake or at Hay Island. The walleyes are found in narrow channels about 30 feet deep where there is some current. Bring warm and dry clothes.
533627,Guest,2003-07-19 22:19:00,0,"####o Rick..I have been up to BV 3 years missing the last two because we had twins. Buena Vista runs a class act and we will be booking in the next week. I love the 3rd month of october up there..Yes it can be the best and worst of mother nature..but that is a bit of the fun. We have done very well in all of the spots that you have spoke of. What is your opinion of hay Island vs Thompson Creek area for size of crappie. My experience had told me Ill catch bigger fish @ thompson and higher numbers around Hay. My dad Don Avenson and Rodger Gilmer are lifetime fans of BV Resort, and fans of the late fall up there. They were on drennans for a week in the 3rd weekend of october last year and all they could tell me was that I chose the wrong year not to go up because the hunt out there for Bluebills was stellar. Well what I am trying to do studying my maps is to isolate 5 spots for walleyes that on a daily basis(if the fishing is doing well) myself and my buddies can depend on. Obviously the tops would be sabaschoshing and the rainy river...but I just have this stubborn thought that there has to be other spots that the bait fish stack up and the walleyes follow...I guess it comes down to explore and find out. Little story...3 years ago on our 5th day out the wind came up straight out of the west at about 25mph. We were just hammering the walleyes in sabaschoshing and stayed out way to late. Anyways we hit the narrows comeing thru game wardens bayand aroung the point of nangoshing island..I do not know If you remember my camoflage 18' lund resorter that I had...but...we entered that channel and you would not believe how big the waves had grown from the little traverse..It was like when the waves hit that channel that they even grew larger...anyways we hit a rouge wave and torpedoed under about 3 ft. of water and came popping back out. At this point we had taken on so much water the water level in my boat was at my knees....SCARY....Here is the really dumb part....We bailed the boat, recooped from the fear and then decided to stay out for the evening hunt wet. We did shoot alot of ducks that night....but....from mink narrows back to BV, in the dark, was again a very tough venture...once we got out in the open from rabbit point again we hit big water, in the pitch dark...My buddies thought it was fun...I on the other hand was white knuckling the ride back...When Brian turned the q-beam on and I looked out and saw that the waves were appx. at my eye level i was quite scared. We did get back, should have pitched the emergency tent we keep in the boat...And the moral of the story is...dont be an Idiot....When they say small craft warnings they mean it...:) Well Ill see you up there in late october and hope the fishing treats you well this year..Clay Avenson"
533628,Guest,2003-07-19 22:30:00,0,Well I dont know how my post that is above yours rgate got there but I ment it to be a following reply...hope you see it.
533652,MTJ,2003-07-21 07:13:00,106,"We usually pull 9"" Rapala's, any color, mostly shad and firetiger. We start at the first red bouy east of the point north of BV. Work around all the reefs then start making our way up to Burrow. Run through the east side of Burrow and head west down the north side of Rabit. We have also worked east to the Split rock river. Just keep working around the reefs and running any channel that has current and bait fish. Where there is bait fish there is usually Walleys and Muskies. As for the walleyes we usually work the east side of Comegan and the north side of Rabit where the cannel narrows. The north side of Rabit is usally the best and protected from the north wind. Good luck."
