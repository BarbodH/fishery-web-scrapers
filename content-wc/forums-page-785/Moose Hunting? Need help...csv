I have always wanted to head way way north to the Alaska parts for the Yukon variety but would gladly try a hunt in Canada first. They seem a bit more reasonable from an expense level and most of the people I talk with who go up there seem to have good hunts. I'm not sure whether I'd rather do a bow or gun hunt, I'm pretty deep into bowhunting but may just opt for gun hunting the first time to see what its all about and my friend only rifle hunts. If any of you guys have recommendations on where to start putting a hunt together or know of good guide services who put up quality hunt from quality camps and are reasonably priced(I don't mind paying more to get better service in better area's with better animals)I'd appreciate any feedback you have. I'm located in Western Montana so would love to find something in BC or Alberta or Sask. but will consider where ever the best hunts can be had. What should one expect to pay for a good hunt from a camp with good accomidations and food as well as good animal density and average to above average sized bulls? Thanks for the help, RJ in Montana.."

She could apply as a resident and name a non-resident as member of the party. Long and short of it is $80.00 license and $240.00 plane ticket, he is on a moose hunt. I'll let you know how he does next week. I'm sure they will not even come close to the size possible in Yukon."

While the moose aren't as big as Alaskan, they'll be bigger than you want to haul out and the price will be half of what's been quoted so far. There's a toll-free number also there."
