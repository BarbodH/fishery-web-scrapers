543660,stukaboy,2004-10-06 10:54:00,14,Does anyone have any experience on this lake with Wilderness North Outfitters? I'm looking for a well-run fly in operation with a nice Walleye/Pike Lake. Would like to do a fly in June 2005 or Sept 2005. Any information you might have would be greatly appeciated.

Which outfitter out of Armstrong and which lake? I have flown in with Mattice Lake Outfitters on 2 different occasions. Great service and great fishing. June 18-25 was about the time I was looking at. Would be interested in knowing more."
543705,Guest,2004-10-08 06:08:00,0,we are using northern outposts.have been with them 6 years now.they charter the flying with wilderness north or mattice lake.fishing has been some of the best we have seen in 40 years of fly ins.price is a little higher because of 150 mile flight.they have website at northern outposts.com--dont know much about lake other then it is about 20 mile water system with no one else there which is a nice feature.tim [email protected]
