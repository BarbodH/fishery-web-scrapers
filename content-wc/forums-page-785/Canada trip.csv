543816,luvs2fish2,2004-10-18 13:48:00,16,Just got back from my first trip to Canada and my first time really walleye fishing. The trip was unbelievable!! I just can't put into words the feeling of hooking one of those walleye. I boated my biggest fish ever at just over 11 pounds. The beauty of that green back and the awesome feel of the power of that fish is something that a person just won't forget. The locals were wonderfully friendly and loaded with information. It's a trip that i will relive in my mind for years The only problem-------the week went by too quickly!!!!!!!

543854,Guest,2004-10-19 13:21:00,0,Where did you go?
543856,Hawgeye,2004-10-19 14:25:00,1355,"I too am curious as to where you were fishing. Since you referenced ""Greenback"", I can only assume you went to Pine Falls or the Red River at Selkirk. Any system in the lake Winnipeg system has 'greenbacks' and that is the only place I have ever heard of that term. Are these genetically linked to Lake WInnipeg or is the color due to the water's chemical makeup and the water clarity and depth? I would be curious to know as these fish have the most brilliant color of a silvery, almost flourescent green. AWESOME"
543857,luvs2fish2,2004-10-19 14:38:00,16,I went to the Red River mostly. I was told that the green color is a product of the chemical makeup of the water in Lake Winnipeg. They are a beautiful color.
