6627640,Obabikon,2022-01-24 06:21:00,2370,"Bullheads are still around, but we don't fish for them. You need to go into mud flats in the summer (especially around evening time)... gob of worms and you'll catch them. Off the north point of Pine Island (between the island and the buoy)... in the evenings you can catch them there."
6627846,billy weaver,2022-01-24 21:51:00,470,Back about 20 years ago while fishing Black Sturgeon Lake near Konora we got into brown bullheads while fishing for small mouths the first week in June. We were catching big bullheads of about 2 lbs. a piece. We filleted some and they were really good. The camp owner told us they were not any good to eat but being from Iowa we had fished and ate black bullheads. In my life I have not caught any bullheads as big and many as those we caught on that trip. I will add that Black Sturgeon Lake really has some monster smallmouths and that was the reason for the trip to that lake. Billy
6627860,fishingfrenzy,2022-01-25 04:53:00,262,I saw fair amounts last summer in the local rivers. Big schools of young. Sent from my SM-N960U1 using Tapatalk
6627880,Baseline,2022-01-25 06:17:00,3207,For several years we would stay overnight on Caliper Lake near Nestor Falls before flying out to one of the resorts outposts. We would go down to the dock in the evening and sip a few beverages and throw a line baited with a crawler. Bullheads were more than willing to take out baits.
6627886,Guest,2022-01-25 06:43:00,0,"Not to belabor the thread, but it is a slow time of the year, so.... Dad got a 4lb bullhead once in Turtle Lake, I have a picture somewhere - not going to look for it, tho! . His secret(?) bait was small pieces of cheap beef. Perch would not clean the hook if a worm was used. Bill"
6630792,walleyeguy3,2022-02-04 15:10:00,42,"Caught one about 15 years ago on our annual June LOW fishing trip. Have to agree with that emotion when you are hoping for/expecting a walleye, only to have a bullhead on the line. Made for some good-natured kidding in our boat for the rest of that day."
6631912,MikeinMN,2022-02-09 16:58:00,190,"Back in the early 80's we fished at Morris Point Resort in Baudette on LOTW. We would come up in mid to late May, and one of the groups also staying there at that time came only to fish for bullheads. They fished right off the docks in the boat harbor during the evening into nighttime. Looked like they caught plenty by the remains in the fish cleaning house. They skinned, gutted, and cut the heads off a whole bunch of bullheads! Totally unrelated, at the MDNR hatchery near me, the fish and game guys used to give away all the bullheads that got caught incidentally while netting spawning walleye to strip for eggs and milt. They don't do that anymore."
6626362,Bill Krejca,2022-01-20 07:15:00,6107,"Just thinking things are slowing down a bit, so here's a new subject. We used to catch a few bullheads on parts of LOW, Turtle Lake, Obabikon, etc. I haven't heard anything about them, ever, maybe. Not that I care for them, although Dad used to like eating them, me not so much. Dad had a way of getting them after dark using ol' Iowa river ways. Some time ago, Obabikon Lake had, it seemed, thousand of bullheads, saw them on the surface one fall, at first thought we had run into a gigantic school of crappies, but them realized they were bullheads. Anybody ever catch any? Next, we'll cover bluegills, same waters. Bill"
6626394,prov1800,2022-01-20 08:20:00,5010,Caught lots as a kid when my dad and uncles took me to Lake Manitoba.2 he trip from Winnipeg.Not sure what kind they were but we ate them.Cant remember if they were any good.Last time I had catfish was when my wife and i were in Springfield Missouri at the Bass Pro shop and they had it for lunch there.Really enjoyed.
6626478,emma17,2022-01-20 13:21:00,436,"Bullheads! I love the memory of Bullheads as we caught so many in Northern Minnesota when I was a kid. I took my kids to the same lake many years later, and we caught and ate Bullhead. My goodness the kids loved the idea of skinning and eating them. Despite those fond memories, it's still a huge disappointment to reel in the fish and catch first glimpse of that brown body and whiskers. I've fished LOW a few times, no Bullhead for our group."
6626482,stumcfar,2022-01-20 13:34:00,451,"Caught a big old bullhead once up at the Northwest Angle on the Minnesota side. All excited to see the nice walleye coming up and nope it was a bullhead. Used to catch bunches of them just before dark at the docks in Warroad, MN on the MN side of LOW."
6626494,Walleye2242,2022-01-20 14:17:00,263,lots of bullheads in the river where my cabin is in Illinois. Do not want to catch them there and certainly not up in Canada.
6626636,Ltrain,2022-01-20 22:05:00,4145,I do remember running into a mess of them fishing in Minnesota as a kid. Uncle had us bring them home and he had them smoked. Boy did they taste good.
6626646,muskyman73,2022-01-21 02:02:00,401,"We fish Obabikon lake quite a bit and have never seen one - but we have never targeted them either. We did catch one in Nestor Falls back in the 90's though. Seeing them on the surface would have been a cool site to see, you never know what you may encounter up there."
6626654,fishin779,2022-01-21 05:20:00,63,"I have caught them in the Sioux Narrows area a few years ago while fishing for smallmouth early in the year. Living in Iowa, along the Mississippi , I have never fished for them while on LOW."
6626678,prov1900,2022-01-21 06:55:00,544,"Caught them later in the evening, fishing from the docks at Indianhead. Grew up in Iowa eating bullheads. Cut the head off, gut them, flour and throw in a skillet with butter. Didn't even skin them lol."
6627324,Bill Krejca,2022-01-23 08:04:00,6107,"Remember watching a bullhead guarding the nest at the camp at Turtle Portage, long time ago. It fanned the nest, water was right near the path, so could observe for a number of days. I also remember seeing dozens of fanned out spots in the shallow end of Turtle Lake; at the time, I thought they were the remnants of bluegill nests, but thinking back, perhaps likely they were from bullheads. Must have bullheads on my mind, winter is getting old already!!!! Bill"
