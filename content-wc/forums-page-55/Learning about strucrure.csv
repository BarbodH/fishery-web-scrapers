6629688,Pooch,2022-01-31 17:46:00,4618,In a recent post I mentioned that I've learned a lot about fish and structure from watching animals including our house cat. I dropped an extension cord on the living room floor while doing some small jobs today. When the puditat saw the cord she immediately went to it and spent the afternoon there. Now it's evening and she came back after her supper and is once again parked herself there. Nature is really interesting. Pooch

They definitely follow regular paths. I suppose that isn't news to trappers, but I found it interesting. They don't use the structure available to them as much as I had expected either."

Basically creating a series of poles sticking out of the water. Coming back the next days and days after the crappies had associated to these and I simply was casting to them from a distance to catch fish. Before regular fishing opened I just come back and pull. Its been years since If done it but I was always amazed how a single stick in the water would attract and hold fish."

Thinking back over my observed life, I have come to the conclusion that all of life has a pattern - i.e., folks' actions reflect their prior experiences, and maybe can be somewhat predictable, if a familiarity is established. I guess it is easier to go back than ahead, as far as fortune telling goes. I believe less(?) intelligent creatures also develop life patterns, and those who seek out these creatures (like fish, rabbits, deer, etc) rely, usually, on understanding these patterns, whether it be places they hide, or eat, and/or to just move around. Folks familiar with these patterns are generally more successful in their pursuit of same. Understanding the pursued, like trying to understand people, is best accomplished by those willing to spend the time to absorb the habits and speculative reasons there for. Rambling done! Bill"
