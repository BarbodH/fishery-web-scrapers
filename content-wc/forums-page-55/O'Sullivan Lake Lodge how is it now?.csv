I was there 28+ years ago and I am considering going back for some nostalgia with my sons, as this was the trip that hooked me on Canadian fishing! . Looking for information on the Maniwaki road; how rough is it now and also, how is the road into camp? Is the camp well run?, I believe it changed ownership since I was there. In addition any information you feel like share that might sway my decision (fishing quality, boat condition, cabin condition, camp workers). Thank You JB"

6626670,JBWall,2022-01-21 06:26:00,2,"Bill , Thank you for the reply. It was a spine jarring ride 28 years ago and I heard that section of road isn't maintained any longer. JB"
