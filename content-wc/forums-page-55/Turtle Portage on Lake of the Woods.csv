5025945,Hawker,2016-07-28 12:54:00,3967,"Actually, last year Perry and another camp owner from Duck Bay (I think) offered to assist in maintaining the portage. I spent two (2) days with Perry, the other owner and his son working on it. Totally replaced the cable which was broken, repaired/replaced a couple of the rollers/guides, re-welded the side rails on the cradle. Cradle side rails were broken because too many people were attempting to utilize the portage with boats much too big to be using the portage and people bending the side rails to accommodate their big boats. The portage system is a good system, but a whole lotta folks abuse it in so many ways. It was still working when I was up in May and June of this year but my boat is too big to utilize it so we trailered to Vic & Dots and launched there instead. I did notice one of the side rails broken off again on our last visit, likely from someone using it with a bigger boat than it's designed for. Bill mentioned someone running the track wheels off at the end and that's simply because they were too lazy to utilize the brake system at the winch wheel, put a big rock on the brake step and let the trolley free wheel to the end. Served him right getting ""stranded"" on the opposite side of where his vehicle and trailer were located and creating undue hardship on others that relied on the portage that day!!!"
5026049,jambi,2016-07-28 13:41:00,504,"Hawker - I still love Perry, but he always frowned when I went up there - even when I went with you, Jack, and Mikey. Anyway I hope the trolley is functional for everyone."
5026073,Hawker,2016-07-28 13:48:00,3967,You know why he frowns about it don't ya? Been several times over the years guests have gone into Whitefish only to get back to the portage and it's broken and he's had to haul trailer(s) over to Vic & Dot's to get them and bring them back LOL! I have a pretty good list of things to make Perry frown too haha!!
5027321,Vic&Dots,2016-07-29 07:59:00,2,"Sorry have not heard of anything , I do not believe theres a government siteThe idea was for only 16 foot skiffs to go across Have a great weekend"
5027673,jambi,2016-07-29 09:58:00,504,"Yep - exactly. I love telling him I will be down in Stoney Portage Bay. That old head shake of his is classic. Then when I tell him how good we did, he'll say ""See, I told you the fishing was good down there!""My buddy leaves for Youngs in three weeks. This will be he second trip this year, both with his wife! I'm so jealous!"
5643625,Guest,2017-07-03 08:54:00,0,Someone had told me that the cables and bearings have recently been replaced on the portage. Anyone try using it this year with any information?
5643977,Obabikon,2017-07-03 11:56:00,2370,"I have not tried it this year... however, I do want to add... If your boat is larger than 17', weighs more than 1500 pounds, or has an engine larger than a 90.... DO NOT TAKE IT OVER THIS SYSTEM... YOU ARE THE ONES SCREWING IT UP FOR EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There are signs posted about the limits. Also, please control the wheel all the way through the process. Letting it race down the hill creates a backlash.... rant over..."
6629410,manfishing,2022-01-30 15:52:00,131,"The turtel Portage is being rebuilt, With completion in summer of 2022."
6629484,prov1800,2022-01-30 21:18:00,5010,Just read its going to cost 800.000 bucks to fix it.Thats ridiculous
6629574,Bill Krejca,2022-01-31 07:44:00,6107,"I thought I read where finally the moneys were budgeted for fixing the portage. Limiting boat size to 16 ft seems to not be a rational proposal, as so many boats being used in the area exceed that length. It would be convenient for bein able to go between waters, and I think the applicable camps would be in favor of it, as it opens up the ability of fishing totally different water systems. Bill"
5006033,BRP,2016-07-20 20:18:00,77,http://youtu.be/feYGLq817Fc Interesting video of another lift system on lotw near kenora
5022081,muskyman73,2016-07-26 21:24:00,401,"We did not use the portage but we checked it out and did pretty good on the dock in whitefish on smallies. I wonder if it would support my 18 ft crestliner with a 150 on it ? We really wanna try it next year but then again, I don't wanna dump my boat on the concrete either."
5022425,Knutson21,2016-07-27 05:53:00,348,"We used it in 2008 to move my 175 Navigator across and another guys Lund Explorer. When we got there the system was broken and It took us over an hour to untangle all the cables and rig the system to function. Was it worth the time we spent probably not, but the experience was fun. I have heard that Young's Wilderness Camp is now the maintainer of the system and it is supposed to only be used by smaller boats."
5023001,Slushfish,2016-07-27 10:01:00,263,"We were there last week. Our boat's too wide but the boys ran the carriage back and forth both ways, seemed to work fine."
5023025,Hot Runr Guy,2016-07-27 10:05:00,16061,"That belt system is slicker than snot. Might be hard on the transducers, though. HRG"
5023121,Bill Krejca,2016-07-27 10:42:00,6107,"One fellow a few years ago had the track wheels run off the end of the track and become lodged, preventing further use. This was during a low water level year. Unfortunately, his boat was trapped on the lake end opposite from where his trailer was, resulting in a hitch hike of miles back to his trailer. I have pictures of the channel being dug, back in the early 1950's, the lake trout situation mentioned above was spot on, blocking it was the wise thing, but there sure was some great fishing when the current flowed between the waters! Bill"
5023153,Low4fish,2016-07-27 11:07:00,37,I recall going through there when it was a free flowing channel. Had to weave through the rocks a bit but it was passable. Then it went to the lock. That was a pain. The trolley I have only been across a few times with a skiff . In hind sight i think the decision for the trolley was a good one.
5023889,JMKC,2016-07-27 16:01:00,238,"Used that belt in June 3 times, have to lift ducers, also a bimini top could be a problem and a $4.00 charge each way. When the gate is lowered and water is flowing out of Longbow it's Smallmouth every cast in the channel. FUN !"
5024313,jboutdoorguy,2016-07-27 19:44:00,81,Thanks for the info guys. Vic&Dots have you heard any more since it was worked on? Is there a government website that would have current info? Does anyone have the info posted for the lift? Size and weight limit?
5025097,jambi,2016-07-28 07:28:00,504,I'd be surprised that Perry would maintain the trolley. He didn't seem to like us going over; likely because of potential for problems on the trolley but we did anyway. Had some great success in Whitefish Bay. Lots of nice pike. Super fun to catch in the clear water. I'd love to go back!
5004689,srk-low,2016-07-20 13:28:00,78,Does anyone know if the rail system is functioning from between Whitefish Bay and Turtle Lake. If weight is a consideration my ride is a Crestliner 1800 I/O. Thanks.
5004769,pjshorthorn,2016-07-20 14:12:00,5654,"I was there about a month ago just to check out the portage. We did not attempt to use the portage system,but it did seem to be functioning just fine. I was intrigued with the trolley system so I started goofing with it to see how it worked and the trolley seemed to move just fine. I don't recall any weight restrictions,but the beam of a vessel is a limiting factor. I think the widest beam it accommodates is 84"".Attached is a picture I took. Hope this helps.PjShorthorn"
5004785,srk-low,2016-07-20 14:18:00,78,I haven't been across the portage in about 25 years. If the max beam is 84 than I'm out of luck with my beam being 94. Thanks for the reply.
5005009,Obabikon,2016-07-20 15:29:00,2370,"There are weight restrictions, but I can't remember. The last one was wrecked because of too big of boats going across. It's been a battle keeping the thing functioning for years. I haven't attempted to cross it in 10+ years, and I tell my guests for the most part not to mess with it."
5005201,WallyWarrior,2016-07-20 16:21:00,2488,"Does that thing cross from one body of water to another, over a section of land? That is pretty dang cool if so. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
5005233,Lake Of The Woods,2016-07-20 16:27:00,124,"Back in 1986-87 while working for the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources in the Kenora area I was part of the crew constructing the lock system at Turtle Portage.Originally it was constructed with gates that would open and close by use of a manual capstan wheel and cable system.However,it was not as effective as anticipated in keeping the tainted water from Turtle Lake entering into the pristine waters of Whitefish Bay as well as the lock doors not working properly thus threatening the Lake Trout habitat and population.It was then converted into the trolly system that exists and is still functioning today.Lake Trout fishing in Whitefish Bay remains very good.I remember when we were living at the construction site at Turtle Portage during the initial construction.In the evenings we would fish Whitefish Bay for Lake Trout and without too much effort catch the allowed limit which supplied the crew with a fresh Lake Trout dinner on a daily basis if wanted.The trolly and cable system is functioning as reported by some local residents to me that live in the area.However,they mentioned that in 2013 the carriage was rebuilt to only transport boats up to 16 feet in length.If your vessel is over that size consider trailering the boat to Vic & Dots Camp and launching there."
5005257,Lake Of The Woods,2016-07-20 16:33:00,124,"Yes,it transports boats up to 16 feet from Turtle Lake to Whitefish Bay and vice versa.Used to be a traditional lock system but was then filled in and converted to a better functioning trolly/carriage cable system."
5005289,srk-low,2016-07-20 16:56:00,78,Obabikon and Lake of the Woods: Thanks for the information. Would be fun to portage again but will have to pass on the idea.

5005457,Vic&Dots,2016-07-20 18:09:00,2,Hi AllDocks & Lifts was out to the portage today - they did some work on it - The track on the Turtle side has shifted and there may be a problem getting a boat on or off. There is a idea to go back to a rolling system Cheers Robert
