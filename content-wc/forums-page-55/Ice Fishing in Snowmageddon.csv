Unfortunately or fortunately we timed it so we were there with all the crazy snow a few weeks ago Our main plan wasn't accomplished but we got out, caught some fish and had an awesome time even being stuck for an extra day. https://www.northernjacks.com/post/ice-fishing-in-snowmageddon Thanks Andrew"
