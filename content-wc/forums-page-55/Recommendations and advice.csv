Hopefully they are not techies as odds are their won’t be any signal and they will have Mother Nature to enjoy. Honestly, I would read some of the resorts web pages in the area on what to bring and how to fish. I know there are videos on YouTube from some of the “legends” but I always wonder if they actually pay for the trip, is there a guide behind them in a boat or other things that make it look so easy. If they don’t offer a fish / depth finder, I’d bring one along with just looking at google Earth map of the lake along with if the owner can mark you a map. Once again, enjoy it with your family."

Mike will literally spend a ridiculous amount of time with you on the phone to talk with you about how to make your trip great. He also has extensive experience on fishing with kids. He can give you tips and tricks on how to approach a new lake, tackle to bring, time of year advice, species tips, etc. Likely the best $50 you'll spend for the trip (no.. I am not connected to Mike in any way. I just have used his services previously).One word of warning. Mike lives a golden life and you will find yourself insanely jealous in short order. :-)"

6631882,Billswest,2022-02-09 13:55:00,32,"So I booked a trip for 6 of us to fly in to a lake 90 miles north of Kenora. We'll be in an outpost cabin for a week. I'm retired now and haven't done a trip like this in some 30 years. Back then I did several in northern Quebec. I booked this trip mostly because I wanted my boys and grandsons to experience the far north and the fishing it has to offer. Our trip is scheduled for the 3rd week in June. Looking for any advice and tips from guys who have done a trip like this somewhat more recently. Info. on fishing gear, supplies, clothing and anything else about this neck of the woods would be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys (and gals).... PS: fyi, we are all vaccinated and boosted, and will be flying into Winnipeg from Minneapolis, and have booked a shuttle over to Kenora"
6631890,Rock Hound,2022-02-09 15:22:00,51,"I go almost every year to NW Ontario that time in June (we are always there either the 2nd or 3rd week in June). You are going at a GREAT TIME of the season. - Fishing should be FANTASTIC. I have never done a fly-in at an outpost, so I would leave most of the advice to your outfitter or others that will post about their experience. Fish will still be in shallow water at that time but starting to go out onto the deeper breaks, especially if sunny and still. Overcast and windy, they will be in the shallower water that the wind is blowing into. Jigs are our go to at this time of year, but whatever you have confidence in, you will be able to catch fish on. Not sure if you can bring live bait on such a trip or not, but leeches and crawlers are much easier to keep than minnows, but plastics and other artificial will work too. This sounds like a tremendous adventure - regardless of the bite, you will give your kids and grandkids the memory of a lifetime! The only real equipment advice I will give, is to take something to take a lot of pictures with (even if it is just a cell phone). - Oh, and quality rain gear is a must in my opinion. I cannot place a value on the photos I have of my Dad and me, of my brothers, my sons, etc. - they all bring back such great memories. I am still making memories with my brothers and sons, but the photos and memories they bring back with my Dad are all that I have now & and I am SO GLAD we did those trips and made those memories together! Tight lines and big smiles!."
6631898,adempsey2.0,2022-02-09 16:12:00,611,"Couple quick suggestions:1) Check with the commercial airline to see what they offer in terms of bringing fishing gear. The two major commercial airlines in Canada allow you to bring in an oversized rod tube PLUS a tack box as one normal checked in item. No oversized fee.2) Talk to your outfitter about weight limits. This is more important if they are chartering vs. using their own planes. It is very easy to go overweight, which is often not that big of a deal but can also mean to paying an extra $1/lb in overweight charges to having to leave stuff behind.3) I know many of the outfitters in that area provide some food. So, you may not need to worry about canned goods and potatoes/onions etc. Just perishables. Also, if you are beer/soda drinkers you may be able to get that flown in ahead of time so it doesn't count toward your weight limit.I attached average temperature plots from Red Lake Airport weather station for 2019 to 2021. Not sure if that is near where you are going, but it is 90 miles North of Kenora. Might give a general idea at least.Mean temp ranged from ~45F to 68F, with an average about 61F.https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climat...=2020&Month=6#"
6631902,NM_Trout,2022-02-09 16:30:00,1094,"Poke around on this site, and you will find lots of tackle suggestions. A live or dead minnow on a 1/4 oz lead jig will catch everything :-)We use 3.5"" to 4.5"" soft plastics on above jig. Sometimes 1/8 sometimes 3/8. YMMV. Paddle tail plastics in green pumpkin, grey, chartreuse. You can't go wrong.Bring some spoons too. Red and white daredevil, orange and yellow such as 5 of diamonds. hammered copper or bronze. Johnson silver minnow has caught a bunch. Spinbaits work well for pike. Rapala F11 original crank bait. My go-to is the black and gold. Or perch colored.3000 size spinning reel on a medium or medium heavy rod. Bring a spare rod and reel. I'll never go to an outpost camp without both a mosquito net for the bed, and a headnet. They are a godsend. Buy the best raingear you can afford. Bring things for the kids to do in the cabin if you get weathered in. Good luck. Best memories ever!PS... I have also found that a hard sided golf club case is well tolerated by the airlines, and you can get a crapload of gear in that."
6631920,Old Timer,2022-02-09 17:09:00,255,"You'll get good advice on this website. But here are a couple things. Not sure, but you may need to get a negative Covid test before re-boarding the plane back to the U.S. Not needed if you're returning by car, but maybe so if returning by commercial air transportation. Your outfitter should provide you with an outpost equipment list. But here are a few items I don't forget when fishing an outpost in June. Good rainsuit, gloves and water-proof boots. Plenty of bug dope and cabin spray. Then a warm sleeping bag and pillow. Mid to late June is usually terrific for walleyes. But you can have cool evenings (sometimes cold) and a good risk of showers. Plus the bugs are often a challenge. So stay dry and warm, and be prepared to battle some bugs. You'll have a good time."
6632060,HeHooksHimself,2022-02-10 07:58:00,725,"One warning is that the time you have chosen is prime time for black flies. Some people are not bothered by them but for me and like a few other lucky people I know, I am super sensitive to them. They bury their heads into your skin and inject a venom that results in silver dollar sized red welts that seep a clear liquid and itch like crazy. I don't mean to be dramatic but do yourself a favor and bring deet and a previously mentioned array of netting to protect yourself and others. In spite of these demon black flies, you will make memories that will last a lifetime! Have fun! Fish On! Hooks"
6632088,Bill Krejca,2022-02-10 09:12:00,6107,"Be sure to include a box of mosquito coils for burning inside the cabin in the evening. A half hour burn will kill all, providing the cabin door is not reopened (plan ahead, bring in everything that is outside which you want inside). Ya, the smell may be a little bad, but for a week, it won't kill you. Bill"
6632106,Bigtaproot,2022-02-10 10:39:00,900,If you buy NVDA you can take Netjets with me.
6632116,MikeinMN,2022-02-10 11:07:00,190,"x2 on the mosquito coils and deet! We burn a mosquito coil or 2 in the outhouse as well. Take some sun tan lotion too. I take some light rain gear for rain, wind, and bugs, and I like a portable depth finder. You can rent a satellite phone if you have concerns. Most outfitters provide nets, but ask about life jackets, some do, some don't. You will likely need way less fishing tackle than you think. There are LOTS of old threads here on WC about what to take on fly ins, kinda fun looking through those. I think you will be surprised at how good the cabins are compared to 30 years ago, same airplanes though!"
