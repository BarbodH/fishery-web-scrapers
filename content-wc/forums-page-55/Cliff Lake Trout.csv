Waiting for more spring like temps to show up.Another month or so is usually around the time we get the break.Havnt got out on the lakes much so far for trout or crappies.When I do I'll be trying out your hair jigs for them Ã lso and looking forward to that.Right now the easy access to the ice shack and the good fishing is the smart way to go.
