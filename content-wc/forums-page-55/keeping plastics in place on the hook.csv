6629550,prov1800,2022-01-31 06:33:00,5010,I don't use artificial baits much but do dable with a few here and there and seems they stay on pretty good without going out of my way to make sure they stay on.
6629568,Bill Krejca,2022-01-31 07:32:00,6107,"When using a jig head with a ""holding barb"" on the collar, I like to first push the plastic in the position I want it, then pull back enough so glue can be applied. I find if I don't first position the plastic, it tends to deform as it is pushed onto the glued collar portion - or sometimes it wants to slip back. Bill"
6629572,prov1800,2022-01-31 07:44:00,5010,Just use tubes Bill they never come off.
6629826,NM_Trout,2022-02-01 10:07:00,1094,I thought that superglue was not like loctite (which hardens due to lack of oxygen)... superglue hardens when it absorbs humidity? So maybe dunking it in water makes it harden faster?
6629858,Old Timer,2022-02-01 11:37:00,255,"I know this thread is about keeping a plastic tail on a hook. But in all my decades of fishing Canada there only have been a handful of times when plastics could even come close to live, salted or frozen bait. And in the absence of those, gullet, eyeball or fish belly have out-fished plastics just about every time for me. Not sure, but fish parts are or used to be legal for Ontario sport fishing. Maybe there's a magic plastic out there. But I haven't found it."
6629862,Eckohlt,2022-02-01 11:56:00,3685,You hit the nail on the head!
6629904,Pooch,2022-02-01 14:47:00,4618,"Fishing plastic has a learning curve. You can't just fish it like live bait.Live bait requires little effort on the part of the fisherman. Fooling a fish with plastic takes some effort to learn and make work.Super tough bite? I've got some live bait with me. Average day of fishing? I've got plastic on 95% of the time.Feeling a live minnow struggle through your rod as a predator approaches as great. Convincing a fish that your fake bait is a ""must have"" is a feeling of accomplishment.I love both. Many times fake out fishes live, especially when the bite is on or trolling.Learn to do both well.Pooch"
6629912,Bigtaproot,2022-02-01 15:23:00,900,Great Idea and many thanks for sharing
6629990,Bill Krejca,2022-02-02 08:08:00,6107,"Certainly using artificials (plastic, hair, etc) do require a bit more ""enticing"" on the part of the rod holder - you actually will usually do better holding the rod. So there is some work involved, usually. Many times this can involve moving the bait, but only a tiny, tiny bit. Figuring out how much to move the bait may be the deciding factor on how many fish are caught. I remember many many years ago watching the local fall LOW crappie expert, Richard, trying to figure out how he could catch so many, while the rest of us were just doing ""OK"". I couldn't see him doing much of anything with his rod - finally figured out that's exactly what he was doling - only moving his rod tip enough to convince the fish that it could mouth the bait (tube jig) without exerting much effort, but still causing the bait to look appetizing. This is a trait which can be mastered, but requires some understanding of the conditions. I personally cringe whenever (it happens a lot) I see a video of the bait from an ice fisherman being vigorously pumped up and down, as if in time to some music. But that's just me, whatever works for us, eh? Bill"
6630010,prov1800,2022-02-02 08:46:00,5010,Your absolutly right.Each artificial lure has its own movement.Your hair jigs can catch fish by what I call jigling the bait.But you need a very fast action tip to get it just right. Cant get that action from my ice mojo rods but my homemade ice rod I made from a broken st Croix Avid which was a med x fast is the perfect rod for doing that jigling.But tgen there are days when you have to be very aggressive with lures designed to make noise like when i use my vibratos.But a vibrato can also be jiggled.Your hair jigs work best for me if i lift weight 4 ft up slowly then let weight settle back and watch the hair jig fall ever so slow down for 4 ft.That slow falling action usually gets me a fish as they come off the bottom fast.i have your jig on a 4 ft leader.
6628706,Pooch,2022-01-28 07:38:00,4618,"There was some chatter about losing plastics. I posted something similar to this a year ago on jigs. Since I troll plastics a lot I did the same thing to straight hooks and it works really well. I have a lot of shrink for electrical work. One size was bought by error, but it works well for fish hooks. I use two sizes of shrink for hooks. If you try it, get shrink that shrinks two or three times it's original size and thicker wall is usually better. I don't know the size of the small stuff, but it is a tight fit over the barb when installing. It doesn't have to be pretty, just functional. Before you fufu this idea, try it. You will be amazed at how hard it is to pull the plastic off or move it much. I was, too. Pooch"
6628714,NM_Trout,2022-01-28 07:53:00,1094,"What a great idea! You win for best post today. Thanks. If you have it handy, can you post the brand and part# of the shrink you use?"
6628846,Pooch,2022-01-28 12:36:00,4618,"The smallest is 1/16"" thin wall and the larger is 1/8 inch. Both are Polyolefin 2-1.I buy them from Waytek in 48"" lengths and 50 to a pac. That's a lot of shrink. To get smaller quantities try searching. Shipping from Waytek is expensive for small quantities. Try local hardware store, but the 1/16"" will be hard to find and many times hardware shrink is cheap crap. Pooch"

6629036,Pooch,2022-01-29 10:19:00,4618,"That has been my experience and why I was looking for a better mousetrap. Tried several things before the shrink thingy. Plus, most of the time the superglue was dried up or leaked attaching everything together. It works well, but..... Pooch"
6629244,goldman,2022-01-30 02:54:00,1036,"I was thinking you put the shrink on the hook then glued your plastic to that. Guess not. I saw a you tuber fisherman wrap dental floss around the hook, then glue to that. That sounded like a PITA to me. Will try the shrink, thanks."
6629258,h8go4s,2022-01-30 05:19:00,1673,"Slide your plastic almost all the way up the hook then put a drop of super glue GEL on and finish sliding the bait up. Then drop the rig in the water. Super glue hardens in the absence of air, so it will harden in the water and you won't get it on your hands."
