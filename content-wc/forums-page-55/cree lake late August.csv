6615558,spoonchucker,2021-12-06 11:30:00,82,Will provide a full report later but want to see if I can upload pictures of some of the fish we caught on our late August trip this year to Cree Lake. Lakers in the shallows were a surprise as we were fishing for pike but they were nice to catch while casting for the pike even if not big in size.
6615652,kasmere,2021-12-06 15:37:00,20,Iv'e fished Cree twice with my brothers. One of the best fisheries in Canada. Our last trip was the second week of Sept. and we targeted the lake trout. We were not disappointed and caught many in the 30# class in 8' of water. Stayed at cree Lake Resort which is a former weather station. Not sure if still open.

I would love to fish there sometime and see if there were anything recognizable from their era there. Truly amazing how folks lived in such a harsh environment back then."

6632566,kasmere,2022-02-11 16:38:00,20,I also read North to Cree Lake. There is still remnants of the Karras cabin along the Karras River shortly after it flows out of Cree. If you get the chance to go .......GO!
