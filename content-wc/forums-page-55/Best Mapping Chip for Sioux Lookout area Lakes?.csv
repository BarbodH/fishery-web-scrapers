6629636,RLundin,2022-01-31 13:35:00,22,Wondering what everyone's experience is with mapping chips for the Sioux Lookout area lakes (Minnitaki and Abrams). Lakemaster vs Navionics vs other?
6629640,eyecatcher1,2022-01-31 14:23:00,323,I have Lowrance electronics with the Navionics North chip and they work fine for me up there. LacSeul is on their too if you're looking for a safe route to go there.

Both were great as base maps from a general navigation & depth standpoint but I did observe some maps being off by up to 400 meters, and unless you truly have a HD map I would not trust the depth other than a very general sense. I would not be without them it does make navigation easier, but until you have a bread crumb trail map I would not trust them to keep your lower unit out of the rocks."

6629882,nitroman,2022-02-01 13:30:00,368,I was just looking into this myself for our lake(cedar). Most opinions are that the available maps are poor from Lakemaster for our lake. I think I will use the Autochart Live feature this year and begin building my own map.
6630408,PRO-V16,2022-02-03 10:47:00,454,Marked travel routes are usually fairly close but the depth soundings are definitely not. I've seen rocks and trees in areas that are supposed to be 80' deep. You can go from 50' to 1' pretty fast. I mark all my own routes and fishing spots. Knock on wood I haven't hit a rock in 29 years there. My buddy that has a cabin there. Has knocked his skeg off 3 times but he has less patience and more money than I do.
