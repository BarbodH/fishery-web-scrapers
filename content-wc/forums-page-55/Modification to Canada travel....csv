6632366,prov1800,2022-02-11 04:57:00,5010,Time to find a different restaurant PJ. I have had those round things to even in the states.If memory serves me correctly both Canada/US have the round bacon on a bacon/egger at mcdonalds.Now that your in Mich.you must be a pastie fan.
6632370,pjshorthorn,2022-02-11 05:13:00,5654,When I have a sit down breakfast in Canada I order American bacon just to see what happens. What time does Sylvia's place open up ? I'll bring the real bacon..... PjShorthorn
6632376,prov1800,2022-02-11 05:25:00,5010,When having breaÄ·fast in US I order canadian back bacon.lol.We get a hog every year from a local farmer.We get the side pork sliced up and just fry that up the way it is with little salt on it rather than getting it done up.I really enjoy it that way.
6632410,NM_Trout,2022-02-11 07:59:00,1094,"Hmmmm. A contingency plan. Always good to have. Especially if this trucker roadblock thing continues! Or perhaps I fly to Fairbanks, cut through the Yukon and head south east to Ontario. Whatever it takes!(Actually, if I ever make it to the Yukon, I'll probably get as far as Dezadeash lake and that will be it)"
6632426,lmoore,2022-02-11 09:03:00,40,"My group has made the drive from Iowa up through that area every year for 30+ years (minus the last 2, of course). I myself have gone through Grand Forks up to Winnipeg 15 or so times, and I can tell you without a doubt the best part of that drive is that it's only 2 hours. Nothing to look at but grass or fields and highway for almost that entire stretch. On the bright side, that border crossing has always been a nice one with friendly border agents when we've been through (knock on wood)."
6632440,MN_Moose,2022-02-11 09:49:00,964,El Forko Grande' Kinda flat Has a cabelas for those last minute necessities. There is an air force base west of G.F. so you might see some cool birds.
6631844,NM_Trout,2022-02-09 11:00:00,1094,"Avis allows for cars to be brought into Canada. Avis generates a ""rental car proof of insurance"" card for non-residents if you let them know that you are going to Canada. My personal insurance also covers me while I am driving rental cars. They generate a special proof of insurance for me as well."
6631932,icspinner,2022-02-09 17:39:00,92,"I went on my first fishing trip to Canada in 1979, we drove from central Iowa north into Minnesota and west to North Dakota, then north to Winnipeg. I continue to maintain that the eastern part of North Dakota is the most desolate place I've ever been. Even the large desert expanses in the Southwest have more life than ND. The only saving point of that part of the trip is that we were getting to Canada via that road."
6631946,prov1800,2022-02-09 18:18:00,5010,What's weird about what we eat.
6632252,NM_Trout,2022-02-10 15:07:00,1094,"Ahhh Jeez. Now I've gone and done it. Probably will end up on a no-entry list for Canada. I'd like to officially answer ""Nothing weird at all, sir. Nothing at all."""
6632260,prov1800,2022-02-10 15:42:00,5010,Ok that's better.lol.
6632266,RichA$1970,2022-02-10 16:09:00,1159,Just try to avoid eating duck sausage on your trip
6632282,rzep,2022-02-10 16:57:00,1196,Grand Forks is couple hours east of Devils Lake ... so if something falls thru ...I would even consider going there for day or two of fishing.
6632290,pjshorthorn,2022-02-10 17:18:00,5654,"After 40 years of visiting Canada, I still don't understand why the bacon in Canada is called bacon when it is just warmed up round ham slices . Bacon is crispy strips and ham is ....just limp. PjShorthorn"
6632304,Yellowfin123,2022-02-10 18:04:00,2182,they do the same thing in england
6632356,Laketripper,2022-02-10 22:49:00,103,doesn't get much better than back bacon on a bun.
6631676,NM_Trout,2022-02-08 16:40:00,1094,"I surrendered. I was going to fly in/out of Winnipeg for my Ontario trip, but I just wasn't willing to go through the day-before testing hassle, and the risk of a false positive then getting us locked down in Canada when we needed to return to work was not going to be viable for us. We found an option with only a small amount of incremental amount of hassle. We are going to fly into Grand Fork ND, which adds a two hour drive to the trip. Ugh. However, there was some upside :Rental cars are available.We will have access to US groceries (Canadians eat the weirdest things). Will probably order in advance for curbside pickupI've never basked in the scenic splendor of northern North DakotaIn 2019, Grand Fork was listed as the worst town in ND to live. How can I pass that up in order to compare it to Albuquerque?Grand Forks was listed in the top 100 best cities to live in the US. I gotta go and see how the worst town in ND still makes the US top 100 list."
6631678,That Minnesota guy,2022-02-08 16:48:00,8293,As long as your trip is after June 1 the ice should be out this year.
6631682,prov1800,2022-02-08 17:09:00,5010,No matter what mind of winter we have here in NWO it always seems we have open water for the opener or sooner.April usually turns up the heat.
6631684,NM_Trout,2022-02-08 17:12:00,1094,"In 2007, we went during the last week in May. Froze our butts off in the morning! I was amazed how well mosquitos survived the nights."
6631714,Yellowfin123,2022-02-08 19:10:00,2182,"your playin h%ll getting to canada, grand forks? is the runway a mowed corn field? theres some huge rainbows in some of the lakes on the indian res up by chama, might save alota gray hair.."
6631718,Golden Eagle,2022-02-08 20:04:00,2642,"Although this is not Pike Central, I like arriving while 50% of a lake is covered with ice. Pike fishing can be and usually is world class during the time of change."
6631722,bthomas3333,2022-02-08 20:11:00,465,"Make sure you are permitted to take the rental car over the border. It is usually not a problem, but I think you need permission.BTW...Any good fishing in New Mexico? Looking at moving out that way.B-"
6631752,Eckohlt,2022-02-09 03:41:00,3685,"Move to Ontario,fish in your backyard."
6631772,Baseline,2022-02-09 06:31:00,3207,Also check and make sure you personal insurance company will apply in Canada.
6631836,combine_billy,2022-02-09 10:37:00,151,And you may need a Canada insurance card from your insurance company.
