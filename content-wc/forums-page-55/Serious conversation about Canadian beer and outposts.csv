6633934,Riding high,2022-02-16 09:19:00,69,Kokanee for us. It's not in all the beer stores. Or it runs out fast. I'm not a beer fan but I'll drink Kokanee. I've tried sleemans and some of the lake beers. Labatts beer and lite. You want strong beer get Labatts black ice. Not my favorite on flavor but strong. My favorite is Gibsons Finest whiskey so so good.

(Except the MegaDeath specialty one - Dave Mustaine has terrible taste in beer.)On a Walleye fisherman site no less....what has this world come to? La Fin du Monde has earned more medals and awards in major international competitions than any other Canadian beer. It is Unibroue's international flagship ale.German beers often get high praise - but NOBODY knows how to brew beer - triple brew, actually - better than the Belgian monks.La Fin du Monde is available in limited quantities in the U.S. - it's hard to find an outlet (Totally Wine & More, here in Madison's West Towne Mall) and costs around $10 for a 4-pack."
6630808,BigBadBucky2,2022-02-04 16:01:00,4,"I like Sleeman's Creamy Pale Ale. Might just be Sleeman's Pale Ale now. I don't typically drink beer (mixed drink guy), but when I do I usually like dark nitros or honey nut browns. I find Sleeman's really smooth and easy to drink. It scores out horribly though on any of the beer review sites so it might be horrible for hardcore beer aficionados, but I think many of those folks are looking for something with more hops and/or bolder in flavor and Sleemans is at other end of spectrum."

6628124,turkeyriver,2022-01-26 05:02:00,80,"Our crew of old guys grew up before light beer, IPA's, craft beers, etc. So Molson's and LaBatt's was always the go to beers. Then we tried Kokanee a few years ago and that was so drinkable, we kinda over did it so started looking for something else. I brought a case of Pilsener on our fly-in a few years ago and our outfitter said it was the first time he ever saw someone bring it, but it was one of his favorites. It has more flavor than a lighter beer. but isn't a dark beer. we really like it. So last year we saw Steam Whistle Pilsener in the Beer Store and tried that. Even more flavor and we liked it so well we bought some on the way home and it was just as good at home as it was on the lake. I'd describe these two as a lager with more flavor, give it a try."
6628596,LoDo,2022-01-27 20:01:00,721,"1000%. The IPAs are very limited on these trips due to consumption. Labatts, Kokanee and Molson is what goes to camp."

6628752,Pink Unicorn,2022-01-28 09:41:00,83,"I own an award winning brewery and my sister manages beer stores (formerly the one in red lake)... so here's my take. Labatt in bottles is superior to cans. They must make them in different facilities. We've analyzed the two and the bottles have a fuller bodied taste. If you want to browse the beer stores product line, head to their site and type in Pov for postal code. That'll grant you access to red lakes products. My sister says the Lcbo has a better craft section but no bulk pricing. If you want a case, they charge you per can x24. Beer store has a smaller selection of craft but better pricing. Check out nickelbrooks apa if you want some hops but lower ibu. Cheers!"

While we're there I like to introduce my son to some of the beers that used to be popular in the area. This year was Schlitz and Hamm's. My God those beers are nasty.

I've found that as I've gotten older, my cost per beer has gone up, but my overall quantity of consumption has gone down. Browsing ""The Beer Store"", and holy cow.

6626910,NM_Trout,2022-01-21 15:34:00,1094,"Well, crap. I might have turned into a beer snob without knowing it. Dang. I should look at the beers I like on the rating scale before my taste buds get a bad street rep. I have a very sophisticated method for beer selection. I put it in my mouth and decide if I would buy a second one. I have gotten to where I like to go to local micro brews and buy a flight of their beers. I can narrow the field pretty quickly that way.I don't do much in the way of wine tasting though. My brother in law has a sophisticated palate and a price tolerance for expensive wine. I have neither. My threshold of pain is about $15 a bottle, as I mostly think it doesn't matter. I was wrong. I went to his retirement party, and he had a wine bar set up with all kinds of weird wino apparatus to let things breath, maintain temperature, some sort of voodoo measurement. I grabbed a bottle of red wine and poured a glass and OH MY GOD that was good. I made a note of the label only to find that it was later $75 bucks a bottle. No thanks. One last note... never try really good balsamic vinegar. Like a true silver label or better Modena (sp?) That stuff will ruin you. Sort of like the first time I fished a Canadian lake. I aint never been the same."

As others mentioned, I too like the Kokanee but it is a lager. I'd call the Beer Store and ask them what beers they carry that might be more similar to your likes. I generally drink IPAs at home that are usually closer to the 7+% range in ABV. Considering the quantity that we consume in Canada, that's probably not a good idea, thus the Kokanee at 5%."
