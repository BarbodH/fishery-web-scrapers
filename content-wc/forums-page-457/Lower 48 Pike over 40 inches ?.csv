1373584,vteye,2011-12-15 11:57:00,812,Split off on other thread with most big pike coming from Canadian waters. I targeted pike this fall after finding a hot pattern. I caught 30-37 inch fish on 4 different waters with best Pike (Grand Brochet) at 39 inches a Vermont fish.
1373639,tyson2925,2011-12-15 16:00:00,95,"I caught a 44"" pike at White Iron Lake near Ely MN. This was a few years ago. There are some big pike in the boundary waters area too!"
1373717,PRD1,2011-12-15 19:47:00,458,"VERY few of them in the upper mid west. You have a much better chance of getting a plus 40 muskie. In our group we usualy end up with a half dozen +40 pike in Canada among our 8-10 fishermen. In Minnesota we catch a few decent (low to mid 30's) pike fishing muskies but the big ones are excedingly rare. The fish just doesn't get the respect it deserves, we all release all Muskies but people kill decent northerns every year. Ontario's 27.5"" to 35"" MUST be released regulation is right on target."
1373830,vteye,2011-12-16 10:49:00,812,Yep Ontario sounds right on with that slot. VT is 28 inch limit which produces a lot of 5-6 pounders before they get legal and then gets tough catching the bigger ones. VT gave up a 28 pounder couple winters ago that must have been 45+ inch fish.
1373937,keek,2011-12-16 17:59:00,1003,"I live 30 minutes from the home of the once world record northern. It came from the Great Sacadaga Lake in NY and weighted 46 pounds. There are still big ones in there. It's now the number 2 in the world if I recall, being beaten out by a pike caught in Germany. I however have never caught a pike in the lower 48 over 33"". My 33"" came last year on the ice."
1373967,vteye,2011-12-16 20:56:00,812,Yep Keek and I know of two Adirondack lakes that have 40 inch pike in them. My sons and I have taken high 30's pike on 2 out of 3 trips. No question NE might be a good spot for a 40+ US pike...
1374031,orchard frank,2011-12-17 07:51:00,1900,"Both Little and Big BaydeNoc have good pike populations, just not targeted that much. Miles of good weedlines, deep structure, etc. My guess would be that the larger ones that we catch in the spring and fall while fishing walleyes probably are in deeper water during the summer. Too much water, too big an area seems like the biggest problem."
1374600,Mike Kansas,2011-12-19 10:02:00,1463,"Haven't done much Pike fishing in lower 48. But when I was growing up in Iowa City Iowa there was a two week period in the early spring every year that I caught a lot of Pike in a small creek called Clear Creek off the Iowa river in Coralville Iowa. Never caught a 40"" but a lot of 35"" to 38"" Pike were there. Actually did a lot of sight fishing there..it was a blast for a young teenager. Mike Kansas"
