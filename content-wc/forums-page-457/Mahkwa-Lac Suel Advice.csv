1373210,mwal,2011-12-14 09:48:00,151,"Wabasha24 Yes that is a summer pattern. Except I look for giant Sand structure also and rip jigging weed lines on calm hot days. Some of our highest fish counts have been aggressively jigging plastics on shallow sand with weeds. Look for large sandy hillside above the water on islands, points etc. Mwal"
1372658,wabasha24,2011-12-12 16:41:00,12,Been up there 3 or 4 imes but I have a question 4 the those that know the body of water better than i do. I have the option to go the first week of July or toward the end of July.When is the best time to hit it up there. Would one time be better than the other.
1372685,mwal,2011-12-12 17:46:00,151,I have gone 1st week of July 5 times and Late September once. We have had good trips each time just depends if the fish have moved to summer haunts etc. It is all according to weather which is not predictable a year in advance. If you have the skill set to jig and troll bottom bouncers you will find a pattern. Mwal
1372764,JDP,2011-12-12 22:14:00,1457,"As a Walleye fisherman If I had your choice I would go toward the end of July. The Walleyes will be solidly in their summer pattern. I also believe the weather is more stable later in July than early July. I have been in some unbelieveable thunder storms over the years.A truly sad, unbelieveable and only time ever happening story; On July 9th, 2009 there was a tornado that killed 2 people on Lac Seul. I remember this because I for years went Lac Seul either the first or second week of July.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manito...-manitoba.html"
1372794,wabasha24,2011-12-13 05:52:00,12,"so does the summer pattern up there consist of working mid lake structure, and jig fishing off of points and islands in roughly 17 to 25 fow?I assume the fish move from the shallow spring pattern into the main part of the lake a bit more."
1372869,tv4fish,2011-12-13 09:13:00,2694,Wabasha: My group has been going to Lac Seul over the last week of June/first week of July for over 10 years. The depth that we have found fish varies considerably. We DO work wind-blown points. We have found nice-sized walleyes anywhere from 4-16 feet that time of year. We just start shallow and gradually slide out until we find them. Don't think you can corelate a certain depth with a set time of year - it's going to vary.
1372881,Mike Kansas,2011-12-13 09:40:00,1463,tv4fish is right on the money here. Lac Seul is such a great fishery with a high population of Walleye it allows the fisherman to catch Eyes in all depths around July 1st. Towards the end of July the fish have a tendency to be a little deeper but you can still catch a lot of fish in shallows on points. The shallow point fishing late in the year depends a great deal on the wind. A nice steady wind provides a smorgasbord of bait on the shallow points and the Eyes love to eat as we all know.

1372922,Pooch,2011-12-13 10:54:00,4619,"https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...php?albumid=16My album page has some pictures on the first page of my boat partners and just regular fish from last falls Labor Day trip to Lac Seul. Almost all fish came out of twenty to thirty foot of water, even the small mouth. The fish were at all depths, but in general deeper than past years.Every year is different. Last summer, even the end of June we were catching fish as deep as thirty five foot. Didn't like it, but that's where they were.Pooch"
1373080,wabasha24,2011-12-13 21:08:00,12,"Many of you probably think it is strange to be talking about Canada in July now, but I really don't ice fish. Therefore, it is my therapy during the winter to map out and plan my big open water trips during the downtime.Another big question for you Lac Suel and Mahkwa vets. If we end up going the third week of July - would it even be worth working Bray Bay/Bray lake and Vaughn lake? Correct me if i am wrong, but I assume our time would be better spent in the bigger open water basins working wind blown points, islands, and reefs/bumps. Areas like Pauli Light, pine pt, Angilcan mission, Dominion Islands, etc.I will basically be guiding 5 of my closest friends for a week. If you know the Mahkwa area well and are willing to share some info. or go to spots for mid to late July, please pm me."
1373153,Mike Kansas,2011-12-14 07:59:00,1463,"Bray can be great that time of year. We have fished it late in the year many times and the most effective for us was to drag bottom bouncers with large minnow along the edges of deep sunken islands in Bray. Great time to hook up on some large eyes. We got one there late in the year that was 34"" and have had many 28""to 30"" Eyes. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1373206,Pooch,2011-12-14 09:40:00,4619,"Vaughn is a waste of time over the Labor Day time period. Has been that way for years for us. Too much good fishing on the main lake to waste valuable trip time.That said, more experienced LS buddies have fished Vaughn early in the year and did well.Pooch"
