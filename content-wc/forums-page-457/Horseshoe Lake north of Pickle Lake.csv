1376839,Fishoil,2011-12-28 07:36:00,1277,I'm looking for someone who has fished this lake and can answer a few questions about it for me. I've been fishing the Pickle Lake area for many years but have never been to this particular lake. I'm planning a July trip with my 2 daughters and would like to know what to expect as far as current and rocks in the river on the way up. It would also be very helpful to know the location of islands that are campsite ready. Thank you in advance to anyone that can help he out.
1377859,Lonefisherman,2012-01-01 07:06:00,13,We camped there many years ago and only fished the river part. Caught some Walleyes but where small. It was in June if I remember. Am sure there are nice walleyes in the lake but just did not get the chance to fish the lake part.We only used jigs with curly tails only and no live bait. The group I was with where not that interested that much in the walleyes as I was and that is why I did not get the chance to fish the lake. If you go I wish you the best of luck and hope you have fun.
