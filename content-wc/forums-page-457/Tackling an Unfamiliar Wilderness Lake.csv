Underwater points you can find on your depthfinder. Fish the points shallow to deep or side to side till you find the depth the Walleye are at. I mainly just jig fish but trolling would also work. I mark the point with a bouy Marker so I have a reference point. Just seem to be gathering areas where the fish can go up and down in deoth. Sometimes they won't be on the points , but if you can find a point on the drop off at the depth the fish are, the fishing can be insane!! Just my 2 cents worth. HAPPY NEW YEAR ALL YOU WC'ers"

1378620,Thunderbucket,2012-01-02 23:33:00,323,"Points, humps, rock piles, drop offs, sandy gravel shoreline. Side imaging is your new best friend. Can't go wrong with hot n tots, bottom bouncing, or crawler spinner harnesses troll troll troll"

1377427,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-12-30 09:36:00,235,"You arrrive at a fly in or hike in wilderness lake that isn't well mapped. You have a boat, a depth finder and your fishing tackle. You want to catch walleyes. What would you look for in terms of spots to try and methods to use to catch fish?"
1377438,keek,2011-12-30 10:12:00,1003,"I'd look for weeds and/or depth changes on the sonar while simultaneously slowly trolling a 4"" Rattlin Rouge. Once I found some interesting structure or fish on the graph I would fan cast a crankbait or jig back to the boat. If fish were found on the bottom I would start jigging with something."
1377458,Fishoil,2011-12-30 11:09:00,1277,"The first thing I'd look for is in or out flowing water, current equals walleyes up there. Next I'd look for structure if it was early in the year or weeds later in the year. Structure would be points, islands, or changes in bottom content along a shoreline. You can get a good idea of whats beneath the water by studying what the adjacent shoreline looks like. If it slopes up sharply then the bottom probably drops off quickly from the shoreline outward. If there's big boulders on shore there will be more in the adjacant water, etc. If the weed growth is good I'd check out the outside edges of weedlines and even inside of the weeds a bit. Depths can vary depending on water clarity. Early in the season you might find walleyes in as little as a couple of feet and later as deep as 12'-20', even deeper if the water is very clear. I'd do all this while pitching a jig with a minnow or plastic tail. You could also try trolling along shorelines with a crankbait until you find some active fish, then stop and work them over with jigs. All of this could be done without the aid of any electronics but a depth finder would make it much easier."

1377684,Bill Krejca,2011-12-31 07:21:00,6107,"Time of the year is an important factor. Disregarding that, and assuming there is not flowing water coming in....or going out, I'd fish the area where the wind is blowing into. Bill Krejca"
1377710,jow,2011-12-31 09:04:00,20,Right onrarely get skunked fishing a wind blown line
1377713,NathanH,2011-12-31 09:08:00,697,I would always look at the shoreline looking for areas with steep slopes. You can always count on whatever is happening on sure will continue into the lake so you should find drop offs.
1377738,v-bay gord,2011-12-31 10:51:00,3168,I would definately try trolling Rapala Taildancers to locate fish...all the while paying attention to my locator for structure and fish that I may want to go back to.......I suppose start shallow (in the wind blown areas as suggested) and work my way out into deeper water if need be. Time of year would give you a better idea of possible depth ranges to check out first.
1377877,retire55,2012-01-01 08:00:00,1029,"Another vote for trying wind blown shorelines first. Since I'm biased towards back trolling, I'd try bottom bouncing harnesses with crawlers or leeches first and then try trolling crank baits. If that wasn't successful, I'd next try fishing structure (points, mid lake humps, transitions). Then I'd have a nap, have some supper and then pick a spot to vertically jig for the night bite. The nice thing is that experimentation starts all over the next morning."
