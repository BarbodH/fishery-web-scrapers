1377801,Mikep007,2011-12-31 20:36:00,77,Checking out 2012 options and was wondering if anyone has feedback on Wolseley Lodge on Welseley Bay/French River? Thanks in advance!
1377992,FrankLeigh,2012-01-01 12:14:00,80,"Ten of us stayed there for three days in July of 2007. It was a reunion weekend, not a serious fishing trip. Our cabins were nice, one of them either new, or recently renovated. The lodge was also very nice and although we did not eat there, other guests told us that the food was good. This is not a wilderness location and is more of a family destination. There are several other camps/lodges along the river.The boats and motors were new or almost new. The only complaint was that the Mercury outboards were the models with the forward/reverse built ino the tiller handle, an annoying feature.We did find some smallmouth and pike and missed a big muskie, but no walleye. Again it was not a serious trip, more socializing and catching up. However, I know a couple of guys who fish there every year in May, the week after the opening for walleye.Maybe, not much help to you."

1378073,adempsey,2012-01-01 16:16:00,963,"Wolesley Lodge is a decent enough place. They have both housekeeping and American Plan available. The rates were reasonable from my recollection. Like Frank mentioned, it's not a ""wilderness"" location. The cabin we stayed at is right at the end of the road and parking lot. So, there isn't much green space. However, the river itself is beautiful once you enter the provincial park, which is not that far from the lodge. If you do stay at Wolesley Lodge, make sure to double check your bill I also stayed at Bryers Lodge a bit further down from Wolesley last fall. Nice place and decent rates. Not as big as Wolesley lodge and there are fewer boats to rent. The accommodations at Bryer were far superior though.There is also Crane's Lochaven Lodge as well. It's a boat-in American Plan lodge that seems to be somewhat popular. I have never stayed there, only fished near it. However, I'd recommend checking out the lodges on the lower French. There are several boat-in lodges that are popular such as Bear's Den Lodge and French River Lodge.I am hoping that my next fall trip [which is only a weekender] will be to Flat Rapids Camp.Good luck!"
1378329,FrankLeigh,2012-01-02 10:33:00,80,"Hey Mike, you didn't say what you were looking for. We used to fish the Bad River sectiion of the French, and the shore of Geogian Bay in the '90's until '02 or '03 when both of the camps where we used to stay were sold and became private. I don't think that any other camps have access below the rapids to Georgian Bay.At that time,the fishing for walleye and pike was great with the occasional muskie and salmon, but the walleye fishing dropped off with the water level in Georgian Bay and the invasion of the Zebra mussels.Also, you should check the regulations for the different areas in the river and the delta.We also fished out of French River Lodge, ('04 ?), another nice spot, with access to a lot of area, but with limited success.If you want to PM me, I can provide more info on the French."
1378481,Guest,2012-01-02 16:48:00,0,Mike you may not want this kind of input but I would suggest that you do some research in terms of the status of the walleye fishery on the French River before booking your stay. Most people that use this site tend to be interested in finding the best fishing options so I assume you would fall into that category. Lots of information is available regarding the results of angler surveys and netting on the French. Intensive fishery with relatively low catch rates. I would advise you to drive an extra half a day and enjoy far better fishing. If you intend to fish for a whole week it only makes sense to spend a little bit of extra time driving to enjoy far better fishing as opposed to struggling every day during your stay. The walleye fishing in Ontario gets better as you go west and that information is available in MNR walleye netting summaries if you do the search. If you get west of Wawa it just keeps getting better. If you do a quick scan of the best drive-to walleye fisheries in Ontario I don't think you will find anyone listing the French.
1378778,Mikep007,2012-01-03 11:53:00,77,"JustSayin, I appreciate your candor, thank you! I've always heard that NW Ontario was the best location (even did a flyin with Wilderness Air out of Armstrong one year) -- with International Falls a 17 hour drive from Columbus, Ohio, we've just never had the appetite for that kind of travel. But maybe this is the year, just add two more days onto the trip and do it. Any ideas for an American Plan lodge with good boats within a few hours of Internation falls? Will check this board and other but if you have an idea off the top of your head, I'd appreciate it! All the best!"
1378799,prov1900,2012-01-03 12:45:00,544,"A few hours from I-Falls gives you a lot of options. Lac Seul, Minnitaki, and Eagle would take about 3 hours. Rainy Lake is right there in I-Falls, with the Canadian side just minutes away. I haven't fished Eagle, but would highly recommend Minnitaki or Lac Seul. I have only fished Rainy for a few hours so couldn't give you an honest recommendation, but from what I hear, it is worth the effort to get to it."
1378970,adempsey,2012-01-03 19:48:00,963,"My experiences on the French are only in the fall when I am musky fishing - although, my success has been limited - so I can't comment on the walleye fishery. One of the boat-in resorts on Lady Evelyn Lake might be a good compromise for your group if you are looking for good walleye fishing without adding a lot of additional driving time. Lady Evelyn lake is about 3 hours north of the Upper French. The fishing probably won't be the same as many of the fly-in lakes, but it's the next best thing.edit: I just realized that you have much better options if you're coming from Columbus, Ohio. The drive time to the Wawa/White River/Hornepayne area is about the same as to the Upper French River and you have a lot of options in that area."
1378982,Guest,2012-01-03 20:30:00,0,"Mike, I would agree with a number of the suggestions made by ProV. The south arm of Rainy has awesome smallmouth and very big walleye. The Canadian side has very strict limits and a slot size for walleye that have greatly improved the fishery. There is very little in the way of development there too. Probably not the same catch rates as some of the lakes a little bit farther north but a good option because of the potential to land very large walleye. Can't go wrong with Lac Seul but I would avoid the Ear Falls side. Central and eastern portions of Lac Seul are better for numbers and size of walleye. In my opinion Lac Seul has the best combination of size and numbers in any drive to walleye fishery. Tons of great options in the Ignace area if you are fishing the English River system - can be a cheap option but most of the resorts are a little ""rustic."" Most of the Ignace area resorts involve trailering to lakes but that adds good variety."
