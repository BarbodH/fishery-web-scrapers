1376969,Catman59,2011-12-28 17:26:00,345,We drank (stained) water from Sturgeon for many years. They have only had a well for maybe 3 years . I never even gave a thought to getting sick. To this day - the camp owners son makes his coffee from lake water instead of well water
1374664,new hips,2011-12-19 14:13:00,498,"Last year we boiled the water, and ran it thru a filter (from Walmart for $15) this was the first year we have done this. I figured it was cheap insurance, as we are not getting any younger. It worked great and will be taking it each year from now on."

1376456,freespoolin,2011-12-26 17:30:00,472,"My father and his buddies (except for one) always drank lake water. One time while fishing on a very hot day, the holdout decided to drink from the river. He emptied the cup several times and finally took a drink. As they trolled upriver around a bend, they met a floating dead moose... The first and last time for Wilf to drink from a river..."
1376495,v-bay gord,2011-12-26 21:29:00,3168,"Can't say for the product you are talking about, but I do know that bigger UV systems need a minimal level of water clarity to work properly......and a water that is stained past as certain clarity can cause it to shut down. So I guess it is likely that stained water will affect the performance."
1376503,tackleman,2011-12-26 22:26:00,444,"we drink our water from gullrock, all we do is run it through a course 30micron filter to keep the sediment out. I been doing this over 20 years every day and have't got sick yet.that being said, when i worked up north (yes there are places further north than gullrock) I would get the trots sometimes from different lake waters. (this was over 30 years ago and modern water treatments weren't available) . if you've ever been on gullrock, you will know it is fairly stained water but when it comes into the glass from the tap it appears clear. (now a bathtub full is a different story). as vbay gord will tell you, eagle lake is really clean water but i've gotten the trots from it too. so you gotta be careful."
1376506,rickn,2011-12-27 00:39:00,993,"Given that everyone pees in the lakes, and some crap in them, drinking from them isn't an option for me."
1376509,Ogoki,2011-12-27 05:01:00,291,"We use a ""bag type"" filter called a Katadyn Base Camp. You can fill it with just over a gallon of water and hang it off of the handle . Has a hose about 5 ft long and I left it filter into a plastic jug that we bring with us . Sells for $59 to $69 at Gander Mountain , Cabelas , Campmor etc. Works great and we have never has an issue with using water from it . My friends use one also and love it . We take it on fly-in trips and canoe trips ."
1376686,v-bay gord,2011-12-27 15:34:00,3168,"Tackleman....you need to be cautious about using a filter as your only source of ""treatment"". A filter will naturally collect particles it is designed to trap. It is also a great spot to have bacteria collect and grow. That's why chlorination or a UV light is an important part of a treatment system. Besides, a 30 micron filter is only removing the big chunks....spores that will give you the ""beaver fever"" need a 1 micron filter to remove them, or the UV light to neutralize them."
1376688,Pikeslayer8,2011-12-27 15:45:00,1460,"There is a sign posted in my camp that says ""Please boil water for at least 10 minutes before being consumed"".We always say that if the bear comes, put on a pot of boiling water."

1372572,wallydave,2011-12-12 12:46:00,2151,"We like our drive-in camp because we don't have to worry about how much we can bring to camp. So we take plenty of water along. The camp we stay at on Lac Seul, brings water from the lake. The first year I went up North, we made some ice for our coolers, seeing the brown stuff in the water let me know I will keep bringing water along mostly for the morning coffee... I better stop now before this turns into a beer thread!"
1372825,northernbite,2011-12-13 07:37:00,1186,"Anything we cook with water, pasta, coffee and boil potatoes we take from lake. I freeze 1 gallon milk jugs and use for cooler and then drink for water add lemon at time of freezing. Dish water from lake boil and add clorox in rinse water. It has worked the last 22 years, this is a boat to island tent camp.Merry Christmas,Paul"
1373113,F250,2011-12-14 05:52:00,75,"I have had Giardia twice. Once after drinking untreated water from a northern Quebec lake in the mid 1980's and again after drinking untreated water from a northern Saskatchewan lake in the late 1990's. We now, always, either boil the water or haul it from a safe source."
1373118,jigngrub,2011-12-14 06:26:00,304,Just one dose of Dysentery will cure you from ever drinking untreated water again.
1373124,lassh,2011-12-14 06:50:00,553,"Does anyone know if you can contract Giardia from using untreated lake water that comes from an under water source, goes through a rough filter and water heater and the dishes are dried? I know its caused by a protezoan but don't know how well the critters survive in hot dish water then dried dishes. How about from brushing teeth and rinsing with water from faucet with deep lake source? By the way it can be transmitted person to person. So if you are ever on a trip where someone has it make sure that the person with it thoroughly washes their hands after bathroom trips etc. Its an intestinal parasite that comes from beaver poo and the like. Its more prevalent in surface water and stagnent areas so if your going to dip a drink from lake, make sure you dip it deep and away from stagnent areas."
1373147,Blackmacs,2011-12-14 07:54:00,2121,All you want to know about Montezuma's revenge: http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/giardia/ And yes you can get it from well water or even filtered water if the filter medium isn't small enough.
1373373,Bluff,2011-12-14 18:28:00,152,"10-4 jigngrub.... gung ho until you get really sick once. Could be water you drank for years, brushed your teeth or made coffee - doesn't matter. When you get it you never forget it and you filter everything. Maybe a moose died in the area or a wolf took a dump - conditions can change. And it is miserable."
1374248,GWC,2011-12-18 05:32:00,1021,I wouldn't recommend drink the water from any lake or stream that's untreated in Canada or else where. Could really spoil a fishing or hunting trip.

1372384,Jiggin the Point,2011-12-11 20:10:00,24,"I was just thinking the other day when, when our father took us yearly to Quebec camping and fishing in the Waswanipi area, back in the mid 70's, we never took any water and always just drank from the lake. We didn't boil it or treat it any way. I wonder now if we were lucky or if it was just as clean as I remember it. If i remember correctly the outfitter where left our vehicles had a certificate of clean water for the lake??? Just wondering if anyone did the same and what were the ....results"
1372423,ohiojmj,2011-12-12 05:46:00,1262,"Drank from lakes and streams in remote places in Ontario, NY, PA, in the seventies, and don't recall getting sick. From what i know today, we were lucky. Started using water filters when the technoclogy became available at reaosnable price to avoid bacteria induced disasters in the mountains or on the water."
1372426,Shellback,2011-12-12 06:08:00,8083,"I think a lot of these food and water borne illnesses today are the result people not having built up immunity against them. Back in the day, we did drink from streams and probably ate foods that had bacteria on them. Thus we built up immunity. Now a days people don't have that immunity and are susceptible to all these sicknesses we never heard of before."
1372430,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2011-12-12 06:52:00,629,"Back in the early to mid 60's, our Boy Scout group made 4 trips into the ""Boundry Waters"" & we always used the lake water for drinking & cooking. Can't recall of anyone suffering from the experience. Todays trips, I understand, one must register & possibly be on a waiting list to get in. We went where we wanted, when we wanted. I blame the experience for my love of the outdoors & particular the wilderness of Minnesota & Ontario. Set the Hook, CRJohn"
1372437,Paul H,2011-12-12 07:35:00,1232,"Way back, I also drink the water. When Giardia (beaver fever) started to be more prevalent is when I quit. Camp I stayed at was also required to post a notice regarding the water."
1372446,Bill Krejca,2011-12-12 07:53:00,6107,"Most of us who have been on the lakes over the years have drank right from a cup in the boat. Some camp boats used to be equipped, with, along with a pair of oars and a paddle, a cup for it's users. Many camps used to get their water supply directly from the lake without filters in place. I still remember the story of Clark Gable's houseboat anchoring in the bay at Turtle Portage, LOW. Someone threw some unwanted items into the water. The manager of Turtle Portage Camp had to remind the folks on the houseboat that the camp's water came directly from the lake, via a pipe that ran from the main cabin right in to the bay. It is interesting that, of the literally thousands of lake drinkers, very little has ""surfaced"" over the years about detrimental effects from same. Other than the beaver fever, or whatever, which became know some years ago. All being said, it probably is not the wisest thing to do today. Bill Krejca"

We spent our childhood scooping poop from our livestock, walked barefoot in everything imaginable, swam in the same creek that the cattle used. About killed each other in the haymow. Etc..No doubt in my mind that we are more tolerant of bacteria than most of my friends. Especially the younger ones. They seem to be ""allergic"" to everything. Everyone is constantly using the bacteria hand lotion bottle.Don't get me wrong because I (too) use those little dispensers when in public. Handles on grocery carts give me the ""willies""!Some of the fly-in camps we go to draw drinking water from the lake then just run it through a filter that I'm sure only removes the ""big chunks"". We did start carrying a screw on filter for the sink at these camps. Since it slows the water flow down to a trickle we fill a gallon jug and keep it in the fridge for drinking. Even before we did this we've never had anyone get ill on a trip.Take a filter if you are concerned.Pooch"
1372509,HeHooksHimself,2011-12-12 10:30:00,725,Drank from a beautiful Colorado Stream in the early 80's and came home with Giardia. I still have residual effects. My stomach growls loud and frequently. Filter and be sure.
