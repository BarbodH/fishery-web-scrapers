1374679,jambi,2011-12-19 15:05:00,504,"Found myself with 10 times too much this year. Next year trimming way back on the tackle. Did that with clothes prior now its time to cut back on the lures, especially pike stuff. We portaged every day and trimmed our boxes down each day to lessen the load."
1374688,Larry Mac,2011-12-19 15:42:00,530,"Hi Jambi, You are a very smart man. We have made it a personal challenge each year to travel as light as possible. Planning, preparing and packing is part of our enjoyment. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1374743,djarz929,2011-12-19 19:03:00,40,You said it Larry! After 30 plus trips I still take too much tackle......but it's hard to make BassPro or Cabela's drop off that midweek order to the outpost!

1374777,keek,2011-12-19 21:05:00,1003,Thanks guys. -Here is another question- How many jigs do you expect to lose a day on fly-ins using super-lines? My last 2 Quebec trips involved very little jigging - mostly crankbaits and harnesses.
1374897,oleJoe,2011-12-20 10:19:00,114,I started out at about 10# of fishing gear and now up to 14# and still to much. I usually take about 50 to 60 jigs and if i start to run short I start fishing different. Have never run out but if you fish swift water up stream you will lose a ton. They will usually hit on most baits. We always take a few new ones but they hit just like the old ones. Enjoy your trip
1375225,jambi,2011-12-21 08:07:00,504,Hi Larry... I've bought way too much crap recently. But those shiny new lures are so hard to resist! My winter project is to go through and get rid of alot of old stuff that I haven't thrown in years. Most of that is pike gear; I bet I have 15 dardevles that dont have much paint on them..
1374465,keek,2011-12-18 18:54:00,1003,"You've got a 110 pound limit, heading to Lac Hebert in Quebec in early July for Walleye and Pike. How much of your 110 pounds is tackle? Not counting rod,reels or bait just things like jigs, cranks, bouncers, etc. thanks"
1374469,trapperbob,2011-12-18 19:16:00,45,"We have traveled with tamarac before but not to hebert lake. Over the years we have slowly reduced the amount of lures jigs spinners etc. Should be less than 10 lbs for 2 guys, not including reels and rods. Have you been to lake hebert before? We are thinking of going there next year in June. Happy Holidays."
1374475,keek,2011-12-18 19:38:00,1003,"First time to Hebert and first fly-in. My last two years to Quebec were at a drive-in and weight wasn't an issue. I brought way too much stuff but one of those ""one more things"" thrown in the truck at the last minute really made a huge difference for us in catching fish."
1374476,unclepaully,2011-12-18 19:42:00,112,"I went on my first fly-in last year and found that I had way too much tackle. Brought two boxes and only used a 1/4 of the lures and settled on a handful after the second day. Next time we fly in I will consult a few who have fished that particular body of water and limit my tackle to a few of their recommendations, along with plenty of plastics which won't add that much weight."
1374536,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2011-12-19 07:32:00,5533,Not sure where you are going. However most of my Canadian experiences have been that the fish would eat a rock if you gave it motion. They just don't see a lot of presentations and it doesn't appear a person needs all that tackle up there.
1374546,wallydave,2011-12-19 07:51:00,2151,"For my fly-in trip a bought a small soft-sided tackle box, scaled-down my jigs and lures. Next pack light, grabbed the scale when my wife wasn't looking and weighed everything, scaled back somemore. Weigh your supplies and go from there! Most fly-ins will have a suggested list, check your gear and supplies to the list and go from there! Planning and working your plan, making adjustments are all part of the total fishing trip excitement! Good luck and let us know how it went!"
1374549,Larry Mac,2011-12-19 08:05:00,530,"Hi Keek, My Tackle Bag weighs 10 lbs and I have everything I need for Walleye, Northern and Perch (it is still to much LOL). Have a great yearP.S. that equips (2) guysThank you,Larry Mac"
1374552,dhottle,2011-12-19 08:18:00,163,I take about 11lbs of tackle on a week fly-in trip for pike & lake trout. That is usually two or three plano boxes excluding reels & travel rods.
1374658,Moosebunk,2011-12-19 13:47:00,211,"Historically, about 25-30 lbs covers tackle, rods and reels."
1374662,new hips,2011-12-19 14:05:00,498,"1 large hanging bait box, 4 reels and small locator with battery, rain wear and boots, bottom bouncers and weights usually adds up to 35 lbs. It adds up in a hurry, I usually cut back on clothes if you dress in layers."
