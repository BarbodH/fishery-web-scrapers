I'm guessing that since most of the guys on this board are ""diehards"" that they rarely use a guide.Last year we saw only a couple of Mawkwa's camp boats with two fisherman and a guide in them. They pulled into where we were fishing so we left shortly after. They weren't bothering us though and everyone was catching fish.I was curious about what kind of answers you would get.Maybe this reply to your post will jog someone's memory.Pooch"

We did see them from time to time but never followed them they fished some of they spots we new and then would disappear. Fishing in that part of Suel is doable without a guide is your are experienced. If not experienced a guide is very beneficial. Mwal
