Still keep your eyes open though, lots of deer, moose, bears etc. If your lucky you'll even see some cougars chasing rabbits, lol. One good thing about the 502 is the traffic is very helpful should you break down or something. You won't have vehicles zipping by as you sit on the side of the road, which is a plus."
1363331,NARDA 1,2011-11-07 07:46:00,636,I spoke with the cellular provider for that area (DMTS) this past summer and was told that they have no plans to provide service for the 502. They have added towers to the 71 and 17. nm
1364196,Robert Cardenas,2011-11-10 12:37:00,138,"Cell phone coverage does exist, just don't use it while there is a cop behind you. If you do It will cost you $150.00!!! No cell phones while driving!"
1372359,Guest,2011-12-11 17:21:00,0,"Just remember on the 502 that there is alot of trucks. Whether hauling logs, chips or otherwise. Just give them a wide berth. If they are following you let them by. Those boys are out making money and your on vacation. Use common sense and you'll be fine. Legal length in ONT is 75 feet and hauling a boat and trailer is perfectly legal. Just make sure that you are ready for the trip and fill up in Fort. No gas no services for a few miles for sure."
1372368,bellbuoy,2011-12-11 18:20:00,490,I pulled mine to Separation Lake Campground north of Kenora.
1361368,duffer9,2011-10-29 01:38:00,2,"just curious if anyone has pulled a fifth wheel camper and boat into Canada, or if it is even legal??. Wondering about the road from I-Falls to Dryden specificaly?Thanks!"
1361378,tv4fish,2011-10-29 05:56:00,2694,"duffer: I think we have seen a number of these ""tandem"" rigs on the roads up there. Also - the roads from I-Falls to Dryden have been ""improved"" over the last few years, so I wouldn't worry about them. What I WOULD worry about -- if you're planning to drive at night -- is how to avoid those large 4-legged things and the stopping distance required to avoid THEM."
1361498,bigwalleye1,2011-10-29 20:20:00,2632,"I, too, have seen the fifth wheel boat combos, and agree with TV re: both the roads and the critters. The only advice I would offer is bring a couple sets of reflective triangles, and be prepared to send the passengers up and down the road to spread them out in the event of a flat. The shoulders are non-existent. The ditch starts at the fog line, and you'll likely never be lucky enough to have a flat near one of the ""pulp check"" wide spots. Invest in a power inverter and an electric impact wrench, and carry a bottle jack and a couple blocks and a big extension cord (read 12 guage). Those tools will make a change faster if you need it, and get you off the road and back in the vehicle. The big trucks will either be very reasonable and slow down and give you a wide berth, or they'll blow your socks off passing you, seems like there's no inbetween. Plan ahead, travel in daylight, and you'll be OK."
1361747,Mike Kansas,2011-10-31 08:51:00,1463,"Heed the warning about traveling only in the daylight. The road is in excellent condition but like others have said the shoulders are small and the ditchs deep and the Moose are big and can ruin a trip in a heartbeat. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1361850,hogridnfool,2011-10-31 16:09:00,349,Here are some Canadian regulations....http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/pub...hicle-info.pdf
1361920,Jiggin the Point,2011-10-31 20:51:00,24,"I to have seen quite a number of rigs in Quebec, the last one was coming towards me. He had a flat on the boat trailer and it had been flat for a while..not a pretty sight, and there was no way I ever could have turned around and flagged him down...at least he was headed south!"
1361963,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2011-11-01 07:03:00,629,"Just a quick comment in support of what ""Mike Kansas & Bigwalleye1"" have suggested about the trip from I'falls to Dryden.I have made the trip 4 times with only a boat during daylight, & theyare giving you the best advice possible for the trip. No shoulders for mile after mile & very desolite. With your proposal, daylight is the only way to travel that stretch. Set the Hook, CRJohn"
1361965,duffer9,2011-11-01 07:10:00,2,Thanks for all the information and suggestions. I am bringing the whole family this year and camping will make it an affordable adventure if nothing else....Thanks again.
1361971,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2011-11-01 07:32:00,5533,In MN the legal length for that rig is 70'. You legally cannot exceed that total length.
1362800,Calvin Svihel,2011-11-04 08:49:00,95,"I am lucky enough to have my in laws live in Dryden, so I am on 502 at least 3 times if not 4 times a year. I always travel 502 during the daylight. I travelled once after dark came to close to 3 different moose encounters that I won't travel it again during the night. All of the previous posts are excellent comments about the shoulder size, be prepared for anything while traveling that road. If you have satelitte radio, look into using your satelitte phone in an absolute emergency. Cell phone coverage doesn't exist now on 502, but I do see a few towers starting to be built. Have a safe/fun travels."
