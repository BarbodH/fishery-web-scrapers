They are fairly decent cabins.Does anyone have pictures to share of the inside and outside of the smaller cabins on the housekeeping side? I'm thinking about taking my wife next year and don't want to end up in a mouse infested dive. The smaller cabins don't appear to be very nice from the outside.Thanks,Pooch[email protected]"
1374135,jheimsch,2011-12-17 16:08:00,38,"Pooch, We talked on another subject. I would like to take my wife for a few days also. I would like to stay on the American Plan side. I have the same worries as I may want her to come back another time. My sons and I don't care about the cabins only the fishing. I will let you know if I learn anything. John"
1374949,mwal,2011-12-20 12:41:00,151,I have only stayed on American plan side. The cabins are decent. They were cleaned daily while we were out fishing. We could watch TV or DVD in the Rec center. We also played some TX hold em. I did visit a group in an older cabin on the other side and would not bring my wife there. As it was clean but to rustic for her. Moss chinking in between logs etc. Would not hesitate on other side. Mwal

However I have not been there in about 4 years and they may have been improved. The housekeeping cabins were fine for the ""guys"" just not the commander in chief. I've heard the American plan cabins are nice"
1377251,Rodney Bondele,2011-12-29 17:16:00,73,I agree with redcedarguy. A couple newer cabins have been built. Not sure what it would take to get a new one.Rodney Bondele
1377297,Pooch,2011-12-29 19:27:00,4619,I've only seen one new cabin last year. It was used by the folks that work there. Replacing the old cabins would be a very big plus for the camp.The other camps we frequent are getting more and more married couples each year. Plus mixed groups of married couples and families with a couple generations. Many years ago it was mostly just bunch of guys going fishing.Pooch
