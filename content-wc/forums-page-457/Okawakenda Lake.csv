1378396,FrankLeigh,2012-01-02 12:28:00,80,"There are many camps in this area and east of Shining Tree to Gowganda. Some have boats on remote lakes. The top map for Okawakenda shows at least one building on the lake, but it could be an old mine or trapper's cabin. Check www.shiningtree.com for a list of camps. We used to fish this area a lot. If I can be of further assistance, PM me."

1378714,jow,2012-01-03 09:48:00,20,That one building is actually a private camp.
1378860,indydan,2012-01-03 15:07:00,2,Thanks for the info. I have stayed at Ronda Camp but they didn't have a boat on Okawakenda at that time.
