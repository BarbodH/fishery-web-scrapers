1375919,v-bay gord,2011-12-23 16:00:00,3168,"I know of no minnows being sold in our area of NW Ontario that are coming from Lake Nipissing. I hardly ever see shiner minnows.....good thing too, they die way too easy when it's warm."
1375922,JDP,2011-12-23 16:15:00,1457,"Exactly what I thought, can't recall seeing shiner minnows on my visits toFort Frances, Dryden, Vermilion, Ear Falls bait shops."
1375938,Guest,2011-12-23 17:37:00,0,"Curryale, you are not well informed when it comes to the source of bait in NW Ontario. The baitfish industry from Ignace to the Kenora (Manitoba/Ont border) is VERY large. Most of the largest baitfish harvesters are using float planes to harvest bait in remote bog lakes. There is no shortage of bait available locally. Some minor shortages in the hottest part of the summer but that is it. No minnows are making the 20 hr drive up here from Lake Simcoe. The shiners coming from Lake Simcoe (which is a VHS zone) are emerald shiners. Too far to drive and nobody would want them anyhow. There are some very large runs of emerald shiners entering the Rainy River from Lake of the Woods but there is a limited market for these shiners. Dace and fathead minnows are the bait of choice in the NW."
1375996,GNO,2011-12-24 06:27:00,153,The other thing to remember is that is illegal for NR to trap minnows in Ontario
1376042,Curryale,2011-12-24 08:55:00,50,Well to be fair I did not limit my comments to the area between Kenora and Ignace. I am happy to hear of the excellent system in place in NW ontario of trapping minnows in bogs using float planes as that will keep the VHS out of the local watersheds. On the issue of shiners I have spoken directly with individuals who work with the MNR in North Eastern Ontario. Admittedly they do not work as far west as as Ignace or Kenora. I am told that many of the shiner minnows that were being sold thoughout those areas in Northern Ontario were coming from Lake Simcoe.Maybe they are incorrect but I know of no reason for them not to be honest about it with me. I know of no minnows being trapped and sold from Lake Nippising. I have no idea where the Dace and Fathead minnows are coming from in NW ontario.
1375691,Pikeslayer8,2011-12-22 16:51:00,1460,Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia (VHS) is encroaching further north. I'm guessing it will affect all of us soon in one way or another. Minnows and shiners will probably be untransportable to some of our lakes in NW Ontario. http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_166029.html
1375734,Guest,2011-12-22 20:27:00,0,"Not trying to be rude but do you realize how big Ontario is? Yes there have been positive cases of VHS in Lake Huron but it is about a 16 hr drive from the portions of NW Ontario that most of the users of this site fish. In other words, don't hit the panic button yet. Yes it reasonable to assume that VHS is going to get into Lake Superior but the vast majority of the important walleye fisheries in NW Ontario are not part of the Great Lakes drainage system. Rainy/Winnipeg/English River systems all flow to the west and ultimately then to the north. Yes there are walleye fisheries in southern Ontario but they have been dealing with VHS there for a number of years. Bait can still be used in those areas but there are restrictions on moving bait out of zones that are VHS positive. Long way from Lac Seul or Lake of the Woods. Besides, who would want to fish down there anyhow?? Certainly not my dream trip...draggin a crank bait around on lead core or a downrigger for a fish i wouldn't eat, topped off by a stay in a hotel room beside strip mall."
1375739,Pikeslayer8,2011-12-22 21:12:00,1460,"Do you think that MNR is going to over-react or under-react with a disease that is spreading and possibly could mutate? All I'm pointing out is this may affect how live bait is handled in the near future. And yes, Ontario is a large province but I sure do not want to take any chances with the health of my lake. It just takes one uninformed knucklehead to release infected bait into the Rainy/Winnipeg/English River watershed and I don't want that be me or you."
1375762,jigngrub,2011-12-23 04:26:00,304,For those that may not know:It is against the law for non resident fishermen to trap their own minnows in Ontario.
1375787,v-bay gord,2011-12-23 06:48:00,3168,I personnally would not be unhappy if the use of live bait (minnows) was discontinued for the reasons mentioned. There are so many alternatives these days.
1375791,HeHooksHimself,2011-12-23 07:17:00,725,"As much as i prefer other methods, nothing works as well as the fish's natural food. Four bucks a doz. does add up quickly though."
1375800,v-bay gord,2011-12-23 07:30:00,3168,"It's all personal preference I suppose. For myself I would rather catch 10 fish trolling a crankbait or jigging a Salmo Chubby Darter, than catch 20 dunking a minnow."
1375820,Pikeslayer8,2011-12-23 08:12:00,1460,"jigngrub is absolutely correct. No minnow traps please.I'm sorry if thread title were to mislead anyone. Geez, before Walleye Central, I have to confess of being ignorant of many laws and regulations."
1375826,Bill Krejca,2011-12-23 08:27:00,6107,"In these days of ""numbers"" fishing, i.e., ""I don't want to go there unless we can boat 100 fish in a day"", we sometimes forget, or never maybe knew, that the challenge is part of the fishing satisfaction equation. The ""thrill of the chase"" if you will. I, too, prefer coaxing the fish into biting with artificials, even better, using a bait I designed/made. I still occasionally use minnows up north - it has been quite a number of years, now that I think about it, but they can have their place in the arsenal of baits. Pikeslayer has a valid concern for the spreading of the fish disease, and it is a good thing to periodically remind those of us who cherish the wilderness, that we respect efforts to have it remain so. Eventually, perhaps, conscientious bait handling caution will more become part of our accepted culture. For now, a periodic reminder of potential threats, and what we can do to resist detrimental effects, seems to be a good thing. Anyway, that's the way I see it. Merry Christmas, folks! Bill Krejca"
1375885,Curryale,2011-12-23 12:54:00,50,One thing that might be lost in this for local fishermen is that many of the shiner minnows that are sold in Ontario come from Lake Simcoe. So even in North Eastern and Western Ontario it is going to be very hard to buy shiner minnows unless they are trapped locally.
