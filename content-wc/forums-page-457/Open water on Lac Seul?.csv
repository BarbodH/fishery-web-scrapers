How is LS doing? Thanks! It must be the 177 days to go that keep me checking WC on these cold gray central Il. days of winter."

Water flows across the region are WAY down so that should make for good ice conditions this year on the major river systems. Temperatures have been well below normal in NW Ontario but the combination of no snow and low flows is making up for a lack of colder weather. Couple of good cold snaps and we will be right in business here. That being said, I would be a little nervous about going on the biggest lake trout lakes on January 1. Crow and Silver were still wide open on the last satellite image. Would love to splash a skiff for lake trout on opening day!"
