1373107,Gary from Iowa,2011-12-14 05:23:00,74,"My brothers and I fished this camp about 11 years ago for a few days in late July and early August. We had outstanding smallmouth bass fishing from the dock in front of the cabin. A friend of mine went up in June in 2009 and had excellent Walleye and Northern Pike fishing. (There also large crappies near the camp.)My friends didn't didn't fish off the docks though. There is a good sized waterfall abount a 100 yards from camp, hence the name. This is an old basic camp, mismatched applicances, questionable wiring, but things work. You can see the 2 x 4 studding and some have nails for hooks. On the plus side the cabins have hot and cold running water, shower and flush toilet and cabins have a propane grill outside.I beleive the rental motors are 15 hp and the fishing is outstanding. If you have a big enough boat, have a good gps and know how to use it you could make. Personally I prefer to have the resort owner make arrangements to take me in. Water transporation is an additional cost.Gary"
