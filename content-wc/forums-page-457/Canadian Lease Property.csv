Also wondering if anyone has had any issues doing this. Would rather buy deeded property but the only camp on my favorite lake is a lease. Thanks, Slushfish"
1373385,Golden Eagle,2011-12-14 19:27:00,2642,I looked into purchasing a lake cabin on government property. In that case it could be bought only by a Canadian citizen. It was about 5 years ago.

We had it for about two years till the Canadian government took it back cause we were not Canadian or something. My dad was very closed mouthed about what happened.We did find out a few things back then. First, when the camp is not active as much, bears like to move in. We showed up one year to find a bear living in camp. We kicked the bear out and spent a day repairing what we could. This was a tent camp so not a tremendous amount we could do. Twas cool to see the fridge crushed like a beer can and laying out back. Secondly, the outboards stashed in the cabin under the bunks were lax on security. Brand new motors, beat to h3ll. Was amazed they were even returned. Dad said it was natives.The advantages for us were negligible. Of course, you can go whenever we wanted, however, as I remember, we just couldn't make the time for spontaneous trips. We saved a bit of money by driving up to Savant to fly out of Rusty Myers base. Of course, the additional miles drivin were tough back then and countered any savings we may have realized. Course, I was 10 then and didn't pull my wallet out much."

I have a cottage in Manitoba on leased land, no problem being a U.S. citizen and holding that lease. I would say that every province , as well as every property, may have different stipulations. You would be wise to contact a lawyer in the closest town to the property you are looking at and have him answer your questions."
