I came across an interesting place on the net, it's Flame Lake Lodge located an hour South of Chapleau on Rte. 129. It rates are in-expensive, especially the meal plan and with the lodge being on 3 accessable lakes with many outlaying lakes, this looks like a good deal. I welcome any comments on this lodge and the quality of the fishing there. Seanik"
1377298,Slushfish,2011-12-29 19:29:00,263,"Stayed at Flame Lk. three winters ago. We have a cabin a half hour from there. Wanted to fish a new lake that we couldn't get to from ours. Very nice people, clean cabins, I think they were $140/day. I know quite a few people that have stayed there over the years, no fantastic fish reports. Lots of lakes around there. Did they give you any names of other lakes you could fish? Summer or winter trip? Been around that area for almost 30 yrs. Glad to help if I can. Slushfish."
1377393,Seanik,2011-12-30 08:21:00,218,"Thanks for the reply Slushfish, this will be an August trip. Their website mentions the following lakes, Flame Lake, Burntwood Lake, O'Jay Lake and Vincent Lake a portage lake up river. We don't expect trophy fishing just enough action to keep us interested. Any information about the lakes and area will be a great help and appreciated. The group who go on these adventures are in our late 60's and early 70's, so we don't do hardcore strenious trips and like remote lodges with a meal plan. Seanik"
