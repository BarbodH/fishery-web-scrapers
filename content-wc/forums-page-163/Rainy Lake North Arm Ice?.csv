6183234,h8go4s,2018-05-09 21:03:00,1673,Here's the satellite shot from Monday. Today and yesterday were too cloudy to see anything. Looks like it has a chance by the weekend. You can check it yourself here:https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/
6187265,Rock Lobstar1,2018-05-11 15:43:00,134,I flew over rainy today. The north arm is ice free except for some large sheets left in the main body just north of the causeway. Should be gone in a couple days
