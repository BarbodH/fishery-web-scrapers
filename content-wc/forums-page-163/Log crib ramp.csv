6109194,Lotw1,2018-04-04 08:17:00,36,I've been thinking about building a log crib shore ramp to pull a couple boats up on for a few years and after reading about them in a post a few days back I figured this would be a good year to do it. I'm just wondering if anyone has pictures of one or any tips on good or bad ones. Also if anyone knows if they are anchored down to the rock or beach or if they are heavy enough to just lay there.Thanks
6109458,BornToFish,2018-04-04 10:02:00,1224,"Greetings,I have helped build several log cribs over many years.. I wasn't the designer of the crib, but just helped build it.I believe that a key is selecting the proper type of logs to build the crib. There are types of trees that will rot over a short period of time. There are other types that will last for many years when soaking in water. I haelped move them, but did not get involved with cutting them. Thus, I don't know what type of trees we used. It might have been spruce, but honestly am not sure.We laid long main ""runners"" that were spaced every four feet apart. They were all perpendicular to the water's edge and extended a short ways into the water. When you get to this part of the project, remember that water level often drops throughout the season, so be sure to make them long enough to account for low water levels. We then put cross-members perpendicular to the ""runners"". The cross-members are widely spaced near the water (say one foot apart) but become more tightly spaced apart near the top of the crib. The narrower spacing is to keep people from slipping a foot/ankle between the cross-members when entering/exiting the boat.The diameter of the ""runners"" was about one foot. The cross-members are much smaller in diameter - say 4-6 inches. The entire crib is nailed with nails about one foot long. The crib pretty much lays there under its own weight. We cabled the top of the crib to some trees to prevent the crib from moving during a storm or during ice-out.Good luck with your project!!"
6109770,Lotw1,2018-04-04 12:02:00,36,"BornToFish,Thank you very much for the info. I figured on using some fir trees as they seem to last quite awhile, better than pine anyways. Good tip on the spacing near the top. I never thought about that, but I suppose it would be pretty easy to twist an ankle trying to walk on the logs. I suppose I could put down a little decking up top for a walkway also. Thanks again for the info, much appreciated!"

The shield rock on shore was at just the right angle. It was possible to run the boat up on it by motor, and push it off by hand. I would think that cedar or treated wood would last the longest. Good luck."
6110402,123chadder,2018-04-04 17:32:00,429,you want to use cedar logs

6110682,BornToFish,2018-04-04 20:17:00,1224,"Greetings,I thought of one more thing to mention about boat cribs. Most of the boat cribs that I have used were floating on the water. That is, we put the bow of the boat on the end of the crib and then pushed the boat onto the crib with the motor. As the boat accelerates up the crib, I believe the crib is also ""sinking"" under the weight of the boat. This action by the crib facilitates both landing the boat onto the crib and launching the boat from the crib.I'm glad that others chimed in on various options for selecting wood when making a boat crib. I recall the guys working on the cribs with me saying it was very important to select the ""right"" type of trees, otherwise the wood would quickly rot. Unfortunately, I just don't remember the ""right"" type of trees that were to be selected. Even if I did remember, I wouldn't know how to tell the various types of tree from one another.Kindest regards...."

6190657,Hwy 101,2018-05-13 23:32:00,33,I hope this pic comes through. The log crib at Stormer Lake shore lunch spot. Workred pretty good and kept the lower units out in deeper water. The Lunds slid on and off the pine logs real easy.
6190921,Esoxchaser,2018-05-14 06:41:00,1576,"White Oak is the ideal wood. Very strong and decay resistant. They made ships out of it, as well as still using it for barrels and horse fencing. No chemicals to leech into water or promote corrosion on aluminum hulls."
