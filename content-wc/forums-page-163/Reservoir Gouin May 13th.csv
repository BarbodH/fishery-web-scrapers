6192305,Freytown,2018-05-14 15:22:00,770,I'm pretty sure the river flowing into Saraana bay is closed untill 5/26/18. Most spawning areas on the Gouin have this restriction. Better have them check before entering beyond the posted signs. FT
6192313,Andre (wallyandre),2018-05-14 15:24:00,2274,X2!
6192457,Doublelung76,2018-05-14 16:40:00,42,"All good pal,they have been fishing that section for 30yrs,there are markers that you can't fish past until the next week.thats the spawning grounds.clearly marked with signs on both sides."
6192481,Andre (wallyandre),2018-05-14 17:33:00,2274,On that map you double click on the blue fish and it shos a pic of the spwning area with the coordinates:http://www.afcgouin.ca/carte-interactive/
6192569,tshea,2018-05-14 18:12:00,36,I am heading up on Friday (18th) - sounds like the Ice should be out by then. http://www.afcgouin.ca/ is saying that spawning is behind schedule so it would be nice if we didn't have 20 boats pulling out females with eggs in the spawning grounds on the 26th.
