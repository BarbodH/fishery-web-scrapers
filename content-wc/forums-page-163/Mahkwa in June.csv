6186457,Walleye65,2018-05-11 09:40:00,9,Wondering how Mahkwa area of Lac Suel is in mid-June. Have fished it in August and was impressed with the walleye fishing...but wondered how mid June is (know its a big lake and sections could be seasonal or migratory ??). Fishing there as good in mid June as we found it to be in mid August ?Thanks

We fish over the fourth of July on the mid/west'ish end. (McKenzie Bay area) and fish seem to be between sand banks and deeper structure areas. That in-between time we spend a fair amount of time looking for fish. We also fish out of Mahkwa in the late summer and by then the fish are everywhere that is traditional. Sand banks are all but dead.In June? I'd think sand would be a good place to start. Don't be afraid to get more shallow than you think. Weeds starting to grow? And near sand? At least give it a fair shot before moving on.We fish other large lakes in late June and fish were still in the back bays, but moving out towards summer spots. Had some great fishing around small islands in the middle of the bays. Then those areas three weeks later were totally devoid of fish and the main lake was hot.In mid July around the Mahkwa area fish are setting up near deep water on the main large open water areas. Islands and quick depth changes seem to always work about that time. I have friends that fish Mahkwa area in mid July and they fish away from the sand banks, but sometimes will start there and work out if they don't find fish where they thought they might be initially.Hope that makes sense? Have a good trip and I'd like to know what you find. Have a great trip.Pooch"
