6181978,Ricky Spanish,2018-05-09 10:08:00,1298,"I have a tonneau cover now, but this is what I used to do. I bought a very large waterproof duffel bag from Cabela's about 25yrs ago that still does a good job, too. When was poorer, heavy mil lawn or construction bags worked very well. Bunch up the top, spin the bag a few times, fold over the top and wrap with duct tape a few times to seal. My buddy did asbestos removal and a seemingly unlimited supply of clear heavy bags. Yeah, most likely stolen."
6172009,btyreprich,2018-05-04 05:46:00,1067,I have seen a few rental pickups with the factory installed hitch under the bumper but would guess that the rental agency would have removed the wiring harness just for the reason.
6172241,rockape,2018-05-04 07:41:00,215,"I have one friend in our group that has a Dodge Ram. No cap. I have thrown my two duffel bags of clothes, food, tackle, etc. in your standard rubbermaid or the other safelite brand (whatever it is called) into these big tubs, and sealed them with duct tape. Never a problem. Cheap. Cargo net over them too. I make sure all of my gear is locked up if we shack up at IF. Another buddy has a big Ram with a cap. I'll put my rods and valuable tackle in there if I need to. Who wants to take the chance that your killer tackle is gone at the border before you even make cast #1! Nowhere can you replace your gear at the last minute. Bobby's in Vermilion Bay is the best tackle shop I have found, but are you going to drop several thousand dollars to replace all of your ****, respool every reel, etc.? Not me. I'm not taking the chance. I'll sleep with my St. Croix's, Shamano's, and Abu Garcia's if I have to!"
6173177,PJHColdwater,2018-05-04 13:36:00,37,We have a group of guys from Rural Ohio that make the trip about 16 hours to Ontario every year. If more than 4 go - we have several local places that will rent 15 passenger full size vans. We can take out the back 1 or 2 bench seats and leaves a TON of room. Even with 6 guys and gear we have room to spare. They also come with hitches and they have all given us the OK to pull a boat. Cost for 10 days is usually $800-1000 with 2200 miles round trip. (If 4 or less we take my Tundra with full cap).
6174273,btyreprich,2018-05-05 04:42:00,1067,Those seats - do you remove them with a socket set? Would have guessed they were held in place by welds.

6175241,btyreprich,2018-05-05 18:10:00,1067,"Changed my mind and am thinking of going with several Rubbermaid tote boxes to hold our clothes and groceries. Priced right and will have more uses that the weatherproof bag. For those that have pickups without any kind of a cover, is a cargo net necessary? I want to thank the Rubbermaid totes crammed full of clothes & reels will weigh enough so as to not be affected by the wind. However I don't own a pickup so I'll take the advice of those with experience. The cargo nexts aren't expensive - Harbor Fright has a nice one with good reviews under $20."
6175577,Rock Lobstar1,2018-05-06 00:12:00,134,Don’t forget to consider that the price of gas is obscene as soon as you cross the border. Those pick ups are thirsty buggers
6175617,btyreprich,2018-05-06 05:18:00,1067,That’s for sure about gas prices in Canada. We always top off in International Falls and buy just a small amount in Canada on the return trip. Just enough to get over the border.We used to bring a few gas jugs worth of gas but stopped doing that as we realized the risk & mess are not worth it.Last year I drove the wife’s Highlander and we got pretty decent mileage given the size of that truck and how much gear we had packed into it. We leave very early in the morning and overnight in International Falls so there’s no hurry. Drive under 65 mph was the key.
6177545,RRK285,2018-05-07 07:22:00,44,"Have done this plenty of times, no problem. Large plastic bins that have latches, throw a bungee around them too. Nothing has got wet. Wrap stuff in garbage bags if you want a little more piece of mine. Plano makes the big storage trunks too if you want to spend some money."
6181674,law57,2018-05-09 07:57:00,1147,I've made many trips to Canada in very heavy rain. I never have a topper on my truck and just use totes - Rubber Maid or the like. I've never had anything in them get wet. I do put duct tape on the lids to ensure they don't blow off. Just plain old totes seal pretty well - but a good bump may knock a lid loose - so the duct tape. No worries mate!
6170521,MN_Moose,2018-05-03 07:54:00,964,"just a thought here, have your friend check with his insurance on rented vehicle going into Canada. Not saying it would be a problem up there but down in Mexico it could be problematic. And, do not make a home made plywood box for the back of the pickup. Border guards get very anxious when they saw that. They made us lift off the top and carry away while they approached cautiously."
6170577,Kansas Bound,2018-05-03 08:12:00,152,Here are the totes from Home Depot that I likehttps://www.homedepot.com/p/Sterilit...9004/206402052
6170617,farmnfish,2018-05-03 08:31:00,130,We always rented a uhaul trailer. Everything stayed dry and it could be locked.
6170817,valley366,2018-05-03 09:41:00,193,We took my Expedition the last couple of years and not all the gear fits inside. We picked up one of the roof top bags from Walmart. I just got one of the cheap ones. Some of the stuff we put in plastic totes and others inside plastic garbage bags. We drove through several rain storms and while some water got inside the bag all the gear was dry. You could easily throw one of these inside the box of the truck. It is also is big enough that i left it attached to the truck at the hotel.The totes I bought were just the cheap ones at any big box store. I just measured the bag and figured out which ones would fill the bag the most effectively height and width wise.https://www.walmart.com/search/?quer...ead=roof%20top
6170849,Iowa4ND,2018-05-03 09:46:00,35,Not sure how many guys you have going and how decent the roads are near your destination but we rented a Chrysler Pacifica van last year for our trip to Nungusser. It was one of three vehicles we had but we loaded it down with four guys and gear to the roof. Rod carriers fit nicely between the seats. It did fine and also has integrated roof racks you could use with a pretty inexpensive soft side roof top carrier. Not waterproof but certainly water resistant. Solved the issue of easy theft in an open truck bed and was pretty comfy for the passengers. I know the back seat of my Silverado is not all that comfy. just my two cents. Uhaul trailer was our back up option.
6171313,Aspencreek,2018-05-03 15:15:00,2911,"These......or I have 6 similar ones Black with the yellow lid, Menards has then on sale right now for $10. I line the box with a garbage bag then clothes go it, twist tied and then the lid, lid zip tied on. The boxes stack and are secured in the bed. Food also rides in the boxes or coolers. Even the tackle boxes, minnow buckets, etc. go in the boxes. Then a plastic tarp over the whole works and secured with ratchet straps. I have done over 20 trips staying overnight in the Super 8 in Ft Francis and not one problem. Except for the time my brother tried to put his PVC rod case into the cab and hit the windshield!!"
6171409,btyreprich,2018-05-03 16:13:00,1067,"Thanks to all who took the time to post comments and suggestions. We have four adult men in our group. My buddy decided to rent the full size truck as mini vans can get a bit crowded as we bring our own food with us. Right now I'm leaning on buying a waterproof cargo bag that can ride on the roof of a car and just place this in the back of the pickup truck. Between the weight of the clothes for my son and I, a tackle bag and some of the dry groceries, I cannot imagine that the cargo bag would move around much in the bed or fly out from the wind. Moving that bag into our hotel room at night could be a real pain in the seat! Definitely going to use the Rubbermaid totes to hold some of the groceries that can leak: oil, spaghetti sauce, maple syrup, sodas, and beer. Maybe I ought to borrow another cooler for these items? So looking forward to when I buy a full size pickup and put a cap on the bed. No worring about items getting wet or stolen."
6171577,East coast,2018-05-03 18:04:00,32,"They are the 102 litre (sorry I'm in Canada, but i believe the equivalent is about 27 gallons) HDX black and yellow lockable strong box, i think they are the second largest ones they carry. We go with 4 guys, 12 totes, fits nicely in the back of a truck, rods are in plano hard case carriers. We carry zip ties and tie down the lids for a tight waterproof fit."
6171633,Live to jig,2018-05-03 18:51:00,159,"Another option is to rent a full sized SUV , a lot of them come standard with a trailer hitch, rent a small uhaul trailer for cheap and there you go."
6171649,youngknight,2018-05-03 19:27:00,228,"For what it's worth, I tried renting a pickup to move my daughter to college and a rental trailer but could not find one company that rents one with a tow hitch set up. In fact they would say that it was due to policy...no towing."
6170161,btyreprich,2018-05-02 21:19:00,1067,"It's my friends turn to drive up to Canada this year and he has decided to rent a full-size pickup truck instead of using his aging Mitsubishi Endeavor. The pickup is a model with four doors which will be nice. As a rental, there won't be a bed liner or a cover / cap on the bed. We aren't concerned about the fishing gear as the rods are in Plano hard sided cases and the tackle bags are designed to get wet. Coolers will be loaded down with blue ices for the frozen and refrigerated items. I seal the coolers with stretch tape to keep the cold air in and know this will keep any rain out. Bit concerned about the dry groceries and clothes. Amy thinking that Rubbermaid type totes inide garbage bags might not stay dry. Same with our duffle bags of clothes. Any suggestion on what to do or not do would be most helpful. Thanks."
6170177,Daddybigfins,2018-05-02 21:32:00,484,I'm sure you've heard of dry bags. That's the way to go with your clothes anyway
6170185,Live to jig,2018-05-02 21:41:00,159,"I did a family trip and rented a pickup, like you said Coolers, and Rubbermaid boxes I packed some super heavy trash bags, wire ties and straps incase of rain. Truck only had 1700 miles when I picked it and had satellite radio!"
6170233,Esoxchaser,2018-05-03 04:41:00,1576,"I do a lot of remote site stuff, where wet gear could be fatal. I pack my duffels in heavy duty trash bags inside of these:http://www.planomolding.com/sportsma...nk-large-blackEverything is always clean and dry."
6170313,BornToFish,2018-05-03 06:22:00,1224,"Greetings,The first thought that came to mind is the potential for theft should you leave the vehicle un-attended. For example, someone could easily take something when you use the restroom at a gas station or if you stay overnight on the way to/from your fishing destination.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6170361,johnboat,2018-05-03 06:39:00,2014,A good trash bag and Rubbermaid = bone dry clothes. I usually suck the air out of the trash bag first with a shop vac and zip tie it. It seals it up good and gives you more room. Have a good trip.
6170369,Esoxchaser,2018-05-03 06:45:00,1576,I just put my knees on them and squeeze the air out.
6170377,East coast,2018-05-03 06:47:00,32,"We use stong boxes from home depot, they stack nicely, you can zip tie the lids down and then you put a cargo strap around several of them in the box, this makes it difficult for a quick steel, keeps them together for the drive and no need to tie them down to the box. Wouldn't do it another way. Garbage bags are an insurance but we have yet to get our gear wet using these boxes and packed this way. Used rubbermaid one year but they are not as sturdy nor to they stack as nice to stay put."
6170449,btyreprich,2018-05-03 07:41:00,1067,"Agreed on the concern of theft - especially with an open bed. When in Eau Claire for lunch, we will park the truck where we can keep an eye on it. When overnighting in International Falls, all contents will be moved out of the bed and into our rooms for safe keeping. Over the years while waiting to cross the border, I've heard local radio report of thefts from hotel parking lots. These reports all seem to be on the Canadian side - likely because of the radio station we are listening to. Not saying that there is more crime in Fort Frances."
6170481,btyreprich,2018-05-03 07:48:00,1067,Interested to see exactly which strong boxes from Home Depot you are referring to. Any chance you could attach a photo or tell me the model number? There are so many choices on their web site I'm not sure which model you are using. Thanks
