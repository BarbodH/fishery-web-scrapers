6170057,HitmanSB,2018-05-02 19:45:00,10,"Bigger boat for sure. I run blocker in my Alumacraft Trophy 205, for our other's in his Lund Rebel 1650 with F50 Yamaha. We fish 8 to 15 miles out on most days, and the wide open areas kick up a good chop, that the Lund struggles to fish safely. If you pick your days and watch the sky, and changing conditions the 165 woulld be ok, but I've never been in too big of a boat when the wind kicks up. Our trip starts Aug 11, in the NW section, can't wait!"
6170913,Mr. Sauger,2018-05-03 11:20:00,285,"I’ve taken my 16 footer single console boat to Las Seul five times. I wouldn’t have taken trips 2-4 if I though it wasn’t safe, BUT….· I would have been much dryer and comfortable in an 18+ footer · Some days we travel 30+ minutes to get to our favorite spots. When the wind kicks up Las Seul will get rough. Wifey may not enjoy that. You’ll be more comfortable behind a console. · Travel speed is a nice plus.· If I also had 18.5 footer, I would definitely take the larger boat."
6171281,Aspencreek,2018-05-03 14:53:00,2911,"If it was me...big boat every time. LS is a real oddity when the wind kicks up! The waves can come from different directions depending on the islands and shorelines. We were headed in because an unexpected storm rolled in and just as I got to Poplar Narrows headed west we were hit with big waves coming from the northwest and southwest, interesting to say the least in a Lund Outfitter 17' with a 50hp tiller. It was all I could do to avoid getting sideways and not spearing a wave. When my 12 yr old grandson sitting in the seat in front of me went up, when the rest of the boat went down and I had to grab him and throw him back into the seat I knew it was time for an investment. Days like those will get your blood racing and the heart rate up, he is 23 now and we still talk about that ride. Come to think about it....that was the last time I ever went thru those narrows."
6180026,PRO-V16,2018-05-08 14:59:00,16,I fish the east end from Deception to past Pine Point several miles. More protection on this end of the lake. Have a 1660 Pro-V with a 60 Yamaha and never had a problem in 25 years. Got pretty rough a couple times but nothing that rig couldn't handle. Just have to slow down a little sometimes.
6180186,Pooch,2018-05-08 15:41:00,4618,The west end of your range is about the east end of ours. Never been much further east of Pine Point. Been tempted on slow days just to see what it looks like. Though I'm thinkin' it looks about the same! If you go five more miles west of the old ferry or a couple miles west of the village and it's a very different lake as far as wind.Pooch
6180234,PRO-V16,2018-05-08 15:51:00,454,"I agree Pooch. I've been past the ferry, village and down to Vaughn. Actually east and north of Pine it is much more rocky countryside with some very high promontories. Used to stay at Abram and trailer but my buddy bought an Outpost cabin at McClane Narrows 9 or 10 years ago so that's where I stay now. We go west to Sen Bay and north to Chamberlain and east just short of Kejick Bay."
6180466,rnnonmt,2018-05-08 17:22:00,992,IMO bring the big iron W/T. Fished for a couple decades on LS out of 16ft rentals with 25HP's. On rough days or long hauls you be glad to be sitting behind a windshield for sure. Ever since taking my 19ft with a 150 I dont want to go back to the little boats.
6182258,wooglin,2018-05-09 12:09:00,371,"Your boats will be fine, we did 3 years out of these boats - mine was the 14 footer on the left with a 1973 Evenrude 25HP motor. We fished out of Hudson and went anywhere from Hudson, all the way to Websters Bay, Lilly Lake, Deception and Italian Bay. Your trip will be a result of what you make of it, do not depend on your boat size to make it awesome!"
6183346,Pooch,2018-05-10 02:13:00,4618,"I respectfully disagree on using a fourteen foot and twenty five on the areas of LS that we fish. Even a sixteen with a forty can be precarious at times. Did it for years with a sixteen. Very do-able, but precarious at times. Most have seen days when you just need to be off the water on LS, regardless of boat size.A week in a fourteen foot? Not the best choice on the open water areas of LS. Fish only near camp in bays and not have to cross open water would be OK though.Pooch"
6183745,pjshorthorn,2018-05-10 07:04:00,5654,"The spots Wooglin ran to in a 14' are not huge open water runs, but they are a decent run from the Hudson launch. My biggest concern would have been getting through Crooked Rapids with only a 25hp motor and getting tossed around like a cork. I would agree with you that you limit yourself and have increased the risk of a problem. In any kind of big weather event you are either relegated to tucking into a protected bay or hugging shorelines all the way back. Wouldn't take much to swamp a 14' in rough seas on LS. Or any big body of water for that matter.PjShorthorn"
6168121,reup,2018-05-01 21:35:00,35,I'm thinking of coming up to Lac Seul this July or August staying in an RV park along Highway 105 and I have the option of either bringing a 165 classic tiller with a 50 or and 18 and a half foot walkthrough with a 90. I really enjoy fishing out of the smaller boat a lot more but I'm worried that that boat is too small for Lac seul. it's a couples trip with my wife and I can pick and choose my days not like a dawn to dusk guys trip. Any opinions from you Lac seul veterans?
6168145,rather-be-fishin,2018-05-01 22:04:00,429,"Lac Seul is a big lake with big water. Wind & weather can definitely control when & where you fish. If your 18 1/2 ft boat is rigged for fishing with trolling motors, depth finders/GPS, Etc.....bigger is better on the mighty Lac Seul! Good luck on your trip! RBF."
6168177,Bstar,2018-05-02 03:16:00,564,hands down the 18 1/2'
6168409,bus33,2018-05-02 06:10:00,289,"Bigger is always better but if your 165 is your go to for fishing then I wouldn't hesitate to take it. No matter what boat, just watch the weather and don't be dumb about getting caught in a storm. I see a lot of 16 ft boats out there."
6168489,pjshorthorn,2018-05-02 06:55:00,5654,"I used a 17 1/2 ft with a 40hp on Lac Seul for many years. I never felt uncomfortable in bigger seas, but I also recognized when not to push the limits if weather became an issue. PjShorthorn"
6168617,stumcfar,2018-05-02 07:42:00,451,"The biggest thing will be to have a handle on the weather for the day. You may have to travel a ways that time of year. We were caught last year in Mackenzie Bay with a long boat ride back to Gawley's. A thunderstorm took us by surprise. I have a 19 foot and it was rough but manageable. The lightning and rain were the worst. I fish the Minnesota and Manitoba side of LOW which can get very rough but the only time I have been concerned for my safety was a trip a few years back on Lac Seul. It was a nice sunny day in which the wind picked up late morning. The wind blew hard all day from the west. 3 of us were in a 17' camp boat and had to get from Lunker Point back to Gold Pines. The other boat was a 16'. Around 6 oclock in the evening we finally had to try get back. When we came out from around Lunker to head west, I instantly knew we had made a bad decision. The boat was under powered for what we had to do. We took waves over the front, the other 2 guys bailed while I did my best to keep us going into the waves. The concern was if we ever got side ways, it would roll us over. By the grace of God, we made it back, but it took a few beers to calm the nerves. I would go with the bigger boat for those reasons."
6168673,brett13,2018-05-02 07:56:00,51,"use the bigger boat. When i was younger my dad and I got stranded on an island for 9 hours due to the wind. We had a 16' lund at that time, after that year my dad sold that boat and bought a 1825 pro guide. no issues with that boat. rather be safe than sorry. best of luck"
6168689,rockape,2018-05-02 08:00:00,215,Big boat all the way!
6168865,reup,2018-05-02 09:03:00,35,My plan is to do a smorgasbord of lakes from Lake of the Woods near Morson to Lac suel and possibly Gull Rock. The only Lake that concerns me is Lac suel but since I'm so flexible with timing and whatnot I could pick and choose my days. Right now I'm leaning towards the bigger boat but haven't made a final decision. Thanks for all the opinions... You guys are great.
6169745,Pooch,2018-05-02 16:06:00,4618,"A windshield boat on LS is a much better travel boat in rough water. Especially if it is the larger of two choices.I've fished LS a number of times with an old Lund Rebel 16 foot and forty and it was fine. Did get caught in forty mph wind coming from McKenzie back through Steamboat once. We were heading directly into the wind and took a beating and while I was concerned about getting turned sideways and getting swamped we did ok and made it to Steamboat narrows for a break then we were a little more protected for the rest of the ride to camp.I'm now running an eighteen foot tiller and it's surely a better ride. Safer than the old Lund? Probably. How much safer? Don't know, but safer for sure.Most camp boats ore 17.5' boats so that should tell us something.Pooch"
