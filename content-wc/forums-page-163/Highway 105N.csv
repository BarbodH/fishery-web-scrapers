It appeared to me that there will be another resurfacing project starting north of Ear Falls that will extend to the Trout River - about a forty kilometer stretch of road. There was a crew spraying orange paint on the roadway and inserting marker rods along the side of the road.Nearly all of the lakes and ponds that I saw along the way were free of ice. It looked like there was a relatively small amount of ice still on Perrault Lake. Most of the ponds along the roads were nearly dry. Lac Seul looked quite low as well.Boat operators might want to chat with guides or lodge owners to hear their advice about navigational hazards. Hazards that are normally well underwater during this time of the season might be in play this spring.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

On the way home we went through a constuction area that had this slurry on the road, My boat and new Jeep were covered in this crap. Lookedforacarwash in VBay. No luck. Took the vehicles to the car wash when we got home. Three times and that's **** is still hanging on. Is this what we are in for this year from Ear Falls to Trout River? We are traveling June 23-30. Thanks. Any help is appreciated."
6190801,Shotgun,2018-05-14 05:44:00,759,"mr. crampster, few years ago we hit a consruction zone south of Ear Falls consisting of ground up road. As we entered the zone a water truck started watering down the road ahead of us. I've never been in such a mess in my life. I had it all over my truck, boat, tarp and trailer. When I got home I took it to a semi truck/trailer wash to get the majority off. I honestly have to say if I knew that was going to happen again, I'd change my plans to avoid it. A mototcycle was in the same group as us, if that was me on my bike I'd of been crying."

I figured once I got to the lake, the spray from running up and down the lake would take care of it. Nope...my red ProV was tan for the week. Took forever to get it off at home and I'm sure if I look hard enough, I could still find it on my trailer somewhere. That stuff is like a mix of concrete and peanut butter."
6193361,BornToFish,2018-05-15 05:39:00,1224,"Greetings,I suffered through the same stretches of road construction last year that were mentioned above - 105 and 502. I pulled a trailer for a friend that resulted in many nicks in the tailgate of my truck. The stones came off the tire, bounced off the trailer and nicked my tailgate in MANY places. I now have a rock guard mounted on my trailer receiver.Several of my friends waxed their trucks, just before our trip in July. They reported a reasonably better time when cleaning their trucks, compared to what I encountered. I will now be waxing my truck before my next trip.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6194624,BornToFish,2018-05-15 16:23:00,1224,"Greetings,I heard today that the road construction on highway 105 will span 28.3 kilometers. It will begin just north of Ear Falls and proceed towards Red Lake.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
