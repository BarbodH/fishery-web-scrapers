6172793,Carnhzkr,2018-05-04 10:42:00,964,"Not at The Falls, but several years back I took my wife and two sons on a trip to Ontario driving our Trailblazer. On the way home, we spent the night at the Hilton in Minneapolis which included free parking in their underground ramp. Got in the vehicle to leave for home the next morning and could tell something just didn't feel right and soon realized someone had gotten in. Did a mental inventory and determined they'd taken our GPS, my son's portable gaming system and about $50. Could have been much worse. They'd opened the tote containing a week's worth of stinky clothes but they didn't notice all of my reels which I'd stuffed into dirty socks for the ride home. There was no sign of forced entry. I reported the theft to the Minneapolis police and the guy told me there'd been several cases of someone using some type of remote entry device.We got off lucky, but there's a terrible feeling of being violated when someone breaks in like that.My dad had pulled his rig many, many times to a public landing on the English River. It's a place north of Kenora called Caribou Falls, very near the aboriginal village of Whitedog. There's primitive camping there. He'd always left the week's worth of gas and other valuable items just lying around the camper and boat trailer (gas is even more valuable in such a remote area), but we've never had anything stolen in I'd guess 40 trips to that area. Lucky, I guess."
6172809,RRK285,2018-05-04 10:46:00,44,"Last year I made and mounted 4 8ft PVC tubes over the bed of my truck. We gambled and left them on filled with rods over night. No problems. We usually have a few vehicles with hitch cargo carriers with coolers , water , beer we leave out over night and no problems in InterFalls (so far)"
6178377,btyreprich,2018-05-07 14:29:00,1067,"Went to Halley's Camp one year - incredible Smallmouth Bass fishing. At any rate, I made a wrong turn and ended up in Whitedog Reservation. To say it looked like sections of Detroit is putting it mildly. Well the rental van was in my name so I told my 3 friends we'll find the right road to Halley's and better get going right away! Parked safely at Halley's Landing and there were no problems with the van during our stay."
6178417,big popi,2018-05-07 14:56:00,635,"Back when I had my 16ft Lund Laker, I had taken the time to redo the trailer. Sandblasted, painted, new tires and lights - it was real pretty. On the second day of our 2 week Canadian trip my son and I drove to one of the smallmouth lakes about 8-10 mile from camp. It is a pretty secluded launch. We were about 2 mile from the launch and a storm came up, so we were running back to the launch as fast as the 25 would push it. We got back and my trailer was not on my truck. At first I thought maybe it came unhooked - no such luck, someone came and stole it. At that point I had never locked the trailer, only had a safety clip on it. The storm let up, so I left my son in boat and told him to motor off shore a bit and not come in unless he saw me. I went back to camp, called the OPP and borrowed a trailer to get the boat. As far as I know the OPP never found the trailer, but with all the backroads I can see why. Lesson learned - lock your trailer. I have never had anything taken in the Falls (knock on wood!). I do worry about my SS prop, but never had an sissue"
6179722,Jahloaf,2018-05-08 13:22:00,74,"One year we had couple of hundred day old donuts in bags in the boat. Someone opened one of the bags up and ate a few, left the half eaten ones there as well as a empty can of soda they took from the cooler. Another time, we were staying at the Super8 in Ft Frances, we went to the old Red Dog for some refreshments, on the way back stopped at our boat to get some ham out to make a few sandwiches before bed and the Ft Frances police pulled up asking for some ID, they thought we were breaking into someones boat. We offered em a ham sandwich, laughed at us and they told us to get to bed. Nice couple of officers I do say"
6186433,bigwalleye1,2018-05-11 09:36:00,2632,"So what, exactly, does one DO with a couple HUNDRED day old donuts?? You baiting bear or policemen???"
6171001,Bakefish,2018-05-03 12:24:00,1077,"The pickup truck thread got me to thinking. Have any of you guys had anything stolen from your vehicle or boat while parked at an International Falls hotel/motel. I've been going up since the 70's, stopping in the Falls most of the time, and haven't had a problem."
6171057,valley366,2018-05-03 12:53:00,193,We stay across the border in Fort Frances. Have done that going on 10+ years. We have ranged from a regular truck with open box and just a tarp over things to roof top carriers. Never had anything stolen. We are generally selective on a parking spot that is well lit in an area that you can easily see from the lobby or other business.
6171065,Bill Krejca,2018-05-03 12:54:00,6107,"I generally stay at Baudette, I've had no problem there. Heard about guys who stopped at a motel 1/2 way to Snow Lake, Manitoba, a few years ago. When they got to their destination next day, found out all their tackle in the boat was gone. Cover had been lifted, then neatly returned to position. A real shocker.Bill"
6171081,Whopper,2018-05-03 13:06:00,340,"I have stayed in International Falls at least ten times in the past 12 years on the Thursday or a Friday before walleye opener and never had a problem, knock on wood."
6171169,Blackmacs,2018-05-03 13:39:00,2121,I had my drivers seat stolen while the boat was stored at the dealer this year. They called and said they will replace it.
6171337,Aspencreek,2018-05-03 15:25:00,2911,"Have stayed over 20 times at the Super 8 in Fort Francis, (always on thurs night, our camp is fri to fri) and have never had a problem. Well Lit, along with lots of other groups doing the same, and a Bostons Pizza next door to add even more activity to discourage any offenders. But the open beds of the trucks are tarped and well secured, and the boats are covered as well."
6171761,Pooch,2018-05-03 20:39:00,4618,"Ditto FF Super 8. Never had a problem, but we never leave anything of value in the boat. Everything is locked (for what that is worth) inside the truck topper and covered with a black patterned blanket to occlude any ""lookers"".I have been told of items stolen on both sides of the border, but I think it is rare. One has to just use common sense about your own security. A serious thief will get what he wants, but the impulse thief usually is kept at bay with a little common sense on our part.Pooch"
6171849,NARDA 1,2018-05-04 00:15:00,636,Have stayed at the Renzde-vous and never had a problem. I have a soft camper top which would be easy to get into but have never had a problem.
6171977,grizzley,2018-05-04 05:27:00,2518,"I try to ""lock the barn before the horse is out"", 300 others may never have had a problem with getting anything stolen, I don't want to be the first! Pooch said it well, use some common sense, there are a lot of thieves out there!"
6172001,Shotgun,2018-05-04 05:45:00,759,"I purchased the attached but haven't had a chance to try it yet. Thought is to put it inside my boat under the cover when parked at a motel and the receiver in the motel room. Could do the same putting it under a tarp, inside a container, etc... You'd have to make sure where ever you put it no motion occurred, i.e., the cover being tight or wind blowing the cover may set it off. Anyway, just another thought/option. If it goes off, then I have the choice of running outside in my underwear or shooting out the motel window. LOL!https://www.harborfreight.com/wirele...tem-93068.html"
