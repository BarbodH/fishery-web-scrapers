We were looking for bass and pike although that hard. We marked fish in very deep water, 40-50 feet. There were no bass in shallow in the three places we fished so I think they were still deep. Last year we didn't really figure out where the walleye were until maybe the second week in June where we started to find them near humps. What to you all plan to do next weekend?"
6192065,Obabikon,2018-05-14 13:50:00,2370,Beaches will be my first stops. 8-12' in sand. I might even start with trolling spinners to cover more area.
6192601,Lake Of The Woods,2018-05-14 18:33:00,124,"Yeah, late spawn no doubt. I'd be fishing not far from the spawning areas."
6192889,The tank,2018-05-14 20:15:00,340,last Year opening week the water was still cold probably like this year. bass and walleye both were still deep. 18-24 foot deep. never found a walleye in less all week. usually we fish 10 foot and less for both. had too use the old theory. if there not where they're supposed to be go where they're not supposed too to be that time of year.

6193505,pjshorthorn,2018-05-15 06:19:00,5654,"I would agree with Jared on this one. Most of the big fish I have caught during opening weeks have come from sand flats that transition into 20+ feet of water quickly. Big fish would be 26-28+"". On known spots we would hit the spots early morning, late afternoon and again right before going in for the evening. Have fun on your LOTW trips. Beautiful lake with so much exploring to be done.
