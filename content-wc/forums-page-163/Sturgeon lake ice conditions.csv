6172833,Remi,2018-05-04 10:52:00,41,"I've been tracking lakes using Zoom Earth, if you zoom too close it goes to the Google Earth view. But at this zoom level, it's a daily picture. You can move the dates to find a day without clouds. This should be close to Sturgeon Lake:https://zoom.earth/#49.914093,-91.002502,9z Take Care, Remi."
6173545,JJJMN,2018-05-04 15:22:00,153,"Latest for Trapper Point Camp on facebook. Lots of water around edge of bay, Ice is black and the temps are up. I don't think we will have a problem in 2 weeks."
6174513,iman63,2018-05-05 08:18:00,91,Yes Sturgeon lake by Savant lake. We stay at Whiskey Jack Lodge.
6178001,JJJMN,2018-05-07 11:29:00,153,Pictures from Sunday at trapper Point Camp show half of Northern most bay is Ice free. That would be about 1/3 of the area between Trappers Point Camp and Rusty Myers would be open. Several years ago we got to camp with same Ice pattern and 2 days later all the ice in the bay was gone. Fishing was so good we didn't care if the main lake was still frozen and never checked. I would assume that Steam Boat and Canoe Channels are also already open (If you can get to them). Good luck to all.

Hoping that the first week guys can get out there on the water. I will be pulling into WJ Wednesday evening of first week, no fears for me, on the lake being open by then."
6187481,Lake Of The Woods,2018-05-11 17:21:00,124,"The ice on the small inland lakes has melted. Lakes such as Silver which are quite large have traces of ice but will most likely be gone in a couple of days. On Lake of the Woods the ice has nearly all melted with the exceptions of Big Traverse Bay, Barrier Islands, Hades Islands and Shoal Lake on the west end of LOW but it more than likely be gone in a few days. The attached photos were taken on May 10, 2018. I have some larger picture files taken from an aircraft on May 10,2018 but they are too large to upload on this forum. If you would like to see them PM me and I will send them off to you."
