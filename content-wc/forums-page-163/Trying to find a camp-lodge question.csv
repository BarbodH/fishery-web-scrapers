6184857,Guest,2018-05-10 13:54:00,0,"Maybe you have your trip planned -- seeing this in course of looking for something myself -- but you should look in to Holinshead Lake Seems to meet your requirements but rentals only 10 horse and under due to being zoned as conservation lake, small to mid size. Had good experiences overall"
6185009,prov1800,2018-05-10 15:52:00,5010,Few posts back I mentioned Clarke's northern lights.hope you checked them out.as far as fly outs they have 20 outposts and they all have generators. Can charge all your batteries and run your cpaps.plus live bait delivered every 2 days.fishing is great.
5382330,Obabikon,2017-03-08 06:36:00,2370,Or if you're in the Milwaukee area.... that show starts today!
5393938,Riverkeg,2017-03-13 11:38:00,134,can't go wrong at Cedar or with Clark's resort. I'll be there in 9 weeks.
5395082,prov1800,2017-03-13 19:27:00,5010,Season opens on the 20 th.
5395722,Riverkeg,2017-03-14 08:09:00,134,You are correct ProV. I was just doing quick math in my head but technically it's a little more than 9 weeks to the opener. I do thank you thought for steering me to Cedar Lake before last season opener. We had a great week there and a great stay at Clark's resort.
5395770,prov1800,2017-03-14 08:20:00,5010,I figured that.lol.ill see you there then.ill be around sometime during the week.
5396234,Golden Eagle,2017-03-14 11:04:00,2642,"I'll be on Little Vermilion Lake 9 weeks from today. Might fry up a 26"" pike to hold us off until Saturday walleye opener."
5396250,Riverkeg,2017-03-14 11:24:00,134,"if you see 3 idiots in a blue ProV 1660, stop by and say hello. after fishing, you can find us in the cabin that connected to the main lodge building. I'm sure we'll have a few extra adult beverages in a cooler."
5396738,prov1800,2017-03-14 15:44:00,5010,Ill be sure to stop either on lake or lodge or both.hoping for NICE weather like last year.
5397106,kampkook01,2017-03-14 17:52:00,6,"Sir, You might consider Rainbow Point Lodge on Perrault Lake. We have fished there in 2013 and 2015. Lots of eater eyes and opportunities for a wall hanger. Perch, Smallmouth, Northern and Muskes are also available. Check out the photos on their website. Not a big Lake but always seems to be a place to get away from the wind and waves. This is a drive to resort geared toward doing your own cooking. We are going back again this year in July. Check it out. It may be worth your efforts. Gary"
5406802,pikeandtina,2017-03-18 22:26:00,145,"AD, check with Pooch, he fishes this place, I believe?"
5283482,drlee,2017-01-21 12:14:00,409,"Take a look at Austin's Wilderness Lodge or North Albany Lodge on Lake Pashkokogan. 20,000 acres but divided into two distinct parts. Both very good camps. You won't get much more remote than this one. Very good size and numbers, especially in June, of course, but solid all summer. Islands, points, reefs, current all plentiful. No private cabins on the system. Only the two camps I mentioned above, seven cabins in each. Good luck! Let me know if you want more detailed information. Been going there for over 20 years."

5348809,dkrusin,2017-02-22 07:52:00,97,"Out group has been going to Basket Lake Camp the past 6 years. We also got tired of the ""big water"". It is a small lake 10 miles from tip to tip with excellent walleye and northern fishing.You have to bring your own boat and do your own cooking and is very reasonable. The only problem is it is very hard to get in. Most people have been going there for 20 plus years and not many opening. You could send Anita an email and see if she has openings or get put on a waiting list."
5348857,FishFry2012,2017-02-22 08:23:00,27,"http://www.therriensforestlakelodge.com/Great place on the Indian Lake Chain. Should check all your boxes, plus you can get into Bass, Muskie, Pike, and possibly Lake Trout or Perch depending on the time of year. When are you looking to go?"
5350633,adempsey2.0,2017-02-22 21:24:00,612,I would highly recommend that you consider this option. I went to Mark's Trident outpost back in 2016. We had a great week. The cabin was perfect and the fishing was stellar. Mark was great guy to deal with and his rates are very competitive.
5353393,wallydave,2017-02-24 09:27:00,2151,This looks interesting! I sent you a PM
5353625,The tank,2017-02-24 11:15:00,340,I would try the west arm of rainy lake. Try Labellas. Some good walleye fishing in that area and some big ones. Lakes not so big and open in that area the kicker is the smallmouth fishing that goes with the walleyes.
5381570,Shadow4904,2017-03-07 18:15:00,2,"Hi, if you have not found a camp, check me out at happycampontario. We can fit you all in, on a smaller body of water, great fishing, remote with all the amenities of home at a very affordable rate. We offer discount if over 12, hope to hear from you, thanks and take care."
5381794,Baseline,2017-03-07 19:31:00,3207,Where do you live? If you are within a couple hundred miles from Minneapolis go to the Northwest Sport Show at the end of March. There will be be a couple hundred resorts represented and the owners can answer your questions. Minneapolis is a good town for a long weekend trip.
5267441,wallydave,2017-01-12 19:25:00,2151,"This place looks/sounds great to me too! Hopefully pooch, will post on this lake. I know he has fished this lake for many years. Happy Shopping!"
5267505,gullrockguy,2017-01-12 19:49:00,44,"try any of the lodges on Gullrock , it is a relatively small lake with access to 4 other lakes, great fishing, the camps have a rule of no fish over 18 inches coming out of the lake, but most of the people i have met on the lake, can live with that stipulation because they catch so many fish they see the policy of keeping the spawning size fish in the lake, i know some of the camps have guest that claim they have 4 persons in a group that boat over a thousand walleye in a week. i personally know 2 guys that use a cliker to keep track of the fish they catch and in a weekend each guy has caught over 200 walleye. catch and release really works and you can see that result on gullrock if you are looking at booking , do it soon,"
5270338,north560,2017-01-14 09:21:00,53,"Not sure where you are driving from, but sounds like distance is no problem for you. How about Gow-Bush-Kon Lodge in Northeastern Ontario, still great walleye fishing and the lake is not so big that it gets too rough."
5270506,pale ryder,2017-01-14 11:23:00,1937,"I agree with prov1800. In fact I have been to Cedar 7 times and am going back this August. I also recommend the Indian Chain, where I fished before switching to Cedar. In either case the walleye fishing is very good but no so easy as to be no challenge at all. They are also big enough so you shouldn't get bored fishing the same sots over and over but they are not so big that you get wind problems. And they also have Musky, SMB and Crappie. And on either lake I will stay at Clark's resort. I have been fishing out of there resorts for 20+ years and never been disappointed. They run a great operation. Everything is in good shape, clean and ready to go."
5270770,zjgli86,2017-01-14 14:41:00,1,"Not sure of your location, but if you're willing to travel to Western Quebec you might want to consider Sasseginaga Outpost (sasseginagaoutpost.com). Located north east of North Bay, Ontario about 2 1/2 hrs. The last leg of the trip is 50 miles of logging roads. This remoteness ensures fishing success. Similar to fly in camps with regards to remoteness and fishing success at a fraction of the costs. You can even bring your own boat if you choose. This past season produced serval trophy walleye and healthy quantities of 20""+ eyes. There is a slot limit on this lake allowing you to harvest fish from 15"" ~21"". Basically, all fish over 21"" have a lease on life keeping the population healthy and improving your odds of landing a sow. Sasseginaga Outpost offers modern cabins with house keeping amenities. Some of their cabins are located at their main camp and others are remote outposts. They supply 14' & 16' boats with 9.9 and 15 hp motors."
5271370,prov1800,2017-01-14 22:00:00,5010,Catch you in august.
5271394,Boss621Ranger,2017-01-14 23:42:00,65,"Your group needs to look at Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul!! I understand you say the big water of Lac Seul bothers some in the group. Well Lost Island Lodge out of Hudson, ON approaches Lac Seul from the South/SouthEast end and the water is much smaller in this area with great Walleye fishing throughout. From Ear Falls on the NW to West side of Lac Seul you will spend more travel time across the ""Big Water"" but out of Hudson the water is still 60-90 ft deep in the channel but all the slews, dead ends and island fishing you just have so much area to fish and not having to be out on the Big Water, if you don't want to. We fish within 1000ft of the Lodge as well as going 35-40 miles up thew channel all depending on the day and this last year there were multiple 28"", 29"", and a 31"" during our 4 days at the Lost Island Lodge.They have quality boats for your guys on their own and they have top flight guides for anyone that would rather take the guided tour of Lac Seul. Walleye numbers are great and the focus of the aree while Northern can show up and add some diversity as well. You will not be disappointed in the number of fish, species, channels. slews, and smaller water area's of the Southern portion of Lac Seul.4 years of going to Lost Island Lodge and 7 trips and not one disappointing trip! Shane and Sam Hayes are a family run, family owned business and they will not let you down!!!"
5271858,pale ryder,2017-01-15 09:51:00,1937,Looking forward to seeing you again. We'll be at Northern lights August 19 thru the 26th.

5266153,That Minnesota guy,2017-01-12 07:12:00,8293,"Maybe you need to find a camp with larger boats? Bigger boats might make some of the guys feel safer. Otherwise just about all the lakes have islands, bays or places you can hide when the wind blows. Pull up some maps and search for camps located in area's that you don't have to cross large water to fish. Remember, most older resorts where built where the fishing was good because of the lack of reliable boats & motors. Locate your resort first and worry about the money second. A lousy trip because of a bad cabin, boat or location won't turn into a memorable trip because of price."
5266217,prov1800,2017-01-12 07:52:00,5010,"I hear you about rough water on bigger lakes like lac seul and eagle lakes.i guide on both of them and do not enjoy the waves out there.i do have a big boat and still dont enjoy it.i guide out of camp boats also and they are all mostly 16-18'.not many bigger boats available at any camp.sometimes you can go hide but usually not many fish.i spend a lit of time on cedar or cliff lakes.much smaller and fishing is great maybe not the numbers of bigger fish like say lac seul but who cares.there will still be plenty of 18"" and over and a much better chance of a 30"".cedar being the easier lake to fish.it also has fantastic crappie fishing.i would recommend clarkes northern lights.they have 17' boats with 50 hp.free bait and your cabin right in front of your dock.it is house keeping.4 other camps on the 17 mi long lake.they all charge extra for upgraded boats.i do guide days on cliff also.mainly for trout and incredible bass fishing along with muskie.also can access perrault lake from cedar but no need to go there.pm me if you need any info."
5266225,Guest,2017-01-12 07:55:00,0,"The places we ahve been had Lund 1750's with 40 or 50hp motors. There was plenty of protected water but the we have historically done better in certain spots. Well, that makes boat assingments difficult because you just never know when the wind will come up. We have guys ranging in age from 30 to 70's. Tough when the guys that stay close to camp don't catch nearly the same fish as those that travel. we like to swtich up boat assignments which then causes the rifts. Thus, looking for smaller water but the hard part is fiding the same quality of fishing."
5266249,Carnhzkr,2017-01-12 08:20:00,964,"You might consider some of the many lodges located on the English River. I don't have personal experience with these, but Little Canada Camp is right at Ear Falls below the dam. Further down, but both drive to, are Manitou Falls and Knotty Pines (I liked when it used to be called Naughty Pines better). The river system is not nearly as intimidating as, say, Lac Seul. You won't feel lost and don't have to worry about wind/waves.Also on the English are Caribou Falls Lodge and KCR Camp. These are both drive-tos north of Kenora. I've never stayed at either of these, but I have fished this water many, many times and can attest to the quality of fishing."
5266497,skindzier,2017-01-12 09:58:00,137,"I certainly get the big water concerns. We've had a couple white knuckle experiences on Lac Seul coming back in the afternoon after the wind kicked up. We bring our own boat and have stayed at multiple places between Ear Falls and Vermilion Bay. My favorite musky lake is Eagle. My favorite walleye lake is Lac Seul. We look at the weather forecast and pick one of those two or maybe one of the smaller lakes in between Vermilion Bay & Ear Falls if the weather looks iffy. Now, it sounds like you strictly use camp boats, so you aren't bringing up a boat(s) for that kind of flexibility. However, there is potentially another option. You might be able to rent boats prior to arriving in camp & lake hop like I do. (I don't believe any camps will let you trailer their boats, but might be worth a question). I looked into it several years ago & it was doable. I think at that time Nelson Marine in White Bear Lake MN was doing rentals & would let you take them into Canada - doesn't appear they are doing rentals any more based on their web site, however I did find this - not sure if they'd let you take them to Canada or not but maybe...http://www.fosterbrosmarine.com/rentals.htm"
5266689,MrSimon,2017-01-12 11:58:00,922,"The size of your group means finding an outpost will be tough. But there are countless drive-to lodges with decent cabins, electricity, and a shot at big fish ... that aren't on huge lakes. Plus, many lodges have access to smaller lakes if the weather is bad. I'm sure this thread will produce some good options, but spend some time searching through older threads. There are tons similar to yours with dozens and dozens of lodges listed."
5266745,Obabikon,2017-01-12 12:22:00,2370,"I know we aren't a drive in lodge, but we are in a pretty sheltered portion of Lake of the Woods. We're also located right next to Miles Bay... which is one of the best walleye areas on the entire lake. We just built a brand new housekeeping cabin with 6 bedrooms that sleeps 12 (and really could sleep up to 14). We have 24 hour power now, internet, and pretty much everything else you'd want. Otherwise, I'm sure there are some great options out there for drive in smaller lakes."

5267433,packpro,2017-01-12 19:22:00,695,"North Star Lodge on Clay Lake checks all of your boxes. Only resort on a 17 mile stretch of river. There is another boat dock on the very far end of the river that services Big Canon lake Lodge, but if you drive up there you will be passing lots of good fishing. Two brothers own the camps. Very well run. Big cabins, many of them are duplexes with long deck on the front. May work for your large group. Bring your own boat or use theirs. Big dock with charging capabilities. Lots of bays if the weather kicks up. Walleye, Pike, and smallmouth. Housekeeping or American Plan."
