6184913,brad34,2018-05-10 14:35:00,892,"As already stated, blueberries that were grown in Canada should be fine to bring back.Citrus is not permitted because it is a tropical fruit and was obviously not grown in Canada. Even if you brought it into Canada from the US and then back again, it is too hard to prove, so they just confiscate it. The growing seasons can also come into play for fruits and vegetables that Canada does grow. If you are trying to cross with fresh grapes in February, you probably aren't going to succeed (legally).Edit: to answer the original question, you are required by law to declare food products when entering. So yes, you have been in the wrong the last 3 years."
6185145,Guest,2018-05-10 17:29:00,0,"I should have mentioned earlier that I have always declared my crap load of blueberries. In addition, a second vehicle in our group usually has 3 to 4 gallons. The only problem we've ever had was when one of the guys had an orange."
6187209,Lake Of The Woods,2018-05-11 15:11:00,124,"Poaching Canadian blueberries is a Federal Offence and one can face charges anywhere from 6 months hard snow shovelling labour to 1 year hard labour at a Federal Blueberry Picking Correctional Institution. I lived in the Kenora area for 15 years and have transported oodles of blueberries over the border to the USA and then back into Canada to family down in southern Ontario when visiting. Never asked by Customs Officers on either side if I was bringing fruit into the USA or Canada,... hey, if they don't ask I'm not going to provide them a list. I would have thought Customs would be more concerned if people had a firearm or drugs in their possession when crossing the borders. I find the confiscation of blueberries from vacationers to be ridiculous and unnecessary. Now, if someone is running a major blueberry smuggling Cartel,...well, that's a different story, lol."
6187249,pjshorthorn,2018-05-11 15:34:00,5654,"I think it is also disappointing to know that 12-15 gallons of blueberries, transported into the US ,have now deprived the black bears of many meals of their main forage foods. PjShorthorn"
6180642,sheepman,2018-05-08 18:11:00,98,We've brought them back for 3 years and never declared them at the border are we in the wrong?
6180802,pjshorthorn,2018-05-08 19:36:00,5654,"So the answer to your question is......I'm not sure. But, I will share this story that may give you a perspective of how the US Border Agents may handle the scenario. A few years ago we bought our groceries for the trip and transported them across into Canada without issue. On the way home, we kept items that could be used by group members at home instead of throwing them out. One of the items we kept were some red bell peppers. At the US border, we were asked if we had any fruit or vegetables. We said yes, we have some bell peppers that we brought into Canada from the US and did not use them all so we were just bringing them back with us. Off to the side the vehicle goes so an agent can inspect the cooler. No keeping the peppers....had to throw them out. The kicker is that the peppers were grown in Canada ( stickers on the peppers said so), transported to a grocery store in the US for sale, bought by us, transported back to Canada for the trip and then thrown out even though it was a product of Canada......LOL. My guess is that if you were inspected, they would be interested in the blueberries and you would be required to throw them out without further issue. But, that is a guess on the without further issue aspect. PjShorthorn"
6181034,rnnonmt,2018-05-08 20:50:00,992,You are allowed to bring back mosquito bites and fish. (with a proper license of course).
6181042,Wall-i-Lama,2018-05-08 20:52:00,1524,"I'm a convicted orange and onion smuggler . Did the same as you described with the onions. USDA guy at border asked if we had any citrus. I said no. He asked if he could come aboard and check our fridge. I said no problem. He got in the fridge, then held up a full bag of oranges that were in the crisper and said ""hey, you have citrus,"" Without hesitation I said, are oranges citrus? . Didn't know wife had bought a second bag while in Canada. He laughed and said he had to keep them."
6181402,lotsoffish1,2018-05-09 06:08:00,49,I emailed this question to the border patrol and I got a one word reply:NO!
6181410,Freytown,2018-05-09 06:15:00,770,Anything that has seeds which can germinate and grow will never be allowed into the USA. Declared that I had green pepper which I brought into Canada and was bring back but was told NO.
6181562,Guest,2018-05-09 07:18:00,0,Five years ago I asked at the crossing in I-Falls about bringing blueberries into the U.S.. I was told it is okay but the agriculture officer may want to inspect them. Since that time I have brought back nine to eleven gallons each year without any problems.
6184593,123chadder,2018-05-10 11:53:00,429,thats a crap load of blueberries!
6184721,Carnhzkr,2018-05-10 12:41:00,964,"Where would a person obtain 10 gallons of blueberries? It wasn't until a few years ago that I picked and brought home about a quart and realized how awesome wild blueberries are in pancakes and muffins. They don't even compare to store bought. I remember seeing Amish or Mennonite women selling them on a corner in Fort Frances one time, but I've never seen them since. I don't think I'd go for 10 gallons, but I'd love to pick up a few quarts on my way home."
6184897,sheepman,2018-05-10 14:25:00,98,We get ours at Dutchies in Perrault Falls
