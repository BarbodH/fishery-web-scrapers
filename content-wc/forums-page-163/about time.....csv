6179297,rnnonmt,2018-05-08 08:28:00,992,Heading to the mighty Lac Seul again in June. Trip #27-ish or so. Ive been on a couple year non fishing hiatus recently because of work being too demanding and I had to stay away from this group so I wouldnt suffer from depression lol. Maybe I will see some of you knuckleheads up there June 9th-16th. Will be staying at Abrams and trailering to Deception.
6179594,pjshorthorn,2018-05-08 12:32:00,5654,Wait. What? How? Where? What? This really can't be Brian making a return appearance on WC. Hope you have been doing well and surviving the rebuilding process at work. Good to hear that you guys are going to be able to get back to LS. Look forward to seeing some of your vids and Trip reports again. Just a heads up....things have gotten a little weird on WC since you have last visited. Jimirjr' s love for blow up animals on fishing trips has kinda rubbed off on me. My new friend Peanut made this past weekend's fishing trip with me. PjShorthorn

Im surprised Jimi hasnt had to buy a tire patch kit for his blow up animals yet! I'm glad to be able to put another trip on the books..... seems like forever since Ive gone. We are doing the same trip as we have done since about 2010 but no RV travel this year. The RV ""Lord Helmet"" has been retired and sold unfortunately so we are taking my Tundra and dragging the boat this year. Im betting we will get more than 5mpg..... Will catch ya later Im sure. I still have to try out Bens Bad *** Baits too!"
6180602,pjshorthorn,2018-05-08 18:01:00,5654,I tied up some slow death rigs too so I'll try to get some out to you before your trip. And we can't forget some beer baits too !!!!! PjShorthorn
