Was it as simple as you used what was in the boat or were there both in the boats? Really nice camp boats. Thats a must for these old bones, no more bench seats."
6161657,adempsey2.0,2018-04-27 19:10:00,612,"I am bad enough with two hands. One handed while holding a camera, well, we're lucky that I netted any!"
6161881,Mike Borger,2018-04-28 06:33:00,1554,"At first we used my cradle, but it was a huge struggle in the heavy wind and waves. So the next couple of days we took one of the big camp nets which was easier to use when you're getting tossed around like a cork. After things settled down again we used the cradle.You're right about the boats, they're great!"
6168681,Remi,2018-05-02 07:58:00,41,"I really enjoyed the video, wow big Pike action. Watched it on the home TV and the kids really enjoyed it too. I really want to take them to a fly-in some year. Right now ages 11 and 6, feel blessed that each year we do a drive-in with them. The 6 year old will cast for the big one almost all day long, while most of the boat is vertical jigging for walleye. Keep up your passion for sharing videos, love it!"
6192593,Lake Of The Woods,2018-05-14 18:26:00,124,"Yes Sir, great video... there is unbelievable fishing when traveling that far north due to low fishing pressure on an annual basis.Back in the mid to late eighties when I was working for the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources as a Forest Fire Fighter I spent over two weeks on Big Trout Lake which is about 65 miles northeast of North Caribou Lake. We were protecting the community that is present on the northeast part of the lake from a threatening fire. Our crew of five were stationed on the north end fire line where we set up camp. Into the second week when things settled down fire wise and the work day shortened from 12-14 hour days to around 8 hours we had the opportunity to fish the lake each evening for a couple of hours. Many of us always had a retractable rod and a few lures tucked away in our survival backpack,(as well a a 40 ouncer or beer of choice that the office folk never new about). Some of the best fishing I have ever experienced in northwestern Ontario was at Big Trout Lake and many others that were very remote while fighting fires. We would get helicoptered in to these extremely remote regions surrounded by no name lakes of all shapes and sizes which of most held very healthy stocks of various species. You could throw anything at them and they would hit it,... including a bird feather on a jig! Oh, another interesting fact. It was mid-June when on Big Trout Lake and when digging into the soil to construct a latrine we hit permafrost under the moss about 18 inches down,... which of course we utilized to help keep the beer cool!"

The full report should be done soon, but in the meantime I recently pieced together this lengthy video of the trip.I've never claimed to be a professional videographer, so my apologies in advance for the wind noise and rain on the lens at times. (we faced some pretty nasty weather )Cheers,Mikehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkwNCtHvFfs"
