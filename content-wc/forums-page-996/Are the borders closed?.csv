514886,Guest,2001-09-12 20:12:00,0,must be why the casey's here stayed at 1.62
514887,Dave,2001-09-13 05:19:00,258,Anybody know how long the wait is at International Falls? I can't beleive it would be 4 hours like in Detroit/Windsor.
514888,Xplorer,2001-09-13 08:28:00,244,"Dave, Although it may not be 4 hours give yourself at least 2. My inlaws left today to do the ""circle tour"" around Lake Superior. They were told to expect delays at Sioux Ste Marie and reentering Minnesota at Pigeon River (thunder bay). They are towing a new 5th-wheel (first trip) and were told they should plan on being searched thoroughly both ways. Understandable/mandatory given the circumstances. XplorerPS: Gas here in Duluth is @ 1.79/gallon, same as it has been, and was 1.62 in Virginia, MN last sunday."
514889,Frank_Walsh,2001-09-13 14:31:00,28,"I just got off the telephone with the Sprague office of Canada Customs. The only difference at this time, is that you can expect to be more thoroughly searched than normal, and that everyone should have a photo ID. Passports are not required as has been rumored. The wait will be slightly longer. but not incredibly.At the phone-in station at Cyclone Island, the only new requirement that I have experienced, was that a drivers license or Social Security number be given."
514875,Dave,2001-09-11 08:22:00,258,"At a terrrible time like this it is hard to think about a fishing trip to Canada, but we have a lot invested in our trip which is scheduled to start Friday. Is the border closed atInt'l Falls? It would not surprise me. Please say a prayer for all the innocent victims and while you are doing that say a prayer for the people who are responsible because I hope we have the courage to send them to a horrible death."
514876,Guest,2001-09-11 08:29:00,0,The US border may be closed but the Canadian border is open. All of your flights still in the air at the time of the attack were diverted to Canadian airports.
514877,Peanut,2001-09-11 09:01:00,929,"I'd call to check before leaving. All Int'l flights invound to the USA have been diverted to Canadian Airports, and all other departures from EVERY Canadian Airport have been cancelled. I don't know what effect this all will have on ground travel. If anyone can find a number for these guys to call re: the border crossing, please post it.derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"
514879,Guest,2001-09-11 10:37:00,0,The boarders here in North Dakota are still open.
514878,Peanut,2001-09-11 10:38:00,929,"Dave, this is not confirmed, but I just heard that the Canada/US border is closed to all traffic, both ways. So, definitely call ahead before you try to cross.derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"
514880,bigfish1965,2001-09-11 10:49:00,3210,"All borders into Canada are still open. However, no flights are leaving here. We are taking all flights originally bound for the US. Getting into Canada will take a bit longer, as you can imagine. Our border is on high alert in the event that terrorists try to escape into Canada. Bring a ton of ID with you, including passports if you have one. Expect long delays. We here in Canada have been watching with horror what has happened to your country. Our thoughts are with you and our sympathy to those who may have lost love ones."
514881,Guest,2001-09-12 06:10:00,0,does anybody have a phone number to call to find out if the borders are closed at international falls. we have two problems in trying to leave for canada. 1. is the border closed and 2. what is the price of gas thru wisconsin and minnesota and for that matter in canada?. it seems hard to believe that we have people out there that would take advantage of this and start price gouging the public on gas. i hope they burn in #####. pepe
514882,Guest,2001-09-12 07:08:00,0,"THE BORDERS ARE OPEN. i just called the u.s. customs at international falls they said the borders are open, but you will have some delay crossing into canada because of the security. the phone number is 1-218-283-2541 for the u.s. customs. and the phone number that i was given for the canadian customs was 1-807-274-3655. i did not call them because the lady i talked to said they were open. i still think it would be a good idea to bring a lot of I.D. along. god bless america and canada at a time like this i think we all should all pray!! pepe."
514883,Hunter,2001-09-12 15:23:00,346,"Border from detroit- windsor is open. taking upwards of 4 hours to get across, thats just the border. The highway has about 20 miles of trucks backed up along it on the canadian side waiting to get to the U.S. and they are not moving. Vehicles are being searched on both sides of the border, going both ways. If you go, bring a lunch and plenty of I.D. Just remember there is a good reason behind it."
514884,BD,2001-09-12 17:20:00,739,There was a big oil company in the Appleton Wis. area that raised its prices to $2.99 gal. The prices went back down in a hurry when they got busted for gouging. The state boys were on their toes and nailed the stations that were raping the consumers. The prices I have seen are running $1.69 to $1.79 for regular unleaded.
