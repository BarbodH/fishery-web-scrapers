513851,Guest,2001-09-17 07:38:00,0,"Well Done,I've never fished with frogs before, let alone tried for Walleye. I'll add that to my arsenal of tricks.Hey, have you fished Big Whiteshell lately. I'm heading out there on Sunday for a day of fishing. I haven't been there since last October when we cleaned up on Walleye in that small bay just before you get into Little Whiteshell. I've also heard that the bay to the Crow Duck portage can be good.I'm also thinking of trying Whitemouth Lake. Any word on that lately?"
513852,Guest,2001-09-17 13:51:00,0,"Whitemouth Lake is still really good, from what I hear. No news on Big Whiteshell, have not been able to spend time there this year. Last summer I was there 4/5xx abd we did really well, even with all the high water. Call Big Whiteshell Lodge and ask !Good luck and post your news !"
513843,Guest,2001-07-17 11:44:00,0,Its true. The natives netted it out two winters ago. Natives have special priviliges that allow them to rape any natural resource without repercusions. All natives receive lifetime exceptions.
513844,Guest,2001-07-20 05:54:00,0,"Very Unfortunate, especially since this is a stocked lake - I mean Christ we've paid for these fish. Hey if its a natural population you can make the case for native fishing rights but not under these conditions and in a Provincial Park to boot - too bad."
513845,River_eye,2001-07-23 13:41:00,1486,"Hello.The lodge that I guide at flies into CD once and a while, so I was guiding there this past Friday. The fishing was fairly slow, compared to normal. The fishing is affected by the wind and sunlight, and when it's a bright, calm day, the fishing slows down somwhat.On average, the fishing has been extremely good for us the last couple months. Two years ago, guys would go in there and catch lots of master anglers, now there aren't as many. Most of the fish are between 20-24"".When it's calm, the best place to look for them is in the weeds.Personally, I don't like guiding on the lake. It seems like fishing in an aquarium to me.River eye"
513846,Guest,2001-07-24 12:29:00,0,"Great information, thank you to all. Does someone have specific areas to tell about. Last year we had alot of action in Dark Bottom Bay and when we told Bill and Nick they were very surprised to hear that this area was producing fish (mid-August). Also the Gull islands area in 18' of water produced fish.I would be happy to hear your success stories !"
513847,Guest,2001-07-26 15:24:00,0,"I've fished Crow Duck many times and have always had my best luck trolling gold ripsticks between Big Island and the tiny island on the west side of it. Enjoy your trip, Bill, Nick, and the whole crew are great people."
513836,Guest,2001-07-31 18:03:00,0,"Returned Friday after 1 week at Crowduck. Six good anglers and we got lots of 20 to 24 inch eyes; only two fish touched master angler award size (28""). This is not the Crowduck of yore.I know things never stay the same; if its true abot the Indian netters what a shame.Our US Indians now collect cash from the Indian operated casinos and don't do the springtime spearing of musky and walleye that caused a stir in the past.How can I find out more about netting at Crowduck? Would archives of a major Manitoba cover such news?"
513837,Guest,2001-08-01 09:07:00,0,"There have been a number of rumors regarding significant domestic netting on Crowduck Lake over the past several years. Through discussions with the lodge operator, investigations by officers and data collected as part of the monitoring program, there is no evidence to date that any netting occurred. These rumors are unfounded and have only caused anglers unnecessary concern and have unfairly labeled First Nations people as being unresponsible. I trust that this clarifies the situation. Thank you.Carl L. WallAngling Program ManagerManitoba ConservationFisheries Branch"
513848,Guest,2001-08-13 08:56:00,0,"Well our trip to CD has happened. We caught 133 walleyes with 3 guys, the largest was 26 3/4"" caught on a frog. We battled high winds NW 60KM + along with rain and big waves, up to 6 ft rollers.Finally in the early PM we nailed down a pattern, and consistently caught double and triple headers. Frozen minnows tipped on jigs worked well also, but the action came on jigs tipped with frogs.Word has it that a 19"" smallie was caught a the reef near Dark Water Bay.Never before have I witnessed 22""+ walleyes tail walking' as you would expect from smallies.A great trip over for another year !"
513849,Guest,2001-09-14 11:28:00,0,"Hey Rainman,What kind of frogs were you using?"
513850,Guest,2001-09-17 05:24:00,0,"Went to the weed bays and scoooped them up. Toads and frogs, there were lots of them."
513831,Guest,2001-07-11 11:06:00,0,"Off to the walleye 'mecca' in a couple of weeks. I would be happy to hear from anyone who has fished there recently, also any good spots and presentation. I heard they increased prices to $60/person, I think its still worth the trip !Thanks,"
513832,Guest,2001-07-12 03:34:00,0,"My Buddy is a guide there and he say's its not the trophy lake it once was. The owner thinks the big one's all died. Probably from the slot size being depleted and now that it's their turn to be the trophy's theres not enough of them.Don't get me wrong you'll catch ton's of 25-26""'s but you'll have a tough time for trophy's.Although the pike fishing is awesome!Good luck, and post a meesage when u get back let us know, Maybe buddy's bs'ingRIP SOME LIP!"
513833,Guest,2001-07-12 07:21:00,0,Do you know how the fishing is on the lakes that you can portage to from Crowduck? Or how about the lake you have to cross to get to their portage? Thanks
513834,Guest,2001-07-12 08:13:00,0,Big Whiteshell is the lake you cross and reports are OK.Other lakes I'm not sure.Don't get me wrong again the fishing at Crowduck is good just not the trophy Crowduck of old 5-10 trophy's a day
513838,Guest,2001-07-13 11:03:00,0,"Hey Rainman,I'm in Crowduck on a regular basis. The bites good (ya like what else is new). We've been running bottom bouncers with spinners in hammered nickel and brass and trailing a nightcrawler. Plus jigging any old colour. Check any an all the usual summer patterns for hot sports. If you know where Bostrum Island is fish between it and the mainland on the North side.Have fun - you'll do great."
513835,Guest,2001-07-13 11:11:00,0,"I can't agree. Last year was amazing. We caught a number of trophies. And I know one fellow who caught three over 28"" one morning on the Aug long weekend. So....As far as the slot size being depleted,this doesn't make sense. It's all catch and release in CD, plus the Manitoba Fisheries are constantly stocking it, so unless there was a major kill in one of the stocking years (which to my knowledge there wasn't) there should be plenty of big'uns left.Now the weather has been very unstable this spring and I would believe that the fishing has been spotty because of that. It's only been in the last week or so that the weather has become stable. I'd say CD is as good as ever. Definitely give it a try. If nothing else its a beautiful piece of the world - you won't regret it."
513839,Guest,2001-07-16 04:46:00,0,"Hey Jack I don't question your #'s but I'm just restating what was told to me by a guide That works there. Yes your right you'll still pick up a few trophy's, but I don't know how long you've been going there but It's not the CD of old when you caught 10-15 trophy's in a fishing party of 4-6 in a day.Did you hear that the Natives netted it 2 or 3 years ago and that why the owner now blocks the service road going into the lake during the winter.This is not to say that it isn't still a top walleye lake, it's just a report from a Walleye friend."
513840,Northern Manitoban,2001-07-16 08:28:00,195,"I have always wanted to fish Crowduck,would i be able to take my jeep YJ down the trail in there?pretty sad when our license money goes into stocking lakes and making them a trophy lake and the natives as soon as they here about big fish they go net it.It has happened where i live also.Well for there sake they better hope i don't stumble across one of there nets in my trophy hole.FISH ON."
513842,Guest,2001-07-16 13:02:00,0,"Yikes!!10-15 trophy's in a 4-6 person day. Well, I guess its all relative. If that was the case prior to 4 - 5 years ago then the fishing has definitely gone south somewhat. But Jesus, 10 - 15 in a day. Good Lord, you'd figured you'd died and gone to Walleye heaven - Ha! I mean how could you ever fish for Walleye again?"
513841,gofish,2001-07-17 06:44:00,24,"Hey Northern Manitoban, tell me it ain't so when you say that Crowduck has been netted by natives! I can't believe the government would put so much effort into making this a C&R trophy lake only to see it netted.....and in a provicial park too! If this is actually true, do you have anymore info on this? I think we as fisherman need to make it loud & clear to our elected officials that this is completely unacceptable. Manitoba has lots of water that can be utilized for commercial purposes. But, this fabulous lake is only two hours from Winnipeg for goodness sake! Anybody else know anything about this?"
