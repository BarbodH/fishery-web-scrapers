514912,darcyfish,2001-09-12 20:05:00,15,Last time out last weekend caught walleyes in Yellowgirl on deep humps 30+ in about 35-40ft also in Sunset. Walleyes in Whitefish should be on deep humps (big minnows) as well as a big northern also. Caught a musky once jigging humps in whitefish in 37ft but for the most try humps 10-15ft.Good luck and may see you out lake!
