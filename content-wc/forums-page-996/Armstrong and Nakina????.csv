514898,Guest,2001-09-12 06:47:00,0,Am starting to think about next years trip. Any suggestions on a good fly-in lake and outfitter out of Nakina or Armstrong. Looking for four 4lb walleyes. Am I dreaming or should I look elsewhere? Thanks

Excellent trip. Good equipment. Well equiped cabin and boats. First walleye 23"" and it just got better from there. Going back tomorrow. Their website is www.ogokifrontier.comGray Wolf - Jack Kaminski"
514903,Frank from TBay,2001-09-12 10:44:00,312,Check out Holinshead Lake Resort south of Armstrong. They offer fly ins but the fishing at the lodge is awesome. I fished it in early july....hundreds of Walleyes in our group and a number over 7 lbs. they have a web site......just type in the lake name in one of your search engines. Good luck....

514901,Guest,2001-09-12 19:19:00,0,"I fished Pickett lake with Ogoki Frontier three years ago. It is a small shallow lake full of very small walleyes (12-14""). The numbers are tremendous, the size of the fish was very disappointing."
