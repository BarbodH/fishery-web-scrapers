We are concerned for your well being also now.Strapping bobles to your chests may help for a couple of shots but as for bombs....their preists use them...?"

514892,Guest,2001-09-12 06:07:00,0,"Have another one of those free beers. As for guns I still have all of mine including several hand guns. I just have to find the keys to unlock them when and if the time comes. This is a time for contemplation and stategy. We all have to work on this problem together including Russia and our european friends. If the taliban is behind this you we will need Russia to help. They have a terrorism problem as well with these guys. I was very pleased to see your president and Russias president talking.You might see a joint Russian, USA force clean up this area. This is not going to be a clean war if this is the case. A lot of men on all sides will die. This is also not a quick fix with a few missiles and a party afterwards. Pray for the rescue workers and the officers hunting down the men responsible."

One of the things you mentioned also has been something that has exaserbated (sp) the problem with Ben laden(sp) Ol' Slick Willy tossing a missle or two at Bin Laden and missing the target did no good. I feel his shoot a missle when I get caught scrompin an intern, then throw a party may have allowed/provoked this attack. Here is your legacy Mr.(term used very loosly) Clintler"

NATO style 49 answers 200 phone calls a couple of months, with the obvious answer unusable because somebody disagrees. Us Americans being ""run"" by NATO will kill more of us then ""Little brat bennie"" and ""Sad dam Cancerously"" by far.We have soldiers in the Pentagon and all over the world that do not need politics, their taught well with a gun and then some. Since war has less ""liability"" lets put the politics aside, it will save lives in the long run, if only the innocent ones.Saddam sells a large portion of oil to Russia and then gives the money to all those bigots, right back at Russian troops boom!"

Of these, Afghanistan was by far the biggest; it was, in fact, the biggest CIA operation of all time, both in terms of dollars spent ($5-$6 billion) and personnel involved. Yet it not only generated little controversy, but enjoyed strong bipartisan support. That's because its main purpose was to ""bleed"" the Soviet Union, just as we had been bled in Vietnam. Prior to the 1979 Russian invasion, Afghanistan was ruled by a brutal dictator. Like the neighboring Shah of Iran, he allowed the CIA to set up radar installations in his country that were used to monitor the Soviets. In 1979, after several dozen Soviet advisors were massacred by Afghan tribesmen, the USSR sent in the Red Army. The Soviets tried to install a pliable client regime, without taking local attitudes much into account. Many of the mullahs who controlled chunks of Afghan territory objected to Soviet efforts to educate women and to institute land reform. Others, outraged by the USSR's attempts to suppress the heroin trade, shifted their operations to Pakistan. As for the CIA, its aim was simply to humiliate the Soviets by arming anyone who would fight against them. The agency funneled cash and weapons to over a dozen guerrilla groups, many of whom had been staging raids from Pakistan years before the Soviet invasion. Today, long after the Soviet Union left Afghanistan (and, in fact, has ceased to exist), most of these groups are still fighting each other for control of the country. Besides tossing billions of dollars into the conflict, the CIA transferred sensitive weapons technology to fanatical Muslim extremists, with consequences that will haunt the US for years to come. One notable veteran of the Afghan operation is Sheik Abdel Rahman, famous for his role in the World Trade Center bombing. The CIA succeeded in creating chaos, but never developed a plan for ending it. When the ten-year war was over, a million people were dead, and Afghan heroin had captured 60% of the US market."
