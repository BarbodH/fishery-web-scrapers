It is encumbent upon us as sportsmen and women to help in anyway we can. On my fishing site, I have placed a page with links and info on how we may help. Please post replies to this message often so that it may stay on top of the page so that as many people as possible will see it. Link below.http://communities.msn.ca/BigfishCanada"
