514977,Homer,2001-09-17 18:35:00,1127,"Given the expected hassle crossing the bridge, we launched at Lake Erie Metropark in Michigan and made the (long) run over. We used to put in at Colchester Harbor. There's a wonderful launch there, and it's only 1 mile from the launch to the perch. That would also allow us to get our bait from Strictly Fishing in Windsor, which is a great place to get information."
