514775,Riceburner,2001-09-05 13:45:00,436,Sounds like they are averaging down again here in MN...Hit $60/flat -but now around $35-40/flat at our baitshop Flat=450-500 crawlers--but in dirt--have to be in bedding at the border. Nestor Falls Bait is 807-484-2401
514776,Guest,2001-09-05 14:36:00,0,"Just came back from Sioux Lookout on Saturday. Fishing was excellent! Brought my own flat of crawlers (480 worms!) for $60 plus $3 to pack them in ""bus bedding"". The Canadian Customs woman was pleased with that - no problem at the border.Local prices were C$3 per dozen - and they're a lot smaller crawlers.By the way, crawlers on 3/8 ounce jigs were the best way to catch walleye and northern. Fished Minnitaki mostly. Every single walleye we caught came from humps or ridges and only between 23-25 feet of water. We'd start jigging in 27-28 feet and drift up the hump or ridge and they wouldn't start biting 'til the 25 foot depth. Once we were shallower than 23 feet, not even a nibble.My red/orange color jig outfished the green or pearl 6 to 1.Also caught some nice fish trolling #9 Risto Raps over same structure."
514777,BD,2001-09-05 19:56:00,739,The Amish farmers kids near where I live have crawlers for $0.75 a dozen.Just ordered some for an upcoming trip to Ontario.
514778,Ed,2001-09-07 11:23:00,143,Paid $4.00 per 15 last week in Quebec.
514780,Guest,2001-09-09 11:04:00,0,$45.00 US in Nester falls. 500 worms to a flat...large solid crawlers.
514779,Guest,2001-09-12 03:40:00,0,"In Quebec $ 4.00 US ?????Tell me where and who the crooks are ?Some have mentionned the drought for the increase in prices.BS, here in Quebec the crawlers, at 99%, come from worm farms so the prices should not be affected.Man ! they really take advantage of every little thing they can.Some outfitters say they have to have them flown in. They always match their orders with arrivals and departures of clients, don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand."
