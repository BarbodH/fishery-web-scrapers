514869,Guest,2001-09-10 15:44:00,0,Our fishing group was thinking of going to Lac Suel next year and we were concerened about drive time and road miles. We would be leaving from the Chicago area. Thanks for the info.
514870,Guest,2001-09-10 19:23:00,0,"I live in Milwaukee and we go fishing on Eagle Lake. From Milwaukee, we make Eagle Lake in 13 hours(driving 75 to 80 mph). Lac Suel is about 1.5 hours farther than that, and Chicago is about 1.5 hours south of us, so I would figure about 16 hours. I would say plan on about 800 miles to get to Lac Seul. Also, if you are going to cross at International Falls, try to avoid noon on a Saturday! Hope this helps."
514871,Karl,2001-09-10 20:08:00,63,Ditto to previous message. It takes me 12 and a half hours to drive from just south of Milwaukee to just south of Sioux Lookout. Don't plan on that quick if you're pulling a boat though.
514872,Karl,2001-09-10 20:13:00,63,"One other consideration, I've made this trip 15 times now and pretty much know the entire route by heart. The first trip took considerably longer."
514873,Bert,2001-09-11 06:06:00,104,It's 870 miles from Chicago to Ear Falls (far NW corner of Lac Seul). Plan on 4 hours from the Canadian Border.
514874,Jigger1,2001-09-12 08:21:00,234,"We fish 42 miles north of Dryden on Lac Suel, it's 835 miles from Aurora through Milwaukee. Going through Rockford cuts off just over 35 miles and puts you in the 798 range. Driving home this past year we left at 6:15am, stopped in Milwaukee for about an hour and a half for a break and some food and we're in my driveway at 9:45pm. Drive time was in the 13+ hour range."
