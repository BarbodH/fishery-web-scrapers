I found the further downstream you are, the better the fishing. But that is only my opinion. The FrenchRiver Lodge is at the delta, if I remember correctly. There is a previous thread on the French back a page or two."

514759,Guest,2001-09-15 03:17:00,0,Why the French River? There are better places. I was there twice and found the fishing very poor(thats being kind). If you like scenery it is fine. Email me if you like.
