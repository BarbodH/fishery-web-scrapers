5651090,Bullman,2017-07-07 08:37:00,17,"Pat, I saw Gary a few times in the cleaning house and he sounded like they did very well. He appeared to be going more for quality vs. quantity."

(although, We always say that and get content catching Walters all day) It's fun KNOWING that You can get Your dinner in a 1/2 hour or so, 1/4 mile from camp! PAT was so helpful with info on some great spots to start... now we have developed a sort of ""milk run"" of Our own ! Oh Yeah.. PAT... The ""sheep"" is already packed !!"

5596169,pjshorthorn,2017-06-07 15:49:00,5654,"The regulations have become tighter on Lac Seul over the years. When I First started going the possession limit on a sportman's license was 6 fish with no slot limit. Now a sportman's license is 4 fish ,with a slot limit , and only one fish over 21"". A conservation license is two fish with one over 21"". I can also distinctly remember on my first trip in 1982 that we brought chicken wire and staples to build a holding pen for fish so we could cull fish throughout the week. We sunk it offshore from our campsite.As new regs were introduced, we were peeved about the lowering of fish limits and introducing a slot. The mindset was that the trip was already so expensive ,how dare they lower how many fish we can keep on our trip....boy did we not know anything back then What I have personally found since the slot was introduced is a much healthier and abundant fishery for numbers and size of walleye. We rarely caught big walleye back in the 1980s that I can recall. Nowadays, 26-30"" fish are every trip occurrences for most every angler with 16-18"" fish being extremely fat and spunky.So in summary, the regulation to have no live fish in the boat is a direct result of conservation measures instituted over the years to prevent culling. It has worked and I'm so glad it has. Being able to take my son at 10 years old and have him catch lots of walleye was a priceless trip. Wish I could turn the clock back and do a first trip again with him.Have lots of fun fellas. You are going to sleep really really well up there PjShorthorn"
5596785,fishmanric,2017-06-08 06:10:00,219,"Hey PjShorthorn, many of us older guys have gone through the same thing. My first trips up to North Caribou Lake with neighborhood friends was nothing short of a slaughter. We didn't keep any walleyes under 21 inches and pike under 35 inches. We easily filled our limits and never gave it another thought. I'm glad our way of thinking as well as the regulations have changed. I still see plenty of meat fishermen back home."
5596873,Baseline,2017-06-08 06:53:00,3207,"I've been fishing Canada to remember the no size and big limits not only on walleyes, but pike and trout. 35 years ago a trip to the north meant bringing back 6 large walleyes, 8 (8 to 15 lbs) pike and 4 lake trout averaging 10lbs. When the limits began to be rolled back I was just like a lot of guys who grumbled, but I quickly realized I loved the trips more than the fish. After all it's a fishing trip not a harvest. Several of the guys who were regulars on my trips quit going because of the rollback on limits. We haven't missed them. I fish Canadian Rainy several times a year and the limit on Rainy is 1 17 inch walleye per day for US citizens to a max of 4 in possession. For several years the limit on walleyes was ZERO until Minnesota and Ontario settled a border dispute about ""who knows what"". These restrictions opened up a whole new frontier of fishing on Rainy for me and my buddies. The restrictions on wallyes caused me to find fantastic smallmouth bass and pike fishing which is all C & R. We also learned about the suburb crappie bite the lake has in the spring and fall. We still fish for walleyes for a few hours each day and might keep our one fish each day for a meal, but we quickly switch to the bass, pike and crappie. Last year we discovered some good musky fishing."
5605641,Parkesmt,2017-06-12 20:34:00,1,"Gary,Must be a small world our group of 9 is from Rochester, NY and will be at Lac Seul Outposts from June 17-23. This is our 21st year going I believe. You will have a great time and catch a ton of fish. Make sure you pack a bunch of jig heads. Looks like you already got a bunch of good advice. When you get in don't be afraid to stop by our place (we are in the duplex next to water). I would be happy to share our experience with you. I believe that we have discovered every underwater hazard from 3 Sisters to Wapesi. Safe travels.Michael"
5630258,Bullman,2017-06-25 08:28:00,17,"Fished five and a half days out of camp using the camp boats. Six guys in our group. Caught a lot of walleye every day, most within 10 minutes from camp. There is a sand bar 1/4 mile north of camp that was holding a lot of fish. hit that each day and must have pulled over 500 off it. only one large, most in the 13 - 18 inch range. About as fast as you could bait up. First day we struggled using gulp. Switched to minnows and crawlers and it was game on. Biggest two fish, 26 in walleye and 36 inch northern were caught off the dock. We must have pulled in well over a hundred fish from the dock. Nice to sit down with a beer and fish. The mayfly hatch was going on during our trip in many of the side bays, but was not noticed on the main channel or lake. Many large northern hitting 15 - 17 inch walleye while pulling them up. Nothing stayed on long enough to slip into the net. Also had a camp bear running around that tried to break into the cabin. Got the screen off and managed to reach in and try and pull the garbage can through the window. Left a few very nice prints on the windows. Glad they did not break. Keep your windows closed when you go fishing!!! Weather was overcast and rain for four days and then sunny and very windy the remaining two days. Pecker Point also held many fish and was always a go to spot. We estimated that we pulled in between 1200 - 1400 walleye during the trip."
5650745,Iowa Hawkeye,2017-07-07 06:29:00,90,"Bullman, sounds like you had a great trip. We also fish the Chamberlin area, our pecker point is about 2miles straight west of the south end of Chamberlin, is this the same one you fish? Thanks"
5650817,Bullman,2017-07-07 06:55:00,17,"Hawkeye, The Pecker Point I was informed about required going North out of camp to the first West turn(following river channel), Proceed to the next turn heading North. It was on this point that we did very well. Active fish were on the upstream side of the point. We also did very well on the upstream side of the point list above going from North to West. The upstream side very close to shore was on fire a few days. 80 plus fish in two hours, two guys. Nice that you can get this action and still be able to see camp."
5650825,pjshorthorn,2017-07-07 06:58:00,5654,"I think he is referring to a prominent point that is north of LSO at the entrance of Wapesi Bay. Your point would be through Little Chamberlain Narrows and due north of Three Sister's reef, correct? I have fished that point in the past and it always held a few fish.PjShorthorn"
5650841,pjshorthorn,2017-07-07 07:02:00,5654,Good to hear that you guys had a great trip. That sand point just north of camp is killer for eater size fish !!! Has been since the mid 1990's when we stumbled across it trying to fill our limits on the last day. Did you guys fish south of camp at all down by Kekabeka Narrows or in the Brechin Bay/ Forbes Bay area ? Thanks for posting your report. PjShorthorn
5651058,Bullman,2017-07-07 08:26:00,17,"Went South a few days and struggled to find the spots on your map. Did find a bay with perch in it but there were too many walleye also in it to target them. The mayflies were having a major hatch in this back bay, so there were many fish stacked in there. Being a longer run down there from camp, we decided to concentrate North. I did hear great reports from some guys fishing Three Sisters area. Way to long of a run in a camp boat and way to many unknown rocks waiting for those without good electronics."
5593505,WIZARD,2017-06-06 09:35:00,7,I'm hoping we don't run into the Mayfly hatch or the blackflies...My luck will be both..LOL. Chance you take this time of year. Wondering on water temp as well. Think we're going to hit the hatch or flies ?
5593593,pjshorthorn,2017-06-06 10:23:00,5654,"We hit the mayfly hatch one year in mid June. Once over many many years. The year we did, we fished in areas that had more current and did fine. One day, we fished a fly pattern with a minnow on the hook ,to match the hatch, and caught quite a few walleye. Black flies and skeeters weren't a problem at the time of the year you are going, from my past experience. I'm going to guess the water temps will be in the low to mid 60s by the time you get there. Sounds like a rainy and cooler opener so far. Don't forget to spend some downtime in the evenings fishing off the main dock . Sometimes the best fishing spot. Have a great trip. PjShorthorn"
5593833,WIZARD,2017-06-06 11:44:00,7,"Thanks Pat ! You've been a wealth of info and knowledge, I will let you know how we do."
5594057,Bullman,2017-06-06 13:14:00,17,"Thanks Pat, I really hope we avoid the mayflies. As you mentioned, the mosquitos should be ok out on the water, but they can be quite nasty when you are looking for firewood in the woods. I'll have to give the dock a try one of the nights, if I can get out of the boat. Should be light out until 10:00 each night. I'll see you in camp Wizard. Mark"
5594633,pjshorthorn,2017-06-06 18:07:00,5654,"The good news is that you have a really nice wood stove in the cabin and they bring firewood to your cabin daily ! For shore lunches, pick the drift wood up on the shoreline. I never wanted to venture too far into the woods....I found where a bear crapped one time and that solved firewood hunting for me. LOL. PjShorthorn"
5595457,wmd,2017-06-07 07:54:00,388,We get our firewood off of a beaver hut. It is dry and easily accessible. wmd

5595529,pjshorthorn,2017-06-07 08:30:00,5654,"Gary and Mark, One thing I forgot to mention about the section of Lac Seull you will be fishing on is that all your fish in possession must be dead. I'm pretty sure that holds true for other areas of the lake system too. So if you plan on keeping any fish for shore lunch,dinners or home you must dispatch them right away when you decide to keep them. You don't want any flopping fish on a stringer, in a cooler or in a live well if the MNR were to pull up for a chat. PjShorthorn"
5596001,WIZARD,2017-06-07 13:48:00,7,"Yes PJ, I heard this rule and thought it kind of odd, but whatever, sound good to me. See you in camp Bullman ! Pic of my boat and new truck to haul it with the 1,230 miles ! Changing wheel bearing tonight on my trailer and just bought a brand new aluminum prop to change over as stainless is a gear buster! New nav chip for boat, expensive trip and I haven't even got there yet , LOL. Cheers guys and thanks for info PJ !"
5596009,Bullman,2017-06-07 14:06:00,17,"PJ, I had questioned this rule when I heard of it and was informed that it was to prevent culling. Not sure why this is in place for this body of water but not for the majority of other Canadian waters. I have a cooler packed to ice the fish down in the boat. Guess this is a good reason to bleed them out when selecting your shore lunch fish. See you in camp Wizard."
5510786,fldoc1,2017-04-30 09:32:00,69,"I have enjoyed reading the comments as I have only been there once the 2nd week of June maybe 4/5 years ago. You do follow their boats up and back, can make a trail, and they make some interesting paths through narrow, rocky areas. I would be going super slow and they fly through. They have good dock hands that will point out areas to fish without going very far. As the week went on we got to know some fisherman and they pointed out even more good areas to fish within a mile or two of camp.. They sold minnows and we always take worms as a backup. It did not seem to matter. I buy the US worms packed in a ground up paper product as one can't take worms packed in dirt into Canada. We had bad weather when we were there and the lake went up almost a foot. The constant rain did not slow us down. It was nicer in my boat as I have a stand up canvas top. At that time you park your boat on a sand beach so having some extra line to tie the boat up is suggested. They had a dock for unloading and fishing but not for tying your boat up overnight. I don't know if they have overnight boat docks now. I used the Navionics Premium Hotmaps chip and seemed to work fine. I always take it easy at first and draw trails. I found it easy to navigate. The fishing was great, and I would go back, except our group includes fisherman that need to be fiscally conservative so some did not go. We also have one fisherman that loves to cast and we did not catch many nice northerns by casting. The biggest one I heard about was caught off the dock eating a kids walleye. We also talked to a group that rented a houseboat and traveled beyond Chamberlain Narrows and they really liked that option. You have the option of paying for a driver to take the houseboat to and back from your preferred beach area which is recommended. PS - I am curious if others caught more and nice northerns by casting in June and what they did to be successful. (nice - 30 to 40+) Randy from Duluth"
5526858,Hunts1,2017-05-06 18:59:00,123,"The Navionics chips are good. Just check before you buy to make sure that it has the detail that you want and your unit supports. Regardless of any mapping software you get, it is not the things you see that get you but the ones you don't! There are many underwater hazards that are not mapped on Lac Seul ""chip"" that will disable you if hit at speed, even slow speed. We have been going to Lac Seul Outposts for the past 8 years or so, sometimes twice a year, and have had a number of props damaged and one lower unit rental boat damaged, even knowing where some of the submerged rocks are and going S L O W..... We bring in two of our own boats and rent one or two. Follow someone into camp and stay on their tail. Most of the mapping software will show you the channel where you need to be +/- depending on water level. That is good intel. Don't mean to scare you but if you rely only on the ""chip"" you could be in trouble. (Save your track in on your GPS so you have it for the future.) BUT, the fishing is incredible! We are going the first week in June and I agree with a prior post about fishing off of the dock. I caught a 27"" walleye there after 15 minutes last year. It is a great body of water! Good luck!Mike"
5527570,fishmanric,2017-05-07 08:33:00,219,My first trip there will be the first week in July and I will be going slow with the finger on the up trim button. The plan is to entertain the pilot to gain as much information as possible. I've been working on this for over a year and have some confidence in the information I have already received. Can never be to careful as far as rocks are concerned.
5527962,jimirjr,2017-05-07 13:10:00,1149,"Hi Rick ! I've found that the ""CHIP"" works pretty well for the main lake and bays, as far as submerged rocks and hazards like that.. Of course, when you get closer to shore.. I.E. beaching the HB, and the fishing boats, You""ll need to be cautious...Take it ""slower"" the first few times out, create a ""route"" that You trust, and You'll be fine...Of course, water levels will dictate what You can see or not see..."
5544113,Hunts1,2017-05-14 19:31:00,123,"I agree with everyone. I had a discussion with a buddy about water levels recently. We concluded that high water hides the rocks you can see in a lower water level situation but protects from the ones you can't see in a lower water level situation. Profound, Huh?! Get to know your ""passageways"" where you feel comfortable and can travel fast. There are rocks that will disable you and cause major damage far from shore, however. Not just going into shore. For instance, traveling south out of Chamberlain Narrows stay on the west 1/3 of that body of water. You will probably not have a problem at all. But, don't just trust your ""chip"".Have a great time!"

If you want to give me your email address, I'll be happy to do the same for you. Otherwise, I'm sure Wizzard will have all the info. with him that he could share with you when you are in camp at the same time.Most of the spots are no more than a 15 minute boat ride from camp.

I have stayed at LSO 8 or 9 times over the last 15 years,but have fished that area quite a bit since 1996. The time of year you are going is prime time. We made many a trip about two weeks earlier than your trip this year,but fishing should be about the same in terms of depths and techniques . PjShorthorn"
5380762,prov1800,2017-03-07 12:36:00,5010,You wil most likely folow someone from camp when you leave deception bay.be a good time to create a new route on your way up.the old canada map I have from navionics has a safe route on it that house boats use.ive used it and its awesome.the guys that work there can cut corners they know the way.so youll have nothing to worry about.always plsy it safe when you explore.go slow.
5396754,tandm,2017-03-14 15:46:00,679,"Having the camp provide a map and hiring a guide for a day is my best advice for fishing Lac Seul. Lots of lake and enough shallow rocks to make a fisherman nervous, but, excellent fishing once you get started."
5471306,Guest,2017-04-13 14:13:00,0,"Wizzard, I will also be up in camp that week. We are staying six days. First time up for us so looking for spots. They inform me that the dock hands can mark up a map and show the better locations. We will be using their boats. Bullman"
5472530,Baseline,2017-04-14 07:00:00,3207,"You can catch walleyes right off their dock. Wapisi Bay is a good location to start. Generally any decent walleye location will hold walleyes. Points with drop offs to 20-25 FOW, long gravel shorelines with a weed bed are usually good in the AM and late in the afternoon & reefs and rock piles all hold walleyes. The area just east of the camp is also a good area if the wind isn't blowing at 20 MPH. Lots of prominent points and small deep shoreline bays in this area. I don't think you will have any problem finding walleyes. Three are plenty of hazards, but take it easy at first and establish your travel routes. Have a great time."
5473474,Guest,2017-04-14 12:48:00,0,"Thanks for the tips Baseline. Looking forward to the trip. I have never used live bait in Canada and was looking for opinions regarding this vs. Gulp or similar plastics. I have always done very well with Gulp, but find that others that have less experience tend to struggle at first, until they catch on to the method and hit. We are also planning on spending some time tracking down the perch during mid day to bring back. I'd assume they will be up in the shallow weeds, but if anyone has found them in other locations, please share what structure to look for. I know you can always catch a few mixed in the walleyes, but never numbers."
5473546,David Anderson,2017-04-14 13:37:00,2073,"Gary,I have been going up there 2 - 3 times a year within the last 5 years. Used to use camp boats however now I bring my 620FS and so far (Knock on Wood) without any issues. One thing I recommend, and assuming you have some good electronics, is to get a Navionics Platinum map chip of Canada as it has a map of Lac Seul. Although the map of Lac Seul is not depth correct it has 2 important features. First it is water/land accurate so if you are laying a new trail down every day you will have a good record of where you are in relationship to the map, where you've been and how to get back safely. Second is that most hazards are marked on the map as an X. Not all hazards are marked and those that are are not all hazards however it is good to pay attention. The map will also have the houseboat routes which can give you a great idea of safe passages to the main areas. I look at it as pretty cheap insurance. As stated you will probably follow the camp boats in, that's a good place to start recording that way if you ever have to leave camp at a different time then the camp boats you can make it back by yourself. That's a great time to be there and as everyone states you really don't have to go that far from camp to catch all the walleyes you want. Chamberlain Narrows is the main channel flowing south so there will be a little current. You can catch them right off the dock or simply motor across and fish the other side. Just north of the camp and to the left is many points along the channel that can be good. In fact here is a video I took of fishing out of a camp boat across from camp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Yitm50mdCE&t=276s Virtually any point next to 20+ feet of water can be good, I am partial to fishing in Tuk and Pecker Point can be a good spot but get's hammered alot. I am heading up for Ontario's fishing opener on May 20th and can't wait! Plastics can be real good, I like bright colors like Cabela's actiontail 4"" grub in bubblegum/chartruese on a 1/4 oz. You can also read some of my posts about Lac Seul from Lac Seul Outposts on my blog: www.davidjanderson.blogspot.com Just go down on the left and find Lac Seul under the Labels and click it.Good Luck and post a report!"
5481834,fishmanric,2017-04-18 05:50:00,219,Nice video David Anderson. I'll be trying Lac Seul for the first time this year. Taking a houseboat out of Hudson and heading for the Holden Island area. Hoping for some forth of July walleye fireworks.
5486002,cuamb,2017-04-19 11:22:00,203,"Been to this end of the lake 27 times and have only 1 bent prop (knock on wood (with my fist not my prop)). Started before GPS and just took it slow. GPS has greatly increased the range of travel for me. I use both the Navionics Canada and U.S. North chips. Both have the same information for Lac Seul. Just be smart and take your time. You will be fine.fishmanric, pm me and I can provide you a couple of spots close to Holden Island to get you started. You should have no problems finding fish but it is a nice feeling to catch fish right away. Especially if you have some new guys along.Paul"
