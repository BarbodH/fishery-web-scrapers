Fishing was good and nice parking spots for the boat. We would stay in the same spot all week and just run to different areas with the fishing boats. Moving the houseboat is a pain and I'm lazy. If you know how to drive a boat and navigate, you'll be okay. If you don't, pay extra and get someone to drive the boat for you. You'll hate making the radio call that you're either lost or on the rocks.Have fun but be safe."
5639393,JHuheey,2017-06-30 06:07:00,70,"As I have never fished Rainy Lake in late summer, I would appreciate any information or suggestions members might have for fishing the lake at that time of year. I assume that fishing the grass/weed beds and shore line at that time of year would produce decent Pike, Small Mouth, and Black Crappie - but assume that might not be a good time to find Walleye - any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated. I'm thinking about renting a houseboat from Rainy Lake Houseboats and exploring the water on the US side (Krause Bay, Black Bay, Cranberry Bay). Hope some of you can point me in the right direction. Also would appreciate any tips on House boating, as this would be my first time."

5641345,The tank,2017-07-01 12:15:00,340,Can't see why walleye fishing won't be real good. In that area you'll be fishing points and reefs. Just a chance the walleyes will be a bit deeper.
5641689,JHuheey,2017-07-01 17:00:00,70,"Yeah, may need some boards if I troll, but you never know...I need to watch the weather/barometer/light conditions - can make a big difference in figuring when they are on the bite."
5642209,The tank,2017-07-01 21:36:00,340,I would start with bottom bouncers and worm harnesses. In gold white or pink. Find them than jig for them. If you find a bay that the wind is blowing in hard fish that and probably shallower. I've never used boards in Canada but to each his own.
5642649,JHuheey,2017-07-02 08:15:00,70,"Good suggestions Tank, on Lake Erie, I usually troll until I find some on the bite, then jig for them - in mid-summer they are often suspended pretty deep, so I use boards to get to the right depth - but I've never fished Rainy and may not need the boards if I find some fish in shallower water."
5643489,Baseline,2017-07-03 06:44:00,3207,"Late August and early September Rainy will have walleyes locked on the larger reefs and in large bays with deep loosely spread weeds. Walleyes will have a early to mid-morning and late afternoon till dark bite. Cloudy or foggy conditions will improve the bite. Once you find the walleyes you can be fairly sure they will be in that location during the duration of your trip. I usually use a jig and minnow fished very slowly and vertically. If you are fishing the areas on with deep water (70 to 90 feet) surrounding reefs sometimes the walleyes will pull off the reef tops and suspend off the sides of the reef and go neutral. Running cranks with riggers or using drop shots with cranks is about the only way to encourage a bite when these conditions exist. It is slow fishing, but I've caught some big walleyes doing this. During the mid-day spend some time looking for pike on the many rocky points and rock complexes found in Canadian Rainy especially in the Swell and Redgut Bay sections of the lake. You could also start finding crappies schooling on the sides of deeper reefs. The crappies can provide a fun afternoon of fishing and a great meal."
5644521,DaBirdman,2017-07-03 18:14:00,164,"I know each area/arm of Rainy can be different. We fish the north arm & Northwest Bay area in mid July each year (be up on the 14th!!). But we always hit the rock piles/reefs, islands, points and sand flats. Most of the fish we catch are from 10ft to 28ft deep with most of those fish coming in 12-16ft of water. Pulling harnesses is our favorite way to fish, but I've had good success pitching jigs or vertically jigging as well. Sometimes we get them along weed edges and on overcast or windy days we'll find them as shallow as 6ft. One thing I like to do when coming onto structure is do a little idling around to see if I mark fish. If I mark a fish or two, I'll drop the bow mount & work it. If I see nothing, often times I'll move on. However, after fishing this area for the better part of 40 years in mid July, we have a pretty good idea where the fish will be. This year will be interesting though as I plan to hit areas and structure I've never fished before. Sooo much structure, sooo little time to explore it all!"
5646633,JHuheey,2017-07-05 07:10:00,70,"Great advice Baseline, thanks for your service to other anglers. One thing that always impresses me about this forum is the variety of techniques everyone has for locating the bite. I'm looking forward to my trip north because I've generally found that if the walleye aren't biting, the pike, small mouth, or lake trout will keep you busy. occassion"
5646665,JHuheey,2017-07-05 07:15:00,70,"Thanks DaBirdman - another great response! I'd love to try the Northern end of the lake, but that will have to be on a future trip. I'm taking my Grandson and Son-In-law on this one, and neither of them have passports. It now takes six to eight weeks to get one, and we don't have the time (or extra money to pay for expedited service)."
