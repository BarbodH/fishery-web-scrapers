5622234,TheDFP,2017-06-21 07:08:00,39,"Father and I fished Lac Hebert from 10-17 Jun. First time on the lake. Fishing was good with biggest walleye @ 29.5"". Wind blew all week, but as the camp caretaker stated: wind = walleye. Caught fish from 5-25 FOW in jigs. Trolling was a total bust for us. Air Tamarac runs a first class operation. Reason I post here is many people going to the Gouin want road conditions: road to Parent was good. No problems. Road from Parent to Clova was the best I have ever seen. Very smooth. On the way out, it appears they worked on 2 culverts under the road. Keep an eye out of dark dirt. There is a little bump there. Make it out in under 3.5 hours with a Toyota Highlander. Outiftter and people I talked to at floatplane base said fishing was good on on the Gouin that week. Water is high they said and from what I could see flying over was the bush started at waters edge."
5623418,potsie225,2017-06-21 15:17:00,41,"I leave for Hebert July 1, our first time 10 guys. We are cabin 26 & 25. What type of jig did you use, best color and did you use a full worm. TY DFP, I am also a DFP Doug"
5623594,fishron,2017-06-21 16:51:00,317,"I envy your upcoming trip. You should have a blast with ten guys. Trolling for walleye is not the way to go on Hebert. It has served me well on other lakes but not Hebert. The type of jig that was introduced to me by another Hebert fisherman who will probably be in the same cabin you have the previous week, is called a knuckleball. Cabelas sells a similar jig with and offset hook that works well. Three eighths is about right. The hook is somewhat offset and does a great job hooking walleye. Color doesn't matter when the bite is on. The area around seagull island should be paved with walleye and there may be a trophy or two. The numbers and quality of fish is amazing. Have a great trip."

5628234,NY Walleye1,2017-06-23 19:08:00,13,Heading up the first week of August. Looking forward to seeing more reports.
5645617,Matrix04,2017-07-04 13:58:00,13,"Hi,Just came back from Lac du Male (Gouin) yesterday. Weather was awful (thunderstorms, very windy) during our 5-day stay.We found most fish between 17 and 23 FOW, close to rocky points, small islands or weed bed. Nothing above 24 inch, but lots around 16-17 inches, which I find is the perfect size to eat. 75% of walleyes caught jigging with leeches. Trolling with crankbaits that could reach 10-12 foot deep was working too. No success with the traditionnal thinfin.It was our first time with Air Mont-Laurier. Excellent service, comfortable cabin (with shower and toilet inside). The air base is located in Riviere-Rouge, so no gravel road and fairly close to major urban center (2.5 hours from Montreal or Ottawa)Water level still very high."
5653162,tweedrules,2017-07-08 17:23:00,107,We also just got back from lac du male. This was our 6th year with Air Mont Laurier and were very happy in the past. This year was a different story. We were supposed to fly out on 7/1 but the otter was out of the water because it would not start. They told us they can not fly us out because of bad weather but they did not have the otter in the water. We asked for a day's credit and they got all defensive and said it was the weather. We were also on the hook for the an extra night in the hotel. I realize these things happen and the weather was terrible this year but they really acted like we were the bad guys here. They had the broken plane. With that said once we got to the gouin all was fine. The camps are clean and very well run. Our care takers Danielle and louise are awesome. This was their second year and they take great care of us. Boats are spotless and run great. They help us with all our little issues. The Gouin water level is very high. We had a hard time finding places to have a shore lunch. Fishing was hard this year. Our normal holes were not as productive in the past. We did not limit out any days and only took home a few fish each. Fish were around 15-20 fow. We ate fish each day so no problem. Good amount of pike caught in the weed beds on spoons and trolling shore lines. I personally had luck with red and silver thin fins and an orange hot n tot. Every color jig worked. I used pink and blue. My partner used green. With and without plastics. All worked. We all used worms. No minnows or leeches. Weather was rainy the first two days but cleared up later in the week. I personally like the rain. It equals better fishing as long as you are not freezing. We are not sure if we are going back. We may try a different outfitter next year. We need a little time to digest the whole trip. Have fun everyone.
5653242,Andre (wallyandre),2017-07-08 18:13:00,2274,Just back from l'Escapade du Gouin. Caught a lot of walleyes inside the slot limit; mostly jigging and bottom bouncing in 25ft of water. The gravel road was a 6 on 10.
5655762,Freytown,2017-07-10 07:23:00,770,"Thxs for the reports guys. The Gouin is the best value $$$$ in Quebec. It's a fly-in experience but it's a drive-in. If you view Google Earth, the entire reservoir is circled by new timbering roads. Puzzled why folks would drive all the way to Clova for a fly-in? What ever it's their money. Trip number two coming in August...can't wait."
5599401,East coast,2017-06-09 12:58:00,32,"Thanks Kartman, I'm not trying to place blame and realize I am responsible for my own mistake. I have already written up a letter with all the examples printed, not to place blame but to help someone else avoid the same mistake. My outfitter did tell us to ensure we transport in porte-feuilles cuts and we thought we were with skin attached and both fillets attached at the tail (again my error). Not having walleye in our province or regulations regarding the cut of fillets i was probably too quick to assume i knew what i was doing. We followed the rule changes as they evolved over the years and supported the voluntary release when they existed. Losing the fish was a minor nuisance, but i understand the CO. The best that can come out of this is no fine and lesson learned and the chance to do it right next year, but its out of our hands now."
5601113,Kartman35,2017-06-10 13:47:00,245,This one came on a bottom bouncer with a chartreuse and orange size 4 colorado blade spinner with two #4 red gamakatsu octopus hooks on 20 lb Seaguar fluoro in 6-7 FOW @1-1.3 MPHhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z-C7QeuRhs
5603689,Tkjlmv,2017-06-12 06:39:00,4,"We just got back from cabins 40 & 41 at Plamondon bay. Fished 5 days from 6/4 to 6/9. Met Andre and his wife as they were flying out. Here are some quick updates. - Had beautiful weather. Sunny and around 70 every day (forgot chapstick w/ SPF - Bad move) - Water still up around 6-8 feet high from ""normal"" - Found fish mostly in 15-20 FOW. - We mostly drift and jig (orange or yellow seemed best). Trolling worm harness worked well too. I did well with Gulp minnows. - Best 2 spots were by the cabin and on the point that has a little grass island about midway up the bay on east side - Fish were every where (good or bad). Not any big schools but could catch anywhere - Fishing was pretty good. Not from the stories I hear for great that time of year but we caught plenty, ate plenty, and took home our limits. - A lot of small fish. Never been in June. In August seems like we catch a little bigger average size. - Largest walleye 21"". Largest Pike 36"""
5605585,tshea,2017-06-12 20:07:00,36,I have mixed feelings about the transportation problem. Although we are not heading back to the east coast - we need to keep our fish for at least 5 days before we drive them home - another 8 hours. I guess I will take more care ensuring that the fish are frozen in such a fashion that they are easily measurable. After spending the opening weekend on Mattawa Bay - I was somewhat disappointed to see multiple gill nets set up in the spawning grounds a week before it was legal to fish there. I wish the Game Wardens were as interested in preventing this sort of thing as they are about frozen fish coming out.
5616153,Freytown,2017-06-18 05:44:00,770,"You got that right....some here say that doesn't happen. And there is no slot for the Atikamekw 1st Nation, they do what they want, when they want...only everyone else practices conservation so they can gill net more for DRUG MONEY. Stinks. FT"
5616185,Freytown,2017-06-18 06:00:00,770,Fished Reservoir Gouin last week and had a great week despite high wind and cool temps. I fished at http://www.pointe-aux-dores.com/fr/ for the 7th straight year and it didn't disappoint.
5616273,Kartman35,2017-06-18 06:47:00,245,"My first reaction when I read a comment like this is to cry 'racism' as in just because they're natives doesn't mean they're necessarily doing it for drugs... However, there's a little bridge near camp where we always run into natives fishing, and one of them, when he found out we were from Montreal immediately offered us 100 walleyes in exchange for ""a bag"" of marijuana. Not sure how big of a bag he wanted, but needless to say we just told him we weren't interested.. Sad...very sad."
5616353,Andre (wallyandre),2017-06-18 07:29:00,2274,"The Band Counsel in Opitciwan declare the war against the pushers and the drugs; the one caught are ban from the village. As for netting you will be surprise on the numbers of walleyes caught in a net; naturally it's something different in spring on the spawning waters but after that they are no catching a lot; how do I know? Because I have friends in Opitciwan and one day we made a contest between netting and jigging; we won by far with our jigging rod.The band counsel doesn't agree on netting when the walleyes are spawning. They don't need Montrealers to get pot, they got enough growing everywhere around the Gouin.Until 1975 they were 3 commercial fishing boats on the Gouin"
5616417,Kartman35,2017-06-18 08:17:00,245,"The Reagan administration declared war on drugs when I was in high school.... Whether or not the natives from Obedjiwan 'need' montrealers generally to get pot or not...I am reporting on an encounter I had. I have no motivation to make this up, and there was nothing about our appearance that made us look like drug users...I imagine he asks any montrealers the same thing. Even if they are growing pot all around the Gouin, it's easier to pull 100 walleyes out of there than it is to grow and harvest a bunch of pot in a 'drug war zone'. Whether he uses a jig rod or a gill net is not an issue here. Only other time I've had contact with the natives was 4 years ago when we went to the grocery store in Obedjiwan. A teenager approached me in the aisles and offered to sell me 65 walleyes. Also any pot growing around the Gouin won't be ready until september."
5616497,Freytown,2017-06-18 08:49:00,770,"Andre, if this was done for food (substance living) I would not mind....but it's not, they only want to sell for money/currency. PERIOD.About 5 years ago my group went into a favorite baie near North baie and a gill net was stretch across it. A group of young Atikamekw's came out from their cabin where they were drinking and had a boom box on so loud it was unbelievable. They said we couldn't fish that baie until they took out the gill net. My friend told one they had 1 hr to remove the net or it would be in a thousand pieces. They took it out and left the cabin and gave us the finger on their way out. This is the truth and Kartman is right......very sad. FT"

5594721,Andre (wallyandre),2017-06-06 19:03:00,2274,I have a link of a short video that I shoot going on Parent road and showing how to use a cb on those roads; it's in french but I can explain: you got those small road sign with kilometers (in Canada) those road signs are to be use to announce where you are on the road so it makes driving a lot safer. Let say you see a sign with 43 on it and you are going north: you announce yourself as a truck at 43 going north so if there is another one coming south he will also announce itself so everybody knows that they will see each other in a very short of time. I'm also posting some pics from Baie Plamondon at Air Tamarachttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoBT...ature=youtu.be
5595065,East coast,2017-06-07 04:44:00,32,"Hey all, Just returned on the weekend and i can echo the comments that the water was the highest I have ever seen. The fishing was a little slow but i think it was due to the lack of warmth and sun that was missing the entire week. We still managed to catch and release a bunch over and under slot, kept our quota (story to follow) and boated 5 pike over 41"" with another 6 making the 39"" mark and hundreds in the low to mid 30s (we target pike most days, all catch and release). Now for the return trip. We left on Friday, cold (4 Celsius) and rain. About half ways out of camp, we were stopped by fisheries. We were all smiles and when asked if we had fish, we were all too proud to show them as we followed the rules to a T (or at least we thought so). Once the fish were retrieved from the cooler, we were told they could not measure them as they were in ziplock bags of 2 and the fish were not frozen flat, the tails were curved up. Now we knew we were in trouble. They asked to unpack the truck which took almost 1.5 hours as everything was in containers with zip ties and cargo straps. We were meticulous in measuring the fish caught keeping only those between 14 inches and 18.5 and releasing all others. They quoted the inability to measure frozen fish as infraction 1 (i'll mention that we also drive 18 hours to Nova Scotia and the walleye were caught earlier in the week, so not being able to freeze the fish means no bringing fish home). They then noted I did a good job keeping the tails and skin attached as per the ""porte feuilles"" requirement but pointed out that I cut behind the pectoral fin and not in front and thus that was infraction #2. That was my mistake, i read the requirements to cut in portfolio cut and keep the skin on but did not see the part that pectoral fins had to stay as well. In summary, they took all the fish and told each one of the 4 of us to expect a fine in the next 3-4 months ranging from 0 dollars to 100,000 dollars and that would depend on the mood of the judge. For a bunch of guys that have never had any trouble with the law and tried really hard to meet all the requirements, not thinking we did anything wrong, this was a real let down. The Gouin has been my passion for almost 10 years and this experience has me seriously reconsidering my future in an area of my country that I love."
5595225,octanehi5,2017-06-07 06:22:00,1104,"Sounds like fisheries,went to far,Its very hard to freeze fish flat.If you were not over the limits they should have let you go. With the new rules I only gut the fish then freeze whole in two gallon freezer bags works very well"
5595241,Andre (wallyandre),2017-06-07 06:27:00,2274,What a story about those fillets and they are a pain to do also. I know law is law but they should realize that you didn't do this on purpous. Did they give you a fine?They should just let go specially that you had the tail still attach.Thats is a real bummer specially that you were doing everything the best you can.
5595313,pjshorthorn,2017-06-07 07:00:00,5654,"Andre, that is a pretty cool idea about using the CB to announce your location on the road to hopefully anticipate oncoming traffic. I understood ""CB"" in your video....LOL. My wife and daughter would have understood everything, but not me !!! Did you gut and degill your walleye to bring home ? Is that a requirement in the zone you fish in? I haven't done that in years and it is some extra work to do so. Nice looking cabin you were at too. PjShorthorn"
5595401,Freytown,2017-06-07 07:28:00,770,"EC, thanks for sharing and make sure you tell your outfitter your story. Un-believable. You go on vacation to the beautiful Gouin and only take your quota and you are treated like a criminal. Was this the AFC Gouin or MFFP Quebec? Please follow-up by contacting both authorities, this could be a couple of ""bad wardens"" and they should be punished. Or send them to fight the ISIS terrorist. Don't give up the Gouin because of these JERKS. FT"

5598025,East coast,2017-06-08 16:39:00,32,"The fine I am advised will come in the mail and take 3-4 months and it will range from 0-100K dollars. Nothing like some suspense to determine it you are ruined for life or not. I will be politely writing the department to plead my innocent error and if need be, return to Latuque to represent myself in court for returning with legal licensed fish but erring on a single cut. Future (if i can or choose to return) fish will be frozen whole and singularly in bags (they were bagged in twos). For someone who is passionate about fishing and cares about the future of every fishery for generations to come, this incident is devastating and I would wish it upon no one. I will update the thread in the months to come with outcome. Good luck to all if your fishing vacation has yet to come."
5598761,Kartman35,2017-06-09 07:21:00,245,"Everywhere in Quebec where there is a slot limit for walleye (and this is most places) the pectoral fin must be attached to prove that you haven't shortened a filet. It's been like this for at least 3 years, and the Gouin has had a slot limit since last year.Your outfitter should have made sure you knew this, but ultimately the responsibility to be aware of the fishing laws lies squarely on the fisherman. Had the only problem been the frozen curved walleyes, you might have been given a break, but if you didn't keep the pectoral fins you were clearly in violation and a CO has no option but to write you up for it. Leniency or lack thereof is the domain of the judge whose ruling we don't know yet.If you were fishing in Ontario, and didn't realize that you had to keep a piece of skin on for ID, would the CO be a jerk for confiscating your fish?Having said all this, I realize it sucks and as a fellow fisherman I feel for your plight. You can try arguing to the judge that the english page of rules on the MRNF website only has directions regarding the pectoral fins in french and makes no mention of freezing fish other than to say that the fish must be transported in a way that allows for measurement. Hopefully this will help your case. If I were you I'd print up a copy of this page where it says: ""How to cut up filets with the skin fully attached"" and shows pictures where the annotations are all in french before they change it.Best of luck to you in your case and hoping this resolves in a manner in which you continue to return to the Gouin and elsewhere in Quebec.http://www.mffp.gouv.qc.ca/english/p...limits.asp#cutI'm not trying to rub salt in your wound here, but for those who are criticizing the CO that confiscated your fish, it is inconceivable that a CO would find fish transported without the pectoral fins and just say ""You seem like a nice guy, next time make sure you conform with the law"" and let it go. Surely I'm not the only one that can see this."

5592193,Kartman35,2017-06-05 17:54:00,245,"As others have reported the water level was higher than last year. Easiest point of reference was how far over we had to bend in the boat to not hit our heads under a little bridge. The good news was I found another spot to get my boat out of the water at the end of the week and was able to do it without a tow....might be able to go back Saturday of our arrival fishing was very difficult. Was only able to catch a few on slow death and they weren't hitting our spinners much at all. By Monday the fishing improved and we were catching as usual for this time of year on colorado blade spinners and my friends brother had a lot of success with a wally diver. Found a couple of spots where we were able to anchor up and vertical jig with leeches (My favorite technique) but most of our success came on spinners. One guy in our group got a 28 incher on a spinner with a split shot...biggest eye I've ever seen. I caught lots between 14 and 19 inches and a few in the low 20s. The weather was generally cold and lots of rain. Good news was no bugs yet. Never even lit a coil or put on any DEET the whole week. The gravel road (Obedjiwan road) was very smooth on the way in but the rain while we were there made it a bit of a slalom course around potholes on the way out. Would've been a perfect week had it not been for a gang of morons camping nearby. Blasting dance music on the water to the point that it was annoying at 500 yards away and doing the same at camp and acting surprised when asked to turn it down after midnight. Worse than that they left fish carcasses in the woods near where we camp (yes there are bears there), and even worse piling their garbage into a fire pit and burning it before leaving (beer cans, plastic bottles, garbage bags you name it). Trying to eat dinner over the smell of burning plastic is not what I hope to encounter on a wilderness camping vacation. Un-effing believable. Literally zero class. If I go back next year I think I'll plan a week later to avoid these jacka$$es. Still had a great time. Hopefully no one chains off the little peninsula we camp on due to the mess left behind by a few disrespectful idiots. If I do go back I'll report again Tight lines all Kartman35"
5592345,Buckmaster6532,2017-06-05 19:18:00,8,Many of the eyes we caught were over the slot and were cheerfully (and carefully)returned to the bay. Am I being accused of something here??
5592401,Andre (wallyandre),2017-06-05 19:33:00,2274,"Was at Baie Plamondon with Air Tamarac and again the service, equipment and everything was 1st class. Got a lot of rain, wind and even snow on Friday. Fishing was good but not excellent; Walleyes were not group in large number so we had to troll to some distance. Had 2 big meals and enough to take some home. Very happy to see a slot limit now on the Gouin. Also caught around 10 pikes but no size. Road from Mont St-Michel to Parent was perfect and with all that rain no dust; on a scale of 10 road was a 10. From Parent to Clova 8 on 10. Same thing for a travel back. Air Tamarac add some nice wood stove and they were welcome. Boats are sturdy Princecraft Yukon (large and deep) with 15 and 20hp. I had a 20 on mine. Where I was there was another camp and something to mentionne is the satellite phone in case of emergency or if you need something. My wife was feeling much secure with that phone available for us to use. Will try to post pics tomorrow."
