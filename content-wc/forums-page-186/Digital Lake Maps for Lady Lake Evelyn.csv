If no digital are available, I would like to get some paper maps. So if anyone knows the best place to purchase those that would be helpful. This will be my first trip up and my family will be with me, so any tips and tricks would be helpful. I don't need anyone's ""secret spot"". Also ff anyone knows any scenic must see thing around the lake, like waterfalls, big cliffs, etc, that would be appreciated also. PM's are fine if you don't want to advertise. Thanks ThinIce."

If you are staying at one of the four camps on the lake, they should provide you with paper maps and lots of information. My group fished Lady Evelyn three years in a row. The lake always gave me a couple large walleye, 27 to 30"" and usually on a storm hot n tot. We had a few blitz days usually when we fished windblown areas in coves or between islands. Lots of good sized walleyes but the 17"" maximum size for walleye meant throwing back many prime 18 to 20 inchers. I don't mind releasing the big girls but consider Lady Evelyn's limits too restrictive. Lots of bass and small pike and a very beautiful lake to fish."
