Usually we'll catch a few 14"" around camp but I'd like to get into some bigger ones nearby if possible. I usually range from Nestor out to Raspberry in the west, any technique tips would be appreciated as well. Thought I might try some rippin raps/jigging raps as well this year, would this be effective or too snaggy? Thanks in advance"

Like you I'll be doing quite a bit of musky fishing but also mix it up and fish for walleye to. Any tips or pointers on the area are appreciated. I'm actually more concerned about finding walleye than musky.
