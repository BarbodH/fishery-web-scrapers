I'd not say please, if you find that offensive, stay away from me. I'm betting it's not the first time he's done that. al"

4230442,rosh1,2015-09-29 07:10:00,275,Hooks. I know what you are talking about and the Red boat. We were fishing in Osbourne early in the season. One of the places that's a small area pulling bouncers. We see this Red boat coming our way and my friend says I cant believe he is going to stop here. He stopped right in our way and he and his 3 clients start to fish. We wanted to say something at first but kept fishing. As we would troll buy his boat everyone would look done and not at us. Buy the time they left we felt sorry for his clients as they knew what he did was wrong.
4230546,last chance,2015-09-29 08:07:00,3262,I think he's just part of the same 10% of the people that just don't get the program. just like the boat driver who got so close. when I was going through marine corps boot camp our senior drill instructor always said theres 10% of the people that's just s#@t birds. he said we had them there and that we would find through out life that there would be 10% of the people that just didn't get it. and I've found him to be pretty close. be it fishing or hunting or just driving down the road 10% of the people are jerks. I've trolled on erie for the last 20+ yrs and have had to give way to so many boats on my left I have lost count. but its always just 1 or 2 boats in the pack that thinks they have the right of way no matter what. I was salmon fishing on the st joe river in Michigan. we were fishing shoulder to shoulder. I got hung up and broke my line. I turned around to get the cold wind out of my face while I tied another spoon on. when I turned back around 2 guys had moved directly in front of me and started fishing. so I hsd no place to fish. so I just loaded up and left saying a few choice words as I left. they just ignored me and kept fishing. I drive an old motorhome and pull a boat. and I've had so many people pull right out in front of me and I would have to just bow up to keep from hitting them. but they just had to get in front of the motorhome no matter that I was so close to them. and many times I was running faster than what they did and they would hold me up. I was on Manistee lake one night salmon fishing. we had been anchored for a few hours. then this big 20'+ boat came in about 40' from us and anchored right where we had been fishing. we kept fishing as best as we could. I hooked a big 20# + salmon and it got around his anchor line. I started yelling at them but they just ignored my calls for them to help. I started letting line out when the fish would run. then would reel when I got a little slack. after about 15 minutes I felt the fish come loose from his anchor line. then we noticed his boat drifting on down the lake. when he got on top of some other boats they came up and pulled in the anchor rope. it had been cut by my 30# fishing line. they left and didn't come back. but the point is they was in that 10% that just didn't get that you don't anchor on top of another boat. I've ranted and rambled on way to much so i'll close with this. when you encounter the 10% try not to get upset because we all have to deal with them every day. and theres still 90% of the people that gets it and are not s#@t birds.
4230738,v-bay gord,2015-09-29 09:06:00,3168,"Part of the 10% seem to be guides or employees of resorts. Rather than getting upset I would suggest posting comments about the encounter on the resort's webpage. Better yet, how about a review regarding the professionalism of the guide on sites like Trip Advisor. I'm sure the resort will get the message after a few bad reviews leave a blemish on their record."
4231322,HeHooksHimself,2015-09-29 14:30:00,725,"Good life lesson Last Chance. I wish you werent so right. Gord, I wish I could identify the camp with which this guy was affiliated."
4231602,Obabikon,2015-09-29 17:14:00,2370,"I'm sorry, but I have ZERO belief that this person was in any way shape or form a local guide. One that doesn't know that there aren't rocks in an obvious channel? No chance he was actually a guide for a local resort. He may have been a guide from WI or MN that fishes the waters a couple times per year. However, if a guide behaved in that way... and used that type of language around MY guests... he would be instantly fired. Not only would he be fired, but I would personally call every single camp in our area... and inform them of his actions. Making a personal request to refuse him work! He would be giving himself, the resort, the area, and the ENTIRE LAKE a bad name. I just can't believe that a resort in the area would hire an uneducated, uninformed, rude guide with a bad mouth. So, unless there's confirmation of what resort he worked at, just because he had extra rods tied up... doesn't make him a local guide. Not meaning to rant... just assumptions based on next to no information is a bit of a stretch."
4231730,HeHooksHimself,2015-09-29 18:31:00,725,"I understand your point Obabikan. I don't really know who he was. What I do know is that he is a 10%er. Whoever he was, he is due for some karma. I am over it now, it is just another chapter in my book! As for me, 233 days until I am there again! Fish On! Hooks"
4231738,rnnonmt,2015-09-29 18:35:00,992,"Ive got to stir this one up a bit.... Most of the time I don't mind if people are polite and not right on top of your boat while you are trying to fish but I sure would like to have a set of ear plugs handy and have a megaphone or an air horn to communicate with the rude ones..... I'm probably more lenient than most when fishing in Canada because being up north doesn't have a fraction of the A$$ Clowns I deal with on our reservoir lakes here in Arizona. Combine big wake boats, rap music and drunkards and you tend to build up a tolerance."

4228210,go dart,2015-09-27 21:26:00,77,You could get 3 guys in there chunking Pike spoons and one of then inexperienced. When we ended up with three one time one rode in the guide boat and the other two paid follow boat prices. We rotated who fished with the guide and it was fine. The guide made good money and we were happy as larks. Times are a changing I guess.
4228266,Aspencreek,2015-09-27 21:49:00,2911,"Yes Dart, times are a changin'. You didn't answer the question, got a red boat?"
4228306,pjshorthorn,2015-09-27 22:34:00,5654,"So what is your point ? Seems like you have been incorrect in some of your assumptions throughout this thread. It is very likely that you are incorrect about the original post being a possible made up story. As a side note, you may want to do some more research on other threads within WC on guiding. One recent post was from a guide asking for opinions on boats that could accommodate up to 4 guests at a time. It was an important critera outlined by the guide. PjShorthorn."
4228474,Fisherman1792,2015-09-28 06:14:00,927,I guide and take 3 people quite often mind you I don't fish so only 3 lines are out. I also have a 20 foot (not red) Crestliner. Fisherman 1792
4228514,Obabikon,2015-09-28 06:46:00,2370,"3 in a guide boat happens nearly every day at our camp. We have 3 full time guides, and it seems one of them will usually have 3 in a boat for the day. It isn't even uncommon. Anytime you have an odd number of guests (3 or 5) it can be best to put the ""extra"" guy in with the guide. I have a family, who actually fish every morning (for walleyes) with a guide and 4 (making 5 total) in a boat. Its only an 18', and it is incredibly crowded. However, Grandfather, Father, 2 sons... they want to fish together. It is more about quality time. Our guide loves it, and says its fun to do something different. In the afternoons, they come back and take another boat for casting purposes."
4228578,HeHooksHimself,2015-09-28 07:19:00,725,"Well Dart, I am not sure why you are even on WC. For me, WC is a place I can go anytime and live again the two weeks of the year that I am there. There is something special about the camaraderie of people who can relate to your experiences and confirm or challenge your conclusions since they may have had similar experiences. At the very least, when they read about my event they are picturing in their own mind what that may have looked like. My point with this post was to identify the lack of etiquette of the jerk that I came across and to get confirmation that my displeasure was justified or to share similar stories, much like the thread on moving in on other people's fishing progressed. I am a story teller and I communicate on WC primarily by sharing things that we have encountered and to bring a smile or to cause my WC friends to relate. I titled the thread ""This Actually Happened"" because it actually happened and it was unbelievable. In this particular case, it would be similar to you and your family having a cookout in your back yard and some dweeb came barreling through your yard with his four-wheeler. There is traffic on the street all the time and people are close to your house. Jeez, just eat your burger and relax! The bottom line is this: If you are the overweight owner of a red Crestliner as described with a white beard and round red face and you guide people through Osbourne and Niven bays in Eagle Lake and you are unfamiliar with the water perhaps you might consider at least saying something like, ""Sorry fellas, I am going to squeeze through here because I think there are rocks in the middle of the channel, please excuse me."" Now, I might still label you a jerk but that is a much easier pill to swallow than what you did to Doc and me. Or maybe you are what we thought you were."
4228602,v-bay gord,2015-09-28 07:37:00,3168,"I agree totally with HooksHimself wanting to shine a spotlight on this example of bad etiquette. It happens way to often and unless we call people out on it this will only get worse. So it is a big deal to those of us who fish, or want our guests to have an enjoyable Canadian experience."
4228642,ftfarms,2015-09-28 07:45:00,444,
4228770,go dart,2015-09-28 08:40:00,77,Since you're talking etiquette calling a total stranger an a-hole as boats pass means you missed a real opportunity to educate him as you mentioned in your original post. It seems overboard not to of forgotten it within an hour after it happened. The 4 wheeler in my yard? Can we agree on a mild exaggeration? Have a great day Hook.
4228834,HeHooksHimself,2015-09-28 09:11:00,725,"I realize this will be lost on you, but the situation happened pretty quickly. It's not like we had time to have a discussion on boating etiquette as he slipped by. I asked him to go to the other side which unleashed a tirade of unrepeatable phrases. The a-hole comment was mild compared to that. If this guy was not you, it is interesting that you have indicated that perhaps you think this is normal. You would do many people a service if you would indicate when and where you will be in Canada so I can avoid being where you are since you seem to fit the profile. In any case, the thread has been worthwhile to me and if you think it is inappropriate or over the top feel free not to click it. That is unless you enjoy stirring the pot. Hooks"
4227866,fishinnut 3446,2015-09-27 19:25:00,638,Would that be the same dip chit that had a Lund last yr.
4228050,go dart,2015-09-27 20:46:00,77,Why not? The post seems exaggerated as well. I've never seen a guide take 3 in a boat so lets dispel the guide myth. You believe everything you read?
4228074,dutchboy,2015-09-27 20:51:00,5717,If you have never seen a guide with 3 in a boat you need to get out more.

4228106,Fisherman Ted,2015-09-27 21:04:00,461,This is not uncommon at all. We recommend 2 fishermen per guide per boat but if a guest wants to load up the boat so be it. A lot of times they all want to fish together.
4228122,go dart,2015-09-27 21:06:00,77,You're a guide in Boston? So are you fishing the sea?
4228138,Fisherman Ted,2015-09-27 21:11:00,461,I live in Boston in the off-season (September to May 1st) but own and run Hawk Lake Lodge in NW Ontario. -FT
4228146,dutchboy,2015-09-27 21:12:00,5717,"He's a lodge owner in Canada. Why don't you believe guides fish 3 out of a boat? Nobody said it is easy, but it's done."
4228154,go dart,2015-09-27 21:13:00,77,Then I'll stand corrected but I have never met a guide in Canada that would accept 3 in a boat. I would never want to.
4228186,Fisherman Ted,2015-09-27 21:19:00,461,"Happens all the time. 3 buddies go on a trip and want to get a guide for the day to get the lay of the land. Two guides would mean someone fishes by themselves. Plus if you are price sensitive that could also be a factor. Or a family would never want to split up, especially if smaller children. We also get a grandfather with 3 generations where dad wants to keep an eye on grandpa and his son and they want to fish together as that is part of the experience. Or if a wife wants to come along. I could go on and on. An 18 foot boat is plenty of room for 3 fishermen. I have seen it and been doing it for years. It's not like they are throwing fly-rods where space is critical."
4209370,HeHooksHimself,2015-09-17 16:13:00,725,"Doc and I were fishing a narrows in the ""river"" part of Niven Bay. We were pretty tight to the shore as there was a drop off and we were walleye fishing. A boat was trolling up to us with planer boards turning twice before he got to us. Another boat came within sight and the other one went down the channel outside of us by about thirty feet. The one that was now in sight had been trolling down. It was a red crestliner with a windshield and four guys in it. Unbelievably, when they got to us the driver decided it would be a good idea to go between us and the shore, about 30 feet of space. Doc and I couldn't understand why he would do that but when he asked, ""how ya doin?"" I responded ""Well, we WERE doing ok.."" He said 'That's good."" They continued to fish the narrows and when they finally disappeared we had lunch, did some anchor fishing, did some drifting, we were all over the narrows. We had talked about the incident and wondered what was in the guys head! As we had covered the narrows we noticed that the depth was pretty consistent, some rises here and there but the whole channel was very navigable with no trouble spots outside the weeds. We stayed there for a few hours and the first boat that had passed returned. At that point we were anchored near a rock wall about 15"" away from it in about 17' of water. The first boat passed in the middle of the channel and slowed down to not disturb us. We thanked them with a tip of the cap and they were on their way. We were still in the same spot when the second boat came speeding around the corner and cut speed as he came up to us. We had been laughing when we chose this spot saying, that guy can't get behind us here. Yeah, he did. At exactly that time Doc was pulling up an eye, otherwise his line would have been cut. As he got near to us I said, ""Whats wrong with that side?!"" Then I called him an a-hole. His eyes got big and he yelled ""Theres rocks over there! (there weren't) Then he yelled at the top of his lungs as he passed us and until he got out of sight a chorus of FU's, Do You Think You Own the Lake's and a variety of swear words, some of which I haven't heard in years. We left not long after that and I was hoping we would see them again, just so we could give them wide berth and explain boating etiquette to them. Now, I am quite sure this jerk was a guide since as they had been loudly fishing down from us one of the other guys got a snag and he advised him to cut it saying, ""Don't worry about it, I have plenty of rods rigged up."" So if you know a camp that uses red crestliners with Yamaha motors (75hp?) I would like to report this guy. I have a guess since I was told a particular camp makes the long trip to Niven Bay regularly. If by some chance you were one of the other three guys in the boat with this guy, I hope your tip reflected the embarrassment you must have experienced from this noob. Hooks"
4209530,Fisherman1792,2015-09-17 17:23:00,927,What an A-hole! Almost to bad he didn't hit a rock between you and the shoreline. If he was a guide shows very poorly on the lodge if he works for one. Fisherman 1792
4209538,Pikeslayer8,2015-09-17 17:27:00,1460,What is it with you and red boats? Hope you and Doc had a good time anyway and they nab him and throw him into fishjail! Heck of a story.

4209578,Obabikon,2015-09-17 17:53:00,2370,"If he doesn't know that there's no rocks on the outside of you, he won't be a guide very long (if he actually is a guide from that area).

Just so you don't feel singled out, some of my guests have reported similar bad experiences with a black Tuffy guided boat on the Vermilion Bay end of things. I know where that boat is from, but don't know off hand anyone who uses Crestliners..........but the same mentality, just idiots with big egos."
