Doug and Cathy indicated the fishing was a little different this year as the numbers were a little lower, but the quality of fish was much better this year. I found the numbers were about the same, but the fish were definitely of better size.The lake was about a foot low when we were there, up about a foot from the opener.Hope your trip goes well.Watch out for Turtles on 502, or you may end up with a flat tire as you pull into Dryden."

Numbers were down for us but size was better. Lake seemed to be a little low. I think some of numbers issue was our fault for fishing technique-- I think we often fished too deep and used bottom-bouncers rather than just a jig head with minnow/crawler/leech. Caught alot more pike than we did in August last time up there. We worked the bay across from the private cabin on the east end more than last time and did pretty good from a size perspective on the point between the two creeks that flow into the bay on the east side. Largest walleye was 27 and largest pike was 37. had lots of rain and wind, kept the bugs down though. Mission accomplished though, son had a great time and is asking when we're going back. Its nice to know I will be fishing more and running the boat less next time up"
