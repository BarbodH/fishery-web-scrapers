I was in Europe Swiss Alps & France the two weeks prior to Kayedon and kept thinking about how many days till I start the 19 hour drive. We arrived in brilliant sun, blue bird leaving Cordingly lake at 6:20 am. Our quick flight allowed us to be fishing Friday morning. We caught lots of smaller walleyes 13-18 inches mixed in with snake like pike. Good fishing considering incredible day temps 80's. Weather /chop improved Sat/Sun/Mon with some bigger fish lots of 16-low twenties eyes and couple mid thirty inch pike. Tues I caught the two largest walleye of the trip 24.75 and 25.75 although a lot of fish up to 22, 23 were caught. Tuesday evening while reeling in a 20 inch pike we had a gator try to inhale it. Tues-Weds fronts came through creating run back full blast to the camp followed by cards and 2nd and 3rd attempts to fish. A couple of the fronts were severe and had to give a newbie a stern - shelter from the storm dude rather than trying to boat through angry 3+ footers back to camp. He was with the third boat and according to the other 2 guys nearly went vertical again an again rather than safely sheltering on the backside of island. Weds I landed a 15 inch walleye that was inhaled at the boat by a 33 inch gator. Pike would not let go of the walleye and ended up in the net w/the eye. We never hooked the pike. We landed good numbers of walleyes with 3 gators over 40 and handful in mid 30 inch range. During the drive home less than a hour in saw a giant owl perched between Geraldton and Hurst - hmm Great Gray (?), had no ears tufts. I can't wait to go back. Charlie"
