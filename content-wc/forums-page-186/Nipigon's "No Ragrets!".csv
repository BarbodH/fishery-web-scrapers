Anywhere I was planning to go on the lake, any different sections and such, using satellite imagery and topo software I've been able to create maps detailing hazards. So far, after more than a dozen trips, I've only dinged the prop twice, and only once bad enough it needed to be changed. (backed into a rock while guiding a filming T.V. show host) One time though, I watched as someone's nice 18 foot Mr. Pike came back on a rescue donut. The front third of the boat crumpled like an accordian. Had almost crushed my boat at the same spot earlier in the day... Gotta keep your head up on uncharted waters and really, really play safe and plan ahead."

A huge fish success considering the miles and miles of exploring we took on during the week. Big pike, big lakers and plenty speckled trout, we both believe we'll be doing this tour again some time, and building on what we learned this season. If in for a good, picture loaded read, just link below into the story and enjoy the trip.http://bunksoutdoorangle.com/nipigons-no-ragrets/ Thanks for viewing. Bunk"

5632530,3M TA3,2017-06-26 16:11:00,2846,Enjoyed your work a bunch. Fishing the Nipigon in September with Gord Ellis and hope to catch some of those dandy brookies. Your story has me on the edge right now. I can hardly wait. Thanks

5632914,northernbite,2017-06-26 19:26:00,1186,I really enjoyed reading your journal. Went through Beardmore on the 8th of June on our way back to Pennsylvania. we had been all the way up to and beyond Pickle Lake. We had fished Nipigon twice should go back again. Paul

5633634,Moosebunk,2017-06-27 07:55:00,211,"Thanks for reading fellas!Gordy knows it well enough he'll have fish stashed behind specific rocks on certain shores that are just waiting for your cast. Always like the fall time there too... for specks especially. Usually take two trips a season, spring and late summer. Pike and big lakers I find better earlier with good numbers of specks... Later it's hit and miss lakers, good pike fishing but great for big, colorful specks. Good luck!"

5637522,castnblast,2017-06-28 20:27:00,111,Great report and beauty fush! Lake Nipigon is an adult portion no doubt!
