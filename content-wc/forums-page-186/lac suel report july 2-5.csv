The biggest was 26"". I noticed the bigger fish coming from deeper water. 35ft range.As for what worked, plain and simple jig and minnow. Orange being the best color.I did find that one day pitching a jig with gulp minnows and dragging it back seem to trigger more bites with bigger fish across a rock point.The Smallmouth were up shallow hitting Rapala Shadow Raps. The pike were up as well hitting spinner baits and top waters.Lake Trout on the local lakes was insane! 3 way rigging spoons in 70-80ft of water was probably the most fun I have had in quite awhile."
5651954,Slim03,2017-07-07 18:25:00,159,I was up as well and fished out of lost island lodge. Took my father and my 9 year old son. Fishing was excellent first 2 days and slow on the 3rd but it was really calm on the 3rd day. Boated tons of fish with days over 100. I found them deep around 27 foot and size was good. No monsters biggest being 25.5 but never had such great consistent size. One area I was in was consistent 20 plus and as fast as you could reel them in. Lac seul didn't disappoint and looking forward to going back in 3 weeks.
