Now I'm not a big numbers fan......what counts isn't necessarily the number. Would I tell a prospective guest that is what they should expect......no. I have guests who are experiencing the opposite end of the spectrum. It's fishing. The good, the bad, the ugly...."
5600233,agress15,2017-06-09 23:16:00,13,Im going to be heading up to Eagle Lake and staying at Cedar Point Lodge in a week and was wondering if anybody had any tips for fishing Eagle Lake at this time as this is our fist year heading to Eagle Lake. We will mostly be walleye fishing with some muskie fishing also
5603081,Guest,2017-06-11 18:26:00,0,"agress15 Check out Vermilion Bay Lodge Website and Gords excellent guide to fishing Eagle. The Ultimate Eagle Lake Fishing Guide. I fish the East Basin of Eagle out of Temple Bay and never found the time or reason to fish the West Basin. In over 12 years fishing there JIG & MINNOW are the number one bait for Walleyes. Check this forum under different variations of - Eagle Lake Dryden, Eagle Lake Temple Bay, Deerlake Comments etc. you should see some excellent reports from some of the guides that fish the lake and also us simpletons that fish the lake. Plain jigs, chartreuse jigs, combos of orange and chartreuse, green , pink etc- 1/4 oz to 3/8 oz for windy days on rock bars all over the lake. Mayfly hatch has never bothered us we always get fish if we can get out on the lake. I always go the last week of June to first couple of days of July on the bus trip from Temple Bay. Get a Fishing Facts map and believe all the dangerous spots marked and multiply that by 10. There are many spots that are not marked on the map for fishing but the ones named are a good starting point. There are literately hundreds of rock humps deep that aren't on the map but hold fish. Believe your depth finder. Cruise around and you will find them. Good luck anything else I can help let me know. I am kind of surprised that no one has posted anything on here since the season opened regarding Eagle Lake, but you can check out the individual Lodges websites for some some pictures and details. Get a GPS because the lake is huge and one can easily get lost. I have an old Garmin Legend that is obsolete but it works great and I have over 100 way points marked for the East side.. I only fish Eagle for 4 days on Temple Bays bus trip, so I can't possibly hit them all and we always add more each year. Maybe BIG JOHN & Gord are out there and can give you a tip on this site, they are usually very good about helping with current fishing conditions. Gord runs a resort so he is always busy but you may see his comments on here. Big John has been on this lake since God created it , just kidding. Have fun, enjoy and good luck."

Jigs, minnows, crawlers, spinners ....are all working.......as are crank-baits. Not sure what a week will bring, but probably pretty similar situation. Here's a 29 incher from today.....released of course.......jig and minnow in about 10 feet of water."

Would Canadian Tire in Dryden be the closest place to buy a BB gun ? See you sooner than you are probably ready for PjShorthorn"

5621706,prov1800,2017-06-20 19:10:00,5010,not sure about the west end but the east end is definatly having a hatch going on in the south bays.that has turned fishing on fish very aggreesive but will slow down a bit when to are bloated.cool weather yesterday seemed to slow hatch down.thats good.theyll digest and gorge again.walleyes are all over.but seem to me to be moving deeper as best bite yesterday was 10-15 ft.where all lastweek they were in 2-3 ft.and so easyto catch.finally looks like a bit better weather coming to.
5644993,Guest,2017-07-04 06:19:00,0,"Returned Sunday night from Temple Bay Lodge. Fished June 27th to July 1st. Weather was cool and hard rain at times on 3 days. Fish were not on humps yet were we fish. Tried many of them by ourselves and with a guide on Thursday and they weren't there yet. If you could find patches of cabbage weeds you would find walleyes. Our three man boat caught and released 40 walleyes in 1 1/2 hrs from one weed bed. Sizes were 13"" to 23 1/2"". Found some slot walleyes off of points of islands some in deep water 16' to 32'. Mayflies were definitely hatching while there but we still caught hundreds of fish. The usual chartreuse jig was not working this year. Plain jigs were good also black jig with red and yellow eye and in the weeds a white and pink combo. All caught with live minnows. Tried artificial lures, gulp not one bite, twister tails nothing but bite offs from snake Northerns. Fishing partner caught & released a 37 1/2"" spotted Musky on walleye jig. Biggest walleye in our boat was 30"" walleye caught in 16' water off a point. Biggest Northern was 28 1/2"" while walleye fishing. Caught 10 jumbo perch while walleye fishing. A group in camp that targets perch had there 50 per man limits. Guides on Wednesday were catching 100 walleyes before noon. Thursday when we had guide it was a tough bite. Fished Osborn with him but fish had left the areas where they were previous day. Found fish but nothing like previous day. Had fun and a thousand laughs with the 15 guys we go with. Great service from everyone at TB."
5648985,prov1800,2017-07-06 07:21:00,5010,Glad you had a good trip.100 before noon hey.haha.thats funny.i used to guide there and heard that quite often.or you should have been here last week.haha.
5649113,Ricky Spanish,2017-07-06 08:09:00,1298,"I believe it. On 6/25 my wife and I caught 73 walleyes before noon without a guide. We took a nap after lunch, until dinner, then went out and caught 70 more. I stopped getting a guide when I started bringing my own boat about 8yrs ago. One doesn't need to take a 90 min boat ride and basically waste 3hrs of the day driving to and from the east or west ends."
