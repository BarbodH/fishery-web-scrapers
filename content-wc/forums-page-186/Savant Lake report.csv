That meant cool temps, rain that ranged from steady to sporadic the first couple of days, and fishing that was a little tougher than usual (but still amazing). The worst day I have ever had on Savant is better than the best day I have ever had in Minnesota. 9-12 FOW was the magic depth wherever we fished on the lake. We did catch some fish deeper in 15-18 FOW, but not many. One shallow area that a 15-18mph wind had pounded into all day midway through the trip switched on in the evening, but pretty much 10' was what worked, and what we looked for. A cold, gray, wet spring meant that the cabbage that is usually a key feature we look for was virtually nonexistent. Consequently, this was the slowest year we have ever had for pike fishing, and the walleye spots that rely on good grass were not so hot as well. Essentially, it seemed like the walleyes were caught between their spring and summer patterns. They weren't in the early season areas, but weren't in their summer haunts in great numbers either. So me and my kid looked at the map, traced a path between spawning areas and known summer hangouts, and started fishing around islands and points on that path. It didn't usually take checking too many spots before finding big school of walleyes ready to eat. With the cold front it wasn't the usual killer-aggressive bite, you would just feel a little weight on the jig while trolling or casting or jigging, and you knew to lean into them. There were plenty of doubles, and while the overall number of fish per day was down a bit, it was still really good action and we had several windows where you would get bit on every cast or trolling pass. We booked next year's trip before we finished this year's. Great service, great fishing, great scenery...what more could you want?"
