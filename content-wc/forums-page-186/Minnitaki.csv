5650121,Guest,2017-07-06 16:49:00,0,Heading up on Sunday and plan on fishing Minnitaki one day. Looking for an update on the water level. Plan on fishing the English Falls in the morning for about two hours. Then off to the humps outside the Rice River sanctuary and the some time in Abrams. Any info would be great.
