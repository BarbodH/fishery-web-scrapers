We went there 3 or 4 years in a row and the fishing was the best we have ever had anywhere. Several northerns over 44"", several 10 pound walleyes, large lakers, splake and 4-5 pound brookies in the river is what attracted us to this region. As many of you know, this lodge is native managed and with all due respect seemed to be struggling for several reasons. We had a great time and the facility and equipment was good but it was difficult to tell if they had enough motivation to keep this lodge viable. Just curious if anyone has any recent experiences... thanks"

If you wind up going please post a review they are on my list of places I want to get to. Access to the Brookies and good size pike/walleye is exactly why I was interested.Don Hartfor God`s River Lodge[email protected]519-681-5837
