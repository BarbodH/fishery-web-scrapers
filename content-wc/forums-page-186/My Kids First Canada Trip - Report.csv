I've never seen a young child go on an adventure like this and NOT have fun. They love it, as long as we as adults show them the way! Keep teaching it!"
5646945,MrSimon,2017-07-05 08:40:00,922,"I took my kids (the two older ones) for their first fishing trip to Canada. I figured the most important thing was for them to have FUN! Which meant swimming, ice cream, comfy beds, lots of easy fishing, and friends. I invited a buddy of mine and two of his kids. We stayed at Singleton Lake Family Campground which is on the Gananoque River System just over the border from New York. It was a super easy drive and the campground was very kid friendly. The cottage was great and the owners were fantastic. We all fished off my pontoon boat and caught tons of bluegill, perch, rock bass, sunnies, and some nice bass. The kids actually kept count of fish and we literally caught 1,000. That's something they will talk about and remember for years. The river system was perfect for exploring. We found plenty of hidden little bays and places for shore lunch. Even though the kids didn't catch any big pike or monster walleye, their first trip to Canada was a huge success and they can't wait to go back. We will work our way up to bigger trips and bigger fish as they grow .... but I truly believe this trip of endless panfish will stick in their memories forever."

While I don't doubt the kids will ever forget the trip I'm pretty sure the dads will also remember this trip for a long, long time.I no longer pick our family vacation spots. My wife, kids, grandkids do. My only stipulation is it must be in Minnesota and must be on a lake. They pick & I pay. I've never been happier shelling out money."
