5648401,Jig Man,2017-07-05 20:42:00,95,"We are mostly out of smallie teratorry now but here are thoughts, I would step it up one notch. if it is 20"" for smallies then I need a 20 1/2 for a fish that will live in stories for the future. for walleye our group is stuck at 29 1/2 so a 30 will do it, 31"" we talking smack for year. we have landed a 43"" Northern, bottom bouncing and it continues to remaing outstanding. Way to go Jeff on a bottom boucer."
5648457,Jig Man,2017-07-05 20:59:00,95,"I agree it is relative to location, how hard have you fished it before. find out the average over last year. Hit that numbr and you are their. blow by it and you can talk smack. for walleye our group is stuck at 29 1/2 so a 30 will do it, 31"" we talking smack for year. we have landed a 43"" Northern, bottom bouncing and it continues to remain outstanding. Way to go Jeff on a bottom bouncer."
5646553,troutwater,2017-07-05 06:30:00,299,"Pretty sure we've all heard of 50"" being the target for muskie and 30"" for walleye, but what's the trophy benchmark generally for smallmouth? My friend and I were talking about it the other day and neither of us could recall hearing it. We all love round numbers so is it 20""? Just kind of curious."
5646569,MrSimon,2017-07-05 06:44:00,922,"I agree with 20"" A 16 is really nice. An 18 is a giant. A 20 is truly something special."
5646745,That Minnesota guy,2017-07-05 07:32:00,8293,"20"" would be standard for me but Mille Lacs might be pushing that number up."
5646769,Lake Wisconsin,2017-07-05 07:40:00,1960,"22 or 23"" for me. But we have some pretty good smallmouth fishing near me. In Canada, I had an 18"" smallie which was nice, so I took a photo. the resort owner caught wind of the fish I landed and wanted a photo, which I sent to her. It was on the cover of their next years brochure. I will admit, good photo, held very nice, so it looked huge, but 18"" was it."
5646857,HeHooksHimself,2017-07-05 08:22:00,725,"In the water we usually fish, the smallies have only been in the system for about 12 years. An 18 or 19 usually wins the cabin fishing contest for the largest one of the week. We have never caught a 20, but we have come close. Of course our biggest muskies is only 37 (not in the water we usually fish) and our biggest walleye is 29 3/4. But I did catch a 40"" laker this spring. FISH ON! Hooks"
5647066,troutwater,2017-07-05 09:42:00,299,"Thanks for the responses guys. My biggest is an 18 3/4 from a small creek in Illinois, but man was it nice. I love smallmouth fishing since they fight like ****. Congrats on the 40"" laker, that's a giant!"
5647106,mjayn,2017-07-05 09:50:00,1188,"Catching fish is good enough for me. I guess I would have a sliding benchmark that moves as I catch personal best fish. I don't really even measure most fish that I am not keeping. Only started weighing fish when i got my first boga grip in the early 2000s. So with that I am looking for a ~23 inch smallie. Have to strive for that and try to match or pass my fathers 24"" smallie."
5647306,vteye2,2017-07-05 11:46:00,123,VT is blessed with outstanding smallie waters. 19 is the qualifier for the master angler pin. I qualify almost every year. I agree a 20 is a fish of a lifetime.
5647553,Multispecies Guy,2017-07-05 14:07:00,447,"I have different benchmarks depending on the situation. 16"" is a trophy on some of the small streams we wade in shorts and sneakers. 20"" on good Midwest or Canadian waters. 22"" on Great Lakes waters. One of the best smallies in my boat last year was an 18""er my 10 YO nephew caught, not because of the size of the fish but because of the size of the smiles on my nephew's and my brother's faces."
5647921,dhottle,2017-07-05 16:27:00,163,"It's all relative to where you fish. I fish lake Erie and 20"" fish are nice but not considered a trophy. 22"" minimum for great lakes & other quality fisheries."
