I've fished Natakim with the previous outfitters but this will be my first trip to Sand. I've received some advice from referrals already but looking for more advice from anyone who has fished the Lake, mostly on large walleye but I'd gladly take advice on pike and lake trout as well. Thanks in advance!"

It took a look at the Outfitter's site and came away with a couple of observations. Of course if you have some references from the outfitter, that's your best resource. Sand lake, also known as Cormon lake is not a large body of water but has good depth, enough to provide a lake trout fishery and from the satellite photos I looked at, has some shallow marshes that have to be pike water. The closest to the area that I have fished is on the Cabonga Reservoir and the terrain seems common to both. The fact that many of the surrounding lakes hold brook trout shows it to be fairly high terrain. When we fished Cabonga we did well trolling with Hot n Tots and similar lures. The Williams wabler was deadly on lakers using lead core about 45 ft down in June. Sometimes much shallower. As in all situations with walleye, when you find a concentration, jigs with a worm are the way to go. The lake is a great size to explore and fish in a week and the location of the cabin on a sand beach will be a plus with the mosquitoes. Eight horse motors should be fine for trolling. Looks great....wish I was going. Be sure to post a report."

We were almost going to pick the island cabin, but a bit to rustic for most in our group. I do have some good info from some guys who fished there last year. With this and what you have given us along with advice I've received in the general fishing thread we are as ready as we can be! And I'll absolutely post a report. The least I can do after getting such good advice from users here."
