Last 2 days, temp cooled off and started to rain. Water temps as high as as 67.x and as low as 62.x.Musky fishing was great as we expected. Our boat landed 7 musky in the week (42.5, 41.5, 41, 34.5, 32, 31, 30) - 4 trolling rock structure, and the other 3 were caught casting rock/weed areas. Many fish caught in camp that week, including a 47 and 48.5 right off the island. We came prepared to cast all week, but managed to scrape together some trolling baits - had we not trolled, it would have been a long week.Walleye fishing was a bust. We caught 66 all week between 2 of us, average size about 10"" at best. Biggest fish was 18"", which we found in the narrows as you enter Osbourne Bay. The lodge gave us a 'hot spot' map that didn't produce much, so we figured it out by mid week that we needed to head north and fish deep. Fished our asses off for our 8 keepers, only to find someone took them from the communal freezer at the fish house and left us with a bunch of dinks - so we went home at about 50% of our take - not a good way to end your trip. Anyone going to Century Lodge, I highly recommend taking your fish to your cabin.2 Smallmouth on the week, although we didn't target them. We did manage 17 rockbass though. I cannot believe how many rockbass are in that lake. We caught them in 5 FOW, we caught them in 25 FOW - didn't matter, they were there. They're about as annoying as Sheephead in the Bay of Green Bay.Pike: What pike? Maybe got 5 all week (2 in the slot, 3 dinks). Couldn't get a pike to bite all week. We like to eat them, but this is the first year we've been skunked with any takers. Pretty disappointing.HWY 502 was not bad, we made really good time both ways. No issues through the border, no issues with traffic."

I remember we used to lurk a bit north of Century Island and wait for the morning's boats to head towards Niven's. Once out of sight, we'd scoot in and slay the walleyes about 100' away from the island. This would have been in the June/July time of year. Sorry to hear about your trip, although seven skis sounds pretty fun."
5775393,wooglin,2017-09-20 09:18:00,371,"The musky fishing did not disappoint at all. After we were tuned into that a bit more, they started to produce. We had a lot of action up by Stanton Island in the weeds, but weeds turned off as the weather turned cold/rainy. Walleye were tough to come by, and anything over 18"" was unheard of. We fished Osbourne and Niven with little luck. I'm certain if we wanted bigger walleye, we needed to go North and get deeper."
5775993,Ricky Spanish,2017-09-20 15:29:00,1298,"I've toyed with making a separate trip to Century Lodge, but Temple Bay has everything the wife and I need, and isn't far from just about every type of water Eagle has to offer. The main attraction for Century for me, in addition to proximity to great early season water, would be that we could bring our dog, if I'm not mistaken. It sounds like you knew what you had to do, so you've got that going for you. I am always kicking myself if I can't figure out why my tactics didn't work."
5777057,wooglin,2017-09-21 10:48:00,371,"I'm certain that if we were there in July/August, we would have slayed them. Double digit musky, 200+ walleye - weather patterns didn't help us at all, and a new body of water didn't help either - but we dialed it in. I can see that south part of the lake being 'straight fire' in the summer."
5777129,rosh1,2017-09-21 11:39:00,275,We were there same time. You were right on walleyes north and deeper.
