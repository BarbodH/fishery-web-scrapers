I don't see them putting up much of a fight on this. In a perfect world they would be all in favor of stopping the spread. However, they are smart enough to know it can't be stopped and ridiculous enforcement attempts will only result in lost business. Just to be clear. I'm not a anti in trying to do something. I'm just a realist in that you are pee'ing against a hurricane wind."
5765945,v-bay gord,2017-09-13 17:44:00,3168,"Close the border to boats unless they go through a disinfection process........or rent camp boats. That will never happen now, but it would be the only way to have some control. Many camp owners are in it for the short term, the $ and don't even live year round in the country."
5766369,Lake Wisconsin,2017-09-14 07:00:00,1960,"Just remember boys and girls, it isn't just humans........... Buddy of mine built a pond from scratch. Clay bottom, no water entering or leaving from a different source. He now has bullheads and Milfoil - neither which he placed in his pond. He does have a lot of visitors of the flying nature however."
5767361,Aspencreek,2017-09-14 18:37:00,2911,"And this guy is also the one who is complaining about his boats performance too right. Man, when you look at that and think nothing is wrong, your should have your captain rights revoked!!!"
5767633,billy weaver,2017-09-14 21:44:00,470,"We got a place in the country with a small pond, 150' by 75'. It's just for a decorate feature. It is 15 years old and never been stocked and receives its water from a mowed area drainage. Now there are bullheads and some small minnow type fish with cattails and lily pads. The Canadian Geese have made it a stop over as they like grazing on fresh mowed grass There is moss that I treat for as it would soon cover the pond. You won't make me believe that geese and other birds don't spread invasive species."
5767881,Guest,2017-09-15 06:43:00,0,"Actually you are an anti by suggesting do nothing , and statements like you stated above "" I'll take responsibility when you take responsibility for letting them here in the first place"" ..........not sure what you mean but we don't need tourists that think that way, that kind of thinking (pass the buck, or thinking you are just a small part) ..............is what got various USA state lakes the way they are, if you want Canada's to end up that way too......so you have no place to have decent fish experience on the continent , then keep up that way of thinking. We are all in this together, get on board."
5769297,Aspencreek,2017-09-16 10:19:00,2911,"X2, it only takes 1 guy to launch a boat (like the one pictured earlier) and zebra mussels are a problem, 1 boat to empty his bait bucket into the lake, 1 trailer with some weeds hanging, NEED I go on. Look at the Everglades and what has happened when a couple Python got loose or released. What we know and have now can look very different in just a few years. And I for 1 don't want to hear about how the zebra mussel has been a good thing, and how tasty big head carp from the Il and Miss. rivers are. If that is your opinion keep your head in the sand."
5769345,pjshorthorn,2017-09-16 10:46:00,5654,"If Canadian Geese are part of the invasive species issue, buy some pink flamingos and put them out on the shoreline. Apparently they don't like flamingos. Don't ask me how I know. I've heard that the goose crap issue is reduced as well. PjShorthorn"
5769369,wmd,2017-09-16 11:13:00,388,I had a friend from South Dakota enter Saskatchewan from North Dakota last month and he was held at the border until someone who was trained to wash boats for invasive species arrived. he was there 1 1/2-2 hours until the job was completed. Invasive species have been discovered in numerous lakes in SD the last few years. wmd
5781137,lirwin4,2017-09-24 17:01:00,7,"Hello, I am an avid fisherman and live in the province of Manitoba. Invasive Species is a big concern up here. Zebra Mussels populations in Lake Winnipeg have just recently exploded and we are desperately trying to stop them from spreading into other waterways in our province and elsewhere. Watercraft inspection stations have been set up. Please take the precautions as shown in bold font and have your equipment inspected. The following is a news release from the province: News Release - Manitoba September 18, 2017 PROVINCE ANNOUNCES WATERCRAFT INSPECTION SEASON NEARS COMPLETION    Season had Record Number of Inspections: Squires With the support of partner organizations and the boating public, the Manitoba government has made great strides in protecting the province's waterways from aquatic invasive species, Sustainable Development Minister Rochelle Squires announced today. Our watercraft inspection stations have been busy this summer and we want to thank all those who stopped and helped us be vigilant in the ongoing fight against aquatic invasive species, Squires said. The season isn't over yet but we are encouraged by the continued support and participation of Manitobans and visitors who come to enjoy our lakes and rivers. As of mid-September, the province inspected 8,010 watercraft, compared to just over 5,000 in 2016. The goal of the inspection program is to continue to educate boaters and protect Manitoba waterways from aquatic invasive species such as zebra mussels. Of the watercraft inspected this year, only 12 per cent required decontamination. Watercraft inspection stations have been set up in boat launches at Grand Rapids and Selkirk (in Selkirk Park) and on highway locations at Eriksdale, Swan River, The Pas and Headingley. When transporting watercraft over land, drain plugs must be left open. Manitobans must take the proper steps before entering any water body by:cleaning and removing any aquatic invasive species (AIS), aquatic plants and mud from the watercraft, trailer and all water-related equipment such as fishing gear, nets and anchors; draining all water from motor, bilge, bait buckets and any compartments; drying all water-related equipment and hard-to-drain compartments that have contacted the water prior to being used in another water body; and disposing of unused bait and worms in the trash. Additional decontamination measures may also be required, for example, if watercraft or water-related equipment are removed from provincially designated control zones. The 2017 watercraft inspection program is in operation Thursdays to Mondays and will run until Monday, Oct. 30. The schedule can be found at www.manitoba.ca/stopthespread. For more information on zebra mussels and control zones, visit the website at www.manitoba.ca/stopthespread or call 1-87-STOP AIS-0 (1-877-867-2470). - 30 -"
5760705,Pooch,2017-09-10 07:12:00,4618,"Was thinking about all the precautions in MN trying to stop the spread of invasive's and was wondering about Canada and all the boats coming into Canada and launching into Canadian waters that are from MN and other areas that might be carrying unwanted material or species unknowingly.Is this a problem north of us as I've never heard a word about it on either side of the border. It looks too late for MN to stop the spread of whatever is on the radar today, but what about the waters of Canada?Irma also had me thinking about how these big storms are moving species around via water levels. That has to be happening there.Since we live close to the Illinois river and with all the Asian Carp has done to kill this river I think it is important to at least consider the impact.Not trying to stir the pot, but it seems like it should be of concern?Pooch"
5760721,That Minnesota guy,2017-09-10 07:31:00,8293,"Stopping invasives is the same as the war on drugs. Makes you all warm and fuzzy thinking you are trying when in reality you are pouring millions down the rat hole with little to no return. What invasives do allow is the lake associations to privatize "" their "" lakes."
5760769,CI_Guy,2017-09-10 08:33:00,2118,"The last time I crossed into Manitoba they asked me when the boat had last been in the water, what lake or river and if my livewell and bilge were dry. Pretty much the same questions we are asked by inspectors at boat launches,but they didn't look in the bilge or livewell."
5761025,Skywagon,2017-09-10 12:20:00,1106,"My wife discovered a few plants of European frog bit https://www.canadianwaterfrontservices.com/mobile/super-page.php?id=5in 2014, contiguous to a local tourist camp, she immediately reported it to the MNR, but by then it was too late. Frog bit is an (non-native) invasive water plant species, a very bad thing for a water system. Fast forward 3 years and it has already choked the adjacent creek system to the point it is no longer navigable, even by kayak and has since been discovered in another area a mile away. The whole chain of lakes is now at risk, as the tourists at that camp boat through that stuff, spread it through the lakes, then carry it back to their respective states."
5761049,Darrenf442,2017-09-10 12:52:00,1369,"This guy was on his way to the lake. Thankfully he was stopped before he got there. When you have people like this who have no clue , pretty hard to stop invasive species."
5761153,fishron,2017-09-10 15:30:00,317,Glad this post wasn't about my buddies and I and our last fall trip to Canada in a couple of weeks. Last year someone let some water lettuce loose in one of the local canals. By the end of summer it had taken over the entire surface. Fortunately it is not winter hardy. The canal was completely unfishable for awhile. If it ever manages to become winter hardy we're in trouble. Manatees don't range this far north.
5761481,kzoofisher,2017-09-11 03:32:00,5144,"Sigh, the lake I've gone to for the last four years now has Rusty Crayfish. We noticed the decline in weeds and the camp owner told us about the Rusty's. They sure didn't walk up there; whether they hitched a ride in a live well or were brought as bait doesn't make any difference to the fishery. With luck there are enough smallmouth to gorge on them and keep them in check. We caught more small smallmouth than usual but the smallie fishing isn't good enough to make that lake a destination IMO. If the walleye population takes a nose dive for a few years until the system rebalances, or if it settles into more of a bass lake, it will be bad for the lodge. I think every boat crossing in should either have an State inspection no more than 36 hours before arriving at the border or be inspected at the border. This goes for boats launching on boundary waters, too. Yes, it's a pain and will cost some money. People whining about the cost and the effort to combat AIS over the last 70 years is what got us here in the first place. Time for us to pay for the laziness and cheapness of the past."
5762809,LOWrider,2017-09-11 19:34:00,40,"Maybe there should be a certification required to operate a boat that requires an understanding of how invasive species are spread. Could simply be incorporated into boater safety training that most states and provinces require for younger people (maybe they are already doing that). For those of us past the age where the training is required could be a pretty simple online instruction thing. I'm not into bureaucracy but the stakes are so enormously high, especially for points north not yet touched."
5762849,That Minnesota guy,2017-09-11 19:54:00,8293,"Or maybe fine the he77 out of tankers for blowing ballast tanks. Dedicate 9 trillion dollars, 50,000 officials, 20 years later you got the same mess. No amount of money or man power will stop it. Education might slow it a bit but you aren't stopping anything."
5765441,Guest,2017-09-13 11:06:00,0,"Hmmmm .....I have never seen a tanker blow their ballast on my inland lakes, lets not mix up what we are talking about. it starts with the local anglers and tourists taking responsibility for their boats being clean of invasive, and it is not that complicated , Cdn Lodge owners should also inspect and reinforce with their clients , it saves their lake ."
