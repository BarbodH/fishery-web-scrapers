5773721,Limeyangler,2017-09-19 09:19:00,563,"LOL....nope....I refused to go on the 'Wall of Shame' despite a nice hook up while trying to lip hold a spring bass this year, plus the bite was on so did not want to leave. Just got my pliers and ripped it out, hurt like stink but hey, now I know how the fish feel....lol. Here is the video of my hook up.https://youtu.be/VRc-Dw5IjJA"

5774841,Aspencreek,2017-09-19 20:34:00,2911,"Look at some of those hooks, some are so small .....I've seen mosquitos with more.......just kidding, never had the honor of hooking myself or partner (yet). Had a newbie with me a couple years ago and he was determined to cast for northerns, That BIG 2 trebel hook spinner wizzed by my ear WAY to many times, so I took cover and watched him."
