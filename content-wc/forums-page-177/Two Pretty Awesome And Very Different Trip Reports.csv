It still is actually, don't have time to even take a breath.I have an upcoming story myself on my recent trip to Edmund Lake in Manitoba that's almost done and once again it'll be a good one - I think.In the meantime there were two really outstanding, and very different stories published on my site that I think you guys will enjoy.First is a lengthy and detailed report by Russ Siminski on his trip earlier this year to Crystal Lodge on Cree Lake in northern Saskatchewan. It's a fantastic adventure and was the trip of a lifetime for Russ and his buddy Mike!http://www.canadafishingguide.net/ba...-on-cree-lake/Second is a story by Chris and Colin Brock about their recent trip to Moose Lake with Air Dale Fishing and Hunting in Wawa, Ontario. Moose is a small remote outpost camp in the Algoma region with direct access to a boat cache on the Oba River with many miles of water to explore and fish both upstream and down. As always those fellas spin a good yarn!http://www.canadafishingguide.net/mo...-of-adventure/Cheers, Mike"

I have been in contact with you and we talked about big northerns and Nipigon along with other Ontario lakes. I am the trip planner and I am starting to think of a fly in for next year. It appeared me, my brother and his friend were heading to Little Vermillion near Ear Falls but when our group expanded from 3 to 6 we opted for something cheaper and closer. Our group of 6 went to LOW in early September this year west of Morson. We did casting for Northerns and Muskies but not much to show for the work put in. We were staying at a private lodge with friends that fish within sight of the lodge and the fishing was so-so for those that stayed close by. My brother and I did some scouting, fished harder, and found walleyes and many nice smallmouth with a few perch and crappies thrown in. I loved all the Cree Lake pictures especially seeing all those big lakers and northerns. This past year my bother's good friend has been diagnosed with Parkinson's. He is the one that loves to cast and my goal the past few years has been to find a lake where he has a good chance to catch a 40+ inch northern. I wonder if he could handle the physical demands of your trip. He is in his mid-60's and could cast just fine a few years ago. Now a 30 foot cast seems like a challenge. I do not even know if he could handle reeling in a bigger fish. I suspect your trip was physically demanding. Any thoughts? Randy from Duluth, Mn"

I have been going up to canada for 30 plus years fishing but have missed the past 3 because of travel, work and where i lived. So, reading and watching your videos makes me feel like i am there and enjoying it through your reports and videos. I recently moved so i will be going back again starting next year. thank you again."
