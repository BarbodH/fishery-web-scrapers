5770081,pjshorthorn,2017-09-17 07:27:00,5654,How did the Lucky Seven gas station / bait shop make out with the bypass ? Did they get bypassed ? That was always a last stop to get some jigs and miscellaneous things left at home .....lol. PjShorthorn
5770481,btyreprich,2017-09-17 11:43:00,1067,"I remember when I started going to Canada in 1977 and for many years afterwards that highway 53 north of Ear Claire would take you through some pretty small towns in northern Wisconsin. It was an odd sight & feel driving through those towns vary late at night in a caravan heading towards Duluth.You are right, the roads have improved greatly over the years. The highway in Duluth is still a bit scary give the incline!"
5770617,law57,2017-09-17 15:32:00,1147,"No - the Lucky Seven in Virginia is not 'out of the loop'. The bypass is simply a loop to the NE of the Thunderbird Mine between Eveleth and Virginia. You leave the old hwy 53, make a loop to the NE and come back to hwy 53 before the Holiday station/ Target store stop light.https://oxblue.com/delay/28ad0ddabae...urrent.jpg?ts="
5770785,Marcus Trajan,2017-09-17 19:40:00,203,I came south on 53 this afternoon and the new bridge was open both directions. It may be the most scenic stretch of road in the entire state.
5729001,Pat,2017-08-20 22:38:00,203,Coming southbound Saturday it took us about half hour to get through Virginia. Traffic real slow getting through the final stop light headed south.
5730281,Blackmacs,2017-08-21 13:18:00,2121,I'm not looking forward to driving on the new bridge during the winter.
5731225,rather-be-fishin,2017-08-21 22:10:00,429,Target date to finish is 9/15/17. I took a bus tour of the road & bridge yesterday and it is very impressive & amazing!!! There will be a new 3 way stop light at 2nd Avenue entrance to Virginia. Enjoy the pictures!
5732449,lazermule,2017-08-22 12:37:00,86,"Wow! Yes, a very impressive project in deed. Seems like a lot of work done for $150 million dollars when put in perspective with our local school levy for building maintenance was nearly that much (6 buildings). I went though there 2 weeks ago this Thursday and it wasn't bad, returned the following Monday and it was good as well. I guess neither were peak travel times but all moved well. LM"
5732689,JMKC,2017-08-22 14:59:00,238,So where will 53 northbound come out at ? Past Sawmill ?
5733337,Stringbean,2017-08-22 20:11:00,279,Here is a diagram from the MN DOT:
5733385,law57,2017-08-22 20:20:00,1147,Yes - Northbound youjll come 'back' to the old route just east of the Target store in Virginia.
5769953,Stringbean,2017-09-17 05:23:00,279,September 15th has come and gone. Has anyone been over the newly relocated highway and bridge? Your impressions?
5769969,That Minnesota guy,2017-09-17 05:42:00,8293,I have not. Hopefully tomorrow I'll get up that way. It won't be that big of a deal I'm sure.
5770017,law57,2017-09-17 06:56:00,1147,I was in Virginia yesterday - Saturday 9/16. The new portion of Hwy 53 was not yet open.
5727513,Stringbean,2017-08-20 05:44:00,279,"For those that drive to Canada from the Midwest, the highway route usually leads us through Virginia on Hwy 53. Is there a target date for the highway construction to be finished?"
5727561,Hot Runr Guy,2017-08-20 06:12:00,16061,Looks like mid-September.http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/ HRG

5727777,ogilville,2017-08-20 08:54:00,262,"It seems to me that Minnesota has two seasons, Winter and road repair."
5727809,pjshorthorn,2017-08-20 09:09:00,5654,"We call it ""Orange Barrel"" season here. All year long, every year......... PjShorthorn"
5727833,law57,2017-08-20 09:16:00,1147,"I shop in Virginia just about weekly. I was there last Wednesday - there was no stop light for construction then. There is a constriction to one lane each way, at 40mph, for a couple of miles. You guys should be able to handle that."
5727945,That Minnesota guy,2017-08-20 10:04:00,8293,Many don't know that the state was FORCED into this construction. The present day roadway is owned by one of the mines up there. They allowed the state to build 53 on their land way back in the day with the understanding that they could reclaim the land in the future. Well it seems they now need to mine that ground and informed the state they would need to move the highway. Just a tidbit of news.
5728329,law57,2017-08-20 15:38:00,1147,"This is correct. I wondered why the state didn't just pay the mine for the value of the ore that the road prevented them from mining. $400 million! Guess that answered my question. I think people need to remember that different parts of the country have different problems with road maintenance. Prime farm country - Iowa, Ill, Indiana, Dakotas, etc., have very stable strata under their roads. N. MN and Canada (and other areas I'm sure) have rock, clay, extreme cold/hot weather differences. All of these contribute to frost heaves and the destruction of highways. 502 is built, for the most part, over very, very, hard rock. They blasted the hills to fill in the valleys. This rock cracks with the weather - cold, heat, water, ice - and forces Ontario to spend time, effort, and money to maintain it. And the maintenance season is very short. It isn't for lack of funds or skill in road building that these roads need replacement - it's geography and climate. Also, regarding Hwy 53 in N. MN. A very good two lane highway would service International Falls from the rest of the state very well. The 4-lane improvements are built, for the most part, for the vacationers who pass-thru on their way to Canada and back.So slow down and enjoy the trip - the delays you suffer this year will make the trip better next year."
5728521,JMKC,2017-08-20 17:38:00,238,"I agree, our trip each summer to Kenora gets shorter in drive time every year. The Eau Claire by-pass, improvements in Duluth, and the 4 lane extension to Cook, MN. to name the major ones."
5728633,thawk9455,2017-08-20 18:37:00,343,"Drove through the last two Saturdays, wasn't too bad going either way. Was a little slower going north a week ago but guessing it only took 10 minutes extra or so. One brief slowdown going south, maybe 2 minute delay. On the bright side, Hwy 12 near Baraboo finally opened the new bypass. Still road construction but no more driving through town!"
