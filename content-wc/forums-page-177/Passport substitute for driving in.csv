5778217,GWC,2017-09-22 08:29:00,1021,"There are two of us that go to Canada together each year. We cross through International Falls. We live in different states & our last names cause enough attention so we always carry our passports. My current DL won't even get me on an airplane or into most federal facilities starting Jan 22, 2018. The current Missouri DL doesn't comply with the Real ID Compliance act passed by George W. Bush. Missouri should start issuing the new format license sometime in the future (?) but it will still be an option. I doubt it customs will be too happy to see our non-compliant DL as ID when returning to the states? There are four states in non-compliance listed in the article below. Can't say if those states have addressed the issue or not? https://www.usnews.com/news/best-sta...liant-licenses"
5777049,Pymbet,2017-09-21 10:47:00,42,"I noticed that my passport was expired by about a month last September, five days before a planned trip. We called the US Customs office in Detroit and they indicated that a recently expired passport should not be a problem. Crossing in, the Canadian customs asked me if I knew my passport was expired and I said yes, I just noticed that a few days ago. That was it. Coming back into the US was the same. US Customs asked if I was renewing my passport (they should have known I had not yet, as I still had my expired one). I said I will as soon as I can."
5777105,CI_Guy,2017-09-21 11:33:00,2118,A woman in our group had a photo copy of her birth certificate crossing at Warroad 2 years ago. Coming back to the US she mouthed off to the boarder agent when he told her the photo copy of her BC was not a legal form of ID. The frustrated boarder agent told her that a photo copy had as much legal standing as a note from her mother.
5777225,Bill Krejca,2017-09-21 13:33:00,6107,"Thanks for all the reply's, folks. Friend decided we stop in Mpls and get a new passport, after talking with senator's office, which stated we might be at the border for a long, long time if things didn't go quite right. After another friend going ended up in the hospital, last week, and couldn't go, this trip is beginning to shape up like another vivid trip description on here this summer. And we haven't even left home yet!! Bill"
5777433,1/4 oz Jig,2017-09-21 15:54:00,90,Just make sure you get to the passport agency early to make sure you can get it the same day. They were cutting off people at the chicago agency around noon for getting them the same day.
5777601,Lmbkiller,2017-09-21 18:53:00,639,"Bill....I got blasted for trying to tell everyone on this site 2yrs ago that a passport is not required to get into Canada by land and come back to the US. All u need is a birth certificate and that's just for getting back into the states (probably don't even need that). If the guy has a birth certificate I wouldn't sweat a thing. To all u *** monkeys that said I didn't know what I was talking about several yrs ago, your a bunch of bandwagon idiot flip floppers. U guys are the reason why 99.9% of what is said on the internet can't be trusted. Do your research and go thru the real scenario before u open your yappers because that is exactly what I did. I apologize in advance to any of u that weren't part of that thread long ago."

There are many experiences to be shared by a lot of folks on this forum. The OP asked a pretty straightforward question and has received some good feedback, prior to your post, to help out a friend. Just another knuckle dragging caveman's observation. PjShorthorn"

5777857,Obabikon,2017-09-22 04:55:00,2370,"lol... the law about this is pretty simple... 1. Canada does NOT require passports to enter Canada by land. Drivers license is fine. 2. The US DOES require passports to enter the United States by land. 3. If you are a US citizen, they HAVE to let you back into the US. They can not permanently deny you entry. (what if you lost your passport on your trip?). However, they can make ""reentry"" take a very long time if they so choose. Especially if you don't have a good reason for not having a passport."
5777945,pjshorthorn,2017-09-22 06:32:00,5654,"I get the fact that this may have been the only time he has ever been right, but to call out everyone that may have had a different opinion is grade schoolish at best...... The old......"" I told you so"". PjShorthorn"
5777977,Obabikon,2017-09-22 06:40:00,2370,"https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=443601 Here's the thread from two years ago. I didn't see one person say that you couldn't do it... in fact, most said you could. They just stated that more than likely you would get hassled. ESPECIALLY if you were doing it multiple times. I'm sure all the time LMB has crossed the border, he has had his passport with him. I guess the question is, did his brother get one? Is he making regular trips to Canada without one, and getting no negative results? If that is the case, I guess he could claim to be ""right"". lol Funny, that looking back, I made nearly the exact same post on this thread as I did the last one. (not remembering the last one from two years ago)"
5776329,Bill Krejca,2017-09-20 21:19:00,6107,"Is there a official, easily obtained document which allows entry into Canada and reentry to US? Friend's passport expired, leaving Friday. I know, should have looked. Thanks, Bill"
5776345,Jesse-WI,2017-09-20 21:52:00,534,"We had a passport issue about a month ago. Luckily, he was born in Cook country and we left a bit late so he could visit the country clerk office and get a birth certificate. He used the birth certificate and driver's license to cross both ways at Fort Frances and had zero issues."
5776353,Jesse-WI,2017-09-20 21:58:00,534,"And now that I think of it, I am pretty sure if you are crossing at Fort Frances they will also accept an expired passport with a drivers license. They are open 24 hrs a day +1 807-274-3655"
5776417,1/4 oz Jig,2017-09-20 23:12:00,90,Actually this year my dad realized his passport expired 2 days before we were leaving for our trip. We live in the Chicago area and there is a passport agency at the state building. He went on Thursday morning and got his passport the same day. Surprisingly only $60 extra expedited fee. If your friend lives near one go this route and there will be no issues. Just make sure he brings his 2 passport photos. They also require a receipt or itinerary showing you need the passport right away. My dad just showed the deposit receipt with dates on it from our lodge.
5776481,martinbns,2017-09-21 04:44:00,1520,"IT surprises me you can get into Canada and back into the US without your passport, we were travelling from NB to Ontario a few years ago absent mindedly following our GPS which actually took us through the US(it actually was quicker and the US border wouldn't even talk to us about it."
5776585,Jesse-WI,2017-09-21 06:33:00,534,"If you fly, passport is absolutely required. Canada's laws for entry are less strict than the US."
5776793,LOW1,2017-09-21 08:32:00,2828,"I think you will have more of an issue coming back to the States than going to Canada. Take a DL, an original (not a photocopy) of a US birth certificate, and the expired passport. The DL and the BC will likely get him into Canada. On the way back there may be a delay but the expired passport will at least show that he is ""in the system."" Expect a modest lecture and a slightly increased return crossing delay. Now is not the time to make the crossings any more difficult than usual, so I'd leave the booze and cigs at home and consider not taking any fish home. And look and act polite and presentable at the crossings."
5776865,brad34,2017-09-21 09:14:00,892,"Can't speak for Canada, but you cannot be denied entry into the U.S. if you are a citizen, passport or no passport. That said, they can make your life miserable by delaying your entry until they verify your identity. May take minutes or hours depending on the officer and the identity documents you do have with you."
5776881,The tank,2017-09-21 09:18:00,340,I know of a similar whoops. Guy left his passport at home. Took an hour to get into Canada really was nothing getting back into the state's. They asked him the same questions like before passports. He did hand them his DL. It was all good. Good luck hope it all works for you.
5777033,bowtech840,2017-09-21 10:39:00,111,"Lol, a few years ago they (U.S. BP) were giving me the shake down over a misdemeanor charge in Nevada that showed up on my record. I told them I've never even been to Nevada and I hadn't. Sat in a holding cell and was interrogated for over an hour until they finally cleared things up. The whole time I was wondering how on earth they were denying me entry back into the US. I kept my cool and just went along answering all their questions because I was just ready to be home and didn't want to delay the process any further. The guy doing the interviewing was a total prick and there was a lot of things I would of liked to say to him but I didn't. I've wondered since then though - even if I did have a misdemeanor charge in Nevada, what's the difference? They weren't going to allow me entry???? SMH"
