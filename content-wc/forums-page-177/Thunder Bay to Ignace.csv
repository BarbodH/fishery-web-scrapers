5782097,Guest,2017-09-25 06:57:00,0,Head up this week. Just wondering about road conditions. Is there any construction happening along this route? Trying to avoid rock chipping my entire trailer and boat! Thanks!

In every case we had to wait at a stop light and move over to the opposing lane which was all hard pavement. Delays at each stop were a few minutes at most. PjShorthorn"
