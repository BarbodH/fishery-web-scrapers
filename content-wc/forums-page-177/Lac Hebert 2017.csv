5715050,octanehi5,2017-08-12 07:08:00,1104,"The south end of the lake you have most of the camps on one island,always more boats fishing. The north end of the lake has 2 camps that are 6 miles north.always less boats.earlier in the yr before the water warms ,the good fishing is in the southern half of the lake near the river that the walleye spawn in.Once the water warms to 64+ they move to the deeper end of the lake,North, Many hot spots on the lake ,depends on the wind direction.How many fish you catch,is up to your style of fishing as well as hrs spent on the water. Knowledge of the lake is a key factor.As well as fishing during prime weeks.I have fished this lac 15 yrs. in a row.I have had days of as low as 30 fish a day ,to a high of 250 a day. This is fishing from 12 to 14 hrs. a day every day.This lac holds millions of Walleyes. You can always find a spot to be by yourself. I'm booked for 2018.If you have never fished this Lac I suggest you put this on your Bucket list. Good Luck"

We were in camp 25 in the north part of the lake. 4 of us, 5 days fishing, caught somewhere around 500-550 total if I recall. 2 biggest were 28.5 and 26.5. Had a great time and want to return someday. Well run outfit. Very nice folks."

Just to let the guys who follow this thread,I in no way down grade the gouin,The gouin is the place to go if you like big pike,and your fair share of walleye.Hebert is a walleye factory that has some nice pike in it.I am a 90%of the time Walleye fisherman.If for some reason I did not book to go to hebert(have been on it the last 15 yrs.)I would not hesitate to fish the gouin.

Fishing was still very good. Size of the fish are getting bigger as well. One night ( dad and I) caught over 100 walleye in six hours. Average size was around 17 inches. Caught a couple nice like as well. Great service, accommodations and awesome fishing. Air Tamarac team were top notch as usual. Great trip made better by their dedication to service."

5709754,vteye2,2017-08-09 13:03:00,123,Single greatest fishery on earth - Didn't you realize that? Scroll back you will find endless threads. You will catch more fish than using a cast net ina hatchery. Just fish where the other boats are stacked up. 100 divided by 2 guys divided by 6 hours equals every 8.3 minutes.How fast can you untangle a cast net?

5713474,fishron,2017-08-11 07:35:00,317,"I've only fished Hebert three times so I'm far from an expert on the lake. I've wondered what makes Hebert so productive for a lake that's only twelve miles long. I believe the possession limits on Hebert are working. There's a tremendous population of bait fish in the lake. My fishfinder screen went black with bait many times. Occasionally I could see the walleye embedded in the schools. I believe the main baitfish are troutperch. Hebert is not a deep lake. There is no place on the lake that wouldn't be considered walleye territory. As with any lake, there are better spots that will draw more boats than others. Hebert has many good spots that allow you to fish uncrowded. The lake and cabins are well maintained by Air Tamarac. I hope you get a chance to fish it."

In my opinion, Hebert is head and shoulder above them all. I love bring new guys to the lake every yr. and just watching them light up when the bite is on,Many guys have set their person best numbers as well as weight on every trip I have been on. If reporting these events as well as numbers bother you don't read them.As long as I can fish this lac i will report its numbers caught during my stay.Mom always taught us ,if you do not have anything good to say don't say it.

5662442,potsie225,2017-07-13 10:55:00,41,"10 guys from the rochester, cleveland area left Rochester at 6 am July 1st. This is our first trip to Lac Hebert. It took us about 14 hours with gas stops, p breaks and lunch. Ferry boat across the Ottawa River was the fastest, no delay I have ever had, The weater at Lac Hebert was rain,wind and a feww cool nights. We fished everyday for 8 to 10 hours and some guys fished longer. A few guys fished for pike, caught 27, the biggest was 33 inches. We caught 1702 walleyes, with somedays over 300. Had 5 fish fries, nothing better then a fresh caught walleye dinner. Personal I loved the trip, most of us had never caught some many fish, we 2 big walleyes 29 and a 28.5. We fished the 5 sisters, sea gull, clorax, several other areas that don't have names. My thanks to this site and all the guys who gave be great advice. Ron CT for goodies left behind, green worms, were awesome. Ron Pa, Kevin NY, Jay Ont you guys are great. Cannot said enough about the outfitter, first class, family run outfitters, best I have ever had. I had a flat tire leaving the hotel, and plugged it for me and it is still holding air. The road in is tough and you need the right tires on your vehilce , I would never take a car on those roads. Cabins where great hot showers in the bush, un real. I will go back again in 2019, Ron I would love to be there in your week, but probably stay on the island. I will do 6 to 10 guys.Life is getting back to normal, but I remember Lac Hebert, Doug"
5662482,retire55,2017-07-13 11:17:00,1029,Happy to read that you and your group enjoyed your trip into Lac Hebert. It's a great walleye fishery and your catch numbers were testament to that. Five walleye meals in camp - hard to beat. I very much enjoyed the visit with you and Chris on 1 Jul.
5663866,vteye2,2017-07-14 05:34:00,123,"Hmm, 7 cabins on a 12 mile long lake and the pike fishing seems to have declined. I am glad the walleye are better than ever...."
5665058,octanehi5,2017-07-14 15:08:00,1104,"glad to hear that Hebert lived up to your expectations,and that your group had a great time.One of my friends comes out this sunday.can not wait to see how he did?"
5673250,clegg,2017-07-19 06:38:00,38,"Just got back from a 4 day stay at cabin 22. First time at Hebert. Last time we've used air Tamarac was to go to the Gouin. Take this review with a grain of salt, as it was our first time there and didn't have the time to try many different fishing spots . Fishing was great! Daniel gave us a few spots we should fish at and he was right every time. Behind (south) of the island near the three buoys was a great spot. We fished there 3 of the 4 evenings. It brought in 160 walleye, most of which were keepers. Not nearly as much as the numbers posted here but we're not complaining. The lake is full of fish, just gotta find them. The majority of walleye were caught with jig and worm during the evening. 7-10' of water. When the sun started going down hot n tots were the lure of choice.. At one point each cast was landing a fish. The biggest walleye I caught was using one (23""). As for the pike fishing, we caught a total of 8 pike (most small but a decent one at 14 lbs). We were expecting more from the pike fishing, but some guys there said that it really is a walleye lake. They weren't interested in lures. However, it's not to say there aren't big pike. On three occasions we had a monster pike bite a walleye as we were bringing it in (at the 3 buoys). Huge fish! And they were stubborn, kept trying to swallow the walleye as we were bringing it in. By the time it got to a few feet from the boat, they would let go. On the Gouin (in my experience) the pike fishing was a lot better. All said and done, it was a great 4 days, fishing was great, Daniel was always around to give a helping hand, the rest of the staff are very nice. We'll be booking next year, but next time we might go back to the gouin."
5651762,octanehi5,2017-07-07 15:48:00,1104,"never said a bad word about the gouin, yes it is a good fishery,Bin there done that,back when you had to fly to it, the slot limit has been imposed on Hebert for 15 yrs. the average size of fish is still growing, as it is on the gouin now that they do that. Far more fishermen visit the gouin now that it is a drive too lake.I stand by what I said about the best walleye fishery in Quebec. Let me know when you hear someone on the gouin personally catch over 900 walleyes in a week. you can not compare a fishery that has a controlled amount of fishermen,to one that does not.I look at the gouin every yr. as i fly over it. Its not the yrs. in your life its the life in your yrs. Good luck"
5653978,Freytown,2017-07-09 08:58:00,770,"Well, I don't know anyone that counts fish year after year, trip after trip...why bother????And I take your numbers with a gran of salt. 2014 at Hebert you claimed ""Over 800 Walleye, and 150 pike"" while a party member on the same trip reports ""Regardless, the four of us boated over 700 walleyes in our 9 days on the lake as well as 60 + pike"" Someone is telling a fish tale? http://www.canadafishingguide.net/fo...h-air-tamarac/https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=358977Hey I think my personal best on the Gouin is only 897...still trying for 900 tho.

Maybe one of these years I'll bother to count fish but it seems like we average 4-6 an hour per rod. Always been good enough for me; catching is an important component of the trip but far from the only one.
5655530,octanehi5,2017-07-10 06:25:00,1104,"Air Tamarac has its fishermen count daily the catch,pike and walleye, kept and released,I do not care what you believe, The guys that took these trips will tell you.Its to bad freytown You have a hard time walking and chewing gum at the same time,let alone count fish.Usually posts on WC we try to be positive,I must have ruffled your feathers along the way somewere.You are calling me a liar. Of coarse im going to react, I have been reporting on Hebert for Yrs. no need to lie ,yrs. that we caught 800 in a group as well as yrs. we caught 2250.My guys keep track.I had 4 real walleye fishermen from the Oneida area they fish for Walleye all the time kept very close track of numbers ,Two guys boated 216 walleye in one day,They had the time of their lives.You can contact them on Oneida Diehards, Facebook Scott and John If your going to ? posts get all the facts first 1710 walleye this yr as well as 85 pike Do your homework before you open your mouth and insert your foot They kept the tally Contact them"
5655650,Golden Eagle,2017-07-10 06:48:00,2642,I keep track of my catch by weight rather than numbers. I consider it a great week when I boat a half ton of pike and a half ton of walleyes. Doing so has me fishing 12-14 hour days. Weather has to cooperate. Going where the fish are is a must.
5655698,pjshorthorn,2017-07-10 07:01:00,5654,"It is your vacation. Report it as you see it. Who gives a rip what anyone else thinks ? I've had those 1000+ fish trips on Lac Seul and no one would ever believe me either. I would just shrug my shoulders and say, ""ok"" . And then I moved on or ended the conversation. Nowadays, I don't count fish for purposes of trip reports or discussions with others. If someone asks me how I did, stock answers are something like...."" Could have been better"", ""found a few here and there"", ""we had a lot of fun today"", "" I don't know, never kept track"", etc. I get your point clearly. Looks like Freytown was trying to make a point on the disparity of numbers between two fishing reports which I found interesting that anyone would dig up that information in the first place........ especially from years past. What I do know is this........whether there were 700 walleye caught or 800 caught....that is a fun fishing trip regardless. I enjoy reading your reports about fishing areas of Canada that I've never considered. Seems I need to expand my thinking for future trips. PjShorthorn"
5655738,Freytown,2017-07-10 07:16:00,770,I hope my new fishing tools will enhance my Canadian experience. Just hope my 60 pike catch doesn't increase to 150 pike when I get home.

It is my belief that the pike in the lake have taking a real beating, there are still big pike just not the numbers as in past yrs.Tips on the lake Walleye are very wind directed,ask the caretaker Daniel were to go he will tell you. My advice to you is to find the largest body of deep water and fish it from 32' feet and shallower. Good luck and let use know how you did. Thanks octanehi5"

Everything in camp 26 worked great, Fish house, water pump ,hot water shower,fridge ,freezer, Boats &motors, New boat dock was built while we were there,works great. 4 Guys catching 1700 Walleye's Is a trip to put on your bucket list.

Our only other trip with tamarac was to the Gouin and it was the greatest fishing experience we ever had (seriously). We usually book our trips beginning of June but due to scheduling conflicts the only time the three of us were able to go was in July. Mid summer fishing is a little out of our comfort zone but we'll see how things work out.
5651234,Freytown,2017-07-07 09:31:00,770,"Ron, Hebert is a great walleye lake and Air Tamarac a great outfitter but for my money I can go to the Gouin twice for the same amount of money.No weight restrictions, bigger pike and with the slot the Dore' are getting bigger and always had numerous numbers. 40 miles x 60 miles grows an awful lot of fish. Glad you had a good trip....don't sell the Gouin short, big mistake."
