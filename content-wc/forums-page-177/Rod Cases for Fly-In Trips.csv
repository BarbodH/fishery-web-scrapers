On my fly in's, I always bring 2-piece rods, for ease of transportation, etc. What do you think is the best rod case for a long, one-piece rod like this, if I want to take it with next summer? I did a search on Cabela's site, but didn't really get a good sense of what to go with. Thanks for any advice!"
5773857,NAV165,2017-09-19 10:05:00,412,I've got a Flambeau Bazuka rod case. It's adjustable out to about 8 feet. I put one and 2 piece rods in it. Works well for me. I stuff some newspaper in once all the rods are in just to keep them from bouncing around.
5774097,bthomas3333,2017-09-19 12:25:00,465,"Buy the case from St Croix off their website that matches the rod. I have 4 different sizes of their cases. Work great and price is right. 30 -50$http://stcroixrods.com/shop/rods-cases-sacks/I think the 6'10"" fits best in this one: RC86 I use them for multiple trips a year and have never had to replace them going on 8+ years.Brett"
5774129,gordy28,2017-09-19 13:04:00,437,I bought this one for my one piece rods and after two trips I am very happy with ithttp://www.planomolding.com/fishing/...rod-tube-largeI have had 5 rods in it with no problems - longest would be 7 feetCheersGordy

I stop when I have time and just browse to see if I can figure out what makes the rod a ""second"". Sometimes it is the smallest and insignificant thing. Great prices too."

5776089,halfmoon007,2017-09-20 17:10:00,121,Its all about weight. I use a 4 inch Plano that extends to 8 feet and we can get 10 rods in it and its 4 lbs empty. been using it for years works good. Halfmoon
