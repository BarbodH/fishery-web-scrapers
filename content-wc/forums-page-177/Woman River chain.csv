5702986,HeHooksHimself,2017-08-05 10:17:00,725,Doc and I have the good fortune of heading up to Woman River Camp to visit Paul and Deb and fish from their outpost. The trip will be in mid Sept. I was wondering if anyone could report on their fishing experiences on that chain this year or if anyone has advice on fall fishing there. I would appreciate any input. FISH ON! Hooks

5721106,wooglin,2017-08-16 12:39:00,371,"You will have no problem catching nice big walleye - average size on Woman River is better than Lac Seul, and quantities a bit less (in my experience) - and by less, I mean not much less. The boats have been upgraded big time, 35 and 50 HP motors, electronics....etc. You will not be disappointed. Good luck!"

5774857,Guest,2017-09-19 20:39:00,0,dear sir we fished from the outpost about 5 yrs ago I would recommend you go a few days to the portage lake north of outpost( about 15 min walk to lake easy walk ) our best walleye fishing there ;very deep golden colored walleyes ;on the chain itself the walleye fishing was just average deeper than in spring hope this helps jim wolf Chicago boys fished 9/10-17
