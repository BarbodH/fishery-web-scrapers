The question of how you rate a trip has been discussed before, I rarely rely on just the numbers of fish caught. This trip was going to be different on many fronts, first a new lake and camp, second, a second trip with my wife, she gave me a great birthday gift in January, she told me if I took her fishing then I would have a trip this year! Wanting to try Cedar for years now, deposit sent and plans made. Knowing this would be a different trip, not an all day and night kind of trip, my concern was finding balance between time on the water and keeping my wife happy too. The first couple of days it was clear skies, windy, each day the wind was from a different direction. Fish were deep and most groups were having a hard time putting fish, especially walleye in the boat. Even groups coming to Cedar for years were having a hard time getting on the fish, crappie seemed to be active, not any luck for me. The warm days we fished early, came in during the heat of midday for lunch reading and naps. Going back out for some evening fishing, then back to the cabin for movie's on my laptop. Things changed on Tuesday morning, we tried the burned out railway bridge for walleye. Jig and minnows, my comfort zone, got a bite or maybe a snag, until it started to move! Long runs on both sides of the boat! Several times got close to a look, only to hear the drag sequel again! Eventually got the musky to the side of the boat, three tries later got the fish in the net! Big mid 40 inch musky cooperated enough for a couple of pics! (Trying to post from phone) I had one thing checked off the bucket list! The other great day was Thursday, cooler, cloudy and a north wind,the walleyes turned on! Fishing the Cedar River again, caught some chunky 17 inchers for the frying pan! More just for fun! After lunch went back out for a few more just for fun,the last walleye was the biggest of the trip! 23 inches and fought hard and strong! Got a picture, released the fish back into the river, an eagle flew by one side of the boat, circled the boat and grabbed the walleye and flew off! I managed to get a picture of the eagle flying off with his supper! (Moderator, a little help!) When my wife started to ask about learning how to fish and wanting to make a return trip! Back to how to evaluate a weeks fishing!? For me this was a good trip! Big musky! Getting the pic of the eagle, the call of the loons, the eagles, sharing all this with my wife made for a great trip!"

5770425,Limeyangler,2017-09-17 10:24:00,563,"Great report, sounds ideal! Always wondered about folks who need 'numbers' of walleye in the boat, if you want that get a net and commercial fishing license...lol...just relax, the fish will come and in the meantime breathe in the surroundings."

Great location on Cedar, with nice clean cabins, newer docks and are excellent hosts. Bet you two will be back up at Cedar next year.....what I and my friends enjoy is that Cedar is an easy lake to navigate, has few underwater obstructions and ""most"" days Cedar offers good to very good fishing (I did say ""most"" days)....ha. Rich"
