5755441,ziggyzag,2017-09-06 15:18:00,125,You will have a blast that time of the year I am sure the fish will be stacked at the in flowing river mouth and up the river. Our group has fished this system (6) times but we stayed on Kap but fished Tennant also. Hopefully the water level is such that you will be able to go to Kap and Melchett also a little lake named Tester. Good fishing and good luck.
