The grouse were playing shy but I got lucky on the way out when I spotted 3 right at the landing, did not see another single grouse apart from those. I wanted to target bass and they did not disappoint. I also target some walleye which were less enthusiastic than the bass but abundant none the less. The Bass were shallow, the walleye deep and the grouse DELICIOUS!VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/Fy5ZDNLYEQc"
