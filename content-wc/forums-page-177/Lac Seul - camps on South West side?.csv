5767993,Remi,2017-09-15 08:12:00,41,"Hi All, I'm looking for recommendations, I've looked at many camp websites, but first hand experience from the Walleye Central group is always welcome. Few points to help you understand where I come from: 1) Fishing crew: I'm 38 years old, wife + kids, and Uncle 65 years old with numerous health concerns, gets around slow, but still can fish all day. Me and Uncle have 20 trips to Canada. 2) With all the above, Fishing from my own boat is a must, the seat is comfortable for my uncle. 3) I'm looking for a cheap place, yes I said it, cost is part of it. (Silver Wheel Lodge - I can't swing that). 4) Basics is all we need, bring our food to camp, cook ourselves, fillet fish ourselves. You get the picture. Electric is optional, but after staying at camp with electric at dock, that sure is nice. 5) We have fished at Cliff Lake, Eagle Lake, etc...our crew will fish 8 hours per day, even the kids love it. After fishing, we play cards and enjoy the jokes, etc.... I want to try Lac Seul, so many camps to try, but I don't want to strike out on my needs and value your suggestions. I don't want to be in the Ear Falls area, more South/Central is where I would like to fish and therefore want to narrow the camps to that area. Consider the Williams Lake Lodge, but they don't allow private boats. THANK YOU !"

5768025,jakeman,2017-09-15 08:41:00,32,"If you want inexpensive and good enough, we spend a week here annually on our dudes trip. Nice protected marina and accommodations are adequate. Good fishing within a few miles of the resort. On the reservation, but have no issues with theft. http://www.lacseulresort.com/Give Jon a call."
5768337,dan cardinal,2017-09-15 13:02:00,64,"You are on the right track with Williams Lodge in exception for taking your own boat. I would highly recommend looking at their upgrade boats due to they have some very comfortable rigs available. Depending on what type of seat you have... it is possible it could interchange with the seat in a camp boat? I would be a little concerned about the health issues of your uncle and the hill that is necessary to climb to get to the cabins at Williams. Other than that, this camp would be an excellent choice for you. Love the walleye opportunities in this area of Lac Seul. Option 2 would be Onaway lodge. Your own boat is not an issue. Excellent accessibility. All the amenities would provide well for you. Awesome cabins... service and everything is top notch. You won't find better facilities! Docks, fish house... the finest available! Fishing in this area is outstanding. Lots of options. Book early!Never fished out of fisherman's Cove or Lac Seul Lodge. These two camps are in the same general area as Onaway. Both these camps have excellent reviews, and offer own boat packages."
5768345,Pooch,2017-09-15 13:20:00,4618,"I doubt there is really a ""Bad"" camp on LS. Especially south of Ear Falls.If you want reservations for any of them it can be hard so start now. Nearly everyone rebooks the next years trip before they leave camp this year. Open dates are rare. Best chance for an open date would be early or later fall. Which is good as LS seems to get better the later the summer gets. Late fall can be spotty weather as we have experienced some really chilly, windy days and we have also had summer like weather, too.Don't take too long to decide. With your Uncle and kids the layout (terrain) of the camp might be important?Pooch"
5768417,stjoeguy,2017-09-15 15:21:00,979,Onaway Lodge had one of the best docks I've seen. Electrical outlets on the dock and wide.http://www.onawaylodge.com/equipment/
5768457,Carnhzkr,2017-09-15 16:24:00,964,"There really isn't anything that I'd call ""SW side"". You've got around a dozen camps near Ear Falls, then about 10 - 15 miles south of there, you've got, in this order: Lac Seul Lodge on Rat Bay Fisherman's Cove and Onaway, both on Scout Bay Scout Lake Lodge in Scout Lake which feeds into LS There's nothing on LS further south, but if you go around to the east you've then got Williams Lake Lodge. I've never stayed at WL Lodge, but I think it's a pretty good boat ride up a narrow channel to get to the fishing area on LS. I've stayed at LS Lodge and FC numerous times and would highly recommend either, however if you're looking for cheap, none of those meet my definition of cheap. If cheap is your goal, I do offer a solution. There is a public boat launch on Scout Bay, and about 5 miles south of there is Rainbow Point Lodge on Perrault Lake. I have a good buddy that stays at Rainbow for around $350 pp/wk and puts in at Scout Bay on LS everyday. I've been staying at Fisherman's Cove for the past 3 or 4 years and pay around $650 (something like that). LS Lodge is around the same $ and so is Onaway. A lot of people on this site like Onaway, but I've never stayed there since their week runs Friday - Friday which doesn't work well for me. I haven't heard much good about Scout Lake Lodge. So if LS is your goal, it pretty much comes down to one of the lodges near Ear Falls, or LSL/FC/Onaway for around 600 - 700 pp/wk, or Rainbow Point for $350ish."
5768553,Remi,2017-09-15 19:00:00,41,"Wow, thank you everyone for the tips."
5775337,pastorted,2017-09-20 09:01:00,19,"Timberlane up by Ear Falls might be another option. It is a basic camp with decent cabins and dock. I haven't stayed there in the past 5-6 years, but have done so previously several times. I have always found them to have the cheapest prices in this area of Lac Seul."
