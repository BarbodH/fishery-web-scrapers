Any suggestions for a lodge that meets the following criteria?A large system of kid-friendly and legal ATV trails accessible from campA scenic lake with that classic ""Canadian shield"" look and feelCabins and boat rentals with a family friendly camp atmosphere - swimming, playground, ice cream etc.Solid fishing. Numbers more important than size. Walleye, pike, bass etcIcing on the cake would be bush lakes accessible by ATVs Location: No further NW than say Hornepayne, Wawa, White River area."
5767769,cozz3,2017-09-15 05:40:00,5,You might want to take a look at Lunkinto Lake Lodge. Really nice cabins and the owners treat you like family. It's maybe another 1 1/2 hours past Hornepayne. My wife and kids have stayed there 4 of the last 5 years. We bring our atvs for after dinner rides and to trailer boats to the surrounding lakes. Lots of trails in the area. The most miles we logged in a day was 60 and that was trailoring a boat down an abandoned logging road to a remote lake. Fishing has always been really good but we don't fish the main camp lake since its only lakers. We trailer or pack in our 9.9 motors to lakes Danny has placed boats. We target walleye and finish off the day with a 30 minute or race to five pike tournament between the two boats. I have lots of pictures and video from our trips if your interested in more info
5778393,MrSimon,2017-09-22 10:47:00,922,"I've been searching and the Gowganda Lake area looks very promising. The main lake seems OK with acceptable fishing and not THAT much development, considering it's right on the main road. Very scenic, easy drive, nice camps, groceries close etc. The bush lakes look fantastic with straightforward ATV access, or even truck access. I really like that since I'll have kids with me. I want adventure .... but not anything too crazy. Does anyone have info on the four lodges on the lake? I'll call each one with my list of questions, but always appreciate feedback from WC!http://www.gowbushkon.comhttp://gowgandalakelodge.comhttp://www.lookoutpointcamp.comhttp://www.auldreekielodge.com/"
