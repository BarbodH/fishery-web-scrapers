5730737,halfmoon007,2017-08-21 18:14:00,121,Hi all leaving in 12 days for a second Nakina trip for 2017. Looking for any info on the fishing the north end of Onaman lake. Just now looking at depth on a Onaman lake map and a bit worried about the shallowness of the north end. Not worried for the 2 pike fisherman going with us but little brother and I are 100% walleye guys. Any input on the north end of the lake or also the Bauer's north end cabin would be helpful. Feel free to PM me . Thanks Halfmoon

I did the portage in last fall fished south end only, we caught fish consistently in less than 10 feet, as shallow as 6 and that was around sept 20 when you would expect them a little deeper (turnover). Try to post a report when you get back, it will be appreciated! I've heard its not a good pike lake that's whats been holding me back from taking my kids there. The privacy of the north end camp is intriguing."

We fished a small lake that had a maximum depth around 15 to 18 feet. The vast majority was in the 8 - 10 foot range. We had some of the most insane Walleye fishing I have found in the Nakina area on that lake. As I started to motor away from launching, the guy with me threw in a large daredevil with big leader and almost immediately caught a 20"" Walleye. At that moment, I thought this could be a good Walleye lake even though we went to it expecting to find Northern. We caught about 50 Walleye in four hours and this was NOT a fly-in lake, we drove to it. The moral of the story is some of the shallower lakes in the Nakina area have great Walleye populations. Not saying your lake is going to have great Walleye fishing, but being shallower certainly doesn't rule it out."

The walleyes are shallow in Onaman, rip jigs through the cabbage and you will catch loads. their average size is awesome. I have also caught dandy pike in Onaman just not numbers. This is a walleye factory like you won't believe!"
5735065,Moosebunk,2017-08-23 19:47:00,211,"The lake is loaded with better than average sized walleye. You know how to fish'em you'll do well catching 'em. It's actually BIG pike that are trickier on the lake... For such a shallow body with tonnes of forage for pike, it's odd there aren't more giants caught. Hope you crack the code."
5736753,halfmoon007,2017-08-24 16:47:00,121,Thank you for your reply's and the full page pm from a WC fisherman that just came back from Onaman. I feel much better with all the reasureing responses. Thanks again Halfmoon

5772305,vteye2,2017-09-18 13:55:00,123,Hey halfmoon - how about a trip report??
5774441,halfmoon007,2017-09-19 16:56:00,121,"Hi all The best word to summarize the trip was challenging. All that north area is shallow. we were told they fish the 7 foot deep by about 40 foot wide troffs around the shores up there. It really did not work for us. We traveled long distances and fished the Gnarly boulder points and shore- lines where the wind was was blowing into and did real good with walleyes. Biggest was 28 1/2 and biggest pike was 36 all on 1/4 jig with yellow or orange twister tail. Early in the week barometer fell all the way to 29.1 and things got real slow. Was wishing this hard core plastics guy had a few crawlers to tip with LOL. 2 days later barometer back up to 30 and they were slamming them again. Our 2 pike fisherman struggled all week, they were catching pike but no size. It was a good trip and Onaman has Quality walleyes fat and very very lively. We had a very hard time catching eaters. All to BIG! nice problem huh. The cabin was was sufficient but no shower. Little brother bungee'd a cooler with a drain to the porch rail and we filled it with 15 gal. of 80 degree water heating on kitchen stove and all 4 of got our ride out shower. it worked great. We could see were if you could get booked in to Mike and Carol Baures picnic island with their 14 foot Lund deep vee's with 15hp motors. it would make things much easier. Hey its a big lake and when it gets windy it gets Ruff. The Gnarly areas we fished were awesome but also ate a lot of jigs and even had to break a buoy marker line off it was stuck in the rubble LOL that was a 1st. In closing I will say again Onaman lake has VERY Quality walleyes and gave these 2 walleye guys a nice challenge. Halfmoon"
