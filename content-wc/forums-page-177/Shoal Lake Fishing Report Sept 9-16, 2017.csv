Weather for week varied from 55 and light rain to clear and a record 90 degrees. 2 days and part of a third included strong winds that made boat control and casting accuracy a challenge and, while I like fishing wind-blown points and islands, did eliminate a few spots due to risk of being tossed out of boat or slammed against unseen rocks. In other words, about what you'd expect weatherwise on a typical Canadian trip. The water had a slight bloom which was a little unusual especially for that time of year. Water temps 65-66 cooling slightly toward end of week. Fishing was good but not great and certainly not what I expected for pike. Best pike was 38"" and caught 45 minutes into my trip. Only a handful of fish over 30"" with tons of 24-28"" pike which were aggressive and fought with tenacity. Bigger pike were not to be had on rocky points or in cabbage beds although smaller pike seemed to be everywhere. Rattletraps on rocks and spoons and spinnerbaits over and around weeds caught pike with regularity. Smallmouth were fair to good in both numbers and size. Best was a very chunky 18 but lots of fish 16-17, and lots smaller so good size structure indicating a healthy population. Bass were anywhere and everywhere as they were on deep rock points, shallow (8') shorelines, on deep cabbage weed edges and in 3-4' junk weeds. Rattletraps on rocks and spinnerbaits on weeds was again what worked for me. Topwater produced little. Did not target walleye as it's illegal to do so. Did catch walleye up to 26"" incidental to bass/pike fishing. Only 3 out of an estimated 25 walleye were under 20"" with most 20-22"". No smaller walleye is attributable to my use of mostly larger pike baits on rocky points. They are a beautiful golden color with good girth and a robust appearance indicating,again, a healthy population. I fished primarily within 3-4 miles of the camp but did make 2 runs to Labyrinth Bay. There are lots of prime fishing spots close to camp. Many have the combination of shallow rock with clusters of deep weeds and quick access to deep water that seems to produce consistently good action. Two separate people, one a local guide, said the fishing was ""the worst in 30 years."" The general consensus from internet searches and chatting up marina/bait shop folks in Kenora is that Shoal isn't what it once was. That said, I'm still very positive on Shoal and will most likely make return trips. While the summer and fall fishing was tough, even by the admission of the owner of Shoal Lake Lodge, there is much to like about Shoal. *** A few words on the lodge. Nice cabins, good docks with 24 hour electric and a self serve ice machine. I had my own boat but camp boats appeared to be typical camp boats. Gas in very limited supple is available at camp but is available at the commercial landing. Price was $1.129/ liter at the landing which also has drive-up pumps for autos. The drive after turning off highway is 5 miles of windy blacktop and then 5 miles of some of the most washboarded road you will ever find. It took 21 minutes to drive those 5 miles but that included a short stop to watch the 500 pound bear at the garbage dump along the way. Tim and his crew at Shoal Lake Lodge were friendly and attentive. The Saturday evening barbecue for all guests was delicious and a great way to kick off the week. My wife, who quilted all week, and I were on the HK plan while all others in camp were American plan. All reports were that the food was excellent. The main lodge is open 7-7 and has wifi available. The game room has satellite TV available 24 hours. Cell phone coverage was spotty at camp and on the water. One final note, and you've heard it before but it bears repeating, DO NOT get careless on this lake with regards to the hazards. I found a rock one foot below the surface that was not on any chart. The rock was a cast length in all directions from 50' of water. Good common sense like you always use on all Canadian waters, plus a little extra, will keep you safe."

5770201,Lazy Fisherman,2017-09-17 08:20:00,276,"Thanks for sharing your report. I have often thought about venturing into Shoal Lake, but have worried about the uncharted waters. Sounds like one of my trips when the wife is along, as she will also stay at the cabin and quilt."
5770489,Multispecies Guy,2017-09-17 11:50:00,447,"Shoal is mostly uncharted but a portion is charted. I still don't trust that it's accurately charted though. There are buoyed travel routes like there are on LOTW. Tim Kobelka of SLL does provide some guidance on rock avoidance to guests. Plus he meets guests at the boat launch and leads them to camp, hauling gear in his boat. To me it was very similar to being on unfamiliar portions of LOTW for the first time. Much caution needed but no reason to avoid fishing it unless one prefers hazard free waters."
5770569,Thompmd,2017-09-17 13:54:00,320,Thanks for the report and it sounds like you enjoyed your trip. 90deg...ugg!! So if you were to return what would you do differently. Were there noticeably fewer people?We considered SLL but ended up going to Ash Rapids. Any Crappies in Shoal?
5770601,Multispecies Guy,2017-09-17 14:29:00,447,"Differently--not much. Would probably go in early June rather than mid September. I wanted to go the last week in September but the week we went was the camp's last week before closing. Inevitably I would explore new spots but I covered a good amount of water last week. Fewer people---fewer than most of the other lakes I've been to. Saw maybe 5 boats per day either fishing or traveling. There was not a single time when someone was on a spot I wanted to fish. Boat traffic was a non factor, most of the boats were from SLL. Crappies---yes, didn't catch any but didn't fish baits that I would expect to catch crappies on. Marked fish I suspected were crappies. Camp owner says there are perch in fishable numbers too. One experience I forgot to mention, had a hit about 15 feet from boat from a fish I didn't see. I missed the fish and, suspecting a pike, went into a figure 8 at boatside. After almost a full figure 8 I hooked and landed a 23"" walleye. My first figure 8 walleye."
