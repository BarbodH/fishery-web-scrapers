Looking for someplace closer that we can still have the great walleye fishing. Don't want to drive all the way to Canada to catch tons of 14 and 15"" fish. Didn't catch any big fish in Flin Flon. Hoping the Canada experts can help with someplace to go. Heard some good things about Dogtooth Lake outside Kenora. Fellow fisherman don't really want to ""rough it"". We have all our own equipment and will be going the same time of year. Thanks for the help!!"
