Walleyes are abundant but awfully small 14 to 17 average. We had 8 people in our group and fished 9 days. NEVER caught a walleye over 22 inches. We did catch a couple of Pike over 40 though. average pike was 30 inches. Lake is Shallow and weedy. Deepest spot is about 40 feet according to my 350a. Take a small generator if you need to charge batteries. This lake has been fished hard for too long. The guys I went with have been going there for 10 years, only because they like White River Air. The good lake they used to fly to was named Gourlay, but that one is always booked the week they want to go. I personally wouldn't want to go back to Naimegos. LAke Erie fishing is better and much closer plus the fish are bigger."
