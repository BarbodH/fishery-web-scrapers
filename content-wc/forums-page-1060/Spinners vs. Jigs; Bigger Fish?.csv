I try and troll until I find the fish concentrated but usually that is not the case. I have been hearing mixed ideas on spinners and jigs and was wondering which one catches bigger fish because I am not sure if I should change my habits. I catch plenty of walleye on the spinners, but am still looking for that wall hanger. Thanks for any imput."
