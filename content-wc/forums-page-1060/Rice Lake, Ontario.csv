I only fish for walleye, the best thing to do is to jig the weed beds. In the evening after dark, try a 4 inch jointed floating minnow close to shore. Bring lots of white or black Mr. Twisters or bucktail jigs. You can purchase bucktail jigs from local baitshops for about $1.50 each. I prefer bucktails to Mr. Twisters because they can take lots of abuse and stay shart longer. Keep your hooks sharp."
