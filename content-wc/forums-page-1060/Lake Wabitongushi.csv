509023,Guest,2000-07-12 18:19:00,0,I have been going up to Wabatongushi for the past 5 years and have seen improvement in the fishery every year. The ministry instituted a slot size and I think this has helped. It is a large body of water and has some very deep areas (175ft.)and some very shallow rocky shorelines. I have had good luck trolling or drifting jigs on the bottom in 10ft of water along the shoreline at dusk. This lake has many points and bays which I will usually fish in between the points taking advantage of the drop offs into deeper water.I have also had luck casting into rocky windswept shorelines with Hot n Tots which are bounced off the rocks and attract attention at dusk and dawn.I think you have to be prepared to experiment and if one tactic is not working try another until you get the pattern. It is a beautiful lake and I have always enjoyed my stay. if you have any specific questions please e-mail me.Steve.
