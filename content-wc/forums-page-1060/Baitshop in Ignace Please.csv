509018,Guest,2000-07-12 08:25:00,0,"Castle Baits, on the north side of the highway, about a mile west of the Hwy 599 turnoff has the best bait. Used them many times."
509019,Guest,2000-07-12 10:27:00,0,Yep - Castle Baits is the one - I think there is another shop in town but not sure where. Castle is accross the street from the Northwinds Motel.Are you flying in thru Brad?

He supplies minnows and leeches for the surrounding areas so you are pretty much buying it at the source from him........he can oxygen pack anything for you......
509021,Guest,2000-07-13 11:48:00,0,"yes there are two bait shops in ignace both sell leaches and anything elce you will need.I go there every spring,the fishing is great."
