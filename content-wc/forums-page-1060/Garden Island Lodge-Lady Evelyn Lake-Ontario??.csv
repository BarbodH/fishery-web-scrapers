509076,Guest,2000-07-15 10:58:00,0,We are looking for information on this lodge and none of their websites are working. We called and got no answer on their phone and was wondering if they are still in business. How are the other 2 lodges and fishing in general on this lake? Thanks
509077,Guest,2000-07-15 15:37:00,0,"I have been up to Lady Lake Evelyn 5 times orso over the past few years....all in early Sept except for this past June, where my son and I went up the first week and stayed at the Red Pine Lodge.All previous trips were at the Island 10 Lodge.Have never stayed at Garden Island Lodge, althoughit's website looks like it's a nice place.The walleye fishing is fairly decent, but neverknown it to be great.....I've pulled walleye outup to 7 1/2 lbs, and my son pulled one this lasttrip in June that went 28 in. Always got out limits and then some, but had to work for thefish.From what I have seen, the Island 10 accomodationsare hands down the nicest on the lake, with eitherGarden Island or Red Pine coming in 2nd. The lake water is clean, clear and you basically have most of the lake to yourself, although you do see some other boats from time to time...it's NOT virgin water (as they'd like you to think), but it's a neat experience going up the MontrealRiver, and portaging around the dam...and thengoing back up the lake to one of the lodges. If you tell me when you're thinking about goingup, I could be more specific with the fishinginfo...pike fishing is so-so, as is the Smallmouth bass fishing. Beautiful lake, and sometimein the future, I'll be going back...but for the""whole experience"" as opposed to going up just for the fishing."
