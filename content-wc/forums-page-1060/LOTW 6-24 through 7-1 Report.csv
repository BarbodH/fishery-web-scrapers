508957,Brownie,2000-07-06 09:10:00,12,"We just wrapped up a trip out of Sioux Narrows (Lake of the Woods Houseboats)on Saturday the 1st. Fishing was decent, but not great. We caught as many small walleye (less than 16"") as you could want, fishing in and around the mouth of Yellow Girl Bay, Chisolm Island and Shore Island. Most of the fish we caught were in the 30' range, and we took most of bottom bouncers and worm harnesses. However, you could take them with jigs and leaches or jigs and crawlers. We did not have much luck with minnows. The last hour or so before dark and the hour or so after, we had good luck trolling crank baits (walleye divers and shad raps) in the 12-15' zone on the same areas. Muskie fishing was very slow, although we did boat a couple very small ones, and finally did see some nice fish (mid to upper 30s to low 40s) on the last day of the trip around Fire Island. In town they were reporting seeing a couple of 50"" class fish around fire island. We did not see those fish, but we did see quite a few muskie. Northern and smallmouth fishing was decent, but not great. We had our best luck in Bear Bay (just outside of Yellow Girl Bay) casting floating raps, shad raps, and tube jigs. It seemed that small bay had warmed up faster than the main lake areas. We hit the main lake rock piles and humps pretty hard, and only picked up a few smallmouth here and there. We caught a couple of nice (29"" lake trout) around Dinner Island, and a few smaller ones down near Three Sisters. We caught all the trout in the 70' range, either trolling spoons, or jigging. Both seemed to work equally well. All in all, it was a great trip, but were a little dissappointed in the Muskie and smallmouth fishing. Good luck."
508958,pondigger,2000-07-06 14:17:00,31,Thanks for the report Brownie. I sure appreciate it.We camped at LOTW Houseboats last year. We fished the last week of July.Had a tough time finding walleyes but the pike cooperated.Yellow girl and happy face were about as far as we got.Did you find any walleyes shallower than 30'and did they bite all during the day or was it a dawn and dusk bite.Going this year 1st week of August. I just bought some Muskie gear. What would you throw for em and where might you look 1st week of August. Thanks in advance Pondigger
508959,Brownie,2000-07-13 06:36:00,12,"We did catch walleye all day long. The shallow bite, however, was only the last hour before dark. Otherwise, all of our walleye were caught in at least 20', but most in the 30' zone. We even caught some as deep as 40'. Apparently, some of the other groups fishing at the same time were catching bigger fish jigging in the 25' to 30' range. As far as muskie go, I would suggest the basics -- some bucktails (I like the Harasser bucktails which have the small blade dangling behind the treble hook -- either willow or colorado blades) in a variety of colors, some super shad raps (perch or silver w/black back), a couple of magnum raps (even the magnum jointed rap which is only 5"" or so long), a couple of weighted Suicks, and at least a couple of top water baits (the hot ticket our last 2 trips to Rowan Lake was a black hog wobbler at or after dark). I would also suggest getting a couple of maps from Fishing Hot Spots. They are reasonably well detailed, and their information is consistent with the information we received from the locals. Good Luck."
