508189,Moose,2000-07-14 10:57:00,248,"Well...I'm glad you had a good trip. I'm getting a little nervous about the quality of fishing on Perault, but I guess I'll have to see what happens. If it's any consolation, I saw several reports that were reporting fewer fish than normal (a lot of bad weather), so maybe the planets just arn't in line...lol Those fly-ins sound great...to bad you had to spend the extra money to really get into the fish...but that sure sounds nice. I did receive a piece of advice that the no drive in camp can compete with a fly-in camp when it comes to fishing. I really didn't want to believe that, but I'm beggining to wonder. I'm gonna do 1 more drive-in trip...if it dosn't pan out...fly-in's here I come. Again, really glad you enjoyed yourself...I'm sure even with few fish you were having a lot more fun than I was at work...Thanks for the report!!"
508179,Guest,2000-06-06 23:03:00,0,My Son and I are headed to Manotak Lodge @ perraultlake/cedar lake. His first Canada trip. I would appreciate any advice/tactics/tips etc on lures/bait patterns depth etc. We will be there the last week in june. Thanks
508180,Guest,2000-06-07 09:02:00,0,"Hi, I was there last fall (early Sept.) and ran into pretty slow fihing since it had been raining for three weeks straight and rained most of the time were there. The best spot we found was actually in the channel right in front of the lodge and the cabins. We trolled bouncers and spinners with minnows and worms and managed to catch a few nice eyes. They are really nice folks there and will get you maps and point out spots to try when you get there. There is a large triagular ""flats"" area with a good dropoff a ways out from the lodge that seems to be pretty good in the early morning and evening but the lake got too wild for us to stay out there on the point but is definitly worth a try.But they will point you in the right direction.** Note ** If you have minnows left at the end of the day make sure to wire the floating buckets shut or there is a darn otter that will completely clen them out for you!"

508182,Moose,2000-06-08 08:48:00,248,"Justapiker, You doing any fly-in's while your there? As you know, I've booked a group of 14 for 2001...absolutely can't wait to get there. Really interested in hearing how you do.See ya..."
508183,Guest,2000-06-12 14:55:00,0,I was there the first week of june. We stayed at rocky shore lodge just down from where you are staying. We caught most of our eye's on crawler harness in jackfish bay trolling as slow as we could. Most of the pike and smallmouth's were caught on clear twister tails with a black head.
508184,Guest,2000-06-12 16:15:00,0,"Thanks Brad!!!!If anyone else is in the area of Perrault Falls please feel free to respond. After our trip we will post a message or you can post and I will send you my email address.....""justapiker"""

508186,Moose,2000-07-06 10:33:00,248,"How did ya do??? I'd love to hear a trip report. Sounds like the weather up that way has been pretty lowsy...Hope you had a good trip!Thanks,Moose"
508187,Guest,2000-07-12 18:57:00,0,"TRIP REPORT for Moose and anyone else interested. We had a great time the food was very good the cabin was great the boats and lodge provided equipment were very good. The fishing on Perrault was very poor. Probably my worst Canadian lake experiance ever of over 15 lakes. We did talk to a couple who had been there before and they said it was unusual, and that they have had great fishing in previous years. Did catch 1 nice pike and a slew of small ones. My son and I flew out to a lake called Twain lake ($125 each) caught 50-60 walleyes each. We also fished a nice musky lake about 25 miles away with monster musky. We had a 50 inch plus musky follow my sons lure to the boat bite and let go! We had at least 25 follows each an awsome musky day! The lodge owners set us up with the side trips and were very miffed that the fish were not biting on their lake. All in all a great trip! ""justapiker"""
508188,Nette B,2000-07-13 20:11:00,39,"I hear you justapiker. The fishing was pretty bad untill later in the week. Although we did have alot of fun on the muskie lake eventhough you gave us the 4-horse. give me an e-mail. As John would say ""watch out for rocks, and catch lots of baass."""
