Last year we got them in Fort Francis right accross the border, but if people have had problems finding them I will ask my resort owner to reserve some for me. (I'd rather see them before I buy if I can) Please no comments about the new border laws, they do not bother me as long as the supply keeps up.ThanksIaCraig"

We kept our in a small cooler all week. I changed about 2/3's of the water everyday and put a freshly frozen ice substitute in everyday."
