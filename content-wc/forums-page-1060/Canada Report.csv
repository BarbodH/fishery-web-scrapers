Most of our fishing in August was on the reefs with jigs with leeches, crawlers and, minnows. We have used worm harnesses also. Just hoping for a little scouting report from anyone just getting back this week. Whats working? and what isn't? Are they on the reefs? What depth? Thanks in advance for any reports."

Leeches on Lindy rigs, minnows on jigs, and white power grubs on jigs all produced well, in that order. More fish over 21 inches than in previous eight years. Walleyes were still near spawning areas, in 8 to 14 feet of water, in bays were the wind was blowing in. Shad raps and Risto raps didn't produce anywhere near like last year. Water was 66 to 68 degrees."
