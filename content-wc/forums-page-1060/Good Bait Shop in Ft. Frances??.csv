508996,Guest,2000-07-13 13:39:00,0,Go to Rainy Lake Baits. Located on just east of downtown Fort Francis on HWY 11. Excellent shop. If you are planning on using HWY 502 to get to Dryden you may want to check traffic conditions as I heard that there is a lot of road construction. (Second hand info so check it out.) TGG
