547401,Guest,2005-04-28 12:09:00,0,Couple of guys I know went there two years ago and they had a great time and caught plenty of fish. The only reason they didnt go back is they started fishing with our group and we have been going to another Resort for the last ten years and like it just fine. Good Luck and Be Safe.
547436,Guest,2005-04-29 09:56:00,0,Use to go there all the time. Caught my two largest walleye on that lake several years ago. Some great Northern action to. I use to backtroll orange floating jigs tipped with minnows.
