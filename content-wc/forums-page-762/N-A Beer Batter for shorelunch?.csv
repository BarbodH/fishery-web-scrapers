547905,esgrams,2005-05-13 11:36:00,92,"Just a quick question on the regulations on beer in the boat, what exactly do they say and what is the penalty for it, have to be honest we havn't gotten checked by a CO for probably 10-12 years and then it was just a quick fish count no other questions..Thanks for the response.."
547909,Frankm,2005-05-13 12:03:00,154,I think I heard its $250 for the driver and $125 for the passenger.
547911,Guest,2005-05-13 12:15:00,0,Tupperware....premix. Problem solved! (as mentioned)
547912,Gary_IA,2005-05-13 12:22:00,144,What about taking beer to boat in resorts or outposts along with your other food and supplies? Is that OK or should you be on the wagon during that time? I think I would take beer to the resort and when I leave the resort for home but not have beer or alcoholic beverages in the boat with me on any other ocassion. Has anyone been nailed in such situations?
547851,NateW,2005-05-12 15:31:00,96,"Like everyone I have a great recipe for beer batter and would love to use it for shorelunch. But we all know the rules on beer in the boat are strictly enforced--especially on Lac Seul. So will an non-alcoholic beer in the boat get me in trouble? Can't imagine it would, but then those MNR guys might have a reason I hadn't yet thought of. Anyone know the answer to this?"
547869,Guest,2005-05-12 21:02:00,0,I think I'd take my chances.....
547871,Larry L,2005-05-12 22:19:00,335,About 15 years ago I crossed the border with some N/A beer. The border guard had never heard of such a thing and thought we were trying to pull something. I would have to think that N/A beer does not sell well in Canada even now. But I would also think that you should not have a problem with it. Good luck. Larry
547872,Guest,2005-05-13 00:50:00,0,Hi. can you mix it up before you go out for the day? the worst thing is that they will make you pour it into the lake.
547874,manitobawalleye,2005-05-13 05:00:00,885,na beer will not get you in trouble it is sold in grocery stores here and is even brewed under the labatt label
547880,Frankm,2005-05-13 06:16:00,154,If don't want to take the chance bring a can of 7UP for the substitute. It works fine.
547881,Big Tim,2005-05-13 06:29:00,63,"We always put ONE can of beer down in the shore lunch box. Is it legal? NO. If we ever get stopped I hope they either miss it, or cut us a little slack since we obviously have one can, non chilled, down in the stoage in the bow, for use in cooking. Of course we are a group of 50 something, ""respectable"" gents, not 20 something ""party animals"". 5 years & we never have been checked. Several years ago a group of 3 joined us & INSISTED on bringing a case or more of beer with them every day. They were lucky. They were also not invited to join our group again. As a side note they DID lose the lower unit on their motor that week. :shame: Wishin' I was fishin'"
547888,Guest,2005-05-13 08:03:00,0,"you have a problem with the one beer in your boat my friend. You can't leave the MT can on shore and if you bring it with you, it is concidered an open can in your boat, and you are breaking the law. Personnally, i just don't see taking the chance for walleye batter."
547894,NateW,2005-05-13 09:29:00,96,"I am not going to go out with one can of regular beer in my boat. A couple years ago we were stopped shortly after having our shorelunch. We had no beer with us, but the place where we had cooked somebody had left behind a bunch of trash. Being responsible--and since we had extra garbage bags, we picked the garbage up including two crushed and obviously faded beer cans. While checking licenses and fish the CO asked about the garbage. When we showed it to him he read us the riot act about having ""beer on board"" and only with some fast talking by us and showing him the cans had obviously been half burried in sand, did we get out of a ticket. I just want to fish. I don't want any trouble. I may try 7-Up like was suggested above. Thanks guys!"
547897,Guest,2005-05-13 10:13:00,0,nate just to clarify the regs say alcoholic beverages not beer are not allowed so non-alcohol beer is a-ok
