Assuming you would even mount or replicate a trophy fish, what is the minimum size a Walleye and Northern Pike would have to be to justify the hassle/cost? Muskie? If I had to throw out a number I will say 31+"" for a Walleye and over 44"" for a Pike (?) (assuming they are also fatties) Not sure about the Pike, but I have an open spot on a wall for a Walleye anytime. I'm interested in others opinions."
547829,Guest,2005-05-12 06:57:00,0,"I mounted a 34"" walleye but it is up to you; the mount (replica-I released it--see the O'sullivan string) looks fantastic and as far as my ""interior design"" preferences go, any size walleye would look far better on the wall then anything else, except may a Pike mount. I would mount one 30"" or over and be very happy with it."
547830,czy42strokes,2005-05-12 07:28:00,419,I would have a replica made of a 30 inch big girth walleye. I have gotten close to the 30 inch mark but they have been post spawn. My quest will continue this fall for a 30 plus fatty.
547834,Guest,2005-05-12 08:02:00,0,"Hi I'm with Strokes on this one. I would go with a replica on my fish. For a walleye its got to be 31"", Pike would have to go 48"" and a musky would have to be 54"". Thanks Dave"
547836,Frankm,2005-05-12 08:20:00,154,"I would say 42"" or better for a Pike and 30"" or better for Walleye. Bottom line its up to you. At 42"" Pike and 30"" Walleye are tropies in my book. They would make beautiful skin or replica mounts. I have a 43"" Pike skin mount and I enjoy it every day. You just look at it and think ""Man thats a big fish!"""
