I have never flown there, but I have done Fourarm Lake before it was a VIP and last year did McConnell Lake. This year we are flying to Paul Lake the last week of July. As for Ivnahoe, they are a top notch lodge. Food is good at the lodge and if you stay overnight in one of there cabins, the place is just great. I would not hesitate to reccomend them to anyone. I know if you call a week of so before you go up, they will give you the hot baits and such for your lake. they also have maps marked for you to look at when you arrive. Tight Lines Pike man"
