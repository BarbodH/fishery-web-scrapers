I like to be in the shallow water and cast it into the deep and try slow and erratic retrives right on the bottom. The Carolina weight will depend on the water depth but 1/2 oz will do a great job up to 20' of water. I like 2' to 3' of leader behind sinker. This presentation has worked very well early in the year for bigger fish."

Large dace would suffice as well and are likely more hearty. Wait for the telltail 'tick', then open your bail for a bit and let him chew on it. Then rip the lip. Has worked for years for me. Biggest part of this is, YOU HAVE TO BE IN A LAKE THAT HAS TROPHY WALLEYE. Or, you will not catch much of anything. If they are there, the large minnowed rig will serve you in good stead. Try it."
