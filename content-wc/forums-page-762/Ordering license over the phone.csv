I noticed that it was postmarked on 4/26 so it took 13 days to get here. I kind of got nervous when the lady that took the order said ""you should get it before you leave"" when I told her we were leaving on June 10th!!!"
547728,Guest,2005-05-10 01:16:00,0,Hi. is it any cheaper than getting them in person? thanks
547739,phishfearme,2005-05-10 10:31:00,1242,no - there's a fee of about $3.75 for this service. - phish

My CC bill came to $66.28 for both of us for the full license. Be sure to tell them the dates you want the license for. She forgot to ask me and I called back right away. She said she was going to call me right back. For about $2.75 US, I say it is worth it not having to stop at a busy bait shop on a Saturday morning like we were doing in Fort Frances. T-31 days!!!!"
