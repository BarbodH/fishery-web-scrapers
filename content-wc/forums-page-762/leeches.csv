We used to bring them across, often times as far north as we go they werent available yet or were very small. we now have been getting them just across the border. I understand that the leeches you buy in canada are from suppliers in minnesota. Now I heard that canada isn't going to allow supplies to brought in from minn. We are very concerned about the availability of good leeches for the opener. Anyone have any knowledge or info on this?? thanks for any info"
547799,czy42strokes,2005-05-11 14:22:00,419,Same info I heard from my supplier in Ontario. He can no longer buy leeches from Minnesota. They have to use Canadian born and bred leeches. THis may affect the size of leeches. I have had such good luck on the minnesota jumbo leeches. Last year I started to see the quality drop as most of the leeches we bought were crappie size. We always buy 9 pounds of leeches. Hate to preorder that many if the quality isn't as good.

When I spoke to the Ontario MNR contact person (Chris Brousseau) in April 05, I was told that they expected the legislation to be passed in Jun 05 or later. Consequently, as of this date (11 May 05), I would assume leeches can still be imported into Ontario from the USA by those with bait licences."
