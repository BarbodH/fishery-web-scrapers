547824,Guest,2005-05-12 05:58:00,0,"Yes there is it is on the north arm of Dryberry, when you are travelling north of Sioux narrows you will go untill you see a sign about Kenora(has a picture of the city on it) and it is the road on the right.The road can be sometimes very rough depending on rain fall.Its only a couple miles in not very far.There is also a launch on the south side but never used it.I'll ask around to see what that one is like (even if it is public)."
547835,Guest,2005-05-12 08:09:00,0,"Hi Claude, The launch on the northwest arm is public and like Darcy said it can get real rough. The road to the launch can be a nightmare its taken us as much as a couple of hours to get in. We have given up on that plan and now stay at Dryberry falls resort the rate is $40.00 a night and you dock right on Dryberry. If you want info try this number 847-636-2677. Thanks Dave"
