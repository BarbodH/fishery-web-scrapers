547209,Guest,2005-04-22 22:01:00,0,"I just got a replica mount back from a taxidermist business called ""Artistic Anglers"" in Minnesota. They were recommended to me as the best for replica mounts. It took about 8 months but they told me that up front and the paint job is beautiful. I'm stoked to be hanging that fish on a wall. They did a fantastic job. Anyone out there heading to Lake O'Sullivan in Quebec this Spring/Summer? We are at the Lodge every year in June and it is an excellent Camp. It is strange/sad that I see my high school buddies who live right nearby in Pa. really only during that week in Canada. That's the wife and kids for ya. But we have a blast when we get there. O'Sullivan? anyone???"
547212,Guest,2005-04-23 05:22:00,0,"For the 25th year (give or take a season or two) we'll be heading to OSLL and we are counting the days (minutes). Over the years there seem to be different areas that produce better than others but we always seem to find success in Smith's Bay and Clatouche. Every so often the big sand bar on the north end produces like crazy. We once hooked over 30 in less than three feet of water just as a storm was moving in. It was sheer frenzy for about a half an hour, then the rains came. Even plain jigs with the mere scent of nightcrawler worked. Some years the walleye run big, others they are merely plentiful, and in the past half dozen years or so, it seems as though the odds of getting big pike has increased (especially in Clatouche.) In '02 I caught and released a 24lb-er and last year I had a 30lb class northern to the boat before he turned on me and sliced my 30lb test super line like it was a piece of thread. We'll pay him a visit again this year. This season we are going to seriously get into dead bait fishing for big pike. The circle hook rigs are ready and the frozen smelt are on the way. We'll be there the first week of July. What a place. It's a long haul from Minnesota, eh?"
547232,Guest,2005-04-24 12:34:00,0,"Hey T-stick: You sound as excited as our crew. We're hitting OSullivan June 10-18. Smitty's is usually a lock and we've had great action, with a south wind, behind the island all the way in the back of Smitty's. I think we are going to work that Northern shore more this year--assuming the wind says we should. I think your Pike experience mirrors our own; they've increased in size and quantity over the years. You are up later in July and according to a friend who heads up twice (with us in June and the end of July w/his wife), holes in the area right around ""The Church"" (marked hazard north of Lodge toward Sea Gull Rock) turn on in July so maybe you can hook up there. He says he uses floating rigs. OK, that's my tip for you; maybe give us a hotspot now???? Let's keep talking while we're packing and buying stuff we'll never use... I'm holding more hotspots too, my friends will kill me if I don't get some new and unique hotspot in exchange for blabbing. Have a good day Andy"
547234,Guest,2005-04-24 15:25:00,0,"Here's a spot that produced big time last season...just as you get through the cut to the north end (west of the ""Big White Rock"") behind the first big island, that little island which is all rubble beneath the surface, sure held a lot of walleye, especially in the west wind. If you jig, prepare to lose a few. We trolled all around the west/northwest areas and really kicked heinie. But, as I've stated before, we will hit Clatouche at least four days out of seven. For three years in a row we got caught in a thunderstorm on the 4th of July, coincidentally. (In '01 it merely snowed.)In '02 we were between the islands on the north end when the first lightning was spotted on the horizon. We pulled up immediately. We were about a mile and a half from camp on the big part of the lake with the extreme wind to our back, throttle opened wide. The air pressure was so intense that the waves were literally pounded down resembling a washboard. And intense it was. The storm passed us and by the time we got to camp, the sun was already beginning to break through. A small tree had been unrooted and loose gear and coolers and debris was strewn all over camp and into the water. Russell was just about to head out to search for us. I have never been so scared in my life. Our partners were waiting for us on shore with open beers and they tasted most delicious. Can't wait to get back."
547240,beagle22b07,2005-04-24 18:48:00,34,"Hey guys, good to hear some chat about lodges in Quebec. Andy, where in PA are you from? I live just nort of Pittsburgh and almost went to O'Sullivan last August but got scared of the road into the lodge. I like to take my own boat but have read horror stories about the Clova Road. Do either of you guys take your own boats? Andy, how long of a rip is it from where you live in PA? Do you make the trip non-stop or do you stay over in Maniwaki? If you stop, do you stop both going in and coming out? Have any of you fished there early August? If so, how's the bite? I've not booked a trip for this year yet and am considering O'Sullivan again. Thanks Larry"
547243,Guest,2005-04-25 02:51:00,0,"Never trailed a boat and most likely wouldn't do so because the road is bad (but manageable) and with some care you should be ok. But it's that extra care that extends the travel time into and out of camp. Also, once there, I personally would not want to take the trip up the shallow, rocky river to Clatouche in my own craft. It's do-able, but unless you're experienced, you'd better have a spare prop on hand. As for early August...been there many years ago and did pretty well. The presentation's a bit deeper but the walleye bite on this lake is about as consistent as you could expect. Good luck."
547268,Guest,2005-04-25 13:04:00,0,"thundrstick, do you folks hit clatouche for the eyes or pike? i know the pike are pleantiful up there, but never had to much success (or effort for)w/the walleye. if you know differently, pls inform andy and i!! thx!! bruce also, the sand bar in the northern basin; is that the one along the western side, immediately south and west of the north shore shore lunch location?"
547278,Guest,2005-04-25 16:16:00,0,"I will be heading to O'Sullivan for the first time in late June. I have looked at Clatouche on a map and it sure looks appealing, but how rocky/narrow is the opening to the lake? Also, I am certainly intrested in big pike, but is the trek to Clatouche worth the trip from the lodge? Last, what size motors does Stan supply? The website says 9.9. I was hoping for something a bit larger (i.e. 20hp)"
547609,Guest,2005-05-05 16:45:00,0,"If you catch any of the ones we've already released, better have a camera handy. Now...how about a tip in return?"
547611,Guest,2005-05-05 17:05:00,0,"T-Stick: Bruce is merely my bowman and as such, cannot navigate, so I'm the tip man. That Candy Lake drainage was a good one so here's one we always like: Usually with a north wind, at the southern end, below Ray's Bay, but before it narrows for the last two hundred yards or so to the outflow, is a point that juts out; to the left of which is a shallow sandy area. In front of the point maybe within 15 feet of shore is a hole we call ""the bathtub"" for it's size. Good walleye. How 'bout another and this time--make it hurt....Thanks! Andy"
547649,Guest,2005-05-06 13:19:00,0,"t-stick, ""captain andy"" is pretty high on himself but in fact when asked to troll a 10 foot contour you find the boat going in figure 8's......he also stares at the fish finder like a kid at a cartoon and thinks he can get back to a good place after never looking up to see where he is on the lake. we'll try and go back to a good place and he will be sure its in ""this cove"" when in fact the ""right"" cove is another 2 miles down the lake. i tell him the depth finder doesn't have GPS nor does his brain, but he never takes a look around for landmarks to see where he's been and where the ""good spot"" was. you can imagine the frustration in spending a week in the bow of that boat. but of course it is actually a blast and we cannot wait to do it every year!! now a tip, although i'm sure your aware of this one. almost every night our last stop is the entrance to piker bay. heading in drag a bottom bouncer w/floating jig head as slow as possible and within 4 feet of the right bank. pretty #### sure bet to catch and keepers as well!! any more tips from the 25 year vet?"
547654,Guest,2005-05-06 15:50:00,0,"Last stop of the night: A couple of quick passes between the water right in fron of Cabin 10, continuing along the shore (there's a neat little sand bar there) to the corner, turn left to the opening of Pike Bay and return for another couple of passes. One year that was, simply put, THE spot. I mean: THEEEEEE spot. Also, that little island just across from the lodge always deserves some time, especially the back side and the corners."
547806,beagle22b07,2005-05-11 18:05:00,34,"Bruce I feel your pain. Not many captains appreciate a good ""boat bitxh"". We're the ones who load the boat, warm up the motor in the morning and pass the captain ""cold ones"" when he needs one. My captain is a long time friend from high school. 35 years ago he couldn't smoke and drive at the same time. When we first went to Canada 7 years ago, I was very suprised to see him smoke, drink a beer, steer the boat, watch the fish finder and fish all at the same time. He got tired of me bustin' his stones so I got to drive. Within 10 minutes I had the boat up on a shoal with the prop bangin' against the rocks. That was it for me, now all I'm allowed to do is sit in the bow and pass the beer. Hope your trip is good this year. I'm corresponding with Stan now about a trip in mid-August. Larry"
547814,Guest,2005-05-11 20:03:00,0,"Larry: I do appreciate my Boat Bitxh Bruce (say that thrre times fast with 10 LaBatts in you); he's just high maintenance sometimes, but he does pass the beer efficiently AND he operates the trolling motor allowing me to shut off the noisemaker and stop smelling fumes. He does that quite well. So Larry, there are many good O'Sullivan tips in this string (see the ""Church"" tip above--good for later in the Summer) What can you give us? Tell us the best story and be as specific as possible, maybe Bruce will let me give up another tip if the lead is good. I cannot wait to be there. Andy"
547309,bronzeback77,2005-04-26 11:22:00,97,"Do you have any contact information on Artistic Anglers? I have some Smallmouth pictures and measurments that I would like to get made into a replica. Thank you, Dave"
547318,Guest,2005-04-26 12:20:00,0,"Thanks for the info. Other than Clatouche, can you give me another tips on prime pike locations and preferred pike lures for O'Sullivan?"
547333,Guest,2005-04-26 17:22:00,0,"'Cuse...use your favorite stuff...only bigger. Actually, Husky Jerks are great for trolling and casting. Spoons are a natural, as well. Gawdy junk from the bargain bins always gets 'em. One guy in our group kinda designs lures as he goes. He might attach a crankbait to an in-line spinner and dress the mess with a curlytail piece of rubber. He gets big fish, too. The places to fish pike in late June? I'd start casting weeds and wood then move out and make sure to give anything that has rocks piled nearby a good working over. Humps, points, small islands, etc. After a good westerly blow try sneaking in behind Candy Island. Approach carefully. You'll only be in about 2-3 ft. Pitch some weedless way (and I mean WAY)into the mouth of the inlet and all around. At some point they'll be in there and it'll be ""happy time."" The shoreline as you proceed south is full of rocks (monstrous boulders, actually). You can troll and cast it if you're careful and there's always big pike around there. Occasionally you'll really sock the walleyes trolling out toward the center of the lake along the island. If you hit Clatouche here's a bit of advice: WATCH YOUR DEPTHFIDER (or Clatouche will be hitting YOU) Unlike the lakes in NYS, shoreline has practically no relevence in terms of depth but after a couple of passes you'll have it figured out. And THAT'S what makes it such a great pike environment. They could be anywhere. We'll be driving in on Sat., July 2. Leave a few, will ya? And make sure they're cold."
547409,Guest,2005-04-28 14:41:00,0,"Thanks T-Stick. Tell me a little bit about the deadbait options. You mentioned that you were ordering smelt to use. Have you tried this before or heard that it was successful? Also, any thoughts on using large dead sardines?"
547422,Guest,2005-04-28 20:01:00,0,"Below is the address for Artistic Anglers. The guy who runs it is Mike Vernatich (I think that's how he spells it) and you can google AA and get the phone number. They don't have a web site (artists, I guess) but they'll answer if you call in the day time. They want pics and a check for 50 bucks up front and the balance when it's ready. Then they ship UPS or Post office. Mine was great and flawless--traveled well too. Good luck! The Lodge at O'Sullivan has frozen smelt and the pike nail them. Thanks for all the fish talk. you can check ou the lodge at the web site www.osullivanlake.ca Russell runs the Lodge and Stan, his son, is down in the nearest big town, Maniwaki and handles reservations and so forth. Good guys you can trust to make your trip a blast. Let me know if you need more info. Andy Artistic Anglers 5289 Rice Lake Road Duluth, MN 55803"
547443,Guest,2005-04-29 12:38:00,0,"Having been reared on live bait fishing for northern, it's a natural segue into dead bait fishing. It's basically the same with a few notable exceptions. Besides the obvious, a circle hook (#2, #3 Gamakatsu Octopus Circle)is used to encourage lip hookups, and safe release of your catch (unless, of course, he's worthy of hanging on a wall.) Heavy line/leader, floats or on the bottom. Frozen smelt are available at the lodge. We are scouting around for frozen smelt to bring with us, however."
547571,Guest,2005-05-04 12:21:00,0,"thunderstick, can you clue me in to where candy island and the mouth/inlet is? we are getting super excited at this point for our 6/11 arrival!! can't wait. thx for any input! bruce"
547578,Guest,2005-05-04 12:21:00,0,"thunderstick, can you clue me in to where candy island and the mouth/inlet is? we are getting super excited at this point for our 6/11 arrival!! can't wait. thx for any input! bruce"
547585,Guest,2005-05-04 18:58:00,0,"As you head south from camp, instead of heading left to Smith's, head right, toward the narrows. You'll see a lone island on the right, about two miles away. Opposite that island, on the left, is another island, tight to the southern shore. Behind it is a feeder. The area is shallow and can get very weedy as the season goes on but in mid-June you'll see the weeds at the mouth of the feeder. It empties the water from Candy Lake, which should appear on your map. When there's a day or two of steady wind from the west, big northern gather at the mouth and at times it can be unreal. After a few dozen casts, you'll know if they are in there. If they are stacked, as they sometimes are, it's not uncommon to nail five or six in the 8-10 lb range. I prefer weedless spoons, surface baits or buzz baits. Before leaving, however, tie on a stick bait and troll right out toward the lake. That point extends well beyond the shore and the walleye stack up there pretty good. That same technique works well in all those southeastern bays that face a west wind. Of course, once past the narrows, Raymond's Bay can really hold them. And don't pass up the opportunity to toss some spoons way in the back where it gets shallow. In a stiff wind pike and walleye can be in water so shallow, you can't believe that their dorsals aren't sticking out ouf the water. Also, you'll notice just before the narrows, boulders scattered along the southeast shore. You can navigate it with care. Big pike. Don't forget to save a few."
547604,Guest,2005-05-05 13:25:00,0,"t-stick, thx for the tips!! these are new places for us and we'll look forward to checking them out! we always release pike so they will all be their upon your arrival. thx again. bruce"
547282,Guest,2005-04-25 19:44:00,0,"Beagle and Syracuse: I live in Philly suburbs and it takes about 9 hours to maniwaki. Sometimes we stay over but the last twqo years we've just blitzed through and up the Clova to camp; when we stay in Maniwaki there is the Algonquin Motel and north of it nearewr the Clova is some hotel in Gran Remous; callled 105 or something. On the way out we have gone straight through or stayed over in NY state. The road is a #### and it's 77 miles but once you are there AND IF YOU TUGGED YOUR BOAT you are in heaven. The road is doable but you need to pay attention to the Trailer. I broke a spring two years ago 24 miles from camp at night--Russell to the rescue. He fixed the trailer that week as we fished. But beef things up a bit and an average of 30 miles per hour is realistic. I'd make sure my first time was in daylight til you get used to it. Old French salts hit the Clova with full size Lunds with 225 hp and do 40 mph all the way but they have spare springs and rig with shocks on the trailer. I pull a 14.5' Lowe with a 25 hp and we feel like we own the lake with that. This year our buddy is bringing his Skeeter with a 115 Hp june 11-18. Hope that answers some stuff; it is a great lodge and an awesome lake with so many great spots and every year we discover a few more. Thanks for the tip Thunderstick, we hit that back side of the island too and it is hot and many jigs are lost. Syracuse: we hit Clatouche once every year and it seems Thunderstick has great luck. e have done pretty well on Pike but never reallt fished it for eyes--maybe Thunderstick will give us a tip that changes that...we go up the river in my boat with a hitch--even in low water but if you'll freak about scrapes on your boat well... The lodge has a few new 15 HP but most are all new 9.9s. If you like the rental boats can handle 25 so if you have one, wrap it up (dust on the road) and haul it in. Just an idea. The place is great but not so sure about August bite; I have a friend that heads up that time every year and does really well, see the tip about the Church above--take your sun block and pray for rain. Andy"
547292,Guest,2005-04-26 02:45:00,0,"Yes...that's the ""Sand Bar"" and depending on the weather and wind, it can be productive. We always give it a try. Troll...jig...cast. Big pike and walleye cruise for prey and under low light or windy conditions, the walleye schools move in or sometimes hang at the drop (which is quite a distance from shore. You'll feel like you're fishing in the middle of the lake.) As for Clatouche, between the islands to the right is a good place to troll or jig for walleye. Also, for smaller walleye in big numbers, push through to Beaver Lake. Many times it's dammed. It's saved many slow days. As for pike...there are so many good spots, it defies description. If I were to design a lake specifically for pike, it would end up looking something like Clatouche. Try the humps, the weeds, the wood, the islands...cast, troll, dead bait...cover water...they are everywhere and big ones definitely prowl. The trip up the river can always be tricky but caution will get you there. These days, if the water's up, we usually make the trip without so much as touching a rock. But I still wouldn't do it in my own rig. Good luck."
