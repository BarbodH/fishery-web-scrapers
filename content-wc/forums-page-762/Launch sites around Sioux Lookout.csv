Can you please list any launch sites you are aware of in the Hudson/Sioux Lookout area? My crew has small boats with 25 HP, so we'll pull them to good areas if there are launch sites. Thanks!"
547759,IaDave,2005-05-10 15:43:00,476,Wooglin- By your posts I see you fish Lac Suel. Don't overlook Minnitaki for something different. Right before you turn to go to Hudson there is a public launch to your right. Just look for the sign. That will put you into Abrams Lake and then you can get to Minnitaki from there. The Deception Bay launch that was mentioned in another thread is NE of Sioux Lookout. Take the road to Sioux Lookout and turn right where it says to Pickle Lake. It is up that highway about 5 miles(just guessing).
547763,wooglin,2005-05-10 16:25:00,371,"I always though we fished Lac Seul, but I think its Lost Lake...anyway, we use the launch that is right before Hudson on the right hand side. We have thought about Minnitaki, just didn't know if it was all that close or not. We want to hit walleye hard in the morning and then hit muskie in the afternoon on Big Vermillion. So, how far would you say Sioux Lookout is from Minnitaki? Also, are you saying there is a Lac Seul launch in the Sioux Lookout area, other than the one on the right hand side towards Hudson? Thanks again!"
547775,IaDave,2005-05-11 06:49:00,476,Wooglin- Right before you turn at the gas station to go to Hudson there is a landing on the right hand side that gives you acess to Minnitaki. Instead of turning left to go to Hudson stay on the highway to Sioux Lookout(about 3 miles). When you get to Sioux Lookout there is a highway that goes to Pickle Lake- you will see the sign. Take that out of Sioux Lookout about 5 miles and there is a boat launch that will give you access to Lac Suel.
547776,wooglin,2005-05-11 06:54:00,371,"Right on, I know exactly where you are talking - thanks again for the insite. Are both good for walleye and northern? Do you recommend them over the Lost Lake area? I'd guess anywhere up there is a horse a piece, but just curious... Thanks!"
