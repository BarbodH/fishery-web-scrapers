547852,Guest,2005-05-12 15:32:00,0,I have been taking my boat into Ontario each year for the past 7 years to go fishing at Mitchell's Bay on Lake St. Clair. Someone at work told me this week that the Canadian Customs will turn you back and not let you in if you do not have some new license that they now require. Does anyone know what license they are talking about? Any info on this would be greatly appreciated. Bub
