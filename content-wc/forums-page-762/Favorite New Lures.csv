547779,Guest,2005-05-11 08:02:00,0,We are trying the Rapala Glass Shad Rap this year. We have always had good luck with the regular Shad Rap and are looking forward to trying the Glass Models.
547781,Mr Ranger,2005-05-11 08:09:00,272,How about the Blade Dancer. Good action but have not had a chance to try them much. Great action from what I could see. Thanks
547794,Guest,2005-05-11 12:14:00,0,"I too am curios about the blade dancer ( for Pike and bass fishing). Although it looks to be nothing more than a glorified version of the silver minnow tipped with a twister. Remember, Most lures are made to catch fisherman not fish!"
547798,czy42strokes,2005-05-11 14:19:00,419,Going to try the rock runner and floating leech rig. I know some big females are hanging around the rock piles. I would like to make a few passes without getting hung up in the rocks for a change.
547801,Guest,2005-05-11 16:03:00,0,Doctor Spoons just came out with a weedless spoon that is similar to a Johnson's Silver Minnow. Looks great. Can't wait to throw that threw the weeds for pike. The second item is lures made of beer bottle tops. Here is the site.http://www.bottlecaplure.com/home.html
