547879,Guest,2005-05-13 06:05:00,0,We usually cross at International Falls before noon on Friday and have no problem. We usually arrive there between 10:30 and 11:30.

What they said was to get a notarized letter (as jigman suggested) from the other parent, and the more detail it contains about such things as dates, destinations, etc., the better, i.e., ""johnny has my permission to enter Canada with (name) on (date) and travel to and stay at Bigfish Lodge on Whopper Lake from (date) to (date)"", etc. Maybe all that detail is overkill but that is what they suggested to us. Good luck to you. I wish my dad would have taken me to Canada fishing when I was a kid. But now I'm taking him to Canada fishing while he's retired!"
