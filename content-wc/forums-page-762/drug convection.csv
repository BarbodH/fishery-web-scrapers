547795,Guest,2005-05-11 12:24:00,0,"I agree, yet the kid was/is 18 and will be tried as an adult. When I turned 18 I was on my way to basic training, USAF, so mom and dad had little to say about where I went on vacation from then on. I do like your idea that he not be in the same car as you cause if he get held up you are free to go."
547817,Guest,2005-05-11 21:27:00,0,"The way the idiot politicians are running this country it will soon be legal to smoke and possess pot, and illegal to smoke and possess cigarettes. I am a Canadian. What more can you expect when you have a bunch of Frenchmen in Gov't??????????????"
547524,Guest,2005-05-02 19:48:00,0,"Your nephew's situation might not be that bad. I am from Pa. but assuming that 18 is the age of majority in Illinois, the charge against your nephew is probably a juvenile offense and as such, his record may be sealed. This is stuff I recall from the days I practiced criminal law, but I'm NOT an Illinois lawyer and LOOK AT THE ACTUAL CHARGESS TO BE SURE HE IS BEING STRAIGHT WITH YOU ON ""SIMPLE POSSESSION"" AND THAT IS'S NOT SOMETHING MORE PROBLEMATIC LIKE A FELONY. AND REMEMBER IT IS NOT WHAT ILLINOIS WOULD REGARD THE CHARGE AS BUT WHAT CANADA WOULD CALL IT. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE US A DUI OR DWI IS TYPICALLY A MISDEMEANOR, BUT DUI/DWI IS A FELONY IN CANADA If he is ""charged"" but not yet ""convicted"" that's a big difference. A charge is an accusation, nothing more. But, ah yes, Canada is a funny about stuff like that. Go to the always present string of replies to the DUI posts on here that pop up every year like Tulips then click on the URL in one of those replies that includes the information from the Canadien Immigrations on filing a petition for ""Rehabilitation"". If the charge alone (not a conviction) creates a problem then have the boy fill out the form and follow the directions AND pay 200 Canadien (use a Visa or Amex and you'll get the best exchange rate from your card company) and see what happens. This is a manageable problem but figure it out before you go!!!"
547586,Guest,2005-05-04 19:11:00,0,"I've been asked on both sides of tbe border every so often if I have ever been ARRESTED. Make sure he can get home if he's turned away or leave him at home and tell him in about 10 years if he keeps his nose clean, a simple possession charge will be insignificant."
547588,bigfish1965,2005-05-04 20:18:00,3210,"I know it sounds odd, but here a DWI is considered far more serious than a simple pot possession charge. I doubt anyone other than growers or large scale dealers have been charged for having pot for years in Canada."
547599,Guest,2005-05-05 10:37:00,0,Lots of the boys carry pot when they're packing it in. If you're portaging a bag of pot is a lot lighter to carry.
547660,bubba800,2005-05-06 20:03:00,559,Has the world gone crazy or is it just me. The kid gets ticketed and he's going to be allowed to go to Canada? Seems like a good time to learn about choices and consequences to me. My brother-in-laws group sat at the Border for 9 hours waiting for immigration a few years back because one had a DUI when he was younger. If it were me he either drives separate or stays home and decides if he wants to fish or get high.

547695,Guest,2005-05-09 07:41:00,0,"Come on, get with the times. You don't really think his parents should punish him by not letting him go fishing? All he did was break the law."
547700,jigman 2003,2005-05-09 10:31:00,981,"Gotta agree with you Bubba. Not to say that I never did anything ""stupid"", but had I got caught doing those stupid things my parents would never have allowed me to go on a trip somewhere really nice."
547709,Guest,2005-05-09 12:33:00,0,Would not be allowed if he were my Son. Got no time for drugs and abusers. Has he been to treatment? If not NO CANADA.
547787,bubba800,2005-05-11 09:07:00,559,"I sometimes think I might be the only one that sees it that way. Anytime I committed a bad thing whether by choice or stupidity I answered to Dads belt, or when I was older I just got worked until I almost dropped. Whether its the right way or wrong way of teaching, I learned what not to do. I don't use the belt but my child knows what grounding, work and loss of all privilages is."
547488,Guest,2005-05-02 08:06:00,0,"There has been alot of threads on crossing the border with a dUI, but haven't seen any about drugs. I have a 17 year old nephew that was arrested for possesion of pot,would he be allowed into canada?"
547489,Guest,2005-05-02 08:19:00,0,arrested or convicted? If convicted I doubt he'll get in if they check
547492,Guest,2005-05-02 09:03:00,0,"Did he get charged on a village ordinance, or was he arrested on a state charge? If it was a VO, he is probably OK, but if it was a state charge, he could have a problem. One way you can check is by looking up his name on a Website like Rapsheets.com It will cost you about $15 to run the check. It is not as good as I would be able to run, but Rapsheets does check county databases throughout the country and if you find his arrest on Rapsheets, it will probably be in whatever database that Canada has access to."
547494,jigman 2003,2005-05-02 10:18:00,981,"I don't know the answer to your question, but I do know that I personally would not risk my trip for someone with a charge like that. Make sure he has a way to get back home if you have to dump him at the border."
547500,Guest,2005-05-02 11:44:00,0,He has been charged by the state but his court date has not come up yet.
547501,Guest,2005-05-02 11:57:00,0,my GUESS is that if you go prior to a conviction he will not have a problem.
547504,Guest,2005-05-02 13:22:00,0,Make sure there are no drugs going with him across the border. You all might be trading your trip for some Canada jail time if they have the sniffer dogs out.
547507,Guest,2005-05-02 13:39:00,0,"The best suggestion, depending on where you are coming from, is to have some way for him to get back home if he can't cross. If you are travelling a long way perhaps it is not worth it. Never take stuff across the border. If in need, there is plenty of places to find 'green' on the north side of the border. Just stop and ask the first twenty year old-looking person you see!! ha, ha"
547513,Guest,2005-05-02 15:01:00,0,"A native guide once offered us weed once before he was guiding three boats of cops. He was nervous when he figured out from the conversations what we did. If you get arrested in Illinois, it will show immediately on your criminal history when and why you were arrested. If you were arrested in Indiana, it does not show up on your criminal history until it is through court. It depends where he got arrested. The best thing to do is call ahead of time to the Canadian Consulate in Detroit and ask them if there will be a problem. It is better knowing in advance than taking a chance."
547514,jerry bark,2005-05-02 15:25:00,822,"is it possible that it is illegal to leave the country before his trial?? this could get ugly if so, i would suggest he stay home. good luck jerry"
