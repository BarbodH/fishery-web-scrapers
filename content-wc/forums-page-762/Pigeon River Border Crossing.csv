547876,Guest,2005-05-13 05:43:00,0,What if any are the logistical considerations crossing at Pigeon River? Our current itinerary would have us crossing mid-to-late afternoon on a Friday. Should we reschedule for any reason? Is traffic generally a problem at this day/time?

I will go up through there this year as well as return. The lines are short and the passing goes quickly. The only bad part is missing Saturday Breakfast at Knobbies !!!!!!!!!!

Just make sure you don't have potatoes or your own crawlers. We had crawlers packed in Buss Bedding once, and they made us walk back across the border and dump them (500 of them!) because there were small specks of dirt on top of the bedding left from when the crawlers burrowed in to the bedding. We also had to leave our potatoes. Pigeon River is a great place to cross."
