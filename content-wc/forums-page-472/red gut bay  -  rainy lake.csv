You can buy bait/beer, almost anything you'll need, but stop in Ft. Frances for leaches-Neil doesn't carry any. Good people around, fishin can be smokin hot or dead as dirt in June. Good Luck, Rob"

1336138,Guest,2011-08-01 10:51:00,0,"The Landing is a great place, The owners Deb and Neil anre both very nice people. We stay there every year. There are shower houses and public restrooms out near the rv campground. Also they have a pretty good fish cleaning house. The lodge sells liquor and beer and has much useful info about the area. There is great muskie and walleye fishing all around the area. Smith island for walleyes, and the grassy narrows, cliffs narrows, or portage bay for muskies and pike. any more info e-mail me @ [email protected]"

510829,Guest,2001-01-31 06:43:00,0,"I don't know anything about the resort, but have fished Red Gut Bay on and off for the last 13-14 years. In the spring, its jig and minnows time. Take PLENTY of jigs. Rainy is very rocky and if you aren't losing jigs often, you are not getting into the rocks where the fish are. As for location, fish will be in classic post-spawn haunts along shorelines with access to early weed cover, or down timber, or round rocks. One of the classic places to fish spring walleyes on Red Gut Bay is Moose Island. It's on the map. Also north and west of Moose Island are two or three other islands (I think Blueberry is one of them)which also frequently hold fish. Depending on weather, water temperature and cloud cover, the fish may be in as little as 2-3 feet of water, hugging the shore. Fish the windy side of the island and throw your jigs up tight. Go light! Also, if I had to choose one color on Rainy, I would choose chartreuseIf looking for a few gators, look on your map slightly north and east of Moose Island. There is a shallow weedy bay which always produces (we have nicknamed it Houseboat Bay because it is very protected). Spoons and big spinners baits seem to be the preference. I have also caught pike consistently on perch colored Countdown Rapalas trolled along steep rock walls. For instance, go through Bear's Pass Narrows and under the high bridge into Swell Bay, turn right and follow the wall as close as possible until you get to the first cabin. Don't go past there--huge rocks, very shallow--will definitely take out your lower unit! Be cautious!!If any other questions feel free to e-mail me.Good luck,and post your report when you get back.Bill"
510830,Guest,2001-02-02 14:15:00,0,"In my opinion Red Gut is better for walleyes in the summer than early June. However, there are plenty to be had for the savvy fisherman. I agree with ND89 that jigs and minnows are effective. Some of my favroite early June spots - all are listed on the maps: Red pine narrows, Entrance to Porter's Inlet (this area is restricted no fishing past this point until I think June 15th. Crooked Narrows, Peary Straights, Spawn Bay Inlet. Pull some 8 to 9 inch white or yellow Rapalas around the bays downstream from these spots for nice 20 to 25 inch W's. . The Landing is a nice place and very centrally located to these spots. If you want to take a nice 20 mile boat ride for a days fishing go to Grassy Narrows on Seine Bay. Fish the narrows and the big bay to the right. If you want to make a 25 miles run you can go to Comorant Bay on the other side of the Scott Islands in South Bay Remember US citizens get 1 fish per day. Smallmouth fishing is excellent this time of the year. They are in any rock pile or on island points. Small cranks will get the Smallies without much effort. If it's a sunny day, go for the Smallies until the evening hours then go for the W's. TGG"
510831,Guest,2001-02-02 19:46:00,0,i thought if you held a 7 day conversion lic the the daily bag was 3 .is ther a slot on rainy also ?
510832,Guest,2001-02-02 22:30:00,0,"The one fish per day is for US citizens even if you are staying at a resort in Ontario. This applies only to the Canadian side of Rainy. There is also a slot of fish under 13 inches and over 17 1/2 inches must be released. I not sure so check the regs, but the trophy is only one over 27 inches. The conservation lic. allows you 2 W's in possesion."
510833,Guest,2001-02-03 21:04:00,0,I have stayed at that resort for the past 10 years. Neil the owner is great. The fishing is pretty good. Some of the best walleye fishing is just out from the resort by the bouy marker near the narrows. I haven't had much luck in that area for northern. Good place to stay and the fishing should be pretty good that time of the year. I usually head up to Black Sturgeon Bay and fish for smallies and northern. Spawn Inlet for crappies. Good luck!
1213842,Guest,2010-06-27 08:51:00,0,"I'm going to be @ our family cabin north of the landing through perry straight for almost 2 weeks starting 8 july. Have fished a spot west of our cabin called jungle jim's in higher water years, but hear water is low this year. Had a spot north of the cabin that was good year before last. Another good spot further north. Usually try mouth of trout river & cliff narrows also. Have had good luck @ sand island falls turtle river."
