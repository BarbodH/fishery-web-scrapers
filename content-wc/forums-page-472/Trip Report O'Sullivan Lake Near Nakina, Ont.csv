1335210,Bill Krejca,2011-07-29 07:21:00,6107,"3"" and 4"" minnows, super glued to the jig head, smelt pattern, verticle jigging with some casting/ jigging. I'm surprised no one commented on the 7"" bait! We used no live bait, never even took any. Hi Larry Mac! Bill Krejca"
1335218,Mr Ranger,2011-07-29 07:37:00,272,"Hey Minnow, at first I thought you were showing me my dirty truck tire then lookded again and saw the bears butt. Good shot. Was that the up the tree night?"
1335220,Mr Ranger,2011-07-29 07:42:00,272,"Bill the 7"" does not surprise me at all. We have trolled Musky cranks for large Northern and almost always are getting walleye on them. They simply like big bait and seem to be even more aggressive with them. Like the shirt slogan says ""Go Big or Go Home"" Besides I think you could catch walleye in my bath tub. Great job."
1335281,Larry Mac,2011-07-29 09:55:00,530,"Hi Bill, those were some mighty fine walleye!!!! Great to hear from youThank you,Larry Mac"
1335425,Jaskonie,2011-07-29 15:18:00,80,"Great pics and nice trip report. We troll large stick baits 6 to 8 inches long so 7"" gulp is in the norm for walleye. A kid on our trip to Horwood lake this year caught a 24 incher that had a 10"" ling in its gut. The Aholes on in fisherman are always touting the big swim baits for walleye also."
1335698,DavKin,2011-07-30 19:18:00,104,"Hi Bill, First of all I enjoyed your book. We fished out of Red Deer Lodge for twenty years before we started going to Red Lake. How did you rig the Gulp jerk shad and what size weighted hook? Thanks, Dave"
1335734,mbay1455,2011-07-30 22:05:00,25,"Bill et al,Still on the way home from O'Sullivan to Texas, spending the night in Emporia, KS. I'll post pictures once I get home but Shelley has already posted our best on the O'Sullivan facebook page. I got a 27"" and a couple 25's but the numbers were way down from previous years. Our first timer on the trip landed the biggest fish O'Sullivan has seen this year so far...a 32 1/8 inch 11 lber. What a fish. All I could say when we got it in the boat was it was the biggest walleye I had ever seen. More later.O'Sullivan and Bob/Shelley are the greatest.Tight lines all...Curt"
1335757,Bill Krejca,2011-07-31 06:39:00,6107,"Hi Dave, thanks for the kind words re: my book. Usually I used a 5/16 oz worm jig head with double barbs, and super glue. The jig heads (which I pour myself) are molded around a 4/0 or 3/0 Matzuo (sp?) very sharp sickle hook. I like the larger hook size when I use Gulp, as the Gulp doesn't compress as much as live bait, et al, and feel I get more hookups. I probably would have taken a few more fish with the large bait had I used a stinger hook farther back, though. Bill"
1336303,515,2011-08-01 18:39:00,254,Thanks for the fine fishing report and pics. I always enjoy the stories from the area as I fish close by. Mike
1334174,Bill Krejca,2011-07-26 14:21:00,6107,"Returned from stay last week at O'Sullivan's Rainbow. I'd have to say it was an unusual, atypical trip, at least weather/climate-wise. Sunday had air temp of 94 degrees, little wind. Fishing was good, but definitely spotty with a number of walleyes in the 19 -mid 20's. Had a 2 hr storm in the evening, actually 3 different storms with mega hail, rain, and an absolutely tremendous amount of lightning and thunder, and wind. Woke up Monday to a heavy fog layer that somewhat limited lake travel. Heat and no wind persisted, not large congregations of fish - pick up one or two, and move to the next spot. The remainder of the week, we were inundated with smoke from the many forest fires in the province. (reminded me of a smoke filled 1980 camping trip at LOW, which combined with the aftermath of the Mt. St Helens eruption, but that's another story). The smoke was almost constantly visible, the heat continuing, and very little wind to guide us on where to fish. The sun, particularly towards sundown/sunrise, was a rather picturesque bright red or orange ball, great for capturing as unusual pictures. Fishing in the evening, I think we lost up to an hour of actual light, as the lighting effects of the sun were visibly shortened. Almost felt like we had spent 3-4 days in a casino. Found out that large numbers of people in the province had been evacuated, by flying them out, from a number of potential fire risk areas. Thursday returned to a more typical weather pattern, with clear blue sky's and strong enough winds to assure our best fishing day. Friday produced very strong winds and we limited our fishing to the many islands near camp. Again fishing in the wind produced the best results. As in the past, jigs and Gulp minnows worked best, and that was primarily what all 6 of us used all week, no live bait at all. Fish were taken mostly between 8 - 22 feet of water. The surface water temperature was 70-75 degrees. Largest walleye was 27"", followed by a 26, and many others between 24 and 20"". One evening, we first caught a 23, followed by a 24 1/2, followed by a 25 1/2, all taken within 3 minutes. The interesting thing about this was that my son caught the 25 1/2 incher, returned it, and a half minute later, I picked up my stationary rod to resume fisning, and the same fish, still in a biting mode, was on the other end! This was definitely, as far as I know, a new experience for me/us! One evening, as an experiment, I attached to my jig a giant 7 inch Gulp Jerk Shad, anchovy pattern, actually a salt water bait. I immediately took a number of fish on it, 23"" being the largest, the smallest was a 16 incher. The smallest fish took the entire bait into its mouth. Gives some indication of the size of bait those eyes will take. Perhaps this could start a new trend, remember, you read it here first! Several lake trout fishermen from another cabin returned with 2 fish and, after cleaning them, realized that one of the fish, a 20 incher, looked different that the usual lake trout. Someone identified it as a brook trout, actually a real trophy for that species. Bob, the owner of O'Sullivan's Rainbow, said that a number of them are taken in the fall in the lake - they follow various streams in to the lake when water temp's are right, and then just stay in the lake. Helped out some fellow fishermen from Ill. with several gallons of gas out on the lake when they thought they had run out. After they still couldn't get started, I suggested maybe the kill switch had been pulled. Sure enough, it had, gas was not the issue, and the motor was back in action! Found a grateful thank-you note in our cabin from them and a piece of paper with a picture of Pres Jackson on it. Thanks, guys, just a thank you and a pay-it-forward would have been enough! One of our party attempted landing a small pike, and it flipped the jig out of its mouth. We now call our friend ""Gypsy Jack"" as the hook landed right in his ear lobe, luckily not quite barb deep. After taking the absolutely mandatory pictures, we easily removed the jig. As I said, this was an unusual trip, in so many ways. I guess that's what makes the memories. Bill Krejca"
1334186,Mike Borger,2011-07-26 14:33:00,1554,"Sounds like a success Bill. We were just north of you on Abamasagi the same week and had a very similar experience it seems.The hail that hit our cabin Sat evening was unlike anything I've ever seen before, and I'm a weather guy. Sustained marble to golf ball sized chunks for a good 15 minutes.Was very glad we weren't out in the boat when it hit."
