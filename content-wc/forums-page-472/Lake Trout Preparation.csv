You can deep fry the lean they are great that way, have had them just about any way you can cook fish. BOB"
1335233,Mohleye,2011-07-29 08:04:00,368,"I prepare and cook mine very much like Jay, except on the grill."
1335443,NMG,2011-07-29 16:05:00,1053,"Lake Trout are great just about any way you can cook fish. My favourite would also be deep fried in a crispy batter and seasoned. The one thing I would say is make sure you remove the strip of belly fat that can be found on larger fish. If you leave this on and cook them whole (not really an issue if you fillet them), it can make the fish REALLY oily and virtually unbearable to eat. Remove that fat and you have one of the best tasting freshwater fish IMHO"
1335457,Blackmacs,2011-07-29 17:00:00,2121,I've found them more filling than other fish. They are very rich imo and very good.
1335552,Blue Lk,2011-07-30 07:17:00,269,"I have had lake trout served to me in every imageable way there is to cook them.Imho the best way to prepare them is boil them with a large rock,when the rock is cooked,eat it & throw the trout in the garbage.I just don't like trout.Give me my walleye anyday."
1335570,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-30 08:25:00,1460,I'm stuck in Colorado with all these trout-eaters. They don't know what walleye is. I too stand with Blue LK.
1335844,hoosiercanadian,2011-07-31 12:31:00,104,"A friend of mine who lives in Lynn Lake Manitoba gave me some smoked lake trout that had been caught out of Reindeer Lake , it was awesome ! I also like it grilled skin side down with butter and cajan seasonings."
1335904,micropterus,2011-07-31 16:00:00,450,"I have lost the specific instructions but I do remember that after a long process with a ceder plank over an open fire, you scraped the trout off into the fire and ate the plank."
1334776,new hips,2011-07-28 07:21:00,498,"Need some help this year, we will be fishing some lake trout this year, do they filet like a walleye ? Any special bones ? Also what would be a good recipe for eating them ?"
1334790,wallydave,2011-07-28 07:38:00,2151,"I have only fished on one lake trout lake, so I am no expert, but they clean easily, much like a walleye. My personal favorite lake trout recipe is an easy one. Take your fillets, cook them on a hot dry iron skillet with black pepper and or cajin blackening spices until flaky. Blackened laker! Pair with a cold Kokanee, Blue or your beverage of choice, of course taters and beans on the side!"
1334822,Bill Krejca,2011-07-28 08:24:00,6107,"Re: fillet - yeah, just like a walleye. Another way is to steak them, but the fillet works best for me. I just like to sprinkle opp skin side with a Hy-Vee commercially prepared mix containing paprika, salt, pepper, and sugar, and maybe other ingredients that may be in it. I spray both sides of the fillet, skin left on for helping keep it together, and place on a lightly Pam spayed aluminum foil, skin side down. Cook on grill until it flakes with a fork, or a little sooner. Very good this way! Bill Krejca"
1334896,vteye,2011-07-28 11:26:00,812,Hey Bill - Laker is good eating but make sure you bleed your fish as soon as you decide to keep.
1334984,JayM5209,2011-07-28 14:09:00,1050,"A very simple, but tasty way to do your laker is to just gut it and take the head off. Lay it on a piece of foil large enough to wrap the whole thing. Salt and pepper inside and out, pats of butter and lemon slices and onion slices on top. Close foil around the fish and bake about 35-40 minutes in a 375 degree oven. At the table the skin will just lift right off the meat with a fork. Then lift the meat right off the bones. When the top side is done, use your fork to lift the entire spine and rib cage off the bottom side and keep enjoying. Very easy, no filleting or deboning required.Bake on a cookie sheet or baking pan in case any juices leak out of the foil. If you have any dill, fresh or dried, add some to the butter/lemons/onions before closing the foil."
1334999,Catman59,2011-07-28 14:40:00,345,There is a row of pin bones that are in each fillet. here is a pretty good set of directions http://www.boois.com/how-to-filet-trout.htm
1335009,Stu,2011-07-28 15:00:00,472,Make sure you keep them cold! I caught one once in August and put it on a stringer till the end of the day and the flesh turned mushy.
1335031,rdbalmer,2011-07-28 16:05:00,279,"My favorite way to eat them is deep fried just like a walleye. Fillet them like a walleye. Take the rib cage out and remove the row of pin bones and take the skin off. We always soak the meat in milk for an hour or two also. I don't know why but the meat tastes better to me that way.... less fishy tasting. I might also add that they taste alot better if you take the time to remove the gray colored fat on them. They have a tendency to be a bit greasy if you don't. Put your favorite breading on them and deep fry at 375 until golden brown, dip in some cocktail sauce and enjoy. In my opinion it just doesn't get much better than that. Rob"
1335043,ch1488,2011-07-28 16:29:00,6,"We always have at least one trout boil. Get a LARGE pot of water boiling with some lemons and Old Bay seasoning. Fillet the trout like a walleye and cube the fillets in one inch cubes. Place the cubes in a piece of cheese cloth and sinch-up but not too tight. When the water is really rolling put the cheese cloth bag of trout in the water and let boil for 13 minutes. Not 12 and not 14, 13 minutes. Have some melted butter and lemon juice ready. At 13 minutes remove the bag of trout from the water and open. All of the grease from the trout boils out and stays on the outside of the cheese cloth when it comes out of the water. We call it ""Poor Man's Lobster."" I do it at home the same way. Enjoy."
1335119,Enid Elizabeth,2011-07-28 20:14:00,59,"yup I agree with Jay. Lake trout has a taste of its own...not like salmon, not like walleye. Lots of omega fats. Taste varies with what the fish has eaten. Simple is best. Gut it and take the gills out. Keep the head on and eat the cheeks, don't forget to nibble on the tail. You can wrap it in foil for the oven as Jay suggests or just rub oil over the outside and put it directly on the grill. It has plenty of fat already so no need to add bacon or such. I use lemon pepper and chives on the inside. You will find it richer than walleye."
