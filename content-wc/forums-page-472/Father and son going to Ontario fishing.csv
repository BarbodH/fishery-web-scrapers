But in my humble opinion trying to cross without a passport or ""with an attitude"" will lead to difficulties.My wife takes at least one trip a year to our cabin without me and with some of our kids but she has never been asked for a letter, although she always has it with her."
1335301,outdoorsron,2011-07-29 10:30:00,843,Hello: I will be going to Gull Rock next Friday for a week. My friend and his son will also be going . They have passports and IDs.The son is 12 years old. The father heard something about getting a notarized Letter from the mother giving him permission to take his son to Canada. The father and mother are still married. I never heard of anything like this. Just wanted to know what other people do. It sounds to me like you could raise more suspicion at the border and cause delays. Just wanted to know what other people do. Or what you actually need to cross the border. Thank You O R
1335308,LOW1,2011-07-29 10:37:00,2828,"The child's mother should provide a letter giving permission for the child to cross the border. It does not need to be notarized, but in my experience having a notarized formal-looking letter will help give a good impression to the officer at the border. Out of fairness to the border officers, they have no way of knowing what the marital status of a parent is and the purpose of the letter is to help reduce the risk of one parent fleeing the US and taking the child with him."

They were returning to IN from a trip to Ontario as part of a church youth group outing, there were all taken off the bus and all had to call home, they even had a county judge in the group as a chaperone."
1335327,NARDA 1,2011-07-29 11:03:00,636,Have a letter made up and take it with and if the officer asks for it then present it to him. We havd taken kids up with us and the letter came in handy. The officer may still ask the child questions regarding his relationship to the other people in the van etc.
1335337,Reels,2011-07-29 11:26:00,2876,"Always had a dated letter. Never notorized. Never a problem, just a few questions."
1335354,fishnutbob,2011-07-29 12:28:00,633,The child's mother should provide a letter giving permission for the child to cross the border. Have fun good Luck.

1335466,jaggersr,2011-07-29 17:17:00,44,"My son goes with me to Ontario every summer. The first time he went was in 2000 when he was 10 years old. I had been going anually since 1986 so I was just used to packing up and going. I remember well when we crossed into the UP of Michigan thinking ""d*** I don't have anything that says Kyle is my son"" Nothing, no birth certificate not even a library card with his name on it. I called my wife in a panic and told her how to use the fax machine in my office and told her to stand by and wait on a phone call. We got to the boarder and they asked me the typical weapons, alcohol and tobaco quaetions. I told them that I was taking my son fishing near Chapleau for a week. The officer bent down and looked at my son and said ""you going with your dad fishing"". She must have notice the smile and excitment on my sons face when he said yes. She raised back up and said have a good trip. The next year I started taking his birth certificate. We have never been asked or questioned and I have never had to take his Birthcertificate out of the glovebox.. He is now 21 and in College and of course has his own passport. Looking back on my sons first trip and many there after. It really puts in perspective how kids could disapear. We will be leaving in two weeks to chase black bears and catch some walleye. Spending that week with my son has been some of the best bonding and mentoring a father cold ask for."
1336324,rnnonmt,2011-08-01 19:09:00,992,"I have been taking my son who is now 12 for the past 4 years and have never been asked to provide a letter. We carry our passports of course and show them at the border. I havent seen anything in the border crossing regs about this letter either. We get the typical questions and sometimes are asked how the group of 4 in our car all know eachother but that about it. We did have one funny incident on the way back in to the US this year when the female border patrol agent asked where the car was plated. I said ""isn't on the back?"" Sir, pull over into the detailed inspection lane and remain in your vehicle she said. DOH!! Lesson learned know what state your rental car is plated... not the location of the license plate! LOL"
1336413,Guest,2011-08-02 06:11:00,0,"I carry a letter with me for my boys each time I go. We go through several ties a year. (7 last year, 4 this year so far) There is one female border guard in Fort Frances that will ask for it a lot but she's a jerk. I have never been asked at any of the other places I have gone through. They cannot deny you entry because you do not have it but they can slow you down a little. Sad state of this world that they have to even ask for it. One thing most people do not realize is that you do not have to have a passport. If they want to make it difficult for you, they can, but US customs cannot legally deny you entry into your own country if you can provide proof that you are a citizen. Despite all the hoopla to the contrary, if you show a birth certificate and a driver's license, they cannot deny you entry. You won't breeze through, but they cannot stop you."
