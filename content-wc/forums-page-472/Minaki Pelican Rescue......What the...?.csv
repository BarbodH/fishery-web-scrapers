I noticed 3-4 pelicans floating dead in the water. Then one day I actually saw one drop out of the sky, motored up to it and it was d-e-a-d. Is there a sickness or is it just a heat thing.

1336562,Bill Krejca,2011-08-02 11:26:00,6107,"I would have my suspicions that some one got ""fed up"" with their fish eating and decided to blast some of them. A few years ago, there was a petition ""floating "" around Morson asking for an open season on them sort of ala cormorants. Kind of gives a different slant on things, I have no idea whether their diet has a severe impact of the fish population. Bill Krejca"

1336160,jignminow,2011-08-01 11:44:00,168,"So, we were up about a mile into Rough Rock by the islands and noticed a big white Pelican right by one of the islands and just out of the current. We were casting the shoreline that he was on so we figured he would move as we got closer. I noticed that he would try to fly and was struggling and kind of spinning around on the surface. As we got closer I realized that he had a whole bunch of heavy braided line wound around both of his shoulder blades and both wings. He was worn raw under one of his wings from it rubbing. We moved over to him and he tried to swim off but we could see a very long piece of the line trailing behind him. I was able to grab it and he just stopped without much fuss. I pulled in the tag end of the line first which seemed like at least 60 - 70' and found a white deep diving Muskie bait. We cut it off and gently pulled the bird into us where I could grab his bill and keep him calm. He was obviously very tired and not in the mood to struggle. My partner cut the numerous wraps of lines from him and let him go. He didn't want to fly but swam like a mutha accross the narrows to the other side. He was gone later so I assume all is well.I just can't figure out the scenario that puts a lure/leader with all that line out with the bird on the other end. If a fish would have taken that lure while being dragged by him it would have been over. In a fish fighting situation the line certainly would not have broken that far away from the bait and if it had, you would have certainly been able to grab it. The bait was free of weeds and it all looked like it was pretty fresh. Hooks fine etc. I guess we will never know but I was glad to have participated in this one good deed....."

I got him in the boat and he sat still while I untangled him and than just swam off. I was looking for a flurry of beaks and feathers but he was a lot more cooperative than I thought he would be.

1336256,lcwhit,2011-08-01 16:33:00,104,"white pelicans are very interesting birds. winter in gulf of mexico area and breed in northwest ontario. they dont dive like other pelicans, but rather fish in large groups herding minnows into shallows to feed on them. really neat to watch. the last couple of years they have stopped on their migration on our lake in a shallow bay across from my house in central illinois. good job."
1336277,Bluff,2011-08-01 17:18:00,152,"I have tried to rescue some loons in the past but they have proven to be too strong to get close to. They are also usually in deeper, open water. It's a shame to see them struggle."
1336282,tigerjohn1554,2011-08-01 17:32:00,77,"I'd say you scored some major points with the ""Man Upstairs"". Your kind thoughtfulness really brightened my day! Nice job!"

1336342,Juls,2011-08-01 20:02:00,13414,"Job well done...!!!!I have a watercolor painting that my Dad did of a point out on Newport Beach State Park's East side in Door County...he and I saved a seagull that was in the same predicament as your Pelican out on that point. He painted it as a reminder of that day. Another time, the ex and I rescued a little Tern that had a RipStick in its beak, and was tired of flying and fending off seagulls that thought the little guy had a fish, and were trying to steal it. The lure had line dangling from it, and as it flew slowly by, (wind made it seem like it was in slow motion) the line was close enough to grab. We ""handlined"" it in and cut the barbs off the hooks to release the bird from the bait.Both times the birds seemed to say, ""thanks"" as they swam slowly away from us. But, more than likely they were probably thinking, """"Juls"
1336377,MorganMan,2011-08-01 22:09:00,341,"Well done on freeing the bird. We learned a lesson on a fly in years ago. We had come off the lake due to wind/rain for a bit and upon returning to the dock found a seagull had swallowed the minnow that was still on one of our poles in the boat. We had left in such a hurry that the guy didn't take off his bait and just laid his rig in the boat. We were able to reel in the bird and ended cutting the line and let it go. I don't know if he ended up living or not, but we learned our lesson and had a couple of chuckles about the few bites the bird got in before it's release!"
1336383,JETSTER,2011-08-01 22:20:00,448,"Didnt you guys read about the guy that had his eye poked out by a bird he was saving (think it was a gull)!!!!!Wear goggles,no bird is worth losing your eye...."
