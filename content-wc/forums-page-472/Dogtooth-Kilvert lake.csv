1321971,Leeches,2011-06-23 22:27:00,106,Mavs we have caught numbers certain years but we have gone different time of year each time so numbers vary.I will say we have always got at least one big fish every year and we've put em all back I've learned the wind is number one fishing tool on this lake.I've noticed anything about these lakes is pretty tight lipped but I'll even lie to my fishing party about where I catch fish on this lake. LOL!! Don't we all?
