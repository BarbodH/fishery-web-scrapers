1334408,Aaron-IN,2011-07-27 08:02:00,500,"Just do what the rest of the walleye fisherman do up there, just follow another boat to their hotspot or sit in your boat with binos and when you see someone catch one motor up and drop right on top of them."
1334457,Danny61,2011-07-27 09:37:00,42,"Why is it when someone pulls in on a spot that someone is catching on everyone assumes that they have claim to that one spot on the lake. So silly, people can fish where ever they want when ever they want. So many spots on Big Sand and the spots are large enough for 15 boats to fish together and catch. Its Jack-*** idiots that get offended when a boat pulls in thinking that they are the only ones that know about Trappers or the elephants hump or noname or the rockpile or Pine island or hatrack or the brushpile or washtub or strawberry ils or the mouth of roughtrock channel etc etc etc. Take a chill pill welcome someone to a spot you are fishing if you see they are fishing wrong offer some help."
1334467,Aaron-IN,2011-07-27 10:05:00,500,"Ya, what he said."
1336152,jignminow,2011-08-01 11:28:00,168,"Yeah, it is funny. We were up in the entrance to Roughrock Channel a ways and on the way out, there were 4 boats, pretty much tied to each other, several guys standing up. Duh, wonder what is going on there? I watched 2 guys who obviously had fish on stop reeling and freeze like deer in the headlights....I started laughing and we spun around and dead stopped just to watch and see how long it would take for them to actually do something with them...we waited about 5 minutes and then just waived and took off to Duck Bay...It was way funny to watch the big attempt to hide.......strangely enough, drove through there a couple more times later in the week with nobody fishing that spot. we never tried it ourselves.................."
1336439,Aaron-IN,2011-08-02 07:27:00,500,"True story......a couple years ago I was up at the crack of dawn to throw some topwater baits for bass around the islands up on the East end of Big Sand. There were no boats anywhere that time of the morning. All of the sudden I could hear the hum of a boat coming towards me, a few minutes later this Jackwagon in a big Red Reatta slowed and pulled right in front of me then proceeded to throw a big musky lure. When I say ""right in front of me"" that is what I mean. I was utterly dumbfounded and a little PO'd. I whacked the side of his boat with my torpedo and he got upset about it. Of coarse I wasn't surprised to see he was from Illinois"
