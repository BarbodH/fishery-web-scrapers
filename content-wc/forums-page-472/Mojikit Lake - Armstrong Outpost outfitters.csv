It was my first time fishing in 20 years and caught hundreds of walleye and many northern including a 37"", 41"" and 42"" (what great fights ). The lake was beautiful and I really look forward to going back in the future."
1335939,Ogoki,2011-07-31 17:47:00,291,"Saw your post here about Mojikit. A GREAT body of water . Been there twice and have been to the Ogoki Reservoir eleven times .Ogoki Res. is pretty much the same water . All flooded timber . 54 species of bait fish in this system . Have been on 35 fly-in trips and Ogoki /Mojikit is the best we have been on . Was at the west end of Ogoki the second week of June . Was there 8 days and four evenings , the best way I can decribe it was ""insane "" walleye fishing . We were using small live minnows and the walleye even hit on a bare painted jig head. We took two of our Labs with us and when I would take a fish off, I would throw the jig into the water, to keep them from possible getting into one of the dogs . Caught walleye by accident that way . Just curiuos , did you see many other boats while you were out fishing ? I know Wilderness North has the 5 cabins on the northeast side of Mojikit and Ogoki Frontier has the two cabins in the channell. In fact one of Ogoki Frontiers cabins burnt down this spring . Was right at the begining of season . We bear hunt with the brothers of the owner of Ogoki Frontier . Going up next week for our hunt . I have three chocolate labs and I named one Ogoki (Goki for short ) and the other is named Mojikit (Moji for short) and the third is named Mattice ( Matti for short ) . That tells you what we think of those lakes . By the way we went with Armstrong Outpost to Whiteclay six times . Kinda thinking about being flown ito Whitewater next June with our canoe and being picked up at Ogoki Reservoir . Did that trip before and it is awsome . Paddle the length of Whiteclay . Whiteclay is my favorite lake as far as scenery goes . There is a two mile long narrow gorge there that has to be seen to appreciate . I have rambeled on enough . Love that area !!!!!!!"

You wouldn't want to miss seeing the Beckwith cabins on Best Island on Whitewater.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pghbJzpFmRcIt is interesting that Wendall Beckwith said that by triangling the stars his cabins are ""the center of the universe"".I think he had it right"
1336035,Whopper,2011-08-01 04:38:00,340,"Huskyfan, Armstrong Air does a great job, always a pleasure doing business with them. Ogoki, been to Whiteclay three times awesome fishery, first time I saw the canyon I was speechless, always fish to be caught at the ""rock"". The group I went with has been flying with Kelly since 1991 and has went to four of his different outpost, they had been to Mojikt three times before but they pretty much settled on Whiteclay."
1336050,Huskyfan,2011-08-01 06:33:00,2,"No we did not see any other boats. We went by 1 other cabin (closest one to ours) and saw no signs of life there. We never did a day of travel to the northern part of the lake, just to the dam on one day. I went with a group of guys that love Mojikit and have been there many times previous and knew of many great walleye areas near the camp. I think next year they are going to go to Attwood earlier in the year. 3 from our group usually go there during that earlier time and this time the whole group is going to go due to the other group breaking up. They said there is plenty of huge walleye to be had at Attwood during that early june fish."
1336399,Ogoki,2011-08-02 04:52:00,291,"Huskyfan , I was at Attwood twice several years ago. The time I was there in June we stayed on the east end of the lake and did real well on numbers and size of walleye. The time I was there in August we stayed on the west end and fishing was extremely slow , except for in the river . West end is like a big dishpan and the east end has more structure . I have fished numerous lakes in that area . Attwood , Hurst , Bellsmith ,Auger . Seemed to me those lakes were much better walleye lakes than pike lakes too. But, I mainly walleye fish too."
