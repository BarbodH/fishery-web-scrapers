The Canada remoteness is indescribable and can only be understood by taking the trip. My buddy and I went up for a week and caught 503 total fish (484 walleyes and 19 northerns). We didn't even get to fish hard a few of the days because of the crazy wind. The cabin and boat were in very good shape. The cabin had solar power and a very reliable generator. The running water (shower and flush toilet) was also a great bonus! The aluminum boats with 9.9 motors ran flawlessly and started on the first pull. Also, I would like to add that the service we received from Larry, Mary, and family was top notch from beginning to end! They are very friendly people who make you feel like you are at home right when you walk in. If any of you are looking for a great Canadian fly-in experience, you owe it to yourself to check them out! Also, if anybody has any questions, please feel free to message me. I just wanted to post this because posts like this helped me a lot when I first was looking at a fly-in trip. Have a good one!"

But, I don't know if it is the healthy lake or what, but these fish seriously put up a fight like the 20+ inchers here on the river do! They were very amped up and a fun battle every time. Our biggest on the week was 21.5 inches. As far as Northern go, they were on the smaller side and we never even put a stick on them. But, we did see a MONSTER northern at boatside when it attempted to eat a 17-18 inch walleye! HUGE mouth and it was a pretty cool situation. We never got it netted because it took off to quick, but I really would have liked to get that puppy in the boat!"
