No Comments.http://flyinfishingblog.com/wp-conte...98-300x199.jpgThis was the year of the big Northerns at Nestor Falls Fly-In Outposts at Lount Lake! On the first afternoon out I caught a 40″er and we had no camera on board! That was the best our party had ever caught. Then Monday I caught this Monster. We estimated the weight at 20-22 pounds and measured 43″. You have my permission to use the pictures. The walleye were good both in size and numbers. The first afternoon Mike and I caught 6 or more 22″ inch fish from the same area. We had to move on to find smaller fish! The biggest caught was 23.5″The bass were the challenge to us. We found enough to be interesting but it was not as good as we have been accustomed to. Jeff and Billie (the other two in the party) caught better numbers and several in the 18″ range.The lake was as low as we have seen it and was falling. It dropped almost two foot by the time we left. Thank you for running a first-class outfit at Nestor Falls Fly-In Outposts. We'll be back next year in June.Jim McBeeThis was a report I found on where we are going Spet 1. Very nice pike, and a good report."
