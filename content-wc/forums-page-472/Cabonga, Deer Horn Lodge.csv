1326580,eatsleepfish,2011-07-06 12:31:00,52,"As of Tuesday, it's down 1.7 feet. Heading up to DHL on Friday. Will be posting reports and pictures on my blog:http://eatsleepfish.blogspot.com/"
1326806,still fishin',2011-07-06 22:59:00,69,"Just returned 7-2-11. Fishing was just OK. Slot limits are 14&5/8 to 20&3/4 inches resulting in alot of throwbacks (not that we keep many 14"" walleye anyway). Had good walleye weather (cool, rainy, windy) but we still found fishing tough. One day our 3 boats caught 30 walleye combined (most throwbacks) and the next day(bright and sunny) we boated no walleye. On the bright side we managed to boat 3 throwbacks over 24"" including an 8 lb pig. No pike. Lake level appears normal with all docks in place and no problems navigating.Lessons learned during trailer tire blow-out on Rt. 117:-Don't assume your truck tire iron fits your trailer lug nuts-If you lock your spare tire to the trailer, make sure you can unlock it (frozen on)Good luck at DHL. Enjoyed your photos last year."

1329935,eatsleepfish,2011-07-14 15:43:00,52,The road is great! The camp looks great but it seems kind of empty. Walleye fishing has be great but the slot limit is tough.
1330081,cep56,2011-07-15 04:12:00,17,"Thanks for the info... I think the slot limit will pay off in years to come. I heard the reservoir used to be stocked with walleye years ago but has since stopped, although I believe it still holds good numbers of fish.Did you fish Barrier at all and was the spillway open? Last year, they were opening the gates as we were leaving.I looked at your blog-spot and it looks like you were in the big water mostly. The WaWa pass photo of last year really shows just how low the water level was. We were there as well."
1335599,boburns,2011-07-30 10:53:00,2,we went in early june and the water level was back to normal at that time. Fishing was fair at best. We caught a lot of small fish under the slot limit. This was my 26 trip to Deerhorn. Some years have been great and some very poor but that is just fishing. The new owner is very good. He has put a lot of effort into the place. The one problem we had this year were that we experienced more people than we have ever before. There is a lot of water to fish but it seemed every day we had people come right in on top of us which made it very hard to troll the area. I am not use to seeing a lot of people up there but this year had more than many years put together. Have had many great years there.
