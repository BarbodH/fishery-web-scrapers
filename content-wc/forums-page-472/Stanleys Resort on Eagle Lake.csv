Dock boys are very helpful to all of your needs on the water, all you have to do is ask. The portage lakes that Rob can send you to are outstanding I would suggest going to several of them during the week.I would get a guide for a day right away. It is an added expense, but, Eagle is big and the guide will put you on fish right away so you do not spend the week randomly fishing spots and catching few fish. These guides are good. Take a GPS, it is so much easier to get around with one. Most important, have a GREAT trip! Mike"

I have been there three times and Jim and Cindy take great care of there guests! I just stayed there last week and the walleye fishing was pretty good and the muskie fishing was amazing."
