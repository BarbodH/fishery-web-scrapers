We had two bad thunder storms at night. The first four days were awesome fishing and with the heat and storms at the end of the week it turned off and the fish went deep. Most fish were caught on bottom bouncers, spinners with worms, bouncers with floating jigs and leeches. We casted for pike with johnson silver minnows with pork. Largest pike for the week was 37"" caught on a deep reef runner. Big walleye for the week was 32"" caught on a bottom bouncer and worm. In some previous posts on Horwood Lake....I can tell you it is alive and well. Lots of big fish caught all week by everyone in camp. Enjoy the pictures....http://i313.photobucket.com/albums/l...ake2011077.jpghttp://i313.photobucket.com/albums/l...ake2011075.jpghttp://i313.photobucket.com/albums/l...e101/017-1.jpghttp://i313.photobucket.com/albums/l...tte101/012.jpghttp://i313.photobucket.com/albums/l...e101/007-1.jpghttp://i313.photobucket.com/albums/l...tte101/004.jpghttp://i313.photobucket.com/albums/l...ake2011087.jpghttp://i313.photobucket.com/albums/l...e101/001-1.jpg"

1334311,Jaskonie,2011-07-26 20:33:00,80,What part of the lake did you concentrate in? Nice fish.
1334431,ohiojmj,2011-07-27 08:36:00,1262,"Thanks for the report and pics. I never jump to conclusion when a few reports come in for a lake like Horwood that suggest it's fished out. Some weeks are tough, some fishermen can't adjust to conditions or find fish on new lake, and then there is luck and weather. Whic camp did you stay at and how was the road going in? Thanks."
