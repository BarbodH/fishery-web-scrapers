1336310,Big Wally,2011-08-01 18:51:00,2,We went in July around the fouth and caught about 30 fish per day. Two Drs were staying at Separation Camp Lodge and told me this was the best walleye fishing they had experienced in several lodges. They were on a repeat trip with their families. We had the mayfly hatch just a few days before and the fishing was still good. In three days we caught three really big walleyes 6-8 lb and a few 4 lb ers. Most were in the good eating range 1-2 lbs

We should have taken a guide and gone down river. We caught some fish, not a lot of walleye, I did catch a 30 inch northern. Restrooms were in need of updating and some of the sites although level, were somewhat narrow so you couldn't put your awning out and sit under your awning. Take an RV extension cord as the electirc outlets aren't too close to the sites and their are only 15/20 amp so take your adapter, too. There wasn't electricity at the docks for plugging in battery chargers, you either had to pull your boat out, use a generator, or pull your boat onto shore at your campsite and use a long extension cord. There wasn't a dump station either. Bellbuoy"

When we go up anything under 20"" is on the small side. We catch numerous 23-25"" walleyes in week with a few over 25"". I don't really fish for Northern but have tried there and there are some big ones but if you are looking for size and numbers there are better places in Ontario. We catch them fishing for Walleyes and usually get a couple over 30"" for the week. I would say if you fish only for nothern for a couple days you will get at least a 40"" fish. Smallmouth are decent. We have had some really good years but most of the time if you work for them you will be happy."

569758,onemorecast,2007-11-06 19:24:00,23,I value the feedback. I am curious if what kind runs you had to make (long trips? was it hard to navigate/rocks etc.)? I appreciate any information that can be provided.
569766,Guest,2007-11-08 07:45:00,0,You have to be really careful. There are a lot of hazards.
