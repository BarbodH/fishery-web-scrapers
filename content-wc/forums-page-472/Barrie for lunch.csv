1335656,micropterus,2011-07-30 15:07:00,450,We have stopped at Applebee's for a lunch coming home the last several years. I'm towing a dual axle trailer and the parking lot has lots of room even on Sat afternoon. Easy off and on 400. The service has declined to glacial and the food is not good. Time for a change. Any ideas?

There was a theme restaurant there named Moose Winooski's that we had recommended to us by some locals. It was a really fun atmosphere & the food was great. We had a great time there & there was a lot going on.Not too far off the hi-way as I remember.Web site:http://www.moosewinooskis.com/Enjoy !Fish

Kelsey's isn't bad, it is to your right if you get off the 400 at Molson Park at the back of the Walmart parking lot. However, you can't go wrong with Moose Winooski's, other than parking a trailer could be a challange."
1336055,EddieNorth,2011-08-01 06:59:00,32,Theres a mall parking lot right beside Moose Wisnooskis.
