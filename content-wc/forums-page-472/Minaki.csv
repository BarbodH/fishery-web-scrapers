1336028,Campcountry,2011-07-31 22:58:00,164,I have been fishing south of Minaki and the Walleye are in their usual summer haunts. Bottom bouncing deeper humps have been working for me and most of the fish I am finding are around the 30 to 40 ft level. Water temperatures around 72 degrees. I caught this nice one on Thursday http://youtu.be/FSHI1bqeIQo
