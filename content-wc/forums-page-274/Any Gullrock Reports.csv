3946457,tackleman,2015-06-08 11:31:00,444,"just got back from my first time this year fishing the lake, I spent about an hour at burnt island and never got a bite, only marked a few fish in the 30 foot range, then I went to the flats off the claybanks and picked up our first feed of the year in 18 to 20 feet of water. only had 4 fish in the boat, kept the 3 walleye and put back the northern. sure was so nice to finally be able to wet a line."
3946657,jkwildhunting,2015-06-08 13:06:00,361,Good to hear you were able to get out tackleman! See you on the week of the 20th
3946825,johnboat,2015-06-08 14:16:00,2014,"Was there last week. A group of 12. Fishing was good. Got better as the week went on. Started out cold. Then turned high 60*F with sunny to party cloudy skies. I was 100% jig and a minnow. First couple of days they preferred a little movement. Rest of week was spot lock and vertical. The less line they saw the better. Braided line was no good. Ranger Bay was not open, caught numbers up close to the bay by the reed bed but NO size. 4 - 10 feet of water there. Normal spots produced much better size and numbers were still good."
3946897,johnboat,2015-06-08 14:42:00,2014,"Sorry had to skip out, boss over shoulder! LOL Chartreuse, gold, black, blue were the best color as a group. My best were chartreuse fire tiger short shank wide gap hook, the 2nd was white with yellow fire tiger long shank. Biggest Walleye was 27 1/2.....(me).........THANKS Jdwildhunting for the spot!!!!!!!! Largest Northern was 44' (almost me ) that was jigged. And I caught a hand full of 40""s on purpose throwing a gold Williams warbler. Plenty of eaters, most got the freezer fish right on 18"", and more than enough 23""+ for the week. Depth was all over the board as we faced hot/sunny/calm (25 feet + ) and overcast with a walleye chop (12- 16 ft) A few in the group pulled crawler harness for a while. did fair, but jig and a minnow was the way to go. The Boot was NO GOOD!! bugs hovered over head so bad, you'd get half scared. Sounded like you were fishing over a bee hive. There were never more than 2-3 boats there at any given time. Should probably be great late this week to next week. Explored into Keg a little but was not productive. Went into Stone Bay but on the hot sunny day for walleye, wished it would have been on the ""walleye weather days"" Have a good trip and drive safe. When the Orange signs say ""bump in the road"" they really mean "" BUMP IN THE ROAD"". Was a drop off with gravel for a while. John B.O.A.T."
