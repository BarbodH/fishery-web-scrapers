3949913,tv4fish,2015-06-09 10:53:00,2694,Thank you Mark -- ALL good news.
3950009,bigwalleye1,2015-06-09 11:45:00,2632,"+1, thanks, Mark. I'll be making use of this info before the weekend!!!"
3951233,pjshorthorn,2015-06-09 17:47:00,5654,"Thanks for the great info Mark. Good to hear that reflective markers are in place. That is something that wasn't in place all the years I would go through in a HB or my own boat. Around 1998 I had gotten tired of listening to the stories about "" The Rags "" and how ominus they were to navigate. I dropped my boat off the back of the HB and figured out where the channel was ........slowly...with the HB following. Did that for a couple of years until I had it figured out. I still stick to my earlier comment...I respect this area more than most as it is easy to get off course going too fast. PjShorthorn"
3951793,fisher_i_am,2015-06-09 20:11:00,498,The engineer in me and google earth resulted in this analysis.... do you believe it?
3952473,bigwalleye1,2015-06-10 06:14:00,2632,"I've often heard quoated a 30 min plus savings with a houseboat, and the savings is most certainly speed sensitive. Thanks, fisher, for the confirmation."
3954769,scar,2015-06-10 19:45:00,196,Awesome Map and chart! I wish you were traveling with me as I travel all over SE and NE Lac Seul and always seem one turn away from being lost.
3955345,tv4fish,2015-06-11 06:45:00,2694,Are you saying that ALL the shorelines look the same ??????? In Lac Seul's case --- experience running the same route IS a great teacher.
3934697,Ranger319,2015-06-04 07:44:00,166,Anyone been through the rags? Is the water up high enough to blow through?
3934753,pjshorthorn,2015-06-04 07:54:00,5654,I read an earlier post saying that the Rags were not a problem . It didn't indicate that you could blow it right through there. The Rags are one area that I respect more than most on that section of Lac Seul. PjShorthorn
3937745,SeulAreaWalleye,2015-06-05 04:25:00,100,4 to 5 ft deep in there now...blow right through no problem. Have been doing it since opener....trimmed up!
3937889,bigwalleye1,2015-06-05 05:46:00,2632,...you draw less water on plane.....
3948129,Mark Oakley,2015-06-08 21:27:00,21,the rags is good i am a guide for Lacseul Flooting Lodges. I drive the house boats threw every weekend. your good to go
3948561,fisher_i_am,2015-06-09 06:17:00,498,"What is your recommendation for a first timer? How do I get through safely, I've never ventured through figuring the risk on my vacation and boat was not with it. How much time does it really save?"
3948657,pjshorthorn,2015-06-09 06:37:00,5654,"In a HB it will save approximately an hour instead of going around Devil's Elbow. In a fishing boat....maybe 20- 30 minutes. If you haven't gone through before, slow down and look for the channel opening between all the stumps. It can be hard to identify the channel if you are going pretty fast. If you are fortunate enough to have another boat go through first, it is much easier to identify the channel. After a few trips through, it becomes much easier to navigate. Good luck on your trip. PjShorthorn"
3948905,tv4fish,2015-06-09 07:24:00,2694,"Hey Mark: How close to ""normal"" would you say the water level is in that area of Lac Seul????"
3949601,Mark Oakley,2015-06-09 09:53:00,21,pjshortorn is right for the time saveing.we have cruve reflectors up they are green and white as you come up to the rags you will see the first one. aim for it as you get closer you will see the chanel to the left. stay alittle closer to the right side stumps as you go threw you will see the other reflector it will be on the right side just pass it abit and your good to go . you dont have worry about hitting its all mud bottom. hope this makes sence
3949625,Mark Oakley,2015-06-09 09:56:00,21,the water leval is normal its where it should be
