How can you tell you are on a wind blown side or point as the wind often changes directions. Finally, Why is that good for locating walleye?"
3951649,Carnhzkr,2015-06-09 19:35:00,964,"The theory behind fishing wind-blown points, islands, and shorelines is that walleyes, like all predators are opportunistic and look for easy prey. You'll usually find walleye where you find baitfish. Baitfish know this, so they're often found hiding in shallow water along the shore. When the wind blows in, waves whip up the water and force the baitfish deeper, where they become easy prey to feeding walleye. I'm not sure the wind ""often changes direction"". Usually, you have a southerly or easterly (or whatever) wind, and for the most part, it stays generally in that same direction, unless a front moves in. Often, the windward shoreline is best if the wind has been blowing in a consistent direction for a few days. One of my favorite ways to use the wind is to find a bay where the wind has been blowing in. I like to fish the weed edge in the back of the bay. The walleye I'm holding in my avatar is a 29"" I caught in exactly that type of area. They were stacked up like Legos in that bay for two days while the wind was blowing in."

Most times we go in boats of two for safety reasons and one boat will head off on one side of an area or bay, the other boat the other side. I know which side my boat will be heading! Knowledge is priceless!"
3952761,MrSimon,2015-06-10 07:29:00,922,"Some people say the wind blows (or whips up) micro-organisms into the back of the bay ... minnows follow the food, perch and stuff follow the minnows, and walleye follow them."
3952793,tv4fish,2015-06-10 07:32:00,2694,"Maybe just to point out -- a lot of places in Canada have ""shield rock"" and you typically won't find weed beds off ALL wind blown points, but you probably still will find walleyes in those areas. The principle is still the same."
3952857,pjshorthorn,2015-06-10 07:40:00,5654,"One aspect I look for on a windy day, whether it be a narrows, point or island, is a current line/rip line. The line will look like bubbles or a froth on top of the water. It normally indicates a transition from shallower water to deep water. If I find those lines, I'm fishing them. Years ago I was running late to get shorelunch going and came across a very defined pollen line on the way to shore. Told my buddy we need to try this line. He said you're crazy. First cast..fish. Second cast...fish. Repeat.... If you see transitions on top of the water....fish them. Read the water....it will tell you something. PjShorthorn"
3952993,wallydave,2015-06-10 08:00:00,2151,"Lac Seul is a stained lake, the wind blown points will look cloudy, casting jig and minnows into these areas can produce walleyes and pike, working in and out of the edge of the cloudy water can be productive. Happy fishing!"
3954993,RoughWaters,2015-06-10 21:20:00,98,"When fishing the wind blown shoreline/ points, etc. Don't be afraid to fish shallow- I've had great success pitching jigs into as shallow as 1.5- 2 feet of water. If the water is churned up good, the fish will be there, and it can be a blast! Good luck."
