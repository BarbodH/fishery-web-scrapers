They caught about 185 pike and 185 walleye in their 5 day trip. Biggest walleye at 23"" and biggest pike at 10 pounds. They fish all different varieties of lures and methods and say they caught a few on everything from jigging to trolling. This group has gone there many years so they know the spots that produce the fish."
