I wanted to know if there was any public access to get on Lac Seul in the area, or if any of the camp owners allow non guests to launch at their facilities. I have fished Lac Seul on three different trips and had good fishing each time. I wanted to try a different lake this year so I chose Cedar, but if I was not having great success on Cedar I would like to fish Lac Seul for a day."
3955793,skindzier,2015-06-11 08:28:00,137,Yep - maybe 10 miles or so north on 105. Right side of the road just after Fisherman's Cove. The ramp is well maintained & is used a lot. In July I'd head to McKenzie Bay from there...
3956377,bassin1977,2015-06-11 10:52:00,4,"Thanks, not having been to Cedar Lake is there a big difference in the quality of fishing that time of year compared to Lac Seul?"
3956401,skindzier,2015-06-11 11:00:00,137,"I have only jumped into Cedar a couple times to fish muskies, so I can't answer that. I think the general consensus would be that Lac Seul is better for walleyes but I certainly don't have any firsthand experience with that. Lots of folks love Cedar too, so I don't think you can go wrong..."
3957441,Pooch,2015-06-11 15:30:00,4619,"This ramp is a public ramp and like others have said, is pretty well maintained. Not a lot of parking though. ""Skywagon"" on this board uses it as I have met and fished with him there.Pooch"
