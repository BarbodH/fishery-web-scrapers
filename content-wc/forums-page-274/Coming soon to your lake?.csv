3958761,octanehi5,2015-06-12 06:22:00,1104,"There are a few lakes from the Gouin and south that have them, never caught one on Hebert. Once filleted you can not tell the differance."
3958801,octanehi5,2015-06-12 06:31:00,1104,"As far as coming to our lake ? Hebert is spring fed, all water flows out of the lake, The water is not as tea stained as most lakes up there. Walleye will be dipped in beer batter and set free in hot peanut oil, served will a nice Chianti"
3960345,forgop,2015-06-12 14:42:00,880,"Fished Anjigaming last August and as noted in the review Mike Borger did, they were quite blue there."
3964353,quickster2,2015-06-14 07:39:00,41,Caught a few last year at Happy Day's. They taste just as good!!!!
3964393,Pikeslayer8,2015-06-14 07:48:00,1460,Wouldn't know about that. Since we have fished this lake for so many years and to abruptly start catching these vibrant blues. We threw them all back. We figured there were plenty of normys to go around.
3967018,cm1977,2015-06-15 07:47:00,5,"We have been catching blue ones for at least 5 years. The frequency has not increased. We leave again Sunday so I will pay more attention and report back. We have done very well taking the portage and walking down the Allenwater River. Lots of larger fish, fun to catch from shore!"
3956361,Pikeslayer8,2015-06-11 10:49:00,1460,"Blue bacterium. About 15% of the walleyes we caught were blue, bright pretty blue. It's in Wabakimi! Don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing."
3956465,cm1977,2015-06-11 11:15:00,5,"We fish Granite Lake 2 times a year, which flows into Wabikimi and have seen our fair share of Blue walleyes. So they are definitely in the system. Not sure of the cause???"
3956505,Pikeslayer8,2015-06-11 11:23:00,1460,"That's some good information. Do you know how long they have been in Granite? We stopped in on your Granite camp once, beautiful lake, shhh I know,... Our pilot flew us into camp from there flying real low over the Allenwater River. It was a cool perspective how close our camps are but yet so far away."
3956897,Whopper,2015-06-11 13:03:00,340,"Pikeslayer, I have fished WhiteClay which is northeast of you and caught them too. Don't know how or why they are like that but I will tell you I have some blue stains on some white tshirts from handling them"
3957145,bartidge,2015-06-11 14:12:00,12,"...wait until they don't only have blue on the upper fins but lose all their yellow on the belly and are white/silver.We have been catching that sort intermningled with yellows on Dumoine Lake in Quebec for years...The blue slime coat is called ""sander cyanin"" and is a phenomenon that is expanding in modern walleye.It is speculated to be a type of fish UV protectant.I have no idea why some of these blue fish are also losing their yellow bellies too... but we appear to be witnessing some sort of adaptation or evolutionary process first hand...The good news is the blues are just as tasty as the yellows!"
3957185,fosterthedog,2015-06-11 14:17:00,51,"Caught one 8 or 9 years ago, arril lake fly in out of Armstrong. Got my curiosity going when I got home did a research when I got home did a little studying. Biologist have found its a genetic (hereditary) abnormality that allows a certain blue algae to adhere it self to the fish. It's also noncyclical so some years you won't see them if that algae doesn't bloom, caught mine in July hot, hot weather."
3957497,mickr,2015-06-11 15:49:00,74,blue walleye are a different but related species
3957545,Pikeslayer8,2015-06-11 16:01:00,1460,"Wabakimi flows into Kenoji. Kenoji flows into Oliver. Oliver flows into Whitewater. Whitewater flows into Whiteclay. That's weird that with all that flowage, you caught them 4 lakes over, first!Quote: Originally Posted by bartidge...wait until they don't only have blue on the upper fins but lose all their yellow on the belly and are white/silver.

My brother wants to know when we'll start catching pink ones... Quote: Originally Posted by fosterthedogCaught one 8 or 9 years ago, arril lake fly in out of Armstrong.

Still, amazes me that if the blues are in with the ""regulars"", wouldn't every fish get this bacterium."
3958641,Bstar,2015-06-12 05:15:00,564,Caught blue walleyes on Papaonga Lake north of Lac Seul several years ago on a day fly-in.
3958705,fishron,2015-06-12 05:57:00,317,"On the Cabonga reservoir in Quebec we would catch the blue mutation on occasion. Also a fish would occasionally show up that had a definite red coloration to it. These turned out to be sauger and maxed out at about 20 inches and usually smaller. We would also catch walleye that were much darker than the norm. These could have been influenced by their immediate habitat. Steve, who ran the camp would say there were four colorations. Yellow, Blue, Red, and Black."
