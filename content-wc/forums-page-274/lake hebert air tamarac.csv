3966458,octanehi5,2015-06-15 04:22:00,1104,"Just got the report back from Hebert, Daniel (caretaker) says The fishing has picked up alot,waters are warming.Still below normal temps, The numbers of fish being caught both walleye and pike is on the rise. This weeks groups are doing well, Next week we have two groups going one flying in on sat. and my group on sunday. Fishing will be of the hook, Looking foreward to fishing with some old friends,Fishfries,cigars and a few Beers"
3896633,retire55,2015-05-22 13:46:00,1029,"A little cool in Clova these days. HI of 36 degrees F today and a LO of 25 overnight. Fortunately, over the week, the weather forecast predicts the temps to rise nicely."

3908930,bftiger,2015-05-27 08:01:00,21,"Do you use dead bait (suckers, smelt) for pike fishing ?"
3909978,octanehi5,2015-05-27 13:31:00,1104,Its illegal to fish in this zone with live or dead bait fish. worms or leeches thats it
3910218,retire55,2015-05-27 14:55:00,1029,"While I may be misinterpreting Quebec's sportfishing regulations, I believe the answer depends on where you're fishing on Lac Hebert. The southern portion of Lac Hebert resides in Zone 16 where possession and use of dead bait (see definition of baitfish) is authorized. However, the northern portion of Lac Hebert resides in Zone 17 where possession and use of baitfish (dead or alive) is prohibited."
3910314,Freytown,2015-05-27 15:43:00,770,Doesn't Air Tamarac set all the rules on Hebert??? That's what I always thought. ????
3910426,octanehi5,2015-05-27 16:16:00,1104,"You are correct about air Tam setting the rules, they have exclusive rights to the lake. Also carry the rule of only 4 walleye and 4 pike can make the trip home. Its one of the reasones its one of if not the best lakes in Quebec, Slot limits of fish you can take are from 14 to 20"""
3910498,fosterthedog,2015-05-27 16:40:00,51,"I think Air Tamarc has the rights to Lac Hebert and to enforce the regulations of the province. By setting a slot they are trying to make this a sustainable lake for the people that want to come back. It is a relatively small lake when compared to others in the area, I myself don't think 4 fish a day less what you eat is unreasonable. That said I wouldn't care if I couldn't take any home, the bite is just so mind numbing most days, it ruins fishing in your zip code."
3910810,octanehi5,2015-05-27 18:33:00,1104,"This yr will be my 11th straight yr on the lake I have enjoyed watching the average size and numbers grow every yr.due to the rules they impossed. Its a weeks fishing that most guys can only dream about. Jean & Eliane run a top notch outfitter, In my opinion of fishing northern Quebec for more than 25 yrs. Have not found a better one."
3911026,fishron,2015-05-27 19:50:00,317,"I certainly have to agree that the walleye fishing on Hebert is exceptional. My group has been into some good walleye fishing in the middle area of Ontario where the keeper limit is 17 inches. It's difficult throwing back 18 to 20 inch walleye which I consider ideal eating size and wading through a bunch of 14 to 16 inchers looking for that prime 17 incher for your take home limit. Where I live in Southeastern Pennsylvania, you can't buy walleye in the food market, (Although growing up I can remember blue pike from Lake Erie being available until they were fished to extinction). However they are regulating the fishing on Hebert, it's working. That week is getting closer, Ron. Thanks for suggesting Kevin for our group. I'm looking forward to fishing with him. See you on the lake."
3861673,hugepike0,2015-05-11 17:48:00,28,Hello - has anyone fished lake hebert with air tamarac for pike? I have heard it is a walleye factory but don't here much on the pike fishing there....any thoughts? thanks for any help - Tight lines!
3861721,octanehi5,2015-05-11 18:06:00,1104,"I have fished the lake for 11 yrs, there are many guys that just fish for pike, our best pike in camp being 46"" my personal best being 43"" at 25 lbs, you can look to catch a few in the 40's many in the 30's."
3864313,hugepike0,2015-05-12 12:15:00,28,"thanks for the info - I am thinking about the first week there, usually I would look for shallow bays but the lake doesnt appear to have a lot of those. any thoughts on that? and are there good numbers of pike or fewer than I might find on the gouin. thanks again for any help!"
3864513,octanehi5,2015-05-12 13:37:00,1104,"Hebert Has some big shallow bays one near camp 25 and the biggest is the far north east bay Danial the caretaker can show you were, If I was going to fish for strictly Pike I would go to the Gouin much more water area with more bays. Comparing the two lakes is nearly impossible. Hebert is 12 miles long and 1 1/2 miles wide at most,the Gouin is the size of the state of Rhode Island! Fishing for walleye does not get any better than Hebert,On the Gouin you have a better shot at a 50"" pike"
3864889,hugepike0,2015-05-12 16:21:00,28,thanks for the input - I have fished the gouin the last 3 years - only a couple pike over 40 (barely) and VERY few between 30-40 - not a novice - have fished all over canada and alaska - cant help but thinking people keeping tons of pike is hurting it badly - would like to see more in the 30-40 range - the guys in your party that fish mainly for pike catch many of those on Hebert?
3865905,octanehi5,2015-05-13 05:23:00,1104,"our usual weeks outing, three or four in the 40's,a lot in the 30's, The ones under 32 we eat sometimes. There is a big differance in how many fish you can keep .On the gouin whitch has many outfitters on it they go by Quebec's fishing alotment, 8walleye and 8Pike On Hebert Air Tam has put a limit on both for the last 10 yrs. only 4 walleye and 4 pike with a slot limit of 14 to 20 on walleye 32 "" an under on the pike everything else goes back in the lake.Myself I rate the Gouin as a good fishery, Hebert on the other hand Can not be beat, Best Walleye fishery in Quebec Period"
3865921,Freytown,2015-05-13 05:27:00,770,Gouin in Zone 14 Limits 8walleye 10pike.http://peche.faune.gouv.qc.ca/?lang=...l+endroit=null
