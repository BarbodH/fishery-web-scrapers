3969170,v-bay gord,2015-06-15 16:48:00,3168,"Sad to say, but I'm old enough that I probably bought them new....back in the day. Interesting to recall the ""tackle shops"" that existed 40 years ago. I still remember the new car smell of a Ciscoe Kid fresh out of the box...."
3966570,prov1800,2015-06-15 05:42:00,5010,"Not many reports from eagle lake so heres one.guided out of fin and feather for 8 days, party of 11 people mixed with kids.4 guide boats.walleyes were biting real good and easy to catch even for the kids.walleyes are still shallow and some have gone deeper and did well down to 20 ft.spent afternoons either casting for pike or smallies.did fairly well on smallies, but pike fishing was real good catching fish up in the 38""-40"".numbers of both slot sizes for walleye and pike were awesome.water temps are rising so i suspect the deeper bite is coming very soon.while casting for pike we saw and caught a unbelievable amount of muskies.and also on jigs and minnows.was a great trip for our guests."
3966610,pjshorthorn,2015-06-15 05:52:00,5654,Thanks Prov1800. Going to be on Eagle Lake at the end of July so this is encouraging news especially on the musky bite. PjShorthorn
3966634,prov1800,2015-06-15 06:07:00,5010,Fishing conditions will change by the time you come.i would fish deeper then.weeds are starting to come up now and should be much better in a couple of weeks.muskies sure seem to like the smaller lures this time of the year.which part of eagle will you be on.
3966682,pjshorthorn,2015-06-15 06:29:00,5654,"We will be fishing out of V-Bay Lodge hunting those ""River Monsters"" along with walleye, pike and perch. My impression is that the walleye will be in 20-30 fow by the end of July and associating with mid-lake humps and steep drops/points. PjShorthorn"
3966762,prov1800,2015-06-15 06:45:00,5010,My old stomping grounds.dont fish up in that section much anymore since i guide mostly on the east section.good fishing up west though.love the deep bite.good luck.
3967106,v-bay gord,2015-06-15 08:07:00,3168,"In the Vermilion Bay section we've had some very good fishing. A great crank bait bite for walleye (if that's your preference.....my best luck has come on the mid sized Rapala Husky Jerk, in black and silver) but everything seems to be working including live bait. Shallow, mud flats, reed edges, boulder piles all seem to have produced walleye. Had a group of bass fishermen from Tennessee last week who caught their limits of walleye casting for bass. I think the mud flat bite will be still on for a couple weeks yet....but fish will gradually move into the drop-offs, especially during mid day. A mayfly hatch will be likely coming soon, and that drives fish to the flats. Lot's of bass being caught, especially on some of the portage lakes.......lake trout too. A real eye opener this year has been the number of musky caught, seen or lost by anglers targeting other fish. It happens every spring but I can't recall a spring with such a volume of musky caught."
3967602,mms3rd,2015-06-15 09:49:00,148,"My Son and I just returned from a 9 day trip at VB Lodge. Gord took me out the second day to help convince me to use crank baits....black silver husky jerk....my son is husky jerk addict. In the first 15 minutes, I had a 38-40 inch muskey...I claim 40.....size matters, right? My son had on three much bigger muskies while fishing bass with spooks and walleye with husky jerks. Somehow, I hooked a big muskey that also had the northern in its mouth that my son was reeling in...we could not get it to fit into the net and into the boat. Very sad. I have often questioned the difference color makes with a lure. One evening fishing a channel, I caught 8 walleyes on black/silver while son caught 8 northerns on blue/orange....neither of us caught a single fish of the other species. The fishing seemed slow, but the water was new to us, we are probably 6/10 fishermen when it comes to big water...and I blame the good weather. Gord was a marvelous host who took care to make sure that we had everything we needed. The camp was super well taken care of."
3968026,fishinnut 3446,2015-06-15 11:38:00,638,Where is this Vermillion Bay Lodge everyone speaks of ?Just kidding Gord ! Got the pleasure of meeting him and having a OV and shooting the bull after one his camp guests towed my Son&Daughter back to his camp and got them up and on their way again .Thanks again Gord !
3968762,v-bay gord,2015-06-15 15:20:00,3168,"Hey Billl, thanks for the comments! Don't put your fishing skills down, it's tough to know what to stick with on new water. Maybe I should have taken your tackle box away from you and only allowed you two Husky Jerks per person!"
3968794,v-bay gord,2015-06-15 15:24:00,3168,"I seem to running into a bunch of WC people lately. BobbyFisherMon popped in for a visit, and I ran into Blue Lake for the first time too. It seems WC is made up of some pretty decent folk. So for others who might be passing by, feel free to stop in. Can't guarantee there will be a cold OV in the fish house, but chances are pretty good there will be....."
