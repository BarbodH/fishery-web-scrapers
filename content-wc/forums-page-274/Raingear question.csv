3955713,back357,2015-06-11 08:11:00,106,I have a question about sprucing up rain gear. I have a cabela's breathable rain jacket. It seems to have lost some of it's waterproofness after a few years. Can I just spray it with a 3M Scotchguard or something like that or would that damage it?
3955737,MrSimon,2015-06-11 08:21:00,922,Might as well try it. Sounds like it's either that or buy a new one.
3956001,Fpatka,2015-06-11 09:23:00,20,there is a product called Nikwax. You wash it in and hang the garment to dry. I used it a couple of times and seems to work good.
3956033,pwbmlr,2015-06-11 09:39:00,37,"If it is a true Cabelas branded suit. Return it. Cabelas doesn't advertize it but they offer a lifetime replacement warranty on their branded clothes. If you have the reciept send a copy in with it. If not, it is ok. Just type up a letter with: what is wrong with the item, about how long ago you bought it and what was the cost, and how it was used (ie. mainly used for fishing on my boat, or my hunting rain gear) You then attach this this letter to clothing and put a not on it ATTN: Valuation DEPARTMENT. Throw that in a box and if you have a return label still from prior orders use it.( they wont charge you the shipping for the return). You will get a gift card once they make their decision on it. I have done this about 3 times and haven't been disappointed. They have on average given me about 75% back in a gift card of what I thought I paid for the item. Downfalls to this:1. You dont have a rainsuit to use for a few weeks.2. You don't know what they will give you.3. It can take several weeks to hear something.Most of the time Cabelas isn't the best price on item unless it is on sale. But I have bought from them for over 20 years and in my opinion they treat their customers great. I have never felt like they didn't do me right. I guess it makes me feel better spending several thousand a year there when I know if I have an issue they still follow the old saying"" the customer is always right""."
3956161,SinOrSwim,2015-06-11 10:04:00,1528,"I spray my stuff with camp dry/scotch guard stuff every year. Boots, bibs and jacket. Bibs are cabelas but the jacket is columbia. I find it makes stuff bead up and run off really fast. I tend to wipe my hands on my rain gear all the time and not sure if its the dirt and stuff from fish but it tends to hold water and almost makes my pants wet. Doesn't go through to get me wet but with the camp dry the water beads up and is gone right away."

3957617,prov1800,2015-06-11 16:32:00,5010,Goid gortex or dri plus shouldnt leak.if you spray stuff on in it it will not let outvthecmoisture inside and causes sweating.to me theres nothing like buying the best.you will get years of service.i use mine sll the time.probably more than most people.there still hoing strong now.best suit is by far the bass pro qualifier.mine is 7 years old.
3958497,lassh,2015-06-11 22:37:00,553,The nix wax product seems to work. I've also sprayed silicone on goretex outer wear before and it may not be as breathable but its not noticeable. It will keep to outer shell from getting soaked and help prevent that wet feeling you sometimes get when wearing gortex even when its not leaking.
3958833,phishfearme,2015-06-12 06:40:00,1242,even if these products seem to work - I wonder how long they will last and if they will no doubt give out during a july wet snow storm. I've always've said that you cannot spend too much on rain gear. phish
3962441,Aspencreek,2015-06-13 11:26:00,2911,"X2!!!!!! You can try and save a few bucks by not getting the gortex, and justify it all you want, but having a GOOD Rainsuit will make you glad you spent the money. I found mine at Gander mtn on sale or $100 for the bibs and $100 for the jacket about 10 yrs ago. I know they are more than double that now, but if you check the sales or the bargain caves you can find them, get bigger than you need. I would rather have A GOOD rainsuit than a new $200 ROD."
