3950321,Yetidad,2015-06-09 13:28:00,7,"I have been taking our boats to Canada for years without a problem. But...one of the camps we go to in Ontario now insists that we should be complying with Transport Canada's requirements for safety gear. This includes a flare gun, a whistle, a throwable rescue device, a floating throw line, magnetic compass and a deployable anchor. The worry is if you get stopped on the water and you don't have all of this crap on board, you get a hefty ticket and might have to trailer the boat. Canada's regs are not all that clear if this is actually the case but we spent the $$ and now the stuff is all in the lockers on the 620. Food for thought."
3950505,Bill Krejca,2015-06-09 14:11:00,6107,"The last time I looked into the boat regulations, it said something to the effect that for non-res they were expected to have the equipment on board that were required in the state the boat is registered in. I am not aware of a change in this, if someone is aware of a change, please share with us. Thanks, Bill"
3950513,Yetidad,2015-06-09 14:15:00,7,"Bill, That was what we always understood as well. But, I would hate to be checked and be wrong, or run into an OPP officer who wanted to make me an example."
3950569,Carnhzkr,2015-06-09 14:24:00,964,"I'm sure I've read that somewhere. I'll do some research. This will be my first time pulling my own boat across, and my intent has been to remain legal by Iowa regs. Iowa requires some, but not all of the items Yetidad listed. I sure hope I'm right about this. I'd hate to store all of that crap."
3950649,Carnhzkr,2015-06-09 14:33:00,964,Per: http://noto.ca/boating_regulationsNon-residents of Ontario who bring their own boats do not need to show proof of competency unless their boat will remain in Canada for more than 45 consecutive days. Guests with their own boats simply need to comply with the requirements of their home state with respect to operator competency AND carriage of safety equipment.
3950825,pjshorthorn,2015-06-09 15:31:00,5654,This is my understanding as well. PjShorthorn

3947793,_colorado,2015-06-08 19:57:00,8,"I am headed to Eagle Lake in July and want to take my boat instead of renting one from the lodge. Is it a real hassle to take a boat from the US (Colorado) into Ontario? Are aquatic nuisance inspection stations located near Dryden? Besides things like registrations and proof of ownership, a boater license (exam), is there anything else I would need to do in order to fish from my boat? I have been exchanging emails with the Canadian customs people and got some general information but not specifics. I'd greatly appreciate any tips or advice. Have a great summer every one!"
3947841,10point,2015-06-08 20:11:00,102,I have never had an inspection or anything. The boating exam is if you are renting a boat in Canada.
3947873,_colorado,2015-06-08 20:27:00,8,Thanks 10 Point. I would just hate to tow my boat 1200 miles and then not get to use it. Maybe not having boat inspections is why I've not gotten a satisfactory answer from customs or boating. Thanks again!
3947969,Ndstallmann,2015-06-08 21:03:00,549,Please inform me about this boaters license exam?
3948017,Carnhzkr,2015-06-08 21:05:00,964,"No issues whatsoever crossing the border with a boat. Billions of people do it every day (okay, maybe thousands)."
3948073,Aspencreek,2015-06-08 21:14:00,2911,"There is no issues with bringing your own boat across, my brother does it and he shouldn't be allowed too!!"
3948113,Jesse-WI,2015-06-08 21:18:00,534,"Ontario Boat Operators Card: Non-Resident Boat Operator: Does not apply to non-residents operating their own pleasure craft in Canadian waters for less than 44 consecutive days. Non-residents renting a pleasure craft fitted with a motor will be required to complete a Rental Boat Safety Check List at the place of rental. Unless: 1. They have a Canadian Pleasure Craft Operator Card, or 2. They have written proof of having successfully completed a boating safety course prior to April 1, 1999, or nautical certification, or in the case of non-residents proof of competency from their own country."
3948225,_colorado,2015-06-08 22:34:00,8,Super info guys! You saved me $50 on the test/prep. Good to know about taking the boat! Whoo-hoo!
3948393,pjshorthorn,2015-06-09 04:47:00,5654,Where are you staying on Eagle Lake? We will be at Vermilion Bay Lodge 8/25 - 8/1. PjShorthorn
3948969,_colorado,2015-06-09 07:35:00,8,"pjshorthorn - we are staying at South Shore Lodge, 7/2-7/9. SSL looks to be almost directly south (and slightly east) of VB. Hope you have a great trip!"
