3959713,BRP,2015-06-12 10:16:00,77,"Agree the need for cash is pretty rare. Use plastic and pay the official exchange rate plus maybe a 2% surcharge. If you need a hundred bucks to have cash just in case, hit an atm after you cross the border - again, you'll pay a small surcharge plus a couple bucks for the atm fee."
3960377,pastorted,2015-06-12 15:01:00,19,"Actually, I have found quite a few camps will only take checks or cash, or strongly prefer to do so. Also a lot of the smaller businesses will not take credit cards."
3963329,Sooner fan,2015-06-13 17:53:00,6,I am curious about the exchange also. I cross at International Falls and I am wondering where people typically exchange money in Fort Frances? The problem for me with going to some of the banks downtown is I am towing a boat and not having a good place to park fairly close.
3963417,fishman10,2015-06-13 18:34:00,226,"First of all exchange at a bank etc for a fair rate. Second, I have stayed at resorts, and they always have given me ( Canadian) a better rate or I pay in Canadian currency. Have ou ever noticed the first question they ask you? Where are you phoning from. Then they charge accordingly. Of course this will not happen in high season, or if American customers are trying to book as well Can't blame the business owners as they are getting 20 percent more."
3965145,NARDA 1,2015-06-14 12:16:00,636,Our group uses debit cards for all our purchases (you get the exact exchange rate at the time of purchase less about a 2 percent transaction fee) and we pay the lodge with a check. Makes it very simple and you don't have to worry about exchanging money.
3956537,sbe2,2015-06-11 11:33:00,63,"I know this is supposed to be about walleye fishing but...For those of you who do swap American for Canadian, are you exchanging at the duty free, an American bank, or Canadian bank? Also, what rate are you getting?"
3956593,Puckfan21,2015-06-11 11:43:00,8,1 dollar USA = 1.23 dollar CAN
3956625,TIGHTLINER,2015-06-11 11:48:00,223,We always try to hit the casino at the soo. The last couple years it has not been open so we have hit banks in ontario. We have had some trouble in the past at the banks where they would only exchange a certain amount. This year we stopped in wawa at the canadian bank there. They were very friendly and said as long at we have two proper id's they have no problem with it. We got 22 cents on the buck which was very good. I watch www.xe.com and always figure you are going to get about 3 cents less than what is printed here.
3956937,Obabikon,2015-06-11 13:12:00,2370,1.23 is the actual exchange rate. Most banks will be giving in the range of 1.20 for cash.
3958201,youngknight,2015-06-11 20:32:00,228,It's this exchange rate that is making it hard for us Canadians to make some purchases...eg was saving for an it roll but an extra 22% really sucks. It is also terrible for us going to camps that charge in $us. Consider a camp that charged $1000 a person last yr...$us...last year that would cost us $1040 or so...this year $1250 cash after the exchange fees...a substantial increase...good for those outfitters though. Probably just go to your bank at home...it might cost you %1 or so but likely takes away the hassle while you are travelling.
3958233,v-bay gord,2015-06-11 20:38:00,3168,"A Canadian going to a camp that charges in US $.....my, my...that's disappointing."
3958817,phishfearme,2015-06-12 06:37:00,1242,just curious but what do you need cash for? I've found that plastic is taken almost everywhere in Ontario. phish
3959057,bigdaddyguns,2015-06-12 07:23:00,608,Also a considerable number of businesses in Ontario happily accept US currency. Given that with credit cards no need for exchanging to CAD$ anymore.
3959385,birddogger,2015-06-12 08:21:00,43,Paying US cash to a canadian retailer will get you a lot less in exchange rate as they don't know what the rate will be when they deposit it. They will give about 1.10 when the exchange rate is 1.23 in my opinion. This is based on over 30 years of Canadian trips.Better at a bank or credit card.........
3959425,Ogoki,2015-06-12 08:31:00,291,My bank here in Ohio ( a large bank too) quoted me 15%. I checked with some others here and nothing higher . Will exchange after we cross into Ontario .
