It holds smallies and yellow perch as well as muskies. Try the first bay on the left after entering outlet bay. Sawmill bay holds fish. There are some humps out in front of an old lodge(forgot the name but not the grumpy owner) in the area of North Country Lodge(excellent owners those Lecots) that were a sure thing in the evening. We had luck with green and chartruse with white grub bodies tipped with minnows. We were there in early july however."

3941121,SpoonieLuv,2015-06-06 12:00:00,16,"I've fished Canyon for 40 yrs and walleye can be caught all day long, just have to move and find them. Don't be afraid to fish shallow, don't let sunny conditions deter you either. I have a few spots that are only good with high sun??? lol Obviously with 'eyes the best times are morning/evening but they can be caught all day. Daytime spots that can be good would be the various beaver house/food plots, you can run-n-gun these spending about 15 min at each one if you dont catch anything move on. A bonus on the beaver houses are the smallies you will catch also. Slip bob9bers work the best for not getting hung up all the time on the food plots. I've dived around most of these houses and the food plots extend alot further out than most people would think so start out and work in. Your lodge will have a map of the main lake humps etc.. and should be able to mark the go to spots. Good luck."
