3961609,Bluebomber,2015-06-12 23:18:00,29,Yeah I hear ya... I don't get why there wouldn't be muskies throughout the whole system? Thought they like rocks and weeds... Down in Vaughn there are some pretty big weed beds... Idk just always wondered why you don't see one chomping on eye every once in awhile.
3962169,skindzier,2015-06-13 09:59:00,137,"From what I've heard they are located throughout the lake - just much more common on the east side. The folks at Timberlane have said they hear of a few being caught on the Ear Falls side each year. Once upon a time a camp owner told me that there was a fishable population within an hour of Ear Falls by boat. Didn't end up staying there, so don't know where that is..."
3962425,Aspencreek,2015-06-13 11:15:00,2911,"They are all over the lake, had one try and take my son's walleye just outside the mouth to Scout bay a few years ago, and it was BIG. And it was not a Northern because this had Stripes. Not the first time while playing a walleye or smallie that a Musky has added to the excitement."
3962993,prov1800,2015-06-13 16:13:00,5010,"There are muskies in the western section of lac seul as i have caught.most of my fishing is for walleye and hook up with some huge fish at times that end up biting me off.never know what thosecwere.but have done some casting for the huge pike lac seul has to offer and have been lucky a couple of times in getting some muskies.i do fish a spot for walleyes at times when its windy and catch a lot of 12""-20"" muskies.must be s sanctuary or something.but basically when you think of it not a lot of casting going on at the west end.everybody is fushing for walleyes.i can catch bass at will and not a lot of bass fishing going on either.the basins on the west side are much deeper than the east side.i have muskie fished quite a bit on the east side and habitat there is totally diff than thecwest end.i am sure if a guy spent some serious muskie time on the west end end i am sure you would find pockets of them and would imagine there could be some giants there."
3958561,Bluebomber,2015-06-12 00:42:00,29,So I've fished out of mahkwa for almost 20 years (south central) and I've always been told muskies are towards Souix lookout...???Are they only on the east end? Why are they not in the central basin? I would think there is plenty of habitat and food to support muskies? Why are they not in Vaughn? In the last three years I caught a 36in gator off the dock and it looked like it had fresh teeth marks on it... I also caught a 38in gator that had definitely been bit down in Vaughn both were still bleeding.... What bit them.... Muskie or gatorzilla?
3958785,DeBo,2015-06-12 06:28:00,211,Same reason they are only in an isolated area of Rainy? Habitat would be my guess. The even stranger part is There is a population downstream from the dam at Ear Falls on Lac Seul. Bite marks on pike could just as easily be other pike. Cannibalistic behavior in pike isn't uncommon.
3958913,tv4fish,2015-06-12 06:56:00,2694,"And - more than likely - it was/is from other pike - they ARE territorial, ya' know."

3959993,Bluebomber,2015-06-12 12:09:00,29,I would love to catch whatever bit that one down in Vaughn it was like 9in across there's a pic with a tape that shows it... Just can't find it....
3960153,Bill Krejca,2015-06-12 13:20:00,6107,"Perhaps lamprey, not a fish bite. Bill"
3960161,BreezyPoint,2015-06-12 13:22:00,1581,Not 9 inches across. I have caught several mid-30s pike with a large toothy pattern in them.Frank
3961449,Bluebomber,2015-06-12 21:24:00,29,Right... No way the one in Vaughn had to be a pike or Muskie by the tooth pattern. Lamprey bite looks like a hole was bored into the fish... Right?
3961513,ftfarms,2015-06-12 22:03:00,444,"I'm just confused on the whole deal cause the first muskie I ever caught was in 1994 and that was out side of sawmill bay south of earfalls?? But I've haven't caught any more? And that one was 41"" long. I guess I never thought much more about it."
