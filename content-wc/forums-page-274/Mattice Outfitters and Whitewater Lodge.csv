Wondering about early July fishing on Whitewater Lake and the fishing there. This will be a couples trip (my wife and I and another couple)...we are all die hard fishermen and we have done fly-ins before. So any information on the area, and the facilities would be greatly appreciated. I have done 5 fly-ins with KayAir to Birch Lake out of Ear Falls."
