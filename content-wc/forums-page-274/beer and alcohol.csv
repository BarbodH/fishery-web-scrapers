3957473,SinOrSwim,2015-06-11 15:40:00,1528,"We don't keep our receipt. They ask how much we paid. We tell them approx number. That is why those duty calculators have never worked. None of it makes any sense. But, we have 10 to 14 guys and we all bring our own stuff so no way we could bring receipts for all of it. We do make a list and keep it centrally so they know. If you take a lot with you be prepared to be treated rather aggressively."
3957689,Puckfan21,2015-06-11 17:01:00,8,I went last year with no receipt. Seemed our duty was high. We will have a list. Each guy will have a case and probably 2 1.75L plus maybe 20 cigars total

3955369,WIfish,2015-06-11 06:47:00,3,Our group is leaving for our trip to dog lake tomorrow night and each of us are bringing a 1L bottle of liquor with us. the issue is where to buy beer. We will be getting to sault ste marie around 12:30 and continuing driving through the night to the lake.Is there anywhere from sault ste marie to wawa to get beer at that time of the morning?Or what are the limits on beer if each of us are bringing 1L of liquor with us?What is the duty on extra beer?Thanks for the help.I really would like some nice fresh perch filets in beer batter.
3955409,Hawkfan,2015-06-11 07:03:00,237,"It will be much easier to take it with. Someone posted this link in a different thread. Haven't found out how spot on an answer it gives you, but pretty good estimate. http://www.canadiandutycalculator.ca/"
3955497,SinOrSwim,2015-06-11 07:25:00,1528,"If you are not going during normal business hours, I would take it with you. The Beer Stores seem to have very limited hours. For example, I went up on a Monday last year and it was the first Monday of the month which is apparently a holiday. A bunch of the stores were closed for the holiday. I did find a small grocery store that had beer but I know we have run into this when going in the early morning before. So, we take it with us now. Just avoid the potential problem. Plus, cost wise it seems like it is about the same. Cheaper beer here, pay the duty. More expensive beer there.....don't pay the duty."
3955553,Mark R,2015-06-11 07:34:00,1538,we have a 1.75 liter of rum and 6 cases of beer which we paid $18.00 for in US . Our duty was $48.00 or $42.00 my buddy paid it. In any event duty was $7.00 or $8.00 a case. Good Luck
3955561,Lovetofish,2015-06-11 07:35:00,458,Bring it with you. Keep your beer receipt and pay the duty on your beer.
3955977,pwbmlr,2015-06-11 09:20:00,37,Stop at the duty free at the boarder. I am pretty sure that one is open 24hrs. That way you will have the reciept handy when you cross the boarder. Not a big deal if you are over. If the agent wants to charge you the duty it will take you 5 mins to run in and pay. It will be much cheaper to buy the beer in the us and pay duty than buy it at the Beer Store. I think the Duty is like $8 a case for the beer. Most of the time that duty store has bud or miller for like $17 a case. I stopped at the Beer Store last year to look around. A case of Bud Lite was $48.
3956225,johnboat,2015-06-11 10:11:00,2014,"Bring it up with you. If you are only 1 case over, my guess is they will wave you through any way. Although some of the Canadian is pretty good too!"
3956241,Puckfan21,2015-06-11 10:19:00,8,Keeping your receipt is a big deal isn't it? Not have a receipt last year might explain why the duty fee was so expensive?
3957193,Jatar,2015-06-11 14:24:00,169,Where do you get 6 cases and a handle at for $18.00 ? I'll rent a truck - LOL
3957257,Mark R,2015-06-11 14:36:00,1538,slow down there my friend the beer was $18.00 a case not $18.00 for 6 cases and a 1.75 not even the newest custom agent would believe that. BTW we have never shown the receipt on the prices we paid.
