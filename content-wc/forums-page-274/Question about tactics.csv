I would hit spots that I was familiar with on lakes that I have been fishing for 10+ years, but instead of striking out completely or catching great fish, we were catching all small fish. When I say small, I mean small enough for bait. This happened at probably three spots that, in the past, produced great numbers and eater size fish. My question is, what do you do if you find yourself in the midst of a bunch of small fish? Where are their larger brethern? Deeper? BTW, I was in anywhere from 8-12 feet and we are talking mid June in the English River System."

We were dragging bottom bouncers in perfect structure in 8-16' of water ... catching tons and tons of cigars as I call them. We found two things that worked. 1 - keep covering water looking for better structure ... it held bigger fish. 2 - Like you said, we went a bit deeper. That worked to."
3952753,tv4fish,2015-06-10 07:24:00,2694,I certainly WOULD move to 1) deeper water or 2) try different spots. If you have a fish finder- I would think you could tell if there were any larger fish mixed in with the small guys?
3952849,westfield,2015-06-10 07:40:00,179,I would bet the bigger fish are still down there but the little ones are getting to the bate first. Try switching to a larger cranks or bait. That lake must of had a good spawn to have all the little ones.

If you pull up to a spot and the first 5 or 6 fish are ""cigar"" walleyes, move immediately because more than likely that is all that is there. On the other hand, if your first few fish are solid, work that area thouroughly. I have tried moving deeper on the same spots but on our section of the English river you usually end up getting the same sized fish or nothing at all.My biggest tip would be to play the wind. Spots with the wind blowing in always seem to hold the bigger fish than calm spots or spots protected from the wind. I have also noticed that a spot in the morning that is calm in the morning or on one day and giving up only small fish will start giving up much bigger ones if you return later in the day or another day if the wind starts pounding the same spot. I have seem this over and over again. Not sure if the big ones are there the whole time and only get active when the wind blows warmer water or food in or if the fish simply are not there until the spot gets the right wind and then they move in but have experienced this enough times to be able to call it a ""pattern"". Days when there is no wind and glass calm water have always been the toughest to find quality fish.good luck."
3952937,tv4fish,2015-06-10 07:49:00,2694,"ripnlips: Very good post - We have experienced the same thing, time after time. If the wind is not blowing in on one of our spots that has always produced fish and we don't get bitten after about 10 minutes, we WILL go to a different spot. If the wind then comes up - we will go back to that spot and catch fish again. The point is - the wind IS a key factor."
