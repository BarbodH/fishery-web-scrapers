3941185,Nimitz,2015-06-06 12:28:00,20,Just returned from another week at Trout River Lodge. Bill and Laura did a great job hosting us as they always do. The fishing was up and down. We had two fronts move through and the winds were shifting from day to day. We had good luck in Bruce Lake later in the week and some luck in the small coves around the park. The Northern bite was strong in some unexpected coves. My advice would be to forget what has worked in the past and really pay attention to the winds. Overall it was a learning week even for a group that has spent a lot of time on the water in Pakwash. Minnows seemed to work the best. I usually use leaches exclusively but this year they were not as effective. We had good success with the slow death system. We trolled quite a bit and also jigged a lot. Good luck and have fun!
3943337,Plotman,2015-06-07 10:23:00,394,Headed to trout river lodge on June 18th for the first time after several recommendations. One of which just got back and also spoke of terrible weather and worst fishing ever only due to the extreme weather. Any hotel suggestions around international falls as it is a 14hr trip for us from Iowa and prefer not to do it in one shot?
3943625,Nimitz,2015-06-07 12:36:00,20,We drive straight through from Central Iowa. One of our group occasionally spends Thursday night at the Black Bear Casino. They do this because their are few hotels North of there that are easy to park a boat at. Also they can kill time at the casino on Friday morning by having breakfast and playing slots. Trout River Lodge has a strict 7:00 p.m. check in time so don't be early. Also the IGA in Dryden has closed so you will need to get groceries at the Safeway. I would also recommend 4 Seasons bait shop in Ear Falls. They are really good. The minnows sold at Trout River Lodge are excellent.
3943785,Bstar,2015-06-07 15:03:00,564,"Try the Hilltop Motel. $100/night for a double room. Clean rooms, Mom and pop type business. You better get a reservation soon as the motels are pretty full this time of year. You can also do search on this site for motels in IFalls. Good luck on your trip."
3945425,Plotman,2015-06-08 06:01:00,394,"Hilltop looks great but, will only accept small pets which, our 70lb Lab rules out. We are now trying to find a good hotel with decent size parking lot that accepts ""large"" dogs. Trout river,s pet policy is one of the reasons we chose their lodge as Laura welcomed pets as long as we were responsible owners."
3945449,Bstar,2015-06-08 06:10:00,564,I understand. I have 2 Labs myself. You might want to check the Super 8 in Fort France's. A lot of them will accept pets.
3949577,vaquero01,2015-06-09 09:49:00,101,"Try La Place. We stay there every year and we have a Lab. Right on the shore of Rainy in Ft Frances. Decent restaurant, too."
