515371,manitobawalleye,2001-10-31 21:15:00,885,"are you talking about the manigatogan river or manigatogan lake.all pavement to the river. it also gets some of the greenback run but i have not fished it recently...10 years ago got a 29.5 shore fishing casting countdown rapala below the falls... one person i know caught alot of fish right thru july last year at the mouth of lake winnipeg trolling cranks in front of the beach... the wardens apparently enforce the same regs as pinefalls because people fish both the lake and the river.... instead of releasing all fish over 15"".... is a 20 mile ride from pinefalls and a option in rough weather... a decent ramp in town behind the hotel... but the river is mostly 8'-10' from what i have been told with a few rocks here and there...."
515369,VMS,2001-11-01 11:00:00,1103,"How is the gravel road going in? Years ago, the group I go with used to go to Manigotogan but stopped due to the road in. They recall the road being like a stretch of granite for the entire trip in...short, but long in terms of time. the could not travel more than 10 miles an hour (if I recall correctly)SteveA dry line catches no fish."
515370,chrism,2001-11-02 07:52:00,429,"The granite road you are referring to is the one to Caribou(quesnell) lake, which is boat accesible to Manigotogan lake. There is a lodge and campground on Caribou lake. The road is the same over the years - rough and rocky! Fishing here is OK, I have been a half dozen times. It is a typical shield lake. If you look at the Master angler awards, there have been a few big ones caught in these lakes over the years.If you are talking Greenbacks, then you must be referring to the Manigotogan river where it empties into Lake Winnipeg (I'm guessing 30ish miles away from Manigotogan lake) - I have never fished there, but have heard essentially what MW's posts echo. It should be good in the fall, just like the other rivers. I have heard that there are a few reefs to watch out for.Hope this helps!cm"
515372,Glenn,2001-11-02 08:19:00,17,"I was qurious as to what beach you were refering to at the mouth of the Winnipeg? What size of fish come out of lake Winnipeg in the summer and fall. Their must be other good fishing spots in addition to Traverse bay in the fall. Has anyone had good luck in other areas of the lake for big fish?Thanks,"
