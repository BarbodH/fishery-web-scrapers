I forgot how many hours of Cat I there was, I think it was 12 hours? Pretty generic topics.I was going to try get my CME stipend approved for reimbursement by my senior medical director, but the brochure was just too plastered with fishing details, with sidenotes on CME.Darned, if that brochure was the other way around, I think I would have gone."
