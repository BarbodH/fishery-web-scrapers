515352,Guest,2001-10-28 14:16:00,0,It can be 85f or 25f. I find this time of the year to be hard for walleye sometimes.......but trout are a different story. Leave your options open if we have a late ice out.
515353,Guest,2001-10-28 17:13:00,0,Thanks for the response...the lake we are going to has Brook trout in a feeder lake. With this advise in mind I'll take my fly rod.
515354,Xplorer,2001-10-29 14:47:00,244,"TLR, As stated before weather can be very unpredictable. Pack for snow and sun. For brookies you may want to consider just taking an ultralight spinning rod, we've caught most of our brookies on one bait, a #1 plain silver Mepps aglia. My biggest stream brookie up there (19.5"") was caught on a small rapala tho. If you can, try and find current areas for eye's and gators. We do well near inlets and outlets to lakes, fishing them like a river on the current breaks. If there is a navigable river into/out of the lake try that also, we've had good luck early in the year in that area by drifting jig/minnows back into holes. Good luck, you should enjoy it. Xplorer"
515355,Guest,2001-10-30 05:17:00,0,What lake are you fishing out of Armstrong? What outfitter? Have you fished out of Armstrong before?Thanks for any info!!!!
515356,Guest,2001-10-31 03:11:00,0,"I will be fishing on Weese Lake with Mattice Lake OF. I have never fished out of Armstrong, but flew out of Nakina this last May. I used Timberidge Outfitters and fished on Crayon Lake. The cabin was below par but the fishing was fantastic."
