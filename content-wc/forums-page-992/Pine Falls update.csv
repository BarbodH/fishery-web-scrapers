515414,Guest,2001-11-12 18:19:00,0,Would appreciate any reports or news on how the fishing has been at Pine Falls the last few days as I am considering making a run towardthe end of the week if the weather holds.Are the greenbacks typicallyfound in the river more than in the bay this late in the fall or is it a 50/50 deal on their location.Thanks in advance.

Fishing was slow (For Pine Falls, many of us have been spoiled over the past several years)but fish were being caught. Our boat's largest was 26"" but saw several larger fish caught. Our information was there had been a good jig bite from about 3:00pm to dark. However, that wasn't the case over the weekeend and most fish were caught cranking.Good Luck, the weather is great!"
515417,Guest,2001-11-14 12:02:00,0,Fished Traverse Bay on Saturday and we did quite good jigging salted minnows out on the North shore just past the river mouth. Actually the first real encouraging sign this year as I have been out to Pine Falls 10 times this fall and nothing has remotely resembled the Pine Falls of the past.Most quality fish were caught in 20-25 feet of water.First time this year I have seen Traverse Bay like glass!Tried trolling cranks later on but only managed to catch 1 near the Robinson Rock pile.

I would like to tell you that we cought some walleyes in the river jigging a live chub on gold/ pink. If you are familiar with the ""car wreck"" try there first thing in the morning. The Star Reef is a good bet midday. Cranking on the east side along the flats with a pearl rapala sometimes gets them going.Last weekend was the best Pine Falls fishing I had this season (not for big ones, but nice ones)Watch how the boats go toward the dam if you don't know and try in that direction near the small islands in the middle of the river with jigs. The water has to get colder yet. Looks like we will be taking the boat to Pine falls when our friends will be walking out at first ice."
