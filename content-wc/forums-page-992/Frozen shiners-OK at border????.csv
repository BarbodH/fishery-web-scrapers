515173,Chad,2001-10-08 11:14:00,3523,Salted or frozen are fine.You may be better off buying them up there and save the hastle. Boris in Winnipeg's Pro Am Tackle has the best bait around.
515174,pondigger,2001-10-08 20:48:00,31,I don't think they're legal. Last summer I had to wait a half hour while my nieghbor one car back had to walk his frozen smelt back to America. I'd think shiners would be the same. That was in 2000 and I don't think the law has changed. I could be wrong though. Further investigation required.Bob

Under the heading of 'Import of bait' It says.."" It is illegal to bring live fish,crayfish or salamanders into Ontario for use as bait. It is illegal to bring live leeches into Ontario for use as bait, unless you are the holder of a commercial bait license."" Both references are to LIVE bait and no mention of dead or frozen bait is made."

515177,Guest,2001-10-30 09:21:00,0,"I take salted minnows into Ontario every year. Yes, it's legal. Suggest using salted vs. frozen as the salted are much tougher and your bait will stay on the [jig] hook much better. You should be able to purchase a 1/2 gallon for about 7 or 8 bucks, at least thats what I pay for 'em. Good luck.Jawjerker"
