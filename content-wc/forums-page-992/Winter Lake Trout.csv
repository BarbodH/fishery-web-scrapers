515406,Guest,2001-11-12 07:10:00,0,Can anyone out there help me with any suggestions or place where some good winter lake trout can be found in Ontario?
515407,Guest,2001-11-12 08:49:00,0,"Depends on where you are and how far you want to travel. If NW Ontario is a possibility and I don't think you can do better than the Nestor Falls area. Crow (Kakagi) lake is real good as is Whitefish Bay on LOTW. They are about 75 miles from Int. Falls,MN so you can figue your time. Be sure to check the regulations. Good Luck"
