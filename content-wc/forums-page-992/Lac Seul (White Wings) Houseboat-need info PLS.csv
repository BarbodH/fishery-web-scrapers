Number one take alot of time with your group and plan your menu carefully! Once you leave the docks you are on your own for the week. Check your gear and make sure you get a good list put together well ahead of time. Remember that on Lac Suel if you keep a fish you have to kill it. The best way to keep the fish fresh is to bring along a cooler that will hold a bag of ice and your catch. The resort has ice there just remember a bag a day per boat plus what you might need for more serious needs. The houseboats have a good size freezer on them so you will have plenty of room. I guess you can drink the water out of the tap but we brought bottled water pop and several boxes of our favorite flavor. If you need 2-cycle oil make sure you have plenty along. I would recomend at least a gallon more than you think you might need. Make sure you take along a couple of extention cords (50ft) this way you can move the generator away from the houseboat and have alittle quite. The only other thing that comes to mind is bring along a box fan or two,you just might sleep alot better. Now the important stuff. We fished in Broad and Sunlight lakes alot when we were there but in august you will probably have better luck out in the main lake. Get a good map and familerize yourself with the area its big. The fishing around most of the islands is good but we had our best luck back towards the resort along the small sand banks and the islands around them. We took along crawlers this year again and we used minnows for the first time, it didn't make much difference on the number of fish which we caught. It also didn't matter if the minnows were dead or alive. We caught several walleyes over eight pounds and they are all still there. We have fished that area for several years and the size and numbers have continued to get better. I hope fishing will be as good for you as it has been for us. Can't wait for next summer to get back there again.If I can answer any questions you might have that the novel I wrote above didn't answer write me at [email protected] GOOD FISHING P.S. THERE IS A ROCK IN THE RIVER GOING UP TO BROAD AND SUNLIGHT WHERE THE RIVER MAKES A RIGHT TURN AND THEN TURNS BACK TO THE LEFT MAKE SURE YOU ASK BOBBIE ABOUT THAT ROCKS LOCATION. IT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE FOR OUR GROUP. THEY REMEMBERED TO TELL US ABOUT IT WHEN WE WERE LEAVING. SAID THEY MIGHT MARK IT."
