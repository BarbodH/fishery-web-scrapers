515424,darcyfish,2001-11-15 15:22:00,15,"No ice roads down that far but you can get there by sled,there is usually a trail that comes threw the back area mainly due to the currents around the mouth areas of the bay,and are you leaving out of S.N. to go there?If you have any questions I shpould be able to help out.D'arcy"
