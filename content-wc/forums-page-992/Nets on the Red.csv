515322,curt quesnell,2001-10-31 04:56:00,804,i get a kick out the phrase they use in a situation like this..nets AND overfishing. its overfishing WITH nets. period.curt quesnell
515324,Backwater Eddy,2001-10-31 18:12:00,3871,"Garrison, what, get real! How are gar going to get in that system and up to the lower Red? Gar don't do well in cold water either, and were would the Gar come from anyway, Texas?As for the nets, they are depleting that Big lake just as they do all commercially fished lakes when netting practices over reach the potential for the system to rebound. Read the creel reports on the Bay of Quinte and see what happened there, it will happen on the Winnipeg system too in a very short time. Backwater Eddy......><, ,>"
515325,Hawgeye,2001-11-01 07:41:00,1355,"I have to agree with B.E. on this one. I am no fish biologist but do spend a lot of time reading and if there is any rough fish in the Missouri, Devils Lake or waters in between, that are not already in the Lake Winnipeg system, I would highly question it. Also the arguement from the fear of brackish water from Devils lake getting into the system seems to be rediculous. Devils Lake is one of the best fisheries in North America and as for the water, since it is high water, it is much more dilluted as well. Only high water times would introduce any water into the system anyway. Just thoughts...."
515326,Guest,2001-11-01 11:43:00,0,"I've fished a lot on DL, Sakakawea and Oahe on the Missouri, as well as the Red and Winnipeg, and I'm not sure which have more ""undesirable"" species of fish, but I'd guess the Red has as many or more. As far as gar, I know they exist in down river reservoirs such as Lake Francis Case, but I've never seen one in Sakakawea.The issue of Garrison or Devils Lake water in the Red is far more of a political issue than a biological issue. In the past, the arguement made against Garrison was Manitoba didn't want smelt in the system. They are in there now, and they didn't come from Garrison.As always, these issues need to be decided with a balance of flood control, economic impact, and environmental issues all considered, not scare tactics."
515328,Guest,2001-11-01 11:46:00,0,"I find it funny that this topic is still a hot one. I posted a message last month saying that having to use barbless hooks where nets are legal was a ""JOKE"" and boy did that get some people excited. I agree it is ""Over fishing WITH nets"" also. And Tread who buy's fish? If your buying fish than you need to take up a new sport (period) I just think it is funny to see the people who like to fish the ""REAL"" way (pole and hook) have a hard time with nets. And the people who don't know how to fish (nets) don't like the people that do know giving advise. Funny stuff boyz. By the way I am a pole person. If I had to stand on a ladder to make a basket than I don't think I would play basketball. How about you netters?? I love to stir the pot.Dingo"
515327,Backwater Eddy,2001-11-02 04:03:00,3871,"Tom has a great point.The ecological impact is significant in comparison to any unintended biological disbursement concerns. If larger amounts of water if sent through the Sheyeene River from Devils Lake it most likely will damage the characteristics of the river bed and the river will get blown out even further. This is the main concern many share concerning further releases into this system. Bank erosion, undercut banks, silt deposited on prime spawning habitat, all this and more are big issues to consider.Backwater Eddy......><, ,>"
515329,Guest,2001-11-05 11:19:00,0,"I, too, have been experiencing a severe down-turn in numbers of walleye caught at Pine Falls and the Red river at Selkirk. As well I have seen the nets strung out along the mouth of the River at Pine Falls. The shortage may or may not be because of the nets. However, it is time that everyone sits up and takes notice of the fact that Nature cannot sustain the type of harvesting that goes on wherever commercial fishing takes place. Do the words Atlantic Cod, Pacific Salmon, Atlantic Lobster, Pacific and Atlantic Whales, raise any warning Flags? And what is not taken into account by many are the untold tons of ""undesirable species"" that are dragged up by some methods only to be discarded. The only fish sold should be that which is commercially raised. Sport fishing supplies infinitely more jobs for people than commercial fishing ever will."
515330,Walleye Wizard,2001-11-14 15:07:00,9,I think all nets had to be out Oct 31 for commercfial fishing. BUT for substanance fishing they can be in.......The square hooks kill more walleye than round ones!Paul
515313,Guest,2001-10-23 20:56:00,0,I fished at Selkirk this past week and had slower fishing then am used to but talked to some guys who said there were six gill nets each about a mile long right in the mouth of the river is this where the greenbacks are ending up if so has this been going on for years or is this something new to worry about
515314,Guest,2001-10-25 08:03:00,0,"Old news. Everytime someone cant catch a walleye there they blame the nets. If it bothers people so much, lobby the politicians in the area to commision a study to re evaluate the problem, or practice as the case may be. Then, the next time you buy a walleye from the grocery store or fish market, slap yourself in the face. Where do you think those fish are comming from? But then, where are any of the fish comimg from? They may not be the nets near your favorite fishing hole, but they are from the nets in someone elses fishing hole. with proper management, the commercial fisherman, and sport anglers can get along. Become pro active, get educated on the whole issue, or move on."
515315,Backwater Eddy,2001-10-25 08:25:00,3871,"Who buys fish to eat, heck I don't!Many of them fish are exported that get gilled from the lake. The new trend is get even bigger fish then before because they weigh in better on over seas market scales.This sounds like a export problem as well as a local one to me? Why ruin a local recourse by exporting the local resources major asset while subsequently diminishing potential economic gains for the whole local economy? This appears very foolish to me."
515316,Hawgeye,2001-10-25 10:13:00,1355,"When I was fishing at Pine Falls, I had a local tell me that they switched from 3"" gill nets to 4"" gill nets. This would support your statements about larger fish. I am considering changing my fall fishing trips to a different fishery unless the reports start to change back to the 'good ole days' type fishing there. I do know this is the first time in 12 years that the motel I have stayed at actually has open rooms. It used to be full all the time ...reservation had to be made a year in advance.I don't buy walleye ever either, I will never, even if I quit fishing because that means I am supporting commercial harvest. I feel that the kind of money I spend on sport fishing, maybe I deserve a little ""delicacy"" over people that store buy them...just my thoughts."
515317,Guest,2001-10-26 07:32:00,0,"Hawgeye, you have raised some very good points. I too have for the first time-ever (15 years +) seen the 'Vacancy' sign up at the local hotel, not only in Selkirk but in Pine Falls as well. Maybe the local business community(s) will take an active role in this issue. Nothing speaks like a $$, especially in non-domestic currency.As for net size changes you mention, perhaps our friend nroAtkins is able share with us the 'chapter and verse' on this issue, especially when in comes to the Pine Falls area. In the past, he has shared with us the beefs/bouquets facing First Nations, commercial fisherman and guys/girls who just love to fish.Want to hear from you !"
515318,Guest,2001-10-26 09:49:00,0,Hawgeye the reason there is vacancy in the Pine Falls is that a local hotel has just finished expanded to almost double its size and 1 smaller Motel has just opened also.
515319,Hawgeye,2001-10-26 10:09:00,1355,"I know that but I also know of several people that have cancelled their reservations because of slow fishing. I am happy about the addition, I just hope the fishing gets better!"

515321,Backwater Eddy,2001-10-28 06:29:00,3871,"Interesting reading, especially the past creel survey reports on the system.The red flags were there to see!BE...........><,,>"
515323,Guest,2001-10-28 17:51:00,0,"In response to ""sickit""'s post, yes there is likely a good reason to go from 3"" to 4"", and that is likely he/she is getting too much rough fish such as white bass, sucker, and other such fish. Switching from 3"" to 4"" will see more larger walleye caught, however if a commercial fisherman wanted to catch even more, he or she would go with 4 3/4"" to 5 1/2"" to really catch those greenbacks. Seems like a lot of finger pointing at commercial fishermen, when, as I have pointed out in previous posts, this lake has been commercially fished long before the greenback made it's international appearance on the fishing front. Keep in mind the potential damage to this ecosystem when and if Garrison happens, and those of you from the south start to catch species such as gar and god knows what from the southern watersheds. I enjoy fishing as much as the next guy, however am happy to be out even on those slower days-any bad day fishing is better than a good day of work."
