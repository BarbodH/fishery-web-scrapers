I've been out on that lake and go my ........ kicked many of times. As for people down south they have given people like me tons of information about fishing teckniques, equipment, ect. that I cherish every time I go out. There is no lack of respect on my part, absolutally not Basically the bite turned on mid last week and progessivly got better. From what I've been hearing the bite is getting progressivly getting better to this day. I'm going out this weekend and will post whats going on, if the bite sucks i'll say so. I use this message board just as much as the next guy for useful information and cherish my days off to much to waste them on false information that someone may or may not have made up...... My suggestion is check the weather on the Environment Canada web site, pick your days carefully and fish November not alot of pressure on the lake. http://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca Click on Lake Winnipeg South it is the most accurate weather ( if there is such a thing ) that I have found."
515291,Guest,2001-10-26 07:15:00,0,"Greenback, I like to hear your stories. I hope to read your posts on this upcoming weekends fishing activity. Pending your success and of course the weather, maybe I will take another run up in the next couple of weeks. Driving up from Winnipeg gives me another chance to get on the water."
515292,Guest,2001-10-30 09:17:00,0,"I was on the lake the same week Thur, Fri, and Sat and we also had our best luck on Friday. I was qurious as to which rock pile you were on, I think I was trolling in the same area. email me and we will compare stories. [email protected]Thanks,"
515280,Guest,2001-10-22 05:28:00,0,"A friend just returned- said they did ok, especially considering the strong winds, which caused them to choose jigging from an anchored position as the presentation.Any other reports? I'm considering a run up in a week."
515281,Hawgeye,2001-10-22 07:00:00,1355,"If OK is catching 4-5 fish per person each day, then that is about right. I am used to catching about 25-30 fish a day and them being anywhere from 3-12 pounds and on occasion bigger than that. We were up from Thursday through Saturday and battled the 4 footers in the bay and only picked up a couple during the 3 days. Sunday we went to Selkirk and had a lot more action yet that was more on saugers. Saw a few more fish caught there too.I have heard some reports from local netters up there that the fish are 30-40 miles out yet. Water temp is at about 50 degrees. I have cancelled any plans for future trips until I hear about the greenbacks are in from a reliable source because they are not in yet.There are a few fisherman that we talked to that hit a few ""pods"" of fish but it was somewhat still limited. Fishing is not what it has been and is not looking real encouraging yet. I would make some more phone calls before going...good luck and looking forward to any other reports on the ""greenbacks""."
515282,Guest,2001-10-22 09:38:00,0,"They anchored just outside the river on a point, and caught fish from 6-16 feet, the best being a 10 & 11.5. Thursday was best, with about 30 fish caught.Another friend said he battled the big waves trolling for several days and caught about 15 on their best day. He also said there seems to be more nets than last year, restricting areas that could be trolled significantly."
515283,Guest,2001-10-22 10:13:00,0,"A few of my buddies spent Wed - Friday last week at Pine Falls. Described fishing as 'terrible'. Whats terrible... Wednesday , three guys caught 11 fish, the largest being 23"", Thursday they got blown off the bay with the small craft warning, after catching two out in the bay. I joined them on Friday and we caught 5 fish in the river north of Manitou rapids, nothing big. Also, we cleaned the fish later in the PM, all stomachs were empty, except for one fish that had a shiner in it.I have fished at Pine Falls for close to 15 years, and catching 15 -20 fish each guy per day is not uncommon, in fact its an expectation. Something significant has changed with this fishery and I cannot attribute it all on the water temp. being higher than in previous years. I suspect its got to do with the commercial harvest and the reported harvest numbers for the south basis in the next while will bear out that suspicion.Many of the fisherman I spoke with are scratching their collective brows' looking for an answer(s). I would be happy to hear from others on this."
515284,Hawgeye,2001-10-22 10:55:00,1355,"I too have been fishing several weekends every fall for about 12 years now and this year is by far the worst that I have ever seen it. It seems to be getting progressively worse with 95'-97' being the best. We probably caught at most 10 fish per day in my boat this last time up. We trolled cranks in the bay but got beat up enough to go fish the river and catch a few smaller fish. I trolled Traverse Bay and did not feel there were any more nets than in the past. The water levels seem the same as they have been every year so I really don't think that is it either. I do know that the flow out of the dam was non-existent last weekend. I too am scratching my head wondering ""what is happening?"" Is this year just a fluke or is this fishing population changing it's fall migration. The lake is too big to be ""netted out"" but it must be having an affect."
515285,Butch,2001-10-22 11:25:00,115,I have lived in Manitoba for many years and have enjoyed the fall run at Pine falls for the last 20 years. I agree with the earlier post that indicates it is more than the water temp. Last year and previous years the greenbacks started showing up in Traverse Bay as early as Aug. The one thing I have noticed this year is lack of bait fish marked in the river and out in the bay. In years past you would see plenty of bait fish (tulibee or shiners I assumed) on the locator but this yeare I have noticed none. We have heard that rainbow smelt are now in the lake so I wonder if the walleye have switched to them as a forage base and have the smelt had a detramental effect on the shiner and tulibee populations. Just my thoughts. I would be interested on yours and perhaps one of our biologists here at the province will have an informed comment re the above.tight lines.
515286,Guest,2001-10-23 11:10:00,0,"I have lived in Pine Falls all my life and this year the bite is defenitally later last year, last year being one of the best i can remember. Last years bite started about Sept 15-18 & was unreal till about mid Oct. died off for about a week and turned back on till freeze up.. This year the fish have only moved into the mouth of travers bay in real numbers starting about mid last week. Talking to some of the locals who know commercial fisherman said there harvest defenitaly started later also, real numbers of fish only reaching Manigotogan about 2 weeks ago. Having said that last week I fished Wed, Thur, Fri. The bite was hot from about 9 till 11:30 with huge fish being caught all 3 days, real decent numbers on friday in fact friday was the best day fishing I have ever had in my life. 7 fish over 28"" 2 over 30 one pushing the 13.5 -- 14 lb mark. This was all in travers bay on an anchor jigging one of the many submerged rock piles. 12 - 13 feet. Saturday went on the lake and got blown off by about 10:30 one 27 and 1 24 in about 45 min.My guess is river will turn on this week and will be hot till freeze up so don't put your boat away yet November is always one of my favorite times to fish. Put a heater in your boat and givver..To sum up....Jigging over cranking this year absolutally...Is this years bite later than last absolutally... As for commercial fisherman Being an anlgler I do not approve of commercial fishing in any lake, but I do know that commercial fisherman in lake Winnipeg, Lake Manitoba and Lake Winnipegosis stock the lakes with Millions and Millions of fingerlings each year.Is the fish population at risk in the 230 mile long, re-stocked, Lake Winnipeg?????I Don't think soWill next years bite be earlier? Guess it all depends on the all the conditions that affect fishing everywhere. If fishing was always easy it would not be any fun, or would it?All I know is you can't fish a memory, memories are just that...."
515287,Guest,2001-10-23 12:20:00,0,Hey Greenback:Why aren't you offering a guide service for guys like us. I guess some of us need to learn how to fish. Your message sounds like I was fishing a different lake altogether.You the man !
515288,Guest,2001-10-23 16:07:00,0,"Been to Pine Falls 8 times in the past month and have yet to see any resemblance to conditions that we have seen in the past 3 years.Averaged about 8-10 fish for two people on each outing. Majority of these caught in the river. The lake bite has been almost non existant this year and cranking Traverse Bay has been useless.Boat is still ""ready to go"" if things get hopping in the next little while but I won't hold my breath."
515289,Guest,2001-10-24 06:32:00,0,"it's good to see that folks like ""greenback"" see the big picture and choose to share it with others. Commercial fishing provides a major economic base for Manitoba. Harvest of lake Winnipeg has been going on since the early 1900's, and the lake has survived. Angling success is likely the result of a change in forage fish choice for walleye (rainbow smelt) which has caused the greenback to stay out in open water longer. Just my thoughts, as I am only a fish cop not a biologist. For a more informed opinion, one should contact fisheries branch in Winnipeg at (204) 945-6640"
