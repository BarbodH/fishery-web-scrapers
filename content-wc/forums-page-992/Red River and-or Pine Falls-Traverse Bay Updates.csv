Our boat only caught 3 fish, 21"", 23' and 28"".Went to the Red River yesterday and it was even slower than Pine Falls, only saw three little saugers caught.Time to fog the motor and clean out the fish house!"

At 3:30 PM we finally caught a couple of fish, albeit two were small saugers. North on the river towards the delta is where we caught a couple of eyes - 17"" and 22"", on rattling jigs/shiners.Oh well, we go to see a great sunset at the end of the day !"
