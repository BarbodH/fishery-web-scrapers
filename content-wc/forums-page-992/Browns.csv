Its on Clearwater west but you can also sled into White Otter which has eye's in it. I think that you might be close to Sanford Lake also, which gives up some big lakers (saw a picture of a 40 lb'er in the local paper a couple of years ago)We fish the Atikokan area, alot of smaller lakes that also have trout. There is a bait shop just off of Hwy 17 as you go into Atikokan, they have bait,maps and license's and info. All I've ever had to use to catch fish was a 1/2 oz northland bucktail and a salted shiner. White, glow and yellow have been most consistent. Also used airplane jigs, sonars and beetle's. They fight like he** in winter, you'll have a blast!! Xplorer"
515437,Guest,2001-11-21 18:21:00,0,Thank you explorer for the info. As far as winter fishing go's it sounds great. We will be booking for this March. Can anyone out there tell me about the spring & summer fishing for lk. trout & walleye? I have talked to several people about White Otter lake & they tell me that the walleye fishing is incredable early. Can you tell me anything about this? We are looking for a year round place that we can depend on twelve 12 months a year. I am looking for good & bad comments.
515438,Fitch,2001-11-21 21:49:00,75,They have good spring lake trout also but walleye on the White otter doesn't start till June 15th I believe. There are a lot of other little lakes to fish plus Barry also has outpost you can go to so that should keep things interesting. He just fished up his deer hunts and also can supply you with bear and moose if you like. There are a lot of lakes to cover in the area so you won't have to worry about getting bored!!! It is really worth a e mail or phone call to have them tell you whats what. :-)
