We had heard that 28 to 32 inch walleye were common this time of year. However after 4 days of fishing and our largest walleye being only 16 inches we were dismayed. We had all the equipment, boat, maps, hot spots located from friends who had been their just 2 weeks earlier, and all the enthusiasm necessary to catch fish. How disappointing. Would like to return yet this year if the fish take off. Has anyone out their a report from recent days? We did not catch many fish during these four days, did others find the same expeirance? If so let me know I might regain some cofidence in our fishing abilities. Your time and honesty is greatly appreciated.Engineer-1"

I managed 2 27"" fish this year but only a smattering of fish. It is not right there this year and I am not sure why. I may not go back again until I hear of HOT fishing."

When we went back (just after the big snow-storm around Grand Forks) we found the water temp had dropped about 10 degrees - probably about overnight - and the fish had lockjaw. So, we did very poorly, but, hey, that's fishing. We still had a good time - better than watching G.B wack the Vikes! If it was the change in water temp that knocked them down, I'd expect they'd be going again this weekend. Wish I could go back - good luck, keep us posted."

We trolled ""deep little rippers"", our biggest was 11lbs.6oz We had some 4-7 pounders as well. Only 3 boats on the entire lake. All of the big fish came in about an hour and a half. The second day was very very slow. We marked lots of fish near the bullseye but had no success except for a 19lb catfish. Wished I had time to go again."

Trolled for 4hrs and jigged the rest. All were caught trolling,16-18ft. Not what I expected.Water temp was 39f.There were a few more boats out than I expected, especially for this time of the year! That's all - boat goes into dry dock tommorrow!chrism"

Lots of sauger at times, heard some stories of nice catches, but over all it sucks, simple as that. Locks were opened up, didn't affect current much, water levels down, way down, and that's north of the locks! I just hope it is not a sign of things to come."
