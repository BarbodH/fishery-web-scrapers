515420,Guest,2001-11-14 10:51:00,0,Are here long wait times to get in and out of Canada since the WTC disaster? I'll be going in February through Sault St. Marie. Thanks for the input.

If you have had any charges be sure to call ahead and fill in the paper work for a pardon. Here is a link to the Canada imigration site where you can contact them for more info.http://canadavisa.com/english.htm
