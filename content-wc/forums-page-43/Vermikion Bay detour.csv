6660786,prov1800,2022-06-01 08:36:00,5010,That or you can drive through water at Buller Creek by this weekend it has really dropped.no cars yet though.but pickups yes.
6661276,FishFry2012,2022-06-03 08:41:00,27,Thanks again for this. The route worked well. No water in site taking this route.
6661282,prov1800,2022-06-03 08:56:00,5010,Peacefull drive and new scenery.Did you see water coming out of the outlet from eagle lake.
6661284,walleyecheek,2022-06-03 08:57:00,2231,Almost mid june and people wearing winter coats ! Strange !
6661286,Eckohlt,2022-06-03 09:06:00,3685,"Yup,it might sting alittle on my daily bath in the lake starting June 13"
6661296,prov1800,2022-06-03 09:26:00,5010,As a cdn in north western ontario its not unusuall to keep the warm stuff close by.We can have snow yet.+2 c this morning.Next few days will be cold over night with mayve 15c during the days so today iam going to start my boiler again and let it run for a few days again.my house is at 60f without any heat on and temp going down.
6661298,prov1800,2022-06-03 09:29:00,5010,Water temps will be a bit cooler where your going but by then should be looking at 55f+.It will wake you up in a hurry.
6661312,Eckohlt,2022-06-03 10:13:00,3685,Just so I don't have to break ice.
6657720,prov1800,2022-05-20 09:44:00,5010,I would think so.tgey are constantly fixing it on daily basis.The rain is not giving it a chance to dry so be nice if we would get some dry days but this week is looking dry.
6659896,Illineye65,2022-05-29 08:47:00,8,"I just returned from the Vermilion Bay Area on Friday. Hwy 17 does NOT have water over it, at the moment. No telling what rain the coming week may do, but cars can get through that area. Hwy 105 is still closed with no anticipation for opening at this time...very bad washout there. If you go up 647 from VB, the Quibell Road is open to light vehicles...not to heavy trucks, though. You can get back to 105 that way. A pickup truck and boat will make it fine...depending, again on rain this coming week. I have never seen water like this up there(over 60 years). Our Indian Lake dock was still under 3-4"" of water when we left.https://511on.ca/"
6659946,prov1800,2022-05-29 13:54:00,5010,Pouring as I write this.Severe thunder storms headed here for non and Teus with quit a bit of rain.Detour has been good with dry weather and will get wet again and get screwed up some.The water over the road on 105 is going down quit a bit and can see pick ups going through soon.
6659998,rbbobo,2022-05-29 17:30:00,10,Can you give an update on Thursday? Will be heading to Gull Rock through Sioux Narrows on Saturday the 4th.
6660004,prov1800,2022-05-29 17:39:00,5010,Monday/Teus will drop a bunch of rain then not to bad.Here's a pic for weather in red lake area.
6660022,Bill Krejca,2022-05-29 19:48:00,6107,"Brother-in-law came up yesterday to Cedar Point Resort on Cedar Lake, I got a short report this afternoon. He did take a short detour heading up from Vermillion Bay, said something about taking the airport road, not too much out of his way. Had 35 mph winds today, more rain, 55 degrees, water temp about 48, , more rain forecast for much the upcoming week. Bill"
6660722,prov1800,2022-06-01 04:58:00,5010,Been nasty Bill.Today some sun and cloud but bit warmer at 15ç.Absolutely no wind as of right now. But showing 45 km winds sometime today.Know some guys at Clarks that were out yesterday and said it was very windy but found some spots out of the wind and ended up catching some some fish.but they gave up at 2.iam sure there out early this taking advantage of the weather.shows 2c this morning.
6660752,Bill Krejca,2022-06-01 07:41:00,6107,"I got text from BIL yesterday, he got whipped around by the wind quite a bit, showed me a pic of the lake from the cabin in the afternoon, think he came in early, looked like mix of rain and maybe fog? I told him to try the spots which were hit by the south wind, maybe a slight warm up in water temp, sometimes just a day of warmer can turn on the fish. Bill"
6660770,N_of_Quibell,2022-06-01 07:55:00,151,"If you're trailering a boat on the Quibell Road detour, make sure your motor is tilted up high enough. Last week I was following a boat whose skeg was helping to level out some of the high spots."

6657370,prov1800,2022-05-19 08:04:00,5010,Not a lot of talk about getting up #105.Thoufht I would bring it up.Anyone travelling to a destination on Hwy 105.Heres the situation.First coming from dryden west there is water over the road nust west off Eagle river.you can take the detour there if you have a car and you will come out on 17 throufh waldhoff.or can go through water but iam thinking line ups are going to be long both ways as the only let few through at a time.In VB you cannot go up hwy 105.You will have to go west one mike and turn up north on blue lake rd a few miles and will see detour sign.this will get you to hwy 609.This route I have to say is pretty bad at times due to transports really pounding it.Carß are not recommended right now. I was on it yesterday with my truck and that's ok but some really bad spots.I would hate to pull a boat through.But yesterday they closed the detour to fix it up.so they might be thinking of this weekend's traffic using the detour.Just letting yoù ģuys know the deal.#609 is pretty good once you get on there and you'll be back on #105 with in 5 miles.
6657374,FishFry2012,2022-05-19 08:33:00,27,Thanks How is Ojibway Dr and then Cascade Rd? Maps takes you on Ojibway Dr from 502 through Eagle River and then onto 17 before the delay on 17 by Eagle River. I wasn't sure if that road was good to travel on and if it would make sense to turn onto Cascade Rd at Eagle River to go around the water. TIA!
6657378,prov1800,2022-05-19 08:41:00,5010,Ojibway through rez is good.Can take back road to Waldhoff and back to 17.
6657386,FishFry2012,2022-05-19 08:48:00,27,"Great, thanks! Hopefully the .5"" of rain projected tonight/tomorrow is as low as possible and doesn't mess the roads too much more this weekend."
6657404,prov1800,2022-05-19 09:49:00,5010,Got quite a bit yesterday so that doesn't help.Who ever takes the detour just take your time.
6657498,Cgillespie,2022-05-19 18:09:00,120,"Headed up on 6/14. I hope 105 is open by then, but it's good to know they've got a detour set up. Driving from Winnipeg airport to Red Lake. I have to leave my house at 2 am to get to Memphis airport, so it's gonna be a long day."
6657506,prov1800,2022-05-19 18:31:00,5010,You 'll be good to go either way by then hooefully.
6657516,Fishin Fun,2022-05-19 19:46:00,218,I've been hoping that someone would post an update about 105 soon. We're going up on 6/11 to Gull Rock so I'm also hoping that 105 is ready to go by then.
6657528,prov1800,2022-05-19 20:32:00,5010,June 11 ways off sure it will get much better by then.If it doesn't the detour is always there and you get to go over the Bailey bridge on 609 worth the drive.
6657718,Danman,2022-05-20 09:39:00,1,Thanks for the update on the detour. I have reservations to stay at Northstar Lodge on 5/28. Will I be able to pull my boat through the detour to get to Clay Lake?
