6660750,NM_Trout,2022-06-01 07:35:00,1094,I heard via the grapevine that random tests at the border to enter Canada are no longer being conducted. Anybody have evidence otherwise? I'm hoping that isn't just a rumor.
6660778,Whopper,2022-06-01 08:28:00,340,As of 5/20/22 my rider was the lucky recipient of the blue box (covid test kit) Took about a half hour
6660790,NM_Trout,2022-06-01 08:52:00,1094,Shoot. Where did you cross the border at? Any issues finding wifi?
6660822,MKC1022,2022-06-01 09:33:00,1,"Both my passenger and I were chosen for random testing on 5/23/22. Crossing at Fort Frances, they recommended that we park in the gravel lot close by in order to get good reception. Took close to 45 minutes."
6660878,Whopper,2022-06-01 12:42:00,340,"Crossed at Fort Francis, went to the parking lot at the drop box location. No problems with a wifi connection. It was a minor inconvenience but worth it for the week of catching we had"
6660952,nitroman,2022-06-01 17:00:00,368,So do they call you with results?
6661066,Whopper,2022-06-02 07:50:00,340,"Nope, sent an email of negative test results."
6661076,stjoeguy,2022-06-02 09:36:00,979,"And if you're on a remote trip, you won't receive the email until you're already on your way out of Canada."
6661082,Eckohlt,2022-06-02 10:05:00,3685,"Trudeau will call you with the results,don't answer your phone,let him keep trying you,good luck on your trip."
