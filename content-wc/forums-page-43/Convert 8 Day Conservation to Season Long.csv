We may be going in a little early and curious if can convert an already purchased 8 day conservation license to season long by paying the additional for full season. This is for non-resident. Appears can buy a 1 day so thatcmay be best option?

So I called them - after 40 minutes of being on hold - talked to a very nice person who gladly cancelled my 1 day and set up to get me a refund. BUT there's a catch they charge you $10.50 CAN for your mistake. I am assuming this will be the case with you. I don't think they will convert it into a different license.
