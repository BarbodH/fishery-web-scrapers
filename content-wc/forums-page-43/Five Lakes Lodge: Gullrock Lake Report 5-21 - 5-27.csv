6660630,PhilTickelson,2022-05-31 15:40:00,84,"Well, another fantastic trip is in the books for 2022! This trip marks my 3rd time up to Five Lakes Lodge in the last 9 months, and there's one more planned for July! It seems there's always some added stress to these trips for me. For this year, the question was whether ice was going to be off the lake, and whether 105 would even be open or passable. As it turns out, we lucked out on both accounts. No ice to worry about, and we were able to get to 105 with the one detour near Vermillion Bay. This did include driving through about 18"" of water on a low spot of highway 17 between Dryden and Vermillion Bay, which was admittedly a bit sketchy! We had 5 guys in our group, 4 adults and one 12 year old(his first canada trip!). Two in my boat, three in theirs. They ended up focusing mainly on walleye most of the week, while my boat ended up fishing pike most of the week. Both boats did very well. It was odd timing though, water temp was in the low 40s(maybe even high 30s) in the main lake initially, and some of the creeks were just starting to warm up. Bug river as I recall had about 48 degrees that first evening. Seems like some fish were getting ready to spawn, some were spawning, and some were just done spawning. We were a bit early on hitting that post-spawn mayhem, but that didn't slow us down! We caught fish all over the lake, classic early season spots like Starrat Channel and Ranger Bay(below the sanctuary of course) held fish. Sometimes deep in like 20-22 feet, sometimes as shallow as 4 FOW. We also found fish on main lake structure and points (Fishermens, Gull rock, Stoney point, Stephensons, clay banks drop-off). As usual, seems like there were fish everywhere in the lake. Pike fishing was the highlight for me though. I'm still tallying the numbers, but we caught a ton, and a lot of really nice ones. I think we had 13 over 40"" in our group, with the biggest being 43"", caught by the 12 year-old first timer. Talk about getting spoiled on your first canada trip! We did most of our fishing in the numerous bays and feeder creeks feeding the lake. The water was up which meant I could get my boat well into a lot of these creeks, which was a really cool experience. Our biggest walleye was 29.5"", and I think we had probably 20-30 over 20"" on the week. Really great numbers of those slot fish, with TONS of those 13-16"" eaters caught for dinner. Even had a few really nice perch in that 12-13"" range, which was cool! Accommodations were fantastic as always, camp owner Ian was unbelievably helpful in putting together a game plan and helping us find fish, as we'd never fished this early in the year before. Anyone looking to put a trip together should really give Ian @ Five Lakes Lodge a call, like all lodges, they are facing a lot of vaccination related cancellations. In my humble opinion, Gullrock Lake(and Five Lakes Lodge specifically) is a premier destination for people seeking: 1.) Great fishing for walleye and pike, both numbers AND size. I am NOT an expert fishermen, but we put numerous 40"" pike and a 29.5"" walleye in our boat this week, can't think of many drive-to locations that I could do that at. 2.) Affordable Drive-to pricing and location. Drive is a bit long, but I'd GLADLY add on an hour or two each way if it means the fishing is noticeably better, which I feel it is. 3.) extremely well run, accommodating camp with all the amenities you'd expect or need. As a first time guy in my group said, ""Everything is just really well thought out here, and Ian is so engaged and helpful. AND the fishing is by far the best we've had on any of our canada trips."" This is after a few trips where the extent of the fishing tips/advice were things like ""split shot and bare hook with a minnow, drag it over the rocks"". I'll add some pictures when I get a chance this evening, good luck to everyone up north right now!"
6660638,7 Mag,2022-05-31 16:15:00,1887,Sounds like you had a great trip!
6660646,emma17,2022-05-31 16:24:00,436,Outstanding report- thanks for sharing. Was the fishing this trip similar to your previous trips in terms of numbers and size?
6660654,valley366,2022-05-31 16:46:00,193,Sounds like a blast. Ian really does a bang up job making sure everyone has a successful trip. We will see him in late August this year.
6660678,NM_Trout,2022-05-31 18:03:00,1094,Was the water on the road on the way up or the way back? Curious if you had to go through any water on the way back.
6660688,PhilTickelson,2022-05-31 18:53:00,84,"I’d say way more numbers for pike than normal, but that’s a time of year thing I think. Walleye numbers I bet were a bit down for my boat compared to my fall trip, but I think a lot of that is that we didn’t fish for them as much as pike, and I’m not super experienced doing shallow water walleye stuff. But size was really good, probably better than I’ve had in the past. We had quite a a few in that 24-26” range, and then we had a 27.5” and 29.5”, which is pretty great. We still caught walleye basically anywhere we tried, and really had great numbers in a few places like stony point and clay banks, where my vertical high game really shined. I’ve found that you definitely need to give them a chance to get the minnows in their mouth here, if you set the hook immediately you’ll miss a lot of fish. Some of that may be the beastly minnows you get up there, they have some awesome bait at camp. Big old dace minnows that are beautiful.

6660692,RichA$1970,2022-05-31 19:20:00,1159,Awesome trip report and glad to hear of another new option to consider. Can’t wait as I’m leaving in 3 more days & a wake up.
6660700,LoDo,2022-05-31 19:51:00,721,Leave for West End of Red Lake June 7. 10 day trip. Can't wait!!
