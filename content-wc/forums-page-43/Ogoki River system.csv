6660294,vteye3,2022-05-30 18:05:00,496,I've been reading about all the flooding and reviewed the flooding maps provided by the province. Did anyone fish the Ogoki last week and want to post river conditions? Thanks
6660948,Namegosikaa,2022-06-01 16:58:00,61,The waboose dam has been opened so the river below the dam is extremely high. Not sure how it looks above
6661050,vteye3,2022-06-02 06:40:00,496,Waboose dam is that the dam on Ogoki Reservoir? Thanks Charlie
6661084,Namegosikaa,2022-06-02 10:09:00,61,"yes the big dam on the east end of the reservoir, I think the one below mojikit is called summit dam"
6661092,Eckohlt,2022-06-02 10:22:00,3685,Could be lots of trees floating around in that tree infested waters.
6661098,Stauff,2022-06-02 10:45:00,110,Can you imagine what the fishing is like at Eight Flume Falls right now? That would be incredible!
