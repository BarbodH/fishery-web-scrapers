6660624,Walleye2242,2022-05-31 14:31:00,263,I remember my dad and gramps had brochures from allanwater and flindt long long ago. I know it was always on their bucket list. At times i feel like i need to go there to help them fulfill their list.

6660936,reconssd,2022-06-01 15:40:00,147,Thanks everyone for your replies. There are more destinations than I realized when it comes to remote train and lodge options. I also agree with the alcohol/drug choices to get him on a plane. Have a great season and tight lines.

6661204,[email protected],2022-06-02 21:31:00,4,There may still be a train out of Sault Ste. Marie Ontario. I’ve done it to lake wabatangushi. There are others
6660496,reconssd,2022-05-31 09:24:00,147,We have a new member to our fishing group who doesn't like to fly. What options are there for remote camps you can get to via train? I've never thought about a train versus a plane for remote fishing camps. Have any of you gone by train and how was the experience? Thanks in advance for your reply and have a great fishing season.
6660506,Walleye2242,2022-05-31 09:34:00,263,Lodge 88 i have heard is crazy good fishing and camp. Never been. They do a train. I think a camp on Savant lake as well has a train in. 2 of the top of my head by i am NO means an expert....on anything. haha
6660508,spoonchucker,2022-05-31 09:42:00,82,"Many years ago caught via rail out of Sennetere to Kapitachouane Club. Would guess there are others along that line in to Gouin Area. Trip was good , train enjoyable. Not like fishing I have had in Manitoba or Saskatchewan though."
6660512,Cgillespie,2022-05-31 09:47:00,120,Alcohol and sedatives would probably cure any fear of flying.
6660534,Friedo35,2022-05-31 10:45:00,18,We have gone to Allanwater Bridge via train and was great fishing and good camp
6660536,prov1800,2022-05-31 10:55:00,5010,Houseboat tripBoat in camp Check out Big Canon Lakel odge.Short 15 min flight in but can also be brought in by boat.Beautifull ride for 22 mi.

6660592,kim n indiana,2022-05-31 12:57:00,62,"i did shooting star camp twice. two different cabins. both were train in. yes, as mentioned above, the train is not always on time."
6660604,stjoeguy,2022-05-31 13:22:00,979,"It's a boat-in, not train-in, but if you want remote without flying you might consider Winoga Lodge's Lake St. Joseph outpost cabin. You drive to Sioux Lookout, then drive up with the owner to the boat landing on Lake St. Joseph. He hauls everyone down to the cabin in his barge. The cabin is 25 miles from anything, so pretty much like a fly-in without flying."
6660618,Old Timer,2022-05-31 14:10:00,255,"Reconn: Years ago I twice took the train to Allanwater Bridge. Lots of moving water with plenty of nice fish. Camp wasn't fancy, but good enough. There's another camp called Flindt Landing further down the tracks. Never been there, but was on my list for a long time. Send me a PM if you want more info on Allanwater and the train trip."
