Easy enough to do different lengths to let you practice with different weights. Bonus points if you have a cat or cats that are outside. They'll enjoy your wooden dowel practice too. Just remember that when you go live, baits that catch the wind - like spinnerbaits or buzzbaits - will be more challenging when casting into the wind. Everything is easy casting downwind. You'll be proficient in no time and not waste fishing time."
6661266,dhottle,2022-06-03 07:40:00,163,"[QUOTE=Mr. Sauger;6486918]If you have the coin - go for it. Shimano makes two digital control (DC) models: the SLX DC and the Curado DC. The Curado DC is a superior reel due to gears meshing with finer teeth. The DC does help prevent backlash but the overall quality of the real also helps with that too. Shimano makes more than two DC meels. The two you mentioned plus Metanium DC, Antares DC Exsence DC & Calcutta Conquest DC. All four that you failed to mention are superior in quality to the Curado DC. Antares DC is the top of the line. Metanium DC is next & offers a magnesium body for lighter weight. The Exsence DC is JDM only. The Calcutta Conquest DC is a round reel. The other three are low profile reels."
6661272,maddogg,2022-06-03 08:02:00,178,For a first timer jigging is fairly easy with a bait caster.Best thing with a bait caster is no line twist when reeling against the drag.
6487258,Mojo-NC,2020-09-27 08:20:00,1929,"We were all newbies using baitcasting reels at one point or another. All you can do is purchase one, practice with it, and become proficient using it. Take the advice mentioned by others in this thread to reduce the numbers of birds nests that you experience, but know that you WILL still get them occasionally. Everyone gets a birds nest at times, most of which can be picked out. I have specific applications where I will only use a baitcaster, all of which can be categorized as cast and retrieve applications such as throwing spinnerbaits and crankbaits, pitching and flipping, and trolling. I prefer not to use a baitcaster for anything that I categorize more as finesse fishing, such as jigging for walleyes, slow retrieve techniques like fishing plastics, drop-shotting, or throwing anything less that weighs than 3/8 ounce. I've found that my ability to throw light baits accurately with a baitcaster diminishes as compared with my accuracy using spinning reels. Once you get good at using both, you can decide for yourself which you like better for each application. There is no right or wrong with using a baitcaster or spinning reel, only preference."
6660818,retiredmn,2022-06-01 09:20:00,36,I am looking at buying a Lews baitcaster (Tournament Pro Speed Spool LFS) or the (Custom lite Speed Spool SLP). Looking for comments for an informed decision. The SLP reels line guide is closer to the reel than the LFS reel which the line guide is farther away. I think the closer line guide reel is best for accuracy when casting. Would that have an effect on casting distance as compared to the LFS reel.
6660826,That Minnesota guy,2022-06-01 09:44:00,8293,Practice is best for accuracy. Different weight lures and line diameter all factor in to accuracy.
6660854,Wrktfsh,2022-06-01 11:00:00,492,"I'd suggest just getting a traditional bait caster with cast control and learn with that. Most baitcasters have cast control these days, either friction or magnetic, that works well. The DC models just seem pretty spendy for a first timer to try"
6660918,NM_Trout,2022-06-01 14:13:00,1094,"I use a baitcaster exclusively for pitching heavier baits for bass. I find that for light terminal tackle, such as a 1/8 oz jig, I'm better off with a spinning outfit. Trying to baitcast a light lure is darn near impossible. (At least for me). For pitching and flipping jigs at cover, or skipping frogs under a dock, the baitcaster is the way to go. The nice thing about the baitcaster is that you can get that lure turned around and back in the water with just a quick thumb press and a flip."
6661188,SweetD,2022-06-02 19:52:00,243,"I admire those that have the baitcaster thing down and I know it has practical applications but just convinced myself I needed to move away from spincasting rigs with all the various options and sizes. Over the years just saw so many struggle with rats nests, knots and non -functioning baitcasters that I just never really tried but then I’m a simple Walleye, Crappie jig man. Don’t like trolling with downriggers or pitching monster baits for Muskies so spin it is for me. BTW I have caught many 40” pike on spinning equipment some while jigging and some while throwing bigger spoons and baits with larger spincasting equipment.My personal opinion is buy a larger Spincasting setup with appropriate reel and rod to accompany and you can be successful with less headaches. I certainly wouldn’t test exclusively a baitcasting rig on a flyin or at minimum not without backup spincasting equipment you are comfortable with!Good Luck!!!"
6661198,Yellowfin123,2022-06-02 21:03:00,2182,"you should pick up a baitcaster and get the hang of it, theres a bait i like to throw for walleye and bass and a spinning reel just can't hardly reel it in but the baitcaster is smooth as silk, you could have it down pat in a day with no birds nest"
6661220,Eckohlt,2022-06-03 03:33:00,3685,"If it's a bird nest you hope for a small humming bird nest,not an eagle nest"
6661226,RichA$1970,2022-06-03 03:46:00,1159,I’d spend a summer at a local pond nailing it down before taking it on a fishing trip.
6661232,Eckohlt,2022-06-03 04:12:00,3685,Be even better to spend the summer in Ontario trying to nail it down.
6486770,Bigtaproot,2020-09-24 21:22:00,900,"Friends, Wondering if it is worth buying the Shimano bait caster with the digital control microchip. Does anyone have any experience with this real? If so, do you think the learning curve is shortened. Is the bait caster A decent real for a walleye guy. As always, really appreciate all I learned from this website Tool"
6486776,Husker525,2020-09-24 21:40:00,720,"I'm not familiar with that model. But whatever you start with, don't use braid to learn. Start with cheap thick mono to learn how to cast. Backlashes are a B****"
6486794,BornToFish,2020-09-25 04:42:00,1224,"Greetings,I think of bait caster style reels and walleyes in terms of trolling, maybe pulling bottom bouncers. This does not mean that a bait caster could not be used for other applications.The best advice that I can offer about learning to use a bait casting reel is to have an experienced bait caster show you how to go about casting such a reel. It's not that difficult to do, but there is a learning curve. Properly adjusting the brake is a key step in setting up the reel to efficiently cast. After that, it comes down to learning how to use your thumb in controlling the playing out of line.I exclusively use bait casting reels when targeting northern pike and muskies. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6486836,prov1900,2020-09-25 07:52:00,544,"The DC models definitely help with backlash issues, especially if you are a beginner. They will still backlash, just not as frequently as the non digital models. Backlashes are part of the game, you will learn how to fix them and they won't be as big of a deal. Regardless, you are on the right track, i.e. spend the money on a quality baitcast and you will be much happier. Buy a cheap one, as a beginner, and you will throw it away, give it away, or just turn it into a paper weight. As far as walleye apps go, if you are looking for a reel for ""just"" bottom bouncing, lindys, and trolling, there are better options out there. The DC would be overkill in my opinion. If you are into casting stuff, like cranks, plastics, and the like, the baitcasters definitely have a place. I always have one or two rigged up, but truthfully find myself more and more relying on spinning tackle, esp for finesse plastics. My Shimano Curados are more for largemouths/pike/etc."
6486918,Mr. Sauger,2020-09-25 13:53:00,285,"If you have the coin - go for it. Shimano makes two digital control (DC) models: the SLX DC and the Curado DC. The Curado DC is a superior reel due to gears meshing with finer teeth. The DC does help prevent backlash but the overall quality of the real also helps with that too.The Curado’s spool spins easily - we found we could use it to cast lighter lures more than any of our other baitcasters (other curados, diawa tatula, higher end Bass Pro reels). Great casting distance too.If your walleye fishing includes casting and reeling it in this is a great match. However, it might be kinda a waste trolling, jigging, slip bobbering. Like the other post said - good match for bass fishing (pike too).To answer your question more directly - yes the Digital control will shorten your learning curve."
6487024,djcoop52,2020-09-25 21:06:00,1411,I like bait casters on my trolling rods and keep one good one (Quantum Smoke) in the boat for throwing spoons chasing Pike. Most all of the newer ones are a lot easier to use than the old ones most of us grew up with. Plenty of help on the internet with videos to help with the learning curve. Like anything else practice will make the experience better.
6487104,Net_Man,2020-09-26 07:21:00,580,I can't think of a casting situation for a typical walleye lure that spinning gear is not a better option. For walleye trolling applications you would be better off with a line counter reel.
6487116,dvl2700,2020-09-26 07:56:00,371,Looking for some inexpensive level wind reels/bait caster reels to use for jigging and bottom bouncing. I have two good bait casting reels for casting. SUGGESTIONS ?
6487118,Ltrain,2020-09-26 07:58:00,4145,"I use my baitcasters when trolling or drifting a single rod where it will be in my hands and not in a rod holder. Also use them when snap jigging Erie in April with 1 oz jigs or 3/4 ounce bladebaits. This year I switched to all left handed baitcasters so i had to replace 8 of them and didn't want to break the bank. So i went with Kast King . No its not a Shimano or even like my old Daiwa TD2HI reels that i loved but for an entry reel is pretty good. A tip on setting them up to cast- use the coarse adjustment knob to get the bait to fall at about a foot a second. Now this is all I had to do with my Daiwa reels and almost never had a backlash but with the Kast King i was getting repeated bird nests, almost gave up on them. I then set the fine adjustment magnetic brake on the side to the midway point and boom it was on. I couldn't birdnest them if i tried. I started do the bassmaster 2 hand mega cast where it sounds like a golf club whipping through the air and no backlash, just big long casts. Reel really impressed me."
6487210,NWBearcatgrad,2020-09-26 23:09:00,36,"I use baitcaster reels exclusively......NO spinners for mep I agree with all the above info posted. When I first started using them, a few decades ago, I got cheap line, and tied a washer to the end of it. I set a 5 gal bucket out about 5 yds away and cast until I was confident to hitting it, and not getting a lot of bird nests. Then, it was 10 yds, 15, 20,etc. Nowadays, I still hit a day where I get distracted or am not paying attention, but the nests are few and far between. I still have moments though! I get made fun of a lot with my crew, but not many of them can place a rig in spots I can and not get hung up. It is a skill that takes practice and time. Once you get it, its like riding a bike. I have never spent an insane amount on any reel. I actually love my old, and I mean old Abu Garcia's. But my fav. is a Lew's reel that is about 15 years old. It has been through a lot, and still just keeps casting. I did break down, and buy a M and W Skeet Reece reel a couple years back just b/c it was too sweet to pass up. It mainly gets used back here hooking bass. I have a great story from about 10 years back. I had an old Abu spooled with Spider Wire that I was using to catch northern's on. I set the hook, but the old boy spit it out, and hooked into a long that was about 10 inches in dia. I managed to unwedge the log and haul it in from about 10 foot of water. It was about 5 feet long, and was the biggest catch that year Good luck!"
