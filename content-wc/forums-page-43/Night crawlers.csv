Bait Management Zones do not apply to other forms of bait (worms, frogs, crayfish). Refer to pages 18-21, 2022 Fishing Ontario Recreational Fishing Regulations Summary for more information. You can also visit www.ontario.ca/baitfish. So it seems that there are no issues with buying crawlers (in Canada!) and transporting them to wherever you are going."
6661292,maddogg,2022-06-03 09:13:00,178,Thank you staker1875.
6660560,Eckohlt,2022-05-31 11:50:00,3685,"No crawlers in,you better straighten out that resort you called about worms."
6660566,Huntindave,2022-05-31 12:03:00,2194,The personnel at the Duluth newspaper will not be at the border checking you thru. The resort staff will not be at the border checking you thru. Why are you not asking the folks who be checking you during your border crossing?
6660572,The Bullhead Guide,2022-05-31 12:16:00,26,"Just got off the phone with the border officer in Baudette and she said no live bait into Canada this year, no dried or salted bait, no eggs or by products of eggs, no potatoes, So if going to Canada fishing buy your bait, eggs, ect in Canada The Bullhead Guide"
6660574,Eckohlt,2022-05-31 12:21:00,3685,Did she say anything about ostrich eggs??
6660582,Old Timer,2022-05-31 12:47:00,255,"I've addressed the matter of night crawlers in other posts. But in short, you can't bring ANY bait through customs. This means dead or alive, and includes night crawlers. The agent will ask about bait at the border and will turn you around to dispose of ALL bait on the U.S. side. This is not a guess, it's a fact. So you buy your bait in Canada and keep the receipt with your license. Also, you have to buy your bait in the fishing zone where you intend to fish. That said, night crawlers are not addressed in Ontario's fishing regulations at least I haven't found it. The regs specifically provide that no minnows or leeches (dead or alive) can be brought into Ontario. Nothing is said about night crawlers. Ontario's new sustainable bait policy says the same thing. And again, nothing about night crawlers. This leads me to believe (but I don't know) that Canadian customs has a policy of forbidding ALL bait, including night crawlers even though the fishing regs are silent on night crawlers. My friends who fish back and forth on Rainy are also confused by the night crawler rules. They don't pass through customs and are legal fishing Canadian waters provided they are properly licensed, carry their passport, CDC card (I believe) and don't touch ground or another boat while in Canada. But because they don't pass through Canadian customs are they okay bringing night crawlers across? Nobody seems to know."
6660584,guidedfishing,2022-05-31 12:53:00,531,"Do you have a link to the no potatoes response? I just went and checked and on the same page as the no eggs and poultry it clearly says ""Potatoes must be commercially packaged and graded US No.1"" are okay?"
6660588,Hook_settr,2022-05-31 12:55:00,127,"I know this is a thread about night crawlers but I couldn’t hope but notice your post also mentioned potatoes. When did this happen? I knew about ArriveCan, bait, eggs and the vaccines but when did potatoes get banned?"
6660626,walleyecheek,2022-05-31 15:00:00,2231,Awwwwww nuts ! Not the Potato Saga again ! Say it ain't so ! Are parsnips allowed..........LOL.
6660686,Invader21,2022-05-31 18:49:00,105,"Yes, keep your receipts or copies on your phone and with you on the boat. We got stopped by the conservation officers and they wanted to see our receipts: we had both leeches and crawlers. We had the receipt for the leeches, but not the crawlers (not with us). They let us go because they said they weren't even sure what they were supposed to do/cite if we didn't have a crawler receipt. Sort of hilarious.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
6660914,maddogg,2022-06-01 14:09:00,178,Old Timer- How do you know the fishing zone the crawlers were bought in.And where can I find a map of the different zones?
6660108,Bfgilly,2022-05-30 07:37:00,18,I am going to Canada June 12. We have always used salted minnows & leeches for bait. Do night crawlers work as well in June?What would be the order of preference of bait for you?
6660114,prov1800,2022-05-30 07:46:00,5010,Everything works.Depends on catch rate you like.I like lots of walleyes.Iam on lakes that can do 100+.minnows is my favorite for that.any orher bait it slows.Crawlers jig pretty good and leeches.rarely fish with those.I got access to all the minnows I want.they produce.
6660122,Huntindave,2022-05-30 08:05:00,2194,"My preference is artificial baits because (A) I can bring them with me and (B) no hassle storage. If I were to use live bait, I buy what the local (in Canada) bait shop sells and recommends for the area and time where I am fishing. Some lakes are more of a minnow forage and thus minnows would be a preferred bait. The local bait dealer will know what to recommend when you get there. Plus, you don't have to worry about border crossing regulations changing on you."
6660126,Limeyangler,2022-05-30 08:07:00,563,I find as the water warms crawlers work best here on Wabigoon Lake. When guiding here fishing the humps from end of June until September I have lost count of the times guests ignore my advice to get some crawlers(they have to pay for crawlers) only for them to end up using the crawlers I bring with me ..should charge them $2 a crawler . Lol .Covid Tax!
6660158,RichA$1970,2022-05-30 10:33:00,1159,Crawlers are the easiest on live but artificial or hair jigs work me as it’s less hassle
6660322,Invader21,2022-05-30 19:44:00,105,"LeechesThen crawlersThen minnowsBut, it depends on how you like to fish - I like a nice crankbait bite. Some years there is one; some years there isn't. Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
6660344,Jpat,2022-05-30 20:35:00,10,"To the original poster. Was your decision to switch from leaches and salted minnows to crawlers a result of the new bait management zone regulations in Ontario? Im headed up in late June and normally bring leaches in warm weather, but after a call to Red Lake District M.N.R. I was told that I can’t transport leaches from ear falls/Red Lake to the lake I’m going to."
6660522,Bfgilly,2022-05-31 10:09:00,18,"We usually jig with salted minnows & leaches. This year you cannot take salted minnows across the boarder. We used crawlers last August with good success, but we have not used them in mid June. I was just wondering if they worked as well in the spring as they do in the summer. Thanks for all of the replies Bfgilly"
6660548,Eckohlt,2022-05-31 11:24:00,3685,"Let'er eat,they work in June as I'm going June 12,crawlers are ordered."
6660556,The Bullhead Guide,2022-05-31 11:45:00,26,So I see in the Duluth news paper that you can not take any live bait into canada this year. I talked to a resort in Canada and they thought you could take crawlers across if they were in art. bedding. Talked to a person that lives in Warroad and he said no live bait. So does anyone know? Looks like we will have to use plastic.
