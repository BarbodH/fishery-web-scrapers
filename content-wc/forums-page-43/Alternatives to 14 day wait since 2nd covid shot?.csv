I illustrated to you that the rules are not based on current state of the science. The covid19 virus that killed so many no longer exists. The 2 shots required by the rules provide no discernible protection against the virus in current circulation (have you noticed all the vaxed people getting infected again and again?). Therefore the rule in not science based.I commend you on keeping the tone respectful, my original response was triggered by those who could not."

As was said long ago (paraphrasing slightly), I don't believe in the collective wisdom of individual ignorance. And, sadly, seldom is individual ignorance more evident than when lay people debate what science is, or is not. 57 of my 74 years have been spent in pursuit of scientific knowledge and in the application of real science to real world problems. I wish I had learned before my 20th year of doing so that time spent debating crap like what is so evident in this thread is a total waste of time. To loosely quote Robert Heinlein, Never try to teach a pig to sing. It will only waste your time and might annoy the pig. Not calling anyone a pig, not literally, but metaphorically the shoe sure fits at least 2 pairs of feet in this thread. Again, kudos, Sir!"

Some of you have chosen the route of personal attacks, not sure why you need to go that way. A couple recent posters seem to be saying- if you're not a scientist, shut up and do as we scientists say. Two problems with that. 1. There actually are distinguished, real live scientists that disagree with approaches taken (I know, not as many as those that do- but they're still scientists and therefore, likely very capable of presenting a strong case). 2. Unlike Finman Poozie's relatives, there are many really smart people that prefer to limit or eliminate taking medications. That doesn't make them bad or uncaring people. Let's try not to cancel those with opposing viewpoints."

6661582,v-bay gord,2022-06-04 11:59:00,3168,Seems like opposing viewpoints in the US may have contributed to one of the highest death rates from Covid in the developed world.
6661610,C&K,2022-06-04 14:02:00,492,"You mean the manufactured death rate? Specific for the pandemic, CDC issued new ""guidelines"" for coroners and physicians on how to fill out death certificates so they could track the ""true extent"" of their pandemic. My mother passed away a year ago in May. She was 98 years old. She was still getting around good and lived in an assisted living facility. She got the corona in February and was over it in 3-4 days. When she passed away they put COVID-19 as a contributing cause of death because she had a positive test within the 90 days prior. The entire family was royally pi$$ed over it but we couldn't get it changed because it was within the ""rules"". Same thing happened to another local family where a 84 year old man died from a cardiac event in the ER. They tested him posthumous and he had a positive test for corona. That one, they said after ""careful consideration"" they were listing his death as covid-related even though he had zero corona symptoms. That family couldn't get it changed either. Why did they do this? Because the facility gets the Medicare reimbursement with a 20% boost in payment under the pandemic emergency act, but the patient has to be under the ""covid rules"" to get the payment.https://www.medicareadvantage.com/ne...icare-payments The result is that my mother became a ""covid statistic"" in their database even though corona had ZERO anything to do with her death. And it also allowed the government to seize her remaining assets to pay the bill (under Medicare in her assisted living) instead of those assets being passed on to the family as they should've been. Yeah, you can definitely trust the ""data"". If you're gullible. #1 rule is never let a crisis go to waste when there's money to be made off it at your expense."
6660640,farmnfish,2022-05-31 16:15:00,130,With the current virus in circulation and a vaccination that was received last year that statement is not based on the latest science. The latest leans more toward a vaccinated person being more likely to contract the virus.
6660648,Eckohlt,2022-05-31 16:26:00,3685,"I've been jabbed 5 times,so your saying I'm the guy that's in the hot seat??"
6660652,N_of_Quibell,2022-05-31 16:39:00,151,"First, 5 shots - I'm impressed. I thought I was doing pretty well with 4. The stuff about vaccinations making one more susceptible is pure malarkey. Yeh, their effectiveness diminshes over time, but I never seen anything in the peer-reviewed primary scientific literature that suggests one is not better off being vaccinated."
6660730,farmnfish,2022-06-01 05:39:00,130,I don't believe the rules for entry require 4 or 5 shots. Review the efficacy of the just 2 shots after 1.5 years and get back with us about how the rule is science based.
6660758,N_of_Quibell,2022-06-01 07:48:00,151,"It is true vaccine efficacy drops over time, some vaccines more than others:https://www.healthdata.org/covid/cov...ficacy-summary But the available data clearly supports that vaccination, no matter how long ago, is a good thing. If one is concerned about transmission risk, the social responsible action is to get a booster, even if there is no legal requirement for it."
6660836,farmnfish,2022-06-01 10:11:00,130,"So we agree that the rule is not science based? With just 2 doses after a year and a half at best little protection remains (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1....25.22274266v3). Further, the current virus in circulation is no more harmful than the flu yet a flu vax is not required."
6660874,Wawajake,2022-06-01 12:18:00,413,"The science over past 18 mths proves effectiveness.......but now add in the social cues.

6660884,N_of_Quibell,2022-06-01 13:10:00,151,"You have apparently completely misunderstood my point, which is vaccination, even in the past, reduces transmission risk, which from a scientific public health policy is always a good idea. But one still needs to maintain good social hygiene, which I believe is the primary point of article to which you linked. I'm sure everyone is disappointed the vaccine response hasn't been more durable, but that just argues for boosters if original vaccination hasn't been recent. Unfortunately because of the anti-scientific climate that exists in some quarters it is unlikely this will be made mandatory, even if it makes scientific sense. If one has not been vaccinated, now is always a good time to do so. (But I would not recommend time-travel to get your first vaccination 1.5 years ago.) I question the truth of the no more harmful than flu - roughly speaking, 80% of the c-19 mortality has occurred in the >60 age group, of which I unfortunately am a member. I'm done, and will not respond to any more vax nonsense. I just got back from 1.5 wonderful weeks near Vermilion Bay. I caught a few trout, saw 4 moose, 1 cinnamon phase black bear, and 1 lynx. As always, border crossing was pleasant and quick. I'll take these memories with me to the grave - 4 jabs was a very low price to pay, especially since they may have saved my or loved one's life."

It is true that vaccination does not categorically prevent transmission, but the issue is whether they reduce the amount of transmission, which they almost certainly due by reducing the viral burden and the duration of shedding. The result is a reduction in the infectiousiness of an infected vaccinated individual, which reduces the key metric of the amount of transmissibility, or R0. Of course the virus will mutate to ""try"" to defeat this. If one is not vaccined, and the virus kills its host quickly, that's an evolutionary dead-end for the virus as well, so perhaps there is an argument against vaccination."

If a person CHOOSES NOT to be vaccinated for covid then they also CHOOSE NOT to be able to enter the countries which require vaccination. It's that simple. It's not political and their personal beliefs don't mean a **** thing to the country to which they want to enter. Its the requirements of that particular country for any foreigner who wants to enter, period. There's many countries in the world that require specific vaccinations to enter, such as the Yellow Fever vaccination to enter some of the African countries."

You won't be allowed to fish in Canada, and you won't be allowed back into the US. I hope you're prepared for that financially. Until some common sense sets in, which is not likely to happen in politics (which involves money, fame and power - nothing else), and they start treating corona like the common flu, which is actually what it is now, this is the way it is. Most other countries, like Sweden where they don't have politicians with their hands in the pockets of pharma, have allowed common sense to rule. But in the US and Canada where the biotech companies exist that make this stuff, this is not the case. Too much money at stake.https://www.statnews.com/feature/pre...full-data-set/ The more appropriate discussion here should be, when is common sense gonna set in?
