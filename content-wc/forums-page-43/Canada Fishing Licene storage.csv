6661014,pjshorthorn,2022-06-02 04:35:00,5654,"I print three copies. One goes with my passport, one goes in my dry bag for the boat and the third I fold up and put it in a small plastic card holder with my outdoors card that I got at Bobby's years ago in Vermilion Bay. I also keep a picture on my phone. A ziploc works .just make sure it doesn't blow out of the boat..LOL PjShorthorn"
6661018,Stehle1,2022-06-02 05:21:00,22,I make a copy and use contact paper to create a waterproof cover. Then stick it in the back mesh of tackle bag. Kind of like a poor mans laminate. My brother in law was an Air Force pilot and they did that with flight plans or whatever.
6661024,eyecatcher1,2022-06-02 05:45:00,323,I buy a three year license that way it's on a plastic card. Fits in my wallet.
6661046,Iceshack05,2022-06-02 06:27:00,31,"Mine is printed on a full sheet of paper, but i cut it around the the actual certificate portion. This leaves me with less then 1/2 the sheet of paper. This allows me to fold it up neater and I jam it into my wallet to be forgotten about."
6660960,elway12,2022-06-01 17:14:00,335,"How do all of you ""store/keep"" your fishing license while out on a trip? I usually put it in a small plastic waterproof pouch used for Id's etc. But now that I order my license online it prints out on an entire sheet of paper that doesn't fit in the pouch. Does anyone know if you can (legally) reduce the size of the license to be printed out smaller?"
6660964,Clairebear,2022-06-01 17:40:00,937,Take a photo also. just in case.
6660966,Eckohlt,2022-06-01 17:52:00,3685,"Keep folding it until it does fit,it's paper right??"
6660978,RichA$1970,2022-06-01 19:42:00,1159,We’re supposed to buy a license?
6660980,prov1800,2022-06-01 20:03:00,5010,Lol.Since I became a senior citizen I don't need a license anymore
6660988,Pooch,2022-06-01 20:12:00,4618,I have 3x4 zip locks (Keep spinner rigs in them) that hold my license and outdoor card. Keep them in my tackle box so they are always in the boat with me. Also have a backup copy in the cabin and another in my truck. Keeping one in the truck helps when stopped for MNR roadside checks.Pooch
6660990,valley366,2022-06-01 20:16:00,193,Print a copy for the boat and put it in a zip lock back in my tackle bag. Print an extra copy that I keep with the passports.
6660994,RichA$1970,2022-06-01 20:46:00,1159,"Good for Canada for waiving licenses for seniors. I think seniors, veterans and <18 should be able to enjoy the natural resources for free. I don’t mind buying licenses if the fees go directly to the Natural Resources Department to support them but in Illinois it gets diverted to the pond scum of Illinois- politicians (I bought a lifetime Illinois Sporting license when I got out of the Army years ago & get landowner tags from my woods)."
6661008,Eckohlt,2022-06-02 04:14:00,3685,Sometimes it pays to be a antique.
6661010,Eckohlt,2022-06-02 04:21:00,3685,"You don't need to buy a Canadian fishing license,you'll be so deep in the jungle at Hornby even a starving bear won't be able to find you rich."
