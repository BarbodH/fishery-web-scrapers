Any information on this location on the Cat River system or Knobby's would be greatly appreciated. We leave in just 48 over 48 hours, so shifting gears on the fly and hoping to salvage the trip after getting thrown a late curveball. Thanks to Knobby's for taking us on with short notice, but it is challenging to change plans with this kind of notice... Good luck to all!!!"

6661732,prov1800,2022-06-05 06:48:00,5010,What was the reason for the cancellation.There are many problems up north at the outposts.
6661748,Friedo35,2022-06-05 07:12:00,18,"High water and flooding - which we all know about… They said their lodge was flooded and they couldn’t get the planes out to prep the outposts.I get it, BUT… they sure as heck knew this before yesterday. Kinda crappy they waited until 72 hours out to cancel on us. Would have been nice to have time to change to a new outfitter"
6661752,prov1800,2022-06-05 07:22:00,5010,Yeah iam sure they knew few weeķs ago all ready.anyways glad you found a trip.Clarks did get back to me and had 3 outposts open but saw you got in.Have a great trip
