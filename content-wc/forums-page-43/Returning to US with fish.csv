6660484,Billswest,2022-05-31 08:48:00,32,"Hey guys, a bunch of us are going into Nance Lake, north of Kenora, on June 12th. Walsten Outfitters told me recently that because Nance is designated by the province as a ""conservation water"", that taking some fish home with us at the end of our trip is not allowed. Eat all you want while we're there, but that's it. It's been a while since I'd done a trip like this so I wasn't aware. My bad. Do any of you know where we might be able to buy fresh walleye in the area so we can take some back, legally ?"
6660504,Riding high,2022-05-31 09:33:00,69,Call consumers frosted foods in Kenora. Someone said they might. Border Bob's in international falls has boxes of frozen fish. If they're still open. I think that's the walleyes that comes from the nets in some lakes in Canada.
6660516,combine_billy,2022-05-31 10:03:00,151,"This does not sound right to me. I have been going to a conservation lake for over 20 years and the daily limit and the possession limit is 2 under 18"". Which means that you can keep 2 from your last day and take them home."
6660542,Billswest,2022-05-31 11:04:00,32,"I wondered that, too, but our outfitter said no fish can be kept......"
6660552,Old Timer,2022-05-31 11:37:00,255,"You might try Sportsmen's Service in IF. They're located just north of the Holiday and on the west side of the road. They sell fresh and fresh-frozen walleye fillets. I've been buying their fillets for years and never been disappointed. I understand they come from LOTW and, in my opinion, walleye from that lake taste better than from the many other Canadian lakes I've fished. Like I said just my opinion. The cost won't break the bank. And it will save you the trouble of counting what you have in the cooler to take home and what you're frying for dinner. Also, no issues about keeping the skin on, proper packaging and keeping your fish iced between the outpost and the border. I get the tradition of catching fish and bringing home your limit. However, and for me, it's overrated given how few fish you can keep and the cost of an up-scale license."
6660554,NM_Trout,2022-05-31 11:44:00,1094,"I think that your license allows you to take two home. However, like others have mentioned regarding their outfitter, the terms of my agreement with my outfitter do not allow me to bring any fish home. https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=...ih=499&dpr=1.5If you do bring some home, do leave some skin intact on the filet to identify the species."
6660564,combine_billy,2022-05-31 11:52:00,151,"I was going by this statement : because Nance is designated by the province as a ""conservation water"". So it isn't because it is a conservation water that he can't bring home any fish, it is because the outfitter does not allow it. If that is the case, then his outfitter is lying to him as to the reason why."
6660580,guidedfishing,2022-05-31 12:38:00,531,"I does sound a little odd, and does not make sense. The reason I say that is if you want to bring fish home you can't eat any on the last day that you fish anyway if bringing back your limit of 2 or 4 depending on license or waters fished. So I don't know what the outfitters point is from a conservation stand point. Whether you eat the 2 fish or you take them home at the end? Not that I am concerned one way or another what their reason is. It just does not add up."
6660596,v-bay gord,2022-05-31 13:03:00,3168,The Province can stipulate conditions that might result on the no fish requirment as part of the land use permit needed for the commercial cabin on that lake......the most likely reason. It could also be the operator has established his own conservation rules to maintain the health of his fly in fishery. Both reasons are legitimate. Buying walleye from some sources mentioned only perpetuates unregulated netting on area lakes.
