Inside bay's and points and rock piles.We ended up catching a lot of pike in all these places.Lots in the 25-30"" range.Plus a numbe≈ï of smallmouth bass as well.Water temp in main lake at 47f and bay's running around 53f.Boat was crowded with 5 of us so no casting.Fished 10 spots and got 1-3 Pike of each area so caught a few of them."
6660946,Catch&Release,2022-06-01 16:43:00,6,"Hey guys, heading up to Lac Seul 6.17-6.22. Will be near Ear Falls. Appreciate any insight into Walleye and Pike bite about that time. 1. Will do casting/jigging for eyes. Figure for Pike.. target points, bays and any weeds poppin up? Or are there better places to look for? 2. Any recommendations on colors (looks like water is slightly stained? Not as bad as LOTW) is greatly appreciated as I gear up. I have gold, white, pink jigs and will tip with minnow for Walleye. Pike.. not sure yet on what I'll purchase for this trip (due to coloring needs) 3. Any locations that are preferred, I would be in your debt. 4. I'm also using i-boating GPS Nautical maps as it looks like the Humminbird Lakemaster is a joke (and I liked that it has more contour than Navionics). Reallllllly want to keep my lower end, ha. But, I'm open to motoring 20 miles out to get away from the herd. All fishies go back in the lake. If I can possibly repay... I have a bit of experience around NE side of LOTW recently. Thanks!"

With that being said, chartreuse twister tails have always done well for me on Walleyes. Live bait spinner rigs are my #2 choice. For Northerns, I wouldn't go to Canada without my supply of Mepps #5 silver blade spinner and a white tail. Just my two cents worth of advice."

6661280,Mojo-NC,2022-06-03 08:56:00,1929,"This year is going to be a completely different animal with the extremely high water levels. Pull spinner rigs to find the depth where the walleyes are hanging out, then jig 'em up. If you are fishing areas where there is current, look for an eddy. In mid-June, the fish should be in the 12-15' depth range, give or take a few feet. We've caught most of our pike on walleye jigs, spinner rigs, crankbaits, spoons, and overhead arm (R-bend) spinnerbaits. I personally prefer willow blades on my spinnerbaits, and one of my favorites for pike is the 3/8 oz Booyah Super Shad quad blade spinnerbait. Our most successful jigs are 1/4 to 3/8 oz in chartreuse, gold, pink, orange, and white with a corresponding 3"" twister tail and a minnow or leech. That lake has a ton of fish in it. Tight lines!"
6661290,Eckohlt,2022-06-03 09:11:00,3685,"Mojo if your on a flyin just keep your fingers out of the water,as you know on flyin lakes they bite anything that wiggles,that's why I wear a swim suit when swimming up there,you don't want to lose it to a gator."
6661316,Catch&Release,2022-06-03 10:37:00,6,"Thank you! Would the pike be in bays and growing veg? I would think so, but when I was at LOTW.. they were empty, only caught them jiggin for Walleyes."
6661364,Riding high,2022-06-03 14:30:00,69,The best lure I've had for pike in that area was Tony Rizzo red tube chartuse tail orange spinner. The day was bear creek. Absolutelygot tired of catching pike. Tried other lures and could hardly get a strike?? Walleyes I liked around sawmill Bay area. Benatine creek aarea. Steamboat narrows. That's places to start. Pike might be good around the mouth of Wenasaga. Walleye also.

6661682,kereid,2022-06-04 20:47:00,10,I would recommend becoming friends on Facebook with Four Seasons Sport Shop in Ear Falls. They post pictures of their bragging board often and along with the size of the walleye the fisherman shares what lure they were using. If your planning on using live bait you need to place your order with Pam early or you may not get any. Great people try and support them!
6661776,NM_Trout,2022-06-05 08:21:00,1094,"For pike, we like yellow and red spoons such as the 5 of diamonds. Also large silver and black floating rapala original or perch F18 (although they tend to get used up quickly). Predominantly red and white patterns in spinners, spoons and streamers. Weedbeds near drop offs, and points are best for us. We ignore shallow coves as water warms up."
