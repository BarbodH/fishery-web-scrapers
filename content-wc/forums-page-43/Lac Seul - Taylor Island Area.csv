6659164,Big Louie,2022-05-25 14:25:00,22,"We have a houseboat June 25-July 1 on Lac Seul. We usually park the houseboat on Taylor Island and fish within 4-5 miles of Taylor. Typically we are there around July 10-17, but this year we are earlier due to a silver anniversary for one of the crew on July 12. Wondering if the Taylor area will still be a good choice given the earlier date and the late ice out? My simple plan for this trip is to focus on shoreline breaks and fish shallower than we would in July. Any thoughts from folks that have fished Taylor in June would be appreciated."
6659332,rockape,2022-05-26 07:20:00,215,"It's been a few years, but I LOVE the Taylor Island area. Always caught fish and a lot over the slot. Always the last couple of weeks of June too. I'm fishing Eagle with a different group this year, and part of me is freaking because I won't get my Lac Seul fix! You will do great! I hope I do too!"
6659426,Mojo-NC,2022-05-26 14:09:00,1929,Please post a summary of your trip when you get back. We're also doing a houseboat trip on Lac Seul July 8-15. Any intel you are able to provide would be helpful to our group. Thanks in advance.
6659488,Riding high,2022-05-27 05:57:00,69,By then the water temps will be back to normal for that time of year. I would say that the fish will be in the same spots end of June as they are in mid July. I would start same spots same depths as if you was their in mid July. I've had years where walleyes on opener was 20-25' same in mid July and mid August. Real cold opening week kept them deep. So all year they did move much. Good luck and hope you have a great trip.
6659820,PRO-V16,2022-05-28 21:58:00,454,I've been fishing that area for 30 years. Mostly mid-June. By the time you are there the best fishing should be vertical jigging mid lake structure like reefs and humps.
6661044,Big Louie,2022-06-02 06:22:00,22,Thanks for the responses. In mid-July our best presentations have been vertical jig/minnow and a bouncer with a slow death rig and half a crawler. We will probably start on our typical spots and go from there. Can't wait for the trip after a two-year hiatus and hopefully we can find some sand to park the houseboat on given the high water.
6661052,PRO-V16,2022-06-02 06:42:00,454,Your best bet is probably pull right up to the embankment on Taylor and tie off to the trees.
