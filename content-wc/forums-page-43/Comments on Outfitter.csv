They moved us to their place on Nance Lake. Wondering what you know or may have heard. We're flying up from Idaho on June 10th and will be on the Lake the 12th-19th. Hope to hear from you."
6660676,cle,2022-05-31 18:02:00,7,Walsten is not lying to you as someone responded to your post. There are are 3 lodges that I know of that have lakes in provincial parks that have the same rules. You can eat the fish you catch but can't bring any out. I mentioned that I fished Snowshoe lake with him that had the same rules. As far as Chase lake yes they have had a lot of flooding there. There are other posts here regarding the flooding on other lakes. Believe me Walsten is being upfront with you.

6639958,Eckohlt,2022-03-13 12:03:00,3685,You can also go to (search this forum)and type them in and see what pops up.
6640094,Billswest,2022-03-14 10:16:00,32,"Thanks, I tried that and didn't find much on Walsten's. Lots of comments on other outfitters, but no threads on them."
6640164,Skywagon,2022-03-14 15:49:00,1106,Which of their lakes are you going to?
6640180,Billswest,2022-03-14 16:12:00,32,We're going into Chase Lake.......
6640190,Eckohlt,2022-03-14 17:08:00,3685,I've never been there but I'm sure you will really put the screws to them toothy critters!!
6641114,KSlivin,2022-03-18 09:16:00,36,We fished Chase Lake with Halley's camps in 2013. The fishing at that time was ridiculous on numbers. One of our boats had a 150 walleye by 1030 a.m. and stopped counting. If you want to know some spots from back then pm me. One is right in front of you cabin at the inlet for Midway lake. Small mouth were good at the north end of Eagle lake.
6641338,Skywagon,2022-03-19 04:50:00,1106,"I walked through the Walsten cabins on Chase probably 20 years ago when we were fishing the connecting lake ""Eagle"" (no, not the Eagle by Dryden), the cabins were pretty basic at that time, but things change in 20 years. I fished Eagle a couple of different times, fishing was easy, it was a numbers lake, the biggest fish I saw was 24"""
6641858,cle,2022-03-21 05:51:00,7,You won't be disappointed with Walsten Outposts. Class operation. I haven't fished Chase lake but I have fished on Snowshoe. Outstanding fishing. Kevin will take care of you.
6641932,Billswest,2022-03-21 10:09:00,32,"Really appreciate your comment on our outfitter. This is the first time we've booked with them, so your thoughts are reassuring. I've had good exchanges with Kevin and Lizzy so far, but it's always good to hear from someone else who has already used their services."
