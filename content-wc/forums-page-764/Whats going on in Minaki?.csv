547582,Guest,2005-05-04 16:16:00,0,"Reels, We will be hitting the road around 0800 on June 4th to come home, so you might want to call the lodge one evening from Wednesday, June 1 onward at 7-7:15 PM and ask for Don C. Alan, I will give the senkos a try. The weather looks warm the next 2 days. Looking forward to the prespawn smallmouth bite. The article in the April/May Infisherman, ""Spring smallmouth guaranteed"" is excellent. Don"

547518,Reels,2005-05-02 17:06:00,2876,Any news from up north? 32 days and counting.... <{{}}><
547527,Guest,2005-05-02 20:49:00,0,"Reels, I talked to the lodge last week. All the snow melted a while ago, except for some that was piled up. The water levels are near normal. The weather was pleasant till the past week. I am looking forward to getting after the smallmouth. Hope the weather is near normal with stable conditions. I am going to try some slider jigs in the weeds/rushes this year for crappie and smallmouth, and whatever else wants to hit. Will be fishing May 28 to June 3rd. Where do you stay? We are at Birch Island and have a group of 11, from St. Louis, TN, and NC. Hope you tear them up, Don"
547529,Guest,2005-05-02 21:11:00,0,Don....try some 5 inch senkos (smoke/watermelon) and whacky rig them....I've had great luck up there with em. Six weeks and counting.
547531,Guest,2005-05-02 21:32:00,0,I heard a rumor that the walleye limit on Minaki has been changed to 1 fish a day. Is this correct?
547535,Guest,2005-05-03 06:51:00,0,That is correct....thank god! Lets just hope the lodges stick to it. No more 20 walleye shore lunches for a group of five.
547537,Guest,2005-05-03 06:56:00,0,Reelman...just for clarification......There is also a slot limit (35c-45c). The possession limit for a nonresident is 2 walleye on the sport fishing license and 1 for the conservation license. See link below:http://www.kenoradailyminerandnews.c....php?id=132674
547553,Reels,2005-05-03 11:01:00,2876,"Hey Don, I'll be there the 4th. I am at Barbers, just a little north of you. I called you at birch last year and got the current report. Not sure if you remmeber. I would like to do it again this year if it is ok with you? <{{}}><"
547554,Reels,2005-05-03 11:02:00,2876,"Aaron, what is a senko and wacky rig? I have had great luck with Chompers Garlic tube jigs in the smoke and watermelon. They smell like &*%^*%^^ even just moving from spot to spot you want to be upwind of your rods, but the fish love them. Don, the #11 floater has been a great tip too! <{{}}><"
547557,Guest,2005-05-03 12:09:00,0,"Reels, Give me a call or drop over, and I will give you our fishing reports and any patterns. Don"
547558,Guest,2005-05-03 12:50:00,0,Reels.....the senko is a Gary Yamamoto custom bait...it's a soft-plastic stick bait. They are salt impregnated and have a great drop rate (compared to other imitations I've used). I've had great luck up there for smallmouth bass with them. Just use a 2/0 offset hook right through the middle of it and cast it out there weightless. Let it hit the bottome and twitch it every few seconds...then starting slowly reeling it in...letting it sink every once in a while. The bass tear them up. The only downside to using the Senko is they are a bit pricey but if you go buy a few O-rings that fit snug around the middle of the Senko and run the hook between the O-ring and the Sekno (as opposed to right through the Senko) it will last much longer. It takes patients to use these baits but they outfish any other bait I've used up there for smallmouth.
