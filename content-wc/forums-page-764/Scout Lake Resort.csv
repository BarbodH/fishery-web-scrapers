547434,Guest,2005-04-29 09:31:00,0,Thinking about staying at Scout Lake Resort but don't know anything about them. Can anyone help?
547435,Guest,2005-04-29 09:51:00,0,We have stayed at Scout Lake Resort three time and we were very pleased with it. The camp is clean and the Cabins are nice. We have always done well fishing there and are planning on going back in 2006.
547446,Guest,2005-04-29 13:41:00,0,Hated it. Would never go back if it was a free trip. Owner was about as rude as they come. Much better places to go in that area of Lac Seul.
547456,Guest,2005-04-30 10:31:00,0,My brother and I stayed at Scout last year. We did good fishing and found the people who worked there to be fine. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give Scout a 7. We have been to a lot of other Resorts in Canada and we definitly have been at many that are worse and some that are better. We really liked the area of the lake for fishing but it is because we did well and caught plenty of fish. Lac Seul is probably the best Walleye lake I have ever fished at and Im sure that most any of the Resorts on the Lake will make you happy. Price wise Scout is very competitive and if you want a better place to go they are avaliable and maybe just a tad more expensive.
