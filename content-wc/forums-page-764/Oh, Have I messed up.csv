I had a few beers in me and I made the dumbest statement I have ever made. (Besides saying I DO to the first wife). I actually said that I have too much stuff, and will not have to buy anything new this year. My wife laughed and said she will hold me too that and she actually started to look at how much stuff i have. I know for a fact that Doctor Spoons came out with a weedless spoon, and I of course need a new Rod and Reel, or two. I am on edge and feel the need to place a huge Cabela's order right now. Do women not understand that half the fun of fishing is buying tackle??? What else would I do at the January/February Sport shows."

She now has Loomis Rods,two Shimano Stella reels and Im thinking a new Lund will fit in her side of the garage. There is even a chance that she might start fishing someday and if she does I will have to take up golf."

547437,Guest,2005-04-29 09:58:00,0,"Had the same trouble with my first three wives. I found it easier to change wives than quibble about having to much fishing equipment. Some Women just dont understand that a man can never have to much fishing stuff, too many golf clubs, too much beer, too many poker nights, too many Playboy magazines. They can be awful narrow minded. If you dont put your foot down she will be selling your fishing stuff at a garage sale and buying flowers with the money."
547440,Guest,2005-04-29 10:47:00,0,My wife enjoys garage sales. We can't pass by a garage sale without stopping. It turns out that garage sales are ok. I've found entire tackle boxes full of stuff for little or nothing because the wife of the house is selling it because the man of the house has passed away or maybe is out fishing. I don't know. I just tell my wife that when I go to the big lake in the sky that she can have a huge garage sale and all my friends can come over and buy my stuff for little or nothing. It'll be fun for her to see everyone again. It'll keep everyone informed of what's going on with each other. Maybe she could have a sale once a month just to get everyone together to visit. The world according to grumpy.

She said Jim (the salesman) said if you didn't want me to have this, he would tell me how much all the stuff in my boat cost. I said - Buy the racket!"
