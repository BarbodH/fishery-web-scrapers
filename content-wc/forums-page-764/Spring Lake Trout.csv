547360,Guest,2005-04-27 10:08:00,0,I am new to Lake Trout fishing and our group is flying in to Trout Lake (Northeast of Red Lake)on June 4. What is the best method to catch Lake Trout this time of year? What lures and setup do you use? Any help would be appreciated.
547363,Guest,2005-04-27 11:18:00,0,"It will really depend upon water temps, and how deep the fish are. In a normal year, you might be ok doing some long line trolling. In that case use an original rapala, or similar baith with a tighter wiggle. My preferred colors are silver or gold metallic. Another option is using a spoon in those colors. If the weather holds warmer, then they may be starting to get deeper. If that is the case then go with some deeper diving lures. Shad Raps have worked for me, staying with the same colors silver or gold. If they are really getting deep then leadcore line, or a downrigger could be used. Early June I highly doubt that will be the case. Good luck! Agate"

I first learned to catch ""Lakers"" many years ago on Aerobus Lake, in the Perault Falls area. The best bait was a blue and white number 9 floating rapala. The very best Lake Trout lure is a Sutton spoon that we found at the bait shop in Vermillion Bay.(Can't remember the name of shop, but it is ONLY one there.) Buy several number 38s. My partner and I have caught many lakers with them. Other great lures: Williams Wabler, Michigan Stingers and especially, which might surprise some Laker fishermen, is the ""Pixee"",the one about 3 inches with pink center. That has been our second best lure. We use Pink Ladies to get the lure down. To get in down deep and in a hurry attach a 1 1/2 clip- on sinker to it. Otherwise your line is way the #### back. If you have a question email me back. We are staying at ""Boois Lodge"" starting Friday, June 3. Noel Ness Eau Claire, Wisconsin"

Do you attach it directly to the lure or the line? This is my first time going to Booi's. Our group of six is hooking up with a group of eight from madison. Staying in the big cabin. Never have fished for Lakers. looking forward to it. any info. would be appreciated."

It has a flat face topped by metal brace, below the flat face is a weight. The flat face working against the water, along with the weight, forces the the ""Lady"" down. On one end of the ""Lady"" is the line to your reel, trailing off the other end of the Lady is your lure on three feet of line No, the Lakers will not be shallow when we get up there. They will be shallow for only a couple of weeks. That is why you will need a down rigger, as the trout will range from 15 to 35 feet. I have fished them many years in many places mostly in Ontario and once on a great trip to Manitoba to expressly fish for them. You should have a sturdy rod and reel because you might bang into a big one up there. Most of them will be 4-10ers. That is great fishing!!! I use a 12 pound line. This year I am going to use Berkley's Iron Silk, low vis green. It has less vis in the water, but most important to me is that it has little line memory. My reel does on horrible job of creating memory, twisting my line. I then let out all the line when heading in letting the water straighen it out. Hopefully the new line will not twist too much as in the past. Glad to help you out. My partner and I are retired Eau Claire Memorial tachers. Noel"
