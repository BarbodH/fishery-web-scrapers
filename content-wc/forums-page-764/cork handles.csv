547487,Guest,2005-05-02 07:19:00,0,"About four years ago some guys at the cabin next to us were slaying pike on the #18 Rapala in the Red/Gold color. They also said the Yellow/White Rapala works great on Lac Seul as well. We trolled off the weeds, and also casted to weeds and it was incredible. Caught the biggest walleyes of the trip one year doing this. I have four of each color on my trips. Doctor Spoon just came out with a weedless that looks a lot like the Johnson Silver Minnow. Will be throwing that this year. I will be at Evergreen in August."

It works best when applied to a new handle but will help on slightly used handles. See you at Evergreen. I'll be there in June for year number 16 or so. The world according to grumpy."

547579,Guest,2005-05-04 14:05:00,0,We must be doin something wrong haven't caught much pike for the last few years. Last year Gary took us out for a day and thats all we did was cast for pike. Nothin. Pike have been slow for the last several years. At least for our group.
