Actually, I would be able to pick them up anywhere between the 1000 Is. Bridge and Sharbot Lake along Rt. 401 West and Rt. 38 North. Any suggestions would be helpful. Pricing info., if available, would also be appreciated. Thanks. Jig A Lowe"

547337,2746,2005-04-26 18:29:00,3206,"We have always ordered from Cabelas. They come packed in ice and can be repacked easily, allowing us to carry them with us on a 2 day trip with no problem and keep them nicely at camp. Know that is not what you were asking for but is an alternative."
547345,Bean,2005-04-27 05:10:00,20,"I see that Cabela's raised their flat of worm prices by 50% from last year. It's now $59.99. Last year it was $39.99. Bass Pro shops have kept their price the same as last year, which is $39.99."
