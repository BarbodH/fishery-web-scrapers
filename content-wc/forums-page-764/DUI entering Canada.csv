547464,Guest,2005-05-01 08:38:00,0,The punishment varies on the circumstances. You can get as much as three years suspension and jail time on your first conviction. If you hurt someone in an accident look out. You will probably get jail time. If someone dies you can go to jail for up to twenty years. Bottom line don't drink and drive. The kids with their DDs have it figured out. They should be commended.
547350,Guest,2005-04-27 07:29:00,0,"I went through this a few years back with one of the guys in my group. We had been going to Canada for years, and my buddy got a DUI back in the 80s. After 9/11, we checked to see if there were any new issues with crossing the border, and were told of these long existing prohibition for someone enterring with a DUI. As mentioned, we had been doing it for years without knowing, and never having a problem. I informed my fishing buddy, and he went to the Canadian Immigration website and down-loaded the ""rehabilitation"" application forms. Basically, he had to go back to all the places he had lived over the last 20 or so years and get letters from the local law enforcement agencies that he was not a problem, copies of the court documents for the DUI and sentence/penalty, copies of driving abstracts, an FBI background check, and something else, plus he had to pay the $200 non-refundable fee. Gathering all the information took months, and after he sent in the information, the immigration service sent it back saying he didn't have the right documentation for one of the requirements. By that time, Canada changed the rules and now if the DUI is more than 10 years old, you don't need to do anything. So, he ended up not needing the stuff anyway, and lost his $200. If it is between 5 and 10 years old, you can apply for rehabilitation. If it is less than 5 years old, you may be out of luck. We have been going up every year through International Falls and still have not been asked. It's still a gamble whether they ask or not. I've seen some advice that says if you are in the 0 to 10 year range to get the paperwork, fill it out ahead of time and bring $200 in cash with you. If you get asked, you've got all the information available and ready to go. However, based upon reading other posts on other boards, it's my understanding the decision whether to let somebody enter under those circumstances is discretionary with the border crossing agent you are dealing with or who reviews the information. I've talked with a few lodge owners, and they say that once in a while they will have a problem with a guest coming across the border. If the lodge owner knows ahead of time of a guest with a DUI, and I think they can call to the right office and make sure somebody is available to help the person with the paperwork at the border, and maybe smooth things over."
547354,Guest,2005-04-27 07:55:00,0,"I know for a fact that if you are driving to the border, you can possibly get in if you have had a DUI. They do not always check the names of everyone in the car. When we are over on beer, and we always are, we go in, and one guy gives his license and pays the fee for everyone. If they do check your name and find the DUI, they can issue you a Ministers permit for about $200. They do not have to though. If you are flying into Canada, your name will be on the flight docket and will get checked. I had a friend get stuck in the Whinnepeg Airport on his way to North of Sixty. He spent the night in a cell, and was put on a flight home the next day. This is from the Canadian Consulate Office Web-site. It spells out who is not allowed to enter, and what you have to do if you have had a DUI. You need to call the Visa Department at the Detroit Consulate office at 313-567-2085, Monday through Thursday from 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM and ask them for assistance. Detroit is closest in Midwest with a Visa office. Check out this linkhttp://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/can-am/...cat=84&did=397"
547357,Guest,2005-04-27 09:48:00,0,"The guy that said ""no problem"" was kidding. This same question has been getting posted once or twice for 5 years. It is a very serious problem to have a DUI. In Canada this is a felony."
547361,Guest,2005-04-27 10:52:00,0,"How many non-residents that get into Canada with a prior DUI on their record get another DUI while in Canada? I'd guess not many. I can understand multiple convictions being a concern, but one ticket doesn't make a person a threat to society. Is it right? No. But everyone makes mistakes. President Bush has a DUI, and he's been to Canada. I bet he didn't fill out any paperwork!"
547368,Guest,2005-04-27 13:31:00,0,"I don't disagree, however Canada is another country and has its own laws, whether we Americans like or not. It is their country, and they make the laws."
547377,Guest,2005-04-27 15:44:00,0,I wonder how much this law costs Ontario in commerce. What do the business owners who depend on this income say when their guests are turned away at the border? Not too many years ago this wasn't even an issue.
547382,2 DOGS,2005-04-27 17:03:00,361,"I don't think it hurts much because every year this same DUI question and concern is displayed on at least 10 different posts and the number seems to be growing. Some starting as early as January. I knew there were alot of people who would drink and drive, I just never realized so many had been caught. 2 resorts I'm familiar with say business has never been better. They would like to see the exchange rate go up however."
547419,Guest,2005-04-28 18:49:00,0,LTF: Entering Canada with a DUI on your record has been an issue for about 20 years now.
547432,Guest,2005-04-29 08:26:00,0,"If you are arrested in Illinois for a DUI, on your first offense, your fine and court costs add up to around $1500. Your license is suspended for generally 3 to 6 months, and you end up with court supervision, and no conviction on your record. Some counties will even allow you to plead down a DUI to Reckless Driving and jack up the fine. What happens to a Canadian on his first arrest for DUI, and what would happen to an American if he got arrested over the border? What is the legal BAC in Canada?"
547442,Guest,2005-04-29 11:25:00,0,"It is about the same. Your fine will be about $2000.00, you will lose your licence for a year. You will have to go to AA meetings etc. 3 and it is jail time. With the lawyer and court it will cost you more. The worst is, you get a felony charge. Then it is good bye travelling to the states. Until you get a waiver at the US customs which costs you about $200.00US and you may not get it. If you get caught with one joint when your young, it is good bye going to the states. You may get a $200.00 US waiver after a many years, but probably not. The worst of it is now with the new homeland security, we as canadians are not even allowed to bring firearms into the states. It takes about a year of paperwork and alot of cash for the permits. My pheasant hunting trips to SD and Iowa are finished. Isn't that wonderful."

547314,Guest,2005-04-26 12:10:00,0,No problem. ;)
547316,Trailerguy,2005-04-26 12:16:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Yes, they can refuse him entry, or he can pay $200 to get in the 1st time. Do a search here on OWI or DUI, there's a lot of information. You need to call custums now and get the paperwork started or he needs to bow out."
547317,Guest,2005-04-26 12:20:00,0,"Previous experience says ""WATCH OUT!"" Do your homework, contact the Canadian Consulate in the States, have a contingency plan in mind in case you have to leave him at the border, but maybe they will let him in for about $200 Canadian. The first time. We've been through this & ended up fishing in Minnesota."
547328,walley250,2005-04-26 16:39:00,161,"Ok one guy says no problem, another says do paper work, and another says they can refuse you entry. Which one is it."
547329,Trailerguy,2005-04-26 17:01:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]If you want to here it from the horse's mouth: Customs Border Services, Fort Francis District, Information Services, Dail 1-800-274-3655."
547331,Guest,2005-04-26 17:04:00,0,"It is really both. If you go to the border without first prearranging your arrival, they have the option to either refuse you or have you pay a fee of $200. I have heard of both happening. The better thing to do is call the customs office that you will be crossing at. They will send you paperwork, where essentially you admit you made a mistake in getting the DUI, and that you are sorry and that you will not make the same mistake while you are visiting Canada. For processing the paperwork for your admission of the mistake, there is a fee of about $200 that you will have to pay. You will then be able to enter Canada. Call now, and do not wait for the week before the trip. They are reasonable. Call (506) 636-5064 for customs questions. If the DUI was over ten years ago, you probably will not have to pay the money but call the customs office anyway."
547339,hawkeye,2005-04-26 20:08:00,112,There is no bus service anymore out of International Falls
547343,Guest,2005-04-26 21:05:00,0,Boy does this sound familiar. I posted this topic a while back and it went crazy. Nonetheless my father-in-law tried calling all the numbers that were posted and did he get the run around. one office told him to call this office which told him to call this office and so on. Needless to say we never were able to get the paperwork. We are going to bring plenty of greenbacks and simply pay off and beg for forgiveness if need be. If that does not work I guess we will no longer fish in Canada. We will see what happens.
547347,Guest,2005-04-27 06:13:00,0,"Statistics from the various border points show that the ""problem"" crossing with a dui exists mainly with the nw. ontario border crossings. Should the same person cross Pembina,nd...Emerson, mb border crossing it is unlikely (based on there statistics) that you will be questioned or turned back. Go figure! Also, they don't enforce the potato ban......seems like they are tourist friendly in Manitoba!"
