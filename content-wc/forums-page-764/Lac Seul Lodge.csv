If the water gets low it can be a hassle a little to navigate to get out of Rat Bay thou, just stayed there the year water was at a 20 year low. If you decide to go there the water is back to normal and you won't have any problems. If you have never fished Lac Sueul, boy are you in for a treat. Awesome walleye fishing."

547407,Guest,2005-04-28 14:23:00,0,We have been going to LSL for the past five years. Dan runs a great camp. We started out going for a week but that wasn't long enough. We now go the last two weeks in June every year. Fishing is unreal. The camp is very clean and well maintained with very freindly staff. Are you from Kansas? What part? When you going?
547413,Mike Kansas,2005-04-28 15:12:00,1463,Been fishing at Lac Seul Lodge for 16 years. Have fished at main camp and Dan's Black Bay Outpost. Dan takes great pride in treating his fisherman right and making sure your trip builds memorys.
546488,Guest,2005-03-22 18:53:00,0,Thinking of staying at Lac Seul Lodge this year for the first time. Like to have some oppinions of the place. Thanks
546499,Guest,2005-03-23 07:44:00,0,"I dont know much about the lodge but the walleye fishing in the town of Ear falls just below the dam is excellent. Was ther last year the last week of may and the walleye were stacked like cord wood, caught so many fish I had to put the rod down and take a minute to have a smoke and a beer. 3/8oz. glow gig no body tipped with leach, guarantee a walleye, sauger, or whitefish every cast. Largest of the trip was a 33 1/2er."
546504,Guest,2005-03-23 09:58:00,0,"I have not stayed there but have stopped by to look at that resort and it is nice looking. I have stayed in that central part of the lake and the fishing was great. The only real problem is that the four resorts in that area (Lac Seul Lodge, Fisherman's Cove, Onaway Lodge, Scout Lake Lodge) are all in bays and you have to travel a little just to get to the main lake. We have fished that area in August and each day went out about 45 minutes to get to our spots. Big Island and McKenzie Bay are nice and offer numerous points to drift and backtroll. We also fished in Sunlight Lake which is a haul, but we have a spot in there that is incredible."
546507,Smeds,2005-03-23 13:00:00,103,"Went to Lac Seul Lodge for the first time last year June26 - July 3rd. Dan & his staff run a nice place, you won't be disappointed. Gotta agree with the other post, it can be a ""run"" to get to some of the better fishing. We picked this spot because of it's somewhat remote location ... we were not interested in being up and around Ear Falls. Between the boat packages, the cabins, and the service I think we have found a permanent Lac Seul operation to fish out of. Four of us will be returning this year June 18th for a week. Hope this helps!"
546515,Guest,2005-03-24 04:54:00,0,"This May ( 64 more days!!!) will be our 5th year staying at Lac Seul Lodge. Dan runs a clean , friendly opperation. Cottages & boats are first rate. As far as how long it takes to get to the main lake , or ""good"" spots, it's 3 miles to the main lake, but in those 3 miles you have many great spots to pickup plenty of fish. The real plus for me is that when the wind gets going you can stay off the main lake & still catch fish. Rat bay, where the main lodge is, is larger than many of the lakes I normaly fish. Broad lake and Sunlight will take you approx an hour (20 miles)but the fishing can be incredible!. Any place you can stay on Lac Seul will give you great fishing."
546526,Guest,2005-03-24 22:14:00,0,"I've never been to Lac Seul Lodge but I have been to the Silver Water Wheel Lodge on Lac Seul every year for the past 7 and you won't find a better run operation! Top to bottom, theres nothing better. Check it out and give Mike a call! http//www.sww-lodge.com You won't be disappointed!"
546579,Guest,2005-03-25 09:42:00,0,"You will be disappointed because the only thing Mike will tell you is that he is booked up for the entire year. I talked with him a month ago about a second trip I was planning in August. You need to put yourself on his waiting list. My idiots friends will never commit to a trip until March, so I will never be able to go to SWW. I have seen SWW boats on the water (Lunds with 80 hp motors w/ a guide). The #### things are nicer than my boat. Can't say that about most rental boats./"

Have been going to Northwest Ontario since I was just a little guy and now I am 45, and this is the best place I have been too. I'm sure there are other great resorts, but since I found my slice of heaven I am not changing. cheers...IA Walleye"
