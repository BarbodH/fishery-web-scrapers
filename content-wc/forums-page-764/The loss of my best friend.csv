546724,Jignminnow,2005-04-01 06:30:00,42,"It is with great sadness that I report the passing of my dog Toby today. I rescued him from a pound several years ago when he was 7 and it was just by chance. A friend of mine was looking for a Golden Retriever to keep the one that he had company. Whenever I drove by a shelter or pound I would stop in. I spotted Toby way in the back of the kennels. Usually the dogs are always jumping at the fence for you to pet them and take them home. Not Toby. He just sat on the ground as if he knew nobody would take him. I called the friend that was looking for the Golden and told him about him. He asked if I would bring him home and he would take him. So, I did. I signed the papers and left with a dog. I had no leash but Toby picked my car out of about twenty that were in the lot. He ran right to it and sat waiting on the ground. I drove him home with him in the back seat with his head on my shoulder and delivered him to my friend. Two days later the friend informed me that his girlfriend did not want the dog because of his habits at night of licking and chewing is paws. A common Golden problem due to allergies. They wanted me to take him back to the pound. I called them and told them that I was bringing him back. I learned then that Toby had been purchased as a pup by a man to give to his son who was going away to school. The son grew tired of the dog and gave it to the pound. He was adopted but returned after 2 weeks because the people changed their minds. He was adopted again and returned after 6 months with no explanation. Now I had the dog and was about to do this again? No way! He was mine. Toby has been an absolute joy to have around. A gentle giant. He was like my third child. My kids would play hard with him and never once did he snap at them. Karen's children were deathly afraid of dogs but once they discovered what a baby Toby was, they really loved him. (except when he would steal their poptarts). He would be content laying on the floor for hours at your feet. The moment you would move, so would he. He had to be in a room with you. He always slept on the floor in my room. He was a people dog. If we were walking and approached a person walking a dog, he would completely ignore the dog and want attention from the person. If you through a ball, he would get it. If you had another one to throw, he would drop the first one to fetch the second. If you only had one, game over. Sometimes he would drop one and as soon as he saw you release the second one, he would run back and grab it and then go for the second. And then of course, game over. Toby also had a strange infatuation with paper products. Mainly napkins, paper towels and toilet paper. He would sometimes choose a piece of napkin over a treat. Weird dog. Toby would go crazy when the doorbell rang and then practically tackle anyone that came in for affection. He would stand in front of you and back up into you and then stretch his head back so you could scratch his neck. A couple of weeks ago Toby suffered a stroke during the night. He was completely fine when he went to bed and when I got up to take him out in the morning I noticed that his left eye was partially closed. He also seemed to be shaking in his hind quarters. I took him for a walk and when he would stop, his legs would tremble and he would almost fall over. He would collapse on the hardwood floor and be unable to muster up enough strength to get up. We would have to lift him. We put rugs down which really helped and gave it a few days to see how he would be. His eye was open a bit more each day but the leg problem was still there. I took him to the vet and he confirmed what we thought. He had a stroke. The prognosis was 50/50. Some dogs recover and actually have to relearn how to walk again. Just like people going through physical therapy. He gave us some medicine to try but it was more experimental. Toby was still eating and drinking, would not have accidents in the house and still seemed happy. He would thump his tail when you looked at him and did climb the stairs each night to sleep in our room. Things looked as if they were gradually getting better. Two days ago he took a drastic turn for the worse. He suddenly did not want to go out. When he did, he would collapse after a few steps. He spent all of his time flat on his side. He would get up long enough to go out when we made him and then he would go right back to the spot. Yesterday he stopped eating. He would not even take a bite of a piece of ham that Karen tried to give him. I called the vet and was told that most likely he had a second stroke and would not recover. I watched Toby for a very long time as he labored to breathe. This morning as I left for work and pet him good-bye, I wondered if he would pass during the day. I almost wished he would. I decided that this is not a way for a dog to spend his life. He was an active healthy happy dog. Now he was not. At 2:45 we used a blanket like a hammock to lift him into our car's back seat. Karen drove as I sat with him with his head on my lap. I comforted him and told him what a great dog he was all the way to the vet. We carried him in and set him on the table. I held his head and looked him straight in the eyes as the doctor injected him. I wanted to be the last thing he saw. He seemed like he knew what was happening because he lifted his head and began licking my arm which he had not done for a few days. I believe he was saying good-bye. He suddenly stopped and gently set his head down on my hand, let out a sigh and was gone. I will miss his annoying whining in the morning to get up and take him out. I will miss hearing his tail thumping the ground when he saw you looking at him. When I lived in the townhouse he would stand in the utility room and it would sound like a bass drum as you approached the door to come in from outside because he knew you were coming and his tail was the same height as the dryer door. I will miss him stealing my paper napkin from my lap under the table. I will miss being able to wrestle with him. I will miss his stupid looks and shifty eyes. I will miss him walking up to me while sitting on the couch and plopping his butt down and resting his paw on my lap to let him know he wanted some love, and head butting my hand when I stopped too soon. I will miss every thing about him.This is the hardest thing I have had to do. He was truly my best friend. Thanks for letting me vent. It helps.

546725,Guest,2005-04-01 07:23:00,0,The loss of a Dog is always a tramatic happening at our house. We have lost many dogs over the years and they have all been loved members of our faimly. The best thing to do is get the pitter patter of four more little legs in the house. You will bless Toby's memory by sharing your life with a new friend.
546727,Roadhog,2005-04-01 07:48:00,17,"I'm sorry to hear of your loss. Many times I think our pets teach us much more than we teach them. Toby was lucky to find you and you were lucky to find Toby. If you haven't read this before I invite you to read the ""Rainbow Bridge."" We can all hope and pray that some day it will prove to be true.

546754,rebelrn2001,2005-04-02 17:30:00,1563,I don't have any kids except the two that are eagerly awaiting my return tonight after work. I have had 4 other dogs die in my lifetime so far. They are all SO special. I am sorry for your loss.
547438,Guest,2005-04-29 10:15:00,0,Just wondering if you got a new dog yet?
547439,Frankm,2005-04-29 10:46:00,154,What a touching story. I am very sorry for your loss. Pets are a member of the family. Pets love is unconditional.
547444,bronzeback77,2005-04-29 12:42:00,97,"I am sorry to hear about your dog, Toby sounds like a great dog. As soon as I started reading your post I had to call my dog into the room and pet him."
547448,Guest,2005-04-29 16:57:00,0,"Eloquently written, I felt like I was there reliving those moments. I've got tears in my eyes. Thank you for the reminder to take a breath and count the blessings in my life. 5 Stroke"
546728,Guest,2005-04-01 07:56:00,0,"My condolences. I had to bury my ""first child"" three years ago. What a sad couple days at our house. Her last couple years she slept with my daughter in a twin bed. The kids put together a memorial of pictures and lit candles by the fireplace. We buried her in the country where we hunted and walked her, and planted a red oak tree by her side. After a couple days they could talk about her. In a week or so they wanted a new lab. I told them we would think about it, for it was just as hard for me. I also told them we are very busy in the summer with baseball and softball, and when we go to Canada we would have to leave a small pup at home for a week so maybe we would look into it when we get back, or better yet in the fall when it's not so hot. We came back from fishing the first Saturday of August. My daughter woke us Sunday morning and she had the classified ads from the Sunday paper in her hands. She had several ""lab puppies for sale"" already highlighted and said, ""lets make some phone calls dad"". About two weeks later we had our new lab. I hope this helps. LTF"
546732,Guest,2005-04-01 10:56:00,0,"Pets have a strange way about them. I married very young and was given little patience by the good Lord for dealing with crying babies and a whining woman. I thought it best to save my marriage and the kids by finding something else to do when they were all exercising their need to cry and whine. I've never been much of a drinker or womanizer, but I did enjoy hunting. This was the start of a 15 year journey of wondering the woods of Minnesota, Iowa, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Nebraska, and a few more following the most beautiful hounds in the world. As the children grew older and the wife less whiny, we, as a family, enjoyed the company, friendship, and love of these wonderful animals. Now those hounds are all gone and the kids also. I've slowed down to the point that I had to get slower dogs after slower game. My wife and I pheasant hunt over two wonderful Setters that are just about as slow as we are. The kids come home as often as they can to hunt with Dad's dogs. I imagine one of these days there will be grandchildren and we'll find another dog to fit our pace. Pets walk with us through whatever stage of life we are experiencing. Life is not living for me without a dog. Get another dog to walk with you through your next stage. The world according to grumpy."
546733,Guest,2005-04-01 13:26:00,0,"Dogs are gods gift to men and the family. I grew up with dogs my whole life from lovable muts to full bread AKC dogs. Loved them all. Had to see alot of them pass as well. Got a dog for my high school graduation, Syberian Husky, the love of my life. Would not go anywhere with out him. He only lived to 7 years old. Got cancer--had surgery once but it came back. He went from a 80 pound dog to around 40 pounds. had to pick him up to take him outside--finally we had enough--got up one morning, took him out one last time, told him how I loved him and what he meant to me and my family, then loaded him up and took him in and had him put to sleep. My dad passed away awhile back and I still think somewhere up there my dad is in the boat on a canadian like with the dog by his side fishin for walleye. Hope one day to join both of them again."

546743,Guest,2005-04-01 22:45:00,0,So sorry to hear of the loss of Toby. That was a great post and tribute to your dog. I feel your sorrow.Lost my black lab Dana after 10 years and have to say there is nothing wrong with a grown man crying!! I know I did all the way home from the vet's after dropping her off. Toby was an awful lucky dog to have such a loving and caring owner and family such as your's. Thank's for stirring up a wonderful memory of my own. God Bless Rick
