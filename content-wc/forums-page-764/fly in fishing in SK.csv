547517,pooh,2005-05-02 17:04:00,25,I'm looking for some reasonably priced flyins out of La Ronge. ~ $800 - 1200 USD for Walley and Northern fishing. Does anyone have any places you would recommend?
547563,Guest,2005-05-03 16:12:00,0,A good fly-in north of La Ronge on Reindeer Lake is Arctic Lodges. They have a charter direct to own airstrip from Winnipeg but I'm sure would accomodate someone wanting to fly-in themselves from La Ronge. Great trophy Northern Pike and Lake Trout as well as Walleye and Arctic Grayling
