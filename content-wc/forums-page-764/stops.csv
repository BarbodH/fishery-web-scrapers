547400,MN_Moose,2005-04-28 12:00:00,965,"We stop for gas in Twin Cities, Cloquet, I.F. and breakfast in Sioux Narrows. We still have to kill about three hours in Kenora before the beer store opens."
547403,VMS,2005-04-28 13:20:00,1103,"When we travel to Kississing from the twin Cities, we make plenty of stops...Gas at Alexandria or Longville (depends on direction and who we have to pick up along the way), Grand Forks, Ashern, and The pas. We have now been making the trip a 2-1/2 day deal. 4 hours to longville, spend night at cabin. 14 to The Pas, spend night there...then 2-1/2 to lakeside. But...the trip to the campsite is the nicest...17 miles of lake...45 minutes of pure beauty!! Steve That driving through the night is hard...plus when everyone is tired, dangerous also."
547405,Frankm,2005-04-28 13:40:00,154,Yep that was the other issue with us. We would leave at midnight. Our first stretch was through Wisconsin. One guy had to stay awake and help watch for deer. We had several near misses over the years. Too dangerous. Also none of our crew care for driving at night anymore.
547415,Guest,2005-04-28 16:24:00,0,Its about a 14-15 hour drive from around Chicago to Kenora. We usually have a group of about 10 so we combine our bathroom stops with gas and food where we can. We leave around 7pm so lots of night driving which can be pretty rough.
547304,Guest,2005-04-26 10:44:00,0,the post about potatoes got me thinking when one person said the dont want to make any stops till they get to the lodge. I would like to know what percentage of people actually do that. make absolutely no stops from customs at fort francis to the lodge. potty stops count as do bait stops and gas and licenses. I know we stop a couple of times and an hour in the grocery does not kill anyones schedule. just wondering.
547306,Frankm,2005-04-26 11:05:00,154,"We used to drive straight through from Il. It took us about 16 - 18 hours with a boat. That was a long time in the car. We seemed to stop more in Canada. Our bodies were getting sore from being in the car that long. We left at around midnight so are bodies were without sleep for many hours. We would stop in Vermillion Bay and browse the souvenier place for 15-20 min have a coffee before the last stretch. This year we are going to drive to Fort Frances stop at the Safeway for our vegtables, etc and stay at the Super 8. The next day we will stop for breakfast in Dryden. I also want to checkout the Beer Store. Then we'll drive non-stop. We go opening week so we can arrive a day early. I'm looking forward to breaking up the drive. Now we have plenty of time to unload the car/boat and get the boat ready and launched. The best part is a couple extra hours of Blue time."
547315,Trailerguy,2005-04-26 12:11:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]It's 11 hrs for us, we make two stops, both south of the border, for fuel. After 25+ years, the drive is long enough without dawdling along the way."
547319,Guest,2005-04-26 12:30:00,0,"Our drive is about 22 hours. That includes as many potty stops and sandwich stops and smoke stops as it takes. I would guess that we spend about two hours per trip at stops and the older we get the more stops we require. To me its like the story about the ""Old Bull"" and the ""Young Bull"". For those who dont know the story. On a hill over looking a pasture full of Cows stands the Old Bull and the Young Bull. The Young Bull looks at the Old Bull and says "" Lets run down there and service one of those Cows....the Old Bull turns his head slowly and spits towards the Young Bull and says "" Lets walk down there and service them all. Take your time guys and may all of you enjoy the Bounty of Canada this year."
547327,rebelrn2001,2005-04-26 16:05:00,1563,11 hours to Canada from Iowa? How fast do you drive?
547332,Trailerguy,2005-04-26 17:11:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I'm near the North border of Ia. The majority of it is on I-35 or other 4 lanes up through Minnesota, I always run 5 MPH over the limit :shame: which means I get passed all the time. The last 150 miles of two lane in Ontario takes about 3 hrs, so it isn't that bad."
547335,Guest,2005-04-26 18:07:00,0,11 hours from central iowa to nester falls ON. Stop for gas at the twin cities then Orr Minn. At the border top off truck and fill boat with gas and then it is just about1-1/2 hrs to camp. Larry
547338,nitroman,2005-04-26 19:21:00,368,about 15hrs from Waterloo/Cedar falls we stop in Cloquet at the casino for an hour then we stop in Orr for some early morning breakfast after the border we stop at Souix Narrows to purchase our license' then vermillion bay to pick last minuite things of course we have to stop at the Wabigoon falls to catch a few northern and then on to camp
547340,AB,2005-04-26 20:18:00,61,"22 hr. drive - we stop some but drive hard. Rotate drivers by the gas tank. Depending on the time we're driving through these places we usually stop at the Gander Mtn. in Duluth, awesome donuts in Orr, Safeway in Dryden, worms in Vermillion bay, beer at Dutchies in Perrault Falls."
547344,ankorklankor,2005-04-27 04:54:00,273,We spend 13 - 14 hrs with stops in Fargo and North of Winnipeg plus the boarder stop. We'll leave by 7 am and try to drive the speed limit.
