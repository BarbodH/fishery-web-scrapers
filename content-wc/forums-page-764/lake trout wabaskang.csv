546700,Trailerguy,2005-03-30 18:41:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]In the fall I'd go down hwy 105 to Cliff Lake for lake trout. They are more plentiful in Cliff Lake. I've not seen many come off of Wabby in the fall.
546722,Guest,2005-03-31 20:14:00,0,Thanks Trailer guy.The rest of the guys in my group happy catching all the Walleyes they can.I am just looking for something a little different.I guess I will just go after big Norterns.

We usually fished with ciscoes on the bottom. This was our lunch break routine. We probably would have done better if we fished longer, but bottom fishing get pretty boring. It's a good way to catch big northerns too. Good luck"

547002,Stu,2005-04-13 17:46:00,472,"We buy our ciscoes at the gas station at 17&105. Before you go, make a needle out of a piece of wire about 8"" long. Thread the wire thru the butt and out the mouth and tie on a treble hook so it is in the mouth. Supposedly lakers pick fish up head first. It works best if you keep them frozen."

We've always stayed at Lundy's camp. Nobody in our group has ever caught a lake trout in September. I did make a spring trip one year and there were numerous lake trout caught in camp and several of them were pretty nice. I can only speak for the area within a couple miles of camp and can't speak for the camps down around the falls.
547447,Guest,2005-04-29 15:36:00,0,I have heard of people catching some lakers right below the portage going down into Wine Lake. This is on the North end of Wabaskang. Also you could go down into Wine and try your luck because there is some good laker fishing.
