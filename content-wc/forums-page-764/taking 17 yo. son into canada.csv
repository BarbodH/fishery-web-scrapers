And some fishing trips. All you fathers out there do your sons a favor. While there young (mine were in there fortys, one a football coach) buy them a Christmas gift of a $300. rain suit. I keep my feet bone dry in a pair of old fashion rubber overshoes in a all day rain. Had one fisherman got so wet and cold we had to take him in for fear of hypothermia."
547387,Guest,2005-04-27 21:18:00,0,Buy him a digital camera with a large memory card for all the fish pictures he will be taking.Proof of citizenship and a photo id is likely all he likely will need.
547388,Guest,2005-04-27 21:24:00,0,"If you are divorced it is a good idea to have a notorized note from his mother approving the trip also. At 17 it is unlikely there will be any issue, but I always like to have everything needed. Have a great trip! Agate"
547499,Guest,2005-05-02 11:36:00,0,I take a notorized note from his mother even though we are not divorced. Just something that is easy to do and avoid any hassle.
547522,Guest,2005-05-02 19:05:00,0,"The DL and the birth certificate are all you will need. The note is OK, but you will have to have it notorized, or it won't be worth anything. The rain gear is VERY good advice, and a camera is also a must. Even a disposable to have in the boat will take great pictures as they are all close ups. He is a lucky kid at 17 to be going with you. You will have a great time."

The border guard would ask him if his mother knew he was going to Canada but that was about it. One thing that has worked out good is I take a small TV and his Xbox system. When we get back from a day of fishing he can play on it so the nights are not so boring for him. It really came in handy the day we had bad weather and did not fish. Remember, plan the trip around him and you will both have a great time."
