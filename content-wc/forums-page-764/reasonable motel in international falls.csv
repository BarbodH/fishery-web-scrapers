547451,Rich J,2005-04-29 21:41:00,65,"Try the Tee Pee Motel(218-283-8494). It is right on the highway 53 about the middle of town, we stay there each year and it is clean and reasonable. Rich J"
547452,phishfearme,2005-04-30 05:03:00,1242,"the northern lights motel on the left going north is also a nice, reasonable place - with a large freezer in the lobby for frozen foods. - phish"
547453,Trailerguy,2005-04-30 06:39:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I always stay at the Motel 8, they are reasonable and let me bring my dog along."
547458,robwillfish,2005-04-30 15:52:00,13,"Holiday Inn...Kristi is the manager and her staff have the best thing going in town. Indoor pool, hot tub, excellent restaurant and withing walking distance of the Big K and a liquor store. We'll be there on the 20th. Good luck. Rob"
547460,Guest,2005-04-30 23:49:00,0,Hi. If we go that far we cross the border that evening to avoid the crowd the next day.
547465,downriverbob,2005-05-01 08:50:00,880,"I have to 2nd the Holiday Inn we have driven from south of Detroit to International Falls (900 miles in a day), nothing better to have a very comfortable bed and nice restaurant waiting for you. They are also pet friendly. Have a parking lot set up for cars and boats."
547466,JimH,2005-05-01 09:10:00,320,I would also recommend the Holiday Inn. Stay away from the Rambler Inn. Spent one too many nights waking up to the cops breaking up fights at 2AM.
547528,Walleyefisher,2005-05-02 21:11:00,159,Stay away from the Rambler Hotel.....it is a complete sh!thole. I'd rather sleep in the gutter. Super 8 is like a Palace comparetively. Good Luck and Good Fishing
