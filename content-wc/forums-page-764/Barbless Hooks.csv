547481,Kilroy,2005-05-02 01:51:00,59,"Just wondering how you guys keep a worm on a barbless hook? The lakes I fish in Manitoba are pretty much all barbless. I usually throw crankbaites and spoons, but have been going to try somthing different. Same goes for jigs, how in the world do you catch a Walleye on a jig with no barb,lol.........carefully? I suppose I could try and rubberband them to the hook, not sure how that would work. :-) Thanks Kilroy"
547482,Guest,2005-05-02 04:42:00,0,"You can threaten them or try reasoning with them and if neither of those methods work...try slicing a piece of plastic from a jig or worm (less than 1/8"" will work) and slide the disc over the hook after you've applied the bait."
547484,phishfearme,2005-05-02 05:09:00,1242,"a pinched down barb still has a bit of a hump that will hold worms on a bit - but not like a barb. about catching eyes on barbless jigs - keep the tension on! if you let the line go slack, there's a good chance of losing them. - phish"
547491,Northern Manitoban,2005-05-02 09:01:00,195,You can use worm harnesses that have bait barbs up the shank those are legal in Manitoba its just the barb on the hook that has to be removed. I use worms on my jigs and I just hook it one time then a wrap around and hook again. If yyou get a hit then most times she's gone or most of it using jigs. I tried the power worms last year when we ran out of minnows they worked well. If you place a stinger treble on your jig this will also help keeping worm on when jigging.

547526,Pooch,2005-05-02 20:33:00,4619,Take your unused plastic worms or what ever and cut them cross section or into little pieces. Put your worm or leech on then slip one of your pieces of plastic worm over the hook. Been doing that for years. Barbless hooks are a lot easier to get out of human skin than barbed. Trust me and take my word on that..... Pooch
547532,Guest,2005-05-02 23:21:00,0,A rubber band cut in small square pieces pushed onto the hook after your bait works well (esp. with leeches).These hold them on the hook better than pieces of twister tail etc.
547533,Kilroy,2005-05-03 05:31:00,59,"Thanks again, lots of good answers........now I didnt hear one about useing Crazy Glue,lol......thats good, I didnt think I could get the worm to hold still long enough anyways. :-) Kilroy"
547536,Guest,2005-05-03 06:54:00,0,"I routinely bend down the barbs on my hooks and generally don't have much trouble with nightcrawlers coming off, but I run the point all the way through the tip of the nose (lindy rig type fishing). I do this simply to make it easier to unhook smaller fish/sunfish. Lately I've started using circle hooks and so far have had 100% hookups in the corner of the mouth making removal simple. Great for fishing with kids."
547562,Bill Krejca,2005-05-03 15:39:00,6107,"Although this isn't anything new for those who use barbless hooks, I've learned that any fish that I want to net requires maybe a little slower reeling in than with a barbed hook. The time when the fish has the best chance of getting off is when you have it at the top of the water and are waiting for the net guy to scoop it up. Slowing down allows the netter to get there before the fish. Have fun!"
