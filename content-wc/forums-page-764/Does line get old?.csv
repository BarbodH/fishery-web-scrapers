For superlines on my baitcasters, I have used mostly Power Pro, and I have gone two years. When I pull them out this year, I will see how they look and might use them a third year. I keep them in my basement."
547431,Gary_IA,2005-04-29 07:55:00,144,"I used to fish more regularly than now and mostly on annual trips to Canada. My practice was to replace all of my line AFTER I returned. If I had a major line loss or damage after that on one of my reels, I would replace it then. In any event, I knew that I had good line on my reels and if an ""emergency trip"" came up, I was good to go. Also line replacement after the trip meant that there was that much less to think about when I was getting ready for the next fishing trip."
547475,Guest,2005-05-01 17:36:00,0,"Line is like beer. Old beer will get you to la-la land but fresh beer will make the trip more enjoyable. The fresher the better. Mono loses polymers. Heat and light are killers. (Just like beer, again.) It's a good idea to store spools in the fridge right next to the worms and the ol' lady's cheesecake. As mentioned, why go out and buy an eight dollar lure that you'll lose on your second cast and not replace your line? Dump the old stuff."
547384,FIB,2005-04-27 20:36:00,23,"I used to live on a lake and fish constantly (five years ago). I have a bunch of leftover 6,8,and 10 lb. spools of line sitting in my garage (good quality). As I said most is five + years old. Question is, does line go bad/expire on the spool? My gut says throw it out and get new stuff, am I wrong?"
547389,Guest,2005-04-27 21:27:00,0,"I would dump it, and get some new stuff. Sitting in the garage with temperature changes, stuff floating in the air, and even light will degrade the line, especially mono. For the small price of new line, it would be better to change then to risk losing a great fish on bad line... especially when you were pretty sure of the answer in the first place. Agate"
547392,phishfearme,2005-04-28 09:01:00,1242,"good line simply does not go bad just sitting around in normal environments. it will only go bad from wear and/or line fatigue although the line ""memory"" may make it unwieldy. in any event, don't just toss it - recycle it. - phish"
547393,515,2005-04-28 09:02:00,254,"I would have to agree with Agate, dump it. Line does get dried out with age and will not be a flexible. For what it's worth buy new and you won't have to worry about losing the big on on the days you do make it out fishing. Mike"
547394,Guest,2005-04-28 09:19:00,0,Send it to me. I dont ever catch any fish that will break line.
547395,Guest,2005-04-28 10:08:00,0,Dump it.
547398,Guest,2005-04-28 11:27:00,0,If its fireline dont throw it out.
547404,Guest,2005-04-28 13:28:00,0,I would call or write Berkley if it's Berkley line. I have used thier line that is several years old if it has been kept out of the direct sunlight. If it's been on your reel that long if has to go.
547406,Guest,2005-04-28 13:46:00,0,"While reading this thread I cant help but wonder how often do you guys normally put new line on? I for one have always replaced my line before each trip and I will got to Canada three or four times a year. I use three different outfits and I figure it costs me about $20 a trip to make sure that my line is in A1 shape for each trip. Just wondering what do you guys do? Thanks, Archie"
547408,Guest,2005-04-28 14:24:00,0,"I end up replacing line a couple times per year. That has more to do with the fact that I fish, at least a little, everyday. My preference for jigging and casting is fireline. For trolling I will either use mono, or use fireline with a long flourocarbon leader. The season always begins with fresh line. Agate"
