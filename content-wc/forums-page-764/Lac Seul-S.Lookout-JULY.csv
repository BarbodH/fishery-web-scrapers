And I'm not just saying that because I'm a guide on Lac Seul, but because the lake is massive, and it can be treacherous for first time anglers. There are more unmarked reefs on Lac Seul than marked ones. And, Lac Seul is a resevoir, so the water depth varies year to year. Reefs that you drive over one year, may be out of the water the next, or even worse, two feet under. There are many lodges in the area that offer guides on a daily basis. So give them a shot. When it comes to tackling the walleye out there, nothing beats live bait and a jig. I prefer minnows, and 1/4 or 3/8 oz. jigs of varying colors. If you are going to be doing a lot of searching for hot spots, try bottom bouncing rigs with spinners, but when you find the walleye, nothing beats the jig bite. Pike are stupid, but they can also be elusive. Last year was the worst pike fishing year in a long time, but this year is already shaping up to be hot. There are tons of rock points, cabbage beds, and mid lake humps that will hold big northerns on any given day. Spoons, spinner baits, bucktails, crankbaits and a variety of topwater baits will have you well prepared for whatever conditions mother nature throws at you. As for Musky...good luck! They cost extra! Hope this info helps! See you on the water."

Or, you could call a lodge and ask for a guides name or number. Alot of guides freelance and as long as it doesn't interfere with the lodge trips, the lodge doesn't mind either."
