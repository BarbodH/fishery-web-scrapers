547496,Guest,2005-05-02 11:08:00,0,We will be going through International Falls in July about 2:AM. Where is a good place to exchange money at that time in the morning?
547502,Frankm,2005-05-02 12:21:00,154,Just about everywhere up there take US funds. We never exchange money.
547503,Guest,2005-05-02 12:54:00,0,I exchange my money at my Bank at home. This way I get the proper exchange both coming and going.

547508,MTJ,2005-05-02 13:40:00,106,I'll have to second the ATM theory. If you use your VISA they will generally give you daily exchange rates. Usually better than the bank can do. ATM's all over FF.

547549,Guest,2005-05-03 09:21:00,0,There is an exchange place right across the street from Fort Frances customs. It is called Custom's House Exchange. It is in the Ontario Travel Centre Building. It gives the most competitive exchange rate around. The exchange rate has been fluctuating about 5 cents in recent days.
547556,Guest,2005-05-03 11:54:00,0,"When I tried to exchange my American for Canadian at my bank, they told me they don't ""exchange"". They will ""sell"" me some Canadian in whole bills. Naturally they charge a small fee, but they have that built in so it appears the exchange rate is a little higher. Here's an interesting note, though. Last year I bought about $500 American dollars worth of Canadian at my local bank. I don't remember exactly how much I got back, but I think it was right around $690 Canadian or so. Anyway, we crossed the bridge at International Falls, paid the bridge fee (I forget what that was, too, but it was, what, $12 or $18, doesn't matter) got to the customs shack on the Canadian side and got turned back (I'll skip all the sordid DUI details). OK, so now we go back to I.F. and stop in at the big place on the corner that advertises exchange. Remember, all we've spent is the bridge fee about an hour ago. They exchanged our money back, and one would think we should get about $480 back or so. Nope! We got about $415. Quite an exchange difference. Not complaining, just thought the difference was interesting. Bander6"
