4303194,Walleye will,2015-11-05 08:28:00,218,I have heard a lot about the walleye run on the rainy River in March-April time frame. Wondering if people make trip there or is it just locals?

I will say the last 5 years have not been as good for us buts it's still very good fishing for numbers and size. It's not just locals fishing the river in the spring, it people from all over the Midwest. Be ready for long lines at the ramps but it's certainly worth it."

Give your group a few days because the walleyes can get lockjaw and then turn on for TV show type fishing. Every year is different. Over time I've seen water so high it was hard to maneuver the boat, ice on the river until the last week of the season, muddy water, snow, 5 days of rain, unbelievable wind, etc. So be prepared for anything. Make sure you don't cross the center of the river which is he Canadian side."
