4331882,Baseline,2015-11-20 05:20:00,3207,"The Landings on Redgut Bay of Canadian Rainy Lake. Young's at Nestor Falls Lake of the Woods. If you really want to get out in the woods try Agimac Resort on Indian Lake. Another out in the woods trip is Separation Lake Lodge on the English River north of Kenora. Drive to their campground and boat out to lodge about 5 miles. They will lead you out. Separation is a personal favorite of mine.I used to do the Lac Suel trips, but I like the more remote resorts. For me it's a better quality trip experience and no big water to deal with when the wind kicks up."

4318458,MikeinMN,2015-11-12 22:13:00,190,"Gawley's Little Beaver Lodge just south of Ear Falls Ontario on Lac Seul is a great place to stay and can accommodate a group of two. We do well on the walleyes, and catch an occasional smallie, as well as some good sized pike, while fishing for walleye. I think there is a fair population of smallmouth accessible on that part of Lac Seul, but our group doesn't really know how to target them. They have free launching and docking with electric on the dock. Free unlimited ice, minnows available, clean cabins. PM me if you have further questions on the camp or that part of Lac Seul."
