3926553,Kwags,2015-06-01 20:00:00,48,"Every time Mike and his son (and family) returns from a trip, I'm sure thats where I'm going next Thanks for muddling up the North Caribou, Ribes, Whitewater, Johns Lake and on and on trips Mike! Is it the lake, or is it Mike Borger? I'm starting to wonder . I only know I wish I could fish with Brendan"
3926577,Mike Borger,2015-06-01 20:12:00,1554,"Ah yes, eternal questions....When it rains, why don't sheep shrink?Why do they lock gas station bathrooms? Are they afraid someone will clean them? If you choke a Smurf, What color would it turn? and Is it the lake or Mike Borger? I'm not telling. Seriously, thank you for the kind words!"

3929705,pjshorthorn,2015-06-02 16:02:00,5654,"Mike: The eternal questions are good ones and I'll offer my thoughts after having pondered on them for a day. - Sheep don't shrink because driers aren't big enough for them to fit into. - Gas station bathrooms are always locked because they are that disgusting and NO ONE would ever go in to clean them. - Everyone knows a Smurf turns purple when in a choke hold. They are blue because they eat the wild blueberries in Canada or is it the winter's.....or is it both ? - Is it the lake or Dad ? It is always Dad being a great guide for their children....placing them in a position to catch fish before yourself, hoping they catch more fish , bigger fish and having a great time that they will always remember. In this case your son will always remember the fish he caught and the time he spent with you in the boat. You will always remember those conversations in the boat and the smiles your son had after each fish was landed. Nice job capturing your son's trip and his enjoyment. I and others enjoyed sharing in your experience watching the videos. I bet your son hasn't told anyone about the trip back home Tight Lines, PjShorthorn"

Right now at least that kid has zero clue how lucky he is. One day he will though - then he can take me."

3934361,fish007,2015-06-04 06:17:00,120,Thanks for the great story and pictures ! I love those boats. Do they have a brand on them or are they home built?
3934449,Mike Borger,2015-06-04 06:50:00,1554,You're very welcome!Those boats are built by Giesler in North Bay Ontario. Definitely works of art!http://www.gieslerboats.ca/

3920633,Mike Borger,2015-05-30 22:40:00,1554,"As I alluded to in an earlier post last weeks trip to Brace was unreal. It included the single best day of pike fishing I've ever had in my life. Best part is I got to experience that with my son!The full report is now up complete with a gross amount of photos and round about a dozen video clips. If you're interested have a look.Cheers, Mikehttp://www.canadafishingguide.net/brace-lake-adventure/"
3920681,adempsey,2015-05-30 23:15:00,963,"Very nice! It's good to see how healthy all those fish look. Thanks for taking the time to take the photos and videos, I imagine that takes up quite a bit of your vacation time. I am really bad when it comes to taking photos/videos on my own trips - I'd rather be fishing, lol. Surprised about Ara Lake Camp too. Looks like it's located perfectly as well."

3920809,theeyeshaveit,2015-05-31 04:06:00,15,"Excellent report, Mike. I've had the joy of experiencing Ara/Meta/Brace for 26 years now. My group will be heading there in three weeks. For years I've been telling people back home about the outstanding fishing and NOW you've provided some evidence that I haven't been lying! With such a vast fishery, we continually find new areas to fish and never run out of places to explore. As for Ara Lake Camp, it is open only on a limited basis this year. The owners are retiring and, basically, are giving all of us ""old timers"" the opportunity to come back one more time. I'm told a new owner is ""negotiating"" with them now. It's a wonderful camp, great location and with excellent facilities. I can only hope it reopens next year with new owners. If not, off to Brace Lake outfitters it will be. Again, great report and thanks for all the trip reports you publish Eclipse"
3920929,Juls,2015-05-31 06:19:00,13414,"Thanks for sharing your experience with us. It looks like everyone had a great time. We fished Meta and Ara lakes last August and will be headed up there again this August. We use the same boats, by the way. Your pictures have now made it almost impossible to wait that long!! lol I'm counting the days! ( 65 more days) I love it up there...."
3921153,Mike Borger,2015-05-31 07:42:00,1554,"26 years?, wow!! I'll bet you've got plenty of stories to tell! I had a couple of other people message me about the Ara camp so I removed all reference to it from my post.Quote: Originally Posted by JulsThanks for sharing your experience with us.

3921449,retire55,2015-05-31 08:53:00,1029,Thanks very much Mike for another great report with glorious videos and pics. Some great gator candy. Such outstanding Father and son trips have to be very satisfying.
3922417,chris.brock,2015-05-31 15:35:00,112,I bet your arms were pretty sore after that trip. Crazy pike! I hope to fish that chain of lakes someday. This report reinforces that hope.
3922721,RickOnt,2015-05-31 17:32:00,217,WOW!!! Great report and great trip!! A fine way to start the 2015 season
