4317258,kona77,2015-11-12 11:48:00,236,Michigan Walleye Guy- Next year will be our 4th trip thru the Clarke's.. We have fished Grace and Antenna Lakes.. We are taking two groups next year and one group will be fishing Bertrand.. The fishing on both Grace and Antenna was very good and the Clarke's provide great service and are constantly updating the cabins and facilities..I contacted a number of other groups on some of their other lakes and have received a lot of other positive feedback. Early and mid June dates may be tough to get with all their repeat clients but you can contact Wayne or Karla and they can give you an update.You will not be disappointed if you book a trip thru the Clarke's..

4310818,Mike Borger,2015-11-09 11:11:00,1554,"I saw that already and thought it was great, seems like a nice family. Had no idea how involved the minnow business is."
4311130,Catman59,2015-11-09 14:52:00,345,Great video ......... I guess $5 a dozen isn't too bad when you see how much work it takes to get them !!!
4311594,Whopper,2015-11-09 17:57:00,340,"Pretty interesting video. I watched a couple other videos from Clark's, talk about a workaholic."

4315330,michigan walleye guy,2015-11-11 12:16:00,95,"Has anybody been to these fly-in outposts? The website is excellent, as is the video mentioned in this thread. I am definitely interested, especially since my first fly-in trip of the season for 2016 (Larus Lake out of Nestor Falls Fly-In Outposts) has been nuked due to my daughters' high school graduation.... Am looking to set something up for early to mid-June. Any feedback would be appreciated!"
4315714,fishron,2015-11-11 16:02:00,317,A very interesting video of a family that is totally committed to a challenging business. I'm amazed that it can be profitable to fly in to numerous minnow producing areas and that the small shallow lakes are productive enough to sustain the business. Kudos to your family for pulling together to make it work. Looks like you run some quality fishing camps also. Thanks for sharing.
