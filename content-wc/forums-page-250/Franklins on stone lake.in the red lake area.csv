4324154,tackleman,2015-11-16 09:49:00,444,"a couple years ago while visiting friends we went to Dicks sporting good in Rochester mn. I purchased a map of Eagle Lake and it had all those things you were asking about. I just dug it out of my stack of lake maps and it was made by Fishing Hot Spots Inc. www:fishinghotspots.com is the web site on the back of the map. my map says it is from the Canadian series so quite possibly they will have one for the lake you are looking at. I have several maps of eagle lake and this one is by far the best for the average fisherman. it has the rocks, reef, weed beds and lat and long lines. check out the web site and see what they have."
