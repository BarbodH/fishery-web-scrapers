4316586,v-bay gord,2015-11-12 07:08:00,3168,"Here's a question to those who recognize ""Veterans Day"". While watching ""The Voice"" last night there were three references to Veterans Day.......in each they stated ""Happy Veterans Day"" I guess I've never heard it expressed that way, and it seems odd to me. In Canada we have ""Remembrance Day"" which is more a day of somber reflection......I would never consider it a ""Happy"" day. It strikes me as inappropriate, but perhaps I'm too sensitive? Am I confusing it with Memorial Day? What do the veterans think?"
4316674,Lake Wisconsin,2015-11-12 07:48:00,1960,"I was thinking the same thing when I heard ""Happy Veterans Day"" on the radio. Not sure how I see it as happy. I look at all that has been given by our armed forces, and don't see it as happy. More of an appreciation, gratitude of what has been given."

Canada seems to me to be much more cohesive and respectful as a country than the US, perhaps because it is only 1/10th the population. There simply does not seem to be the extremes that can surface in the US."
4316818,bthomas3333,2015-11-12 08:43:00,465,Ugh...There are differences between the two countries. The previous post sort of takes a shot at Americans which is a bit unfair in the case.In the US 11/11 was originally Armistice Day. Celebrating the end of WW1. In 1945 a US veteran (Mr Weeks) petitioned President Wilson to change the name to Veterans Day to celebrate all veterans. After all we have Memorial day in May to celebrate the fallen heroes. The President agreed and changed the name to Veterans Day. This history is why the day is viewed slightly differently in the two countries and why you see a bit more celebration (parades / happy...) to celebrate all of the US veterans.B-
4316978,v-bay gord,2015-11-12 09:56:00,3168,That makes sense. The two days hold different meanings and interpretations.
4317138,LOW1,2015-11-12 10:52:00,2828,"No shots intended. I think that bt is correct that the original intent was to celebrate the end of world war 1. But this changed - at least on paper- to be more of a day of thanks and respect for all vets. After that change, I don't think it was intended to be a happy day. http://www.va.gov/opa/vetsday/vetdayhistory.asp Neither was Memorial Day, but too many of us don't do a good job in remembering either day as intended."
4317218,MrSimon,2015-11-12 11:28:00,922,I say Happy Veterans Day to everyone I know who served ..... they seem to genuinely appreciate the comment. Let's not overthink this.
