Think i need to do the 4 1/2 hour roadtrip and hit up the french next year. My best walleye fishing memory was going up to ice fish on nippissing with a friend whose parents own a dairy farm nearby. Just slayed the walleye on .... You guessed it, a big ol jighead with a small local minnow on it! As soon as the jig hit bottom you were reeling up a walleye (a couple of 2lb or so ciscoe joined the fun as well). Great fishery that, hope the decision to stop native netting early this year helps with the stock rebounding on the main lake."

You're correct about the native netting situation, I truly hope it gets sorted out long term. Saying that I was shocked at the numbers even though they were mostly small."

Ice fishing can be tough.But when we were on the french river we walked out about 100 yds from the front door of the cabin and we were on the fish. I still use the same methods to ice fish today.A coat hanger shaped to hold the line,and a willow branch on a 45 degree angle over the hole.In those days we did not use rods,just a piece of wood ,sort of like a tip up.And el cheapo Canadian Tire line.A split shot and a hook. I have to get the slides converted to digital before I can get them uploaded here.But if you ever want to drop over and check out the slides I have a business that is about 20 minutes from where you live.I am in Oakville. Right off the highway at dorval and the QEW. Not that you don't don't have enough fish pics,but these are unique."
4307610,Mike Borger,2015-11-07 08:16:00,1554,"Very cool! Didn't realize you were local as well, if there's a chance to drop by I certainly will."

4304898,Mike Borger,2015-11-05 21:02:00,1554,"Hey fellas, in early October I traveled to the upper French River with my family over the Canadian thanksgiving. This trip was far different from my usual remote destinations but was still pretty great in its own way.What you will probably find most interesting is a series of historical letters I managed to unearth penned in 1947 by the original owner of the camp, Merle Anderson. He describes in detail building the place back in 1905 as well as his work as a bush doctor on the upper French. It's really fascinating stuff!As far as our trip went, the walleyes were incredibly abundant but REALLY small. Saying that there are some bigger fish and I may have fared better if I'd really focused on them.Also I was literally blown away by the super crude but incredibly effective way the locals fish walleye on that river.We spent a LOT of time targeting musky and sadly drew a blank, although I did have one vicious hit.The facilities, boats and motors and especially the food were all incredible. I'd go back there in a heart beat for another short family trip as it's very close to home.You can read all about it here if you wish:http://www.canadafishingguide.net/th...amily-getaway/Cheers, Mike"
4304986,fishron,2015-11-06 04:07:00,317,"Great trip report, Mike. Trips like that will be a part of fishing families memory forever. It's interesting how you quite often pick up on a bait presentation that you would never use on your own. We fished with a guide in the Gogama area that would not let us troll more than ten feet behind the boat. He didn't want to spend his time dealing with snags. The crazy thing is that on that lake it worked well. We caught great walleye in the prop wash. Sounds like the lodge had a great meal plan. Our group spent many trips over Canada day at the now gone Greenshingle Lodge in Southern Ontario. It was easy for the locals to access and they came in droves for the good food. There would always be room for us grungy fishermen who just came off the lake to enjoy a meal amid the well dressed locals. Thanks for sharing. It brought back many memories."
4305042,pjshorthorn,2015-11-06 04:48:00,5654,"Mike: Thanks for sharing another interesting trip. I especially enjoyed the letters about the history of the lodge. It would be great to see historical articles such as this in your new magazine. !!!!! If you need filler material for a future edition, you might also consider doing an investigative piece on why V-Bay Gored wears a kilt while mowing around the lodge. There has to be an interesting story in there somewhere. Great job. PjShorthorn."
4305242,Mike Borger,2015-11-06 06:18:00,1554,"Sounds like you can definitely relate to my experience at Chaudiere! I'm still amazed at how everyone fishes walleye up there. If I go back I probably still won't fish that way LOL!Quote: Originally Posted by pjshorthornMike:Thanks for sharing another interesting trip.

Glad you enjoyed, and I agree, the old letters and photos are my favorite part too!You could be onto something about Gord. If there's a story there I'm all ears."
4305282,strength22,2015-11-06 06:39:00,49,Wow..those letters were something else. Makes me feel soft as I read about cutting wrists open with no pain killers and setting broken femurs and riding a train...cant even imagine the pain. Great stuff...so cool. Thanks for sharing.
4305298,pjshorthorn,2015-11-06 06:44:00,5654,"I'm not sure if it is a story or just a string of random thoughts and strange happenings that somehow surround Gord. Sports Illustrated has a snippet in each publication called ""Sign of the Apocalypse"". Maybe there should be a snippet called ""A Random Thought from Gord"" PjShorthorn."
4305306,Mike Borger,2015-11-06 06:45:00,1554,"Agreed, those old letters were amazing! FWIW they were also hard to unearth."
4305858,Bassmandpe,2015-11-06 10:04:00,42,"Great article, nice to read a piece like this one. My very first trip to Canada in 1956 was to Chaudiere Lodge with my Dad and his friend. We were from Pittsburgh but I did not know about the Pittsburgh Club but I was only 12 at the time. We drove to North Bay on gravel roads and took the big boat down the French river to the Lodge. We had a Native Guide double shift everyday. He was only a few years older and we became good friends. I was a fishing fool in those days, guess I still am. Remember it as a great trip and great time with my Dad. It was the start of over fifty five years of trips to Canada and now go twice a year to two different locations. It all started right here!"

What was the fishing like back then? I bet you've got some stories!"
4306538,uv2021,2015-11-06 16:06:00,48,"Man does that place bring back memories!!!I never stayed there but we drove to Dokis and went to a private cottage that was owned by a gentlemen by the name of Bob Rowe.He was the captain of the chief commanda,which is a large tour boat on lake nippising that still runs to this day. He ran a small private fishing operation out of his cottage.We only went once in october,the other 15-20 times I was there was for ice fishing.We had to fly in for that because there was no other way except for occasionally when the lake was good enough for snow machines,but between pressure cracks and slush that was rare.We flew in on a cessna with skis that took off from trout lake airport east of North Bay. The october trip was my first trip to the area.I was a postal worker in those days,we caught tons and tons of nice walleye and descent 8-10 lb pike.I was actually fishing with one of my supervisors from the post office,his name was Rick.He tied into a pike of about 12 lbs ,I got it into the boat for him and he said,Daly,is someone punching your card today? I said yes.He great.You deserve it.By punching my card he was referring to my ghost being at work and me being in the boat landing his fish for him when I should have been at work. Anyhow it was the ice fishing that was spectacular in those days.The limit was six and there was no slot limits.Remember this was 40 years ago and the thinking was different. I still have slides of walleye ,frozen solid piled up like cordwood along with limits of pike and cardboard boxes full of ciscoes and whitefish. We used to catch ling 10-12 lbs just by moving off the underwater mound we were catching walleye on. It was spectacular.Then the fish started to thin out.It was right thru the river system.Bob was saying it was a combination of netting and the ministry screwing with the water levels. He then sold the cottage and I have never been back to the area. There was another lodge almost directly across from the cottage called Keystone lodge.It was run by Keystone Bill. I think I will have to visit this place again.Just for the memories. If I get some of those old slides transferred to digital I will post some. Ektachrome ,and Kodachrome.I have tons of pictures of this place in the winter."
