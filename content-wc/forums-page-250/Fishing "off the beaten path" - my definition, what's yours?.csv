4260026,bigwillies,2015-10-12 17:58:00,515,Ya. Think we've all bin there.
4267082,Baseline,2015-10-16 04:56:00,3207,"Intent to poach an extra fish or so is a lot different than a mistake. Sure you might get a ticket and pay a fine, but an honest mistake isn't the end of the world. I've ended up with an extra fish in the live well before due to a miscount. I've ended up with one or two less for the same reason. Now WC where are the comments about ""Fishing off the beaten path""?"
4332954,mkaz,2015-11-20 14:34:00,16,"I love, love, love this type of fishing.My version is normally similar to the OP's. The difference is that I don't have a true offroad vehicle, so that limits me a bit, but I'll take the logging roads in also, normally off 105 up near Perrault Falls.I use a porta-bote, which is light, assembles quickly and is more comfortable and durable than a blow up. It holds 2 guys and plenty of gear with no problems. You can launch this thing from anywhere and moving it over beaver dams or through the woods is no issue whatsover.On the last trip up we launched into a stream, ran down it into a lake, went through that lake to another stream to a second lake, through that to another stream, had to drag 3 beaver dams to get through that stream and then we were in the good stuff. we've also portaged overland using game trails to get into other places.When you get on these lakes you hammer the daylights out of 'em.It is a lot of work, no doubt, relative to having a camp boat and heading from your cabin to that boat and back, but, IMO, it is beyond worth it. No other boats, and once you get on the fish it is a total turkey shoot. There are also musky, northern, smallies and, in some of these, lake trout.My theory is simple, the harder it is to get to the less people will do it. Less people normally equals more fish, and more cooperative fish as well, so I'm happy as a clam to do the work to get to these places.I've seen other groups come with ATV's, take those down the logging roads and then hop on those, chop deadfall etc. to get to really hard to reach spots. I haven't done that, but only because I don't have a use for the ATV's aside from that yearly excursion and therefore don't have the ATV's to make that happen or I'd be all over it.only way to fly, as far as I'm concerned. Love it, love it, love it!"

4245082,1K1MOA,2015-10-05 18:00:00,90,"I have seen a few posts on here about guys wanting to fish lakes off the beaten path, so I thought I would share my view on that topic. Enclosed are a couple of pics from our mid-September trip this year in the Nakina area where we added a few new brush scrapes to the Xterra, created some new turn-arounds at the end of some logging roads, dragged the boat to the water over floating bogs, used the winch on the truck to pull the boat back to the trailer, and then pull the trailer and boat out with the winch until at a point on the logging roads where it could be hooked back up to the truck. The pics attached show going in to one of these lakes on what was a very old logging road, winching the boat back and my buddy with the fish we kept to take home. There were two of us, and we only kept what we ate for the day and these fish were the exception that went home. We threw back lots of fish. The lake these pics were from had a MAXIMUM depth of maybe 12' and was averaging 8' over most of it. Big wild rice flats 1 to 2 feet deep that we had to go through to get into the lake. We were hitting Walleye about every two minutes in the middle of the day. One of them hit a 6"" Crocodile spoon with a heavy wire leader my buddy threw out for Northerns. Does that break a few of your preconceived ideas about fall Walleye fishing? Did we catch fish? Tons of them! We fished lakes I bet few have fished given what we went through to get a boat on them. We also fished a couple that were deserted but we could just back a boat up into the water since there was access off the road. I am planning to make a new rack for next season, that will be back two feet from the xTerra with rollers (mounted in the class 3 hitch in my Shrockworks bumper), a mount on the rack (in-between the vertical rack post and SUV) for the outboard, so we can go in without a trailer! A lightweight (125#) 14 footer is going on top to give us even more access where we just can't go the distance needed, or through the rough terrain, with a trailer. The winch on front has a mount post to run the Spectra rope (not wire cable) over the top, so I will be able to just pull the boat up there with the wireless remote. I am 55 and my buddy is 58, and I am very thankful to God we physically can still do this kind of stuff, but I always look for the easy way. That is my definition of ""off the beaten path"", what's yours?"
4245370,dutchboy,2015-10-05 19:15:00,5717,"WOW, far more then I could or would want to do. Thats the beauty of Canada, something for everybody. Well done guys."
4245474,Seanik,2015-10-05 19:39:00,218,Looks like 9 walleyes for 2 guys?
4245498,1K1MOA,2015-10-05 19:46:00,90,"Mistakes do happen, see explanation below."
4245586,Bill Krejca,2015-10-05 20:25:00,6107,"Interesting, would like to see some more pictures. Can't beat fun! Bill"
4245746,Seanik,2015-10-05 21:38:00,218,"[QUOTE=1K1MOA;4245498]Good count Seanik, we already had one from the previous day filleted with skin for going back to WI (our eyes were bigger than our stomach that day), so the nine in the pic made for a total of five fish each. We were leaving the next day, that is why we kept the fish from this lake.[/QUOTE, Please correct me if I'm wrong but I read the Ontario walleye possession limit reg. as 4 walleyes per person. Walleyes caught on previous days or walleyes in the cooler or refrig count against this limit. I would appreciate someone more versed in the Ontario regs. to clear this possession limit law up"
4245922,Baseline,2015-10-06 05:16:00,3207,"I 've done many of the same off the road trips, but that boat has sailed for me. 35 years ago a buddy and I started fishing the lakes off of the Cedar Narrows Rd just north of Fort Francis, ONT. Some of the lakes had boat access, but most didn't. We had to bushwhack some trails into some of the lakes, walked up creeks full of deadfalls, and dragged boats, sport boats and canoes into many of those lakes. Rarely was the fishing better than some of the drive to lakes where I could launch a boat, but the adventure of getting into a lake that most people wouldn't bother with was satisfying enough and are great memories. I just got back from one of those lakes where the MNR has since built a boat launch, but the road going back to it is rutted and has several washouts. Over four days we never saw another boat and no other vehicles were parked at the launch. Fishing was excellent for walleye, pike and smallmouth. Regs --- Ontario is a huge province and fish limits vary from none to eight depending on where you are and if you are staying at a resort or not."
4246082,bigwillies,2015-10-06 06:47:00,515,[QUOTE=Seanik;4245746]You are correct. Daily catch limit is 4 per day and possession limit is 4 per person. That would have been a good fine had they got checked.
4246162,1K1MOA,2015-10-06 07:15:00,90,"It shows the importance of no matter how much homework you think you have done, to actually carry the regs and look at them again before you leave on the trip and during your trip. I am in shock on this. I must have reconciled in my mind over time 4 under 18"" with only 1 over 18"" and added them together in my mind over time, which was a HUGE mistake! I should have memorized as 4 total, 1 over 18"". I have prided myself to being to the letter of the law all of my life. wow. My SOP in the future will be to make sure everyone with me also knows the regulations so no mistakes happen. My buddy looked at me as the leader who knew the rules and didn't check them himself, in the future everyone will be responsible to know them. I am embarrassed but appreciate my error being pointed out, thank you."
4258514,zeebee,2015-10-12 07:43:00,1144,"""I have prided myself to being to the letter of the law all of my life. wow""Really? Confessing that would be more embarrassing than publicly proclaiming one's reading skills suck. Ahhh, probably go hand in hand."
