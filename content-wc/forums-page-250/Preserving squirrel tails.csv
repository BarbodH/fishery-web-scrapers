My buddy and I have access to some terrific squirrel woods. I'm thinking it won't be difficult to collect a bunch of tails. I've noticed that commercially prepared squirrel tails have the bone left in the tail. How does one preserve a squirrel tail? I've done many deer tails (bone removed) using a blend of pickling salt and borax. Many thanks...."

It is difficult to remove the bone from a squirrel tail, so, unlike with deer tails, I just bury the bone-in squirrel tail in a combo of salt and borax for maybe a week or so. As there is a very small amount of flesh in the tail, the mixture seems to suck out the moisture enough to permanently preserve it. The tail can then be washed(and dried before bagging) to remove the mixture and any other grime. I prefer grey squirrel tails over fox (if you want a challenge, try hitting a grey on the run with a .22 - they seem to never stop!). Bill"

4340290,Richard B,2015-11-24 20:35:00,735,I still squirrel hunt. I especially like grey's. I just don't like messing with the tails anymore. Not enought bang for the buck.
