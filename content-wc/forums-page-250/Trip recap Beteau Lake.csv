4246914,tsquared,2015-10-06 11:35:00,57,"Sorry for: 1) the late post, I wrote the report (July 18 - 25) but with photos it was too large to post. 2) the length, it is really our trip story 3) it alludes to photos which I had to take out to post - attached a handful of photos We have a group of 10 going. Myself, my three boys, Mike, Dan & Timmy, Lee from KC, Clint from Austin, Chandler, Ben, Joe and Chris (original KC). The trip begins with Joe getting the Van on late Thursday afternoon. I assume all goes well as I hear nothing from Joe. Lee gets in from KC that night to meet Joe. At the same time I am picking up Clint from the Airport (in from Austin, TX). I have a cooler of cold ones ready for Clint and I am not thinking through the fact that Clint has probably indulged in a couple of Jack's on the flight (he has..though he managed to lose his free drink tickets). Oldest son Mike gets in earlier that day too after a long time out on the road (OTR driver). My middle son Dan, getting married in September, has scheduled tuxedo fittings since we will all be in. We run by the house, grab Mike and head for the tux fitting. Youngest son Timmy meets us there (student at Mo State, working the summer for city of Branson). Tux fitting done, we head back as I need to get remaining items organized and packed (I did groceries, have extra tackle and rods for the boys). Clint wants some of his favorite Pasta, so we head to Massa's (of course). Clint orders a Jack on ice and I swear he must have told them a double or triple. It is about a 5 finger drink. Not content he orders a second one which he tries to partially pawn off on me I pass. Eventually we get home and I continue my final organization. Timmy and his buddy show up. Next thing I know the buddy's Dad is there and I am being called upstairs for shots the packing is not going well. Ruth is trying to cook some food for us on the trip, so I corral everyone outside and crank up the fire pit. Clint is in full mode now. I am really struggling to get organized, but wrap up around 11 and go outside for a beverage. At midnight I call it a night as everyone is arriving at 6AM. Not really sure when the others made it to sleep. I amazingly get up early and start moving some more items to the garage. We are actually in pretty good shape. Everybody gets up and Clint seems no worse for the wear. Everybody is basically on time. We have a lot of **** to get in the van. Ruth gets up and makes us an awesome breakfast burrito combo as we load the vehicle. The wives are doubting our ability to get everything and everyone in the vehicle. I am feeling confident as Clint can pack a vehicle. We succeed and off we go a few minutes after 7AM. We spot a rainbow as we leave and assume that is a good sign though Chandler believes it may be a different sign. We make it to the Beaver Motor Motel, easy Lee it is named after the animal, around 2AM (we lose an hour on changing time zones); not exactly what we had in mind, but 3 hours of sleep is 3 hours of sleep. Before my alarm goes off, Joe comes in and says time to go as there is heavy fog. I am in a heavy fog and sleep through the majority of the drive. All I hear is that we pass a bear and a moose, but I am happy sleeping. We stop at the local gas station and pick up 4 dozen eggs and last second drinks, etc. We make it to Nakina around 8am and weigh our gear, etc. We are of course over by 100lbs (54 pounds due to our beer order not being completely filled). We quickly pull off a case of beer (knowing there is some bud light at camp that we can always drink if necessary), gallon (or 2) of oil, 1 bag of potatoes, eliminate the cooler and are done in minutes. They start to pack the planes, we get our fishing licenses and it may not even be 8:30am yet. Smooth, efficient, these guys are great and the best I have seen. With 10 people we take two different flights in. Obligatory dock shot below. On the way up everyone shared our worst stories relating to having to crap, etc. Unfortunately for me the pasta from Thursday is not sitting well. I hit the outhouse twice before the flight, but realize I may not make it and may create one of the worst stories ever. On the flight I am debating what I would do and ultimately decide I would crap in Joe's man bag if necessary. However, with no ventilation, that would make for a difficult flight for all. Luckily for me, and all involved, I safely make it. We land, unload everything and are greeted by Eddie and tow all the gear up to the cabins. I personally love the setup. Rustic, one main area to cook and hang out, but separate sleeping quarters. There is wifi if you want to search it out (I didn't) and satellite TV which I could do without, but we turned on the Cardinals one night. We got all the rods together and load the boats and are out on the water before you know it. It is apparent the bugs are going to be special, even by Canada standards, on this trip as they greet us immediately. It seems like each year the pike are required to put on a show in the first few minutes of a trip  whether it is a t-bone, a breaking of the rod, something. Well we only had one complete Greenhorn, my oldest son Mike, and he got welcomed to Canadian fishing. First 5 minutes and Mike has a 35+ fish, line breaks (poorly tied?) and one slopmaster gone. Within 5 minutes another 35+ bites his fluorocarbon leader (50lb- I like 125lb) in two and two slopmasters are gone. Incredibly a 3rd big fish bites on a silver minnow and he has his first big pike, a 37.5 (he'll get better with that hold, but pretty **** good for your first 35 minutes in Canada). Mikes new name is the slop-disaster. This spot is on fire and Joe (below left) catches a 30, 33 & 35. Dan (above right) follows up with a 39.5 in the same spot and a 30 and Clint throws in a 34 (above). We do some exploring and head up river, fishing as we go. Chandler and I head out together and are catching fish, but nothing big. Chandler is throwing top water and it is fun to watch them hammer it. The bays are incredibly shallow and it takes some getting used to in terms of navigating. We prefer to fish the areas with some depth as the large shallow areas are producing small pike. The wind is picking up and we decide to do some walleye fishing to gather dinner. Somewhat spotty, but definitely enough to have a full meal. It is becoming obvious we are going to get stormed off the lake so we head back as the wind begins to pick up and we finish in a driving rain. We make our first walleye meal and go pan fried with Lee & Clint doing the cooking honors as the fryer wasn't hot enough and we are beat from the travel (Eddie comes down and fixes the next morning for us). So day 1, not bad, nothing huge, but plenty of 30+. We have one great pike spot, but haven't really had any time to truly explore much. Day 2  First full day and it is a mixed bag. A little sun and clouds early, then primarily windy and rainy and then finishing calm. I am fishing with Dan and on the honey hole in the early afternoon and my slop gets hammered. I immediately call for the cradle and the pike is relatively behaved after a couple of runs and Dan (he has netted some fish for me) does a great job on the cradle. It is a hog, a fat 45. Biggest Pike by group ever. Ben nails a 34, I get a 30 and then Timmy within 10 minutes goes back to back on a 32 and 38. The 38 is FAT. The weather is deteriorating and we head the confluence of the Attawapiskat and a smaller river. Clint and Joe are on a walleye hole just hammering them. Swimbaits, crankbaits, jigs, whatever they wanted pulling out 50+/- fish over several hours of fishing including joe with a 31 Pike (no leader). We jump in and pimp their action, but they definitely have the routine down. Tons of current, complicated by wind and if you go too far, rocks, etc. Dan and I sneak in on the action with a couple decent Walleye. I look forward to all of the Walleye dinners and tonight is no different. Tornadoes on the grill. Every evening ends about the same, calm and beautiful. I get the honors on the grill and wear a full rain suit to keep the bugs off of me. Day 3  Difficult to say where day 3 starts and day 2 ends. A monster storm comes in overnight. I wake up at 3:30am and am worried about the boats filling up, blowing away, you name it. Clint, Dan and Timmy are still up at the main cabin playing cards and darts. Somehow it clears up at 4AM and Timmy, Clint & Dan went down to the beach to look at the stars. The milky way was bright and there were shooting stars all over. Dan proclaims, Man, the only thing that would make this cooler would be to hear a wolf howl, at which point a wolf howls on cue. The three of them stay on the beach until they start hearing wolf howls on a couple different sides of camp. As they are on the side of beach near where the Moose get cleaned they scamper back to the cabin. The morning is windy and starts out clear and deteriorates again pretty quickly. Needless to say everyone does not make an early start on the water. After bailing the boat, Chris and I still get out around 8am and I have a monster strike. Biggest strike of the week for me and I am thinking it is bigger than the 45. Turns out to be a 35pike with some attitude. We run into Joe and Lee as we head to the walleye hole who casually mention catching a 31 what he doesn't immediately mention is it is a 31 WALLEYE. What a hog! Group's biggest walleye ever. This was on the outer edge of honey hole where the water dropped off and he threw a flicker shad as he was floating towards main point and immediately knew he had a special fish. Cook throws in a 30, 30 & 31 Pike. Mike catches a 30. Chandler, above, a 39.5 and Dan below a 31, 39 and 39.5  he just can't break that 40 (we'll talk about the hold later .). Chris got his first 30 catching a pike on a jig and ultra light in swift current. It was not an easy battle, but a successful one. Timmy was in a foul mood and went out about 10:20pm and was able to get an attitude adjustment as once again we had a beautiful evening If we could just get some consistent weather, I think we could really bank some numbers though our largest walleye and pike ever are nothing to complain about. We had beer battered walleye, Onion Rings and fried potatoes, unbelievably good. Clint got the frying honors with Lee handling the rings and batter prep. Day 4 - finally we wake up to a beautiful morning. We decide to make a run to upper part of lake/river where we hadn't quite successfully made. Unfortunately, the nice weather lasts 30 minutes and it becomes absolutely miserable. Wind 30-40mph, 50 degrees, some rain, it is brutal. Tired of not seeing the entire area we all decide to go to other end of system. Ben and I really battle the elements and get in a few places where we can fish and are actually catching fish, but its work. We still don't make it all the way to end of system, but start to work our way back. We stop at a small inlet and chandler/Chris pull up and ask if there's any cabbage, nope, they keep moving. First cast a fish rocks the water 10 feet from where my lure lands. I tell benny to hit the spot, but with the wind neither of us gets within 10 feet. I move in eventually and fish near the spot and roll the slop under water and he hammers it. A nice 40 to reward us for working really hard. We catch up to Chandler/Chris a few minutes later and tell them the good news/bad news, no cabbage, but one 40 pike (turns out there was cabbage there, we just couldn't see it with the wind and rain). Chandler hits a 33, but not much happening as some came back with barely a cast. Awesome to just hang out and relax though as we are in Canada. We eat our only meal we brought, steaks, bake some cookies on the grill. Joe whips up a bowl of Pico which in theory could last a month (barely makes 3 days). Huge dart tourney. Life is good. Day 5 - We wake up to an absolutely beautiful day. A little north wind, but not terrible. Timmy and I go out to the honey hole and Benny / Dan are working it over. Benny nails not only a 40(left), but a 41 (right) before 10am. Awesome hold too. It is so nice, I really don't care about the fishing (ok, that's a huge exaggeration). Finally though without battling cold, wind and rain I realize just how beautiful it is and have just an awesome day in the boat. We have a couple Canadian pops and really enjoy the weather, scenery, company and fishing. Life is really good. The others are making up for lost time. Chris and Joe go Gator hunting in the morning catching some fish & go to the rock reef around the corner and Chris spots a huge pike laying by the reef. Lures start flying trying to stir up the fish and five minutes later Chris bangs his first 40. Joe is reluctantly happy to help anther Greenhorn to their first 40 (before Joe has his). Clint then challenges the big pike # and hammers a 44 on the honey hole with an in-line spinner. What a beast. Clint admits he was tempted to tell me it was 45.5, but he doesn't pimp me. Joe pulls a 31 trolling and Lee chips in with a 31 too. Chandler and Mike go out at 10pm and Chandler adds a 30.5. Foiled fish burritos, I get the honors, are the dinner and are awesome with the Pico. Day 6 - Chandlers B-Day Chandler goes out with Ben early, like before 6am, and catches a 30 and 31. Mike and I go out at 8'sh and nail a 39 pretty early (I can't stretch this to 40, though I tried). We come back and have b-fast at 10am. Ben makes the biscuits and gravy and they are awesome. We have to bake the biscuits on the grill, but that works fine. Since the weather has been so bad, we have done no shore lunches and have plenty of oil. I decide to take the extra biscuit dough and make donuts. Rolled in sugar and cinnamon they are great and bring back memories of when the boys were small and Ruth would make them. Chris and Clint go out and Clint nails a 34.5 at the hole where Chris hit his 40. Clint hits two 31 pike. They have some boat issues and anchor up and hammer 30+ walleye. Clint gets a 22 walleye , but they miss two big pike. Mike and I make a wrong turn and end up in a bay. As I check the map to figure out how I screwed it up I realize we're on a massive cabbage patch. We cast and I hit a 31 first cast. We FINALLY make it to the end of the system and it is nice. Mike hooks up and I have a massive rolling hit and tell Mike to get the net, who replies I have a fish, I tell him I don't give a #$%^$. Mine pops off. Clearly the fish gods didn't appreciate my net comment. Mike is fishing a spoon and has no idea about this fish as it is now tangled in the weeds. Eventually he pulls out a 31 and I miss what would have been a nice double 30. Mike does get a nice weedline walleye on a spoon which is snacking on a pike while I do some topwater. It is late and we continue to fish but have to head back as we are having buffalo walleye over fettuccine. I know it gets old saying it, but I am talking fantastic. This may be my favorite. Ben fixes the fettucine, Clint/Lee fry the fish and Cook does the Buffalo. We invite Eddie and his wife Shirley down for dinner and enjoy hearing Eddie's stories. Day 7 I feel like the trip has just started as we have just begun to be able to explore the area, but its day 7. Dan and Chandler go out before 6am. Chandler hits a 38 (which is identical to Timmy's 38 some would say the same fish ). We have b-fast at 10am eggs, peppers, sausage, potato pancakes all really good. We head all the way to end of system. I always end the trip with Clint, my former neighbor, who is now in Austin TX. Joe goes out with Timmy who has promised college stories in return for his donation to Timmy's campaign (he ran for VP of student council at College). While sworn to secrecy, a few stories emerge at dinner. Timmy is clearly enjoying the college experience. I learn some new terms on the trip, Dutch Rudder (WTF), etc. I don't mind getting old though, beats the alternative (as Jack Buck said, I don't look forward to b-days anymore, but I sure don't want to miss any). Clint and I work over the upper area. I have a nice rollover, but no hookup. Clint bangs a 34. We hit Clint and Chris' walleye hole and catch dinner. Joe somehow concentrates on fishing and hits a 35. Lee and Ben go out and catch lots of fish with Lee getting a 30 and 31. We have the tornadoes and Cajun fried fish for dinner and go ahead and make donuts as dessert. The dinners are amazing. Somehow I have been anointed the grill *****. I would take it as a compliment, but I think the real answer is the bugs were so bad, they stuck me outside. I didn't mind as I enjoy grilling. Even if it is biscuits, cookies, etc. Overnight the Wolves sound very close behind my Cabin (I was closest to the Moose cleaning area) howling away. Needless to say any pissing off the deck was on an emergency and expedited basis only. Starting Home We pack everything up and wait for the flight home. I go out with one rod and catch a last walleye and then cast off the dock for a final Pike. I make the mistake of agreeing to go on the second plane. It shows up loaded with timber and oil barrels. Luckily two youngsters came on the flight before and are there to do much of the heavy lifting. We take the flight home and Mike, who finished off his bottle the prior night has a bumpier flight in back. Meanwhile, the pilot doesn't really know what to think of Chandler . Sleep comes easy in the vehicle on the way home once Clint gets his foot odor under control. Once we re-enter the US Joe tells us that Enterprise said the van couldn't leave the US when he went to pick it up. This was after we each had multiple and separate conversations confirming it COULD go to Canada. RECAP A great trip with a great group. Everyone chipped in doing something whether cleaning fish, cooking, cleaning, etc. First time with all three of my boys. I told them if I ever die on a trip to throw me in the freezer and keep fishing. Recap was it was difficult weather. Storms, rain, wind, cold the first 4 days and then 90 degrees (welcome to Canada, though this late in July its usually pretty stable). Tough part was we didn't get a chance to truly understand the water until day 5. Nonetheless, biggest walleye ever at 31, biggest pike ever at 45. Multiple new personal records. As the water gets shallower, tougher to navigate and find fishable water, but a beautiful area with massive fish. I wondered what it would be like with Eddie at camp as having someone else at an outpost was different to me. Reality is there was no difference. Great guy, he's there when you need him (fix fryer, boat) and we invited him to dinner and he was truly enjoyable to be with. I think the camp is great. Different sleeping areas is nice. We had outhouses, but that doesn't really bother me. It's Canada so I expect different weather and tough bugs, but the bugs were REALLY TOUGH and enjoyed burrowing in our skin. I thought we may have to declare them at the border. Our buddy Jack the groundhog says until next time.."

4247890,new hips,2015-10-06 17:01:00,498,Sounds like a great trip....Beteau is a special place.Thanks for a detailed and funny report.
4248378,Pikeslayer8,2015-10-06 20:04:00,1460,"Love it T2! Really glad you didn't get off the plane to have to say ""Hey Eddie, just chit my drawers. Ya got a deep hole I could bury the evidence"". Good to hear you guys enjoy the Buffalo Walleye. Nice report, great pics and a trip well done."
4249066,Bakefish,2015-10-07 07:46:00,1077,Great report.
4253498,rnnonmt,2015-10-08 19:44:00,992,Great report Tim. Would you say it was better fishing there compared to NE Lac Seul?
4254002,tsquared,2015-10-09 06:58:00,57,"Wow, great question. In terms of fishing for large pike Beteau was better. On walleye, we caught a monster 31"", and could certainly find Walleye steadily, but Lac Seul probably better for consistent size. Each trip is different and offers different aspects. I love Lac Seul as you can catch BIG musky, BIG pike, Big Walleye and Big smallmouth and explore endless water. I also really enjoyed Lake of Woods. We had not done a fly in for a few years and this year I was looking for the full seclusion with a chance for big fish, so it was spot on."
4273898,EddieNorth,2015-10-20 09:41:00,32,"Im glad you guys had a good time that's what its all about.Thank you very much for the dinner for me and Shirley it was great,the walleye with the Buffalo sauce was second to none its now my favourite way to eat walleye.Thank you very much for your business we appreciate it as always,until next time,,,Cheers,Eddie"
4278394,HeHooksHimself,2015-10-22 08:37:00,725,Thanks for sharing that one. You write well and I felt like I was right there with you. Maybe Mike could include this in his mag as a contributing writer? Nicely done. Fish On Hooks
4280378,go dart,2015-10-23 09:48:00,77,Am I the only one who'd give his left snut to fish with this guy? Just don't know which would be best. The fishing or the storys. Thanks!
4324274,Weby13,2015-11-16 10:47:00,57,Great report! I love Eddies place! There's some monsters lurking in the Attawapiskat!!!
