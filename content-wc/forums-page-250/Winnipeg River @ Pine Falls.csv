4247570,mrwalleye5,2015-10-06 15:20:00,1922,"Slow, Slow. That WAAM tournament last Saturday yielded a 25"" fish or something as biggest out of 37 boats. Small ones are starting to come in in some numbers. Big girls are taking their time. I'm thinking I might head out near November if the weather holds like the weatherman is predicting."
4298410,Royalcourt12,2015-11-02 12:15:00,1,"Heading to the Red this week, how is the fishing been, it's been about 4 years since I was last there."
4299010,cbprov,2015-11-02 17:53:00,1010,fishing has been good to excellent
4299762,mrwalleye5,2015-11-03 06:55:00,1922,"Lot of big walleye being caught this year. Not so much at Pine Falls though. Lots of fish, just not as many big girls being caught as there is in the Red."
4311866,freespoolin,2015-11-09 19:28:00,472,Big fish at Pine Falls? Caught Nov 7th and 9th.
4209834,luv2huntnfish,2015-09-17 19:44:00,73,"Is anything happening early? What are the water conditions, level, current? Any reports welcomed as I am looking forward to heading up that way as the water temps drop."
4211530,freespoolin,2015-09-18 15:28:00,472,"Water temp at Pine Falls is 65F, 1 gate is open so there is some current. Water level is normal."
4211626,mrwalleye5,2015-09-18 16:04:00,1922,Heading out onto Big Windy tomorrow in the Pine Falls area. Hopefully get out a few times this week. I will report.
4213842,mrwalleye5,2015-09-19 15:55:00,1922,"As expected...slow... Out on the lake, anchored caught a few 17"" greenbacks and a few smaller. Pulled spinners nothing. Drum, drum and more drum. As the day wore on they kept getting bigger. Terrific fight.Had worse days this time of the year on Traverse Bay. Each week it will get better. Probably won't get out again as wind forecast is brutal."
4226066,luv2huntnfish,2015-09-26 08:51:00,73,"Any new updates, water temperature, flow? Are the commerical and local nets out in numbers?"
4226338,mrwalleye5,2015-09-26 15:59:00,1922,"Water temp is around 63-64 degrees. Minimal flow. 1/4 oz jig at the mouth of the bay and you have no problem contacting bottom. Was out this past Wednesday. 16-17"" greenbacks in not bad numbers. Did catch one 25"" greenback. Did see one local net but that's it."
4233274,luv2huntnfish,2015-09-30 14:44:00,73,Bumped to the top for Balzy. Special thanks to mrwalleye5 for the updates that have been provided. Please keep the updates coming as I am ready to head up upon the arrival of the greenbacks.
4235538,freespoolin,2015-10-01 17:33:00,472,there are walleye tournaments at Pine Falls for the next three weekends so we'll soon find out if the walleye are there.
4235618,luv2huntnfish,2015-10-01 17:56:00,73,What tourney is this coming weekend? Is this a new tournament? I know that the Voyagers and Frickland Memorial were typcially the 2nd and 3rd weekends of the month.
4235962,mrwalleye5,2015-10-01 20:43:00,1922,It's just a little tournament put on by Waam...whoever that is?
