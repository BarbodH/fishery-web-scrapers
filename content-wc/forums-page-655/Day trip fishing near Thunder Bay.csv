I was thinking about filling the idle time after we leave the motel (about 6 hours) by taking a half day fishing trip somewhere nearby. We won't have a boat, and so will be looking to do some shore fishing (so probably looking at streams) from somewhere fairly accessible to the casual angler. Anyone have any suggestions? We're not picky about species in this case. There will be just two of us. Thought about Kekabaka Falls provincial park since it's in the direction we'll be heading out of T.B (west), but don't know if there is much opportunity for bank beating there."

However, there are plenty of fishing opportunities around Stanley (between T.Bay and Kakebeka), or you could try around the train bridge just West of Kakebeka at Sunshine."
565363,Greg @ ABL,2007-05-17 07:15:00,23,"When looking for a place to try, look at larger rivers. Things are very dry in that area, and smaller streams are a trickle right now, this time of year they should be full and rushing. Some good rains are really needed in many areas of Northern Ontario. Have a great trip! All the best, Greg Bolinski Agate Bay Lodgewww.agatebaylodge.com NPAA #944"
565369,Guest,2007-05-17 10:27:00,0,Fish the bridge on Hwy 61 at the Kaministiqia River. Close and lots of action. You can also fish at the end of Mountdale Ave where it runs into the Kam. Public access point and a good dock to fish from' It's called the Neste boat launch. Good luck....
565409,north_alabama,2007-05-18 08:23:00,172,"Thanks, all, for the responses. Lots of good ideas to try out. What are the general rules for parking when fishing these types of places along highways? Is parking allowed off the shoulder of the road?"
565414,Guest,2007-05-18 09:19:00,0,"I know (in regards to the previous person's message) that you cannot park on Highway 61 to fish under the bridge on the Kaministiqua - and I am not sure about the other of his suggestions; however, the suggestion I made to fish by the train bridge at Sunshine (just West of Kakebeka) comes with the added benefit of a side road and/or an opening to park off the highway. So you would have no worries. All I ask for this info. is for you to respect the area(s) you fish, and take whatever garbage you may have with you. Cheers, J."
565415,north_alabama,2007-05-18 09:24:00,172,"Thanks J. Not a problem, will leave behind only footprints, and we actually tend to collect up any trash we find near the water (as long as the place hasn't been completely trashed by someone else to begin with, we do want to spend part of our time fishing)."
