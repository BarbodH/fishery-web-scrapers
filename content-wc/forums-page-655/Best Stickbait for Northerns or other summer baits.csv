564883,joeman79,2007-05-01 19:58:00,417,Just want to poll all you Pike-a-holics on what your favorite stickbaits or crankbaits are. We are going 1st week of august. Might not be prime time for pike. On previous trips We just smoked nice pike on a Bomber Magnum Long A In a gold chrome with black back and a little orange. But that was YEARS ago. Just want to get ya'alls input. Walleyes Biting at Wilson Res. here in KS.

At Lac Seaul I have done real well with it and the fun thing is you never know if its a walleye, smallmouth or northern when you get a hit. Any wind blown rocky point is worth a few casts. 37 days, but who is counting. IA Walleye"
564896,Kansaseye,2007-05-02 11:26:00,6,"Hey Joeman79, We usually do OK on #5 Mepps Black Fury, large Jointed Rapalas, or 8"" - 10"" plastic minnows. We don't really target pike - mainly there for the walleye and smallies. Where you headed in August? I'm heading to Lac Seul the end of August also. Good to hear they are biting at Wilson. Has the lake level come up much? Last time I was there the lake was pretty low. I'm heading to Lovewell this weekend. We live in Jamestown if you know where that is. 70 -80 miles northwest of Wilson. Kansaseye"
564907,joeman79,2007-05-02 23:13:00,417,"Kansaseye I am in Downs. Got a buddy who went to Lovewell today with 3 guys had 12 nice keeper walleyes. Wilson is still low but Saline is running good from all the snow in western Ks they say. Good friend went last weekend to wilson and him and another guy caught over 60 eyes and had limit of keepers + a 20"" Striper. By the way if your in Downs I own and Operate Myers Sporting and Supply. I probably know you LOL. And we are going to a lake 85 MIles east of Red Lake 65 Miles north of Lac Seul. Richardson Lake- Just north of Birch Lake. 89 Days Can't wait Joeman"

When I go after pike specifically, I usually use blue/silver or florescent orange/gold spoons or chartreuse/firetiger spinner baits. An all-chartruese crawler harness with chart rig floats gets the most pike of all, but it may be due to time in the water relative to the others."

Loud rattle, tough bill for bouncing off stuff, casts way better than sticks, and you can troll it fast, which can really produce. Use the big one, Good Luck"
565417,Guest,2007-05-18 09:58:00,0,"Personally, I use big @$$ musky baits for northern, and they produce. Plus they have the added bonus of being fun to fish, they tend to keep little fish off the hook (although admittedly, I have caught pike only a few inches longer than the bait itself), and they seem to produce a fair number of big fish (40''+). Suicks are my personal favorite; I am not overly concerned about the colour as I believe it is the action of these big baits that causes the fish to react - out of instinct, and not anything as subtle as the colour of the bait (granted, within reason - I do go more for the natural finishes). I will also qualify this by admitting that I am fishing Northern Ontario lakes that have an abundance of big fish, and little fishing pressure compared to many of the lakes 'down south'. Cheers, J. p.s. One also needs the appropriate equipment to 'throw' such baits... a definite consideration given the cost of both the baits, and a quality musky rod and reel."
