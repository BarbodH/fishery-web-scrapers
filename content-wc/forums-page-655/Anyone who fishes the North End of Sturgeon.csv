565224,Guest,2007-05-13 17:29:00,0,Glad it works for ya. Sure hope they don't lose anything up there.
565225,Catman59,2007-05-13 17:41:00,345,"It looks northish and if the wind stays , luck could be on their side !!! My fingers are crossed."
565226,Catman59,2007-05-13 19:05:00,345,"Update 8pm ......... Its calm. The fire is slowing down. Savant Lake is on notice , but nobody HAS to leave yet. Keep your fingers crossed :help: ."
565230,Guest,2007-05-13 21:28:00,0,Anyone hear anything on the Whiskey Jack's lodge? Can not get ahold of people running the camp as of yet. Maybe there is no camp left. Was going up the openner.
565253,Catman59,2007-05-14 15:39:00,345,Rain at Sturgeon !!!!!!!!!!! The cause of the fire was a derailed train east of Savant !!!!!!!!! It sounds like White Sands was spared !!!--------- a few prayers must have helped !!!:thanks2:
565260,guidedfishing,2007-05-14 19:25:00,531,Talked to Marty at silver dollar he indicated that White sands had to cancel its first week. All roads in the area have been closed and is travel by MNR permit only. All logging operations have also been suspended. He indicated a lot of smoke in the silver dollar area but we are still on for opening weekend. Will confirm on Thursday as to conditions and if we are a go. Indicated it is still very bad around the Savant lake area. I have no confirmation of anything other than the conversation with Marty. Heading out in 4 days. GF
565278,Behle,2007-05-15 13:32:00,51,I read on one of the MNR sites that Camp rd 700 that leads to Rusty Meyers was closed which is south of Savant Lake. That is one of the float plane businesses in the area. Our group flies out of Rusty's on the 16th of June. Hope that the area gets some rain. In the last couple of years we have seen some damage from high winds so I know that there is a lot of fuel for a fire.
565279,Guest,2007-05-15 13:48:00,0,Amen Brother. Literally.
565388,guidedfishing,2007-05-17 17:14:00,531,"Update from Silver dollar today, the fire near Savant appears to be nearly out, Marty says we are good to go, and it sounds like the camps to the north are open after all. Calling for possible rain and or snow Sunday and or Monday it doesn't get any better than that. Burning bans are still in effect. good luck all and have a safe trip. GF"
565210,Catman59,2007-05-12 21:53:00,345,"Got word from our camp owners today. Full evacuation , the whole NE side of Sturgeon is burnt or burning. The fire is moving 1kmh and basically out of control. It is a bad deal. The only hope is for a wind change or the camps will be consumed. Savant Lake is also in the path as of now. A BAD DEAL:censored:"
565211,Guest,2007-05-12 21:58:00,0,Not good!! My kids talked to the owners daughter the other day at whitesands camp and she spoke of a fire near by. Hope for rain!!!!
565212,Catman59,2007-05-13 05:23:00,345,"Thats just not good. I dont think rain is a choice , so they were hoping for a change in wind as their only hope."
565213,Guest,2007-05-13 07:02:00,0,"I hope the best for them, but i think that rain wouldn't hurt the situation any.http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/forec...?on-134&unit=i"
565214,Catman59,2007-05-13 07:52:00,345,The rain looks promising. Bad thing though---today is D Day
565215,Stehle,2007-05-13 08:13:00,95,"Sounds bad. My group flies out of Rusty Myers outpost for our fishing trip. So, we drive past a lot of this area, but I believe that this outpost is on Sturgeon. Does anyone have any information on this camp (and the operators, Chris and John)?"
565216,Guest,2007-05-13 08:31:00,0,google earth has a overlay for forest fires. The nearest fire yesterday was near the landing strip near trappers point. With the wind out of the S.E. maybe it will miss the whitesands camp. The village of savant lake is in its direct path.
565218,Catman59,2007-05-13 09:27:00,345,Can you give me a link to that map ?
565222,Guest,2007-05-13 12:38:00,0,You need google earth installed.http://maps.geog.umd.edu/firms/kml/ Then click on canada then run.
565223,Catman59,2007-05-13 17:06:00,345,Thanks......... it works good. They are evacuating Savant Lake right now
