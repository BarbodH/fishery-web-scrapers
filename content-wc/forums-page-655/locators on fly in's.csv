Cold batteries can have significantly less capacity than a warm one, and do not charge as effectively. It might be worthwhile to run a test to see how long the battery lasts in a warmer environment."
565400,Guest,2007-05-18 02:22:00,0,"Oops, Ignore that. I didn't notice retire55's post you were responding to, he already said it all, better than I did."
565371,retire55,2007-05-17 11:22:00,1029,"North_ala_unlogged: Thanks for the added info. Quite intriguing. Perhaps I should test the current draw on my sonar unit, a Lowrance X-85 I've had for 7 years. I've used the same 33 amp hour AGM battery all 7 years for any of the typical one week fishing trips I've taken (6 days actual fishing). I've never run out of power. Our typical fishing schedule while on trips involves the walleye dawn bite, breakfast, walleye or lake trout fishing during the day, dinner and lastly, the walleye evening/night bite. I'd estimate that my sonar unit is on about 10 hours per day. If I were on a 12 day trip, I have to use my sonar unit more judiciously. thunderatwork: According to the list of current draws I received, Eagle color sonars draw between 500 and 750 milliamps per hour (lights off). The LCX Lowrance models draw about 1 amp per hour (lights off). city boy: You might check with your outfitter wrt what size motor you will be using and whether or not it could be used to charge your battery. Honda representatives have assured me that my 15 HP four stroke Honda will output 1-2 amps at trolling speeds. However, without a regulator, some caution is required."
565372,Guest,2007-05-17 11:44:00,0,"I should get one of those 35A batteries. I could fish a month straight with it using my little unit. However, I don't know that the wife or the employer would go for that!"
565374,Guest,2007-05-17 11:51:00,0,"I don't have much to compare it too, except my old Fishmark 128, but I think the Fishmark 480 is a darn nice unit for what I do with it. I couldn't be happier, and the $$$ is pretty competitive. Of course, you don't get the GPS, color, and side imaging some of the big $$ units provide. But for me, those are not important. Depth, bottom hardness, thermocline is what I'm interested in (well, and those big fat hooks too, when I see them). 480 gives me all that. An aside, vertigal jigging lakers is a blast when the wind is low and you can see your jig on the sonar 60 ft down and watch the fish converge on it."
565377,Roddy,2007-05-17 12:58:00,488,I hate to High Jack the post but I have a similar question. If I bring up my 332 that draws 600 ma would a deep cycle battery give me enough juice for 5 days of fishing at 10 hours per day? I only get 5-6 hours out of the 12 volt 8 amp batteries when I go ice fishing and do not care to bring 10+ 8 amp batteries.
565378,thunderatwork,2007-05-17 13:16:00,79,"retire55, not sure what 750 milliamps means to me? the lights are usually on low setting as the screen is fairly dark. I'm not very electric smart"
565379,retire55,2007-05-17 13:38:00,1029,"thunderatwork: Most sonar units draw less than 1 amp/hour (or 1000 milliamps/hour). Rather than address current draw with decimals (e.g. 0.75 amps per hour), it's generally accepted to discuss the same current draw as 750 milliamps per hour. Just expressing the identical current draw in different units. Contact your sonar manufacturer and request the current draw for your sonar unit. Some manufacturers now include current draw in their user manuals (available on-line)."
565382,retire55,2007-05-17 14:27:00,1029,"Roddy: Firstly, batteries discharge more quickly in cold temperatures - see http://chemistry.about.com/od/howthi...oldbattery.htm For the sake of explanation, let's consider normal summer temps. A 12 volt 8 amp hour battery, fully charged, should theoretically provide 8000 milliamps of power. The current draw for the Lowrance 332 is 600 milliamps per hour (with sonar and lights on) or 6000 milliamps for a day with 10 hours of use. You would require 4 of these batteries (4 X 8000 = 32,000 milliamps of power) to get you through 5 days of fishing at ten hours each day (power requirement is 5 X 6000 = 30,000 milliamps). Four such batteries would weigh approx 24 pounds. Alternatively, you could purchase one Gel Cell deep cycle battery or one Absorbed Glass Mat deep cycle battery that is capable of providing the same amount of power. A 32 amp hour battery would weigh in the vicinity of 25 pounds. If you don't want to take four 8 amp hour batteries or one 32 amp hour battery, then you have to look at other options. Possibilities include using a solar panel to recharge one 8 amp hour battery while you use the other one or recharging your battery using the alternator on your outboard motor."
565383,retire55,2007-05-17 14:50:00,1029,"Joeman79: I've never been a fan of buying a sonar unit labeled as portable. IMHO, any sonar unit can be used in a portable configuration. The Cabela's web site shows the price of the Eagle Fishmark 480 Portable Soft Pack with temperature sensor at $250 and the price of the Eagle Fishmark 480 Sonar with temperature sensor and screencover at $200. Identical sonar units. The extra cost of the portable version provides you an 8 amp hour battery and a wall charger. If the Eagle Fishmark 480 is the sonar unit you want, I'd recommend buying the unit at $200 and then look after a carrying case and a power supply afterwards. This lets you make some decisions."
565387,Guest,2007-05-17 16:06:00,0,"One other thing, the portable comes with the suction cup-mounted transducer. Not sure if the regular one does. Need to get an adaptor kit for that if you don't get the portable, or come up with some other means to mount the transducer. I think you could mount it on a board and c-clamp it to the transom, might be a bit cheaper that way."
565395,Roddy,2007-05-17 20:58:00,488,"Retire55, Thanks for the info. I did use the locator on the opener this year with the 8 amp battery. Fished from 7:30 -12:00, put the battery on the charger and then fished with it again from 3:00 until it went dead at 6:00. Not sure why I did not get more hours out of it. I am considering using the deep cycle from my boat on the trip as we do not have a weight restriction. I would think that would give me plenty of juice for a 5 day trip."
565333,phishfearme,2007-05-16 14:09:00,1242,if these are 12V RECARGEABLE then you can use the solar panel at the cabin that are charging the 12V car batteries that run the cabin pump. the panels charge the batteries by generating a voltage greater than 12V (usually 13-14V). DO NOT however use the panels to charge anything less than a 12V rechargeable. i agree however with a previous post - your sounder must be a batterie hog. phish
565338,Guest,2007-05-16 16:01:00,0,"If your batteries are Gel Cell, be careful. If the battery is all the way run down, a high capacity (high current) charger could damage it. Some chargers for auto batteries also use a 20V voltage rather than the 13 or so that smaller capacity, current-limited, chargers work at. They do this to recharge a regular lead-acid battery quickly. The higher voltage will cause an even bigger current inrush into the smaller discharged battery. The gel cells can overheat, boiling the gel, and wrecking the battery. On the other hand, solar chargers usually can't dump a bunch of current in a hurry since they typically don't store charge (make sure the lighting batteries are disconnected if you want to try it). The generic rule of thumb is charge a gel cell at 10% of it's current capacity rating (700mA for a 7AH battery, for example, and a 10 hour charge time). You might be able to get away with twice that if you limit it to a couple hours at a time so the battery can cool off (tough to do if you're out fishing all day). I wouldn't do that with mine. I'd guess a roof full of panels run in parallel would put out at least a few amps on a sunny day, probably more. Have you asked the camp operator? They might know how to adapt their system safely, or maybe even have a low capacity output available for guests in your situation."
565339,lassh,2007-05-16 16:46:00,553,"I don't think most owners want you screwing around with their DC lighting systems; you could mess up your lights and the next group in as well. Bring a fresh battery and turn it off when you don't need it. You don't need to watch Canadian TV all day long. For sure, clear the procedure you plan to use with the camp operator before trying to charge your battery."
565344,retire55,2007-05-16 18:08:00,1029,"North_ala_unlogged Earlier this year, I requested and received a list of the current draws for the Lowrance/Eagle brand of sonar units. I'm unaware of which Eagle 480 sonar unit you have. The above mentioned list states the current draw for lights off as follows: Eagle FE 480 330 milliamps/hr Eagle FM 480 400 milliamps/hr Assuming 8 hours of use per day with the lights off, the FE 480 would draw 8 X 330 = 2640 milliamps per day. A 7 AH (7000 milliamps) battery would not last 3 complete 8 hour days. I'm not posting to start an argument. Rather, just checking on your sonar use info. Perhaps you have a Eagle 480 that draws even less current. city boy Whats the current draw for your vexilar? What size batteries do you intend to use to power your sonar unit? You could easily resolve your sonar power problem by giving up a case of beer in favor of a 25 pound Gel Cell or AGM (if you prefer) sealed battery. This size of battery should provide about 32 amp hours of power."
565351,Pooch,2007-05-16 21:08:00,4619,"An Eagle 320 will run 6 to 7 days on two fresh Duracell 6 volts (same as 8 Duracell ""D"" cells)as long as you don't use the light and turn it off when not needed. An old Zercom LCD flasher will run a couple of weeks on the same set of batteries. Too bad they quit making them.https://www.walleyecentral.com/photop...&ppuser=104366 Pooch"
565354,Guest,2007-05-17 03:12:00,0,"cityboy: I received the same information from eagle. I have the Fishmark 480. However, I ran some tests on my unit before the first time I took it up. I used a dc ammeter on my unit and measured the actual current draw at about 250 mA with the light on and about 180 mA with it off (Those numbers are from memory, I'll have to dig out my old notebook to double check). Also, the charger for my 12V batteries charges them up to just under 13V, giving an extra AH of capacity. I also ran some tests where I ran the unit continuously and watched the battery draw down. 8 D-cells lasted over 26 Hours before giving out, and the gel cells I ran for 28 hours and still hadn't run down below 11V (the unit operates down to 10). I've taken it up twice so far, and in both instances I had to switch batteries on after the seventh day. I don't run the unit continuously when I fish. So part of it is Eagle's conservative specs relative to my unit, part is the specifics of my charger, and part is the way I use it. That I use it 8-10 hours per 12 hour fishing days is also an estimate."
565365,retire55,2007-05-17 07:45:00,1029,Thanks for the explanation.
565367,thunderatwork,2007-05-17 10:17:00,79,"Last year i was going thru a set of batteries every day and 3/4. I don't remember my model, however it was the first year i had a color depth finder. The second trip up i took along some little homemade jumpers and jumped off of the 12 volt battery in the closet to recharge. worked great. Jump the 12 volt lead to the 12 volt battery. left it there all day. It can be frustrating to run out of batteries in the middle of a five day trip, on strange water."
565368,Guest,2007-05-17 10:25:00,0,"retire55: Still not the whole story, the 180ma was actually a ""peak"" current level measured during about a 4 hour period of operation, with about 140mA being an eyeball average. Also, thinking about it, I might have overstated the amount I actually run the sonar each day on average. Maybe 6-8 hours average is closer, with a ""busy"" sonar day (fishing lakers, or working midlake humps) might get up around 10+ hours. I use it when travelling unfamiliar areas, fishing ""structure"", and occasionally snooping for fish on flats. If we're anchored up I'll usually turn it off, or if we're trolling a weed edge or similar situation where the location can be better ascertained visually. Even with that the numbers don't quite add up, I know. I'm conservative by nature, so I take three batteries for 12-day trip, and am taking 2 for my 8-day trip this year. On the 12-day trips I've never used the third battery. I expect to maybe tap into the second battery on the 8-day this year, but maybe not. Even having some experience with batteries and chargers outside of portable sonars, this was immensely confusing for me the first year. I expected to drain all three batteries the first year, and was surprised to barely get into the second one. In the end, I'd much rather carry back a charged battery than run out early. I'd also hate for someone to run out of juice mid-trip because they listened to what I put here."

565306,Guest,2007-05-16 10:02:00,0,"Not familiar with that unit, but if it runs off 12V batteries, you could look into a 12V solar panel (the type used to keep marine/vehicle batteries topped off. If you are bringing more than one battery, you could alternate between batteries each day and partially recharge the one not in use, and maybe eek out another couple days. If you have the model that runs off of AA batteries, I'd just carry spares As far as using the camp's solar setup, I think it would depend on how they have it set up. The dc voltage might be too high to directly charge a lower voltage battery without the risk of damaging it. I always carry a second battery (12V 7AH for my Eagle 480), and drink a little less beer to account for the weight. What type of batteries do you use?"

Sounds like your sonar draws a lot more power than mine, although I really don't run it much more than 8-10 hours/day on average, and always make sure the light and sounds are off except the shallow alarm. If it were me, I'd think about a solar charger and alternating batteries each day and topping the one not in use. It's possible you could get by with two batteries that way if you minimize use, but three would be safer."
