565446,Fishful Thinker,2007-05-19 16:31:00,100,Mike what are the water levels like on the big lake?
565448,Guest,2007-05-19 18:58:00,0,"Lake levels are as low as I have ever seen them. 2003 was the last really low water year. The sand bars rise, fall and change, but It feels like the water may be lower now than in 2003 (I didn't check the historical graphs on lwcb.ca before I responded). We were forced to reconfigure docks this year, we can't drive through the sticks, you can walk to the pile without getting your feet wet, and you have to trim up to get over the first Eagles sand bar. By looking at the high water mark on the rocks, I would guess that we are still close to 8 ft. below full pool. You have to look at the bright side. It is a great year to go out and mark your GPS for all of the future rocks you could ever hit and fascinating to see some of our favorite spots out of the water. Mike Willems"
565452,Jigger1,2007-05-20 00:22:00,234,"Mike - 2003 was our 2nd best year and the last time I tied into an MA, looking forward to hunting hogs with you in a few short weeks. Truth be told, thankful I won't be fighting sub 40 degree temps. Watch out for later in the week, forecast is brutal, but can't wait to see the first official report."
565453,Guest,2007-05-20 08:09:00,0,"Jigger1: When will you be at SWWL, we will be there June 14 (but who is counting). 2003 was one of our better years as well, although we took some longer boat rides since the Sticks was too shallow to pass. But if that is the only worry in a week, life is very good. Mike W: Thanks for the reports. Have a great spring. Best week of our year is coming up. IA Walleye"
565459,Jigger1,2007-05-20 13:36:00,234,IA Walleye - We fish 6/27 - 7/1 so by the time we got there the Sticks were again (just barely) passable in 2003. I remember the year well since I don't think I had a jigging rod in my hands and spent the entire time and bottom bouncing. However since then my bouncing gear has been collecting dust. Good luck and I'll be looking for a full report upon your return!
