My question is as they both are made by Berkly, what is the diffrence between Gulp and Power Bait. I hope this hasnt been covered before. I did a search and havent come up with the answer. Thanks"
565353,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-05-16 22:57:00,80,"Not positive, but I think Power Bait is flavor enhanced plastic/rubber. Gulp is 100% all natural ingredients and is biodegadeable. If you use,Gulp make sure you keep the bag sealed after opening it, and don't put a bait back in the bag after you use it. Joe"
565362,Greg @ ABL,2007-05-17 07:12:00,23,"Joe is correct on the difference between the two. Flavor enhanced plastics for powerbait, and a non-plastic fish product for Gulp. Powerbait gives you more action to the presentation. Gulp gives more scent. There are situations where powerbait works better, others where gulp is superior. When the fish are active I prefer powerbait. When slow, and you need to finesse them a bit more, I prefer Gulp. Both are good products.

565389,stevensinks,2007-05-17 17:48:00,330,Thank you. I couldnt figure out what the diffrence was and I sure didnt know that you shouldnt put Gulp back in the bag. I will get some of each to take with me.
565392,Guest,2007-05-17 19:08:00,0,"Also, when fishing with Gulp, take it off hook at night. I one time was done at night and left the grub on the jig. The next morning, the Gulp minnow-grub dried out and was solid/stuck on the jig. It turns hard when out of water or bag."
565394,Guest,2007-05-17 20:56:00,0,Yea and keep those gulp things out of the sun. They get mushy and soupy after a while. try to keep them cool and as the other poster said don't leave them on the hook overnight. The natural colored worms worked good for us but the red grubs were a bust in northern Quebec. Good luck on your trip
565424,Guest,2007-05-18 13:05:00,0,"I've never used any of the scented baits, but after reading all the hype about them went to buy some. Needless to say I was shocked by the price, especilly the gulp which seem to have limited storage and reuse issues. For years now I have been using generic plastic twister tails tipped with no more than a third of a nightcrawler which regularly will produce 3 to 6 walleyes before the crawler piece needs to be replaced. The plastic needs to be replaced only very ocassionally. Have fished with minnow and jig, leech and jig, and both of the previous with a twister tail also on the jig. The jig twister tail tipped with a crawler piece by far is my favorite and has always equaled or bested any of the other combinations. The best part is that I've found this combination the most economical by far and it is easy to transport all the bait you would need on your trip. I just can't see the benfits to these new baits with the cost of them. I wish evryone a great trip this year. Personally I'm depressed as this will be the first year in many years that I will not be oing to Lac Seul. Locopoco"

565429,stevensinks,2007-05-18 17:07:00,330,"Locopoco like you , for years I have fished with plastic and part of a crawler, never more than 1/2 of one and I dont change it until its gone. I have always had good luck. I think that having the plastic on there lets them chew on the jig longer. I know what you are saying about the price. I am going to take a package of Gulp red and white Cut Bait to use as a traler on spoons for northers.It was 1/2 price with the rebate. This week I picked up 100 3 inch power bait twisters for $6.25 so that isnt much diffrent than the regular twisters. Im going to try them on walleye Sat. and see how they do. Thanks to everyone for your help."
565438,Wisconeye,2007-05-19 07:33:00,79,"You have to consider GULP as just another option to everything else but relative to minnows GULP is a good buy. A GULP minnow will outlast live minnows at least 50 to 1 and at times will outfish a live minnow. If you are deep in the backcountry they are easy to pack, compare favorably with minnows for attraction, and save you some space. In Wisconsin GULP minnows run anywhere from $4.95 to 5.49 a package so I can buy about one bag of each color for around $50 and that will give me aroung a hundred GULP minnows. At our camp real minnows are around $4.00 a doz so I'll get 144 for about $50- again it's all relative. I've never seen a time when GULP couldn't catch as much as other baits but you do have to remember the color might make a difference. I'd suggest you buy maybe three bags, a white, red and chartreuse bag, take it along and try it one year. That's what I did and I know pack about $100 worth each trip----about $50 worth for me and the rest for the other guys that want to use what I'm using :-) . The price is high, but they will last a long time if you take care of the bait by not letting it dry out. I wouldn't be caught without them in Canada. BTW- I don't think near as highly of the Powerbait."
