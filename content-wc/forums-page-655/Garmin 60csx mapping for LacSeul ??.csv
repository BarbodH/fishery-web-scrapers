You can try all the Garmin maps online at Garmin - there is a Canadian Topo - but no maps. Don't know of any 3rd part ones.

I bought a lac seul lake chart cd that you could load onto a chip or load right onto the gps. the weblink is www.trakmaps.com Haven't been on the lake since i bought it so i can't comment on its accuracy. Garmin america bluecharts has lake of the woods, the winnipeg river system, lac du bonnet, and rainy lake; they are exactly the same as the hydrographic charts, with hazards, buoys and navigation routes so I would surmise that these are accurate to the date of manufacture."
