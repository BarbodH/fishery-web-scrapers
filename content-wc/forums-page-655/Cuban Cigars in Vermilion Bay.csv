565422,Guest,2007-05-18 11:41:00,0,I used to get them at Bobby's on the west end of Vermillion Bay. Used to get cubans that were wrapped in silver foil and were 8 bucks apiece. Can't find them now.

565433,Guest,2007-05-18 19:50:00,0,Do they have the cigars I was describing or does anyone know where I can get them?
