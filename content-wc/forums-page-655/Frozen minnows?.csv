565357,sanmatt,2007-05-17 05:49:00,11,Has anyone heard if the MNR has any bans on bringing frozen minnows into Canada? We're wondering if any new regulations had come up due to the VHS virus? All I've been able to find on the MNR website is bans on transporting LIVE baitfish. Heading to Gullrock 6/1....Marble-eye Matt

Just don't want to spend the money here in the US and have to throw them out. Can buy bigger minnows in Canada if we have to.....Marble-eye Matt
