565398,Guest,2007-05-17 23:33:00,0,sanmatt....post what you find out....or post phone number. This is a serious disease which will kill tons of fish if it spreads.
565401,Slick Willy,2007-05-18 05:37:00,36,Why chance it. Buy your bait in Canada. Is saving a couple bucks worth the risk?
565402,1shooter,2007-05-18 06:22:00,1493,For me it isn't about saving the money. It's that I can never find any larger bait in canada.
565425,sanmatt,2007-05-18 13:24:00,11,Per Fort Fraces Customs Office as of 2:15 PM CDT. frozen or salted minnows ARE allowed into Canada. If you would like to check for yourself in case things change before you head north the Phone number is 1-807-274-3655 Ext. 240. Sanmatt
