Anyways Richarson Lake is just north of Birsh Lake 15 miles or so I would say. Never been there just going of Google Earth map. I will try and attach map to post although I struggle with these types of tasks. And to answer you question about being a part of the Cat Lake Chain I have no idea. Aint smart enough about Ontario to know yet. I will ask Vic when I call him. Pooch Can't figure it out go to google earth and type in Red Lake zoom in and go east 30 miles towards Birch Lake and pretty much in the middle of birch go north and Richardson Lake is 10-15 miles north kinda of a sideways S shape about 1km wide and 2km longin each arm of lake. Just north of Cassumit Lake. 72 Days is way to long to wait. Good Luck at Savant Joe"
