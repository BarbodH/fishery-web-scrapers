569356,Guest,2007-10-03 19:12:00,0,i have some friends that use this outfitter and they said that Kenoji is his best lake and that is the one to go to if you want the best trip possible. Coles is a smaller lake and not near the action. There are some other outfitters to look at if you can't get into Kenoji. Take a look at L&M Fly In Outposts or Slate Falls Outposts. They both have great service and good lakes.

569374,Guest,2007-10-05 17:40:00,0,I use to go with Pipestone Fly-ins a number of years ago and fished on Kenoji during the months of July and August. That is his best lake for big northerns and landing a 'blue walleye' as well. The main lake does hold a good population of walleyes and some northerns during the middle to later summer months but the best time to get the big northerns is just after ice out through June. We had to fish hard and travel a distance to find the northerns. Tough work but was worth it for our group. We as well tried to get into Kenoji earlier then July but he was booked by repeat customers.
