569155,Guest,2007-09-23 21:18:00,0,"So far this year has been a absolute improvement, not that difficult to say after the off year last year. The bite has been consistent with lots of fish in the 19-24"" range, both the river and the bay are going.... Some days are spotty but overall fishing has been really good. Water temp is in the 57-58 deg. range and the night are forcasted to really cool off this week Last week a local kid was out with his dad and caught a 33"" in the river, needless to say the kids hooked...... Hope this is an indication of the rest of the fall, so far the conditions are right. ""Lots of bait, good current and cool nights"""
569157,Hawgeye,2007-09-24 07:12:00,1355,"Hey Laurent, thanks for the update. My dad, brother and I will be up this weekend. We may fish Selkirk on the way up as we will be leaving Fargo at around 6am. Plan to arrive in Pine Falls at 11 or so if we don't stop in Selkirk. I am glad things are positive right now... Anyway, we'll see ya Saturday night! How is the current local supply of frozen shiners? How about the bait options...decent minnows anywhere or are they pretty small? Thanks Hawgeye -"
