And if there is a guide you would recommend. I would rather fish walleyes but if they are not an option pike would be fine.[email protected] is my email. thanks md"
569046,Springseeker,2007-09-17 17:04:00,96,"The closest good lake is Buck Lake. Best fishing is along the south end or east side.There is a hotel and small hamlet on the lake with a couple of accomodations. Google Buck Lake AB for info. A little farther but a great walleye lake is Pigeon Lake. Both lakes fish best with baited jigs,bottom bouncers and casting or trolling lures.Not much lodging and lots of cabins.There are a couple of guides-If I can find their names I'll post later. Google Atlas of Alberta Lakes for maps and directions. Bring warm clothes-it can be chilly that time of year."
569047,Springseeker,2007-09-17 17:15:00,96,"Ok I phoned some guys and they are recommending Reel Fishing Adventures, www.reelangling,com. They have several options near Edmonton. I have fished Pigeon and walleye action is non stop with good pike occasionally."
569061,Mike D of SD,2007-09-18 09:13:00,69,"Thanks a ton for your help, I believe I will be booking a trip on Pigeon lake since we are only 30 miles from there. Do you know of any places near Provost Alberta or Consort Alberta. This is near the SK border, I will be spending a few days over there as well. thanks, md"
569066,Springseeker,2007-09-18 15:52:00,96,Provost and Consort are in a vast area of remote parkland and bush with no notable lakes or rivers real close. We hunt around there for big Mulies and Whitetails and Elk when we get the draw. If you have spare time and can't fish bring a spotting scope and binos and just do some spotting. The lakes shown on any maps of the area are mostly sloughs.
569189,Waxy,2007-09-25 15:49:00,2938,"If you're along the AB/SK border, you're about 2 hrs from trophy walleye fishing on Diefenbaker Lake. Google Saskatchewan Landing park, Elbow, Sask, or just Diefenbaker Lake. There's some monsters in there, but it's a BIG lake. Be prepared for some serious weather at times too, especially at this time of year. Waxy"
