569200,Guest,2007-09-26 12:01:00,0,"Just back from a week on Nungesser lake and I gotta tell you that it is some fantastic piece of water. 6 of us caught roughly 1000 walleyes and 100 pike. 80 to 100 Walleyes were between 23 and 28 inches and the largest pike was a 41 inch Fatty. The camp was comfy and the equipment in very good shape.The staff at Anglers Kingdom went out of their way to make sure we had what we needed and the lack of a landing on the lake allowed us to pretend that it was our own private ""Kingdom"" for a week."
569205,Guest,2007-09-27 06:46:00,0,Have been looking at Anglers Kingdom. One question were you on the american plan and if so how was the food. If not was anyone in camp on the american plan and mentioned the food. When I go fishing in Canada I don't want to spend time cooking or cleaning it up so we always do full american plan. Thanks for any info John L.
569224,Guest,2007-09-28 08:15:00,0,"We weren't on the American plan, but I have talked to people that have been and they all said the food was wonderful and they were very flexible about your personal schedule"
569226,Guest,2007-09-28 18:04:00,0,Been there twice and the food and service was awesome.I highly recommend this place.
569228,Guest,2007-09-29 10:28:00,0,The food is excellent. Six of us ate with them the August 4 week.
