Each day was nice weather, a little windy for a couple days and I'm not a very good wind fisherman, but overall a great time with alot of fish. Biggest 25 1/2 inch. Numbers in the twenties with scads in slot and below. On Monday the second of Sept. we boated over a hundred fish with three guys fishing. Main lake points and humps fishing mostly with minnows and 3/8 jig in 30-40 feet of water. Remember to bring them up very slow. I have a question. What is everyones interpetation of ""structure"" in the Canadian Lakes? I have a good understanding where I live, but different ones have told me to just look for structure in say Minnitaki, Lac Seul, etc. Not sure exactly what that means other that mid lake humps and points. I'm sure this is an elementary question, but trying to know what I need to look for. Hope it doesn't sound to stupid. Thanks"

This is maybe a bit better than we did in 2nd and 3rd week of July. When I got there in early July, the guy running the camp said it was the best fishing he could recall. I have been told by guys I know in Sioux Lookout that fall fishing can be great. I would be interested in an explanation as to why they were so deep. We seldom go much below 25 ft in July. >I have a question. What is everyones interpetation of >""structure"" in the Canadian Lakes?

Bays or narrows with the wind blowing in is another. This year we got our fish on humps or gradual dropoffs with sand or dirt bottom, near but not on top of rocks. Other years we did well on rock shelves, again with the wind blowing onto them. > >Thanks"

We always started fishing at a depth of 20 to 25 feet and worked deeper. Seems the better fish where around 30 to 35 feet. We even marked fish as deep as 50 feet. No need fishing that deep plus it would be almost impossible to bring them up slow enough to not hurt them. Are best depth was 32 to 34 feet. We caught really nice fish plus alot of eaters. eyesnatcher"
