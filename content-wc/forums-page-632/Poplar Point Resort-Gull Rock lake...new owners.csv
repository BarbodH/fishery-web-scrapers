569251,Guest,2007-10-02 15:04:00,0,"Yep. My mom and dad were up there the week of Labor day. Grant and Bev introduced them to the new owners. If my mom told me correctly the new owner is a brother to the owners at Wright's, and possibly a son to the former owner of Red Lake Marine? Not sure on that one. I am sure someone here will correct me if I am wrong. It will be sad to see Grant and Bev go as they are great people, but my mom and dad tell me the new owners seem very nice. Hope we don't get a rate hike!! ;-) Renn"

569257,Guest,2007-10-02 19:02:00,0,We heard there was a deal in the works while we were in Red Lake last August. The new owner is the brother of the owner of Wright Wilderness Camp and son of the owner of Lakeside Marine. Mom and Dad who ran Lakeside marine have also stepped down and the new owner is one of the people who worked there.
