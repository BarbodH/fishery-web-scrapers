569248,clarkend,2007-10-02 10:44:00,140,Is that not against the law also??? I am pretty sure that leeches need to be from Saskatchewan. Not sure how you would ever get caught though!! Clarkie

569201,Guest,2007-09-26 14:30:00,0,Are leaches readily available in Nipawin? Thanks
569202,mrwalleye5,2007-09-26 15:00:00,1922,I would think like hen's teeth at that time of the year unless a retailer is storing them over for the October tournament. W5
569207,Guest,2007-09-27 10:43:00,0,Usually are some available around town....although this year may be a little tougher....I heard it was a tough spring for trappers. Good luck! Clarkie
569220,KidWalleye,2007-09-27 18:38:00,557,I just got a reply from the tobin lake resort.. they said that it will be very hard to find leaches anywere as this year was not good at all for the trappers..
569225,Guest,2007-09-28 14:22:00,0,"Thanks for the replys, I thought they would be tough to find. Anyone try the frozen minnows with much success??"
