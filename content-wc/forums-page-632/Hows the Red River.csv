569212,zzlaw,2007-09-27 14:54:00,34,"Those of you dissing the Red are you kidding me? - the Red is an incredible fishery for a wide range of fish - so what if it runs brown - that has everything to do with the land it runs through - and of course it has some level of polution given its length and the fact it runs through both cities and farmland - and don't try to diss me saying I don't know better as I've fished beautiful rivers in BC and along Lake Superior where the scenery is unparalled for salmon, steelhead and trout and I LOVE the Red dirt and all - zzlaw"
569213,Guest,2007-09-27 14:55:00,0,All of you fisherMEN need to grow up and quit insulting one another. Why don't you all try to get along like big boys and help one another rather than bash one another. And maybe do some prefishing on your own rather than feel out information from others. Isn't that watch fishing is all about.
569214,Guest,2007-09-27 14:59:00,0,"Oh Darn, looks like I might get slammed for my spelling errors - later"
569215,Guest,2007-09-27 14:59:00,0,Its walleye site not whiner get back to fishing sheesh.

569219,Guest,2007-09-27 16:55:00,0,"F150 Yammie with a T8...still doesn't narrow it down much! There'll be 3 of us... Look for the guy ""releasing"" the condom...I mean the big 33"" eye!! Good luck in the tourney!!"
569221,Guest,2007-09-27 18:58:00,0,"Mr defensive! All of our waters are polluted and we as a society need to do something about it. I assume ""Justthefacts"" and Mr whale are one in the same. I could break down your comments line by line but really don't see the point. You are also ill informed on some of your comments. Relax a little. I was tongue in cheek for half of my comments and I suppose at your level of sensitivity, you couldn't see that. Lighten up, lets just worry about fishing..."
569188,Guest,2007-09-25 12:55:00,0,"Hmmm peoples kids lol.Anyways back to the walleye site,fishin reports not water clarity and enviromental issues please lol."
569192,freespoolin,2007-09-25 18:30:00,472,"Fished 7 hours on the Red on Saturday Sept 22/07. It was a beautiful day, warm, light winds. Fishing is usually better when it's a little nasty. Water temp is 56-57F, current flow is minimal. The walleye bite is just starting. We caught 5 greenbacks, 2 15-16"", 1 23.5"", 1 24"", 1 26.5"" We jigged with salted, frozen minnows. The sauger bite isn't as good as last year when it was great. Yes, the water is dirty, it flows through hundreds of miles of silt and clay. We'll fish Pine Falls this week so will have a report."
569194,Guest,2007-09-26 06:12:00,0,"If you look at some of the water pollution reports, although the Red River is a stained river, it is quite clean in relation to many other rivers in the continent."
569195,Guest,2007-09-26 07:03:00,0,">If you look at some of the water pollution reports, although >the Red River is a stained river, it is quite clean in >relation to many other rivers in the continent. I think you have been looking at opinion and misinformation on fishing websites versus these 'water polution reports' to which you refer. If you do look at such reports you will find that the Red River in the top 10 of Canadas most threatened rivers list. Fact is fact, and opinion is sometimes BS."
569197,Guest,2007-09-26 07:27:00,0,Thanx for the report freespoolin let us know how pinefalls is going.
569203,Hawgeye,2007-09-26 17:12:00,1355,"OK, I'll label you as all knowing. Maybe the pollution comes from Winnipeg. One thing you need to realize is that this river flows through many communities and because it is basically in a flat basin (Red River Valley), it floods frequently. The flooding has a tendancy to pull in debris from all over. See what you can do to fix the flooding that has been happening since the glaciers disappeared. I wish more people thought like you and didn't fish it. What are the Mercury levels in the Red? There are many Canada and US lakes that have a high level Mercury content and have advisories against human consumption. You aren't hurting my feelings calling the Red a Cesspool. Stay away from the Red River, you'd be one less boat that I would have to battle with when the bite is on fire!! Hawgeye"
569206,Guest,2007-09-27 07:15:00,0,Yes one more spot equals one more 10 plus walleye for me lol.
569208,Hawgeye,2007-09-27 11:13:00,1355,"Ahhh, Tons, you said it. Say hi if you see a White 1800 ProV from ND. Be there on Saturday to catch a sauger or two, maybe a ""Hawgeye"" in the 10 plus range and a condom or two. I think they call that ""safe"" fishing...lol. Didn't you know that the reason that the eyes are called ""greenbacks"" isn't because of the stained water making them that color, it is because that flourescent glow is due to the radiation in the water :) . No humans should be within 100' of the water system!! I'll take the risk to keep people off the river an endanger my life ...hehe. Hawgeye"
569209,Guest,2007-09-27 12:15:00,0,">OK, I'll label you as all knowing.< I won't label you anything, don't know you. You are perhaps ill informed and that is why I simply mentioned that list to you. Only wanted to point out that particular FACT. You for whatever reason need more answers as you seem to have read much more into my reply to you. Not sure about the gradeschool name calling and funnin but I will try and play along with you. >Maybe the pollution comes from Winnipeg.< Gee ya think maybe some does! It is a large city LOL. >One thing you need to realize is that this river flows through many communities and because it is basically in a flat basin (Red River Valley), it floods frequently. The flooding has a tendancy to pull in debris from all over.< Brilliant deduction Sherlock did you think this up on your own. I also am familiar with that scenario having lived in a few locales along the valley. I would also think that there is a bit more to the water quality issues than just that though. It's not the debris you mention that worries me either! >See what you can do to fix the flooding that has been happening since the glaciers disappeared.< This would be in Gods hands. The true all knowing. Thought you could figure that one out. >I wish more people thought like you and didn't fish it.< Who said I did'nt. Maybe you are all knowing though. >What are the Mercury levels in the Red?< Don't you know LOL. While your at it check out the Lindane ammount for us would you. You should also be able to find info on a variety of different ag chemicals and other nice stuff in there as well while you look for that one. There is quite a bit of info for the American side tributaries as well which you may find quite interesting. >There are many Canada and US lakes that have a high level Mercury content and have advisories against human consumption.< Geee did you figure that one out on your own also. Impressive. >You aren't hurting my feelings calling the Red a Cesspool. Stay away from the Red River, you'd be one less boat that I would have to battle with when the bite is on fire!!< My reply to you made no mention of such nor was my intention to try and hurt your feelings. I will fish whenever and wherever the Sam **** I want to fish also for your information. I see you made mention of radiation in a recent post. Doubtful but search the web because the truth is out there as to what IS really IN the water. Ahhh enlightenment to fact based information truely is knowledge. With knowlege you and I can then both form our own informed opinions. See ya on the water!"
569210,Guest,2007-09-27 14:04:00,0,Hi Hawgeye Red ranger from canada merc on the back.What kind of motor becuz lunds are like belly buttons everyones got one lol.Dont catch my big ones i need em for the tourney sunday. Just kiddin

569177,Guest,2007-09-25 08:33:00,0,Soon to be very crowded and always polluted and nasty. Don't forget to bring piers for removal of condoms and tampon applicators.
569180,Guest,2007-09-25 10:36:00,0,">Soon to be very crowded and always polluted and nasty. Don't >forget to bring piers for removal of condoms and tampon >applicators. Now there's an reply that reflects the ultimate in stupidity! Now for a more accurate response to the questions on ""how's the Red doing"", it's starting to produce some HAWG's, should be a great fall."
569181,Guest,2007-09-25 11:22:00,0,Ultimate in reality there Buckwheat. The place is a nasty cesspool in my opinion as well as many others. Just plain funky.
569182,Guest,2007-09-25 12:17:00,0,I d have to agree with u catmendo.I think thats one of his girlfriends applicators that got away from him lol.Whale buster is a trout fisherman.
569183,Guest,2007-09-25 12:26:00,0,Yep lots of those Brown Trout in there too! You may also get a couple of those while jigging that river.
569184,Guest,2007-09-25 12:34:00,0,"U better go take nap with your girl,the men are out fishin on the Red"
569185,Guest,2007-09-25 12:41:00,0,Cripes whats with the personal bs. Grow up maybe?
