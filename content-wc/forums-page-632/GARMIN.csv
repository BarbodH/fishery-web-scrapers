569222,Guest,2007-09-28 05:46:00,0,">Anyone have experience with either of the following Garmin >products? Nuvi 350 or StreetPilot c340 I have the C340 and have run it since May. I love it. I have used it locally in Milwaukee to find places that I don't normally travel to. I have used it on a 1,000 mile trip to Virginia, on two 700+ mile trips to Canada, several trips to places in Wisconsin, etc. It sure makes driving and navigating a LOT easier. I would buy it again in a heartbeat. If I remember my research correctly, the models above the C340 (which may include your Nuvi 350) had features in them like bluetooth compatibility, MP3 player functions, etc., which I didn't need and would never use. So, I figured why pay for them. Use the search function on this site. This topic has been discussed before. If you decide to buy a Garmin, do it from this site --http://www.gpsdiscounts.com/ I have bought 3 GPS units there. Fantastic prices with good customer service. Sometimes they have factory refurbished units at even cheaper prices and I would not hesitate to buy one of those. FYI."
