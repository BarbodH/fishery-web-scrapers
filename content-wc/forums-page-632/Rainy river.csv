569159,sarg,2007-09-24 10:25:00,29,I have been thinking about a fall trip to the rainy river for walleye and wondering when would be the best time to go for that monster eye.Also what location and presentation is best this time of year.Could you recommend a resort to stay at that would be convenient for access to the river and good fishing spots.

Both places are fantastic to fish but I have to say Manitou is the best, some might not agree but thats only cause they haven't fished Manitou or if they have they weren't fishing the right spots. Nothing can beat a jig and minnow but almost every presentation works. Keep the crawlers and leeches at home if you cn get them. If your looking for a place to stay on the Canadian side, there isn't to much to choose from. Here at Manitou, Emo Inn would be best stay. Or you can stay in Fort Frances or Rainy River. You can count on the big boys to be here by the 2nd week of October and the bite only get better and hotter, by the end of October you will not be able to get anyfor the frying pan thats for sure."
