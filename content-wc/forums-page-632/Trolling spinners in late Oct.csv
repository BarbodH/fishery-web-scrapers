569199,Sutsgold,2007-09-26 11:32:00,219,Has anyone had any success trolling spinning rigs tipped with a crawler or minnow in late Oct? We always have such good luck with bottom bouncers and spinning rigs from opening weekend through august that Im curious if its a viable technique in canada that late in the season. Thanks in advance.
