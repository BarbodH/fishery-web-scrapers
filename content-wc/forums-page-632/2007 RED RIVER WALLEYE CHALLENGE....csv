Yesterday also played out well for some guys. One of my guests from Fargo was fortunate enough to land a 13.12 HAWG while pulling a crank!!! He also had a 10.5 earlier in the week. Over all the Red is producing a lot of nice fish and with the latest cold snap the action should continue to increase.
