569236,Guest,2007-10-01 18:05:00,0,Planning a trip up to the Red next weekend. I've had limited luck with trolling for Greenbacks. I was thinking of giving it a try this year during the mid day. I have a hard time finding spots that are flat enough and long enough to troll nice long areas. It seems like I'm either loosing crankbaits or trolling 4 feet off the bottom. Any suggestions on areas to try or tips for trolling crankbaits on the Red? Thanks guys

If they're deep they don't work. We try to use two different plugs with the shallow one on the inside pole. It helps a little bit. Other than that, you can run them off the bottom and bang accross the under water points. Yes, we get snagged occasionally. At times we've gone to one pole in the boat running a single plug along a deep drop off. The biggest challenge is finding a place where you're not irritating the anchored boats. When you're following the depth you have to just go out and give them room. North of Sugar has flats and fewer boats. Good Luck,"
