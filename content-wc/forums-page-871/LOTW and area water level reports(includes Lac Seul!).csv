If a guy where to read the posts for the last day or so there are about half a dozen posts regarding water levels on the LOTW area. You would think with that a post that give you up to the day info on that very topic in that very area, it would be checked out reg. Just a thought:)I guess that sometimes a ""personal"" report is a little more convincing. Not that I blame anybody for that. Somebody in an office in Toronto is going to be able to relate to the fishermen found on this board! Myslef included! :)Fish ON!!"
