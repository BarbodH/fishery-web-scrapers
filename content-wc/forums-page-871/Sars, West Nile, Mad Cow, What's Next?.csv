It finally has happened.In every lake across Canada and probably the World we have a new disease.I was fishin the tuther day and caught some very nice Northern Pike. All over 10 lbs to manybe around 15. Nice looking fish too. BUT...When I released every last one of them, they gave me ""The Tail"" and splashed water all over me, and the friends I had with me.Could this be ""MAD FISH DISEASE?"" The same thing seems to be happening with smallmouth bass too. Give a nice fish, but really ticked off when you let them go. Not even a thank you sir!!YUP- Me thinks it is that same ole disease - ""Mad Fish Disease"";)"

The only cure Im aware of is that the angler consume large amounts of alcohol. This is the only known antidote for the water that is tossed in your face by ""Mad Fish Disease"".....Good Luck"
