All 4 caught at least 50 fish a day each.Started with walleye, lots over thew slot. but always more than enough for lunch mostly 1/4 ounch chartruse jigs with 4 inch chartruse tails. Pike hit anything that moved.When we got tired of casting we trolled any lure in the tackle box and caught something.Small mouth took some sorting out but a lot of 16 and 17 s They seemed to love inline spinners# 4's over all a great trip even with water down.When the wind was blowing we could pick up walleyes jigging in 4-6 feet,What a blast! Pat and bob were our guides they we very creative with some shore lunches! Good luck to all traveling to this lodge.By the way our biggest pike and walleye came of the rocks down from the lodge at dusk for those who just want to cast at night and not take the boat."

We will be camping so frozen minnows will be hard to make last. Nightcrawlers have been working out here, and there alot easier to keep for a couple of days. Are the northern in the shallows still, or have they moved into the deep yet. I'm not talking the 5-8#'ers I want to find the 15+. Looking foward to the trip!!Fish ON!!"
