Appreciate any info on hot lures, weedline vs humps for 'eyes and what works for smallies in middle June. Appreciate the help! Cough"

531824,Guest,2003-06-03 11:14:00,0,Where are you staying on Wabagoon? If you are at Indian Point I can't be much help as I haven't fished the West end much and most of the places I know would be a long ride. If you are closer to the channel between Wabagoon and Dinorwic I might be able to help. You can e-mail me at [email protected].
531825,Guest,2003-06-04 07:18:00,0,"Staying at Bonnie Bay...on the northeast side of Wabagoon close to the channel to Dinorwic. Looking for any info on either lake. Thanks, Craig"
531826,Deerhunter,2003-06-04 17:52:00,1,"Sorry, I don't have any help on Lake Wabigoon. Just read your message and I'm leaving for Lake Wabaskang in 9 days. It will be my second trip as was there last year, the first week in June. Could you offer any help? My wife and I caught most of our eyes close to Petes Point up near the falls that go into Wine Lake, trolling a Lindy rig with night crawlers or minnows. We will stay at Jim and Julies Wabaskang Camp. Also can you suggest any spots for smallmouth, I have a map."

Gawleys Bay might work if you get some chop and overcast, but that's a ways from Jim and Julies camp."
