531936,Guest,2003-06-03 11:03:00,0,I need advice on fishing tactics for Walleye on this lake. The lake is well known for its bluegill fishery. Any advice for fishing near the eastern end of the lake(Angler's retreat)for Walleye would be helpful. I am going to take someone there for the first time and would welcome any tips or suggestions. I going in the middle of June.
