531947,Guest,2003-06-04 07:14:00,0,Last time at Pashkokogan was three years ago. Stayed at the resort on the southwest side of the lake...very nice place with very good cabins. Caught a 41 inch northern while casting the weed edges with a crank bait for walleyes. Lake difficult and dangersous during low water levels. Best luck there during high water years. Found the fishing 2-3 hours south just as good and the bouncing our vehicles and boats took on the Pickle Lake road just not worth the extra drive. Good luck and watch the lower unit!Craig
