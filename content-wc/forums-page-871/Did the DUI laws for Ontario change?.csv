531929,Forky,2003-06-03 11:02:00,0,I know last summer there was a lot of talk about entrance to Ontario w/DUI's on your record. There was also talk of relaxing them if the dui's were more than ______?_______years old. My father has 2 dui's both over 20 years old. Is there any chance we could have a problem. We have been going to Minaki for years and last year the customs officer asked our vehicle about DUI's and my dad told him the truth. He let us cross but implied that he could turn us around and send us back. I just want clarification. Are the rules printed anywhere or can someone help me find out for sure?Thanks for your help.Forky

531931,Guest,2003-06-03 16:06:00,0,I am going to Canada also and I was wondering if a diversion instead of a Dui on your driving record is grounds for not being allowed into the country??????
531932,Trailerguy,2003-06-03 18:26:00,1407,"I gotta ask, what is a diversion? Canada veiws a DWI as a felony, because it is a felony in Canada. So any felony conviction makes you an undesirable visitor, therefore they may refuse to let you visit."
531933,Guest,2003-06-03 19:56:00,0,"Diversion is usually offered to first time dui offenders. It is a program set up by the judicial system to educate and monitor the person charged.If the person sucessfully completes the program they are not tried in a court of law, charges are dropped- no conviction."
531934,Guest,2003-06-03 19:57:00,0,"By ""diversion"" I think you are saying a first offender program like they have in Pennsylvania called ARD. According to Canada the diversion is a conviction, even though it is not in Pa. or whereever you are from. I got turned away trying to enter Ontario at Prescott in 6/01. I think the law has relaxed a bit but I still filled out a criminal rehabilitation form (IMM 1444), sent my birth certificate, 200 bucks, passport photos, a certified copy of the ""conviction"" and I got a letter three weeks later (depends on where you send it as to how fast it comes back) telling me I was no longer inadmissable to enter Canada. My DUI was from 1983 and I got asked the same question the next year too and showed him my papers and was free and clear. Check that web site you were given and follow the rules and catch some fish"
531935,Guest,2003-06-03 20:03:00,0,You know im not sure what the regs are on dui charges. But I do know that diversion is not a conviction and its not on a criminal record as a dui.
