Most of the people I will be going with are walleye guys. Can anyone suggest a Muskie Guide from the area that could take me Muskie fishing on Lac Seul?Thanks, Joe[email protected]"

531630,the badger,2003-05-31 10:34:00,0,"Joe;I don't know of any muskie guides in that area although there may be some.I think if you want to do some muskie fishing in that area you would be better off driving over to Big Vermilion Lake for the day. Big Vermilion is only a few miles from Abrams lake and has some very nice muskies in it.Stop at the local bait shop and ask if there is any guide in the area.Lac Seul is such a huge Lake I think your chances at muskies are slim even though it has some big fish,big Vermilion would be much more managable in case you can't find a guide.A guide in that area would probably point you in that direction also.Good luck and good fishing.They won't forget the day the badger came out to play!"

I did do some pitching for muskies - had quite a few follows but no takers. I'm pretty much a rookie when it comes to muskies. The thing that is fun about Big V is the water clarity. It is a super clear lake, you can see smallies picking your tube up off the bottom in 10 feet of water! You might want to contact Rick Tinney at Deer Path Lodge on Big V. He might be able to help you with a guide. E-mail [email protected]Willie"
