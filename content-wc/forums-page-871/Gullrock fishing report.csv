531773,Guest,2003-05-31 10:02:00,0,"Just got back from Pakwash which is just below Gullrock.The Walleye fishing should be at it's peak this week forbig females. The females were just beginning to come in,we caught several up to 25 inches but nothing bigger.The Northerns were at the end of their shallow water feeding. Great trip, great weather, and great place to stay> Snake Falls Camp.The shiners were just coming into the shallow bays the day we left so that's the place to be this week.Leeches seemed the best but did use some minnows and crawlers.Most of the eyes were in about 6 ft on rock and gravel.Good Luck,Bruce"
