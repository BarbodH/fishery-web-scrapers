531806,Reels,2003-06-03 06:49:00,2876,My wife has flown into Kenora and drove back with me and it has never been a problem.<{{}}><
531805,bigfish1965,2003-06-03 08:21:00,3210,"I think where children are involved, doktr, they are probably more vigilant. I live in a border town and people have some of their party stay and extra day or leave earlier or they meet up with someone and bring them back...its never been an issue."
531803,bigfish1965,2003-06-03 08:24:00,3210,I live in Niagara. These are 10-12 year olds doing this. Good thing they have no malevolent intentions. They do have sensors along the bridge which have detected people trying to sneak in/out of the two countries. Maybe some good old fashioned cameras would be better.
531795,Guest,2003-06-03 08:51:00,0,"Yeah, John, Bigfish and Trailerguy are right. Dem stoopid custums guys aint got no cumputers. Dey jest praticin dey typin' skils."
531796,Guest,2003-06-03 11:44:00,0,"Next time you pull up to the window look at where the cameras are pointed, right at your rear bumper. When it was obscured I've had them walk out and look, one time they even asked me my what plate said."
531797,Guest,2003-06-03 11:51:00,0,"Thanks, t. I was hoping someone would point that out. But you don't really think that they put your tag info into a computer do you? Or that they could possibly be smart enough to figure out how to share info with the american side? No, only John, Trailerguy and Bigfish are smart enough to work a puter."
531798,Guest,2003-06-03 14:48:00,0,"Joe,Checking the plate, against the drivers ID gives them the basis for catching you in lies, when they ask the standard questions. However counting noses isn't part of the routine. How would the USA side know if a passenger stayed in Canada and another US citzen returned in his place? They'd have to be using passports, which aren't required at our freindlest border!"

531788,Guest,2003-06-01 17:41:00,0,"Looking for a little help. Heading up to Gullrock June 6 for the 9th year in row. Always drive up with the guys in a van. Business meeting has come up on the day of departure that can't be missed. I'll be trying in the next few days to make arrangements to meet the group in dryden on the 6th or red lake on the 7th. I'll most likely be up in a private plane. The question for you guys is...are there any problems re-entering the USA in the van with the group, not by flying back? I know I won't have access to the plane to come back.Thanks for helping."
531789,Trailerguy,2003-06-01 19:11:00,1407,"I don't think they know how you got there. Remember you are going through Canadian custums on the way in and USA customs on the way back. It's going to be more important that you are legal and can prove citzenship, than how you came to be there."
531790,Guest,2003-06-02 07:42:00,0,"I think Canadian and US customs share info and it is possible US customs may know that your group was one less going over than it is coming back. You may have to explain how and when you entered Canada, and I'm pretty sure US customs can check with Canadian customs to verify if they have any questions."
531791,Trailerguy,2003-06-02 12:33:00,1407,"I think you are streching the ""Big Brother "" syndrome here. Canadian custums would have to actually count heads going through in the fist place. They usually don't look beyond the driver, as many people with old OWI's can tell you. At most they ask what country everybody was born in. If you ever noticed, they use the computer to pull up the plates, then IF they ask the driver for ID they check it too, but I've never seen them record any infomation, unless they invite you to pull under the canopy for a search. Being legal will get you through every time, and putting a smile on your face goes a long way too!"
531792,Guest,2003-06-02 13:03:00,0,"I'm pretty sure Canadian and US customs routinely share info. To what extent info about a specific car is recorded and shared depends on a whole lot of factors. I think both customs regularly record and share expected return dates. The last few times I crossed at Baudette/Rainy River the Canadian customs agent took notes as she interviewed me and my wife. She may have noted that my vehicle included a white male and female in their late 30s/early 40s and a white and tan dog. She may also have noted that I said we're returning to the US on Oct. 13. I'd be surprised if some of the info the agent noted was not recorded in a data base, and US Customs probably has access to at least some part of that data base. What does everyone else think?"
531799,Guest,2003-06-02 13:11:00,0,"Don't worry about it, won't be an issue. And if they do ask you about it,(which they won't) just tell them the truth. The burden of proof is on them not you."
531800,Eric,2003-06-02 13:33:00,114,"Just crossed again both ways(fort frances) and nothing beyond the usual 5-6 questions (alcohol tabbacco, firearms where you going and for how long) on the canadian side. USA side did open my toneau cover on the pickup bed and look around. I doubt that they share routine information on each vehicle crossing as that would be a logistcal nightmare. Just be nice honest and legal and it should be a breeze. Eric"
531801,bigfish1965,2003-06-02 14:00:00,3210,You give our customs too much credit. The system needed to track such things would be mammoth. You are an American and they cannot deny you entry back home. End of story.
531802,5Paulie4,2003-06-03 02:45:00,34,"FYI, for the second time in little over a month, a teenaged (or younger)person from Canada has crossed a bridge into the Niagara Frontier region, on foot, without so much as a sniff by our ""upgraded"" security. In the first instance, the child began his journey with his bicycle, read a sign on the bridge that said ""NO Bikes"", and obediently tossed his into the Niagara River then proceeded on into the U.S. on foot. Naturally, the politicians went into a froth, demanded an investigation and promised us this was never to happen again. Which it didn't. Until last week when another Canadian youth hiked across the border and made headlines and, of course, the politicians went into their same rant. I don't know what this has to do with the subject but it certainly has something to say about how diligent the entire customs process really is.Thunderstick"
531804,eyedoktr,2003-06-03 04:25:00,2426,"I know that the customs people used to share info and I can't believe it's any different now. A buddy of mine and his teenage daughter crossed into Canada at one border crossing while the wife crossed alone a day earlier . When they came back to the states, the daughter chose to ride with her mom. When my buddy pulled up, they asked where the passenger was. Thankfully the other car was right behind him. They had been in Canada for the weekend."
