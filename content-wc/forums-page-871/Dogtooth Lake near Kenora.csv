531915,Guest,2003-06-04 08:27:00,0,Thanks Den. I'll check them out. I did find a web page for some guys that went a couple of weeks ago. They caught more eyes than they did the previous year. Last year I think we outfished them by about a 4-1 margin in the eyes category so that bodes well for us this year.The Sheriff (ready for the 2003 Challenge)
