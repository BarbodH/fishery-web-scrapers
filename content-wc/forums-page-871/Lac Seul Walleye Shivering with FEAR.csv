531744,Guest,2003-05-30 13:23:00,0,Those poor Lac Seul Walleye are in for one bad week when the boys arrive next week. Those Walleye better feed heavy now because next week when they decide to have a snack it will be one of the boys jigs. Hope you are lucky enough to be one of the boys.
531745,Wiley Walleye,2003-05-30 20:15:00,413,You guys are wannabees. I've seen your presentations and I'm not fooled. I weigh in at 14 plus lbs and have my weigh around the bay......try try again...hehehe

531747,Mike KS,2003-06-02 07:05:00,18,Those Walleye are in a lot of trouble next week. Hope we leave some of those Lac Seul beautys for you fellas coming up later this summer.

531749,Guest,2003-06-02 11:19:00,0,Your 4 year old son is lucky.
