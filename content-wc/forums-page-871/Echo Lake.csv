531980,Norseman,2003-06-04 19:36:00,24,Going to Echo Lake in about a week and was looking for some info on it. The Echo Lake im talking about is located about 20mi east of Sault St Marie in Ontario. It is a rather small lake considering its 5 miles long but has a depth of about 90ft. Just wondering if anyone has some fish info on this lake. Never been there before and interested in finding out all I can. I can't find anything on the internet doing a search.Thanks
