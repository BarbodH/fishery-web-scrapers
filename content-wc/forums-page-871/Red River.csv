531705,Guest,2003-05-30 09:01:00,0,I was on the Red this week after cats. The walleye are done till the fall. Once the water warms they head to Lake Winnipeg. I was told that the bite was hot about 2 weeks ago but the water has since warmed.

531707,Stevie B,2003-06-02 20:31:00,157,"Thanks for the info guys!Just to let you know I did head out there on Sat. The wheather was great and the fishing pretty good as well. Seeing as it was my first time fishing at Lockport. We managed to get 2 respectable cats in to the boat. One was 33"" and the other just on this side of 35"". A lot of silver bass being caught too. Although we didn't keep any I did notice a couple of boats had a sringer with a few of them on. I was wondering how they eat those guys. The only way that I can see them tasting like anything would be to smoke them.Fish ON!!"

Some still wonder in and out with the wind and the forage, they always do. We seen some caught last week, but we were not fishing for them.The Big cats are on the chew right now. We had a blast up at ""Cats on the Red"" last week. We spent the week testing some new methods for catching old Sumo Puss. One method I am eager to try again soon is working Salmo Muskie style top-water crank baits for them Sumo kittys.Yup I said crank baits, Well...more like twitch baits really. Look at the Salmo ""Fatso"" once, that is how BIG of a crank I was using, and busting big cats on.Fatso image link:http://images.google.com/images?q=tb...jerkbait03.jpgMan-O-man was that fun....YUP....UF-Da!"
