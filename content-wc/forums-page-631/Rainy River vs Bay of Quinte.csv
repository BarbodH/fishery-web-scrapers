569435,tdotlundowner,2007-10-10 09:57:00,13,"I just suggested Merlands due to its proximity to the area where folks usually fish. There are indeed a bunch of places to stay on the BOQ. Kansas, let me get some info together for ya. Expect a PM or email. Good Luck, Dennis"
569484,Superdad,2007-10-14 20:12:00,64,"The water temperature and the warm fall have contributed to a slowness of the lake walleyes returning to the Bay of Quinte. I was out yesterday(Oct 13th) in the area that normally produces a lot of big fish, and we didn't see many marks or schools of baitfish on the graph. The season appears to be late this year. Hope that's a help. Try www.quintefishing.com and go to discussion board Stay Tuned David aka Superdad"

569365,Lovetofish,2007-10-04 15:46:00,458,"Be back to Rainy River by Baudette at the end of the month. We caught a bunch of nice walleye last fall, but no wall hangers. The big ones are there. Dress warm and you'll have fun."

569369,Guest,2007-10-05 14:10:00,0,"On some stretches of the river you'll find long featurless run which are good for trolling. In some other places you'll find dunes or series of ridges which is good for jigging and trolling, some you muight want to anchor but the majority of people I see drift. If you up at Long Sault or Manitou fish the eddies which hold lots of fish. The fish are going somewhat pretty good righ now, depends on what your used of catching. You never know what the weather will be like so dress for winter, once you get cold you'll be cold all day. Use shiners if your jig but most my luck has been happening on berkley gulp minnows. Tomorrow is a derby at the Manitou, I will report after that is done after 4pm"

569375,zzlaw,2007-10-05 18:58:00,34,The Bay of Quinte is a giant walleye factory - no other area compares to the fall trophy walleye fishing at Quinte - all and I mean ALL of the Bob Izumi trophy walleye shows are filmed there - what makes the fishing so great is that huge schools of monster Lake Ontario walleye come into Picton Bay and Glenora Ferry and the reaches further north - that is on top of the resident Quinte fish of course - zzlaw

569353,Guest,2007-10-03 17:33:00,0,The family and I are planning on going to bay of quinte (picton bay) or rainy river (near baudette) october 17-21. Have not been to either but have heard great things about both. What would be our best shot at a 10 pounder at this time of the year? Thanks

569355,Guest,2007-10-03 19:08:00,0,Red River or Pine Falls would give you the best chance for 10+. If you time it right ( the weather is in your favaor ) you may catch several!

569362,Guest,2007-10-04 10:53:00,0,If you like open water trolling the great lakes for suspended walleye then Quinte is your best bet at a 10.

569363,Guest,2007-10-04 14:05:00,0,"Your right about the Rainy River, can usually count on the big boyz being here inthe middle of October. I've never been to Pinefalls but I would think of alot of people out there because you don't have the length of river like the Rainy. And as for Quinte, seen some shows look like snowmen out there. I prefer the Rainy cause wind can only be an issue if out othe east or west, seems like when its out of the west the bite is real good. I'm on the river all the time and in all my years of fishing, Rainy River is still my best quality fishery in Spring and Fall."
