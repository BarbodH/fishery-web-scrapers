569430,Guest,2007-10-09 19:54:00,0,"If Andy meyers is soooo great, why does the owner take his guest to other lakes to fish, and why do they call Eagle Lake the dead sea? The only cranks I pull are for Big walleyes"
569439,FJH1,2007-10-10 15:40:00,2306,"I have been to two different Canadian resorts in the past two years. Last year we went to Eagle Lake Island Lodge. The resort was nice but I didn't like the out houses/shower houses. If the cabins had indoor plumbing beyond the kitchen sink I would have gone back. This year my 10 year old daughter and I went to Silver Water Wheel Lodge. We really liked SWW. The service was outstanding. At SWW they supply a boat (new Lund or Alumicraft) and guide and at Eagle Lake Island Lodge we decided to guide ourselves. Every day at Eagle Lake Island Lodge we out fished the guides by a ton and we caught a ton of walleyes (100+ per day all catch and release). At SWW we caught nice walleyes (maybe 50 to 75 per day, again we didn't bring anything home), but I felt like the fishing on Eagle Lake was better. The size of the fish on Eagle Lake was better with the average fish we caught running 22"" (we caught fish up to 26""). Our average size fish on Lac Seul was 21"" (we caught fish up to 25""). I'm pretty sure that if I was on the tiller at SWW we would have caught more and bigger fish. I'll go back to SWW next based upon service alone, but I think I'll also plan a trip to go back to Eagle Lake and bring my own boat (I'll probably go to Andy Myer's). Best Regards, FJH"
569450,Guest,2007-10-11 11:33:00,0,FJH1....are you saying you would be a better guide than the ones at SWWL on their own lake? What are you smoking chump! You would catch half as many if you were lucky and less if you were picking the spots yourself. \\ Pat

What are you smoking chump! >You would catch half as many if you were lucky and less if you >were picking the spots yourself. \\ > > Pat > > I have fished at SWWL and also on Lac Seul with a couple of buds out of another resort on Lac Seul. We consistently catch more and bigger fish than I have at SWWL in three trips there. The Guides at SWWL are just average and most of them are to young to really know how to catch fish without all their GPS points being entered by the owner. Dont misunderstand me SWWL is a great Resort and you will catch fish but there are others who do just as good and better.
569460,FJH1,2007-10-12 12:24:00,2306,"Yes Pat, that's what I'm saying. I know that I could have caught more and bigger fish if I had been on the tiller. The spots we went to were ""community"" spots that all of the SWW guides hit (Rocker, AC Rock, Smuckerville...). There was no experimentation or exploring. I wanted to pull bouncers/spinners one day and finally our guide reluctantly agreed and for the 15 minutes that he tried the technique we caught fish, but then he wanted to go back to vertical jigging. We out fished the resort guides on Eagle Lake by a big margin and I know I could do the same on Lac Seul. The spots we found on Eagle had zero boats - we were the only one and we did outstanding. with the invention of mapping chips it's not too tough to safely get to spots that look promising. The spots we were working were not even on the paper maps of Eagle Lake. By the end of our trip on Eagle the guides were asking us what colors we were using and where we were fishing. Please don't get me wrong, I'm not taking anything away from SWW, it's an outstanding lodge and I look forward to returning. Best Regards, FJH"
569403,Guest,2007-10-08 16:19:00,0,"north star lodge on clay lake.. 25 minutes from vermillion bay.. only resort on the lake. smallies, wallies, and pikies.. have an american plan as well as housekeeping..run 17 foot boats with 50 hp yamaha 4 strokes..fished it in early spring and late summer.. fishing always very good to excellent.. easy to navigate, and it is a drive in. i have fished lotw , lac des milles lacs, lac seul, and other smaller lakes in ontario. fish here with the elder gentlemen and it will be great. i stake my reputation on this board on it... jig out!!!"
569406,rpieske,2007-10-08 18:56:00,1276,I can second Canadian Haven Resort. A great family camp located in a great town. The owners are super and their boats are the best in the area. I have been going to this town for 54 years and live across from C/H. Kathy and Brian run a good camp.http://www.canadianhaven.com
569407,River_eye,2007-10-08 19:21:00,1486,"You're right, Nestor Falls is a great town, with some great resorts, but that's the only thing keeping the place alive because the Sabaskong Bay area of LOTW has been sh*tkicked over the years. Too much pressure IMHO. My sentiments have been echoed by OMNR friends doing sample netting in the area."
569412,nicko,2007-10-08 21:16:00,508,Great Info. I will check them all out....Thanks
569413,nicko,2007-10-08 21:17:00,508,I will take a look...Let me digest it all and i'm sure i'll have questions....
569414,Stu,2007-10-08 22:45:00,472,"2 Cents is yanking your crank. It's kind of a joke that people who fish Andy Meyers tell others not to got there. Everone I've talked to raves about the place. I haven't been there yet, but it's definately on my list. Good luck - Stu"
569423,Guest,2007-10-09 14:32:00,0,"Nicko, there may be many wonderful spots, but I'm sure you'd have to look far and wide for anything as good as The Old Post in NW Ontario on Lake St. Joseph. I've been there with a group of men for ten years now. Cushy camp, camp staff excellent, whatever you want in your boat, you put it on the front porch when you go to breakfast, and it'll be ready for you at the boat after breakfast. Likewise, they meet you on the beach as you pull up at the end of the day to carry your gear, fish, etc. Accommodations very comfortable, friendly place - food's super, fishing's always great. Northerns and walleyes only. www.oldpost.com Good luck. John"
569425,Guest,2007-10-09 17:39:00,0,"I would also recommend Witchbay Camp on LOTW. We are from the Chicago area and have been going there for the last five years. The equipment is excellent, food superb, fishing pros are included in your costs and service unsurpassed. The owners and staff go out of their way to make your trip enjoyable and memorable. You are close to very good fishing for northerns, walleyes, smallmouth and muskies. Our group is usually about 10 and is a mix of ages from 10 to 85 yrs old. Some experienced fishermen to inexperienced. We usually request the fishing pro for the first day or two and then fish by ourselves the rest of the time. Put the least experienced fishermen in the boat with the pro and they will learn quickly how to catch fish. They have an American plan so you don't need to cook your meals. This is a great place for the people who like to get away and enjoy the scenery and some good fishing. Hope this help. Wingmann"
569427,eyeman_1,2007-10-09 18:05:00,690,Take a look at the Totem resorts. We've been staying at Wiley Point Lodge the last few years and really like the place. Great accomodations and food. Great equipment and the fishing has been excellent. I'm taking my dad for the 1st time next 4th of July. He's 66. Wife and I went for our honeymoon in 2000 and have been going back since.
569428,idapaul,2007-10-09 19:27:00,82,i have been to andy myers 3 times on housekeeping plan. it is a very nice resort and herbie and his staff will bendover backwards to make you happy. my only gripe is it is a little too expensive for me to justify.staff is great and equipment is top notch. just wish it was a little cheaper.

569387,nicko,2007-10-08 08:11:00,508,"Since this is a first time trip up there, we'd like a bit of everything. My father is going and he won't make a rugged trip. He's pretty agile for 75, but I don't want him on an island or in a totally remote fly in lake. To dangerous. The other guys father is in a similar position. Both are in great shape, but we don't want o get crazy. I'd like a meal plan if possible. We'd like to relax and enjoy this and see how it goes. If it were just a few of us younger guys I wouldn't mind cooking but this time probably not. Thanks...Nick"

569391,brant,2007-10-08 09:39:00,89,I've been to Witch Bay. One word... excellent.
569393,Guest,2007-10-08 10:10:00,0,"There are so many very nice places to go in Northwest Ontario. One listing of resorts can be found at: www.ontarioresortsandlodges.ca/americanplan.cfm I've heard good things about Witch Bay too. A few years ago a novice Canadian fisherman and I corresponded on where he and his buddies (from Virginia) might go. They finally chose: www.andersonslodge.com They took a short trip, hired a guide and used the 21 foot bowrider package. Caught lots of fish. Another excellent lodge is the Silver Water Wheel. www.sww-lodge.com I think many of the fishermen that frequent this message board have a preference for Lac Seul resorts when it come to Walleye. Lac Seul, Lake of the Woods and other lakes can be overwhelming. I like a smaller body of water with one resort if possible. I haven't been to Canada recently so I cann't give you suggestions on a lake that will meet that criteria. Wishing you good luck, good fishing and good weather."
569394,Crappie Kid,2007-10-08 10:42:00,1581,"We have been to Stanleys and I would highly recommend them. We stayed in the Kingfisher cottage overlooking the water. This is a top notch resort that caters to the serious fisherman or families. You can bring your own boat if you like and they will have dock space for you. Their Lund-Yamaha boats are excellent so think twice about the long haul. We upgraded to the 17 footer. My son and I took the guided fly-out Musky excursion one day and had a real special time. 30 muskies on light tackle (no net!) all released. The biggest was close to 40"". While we were there one of the guides helped some guests find, catch, photo and release a pair or 50+"" muskies on Eagle lake. We kept a portable propane grill and supplies in the boat for the duration. Nothing like fresh walleye, steaks or pulled pork for shore lunch on some deserted island, on a private cove every day. We opted on not trying to make our own fire for lunch each day. The scenery is spectacular and the owners and staff are simply the best."
569395,Guest,2007-10-08 10:56:00,0,"NICKO, We stay at Canadian Haven(dot com) in Nestor Falls on LOTW. I go with my father too and go the 1st week of June each year. My father is 68 and is also in pretty good shape. C/H is a great resort and great people BUT not American but there are a few restuarants within a mile. We take our boat or they have great rental boats. We also trailer our boat to another lake(s) 1-2 days for something different? They can also hook you up with a guide or day fly ins. We fish for everything(bass,walleye,northern muskie and panfish(crappie/perch). If you want/need specifics just ask."
569380,nicko,2007-10-07 09:13:00,508,I am putting together a first time trip to Canada and would like some comments on where to go. I have been looking at the Eagle lake area. We have some older adults on a first time trip as well as some middle agers and 1 13 year old. Not looking to fly in or be in some remote cabin 1000 miles from nowhere. We are from Chicago and would probably like to drive in. Any places that I should look at? Stay away from? I've been looking at resorts like Stanleys and Andy Meyers.... I may have my own boat by then....Any places more friendly towards bringing your own boat? We are looking at first week or 2 in June 2008. Thanks...Nick
