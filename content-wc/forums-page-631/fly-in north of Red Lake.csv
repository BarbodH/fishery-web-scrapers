569419,Guest,2007-10-09 09:52:00,0,"Robbie, Peter is fine. He is moving the northern outposts to a Monday departure next year. We have a request in to go back to Hornby, so Bearberry might be open if your group is interested. Dave"
569436,Guest,2007-10-10 10:23:00,0,"DAVE, I WOULD NOT LIKE A MONDAY DEPARTURE BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE TO USE AN EXTRA VACATION DAY ON EACH SIDE OF THE TRIP. ROBBY"
569123,Guest,2007-09-20 06:05:00,0,"Freddie, Yes, please mark up a map for me. I live in New Lenox and am frequently out and about in the Chicago area and the entire Midwest. Joe Michon was a great guy who also helped me. Dave"
569094,Guest,2007-09-20 06:42:00,0,Did the walleyes from 65 FOW survive? I've always been reluctant to fish in water over 35' or so due to fear they wouldn't make it. Maybe I've missed out on some good opportunities.

569112,Guest,2007-09-21 11:20:00,0,Keeper is good also marvin lake caught two big one one 10 one 12 pound walleye

569146,Guest,2007-09-22 13:21:00,0,"Keeper wasn't too bad, lots of smaller fish, a few bigger ones. I think we got spoiled going to the north outposts. There were times in the 90's when we had trouble catching fish smaller then 22"" on Warwick. Never been to Marvin. Doug in WI"
569147,Guest,2007-09-22 13:37:00,0,"DKin Lemme dig through my stuff and see if I can find Joe's map. He was a great guy, but really heck to fish with at times. Rules and schedules for everything!!! But always had every detail of a trip planned out. I can send you a pdf if you can print that out somewhere. We'll figure something out. Doug in WI"

569059,Guest,2007-09-18 08:47:00,0,"Our party of five fished Chimo's Bearberry outpost, 110 airmiles north of Red Lake, last week. Over all fishing was down from previous years. Biggest walleye was 23"". The fish count was down to weather. It started snowing on Wednesday and by sundown on Thursday, six inches had accumulated. We caught fish from 8' to 40' of water but most were in 12' to 25'. We fished Bullock one day and did poorly. Then again we always do well on Copper and so-so on Warwick."
569060,Guest,2007-09-18 08:53:00,0,"Being up there this week would be great. Did you ride up in the Norseman? If so, I've been on the same one."
569072,Guest,2007-09-18 19:56:00,0,"DKin, can you tell me if Bearberry hs indoor plumbing? Been to all of the north outpost and wanna take the new family up next year, and the girls say that's the only thing they must have. Did you fish the narrows? We've always had great fishing on Warwick. Is the water level down quite a bit?"
569075,Guest,2007-09-19 05:34:00,0,"Freddie, Sink, shower and urinal only on the inside, but Peter has added a solar powered electrical system. Yes, we fished the Narrows at dusk with slip bobbers. The first night was hot because the wind was out of the east, opposite the current. The Narrows declined after that so we spent most of our time on Copper. The water level was high enough to barely boat into Copper. The level on Warwick came up during our week as an exposed rock near the dock disappeared."
569082,Guest,2007-09-19 17:32:00,0,"Thanks DKin, can't wait to get up there again. How are the bears? We almost always had one visit us during the week, a tall skinny cinnamon bear."
569088,Guest,2007-09-19 19:29:00,0,"We saw moose but no bears. There were moose tracks in the snow near the cabin the day we left. We also saw two moose in the river on the way to the Copper portage. After three consecutive years at Bearberry, we are going to Hornby in 2008."

569090,Guest,2007-09-19 19:43:00,0,"Hornby is a great lake too. Caught 26"" walleyes in 65 fow in july. We used to switch off the 3 northern camps for about 10 years. I could mark up a map for you if you'd like. Got mine from Joe Michon. For walleye, we never used much more than my homemade yellow and green jigs. You'll love it up there!!"
