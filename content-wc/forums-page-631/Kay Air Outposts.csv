To say the weather was hot was an understatement as it was in the low 90's for most of our trip with no wind at all. We could not find a lot of structure in Casumit and had a hard time finding Walleye's till we started fishing in 3 - 6 ft of water and then we got a few. The walk in lake, we did fairly well on Walleyes but these were all catch and release only. As we left another group was coming in and they were surprised by the lack of fish we experienced on Casumit as they have always done well on the lake on previous trips. Plus we hit the largest May fly hatch I have ever seen on Casumit so with the heat and the fly hatch I guess we should not have expected too much. Cabin was nice on Casumit. Kay Air was a good outfitter and on time with us coming and going. Enjoy your trip."
