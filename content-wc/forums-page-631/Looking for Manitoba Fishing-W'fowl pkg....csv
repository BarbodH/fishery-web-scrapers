It's seems that ""everyone"" and his or her dog is offering some kind of accommodations to out-of-town vistors. Some are legal operations and are licensed and sanctioned by the province/municipality to offer accommodation services, then there are those who are not licensed and therefore not legal. Only legal operators carry some form of ""COMMERCIAL LIABILITY"" insurance. This insures that both the vendor as well as the guest has some form of insurance coverage in case of an unforeseen accident causing injury or property damage. It's important to note that any form of ""commercial liability"" insurance premiums are expensive. ""All"" ligitimate operators carry some form of commercial policy to protect their interests and their clients interests in case an accident should occur. One other item....in your post you mention that you are interested in waterfowl and walleye fishing. Are you interested in trophy walleye or just walleye in general. If you are interested in trophy walleye then the obvious choice would be the Red River. The Red is recognized as one of North America's premier trophy walleye fisheries. The region also boasts of some of the continents finest waterfowl destinations and attracts outdoor enthusists from far and wide. If you are simply interested in walleye in general, Manitoba has plenty to offer and I know of some very good destinations (that are legally licensed operators) that should be of interest to you and your party. If you are interested and would like more information, feel free to contact us via email or by phone. We'll be glad to assist! Stu McKaywww.catsonthered.net"

If they do, they are in violation of the RTOA."
