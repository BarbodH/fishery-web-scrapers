569476,fire105,2007-10-14 08:10:00,40,"our group has traveled to makhwa, fishing was great. our problem is the road getting there!. Gravel being kicked up from our vehicles really dinged up our boats. I have emailed and called makhwa several times and with in this last month with no response from them on the issue of having a new road cut or having the gravel issue addressed. we are looking for a place to book for the 08 season."

569515,JDP,2007-10-17 14:53:00,1457,I spoke with Mahkwa Lodge today. I asked about the road construction. Apparently the road is basically complete. However a bridge that would complete the route to Mahkwa Lodge needs to be funded and built. The funding for the bridge hinges upon local election results this fall.

569575,JDP,2007-10-18 14:33:00,1457,"Regarding contacting Mahkwa Lodge...I called yesterday (Tuesday, October 17th) about 2:00 P.M. The person that answered had access to the '08 reservation chart. She was very helpful. However, she was not a manager (Pierre or Roger). Hope this helps. :cheers:"

569474,Guest,2007-10-14 05:13:00,0,"You might try Mahkwa Lodge near Hudson. You drive very close to the lodge and then it is just a short boat trip from the landing to the camp. The parking area does have someone watching it. I have parked there 3 consecutive years and no problem yet. I heard last year that they were putting in a road directly to the camp, but I am not sure if that is true. The food and accomodations are very good and the fishing is as good in that area as it is out of the Deception Bay area."
