All three of these Resorts will put even the most inexperienced angler on plenty of fish and they will treat you like family. Evergreen, Lac Seul Lac Seul Lodge, Lac Seul Lost Island Lodge, Lac Seul Lost Island lodge, Lac Seul"

It might help somebody choose your favorite Resort which would help somebody enjoy the Canadian experience and help your favorite resort make a living. These are hard times for our friends up north.

American plan with 16' Lund ( v hull, flat floor, live well and cheap sonar). Seperate cabins with refridgerator, showers and toilets. Main dinner cabin for breakfast and dinners-box lunch supplied or your fish for a shore lunch (with all the fixins included). The staff waits on the dock for you to leave or return-helps tie up the boat, cleans them,takes your fish to clean and freeze, supplies the boat with worms. All you bring is your clothes, your beer and your tackle. They shuttle you to the mainland on their cabin cruisers-or you can bring your own boat if you so choose. I have been there 5 times and would go there another 5 times. I believe the last time I looked it cost about $900 for a Saturday to Saturday vacation. Awesome place and people would run it. Walteye"
