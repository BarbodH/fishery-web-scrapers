But thats not the story 3 of us for sure caught today alone 100+ fish. The 20 to 23"" fish is crazy.. The females have arrived, water temp is 50deg on the lake and the flow is excellent. We were sitting on an anchor but boats pulling plugs were netting fish all day long. The bite did not stop, 3/8 white glow with salted and live."
