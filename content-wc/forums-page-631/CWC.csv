The pre fish bite and tourney bite was unreal, it has been the best fishing in the area for years, not alot of 28's caught but numbers of fish were fantastic. The numbers of 3-4 lb fish is crazy....the bite did get tougher Sat afternoon, but the morning bite was wild. Cory Ney and Kent Christianson won the tournament with 56.1 2nd Don Powell & Ray Faucet 47.3 3rd Alex Kezler and Wayne Wagner 47.08 I have the rest of the results at work and will post them."
