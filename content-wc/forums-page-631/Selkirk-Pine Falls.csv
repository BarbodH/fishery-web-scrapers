569459,Guest,2007-10-12 12:01:00,0,"Returned from the Red last night. We fished Sunday through Wednesday. We trolled, jigged and hit it pretty hard. Jigging was best for us. This was our 12th or 13th year so I'm not not saying we're experts but have had our share of success in the past. I would rate the bite as slow. 29.5"" was out largest with a few in the 25-27"" range. Others picked up some nice fish but if you looked at the average Masters Per Boat, it would be very low. I don't believe there's been good migration in to the river recently and all the boats we're picking on the fish that had moved in earlier. The good news for those of you heading up is that Wednesday afternoon was the best bite of the trip with what I think are fresh "" lake fish "" moving in. Perhaps they're on the move after the big front and big blow we fished through eariler in the week. Good luck to all, JSO"

569358,Fishoil,2007-10-04 08:17:00,1277,"Quite a few years ago I caught my first ""trophy"" sized walleye in the river at Pine Falls, it was 25"" and went a little over 9 lbs. The picture is sitting next to my computer right now, I sure looked young back then. ;-) You guys are killing me with this thread, I haven't been back up there in probably 10 years."

569361,Guest,2007-10-04 10:05:00,0,I was working with the tourney weigh in at the docks.....seen some nice eyes weighed in. Many were in the 5-8# range and some (like tons) were in the 9# plus. I was on the water myself on saturday the day before the tourney and seen larger eyes taken on jigs and cranks. My largest that day about 7#. More greens still coming.....good luck at PF.

569397,WalleyeGod,2007-10-08 11:03:00,4,"Was up and fished the Red this past Thurs afternoon-Sun morning. We arrived later on Thursday and got a start just before 4 pm and caught 3 walleyes, no big ones, and a bunch of sauger - pulling cranks. Of course we heard you should have been here earlier in the day.... Friday we caught 10 walleye and a bunch of sauger again with the biggest greenie at 28.5"" at 10 1/4 lbs. Saturday we fished in some drizzle/light rain on and off in the afternoon and it was slower as we caught 5 walleye and a lot of sauger, biggest greenback was 27.5"" weighing 9-13. We lost a big one close to the boat too on Sat. Never saw it but was a good head shaker thumper style if you know what I mean. Sunday morning we saw clearing skies right away but that lasted only for half an hour and then clouded back up again. We ended up with four walleye and quite a few less sauger that morning. No big ones on Sunday. All walleye as well as the sauger were caught trolling for us. We didn't spend much time jigging. We had four other boats that we knew up there and they all had fish in the 7-10+ lb range either trolling or jigging. Both seemed to work equally as well. Not big numbers of walleye this past weekend but a good time nonetheless. Two of the boats are staying up all this week. Just one pass or one jig away from a double digit fish always up there. One just never knows. Barney Gargles caps off a great day on the water. Most of the walleye came in 10-11 ft. Sunday the water level had dropped a little (1 ft. maybe)which we were a little surprised at considering that Saturday we had NE winds. Woke up to Northerly winds on Sunday so we were thinking same or up some on the water levels. Did the opposite. Maybe Stu or a local can shed some light on that for us. Anyway, we had most of our success trolling using TD's of the usual colors. Sounds like the weather after today will be good for fishing up there. Tight lines."
569399,Chad,2007-10-08 14:01:00,3523,"We had two boats up there Fri-Sun...Wish we had better luck. Lots of sauger and very few walleye. trolled mostly #9 Shad Chart/Pearl was the best color. We only caught one greenback-29"". we did manage t ocatch a few shore anglers. Boy do they scream when you try to lip 'em. ChadM"
569444,Guest,2007-10-11 08:22:00,0,We haven't fished the Red for several years but when we did we used salted minnows 90% of the time. I notice in most of the posts they talk about dragging crankbaits. Is that the most common ploy used or is jigging with salted minnows still popular. Those of you who have fished there this fall what works best for you. Thanks For your Reply
569445,Reno,2007-10-11 08:38:00,330,"We were up there last weekend...I would say that most of the ""pigs"" were caught jigging. (unfortunately, not in our boat)...we jigged more that we cranked. Steve"

Caught tons of Saugers., On Monday and Tuesday we fished Pine Falls and caught probably about 30 fish in the 18-22 inch range. Best greenback was around 27 1/2"". We cranked exclusively and the action was on and off. Had a great time and brought home our limit of great eaters. I swear one of the 21"" fish we caught went well over 3 pounds....It looked like a football!! Hawgeye"

Yes, there are some big fish being caught but not in numbers. We've caught a total of 7 greenbacks in the two Selkirk trips (largest 26.5"") and 5 greenbacks in the one trip to Pine Falls. Yes, there are some who have caught more. I don't claim to be the best fisherman on either river. But I've been fishing the Red & Winnipeg Rivers for 20+ years and have caught my share."

569247,Guest,2007-10-02 08:58:00,0,"Freespooling best sum's it up. Although there has been some beauties caught over the past week or so, the numbers are not where they could be. Keep in mind that it is still early and as the water temps continue to drop the ation will (or should) continue to increase. The winning Team in Sunday's ""Red River Walleye Challenge"" tourney weighed in a total of 23 pounds on 4 fish. Two fish can be over 22 inch's and the other two must be under 22 inch's. The largest fish recorded for the event weighed in at just over 12 pounds. The river is infested with sauger at this time as well, it seems that 100 plus sauger days are the norm."
