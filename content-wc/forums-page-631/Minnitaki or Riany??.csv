The only other ""up North"" experiences I have had is to Rainy River area ""Minn side on Kabetogema"" . What should I expect different? Better fishing hopefully ;-) Any insight or thoughts. I have very high expectations for this trip!"
569589,IaDave,2007-10-19 14:56:00,476,You won't be sorry you did. Send me a note if you have any questions.
569592,Guest,2007-10-19 16:40:00,0,"Thanks for the response! I posted wrong, the trip is for the last week in May. My concerns ""questions are under the other thread here. Which are mainly what to expect as far as smallmouth and northern at this time. Thanks so much for your responses. I am like a kid on Christmas eve and really have no resources to investigate. I have no doubt we can stumble on the walleye, but am very concerned bout the bass fishing. My dad is a huge smallmouth guy and loves to fish them EARLY. But is this too early??"
569593,Guest,2007-10-19 16:48:00,0,"Oah yeah... Were staying on an island with Northern Sunrise Outfitters right on Minnitaki. Any info on that? We are very self sufficient, actually ""roughing it"" is a treat for us. It will be a fight to cook everytime for shorelunch. I notice alot of you guys are from IA. Im from NE IA by Decorah. You wouldnt believe the smallmouth action we had right here bout 2 weeks ago."
569600,Guest,2007-10-20 18:11:00,0,Have stayed at Northern Sunrise-A beautiful spot. It is out houses with decent shower house-so will be somewhat roughing it. Two newer cabins are beautiful. One on a point and another on a hill- great view. Try to get one of those. Fishing in end of June should be fine.
569609,Guest,2007-10-22 10:02:00,0,"Kurt, I too love to smallmouth fish and we go the 1st week of June to primarily target smallmouth but we go to Lake of the Woods. I would be happy to share what I know if you think it would help? Let me know."
569612,Guest,2007-10-22 16:12:00,0,"My first two Canadian trips were to Minnitaki, the last week of May, approx 20 years ago. The lake has had it's ups and downs since then in terms of walleye fishing. The reports on this site recently have been pretty good. We didn't spend a lot of time fishing for smallies, but when we did, we always caught them. So as to your question of whether you're too early, I would say no. The walleye will be pretty concentrated that early, and your outfitter should be able to recommend some good spots. We had outstanding success in the Rice River and Red Pine Bay, but I believe these are both now closed to fishing as spawning sanctuaries until early or mid-June. If lake trout fishing interests you, that should be good in late May also."
