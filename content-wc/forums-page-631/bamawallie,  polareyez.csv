569440,bamawallie,2007-10-10 17:26:00,54,We stayed at Manotak. Great place and really nice people. Great service in all respects. Walleyes were slow. Smallmouth were great. We did a one day fly-in to a catch and release lake and the fishing was spectacular. WE enjoyed the trip and plan on returning.
