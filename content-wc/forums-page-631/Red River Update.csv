The bottom line is, the Red is in great shape and has been producing volumns of SUMU 'eyes on a daily basis! Jigs and slaties has been far more productive than pulling cranks this past week which is usually the norm this late in the season. The patterns will continue to be productive as long as the weather continues to cooperate! Good-Luck to all!"
