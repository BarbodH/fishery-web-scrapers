569448,Guest,2007-10-11 10:19:00,0,i just returned from Red Lake and heard a few Donny Maw stories. His bad far outweighs any good he does. He continues to get by with his actions because he has his enablers. Fired? Prosecuted would be more fitting.

The letter of the law is spelled out on both sides of the equation.If one side isnt playing fair,then what?It is an example of how the state abuses its powers,and the judges and crown prosecutors are in on it ,due to the expense of fighting them.They let there little Hitler get away with it.Its only when they get called on the carpet that official decorum takes over.Then everything is above board because its public and they give the rogue cop wannabe a slap on the wrist and hope it all goes away so they can carry on with the scam."
569024,Guest,2007-09-16 05:10:00,0,"I want to point out this... ""There was no clear explanation for the difficulty, other than Ms. Schugman's evidence, which was undisputed, that she was asked for a badge number or officer number. Information she could not supply without Conservation Officer Maw's assistance, which he did not provide. As a result, she felt compelled to give a statement."" This does not say that Maw refused to give her the number. This says, Maw didn't offer her assistance when she was on the phone. Those are two VERY DIFFERENT facts!!!!!!!!!! Once again, this is not saying Maw's a great officer. This is saying that those two were engaging in some type of illegal poching, and got off by defaming his reputation (good or bad). I think anyone who breaks conservation laws knowingly desrves every bit of punishment they receive."

Maw had our what was frozen filet's,laid out on the road while he proceeded to rummage though our stuff looking for what I think would be illegal fish, this went on long enough that we threw the filet's away, we asked to put them back into the cooler but were told he wasn't done. I would not call that being professional. I don't expect to be treated like royalty, but I'd at least like to be proved guilty before I was hung. Like him or not, your choice...but I'd just as soon see he get fired. Al"

The c.o's up there clearly count on the fact that its too expensive to return to Red Lake or hire an attorney to fight these abuses,so thats how they get the majority of their guilty pleas. Lets see how some of the detractors will act if one of their children are coerced into a confession by a cop using intimidation ect."

Found nothing out of line. No charges. Maw is out of control. He stretches the letter of the law to sting hunters and fishermen. Most CO's go by the spirit of the law as well as the letter of the law. He does more good than harm, but he does too much harm, for no good reason, in my opinion. Believe me, you need to know him before judging his actions. There are enough violators out there for the catching without resorting to entrapment and fabrication to make a case."

If you're going to bend or break the rules, then that's your choice. If there's a guy out there coming into your home without your permission... call the police. He'll get a knot yanked in his tail very quickly if the police are getting calls all the time due to his actions. This entire post was meant to slander a guy, that for all any of us know, has done nothing wrong. I still say he should've taken the freaking boots when they were out in the snow! LOL"
569016,bigfish1965,2007-09-15 21:23:00,3210,"Maw is known across the province as a rogue. It is no secret in the angling world. Not even close. He is a classic example of why even law-abiding people need protection from law enforcement at times. It has nothing to do with hating authority. The guy is a disaster. It is because of guys like him that it is difficult to get convictions on poachers. If no officer ever abused their powers,invented or slanted evidence, we wouldn't even need the presumption of innocence would we? I'm sure everyone would get pissed if they come home every day to the police going through their bedroom."

You have a wonderful country protected by an ironclad constitution and you are letting it slip away. As a Canadian,I'm not willing to have the officers of the state steal my rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.As we allow more of this B.S. to take place,because no one is willing to fight,another right is lost.

568988,Nungesser_C_O_Slapper,2007-09-14 15:22:00,6,Here is a link to a case involving a C.O. still operating in the Red Lake ONT. area. Beware!http://www.canlii.org/on/cas/oncj/2004/2004oncj407.html Read it and watch out. The same guy is still there bending the rules!
568990,Guest,2007-09-14 16:02:00,0,See what happens when you don't tip somebody for helping you gut and load a dead moose?
568991,Nungesser_C_O_Slapper,2007-09-14 16:03:00,6,LMFAO!
568992,Guest,2007-09-14 16:38:00,0,"""The conservation officer states that he had authority under Section 91 (2) of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to seize their boots in the field but, out of consideration for Loffler and Schugman, chose not to do so. He followed them to their home and seized two pair of boots. He seemed to believe his authority under Section 91 (2) of the FWCA extended to anyplace. He also seemed to believe that he could enter their home to make the seizure since he was not expressly told that he could not."" So, it would've been better for the officer to take their boots out in the field? That's an absolute RETARDED arguement. Sounds to me, like a couple morons shot a moose out of a truck, got caught, and used the officers leniancy against him. That's great for us! Next time we're out there, they'll take our boots. ... i'm sorry, but do people really wonder why officers are jerks?"
568993,Nungesser_C_O_Slapper,2007-09-14 17:34:00,6,Maybe reread it again.The c.o. wouldnt even give his badge number so the woman could get legal help.Then he went into their house without a warrant.The c.o. is a retard.
568994,Guest,2007-09-14 18:57:00,0,"I read that, and was kind of shocked anything held up in court. Did he have to say why he refused to give her his badge number?"

568999,Guest,2007-09-14 21:24:00,0,Nungessor CO Slapper got arrested himself a few years ago I believe for poaching walleyes. He got off on a technicality. Now his mission is to discredit Conservation. Yet he still has not told us all what he did to get arrested. Why did you get your citations??? He will tell you it was an illegal search. Do any search of my cabin any day and you will find nothing wrong.
569002,Guest,2007-09-14 23:17:00,0,Well good for you Officer.I hope you come home one day and find the law searching your house.But you got nothing to hide.......
569004,Guest,2007-09-15 05:36:00,0,I think that the man shot the Moose and the woman was status a contravention. By law the woman should have shot the Moose. Common sense would tell the officer that these people are hunting for the table and should have been left alone. What difference does it make who shoots the animal. Overzealous and out of control. The officer is also placing himself at great risk by splitting husband and wife for questioning by himself when there are firearms involved. With snow on the ground as well it should have told him that hunting was tough. All the staus people that I know have their Moose prior to snow. They start to hunt after the first frost just prior to Rut.
