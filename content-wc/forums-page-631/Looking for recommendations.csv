Arrived at 4 pm ,got our cabin and went out for an hour before dark,caught 2 small northerns.Here are some pics of Cobb Bayhttp://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c1...0/5c869b2f.jpghttp://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c1...0/d5bed966.jpghttp://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c1...0/94dbaa2d.jpghttp://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c1...0/f4e1f705.jpghttp://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c1...0/66f9e4cf.jpg Went out the next day and fished the 3 bays then went out to the main lake,only caught a few northerns 2 perch and a nice lake trout in bell bay on the south side of the main lake. Sturgeon lake is huge, deep and crystal clear,not the type of water i'm used to fishing so we struggled to get even a few marks on the sonar much less catch anything. We spent the night again and headed to Young Lake lodge just down the road and got a cabin there. The weather till then had been very warm and clear.Here are some pics of young Lakehttp://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c1...0/b604288c.jpghttp://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c1...0/04592847.jpghttp://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c1...0/f2ae01c1.jpghttp://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c1...0/595e61f7.jpg That evening the nice weather ended and it pouredhttp://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c1...0/1629fd8a.jpg We caught some nice bass and a few walleye in Young and a few walleye in Whiterock then got rained out Took off in the morning in the rain and headed for Pashkokgan Lake,got there and headed out toward 5 mile point and places i have caught fish before {14 yrs ago} and we got into the fish....finally!!

The road from Pickle Lake south for 62 miles is miserable so use caution if you are heading up that way this spring. Fished most of the next day on young lake with mixed results..good in the a.m. but then it clouded up and the fish shut off so back out of sturgeon lake to try for some lake trout.Went to Biedelman Bay to try trolling but there was lightning hitting the ground nearby so we were gone after seeing that.drove to Orr,Minnesota that night and stayed at the Americinn {nice} Got up at daybreak and headed home.Saw a bull moose about 15 miles north of Cloquet,standing in the median,other than that it was uneventful trip home. Stayed home for 2 days and took off for Keewaune,Wis for some salmon fishing.Here i am with a nice onehttp://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c1...ewaunee002.jpg enjoy :cheers:"

569115,guidedfishing,2007-09-21 20:41:00,531,"Eric, I am sure you are enroute already, I have fished cobb bay extensively and the bays North around White Sands Rusty Myers etc. As far as walleyes Cobb Bay is the best rivaled only by the NorthEast Arm. That being said the walleye fishing is only fair at best when compared to the out lakes. yeah you can go catch a limit and then some on certain days but to consistently catch numbers & size you have to get away from Sturgeon. Now Pike is another item, you can have almost as good success on pike, and the chance at a nice one is always there. Look to the stained water bays for both Pike and Walleyes. The main lake and even most of the bays are very clear. My best walleye fishing in Cobb bay and up near White sands has always been late at night. Lake trout are plentiful, but run smaller than the out lakes as well. At times you can do well on numbers but you will not consistently catch nice trout. I use Sturgeon as a home base and then fish the out lakes usually now only putting in a day or two on sturgeon as the out lake fishing is for the most part superior. Good luck. either way it is a beautiful trip. GF."

568955,Fishoil,2007-09-13 13:55:00,1277,You could always drive up to Pickle and get a room. Then you can daytrip out from there. Pashkokogan is only about 30 miles back south or else there's lots of other lakes in the area that have places to launch.
568960,Guest,2007-09-13 15:20:00,0,Try Press Lake.
