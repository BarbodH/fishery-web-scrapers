Great fishing and great scenery. I've heard a lot of talk about the Canadian side of the lake and we are looking at some day trips there. I was told most of the spawning goes on up there and the fishing can be incredible. What do I need to do to get up as far as entering Canada? Restrictions or that type of thing. I know about buying minnows up there. My next step is to buy a Rainy Lake north half map. I have a 1850 boat with a GPS system and lake map chip so I can navigate there okay. Does that upper portion have more sand. What type of structure should I look for? We've been fishing Kabetogama for years and have stayed to shallow sand bars and points and done okay. Does that area have fleets of boats parked in small areas or can we get away from the crowd? Thanks for the thoughts and ideas. JD"
