3551122,Draco1206,2015-02-16 19:31:00,175,"You are right that bobbylfishermon's post is off topic but the thread is probably off topic to begin with as it has nothing to do with fishing. But, having said that I want to thank you and v-bay gord for bringing some common sense and levity to this thread. I had no intention of commenting when I first saw the topic, but after bobbylfishermon went on his ""fair chase"" rant I couldn't in good conscience let it go without a few remarks. This thread should be moved over to a hunting forum so bobbylfishermon can get eviscerated verbally as he should be. There are so many judgmental and contradictory statements in his rants that need to be questioned and challenged. First ""a real hunter believes in a fair chase hunt"". Of course you're only a ""real hunter"" if you live by his definition of ""fair chase"". He mentioned that he uses dogs for some of his hunting, of course this is ""fair chase"" because it's the way ""he"" defines it, I'm sure there are many people out there that would say using dogs to hunt isn't ""fair chase"". I'm sure he isn't hunting with his bare hands or a spear and knife but probably uses a high powered rifle with or without a scope or maybe a compound bow that has an 80% let off and shoots 350fps. But of course this is ""fair chase"" by his definition. I'm sure there are people out there that say using these high tech tools isn't fair chase at all. Second, ""baiting in the States is forbidden for any animal"". Well I don't know where he got that information, but I'm from Michigan and hunters are allowed to use bait for deer and bear hunting. As you are in Minnesota, Wisconsin and many other states. Check your facts first. And third, ""there's a real difference between a slimy #%* fish and shooting a bear that minding it's own business"". I find his whole attitude offensive to both hunters and anglers. Isn't the fish ""minding it's own business when you jerk your ""baited"" hook through it's jaws? Is the fish's life worth any less than the bears? ""I've killed a lot of animals in my life"", I guess none of them were ""minding their own business""? You bobbylfishermon are no real hunter, as real hunters and anglers respect all the animals that they kill. My main point is, as hunters and anglers we have enough enemies out there that would take hunting and fishing away from us in a heart beat. We don't need to be fighting each other over the methods we use as long as they are legal where you hunt or fish. Baiting bear is sometimes the only way some people will ever see a bear to shoot. Maybe they don't have the skills, patience or time like a ""real hunter"" to ""get in the bush at their level"" like you do, and I'd much rather be able to look over the animal to make sure it is an animal I want to kill, then to kill a cub or mother with cubs. I see no difference between baiting a bear and killing it or ""getting into the bush at their level"" and killing it with a high powered rifle while it was ""minding it's own business"". It's still dead and both methods are legal. Next time bobbylfishermon should have the guts to put his views in a ""real hunters"" forum."
3551442,v-bay gord,2015-02-16 20:37:00,3168,"People can defend their own comments, but if I was to make an observation it would be this. We are all passionate about fishing, and some about hunting. This passion will of course lead to lively debate on the 'how to' and ""ethics"" about what we love to do. The bottom line is the passion for hunting and fishing. Regardless of differences we still love to hunt or fish. The other observation I would make is that regional differences define much of our sport....our ""ethics"". What is common practice in one area may seem unethical in another. Keeping big walleye on Lake Erie vs somewhere else. Using bait, not using bait. WC is a good forum to present different views. I think we are all willing to acknowledge that we are not all going to agree, so let's all have a thick skin and present our views!"
3551586,Draco1206,2015-02-16 21:27:00,175,"V- bay I couldn't agree with you more. I think you basically said the same thing I did but in a more politically correct way. Sorry I'm not PC and never will be. I have no problem defending anything I said but I would never criticize anyone's hunting or fishing methods as long as they are within the law. And defending that or attacking someone that does doesn't mean I'm thin skinned. There is no defense for posts such as bobbylfishermons that attacked hunters that don't hunt the way he does, especially since there was no mention of bear hunting before his post. To interject his ""real hunter"" crap into this thread was just that, crap""."
3551906,bobbylfishermon,2015-02-17 05:44:00,241,"Draco, I have NEVER hunted any animal with a dog, I said my dogs helped me EAT some of the distasteful animals that I shot, and I never shot another one of those animals, this is a outdoor forum, and you're the only one who disagreed. I eat EVERYTHING I KILL , how about you?? I have a buddy that has a bunch of greasey freezer burnt bear meat that he killed over a bait, he said he's still embarrassed by that SHAM of a ""HUNT""!! I'm sure you'd be proud."
3552314,Shellback,2015-02-17 07:50:00,8083,"If you kill a mouse in your house or a fly on your wall, do you eat it? They are all god's creatures. People get on their high horse about ethics. Do you fish? Do you think the fish enjoys being dragged up from the depths by a hook in his mouth? How about animals you have hunted? You think they enjoyed their last minutes on earth after being shot? Bottom line is if you fish or hunt and follow the game and fish laws, you are an ethical sportsman. Those sportsman who criticize others about their legal methods are hypocrites."
3552362,Skywagon,2015-02-17 07:54:00,1106,"bobbylfishermon, I disagree on your rant also. Now there are two. And what about your your fish finder.... so un-fair chase."
3553946,Shellback,2015-02-17 15:38:00,8083,I think someone posting here could benefit from socialized medicine. It seems their meds have worn off. They have gotten a joke thread about socialized medicine confused with fair chase bear hunting.
3554050,Draco1206,2015-02-17 16:40:00,175,"I know,I know. I said my last post was going to be my last post. But I really mean it this time. I couldn't just let you call me a"" jealous little B#$%H"" and not respond. It just wouldn't be manly and I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror. First off, Thank You for your service as a Marine. I should have known you used a .458 Weatherby, a.375 H&H is like a pea shooter to a man like you. I'm sorry if that upset you (really). Did you make the PH empty his back up weapon because you wanted the ""real hunter"" to come out on top whether it be the buffalo or the man if you missed or wounded it? Somehow I doubt it. A couple facts for those following this thread. When you book a hunt to Africa you do not get to keep the meat, you are told this ahead of time. You do not have a choice to ""donate it to the villagers"", it is the law. The meat belongs to the PH (Professional Hunter) and the villagers. This way they don't kill all the animals themselves for food. The meat is just like payment in a business. It's not like when bobbylfishermon ""donated the meat to the villagers because they are dirt poor"" he is some altruistic, ""I did it from the kindness of my heart"" kind of guy. He had no say whatsoever where the meat went or to whom it went to. He went there strictly to kill animals. Now I don't really care how or why he hunts and I'll defend any method he uses as long as it is legal, but he's being a little disingenuous and two faced. And bobby (can I call you bobby? It's getting tedious typing out your whole name), anyways bobby, I've never hunted big game on a game farm or shot one from my car window. And Shellback, you are too funny. I stopped taking my meds years ago and I feel fine, really, I'm not crazy, just ask me."
3554090,v-bay gord,2015-02-17 16:49:00,3168,"O.K....great, now that we've all got the testosterone out of our systems, let's just agree that should this go on any further it will have to be done by the wives of the main combatants. Draco....Bobby...please inform your spouse that they will need to carry this on. Barring that I invite you both to the lodge here on Eagle Lake to discuss this issue over a cold O.V. and a hot plate of fish. Others may feel they wish to join. We can discuss the best way to prepare water buffalo.....or if we are really starving...black bear (with a side dish of diaper) Good Night."

3556050,bobbylfishermon,2015-02-18 08:13:00,241,"No problem here, when I wake up in the morning that's a good start. Hey Draco, the Marine Corp has three shooting standards for riflemen, marksman, sharpshooter, and expert and I qualified as an expert with the M-14,M-16 and the 1911-45 auto and have maintained my shooting skills all these years, none of those animals knew what hit them, because I took the ""right shot""! You had my blood flowing yesterday (which is a good thing at 64years of age) and I apologize for overstating my opinion, NO hard feeling here man! And to be honest with you guys, my wife chewed my A@# over that little episode yesterday (and I actually heard some it) take care. lol"
3556482,Draco1206,2015-02-18 09:42:00,175,"Hey Bobby, absolutely no hard feelings here either. I never really took it personally and I knew I was pushing your buttons while I was trying to make my point. We are all passionate about some things and that makes life worth living. I wouldn't have it any other way. I too earned my expert qualification with the M-16, while certainly not a Marine, I spent my four years in the USAF as a crew chief for F-4 fighter aircraft. I accept V-bays truce because I was truly dreading turning this over to my wife. Though I may have cutting sarcasm and biting rhetoric, in 37 years I have never won an argument with my wife. She scares me when we argue and no matter how right I think I am I lose (don't ever let her know I said that)."

3552762,v-bay gord,2015-02-17 09:46:00,3168,"Just curious, but why do you assume that someone shooting a bear will not eat it? Or does this just apply to hunting from a baited stand?"
3552938,LOW1,2015-02-17 10:28:00,2828,"What is it about eating an animal that makes killing that animal morally acceptable? What is it about baiting an animal that makes killing that animal unacceptable? What is the ethical difference between baiting and hunting near a water or food source? If you legally kill an animal, why should you have to eat it? After all, it is dead and the damage to the resource will not be different if you eat it or if you don't."
3553050,Blue Lk,2015-02-17 10:51:00,269,Sounds like some are getting a case of the winter blues. I'm not taking sides or pointing any fingers here. Maybe time to pour a couple fingers of 40 creek & organize the tacklebox. Just a suggestion

3553506,Draco1206,2015-02-17 12:47:00,175,"You dig yourself deeper into the hypocrisy hole every time you write something. So let me get this right. You've killed cape buffalo (weight approximately 1500 lbs.), kudu (approximately 600 lbs.), impala, ibus(not sure what this is, maybe you meant ibex?). You either did one of two things. You hunted them on ""game farms"" in the States where they are allowed to keep these exotic animals, or maybe Canada has similar farms. Or you went to Africa and hunted them where you are not allowed to bring the meat back. The meat belongs to the PH and the natives. So tell me how you ate a 1500 lb. cape buffalo, or a 600 lb. kudu? You at best ate a couple steaks while your were in Africa and the rest of the meat stayed there. So basically you traveled to Africa just to kill an animal you could not bring home to eat, and only to bring home that animals horns and cape. Sounds like a ""real hunter"" to me. Of course you shot it with your high powered .375 H&H rifle with a $4,000 Leupold scope while it was ""minding it's own business"". So either you killed these animals on a ""game farm"" or you killed them just for their hides and horns. Lots of people would say that that isn't what a ""real hunter"" would do. As for eating a bear should I be lucky enough to kill one. You better believe I'll eat it. I'll smoke it,grill it, roast it in a crock pot, and fry it up, and the rug will look great on my floor. To answer V-bay gords question as to why you would think another hunter wouldn't eat a bear is because you disrespect all hunters that don't think like you or do it your way. I believe this is who you are and I'm sure you're not this way just about hunting. I thank God you aren't my childrens or grand child's role model. You just don't get it and you never will. This is the last I will say on this subject. (That's what I feel for you)."
3553674,bobbylfishermon,2015-02-17 13:58:00,241,"Draco, people like you kill on game farms, out the window!! Went to Africa, twice, shot the buffalo with a 458 weatherby,the rest with a 338 mag. and a 270.I'm a retired Teamster,a truck driver and a Marine, I saved my money and invested MORE THAN WELL!!! I ate several meals off the animals and was happy to donate the rest to the villagers. They are literally dirt poor. NO HEADS, NO PELTS, a HUNT, that was it. Now go away you jealous little B#$%H."
3552410,Draco1206,2015-02-17 08:06:00,175,"Let me see if I can respond to this without breaking the rules of this forum (as you have). First this is a fishing forum (check the rules) not a general outdoor forum. There is a general discussion forum and even a big game forum on this site for you to put your anti hunting views on. I realize v-bay put this topic on here as maybe a jest for socialized medicine for a bear (with maybe some political rhetoric, also against the rules), but you took it to a totally different subject and used your personal views to slam other hunters and the way they choose to legally hunt. You totally missed my point in what I said. There are so many contradictory and hypocritical things you say in your post and all you could come up with is that I misread what you said about hunting with dogs. As for ""everybody"" agreeing with you, I learned a long time ago just because everyone agrees with you it doesn't make you right. If you had put your views exactly as you stated here on a hunting forum (not on a fishing forum that has a title thread for socialized medicine) you might find some that disagree with your holier than thou attitude. Have some guts and put your views where they belong. It seems to me you are upset with your buddy who wasted his meat and didn't enjoy his hunt so you are taking it out on all other hunters that don't agree with your definition of a real hunter or fair chase. Shame on you and your buddy. He should do more research first and know what to expect, it's no different than choosing a fly in fishing destination, you need to do research and if you don't get what you paid for you've learned a valuable lesson. As for your information I have never hunted bear from a treestand over bait in my life and I am 57 years old, but I defend those that do it that way, or with dogs, or stalking as long as it is legal to do so. I plan on some day scouting a swamp for bear sign, hauling the the bait a mile back into the swamp, put up a treestand, and kill that bear. And yes I will be proud that I did it that way. As for getting on ground level and letting the ""real hunter"" come out on top whether it be bear or hunter. That's why God gave us brains. I'll let ""real men"" like you hunt them at their level. I'm sure you do that with the rabbits, squirrels, deer, or whatever else it is that you kill. But that's easy for you because they can't fight back."
3552450,Draco1206,2015-02-17 08:11:00,175,Thank you Skywagon and Shellback. I knew there were others out there.

I've shot deer, elk, cape buffalo, impala,Ibus, Kudu, they were delicious, and I beat the bush for everyone of them, and I didn't BAIT them !! Are you going to EAT your BEAR when you kill him?

3546002,bobbylfishermon,2015-02-15 11:35:00,241,"Hey Gord, I did veer off topic, but my idea of a HUNT is WAY DIFFERENT . I realize bears can be a pain in the butt and some need to be shot for being such, but, planting your butt in a tree, over apile of garbage, is NOT a hunt. It's anotherway to make money, (a lot of money) and we'll call it a hunt! A real hunter believes in a fair chase hunt(my opinion) and there's abig difference between a slimey #%* fish, and shooting a bear that was probably minding his own business (until he got a whiff of your pile of garbage)Heck, throw out a bale of hay and shoot the neighbors cow or horse, REAL sporty, but that's just me!"

3546626,bobbylfishermon,2015-02-15 14:53:00,241,"pjshorthorn, both, I think, I'm too touchy about 'baiting"" and calling it a hunt. I've hunted since I was a kid (I'm 64) and never baited anything, let alone call it a hunt. If it's not fair chase( no 4wheelers, pickups, snowmachines,horses, boats, planes, baits) I personally don't hunt it !! Baiting in the States is forbidden for any animal, and hearing the words ""bear hunt"" in Canada( Ontario) is a pathetic term to call a fair chase bear hunt. just my opinion."
3546666,v-bay gord,2015-02-15 15:06:00,3168,"Hey Bobby.....well, I kind of agree with you on the baited hunt thing. Doesn't appeal to me, but to each his own I suppose. The one positive about it is that it does allow for the ability to check out the animal. Since shooting females with cubs is a big concern (rightly so) this goes a long way to remedying that. My ""tree hugger"" comment was directed at the southern Ontario lobby group (city folk) who forced the politicians to scrap the spring bear hunt. I would prefer sound wildlife management to prevail over knee jerk reaction. It was an economic factor in the north, and the result is more bear - human conflicts (which in many cases results in a dead bear anyways)."
3546682,SinOrSwim,2015-02-15 15:12:00,1528,"I have to admit, the putting out a bale of hay and shooting a cow made me laugh. I also don't disagree.

3548962,Golden Eagle,2015-02-16 09:20:00,2642,I could accept baiting bears in areas where bear population is out of control. Money could be collected by the government for license fees and it would be a way for outfitters to pick up a few extra bucks. Otherwise I see it as an extremely lame method of shooting a bear. It's certainly not hunting bears. Bears deserve better.

However (from my experience), if the bear is in need of non-life threatening surgery, like for a rotator cuff as an example, he may have to wait a couple of years to be treated, or has the option of going to the States to be treated right away at his own expense. As you can see, it is a huge dilemma for the bear to decide which kind of health care he really wants, but he really does not have a choice. Thank goodness he is now doing well and has plenty of walleye or jackfish to eat, his choice."
