3158401,port1042,2014-09-07 10:36:00,509,"Got home last night from a week at Perrault Lake (Manotak Lodge). We had a good trip and decent weather despite a couple of rainy afternoons. Fishing was a little different this year. Plenty of good fish but none caught worth bragging about. Nice eater walleyes - 15"" to 17"" inches, but none over 18"". Out best smallie was only 16"" and our best northern was 23""! But there were lots of fish. It's funny how things can be so different. When we fished Perrault in the spring we had trouble getting fish small enough to keep. Anyway, I'm certainly not complaining. We got lots of fish and had a great time. Walleyes and smallies were generally picked up jigging crawlers or minnows in 10 to 14 feet. Northerns were picked up on weed edges in 10 to 20 feet of water and mostly on light colored tubes. #7 Shad Raps casted to the weed edges also picked up a few northerns and smallies. Overall, a light colored tube (Salt and Pepper Gitzit) was the most successful. We even picked up a couple of nice perch on those. We could throw them anywhere and wonder what would take it. That's fun. I'll be back to Perrault in the spring unless I can put together a trip to Alaska. Either way I'll be back next fall."

3062129,digjig,2014-08-05 11:33:00,146,We were at Rainbow Point Lodge again just before July 4th. Fishing was great. The wind was blowing pretty good from the south for days and pushed alot of action into the north bay where Rainbow Point Resort and Perrault Lake Camp are located. We targeted the west side of the bay from the mouth past Perrault Lake Camp and the north shore all the way down to the dam. Lots of 19 - 26 inch. VERY soft bite. Slow bottom bouncing or jigging with crawler or minnow seemed to do the trick. 30 second boat ride from camp. Can't beat it. -DJ

3066553,Glenman12,2014-08-06 20:43:00,762,"33 yr veteran of Cedar Lake but had one of our best mornings ever on Perrault..I think it was 3 yrs ago we decided to go up there and fish Jackfish Bay..wasnt my idea but we found it to be very shallow with nothing but hammer handle northerns..two of our four boats took off but we decided to fish the shoreline and bays on the south shore as the wind was blowing in pretty good from the north..between the two remaining boats we got about 50 walleyes in the 20-24"" range...it was a blast.."
3066633,team walleye,2014-08-06 21:04:00,336,"Wow, I have heard good things about Jackfish from people but never had tried it myself. Did you catch the walleye jigging?"
3067257,Glenman12,2014-08-07 07:28:00,762,we didnt get any walleyes in Jackfish...the walleyes we got were caught trolling the south shoreline after we got out of Jackfish heading East working our way back to Cedar..
3112081,port1042,2014-08-21 11:43:00,509,"We will be heading to Perrault Lake one week from tomorrow. Anybody have any updates, reports, or special spots you'd like to share? How is the water level? We had a great week over Memorial Day and can't wait to get back. Reports on Cedar Lake would also be appreciated. I'd really like to stumble into some jumbo perch -- any ideas? Thanks!"
3112401,BornToFish,2014-08-21 14:33:00,1224,"I just returned from fishing two weeks on Perrault Lake. The main lake water temperature was consistently in the 69-71 degree range. The thermocline was at 24 feet. I occasionally noticed a few mayflies in the boat. Weed development was sporadic - good in some places and barren in other places. Water level was about normal for this time of year. The walleyes started out quite high on the various rock humps, often as shallow as ten feet. We were able to anchor on several humps and cast across the top. The surprising thing was that we were catching mid-20 inch walleye every day doing this. - a little unusual for this time of year. Fish over 18 inches were a daily and sometimes hourly occurrence. Some of the walleyes seemed to be heading deeper towards the end of the trip. Most of the ""big"" walleyes left structure to head into the abyss to chase ciscoes. I noticed ciscoes 'jumping"" out of the water on calmer evenings towards the end of my trip. I caught them in 21 fow of water or so on my last day of fishing last week. A few places on the lake showed walleyes on a fairly consistent basis. Other places were ""on"" for a few days and then turned ""off"" for a few days. I found that I was needing to check places everyday to see which ones were showing fish that day. Northern pike were in their usual places. It seemed as though not as many ""big"" pike were on the rock humps for this time of year. Several ""smaller"" muskies were caught by guests at the Lodge that were casting reed edges. I raised a few nicer fish on deeper weed edges. Smallies were on the edges of rock humps and shoreline structure. Most of my better fish came out of 18-20 fow using a jig + leech. Perch were sporadic. My best perch fishing was in Jackfish fishing pockets of low grass weed. It wasn't a banner trip for perch in view of the sporadic weeds. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
