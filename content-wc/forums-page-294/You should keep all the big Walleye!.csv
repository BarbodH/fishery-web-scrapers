2491058,doubleheader,2014-02-26 07:39:00,2652,Well said.
2491394,last chance,2014-02-26 08:43:00,3262,"its took me awhile to chime in on this thread. but I fish the central basin of erie and pretty much all the fish I catch is over 6 lbs and many 8 9 and 10 lb+ fish. if I threw back every big fish I caught I wouldn't have many fish to take home. every one that fishes the central basin of erie is fishing a different world for eyes. if you live a few miles from erie and can fish any time you want and catch your limit and stock your freezer for the off season that is great. I live 335 miles from erie and get to make one 2 week trip a year. I pay more for my out of state license than you do. and spend a small fortune on gas and camping and food while im there. so whats so wrong with taking a small freezer for my fish?? I catch fish on my 1st day and don't want to just store them on ice for 14 days. we may only fish 8 or 10 days a year and most of those days we don't get limits like the people who fish there every day and know where the fish are. we have to start hunting for the schools and then try to catch them. so I am one of those people that bought a small freezer for my erie trip. I got an 80 qt freezer and it gets full then we keep the rest of our fish on ice until we go home. but we don't keep near as many fish as the guys that lives there and fishes the entire season. I have been fishing erie for about 25 yrs now and I don't think there is any lake that is like erie. if you want to let your big fish go then by all means do so. but as long as the law allows and the fishing is as good as its been i'll keep going to erie and keep what I catch. if the fish population goes down enough then the dnr will step in and drop the limits. so you don't have to worry about erie at this time. I wouldn't say there is to many big fish in erie, I like it just fine. there is thousands of big fish taken from erie each year. they catch them through the ice and then during the jig bite and most of the ones caught on the central basin are large fish. and they have been keeping these fish for as long as I have been fishing erie and so far erie still has plenty of big fish to go around."
2491466,SinOrSwim,2014-02-26 08:53:00,1528,"This. someone else said in this thread they wouldn't blame someone fishing 25 years to catch that 30"" fish and taking it. WHY??? If you let it go maybe a few more people could catch that fish and have that memory. I have one fish right at 30"" and have been going for 20+ years. If people let those big hogs go, how many more in our group would have a 30 incher?Take a look at Hawk Lake Lodge. I haven't been there but am really hoping to. They catch a TON of fish over 30"". Why? Maybe it's just a great fishery............but MAYBE it's because they are catch and release. Comparing Erie to lakes in MN and Canada is like apples to oranges. They aren't nearly the same thing."
2491914,walleye-bum,2014-02-26 10:41:00,356,If you goal is to catch a 30 inch walleye then you need to go fish a body of water that produces 30 inch fish consistently. Last year we boated 13 fish 30 and over out of my boat. It is all about the body of water. Here on the great lakes there are very few people that throw any back. But yet there are plenty of big fish. It is all about if a system can support a lot of big fish. If it can they will be there. A small fish on the great lake waters I mainly fish is 3 pounds. The average fish is 4 to 6 pounds. And almost every night out we will catch fish 7 plus. Just because it takes you 25 years to catch a 30 on the lake you fish doesn't mean the same applies every were else. Every body of water is different.
2491954,Fisherman Ted,2014-02-26 10:50:00,461,"I too have not chimed in on this thread. Too much testosterone during this chilly winter! Lake Erie aside. If lake Erie can produce big fish all the while allowing fishermen to bring them home that is excellent. More power to that great fishery! The bigger question I see or raise is what does one value or look for when going fishing, specifically for monsters (in this case walleye)? As the previous poster said and from what I have seen personally many fishermen (but not all) enjoy catching the fish of a lifetime and doing so more than once in a lifetime. The pleasure is in the catching. If you want to show it off get a replica made, they look dynamite. Would you rather continue to catch fish of a lifetime over and over, or catch one every 20 years (previous post). Assuming a fishery can sustain trophy fish while all the while releasing them to be caught another day I personally think it's much more fun to keep catching them, have my kids catch 30s, 35s and even have a shot at a 40. Put another way, I would pay to have a walleye fish fry (of not 25+ inch fish) if I knew my buddies chances of catching a 30 would increase exponentially as I and all the other fisherman in a particular lake were throwing them back. And I bet my buddy would agree with me ten times over. Lake Erie apparently does not have this conflict, but I would suspect most other lakes are not so lucky. -FT"
2492338,SinOrSwim,2014-02-26 12:04:00,1528,"I guess I didn't realize my goal was any different than other peoples goal? I have never heard anyone getting ready to go on a fishing trip and say.........boy I sure hope we don't catch any big ones. Teh point is we wouldn't all have to travel to Erie to do it. Again, you are comparing apples and oranges in respect to fisheries. I have caught one 30"" fish in my life. It was about 9 years ago and I can tell you, I remember almost everythign about that fight and landing. How hot it was, how calm it was, how the boat moved, how we thought I had a snag to the big runs it would make. I took pictures and let it go. I now have a replica in my garage (wifes rules lol) and everytime my 3 year old walks by it he says..........big fish.......daddy's fish. If I had taken that fish nobody would have had the chance to catch it again. I have no idea if anyone did but I can GUARANTEE they wouldn't had I mounted it. Why not give someone else that chance to tell the fish story when they get back. Not all lake systems have the growing season and forage Erie has. Again, your argument is apples vs oranges. Not everyone wants the experience of Erie. Huge difference between that and a small lake in the middle of Ontario.I understand I'm not like some but I agree with Fisherman Ted 100%. Also, I have no interest in a trip where I catch 100+ 16 to 18 fish a day. I'd rather catch 10 to 20 and have a few BIG ones in there. In Canada, the growing season is so short it takes a long time for those fish to get that size. We will agree to disagree. But, it is interesting how many people don't care about taking one yet many of the posts on this site are trying to find locations to find that big one?"
2492906,Blades-n-Beads,2014-02-26 14:39:00,484,"I didn't get an answer to a question I had on this subject so I did some research and answered my own question and information I did not know. Obviously the southern states walleye fisheries walleye grow at a much faster rate and actually have a shorter life span! I did not know that on average walleye in the south rarely see 15 years of age but they will be at or above the 10lb mark. Canadian shield lakes is way different. The average life span is 26 years and weight will be 10-13lbs with females being 28""-31"". Male walleye rarlely live beyond 15-20 years and rarely longer than 21"". lake Erie from I have recently read is a fishery on steroids. This water is like nothing else in comparison. The forage and habitat will produce fish of not normal size, some reports suggest this body of water cannot be compared to and managed with standard methods used for walleye fisheries. It's that different. So for me knowing a few more facts from biologist. Would I keep a 30"" fish from the far north knowing it is at its end of life span? For me I would take photos, measurements, weight and another photo and yet another photo releasing it. If I were on lake Erie, it's a different story! I take photos of the fish going in my live well."
3540554,ohiojmj,2015-02-13 14:25:00,1262,You guys are responding to a year old post.
3541210,Ebarnett,2015-02-13 18:35:00,60,You mean the fish they are talking about are even bigger now? Awesome!
3542066,kzoofisher,2015-02-14 06:44:00,5144,"I know, right? Seriously, the fact that Erie has these fish in these numbers is awesome but the lesson of the numbers is even more awesome. As the biologist said in Lance's post; in a lake that big, where the forage and habitat are ample for the reproduction, the fishing pressure isn't enough to reduce the population. This is true for almost every lake we fish if we adjusted our take to match what the lake could withstand. That is a very complicated business and goes against the grain of a majority of walleye fisherman. They want a limit first and foremost. On a lake that is just a few thousand acres it is pretty easy for ten or twenty boats a week to reduce the population of 15""-22"" fish enough that you will almost never see a 28"". And if the lake has really good numbers of eater size fish it is going to see a lot more than twenty boats a week. We are our own worst enemies when it comes to building quality fisheries. We take out the fish we want and throw back all the hammer handles to eat the walleye and the walleye forage. Check out the Walleye 101 Facebook page to see what a pike can eat and then imagine what those overpopulated hammer handles can do to the walleye fingerlings we stock every year to make up for the harvest. Leave the big pike and big walleye and the hammer handle problem will take care of itself pretty quickly. What do all the great fisheries have in common? Size and/or remoteness that forces the pressure to be less than what is allowable for maximum sustainable yield. Even so, it takes pretty constant monitoring by biologists to keep the balance on a lot of these waters. Erie gets its limits reviewed and reset yearly. Limits had to be reduced throughout Ontario. Do you think Lac Seul could sustain the fishery it has if it was half way between Minneapolis and Chicago instead of a long days drive away? I know a lot of people hate complicated regulations but they really would improve many of our fisheries if we could get them."
3542786,Guest,2015-02-14 10:04:00,0,"I love catching fish. Big or small, it's still fun. When going to Erie we don't say ""hope we do not catch any big ones"" but we usually say ""hope we catch some nice eaters."" Big difference. Catching 10 pounders almost seems routine at times but eating them surely isn't."
3544402,NP4ME,2015-02-14 19:50:00,378,Couldn't have been put better.
3544738,bigwillies,2015-02-14 22:42:00,515,ha!
3546882,octanehi5,2015-02-15 16:08:00,1104,"By all means if the lake your fishing has that kind of walleye population in it,and contiues to sustain it, has daily take home limit. These fish are not the best table fair as lets say a20"" fish. but I am sure these fish are not going to waste. If you feel you need to put them back by all means do so. I have worked at the hatchery on Onieda, witch happens to be one of the top walleye producing lakes in NY. A 8lb fish is rare on the lake because its heavily fished. But produces 320 Million fry every yr. True fact the 22 to 26"" walleye are the best egg producers. This is were 80% of the eggs harvested come from those size fish. On the other hand I do a fly in trip to northern Quebec for a week every yr. The lake is a virtual walleye factory. The outfitter has set slot limits on the lake,of fish you can keep, Its 4 walleye's a day per person, the slot is from 14"" to 20"" Bigger or smaller go back in the lake. Over my last 10 yrs. of fishing this lake I have watched the average size of fish being caught increase every yr, Were as now I do not even keep them below 18"". They also do not allow more than 4 walleye's to go home per person. My personal best Numbers on this lake in a weeks time is just over 900 walleye's What it boils down to you need to follow the rules of the lake you fish,and it will pay you back 10 fold"
3547210,Bassmandpe,2015-02-15 18:32:00,42,Over a year ago I posted this. You guys explained that this resourse can take the pressure of removing the big wallleye very well. Good to see and most of the respones were to the point. I have just been used to fishing lakes not so loaded with big walleye. Catch & release is a mainstay here in Florida for bass where I live. Hope you all have a great year fishing!
3548370,brochet,2015-02-16 06:36:00,88,"to comment on your thread,26 yr walley weight 10 to 13 lbs.in Canadian shield lakes.as a bush pilot,i fished lakes that were never fished before,you could catch all the walleys you wanted yet you could not catch one over 5lbs.these fish were mature fish,males and females spawning together.if you caught a pike it was huge,denoting that the fish in this lake were mostly old mature fish.by the way,you would be hard pressed to catch a walleye under 4 lbs.my point being,whoever is telling us about the life cycles of fish leave room for doubt.i hope there right about erie."
2494810,MrSimon,2014-02-27 06:25:00,922,"History shows us that people tend to take when the taken's good, and complain when things dry up. I hope that doesn't happen with Lake Erie."
2494994,brochet,2014-02-27 07:17:00,88,I fished areas in remote sections of quebec many times where there were lots of walleye spawning. these fish were very old mature fish yet the vast majority were not over 5 lbs.age dosent nessarely mean size.
2495154,SinOrSwim,2014-02-27 07:45:00,1528,"Again, it's Erie. Not NW Ontario or Minnesota. Apples and oranges. Have you ever heard anyone going to Canada hope they don't catch any big ones?I think some of the difference is there are people who fish to catch and some people who fish to eat. We have had guys complain because the lakes we used to go to had conservation licenses only. Plus, no fish taken home. They said what's the point? The point is to CATCH big walleye and abundance of them. If everyone was taking fish home it wouldn't happen. The outfitters that have control over that on their fisheries make those rules for a reason. Even those lakes and systems arent' the same as say Lac Seul. Different monsters."
2495162,AllenW,2014-02-27 07:45:00,11482,"X2 Nice post Juls, always nice to get the other side of the argument from someone who's actually there. I wonder how many of the C&R people also believe in ZPG? Few I bet. al"
2495170,SinOrSwim,2014-02-27 07:46:00,1528,Nope. What is available to eat is a big factor. Some of those lakes are very shallow and don't have good water movement. Their forage is different so they don't grow that big.
2498642,115 optimax,2014-02-28 01:50:00,650,"Canada biologist figure 18 -21 inchers are prime reproducers.It works excellent on Lac Seul.Let them keep their big ones on the Great Lakes if it works,but don't bring that mentality here.I would say there are only a few local fish hogs here and its usually the same ones who keep big ones.They sit at the landing showing off their fish and bragging about them.I guess they don't realize every body is catching big ones taking pictures and letting them go.I always practice CPR ""Catch,Photograph and release.:thumbsup"
2498650,115 optimax,2014-02-28 02:46:00,650,"When we go to lac Seul it is often hard to catch eaters between 16-18 inches.I would love to go to Erie and catch 10 pounders,just once."
3538602,IL John,2015-02-13 06:48:00,45,"As long as the fish is legal in the body of water your in nobody should chime in, imo. I've been on two trips to Erie and smallest walleye ive caught was 26""."
3538666,Mike Borger,2015-02-13 07:05:00,1554,"I would never question anyone's legal right to keep fish regardless of the size, plus I'm not familiar enough with the fishery on Erie to comment on the situation.What I'm wondering though is are those giant walleye's actually safe to eat? Aren't they loaded with contaminants?I do eat steelhead out of Erie but only little skippers - wouldn't dream of eating a larger one."
3539906,Lance Valentine,2015-02-13 10:49:00,59,"I guide daily on the Detroit River in the spring and Erie during most of the summer. My clients and I get hammered every season about posting pix of big fish...some kept some released. I decided to ask a good friend of mine who is a fisheries biologist and has spent the last 10 years working daily studying the walleye population in Lake Erie. I respect his opinion, and was curious if keeping big fish from the River in spring has a negative impact on the fishery and if I needed to amend my ""kept fish"" policies. Below is an email I sent to him, and his response. Do with it as you will. Lance Valentine Okay, please help me make sense of something, and hopefully help others understand it too. looking at some of the Erie population estimates I see some things: 1. estimated population is about 17.7 million is west/central 2. about 20% of these fish (about 4 million) are age 7 or older 3. about 15% of these fish (about 3 million) are age 5 meaning that about 7 million fish are age 5 or older. Here are my questions: 1. Are we at a point where there are too many big eyes in the system where the baitfish population is not sufficiently large or diversified enough to support this ""skewed"" age distribution? 2. With these numbers, how much does harvest in the Detroit River of the numerous 8-12 lb fish hurt the overall population is Erie? 3. Are bait populations able to support the large number of bigger fish in Erie over the summer months? Lance Question 1: (Are we at a point where there are too many big eyes in the system where the baitfish population is not sufficiently large or diversified enough to support this ""skewed"" age distribution?) No. Thankfully Erie is the most productive of the Great Lakes and has a very diverse forage population. Walleye literally have choices among preferred prey types, and have plenty of other choices if preferred prey is lacking. Depending on seasons and migration they can choose to eat emerald shiners, gizzard shad, and rainbow smelt. Emerald shiners alone are probably enough, but depending on the year gizzard shad can carry the load late in the season when they get big enough and smelt are plentiful down east for the ones that choose to migrate. If all else fails the fish that hang out on structure can select gobies and the open water fish can dine on some yellow perch or white perch. The only time of year that there could possibly be an imbalance is in the western basin during spawning because you literally have millions of walleye in a relatively small area, and even then they do just fine on what is available. Question 2: (With these numbers, how much does harvest in the Detroit River or on the reefs in spring of the numerous 8-12 lb fish hurt the overall population is Erie?) You can apply this question to all areas of Erie and the reefs in spring, I don't believe it is specific to the Detroit River. We really don't believe, and don't have a single indication, that the number of females spawning (or lack thereof in the case of your question) has any impact on the resulting year class. The 2003 year class is the best example, as we were hitting fairly low population numbers and got our biggest hatch ever. I truly believe the real bottleneck is survival of the fish that hatch, not how many eggs are laid or how many larvae hatch. We have enough hatching every year to have a mega-hatch. We just need them to get transported to nursery areas by prevailing currents and need them to have food when their yolk sac is used up. History says that prevailing inshore current flow when the fish hatch gives us big year classes, and prevailing offshore current flow at hatching gives us bad year classes. Timing of plankton hatches is critical, but if the fry aren't where the plankton is it doesn't matter-survival will be poor regardless of the number of spawning females and eggs laid. I will also default to my standard answer, which is why does it matter if they are harvested in spring? We harvest more females in the summer than we ever do in the spring, especially young females. If we were getting bad year classes because of too few females in the system, we would have significantly changed harvest strategies years ago. It makes no difference if a female is harvested in July or the following March. She isn't spawning either way. I really wish that closing spring harvest would make a difference, but our data says it doesn't make a bit of difference. We would close the spring today if we knew it would improve year classes, but there is NO data to support that it would. Question 3: (Are bait populations able to support the large number of bigger fish in Erie over the summer months?) Yes. The beauty of Erie is that they can migrate all the way to Buffalo if necessary (or north to your river and also Lake Huron) and follow the temperature they need and the bait that they want. In cold years they can stay from Kelley's to Cleveland and do just fine, in warmer years they can go way east and stay cold and fat. There are not forage limitations. One thing that has always stayed consistent is condition factors (how much a walleye weighs compared to its length). Over the wide range of population sizes and conditions that we have tested the past 30 years we have not seen a change in the walleyes' length to weight relationship. These are fat healthy walleye. Let me know if you have any further questions. These responses are my personal opinion based on 10 years of working on Erie. We learn new things every year, but many of the things that I outlined above stay consistent. As a side note one small egg mat set on Locust Reef as part of an Ohio State research project had 14,000 fertilized, live eggs on it yesterday. The mat is simply a furnace filter in a frame. Can you imagine that? Think how many eggs are out there on the reef complex right now if one tiny egg mat caught 14,000 in about a week."
2492962,tooski,2014-02-26 14:57:00,393,-I have never heard anyone getting ready to go on a fishing trip and say.........boy I sure hope we don't catch any big ones- Not to be obtuse but that is exactly what we say before heading out on Erie.....
2493562,Guest,2014-02-26 17:25:00,0,"This is only my own experience. I'm sure I don't fish walleye anywhere near some on this board. I've never fished Erie, although I'm a Pennsylvanian, I live at the oposite side of the State. Years ago, my buddies and I fished the Oswego Harbor area of Lake Ontario. The big walleye fishery was amazing. We started with guided trips. A proficient guide fishing at night in the harbor could provide his clients with 12 walleye in the 26 to 30 inch class and sometimes a bit larger. We began fishing from our own boats and although we didn't get their numbers we did get size. By then it was a waning fishery. The guides have gone elsewhere for the most part. Lake Ontario certainly still has monster walleye but I can't help feeling that many could have been released in the Oswego Harbor area to keep the fishery viable. Forward another bunch of years to a giant walleye fishery that few knew about. Happens to be the most awesome night of fishing walleye I was ever a part of and I didn't catch a fish. This nights fishing occurred within sight of the thousand island bridge over the St Lawrence river that thousands of fisherman cross on their way to Canada. My friend Tom, who is now departed, was a every chance he got fisherman. Somehow he became aware of a big walleye fishery above the bridge that not many knew existed. We anchored to a dock in a narrow channel after dark and Tom proceeded to fill a bag.....a big bag, with a limit of walleye....12.....that ranged from 6 to 13 pounds. Tom knew exactly where to throw his deep jr thunderstick and kept me busy with the net. I was new to walleye fishing and I will never forget seeing those submarines come into the light prior to being netted. That fishery is gone. too many guys became proficient at taking a limited fishery without returning anything. Indeed, Erie may be a different fishery....I hope it is....but its been my choice to return large walleye for many years now. I just wanted to relate my own observations. Take it for what it is. I don't have a problem with anyone doing there own thing within the law."
2493882,kzoofisher,2014-02-26 18:46:00,5144,"Erie is a fishery with very good reproduction and great growth rates, you just can't compare it to anything else. The average size right now is so large that you have to adjust your ""fish of a lifetime"" scale. Anywhere you fish you have to judge a trophy by what is the average size of fish in the lake, what is top 20% and what is top 5%, which is where I put trophies. I would bet that on Erie the top 5% is over 10#, maybe even bigger. The place is just really different and a lot of that is thanks to gobies. It has been on a steady upswing for a couple of decades now, who knows if it will last so if you want to experience it better get there."

We usually don't know the Michigan limit until close to the last minute, I suppose Ohio and Ontario are the same. If memory serves we're living off a couple of great year classes from 5 and 6 years ago but the more recent ones have been a little disappointing. Erie is a great fishery but it isn't infinite."

2485553,tuiflies,2014-02-24 21:02:00,158,"I read an article a few years ago by an Ontario biologist who suggested that the largest females (in pike and muskie fisheries) have the largest potential offspring. While the 30"" walleye may not be the most efficient or prolific spawners, they may have better odds at producing the next records. I usually release everything over slot but I I live in NWO and manage to get fishing almost 100 days a year. If I was further south and fished Erie much less frequently (catching few fish under 18""'s) maybe my opinion would be different. It certainly seems that the ODNR has their finger on the pulse but mistakes have been made before. Either way, I'll continue to let the big beauties swim."

Went to a PWT tournament at Port Clinton years ago and every fish that was caught was filleted for the homeless shelters/poor. Did not bother me at all. What does bother me and always has is that you can fish the Ohio waters of Lake Erie every day of the week and keep your limit every day. I have meet people in the campgrounds that actually bring chest freezers with them and attempt to fill them up with fish. Now come on, that to me is just gluttony! I can see someone wanting to have some fish to take home but good Lord how many do you need? A full chest freezer? I wish Ohio would put a possession limit of 2 or 3 days of fish on the books."

I have said it before - why the heck can't some of our American biologists listen to and benefit by the reseach and studies done by their Canadian counterparts??? There ARE facts out there.....
2449722,roscoe33,2014-02-13 20:44:00,653,"What are you missing? Well, it's John Gillespie. Only a slight glimmer of the man his father was. Lake Erie walleyes aside, it hard to listen to anything he says."
2450169,walleye-bum,2014-02-14 06:19:00,356,"Who are you to question what the choices of someone else are, if they are following the law? They paid for there license. So why do you feel you have any right to call them and ask them anything about what they did?If you want to let every big fish go that is your choice. If they want to keep them that is there's."
2450641,MrSimon,2014-02-14 08:11:00,922,"Good grief, man. Relax. He had a question so he went directly to the source and asked. He got his answer, did some additional research, and drew his own conclusions. I think he handled it just fine. A whole lot better than just jumping on an internet forum and complaining about something he saw on TV."
2453218,brochet,2014-02-15 06:39:00,88,"there is absolutely no good reason to keep a big walley,or any big fish.take a picture or get a replica mount.fishing pressure is to great.it doesnt matter how big the lake is.a true sportsman will release a fish ."
2453322,walleye-bum,2014-02-15 07:06:00,356,Well I guess about 98 percent of all fisherman are not true sportsman then. According to your logic.
2453330,Bill Krejca,2014-02-15 07:06:00,6107,"I don't personally know whether it is biologically meaningful, from a reproduction standpoint, for the big ones to be kept, or released. Does releasing the biggies result in proportionately bigger strains of their off spring, due to genetics, or are they less likely to produce as well as the medium size fish, due to reduced capacity/ hatching? If they are not released, does this somehow prevent the smaller fish from fulfiling their reproduction? I do know if a big one is kept, it will no longer reproduce. I do know if kept, no one else will be able to catch it. I do know, having lived long enough, to see some negative relatively long term effects of over harvesting in quite a number of water systems. Perhaps (probably?) Lake Erie is unique. I don't know. Bill"
2453370,Juls,2014-02-15 07:12:00,13414,"Nice jab. You obviously do not fish Lake Erie. On an average day we are catching 4 to 10 pound fish here. This system is not like any other in the country. They grow big and they grow fast. The largest hatch was in 2003 and those fish are now close to the 10+ pound range. In other words, we have plenty of big fish in the lake. We have a limit of 6 per person here during the months from May 1st to February 28th, and 4 per person in march and April during the spawn. Every year on May 1st they give us the limits for the year. So, that tells you that the ODNR does keep up with their studies of the lake and it's quotas, all in an effort to make sure it's protected. Poachers and double dippers do more damage than the average fisherman taking his legal limit, and are not sportsmen. Whether you catch and release, or keep your limit, both are sportsmen in my book. Contrary to those who believe that the big fish taste bad, they don't. You just need to know how to clean them properly. You wouldn't be able to tell if it was a big fish or a little fish I was serving you unless I told you. With that said, I do believe that people should only take what they need, and not stuff their freezers, and their friends, family, and neighbor's freezers, full of fish. I found this article that sums up what a ""True Sportsman"" is. What Is a Sportsman By Tony Robinson In its most basic form, Webster defines a Sportsman as ""One who pursues the sports of the field; one who hunts, fishes, etc."" However, among Sportsman this seems to come up a good bit short. It becomes apparent that there are several key components to being a true sportsman. The most obvious of these is a love for the outdoors and all that is within it. The sportsman must then have an unwavering and steadfast character for the laws and ethics of fair chase. He rebukes those that fail. With the betterment of the sport at heart, he leads, educates and donates his time, talents and resources as best he can. At the turn of the nineteenth century, man was beginning to see what had been a land of plenty being abused by many. This was a time when market hunting was rampant and the realizations of doom became obvious for many fish and game species. It was the early days of laws and wardens. Those that saw the need for a turning point in mans attitude towards conservation and the rules of fair chase cried out. Possibly the most applicable definition of what is a Sportsman can be derived from an event in time that is over one hundred years old. The event was the ""Anglers Convention"" and was held at the American Museum of History. The comments where from three unique and notable men directed at those attending the event. According to a 1907 New York Times article, then President Theodore Roosevelt directed a letter to the convention through its chairman Dr. Henry Van Dyke. ""My Dear Dr. Van Dyke; I wish that I could be present at the ""Honest Anglers' "" Convention, but as I cannot, I wish to write you god speed in your admirable work. The men assembled in this convention stand for true sport of a high standard, and like most genuine sportsmen, they are lovers of outdoor life and of natural history, and are believers in manliness; and they particularly object to any form of wasteful destruction. You stand for the promotion and support of laws to protect the food and game fishes, so that they shall not be exterminated but may continue in increasing abundance, to supply food to the multitude and good sport to those who keep the law."" ""You encourage the spirit of fair play. You insist upon doing your fishing in straightforward, sportsmanlike fashion, and you in every way discourage the noxious craze for record breaking as regards the amount of the catch. The latter I consider especially important. There are few things, which a naturalist and sportsman should more heartily condemn than reckless and wasteful slaughter. To make a very large bag, whether of deer, or prairie chicken, or ducks or quail, or woodcock, or trout, is something of which to be ashamed and not to boast."" In the absence of then Ex-President Grover Cleveland, his letter to the convention stated; ""If anglers are to retain an honorable place in the fraternity of true sportsmanship, their constant effort must be to save themselves and the present generation from the demoralization of fishing hoggery, and to preserve and transmit to themselves and others that come after them the delightful traditions and wholesome limitations which belong to their craft."" ""They can adopt no motto better descriptive of what their design and purpose should be than is found in the following language taken from the invitation I have received to attend the coming convention"": ""To encourage the adoption of angling methods which will make the wholesale slaughter of fish impossible, and increase the sport of taking a fair number in a fair way"". Dr. Henry Van Dyke, a Professor at Princeton at the time and Chairman of Anglers Convention, preceded to give the following definition of what is a true Sportsman. ""The true sportsman is a man who finds his recreation in a fair and exciting effort to get something that is made for human use in a way that involves some hardship, a little risk, a good deal of skill and patience, and plenty of out-of-door-life"". So, in all likelihood, mans vision of what is a Sportsman may, with the exception of a few points, be a philosophical one at best. If that were the case, then here is my own. A sportsman is one whose body and spirit seek the pursuit of the waters fins, the forests furs and the winds feathers. He honors and respects his role as steward of all that is wild. He measures his success with knowledge acquired, compassion given and restraint taken. The law of the land is only the introduction to his book of conduct. With wisdom and fairness he manages the gardens of life. Self-discipline allows for his consumption without waist. His walk is tall among his kindred and admired by his friends."
2453490,walleye-bum,2014-02-15 07:55:00,356,A true sportsman would not criticize a fellow sportsman for following regulations and keeping fish they want to keep. Looking down at someone else who is following laws and regs just because there views might be different from yours is in my opinion unsportsmanlike. Every person who buys a license is entitled to fish how they choose(within the law of coursre). Tight lines to you.
2442266,Bassmandpe,2014-02-11 19:41:00,42,"Recently watched a show from John Gillespie""s Waters & Woods in which they were ice fishing on Lake Erie out of Port Clinton, Ohio. Big walleyes were being caught from six to twelve pounds. I did not see any fish going back into the ice hole released. In fact, one of the fisherman caught a fish believed to be a ten pounder. Gillespie asked him if it was going on the wall? His answer was, ""have to ask his wife?"" Well, that one was not going back for sure. Near the end of the show Gillespie caught and weighed in a 12-2 fish. Did not see one fish being released in the entire show. Sent an email to the website and got this reply. "" A Captain of the Lake Erie Charter Boat association was with us and he says he works a lot with the biologists on Lake Erie- there is a safe allowable number of walleyes that can be taken on Lake Erie, according to the quota. IF WE DO NOT TAKE THEM, THE COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN WILL,"" I have since done quite a bit of research on the Lake Erie Walleye. No need to go into it here. Just doesn't sit well with me to kill all these big fish. Not good eaters, major breeding fish and a body of water that has had major problems well documented. What am I missing? I don't keep a Walleye over 18 inches."
2442354,Guest,2014-02-11 19:59:00,0,"You are missing a bunch, good back and do more research. Ohio banned commercial eye fishing in the 70s and the Canadians are on a quota as is ALL recreational fishing. Plus big old females are not prime breeders. AND Erie has been the greatest walleye fishery in the world and still is. Finally, we go thru this crap every year, usually in the winter lol If you don't want to keep them great, there'll be more for us."
2442370,KC Walleye,2014-02-11 20:00:00,274,"There has been much debate over the years on Erie standards for keeping fish. Many threads on here have had discussions about your very issue. Short answer always seems to be, Erie is different and can sustain it's population. Growth rates are discussed as well."
2442985,Bassmandpe,2014-02-12 05:41:00,42,"Good reply, I had orginally ask the show people why they did not get replicas for their big fish. There is a good article in the Walleye Central article section by Jonathan Shoemaker regarding Lake Erie fishing. Just have a problem killing big fish but understand the Lake Erie sisuation."
2443129,MrSimon,2014-02-12 06:28:00,922,Just because a lake is big and can handle high pressure and harvest rates .... doesn't mean we don't need conservation rules in place.
2443313,Aaron-IN,2014-02-12 07:34:00,500,Erie has had conservation rules in place and they obviously are working.
2443409,Mike Kansas,2014-02-12 07:40:00,1463,"I'm don't know about Lake Erie in regards to what should be released in order to promote the best reproductive scenario. I have always believed that the best size Walleye for reproductin are the ones that are in the 24""to 27"" size in any water system. This is simply based on some articles I have read in regard to the reason for slot limits. I'm sure that conditions vary from lake to lake and I'm also sure that any Walleye that is removed from any lake regardless of it's size will never reproduce. What to keep and what to release will be a ongoing debate. For me it is simply do what you think is right...it's a lot like the rest of things in life. The RIGHT thing is the thing to do. Mike Kansas"
2443449,catchingkman,2014-02-12 07:52:00,104,"The dnr said at rules meeting that they want the big fish out, when I talked with them after the meeting it was said to me this way: the 24 to 27 inch walleye lay as many eggs as the 28 to 32 inch walleye and only eat 2/3 rds what the large fish do. and there is to many large fish in the system at this time. it was news to me they thought this way, but they know the system better then I. kman"
2443593,Mike Kansas,2014-02-12 08:13:00,1463,"Good information, it makes sense."
2443697,Lake Wisconsin,2014-02-12 08:28:00,1960,"The first time I fished erie, I was with a friend from the area. I caught a nice 28"" fish, took a photo and slipped it back into the water. He was pi**ed, and I didnt' know what to say. All I will say, it is a different body of water and folks in that area have different perspective on their resource. It is a great fishery and tough to argue. If you fish there, do as you please within the limits of the law. Same as any other place."
