1543147,grand pa,2013-02-25 15:31:00,5,hellow to all july 14 2013 will be my first time fishing nagagami lake. I will be taking my 11 year old grandson. we will be staying at pullens camp. any help me can get will be deeply appretiated. I don't know to much on how to fish but hope to have some luck on our side. Just from reading some of your trips we may have lucked up on picking a good lake. Good luck on your next trip
1543985,adempsey,2013-02-27 08:01:00,963,"Hope you have a good trip. We had some good fishing when we went last summer. Although, we stayed at the south end. Pullen's is located at the northern end of the lake in Deep Bay. Looks like some good fishing spots in that area. I was hoping to head up that way for some Pike fishing, but never managed to get that far.Here's a depth map of the lake (for fishing, not navigation). Another with some labels (doesn't mean they are accurate though ;P).The larger open areas of the lake can get rough when the wind picks up, so keep that in mind if you plan on traveling down that way.Have a good trip!"
1544400,grand pa,2013-02-28 05:59:00,5,"Thank you for the info, the lake map looks great, if you should read about two old men and two young boys running around the lake acting crazy don't worry that will be me"
1546777,buckeyedan,2013-03-05 06:42:00,44,"Recently got our party squared away, deposits are sent, and fly-in to Walton's is June 29 (115 days)! Grand Pa - you chose a great lake. When I was a kid, we stayed at Nagagami Lodge (now Pullens') and it's a beautiful camp. We have had quite a bit of luck fishing that end of the lake in recent years. As you're heading out of deep bay, once you clear the rocks at the mouth of the bay on the left hand side, there is some structure and some weeds that run parallel to the shoreline all the way out toward Chuck's Point. That has become one of our ""go-to"" areas, and it's not far at all from Pullen's. adempsey has the general area marked on his first map with a ""W""."
1546834,grand pa,2013-03-05 08:06:00,5,"We just really want to thank you guys for all the info -- the first place we will fish is the structure just left after leaving deep bay --- the only mistake I may have made is booking in July, because I don't think the kids can control themselves that long. Good luck to all and hope to read about some great fishing trips this year."
3560026,Guest,2015-02-19 08:40:00,0,Planning my first fishing trip ever. Any tips welcome. Kayvee Lodge is our destination early June.
1466043,Seanik,2012-07-25 09:18:00,218,"We had a great week at Kay Vee Lodge on Lake Nagagami, the weather was hot with low winds and a mostly glass flat lake. The fishing was outstanding with morning catches of Walleyes near or above 40 by 11:00Am. The largest Walleye was 27"" and at times it was difficult to get fish under the 18"" slot for lunch. The most productive area was a sunken island straight out from Kay Vee, The island comes up to 9' and drops off to 25-30', the best level was 12-16' at the drop off. the best bait set up was a bottom bouncer attached to a floating harness tipped with a leech, crawlers were also very effective. The best plug was a red HotenTot. Kay Vee Lodge provides outstanding service to it's clients, the best I have expierenced in over 40 years of Ontario fishing trips. The 16' Lunds equiped with 20hp Yamahas are cleaned and ,bailed if it rained each day by the dock crew. Upon leaving the dock for fishing a dock attendent assists you into the boat if necessary and unties the mooring lines, when returning you are assisted in tieing up the boat and your days catch is collected, cleaned, filleted and delivered to your cabin. The cabins are very clean and comfortable with fresh towels midweek. We made mid July 2013 reservations before leaving. I welcome any questions about Nagagami Lake, please contact me through the message function of WC. Seanik"
1466072,adempsey,2012-07-25 10:15:00,963,"Thanks for the report. I was waiting to see how your trip went. We were up the week before and had a great time. That sunken island really sounds like a productive spot. There were usually six boats fishing it when I was there. I have it marked for next time.I also thought that Kay Vee used cedar boats?? Guess I was wrong, but I thought I saw some guys staying at the lodge motoring around in some."
1466176,vteye,2012-07-25 14:07:00,812,How did you do on the pike? Sounds like a great walleye fishery.
1466221,Seanik,2012-07-25 16:03:00,218,"Vteye, We did not fish specifically for Pike but while Walleye fishing 5-6 Pike were caught each day. The Pike were on the small side 24-27"" and mixed in with the Walleyes. One off our group returns to Kay Vee the 1st week of Sept. to fish for big Pike. The method used is large shiners attached to a big bobber in the shallows near the river mouths. Several 40""+ Pike are caught and released, this is his 3rd year of Sept. Nagagami Lake Pike fishing and he says it's been better each year. Adempsey, Kay Vee Lodge has 16"" lunds exclusively, Expeditions North has a mixture of 16' Lunds and 16'Nadens and I belive are switching over to color depth finders. TimberLake Lodge used 18"" cedar strip boats and I heard unconfirmed reports that they are closed. Pullens Nagagami Lake Lodge at the North end of the Lake uses 18' cedar strip boats and again unconfirmed reports say they are operating at a very low client capacity. Seanik"
1466346,adempsey,2012-07-25 21:04:00,963,"Ya, I looked at their website and saw that they were using the Lunds. From a distance I thought they were cedar boats, but I guess not =)I am surprised the lodges aren't busier than they are since the walleye fishing is pretty darn good."
1466398,Redear,2012-07-26 06:06:00,40,"Jerry sounds like you had a good time at Kv this year.How were the meals?We fished those islands on friday and did well but wind was blowing perty good.Only two boats out from Kv on friday,did they have many in camp your week?Timber Ridge was open the girls that work there came to visit one night at Expeditions only a few in there camp for the week.Expeditions was full all week and had great service new dock boys in camp and had boats full of gas an our minnows in boats buy 5:30 every morning.Even when we night fished late 2 nights and were at the dock every time we came in to help un load the boats.The boys went over to Kv to check them out said rooms looked nice couldn't give a price for meal plan ,also said no night fishing?is that true.I liked the solid wood dock for an old guy LOL Fred"
1466550,Seanik,2012-07-26 11:08:00,218,"Hi Fred, The meals at Kay Vee were outstanding, Dinner was a 4 course meal, salad, home made soup, a great entree and a home made desert. Our meal plan was breskfeast and dinner only and the cost for everything was 1290.00 + tax. There is a sign on KayVees dock that states boats must be back by dark but if you tell the dock attendants that you want to be out later, you can fish as late as you want too. That sign is a saftry feature, if a boat isn't back by dark and no arrangements made to stay out later, Kay Vee will go out and search for you. Kay Vee was full the week of July 14-21. While we were at Expeditions North last year service at the dock was non-existance, we were on our own most of the week. I am glad that this service has improved this year, Expeditions is a good lodge and with the addition of color depth finders they will be even better. However Kay Vee Lodge exhibited superior service and food and got my 2013 deposit. Seanik"
1467445,Redear,2012-07-28 15:03:00,40,Hey SeanikWe found several places this yr that didn't match the depths on our maps.Also a few humps and islands down from the medows end of the lake.Did you bring the new depthfinder with the navieonics chip and how did it compair with the maps from the lodges.We find out more about the lake every yr that helps us catch fish think of getting a chip for my lorance hd5 next yr.Oh did kv have a mid week camp fish fry?Fred
1467448,adempsey,2012-07-28 15:18:00,963,"I had the Garmin map for my GPS and the contour lines were WAY off. Heck, even the island wasn't where it was supposed it be. So, the map was OK for general navigation, but terrible for identifying good spots for fishing. One of the best fishing spots you would never have found just by looking at the map. The map used by Expeditions North was based on the old government map as well, so it wasn't much better and had many of the same errors."
1467611,buckeyedan,2012-07-29 08:50:00,44,"Glad to hear that everyone did well at Nagagami this year. I fly in 11 months from today...but who's counting? LOLI'm also glad to hear that Kay Vee was full the week of July 14-21. My cousin was there two weeks prior, and he said that there was only one cabin of people flying in for the following week. The Walton's run a good outfit, and it would be a shame if they can't keep their numbers up. My cousin said the same as you, adempsey...said there were people camped out on the sunken island straight out from Walton's pretty much all week. He wanted to fish it, but didn't want to barge in on other people fishing either. He knows the lake well enough that he knows lots of other places...and he caught plenty of fish, so no big deal."
