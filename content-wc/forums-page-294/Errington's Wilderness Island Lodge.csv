3559538,pitbull,2015-02-19 07:21:00,45,Has anyone been to Errington's Wilderness Island on Wabatongushi Lake the last couple of years and what your experience was and would you return? Thanks

The train ride in was fun, the fishing for walleye and pike was very good and the food was excellent (we had dinner only). Al and his wife are great hosts -- the staff was helpful and kept everything in good order. I foolishly left my medication at home, Al and his wife did everything they could to get me what I needed. We would go back."
