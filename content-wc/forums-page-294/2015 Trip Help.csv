3534802,Guest,2015-02-12 04:49:00,0,minnow we enjoy fishing muskie as a plus but generally fishing 75% walleyes and 25 % northerns can we realistically catch 25 walleyes/man/day fishing 10 hours are all 3 lakes fairly decent:motors on camp boats fairly new and in goodworking order? do they have smallmouths? jim wolf Chicago boys thanks for help as always
3535002,Flag Island,2015-02-12 06:14:00,32,I would also add the NW Angle. For more remoteness check out Spruce Island Camp. Frolanders. Big Narrows or Wiley's. With any of these you will have great musky. walleye fishing out your door. Wiley's has the best boats but are spendy as its quite a resort. Frolanders is quaint and rustic and needs some work but good food and beautiful setting.

3543706,Bill Krejca,2015-02-14 16:08:00,6107,A good area for almost everything. Lots of muskie water. Bill
3496866,NP4ME,2015-01-31 16:46:00,378,"I'm hoping I might get some good suggestions to help with our 2015 trip search. It looks like we are going to have to find a new place this year. Here are some of our criteria: We are musky guys, so the lake must obviously have muskies in it. We prefer boat-ins, but a drive to will work. We need a place that has good boats and trolling motors, and one that offers an American plan. We prefer something smaller and more remote...we are willing to sacrifice a little fishing quality for a more remote feel. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
3496922,Obabikon,2015-01-31 17:21:00,2370,"http://www.tamarackislandwildernesslodge.com/ Sounds like Todd has most of your criteria. Quite remote, some of the best musky fishing in the world is 2 minutes from his dock, he does mostly house keeping, but has American Plan too. I know he has at least one boat with bow mount, maybe two. I would say that we would work, but we only have rear mount trolling motors. Another option would be Witch Bay Camp. I hear they have very nice deluxe boats.http://www.witchbay.com/pages/camp-b...mp-docking.php"
3496986,mt hook,2015-01-31 17:43:00,65,Best boats on lake of the woods has to be duck bay lodge. If you are thinkingof going this spring you better book NOW. I wood and have driven 20 milesacross the lake to eat at that comp. PM me if you need more info.
3497258,NARDA 1,2015-01-31 21:11:00,636,Check out Birch Dale Lodge on Eagle Lake. www.birchdalelodge.com 807-227-5262. Great musky fishing with upgrade boats with bow mount trolling motors available. Their American plan is unique in that you order off a menu as in a restaurant instead of everyone eating the same thing.
3499706,jackmaloney,2015-02-01 19:43:00,9,"I'm starting to feel like a paid sponsor, but once again, I recommend Obabikon Bay Camp. Located in the Miles Bay area of LOTW, there is an endless supply of amazing musky spots right next to camp. They have great rental boats, and offer American Plans. Plus, it's quite remote, so you are always fishing spots that haven't already been worked over. That's always a big concern for me when musky fishing. You always want a chance at that active musky ready to pounce on the first bait it sees."
3500130,muskyman73,2015-02-01 23:56:00,402,"I too agree, Obabikon bay camp. About as remote as you can get on LOTW and endless patterns too. Whether it be bays, points, reefs, weedbeds - that area around the camp has it all. We get most of our muskies within 30 seconds of the camp."
3500650,Stu,2015-02-02 07:42:00,472,"Check out Thaddeus Lake Lodge http://www.thaddeuslakelodge.com/ It is about an hour north of Dryden and is the only lodge on the lake. It connects to 2 other lakes (Moose and Ord) by a large culvert and there are only a few private cabins on those lakes. Thaddeus has a really nice musky population, but I was there too early to fish for them."
3500882,camp chef,2015-02-02 08:41:00,915,Check out Pipestone Lodge on Pipestone lake. It has what you are looking for.
3502562,tolsen,2015-02-02 17:24:00,126,Been going up to this area for 30+ years and always catch trophy fish every year. John Is the owner and a retired F-16 Pilot from the Nebraska-Iowa area. Get place!http://www.roughrocklodge.com
3503266,GNO,2015-02-02 21:11:00,153,"I can say that Pipestone Lake is a great option and has a very remote feel as the lake is only accessible by a mechanical rail portage(no road access). I would recommend staying at Cedar Island Lodge, nicest cabins on the lake and great 18' rental boats with 50 Hp motors."
