3534538,Gold Arrow,2015-02-11 21:07:00,3,"Thank you so much for giving a good review from your trip back in 2007. Don & Sharon were awesome hosts who ran Gold Arrow for 36 years prior to selling it to my Wife & I in 2009. One item to note is that our guests do not return their gear every night, only on Friday evening when they turn their gear back in after the weeks fishing is complete. Since purchasing Gold Arrow in 2009 we have purchased a backhoe and road grader so keeping the roads accessible for our guests is a top priority. This means many days spent in the bush keeping the roads brushed back, keeping culverts flowing freely so that the roads remain passable. In fact since our purchase in 2009 there has only been one week when two of our 28 lakes were inaccessible. This was due to a large 6' culvert that caved in during a severe downpour. Thankfully it was promptly repaired. Next time you are in the area stop by for a cup of coffee."
3534562,Gold Arrow,2015-02-11 21:15:00,3,"Jay, Angie & I can't thank you enough for all of your kind comments. Guys like you make life at Gold Arrow one of the bests camps around, it is due to all of you adventure seeking guests. A sense of adventure whether big or small is what all of you bring with you. Whether you stay on our home lake every day of your stay or head out to a different lake every day the level of adventure is up to you. The only correction that I would make to your post is that you are 74 years young, not old! See you this spring."
3534586,Gold Arrow,2015-02-11 21:22:00,3,Just to let you know every cabin we have has a very nice three piece bath. The central showers are a product of the 1970's! If you get a chance you can check out interior bathroom photos on our website at fishandhuntontario.com

3539634,bigwillies,2015-02-13 09:48:00,515,no not guy.muy guess his handle would be crazy frenchman.lol.haven't been to cedar yet.waiting to get a little warmer too.
3485786,JayM5209,2015-01-27 19:52:00,1050,"The creek from Jackfish to Perrault has never been navigable in the years I've been there. Many years ago there were remnants of an old rail/tram portage along that creek. I read somewhere that it was part of an early freight route to Ear Falls and then Red Lake. Two years ago that creek was designated a fish sanctuary with no fishing until June 15. That explains why years ago we could drift into the creek mouth after dark, toss floating Rapalas into 12""-18"" of water and catch walleyes until we were too tired to cast.In camp boats, you can get from Jackfish up Pickerel Creek to Pickerel Lake, a decent walleye, smallie, and jumbo perch lake. In the early years of trips to Gold Arrow we'd leave Jackfish in camp boats, motor up stream to Pickerel and cross the length of the lake, then up another creek to Caribou Lake for 'eyes. Total time from camp to Caribou was about an hour and a half! Fish until after the sun has set then do the return trip in the dark. Oh, to be young and foolish . . . . but lots of memories were made. After our 2nd trip to Gold Arrow, Don and Sharon decided they were no longer going to sit up until our group got back to camp."
3485826,Glenman12,2015-01-27 20:05:00,762,"the year we went there looked to be about 6"" of water above the rocks at the mouth of the creek...since we had two camp boats and two 17ft Lunds nobody wanted to try it...maybe next year.."
3485962,Carnhzkr,2015-01-27 21:00:00,964,"Very nice write up, Jay. I've passed by the unmistakable gold arrow along 105 many times but never knew anything about the camp. I'm still young enough to appreciate an adventure."
3491618,greg2648,2015-01-29 15:24:00,80,"Fished out of Gold Arrow in 1978. We did very little fishing at Jackfish. Made the creek portage everyday to Pickerel and/or Caribou lakes. Caught hundreds of walleye at Caribou. Less numbers but bigger walleye in Pickerel. I remember having to break down beaver dams every morning. Six of us were in the water everyday. Great fishing, a lot of work. Now that we are older, we just go to lac Seul. Catch all of the walleyes that we want. lol."
3491858,JayM5209,2015-01-29 17:02:00,1050,"Greg, then you remember the central shower house/bathrooms and the wood fired boiler that produced hot water! Here's a picture from 1979 (outside that central shower house)."
3492666,bigwillies,2015-01-29 22:31:00,515,yikes! don't know what to bash u about first.the hats or the moustaches.dang!
3492674,bigwillies,2015-01-29 22:36:00,515,"soory.missed the part where u said ""central shower house"".now i'm getting the heebeejeebees."
3493354,bcmss396,2015-01-30 07:58:00,296,"Thanks for all the feedback guys. I think I'm going to keep looking. Pretty happy on Lac Des Mille Lacs, so I'l probably lobby for that option with the group. Blair"
3493434,v-bay gord,2015-01-30 08:09:00,3168,"Jay, that photo is proof that the border was much less secure back in 1979!"
3496946,JayM5209,2015-01-31 17:32:00,1050,"True, they didn't even ask if we had any potatoes in the vehicle.Every time my daughter sees that picture she starts to hum the soundtrack from Deliverance."
3483530,bcmss396,2015-01-27 07:25:00,296,"Has anybody stayed with/at the Gold Arrow Camp in Perrault Falls? I have some friends that are really talking this place up, but I'm kind of attached to having my own boat for fishing, rather than a small lake 14' 9 hp adventure. I have lots of gear and have become pretty attached to the lakes I fish. I'm not sure that I want to learn a new lake(s), especially with limited equipment. Any input/feedback is appreciated. Blair"
3483938,kriplur,2015-01-27 09:28:00,37,"my brother and I stayed with don & Sharon in 2007, really nice people, they have since sold and retired after many years in business. The cabins are nice and they seemed to make improvements every year. What you or group do is get the motor, gas can, safety gear from the resort each morning and drive to the lake that you signed up for that day. Haul all that gear, along with your fishing tackle etc. down a path to the lake where you have to unchain a boat and get prepared for the fishing experience, after the day is done you return and check in all the equipment you received in the morning, this is what you do every day. Imo it is a young mans game, sure you get to fish different lakes, mostly very small, but it is a lot of work. The year we were there it was early June and really wet, could not get to some of the lakes because of the road conditions. If you want an adventure fishing different lakes and are prepared to work at getting there, than this is a good resort with good value to go to. pm me for more info if you would like."
3483954,SinOrSwim,2015-01-27 09:32:00,1528,Good lord. Couldn't they figure out a way to lock the motor to the boat? You have to haul your gear AND a motor??? lol wow. That is definitely a young mans game.
3484106,BornToFish,2015-01-27 10:06:00,1224,"A good friend that I now fish with at another area lodge used to fish at Gold Arrow. He echoed everything in the previous post. He told me that virtually nobody fishes the lake that the lodge is on. All the fishing action is on remote lakes. Each of these lakes has two boats from Gold Arrow. Guests sign up each day for an area lake. I think that he enjoyed the fishing out of Gold Arrow, but is now old (and wise?) enough to not want to carry motors and other gear from his vehicle to the boats each morning and then do it again in the evening. He also mentioned that he quickly learned not to boast about the fishing when back at camp. He said that others would then sign up for the lake that he was boasting about, such that he could not return to the lake he fished and did well on the day before. It sounds to me like a nice lodge, but maybe better suited for younger guys willing to hump boating and fishing gear twice each day. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3484866,JayM5209,2015-01-27 14:37:00,1050,"bcmss396, I am a long time guest at Gold Arrow Camp. In 1979 four of us made our 1st trip there and two of us from that group have been back every year since. For the last 30+ years a group six have been there the week of Memorial Day every year. The young kid in the group is in his late 40s, two are mid-50ish, two are 65, and I'm the old guy at 74. I said last year was my final trip, but now I'm signed up for the annual trip this year. The rest of the group will not consider going anywhere else. Since retiring eight years ago, in addition to this early season group trip, I do two or three more trips each year, always a solo trip and usually one with my school teacher son who can't do the early season trip. Gold Arrow has been a great adventure over the years, but at my age I'm ready for a place where I can leave my gear in the boat at the end of the day and just walk from the dock to the cabin!Gold Arrow is a great camp and great experience . . . IF that's the kind of experience you're looking for. You have 15 or more lakes to choose from. Plenty of walleye, small mouth, pike, jumbo perch, and lake trout options to explore. Most are smaller lakes, and most days you can fish without seeing another boat. It is not a 50 walleye/day/person kind of experience, but there's variety and plenty of fish for my group. Two of us, some years three, take our own boats (16 footers) and can drop them into Cliff, Aerobus, Ord, Perrault, Cedar, or Wabashkang Lakes. The camp uses 9.9 hp motors, but our group takes our own 6 and 8 horse motors along to use on the camp boats. They're lighter to wrangle and they're all you need.Incidentally, Jackfish Lake, Gold Arrow's home lake, is small but it can be counted on for walleyes and lots of jumbo perch. Smallies and northern are common. In fact, one of our group spends at least four days each year right there while the rest of us go to other lakes.The camp facilities and equipment are excellent. Cabins are clean, comfortable, and well equipped. Boats are clean and dry. Motors are kept in like new condition. Don and Sharon Moore, now retired former owners, have a well deserved reputation for their hospitality. The new owners, Angie and Todd Heath, are maintaining the helpful, welcoming hospitality and have continued the meticulous maintenance and regular improvements/upgrades to the camp and the equipment. Again, it depends on the kind of experience you are looking for. Gold Arrow has been a great experience for my group and me for many, many years. I've starting using several other camps in my retirement only because I'm getting old! I have no regrets and only pleasant memories of all the weeks spent at Gold Arrow.Sorry I got so windy. Feel free to pose any further specific questions, either here or in a PM. Happy fishing wherever you go."
3485226,billy weaver,2015-01-27 17:45:00,470,I fish Wabaskang Lake just up the road from Gold Arrow. I take my own boat a deep V with a 60 HP four stroke tiller. I like walking down to the dock every morning with my coffee cup in hand and going fishing. I leave my gear in the boat and cover it with trash bags if needed. The lake is 17 miles long and has many bays and fingers so you can fish a different place every day if you like. I stay a Peffley's Camp at the north end but there is several very good drive to camps on Wabaskang. Lugging a motor down to the water along with my gear is a little to much for us older guys but could be fun for the young guys. I know guys who fish Cedar and Perrault and take their own boats to drive to camps and like them. Don't under-estimate the value of your own boat.
3485434,bigwillies,2015-01-27 18:43:00,515,have had a camp on cedar for over 20 yrs.always knew gold arrow was on jackfish but didn't know u couldn't access perrault.i'm assuming with the little boats and different lakes u guys r talkin.
3485682,Glenman12,2015-01-27 19:25:00,762,Im guessing you own Keystone as Im pretty sure the other camps havent been owned that long...as for Jackfish we found the same thing but in reverse order..33 yr vet of Cedar Lake Lodge and two years ago we were going to go to Jackfish..what a shock when when finally got to a narrow creek that none of the boats could navigate...
3485730,bigwillies,2015-01-27 19:31:00,515,"ha! no. sorry when i say camp i mean private ""cabin'.kinda used to sayin camp.what the locals use."
3485738,Glenman12,2015-01-27 19:37:00,762,"ah, ok..sorry.."
