3555930,Seanik,2015-02-18 07:41:00,218,"Hi Pawalleye32, Our group of 3 flew to Lac Vimont early August of 2013 with Air Melacon. The lake is on the small side about 2 1/2 miles long with many productive bays. The walleyes were typically 14-16's with a few 20+"" , they were plentiful and easy to catch. The few pike we caught were in the 25-30"" range but we did not target them. The cabin has 2 bedrooms, a shower with plenty of hot water and inside toilet. A large solar panel provides the cabin lighting, if you take a small inverter you can recharge your depth finder and cell phone or camera batteries. There is a caretaker at one end of the lake who has radio contact with the air base and he brings fresh drinking water each day by 4 wheeler. Air Melacons fly in rates are about a 1000.00+ but they provide a very reliable service. The roads are paved all the way and a good motel is near the air base if you stay overnight before the fly in. If you book with them they are very helpful in making the necessary motel arrangements. email me if you need more information Seanik"

Have nothing but praise and compliments for them. They do what they say they will, when and where they say."
