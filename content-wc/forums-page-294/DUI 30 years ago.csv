3533594,ftfarms,2015-02-11 16:19:00,444,Ive read all the post and it's all confusing at best. I'm thinking of asking a friend to go this year and he got a DUI in 1985 is this going to be a problem getting in Canada? Any help would be great. Thanks and god bless.
3533722,Fishoil,2015-02-11 16:50:00,1277,It won't be a problem. My wife had one about 30 years ago and she's been across the border with me many times at several different crossings and they have never even mentioned it.
3533794,v-bay gord,2015-02-11 17:08:00,3168,"So how far down the road do you drive before you let her out of the trunk? All kidding aside, if it is just one thing on his record, and it's over ten years old it will not be a problem. When in doubt contact the border folk and ask the question."
3535034,BornToFish,2015-02-12 06:21:00,1224,"V-Bay Gord said it well. I quote something below that I recently wrote. Ontario sees DUI/DWI much differently than in the US.There are many stories floating around the internet, often laced with myth and misinformation, about people's experiences crossing the border. Individuals with concerns about their criminal background and wanting to travel to Canada have two options to better understand their prospects for being allowed to enter into Canada. One option is to contact the Canada Border Services Agency (http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html, click the Travellers tab)) at the likely point of entry into Canada (e.g. Fort Frances, Ontario, 807-274-3655, ask for Immigration). Their other option is to contact the Canadian Consulate in Minneapolis, MN (612-332-7486). Discussions with these resources should establish the facts for the individual's unique circumstance (e.g. the number of issues, the nature of such issues and how long ago they occurred) and what options might exist to support travel into Canada. In certain situations, Canada has remedies available to individuals with a criminal background which may result in the individual being allowed to travel into Canada. As you might expect, these remedies require time (up to one year or more) and money, and have no guarantee of a favorable outcome. I understand that the final decision often rests with the Border Services agent at the border crossing."

3551826,Emmett014,2015-02-17 04:51:00,1,Yeah though you can check on border police's portal but still I would recommend you to take some legal help too just to be double sure. My friend know couple of good DUI lawyer who handle such type of cases. Let me know if you still need any help!
