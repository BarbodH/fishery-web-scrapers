If you are bringing kids they have a pool you can use. You can fish all of the east harbor and it will always be calm enough for your boat. A ton of large mouth, blue gill and crappie in there. Tons to do right around this area when you aren't on the lake. It truly is paridse on nice summer days. If you have further questions pm me, I have a house and boat in channel grove which on east harbor."
3543802,fsz,2015-02-14 16:46:00,144,I live 5 minutes from the Lake. The info on east harbor is good IF all you want to go for is gills and largemouth. Crappie are pretty much gone by June. If you are looking for walleye (I did it from a 14' for years) there is good fishing fairly close to shore off Turtle Creek near the town of Oak Harbor (west of port clinton) There are tons ofcheap motels and campgrounds. Good fishing close to shore can be had from Huron to Vermillion as well. Less campgrounds and cheap motels in that area. By close to shore I mean within a mile or two. Fishing is hot and cold because the fish move so much. Cranberry Creek Marina is a good source of info. Good luck
