3527018,v-bay gord,2015-02-10 07:23:00,3168,Canadian Tire has a pretty good tackle section. Taking a drive to Vermilion Bay and checking out Bobby's is still your best bet. Bring your wallet....
3528802,bigwillies,2015-02-10 14:21:00,515,Bobby's does have a great selection(especially if you r into muskie).kinda miss the grumpy old fella that used to be there. definitly entertaining(even when i got berated).

3518850,Babamel2,2015-02-07 15:12:00,414,"We have often shopped at Extra Foods, on the East edge of Dryden. I think Beer must be purchased at the government run Beer Store, sorry I don't have the address"
3518866,WalleyeMatt,2015-02-07 15:22:00,93,"Safeway, Booze and Beer store is around the corner. Matt"

3520058,Guest,2015-02-08 05:34:00,0,There is even a goodsized Walmart on the east side of town!!!!!!!!!!!
3520386,Limeyangler,2015-02-08 07:50:00,563,"K&A tackle is the best for bait, its on Government St. next to 7/11."
3520418,rzep,2015-02-08 07:58:00,1196,"Is paper mill still functional in Dryden ??? If so, I would advise not to stay down the wind from it .."
3523034,bigwillies,2015-02-08 23:54:00,515,would agree they r the best for bait. but thats it.can't get a license.no tackle.p%#s poor for a bait shop
3523234,SinOrSwim,2015-02-09 06:06:00,1528,Just a heads up. You may want to check the hours of operation of the BEER store. I know we have run into issues in the past. They have very limited hours of operation. IN addition when I went up last year it was like the first Monday of the month or something and was a holiday so all the gov't places were closed.
3523250,Skywagon,2015-02-09 06:12:00,1106,"The town could use a good sporting goods/bait shop (especially since Tony's closed), not sure with the short summer season one could make a go of it though."
