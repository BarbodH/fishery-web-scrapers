3535778,retire55,2015-02-12 09:23:00,1029,X2. Lots of outfitters with their own planes charge less than $1 per pound for all overage. At those prices most of us can afford to take whatever we think we need for a great trip.
3535994,adempsey,2015-02-12 10:36:00,963,"Or no extra charge at all, and like you said, the overage charge is $1 a pound at most. So, if it came down to it, an extra $20 to take a sonar is worth it. Although, some people stuff the 12V batteries in their pockets, lol!"
3536090,michigan walleye guy,2015-02-12 10:51:00,95,"We arrange to have our beer and pop flown in ahead of time. The cost is a little steep, at $54 a case for Blue, and $27 a case for Coke, but it's well worth it to me to not worry about that 120 pounds when weighing in the morning of the fly in. Dave and Michelle at Nestor Falls Outposts are usually almost always able to get extra gear flown in, too, at an added cost. But I've found that getting the beer and pop flown in ahead of time makes it pretty easy to meet the weight requirements of 100 pounds per person. That's pretty generous. For a depth finder, I just bring an old-school Boundary Waters Vexilar, it runs on 8 AA batteries and lasts most of the week. With the relatively small size of the fly in lakes, and the intel we get from both the outfitter and the crew we are replacing, it would be easy to go without. Usually the maps are well marked, and it's pretty easy to get on fish within minutes of leaving the dock."
3536938,Ebarnett,2015-02-12 15:39:00,60,We use the AA battery portable ones:http://www.cabelas.com/product/Boati...3Bcat104588280They work well as depth finders. They do mark fish but obviously not as well as expensive models. They attach to the boat very easily and overall work pretty good....no GPS.
3540594,octanehi5,2015-02-13 14:32:00,1104,"One thing about canada you do not need a $400+gps -fishfinder. I use an old e-trax gps go to marked spots then mark them with portable floats, As for depth -fishfinders, I made my own portable with an old 160 cuda and a 300 cuda, with suction cup transducers or gunel mount small tackel box attach screen to the top keep the small 5lb acid 12 volt in the box never run out of power. Most outfitters pump their water with battery op pumps, 12VDC that stay charged with solar panels, this unit weighs less than 8 lbs once you locate the fish you can shut them off.I've been doing this for more than 20 yrs of fly ins. A 24 pack of canned beer weighs 18 lbs. In 20 yrs of fly ins we made weight once, better to bring what you want and pay the freight to fly it in"
3533866,milford72,2015-02-11 17:25:00,13,"whats everyone using for locaters on their remote trips? There is no way to charge batteries & gps drains them quickly. With weight limits--whats a guy supposed to pack--batteries,beer or just fishing gear? Suggestions please. Thanks."
3534026,h8go4s,2015-02-11 18:06:00,1673,"It's been at least 10 years since I did a fly-in trip, but even then, we charged batteries off the solar panels at the cabin. And you actually can fish without a sonar if you have to."
3534042,Pooch,2015-02-11 18:11:00,4619,"Beer and soft drinks are a killer on fly ins. I'd rather have fishing stuff.Lots of information on this subject here, just search this forum. Lots of good ideas.Pooch"
3534234,bthomas3333,2015-02-11 19:22:00,465,For our fly-in trips we have created an aluminum mounting bracket which clamps to the gunwale. Then there is an arm which slides the transducer down into the water. We run the HB596c DI (no GPS) about 4 hours a day for 6 days with no problem on one charge on a mini12v deep cycle. We do bring an extra mini 12v in case the battery runs down. In general we use the finder when looking for fish or underwater structure. We don't use it for crossing open water or when we are on the fish. The link to the battery we use (34 bucks cabbalas) is below.http://www.cabelas.com/product/Cabel...ery/700551.utsB-

3534258,adempsey,2015-02-11 19:30:00,963,"For a power hog GPS/Sonar combo you need to have either electric start motors or solar power at the camp with an inverter to charge from the solar panel batteries. You could use a portable solar panel, but it all depends on what you get and the decent ones aren't cheap. I'd imagine most people opt to bring a lower model that runs off of AA or D-cell batteries. Any unit can be made to operate off of batteries very easily, but if you sonar is drawing 600 to 1000 mA it's not really a viable option.If you're going to an outpost that doesn't need to charter it's flights, I wouldn't worry about the extra weight of a sonar/batteries too much."
3534554,packpro,2015-02-11 21:12:00,695,"My Canada Sonar and GPS are 15/17 years old. Both are black and white. Those units use very little juice during the day. My GPS (Garmin)76) runs on 4 double A batteries. I have to replace them once during the week. I only run it when the boat is under power. It lays down a track to get me back to the camp or to a good fishing spot. Small, light weight, and does the job. Came with a good base map, and zoom. Not sure what is comparable today, but this is a good unit for a fly in. My sonar is a Garmin 240. That unit has great bottom detail and water temperature for a 17 year old unit. Unfortunately, the portable 12V battery is heavy and needs recharged everyday. Probably not the set up you are looking for. Some guys in our group use a AA operated locator. I think it is called a Piranha. The run them all day and only have one battery change all week. I have looked at there screens side by side with mine. Not much difference. I switched from the aluminum portable bracket to a suction cup. Easier to pack. I never though it would hold. After 5 years it has never come off, and in fact, it holds so tight I cannot pull it off. Usually just slide it off the bottom. You will have some issues on painted boats with the suction cup."
3535242,SinOrSwim,2015-02-12 07:11:00,1528,"Or, take what you want and understand you might pay some overage charges. Personally, I'd rather bump up my price a little and enjoy everything on my trip. Beer, drinks and sonar.We used the solar battery bank to recharge on our trips. Use an inverter. Worked perfectly. Also, there are outfitters who will work with you on extra weight. For example, our outfitter always flew in overage stuff on a later flight or check flight. We took a lot of beer so we would take in some on our fligh in and they would bring the rest on a later flight that day they had room on or on a check flight a couple days later.I have a humminbird/GPS combo. I had two batteries. One was att he cabin charging during the day/full sun and the other was in the boat with me. I also had a flexible solar panel that attached to my system so it supplemented the charging while we were fishing. It was the weight of one of those flexible cutting boards. Light."
3535362,MrSimon,2015-02-12 07:44:00,922,"I bought a low end basic 12V Humminbird fish finder (no GPS) .... cut off the end of the power cord ..... and soldered on a cheap little plastic battery holder that fits 8 AAs. It lasts all week on one set of batteries. You could do the exact same thing with a GPS enabled fish finder, it would just eat through batteries a lot faster. 16 AA batteries weighs roughly the same as one can of beer/soda (according to Google). Even if you had to change the batteries every day .... the trade off is only 3 cans of beer. That's not too bad."
3535642,bthomas3333,2015-02-12 08:44:00,465,Or like I mentioned cut the ends and use a small deep cycle marine battery and get even more hours. Most Finders will operate down to about 9-10v.B-
