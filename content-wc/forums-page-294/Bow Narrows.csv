I have never been to Bow Narrows, their web site is quite nice and I talked to the owner, he was very helpful on the phone. If anyone has information on this resort I sure would appreciate the info. It is a long time until August, time to start dreaming and planning!"

Plus they have a chocolate lab to greet you at the dock - what could be better? Be sure to provide a trip report when you return. August will be here before you know it.

We wound up fishing right against sheets of ice. We saw 3 40inch Northerns caught but over all the fishing was TOUGH. None of that maters much to an Aug tripThe owners are very nice people. I really appreciated their hospitality. They saved my trip. The food was good. The cabins were good. The boats and motors were fantastic. The Chocolate lab was awesome :-)Like I said I can't really speak to the fishing. Most of the water was running 42 degrees. When we found 46 we found a few pike. I would say you have a lot of water to work. A depth finder was helpful.Enjoy!B-
