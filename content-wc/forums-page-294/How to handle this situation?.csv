3537186,Skywagon,2015-02-12 17:12:00,1106,"The scary part about this whole thread is that we all are getting there. My guess is that the average Walleye Central guy is probably 60. I told my contractor when we built the new house on the lake, that when/if the time came, I expected him to build a ramp to the lake from the house and wheel me to the boat. I expect many of you feel the same way about your trip to Canada every year. Let us hope that we have friends that care about us as much as many of you do about your fishing partners."
3537394,octanehi5,2015-02-12 18:04:00,1104,"The beauty of any trip is in the eye of the beholder. If it makes him happy to just be there,then so be it. We are not here for a long time,Just for a good time.Its about the quality of life. Put yourself in his shoes then treat him like you would want to be treated"
3538130,Baxman1958,2015-02-12 21:51:00,14,"My Dad was about 80 or so , the last time we went to Canada. He had recently been diagnosed with Polymyalgia. He hurt everywhere. He had taken my brothers (6) and I to Canada for 40 years. 40+ trips. Before he was diagnosed, he told us - no way - could he go. He was in too much pain. 2 days before we left, he started some meds that made him feel better. Prednisone surely is a miracle drug, and I can attest to that. ""I'm in!""! He spent most of the week in the cabin, reading books, sleeping by the fire box, and keeping things clean. We didn't pressure him to fish, and let him decide if and when he wanted to get in a boat. I carried him over my shoulder (fireman carry) anywhere he needed to go. Needless to say - he had a pretty good week. His spirit was great, and that made OUR week one for the books. The bottom line, as stated above and in many other posts, is that the fishing is secondary. When you go to Ontario, you're ALWAYS going to catch enough fish to eat, and maybe take home. My brothers and I, as a group, have never been back to Canada since our Dad died. It just wouldn't be the same. Now, we go to Kabetogama, and the fishing has been great. Life is about changes. While fishing is the main goal, we have as much fun or more just being together, and hanging out together. We have all been chefs at one time or another, and we love the camaraderie and the opportunity to display our skills. Bottom line - Tell your guy - (as stated earlier) that is not important that he's there for the fishing - it's more important that he is there for the camaraderie, and your group would miss him, if he weren't there. If he still hems and haws, then he has given up. DON'T PUSH IT!! Baxman1958"

Hope things go well for all involved with these decisions that all groups and each of us will eventually have to make.I hope when it comes to my last trip that I don't know it's my last trip. That's the way it was for my good friend a couple years ago. When we broke camp, shook hands and headed back home in opposite directions little did we know that it was the last time we would see each other.Best wishes to all. Good thread for all of us to be following.Pooch"
3539874,wmd,2015-02-13 10:35:00,388,"We had a regular in our group that was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor in his early 40's. We had stopped going for a couple of years and decided to make one last trip with him, he wasn't in grate shape and could do very little but he hung in there and enjoyed the trip. He died a couple of years later at about 48 or so, the first and so far only one in our original group that has passed on. He and the rest of us were very glad we made that last trip together. Pooch is right, a friend is a friend, if he wants to go make it work. wmd"
3544818,forgop,2015-02-15 00:22:00,880,"The guy who turned me on to the idea of fly-in trips started after he returned home from Vietnam. His brother invited him and said he had no interest, but was told the group would pay his way and provide all the beer he could drink. He's gone for over 45 years since.I don't know the details, but one of the group regulars died several years ago. The following year, they spread his ashes over his favorite island on the lake. Every year, they go back and drink a beer there in his honor. When all is said and done, the fishing is just secondary to the memories developed and strengthening of friendships."
3544866,Guest,2015-02-15 04:15:00,0,fishermen great stories I would think the person that passed on would want his friends to continue going and enjoy the great outdoors again like they he used to when he was on this earth I know I would:we are a group of guys in our early 70's ( fairly good shape ) I have been going for over 40 years with a good friend I graduated grammar school in 1956 good friends are to find especially ones who enjoy the outdoors plan on doing for hopefully another 15 years planning on 3 trips this year jim wolf Chicago boys lets just keep going until we can't
3546658,John N,2015-02-15 15:02:00,362,"Steve, I don't know how you improve much on this thinking and approach. Picking up the slack and helping a friend/family is a joy, not a load, and you've told him that. That's part of the camaraderie and friendship that makes these trips so special. You let him know how everybody feels, you guys will get to the right decision, whatever that is. John"
3551082,Baxman1958,2015-02-16 19:22:00,14,"John, that is a great response!"
3535546,Seanik,2015-02-12 08:30:00,218,"This statement is a slam to all senior citizens, check the ages of most jail inmates ( 18-24 ) who aren't capable of making the right life choices. When you become a senior maybe it will become personal. Seanik 75 yrs and deemed very capable and yes personal"
3535682,tooski,2015-02-12 08:49:00,393,Read it again Seanik. I am defending seniors right and ability to make choices. The personal quote was meant for the OP..And I am 70....
3535826,Mike Borger,2015-02-12 09:36:00,1554,That's exactly what I was thinking - make sure he knows that.
3535914,LOW1,2015-02-12 10:02:00,2828,"I don't see it as in interference with The Old Fisherman's right to make choices. I see it as a need to make sure that The Old Fisherman is making the choice to stay home for the right reason. For example, maybe The Old Fisherman does feel that he is too frail or maybe he just wants to stay home and do something else or maybe he has any one of a number of other ""good"" reasons why he doesn't want to go. On the other hand, maybe The Old Fisherman is exhibiting the same trait that so many of his generation exhibits and feels that he should not go because he would be a burden on the group and is willing to sacrifice his pleasure for what he sees as being the greater good of the group. And rather than risking any hardship or variation in routine by the group. The Old Fisherman avoids the issue by staying home. The OP is in a tough spot. He and the group appear willing and happy to make any accomadation that The Old Fisherman may need. At the same time the OP does not want to deny The Old Fisherman the right to make his own decision. And we have no way of knowing-nor does the OP-what the true motivations are of the Old Fisherman. So, what to do? Have an honest discussion with The Old Fisherman. It may have to be more of a touchy-feely conversation than the OP likes to have. But tell The Old Fisherman (who no doubt already knows this but may nevertheless be waiting to be told it) that going fishing really doesn't have much to do with fishing but that it is about memories, bonding, and experience and that he is welcome to go regardless of fishing. And to some extent suggest to him (without making him feel guilty) that the group needs him and will benefit from him because of his memory, experiences, etc. See what his reaction is - perhaps it will surprise you."
3535946,tooski,2015-02-12 10:13:00,393,"Nonsense- sit him down and have a touchy feely conversation???? Yeah, treat him likes he's a 5 year old. That will work. The OP said he tried to talk him into it and he said no. He doesn't want to go for whatever reason. His choice. You really think he wants to go and be coddled the whole week? Really? I think it is selfish to badger him into going because ""you"" would feel better if he was there. Pretty sure if he was a farmer his entire life he is content in his own decisions...."
3536554,JOE WALLEYE,2015-02-12 13:50:00,753,I would say make sure he knows that him being there is part of what makes the trip fun for you. So he knows without a doubt that you don't feel burdened by him.
3536658,Mike Kansas,2015-02-12 14:30:00,1463,We have a group that goes on fly ins every couple years. One year the oldest guy said he thought he should not go. After some conversations with him his decision was based on the fact that his wife was concerned with him being to far away from medical treatment with the fly in. We instead went to a drive in camp and she was happy and he was elated. After all it's about who you are with that makes each trip to Canada special. Mike Kansas
3536706,fosterthedog,2015-02-12 14:46:00,51,"Thanks for all the input everyone! Want you guys to know I'm not trying to persuade him to go, my thoughts to him about it not getting any easier in the coming years are true and not meant as pressure . That being said I can see how he might feel pressured and will let him know that, he just seems to be on the fence. The last we spoke he brought up that he will need ice for his protein smoothies, his only nourishment . I replied that we could fill up a cooler for the ride in and have more flown in in a few days, we take generator any way so the blender is no big deal. I just feel he is coming up with more reasons not to go than make the trip, a way to back out and save face. He loves to read and think he would enjoy sitting on the porch read and have a beer(his other form of nourishment) when he doesn't feel like going out. I remember our first trip North I was 12 and would work on the farm during summer vacation, between 1st and 2nd cuttings he told me we're going to the farm show at Cornell one night during dinner get up early and do my chores. Got back from from feeding beefers the truck is loaded with a boat in the bed. My Aunt had packed my bag and off we went 20hrs later we arrived in Chibougamau Quebec and had the greatest 5 days of my life at that age. He did everything set up camp, cut deadfall for firewood, cooked, put us on fish, everything! I feel like I should try to do the same at this stage in his life. I do feel a lot of you guys are right that we need to sit down and talk, we're not touchy fully kind of folks, but feel I should share where I'm coming from and encourage him to do the same. Thanks again for all the advise please let me know any more thoughts you have."
3536834,MrSimon,2015-02-12 15:04:00,922,"I totally understand your sentiment .... but over the years I've actually come to believe that the Canadian fishing trip experience itself is what's special. Getting to share that with good friends is just a bonus. Hanging out with my fishing buddies for a week at the beach wouldn't even compare to a week long fly-in. Same guys, same time frame .... but not comparable in terms of ""specialness""."
3536850,jambi,2015-02-12 15:08:00,504,"I go through this every year with my father, since he decided not to go anymore in 2010. I keep it simple, ask him and he says no, and I don't push it. What he does enjoy though, is staying in the conversation about the upcoming trip that I am taking with my buddies. He really loves knowing the details leading up to the trip and then the details of the reports after the trip. Not only about ""what did you catch"" but ""what did you enjoy"". He's actually a little mad at me now because I don't have a trip planned yet for this year!!!!"
3533658,fosterthedog,2015-02-11 16:28:00,51,"We've been doing a fly in to the same lake for a number of years, one of our team has gone through chemo with throat cancer, he missed last year. He is on the fence about going this year, I'm the youngest of the group at 55, and his usual boat partner he is 80(he is my Uncle and taught me how to fish). I've tried to tell him to make the trip as it will not get any easier in the years to follow. Any Ideas on how to approach this would be appreciated. He says he will be fine for the drive up and the plane ride, but doesn't feel he has the stamina to fish all day, I told him I'll take him back to camp anytime he wants and pick him up after he takes a nap when he calls on the radio. He is a farmer and has a lot of pride and a feeling that he should be able to fend for himself. Any thoughts you guys? Thanks Steve"
3533690,tooski,2015-02-11 16:39:00,393,"Only that if he doesn't want to go, don't try and talk him into it. I don't know why (and this is not personal) older people are deemed not capable of life choices...."
3533730,TIGHTLINER,2015-02-11 16:54:00,223,I have to agree with Tooski on this.. The same thing has happened to our group this year. The guy would love to go he loves to fish and hunt however at 83 he is having some problems just what they are I have not talked with him about it. He was on with us and then off then he wanted to go again and a week later he said he did not think he should try to make the trip. When I ask him if wanted in on the fishing trips he was the first to give me a deposit. Let him decide you have laid it out for him that you will be glad to take him in anytime. With that being said don't push the answer. If he does not go he knows what is best for him. Also he might not want to ruiin your trip. My dad had throat cancer and it does take its toll on you.
3533746,fsz,2015-02-11 16:57:00,144,"I think you are right the trips get harder as you age. My great uncle skipped a year in his early 80's due to similar concerns. However, the year after that, he was rearing to go! In his final years, if he felt up to it, he came. if not, he stayed home. We always missed him if he didn't come, but the trips he did make he smiled from ear to ear all day long! I think you are taking a good approach-providing encouragement and offering to adjust to his needs. However, he might not be able to come to terms with not ""pulling his own weight"" right at this moment in time. Its also possible physically he is not feeling as well as he might let on. A year off may substantially reinvigorate his desire to go, even if he needs some modifications or special attention. Other than providing encouragement, offering to adjust to his needs, and telling him you will miss his company there's not much you can do other than to tell him you understand and to remind him he is always welcome. Good Luck"
3533754,Fishoil,2015-02-11 16:57:00,1277,"I have a similar situation with my father and I handle it much the same as you are offering to. He doesn't always fish, sometimes just sits in the boat or takes a nap. It works for us but all you can do for your uncle is make it clear that it's no problem and you will be happy to do it. The decision to go will have to be his. Good Luck and I hope he joins you. None of us knows how many more chances we'll be given to make the trip, so I believe we should take every opportunity we can."
3533898,dutchboy,2015-02-11 17:38:00,5717,Take him fishing locally a couple of times this summer. He will appreciate it and it won't be nearly as taxing on him. We all know how we feel when our wives make us go somewhere we don't want to go. It's a miserable trip and a long day.
3534034,Pooch,2015-02-11 18:07:00,4619,Let your Uncle make the call himself. Support him in any way you can. Make the trip easy for him in every way you can. All of us have our pride and NO one wants to burden the rest of the group. BUT the rest of the group wants them along regardless.Over the years everyone in our group has at one time (trip) or another been either recouping or fighting a bad back or getting over chemo. The rest of the group picked up the slack because we a friends and without anyone of us the trip would just not be the same. We will work around about anything in order to stay together as a group.That's what friends do.Pooch
3534306,forgop,2015-02-11 19:47:00,880,"Like you said, take him and let him dictate the time he wants to be on the water and when he wants to go back for a nap or whatever. There aren't many more trips to be made, so make the most of what you've got left. Just let him know it won't be a burden on the group to let him do his thing as he sees fit. Ask him how much better he'd feel at home sitting around doing nothing instead of enjoying that over a week in the bush."
3535058,bigwalleye1,2015-02-12 06:23:00,2632,"Point out to him that it's more important to you that he go than if you fish all day. We all get old, and sometimes adjustments need to be made. Tell him why it's important to you that he go."
3535418,MrSimon,2015-02-12 08:04:00,922,"This doesn't happen only with older folks. I have plenty of buddies in their 30's and 40's who are wishy-washy about going on Canada trips .... for various reasons (some good, some not). I've learned to just extend the invitation with warmth and an assurance that there are no expectations. I let them make the call and don't give them any crap one way or the other."
