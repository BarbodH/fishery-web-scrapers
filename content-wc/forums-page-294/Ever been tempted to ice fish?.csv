3547802,Mike Borger,2015-02-15 21:15:00,1554,FWIW I'm headed north in April to Yellowknife to ice fish Great Slave Lake. Should be fun.
3548010,briand,2015-02-15 23:52:00,48,The best part of winter fishing is the access to lakes that have no summer road access
3499514,prov1800,2015-02-01 18:25:00,5010,"Thats one of the dummests comments ive seen in a long time.thx i needed that.lol.lots of ice fishing going here.just not a lot of fisherman from south of border here.mostly local guys enjoying some fantastic fishing on some lakes accessible only in the winter.lac suel, cedar, cliff and eagle are all fished in the winter time.for any one that hasn't experienced ice fishing is missing out."
3499538,unclepaully,2015-02-01 18:32:00,112,Myself and a couple of buddies have gone north twice and ice fished the Chapleau game preserve. We stay at Murray Lake Cottages. Great hosts and you can't beat the price. I wish we could have made it up there this year but just couldn't pull it off. The best part is the border crossing. Last time we went we were the only car heading into Ontario. We thought for sure we would get put through the ringer. We cleared in less than a minute.
3500194,Catman59,2015-02-02 04:55:00,345,"Ive been up a few times. Hoping that it will happen again in March. We go to Sturgeon. From there , the lake selection is endless on snowmobiles. Couture , Heathcote , are a couple that come to mind. If you get a chance .... GO. The Lakers through the ice are waaay fun."
3500642,micropterus,2015-02-02 07:41:00,450,"Yes, but the madness passed under the warm Florida sun"
3500802,LOW1,2015-02-02 08:21:00,2828,"There seems to be a real different attitude on Lake of the Woods between the Minnesota resorts and the Canadian resorts. The Minnesota resorts actively market ice fishing with rental ice houses, etc and it seems to be a big part of their business. Canadian resorts, if they are even open in the winter, seem to not make it a major part of their business. I don't know why the attitude differs so much. I can't imagine myself ever driving north in the winter to go fishing."
3501354,bigwillies,2015-02-02 11:08:00,515,I think u just explained it with your last comment.its probably like asking a canadian if they wanted to go to mexico or cuba in july.plus quite a few resort owners are american and are long gone before the snow flies
3501426,SinOrSwim,2015-02-02 11:22:00,1528,"I have no interest ice fishing here in the states, much less driving to Canada to do it."
3501458,ftfarms,2015-02-02 11:31:00,444,I would love to ice fish in Ontario on lotws. Just hard to get anyone to take off this time of year.
3501690,downriverbob,2015-02-02 12:32:00,880,"My wife and I have fished LOTW out of Sioux Narrows in 2013 and 2014 with our friend Peter Horley, he and his Mom run the Sanctuary Resort, http://www.thesanctuaryresort.ca/. Their resort is closed in the winter it is on an island out from Sioux Narrows. We stated at the Tomahawk Resort in Sioux Narrows, www.tomahawkresort.com/. We fished for and caught some nice lake trout and whitefish. We fished mainly in early March the weather was cold but the sun being higher in the sky at that time of the year makes the difference. The 1st picture is Peter with nice lake trout and whitefish. The 2nd picture is my wife Linda, Peter, and myself. The 3rd picture is me while we were have some shore lunch."
3547786,tuiflies,2015-02-15 21:09:00,158,Donnelly's Minnitaki Lake Lodge near Sioux Lookout is open for ice fishing. I keep my sled there most of the winter and usually go over near Red Pine Bay. It's a quick 15 min ride in the winter (across the portage).
3498266,zeebee,2015-02-01 10:17:00,1144,Beer is colder in winter they say....ever been tempted to take a trip to Canada and try a line thru the ice?
3498330,Limeyangler,2015-02-01 10:35:00,563,You are missing out if you don't!
3498362,zeebee,2015-02-01 10:41:00,1144,Ok my tan retaining Brit....organize the 1st ever WCF ice fishy tourney. Get V-Bay to open camp. Beat the Feb Blahs.
3498546,Limeyangler,2015-02-01 11:33:00,563,Now wouldn't that be something!
3498658,zeebee,2015-02-01 12:13:00,1144,Mandatory dress code would be Burmuda shorts over HH longjohns. Trap door style recommended.
3498970,bigwillies,2015-02-01 14:41:00,515,putting trap door style may draw somewhat of a different crowd
3498986,Fishin Fun,2015-02-01 14:47:00,218,I've been told that there isn't a lot of ice fishing that happens in Canada. I stayed at lodges at Gull Rock and Lac Seul and both have said no one ice fishes on those lakes. I always thought it would be fun.
3499146,P&y only,2015-02-01 15:38:00,133,say when
