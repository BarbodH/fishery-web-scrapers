He was working for the US Govt. at the time and they got him permanent residency. Coincidentally, his third option was Canada but my mother couldn't bear the thought of the cold. Three years later we ended up in Michigan anyway."

Had too, when the state rejected a Congressional Medal of Honor Winner, who was also the best governor and senator the state EVER had, in favor of a wealthy rancher's wife,who had never done a thing and had no experience whatsoever, it was time to take my money and move OUT of the red state!!! By the way the ex-governor was of the blue variety. I'm a 64 year old Marine and the whole thing made me PUKE"

Now adays I make a trip to Port Clinton Ohio for a week walleye fishing and again fish with a great group of guys and the people are great."

3423626,Guest,2015-01-06 09:28:00,0,"My old man was a lobster fisherman up on PEI and my mom, from Bar Harbor, spent many summers up there with Gramps. Well she got knocked up one summer and Pops married her. Lasted 3 years. Anyway, Dad came to Michigan in the 60's/70's to guide Salmon fisherman and I got the bug during one of my stays. Moved in with him when I was 15. I rarely fish Salmon anymore, mostly Walleye and Perch. Less monkey business."
3423850,v-bay gord,2015-01-06 10:53:00,3168,"Wow, for a split second I thought Gramps was going to jail.... How did I discover the U.S.? Growing up in Winnipeg it was an annual migration of ""tobans"" to the shopping mecca of Grand Forks, N.D.......where we would wear all our new purchases crossing the border back into Canada to avoid paying the duty. Probably instilled my dislike for shopping and veered me into fishing. I now declare everything at the border."
