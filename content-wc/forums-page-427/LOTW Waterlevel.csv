With the forecasted rains and seeing the radar this past weekend, has any of the recent rain helped raise the level at all? Just wonders as this is the first year I'm taking my boat up and am pretty careful. That said there is always something there that isnt on a map or youdidn't see. Thanks."
1448632,Obabikon,2012-06-13 05:49:00,2370,"The lake isn't that low anymore. A month ago it was probably 1.5 feet low... maybe 2 feet. Now, after that heavy rain, we're probably closer to 6 inches low. No need to worry too much about the water levels at this point."
1448636,bassface44,2012-06-13 06:09:00,96,"eyeman, My group heads up to that area starting the 7th. If you think of it I would love to get a report when you leave. Are you in Kenora or just near there? We fish out towards the Barrier Islands mostly."

1448800,IaDave,2012-06-13 10:58:00,476,I was at Witch Bay last week and they said it was about foot low.
1448980,eyeman_1,2012-06-13 18:31:00,690,I'll be up at Wiley Point Lodge south of Kenora a bit. We'll be there 6/30 - 6/6 coming home on the 7th. I'm afraid I might miss you but I will report as soon as I get back on the 8th.
1449113,bassface44,2012-06-14 05:44:00,96,Appreciate it. We are stayin at a place in French Narrows this year and will have WiFi.....supposedly
1449366,Manitou,2012-06-14 14:47:00,125,"It's been pretty wet lately, lots of showers.Lake has definitely come up to ""normal"" levels"
1449525,geareng,2012-06-14 20:44:00,335,"Was at Rod & Reel in Sioux Narrows last week, at that point I would agree it was down about a foot. Guess they had pretty good amount of rain after we left, guessing from what I here should be pretty close to normal, or at worst 6 inches down."
