The Gate Family owns and operates this place and it is a Fisherman's kind of place. It's a good value, they know how to fish and take care of people. It has everything you need and is easy to get to. The guides will even give you an honest fishing tip once in a while. They fill fast in the summer months, so call early. August often has some open cabins. www.buenavistaresort.com"
1267022,Thumpr50,2011-02-01 10:33:00,139,"Would recommend a couple spots based on past experience; Clarks Camp is a great facility; Wayne & Karla are super hosts, the chain is a group of lakes that are more manageable in tough weather facilities are great & very reasonably priced. Good numbers lake for walleyes but they are smaller, no pike action. Have not fished their Northern Lights resort but would expect the same quality. We went to Lac Seul because we wanted bigger walleyes & Pike action, but it does come with a price. We stay at Scout Lake Resort & are very happy; have heard good things about Fisherman's Cove, Onaway Lodge; Timberlane Lodge is owned by a good friend of a business associate of mine & comes highly recommended as well. Good luck!"

Found fish relatively quickly and the dicount for your boat is very substanial. Own boat = $359 and kids under 15 are 1/2 price. Bait was included....big deal for our group. Very easy to navigate. Dark stained water too. It kep the fish shallower and easier to find on the weed edges, even during midday."

Don't think they cook for guest but not sure we cook our meals No need to pay an extra 1000 dollars for someone else to cook and you don't have to go far to find big eyes
1271517,James Morris,2011-02-15 16:32:00,544,"I'm not disputing your experience, but would like to offer up my own. It sounds as though yours may be more recent and a better indicator of what to expect, however- I went to Clark's camp in the mid 90's and didn't have the same fishing experience. I agree that Wayne and Karla are friendly hosts, but that's where our experiences diverge. We experienced tough fishing, as did the rest of the guests. To be fair and transparent, the weather was tough - highs were in the upper 90's in early to mid June. There was a bite to be had, which we learned about on the last day - leeches were the ticket. Unfortunately, leeches were hard to come by and minnows were the predominant recommendation. The cabin window screens had holes in them, which meant that we were swarmed with mosquitos each night (as the windows were wide open in the evenings due to the weather). The fishing on that chain will be better for muskie than pike and the walleye we caught did seem to average 14"". If you bring kids here, have them cast a minnow-bait with a wire leader - around the dock where Wayne parks the float plane. There used to be muskie that would wait for him to transfer minnows from his plane to his bait tanks that would feast on the minnows that missed the tank or the dead minnows that were pitched. My brother caught a muskie on his first cast of the trip and I later caught one on a six weight fly rod, right off that dock."

1446628,Rivratz,2012-06-08 10:58:00,105,"I didn't read through all of the posts but, my vote goes to Paradise Cove in Minaki! Minaki is located on the Winnipeg River just north of Kenora. It's on the river but, is connected to a ton of lakes and bays. Walleye, bass, musky, pike, lake trout, perch, etc... The mixed bag! Paradise Cove is family owned, and has a great asst. of different sized and priced cabins to choose from. They also have RV spaces and hook ups. No daily dock fees, boat in and out fees, no fees for this and that. They also have a restaurant and marina for fuel, ice, tackle supplies, bait, guide service, boat rentals, etc... An excellent drive to fish camp in beautiful Minaki, Ontario!"
1446765,trapper_john,2012-06-08 18:01:00,83,"Our choice over years has been Kingfisher on Wabbie. Great camp, great people and good fishing. It's a wife friendly camp to. Nice clean and comfortable cabins. More like homes than cabins. Just hit the Red Lake road and get off at Perrault Falls. We couldn't be more pleased, and we have been to a number of others."

1266242,Further North,2011-01-30 08:46:00,2008,"How's the northern pike fishing? They make a lot out of the musky fishing in the lakes the resort is on, but I'd be concerned that numbers of musky would be no match for numbers of pike."
1266294,Blue Lk,2011-01-30 10:30:00,269,"The Indian Lk chain is not noted for great pike fishing,like most guys in this area I rarely target pike."
1266298,rather-be-fishin,2011-01-30 10:39:00,429,Looks like a nice resort & accomodations & boats.....noted that price of $320 per week private boat does not include any gas or bait in package so add additional fees for that and there is $115/week docking fee.

1266627,bobbylfishermon,2011-01-31 09:14:00,241,"Correct Sir, BUT, they are $150- $300 per person cheaper than any resort in the area, with great accommadations, that buys alot of gas and bait! (I don't BUY $4.00 a dz. minnows anyway, I pull #5 & #7 shadrapsand catch all the fish I want,catch 90% of my fish on the back treble, so I MAY lose 3 raps in two weeks, 2 or 3 dz. minnows every time out!!!!

1263996,Mark R,2011-01-23 10:31:00,1538,"My mistake if Fishermans Cove now gives a discount for bringing your own boat. When I looked into it several years ago I was told""well, don't come here"" I didn't."
1264139,Further North,2011-01-23 19:12:00,2008,"Why would a resort discourage fishermen from bringing their own boats?I've got a lot of good electronics on my boat, and I'm sure not going to go someplace where I can't use it."

We have never been discouraged not to bring our own boats. The cost savings is $95 per person per week if you bring your own boat. That also includes 30 gallons of gas per week and excellent dock service where they automatically gas up your private boat every evening when you come in, so that when you head out in the morning you have a full tank of gas. Last year I had motor problems with my boat and they gave me one of their camp boats to use for the last day of fishing at no additional charge. By the way, their camp boats were very nice and great to fish out of too! Just wanted to clear up any misinformation posted about the resort! RBF"

Each resort has it's own features and you should visit their web sites to see what fits your needs.For example, right across from me is a resort/rv park called South Bay on Gullrock. it has good docks, gas available, minnows available, a sand beach, and I see people fishing off the dock during the day and in the evening and they appear to be catching fish.Gullrock is a great fishery with walleye, northern pike, whitefish, and perch available.

There were times that we didn't even go out in the boat because of weather and still fished off the dock and caught our limit. So much fun. I spend 1 week a year there and it's not enough.
