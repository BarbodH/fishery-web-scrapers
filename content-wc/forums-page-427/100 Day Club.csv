This will be my 28th consecutive opener on the same water. I intend to keep at it until I get the hang of it.Just got off the phone with one of my long time fishing partners and we think it's a good idea to go in May 12, fish pike for a week, and then have the rest of our party join us for a week of fishing the walleye opener which begins May 19."
