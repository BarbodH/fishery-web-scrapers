I am picking up a ""canadian packed"" flat of crawlers, but i may want to put some in some other containers if they are packed too tight. What bedding should i use for the least issues at the border? just any artificial bedding? or do some get turned away? Thanks!"

About can guarantee they will be packed too tight.We always buy flats then transfer the worms to our containers containing either Buss or Magic bedding. We pick the worms out then rinse them before transferring them to our bedding. Make up your bedding in a five gallon bucket then get it cool before putting worms in. Letting it set overnight assures all the water is soaked into the bedding. My worm fridge is kept between 38-42 degrees. Just a little too warm for the beer..... but the worms like it.Watch the moisture in the bedding. Too wet or too dry will kill a flat pretty fast. So does too hot or too cold.Pooch"
1449805,Lovetofish,2012-06-15 15:33:00,458,Just about any sporting goods place will have paper bedding. I used Magic Brand as Pooch mentioned and bought it at the local Walmart. Follow the mixing directions and keep them cool. I also used the Magic worm food. Several weeks ahead I'd go to our golf club early morning and pick up crawlers on the fairway and kept them in my fridge in a worm farm. Keep them fed and moist and they will last a long time. For the ride to camp I put my worm farm and salted minnows in a cooler along side a frozen gallon of drinking water covered with a towel. Re-freeze your jug when you get to camp or what I did was have two frozen jugs to swap out when one thaws. Good luck. I'll be going in 4 weeks.
