1440152,Blue Fin,2012-05-24 14:20:00,47,"How long do you fish a lake up in Canada before you consider switching? It seems like there is always something bigger and better out there. Our group likes to get familiar with a lake/resort and know spots to fish. We aren't very good at hitting a brand new lake and having a lot of success. So while we are starting to consider a change, at what point do you pull the trigger?"
1440167,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-05-24 14:44:00,84,My group has been going to the same section of Lake of the Woods for 37 years. The lodge we have been staying at for the last 10 years or so is going to close in the next couple of years. We are throwing around the idea of changing lakes but the three older guys have very little interest in it. This is my 22nd year and I have never fished anywhere else in Canada. I would like to change to another lake or another section of the lake but getting the older guys to change will tough. Our problem is finding a place on LOW that we like and fits our needs. I think changing would be a good thing and make it sort of a challenge. We'll see. 13 days and counting.
1440171,3M TA3,2012-05-24 14:49:00,2846,"When you become bored. Gee whiz. The quest is at least half the fun, IMO."
1440172,phishfearme,2012-05-24 14:50:00,1242,"we change every year - but that's because we go to flyin lakes where we're the only cabin (housekeeping outpost) on the lake and as a result the lakes are not huge so after a 10 day trip, we've pretty much seen it all and know where the best spots are - we also get some guidance for starters from people who've been there previously. searching out the spots and paterns is a big part of the challenge. phish"
1440174,wallydave,2012-05-24 14:52:00,2151,"Blue Fin has a good question here! I really like our present camp operator and lake, but there are tons of lakes to fish, and getting to know a new one can be a source of doubt, how will the new operator be, how is the fishing, the cabns and the boats? This site is great for reports on all of the above. One year we tried a differnt one, not much help from the staff, down right rude at times, the fishing was less than great, we will never go back to that one!!! Our camp, Goose Bay Camp has become a friend, plus Andrea has continued to make improvements to the camp, up-grading the boat, cabins and docks! If I could swing a second trip I would try a new one, but for now the one trip we will be heading back to the Goose!!"
1440194,Freytown,2012-05-24 15:32:00,770,"1. Quality of fishing. My number one reason for driving 700 miles oneway. When I no longer find good fishing I move.2. Quality of Outfitter. Unfortunately this doesn't remain the same. Ownership changes and sometime so does the service.3. Cost $$$. Are you getting what you pay for?I moved a few years ago because the fishing became so-so. Found another good fish camp but the camp was run down. Next year went to another camp at new location & I am going back again.Moving can be a stessful thing but it can provide a better experience. Canada is a big country, eh?"
1440202,dan cardinal,2012-05-24 15:46:00,64,"Bluefin, may I ask what body of water you have been fishing? I ask this because, I have fished 15 different bodies of water in NW Ontario... drive-ins, boat-ins, and fly-ins...in pursuit of discovering something bigger and better. Sometimes we have found it...sometimes we didn't. However, over the course, I have learned the qualities and characteristics that make for the best walleye fisheries...if that is what you are pursuing. In my opinion your group needs to be ready for a change of scenery and eager for a new adventure, or it sounds like to me that you should stay put. You may be on the best of the best right now."
1440203,RapShad,2012-05-24 15:46:00,76,"It's funny that this subject comes up because last night I was thinking about when/if our group will make a change. We drive up to Sioux Lookout every year for a week and it is a long trip coming from KC (20 hour drive) and my dad coming from southern TN (27 hour drive) so we don't have a lot of flexibility to make changes or making two or three trips up a year. Our camp in SL (Red Pine Lodge) has a few fly in outposts and I was thinking about proposing to the group about taking a 3 or 4 day fly in then continuing with our normal week in a few years. IMO as far as making changes it is best to start off small (especially if your group has been going up as long as we have). Plant the seed of making some changes and explore and discuss them as a group. Ask around, cruise Walleye Central, and find out what changes certain people are willing to make. Once smaller changes have been made without major issues then I imagine the Old Dogs in your group will become more open to making larger changes. Don't ever leave your group in the dust to make a big change it is hard to find good fishing buddies that mesh well and really enjoy eachother's company for a whole week, and that's really what going up there is all about."
1440248,drlee,2012-05-24 18:13:00,409,"This message really caught my attention! 1987 was my first Canada fishing trip and we went to a lodge on Eagle Lake. We had no idea what we were doing, but were so excited about the trip, it did not matter. The second year we went back, but the lodge had changed ownership. We really became good friends with the new owners and fished from that lodge for several years. Then, Eagle Lake died. I mean, dead sea. So, the search began! Over the next number of years, I fished around 15 different lakes/lodges in northern Ontario. My journies included fly in's, boat in's, drive in's and frankly, it was really fun! Some places the fishing was outstanding; others, not so much. As you might expect, the fly in's (we did Lake St. Joe out of Sioux Lookout with Vern at Slate Falls) provided the highest quality fishing. We did, however, discover that in most places the owners of the camps and their employees were really great people. Over time, I bought my own boat and got older. Through my own research, with help from Walleye Central, and contacts with friends who also fished Ontario, I have narrowed my fishing down to 2 lakes...and, since I am retired for 6 years, I now spend a full month in Canada annually. I drive in because I love fishing out of my own boat; I have become a (somewhat) better fisherman, so I don't really need to fly in to catch lots of walleyes. Both lakes are quite remote and are in the Ignace area, which is much less ""busy"" in terms of fishing pressure, IMHO. Conversely, I have also continued to try new lakes. I go to my favorites for 3 weeks and then experiment with a third lake annually. Quite frankly, and this should come as no surprise, I have enjoyed exploring new lakes, but typically do NOT catch nearly the numbers of fish that I do on the 2 I have learned well over the past six or seven years. I have, therefore, rather lost patience with exploration and will likely stick with the two I favor. But, there is this lake that I have been thinking about........."
1440304,green&orange,2012-05-24 20:02:00,28,"At least that is the plan. I do things a bit differently than most by car topping a 12' boat off remote logging roads and camping on smaller lakes that do not have lodges. We figure the first year is for figuring out the lake, seeing the sights, and exploring. The second year is for catching more fish because you know the spots, what works and what you need to do to get there. Personally, I feel that planning the trip is the most fun. Picking out a lake, figuring out how to get there and the amount of work it will take (number of portages), pouring over maps, google earth, ect. That kind of stuff keeps us going in the dog days of winter. I love exploring and seeing new places. We are going back to the lakes we fished last year but have already picked out our 2013 destination."
1440305,phishfearme,2012-05-24 20:05:00,1242,you and lenray need to get together - look at some of his posts - he's been to some incredibly isolated lakes without flying in. phish
1440332,Rivratz,2012-05-24 20:59:00,105,"That's a toughee, for sure. It's difficult to go to new waters and try to learn the lay of the land when you go for a week or 2 per year. Depending on the lake or river system, it could take years just to get comfortable with where the hot spots are, and, just to navigate the waters comfortably. It seems those elusive hot spots change daily, while your there. Slamming them one day, and the next day there gone. But, if you know the waters, because it's your summer stomping grounds, you just head off to the next spot. I myself am a creature of habit going to the same place for decades. Which is Minaki. I have been to Lac Seul, at Goose Bay Camp, a couple of times. Andrea does a great job. I just hated navigating new water because of the unknown hazards. Rocks!!! I had too many close calls there. Cruising in 100 FOW and all of a sudden your in a foot of water without any hazard warnings. Just crazy! Then it takes time to find the spots. I do like Lac Seul, and, I'm glad I went to explore new territory. I've been on a couple fly-ins, stayed on the English River, at Caribou Falls, at Halley's Camps. Enjoyed my stays, caught fish, but, it wasn't home, like Minaki. I have cruised the Winnipeg River system in and around Minaki at 2am from spots, and can find my way around easily & comfortably. The night time hazards are floating logs. Just can't be flying around fast after dark. Of course at about 11pm when darkness falls upon the waters, the mosquitos are the main reason to come in. They come out by the millions! When the creatures of habit don't want to go elsewhere, it's because, ""There's No Place Like Home"". You can""t blame them. If it's not broke... why go elsewhere?"
1440363,Larry S,2012-05-24 22:33:00,665,"My first canadian trip was in 1974 to a drive in camp 20 plus miles north of Kenora near Redditt,Ontario.The owner lived in the same area near me in Chicago & we became good friends. I went almost every year and sometimes two or three times a year to his place. The great thing about fishing here was that there were many lakes in the area to portage to,& we drove many times up the logging road,going towards Seperation Lake to fish these virgin lakes Also over the years starting in 1980 I went on a fly-in almost every year to varied destinations There is always a big thrill to touch down on a virtually virgin lake to fish with your friends for a week of relaxation. I have had many fishing partners over the years and now go with Phishfearme's group from Pittsburgh,driving in from Las Vegas to partake in our great adventure. This year we head for Pickle Lake for 10 days to have another great adventure."
1440364,jimmie,2012-05-24 22:36:00,123,"When all the fish are gone!! I found Lac Seul a little over a dozen tears ago. In that time I have made numerous trips sometimes more than once a summer. I have fished in the Sioux lookout region and regret that I stayed on Eagle lake for far too long. There are numerous lakes in the area that offer resonable to great fishing. Pelican, Minnitaki, Abrahams, Little and Big Vermillion, with a small chain of lakes in that park (Ojibway) for smallmouths. I have caught Musky, smallmouth bass and pikein Little vermillion, Hooch, musy lakes which run togethewr. I have caught many very nice smallmouth and pike on Big V. TYhere are Musky, smallmouth, pike and walleye on Abrahams, Minnitaki and Pelican. I have also tried the Sturgeon River for musky and walleye with some success. Lac Seul is a trmendous walleye body of water from west to east and north to south. It is huge in acres and uncountable bays and so many miles of shoreline. The main metjhod for fishing for every year class you can think of is a jig and minnow or crawler. Spiiners work as well and plastic curlytails. I will not live long enough to fish all the nooks, crannies and sunken reefs that this body of water has but I try and do find a few new spots each season. Its just so much fun! The fish can be eaters to well over 30""in lenght. I am going back to cxatch a paticular one I believe to be over 35"" that broke me off last year! Whether you change your fisin' hole or not is always up to you. For me I like the adventure as much as the next guy but when you are not ""Joe Walleye"" as I am not then you can take great pleasure in still finding something new each trip. There are good motels and resorts in the area. Good luck."

We can run 30miles in any direction, hitting 7 or 8 good/great fishing spots on the way. These are just the spots that we know of, I'm sure there are a hundred that we havent found yet. Each trip we make it a point to try and find a new spot that produces.When we find all of the spots in the area and get bored, then we'll move to a new lake or river system. Somehow I dont see that happening."
1440440,octanehi5,2012-05-25 07:13:00,1104,If your trip does not live up to your expectations its time to change. My fishing time is very valuble to me so I make sure I am on a very productive lake. The one I fish now is my 6th yr going back to
1440570,camp chef,2012-05-25 10:41:00,915,We move when the lake seems to be getting smaller.If you are fishing the same bays and rapids and reefs etc. you are not seeing new sights. There is just so much to find and see in NW Ontario that it is easy for me to move every few years. The exploring aspect of a canadian trip is a very big part of our enjoyment.
1440590,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-25 11:20:00,235,"When I first started going, we switched fly in outpost lakes about every two years, but using the same outfitter. The old timers in our group fell in love with a particular lake that we've used the past 7 years. I'm kinda ready for a change, and the two main drivers of that are: -New species (I want a smallmouth option in addition to walleye/pike) -It's fun to explore But as long as I go with this group, I am at the mercy of my friend's dad, he's a ring leader of sorts. I'm fine with that because we always have a great time, but some day I will be the trip organizer/cruise director and will probably want to change every couple years. If a lake is small enough to where you know all the spots, it's not quite as exciting."
1440633,Guest,2012-05-25 12:58:00,0,"When do we change lakes? Hmm, that depends because our criteria changes as does the lake and the outfitter. A few scattered thoughts:  Stuck with a good outfitter. Did a string of 7 fly ins with same outfitter. We found near perfection the first year (first year cabin was on lake, deluxe cabin, OK boats, tons of fish). Liked it so much went back the next year. Mastered that lake so we asked the outfitter to take us to another one of his lakes. 2 more good trips. Asked outfitter to take us to third lake  not as good (crappy cabin, wtf). We booked with him again, but he since sold to a new outfitter. Worst disaster in vacation history. Of course we found a new outfitter for the next trip.  Booked with various outfitters/various lakes. We liked being on a new lake. The sense of adventure, finding new honey holes, discovering a trapper cabin or something interesting. Generally had good fishing luck (same approach*). Some outfitters better than others. If we had found a really good one, we probably would have stayed with him for many years.  Criteria changes. First we wanted fishing action. Then fast walleye action. Then wallie/pike size. Then we wanted to bring our own boats (so no more fly ins)  Been driving to same big Ontario lake for about 7 years now. Same fantastic resort  no need to move. I am getting ansy  thinking of changing just for the adventure. My co-leader is so satisfied with current trip that I think we will be returning a few more times.  Sometimes routine is good. If we return to the same place we know what to bring, no surprises, etc.  Our group is getting older, so basic comforts are becoming more important (indoor johns, no hauling water, no obstacle course piers/docks). I think if you are getting restless with the current venue, its time for a change. Granted change is not without some risk, but the eventual reward is worth it. Same approach for our fly in lakes. Late June or early July. Fished 6-12 feet of water. Targeted the emerging cabbage weedline (usually in 8 fow). Troll or cast ¼ oz. jigs and crankbaits along the weedline. Sometimes the tips of the weeds were barely visible  troll it like you were driving down the highway following the double yellow line. Also targeted rocky or weedy points."
1440700,Danbear,2012-05-25 15:07:00,72,"My buddy and I had never been to Canada so our for our 1st trip to Eagle Lake we took one of those bus trips, Food was ok but you had to eat in shifts due to the massive number of fisherman there, cabins were ok, bar was great, but we decided we needed something different, went to a smaller resort for 2nd trip and brought my own boat along and had fun, went back for trip #3 and we thought about looking else where. Between trip 3 and 4 the ownership changed and now we are treated like one of the family. I don't think I could run out of new places to fish on Eagle Lake with the size of it."
1440811,FrankLeigh,2012-05-25 22:05:00,80,"Our group had been going to the same camp for a lot of years. It was a great spot, remote, yet only about 5 hours drive for us, from southern Ontario. The owner retired and the buyers made the camp into a private club. We tried other camps in the general area but we could not access the same waters from these locations, so we went further afield, up to a 12 hour drive. Five years and five camps later we thought we had found a suitable replacement. However, after three years, the owner of our new favourite spot jacked up his prices by about 30%. This coincided with terrible weather (snow) and a poor fishing week. So, we have been on the move again, for the last two years.I love to see new lakes but if you have a camp that you like and the fishing is good, it would be hard to make the change. There are about a quarter of a million lakes and rivers in Ontario, so there is an almost unlimited choice for a lifetime of fishing. You have to decide if it is about the quantity or quality of fishing, or the camp, or the scenery, or the company of your friends and relatives.In some ways, you could look at it like you would a career. Do you want to retire from this place or is it time to move on. Is it worse to regret the things that you did or that you did not do?"
1440865,Kevin R,2012-05-26 06:57:00,305,"I have heard Eagle lake has come back big time, my friend keeps bugging me to go fish it. I may go for day this season although I have said this for 30 years or more. The last year I fished Eagle was 1968 & at that time lakes north of Eagle on the Red lake road were like fly in lakes that had little to no fishing pressure."

You have all of that water north to B & L Sand, all of the Roughrock waters, then all the way down the river to Kenora. Take the boat lift in Kenora on the endless LOTW waters, and you are able to navigate those waters ""Northwest Angle"" right in to Minnesota. Of course at that point your about 100 miles away from camp."
1441253,camp chef,2012-05-27 12:09:00,915,"You are right...We have not even scratched the surface here at Minaki. That is why we will always come back here even we feel the need to take a ""field trip"" elsewhere every once in a while. I have a good feeling about this trip we will be on the water up there June 8th for a week."
1441528,rnnonmt,2012-05-28 09:36:00,992,"I think its time for a change of lakes when you cant consistently catch fish. Time to change outfitters when the service is no longer special. Having fished Lac Seul since 1982 and never been skunked ever we are still fishing this lake. However, we HAVE changed outfitters. We stayed with a particular company for decades until it we were not treated well. The straw that broke the camel back as one of the other guys put it in an earlier post. One of our rental boat motors was a P.O.S. We struggled with it all week. Radioed in a couple times and talked to the owners throughout the week and NOTHING. When we got back to the docks on the final day we asked for a discount for one rental boat/motor because of the trouble we had. The owners were not sympathetic to our request AT ALL and followed up with the question will you be rolling your deposits over for next year? Not likely we said. So the change happened."
1448246,WalleyeWally28,2012-06-12 09:42:00,298,"Good thought provoking question. This summer my wife and I will be making our 20th and 21st trips to Lac Seul in the past 16 years. Here is our short list of what it would take for us to switch lakes:1. No more Walleyes in the lake.2. We live to be 200 years old and have run out of new areas to explore.3. The dam breaks and the lake is drained of water.4. A disaster strikes and wipes out all the wildlife and beautiful scenery.5. All drive-to resorts are closed.Needless to say, we love Lac Seul and the experiences it provides us. We plan to go back every year until we are no longer capable of making the trip."

1448416,octanehi5,2012-06-12 14:45:00,1104,"In twenty five yrs our group has fished about 15 differant lakes and outfitters in northern Quebec. Top three are, third the Goiun res. bay du nord. used to be owned by air melincon, second a lake called lac lacroix ,the eagle river just north west of the goiun, And # 1 Air Tamarac's Lac Hebert, this yr is my 6th yr there,It just does not get any better, not leaving anytime soon.We have had trips to this lac and caught as many as 850 walleye's in a week of fishing two men in one boat.So my answer is its time to change when the lac or outfitter does not live up to your expectations of your trip. I am a ferm believer that drive to fishery's are getting to much fishing pressure. verses a good fly in lac. For my money I do not want to see other boats fishing near me. Some of our group do not see each other any other time of the yr but on the lac.The beauty of the trip is in the eye of the beholder."

Same lake different owenrs of the set of cabins we stayed in. We still target a week in August for a family trip. Will not change this ever. We do a guys only fishign trip to a different lake, mainly a flyin trip. Went to the same lake several times and always had a good time. Problem is that we would always tend to go back to the same bay or location to fish and not really explore much. Nice cabin wiht a river system to fish along with several back lakes to hike into. Now we are planning to go a different lake with the same outfitter. We like the challenge of exploring a new location. Really die hard fishermen on the trip, fish all day."
1441801,jimmie,2012-05-28 19:33:00,123,"Lac Seul has smallies as well as being one of the best wallryr lakes in North America. There is also pike, musky. One of the best smallie lakes I've ever found is Little Vermillion in Ojibwa Park just off 72 just south of Sioux Lookout. There are other lakes via a channel at the west end of the lake. I have coaught my largest smallie at 20 1/2"" in the park. There is a small lake to portsge just a few yards from little V going towards the falls on the east end. There has been a 25"" smallie caught from there just a cpl years ago. If you should ever get to the Lac Seul/Sioux Lookout stop by any bait shop and ask. Good luck and let us know how you do no matter whre you end up fishing."
1440443,doubleheader,2012-05-25 07:16:00,2652,"Typically, and this is for most people but certainly not everyone, it takes some type of event, the ole ""straw that breaks the camel's back"" adage. It may be quality of fishing, service, accomodations, or it may be information about a new area that seems to fit what you're looking for, it may be a variety of things, but usually there is some sort of trigger. Next week I leave for a rather short stay to check out a new lake; a scouting mission. I have little doubt the fishing will be excellent, we've researched this beforehand, we're more concerned about getting our boats in and out, the accomodations, and so on. Were investigating the change because last year our walleye fishing was the worst. In our case we love our cottage, we enjoy the hosts and the scenery, but if the fishing sucks this year and our new place checks out, we're outta there, or, cutting our trip from 2 to 1 week."
1440492,Terwalleye,2012-05-25 08:40:00,166,"Our group fished the Cippewa Flowage for years. Each year the fishing seemed a little less productive. So thanks to too much free tie and the internet I researched the heck outta of finding alake in NW Ontario. All I can say is know what is important to your group and look for it. We preferred a shallower stained water lake, Drive in, and something big enough to explore but to too big to navigate. After narrowing it down to a couple of choices I stumbled across Walleye Central. After reading some very positive posts about one of the lakes; we pulled the trigger. Then posted on here about looking for a little help. I got tons of good info from here. General stuff like where to spend the night on Friday and to order my licence over the phone 6 weeks ahead of time. And also got very specific fishing spot info to boot. Hit the like running with a couple dozen suggestions for places to try. This site was a Godsend and our group had our best fishing trip ever 2 years ago. Last year was even better. In three weeks we go back for year three. Thanks WC!!!"

One year, I believe it was in the early to mid 90's me and my partner stopped at another lodge on the lake and talked to the owners..we werent looking to leave the other place, just looking to see how the other half lived..grabbed a brochure and went in for lunch..I left the brochure on the kitchen table and after lunch we went back out.. When we came in for dinner (american plan) we noticed that we had some ants in our cabins kitchen by the sink..at dinner we told the owner and he said he would go take care of it while we ate in the lodge..after dinner he met us down by the dock and asked if we wanted to go to a remote lake the next day that can only get to thru a long, narrow river..he said it would take about 45-50 mins in camp boats but we would catch tons of walleyes..so of course we said yes Me and my partner suddenly realized that he had seen the brochure fo the other lodge on the lake.. The next morning he met us at the dock right at 7 and said lets go, Ill lead the way..it was sunny at the time but not even half way there it started to rain and then it started to pour..I actually felt sorry for him as he was in his mid 60's but he hung in there and got us to the lake..he pointed out a few spots and left...we had a field day..it was one walleye after another..we were elated.. We came back in time for dinner and told him we had a great time..after dinner he pulled me aside and started telling me about 3 spots he fishes and consistently catches big fish. One he called ""the hump""..it was a rock reef that came out of 44ft of water up to 10ft..gave me the landmarks to line up to find it..after dinner me and my partner went out there and with the help of our deptfinder were able to find it..we anchored and began to jig..within 5 mins I caught an 8lb walleye and followed that up with a 5lb walleye about 15 mins later..all I could think was why didnt he tell us this years ago, but I was happy.. A few years later he sold the place to the present owners due to his wifes failing health..on his last day in the camp as he was leaving for the last time he told the new owners to ALWAYS take care of our group..and they have..for the past several years we have worked some of the sports shows in our area for them and they give us a nice break on our fees..we never have to put up a deposit and we are locked into his newest 12 man cabin as long as we have 7 or more guys.. So my long winded answer to the short question is no, we wouldnt go to another lake.."
