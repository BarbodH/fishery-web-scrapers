By July, the walleyes have generally moved out from shore lines and are relating the mid lake structure. Moose Island is always a good bet. Fish all around it and don't be afraid to pitch jigs up into 6-10 feet, and/or troll crankbaits around it (DT 10's and DT 16's). The fish may be anywhere from less than 10 feet to more than 30, but all relating to the island structure and the slope. Wind matters, of course, too. Also, if you look on your map north of Moose, there is a pretty big 30 foot flat that drops sharply into deeper water on the west edge. That edge and up onto that flat have been very good to us, too. Last year we hit that hard one afternoon with leeches on lindy rigs and caught a mess of nice walleyes, including some perfect eaters. As a bonus we had 7 smallies over 18"", including one 20.5"" pig! As for muskies, my understanding has been they are pretty few and far between (more than normal), and if you find one it's a bonus. I have spent a fair amount of time in Strange Bay (east of Moose) throwing for northerns with good luck. Even picked up a bonus 27"" walleye on a bulldog in 6 feet of water in late July a few years back. Anyway, good fishing all around Red Gut. Have a great trip! Bill"
