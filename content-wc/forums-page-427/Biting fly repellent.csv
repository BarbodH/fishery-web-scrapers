1449007,phishfearme,2012-06-13 19:44:00,1242,"i like the title ""spawn of satan"" better than the term we use ""ankle biters"". this calls for duct tape!! we duct tape the bottom of long baggy pants - including covering the socks, and this tends to hold them back. on one trip, i noted that the previous group had left flyswatters in all the boats. i stupidly asked my buddy ""what's the fly swatters for?"" as we left them on the docks and took of fishing. when we came back we put the swatters back into the boats and they stayed there all trip. swatting them was only temporary relief but it made us feel psycologically happy. phish"
1449023,Pooch,2012-06-13 20:15:00,4619,"Taking fly swatters in the boat and splattering them makes me feel better, but the guts just draw more flies.Boots work good, but you feel like a dork walking around in them. Usually it rains a lot so we only feel dorky some of the time.............Pooch"
1449069,BennieS,2012-06-13 21:28:00,108,"Good thing to keep in mind, deet will break down plastic and monofilament so be careful with it around your equipment. We used Sawyer on our clothes including our socks and Ultrathon on our exposed skin. Had mosquitos hover, land on my clothes and take off. The flies we ran into never landed on my clothes and the Ultrathon worked like a charm on them as well as on the no-see-ums. The Ultrathon has won many repellant awards mainly because it is splash and sweat resistant which allows it to remain on your skin longer. I believe it was designed for military use. Typically good 3M product in my opinion and I'm now a believer in the Sawyers' permrithin as well."

1449154,hawg,2012-06-14 06:56:00,2008,"This is the stuff I had spelled wrong in my post, it works great! Most of the barn fly control is this now too so you can get it at any farm supply. Mix some extra in a small sprayer to take with you. The warnings say very dangerous around lakes so spray before you go and be carefull when reapplying. A local guy charges $100 a boat to spray them and he does a bunch of them. We get it in 5 gal pails for our building when the asian beetles are heavy."
1449221,jas4412,2012-06-14 09:01:00,15,you need to get a repellant that has PERMETHRIN and PYRETHRINS. You can get products from your local veterinary supply or farm supply stores. Spray on boat surfaces for multiple days of coverage. Find a product that is long lasting and waterproof.
1448878,Mike Borger,2012-06-13 13:36:00,1554,"I hate those flies!! For as long as I can remember I've called them flesh flies, but I'm sure that's not their real name.Currently I'm leaning towards Spawn Of Satan, somehow that seems more fitting.I remember years back paddling north of Armstrong there were hundreds following me in my canoe. Being a boiling hot day I wore no shirt and it seemed they'd wait 'till I was in mid paddle stroke then they'd rise enmasse, land right in the middle of my back and chomp down.Just maddening. As has been said repellent doesn't work.They were sitting on the inside of my canoe so in a fit of sheer desperation I sprayed deet all over the inside of my boat.This of course had no effect on the flies, however withing 15 minutes the gelcoat on the inside of my boat began to dissolve.I quickly emptied the boat and filled it with water which seemed to halt the process, but man what a nightmare LOL!"
1448895,Slushfish,2012-06-13 14:34:00,263,"Yes, those ""fleshflies"" are the ones I'm talking about. We are used to mosquitoes, blackflies etc. But these things are brutal! I was hoping someone had a magic potion. It does make me feel better knowing they aren't happy only attracted to our boat though."
1448936,TJL009,2012-06-13 15:45:00,145,Ultrathon works great for me. Spray just above my ankles to my toes and the little buggers don't bite.
1448942,JayM5209,2012-06-13 16:04:00,1050,"Yeah, Pooch. It's the sequential and continuous bites on the ankles that drive me to the edge of madness, or beyond. I've wondered whether I need a pair of Chippewa's snake protection boots. They are a little pricey though."
1448950,adempsey,2012-06-13 16:27:00,963,"I believe they are Stable flies (Stomoxys calcitrans), but what I normally call them I cannot say on here. I HATE those **** things. They always seem to stalk me and my ankles for hours."
1448951,Steve of Madison,2012-06-13 16:39:00,230,"I'm wondering if Permathane will work. I think that's what it's called. It's the stuff you spray on your clothes and put them in a bag overnight and it will keep the ticks away, stuff works on them! I just wonder if spraying on your skin will cause some dread disease like, leasions, open sores, male pattern baldness or impotence.....but to get rid of the black flying plague it might be worth a shot.I think REPEL now makes the stuff too."
1448966,Swifty,2012-06-13 17:36:00,9,"We bring along Barn Fly spray that seems to work for all of about 5 minutes and as stated a flyswatter. We're bringing along permethrin this year so will see how that works, but from what i understand you don't want it on the boat much if you plan on catching and releasing where the fish may come into contact with the boat, its very deadly on fish. Saw a while back someone was saying something about dawn dishsoap or some sort of homemade recipe."
1448982,maddogg,2012-06-13 18:41:00,178,We wrapped tin foil around our ankles but then they only bit us higher up.
1448988,elway12,2012-06-13 19:01:00,335,I did a web search about those fly's you were talking about and came across a website that says their repellent gets rid of them? I don't know anything about the company or product but it might be something to look into. The website is pretty informative. It is something like greenheadfly.com.
1448999,Guest,2012-06-13 19:29:00,0,Go to a store that sells products for horses. Farnam makes a product called Flys Off that is used to spray on horses. I spray this on the carpet of my boat a couple of times a day and works like a charm !
1448770,Slushfish,2012-06-13 10:05:00,263,"Last year on our yearly LOTW trip we ran into unbelievable biting flies on the water. They looked just like houseflies. I was wondering if anyone has a remedy for them? It would make it alot easier on the wife and kids. We all know if they aren't happy, no one is happy Appreciate the help. Slushfish"
1448782,a3dad,2012-06-13 10:27:00,115,Sounds like black flys to me. I use a good bug spray with at least 30% deet. Be careful will this stuff. Spray clothes rather than skin where you can get away with it. Also wear long pants / sleeves whenever possible.
1448789,Hump,2012-06-13 10:42:00,578,Saw an ad in Midwest Outdoor Mag. for these patches. I don't know if they work or not.www.deerflypatches.com
1448805,octanehi5,2012-06-13 11:03:00,1104,"Don't mess around with weak repelents, get a pump spray that is 98% deet, deep woods off or something sim.But with the 98% deet"
1448814,hawg,2012-06-13 11:25:00,2008,"a3dad, Octane is correct, I think your talking about periferin(SP?) to be only 30 % like the stuff Coleman makes for spraying clothes. Get some periferin at a hardware store (it's used for asian beetles and box elder bugs that get on houses) and spray your boat carpet and sides, It'll work for about a month, even through rain. It's getting harder to find but it's still around. Works great."
1448822,Aaron-IN,2012-06-13 11:40:00,500,"These are not ""black flys"" he is talking about. They do look like a common house fly and are a major PIA. There are a couple of weeks during the warmer months when they are really bad. I've yet to find anything that works well on them, even high % deet products."
1448827,briand,2012-06-13 11:55:00,48,"you can't own a fast enough boat to get away from those guys.Rubber boats, jeans and a jacket.Deet is spreading butter all over yourself. They seem to like it.Just hope for cool windy rainy days while they are out"
1448828,Pooch,2012-06-13 11:57:00,4619,"We wear light and cheap chore boots sometimes. These little buggers can bite through fabric sneakers, too. Most tennis shoes now have quite a bit of fabric on them and that is no challenge at all for these biting flies. They only laugh at socks!Deet sprayed on your shoes helps for a while. Fly swatter in the boat keeps us entertained sometimes.....Pooch"
1448849,wallydave,2012-06-13 12:41:00,2151,"A good Cuban cigar helps keep the bugs away, at least that's my story!!!"
1448863,MariCruz2012,2012-06-13 13:05:00,2,"I always use ointment bought over the counter... You need to ask the pharmacist first or a specialist for that matter for the brand and the indication you will be using. I tried some once, I just asked them about it."
