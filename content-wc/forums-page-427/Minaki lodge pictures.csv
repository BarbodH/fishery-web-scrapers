I'm doing an internship with a non-profit organization near the town of Fort Frances right now, where I coordinate a few projects with government grant money, mainly soil and water conservation in agriculture. Guiding is more fun than ever when you can't do it all the time. How have you been?"
560440,River_eye,2006-08-18 12:34:00,1486,"I think the condo idea has the most merit. The prices of cottage properties are going up in Manitoba, and there is much demand for new cottage developments. The demand for summer homes by winnipegers seems to be about the only thing that's growing these days."
560456,Guest,2006-08-19 04:34:00,0,"I might go along with that person who mentioned wait. As you know yourself tourism in this area has dropped this yr, and personally I expect it to drop even more IF the U.S puts in that passport deal. Some say it will not, but look, any added expense will be noticed to those first timers who wish to take a vacation to any where, never mind here. I've talked to many resort owners in this area, #### I do a few large sites (who probably guessed who this is in Kenora) RT but the resorts I've talked too are to a certain exten off this summer, and finding it hard to get NEW reservations. The older generation is still coming sure, but hey they are getting older and in many cases unable to travel much anymore. Good luck with whatever you do. Right now I would not start a tourist business at all. I think I can find a better investment in something else IF I had the money that is. Remember too. Help is another issue in this area. Good help is hard to find. Good guides are even harder. For a reasonable price that is."

560627,Guest,2006-08-24 13:27:00,0,"Being a land owner / fisherman in the region I'm content with nothing being built. But with concerns for the residents of Minaki the fire was a real blow. Minaki really seemed to be alive that summer. I don't know how viable the golf course was , but it was a nice touch to the town regardless of the lodge open or closed. As for the future I don't think there is any need for a new fishing camp. I think something along the lines of a higher end Yurks adventures would be a great way to promote what the area has to offer then just fishing."
1449319,Guest,2012-06-14 12:52:00,0,I grew up in Minaki and swam to the lodge everyday in the summer. What a shame! This beautiful corner of the world ruined by greedy investors and money hungry fools.
1449320,Guest,2012-06-14 12:54:00,0,I couldn't agree more!! There is definitely more to Minaki than just fishing!!!
1449322,Guest,2012-06-14 12:56:00,0,You are one of the fools I was talking about.

560418,Guest,2006-08-17 18:49:00,0,"Now that is depressing! Had stayed at Minaki a couple times and have fond memories of great meals in the dining room when Radisson Hotels ran the place. Its a great loss to the region. Would like to throw some blame at someone, but what would that accomplish now? Just glad to have had the experience while it was there."
560423,Guest,2006-08-17 22:36:00,0,"AGHHHH... the good ole trespassers have been out and about....I can't believe I spent $3.95 on those signs asking people not to trespass. Anyhow, what do you think I should do with the property??? Let's open it up to the fine people here on the WC board. Should I build condos? Renovate the existing hotel an dtuen them in to condos? Knock it all down and start over... Let it sit for another 10 years? Everyone, please feel free to contribute. Any comments about Turbo this or Turbo that will be ignored!! I want serious input as to what you would do if you owned the property. You never know, if I like you idea, maybe I will bring you in on the project...put on your thinking caps!!! Rod"
560427,River_eye,2006-08-18 08:27:00,1486,"Sorry, didn't know I wasn't supposed to have those pictures, if you need them taken down it can be arranged."
560428,Reels,2006-08-18 08:49:00,2876,"Rod, In my humble opinion, sell it and take what you can get. Many people/franchises have tried to make it work and it is just not profitable. With gas going up, and the exchange rate low, and the walleye fishing tough you will have less US traffic yet. Camps were down the last two years and I think next year will be plain ugly for camp owners. <{{}}><"
560429,Guest,2006-08-18 09:00:00,0,I can tell you what you shouldn't do with it. Don't turn it into a low rent fishing camp with way too many units (like the guy down the road) or into a short term mobile home/travel trailer park.
560430,Guest,2006-08-18 09:35:00,0,">Sorry, didn't know I wasn't supposed to have those pictures, >if you need them taken down it can be arranged. No worries, Eric. How have you been? Where are you working this year? Rod"
560432,WillieB,2006-08-18 09:45:00,292,"What should be done with it? hmmm........court some new investors?? Judge rules against Minaki developer Failure to carry fire insurance cited in ruling Kenora Daily Miner and News Justice Peter Jarvis has finally released his ruling on the ill-fated Minaki resort, and it goes against controversial developer Phil Archer. In his ruling, Jarvis criticized Archer for his lack of financial statements, failure to comply with an undertaking to produce records, as well as Archer's lack of fire insurance on the property. During a week-long civil trial last August, lawyers for a group of local contractors argued the mortgage on the resort wasn't valid, since it was held by another one of Archer's companies, Celestine. In his 10-page decision, the judge agreed with the plaintiffs. In summary, I find that Archer cared nothing for the lien claimants and decided that they should bear the risk of fire loss by failing to have Celestine insist on the placement of insurance, wrote the judge. The Jewel of the North burnt on Thanksgiving weekend in 2003. The historic main lodge was left a burnt out shell while the bedroom wing, built in the 1980s and several outbuildings and cabins remain. It has taken close to three years to sort out the ensuing legal tangle. During last summer's sensational trial, where Phil Archer testified in his own defence, Celestine was claiming first right of payment for its $5.9 million mortgage of the $7.1 million owing on the property, with contractors trying to reclaim the remaining $1.2 million. Principal claimant Vern Poschner of Parkland Plumbing in Kenora, who is owed $176,000, was pleased with the decision, but he was also quick to say it wasn't over, since they hadn't received any money from Archer. The good news is it's almost over, he said. For sure, I'll do whatever I have to in order to make sure lien claimants get their money, he added, noting further liens and the possibility of foreclosing on the property are still possibilities. Despite having financial troubles before the blaze gutted the main lodge and forced him into bankruptcy, Archer managed to buy back the property from the receiver last January. Terms of the transaction are confidential, and they have not been disclosed. At the time, Archer said he was handing the property over to former employees, because he didn't have the heart to return and manage the property. He was also serving a 60-day sentence at the time, and he was under house arrest, after he was convicted of breaching terms of his 15-year securities ban issued in 1991. Both the restaurant and golf course were scheduled to re-open this summer under new ownership. Former Archer employees Rod Wharram and golf pro Doug Johnston, who were unavailable for comment. The lawyer for the claimants, Jim Hook of Kenora, said the completion of the sale to Archer was imminent, but he wasn't able to elaborate on a closing date, terms of sale or amount paid. All said and done, can't do much to it that hasn't already been done it would seem."

560437,Danny61,2006-08-18 12:10:00,42,"I'm a winnipeger and have been fishing minaki for years I know this year the camps are really struggling to make ends meet with alot of them down by more than 50% occupancy. As far as the fishing goes due to the low water levels and not much pressure fiahing has been great. Hard to find the real monsters but humps in Big Sand and dusk longlineing have produce limits everytime with the occasional Musky now and again. I think Minaki lodge should be turned into a time share condo property. But instead of targetting the wealthy which by the way dont need to travel the 45minute minaki road beacuse they own a 1.2 million dollar cottage on LOTW, you should target your average meat and potatoes kind of families that can have a generational investment into the property. Sort of a Co-op operation including a grociery/gas/golf/bait store and with one operation manager> It's sad to see the tournaments out in minaki especially the Gary Roach Pro Am cant even draw 50 Professionals when 6 years ago that was no problem. Anyway if your out fishing for big walleyes and Musky fish the beach, St Johns and noname in the morning I found crawlers produce bigger fish but leeches are always hot. At night pull #9 Pearl shads and reef runner ghosts at 20 ft or less in the middle on big Sand"
