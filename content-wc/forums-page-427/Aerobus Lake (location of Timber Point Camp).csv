1437783,jsmyers,2012-05-19 23:36:00,198,"Can anybody tell me anything about Aerobus Lake and or Tiber Point Camp?http://www.timberpointcamp.com/From what I understand, it is a oligotrophic lake with a good population of lake trout and pike with some size. Few but large walleyes, smallmouth are present, but not muskies.Is this correct?How does it compare to lakes with similar reputations in the Cedar River Watershed (Cliff, Anishinabi, Wine)? How deep is deep?What is its reputation?Thanks for the input, and enjoy the fishing this summer. Starting a new job and with a baby on the way, I'm taking a year off."
1437880,JayM5209,2012-05-20 09:27:00,1050,"You've described the lake accurately. I've never stayed at Timber Point, but we stop in there every year to pay the launching fee when we spend a day on Aerobus fishing for lakers. Don't know the max. depth, but I do know I've marked bottom at 110' or a bit more. I'm always there at the end of May-first of June so we get the lakers in the top 15'-20' of water. There are lots of lakers and northerns. The lake is much like Cliff, but the lakers are often a bit larger and more abundant, perhaps because Cliff gets noticeably more fishing pressure.I've never specifically fished for walleyes on Cliff or Aerobus, but do pick up an occasional nice walleye on Cliff when trolling for lakers. We've never done that on Aerobus.Aerobus is a nice, secluded lake with very little traffic. Timber Point is the only camp on the lake. The 16 mile drive in from 105 is not bad most years. I could see spending a week there.P.S. Early in the season the little bay where the creek to Wabashkang leaves Aerobus always holds lake trout."
1437964,jsmyers,2012-05-20 13:34:00,198,"Thanks Jay.From looking at some of your other posts, I'll presume that you've never fished Wine Lake to offer much of a comparison to that lake that I'm more familiar with. I'll also assume that you don't target northerns there, but when they are incidental, how big to they get in your experiences?"
1438061,JayM5209,2012-05-20 19:11:00,1050,"No, never fished Wine, but Wine Lake Camp is on my bucket list.We go to Aerobus for the lakers. There have been a few times over the years when we got our lakers early in the day and then slowly worked our way back to the launch working shorelines for northerns. Not being very serious about, the largest we've seen was probably high 30s. Two afternoons I remember doing this we trolled large Husky Jerks along the shore and caught tons of northerns in the upper 20s. Sorry I can't give you better info on the northerns."
1438178,Kevin R,2012-05-21 06:55:00,305,"The last time I was fishing Aerobus was 1998 at that time the road was pretty good but a few years ago I started down the road to Aerobus only to find it getting worse than I have ever seen after going about 3 miles I turned around. I heard the reason the road was in such bad shape was the camp was closed & was not being maintained. I first fished Aerobus in 1970 at that time the old logging camp was still intact but it was a ghost town. The beach was beautiful brown sugar sand & the water was crystal clear with vis way more than 20ft it was an adventure going down the road to get there though we had to take our time & even shore up some spots. When we went to Aerobus it was not for the fishing it was for a change to see new waters. The lake has Lake trout, Pike & Walleye in good numbers. The last time there we caught lots of nice Walleyes & a few pike but didn't fish for lake trout, we found the lake has changed the beach was gone & no sign of the Old logging camp the water vis was about 10ft."
1438302,JayM5209,2012-05-21 10:12:00,1050,"Kevin, not surprised to hear about your experience with the Aerobus Lake road. There have been years when it was not worth the effort. I've been doing one or two annual trips to the area just south of Perrault Falls since 1979, and going back to Aerobus for one day of laker fishing each trip since about 1986 or '87. Timber Point was sold five or six years ago and the new owner did nothing to maintain the road. My understanding is that the previous owner bought it back, brought the camp back up to snuff, and has kept the road in very decent shape the past three or four years. That one day of fishing each year is worth the sixteen miles of slow and careful driving (always pulling the Lund).If Teddi is checking this forum I'm sure he can provide more complete info."
1438339,jsmyers,2012-05-21 11:26:00,198,"According to the TPC website (http://www.timberpointcamp.com/contact2.html), the current owners are Mike and Marlene Johnson. I emailed them and Mike responded.This must be the couple who sold it around 2005 and bought it back recently?Regarding the road, the one time I went down it was about 94 or 95, I remember it being pretty slow. When you write about the road not being maintained, your talking about grading the washboard and potholes mostly, correct? Its not that the road is being washed away into the lakes and rivers, is it? That wouldn't be a good situation for the surrounding fisheries.Also, when Kevin mentions the logging camp, is that the collection of buildings that show up on the topo map around the current landing location?Does anybody know anything else about the camp, such as its function or when it was active? I like to learn about the history of the area as much as I can."
1440758,Kevin R,2012-05-25 19:18:00,305,"Road had many pot holes & washboard effect I didn't go far enough, but the road is shared with the cabins built around the 1990's in Aerobus bay on Wabaskang lake so I am sure it was passable to that point. The camp was active in the 1950's & 1960's it was like a town on the water, we walked to it a few times in the early 1970's from the rapids in Aerobus bay. The path was still clear then but after 1980 it was not passable at least not for me. If you need more history about the camp one of the fellows that worked in the camp lives next to Dutch's in perrault falls. Not sure if the town was burned down but I dont remember anything being there anymore it was over grown with trees bushes & weeds down to the water. The rocky boat launch is not the same spot the town was in. The town was for years active even in winter it was eire to be in that place with nobody around."
1442486,Kevin R,2012-05-30 06:44:00,305,"To be clear I don't think the launch area was in the same spot 20 years went by before we made back in 1998 but it sure looked different. I don't remember seeing anything left of the town or beach in the area things were really over grown with trees & bushes. I also am not sure the year the resort opened, they could offer some history of the area."
1447093,pikeandtina,2012-06-09 22:18:00,145,"J, We fished Wabaskang last year as well and didn't have much luck there ( lack of rain and mayfly hatch). portaged into Wine the third day and never looked back. Can't beat Peffley's...best of both world's, great camp with access to Wine. Just my two cents... John"
1447254,JayM5209,2012-06-10 11:18:00,1050,"As you know from prior discussions, I have not stayed at TPC or WLC, but have fished Aerobus at least one day each year for many years. Hence, I can't give you any good advice re: either camp. However, your ""group caught 2 trout"" comment caught my eye. On Aerobus, if you don't catch two lake trout per person before your lunch break, or by supper time if you sleep 'til noon, you're doing something wrong. We always are there early in the season. Up to mid-June our standard technique is long line trolling of plugs or spoons. During that period we have also gotten trout jigging flashy silver or silver/blue spoons. The same methods should work in early fall when the water begins to cool and the trout begin to cruise in shallower water in preparation for spawning.Between these times, when the trout are in their deep water summer haunts, you still can get them with either method, but you'll need three-way rigs with enough weight when trolling. Your portable sonar is very important for finding the trout - where they're holding and at what depth. Without a depth finder you can spend countless hours trolling or jigging empty water. During the mid-summer, I'd most likely jig for the trout. (If you go to Aerobus for the trout, toss a few blade baits into your tackle bag, as large as you can get.)V-bay gord has excellent information and tips on lake trout fishing on his web site. Check it out at http://www.vermilionbaylodge.com/ont...t-fishing.html. (This is not a paid commercial!)"
1448326,jsmyers,2012-06-12 12:25:00,198,You mean like these:http://www.cabelas.com/product/Reef-...das/739634.uts(Reef Runner Cicadas)?
1448328,jsmyers,2012-06-12 12:29:00,198,"Just to be clear, we didn't really target them much.Early in the season, one of the ways to target lakers in Wabaskang is to fish around the falls out of the lake (both up stream and down). My cousin got one on our grandfathers old generic B/W ""daredevil,"" casting it right into the white, roaring water. It was somewhat of a freak thing, because we had made dozens of similar cast both before and after without result.The other one was on a silver shad rap off of the drop-off on the north side of Wine Lake. I would call that completely incidental, we had mostly been catching pike."
1448422,JayM5209,2012-06-12 14:54:00,1050,"That's the type. For lakers,I like ones a little larger than the Cicada or the Heddon Sonar. Don't remember where I bought mine but a Google search will get you several on-line sources.P.S. The Cicada and Heddon Sonar can put 'eyes in the boat, too!"
1449994,Kevin R,2012-06-16 10:06:00,305,"I have fished both but it's been a long time over 30 years for Wine. I do recall it had a health large pike population back then more so than Aerobus. I have fished Wabby most years but didn't in 2011. I have found the large pike are less common than say 10 years ago in Wabby, but even 25-40 years ago Pike over 40"" we're not often caught. I think they are targeted more than ever on Wabby & I don't think that would be the case at Wine or Aerobus."
1447008,jsmyers,2012-06-09 16:29:00,198,"It doesn't seem that anybody on this forum has fished both Wine and Aerobus.We're in the early stages of planning a 2013 trip, and both Wine Lake Camp and Timber Point Camp are on the list.Can anybody sell me on either, even if you can't compare to the other?Our needs and wants for next year are:-Get off the beaten path further-Catch some lakers, hopefully some nice ones too-Have a really good shot at a northern over 40""-We are more open to a rustic and/or low amenity camp next year than we will probably be in the future (when kids and wives will join).-Good walleye fishing isn't important to us, we don't usually target them.-We'll probably not be going in the first part of the season.We might in the end decide that we'll go back to Wabaskang again...or there is a chance that we'll combine a trip I have to take with my wife to Puerto Rico into our fishing trip. We're leaning toward Wine or Aerobus.Note that none of this should be construed as dissatisfaction with Wabaskang or Dave Peffley (who we stayed with in 2011), or the Gawley's (who we stayed with back in the 70s, 80s, and 90s). We'll happily return to Wabaskang in the future. I think this time we are looking for a bit more of an adventure, and not just a fishing trip. Wabaskang is a great walleye fishery and is also great for numbers of pike and it seems now bass too. The same reasons this is true are the reasons that it doesn't have the depth and oxygen to support a big cisco forage base to support huge pike and numbers of trout. In other words, it is too fertile. Last year, we got 4 northern over 36,"" next year I want to get 4 over 40""!!! Last year, our group caught 2 trout (one in the north part of Wine, the other at the falls). Next year I hope each of us catch at least 2 trout!"
