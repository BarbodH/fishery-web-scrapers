We had a choice of two lakes to fish from and in the smaller of the two lakes it was beyond fantastic. We caught walleye by the hundreds that were in the 17 to 21 in. size daily. The largest was 24 in. We also caught many northern, most between 20 and 28 in. the biggest was 30 in. Also we caught sauger and a lot of perch with none being less than 10 in. the most were 12 to 14 in. It was a waste of time to fish water any deeper than 10 ft. The larger of the two lakes was tougher but produced larger fish and again none from water any deeper than 10 ft. Incoming streams with water falls were the ticket some of the streams were 2 to 3 ft. deep and produced many fish. Trolling and jigs were the way to go. Good fishing, good companions and good food what a life,I wish the same for all of you."

These lakes both produced many fish in the 17 to 21 in. that were very well filled out and/or fat none were skinny, a very healthy enviroment."
