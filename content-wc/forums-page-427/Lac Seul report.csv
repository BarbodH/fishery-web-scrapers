1449369,Jabs,2012-06-14 15:00:00,24,"I agree with Ben. been going up for 29 years & for the opening, we believe it was only down a foot . We have gone grassy a long time and we always have to slow way down before going in through the narrows to get into the bay."
1449446,BenBeattie,2012-06-14 17:21:00,232,"In early July the shallow bite I find is related to the weeds. I don't consider these to be related to bug hatches. On late ice out years may fly hatches can happen in July, however. By July 10 I would be looking for basin structure for big schools of fish, and bigger fish especially. Its been a weird weather year though, lots of extremes. It was HOT 10 days ago now it's much cooler and we lost several degrees of water temps. So it's hard to say what that does to the bug hatches. I've seen a few may flys but for the most part they are still in the nymph stage as evidenced by stomach contents. Quote: Originally Posted by tv4fishSorry Ben, but I'm going to disagree with you.

PS - Ben - I have checked the LWCB data and there is no doubt that it IS coming up - but as of a week ago - there is NO way I would say that area is/was at its ""normal"" level.Maybe I should have been a bit more specific. What I meant was that it is normal water levels for this time of year. It is always low in may and early june. (You should have seen it in April!) I'm sure when you were here it was lower then it is now. In the last week the level has risen a foot, at least. We had significant rains and I saw it go up nearly 6"" over the course of a day. Right now, for this time of year, the level is normal... although normal is a bit hard to define when the level fluctuates as much as lac seul does. As far as I know they are always drawing water through the dam, sometimes more than others."
1447661,tv4fish,2012-06-11 09:30:00,2694,"The ""better half"" and I just got back from a short trip to Sioux Lookout. The weather was great when we were there (last Tues. thru Thurs.). Temp. was high 70's-low 80's, and NO wind. Water temp. varied from 64-68. It turned stormy on Friday. The ""catching"" was not so great - largest walleye was 23 1/2"". Not many in the slot. We found most of our fish in the 30-34' depth range and off reefs in the larger lake areas. We typically fish up in the Grassy Bay area on Lac Seul. The water level is VERY low right now in that area - they must be drawing it down at the power plant, because as we drove up - it was obvious that they have had quite a bit of rain lately. We saw some rocks that we have not seen in recent years. Look for road work on 17 going east out of Dryden, major milling/resurfacing before you head north on 502 - NO work on the causeway east of Fort Frances (for a change). Also road work/delays going north to Dryden."

1448089,Guest,2012-06-12 04:27:00,0,"TV, What presentations worked best for you? Did you use live bait?"
1448136,tv4fish,2012-06-12 06:48:00,2694,"We typically use jigs and live bait (crawlers and leeches).We worked depths from 4-40 feet. We vertical jig and do a ""controlled drift"" (when there IS a wind) - otherwise it's a kicker motor controlled ""in and out"" pass over the depth that we have found the fish. On this trip - the leeches performed better than the crawlers."
1448190,Bitinlight,2012-06-12 08:08:00,95,"Our group of four guys returned Saturday after fishing Lac Seul, June 5-8. We fished the Bear Narrows to Chamberlain Narrows area and had great success with numbers-most fish we have ever caught in June. This was even with the ""non-walleye"" weather the first three days. The bigggest fish was a 28 incher. We also caught fish in the 20-24 inch range and numerous healthy fish in the 15-17 inch range which makes things look good for the future. Most interesting thing was that just about all our fish came from the 3-5 foot range. Very few fish came from deeper than 7 feet. There was some kind of bug hatch going on as the fish we cleaned were full of bugs. We did not see evidence of a May fly hatch. They must have been some other kind of bug. Best presentation was a jig and minnow. When we would run out of minnows, Gulp and Trigger X seemed to work just as good. Lost alot of jigs fishing that shallow, but it was worth it. We used mostly 1/4 oz. as we did not have any 1/8 oz. with. I'm sure 1/8 would have been better. Water about 4 feet low according to our estimates. Overall, it was a great trip for numbers and ok for size."

1448291,Bitinlight,2012-06-12 11:05:00,95,"My friend and I take our wives for a 2nd trip from July 10-14. They really like to fish and catch a ton of walleyes. This June bite in shallow water really caught us by surprise especially with the early spring. Couldn't believe they were that shallow, but I suppose they were after the easy meal with the bug hatch. Will definitely take more 1/8 oz. jigs next time in case they are in tight again. Good luck fishing."
1448991,BenBeattie,2012-06-13 19:12:00,232,"Those bugs are indeed may fly nymphs in the stomachs. That's whey you didn't see any may fly's flying around yet, they were still in the nymph stage in the water. When the nymphs come up out of the soft bottom in shallow water, hungry walleye are there gorging. This is one of the most fun bites of the year.... lots of walleye, and big ones too, in shallow water and they are very active! Timing is everything, but every year in June this bite happens. Best conditions are warm sun and calm in shallow soft bottomed bays. Catching so many fish in 3-8 feet of water is pretty neat. Also, for anyone who is interested.... the water levels on Lac Seul are NORMAL. Not low at all. The level fluctuates 6-8' every year. It is lowest right at ice out then rises until Mid-summer when it starts to fall again. The water has been coming up so fast with all the rain lately. The falls from Pelican to Lac Seul are now deep enough to run in a boat."
1449174,Bitinlight,2012-06-14 07:36:00,95,"Making a return trip to Lac Seul from July 10-14. We will fish the same area from Bear Narrows to Chamberlain Narrows. Do these hatches happen throughout the summer? If so, might I possibly find fish in the shallows again if I hit it right? I am refilling my tackle box with 1/4 oz. jigs and adding some 1/8 oz. should I run into this shallow bite again. Thanks for your information and especially about the water level. I said it was about four feet low because this is the lowest I have ever seen it. Only been fishing Lac Seul for 5 years. After the past five years, I wouldn't go any place else but Lac Seul. Good luck fishing."
