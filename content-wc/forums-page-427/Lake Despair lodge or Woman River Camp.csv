Portages are great and included. Cabins are comfortable and well built. System is large and you spend a lot of time getting places, but Paul doesnt hit you extra for gas. make sure your jigheads are chartruese. The system has a bit of boat traffic since there is a public ramp, but you can get lost if you want to. i think this camp is one of the best values out there and Moss is awesome. Lots of info on his website and facebook pages. PM me if you have specific ??? Good luck!"
