1447385,jiggster,2012-06-10 17:12:00,183,"I would take I35W to I 35E, 35 E will run into 35W on the other side of St. Paul towards Duluth. 35 w and 35 E split in Burnsville."
1447569,Ia Walihntr,2012-06-11 06:27:00,320,"Ranger, Was on 35N third and fourth weekends in May. There are about 4 construction areas on 35E between I690 and Duluth. First one starts at 690 and goes north. We turned off at Moose Lake and had just entered our third construction zone. The zones averaged between 10 and 15 miles long. Trafic was diverted from northbound to southbound or vice versa forcing 2 way traffic on one side. Traffic flow was good on both weekends and movement was not impeeded much. Was still able to travel from 55 to 60 mph. We had no delays and traffic moved very smoothly. I don't think we could have made any better time by detouring the construction areas. (But that was about 3 weeks ago) Marv"
1447625,clearis,2012-06-11 08:29:00,47,"MN 33 northbound: Bridge closed. between Saint Louis County Road 7 and US 53 (7 to 12 miles north of the Cloquet area). The bridge is closed. A detour is in operation. There is a width limit in effect. There is a temporary three way stop condition. Width limit 12'0"". Until August 14. Comment: NB MN33 will be bypassed to SB MN53 with temporary signal system during bridge re-construction. Traffic will drive in a single lane on SB MN 53."
1447892,dutchboy,2012-06-11 15:35:00,5717,"This is at the junction of Hwy 33 & Hwy 53, it's really a non-factor. Since you are leaving Friday afternoon from central Iowa the traffic should be really thinned out before you hit the construction zones North of the Twin Cities. Now, if you were leaving early morning.............................."
1447918,jiggster,2012-06-11 16:43:00,183,I am correct you can not travel thru Cloquet to 53.
1448442,clearis,2012-06-12 15:17:00,47,Small detour. You can go through Cloquet.
1448446,81Saluki,2012-06-12 15:28:00,97,"Ranger,I was up in the Vermilion Bay, Ontario area last week. Minimal construction compared to previous years. If I remember correctly, you will probably have 3 spots where the 4-lane road is reduced to 2 lanes, all on I35. One area is south of Mason City and the other 2 are north of MSP. The MN spots were about 10+ miles long each. Will be frustrating but I don't think there is a shorter/quicker route around those spots. Potential delays will likely depend on the time of day you're on the road.Send me a PM if you have any questions. I'll be happy to answer if I can. :-)Good luck fishing!!81Saluki"
1449485,MorganMan,2012-06-14 18:59:00,341,"You can go travel through Cloquet on 33 to 53, there is a stoplight instead of the ramp, but may get very backed up on high travel times. I have been through several times in off times and been fine, but can see how it might get slow in high traffic times."
