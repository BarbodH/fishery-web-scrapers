544201,Larry L,2004-11-17 21:33:00,335,Bob I fished it in about 1960. The Waterhen was great for walleyes then. Our camp was not all that far from the mouth at Lake Manitoba. We would run down there to fish for northerns. Mostly small but hooked a few real dandies. Sorry that I can't provide something a bit more up to date.;) Good luck. Larry
544203,Guest,2004-11-18 21:00:00,0,At the mouth of the river to Lake Winnipegosis there are some extensive reed beds which held good numbers of pike last time I went.
544214,Guest,2004-11-20 06:19:00,0,"The walleye population on Lake Winnipegosis has been in crisis for the past decade. All kinds of factors from mistrust to mesh size and lack of regulation has made what was once one of the most prolific fisheries in the province to a fishery ""has-been"". The commercial fishery has really had an effect upon the total population of all fish species. Perhaps the fish stocks in Lake w. will rebound as commercial fishermen are seeing the lowest prices in years for their catch which in turn will discourage them from going out to set more nets. I guess we'll see the outcome of the lowest prices in 40 years in a couple of years throughout southern Manitoba! This past year, however, cottagers on the Waterhen had seen decent water flows and the fishing as a result had been good to a little above average. The spring bite is the best time to get there but this spring the bite didn't materialize until quite a bit later (This spring was very late in MB. and they had a cold wet summer). The pike population is ""decent --- up to 10#"" but the leviathons of days gone by are apparently no longer there. I fished the area this year with Cat Eye Outfitter. Dan has fished most of these spots for years and knows people with cottages in the area. If you want more info send him an e-mail. I didn't catch anything too big or for that matter not more than 50 fish in two days but overall it was just an enjoyable experience to fish another part of Manitoba. Lake Dauphin and Lake of the Prairies will give you the best bang for your buck if you're after walleye and some pike."
544681,Guest,2004-12-18 22:11:00,0,search cateye outfitter lake of the prairies as a drive to blows away waterhen low water in summer can mean poor fishing on waterhen cedar lake is also very hot
544736,Guest,2004-12-22 17:56:00,0,"Lake of the Prairies is the hot spot for open water walleyes as far as a drive to location in Manitoba. Lake Dauphin is #1 in the Winter season. Waterhen has been raped with netting over the past 15 years or so but is starting to come back. The Pike fishing is fairly consistent on Lake Dauphin all year, we caught a 15 and 18lber on Friday thru the ice. Email me if you need more info.and check us out @ www.stickysbaitandtackle.com P.S. Hank Parkers Outdoor Magazine, called ""Canadian Walleyes"". We did a show on Lake of the Prairies last August and Hank was really impressed with our fisheries here."
1449538,Guest,2012-06-14 21:24:00,0,i grew up fishing on the waterhen river it has been many years since i fished there. the walleye fishing is fantastic. to answer your question about pike is yes there are northern pike and some big ones. the place we stayed was called lapirres waterhen tourist camp and was famous for walleyes the proprietor and personal friend marselle lapierre would not put a pike in his boat. instead he would spit chewing tobacco in their mouths and release them
