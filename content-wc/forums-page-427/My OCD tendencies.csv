(If you see a red truck with a kayak on top and four young boys and a tired old man in it that is depositing shards of broken plates along Highway 53 that will be us)"
1449348,nd89sc88,2012-06-14 14:06:00,92,"Thanks guys! Glad to know I'm not the only one. And, a couple of your suggestions have already been incorporated into my bins . . . corkscrew . . . spatula . . . etc! Keep 'em coming! Bill"
1449352,Ogoki,2012-06-14 14:15:00,291,"Have stayed in the same cabin numerous times . Some years come in and the kitchen is well stocked . Next year it is bare . We have checked the other empty cabins and see they are bare too . The stuff must grow legs and walk away . LOL . Some people do not realize that if the outfitter has to replace the stuff somebody has to pay for it . We always take two of our own frying pans. Spatula . Good knives etc . I have a York Pack that I have a Coleman single burner stove in , paper plates, kitchen kit (has utensils , spices , matches etc ). When we take an all day trip , the York Pack goes with us . It is waterproof and even floats . Can have lunch anywhere and everything we need is there . Even carry a can or two of pork and beans and canned fruit in it . After having to ""make due"" so many times on early on trips we now come prepared .And like many of you I pack repack and double check ."
1449363,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-14 14:39:00,1460,"This year, I brought up one of those Tupperware marinators. Comes in handy for putting your food in for preparation. This makes the second one that I've donated to the cause, brought one up about 15 years ago and it wasn't there last year. This year, the camp was missing the green bowl. Man we were bemoaning that loss. Know the cookware in my outpost camp about as well as home. We even used duct tape to seal holes in the few stainless bowls we had. Icepick damage for sure."
1449377,tooski,2012-06-14 15:07:00,393,You guys must NOT be doing fly-ins or you have a very lenient weight allowance. LOL at icepicks in the bowls....
1449415,2746,2012-06-14 16:11:00,3206,"And our portable sirus radio. Rig the antenna and we are all set for the music we like, ball games, hockey etc......all depends on what time of the year we are there.I've seen T.V.'s carried into camp but that's one thing I DONT MISS when we fish. Rather sit on the porch with a good scotch, cuban cigar and count the stars or look for satalites. Then a few good hands of pitch or poker.The extra shelves for the bedrooms are a good idea.....will have to add that one!"
1449425,ed08walleye,2012-06-14 16:36:00,27,That's what i was thinking. Frying pan and spatula we've taken. It's hard enough to be under weight for fly-in's.
1449429,Bill Krejca,2012-06-14 16:44:00,6107,"Several cast iron frying pans, spatulas, special spoons, SHARP kitchen knives, garbage bags that actually are large enough to hold several days scraps, etc. Some of these items are of a nostalgia nature, having been originally brought up by my father 80 or so years ago. The old large coffee pot, displayed on my shelf at home finally became too fragile to make the trip any longer. Bill Krejca"
1449431,lcwhit,2012-06-14 16:48:00,104,i am quite sure that my guys would never make the trip without me. they couldn't organize anything. lucky to remember their rods.
1449458,MorganMan,2012-06-14 18:04:00,341,We have our own tong/spatula....it's half tong and half spatula that we use for frying fish. We also bring our own LONG thermometers for the oil that hooks onto the edge of the pan to be sure oil stay where we want it.
1449150,nd89sc88,2012-06-14 06:53:00,92,"As I'm starting to pack (I use that term loosely, it's more like organizing), for my July 1st trip to LS, I'm putting a decent kitchen knife aside to pack . . . not one of my nice Japanese blades, but one that I've put to the stones to get a nice edge on. I'm also putting aside a cutting board, a fry pan, a sheet pan, a kitchen scrubby, dish soap, paper towels, zip locks and trash bags to bring with me. And now I'm laughing at myself and my OCD tendencies . . . so the question is, how many others bring things that, while supplied by your camp/resort/lodge, just don't meet your standards? I'm hoping I'm not the only slightly neurotic one out there! Bill"
1449156,JDP,2012-06-14 06:59:00,1457,"Bill,Don't feel too bad.I am the organizer for our group.Not only do we pack the stuff you mentionedbut we bring along temporary shelving for the bedroomsand dock cleats for the boats just to mention a couple of thingsthat ""don't meet our standards""!John Peterson"
1449211,jas4412,2012-06-14 08:33:00,15,"Along with everything you have listed, we bring our own coffee pot... My OCD has already kicked in for my trip in July. My wife is already asking how many times i'm going to pack my rod and reels....."
1449217,JayM5209,2012-06-14 08:52:00,1050,Plus:- A pot large enough to make chowder for six (at 2-3 bowls per)- six large soup bowls (chowder out of plastic bowls just isn't right)- two 8x8 baking pans for the breakfast coffee cakes- soup ladle- corkscrew
1449241,Gary from Iowa,2012-06-14 09:49:00,74,"I always carry corkscrew, can and bottle opener when I travel. I hate to be a thirsty man with no way to get relief!At some resorts, the cookware takes a beating. In that case, its good to have your own frying pan and spatula, baking sheet and mixing bowl (we make our own bread on slow days) I do have a shore lunch kit with small grate, pan, spatula, cups, cutting board, metal plates and silverware.And of course, way too much tackle. Much that has never seen the water.Gary"
1449249,Mark R,2012-06-14 10:06:00,1538,"Gary, how slow does it have to be before you come off the water to bake bread? I guess I bring lots of stuff. Electric fry pan, stove fry pan, knife set. Paper plates. can opener"
1449255,Gary from Iowa,2012-06-14 10:22:00,74,"Mark R.While my brothers and I like to fish, we do it to relax. If its raining hard or we really have to work hard or our back(s) starts to ache, we come back to the cabin to nap and putz around. Mixing and kneading dough is relaxing and the smell of baking bread is great (sometimes draws in neighbors for a ""visit"" just when it comes out of the oven.)Gary"
1449265,labsrus,2012-06-14 10:30:00,557,"That is normal things to do in my opinion. On our trip I pack a small plastic tote with all the kitchen essentials Spatula Spoons Cutting knife Paring Knife Corkscrew Ladle Pot scrubber Cast Iron pan for frying fish Spices, take all the items I might need for each day, good pepper, garlic, onion salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, etc. Dutch Oven for making fruit cobbler"
1449270,tv4fish,2012-06-14 10:50:00,2694,"UMMM - Gary: Where did you say that you stay (and when will you be there) --All of us are presuming that you ""hand out"" samples?????"
1449277,bcmss396,2012-06-14 11:11:00,296,"We got to the point that we pack an entire foot locker with what we needed to fit our standards. Other suggestions include, good knives for steaks, a regulr table lamp, candles, a small cd/mp3 player, box fan(s), our private library (men's trip only), dice, cards, cribbage board, poker chips, coolie cups for the Labatts, good drink glasses, a good sized cooler to hold our beer supply (fridge is all full of food), power strip and/or extnsion cords and ground adapters for power strip and extenison cords Blair"
