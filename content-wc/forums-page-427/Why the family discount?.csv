1450027,v-bay gord,2012-06-16 12:11:00,3168,"Ted is right. It ends at some point....otherwise the family package would include the grown up kids, their kids, your grandparents and on and on. Appreciate the discount when your kids were young....it's time to move on and contribute to the outfitters retirement fund!"
1450112,remmy,2012-06-16 20:27:00,6,"My father convinced my Mom to take our family to Canada to a drive in camp about 20 yrs ago which continued until us kids didn't want to go anymore. I'm sure glad that he did and I bet the outfitter is too. I'm now 33 and take a fly in trip with the same outfitter with 3 of my friends for the past 5-6 yrs because of that experience. Our fly in camp does not have any intentions to use any different outfitter but I'm sure when those in our camp have children old enough to go north they will be going to the same outfitter. Get the kids hooked, then they have lifetime customers that bring their friends with them. Family plan makes good business sense to me."
1449631,campchick,2012-06-15 08:26:00,96,"Outfitters, and I am one of them, like to encourage fishermen to bring along their children and expose them to the fun of fishing. It is a money loser for us because the air services do not give us a break on flying. If the airplane has 8 seats there is no distinction between a 12 year old or a 21 year old using it. We take a loss so that families can better afford to take their children fishing. I guess we need to brush up on ""making a living 101"". Sometimes, but not always, is the gesture appreciated."
1449644,Ogoki,2012-06-15 08:58:00,291,I have many fly-in canoe trips . I have always paid a charter rate for the plane . When it is just my wife and I we split it two ways . When we have four it is spilt four ways . They have never charged me a per person rate .
1449788,Fisherman Ted,2012-06-15 14:57:00,461,"Also speaking as an outfitter it is a sound business decision in the long term. When going from one or two guys to a family of 6 the price would go up substantially obviously. Pricing often times is a strong barrier to entry in any activity, certainly when talking about lodges. If we charged first time 6 year-olds full price I'm not sure many parents would think 'gee, let's take a trip with our kids' and hope they like it'. If we can't get the family to come an entire trip would be lost. I can think of few businesses that charge full price for families. Speaking as a father it is a wonderful thing to get a child hooked on fishing, something they will enjoy the rest of their life and an activity you can enjoy together. Not many things you can say that about. As an outfitter, yes we may take a hit here and there. But its pretty heartwarming to see multi-generational trips, of which we have many. Watching a grandfather with his grandson or daughter on their first trip is probably the sweetest thing I see each summer. Fisherman Ted"
1449791,tooski,2012-06-15 15:06:00,393,Good post Ted. As grandfatherhood (?) approaches I absolutely agree with you. My post was mainly questioning the fly-in costs. Certainly there are costs associated with lodge fishing but I think discounting the cost of a fly-in was my main question. And if my sons ever get it in gear i would be happy to come up to your place for a week and do the grandfather thing.
1449792,dogrodder,2012-06-15 15:06:00,400,It makes it easier for Dad to talk Mom into agreeing with the fishing trip.
1449920,Catman59,2012-06-16 04:51:00,345,"I will honestly say that if my first trip to Canada wasnt a ""family special"" , I or my family would never have experienced it. As a Dad who pays the whole bill ( no dividing up ) we are on our 12th year as a family. Yes 2 of my ""kids"" are in their 20s and college. I still pay their way and will continue to as long I can afford it. We still get the family discount and sure appreciate it."
1449946,tooski,2012-06-16 07:39:00,393,"""We still get the family discount ""...... . See Cat there's the hangup. I have yet to see a really good answer on why my 20 year olds are no longer eligible for the ""family"" discount. The closest answer was the one that said they wanted to ""start them young"" and thus the discount. Well being in your 20's is still ""young"" in Canada fishing terms. Again- it is not a money issue to me. I just don't get how you can discount a 16 year old and not a 25 year old."
1449948,Guest,2012-06-16 07:47:00,0,Here is the reason your 20 or 25 year old should havea job and pay his own way. He already gets to by on your insurance to 26. What more do they need.
1449950,Fisherman Ted,2012-06-16 08:04:00,461,"Tooski, Its a judgement call. If you want we can charge 10 year-olds full price. But as discussed, we want to get the families in. However at some point they become adults, have jobs and in theory are paying their own way. Most camps make that cut-off around 16. That is also the age where the kids now want their own boats, and our costs start to shoot up. 2 young kids with mom and dad in a boat is one thing. Four 18 year-olds in 3 boats is quite another. Where does it end? Should we give discounts to 40 year olds?"
1449958,tooski,2012-06-16 08:43:00,393,"Well I have seen camps that give discounts to senior citizens, 40 is getting close.lolol I did not think about 18 year olds wanting their own boats etc. I imagine they are a bit rough on the equipment. Where does it end is probably the best point. Thanks again for the clarification."
1449447,tooski,2012-06-14 17:25:00,393,PhishphearBrowns brought up a good point on weight not long ago. How arbitrary is #100 per man when each persons weight is so variable? Some outfitters are now saying #300 total person and gear which makes more sense. My question is why do they offer such a huge discount for kids under 16? I have seen it as high as $300 difference. Why? Maybe there family is different then mine but my kids were MUCH more destructive at 15 then they are now when in there 20's. I don't get it.
1449450,nemusky,2012-06-14 17:37:00,60,It makes it more feasible for families to afford the vacation.
1449456,Slushfish,2012-06-14 17:57:00,263,"NEMUSKY Is right. Our guys trip costs $2400. Split four ways equals $600 apiece. Our family trip costs $2400 split one way equals $2400. Much more expensive. Outfitters know if all the cash is coming out of the same pocket, it hurts alot more. Bottom line is, they need to book as many guests as possible. Slushfish"
1449461,tooski,2012-06-14 18:08:00,393,So now that my sons are in their 20's they are no longer family? If they truly needed more bookings they could extend the family criteria. Why does it cost more to fly in a 20 year old.
1449472,Mike Borger,2012-06-14 18:37:00,1554,Exposing young kids to fishing and the outdoors is always a good thing and I suspect many outfitters feel the same way Joe.I'd imagine many young families would find it impossible to bring their kids along if they were paying full shot.
1449484,adempsey,2012-06-14 18:59:00,963,Typically the parents don't pay for their 20 year old kids vacation. It's all about affordability.
1449490,tooski,2012-06-14 19:07:00,393,"Apparently I did not make myself clear. I am not opposed to the practice at all. I have been taking my sons since the youngest was 6. I think it is more than great. I just don't get the financial end. Perhaps Solo is right in that many outfitters simply bite the bullet to encourage family trips. I know Parks did for us this year. At any rate thanks for the replies, I guess it is a bit clearer now....."
1449499,v-bay gord,2012-06-14 19:32:00,3168,"The bottom line is the outfitter deserves to make a living too....but, I agree, it would be nice if everything was free"
1449526,BrianinVA,2012-06-14 20:46:00,160,"A lot of the family package deals I see are for slower fishing periods, typically in August, when there is a greater chance the cabins being vacant without some sort of incentive. A family with kids under 16 will only require 1 boat between them. I don't think you and 3 buddies are going to jam into a 15 foot boat and go fishing for a week. Chances are, a family will also probably be on the water less and consume less fuel and put less wear and tear on the boats and motors."
1449571,Guest,2012-06-15 05:46:00,0,If it means giving a discount to get a youngster hooked on fishing at a earily age is an investment for the future. They'll want to return as an adult when the outfitter can make up for the discount. The younger generation is the future income of all outfitters who plan on staying in the buissness.
