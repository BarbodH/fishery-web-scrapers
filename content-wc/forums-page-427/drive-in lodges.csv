1446681,hoppy63,2012-06-08 13:15:00,367,"Ok help me out. What is name of place, and location?"
1446698,ILBassman,2012-06-08 13:47:00,16,"we did most of our fishing in the Bray Lake (sp), most of the time we were in 8-10 feet of water with jig head and minnows, looking for banks with the wind blowing in, for the walleyes, biggest walleye was 29 in. we did throw a gulp for a while and had good success with that as well. Not a lot of luck trolling."
1446700,ILBassman,2012-06-08 13:50:00,16,"the web site where we went is sww-lodge.com (Silver Water Wheel Lodge). They are north of Dryden. It took us about an hour and fifteen minutes from Dryden, they are on Lac Seul. If you have any questions would be happy to try and help."
1447087,hoppy63,2012-06-09 21:42:00,367,Guess i need to look west! Im sure there must be good places with good numbere of eyes on the east part of ont. Hope ing someone has more info
1447096,adempsey,2012-06-09 22:22:00,963,I think Lady Evelyn can be fairly productive as far as drive-to/boat-to lodges go.
1447180,Jigger1,2012-06-10 08:12:00,234,"Bassman Â– nice getting a 29 on the first trip! I'm 17 days out this morning and going stir crazy with anticipation. Amazing after 12 years at SWWL, I still feel this way. I actually think it gets more intense because I know what I'm getting myself in to."
1447194,ILBassman,2012-06-10 08:43:00,16,"this was my first trip up and it was amazing. the scenary, the service and the fishing were all outstanding. I understand why you have been up so many times. I have started planning on bringing up my wife and daughter next year.Do you go in late June early July all the time?"
1447276,Jigger1,2012-06-10 12:15:00,234,"I've been up as early as June 9th and as late as September 2nd. My favorite time slot remains the one I've basically held for 11 of 13 years and that's coming up in 17 days. Seems to consistently produce a wonderful combo of volume and top end size. The active bite is usually in less than 20' at this time of year. However I'm really starting to enjoy fishing in late August/early September, mainly fish 25-35' feet so it really refines my touch in deeper water."
1449018,ILBassman,2012-06-13 20:07:00,16,good luck on your trip this year! maybe we will run into you next year as i am going to try and plan for later in the year.
1449138,bode,2012-06-14 06:33:00,39,"If walleye is your target(pretty good northerns too), I'd suggest Caribou Lake near Armstrong. Started fishing Canada in 1977 camping and portaging, went to fly-ins, got expensive after 911, and now do the drive to.We use Caribou Lake Lodge, plain, simple, and cheap. Two other lodges on the lake--lots of water to fish."
1444204,jimmie,2012-06-03 11:41:00,123,"Anderson's is one of the finest lodges around. It is on highway 72 just south of SL. It is on Abrahams Lake which can access Pelican, and Minnitaki. Also Lac Seul! The finest walleye Lake you could ask for. All lakes have 'eyes, musky, smallmouth bass, and perch. Minnitaki has lakers too. Of course the Great Northern Pike is in abundance and with size. If you'd like to try other bodies of water nearby then you can trek a few miles too Big Vermillion and Lost about 15 minutes away. Little Vermillion to the South about 6 miles inside the Ojibway Provincial Park has a decent land and parking area and great smallie fishing. Attached to Musky Lake, Hooch and Cloudlet Lakes that have NP, smallies of great size and pof course a few Musky as well. Those lakes are barbless (pinched down) (one treble pinched equals one hook as that is all you are allowed and catch and release Musky lakes attached to 'lil V). If it's guides or boats on most of the lakes that I have listed then Anderson's your place.. Jackie and Jodi will be gracious hosts as they have been for me for years. If you get an itch for a short fly in trip then they have that available right from their dock via float plane. Contact them for a flyer . . .http://www.andersonslodge.com/ They have AP and Housekeeping plans. Nice cabins more like townhouses in most cases than older 30's/40's cabins but nice enough to be included in the rustic sense just clean and modern. If you like to bring your own boat there are ramps on most of the lakes that give access to untold adventures for you and/or your family. I now stay at the Lamplighter Motel just outside of Sioux Lookout that includes small fidge, microwave, Tv, phone in a very central location to all lakes. Anderson's also has one of the finest restaurants in the area for breakfast and dinner. The motel has breakfast and lunch in dinning room. $72 for one inc tax! Good luck there are more lakes than people in NW Ontario! Unfortunately we will not live long ebnough to fish even 1/10th of 1% in our lifetime. Jim"
1444590,Dodger31,2012-06-04 10:24:00,18,"You have to throw in Lake of the Woods for a good drive-to option.Large body of water that takes some time to learn. Average size of walleye is awesome, bonus perch and northern and occasional trophy muskie. All of that for about $700. You can't beat that IMO.We stay at Red Wing Lodge just outside Morson. (only 40 miles north of Baudette)."
1445568,hoppy63,2012-06-06 08:12:00,367,"Kind of looking in the sudbury, thessalon, whitefish falls, iron bridge area.anyone have any experiences, good or bad at any lodges in these areas? Thanks for any input"
1445588,phishfearme,2012-06-06 08:47:00,1242,"with a qualifier i would look into ray's camps NW of sudbury on ramsey lake. the qualifier is that, although we did 12 trips there after ray cripps opened it in the 70's and 80's, we've not been there in 20 years. but there's quite a few posts on this site - do a search. it was just sold recently and the previous owners did nothing to make guests feel comfortable. i think the new owners have to be better. they offer a full meal plan where they provide the food and you cook. you drive to bisco (or take a train) then a barge across bisco lake to portage up to boats on ramsey. this is worth a look. phish"
1445623,hoppy63,2012-06-06 09:47:00,367,What do you mean by qualifier?
1445627,phishfearme,2012-06-06 09:52:00,1242,we've not been there in over 20 years!!
1445650,adempsey,2012-06-06 10:43:00,963,"Where are you coming from? I know some places in the east, but I would definitely head west if it's the same traveling distance.I heard good things about Brennan Harbour Resort. There are a couple more resorts up the Spanish river from there too.There's also Five Mile Lake Lodge. They have some drive to outpost camps as well that I have on my ""to visit"" list. If you don't want to fly but want that same outpost trip, this is as close as it gets.If you like to trailer up a boat and try out different lakes all week, Moosehorn Lodge might be an option as well.Plenty others in Chapleau area."
1446090,hoppy63,2012-06-07 08:07:00,367,Comming from toledo ohio. Not averse to driving farther but just looking nearer first. Would love to do another fly in but getting the crew together is the hard part!
1446584,ILBassman,2012-06-08 09:14:00,16,we just got back from a drive. we stayed at SWWL and had a great time. the service and fishing was great. I couldnt find anything i would have changed.
1446666,dan cardinal,2012-06-08 12:30:00,64,"ILBassman....when you get rested up, would love to hear more how you did, tactics, depths, general locations. Glad you had a good trip. Fantastic place...isn't it!"
1443674,hoppy63,2012-06-01 17:40:00,367,"did first fly-in last year and loved it. dont think i can get a crew to go again anytime soon. looking for some input on drive-in lodges. flew out of nakina last year, had a great time with AWO. looking for good fishing, fair prices, etc.... thanks for any replies."
1443690,Bill Krejca,2012-06-01 18:25:00,6107,"Instead of turning right to Nakina, turn left and go to O'Sullivan's Rainbow on O'Sullivan Lake. you won't be disappointed. Bill Krejca"
1443692,SinOrSwim,2012-06-01 18:37:00,1528,We had been doing fly-ins for 15+ years and got to the point we were having trouble finding people. Went to Onaway Lodge on Lac Seul last year which was our first drive in camp. Loved it! Probably 1/2 the cost at most and facilities couldn't have been nicer.
1443705,NARDA 1,2012-06-01 19:10:00,636,"check out www.birchdalelodge.com great drive-in lodge. great fishing for walleye, northern, smallmouth, lake trout, musky and perch. grill your own steakhouse at the lodge. Give Cheryl or Marcel a call at 807-227-5262 they will take great care of you."
1443706,wallydave,2012-06-01 19:12:00,2151,"Plenty of drive-in lodges and camps in Ontario! Drive-ins offer some flexibility that a fly-in can't. You won't have to worry about weight limits, if your close to town, you can go get some supplies, or a bite to eat. The boats can be better than some fly-ins. Lac Seul has plenty of drive-ins to choose from. Our group likes Goose Bay www.lacseul.comThe cabins, docks and go with the upgrade boats, all make for a good trip. Stay tuned for more replies, or google drive-in camps and have some fun surfing the web!! Good luck in your search!"
1443723,Hawkfan,2012-06-01 19:57:00,237,"Onaway is the only drive in camp I have ever been to as well and it is a great camp. I have a feeling though, the toughest part of your search will be to narrow it down to one camp. Plenty of quality operations out there."
1443734,hoppy63,2012-06-01 20:37:00,367,"Thanks for replies! Keep em coming. Any info on Brennan Harbour resort? Live in nw ohio, would like to stay at around a 10 hour drive to have better chance of convincing older(74) yr old partner to make the trip"
1443803,hoppy63,2012-06-02 07:05:00,367,anyone have any info on this outfit
1443820,Rich B,2012-06-02 07:44:00,1081,Sent you a PM....
1444182,Dogbreath,2012-06-03 10:00:00,494,Been going to Donnelly's on Minitaki up in Sour Outlook for abt 4-5 years now - great folks and lots of 24 inch walleye.http://www.minnitakilake.ca/
