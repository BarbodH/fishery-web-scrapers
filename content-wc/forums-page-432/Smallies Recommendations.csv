Frankly I finally tired of drowning minnows waiting for the walleyes to get in the mood to strike. I'm too type A. Once I started going after smallmouth, I've never had so much fun. Al Lindner admitted the same - after 60 years of fishing, his favorite fish is the smallmouth. Can't eat 'em but you can't beat catching them either."
1443139,Guest,2012-05-31 11:25:00,0,"i dont ever eat bass, im from central wisconsin and live on a lake where all we have is largemouth and they are mushy and soft. the river is full of smallies, but its the river by the mills so i dont eat those either. that philosphy followed me up to canada where we only eat walleyes and lake trout. as for fishing for smallies, we use topwater mostly, as has already been said. heddon torpedos and the new rapala x rap prop(smithwick copy)are killer baits. i also use tube jigs, anything crayfish colored, so reds, oranges/browns/olives. for catching smallies, target the same structure you would for walleyes. ive found less smallies on mid lake humps/reefs and more of them on flats with basketball size rocks around points. they sure fight nice and are exciting fish to catch. if you are in a place where its barbless hooks only and you fish topwater, be ready to jam your rod deep into the water to avoid that secondary jump that tends to fling hooks."
1443211,10point,2012-05-31 13:31:00,102,Those Canadian shield lake smallmouths seem to taste just fine to me.
1444273,jimmie,2012-06-03 15:54:00,123,In most cases smallies are more rare and a great freshwater sport fish! It depends upon forage whether the walleye compete with smallies for food. If there are enough crayfish the smallies will leave anything concerning 'eyes pretty much alone. If you think that old addage that some need to be kept to keep thing in balance I'd ask one to consider that if the smallie had not been introduced to most lakes earlier in the last century would not mother nature take care of things. Only man ruins anything in nature to make it out of balance! the truth be told the reason that fish should be harvested is that most dies of old age. mmmm just like us. Have a great summer everyone.
1444388,keek,2012-06-03 19:52:00,1003,Rapala skitter pop in firetiger is a very good surface lure. Rapala JSR 5 in silver as well as the Bomber Long A are great crankbaits
1444695,Guest,2012-06-04 13:53:00,0,"I've been going to NW Ontario [LOTW and Minaki] for over 3 decades now (about 3 weeks a year), and fish almost exclusively for smallmouth -- unless we get tired from beating the banks. My #1 bait is a green pumpkin 3-1/2"" or 4"" tube, with a 3/16 to 5/16 oz tube jig head inside. You can fish them anywhere from 16' to 4' or so. If the smallies are really shallow, I'll use a 4 or 5"" caffeine shad on a 5/0 hook or a Zoom Lil' Crit on a 2/0 hook, with a 1/32 to 1/16 bullet sinker pegged right at the eye of the hook. Either of these are deadly in 6"" to 4' of water, and they both go through the weeds amazingly well. I stay with green pumpkin colors in both. Most of the time we use these inside the weed line -- the boat is in 18"" of water or less and we are casting them right up to where the water meets the bank! I've caught many 18-22"" smallies each year in 6"" to 1' of water on Crits, and what a blast! [Most don't even know they are there and don't work the inside weed line.] Of course a #3 gold or copper plain-hook Mepps (no dressed tail), Stanley 1/8 oz Titanium Baby Wedge spinner bait (baby bass colored skirt), or a 1/8-1/4 oz perch colored Chatter Bait will work when it gets a bit windy. They can also be used as a search bait to pattern smallmouth in shallower areas. For crankbaits we'll go with a #7 to #9 crawdad, shad or perch colored Shad Raps, primarily on the outer weed edges, or even troll them along a rocky shoreline. I'll use these a lot the first day or so to pattern the smallmouth in various areas; they make a good search bait because they can be worked from 4' to 12' or so, depending on the size you use and how fast you retrieve them. I use a 1/4 oz Baby Bass colored Rebel Pop-R or a 1/4 oz frog colored Tiny Torpedo for topwater most of the time. When the bass are hitting topwater it's too hard to resist not fishing for them that way -- we laugh a lot too!"
1444856,Kevin R,2012-06-04 20:09:00,305,I eat Smallmouths we even make Smallmouth chowder. I never take Pike to me they have been over exploited for to many years they need to be protected from harvest on some lakes.
1444987,oldschooltiller,2012-06-05 06:28:00,515,"I'm going to send a link to you in a PM.It's something your boat is already setup for, and likely have equipment for it that will work perfectly."
1445235,Leeches,2012-06-05 13:59:00,106,We have eaten probably two smallmouth in 6 years and they tasted ok from a cold deep lake in canada.I don't understand why people eating a smallmouth once in while is a problem compared to limit after limit of walleye being cut up every year. Educate me please do smallmouths have problems spawning or establishing themselves? Not saying I'm just saying.
1440722,NEpiker,2012-05-25 15:49:00,9,Normally we are in Canada well ahead of prespawn activity of smallies. We do pick up a few incidental to fishing for pike and walleye. I am thinking this might be a good year for smallies with the early ice out and warmer water temps. What do you guys think? What are some recommendations on best baits to use for smallies and where would you focus given the conditions this year? I will be on Lac Seul for 6 days beginning next Wednesday.
1440738,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-05-25 17:28:00,84,"Topwater is definitely the most fun. We will be on LOW starting the 8th. We always focus on the topwater bite unless it's not happening. If the topwater isn't on we will go to spinnerbaits, tubes, worms and maybe some hard baits."
1440807,Terwalleye,2012-05-25 21:49:00,166,"It can be crazy how many Smallies can be caught fihsing rocky points for walleyes with a jig. Nice thing about leeches or Gulp, they are so multi species."
1440813,RapShad,2012-05-25 22:12:00,76,"Nothing beats a silver or bronze Mepps #3 or 4. If they are still on their beds you can have some of the most fun you have ever had fishing. Catch and release though, I've seen amazing Smallie populations completely wrecked by taking Smallmouths while they are spawning."
1440814,Terwalleye,2012-05-25 22:21:00,166,"Brings up A good question I have always wondered. I have seen countless pictures on Resort webistes of all their guests pics. Lots of them in the fish cleaning house. And there in the sink are a couple of small mouth. I just don't get it. Infinite walleye and perch. I am afraid if the minimuim length on Musky wan't 54"" some guy would be filleting up a 45""."
1440817,RapShad,2012-05-25 22:40:00,76,"I've never understood taking Smallies either. Walleye and Northerns are some of the best tasting fish on the planet and people will take a Smallie. Plus some of the lakes in NW Ontario have Smallies that have a parasite in them that completely ruins the meat. Moral of the story catch and release smallies. They're way too much fun to keep, plus kids absolutely love fishing for them."
1440851,TroyMansfield,2012-05-26 06:16:00,92,"in some parts in Northwest Ontario, the smallies are not natural to the waters, and the MNR have done studies showing that the smallies compete with the walleyes and have an impact on the walleye populations, and the MNR are promotoing outifitters and there guests to start keeping more of them, I agree not to take them while spawning, thats not proper, but I dont mind frying up smallies, the limit is 5 during the open season. Truth is that most people do catch and release on smallies, and I believe there has to be a harvest of some sort to keep it maintained and balanced. I dont target bass to get my limit, mostly for fun."
1440860,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-26 06:46:00,235,"I catch and release bass, but I can't fault someone who likes to eat them. Especially out of pristine Canadian waters with robust populations. Why is it OK to keep walleyes and pike but not smallmouth?"
1440901,@Lunker,2012-05-26 08:29:00,835,"My fav's for smallies are occasionally a #5 Mepps (I hate treble hooks), but especially a jig and plastics. RE the harvest of smallies...... I've never killed a bass of any species, nor will I allow it in my boat. and I LOVE fishing them. For some reason I just consider them more of a ""sport"" fish (and I'm not even sure what I mean by that). That's just me. As far as encouraging harvest to reduce competition with walleyes? Give me a break !! With the majority of fishermen targeting walleyes, and all the hundreds of thousands harvested annually, we don't put a DENT in that population. And we expect to by harvesting a few bass? Interesting though......I've heard comments from both sides. Some say they're delish, and others say they don't taste good."
1441888,Guest,2012-05-29 06:50:00,0,"I love fishing for smallmouths, actually it's about 70-80 percent of the fishing on our Canadian trip. The population issues on s-mouth is a good question, I just hope it remains the same for several years. As for eating s-mouths (in my opinion) would be like taking a bologna sandwich to a fine steak house. But that is just me too each his own."
