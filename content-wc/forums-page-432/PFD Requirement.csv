""Please note that it is required by law to wear a life jacket at all times while on the water. We ask that guests bring their own life jacket."" I heading up later this summer and if this is correct I'm going to get a more comfortable PFD."

The home page for the Office of Boating Safety is: http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety...-menu-1362.htm""Pleasure craft must have a Canadian approved device of the appropriate size for each person on board. You can choose between lifejackets and PFDs depending on your boating activity. """"The most important safety practice is the wearing of a lifejacket or personal flotation device (PFD). Depending on the nature of your boating activity, you can choose between the greater protection of a full lifejacket and the specialized comfort of a PFD. Recent advances in technology and design have produced a range of styles, colours, and performance options. There must be a Canadian approved lifejacket or PFD of the appropriate size for everyone on board. It is strongly recommended that a lifejacket or PFD be worn at all times, particularly in smaller boats. Learn more about cold water and the necessity of wearing a lifejacket in Key Safety Information. Almost 90% of the 180 Canadians (on average) who die every year in boating incidents were not properly wearing a lifejacket or PFD. Nearly 70% capsized or fell overboard from a small open boat. (2006/07 Canadian Red Cross 10-Year Drowning Report)"" I read this to mean that wearing a PFD at all times is strongly recommended, but not required. The boat must have an approved flotation device for each person, and cushions do not fill this requirement. I didn't specifically look it up now, but my recollection is that for us visitors, a PFD bearing U.S. Coast Guard approval is o.k. I must admit I haven't always had mine on when in the boat, but if boating/fishing alone I never take it off."

Our always wear our pfd while under power.We are on the water most of the day, so finding gear that's comfortable is pretty inportant! Check with the sporting goods retailers in your area, find a pfd you like and hopefully never have to use it!!!"
1444177,bigdaddyguns,2012-06-03 09:38:00,608,"Also when under power, if your boat is equipped with the emergency kill switch be sure to use it. What good is it to be saved by a PFD only to be ""done in"" by your boat under power."
