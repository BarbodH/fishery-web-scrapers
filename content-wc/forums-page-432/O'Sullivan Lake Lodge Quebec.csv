1444464,4Paulie7,2012-06-04 04:16:00,30,"We go up twice a year. I first fished there in 1980 and have been returning ever since. Lots of walleye. Trophy sized fish are available. Have seen many 10+ lb. fish. Biggest catch and release was 16 lbs caught by a beginner back in '90s. Currently there is a slot. Keepers between (approx.) 15"" and 22"" only. Pike are big. Each member of our group has at least one 20+ lb fish. Tons in the 10-15 lb range. Lakers are under fished. 30lb slobs have been caught. We usually manage a day or two fishing lakers and rarely are disappointed. Depending on time of year we'll either flatline or troll dipsies. Walleye will succumb to all methods (trolling sticks, trolling harnesses, jigging with crawler). Pike are caught trolling plugs, spoons and spinners or casting the usual lures (plugs, spoons, spinners, topwater). Big lake, lots of structure, bays in which to avoid nasty weather. Accommodations are comfortable. Indoor facilities, hot water, oil furnace. The ride up the Clova can be challenging but we haven't had a problem in 32 years that couldn't be managed. Let common sense previal. Lately, a lot of fisherman have dragged their boats to camp. The thought has never entered my mind but if you do, upgrade trailer springs, axle and an extra spare should be considered and add at least 1-2 hours to Clova travel time."

Our last trip was in 07. and the weather was extremly hot. making our numbers down. but my son caught a 32"" walleye which made up for the slow fishing... When are you going? I will post a report when I return.."
