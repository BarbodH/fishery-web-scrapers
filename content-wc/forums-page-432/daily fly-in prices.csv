That ""dead sea"" supports 4 or 5 lodges year in and year out. I have been to quite a few lakes all over NW Ontario, and the fishing in Perrault Falls doesn't take a back seat to any area. Sure, there are better, walleye lakes, pike lakes, small mouth lakes etc.., but for multi-species fishing, you will have a hard time finding better water. And, the sheer beauty of the Perrault Falls area is second to none."
1444396,Glenman12,2012-06-03 20:07:00,762,Like I said in my post Ive never fished Perrault Lake itself..went up to Spadina and did well and several times have gone up the Ord to Lake St Clair which is a numbers lake but not size.. btw..what do they have in Jackfish Bay...some of the guys are talking about doing a day trip there from Cedar..the name makes me think of hammer handle pike..
1444799,elkman99,2012-06-04 17:33:00,180,"I've never went back in there off of Perrault, but I have heard of guys doing good on decent pike and nice walleye."
1444809,Terwalleye,2012-06-04 18:10:00,166,"Actually he has a couple of boats sitting on the shore of Puzzle Bay onOrd Lake. That's gonna be our ""adventure"" this year. Zero $. Hope we get some of the numbers we did on the fly in; but it will be awesome either way. Plus if it aint working out we can leave when we want. AND if it is working out we can stay as long as we want. It was truly hear breaking as plane came back to pick us up at 4 PM and we still had 5 hours of sunlight left."
1444811,Terwalleye,2012-06-04 18:14:00,166,"Oh wait I do; I haNice anonymous post by a guest. Gee, wonder if he has a score to settle with the Clarks. Going back to one of their resorts for the 3rd year in a row and can not wait to have one of the top 3 fishing weeks of my life. Glad I don't better. Oh, wait, I do. I have been organizing fishing trips for over 25 years."
1444840,Kevin R,2012-06-04 19:43:00,305,"You are correct Perrault has been known as the dead sea by locals. I think it came about from the fishing being so great when Manotak Lodge opened in 1945 until the 1970's when a major weed bed changed & now no longer exists. A lot of knowledge of the area by locals led to many of these lakes being commercial fished this along with other things took a toll on the fishing. I dont think protection of the Ord river was a popular thing but at one time boats lined up the river to slay the fish. People didn't conserve resources they exploited them & moved on. The introduction of Smallmouth bass didnt help things. I had to relearn how to fish Perrault lake it became more challenging in the 1980's the issue with weeds has me baffled each new season the weeds get thinner. The one thing you will notice with Perrault is that it is loaded with birds that eat fish I have seen thousands in a day working the lake they wouldn't be there if no fish, they fish for living they know how to catch them. I have seen loons with pike & walleye. I do fine I think some lakes are better but if you want a shot at big Walleye or Pike it is among the best in the area."
1443865,elkman99,2012-06-02 10:15:00,180,"I will be in the Perrault Falls area (Clarks Northern Lights) the first week of August. Generally, how much do daily fly-in trips cost if we want to go to an outlying lake for one day? Also, what lakes would you suggest for a day trip? Thanks for any help!"
1443868,Terwalleye,2012-06-02 10:34:00,166,"We stay at the same place and the past two years have hire Wilderness Air to do a 1 day fly in. It was like $250 per guy. That was them landing on Cedar Lake and then doing the 1 day deal. We did Boot Lake and Lake No.1 Lake No.1 had good numbers and really nice sized eyes. All of us caught at least one over 25"". Boot was a numbers game. 3 guys in one boat and we counted over 250 walleyes alone. It aint cheap but what a rockstar way to go fishing."
1443931,elkman99,2012-06-02 14:28:00,180,"wow, the price has really gone up since we paid about $90 per person in 1995"
1444097,Skywagon,2012-06-03 04:46:00,1106,"The price of flying has increased along with the cost of AV gas (Beaver, 30 gallons an hour), multiple landings/take offs from Vermillion Bay, Perrault lake to Lake # 1 then back again (all the takeoffs use even more gallons per hour). Just out of curiosity, I wonder what % the cost of transportation has increased for your 2012 trip to Canada, compared to your trip up here in 1995, price of gas, replacing tires, repairs, cost of vehicle. Costs have really gone up, don't think wages have followed, a sad fact."
1444140,phishfearme,2012-06-03 07:43:00,1242,"faron buckler (excellent adventures in ear falls) has a number of one day, boat cache lakes that he offers to people - we went to rainfall lake and it was indeed ""fishing as it used to be"" as faron calls it. a friend of mine also went to zinzania lake and also had a field day. contact him - info on his web site. phish"
1444152,Glenman12,2012-06-03 08:14:00,762,I remember back in the 80's it was $75..last I looked at the rate sheet in our lodge owners office it was $175 or so..guess I havent looked at the rate sheet in a while.. You should see if your lodge owner has a boat stached over on Cliff Lake or maybe trailer one of his boats or yours over there and fish for lake trout..we are going up to Cedar this year two days early to do just that..
1444168,elkman99,2012-06-03 09:14:00,180,"We have actually fished Cliff in the past and might this year, though we fish it for musky. We bring our own boats, so we just trailer our boats over across the street. We are bringing my uncle up for his first Canadian voyage, and my cousin was wanting to surprise him and take him on a fly-in for a day and catch so many walleyes his arm hurts lol. When we did this back in 1995, we went to Zizania."
1444253,Weby13,2012-06-03 14:57:00,57,I have been to both Zinzania and Rainfall Lakes with Excellent Adventures. Rainfall has alot huge Northerns and big Walleye. Zinzania has numbers for Walleye and we caught some decent sized Northern. We were there in 2008 and 2009. I think he cahrged us around $180 per person and we had 6 and 8 guys.
1444304,Guest,2012-06-03 17:31:00,0,"Well if you are fishing the perrault area and any of clarks camps you will want to do a fly out. The ""dead sea"" as the locals call it up there is slow and if anybody say or thinks it is good fishin doesnt know any different. We fly out of woman river fly outs. 1 day used be 150.00 but was well worth it. has alot of lake..wapesi, twain, zania and some others."
1444338,Glenman12,2012-06-03 18:26:00,762,"Sounds to me like you have more of a beef with Clarks Camps than you do with lakes in the Perrault area..yeah, Ive read, especially on here where Perrault Lake itself has been called the ""dead sea""..dont know, never fished it even though its connects with Cedar Lake which I have fished for almost 30 years..yeah we might have a lean year here and there but the majority of time we slay the walleyes and smallies..one of the newer guys in our group fishes muskies..in his 8 years of going up he has caught 5 that were 50"" or bigger..one year we went to Wabaskang and Wine Lake..they were both great and are in the Perrault area..now if you only meant Perrault Lake then I apologize..but if you meant all the lakes in the Perrault area then youre the one that doesnt know any different.."
