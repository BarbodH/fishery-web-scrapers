1444270,@Lunker,2012-06-03 15:45:00,835,"I've always thought about having a contest where everyone has to use a Snoopy pole (or some similar such thing). Just buy one, or maybe two depending on how many guys in the group. Each person gets to use it for a certain period of time - half day, two hours, etc. Biggest fish caught in predetermined categories win. For fairness sake, it should be spooled with line equitably for each person.RE pikeman's ideas....we've done the same thing too. Get however many boats within proximity of each other (obviously has to be a location big enough and mutuall agreed upon) and total walleyes within the predetermined length of time wins. Side rule......rock bass count -2 points. Another way to do it would be for each boat to pick a location - again, has to be large enough for all boats - and ""x"" minutes is spent in each location and then it's on to the next."

Maybe if the group I was up with was more than just two of us this'd be more fun...."
1444610,labsrus,2012-06-04 11:04:00,557,"Our group has done the dollar for the largest fish routine for a few years Last year we did a contest where two pike would be measured for length to be counted each day. Trick was to count the biggest 2 for the day. You had to call the measurement befor e the fist was put back in water. We fish a lake that has a lot of 25 to 30 inch pike in it. Once in a while we would get one over 30 inches. If you already counted 2 fish and had a total of 2 fish at 25 inches each, your total for that day was 50 inches. If you caught a 30 incher then you were out of luck counting that one for the tournament. We had some guys who caught one fish at 28 and was hoping to get another larger one come in with only on counting for the day. About half way thru the week last year one of our guys got mad and started another tournament where the best two fish each day were counted."
1443958,Jaskonie,2012-06-02 15:46:00,80,"Looking for some fresh ideas we normally put a few bucks in a guy for the usual biggest keeper and most keepers on alternate days, this year we have over 20 guys and some lil guys with us. One idea I have is a survivor pool, whoever wants in puts in the ante and if you fail to bring back a keeper that session your out. Last man standing wins. Also could start the inches at 15 and move up a few inches every day. We normally do 2 sessions a day Morning till Lunch then the rest of the day till last boat in. Just some thoughts."
1444023,Mike Kansas,2012-06-02 19:16:00,1463,"We have had trophies for the biggest Walleye, Pike and Smallie caught on the trip for about the last 15 years. It makes for some good conservation and bragging rights over the winter. Mike Kansas"
1444036,green&orange,2012-06-02 19:54:00,28,"We have the ""Lure Challenge"". You can only fish with one crankbait for 1/2 hour. The crankbait must be named prior to the trip. It is held in the middle of the day or during non peak fishing times. Usually the crankbaits chosen are done so because of a ""cool name"" or is a vintage lure we bought when we were 12 that has sat unused in our tackle box for the past 20 years. We have a scoring system based on the legal size of the fish (we use Michigan size limits for the challenge because it is easier for us) and the number of inches over the minimum size. Also have bonuses for ""trophy quality"" fish and penalties for catching undersized fish or ""undesireables"". Highest score wins and the winner gets to ""talk sh*t"" the rest of the year. There is also a fair amount of drinking involved that I probably shouldn't get into on here..."
1444042,Glenman12,2012-06-02 20:16:00,762,"we just ante $5 each for the biggest walleye, smallie and northern and then the biggest fish..this year we are going up for the musky opener so it could get interesting we also have what we call the ""boner award""..this goes to the whoever does the dumbest thing while in camp or out on the water..the award is an ugly purple and yellow spoon on a lanyard that you have to wear around your next all the time til someone else does something dumber.."
1444051,SteveJ715,2012-06-02 20:43:00,59,"I'm liking the trophy idea - one for biggest walleye, northern and, in our case, laker. I also like the idea of each guy throwing in a couple bucks. And the ""boner award""? Classic. (You might speak with the folks at Trojan and see if you can get it sponsored!)I was thinking of a sort of traveling trophy, one of those that has a bunch of blank plates on it and then you get it engraved each year with ""Mike S., 29"" Walleye, 2012"" or whatever. Then the guy who wins gets to keep the trophy and bring it back the following year. This idea isn't perfect -- I don't know if it makes sense to do three separate trophies with all those names, or just one for the biggest fish. Good thing we have 16 hours in the car to work it all out!Thanks for sharing your ideas. I'd love to hear some more.- Steve"

1444075,nd89sc88,2012-06-02 22:00:00,92,"Ours is always the same each day, $1 each: for first, most and biggest. Where it gets interesting is the verbal battles over what constitutes biggest. We deliberately don't differentiate between species. So is a 26"" walleye ""bigger"" than a 31"" northern? How about a 20"" smallie? Makes for interesting discussions. My dad and I are both attorneys, so we probably enjoy the discussion more than most! LOL! Bill"
1444143,pikeman14,2012-06-03 08:02:00,144,"We also have a trophy made for biggest pike, walleye, and smallmouth. When we find a honey hole, we have a boat challenge....5 minutes to see which boat can catch the most walleye. Fish must be in the boat, no nets. Loser has to do dishes.My favorite ritual is the winner of biggest fish of the week gets to pick 1 lure out of everyone's tackle box as a prize. This always brings great conversation, and a little turmoil to the guy who has been talking about a lure all week long. When he sees it go, theres a short moment of silence with laughing in the background. It's funny how opening up your tackle box makes you feel somewhat vulnerable."
1444237,NARDA 1,2012-06-03 14:13:00,636,"We have what we call our ""Top Fisherman Award"". We have a dry erase board on which each person records their biggest (by length) walleye, northern and smallmouth. These entries are totaled to come up with a final score. Highest total score wins. The winner then adds their name to a plaque that stays at the lodge. We each ante $20 and winner takes all. We also have plaques that are awarded for the largest fish of each species."
1444260,bigwalleye1,2012-06-03 15:09:00,2632,"I'm working on an idea for this year. Going to start a jar. 4 guys, we always go together, $25/man buy in each year. Big fish for the trip gets $70, the remainder goes for seed money. Drop your rod in the lake $10 fine. FALL out of the boat into the lake $20 fine for polluting the lake. Too drunk to fish $20 fine. Forgot your rainsuit and need it $10 fine. When someone takes a big walleye, (30 in plus) they get the $ in the jar, or $300 from the jar, whichever is less. Kind of a little reward if you want a skin mount or a replica, and we all have a chance to win something every year, as well as the big prize. Also looking for more ideas for ""fines"" as a way to boost the pot further."
