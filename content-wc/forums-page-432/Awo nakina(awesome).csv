WE HAD MOTOR TROUBLES AND THE OWNERS CAME IN NEXT DAY, FIXED EVERYTHING AND CUT MORE WOOD FOR US. THIS IS THE SECOND TRIP IN 2 YEARS TO THIS LAKE. IT IS A VERY SAFE, AND NON ROCKY LAKE TO NAVIGATE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD HIGH FISH LAKE, REMI AND CHRISTINE DO A GREAT JOB. I WILL BE RETURNING."

1444458,GOBIG,2012-06-04 02:15:00,126,"Down from last year. We caught more small ones this year. We did manage 39,38,37,34's, and several around 30. I think the big boys were off due to all the water. Water was really high. Last year, the walleye were all in the river, so we caught several over 35 inches. It was a great week, minus the snow..."
