I am 73 and don't want to be running all over the lake, does any one have any information that will help. We are going to be staying at Ernies cottages and I am taking my own boat. I have been looking at the map I bought and the eastern section looks good. Just want to catch some fish as I just don't have a lot of trips (left in the old body) Ha Haaa We have fished Canada for a number of years and have caught some nice ones, but this is out first trip to Dog Lake. Please send any helpful information you have. Thank You"
1440491,10point,2012-05-25 08:39:00,102,We went up last year and stayed at a private residence next to Ernies. We never went east. The guy we know was friends with Danny at the little bait shop before you turn over the tracks to go to Ernies. Danny suggested we just use 4 lb line for the walleye and it helped. We didn't catch any big ones and we only caught them the last 1 1/2 hours of light. It was real hot the day we were there. A lot of poeple like to head to coreshack bay from what I hear but we never made it that far. My Dad has a gas hog of a motor and doesn't like going real far. I used harnesses with leeches but my dad ended up doing better with just jigs and a minnow. If you can give me your email address I will send you a map with a coupld of areas marked that we caught walleye in.

1444503,osuangler,2012-06-04 07:03:00,10,"We just returned from Dog Lake on Saturday and we stayed at Camp Missanabie. Although this was a nice lodge, the lake is not productive enough for me (I will be going back to Lac Seul when i return to Canada).We caught fish but they were hard to find, and when we did find them, they were small. We had 3 boats on the water with 8 guys fishing. One boat targeted walleye, one boat targeted pike, and my boat targeted both.We caught most of our fish in Core Shack by tipping jigheads with minnows or worms. The popular colors were black, red & chartreuse. We tried trolling harnesses and crankbaits, but none were hit. We caught several pike in Core Shack as they were going after the walleye.We caught a few walleyes in Emily Bay. On our last day there, the lodge owner fished the mouth of Emily Bay and caught some big walleyes on chartreuse jigs and worms. Sort of upset me that they couldn't give me that kind of advice. My opinion is that the lodge owner wanted to be able to put the next set of fishermen on fish so he was prepping for them.Most of the other cabins were having trouble finding fish too. There was one cabin though (this was their 38th year returning to Dog Lake) that caught all kinds of fish, but they wouldn't tell us where (I thought that was wrong and pissed me off). The lodge owner didn't know either (or at least he wasn't divulging either). One of our guys did press this cabin on the location and they said Bay 57, but that was far away and we didn't trust their answer so we didn't follow it.We mainly fished around Christ Island, Garbage Bay, Emily Bay and Core Shack. We caught a trout on a red devil and we caught a burbot (poor man's lobster) so those were fun. The lake is gorgeous and the wildlife is great so you will enjoy the setting. I wish I could tell you more, but good luck and be safe."

I have learned the hard way...I devulge a secret spot to a buddy and the next thing you know he is there, his firends are there and thier firends are there....plus all the people there alert others to come and fish there and every one shows up. Dog Lake has lots of fish but you need to know what you are doing and finding them can be tricky. Its a huge lake. I leave in three days and I am pumped."
1444976,osuangler,2012-06-05 06:01:00,10,"Logan - I hear ya on local spots and I respect that, however, on a fishing vacation like that, I feel people should be more open. The typical vacationer is there to catch fish and only has a week to learn the lake and catch them. Most fish are released in Canada so there will always be fish to catch. Even on the last fishing day of the trip, that cabin was tightlipped......unbelievableBill - here is another idea, the ""guide"" who assisted the lodge owner is a resident of Missanabie and she actually cleans the cabins in between campers. Apparently she knows the like very very well. You should track her down somehow and see if you can get any tips from her. She found the walleye at Emily Bay easily so am sure she will be helpful."
1445212,FrankLeigh,2012-06-05 13:16:00,80,"Hey Bill,We were there last year and will go again, just not this year.As some others have said, Core Shack and Emily Bays are popular areas as well as around Rabbit Island, but those spots are a little far from Ernies ( depending on your boat ).There are threads on here for Dog Lake, that go back to 2000.
