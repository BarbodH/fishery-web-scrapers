The trip leaves Clova Quebec July 1 and gets back the 8th, The outfitter is Air Tamarac, the lake we are going to lake Hebert, one of the best lakes if not the best in northern Quebec. I have their brand new remote cabin, we cook all our own food,Lund boats with 20 hp mercs all the gas,I have one opening maybe we could make it two with an air matt. If interested contact me [email protected] or 860 402 3209 Ron You could be in for the fishing trip of a lifetime. Thanks"

1441683,3M TA3,2012-05-28 15:36:00,2846,Perhaps I'm looking at the wrong Lac Hebert. I see one in south central Quebec but not in the north. Lat and Long would be nice as well as approx costs. Thanks
1442359,octanehi5,2012-05-29 19:39:00,1104,"There could be a lake by that name there but this one is north of the Gouin Res witch is a very big lake I sent you North 49* 10'18"" west 75* 18'30"""

1443297,octanehi5,2012-05-31 17:18:00,1104,"Floatbow, There are two camps at the north end of the lake one sleeps 4 the other sleeps 6 I have an opening for one in the bigger camp You can look up Air Tamarac on the net check out the lake is Hebert the prices are listed you would fall under the price for six and we fly out of Clova their main plane base.
