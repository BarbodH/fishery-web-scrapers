1421407,severanger,2012-04-15 19:51:00,2,"Fishing should be really good. Fished down the road at Onaway lodge 10 plus years...head to McKenzie bay, warmest part of the lake. Worth the ride...broad lake and sunlight are a trip, lots of fish. South bay should start warming up... Caught plenty of fish and never left scout bay...enjoy."

We normally go late July or early August, so can't comment on what the fishing is like in June. The resort has nice cabins, boats & motors, bait & dock service, fish cleaning house and a nice BBQ for guests on Wednesday night on the deck over looking the bay. Owners Dan & Keith will take good care of you. It is located in protected Scout Bay. Good fishing in Scout Bay in case it is too windy or bad weather to go out to the bigger bays. Also, close to Bay of Islands and McKenzie Bay, which are good areas to fish. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to hire a guide the first day or so that you go out. The Guide will put you on the fish and type of bite and also show you the safe travel routes. There are LOTS of unmarked rock reefs. We primarily use minnows with jigs (1/4 & 3/4 oz) or spinner baits. Resort sells the Klass reflecto spinners, which do work well. Lac Seul is a FANTASTIC Walleye lake and you will not be dissappointed! 3 months to go and the count down is on to our trip back to LAC SEUL! RBF"

1444491,Guest,2012-06-04 06:15:00,0,"We'll be there the same week as you. We go the same time every year and the fishing has been great every time. We've caught walleyes up to 29"" and northern up to 45."" lots of great spots on this huge lake. Dan and Keith can give you excellent recommendations on where to fish and what to use. Never been disappointed."
1444654,Guest,2012-06-04 12:47:00,0,"I've been to Fisherman's Cove in late June about 5 times. Dan, Keith, resort and staff are all top notch. Yes, Lac Seul is as good as you have heard. For walleye - Bring a bunch of spinner rigs with ¼ oz. sinkers and jigs (again mostly ¼ oz.). You probably will be fishing in 12 fow of less. My guess is 8' even with warm spring. You can use plastics, minnows or crawlers. We mostly use minnows. Sounds like you have experience fishing the Canadian Shield (from your fly ins) you should be slaying them on your second day. Ask Keith for a few suggestions, he won't steer you wrong. We did not need a guide. Here are a few seasonal hot spots (about a 45 minute ride). Make sure you have enough gas and WATCH OUT FOR ROCKS.  The mouth of Broad Lake has tons of walleye early in the year (more numbers than size, but a great way to start things off).  McKenzie Bay  tons of islands, reefs and fishy looking spots.  I forget the exact name, something like Big Sand Banks, great trolling if not too windy.  Close to camp the Bay of Islands can produce too. Maybe you could order a map ahead of time and scope these spots. A GPS on your boat is really helpful."
