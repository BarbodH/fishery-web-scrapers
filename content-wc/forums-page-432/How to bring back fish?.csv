1444579,Guest,2012-06-04 10:10:00,0,"I agree with the above posts. Have one more suggestion. If you do use water ice, don't have loose ice cubes that can melt into liquid water. Your fillets will stay frozen more solidly if all the water ice is in a waterproof bag or container, so your fillets do not sit in contact with liquid water at all. One or a few large solid blocks of ice are better than many ice cubes. We have all our fillets frozen solid, put them in the cooler the morning we leave camp, pack them in with ice frozen into small milk jugs or blue-ice plastic containers, drive 4 hours until we can get dry ice, then get one 1 lb chunk of dry ice. Put the dry ice right on top of all the rest of the fish and ice bags already there. We are then good for the remaining 9 hours."
1445159,rjbuckeye,2012-06-05 11:24:00,9,An additional tip to help get home and to preserve fish for longer storage is to add water to point that fillet is covered with water before freezing. This takes a little more storage space but I've kept perfectly fresh fish for 6-8 months with no freeze burn!
1445198,wallydave,2012-06-05 12:42:00,2151,"We put our fillets in ziplock bags quart sized, add pair of fillets, with patchof skin. Add water, write species, size and name on baggy, put in freezers nice and flat. With couple days freeze plus some dry ice, your take home fish will be ready to eat when your ready! Here's to everyone bringing back just what they want from trip!"
1445205,Lovetofish,2012-06-05 13:00:00,458,I leave a patch of skin on and wrap the two fillets with clear Cling wrap then freeze in camp. When frozen solid I put as many as I can into a large freezer zip bag. Don't waste as many bags this way and if checked I shouldn't have any problems as they can easily identify the fish and count them. Coming home I pack them in a smaller cooler with several frozen bottled water bottles then cover everything with newspaper and a towel and tape the lid on so it's air tight. I get home a day and a half later and they are still froze.
1443572,Bill Krejca,2012-06-01 11:51:00,6107,"We generally freeze the fish, one to a bag. We partially remove the skin, stopping just short of cutting it off completely, but leave the entire skin on the fillet for identification. When ready to eat, a simple tug on the skin separates it from the thawed fillet. Doing thus tends to prevent some freezer burn to the outside of the fillet. Before placing in plastic bag, we first tightly wrap the fillet in Saran Wrap to seal out the air: this helps to prevent freezer burn also. For transporting, if a thick foam ice chest is used, just covering the frozen fish with several layers of newspaper will suffice for short trips of 12 hrs or so. With longer trips, a layer of ice at the top will hold the freeze for some time. When I used to camp, freezing was not an option. Using the same wrapping technique and keeping a thick layer of ice on top of the fish kept them fresh for several days at camp, plus the trip home. The ice chest was used strictly for fish, and was not opened except to add fish and or ice. I used a very thick foam chest. Back in the 1930's and 40's, fish from Canada had to be left whole, no removal of heads and organs. They arrived home with a very slimy coating over all packing. Boxes containing northerns were the worst, as you can imagine, I can still remember the smell in the garage after the war, when Dad returned with his limit of 16 big ones. Bill"
1443599,tv4fish,2012-06-01 12:50:00,2694,"Bill: Back in the 50's and 60's, I remember my Aunt and Uncle always stopping by at our farm in southern MN. to ""show off"" his catch of big northerns as they were on their way home to Sheldon, Ia. When he opened his trunk, everybody would take a few steps back."
1443633,Baitslinger,2012-06-01 15:21:00,93,"We always used to freeze the fish for our long 20+ return drive. At best, they came back just starting to thaw, and at worst, they would be totally thawed in a few spots. Now, we catch our fish the last night, fillet and bag them with a chunk of skin attached, and just chill them down in the fridge. We transport them home very cold, but not frozen. Then we vacuum seal and freeze them after arriving home and removing the skin. That way they are only frozen once, not frozen, thawed, and refrozen. We also save the $20 we would have spent on dry ice. -- heck, I'll buy a big chunk of halibut with that money next winter."
1443634,@Lunker,2012-06-01 15:23:00,835,"You're gonna think this is weird but it works like a charm. Taking solidly frozen fish filets, I wrap them in a couple layers of plastic bags (for sanitary peace of mind as you shall soon see) and then bury them in the middle of my dirty laundry in my cooler. Use duct tape to seal all the seams and they're still rock hard 12 hours later. Don't have to stop for ice or pay extra if the camp charges for it."
1443664,dog2,2012-06-01 17:01:00,198,"We have a 22 +_ hr. drive .the system we use is very simple we use ziplock bag 's qt. size .one fish per bag fillets skin patch out.write size and angler on side of bag.then each bag goes into a gallon size zipbag. We pack this in a small cooler till we get back to the air base ,then they are placed in a larger cooler 1. place 3-4in. of ice on the bottom then scatter a cup or 2 of rock salt,apiece of cloth or newspaper then the fish; put remaining ice into a medium garbage bag throw some salt on top of ice ,close bag and shut cooler. If dnr stoops you lift top bag out, fish will be there for their count and i.d.; they like it when the fish are easy to id and they know who they belong too. The ice will freeze solid when you add rock salt to it and keep air off of it."
1443691,Bill Krejca,2012-06-01 18:29:00,6107,Ha! It is a smell you never forget! My eyes are starting to water! Bill
1443711,4JawChuck,2012-06-01 19:25:00,277,"Old Canadian fishermans trick is to freeze your fillers in a 1 liter milk container in the same water where the fish was caught, don't ask me why but it tastes like fresh caught compared to any other way I've done it. Since the fish is in a solid block of ice it travels well, 15 hrs will be no problem if it's in a cooler."
1443727,oilguy,2012-06-01 20:11:00,257,"Check the laws, but if you freeze your fish be sure that the DNR can identify the number and type of fish. A ticket and confiscated fish wouldn't be the way to end a good trip...You can always use regular ice and get more at the gas stations along the way too. There's lots of great coolers out there these days that will keep your fish cold. If you have the room, you could always get a 12V plug in cooler to keep the fish cold."
1443740,elway12,2012-06-01 21:02:00,335,2 years ago we also started to leave the entire skin attached to the fillets. It seems to keep freezer burn down and keep the fish that much more fresh coming out of frozen. We then just slice the skin off just like you do when you are in camp. It also is easier for inspections.
1443742,hoosiercanadian,2012-06-01 21:10:00,104,"My drive is 36 hours one way from northwestern Manitoba. I just put them on ice, when we get back we have a nice family fish fry, i really don't like to freeze them anymore, as i feel once frozen they really lose their flavor, still good, but not like fresh caught. For several years i would just gut them and leave them whole, as i really did'nt, and still don't understand how a fish can be accurately measured for length when it has been filleted, i now fillet them and leave the patch of skin, and package 2 fillets per plastic bag, because it's easier, and it seems that is how everyone else is doing it , but still need someone to explain how their length could ever be determined."
1443471,10point,2012-06-01 07:46:00,102,Will have about a 15 hour drive home. In the past I haven't brought anything back but I might this year. Would I freeze first or just try to keep cool in a cooler and maybe wrap in a towel?
1443475,JayM5209,2012-06-01 07:55:00,1050,"Freeze your fish and buy a piece of dry ice for the cooler. Fill the empty space in the cooler or put 1/2"" of newspaper layers on top of the fish and dry ice. Tape the cooler lid tightly. Your fish will still be frozen when you get home."
1443481,Gary from Iowa,2012-06-01 08:10:00,74,"If you happen to stop at Border Bobs or one of the stores that cater to fishermen, they will cut the appropriate size of dry ice for your container. and the time to get home. I've also bought ice from dispenser at a Gas Station in Red Lake. Its just a guess when I do it."
1443485,wallydave,2012-06-01 08:18:00,2151,We stop at Dutchies on the 105 for our dry ice for the trip home. The tricky part the last day or two of a trip is. Juggling the limit and still have walleye for the last nights dinner. Remember to leave a patch of skin oneach fillet. We always bag and mark them individually.
1443499,10point,2012-06-01 08:50:00,102,I don't know anything about dry ice but I found a place that sells it here locally. Is that an option or would it not last for a week?
1443502,worthsr,2012-06-01 09:02:00,52,"You need to freeze the fish before you leave camp, leaving a 1 inch by one inch piece of skin on each fillet. We have been using the Ziplock Pump and Seal bags the last couple years and they work great for the take home fish. On your way home, stop and get some dry ice, tell them how many fish you have and that it will take you 15 hours to get home."
1443511,Fishin Fun,2012-06-01 09:31:00,218,I have a 12.5hr drive home and all we've ever done is freeze them at camp in zip loc bags and put them in a cooler full of regular ice. They're just as frozen when I get home as when I left. Never driven 15 hours though.
1443523,Larry Mac,2012-06-01 10:12:00,530,"Hi 10 Point, X2 with fish in fun. We drive 15 hours plus and never had a challenge with wet ice. Of course using dry ice is the best if available. have a great trip.Thank you Larry Mac"
1443525,elway12,2012-06-01 10:16:00,335,Dry ice is a good idea. But we don't or can't get it so we make sure to deep freeze our fillets at least 20 hours before departing. Our fillets are all ready in plastic bags then we wrap them in 3-4 layers of newspaper taping them with masking tape. They keep for our 15 hour trek back home. If I had a longer trip I would do the same but put the fillets in a freezer zip lock and then put it in the bottom of the cooler.
1443535,JJJMN,2012-06-01 10:33:00,153,"We did the dry Ice for years and then my son bought a Colman Extreme Cooler. Past 2 years we would freeze the fish (with the patch of skin remaining). Leave the cooler open overnight to get it as cold as possible before you put the fish in. You could put in ice overnight but remove the ice and dry out the cooler before you load it with frozen fish. Put some paper in bottom of cooler, frozen fish and then paper on top of that. Any remaining space in cooler fill with something. I used insulated jacket but a life vest.... anything to fill the space and make sure it locks shut. Keep the cooler out of the sun and where you can get too it when the DNR stops you. Make sure you have each package marked with type and if a trophy. Makes it easier and quicker for you when the DNR Stops you. We have a 12 hour trip from camp to first stop in Minneapolis and the past 2 years without dry ice, ice or anything else they have stayed frozen solid."
