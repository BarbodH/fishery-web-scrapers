1402157,SSH,2012-03-03 07:39:00,526,"If you loose,can't print or forget to print your Ontario fishing license. The website states: If you cannot print your e-licence, call the Outdoors Card Centre toll-free at 1-800-387-7011 and they will print and mail you a copy."
1402251,nitrodude,2012-03-03 11:52:00,60,"They did for me. I did all my renewals online as I do here in the states, but when I got to the end it wouldn't print. Called the number and I got my license a couple days ago. Just waiting for my renewed Outdoors card and I'm all set."
1444540,villain189,2012-06-04 08:52:00,33,"Just renewed online for the first time. Both an Outdoors Card renewal and a new license. Can someone tell me what the 'proof' of license looks like for each? I saved/printed 2 PDF's docs. * One was a receipt for the transaction. * The is the 'e-licence' which it says at the top. I can tell that is the fishing license. There are 2 line items on that 'e-licence'. One for the Outdoors Card and one for the Fishing License both with valid dates listed. Just making sure this 'e-licence' is all I need for the licence and Outdoors Card. And also they will mail me an actual plastic Outdoors card as well, correct? thanks"
1444603,UKBDM,2012-06-04 10:50:00,178,"Villain, you are correct. Paper copy counts as both until you get the card in the mail."
1444639,3M TA3,2012-06-04 12:21:00,2846,Please explain. I had two paper copies. One is the app for the outdoors card the other is the license. I received the outdoors card but didn't receive a license. The paper license should be carried with you at all times. Isn't that correct?
1444678,villain189,2012-06-04 13:22:00,33,I put through both transactions (Outdoors Card & License) in the same order. Guessing maybe you did two separate orders and that's why you have one for each? After I added my Outdoors Card renewal it allowed me to add my license to the same cart and checkout both products at the same time. From my understanding you won't get a license in the mail. What you print out is your actual license. The Outdoors Card 'e-licence' you print out is valid but is 'temporary' as they will mail you a plastic card.
1444729,UKBDM,2012-06-04 15:01:00,178,"Villain is correct. You did two different transactions. You will need both if your card doesn't arrive before you leave for your trip. Once you have the card, you only need the paper with the license on it. It is your license. Nothing is coming in the mail to replace it."
1444903,3M TA3,2012-06-04 22:03:00,2846,My mistake. Just looked at the document again and both the e-license and Outdoor Card are on the receipt. It does state that the e-license is only valid with the Outdoors Card-Fishing.
1398557,bergsh,2012-02-24 08:18:00,183,I did mine this year online. Printed the document and all is well. I hope the MNR decides to email you it in PDF so you always have the ability to print a copy.
1398644,Glenman12,2012-02-24 11:29:00,762,I had renewed my Outdoor Card about a month prior and the temporary printed out fine..got the card itself about 10 days later..I'll give it a month or so and if I havent received it in the mail by then I will call them..
1398994,TIGHTLINER,2012-02-25 10:04:00,223,SINCE I STARTED THIS POST I WILL FILL EVERYONE IN ON WHAT HAS HAPPENED AFTER I CALLED MNR. I CALLED FRIDAY MORNING AND THE GIRL I TALKED WITH WAS VERY HELPFUL BUT I AM STILL WONDERING IF I GOT THE RIGHT INFO. I TOLD HER AFTER I CLICKED TO SEND THE INFORMATION I GOT A ERROR 505 OR 404 SO I WAS NOT SURE IF THE TRANSACTION WENT OR NOT. I TRIED GETTING BACK INTO THE INFO I SENT AND GOT ANOTHER ERROR 505 OR 404. SHE TOLD ME THAT THE THE AMOUNT POSTED TO THE CREDIT CARD AROUND $58.00 WHICH SOUNDED ABOUT RIGHT HOWEVER AT ONE TIME A CHARGE CAME UP TO $234.00. SHE WAS NOT SURE HOW I GOT THAT ON MY SCREEN AND ASSURED ME THAT THE CORRECT AMOUNT WAS THE $58.00. I WAS ABLE TO PRINT A DOCUMENT OFF THAT HAD MY APPLICATION FOR A NEW OUTDOORS CARD AND THE ANNUAL ONE YEAR CONSERVATION LICENSE. THERE WAS NOTHING ON IT ABOUT AGE WEIGHT COLOR OF HAIR OR EYES NOTHING ELSE AS FAR AS A NUMBER BUT MY OUTDOORS CARD NUMBER FROM 3 YEARS AGO. SHE TOLD ME THIS IS ALL THAT IS NEEDED AND TO PRINT EXTRA COPIES OF IT IN CASE I LOOSE THE ORIGINAL. SHE ALSO STATED THAT MY OUTDOOR CARD WOULD ARRIVE IN ABOUT 20 DAYS. TO ME THIS IS NOT THE TYPE OF DOCUMENT NORMALLY ISSUED FOR A FISHING OR HUNTING LICENSE IN ANY STATE AND SURE NOTHING LIKE I HAVE HAD IN THE 25+ YEARS OF GOING TO ONTARIO. I AM PUTTING THIS OUT THERE JUST IN CASE SOMEONE ELSE RUNS INTO THIS SAME THING WHILE TRYING TO APPLY FOR A ONTARIO LICENSE AND OUTDOOR CARD. PLEASE POST ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HELP TO UNDERSTAND THIS NEW WAY OF OBTAINING A LICENSE IN ONTARIO.

1399231,JayM5209,2012-02-25 21:07:00,1050,"Larry, I think I beat your time by about one minute! I renewed online back in December when the renewal notice came. Printed out the 2012 license and the new card came in the mail about three weeks later. Ontario has come up with an efficient, easy to use system. Tightliner, sorry your experience was so frustrating. I'm sure it will go better next time.Incidentally, in addition to my resident Wisconsin license I get nonresident licenses each year from Ontario, Minnesota, and Texas, all purchased online. Wouldn't do it any other way."
1399693,Shellback,2012-02-27 04:56:00,8083,"Other than having the license and Outdoors card in hand when arriving in Canada, is there any other advantage to buying online. My Outdoors card expired in Dec also. Can I just pay for a license and new Outdoors card when I arrive in Canada? Very simple for me to buy them in Gananoque. I hate taking the chance of printing something out and things going wrong."
1399714,TIGHTLINER,2012-02-27 06:20:00,223,Thanks to Larry on WC I think I have my problem solved. To address the post on getting them from a dealer once in Ontario. The first year you had to have a outdoor card we had to stop 3 different places in order to get 8 guys their outdoor card and fishing license because places were running out from the locals and out of country people coming up to fish. MNR did not supply the outfitters or dealers with enough license to begin with so we decided to do it over the phone or internet. The internet is great as long as everything is working. However I do have my license and waiting for the outdoor card to arrive by pony express. Thanks to everyone that responded to my post WC is great.
1399725,wallydave,2012-02-27 06:56:00,2151,"Shellback, last year my boat/cabin buddy and I had to cut our trip short a couple of days, so we called ahead to get both the outdoors card and licenses. Just one less thing to ""slow"" us down on our way to Lac Seul! Hey it helps with the pre-trip anxiety?! If you have time and don't need to rush, buying what you need on the way, is nice too! I really miss the Village Corner in V-Bay! It was a nice place to stop, gas, license, buy a few cigars and one or two North lakes lures that are hard to find in Il.! So now we stop at Dutchies, for beer and Cuban cigars, much less waiting when folks are lined up for licenses."

I WILL BE ON THE HORN FIRST THING IN THE AM. I DO NOT WANT TO RESUBMIT IT IN CASE IT WENT THROUGH AND I WOULD BE BUYING THE SAME THING TWICE. CALL AND TALK TO SOMEONE IF YOU CAN TO MAKE SURE.
1398436,Fishin Fun,2012-02-23 20:08:00,218,I ordered mine online and thought that they would send me my license. Oh no. I had to print it off at the time. Why I didn't catch that I don't know. So I emailed them and they said that I had to stop in at a license provider in Ontario and get a duplicate for $10.50.
1398445,rdbalmer,2012-02-23 20:36:00,279,Can't you buy one when you get up there and avoid alot of these problems? I have always bought mine once I cross the border but it has been 5 years since I was up there last. Rob
1398447,Golden Eagle,2012-02-23 20:42:00,2642,Demand is great and the system is not ready. Walmart could get it done quicker and cheaper.

(Yet the ""test page"" worked fine.) Called and spoke with a nice gal that could see it was all there and paid, but they were experiencing ""computer issues"" at the time and she would send me my lisc. and new Ontario Outdoors Card. Still waiting for them to get it right and send my liscense and Outdoors Card......Luckily, I used AMEX and will dispute the charge and get it refunded if it doesn't arrive soon. This system is obviously not ready for prime time."
1398535,wallydave,2012-02-24 07:28:00,2151,"Its great when it works! Sux when it doesn't! Last year I ordered both the card and license over the phone. Just a few moments talking to a real person, and a few weeks until they arrived in the mail. Buying these ahead of time frees up some time on the trip North, just one or two less things to take care of before we hit the road to our favorite fishing spots!"
