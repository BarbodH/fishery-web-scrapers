Trying to get an idea of the water level in that part of Lac Seul. As I understand it, the closest gauge station is way west down by Ear Falls, even though it is referred to as the ""Lac Seul"" gauge station?"
1444594,Jabs,2012-06-04 10:32:00,24,We were there for the opener & the water was down about a foot. They have had a lot of rain since
1444608,tv4fish,2012-06-04 10:59:00,2694,Thanks Jab: Heading up tomorrow Sounds like there should be no problems with low water levels. Good to know.

1444625,tv4fish,2012-06-04 11:52:00,2694,"Thank you!You will get one, for sure I'm especially liking the weather forecast - This trip is with my ""better half"" - it's been a few years since my ""regular"" group of guys and I have gone this early (Primarily due to the usual cool weather). SOOO - we'll compare this trip to the one in another month."
1444629,RapShad,2012-06-04 11:55:00,76,Hitting up the usual spots or trying some different ones?
1444634,tv4fish,2012-06-04 12:03:00,2694,"Of course we ALWAYS have to try the spots that we have ""named"" after each other !! It is going to depend on where we find the fish. It's like ""they"" say --- the fishing is always good, just sometimes the catching isn't as good."
