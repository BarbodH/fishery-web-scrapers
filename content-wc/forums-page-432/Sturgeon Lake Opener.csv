1444401,catran3,2012-06-03 20:18:00,29,The amount of rain was staggering. I arrived up there Friday the 25th. It started raining on Saturday evening and didn't quit until Wednesday morning. It poured all day and all night. The lake came up considerably by the time we left last Friday morning but I still managed to hit rocks a couple of times trying to get in and out of the bays. I got up one morning and found the water in my boat above the floor boards all the way to the middle of the boat. I was afraid I was going to drain the battery trying to bilge out the boat. Oh and by the way the fishing was great!

1441134,plumberjoe,2012-05-27 06:54:00,54,"Got in last night . The water levels are about a foot lower than last year but not that bad. It rained about 4"" while we were there so the lake is rising. The water temps were 52 to 57 depending where we went. The weeds were up in some spots and just coming up in others. The fishing was good as always. Our group of 5 caught aprox 700 walleye with the biggest being 27 lots of fish in the 16 to 18 inch range. Northerns were very active we got one 41 incher. Trout for us and everyone in camp were slow. We caught our fish in the same spots as other years so the early spring didnt change that most fish in 5 to 10 ft of water. Walleyes we cleaned were full of some kind of bugs. We caught them on minnows mostly and some leeches. We also tried preserved minnows from magic baits and they worked great. We stay at Maries Bay outpost camp and spend most of our time fishing the northeast arm. Good luck."

1441411,Bill Krejca,2012-05-27 21:19:00,6107,Good report!
1441478,plumberjoe,2012-05-28 07:39:00,54,For those of you who might know Twig the camp owner. He has really slowed down and even quit smoking due to health issues. Im sure there are alot better camps than his but we like the access to the northeast arm. Other than black bay it is rare to see another boat.
1441514,Catman59,2012-05-28 09:01:00,345,I saw Twig this winter. He is slowing down. We fish Couture with him and whoever is wintering with him at the time. Thats a fun lake too. Was Troy there with you ?
1441641,plumberjoe,2012-05-28 14:05:00,54,Troy was there for a couple days at the beginning of the week.
1441691,JJJMN,2012-05-28 15:46:00,153,"Also just got back last night from Sturgeon Lake, Camp Midgard, Trappers Point. Walleye fishing was great. Big Northerns were hard to find. Most of our Walleye were in the 16 to 18in range, many 18 to 22 and a few 25-26in. Great week for gortex. Kept us off lake a few mornings but still good week for fishing, eating, card playing and sleeping. First time in 21 years I didn't come home with sunburn. Camp minnows were 2.85doz. Picked up 1lb of leaches for $35 on the road. If you buy gas or supplies in Canada convert what you need before crossing into Canada. Even the visitors site at Pigeon River was chargeing 10% conversion for fishing license. Used Credit Card."

1444229,Catman59,2012-06-03 13:31:00,345,"The lake has been coming up since last week .......... 2ft and still rising !!!! LOTS of rain up that way , in fact 599 was washed out south of Savant Lake for a while."
1444252,Further North,2012-06-03 14:46:00,2008,Holly cow...that's a staggering amount of water...
