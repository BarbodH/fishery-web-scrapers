1444959,waterwick,2012-06-05 05:17:00,32,Also remember that if you cannot be picked up for a day or two due to the weather have some extra food and that emergency bottle of rum handy. Nothing worse than being grounded with no spirits handy.
1444650,Guest,2012-06-04 12:35:00,0,Asking what everyone's normal fly-in times are for those who? Is it very early or around noon?
1444672,Guest,2012-06-04 13:08:00,0,"Normal? It all depends on your outfitter and more importantly who controls the flight operations. Some outfitters contract the flying to a third party. So, let's say it is Saturday morning, you arrive at dawn and are ready to go. However, the float plane needs to shuttle three other groups before you. Have fun at the dock waiting for 4 hours. Ask when and you get the runaround. Some outfitters control their own flying service which may offer more control. Just keep in mind your group will not be the only group flying that morning. No empty flights - For every group that gets dropped off at the outpost, the plane gets filled with another group returning from the outpost back to base. Hopefully they are ready, no problems and there are no delays. Pickup times are also up for grabs. You might be told to be ready at the dock at 9:00 AM but the plane does not show up until noon. One time, the pickup plane was larger (Otter?), picked up another group first who first had to unload a planeload of plywood. Hmmm, when did the plywood get loaded? Of course, everything is subject to weather/acceptable flying conditions. IMHO, the closest thing to a normal fly in time is morning. Ask you outfitter to describe his operations."
1444714,SinOrSwim,2012-06-04 14:32:00,1528,"We have gone for years with Slate Falls Outposts or now some of those lakes are Red Pine Outposts. When we first started going up back in the day we flew out of Kenora and it was a random time. Sometimes the pick up plane was morning sometimes afternoon.But, when we started flying out of Sioux Lookout with the aforementioned outfitters, we ALWAYS flew out about 6 or 6:30 in the morning and were ALWAYS picked up around 7 to 7:30 in the morning. Unless there was some bad weather. They were extremely consistent. Nothing worse than having a 13 hour drive ahead of you, you wake up at 5:30 am to clean the cabin and be ready by 7 and not get picked up til 11. Not much to do when everything is packed and ready to go."
1444719,tooski,2012-06-04 14:46:00,393,Agree with Sin... hate waiting around for hours with everything packed. Last year Hawk Air was within 15 minutes on departure and return. I definitely consider that when choosing an outfitter.
1444731,clearis,2012-06-04 15:05:00,47,"First expectation on a fly-in is that you have little to no control over flights. Morning is typical, but I've also flown in the afternoon (rare and had to pay more for the special trip). Typically, new guests arrive in the AM with departing guests flying out on the return trip. Lodges typically pay a fixed amount for the flight, whether there are 5 people on the plane or one. If a plane is coming in empty (no new guests), there're usually hauling freight on that inbound leg. For fly-in lodges, transportation is their largest cost or just behind labor. They have to manage flights efficiently. You can't control the weather and neither can the lodge or flight operator. One trip I flew in on the departing guests had been waiting two days to get out. They were not happy campers. Realize that if you are weather bound, you probably won't be out fishing. The lodge doesn't know if there'll be a break in the weather and a plane will show up. If your weather bound, your're probably going to the land bound as well. Keep in mind weight restrictions. More weight means more fuel and more cost. It also increases flight risk. Keep within weight limits or be prepared to pay more. Consider having those cases of beverages flow in advance on a cargo haul (if provided by the lodge operator) rather with you. Ask if they'll order the beverages and have them flown in ahead of you. You might pay a bit more, but why quibble over $100 when your group is already paying $5k. Rule of thumb is $1 to $1.50 per lb over the weight limit. If you're over the weight limit, that beer gets expensive. If the lodge owner sees your group 150 lbs overweight and they see six cases of beer or liquor on the dock, there're asking themselves what kind of trouble you're going to be. Set reasonable expectations within the realities of flying light aircraft into remote wilderness and you will have a much better trip. If you have concerning with flying on the impact that can have on your vacation travel, consider drive to or boat in lodges. These lodges can provide similar fishing experiences without the concerns with flying and being at a remote location."
1444737,clearis,2012-06-04 15:17:00,47,Two excellent providers are Wilderness Air in northern Ontario and Blue Water Aviation in eastern Manitoba. They service a number of lodges in their respective areas.
1444752,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-04 15:52:00,235,"Our outfitter is pretty reliable. We arrive to the base camp the night before are told to be at the dining hall usually by 6:15am for a hot breakfast. Our gear is loaded while we we eat, and the first flight departs around 7. Our group requires two Beaver flights, so half the group waits for the first plane to return. The flights are short (10-20 minutes depending the outpost) and we typically have lines in the water by a little after 9am. We are told to be ready and packed by 7am on the day of our departure. I can only think of one or two times where we had to wait a couple hours, and I believe that was weather related. It's too bad our group doesn't get a sat phone...would be nice to know of a long delay so we can bust out the fishing gear and go hit the honey hole one last time!"
1444756,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-04 15:57:00,235,"I would also suggest not scheduling any key business meetings or other major life events the day after you return from a fly in. If they don't have VFR conditions, they can NOT fly in to pixk you up. Weather is weather. My brother was on a trip where they were stranded an extra night or two due to weather. They unpacked some gear and took full advantage of the free fishing...why not!?"
1444841,packpro,2012-06-04 19:48:00,695,"I second the Wilderness Air response posted above. Always great service. He has a number of planes to handle his bookings. We get there early in the morning and we are wheels up (actually pontoons up) between 7AM and 8AM. Only weather causes delays. Great pilots, always a lilltle humor with those guys on the flight."
1444879,Pooch,2012-06-04 20:49:00,4619,"Any float plane service we have used is always right on time as long as the weather cooperates. Green Airways out of Red Lake was usually early if the weather on both ends was clear. Sometimes it's clear at your location, but socked in at the fly-out base.We've spent the entire day waiting under blue bird skies while it was heavy fog at the fly out base twenty miles away.I've never figured out which would be worse, to be stuck not being able to get to the lake or stuck trying to get out of the lake.Rusty Meyer's base at Savant Lake had a sign that said it best.""I'd rather be on the ground wishing I was flying than be flying and wishing I was on the ground.""Pooch"
