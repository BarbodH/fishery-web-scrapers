1444683,Lake Wisconsin,2012-06-04 13:32:00,1960,"A very long story, as short as I can make it. We usually stay well in control. A beer or two while cleaning fish, and a few with the fish fry. But........one night, we ran out of beer. So my buddy started to make his own old fashions. He is not much of a whisky drinker. We noticed he was getting a bit loopy and before we new it, WHAM, he hit the floor head first, never caught himself and we have a ton of blood. Picked him up, and sat him on the toilet seat (best light in the cabin) to see the damages and reduce the amount of blood going to his head. Yup - clean cut to the skull (it is white, just in case you have not seen a human skull before). The cut was about 2"" in length right over the brow. It was very clear neither my buddy or I could drive the 2 hours to a hospital because we had enough to drink as well. I didn't have a suture kit, so, dug into my tackle box and found a never opened super glue I use on plastics. Clean him up, glued the opening, held it closed until the glue bonded and placed a patch over the wound. He had a black eye the rest of the trip. If you were to see him today, you can't even see a scar. I was impressed with my own work. But with that being said, now I watch my buddies better to make sure we do, all stay in control."

We also had a couple bottles of Maker's for the cabin. We took it easy, didn't wake up with rocks in the head once. Need to keep the back loose as you get older. Never a drink in the boat. But a little Labott's Blue to brush your teeth with. The guys from NARDA are a blast"
1443792,10point,2012-06-02 06:43:00,102,Don't drink. I go to Canada to fish.
1443793,Pooch,2012-06-02 06:46:00,4619,"A little buzz is fun, but usually about the same time the buzz happens, ""one more and that's it"" stupid is just moments away, followed by ""I really feel like crap"".Old enough now that I let go of that a long time ago! If I'm gonna be sick and hung over I'd rather do it at home in my own toilet! I used to bond with the bathroom rug on occasion in my younger years. Like 10point says ""we go to fish"".Pooch"
1443801,Bill Krejca,2012-06-02 07:03:00,6107,"Well said, Pooch, I can relate to that. Bill"
1443823,Rich B,2012-06-02 07:50:00,1081,"Also head north to fish, fish and fish.....I will have accouple 3 beers or so after we come in late off the water and are cleaning up the fish and having a fish fry, but that's it.....don't get out to fish much at home (outside of Lake Erie on occasion) so want to make the most of my time ""up nort"" and enjoy the lake, the fishing, etc without a headache, stomach flu (ha) etc. Rich"
1443849,Guest,2012-06-02 09:28:00,0,"Interesting subject, this will be my 38th trip north started in the early 70's. I have records from all our trips big fish, weather, and beer drank etc. In 1978 we set the record for beer drank 42 cases for 9 fishermen. Now less fast forward to this year's trip (leaving in 5 days) of the original 9 only 2 remain, father-in-law's and been replaced with son's and we have 6 fisherman heading north. Just order or beer for the (boat-in lodge) trip, camper owners will have it on site for us. 8 cases La Batts lite, 5 reg. La Batt's We take ZERO beer on the lake, just on worth the risk of getting caught or accident. old top water pro 5-6 new topwater pro 3.5 4.0"
1443970,Rivratz,2012-06-02 16:49:00,105,"Jesus was a man that lived over 2000 Years ago! Jesus and his closest friends were all ""Fishermen"". They had ""good and bad"" days on the water fishing. Just Like Us! Jesus was once invited to a 3 day wedding celebration. ""Similar to your Canadian fishing vacation"", But only 3 days on a fly-in. Well the story has been told that, late that first night, disturbing news came about. There was a panic in the camp!!! WE are out of the juice from the ""fruit of the vine"". Yeah, you know the one, used to beMichael Jackson's ""Jesus Juice""! Wine, and good potent wine, no regs, the stronger the better! Jesus was bummed because, He ""Wanted To Party""!!! Jesus had ordered the camp owners too fill 15, 5 gal pails, with water. Jesus proclaimed that, in the next 2 days if we don't get this party cranked up to a ""Rivratz"" 5 scale, the party will be a failure. Lots of 5's at that party! Lots of ""Drunken Sin"" being committed! The party, ""Thanks To Jesus"", was a huge success! Well you know the rest of the story. It was a ""Miracle"" that Jesus was able to ""Turn Water In To Wine"". Good potent wine! God Smiled! They partied like it was 1999! God Smiled Again""! Let us remember this event until man is no longer! ""So It Shall Be Written""! From that point on, ""It was good that man can drink from the fruit of the vine""! And, any other way that ""God had provided the resources"", that help man relax and have fun! I presume that the majority of us are rated a 6 on the scale of 1 to 8! Just Mixed bags! So, no reason to feel guilty about letting loose in Canada! God wants you too!!!"
1444073,3M TA3,2012-06-02 21:57:00,2846,Drugs. All of us old farts swap medications.
1444153,NARDA 1,2012-06-03 08:16:00,636,Don't really know what number would apply to our group.We have tamed it down a bit since becoming older and wiser. several years ago our group of 6 went through 29 1 liter bottles of rye in a week. We have now tempered that back to about half that!!!!
1444508,tv4fish,2012-06-04 07:09:00,2694,"I think your No. 2 fits our group right now. One good drink when we get back in camp (maybe even with a good cigar! )- then it's clean the fish - cook dinner - then maybe 1-2 more as we play cards or just enjoy the evening. It's a ""dirty job"" but somebody has to do it."
1444533,Further North,2012-06-04 08:40:00,2008,"This one, because I a) am a light weight and don't drink much anyway, and b) don't spend that kind of money to drink. A guy can do that at home.Like someone else said, I go to Canada to fish, not to drink.I would, however, like to be able to have a beer with lunch."
1443644,Rivratz,2012-06-01 15:53:00,105,"""DO YOU REALLY GET.... OR, PLAN ON GETTING,... on your trip up to Canada with the guys??? Ok, I would bet that this topic probably comes up, before you leave, by your wives, girlfriends, or whatever? How truthfully do you answer? Percentage wise, I would guess that 95% of the time, you could never tell them the whole truth. How many wives or girlfriends are reading these posts on WC??? 99.9% none, I'm sure of! So, it's pretty safe to say, you can answer freely here. Right! Ok, let me ask the question again, but, the premise is, your back home from the trip, and your out with the guys, or talking to your best buds, about your trip. Lots of good buddies are happy that you caught fish, and like to hear the stories once, not more than twice, but, what they want too really hear is the "" back at the cabin or camp"" stories, and, how blasted that you and the guys got? Over and Over again... THE REAL TRUTH!!! We want to presume that there isn't any open alcohol in the vehicles or the boat, EVER!!! Let's make it easy... 1 through 8 rating! "" alcohol = 1 beer or 1 hard drink"" ! - Not that much, maybe a beer, no more than 2 with my dinner, and for the night. 2 - I like to have a beer or drink after fishing, before my dinner, maybe 2 no more than 3 after dinner and for the night. 3 - I wish I could have at least 1 or 2 while at a hotspot fishing, 1 or 2 before dinner, and no more than 3 after dinner. By this time, a little tired from the day, but, at least I'm feeling pretty good right now before bed! 4 - I'm having a beer with breakfast, wish I had at least 2 or 3 in the boat while fishing hot spots, all before lunch, 1 or 2 with shore lunch , 1 or 2 before dinner, and maybe 3 after dinner? Feeling real tired, and, a lot more buzzed than last night! 5 - So ""S Faced"" all day, will probably pass out in the boat at some point, if not, before dinner for a while, wake up, eat a cold leftover dinner, then, get so plowed after dinner, pass out somewhere outside the cabin, wake up at 5am, you can'i remember what you did for the last 3 days, come inside the cabin, start making breakfast with your morning brew, ""coffee-beer"", and start all over again. Day after day... the whole trip! 6 - I like my Canadian fishing trip buzz like my fishing. I like a mixed bag of fish, and I like to mix it up, and hope to achieve all of the above on any given day. But never more than 2 days in a row. I sort of want to remember some of the trip after I get home! 7. - Don""t drink at all!! 8 - Wish 420 was legal! Nothing to be embarrassed about if you answer correctly here, because frankly, nobody really cares! Ii's all fact and fun here on WC! Unless you are a Big Drunken Nuisance to your fishing buddies, they won't bring you back next year! You could be a 5, and, still be asked back next year! Just depends! You probably own the boat, or truck, or both, if your a ""BDN"", and you get to go back with friends ever again."
1443654,camp chef,2012-06-01 16:19:00,915,What happens in Canada stays in Canada..
1443679,HeHooksHimself,2012-06-01 17:50:00,725,I never thought about bringing beer along. Maybe I will try that next time! Not in the boat tho.
1443683,Rivratz,2012-06-01 17:54:00,105,"But I didn't see a number for your vote? HEHEHE! OK! I should have answered first, truthfully! You also can be more than one number. I'm "" all the questions asked except 7"", at one point or another, not in any special order! Not all of the time! Do you dare take the survey!!!!"
1443694,rnnonmt,2012-06-01 18:47:00,992,Haha. Definitely #4 but not in the boat while fishing. Maybe 3.5 then!!!
1443707,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-06-01 19:18:00,84,I have been all of them for sure. I would say 3.75. Usually 1 big drinking night followed by a no drinking day.
1443720,wallydave,2012-06-01 19:53:00,2151,There have a couple nights around the camp fire when the beers just go down pretty smoothly and before you know it your pretty drunk.. It can make for a rough morning!! You might not started out to get lite up but it just happens that way. A couple ofbeers in the fishhouse leads to a couple more with dinner and your on your way. We don't have beer in the boat so the fist couple can taste pretty darn good after a day on the water! Hey you are on vacation!! Interesting post.
1443745,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-01 21:35:00,235,"I can't imagine not being able to tell my wife that I got hammered up in Canada. It's not like there's any viable women nearby up there to tempt you. My wife has more interest in tales of (non sexual) debauchery than the fishing recap.However, as you bring your teenage sons up and let them drink, that I can see that being more of a secret. I remember going up for my first Canada trip when I was about 19, legal drinking age in Canada. I started chugging beers and later puked in the middle of the night. I thought I was being so stealthy going outside to barf, but my friends dad heard me and he teases me about it to this day every time we're up there.There's kind of a cool moment that happens when you can share a beer or cigar openly and as an equal with your dad or your friends dad for the first time...especially if you aren't even 21. A rite of passage of sorts, and the 'don't tell mom' aspect of it can strengthen the bond with you and your dad or son.I've been all levels of drunk up there, and honestly I prefer no alcoho these days. I honestly just get a rush firing up the motor and venturing out to a new spot."
1443763,troutaholic,2012-06-02 01:58:00,827,Probably #3 or #4................but................. We like to have 5 or 6 dinners per night.............lol
1443779,jdoaks,2012-06-02 05:59:00,89,Ilike to have a just enough to get a good happy buzz goin but not enough to have hangover I got my wife with me and she does about the same.
