1444560,LOW1,2012-06-04 09:30:00,2828,"Lots of newspaper aticles last week re the weakening Canadian Looney - its recently gone from about 1 Looney = 95 cents US to 1 Looney = $1.04 U.S. The conversion rates offered were all over the map, from par to 1 Looney = 90 cents USD. If you are not happy with the quoted exchange, just use a credit card. It's nothing worth losing a vacation over.If you are a Canadian importer of things like electronics or computers it's a problem. But if you are a Canadian exporter it's a benefit. Hopefully this will help the Canadian lumber and paper industries."
1444627,TIGHTLINER,2012-06-04 11:52:00,223,I JUST GOT BACK FROM CANADA SATURDAY AND WHEN I CHECKED AT THE SOO DUTY FREE HE SAID $1.00 US WOULD GIVE YOU .97 CA IN RETURN. THE EXCHANGE RATE IN NAKINA WAS $1.00 US TO 99 CA A WEEK BEFORE. THE OUTFITTER WANTED CANADIAN MONEY HOWEVER THE BANK IN NAKINA SAID THEY HAVE A NEW POLICY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A ACCOUNT WITH THEM THEY CAN ONLY EXCHANGE $200.00 US. SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT BECAUSE WE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM BEFORE.
1444648,Lovetofish,2012-06-04 12:33:00,458,So where can I do a currency exchange at International Falls/Fort Francis? Used to do it at the visitors center but they no longer have that service.
1444661,Guest,2012-06-04 12:55:00,0,You can exchange at Border Bob's or at the Duty Free shop. I used the Duty Free shop and felt they were fair compared to the stated rates.
1444682,Lovetofish,2012-06-04 13:31:00,458,"Which duty free, US or CND? I was in the CND one once to get a GST rebate. Is that the correct one?"
1444967,Kevin R,2012-06-05 05:35:00,305,"In 2005 the exchange rate was 40/50 % the price of gas under $2.00 packages were also about 10/25% less in all the the trip was a bargin & it showed at the border with waits of a couple hours or more. In 2007 gas more than doubled the exchange rate dropped packages went up & waits at the border were less than an hour. I filled my boat & truck in Dryden 80 gallons in boat 25 in truck it cost about $500. Now I don't take that boat but did 4 years in a row prices stayed about the same, & each year I see less crossing the border. Why ? I think the exchange could be a factor along with passports, outdoor card & less income. I have been thinking about just using the camp boats they keep getting better & dragging a boat behind my truck from Florida is not cheap."
1445024,bigdaddyguns,2012-06-05 07:36:00,608,"Will you explain what you mean by ""fair."" Do they charge a % of the currency exchanged, a flat fee, or both and what are they? Also has anyone exchanged at Border Bob's and what are their fees? Thanks."
1445138,Guest,2012-06-05 10:36:00,0,I recieved about $288 Canadian for $300 US. I would expect a flat transfer fee involved there. Local banks in my hometown charged a flat $30.00 for the exchange. I found later that Chase bank would exchange for no fee to a customer. The Candian Welcome Center in FF used to exchange at the daily rate for no charge but that was closed in 2010 I believe. To provide this service they need to be carrying a decent amount of cash so I would not expect them to do this for nothing. This was at the Duty Free in Int Falls.
1442522,Gary from Iowa,2012-05-30 07:26:00,74,Thanks for all the input on exchanging US dollars for Canadian dollars. My question: When and where do you exchange Canadian dollars back to US dollars? In Canada or US and where?
1442540,tv4fish,2012-05-30 07:41:00,2694,"Gary: If you live in a ""small"" town - I would try your local bank. I buy my Canadian dollars from them and if I have any left - I go there to exchange the Canadian back to U.S. dollars. If you are a ""regular"" bank customer, I think they will treat you right."
1442588,JJJMN,2012-05-30 08:37:00,153,If you go up through Duluth and Grand Portage you can stop at Ryden's Border Store at the border or Grand Portage Casino station a few miles before the border.

1442913,JBwvu,2012-05-30 19:37:00,18,Two cents difference and we are quibbling? Spend $1000+ and we are quibbling? Not worth it guys.Enjoy your trip. Exchange rate is not a factor.Be glad we can still afford to go. $15 trillion in debt is what we should be worrying about.
1443362,Basser,2012-05-31 20:20:00,31,"When you say ""exchange your US $ at the border"" do you mean the Canadian stores where you can buy liquor, etc?"
1443458,JJJMN,2012-06-01 07:12:00,153,"Never tried to do the exchange in Canada. We go up thru Duluth to Thunderbay and use the stores just before the border or a little before. Rydans or Grand Portage Casino Station. I guess I started this thread with the wrong title. Shouild have been ""Avoid Paying 10% exchange Rate in Canada"". Pennies I could live with, paying 10% premium because I pulled out US Dollars in Canada I would like to avoid. We bring our own boats, food to a drive in camp on Sturgeon Lake. After 21 years we have it down to $550 per person into the pot when we load up (Cabin, food, bait, drinks, GAS) for the week. Buying gas in Canada hurts bad enough without adding 10% on top of that. Camp fee has alway's been in US Funds and we convert enough cash for gas, bait, and any food and booze we need during the week. If the banks in Canada are killing the stores for converting US dollars just bring Canadian. Have a great trip."
1443505,mclemson,2012-06-01 09:10:00,19,"I use a credit card with no foreign transaction fees. So there's no problem with the $0.85 fee per $28.00 mentioned by one poster. (I didn't do the math but this is probably 2.9% or 3.0%, which is standard.) That's if your lodge charges in CAD and not USD."
1443514,IMSPIKE,2012-06-01 09:48:00,12,"It's legal but you can only take a set amount over in gas cans without having to pay the tax man. I can't remember how many gallons it is extra that you can have, but you may want to chek that out."
1441898,oldschooltiller,2012-05-29 07:07:00,515,Real simple-and likely dumb question.I was reading over a lodges web site and it said NO FUEL BROUGHT INTO CAMP. (Other than what is in the tank of the boat/vehicle)Is it not legal to cross with tanks of fuel in the back of your truck?
1441900,lcwhit,2012-05-29 07:11:00,104,this is why i opened a savings account in ear falls last summer.
1441903,Phil T,2012-05-29 07:19:00,4820,"I'm in a good situation for exchanging the currencies. The State Bank of ND sells me Canadian currency at a very good rate, and I've known for over 40 years that the bank with the big blue sign (Royal Bank of Canada) is the best place to exchange more money if I run short. Living in Europe for over two years provided lots of practice exchanging currencies."
1441904,v-bay gord,2012-05-29 07:24:00,3168,"Yes, it is legal......but......some lodges would prefer to not have gas containers sitting next to their cabins leaking gas in the sun.......some lodges would prefer to not see gas ending up in the lake from folks trying to fill their boats from containers........some lodges may have experienced insurance liability issues with unsafe storage of fuels and spills. The bottom line is it's not a money issue, but a hazard that no business really needs. All it takes is one bad experience to see the ""No fuel in camp"" policy."
1441909,oldschooltiller,2012-05-29 07:33:00,515,Well that is why I was asking to see if it were legal. If I had intentions of staying at a lodge w/that rule I wouldn't bring any. (Maybe they all have that rule-I haven't really paid attention to that)
1441932,MorganMan,2012-05-29 08:01:00,341,"This is a big reason we throw cash into a pot before we leave as a group. Everything we buy on the way up and back comes from the pot so we all incur the fuel, food, etc expenses on an equal basis. The exception is someone buying license, tackle, or clothing for themselves. We exchange to Canadian funds at the border on the way up and then back again to US funds on the way back. This has worked for us for all these years and we haven't had a reason to do otherwise."
1441996,Fisherman Ted,2012-05-29 09:39:00,461,"Random musings on the whole exchange rate discussion from an owner that charges in U.S. dollars and does not flop based on rates. The exchange rate is watched more closely than my food inventory, gas stock or even reservation sheet. I have alerts on my laptop and I-phone when rates either hit certain points or there are wild swings in currency exchanges. I watch the rate easily 10 times a day. I also watch oil prices as the Canadian dollar is very much tied to oil. When oil drops so does the CN $. I keep large amounts of cash in both currencies in the bank (when I can). When rates change for the better I can't get to the computer fast enough to move currency. Miss a blip (a month ago the US dollar shot up to over 1.04 for 18 hours) and that can add up to thousands of dollars. I know of operators that buy currency contracts to lock in set prices (just like airlines do with fuel) to try and minimize risk. Who would have thought one would have to be an investment banker to run an international lodge...... That being said, once the season starts expenses hit that have to be paid and there is little luxury to wait it out. So if you have a $10,000 gas bill due and the rate is down 2% there is little one can do but bite the bullet. Another fun piece is that the bulk of one's revenue comes in the summer months. So yes, it was great when the dollar surged last winter, but many of us sat with our hands in our laps as there was no money to exchange to get the better rates. A fisherman can take a hit if it fluctuates, but that hit is temporary, or for a week for a set amount of money. A lodge can get crushed over the course of a summer. Last year the US dollar was on average LESS than 6% versus the Loonie. That 6% equates to huge money for some operators. That is money that just simply disappears and is never recoverable. Bookings can be up 5% for the year but in fact you have lost money, all because of an international border. There are many ways operators try to not get burned here. Credit cards are popular (allowing you to float interest free loans), international money brokers give very good rates, buying currency contracts, even hoarding cash and trying to time the market. But honestly, once the season starts the options are few, timing is critical and you are at the mercy of the global economy. I feel the fisherman's pain for sure. But just know we feel it 10 times as much. It can be pretty disheartening watching those new boat orders get cancelled not because we don't have the fishermen, but because an exchange rate has tumbled and our money is literally up in smoke. Have a great season guys. Fisherman Ted"
1442022,erieangler,2012-05-29 10:18:00,57,"I agree that 5% is a fair rate from local merchants right now. If you traval up north enough, you will learn which vendors give you a fair rate no matter which way the exchange is going. I do the same trip each yr and have learned the places to avoid (fool me once, shame on you)"
1442419,BennieS,2012-05-29 21:37:00,108,"I'll willing pay a little more to an independent store owner in Canada than get ripped on the ""service fees"" charged by many US Banks for currency exchange. Some of the numbers I've been quoted contain not only ""service charges"", but FREIGHT as well. What a steaming pantload I thought to myself as the poor bank clerk tried to figure out the look on my face as I said, ""good day"", and turned and walked away."
1442436,Mike Borger,2012-05-30 03:37:00,1554,This is true and a fact that those who complain perhaps aren't aware of.
1441628,JJJMN,2012-05-28 13:22:00,153,Heads up: Exchange rate US to Canadian not always 1 to 1. We ran into some great places last week that had a Dollar is a Dollar attitude. But then we found some stores that were charging 5% to 10% conversion on US to Canadian. If you buy supplies or gas either use credit card or have US converted at boarder. Bank of America charged me $0.85 for licenses purchase of $28.00 at visitor's center at Pigeon River. The same place was going to charge 10% conversion for US dollars. I would like to start a thread for listing those stores we run into that are giving Fair Trade. Would that be against web site policy?
1441680,octanehi5,2012-05-28 15:32:00,1104,"The best trade for your US $ is at the boarder, we buy nothing in Canada in US $, and if you do buy gas credit card is the way to go. The exchange rate changes daily. We pay our outfitter in Quebec in Canadian $ The banks are killing them when they convert US $ over to Canadian. Do not blame the Canadians its our wonderful government is the reason why the US $ is in the tank. I remember the good oll days when we got $1.50 for a US $ one they elected Bush its bin all down hill"
1441681,Freytown,2012-05-28 15:34:00,770,"http://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/exc...ily-converter/Current rate is US$ 1.00 = CA$ 1.02. I agree, exchange at the border."

1441717,HeHooksHimself,2012-05-28 16:43:00,725,"In all fairness, Octane, there is a lot more to it than the election of George Bush. It might have had something to do with Barney Frank and Chris Dodd pushing for mortgages for those least able to repay them until they folded Fannie and Freddie. It might have something to do with Obama printing money endlessly that has no value. If you want to squabble politics this is the wrong forum. In the spirit of the original intent of this thread we were up last week and found most places charging about 10%. It is the banks that get the Canadians with the price they charge for conversion. I agree that credit cards are the way to go if the exchange rate is the issue. We just buy most of our stuff in the US and the few cents extra it costs us to eat is no big deal."
1441718,Shellback,2012-05-28 16:45:00,8083,"I think it's due to giving credit, or too much credit to folks that didn't deserve it, and politicians that thought everyone should own a house. The Canadian dollar is stronger because they kept the strict limits on credit."
1441719,Shellback,2012-05-28 16:49:00,8083,"I swap dollars with my Canadian friend. He likes to keep some American cash for going to the states. Even though the Canadian dollar is more, by the time the bank gets their cut, he will lose money if he changes at his bank."
1441736,DMRIT,2012-05-28 17:26:00,9,It really annoyes me when you people complain about the exchange rate. So you lose a few cents on the dollar stay home because you can afford to go. There were hoards of Americans up here when the dollar was $ 1.50 to our dollar and just laughing because it was such a steal. TOO bad suck it up up. Like you really add to the economy you bring your own food and booze all you buy is gas WOW. AND STILL COMPLAINE IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE.

1441883,J-Man,2012-05-29 06:44:00,191,"The B of C converter is not a good representation of normal bank rates of exchange. They seem to list rates that only institutional investors and massive amounts of cash can receive. We bank with RBC and this is their curreny conversion page with up-to-date rates for both buying and selling. Notice how they buy US dollars are a much different rate than they sell US dollars. http://www.rbcroyalbank.com/RBC:S5AS...cashrates.htmlAs of 7-30am this morning the rates for....taking USD to the bank to exchange for CDN is $1 USD = $0.9946 CDN andtaking CDN to the bank to exchange for USD is $1 CDN = $1.0479 CDN.If you took $100 to the bank and exchanged it back and forth all day, you'd run out of money before lunch because they make money each time they exchange it. Also note that credit cards ARE NOT necessarily the best rate because pretty much every card gives you the above rates depending on which way you go, plus they charge another 2-3% premium as a foreign exchange fee despite it being a paperless transaction.With our current exchange rate in the office of $1USD = $.098 CDN...we are better than any credit card rate UNLESS they do not charge you the foreign exchange service fee. IMO, anyone charging more than 5% for exchange rates right now is ripping people off, plain and simple. Anything up to 5% is merely offering a reasonable rate for the convenience of paying with your own home currency. Do your homework before your trip so you aren't taken advantage of, but don't expect to get Bank of Canada rates (or USA today quoted rates or other published rates) anywhere....even a bank branch as they are not an accurate depiction of what small businesses will receive then they do their banking."
