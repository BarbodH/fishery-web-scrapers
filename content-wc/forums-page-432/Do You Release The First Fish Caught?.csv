1444416,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-03 20:48:00,235,"We usually release the first fish because we know we will catch numerous more eaters throughout the day. We fish fly in outpost lakes, so we don't have a live well and they usually die on the stinger after several hours (especially if we pull it up to move). About two or three hours before dinner, we start to look for the perfect eating size fish."
1444614,labsrus,2012-06-04 11:09:00,557,"Always release the first one, a tradition that my Dad started with me. Evne on short trips around home we would do that. I continue it to this day."
1444619,jambi,2012-06-04 11:29:00,504,Ditto - same as Ten Horse J
1444872,trapperbob,2012-06-04 20:30:00,45,"We always release the first walleye with the saying "" tell your friends to come on over we will be here all week."" Seems to always work for us."
1444934,btmbncr,2012-06-05 00:47:00,492,My father hated to release the first walleye unless it was really small.It causes bad JuJu.
1445064,camp chef,2012-06-05 08:42:00,915,We release them all.....seems to bring good JuJu for us...
1445141,johnboat,2012-06-05 10:40:00,2014,Always. Every day.
1444077,Rivratz,2012-06-02 22:11:00,105,"As a token of good luck, and a way to give back to nature, ""Do You Release The First Fish Caught"" of your trip. Meaning your first fish, not the boats first fish. Do you have a good luck ritual? Or is it just silly superstition? Does fishing for you have some type of spiritual cleansing? Enquiring minds would like to know?"
1444082,adempsey,2012-06-02 22:38:00,963,"Yes, but it's doesn't have anything to do with what you mentioned. I am just too lazy to clean them on the first night."
1444093,wallydave,2012-06-03 04:20:00,2151,"We usually release the first fish, if its a walleye we might give it a kiss and say ""thanks for playing our game"", and then "" send your big brother"" !! Pike are almost always released, unless it is a big one, no fan fare!Putting the first fish back is not a spiritual cleansing, but their is something very gratifying about the whole Canadian experiance, at least for me! Just something about getting away. Sure its vacation, but the beauty, solitude and the interactions with the group that bring a sense of peace! I started going for the adventure and the fishing, but now it means just a little more than that!"
1444206,twobearlake,2012-06-03 11:49:00,379,Always do.
1444211,Warrior56215,2012-06-03 12:16:00,46,Absolutely. If it's a rock bass!
1444231,jimmie,2012-06-03 13:41:00,123,Yes and also the 499th and all in between. You can thank me later or better yet your grandchildren! I don't keep fish as I have no live well and don't like dragging them around all day. I like to fish and yes love to eat 'em too but I'd rather go back year after year and catch some when they have grown up. I don't begrudge anyone keeping their limit or having a great shore luch. That is part of the adventure and a wonderful experience. The DNR's and Resources of most provinces and staes have done a good job in fish management to the advantage of all. Just please read your fishing guides no matter where you fish to help protect the fish and your wallet too. Have a great fishy summer.
1444238,lcwhit,2012-06-03 14:16:00,104,"ditto jimmie, i keep a walleye if its gill hooked. bet i haven't kept 3 fish in 10 years on lac seul."
1444251,Bigstorm,2012-06-03 14:44:00,799,"We usually throw all fish caught during the monring back on each day, no sense in letting them bounce around in the livewell until we clean them at the end of the day for dinner. Never had a problem caughting a few for dinner late in the day"
1444254,bigwalleye1,2012-06-03 14:59:00,2632,"Lots of rituals: 1. Kiss and release the first fish of the trip. 2. Bring new rods up and give 'em a quick dip to ""baptize"" them in the water for which they were built 3. Two Canadian pennies tossed over the opposite shoulder and over the stern while facing the bow to ask for safe passage on the water. Old sailor's tradition. 4. NO BANANAS IN THE BOAT."
1444391,birddogger,2012-06-03 19:56:00,43,"We always release the first walleye of the season on LOTW in memory of Alex Gibbons, a guide who passed away a few years back. I was told he asked a friend in his last few days to release the first walleye of the season for him. This tradition will continue on,he was a great man."
