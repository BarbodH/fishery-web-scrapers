Nice people, good boats - we are back there this Memorial Day for a week.Walleye were plentyful, but try the smallmouths - WOW!!!"
511939,Guest,2001-04-28 11:29:00,0,"since i last posted my reply, i have received a map of halleys and the umfreville lake area. also, if your really interested in watching someone fishing this lake and staying at HALLEY""S camp, you can watch the BABE WINKLEMAN show ""GOOD FISHING"" on the outdoor channel this monday night at 10:00 pm. i saw his show last week and he said he was going to fish the english river, they showed a preview and he was in a boat that had HALLEY""S camp written on it. im looking forward to it and plan to watch."
