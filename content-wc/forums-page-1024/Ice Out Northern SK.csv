512032,Guest,2001-04-17 06:59:00,0,What's happening up near La Ronge? I have a trip booked for the end of May and have heard that the ice is still 3 - 4 feet thick up that way right now... is ice out gonna happen before I get there?
512033,Guest,2001-04-17 16:25:00,0,"Relax !! I'm in s,toon and the local lakes are still ice, end of may, La Ronge - dress for COLD weather (hope not)could be nice!, fishing should be good but the ice will not have been off long. fishing for what??"
512034,Guest,2001-04-17 18:36:00,0,"Relax? man... I'm itching right now! Closed season here in AB until May 8, plus still ice around here too.Fishing for 'Eyes, Pike, and hopefully some Lakers (never having fished them before, I have to give it a go!)Cold never bothered me.. prefer it to the heat anyway. I guess I could always go golfing... <GRIN>"
512035,Guest,2001-04-20 13:15:00,0,"I'm in saskatoon, four hours south of la ronge. my family has a cabin up there. ice is rarely out before may long weekend (this year may 21). it's almost always out by june 1. walleye fishing may be slow, the water's pretty cold, and many won't be back from spawning. however, the lake trout will still be shallow. also, you're close to dozens of smaller lakes. ask the locals, they'll often tell you where fish are."
512036,Guest,2001-04-21 21:59:00,0,"I was driving my 1/2 ton truck on the ice at Flin Flon on April 15. The ice was still about 32 "", but it has started to warmup so it should be fine for end of May. As long as we do not get another cold snap. That same weekend it was getting down to -17 degrees celcius. I will post back here on about the 10 May and let you know."
512037,Guest,2001-04-23 08:34:00,0,"Thanks guys... I appreciate the responses. Sure hope i didn't book too early, but I figured that was about the best time. Thought for sure the 'eyes would be returned (or returning) from spawn right about then. Bad winter though. Oh well.. never having fished for Lakers before, it should be fun. And with any luck, the Northerns will be active...Thanks again."

512040,Guest,2001-05-11 05:50:00,0,Just got an e-mail from the owner of the lodge I am staying at - the ice is off the lakes in the La Ronge region right now.
