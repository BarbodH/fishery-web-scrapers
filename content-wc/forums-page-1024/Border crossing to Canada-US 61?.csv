I have never been this way but my wife and I thought it would be nice to show our daughter ""Lake Superior""... I have heard this is a nice drive, but I have no idea what to expect. I have no idea the ins or outs of crossing into Canada at this location. I have crossed at International Falls for many years, but just need some information. Is the best time to cross early in the morning or early aftenoon? If anyone can help with directions at the crossing to get to 17 East with out going into to the heart of Thunderbay I thank you in advance for your assistance...Thanks,Walley"

There is a tourist information center located 100yds across the border. It is open during daylight hours. If you can, budget some time to spend in Grand Marias, MN. Have lunch at Sven & Ole's. This is the best pizza you may eat in your lifetime. HWY 17 is the only way you can go east in Canada from Thurnder Bay. Follow Hwy 61 into Thunder Bay and look for the signs. If you get far enough east, stop at Packwash Provincial Park. TGG"
