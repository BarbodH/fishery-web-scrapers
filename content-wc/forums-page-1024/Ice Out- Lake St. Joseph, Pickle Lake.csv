512301,Guest,2001-05-07 03:29:00,0,We're planning to fish on St. Joe's the last week of May. Any idea of ice out conditions? Input much appreciated.
512302,Guest,2001-05-08 13:49:00,0,You can check with John at 1-807-928-2802. He owns the Old Post there. I think that is a Toronto number. I've been there many times and cancelled 2 trips late May with milder winters than this due to ice. Maybe bring a shelter and short rods. Good luck.
512303,Guest,2001-05-08 13:58:00,0,Also watch out for rocks and check out walleye point for walleyes of course and Matapesatakun bay remote northern most edge. We caught 33 to 45 inch northerns and could not keep them off the hook. Don't put your hands in the water good luck.
