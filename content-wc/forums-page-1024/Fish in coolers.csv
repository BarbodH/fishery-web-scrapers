512296,RMB,2001-05-06 20:00:00,251,Was just speaking with a fellow today who said that this year in Ontario there will be a rule change in regard to live fish in the boat. It has been illegle to keep a live fish on board in the past and one has always had to kill them to keep them. It's my understanding that now you can keep fish in a cooler (on ice without water)without having to kill them so they keep longer. You just can't have them in your livewell. Is this true? Seems like it would be no different if you used your livewell as a cooler as long as you don't put water in it. Does anyone know?

Its the limit that matters only sixor what ever the limit in the area is no matter where they are cooler, livewell, freezer, etc. I have been stopped by MNR while fish in livewell and no problem itis the limit."

512299,Guest,2001-05-07 02:54:00,0,I have never heard of this rule as a general rule. There are a few lakes where you either have to keep or kill the fish...Lake Nipigon is one of them and has a no stringer rule. They want to eliminate culling of fish in Lake Nipigons case it is to protect trout.

We have a ""Dead fish"" rule that states that you can not possess live game fish. Where you keep these fish is up to you; we suggest to our guests that they ice the fish in ther ""Dead Wells"" or if the boat does not have a live well to use a cooler with ice. This is a bit of a hassel at first, but most of our guests are real happy with the better condition of there fish and better quality fillets.There may well be outer lakes that have adopted similar regs to protect fish from culling."
