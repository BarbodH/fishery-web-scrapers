512349,Guest,2001-05-08 08:38:00,0,I am looking for ideas on a quick trip to Canada. I live an hour away from Sault St Marie. I usually go to up to Robinson lake but my marine patrol job is going to kill that trip. I would really appreciate any Suggestions!!! I only want to go a hour to two hours into canada!
