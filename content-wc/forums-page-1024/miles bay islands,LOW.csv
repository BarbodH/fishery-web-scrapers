Any help appreciated!!"

These are available at the store in Morson, or from most of the camps, but don't count on them having enough. They may have only a few permits, and they are somewhat pricy ($10/day/person?), the dates are inked in , so it takes a while to fill out. Good luck, camping is a great way to go, if everyone understands what it entails. Bill"
