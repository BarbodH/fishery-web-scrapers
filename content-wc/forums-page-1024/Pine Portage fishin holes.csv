511636,Guest,2001-03-22 19:54:00,0,My son and I are going to Pine Portage on Kaby the first week of June. Looking for any suggestions and hints to find good fishing holes and what to expect there. Any suggestions would be appreciated.Tight Lines..........
511637,Ketchenanny,2001-03-23 14:36:00,38,"I will be flying into Kaby Lodge (5th year in a row) the last week of May. Best suggestion is if this is your first time on Kaby Lake, get yourself a guide for at least the first day (its worth it just for the shore lunch he will make) and take lots of notes. Pine Portage & Kaby Lodge are both owned by the Wilson family. They will give you a good map of the lake. Also good idea to ask questions of the other fisherman in camp. Late May early June try the mouth of the Oba river with jigs. Also the map will show the weed beds, jig just outside of them or cast small body baits just above the weeds. What ever you do, stay shallow. We jig in water 3 to 10 feet deep, never deeper. Good time of the year, but to be safe, be prepared for black flies and mosquitos. It all depends if the warm weather hits."

Southwest of the lodge is Cow Island, jig the dropoff on the east side. There is a rock pile south and east of the lodge, on the map they call it the walleye triangle, drift thru those rocks and pitch jigs. Take a portable depthfinder if you can. Make sure to stop into Youngs General Store in Wawa, great summer sausage."

Weeds should not be to the surface when you are there yet, so it might be hard to find the weed line. Cast or troll, your choice. The eyes are feeding in the weeds with deep water in close proximity."

511641,Ketchenanny,2001-05-06 13:53:00,38,I just noticed that they have added lake maps to their web site. 23 day's and counting & I will be at Kaby Lodge. www.fly-in-fishing.com
