512347,Guest,2001-05-08 07:01:00,0,I'm headed up to Rainy Lake the second week in June (near the Thunderbird Resort). I haven't been up there that early in the season before. Is it mostly a minnow bite at that time of year? Should I still bring night crawlers? Any other suggestions/tips would be appreciated.

It just depends on what depth you fish. 6 to 20 feet of water, I would use minnows. Anything deeper than that is a toss up! Use lindy rigs with leeches and crawlers, jigs with minnows. If you fish the Canadian side, I strongly recommend fishing the mouth of the Seine river. (Jigs and minnows) That time of year can be DYNAMITE! Make sure your minnows are dead before crossing the border. Live bait in Canada is a $255 fine if transported from MN. Hope I was some help. Best of luck to you!Guide"
