A big duty free sign next to it so you can't miss it. Opens at 8am and has good selection of alcohol, cigarettes. The pickup point is a liittle shed just as you start onto the bridge."

512374,BD,2001-05-10 04:07:00,739,There is an AMEX exchange place in the location mentioned. Looks like it was a gas station at one time. AMEX has specials on brew once in a while (buy five cases of Blue for the price of four etc). Remember you must declare that duty free beer! I believe Border Bob's is in the next building.
