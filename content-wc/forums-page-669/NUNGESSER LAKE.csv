When I started taking my own boat we wanted a drive in lake and switched to Gullrock. Nungesser was a relatively easy lake to fish with a good Walley and Northern population. Lots of rocky points and the walleye related to that structure. When we went, there were only two lodges on the lake and not alot of competition. The ride in, up the Nungesser river, was always a high point of the trip. Good choice and I'll bet you'll enjoy the trip. Which lodge have you chosen?"

562854,Guest,2007-01-17 14:02:00,0,"I HAVE BEEN TO NUNGESSER...IT WAS LATE JUNE OF 03. WE HAD A NICE TIME, THE WEATHER WAS REALLY HOT THOUGH, WHICH AFFECTED THE PIKE FISHING A LITTLE. WE STILL MANAGED A COUPLE TROPHIES AND NUMEROUS OVER 33"". WALLEYE WERE EASY TO FIND ....BACK SIDES OF ISLANDS,& ""THE WALL"" MY MAIN COMPLAINT OF THE LAKE (WHICH IS NOT REALLY A COMPLAINT) IS WHEN THE WEATHER BLOWS UP - IT CAN BE TOUGH TO GET AROUND...A LOT OF CHOP. WE STAYED AT NUNGESSER LAKE LODGE WITH CHAD AND TONYA. GREAT HOSTS. BEEN TO LITTLE V QUITE A BIT.... IF I HAD TO COMPARE THE TWO ON MY LIMITED EXPERIENCE ON NUNGESSER- I WOULD SAY LITTLE V HAS A BETTER POPULATION OF TROPHY PIKE. WHILE NUNGESSER HAS A MUCH BETTER POPULATON OF TROPHY EYES. LITTLE V HAS A MILLION EYES- JUST NOT REAL BIG ONES EH? IF YOU HAVE ANYMORE QUESTIONS EMAIL ME AT:[email protected]"
562869,Guest,2007-01-17 23:07:00,0,"Been going to Birchpoint camp for around 10 years. Always pretty solid numbers of Walleye. Size varies thru the years. Northerns seem to be spotty, but when they are on we seem to catch the biggest fish while going for walleye. We usually hit east bay once during the week. Same fishing, just a change of scenery. Bring 2 tanks of gas! My best advice is to fish the wind. The more nasty the chop, the better the fishing. The walleye tend to hold out for live bait. Good luck."
562886,Guest,2007-01-19 09:48:00,0,"I have been to Nungesser several times, from spring to fall. The first week of June if the fish are in the river on the East end of the lake, it will be worth the hour boat ride. Chad will know what's going on. Things can change fast depending on the weather. If they have left the river then work the classical type points."
