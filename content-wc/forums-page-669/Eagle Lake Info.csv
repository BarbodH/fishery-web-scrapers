We have never been on eagle lake, and are looking forward to going. This lake is larger then the lake we have fished in previous years. I am looking for some information from people who have fished here before. I am looked though previous posts and have found some good information, but I am still looking for more and maybe a little bit newer. Any information would be greatly appreciated. We are going the second week in july if that is any help."

562984,Guest,2007-01-25 20:13:00,0,"I agree with the other poster. July is tough fishing. You will still catch lots, but not the big numbers and quality fish you see in Spring/Fall. I would also recommend a guide for a couple days just to show you to the areas of the lake that are productive at that time of the season. Drink, Fish, and be Merry!"

If your looking for walleye look for the reefs out in the middle of lake directly out from temple bay. I believe it is called Viking reef. It's a big lake so a guide is not a bad idea, especially when wind is whipping. Very important... as you go near stanton island the area is full of large unmarked rocks. Go slow, and be careful until you are well past it. Lots of lost lower units there. I will be up in canada for the opener, and like lots of you I am counting the days. Walleye opener is under 4 mos now! Musky opener in 5 mos! Best of luck."
562989,Guest,2007-01-25 21:24:00,0,Temple Bay also offers guided 1 day trips to Lac Suel. Something to remember if the fishing is slow on Eagle. Best Fishes ! ggg2
