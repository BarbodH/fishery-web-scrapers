562922,Guest,2007-01-21 21:49:00,0,"We've been going to the area north of Minaki for over the past 20 year, usually for at least 2 weeks a year. We've motored past the lodge numerous times. The area has picked up for musky over the past 5 years or so. Walleye fishing is down a bit over the past few years (size and numbers), but we still manage to get our fill. Smallmouth and northern have signifiantly picked up, with some very nice action over the past 3 years or so. The narrows leading into Rough Rock and the channel area leading to the dam are always good for nice walleye, as well as several of the reefs and submerged rockpiles in Rough Rock. However, we think there's better walley and smallmouth action in Big Sand, Little Sand and parts of the river. Chuck"
562942,Guest,2007-01-23 15:59:00,0,I can't comment on the fishing however I met the owner this year at a sport show and he is one heck of a guy.
562943,voyaguer,2007-01-23 16:35:00,54,"I was there last June. Exceptional facilities, boats etc. The owner operators are very accomodating. I've been to quite a few places in NW Ontario and from a facilities and personnel standpoint, Rough Rock is about as good as you can get. Early June was not great for walleyes, but we were there during the mayfly hatch and that's generally not real good to begin with. I expected to see more pressure and did not see that many other people. The only cluster we came across was in the narrowns leading up from Sand into RR. Rough Rock is the only real tourist lodge I could see anywhere on the lake, although there are several private facilities scattered about. Based on how there water and structure looks like, I have to think there are good populations of walleye there. Largest we caught was about 20+"". I hadn't fished for muskie much in the past, but what I saw while fishing for other species made me aware that there are large muskies a Rough Rock, more than I've seen at Eagle, LOW and a few others. While fishing for bass and northern, I caught a couple out of season, and released them live and well. (even took a picture of one and it didn't die from it - Muskie Nut) If it had been in season, I would have really gone after them specfically. Going in July is likely better for walleye. If you go, ask John to show you how to navigate the river north of the camp. It has the best looking territory to me and we did ok up there. Another thing, we briefly tested the waters for suspended walleyes with crank baits, planer boards etc and were successful - now wish we had done more of that. Parsons and Kavejiec (sp) have that down pat so look at their techniques. good luck V"
