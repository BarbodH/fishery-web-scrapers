I lurk all year long, just haven't posted in a while - it's getting mid-winter, and we're well underway into our June fishing trip to the nort-woods. Years gone by, we've stayed near Hudson/SiouxLookout and fished the Southern part of Lac Seul. This year, we have 5-6 days on the big lake near Ear Falls, staying at GoldPines:www.goldpines.com Anyone have suggestions for us while at this lodge? Things to do in Ear Falls (when not fishing, IE night-life/bars/bands/restaurants)? Also looking for tips (not secret info, I know how some of you guys can be :) ) on fishing, fish patterns at that time, hot baits...etc. I know we'll be doing the 'fish the wind blown shores, fish points, find and fish holes, quick dropoffs...etc.', but any other advice. See ya guys."

Just don't think about doing it at sundown, the mosquitoes will eat you alive. Take a day trip up the road to Red Lake and have lunch at the Howey Bay restaurant. Maybe check out the tackle shop up the street from the burned out MNR building. Go over to the dump located on the road going to Balmertown. You can check out the bears. There is an indian cemetery down the road from camp. Just some of the things to do when you get boat butt."

The bears, eventhough at a dump and whatnot, would be great for pictures - Its not too often that I see a bear, actually the only time is when I'm in Canada (and that's IF I see one), so just to see them is pretty neat - as long as they stay out of my tent! And for the night we save our walleye for the freezer, I'll definetly check out that restaurant for dinner....a nice hot meal prepared for me, is what I'm all about! :)"
