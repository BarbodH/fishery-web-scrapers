562991,Trailerguy,2007-01-25 22:35:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I haven't seen the new regulations yet, but 1 kid could fish under 1 adults licince in the past, with anything they catch being part of the adults limit. BB guns are a poor idea, camp owners generally take a dim view of them. Too many broken windows and other things shot up, including those cute little chippys the lady in the next cabin was feeding. Ontario treats anything with more than 650 fps velocity as a firearm. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
562992,Guest,2007-01-26 05:39:00,0,"I dont see MNR giving a problem with 2 kids fishing under 1 adults licence. Trailerguy is right though, you can only keep YOUR limit of fish, they dont get seperate limits. If you want 3 limits,, buy them non-res lic's,, not worth it. BB guns are a bad idea. Anything over 500 fps is considerred a firearm in Canada. Customs may want you too register them at $25 a piece. Also there must be a legitimate reason too bring a firearm into Canada. ie, hunting, shooting competition, gun show.. something too play with while over here, will not be a sufficient reason."
562995,Guest,2007-01-26 07:19:00,0,"ericp 45694 Hey Eric, Hope 2007 is treating you well! ok here is the skinny... I would leave the PelletGuns @ home last thing you need is issues at the border... if your kids really want to use a pellet gun purchase a cheap one here (Canadian Tire) and dispose of it, dont try and bring it back to the US.... In terms of your kids fishing... It is a popular misconception that your kids fish under your license with any fish caught counting towards your limits this is simply UNTRUE... even though they dont have a license nor do they need one (Under 18) they have the same rights as anyone else with a Sports Fishing license and have to abide by its Rules and Regulations. Here is a direct linkhttp://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/pubmenu.html#fish Download the ""information section"" The information you are looking for is located on Page 1 concerning your children. and clearly states they fish useing our Sports License rules. Hope this helps! A Canuck"
562996,Guest,2007-01-26 07:24:00,0,Eric Looks like I made a mistake... Because you are a non-resident.... Your kids DO INFACT fish under your License However they are free to purchase their own.. Sorry my previous post referred to resident anglers.. My apoligies. A Canuck.
563015,Guest,2007-01-27 05:54:00,0,Thanks for the info. BB guns will stay home Eric
563020,Guest,2007-01-27 18:00:00,0,Spend the 10 bucks a peiece and get them a conservation liscense. Then you know you helped put something back to the fishery.
563021,Guest,2007-01-27 19:07:00,0,Good point Joe. Does'nt hurt to fund our MNR God knows they need all the help they can get. A Canuck.
