562792,Guest,2007-01-15 12:44:00,0,We usually stay at Lost Island when we go up to Lac Seul but they are already full for our planned week. Looking for other similar options and came across Timberlane. Has anyone stayed there before? Any comments positive or negative on the place? Would you recommend it or have any other places to recommend? Thanks ms
562796,Guest,2007-01-15 13:56:00,0,Decent camp. Decent boats. There are a couple of resorts right around the same area that are nicer. Evergreen is great and next door

There is good fishing right in the channel, by the railroad bridge and off the dock of Timberlane. This is nice because if the weather is rough, you can fish close by and not have to go out on the open water. Timberlane was OK, service fair, cabin was brand new when we stayed and only had plastic furniture (table and chairs) plywood floors, but now hopefully better equipped. Owners were pleasant, but your pretty much on your own. We had two guides reserved but one backed out. (had a large group) Had some problems with rental boat/motor. Golden Eagle owners where very friendly and very helpful, good service, cabins are older but adequate, good guiding. So I would rate Golden Eagle above Timberlane, but both would be a fine place to stay. Evergreen Resort is also in same channel, newer cabins, nice boats, but never stayed there yet. Also, Golden Fawn Resort is right there too at the start of the English River. It is currently for sale. Have read mixed reviews on this site about that resort. Never stayed there, but it is in the same area. Gold Pines Resort is also in the same area, and have read good reviews on this site about that place. Hope this Helps. Happy Fishin! :) rather-be-fishin"

562855,Guest,2007-01-17 14:13:00,0,"Hi. we have not been to lac saul for the last 5 years but stayed at timberlane about 15 years and it was not bad, golden fawn after that for about 5, that was pretty nice. lac saul lodge 3 times that was nice. the price was always pretty good at these places. never stayed at evergreen. they did yell at us once for fishing in the little channel that goes by their place. the water was higher and it had fish in it then.. now we go to tobin lake in saschatchawan."
562890,Guest,2007-01-19 13:39:00,0,"Thanks guys! They have space available so we booked them. Owners seemed nice over the phone. Our only guide will be a Navionics chip, but I think we can find fish in that lake!;-) Matt"
562929,Guest,2007-01-22 12:58:00,0,"You cant hardly go wrong, I stay at Evergreen... It's a great area, you will catch fish, although last year was tougher than most, but still 30 - 40 per guy per day (just a guess) A friend has been staying at Timberlane for years and likes it, like the owners, I guess they had a change in ownership about 5 years ago, someone correct me if I'm lying. The new owners are putting $$$ back into the camp. The big thing to me is being close to the fish everything else is just a bonus."
