562738,fishinnut,2007-01-12 19:55:00,642,I've had great success with white lures in Canada. White(pearl) senkos for bass White super vibrax spinners size 4 or 5 blade for smallies/pike Walleyes white twister tails on jigs Musky - I would have to throw a 9 inch Bulldawg color cisco; Very versatile lure that cover the whole water column. And you can't go wrong pulling a spinner and live bait for walleye.
562744,guide7,2007-01-12 22:25:00,70,"Lac Seul Walleye: White or pearl-orange Glow jig heads 1/4 & 3/8 oz tipped with white 3"" gulp minnow grub. All day baby!! Then speed troll the evening shallows with #5 & 7 fire tiger shad raps for a fun finish to a full day. With the dark colored water of Lac Seul I think it is important for the fishy to see my lure and expand the strike zone. Good Luck 7"
562752,guidedfishing,2007-01-13 11:49:00,531,"1/8 & 1/4 ounce jigs (gold,chartruese,orange) tipped with the live bait or plastic of your choice. #7 & #9 Firetiger & Blue Rapala husky jerk #7 shad rap Perch color Walley Diver or favorite banana bait Crawler harness without and with blades (same color as jigs) with corresponding 1 - 3 ounce bottom bouncers #5 Mepps musky killer with orange or yellow blade and similiar bucktail 1/2 to 1 ounce blade bait for vertical jigging lake trout and last but not least Slip bobbers good luck GF"
562760,Capn Hooker,2007-01-13 23:05:00,333,"In Canada, I've caught all 4 of those species on a pink jig with a white quad twister tail, and on a chartreuse #5 Shad-Rap shallow diver. For the third lure I would take the same Shad-Rap only in a deep diver."
562762,lobo1,2007-01-14 09:23:00,734,we only fish walleye and pike and this is our main (3) line up: jigs with white tails - I prefer metallic gold heads but my plain unpainted ones work almost as good (high quality lead is very shiny). I bring all my twisters with me so i can get rid of them in canada. If the bite is not too good I always use white scented ones like power bait or gulp but when it's hot i put on all those colors i bought for fishing at home that never seemed to work - they all catch fish in canada when the feed bag is on !! the big JSM's in 1 1/8 oz - you can tip these with twisters or for a long lasting affair use uncle josh pork strips in the musky size for a nice large presentation. firetiger bomber long A (similar to a rapala) - take the front hook off for sure and mash the barbs on the others. we catch so many fish on these that we changed out the split rings and hooks for better ones. I haven't been to a quality lake yet where these didn't work extremely well. of coarse on the very good lakes virtually anything works!! get em !! lobo1
562774,Pooch,2007-01-14 16:50:00,4619,"smallieman53 From all the different responses I'd guess that about anything you take will be the ""hot"" bait for any given day. Bottom bouncers or Lindy rigs and spinners. (Way too many choices here) Jig and minnows/leeches/crawler halves. Trolled and cast crankbaits (black over gold my over all favorite) Spoons with gold and silver backs. (gold gets my nod) Every bait listed above will catch walleye and northern. We catch a lot of pretty decent northerns pulling spinner rigs for walleye. AND we sacrifice quite a few spinner rigs to northerns while fishing for walleye! Pooch"
562867,Steve CO,2007-01-17 21:54:00,267,"We go third week of June when smallies are busting topwaters: fly rod poppers/pop-Rs; #3-4 Mepps and Vibrax Pike: hot ticket last 2 years was 3/8 oz jig head with green-yellow 4"" sassy shad (look like perch?); also #5 Mepps, #5-6 Vibrax (I like fluorescent red) with bucktails for bulk Walleye- jig and Gulp grub; Ripshads for trolling"

562702,smallieman53,2007-01-11 16:18:00,11,"New member and looking for ideas on what guys would use as ""go-to-baits"" if they were restricted to three baits/lures for each of the following species: Walleye: Smallmouth: Muskie: Northern: I am a big tube guy for smallies, spoons for muskie/northern, and live bait for walleye. Pretty novice fisherman so I am looking for assistance. Thank you in advance for any helpful tips."
562703,Guest,2007-01-11 16:41:00,0,"Here are my choices: Walleye: 3/16 to 3/8 oz round jig head with black 3"" Gulp Leech, Linde Rig w/ hammered copper spinner blade with live leech, and #9 shad rap in baby bass color Smallmouth: green pumpkin 3-1/2 to 4"" tube, 1/4 to 3/8 oz shad colored chatterbait with yellow twister tail trailer, and 1/4 oz Rebel pop-r in baby bass color Muskie: #5 gold mepps, 3/8-1/2 oz black with bright orange blades spinnerbait, and 1/2 oz perch colored chatterbait with 4"" shad colored plastic minnow for trailer. Northern: 1/4-3/8 oz perch colored Stanley Wedge tandem willow blade spinnerbait, #3 copper colored Mepps, 1/4-3/8 oz perch colored chatterbait with 3"" white twistertail trailer Chuck"
562705,smallieman53,2007-01-11 17:14:00,11,Thank you for the helpful list Chuck. I am going up to Mintaki in June and will post how I did and with baits. It is always helpful and encouraging when others share their thoughts and opinions.
562706,phishfearme,2007-01-11 17:27:00,1242,"smallie - when we first started doing fly-in trips maybe 25 years ago or so, we used to each bring tackle boxes that looked like suitcaese packed with all kinds of lures in all kinds of sizes in all kinds of colors. now, it's quite abit different - 1/4 oz jigs with white or yellow 3"" twisters and johnson's silver spoons tipped with a twister is about all we bring for walleye and pike. some steel leaders are useful also. if i had to pick a third lure, it would be something like a shad-rap which work for smallies also. have a great trip. phish"
562720,Guest,2007-01-12 11:21:00,0,"we go to LOTW the 1st part of June primarily for smallmouth but fish for everything. generically we try and use baits that will catch everything...spinnerbaits,rattletraps,etc. Northern: white or chartruese depending on weather/water color Walleye: jig/minnow(I am not a walley fishermen but don't try and overthink them). We also catch them casting for bass on rattletraps,crankbaits,etc. smallmouth: best advice would be to fish the conditions just like at home....if it is windy, spinnerabit. early or calm throw a topwater like pop-r,little spook. The best advice I have for smallmouths is to fish smaller chunk rock from peagravel to basketball sized. The smooth cliff type rocks do not hold smallmouths in any numbers. We have also had pretty good luck fishing laydowns for the smallmouths. muskie: we don't target them but have caught them on the above baits(spinnerbaits/rattletraps) just by casting."

562722,Guest,2007-01-12 12:20:00,0,"For Northerns I take a buzzbait, a red and white daredevil, and a Johnson Silver Minnow. For Walleyes, a 3/8th black jig head and 3"" Black Minnow Grub Gulp."
562727,Guest,2007-01-12 16:23:00,0,"This nearly happened to me last year as my tackle box got left at my dad's house in Illinois (don't ask). Walleyes: Firetiger or Gold Shad Rap. Crawler harness gold or chartreuse, 1/4 oz jig/tail chartreuse. Northern: Large Spinner Bait: gold blade/flo orange/chart tail. 4"" Spoon: red/white or flo orange/gold. #11 or 13 Husky Jerk, Tenn Shad. Smallmouth: #7 shad rap, gold. #7-#9 Husky Jerk, Tenn Shad. Rebel crawfish crankbait. Also, I'd hate to be caught without a handful of slip floats, a half flat of worms, and 50 #2 or #4 hooks for smallies and walleyes and perch fry night."
