Lodge is located on Attitti Lake, and they fish 7 other lakes as well. It is currently operated by Curt and Juanita Enns. They also run Kississing Lake Lodge in Manitoba. Has anyone on WC been to Deer Horn, and can you tell me anything about their lakes and fishing, as well as their operation, boats, motors etc. Thanks guys Mike"

562497,mikenewpal,2006-12-30 09:40:00,7,"Billy, Thanks for your reply. Can you tell me how the fishing was and how long ago you went there? We are especially interested in Walleye and Northern Thanks, Mike"
562505,Guest,2006-12-31 06:32:00,0,"I went to Kississing about 8 yrs ago for a September lake trout trip. Northern fishing was excellent with a bunch of high 30"" and low 40"" inch fish. We did a fly in to a walleye lake and caught 50-75 each. Nothing huge but lots of them. Curt keeps growing the business every year so he must be doing something right. Good luck and have fun! Bob"

562923,Guest,2007-01-21 21:55:00,0,Hey Guys I live in the same home town as Curt and Juanita and my wife worked for them and I have been up to kississing. They are great people and they will definitely take care of you. The pike and walleye fishing is absolutely great at both deerhorn and kississing. Lots of big pike come out of attitti each year along with good walleye and lake trout as well. Steve hoffman from In-Fisherman was up there a couple of years ago and said it is one of his favorite places to fish. If you decide to go I am sure you won't be disappointed. Andrew
