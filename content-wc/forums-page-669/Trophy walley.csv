563022,Guest,2007-01-27 19:14:00,0,I know there's lots of places but in my 17 years of guiding all over the place. Still there's no other better then Rainy River for thr Spring and Fall bite and you can always count on it at some point it will turn on. Some days you catch 100 the the next week you might catch 20 a day but they will all be big.
563024,Guest,2007-01-27 21:55:00,0,this is a loaded question :)) as opinions are like.... well you get the idea.... Hmmm if you are looking for a true Trophy then the Bay of Quinte is the place to be... 15+ lbs of Walleye goodness to take pictures of or have replicas made of or have a skin mount made. As for quantity.... LOW seems to be popular here but I might offer and alternative... Lake Nippissing specifically The West Arm. I Hope the boys from Ohio dont find me and kill me in my sleep for telling you this :D Good luck in your hunt. A Canuck.
563026,Guest,2007-01-27 22:56:00,0,I was out on Quinte today and dinged another over 12 pounds. Tons of fish over 10 pounds and I mean tons.
563029,Guest,2007-01-28 08:53:00,0,Yup... Quinte is a Walleye Factory! Just be sure the big ones are released and the little ones are for the pan. :D A Canuck
