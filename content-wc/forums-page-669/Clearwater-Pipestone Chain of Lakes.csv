Me, I will cross it and pay what they ask of me. It cost $16.00 in 1982. How much did your boat cost then? Sorry for the rant, now I must go fishing. Pipestone Ice-out trip is scheduled. Good Luck 7"
562859,brant,2007-01-17 16:37:00,89,"Has anyone fished these lakes and could give me reports. What does it cost to use the rail portages in-between the lakes. Our group of ten or so are planning to go there in early July and fish for walleye,musky,and lake trout. Any help advice is appreciated."
562864,Guest,2007-01-17 19:17:00,0,"The portage to Pipestone was $20 last year, should be around there for this year. The south portage was $15 if I remember correctly. Where are going to stay. Pipestone has some really good lake trout fishing and excellent muskie. It has pretty good numbers of walleye, not as easy to catch as some lakes, but big walleyes are fairly common with a good number of eaters. Being a trout lake it is better morning and evenings for the walleye. The lakes to the south are few more numbers of walleye, but not many big ones and alot more traffic as most camps send there guests there since the portage fee is less."
562875,brant,2007-01-18 11:44:00,89,"Thanks for the info. I believe we're staying on Clearwater at Little Moose Lodge for a week. Does anyone know what cigarettes cost in Canada. In the past, I've tipped guides with them and didn't know if that would be a fair trade for a portage fee. We are looking at going through the north and south portage a lot and that will dollar up fast. Is there a lot of lodges and crowds in the south portage lakes?"
562878,Guest,2007-01-18 21:01:00,0,"Cigareetes are expensive, but the people that run the portages prefer cash. The south portage lakes are fairly busy, but there are only 2 lodges located on Lake Despair and a few outpost cabins scattered through the lakes down there. There are a fair number of private cabinson those lakes though. Clearwater is nice as it is centrally located, but after you learn which direction you like, I would look for a camp on one of those lakes so you can avoid having the portage fees."
562880,River_eye,2007-01-18 21:06:00,1486,"correction on the pipestone portage, it went up to $25 this past summer."
562881,Guest,2007-01-18 22:05:00,0,"Pipestone portage fee varies on size of boat you use, so you must of used a bigger boat to be charge 25.00."
562883,guide7,2007-01-19 00:03:00,70,We stay at Pipestone lodge on Pipestone Lake and do well on the spring trout. In June / July you should find them 40-45 feet deep. If you have down riggers just set them up with raps and run the main lake near Green Island and Sand Point area. The walleye will be on the island rock beds and reefs. If you find one you will find a lot of nice ones. We paid $20.00 at the main portage for my 1850 Sportfish last spring. Can't get any better scenery than the glacier cut rocks of Pipestone!!!:rockit: Good Luck 7

In the fall of 2006, it was $25 for boats of all sizes, he must have changed it during the summer. I used the launch two times this past fall while living in Emo, 25 buckeroos each time, in my boat and in my buddy's boat, both 25 hp."
562965,Guest,2007-01-24 16:50:00,0,"odd, i was charged 20.00 for the Pipstone portage by Hal."
562966,River_eye,2007-01-24 16:53:00,1486,"What was the date? He still uses the same sign, but the $20 part is painted over now."
