563003,Old Critter,2007-01-26 11:40:00,14,"I fished Kabikwabik and Keikewabik 51 years ago. Stayed in a tar paper shack on Kabi. We used to portage in from the main lake with a 3 hp. There were two ways to get there. From Kabi to Keiki or a long portage staight to Keiki. There were no ouposts on either lake. Fishing was great in both lakes, good numbers and size. Sorry this reported is so old, but it's the best I can do with these lakes."
