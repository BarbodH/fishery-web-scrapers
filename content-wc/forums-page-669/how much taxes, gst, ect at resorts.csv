562784,Guest,2007-01-15 00:00:00,0,"yea i guess you are right, i just had a momentary senior moment, nevemind. sorry"
562790,uzzi,2007-01-15 11:47:00,349,"Hey Alan, if you think you're getting the snot taxed out of ya when you visit Canada (Saskatchewan), try living here! I think we spend over half of every year working to pay off our taxes (consumption tax, income tax, property tax, fuel tax.....bla, bla, bla....) Guess thats they way things have gone...I'm sure its no different for you where you live.......tax, tax and more of it!"
562876,Guest,2007-01-18 15:46:00,0,hi. yes your are probably right. we probably work for the government for the first 6 months of the year here. I just dont know how they get away with it when the majority of the folks here are maybe midddle class and down. we should be able to vote in a block and pass any law we want.????????????????

562696,Guest,2007-01-11 12:17:00,0,"It somewhat depends on whether your price includes tax. PST in Ontario is 8%, but PST often isn't added to your cost. GST is now 6% (was 7 until July 1 2006), and you use to get a 'Foreign Travel Rebate' on GST of 3% which the conservatives killed a few months ago (I believe it was in October). **You can still get the rebate for any travel in the upcoming year, IF AND ONLY IF you paid for your trip IN FULL before the date the change was announced (i.e., before that October 2006 date). If you only had a deposit down, you get nothing back, and of course the same holds true for anything into the future. If the conservatives stay in power another year (lets hope that's not the case), GST will likely go down to 5%, so you'll save another whopping $14 on your total trip cost, IF your trip is after July 1.

562731,Guest,2007-01-12 17:03:00,0,the additional taxes on americans is the cadadians way of saying STAY IN YOUR OWN #### COUNTRY AND LEAVE US ALONE!
562732,Guest,2007-01-12 17:08:00,0,>the additional taxes on americans is the cadadians way of >saying STAY IN YOUR OWN #### COUNTRY AND LEAVE US ALONE! What additional taxes on Americans are you referring to?
562733,uzzi,2007-01-12 17:12:00,349,"Hmmm, I'd like to know that one as well, if I go to the same resort as you, I still have to pay the same GST and PST (where applicable) as you get charged......no difference!"
562734,grt1,2007-01-12 17:39:00,259,"I guess the taxes I pay when I go south to the USA are the ones you charge canadians to make them stay home. Lets face it any government is going to charge taxes and they are not directed at any nationality, race or religion. They are always percieved as a money grab by the person paying them and we all gripe about them. So, don't take it personally, you'll live longer and happier. As far as staying home in the USA thats your decision but I wouldn't want you to blame the Canadian Government, remember they are just equal opportunity tax collectors."
