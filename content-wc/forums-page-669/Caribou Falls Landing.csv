They are looking for some new water and have their sites set on Halley's Camp, specifically the Caribou Falls Landing location. What can those of you familiar with this water share with me regarding the fishing? We have had exceptional luck at Grassy Narrows and my major concern is a new place that pales by comparison. Thanks in advance!"

Never have received such poor service-had to beg to be told where cabin was, ask for a map of lake. They wouldn't dream of pointing out a few spots.I could have been dead and they would have not cared."

It is a big body of water as you can see but is really diverse as far as fishing goes. We are always up there the week of Memorial day so it is early fishing. Walleyes are typically shallow and we catch many on crank baits which is what I prefer to fish. The jig fishing is good too but if you like to fish pike you will also catch walleyes in the process. Pike are plentiful with some 50 pike per guy days for my son and I. Lots in that 22-27 inch range, some in the low 30s and a few in the upper 30s and maybe one a guy per week in the low 40s. Our biggest Walleye each year is in the 28 to 29 inch range. The biggest pike for our group has been 44"". One year we also got into some lakers in ""tourist lake"" and that was a ball. Probably got a dozen or so up to about 27"". There is also some great smallmouth fishing there with 18 inch fish not uncommon. My son got a nice 19"" smallie last year and got into a bunch of them one afternoon all in the 12-18 inch range. We have found the service there to be fine. It's not the kind of place that someone will meet you on the dock each day when you go out and get back, and that's OK by us. We gave found Chris good at pointing out where the fish have been active. Hope this helps, Paul"
