562888,Guest,2007-01-19 12:42:00,0,Some friends of mine are getting married and are planning to honeymoon in Quebec City. They might like a few days fishing. Any suggestions for either a drive-in or fly-in place?

The Quebec City region is known as Charlevoix. Unfortunately, the outfitters in that region almost exclusively offer opportunities for speckled trout fishing. Here's the web reference: http://www.qof.ca/en/outfitters.find...me=Your+choice"

You can also fish for Smallmouth in the same river. It's something really different because you have to consider tides!! I was having lunch yesterday with one of my friend (he his in the army) and he his living in Quebec city; he was showing me some nice walleyes pics.

It would be ideal for them if they could stay in QC and go out with someone for a day or two. Can you get me contact info on either guides or your friend? I will also look for guides in QC myself, but it helps to have direct advice on who is good. if you prefer to send info by email instead of this forum, i am [email protected]. RSH8"
