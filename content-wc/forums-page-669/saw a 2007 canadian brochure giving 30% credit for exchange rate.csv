562751,Guest,2007-01-13 11:11:00,0,Would like to know more about this?
562755,Guest,2007-01-13 13:09:00,0,"2007 Rates at the Grassy Narrows Lodge U.S. dollars are worth more in Canada. All prices quoted in Canadian funds. Payment preferred in U.S. or Canadian Currency, Travelers Cheques, or Personal Cheques. Visa and Mastercard are also acceptable. There will be a 4 percent charge to handle credit cards. Approximate U.S. dollar amounts are based on an exchange rate of 30%. Actual amount will be determined by the premium available at time of payment."
562787,jerry bark,2007-01-15 08:55:00,822,"> Actual amount will be >determined by the premium available at time of payment. the 30% is an EXAMPLE, they have given US rates based on that example. you should expect more like a 10% exchange currently. so if their canadian rates is $100, the example on thier website likey shows $70 US. but since the exchange is more like 10% these days you will pay around $90 US. the short story is take any US dollar price on that site, multiply it by 9 and divide it by 7 and you will have a pretty good estimate of what you will pay this year. They should really update their site as this it is somewhat misleading, cheers jerry"
562866,Guest,2007-01-17 19:25:00,0,30% is not even close for exchange right now. Been afew days since I looked but holding around 10-15% lately.
