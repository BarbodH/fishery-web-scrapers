562999,Guest,2007-01-26 10:45:00,0,"Go to www.norealtyfee.com click on Vermillion Bay and it will pull up the properties listed with them. A better idea is to subscribe to the Dryden newspaper and look in the classifieds. In the paper there will also be ads for real estate brokers such as Austin and Austin, and latitude 50. www.latitude50.on.ca Finding one that an individual has listed in the classifieds is the best way to go. In this area real estate is going to be high, and trying to find an affordable remote fishing cottage on a lake that isn't already fished out is going to be quite a task. Most of the properties for sale will be on lakes where there are many other cottages, it all depends on what it is you are looking for and your price range, anyway, good luck."

I would also be happy to share what I know from having spent much time finding the right spot. If you want to post your e-mail in a secure fashion, I will get right back to you. Steve"
