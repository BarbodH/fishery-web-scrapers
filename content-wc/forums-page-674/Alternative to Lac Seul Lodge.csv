561807,Guest,2006-11-03 05:00:00,0,"Thanks to all who responded. It's funny but your views are exactly what my intuitions have been telling me. In fact, I am the one in our group who wants to stay and I am trying to convince the others of the wisdom of this. Does anyone have a suggestion for choosing a different lodge and fishing a different part of Lac Seul that would be just as good from a fish catching and quality of equipment perspective but might provide a change of pace for others in our group? We typically fish the very productive Bear Narrows and Japan Bay areas of the reservoir (which you might call the NE section?) Should we consider the NW section at a place like the Silver Water Wheel? How would it compare? Thanks again for the help."

561783,Guest,2006-10-31 21:31:00,0,I am looking for a recommendation for an alternative to Lac Seul where I have stayed at Anderson's Lodge and have fished in 21 foot bowriders with 115 HP for the last 4 years. Fishing has been consistently awesome but we need a change of pace. We would like to go to Northern Manitoba but can't find a lodge offering the comfort of larger boats that will hold parties of 4 comfortably and provide protection from elements (we have some 80 somethings in our group!). Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks.

I'll also bet the fishing is also better on Lac Seul also. Nice bigger boats with smooth rides in rougher waters, or getting your butt beat and innards shook up like an (organ)-ic milkshake in smaller less comfortable boats. I'd stick with what you know. Just my .02 cents. Good Luck, and Best Regards, Riveratz"

561800,Guest,2006-11-01 19:42:00,0,Our group had been going to Lac Seul for several years when we decided to make a change. We took the next four years and picked four different resorts that we had always looked at and we went to them. At the end of the four years we went back to Lac Seul. Lac Seul is a great value with great fishing....If you follow our example you should stay at Lac Seul. However we did enjoy the other places just not as much as Lac Seul.
