The sled shell is still on the shore. Just look for a load of boats jammed together is another way to locate it. When at 3 sisters motor north from green bouy to last rock formation (there has also been a log prodtruding at about the turning point for many years). 90 degree right turn and go til you about hit the shore. At that point you are there. Beware of the point coming out. There is some very nice structure in that area. By drifting across the point you will get into eyes & slimers. Bigger eyes tend to be out further in as much as 40', depending on weather & boat traffic. Working the first island as you out of Bear Narrows going toward skidoo is also very productive at just about anytime. Also easy to spot by the # of Anderson Camp guided boats there. Just drift west side."

561975,Guest,2006-11-16 08:53:00,0,"Going north out of Bear Narrows, toward Chambelain Narrows, the first thing you see to the east is a small island. Keep going north and the next point is Skidoo Point, just east of Three Sisters. If you would turn east prior to getting to Skidoo Pt. you would go to Kekabeka Outpost."
