561974,Hump,2006-11-16 08:11:00,578,"If that is full, try the Northside in Vermillion Bay, only about an hour away."
561982,Guest,2006-11-16 17:25:00,0,"Try staying at Gold Pines for one night. Can't think of anything closer to Evergreen (i.e., they're right beside each other). Really, they should merge, give it all one name...better economies of scale that way. Hahaha... NWO Fishing Bum"

561989,Guest,2006-11-17 11:03:00,0,"You may be right....there is so many of them up there at the northwest end, I sometimes mix them up. Either way, they're very close together. NWO Fishing Bum"
