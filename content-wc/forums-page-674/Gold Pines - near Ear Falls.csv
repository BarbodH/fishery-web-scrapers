We don't need much, a place to stay, water/elec and a fish house.....http://www.nwconx.net/~goldpine/cabins.htm Thanks!"
561965,Guest,2006-11-15 08:00:00,0,I've vacationed there the last 4 years and liked it very much. I've never camped there but the facilities are available.The camp owners are the most congenial hosts we've ever stayed with.Their rental boats aren't too fancy but if you have your own boat that's not an issue. If you're renting a boat I'd try Goose Bay or Evergreen. Gold Pines prices are very reasonable and you will not find friendlier camp owners.
561969,Guest,2006-11-15 18:26:00,0,"I concur with Blackjack on this one. You will not find better camp hosts anywhere. Bill and Helen and their son Peter and his wife Christa will bend over backward to help you out. The only problem you may have is being put on the waiting list if you're looking for a cabin. I made my reservation for next August last month. If you are camping, I don't think there will be a problem. The electric hookups are rated at 20 amps and I believe they said they were going to upgrade. They are also working on upgrading the cabins as soon as the MNR gives them the go ahead with the septic system. Give them a call and you won't be disappointed. We've been there the last 6 years and I don't plan on going anywhere else for some time. We have fished all over NW Ontario, but this is still the best."

Such as Whitewing, Goose Bay, Excellent Adventures and Outposts, Golden Fawn, Lac Seul Evergreen Lodge, Timerblane Lodge."
