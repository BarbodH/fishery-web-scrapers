561888,skeeterslim,2006-11-04 17:06:00,14,"Hi guys, I talked to the boys at Lund this week, they are very interested in the idea of a trail. I also talked to the Lions in Russell, they seem very interested in the idea to be apart of the trail. We are thinking of making 2 new tournamenst and joining with 2 others, Lake of the Praries and possibly the voyageurs in Pine Falls or the possibility of another tounament in the fall starting next year. The 2 new tounaments the walleye trail would start would be spring at Lac du Bonnet and possibly the Red River in the fall for the final. There would be a total 4 tournaments in the trail. Any comments or ideas greatly appreciated or email me at bigfish12345@hotmail thanks for now, Slim"
561892,manitobawalleye,2006-11-04 18:26:00,885,"email on the way with my thought's manitoba .... a 100,000 lakes how many walleyes ???? i will never have enough time...."
561927,Guest,2006-11-08 15:20:00,0,I like the Idea of a Manitoba trail as well. Maybe include/work with the two other MB tournaments already set up at LOTP and Pinefalls. I would like to see one done at Pinawa. Lots of lake room. Regards Cory
562010,Guest,2006-11-20 20:22:00,0,"Great idea, love to attend all and any walleye tourney's in Mb. Would love to see more, would love to see open slots. If our slots are reduced to none over 22, oh well, the competition is still the fun part. Lake of the prairies is a blast and guys are fishing for 28"" walleyes that only weigh 5.5 lbs on average. You know where to get me, I work just up the road, I would love to help where I can. (think I'll paint my lund purple)"
561733,Guest,2006-10-25 12:46:00,0,"So, ya want to start a trail in Mtba. First of all let me wish you all the best. You must have a lot of time on your hands. Let me play the devil's advocate for a minute or three. Several thoughts...Why would you go to any other boat manufacturers than Lund? They are THE most prominent sponsor of tournaments in this area. I don't see any other companies sponsoring anything out here, do you? Why not get Skeeter! I don't see them doing much up here to support the tournaments! How many Misty River Dealers are there in any of the towns you are looking at? etc, etc, etc. Have you given any thought to asking the existing tournaments that are already happening to become part of this? I am sure that Lake of the Prairies and Pine Falls will welcome you with open arms since you will be competing with the locals that are putting on the tournaments in these towns. As for Lake of the Prairies, the long weekend in May, I have fished the LOP tournament for quite some time and you risk the lake still being FROZEN! What then? The second date seems to be fine. As for the final, that would normally be the date for the CWC. It was moved ahead this year due to a scheduling conflict with the PWT final. Have you checked with Kim Wilson or the Voyageurs and gotten their thoughts on another tournament? 3 weekends in a row, how many guys have that much money or are willing to fish for 3 weeks straight? As for the dinners, what are you thinking!!!! Give a local establishment the first crack. Without local support you are dead in the ""WATER"". Just a few thoughts. Will keep my eyes open and if I think of more, some good stuff too I will reply. Keep your lines tight as Craig would say."
561734,skeeterslim,2006-10-25 14:45:00,14,"Holy mcaroni... Lund would definetly be ask to be a sponsor, they do alot up here for tournaments and are a great bunch of guys. They bring out an mc, tent, boat number deacals, pa systems, special events boat, they have it all. As for joining up with other tournaments.. in my opinion, that would be a waste of time.. the idea here is to add to the tournaments we have here now. Why bother goping thru the headaches if you don't get any extra weekends to fish tournaments. As for Lake of the Prairies, I have never seen it frozen on open weekend. My Dad has had a place there for the last 8 years. As for early spring, I am leaning towards having the May Tournament at Lac du Bonnet. The reason of the weekend in between the 2 Pine Falls tourneys this year is beacause of the Canadian thanksgiving being early, the Voyageurs stayed on their Thanksgiving weekend. It will be the same again next year. The idea about the getting locals for the meals is a great idea. Thanks for the info, If you have any other ideas, please feel free. Thanks, Slim"
561736,Guest,2006-10-25 16:56:00,0,"Slim , You are right Lake of the Prairies has never been frozen on May Long Weekend & I have fished it for over 25 years? Lund is a great first choice. Lund may be content with the amount of tournaments they sponsor today? I still would keep a open mind to other sponsor's? Maybe shimano would help?"
561737,skeeterslim,2006-10-25 18:18:00,14,"hi Toughguy, absolutely keeping an open mind, I am hoping Shimano and Minnkota will jump on board, as well I was thinking of Berkley. In the next day or two, I will try to get ahold of Tom or Andrew to see about Lund. I also have a winnipeg Radio dj on board, would love to get someone from tv. I will try to get ahold coke and or pepsi as well. Thinking of talking to Yamaha as well. Let me know if you have any other ides for sponsors. Thanks, Slim"
561738,Guest,2006-10-25 18:51:00,0,"Hi Slim , I know Pro-Am tackle will help you a little ? He always has good things to say about you Slim."
561739,skeeterslim,2006-10-25 18:58:00,14,"ya you bet, Borris is a good guy."
561740,manitobawalleye,2006-10-25 19:05:00,885,"right on slim may lacdu sept lop oct red and maybe a sanctioned 1 at minaki or a new 1 at lake of the woods during july aug maybe top point getter gets a pass into wilsons walleye championship if the date works out manitoba .... a 100,000 lakes how many walleyes ???? i will never have enough time...."
561741,Danny61,2006-10-25 20:42:00,42,hey slim one company you should really try to get onboard in Petro Canada. just for the simple fact how much is spent on gas at a tourney espically say LOP. With the right presentation I think you could get those guys on board for sure. Molson just joined up for the KBI this year. Wiht the right person headmaning your sponsorship planning you might be surprised whats possible.
561742,skeeterslim,2006-10-25 21:08:00,14,"both good ideas guys... I will look into Molsons, I will try to get ahold of Petro Can.. If I can't I will get ahold of Shell, we deal with them at work... Thanks, Slim"
561743,Guest,2006-10-26 09:47:00,0,"Good to see everyone jumping on board. As for LOP several years ago the ice dropped a few days before the tournament. Ask Mike Twardowski. Anywho, not an important issue but one to think about. As for Lund, if you get them forget about Yamaha, everything they do gets tied in with Mercury. What dates are you thinking about for what tournament? Seems a couple of guys think LOP is the Sept. date. Maybe I misunderstood. If you think that having a third tournament at Pine Falls is a good idea at the time you mentioned, (I would still find out if Kim is holding his the same time next year) remember that neither of these tournaments were anywhere close to being full fields. I do agree that we need to have more ""Quality Run"" tournaments here in Manitoba and would gladly help. Adding the existing tournaments to the trail would only enhance the whole thing, don't you think? More to come later."
561712,Guest,2006-10-24 05:48:00,0,We had Walleye Tourament at Falcon lake in the late 80's with 60 boats ?
561713,Guest,2006-10-24 05:54:00,0,"Hi Fishcamp , Dauphin River has no facility for a fall tournament?"
561714,Guest,2006-10-24 06:02:00,0,It would be nice to see a Walleye Tournament in Paint Lake
561717,skeeterslim,2006-10-24 09:59:00,14,"Thanks for all the info and ideas guys... Keep them coming.... Other than Lund and the tackle shops, any ideas on any other sponsors we could hit up?? Thanks, Slim"
561718,Mike M (Sask),2006-10-24 10:26:00,374,Hi Slim Here is a link to the Saskatchewan Walleye Trail. There is lots of good information including their scoring system. One thing I would question is limiting Hp to 150. I don't know about there but around here there is a ton of rigs running over that. Hope the link helps.http://www.saskwalleyetrail.ca./
561723,Guest,2006-10-24 19:09:00,0,"Hi Slim , Look at Yamaha & A Local boat company like MistyRiver ( I think it's Harv Basler ) Or Ronds is getting Crestliner back ? You can tried Coke , Pepsi or Molsons ?"
561724,skeeterslim,2006-10-24 19:37:00,14,"Hi guys, again, thanks for all the info and emails.... there is definetly alot of interest out there on these tournaments. I kinda looked up a few dates.. take a look, I want to make sure we are not on the weekend of another tournament. May 19 and 20th/07, September 15 and 16th/07 and the final would be October 13 and 14th/07. Also, I have got a few poeple who emailed me with their numbers who would like to get involved. If you would like to be on the board, or volunteer, please email me your name and number.[email protected] thanks for now, Slim"
561726,Chad,2006-10-24 21:04:00,3523,Why not have it on the Red in September? Looks like the First and Third weekend in Oct I have to fish Selkirk and the Second Weekend I have to fish Pine Falls to avoid the October Tourneys. I know some guys have started heading up to Lake of the Woods and Nipawan to avoid the tourney traffic in the fall. ChadM
561729,manitobawalleye,2006-10-25 06:04:00,885,"probabaly the same reason you come up in october instead of september manitoba .... a 100,000 lakes how many walleyes ???? i will never have enough time...."
561731,Guest,2006-10-25 09:59:00,0,"Sounds like a decent idea. However, why not try to incorporate the Lake of the Prairies tourney instead of competing? Don't forget there is an Angler and Young Angler Tournament at Lac Du Bonnet in June, day before fathers day. I have a lot of experience helping put together tournaments. If you need some assistance let me know through this forum. This idea will need a lot of hard work."
561699,skeeterslim,2006-10-23 19:06:00,14,"Hi guys, i am looking for some ideas and suggestions about starting up the Manitoba Walleye Trail. Here is what I am thinking... 3 tournaments, Lake of the Prairies on May long weekend, Lake of the Woods or Lac du Bonnet in either late June or early July and the Red River in Selkirk in October.. the weekend after Kim's Pine Falls tournament. (BBBRRRRRRR) All Tournaments would be two day tournaments with a meal and a $350 dollars per tounament or $1000.00 if a team signs up for all 3. 150 boat cap. All 3 tounaments would be 100 per cent payout minus the advertising, meals, some prizes & any cost we would inccur putting on the tournaments. I also need help or ideas oh how we could calculate points and the team with the best points of course get some cash after the last tournament. We also would be looking at sponsors for these events and a whack of volenteers at each place as well places to hold the meetings and have the suppers. As for the suppers, I am thinking of Craig Walker to bbq a pig and put on the spread. Any ideas of what you guys think of this would be greatly appreciated. Please reply on here or email me at [email protected] Thanks for now... Slim :)"
561700,Guest,2006-10-23 20:38:00,0,Great idea I'm in. Early season and late season perfect. The middle of the summer is best spent with the family anyway.
561701,manitobawalleye,2006-10-23 20:44:00,885,"i like your idea a couple of things to consider i am sure you know when lop's current 1 is i would stay away from long weekends fisheries will not give you a permit in july so it would have to be june lacdubonnet and the cottage association has 1 3rd weekend in june july on woods would be great the red 1 is good but your slot would be 2nd weekend in oct or next weekend which as you say will be brr.... or you could do lop lacdu lotw and a championship for top 25 teams figuring out a points system would be easy you would probably have next to zero chance at walkups if your tourney is this weekend also i would be watching to see if fisheries changes the red regs to zero fish over 22"" which would make your red tourney a tough sell the walleye anglers association of manitoba has spoken out against this change and how it affects tournies but have not been informed if they are considering our voice also try not to schedule against the ontario ones if you can help it re..dryden...2 minaki...red lake etc one other thing you could consider is amalgamating 1 with minakis ie...making it a tourney stop that counts points to the championship email me at [email protected] if you would like to discuss further is that your purple and yellow skeeter? manitoba .... a 100,000 lakes how many walleyes ???? i will never have enough time...."
561702,skeeterslim,2006-10-23 20:55:00,14,"That is one thing i want to watch for sure is not to have a tournament on the same weekend as existings tournaments, it would defeat the purpose. I hope as well the new law they are trying to pass, does not pass for the Red River and Winnipeg River system. Thanks for the info.. yes, it is my purple and yellow skeeter. Slim"
561705,Guest,2006-10-23 21:46:00,0,What about Dauphin Lake in the Spring ?
561706,manitobawalleye,2006-10-23 22:00:00,885,"dauphin lake would be interesting what is the slot? saw you and your skeeter at the voyaguer tourney don't think we've ever met though danny61 was there also manitoba .... a 100,000 lakes how many walleyes ???? i will never have enough time...."
561708,Guest,2006-10-23 22:31:00,0,The slot is the same as Lake Of the Prairies
561709,Guest,2006-10-23 22:32:00,0,What about Falcon lake for spring time ?
561710,Guest,2006-10-23 23:26:00,0,"I think falcon lake would be to small a lake to host a hundred boat walleye tourney, I dont think tthe cottagers would be very happy about it either. But I would suggest a place like Hecla. Big restort community good fishing, mabye even good community support. Also one thing to consider is sponsorship. Without a good business plan you won't get sponsors. You'll need an itinerary and a well laid out structure to your tourney's. Volunteers must have an interest in seeing the tourney return every year thats why its important to have community support."
561711,Guest,2006-10-24 01:01:00,0,Hey Slim I was the volunteer at the dock that complimented your Skeeter at the Red River Walleye Challenge.You have a fine idea.The Red and Dauphin Rivers in the fall can be a go if you dress for the weather.How about Pointe du Bois or Pinawa as a second location(May or June)?.If you need help I can be reached through the Canadian Esox Association or the Walleye Anglers Association of Manitoba (WAAM).
