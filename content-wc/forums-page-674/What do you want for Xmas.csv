561962,Guest,2006-11-14 19:57:00,0,Hello Santa. I'd like to get you to try and bring back some of the values of years gone by. The perfect gift thing is getting a bit tired for me. We had people as a youngster who came to the house for dinner at Christmas and all they brought was a firm handshake and good stories. They were just getting by. Oh and Santa please keep our young men and woman safe who are in harms way. I know I'm being very greedy now Santa and I know this is a stretch but could you talk to the Big Guy and get the Toronto Mapleleafs to win the Stanley Cup and bring it home to Canada where it belongs .....away from those Crawfish eating southerners.
561980,Guest,2006-11-16 14:50:00,0,"My neighbor plays Santa Claus at various events. He told me that he was at an office party last year and the employees had their children there. He went on to tell me that a little girl about 3 or 4 years old old climbed up on his lap and told Santa her name was Allysa. When Santa asked her what she wanted for xmas her reply was short and to the point ""I want my Daddy back from Iraq, I love my Daddy"""
