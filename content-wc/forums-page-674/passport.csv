561909,Guest,2006-11-06 22:30:00,0,"I sent in my application at the local PO office 5 weeks ago and recieved my new passport last week. No big deal. Personally, I can't understand all the fuss. I think it's about time, my wife has had one for years and when we traveled to Mexico last year she was waived right on thru while I was fumbling with all my paperwork, and attempting to prove who I was. In the end the price is cheap, particularly when some guys won't blink at spending $100's on rods or $40/lb for leeches."

561913,Guest,2006-11-07 09:59:00,0,"That is good news that you got yours in 5 weeks. They were telling me at our courthouse it is taking a little longer than normal and they expect delays in the near future. I was just giving folks a ""heads up"" as to what I had learned. Same on the dollar amount. It is what it is and it isn't bad. (..but some people may have been anticipating a $40-$50 fee). I too, have been going to get one for years and procrastinated long enough! Time to get it done. :)"
