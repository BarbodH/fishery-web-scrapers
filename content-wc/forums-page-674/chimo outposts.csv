Roderick is big, with very good walleye, northern, and lake trout fishing. The 3 far north outposts have the best walleye fishing. Also been to Keeper Lake and Schultz with so-so results. Great place to go. Try to get into Warwick if you can!!"
561899,Guest,2006-11-06 09:17:00,0,"Hi Robby, Between six of us we were over 900, most of them on Copper. Water levels were down 4' so it was a 20 minute portage twice a day. The biggest walleye was 28 1/2 from Copper caught on a 4"" white gulp grub. There was an active forest fire on Copper that kept things interesting. Fortunately, the cabin was never in danger. Everyone seemed to do well using a piece of ciscoe on a 1/4 or 3/8 oz. jig with a white grub. Bullock was hot one day and totally cold the following day thanks to a NE wind. We re-booked for the same time next year. Where did your group go? How was it and where are you going in 2007?"

561902,ROBBY,2006-11-06 11:41:00,20,"HI DAVE, LAST YEAR WE WENT TO GHOST RIVER CAMP IN SOUIX LOOKOUT. FISHING WAS OK AND GETTING BETTER AS THE WEEK WENT ON. THIS YEAR WE ARE BOOKED INTO BOW LAKE OUT OF ALBANY RIVER OUTPOSTS IN PICKLE LAKE."
561903,ROBBY,2006-11-06 14:33:00,20,HOW DID YOU GE THE CISCOE?
561910,Guest,2006-11-07 07:16:00,0,We bought them frozen at Four Seasons in Ear Falls. Smalls were 6/$3 large were 6/$3.75. We also used leeches from Rainy Lake Sports in Fort Frances ($46/lb ouch!) and crawlers from Four Seasons. Next year we'll scale down on leeches and up on ciscoes.

561808,Guest,2006-11-03 08:47:00,0,"OT, I have been to Roderick in June and Hornby and Warwick in Sept. I prefer the northern outposts. If you can get into Hornby go for it. You can do well on quantity while also having a shot for plenty of 24"" + fish. The cain sleeps up to six and the equipment is reliable. My group has been fishing with Peter since 1995."
