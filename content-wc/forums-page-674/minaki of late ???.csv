561917,Guest,2006-11-07 13:19:00,0,"Fished there last weekend. Fishing Good, Catching Poor."
561918,Guest,2006-11-07 14:00:00,0,"There was about 8"" of snow, but at least there was a south wind. Might of been the first time that we were the only boat on the water. AS for fishing we landed a few muskies. Nothing over 40"" , but awsome all the same. We caught a pile of walleye's and had a huge shore lunch with fried potatoe's and beans. If you ever thought shore lunch in summer was good you really need to get out in the freezing cold before you really really apreciate a good fire and fried fish. Just waiting for ice to form before going back"
