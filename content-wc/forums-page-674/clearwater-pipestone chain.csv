561995,Guest,2006-11-17 19:52:00,0,"Pipestone is one of the best bass lakes in the Clearwater-Pipestone Chain. Walleye fishing is tough on this lake without a guide. Clearwater lake has an excellent evening walleye bite so portage times are not a problem for guests at Little Moose Lodge. LML also has a boat cached on Cedar Lake that has a lot of large smallmouth. At the time you are looking to come, the bass will still be on their beds, so you will see a ton regardless of the lake you are fishing. Call us if you would like to know more about Little Moose Lodge, we can also give you some guest reference contacts in your area. Regards Terry"

561897,River_eye,2006-11-05 19:31:00,1486,"I havn't fished it a whole lot, but I have lived nearby for the last year and a half. Pipestone is a really beautiful lake, with some good fishing. Billions of medium size bass, and decent musky fishing. I havn't fished for Walleyes, pike or trout there. Clearwater is a good lake too, but there are a lot of cottages, so you don't get the true wilderness feel on this particular lake. The portage into Pipestone is great, although you do pay for it. Can't speak for the lakes below Clearwater. I was fishing there yesterday and we got a couple muskies."

561945,Guest,2006-11-12 21:17:00,0,"Jigmeister, I have fished both lakes. Spent a week on Clearwater in 2002, and a week on Pipestone in 2003. We were mostly fishing for musky, but took some time to fish smallmouth/walleye as well. Also caught a decent number of accidental pike while musky fishing. The portage: It's a ""V-shaped"" railroad car, lined with rubber tires. It's not bad at all. Costs about $10 per round trip, if I remember correctly. But the guy who operates the portage only runs it from 7am till 8 pm daily, so if you're staying on Clearwater, but want to fish late into the evening on Pipestone a few days, you may be limiting your fishing time (in order to make it back to the portage before it closes each day). Don't know anything about the lodge you mentioned. We stayed at Hideaway Lodge on Clearwater in '02, and Pipestone Lodge on Pipe in '03. Both are decent lodges in my opinion, and I would go back to either one. However, if you want to fish both lakes in the same trip, you might want to consider looking into the lodge on the very northern tip of Clearwater (I believe it's Clearwater Lake Lodge. I'll find out and update my post). If I remember correctly, their property ajoins / has docks on both lakes, so if you want to stay out late fishing one lake or the other, you are not limiting your time to the portage guy's hours of operation. Simply tie your boat to the dock on whichever side of the portage you happen to be on, and then walk the to your cabin. (Please note that I've never stayed there before, but I think that's how it would work). The fishing / scenery: Pipestone is by far the best smallmouth bass water I've ever been on. We caught 102 smallies, and only fished them for 2 half days. Saw 20 to 30 at a time in front of the trolling motor as we went through the channel into Schistose Lake. Had several occasions where we would have 6 or 7 smallies following our musky lures at one time. I think we could have easily caught over 1,000 for the week if we would have been targeting them. The Northwest Arm and Schistose Lake were particularly good, and extremely scenic, remote feel to it. Can see 20 loons at a time. Didn't really fish walleyes, but I hear it has a reputation for producing some big fish (8 to 10 pounders definitely possible), but it's deep, clear infertile lake trout water, so I don't know if the population density would be good or not. Clearwater: Smaller than Pipestone, and with more development / fishing pressure. Also lots of float planes taking off and landing quite frequently, as it's the home base for L&M fly-in outposts. Still somewhat scenic, just not as nice as Pipe in my opinion. A very good smallmouth lake (in the limited time we spent fishing for them. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it an 8.5-9. Pipestone would be a 14!) Shallower and more fertile than Pipe (max depth 65 ft), so I would expect walleyes to somewhat more numerous than on Pipe. Didn't really fish walleyes though. If you need any further info, please feel free to ask. Good luck! ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
