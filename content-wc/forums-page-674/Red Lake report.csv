Started the sleds up yesterday, getting ready for the ice fishing season. One more month and we'll be popping holes... Mmmm fresh Walleye... I've got the portable ice hut all dialed in. Thinking of building a ice shack for Howey Bay... Need a Dog House for when the boyz come up to visit... lol. If anyone has any sites for how to build the perfect Ice Shack, please fill free to post them... Well Appreciated. Mista W"

I enjoyed little V last winter. Monster Pike and an abundance of walleye. We lost 3 rods but nailed a couple of 20 lbs Northerns feeding on the walleyes.... It's about a 45 minute ride by sled from Red Lake or you can transport sleds closer by road. Gullrock is usually a crowd pleaser. You should catch your limits on a bad day..Minnows and Shinners on a Jig....Place to stay, E-mail me or more info on the hot spots.[email protected] Cheers Mista W"
