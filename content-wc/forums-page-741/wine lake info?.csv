550498,Guest,2005-07-19 14:08:00,0,"sidewinder I personally have never been to wine lake in september but I have been going the last 4 years in June. Have you been there before? I'm sure the fishing pressure is very little in the summer months so the fall should be pretty good. By the look of the catch and release letter the camp sends out people caught a lot of trophy pike in early sept. with a bunch over 40"". If you have any other questions please post. Its about time somebody talks about another lake other than lac suel. Shoe89"
550509,sidewinder,2005-07-19 17:02:00,96,"thanks shoe I am looking for a little lake off the beaten path to take my wife , with my fishing buddy and his wife. We think this is worth a shot. Looking forward to some nice walleyes interspersed with some pike and lake trout. If tradition continues my wife will big fish all of us while complaining she's snagged and ""the line won't come in.,it keeps going out, I can't reel in the line"" sidewinder"
550510,Guest,2005-07-19 18:51:00,0,"Shoe....I agree totally with you about hearing something other than the Lac Suel ""I caught a hundred fish per day"" testimonials. Not knocking the lake which seems to be outstanding but it is only one of many in NW ontario. Can't offer any advice on Wine Lake other than I had some personal contact with the owner (Herb, I believe). A very nice fellow and I was impressed with the camp and location. One of the last camps that still has an ice house with lake ice for use in the summer.....that alone would be a reason for me to spend some time there."
550512,Guest,2005-07-19 18:53:00,0,Herb & Ann run a great camp. You'll really enjoy it. I haven't been there for quite a while. We really focus on walleye and they were pretty hard to come by on Wine. Millions of northerns though. Have a great trip!
550517,Guest,2005-07-19 19:55:00,0,"sidewinder Hopefully you have looked at the winelakecamp.com website this tells you a little more. But adventure into the 4 other lakes that are attached to wine. The four are beaver, mud, turn around, and ghost. All four of them have plenty of good walleye fishing. I usually don't fish wine for walleye. Also, go up to the annishinabi falls for walleye and smallmouth. Lake trout have been real good fishing for the last few years. Herb and Ann are great host and try to get one of the lake front cabins because that is a great view and you can dock your boats right in front of the cabins. And if you have any other questions please post. Shoe89"
550522,sidewinder,2005-07-19 20:23:00,96,I have looked at website and talked to Ann. So are the walleyes not plentiful in Wine lake or hard to find? Look forward to trying other lakes.If I understood Ann the only portage is into Wabaskang and Annishinabi. Is that correct? Also Wine lake sounds like a clear lake which could encourage eyes to establish permanent residence in other lakes which are stained. Does that sound reasonable? sidewinder
550534,Guest,2005-07-20 08:10:00,0,"sidewinder The walleye are in wine but you just have to find them. We usually use spinner rigs with bottom bouncers to locate then jig. But most of the time when we walleye fish we go to the smaller lakes. Wine is a clear lake with depths of over 100 feet in the narrows out from the camp. You are right on the two portages. You portage down into wine from wabaskang, which is an easy portage. Annishinabi is a portage up and I have never been up there but it is a trout and Pike lake. There are two other lakes you can access while there. Trout lake is just a lake trout lake and I beleive they charge $40 for the day. Also, there is tip-over and that is a free trip with a 1/4 to 1/2 mile walk through the bush, this is mainly a walleye lake. Any other questions please email at [email protected] Shoe89"
