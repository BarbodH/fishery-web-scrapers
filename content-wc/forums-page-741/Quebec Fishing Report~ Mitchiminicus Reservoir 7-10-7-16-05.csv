550442,Guest,2005-07-18 10:18:00,0,"Just returned home and thought I'd share some details of a most interesting trip our group of 8 walleye fishermen went on. We booked with Scott Outfitters, good outfitter, decent lodging and boats. The weather was HOT, bright sunshine, little if any wind for the first 4 days we were there. The reservoir has light tea colored water, not gin clear but definitely not murky water. Conditions being as they were, we went with conventional wisdom and fished hard in the deeper (22-35') and more water, where we marked plenty of fish but had little success.....we fished mornings @ 4am till 9, evenings 5 till 10pm....even went out @ 2am and fished till after dawn.....and just picked up an occasional eye or two. Jigs, cranks, crawler harnesses bouncing bottom... leeches and crawlers.....and up top water too....not much success. Mid-day was scorching hot, time for cool beverages, swimming and naps. We were being as stubborn as the fish were. One of our crew observed another local boat waaaaay back in a shallow bay, consistantly working the shallows, and saw them net a nice fish.....so they decided what the heck, let's try the shallows in a similar spot, what did we have to lose?? Immediatley, they began to catch walleye. It still has me shakin my head.....from that point on, we targeted the shallows and fished 5-10' of water, and the walleye bit bigtime.....even in the bright sunshine!! I've hit fish in the shallows before, but NEVER in those weather conditions. A slow troll with crawler harnesses worked the best....but those 'eyes had to watch the boat just clear them overhead, and then strike on 10 to 15' of line behind the boat....all in bright conditions. This goes down in my book under the ""You just never know"" catagory....as well as the ""Walleye are the definition of unpredictable"" catagory. Great trip, good time and another lesson learned courtesy of Walleye School."

550445,Guest,2005-07-18 11:53:00,0,"It's 4-5 hours north and slightly east of Ottawa. Last nearest bigger town was Mount Laurier, north and slightly east from there. Scotts website is www.clubscott.ca I believe, try it both with or without the .ca."
550449,phishfearme,2005-07-18 14:34:00,1242,"bax - walleye in ""shallow"" doesn't surprise me. did you do any of your swimming in 5-10 feet of water? did you dive down? if you did you no doubt noticed a significant thermoclime (rapid temerature change) and how dark it gets at 5-10 feet due to the tanin in the water. what is shallow in one part of the world is not the same in others. i had to recover three anchors this year on our trip with snorkel gear - luckily the anchor rope guided me to the anchor as it was very difficult to see and i sure didn't want to stay there long. i think this is also why color doesn't matter in these lakes - below about 4-5 feet all the red/orange/yellow end of the spectrum is gone and everything looks grey. - phish"
550487,retire55,2005-07-19 08:45:00,1029,"Hi Baxter: Thanks for the report. Scotts web site address is actually clubscott.com Did your group only fish for walleyes or did you attempt to catch some of the other fish species available there (e.g. speckled trout)? Did you stay at the main camp area or at a remote area. Which lake or lakes are available for walleye fishing and what size are they? How deep are the lakes? I didn't see a map of Scotts territory on his web site and consequently, there's no way to discern anything about the size of lakes there. Is your group planning a return trip there?"
550532,Guest,2005-07-20 07:59:00,0,"Retiree55: Yes, we do plan to return there. We stayed in one of the remote cabins away from the main lodge, Cabin#8, accomodates up to 12 guys. One of two cabins on the main reservoir. We did not fish any of the other lakes available to us. However, we did have a ball fishing brookies (speckled) trout in the river. The river spillway/flow comes out of the bottom of the reservoir and is very cold, and feeds a river that roars right along with some big, deep holes....but much of it is solid rapids where you need to target pockets behind bigger rocks. Caught some real nice 10-13"" brookies, but lost many more due to not bringing along a small trout landing net. Those buggers are hard to corral with a bare hand while standing in a rushing river. This river is definitely NOT bank fishing, you need to wade to fish it.....wicked tangled brush on the banks. We marked up to 60' depths in the reservoir. Hope this helps, be glad to answer any further questions."
550533,Guest,2005-07-20 08:04:00,0,"Phish: What was suprising in addition to the water depth, was the fact that they were there right in the bright sun, in very warm water, without a ripple on the surface. You'd think they woulda been spooked by the presence of a boat just overhead. Seemed strange to us anyway, but we didn't argue with success and caught many fish once we had patterened them out."
550551,retire55,2005-07-20 18:29:00,1029,Thanks for the response Baxter. Would you share with us the average size of walleyes caught? Did your group catch any walleyes over 22 inches? Thanks again.
550560,Guest,2005-07-21 06:12:00,0,"Retire55: Most of the walleye were 15-19"" in size, a few smaller, a few a little bigger. Our fish pool winner was 22"" and weighed in at exactly 4#s. No monsters but plenty to eat, and plenty more to C&R. One of my co-workers was there in June and landed one just over 9#, 31"" as I remember. His party also landed some brookies in the reservoir while fishing walleye with worm harnesses. They're in there! We have dealt with bugs in June before and opt for later summer dates. On our last June trip we fed a fine mix of skeeters and black flies that would rival scenes out of the movie ""African Queen"" .....just brutal, we felt like we were held hostage by the bugs....impossible to sit around a campfire at night, the !@!#%$ers were even out in force offshore on the lake, no escape."
550563,515,2005-07-21 07:36:00,254,Good report and you stuck with it till you found what worked. It doesn't surprise me either about the fish being that shallow. On our annual trip each summer we never fish deeper then 12 feet of water and are consistent in catching walleyes every year. Good Luck on your next trip. Mike
