550579,kbkakes,2005-07-21 14:10:00,49,OOPs...Sorry I made a mistake. I was talking about Little Vermilion Lake just north of Red Lake. Dont know about the other one. Also dont no anything about Fireside Lodge. Sorry ...Kevin

The 'Vermillion' near Hudson/Sioux Lookout, is actually 'Big Lake Vermillion'. You take HWY 776 west prior to Sioux Lookout to get there."
