550353,jswinter,2005-07-14 14:39:00,4,"I have fished Lac Seul in June and in july before. We are taking a houseboat in Mid August this year and I was curious as to the patterns I should expect. Depths, bait and areas for walleyes, smallies and muskies. We will be going out of Hudson and will beach the houseboat on or near taylors island and fish anywhere near there (pine point, windy narrows, etc.)or anywhere you suggest. I would assume crawlers might be the bait of choice by that time for walleyes. any help would be greatly appreciated."
550448,jswinter,2005-07-18 13:26:00,4,"nobody has any comments, huh? I guess no one fishes Lac Seul in August. thanks for the info."
550452,IA  DAN,2005-07-18 15:05:00,53,Depending on how cold it is but I would think they would be suspended 15-30ft of water.We go 1st week of Aug. and usually fish with crawlers and leeches on lindy rigs.Just pick a island and start fishing I don't think you have to be a expert to catch fish on Lac Seul.Good Luck and have a safe trip. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH.
550457,Guest,2005-07-18 17:53:00,0,"jswinter, Plenty of people fish LS in August, but I think the perennial followers of this board, who dominate much of the discussion, are seeing the same topics over and over again. Not that your question isn't valid, but the same advice and discussion is simply being repeated. As a start, I would spend an hour looking back through the archives, and there I'm sure you will find tons of reports, advice, etc on Lac Seul for any time of year. So I will offer something I know I have posted on here before (I don't know how far the archives go back but perhaps it's in there) . . . Mid-August eh? At this time of year, and from then till October for that matter, in general the fish are deeper and holding more to main lake structure (in contrast to the spring/early summer trends). And you can (and you will) find fish all over the place, but perhaps the best pattern for that period is what we have come to call MEGA-SAND STRUCTURE (and when I say we, I mean myself and my professional guiding colleagues). The combination of the post-glacial landscape, geomorphologic processes in the last 10000 years, and the creation of the Lac Seul reservoir (raising the lake elevation several feet) have created a common main lake phenomena on Lac Seul which are magnets for walleyes in the late-summer and fall. Picture for example a common site on Lac Seul, which is a sandbluff island, composed pretty much entirely out of sand, and often has sand banks rising from near the water's edge with forest on top. The main lake of Lac Seul if full of these things, which are essentially islands slowly eroding away, or rather not going away, but that sand is being deposited somewhere throughout the system, depending upon water levels, wind direction and velocity, etc. Years and years of this process has created these mega-sand structures, and believe me some of them can be big (like several square kilometers in size). There are several characteristics to defining the nature of these structures, but many share similar qualities. Because of the water levels (which change on Lac Seul), and the depth in the water column to which wave action plays a significant role, many such structures will top out around 15-19'. So the depth increases from the edge of the sandbluff island fairly quickly down to this depth, and then creates a large flat bar of sand at about that depth. Again, the size, direction from the island, and other spatial characteristics of the bar itself is dependent upon the criteria listed above. Now, the other common quality is that at the edges of these 'sand plateaus', the depth quickly drops to 40, 50, 60, 70 feet or more (simply a steep sand slope). Sometimes you can get fish scattered across the top of these things, but they are usually stacked up on these breaks (and I mean literally stacked thick)!! Sometimes, particularly later in the season, and you should always at least try this anyway, the fish might be further down the break close to the thermacline. But most often, they are sitting right on the top edge of the break (right in that 17-22' region). So, if you don't know where to start, you can find these things by watching your graph, and then simply troll along the edges. Quite often the fish are ONLY on the top-edge break, and if you are out by just a boatlength it could be the difference between 2 fish and 20 fish. I have seen a guided boat outproduce an unguided boat easily 10 to 1 or 15 to 1 for fish production because of the guide's diligence to keep the boat right on the break. Sometimes it may also be useful to occasionally let yourself ""fall off"" the break a short distance, as big fish in particular will sometimes move off and sit suspended, just off the break. Also you should work the entire lengths of these breaks, but often changes in the orientation of the break, or the end of the break, can be particularly productive. I like to bottom bounce these structures, but depending on the bite, and if the fish are less aggressive, you may have to slow down and jig. So, mid-August + Lac Seul + mega-sand structure = walleyes. And if that isn't advice, then I don't know what is . . . Good Luck, NWO Fishing Bum"
550458,Guest,2005-07-18 18:35:00,0,"""The combination of the post-glacial landscape, geomorphologic processes in the last 10000 years, and the creation of the Lac Seul reservoir"" I went on dictionary.com to help out everyone with NWO's last post. Geomorphologic is defined as: adj : pertaining to geological structure; ""geomorphological features of the Black Hills""; ""morphological features of granite""; ""structural effects of folding and faulting of the earth's surface"" NWO, it was a great post with useful information, but you could have just said that ""structure changes over the years"" instead of geomorpholigic. There needs to be a Walleye Central rule about using such big words so I can understand things. Just kidding NWO, you probably know more about fishing than I will ever know. For my two cents, I fish the windy side of sandy points or midlake humps using spinners, and if there are a lot of fish, I slow down and throw jigs. I ALWAYS start the first day of the trip with a guide, sometimes the first two days. I get to Canada once a year. Does not make sense to mess around for a few days. Let an expert show the patterns that are hitting that time of year and then you can work the rest of the week finding other good spots that are similar to what the guide showed you."
550499,Guest,2005-07-19 14:17:00,0,"Thanks Bor, lol. No, these things definately change, and whereas most geomorphologic processes occur relatively slowly, I have been on structure that I know has changed positions from one year to the next, and have also witnessed fairly large, above-surface, sand-based structures completely erode away over a couple years. I suspect the large fluctuations in water levels help contribute to this relatively accelerated process. Fishing mega-sand as I described it above is the best use I have discovered for the GPS tracking options available in the better Lowrance and other units. From a guide's perspective (again keeping in mind that much of the time, precise boat position is at a premium for maximizing producitons on these structures), once you have worked the structure, paying close attention the first time, you can simply manouver the boat along the line in the GPS window of your graph. It's like playing a video game. Or if you have a bunch of waypoints marked along the break, you can simply play ""connect the dots"" by manouvering the boat from one point to the next.

550500,jswinter,2005-07-19 14:27:00,4,"hey fellas thanks for the info. I have fished Lac Seul for 3 years and know some spots that always produce. Just wanted to know how it might be in mid-august( latest I have been there). I have a new boat and new lowrance electronics so it will be fun to really get to know them around these structures. I am a pharmacist, so big words are something I can handle. And putting them into every day terms doesn't come to easy to me like they come to others. so thanks again for the info. Joe"
