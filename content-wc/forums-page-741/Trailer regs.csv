I had heard that you have to tie down the safety chains a special way. Three days and a wakeup to Ear Falls."
550472,Guest,2005-07-19 00:27:00,0,Hi. they never bother us and the boat. I have heard though they prefer the safety chain that is more than a S hook on the end. ZI guess some kind of locking dodad would be good so the chain does not fall off the tow vehicle.
