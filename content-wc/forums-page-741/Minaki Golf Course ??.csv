My wife is interested in playing a few rounds if she gets sick of fishing, but I really don't want her to drag along clubs unless there is a chance they will get used. I know the lodge burned down a couple years ago, but last year I regularly saw people playing. Thanks IaCraig"
550547,Guest,2005-07-20 15:58:00,0,Craig....I was told by a local that it was not open because of pending litigation. I didn't see anyone playing when I was there but it did look like it was being kept up.

550569,Guest,2005-07-21 10:30:00,0,Officially... The golf course is NOT opened. The Receiver has indicated the cost vs. reward scenario is too risky. The people that you would have seen golfing there in the past would either be staff or simply people trespassing. It's kinda easy to par the course when there are no pins anywhere. Sorry IaCraig for the inconvienance...Beauty Bay is open not far down the road. Rod
