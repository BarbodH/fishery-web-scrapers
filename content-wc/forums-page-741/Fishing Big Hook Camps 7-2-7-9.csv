We had mostly non-stop action in spite of a full may fly hatch and water temperatures of 64 to 68 degrees. These fish were caught in water no deeper than 12 feet the majority were caught in 6 feet or less. only one day was cloudy, the rest were bright and sunny. It was about as good as it could get. The largest walleye was 25 inches the largest pike was 37 inches with a big drop off in the size of the pike to an average of 24 inches."

550289,Guest,2005-07-12 15:54:00,0,"We fished at their Favourable Lake Camp. You have two lakes to fish, Favourable and Lemonade. The water level was just a little high in Favourable and appeared to be normal in Lemonade. We used crankbaits to start with (Shallow and deep) but due to the the bite we switched to jigs with twister tails and flattened the barbs to make it easier to get them off and to get back into the the water. Due to the heavy action we experimented with all kinds of lures and colors, everything worked except one storm crankbait that just wouldn't catch anything. Lemonade is billed as a walleye factory and it is but it is also loaded with small northerns and saugeyes. Favourable has its spots that don't produce much at all mostly due to its size and depth, but much of the lake produces walleyes. Some spots in Favourable are very fast fish producers. There are big northerns in Favourable, just not a lot of them. The walleyes averaged between 1&1/2 pds. and 3 pds. the northerns between 2pds. and 5 pds with a few above those numbers. There are two cabins that set between the two lakes."
550580,Guest,2005-07-21 14:18:00,0,I have fished Favourable and lemonade lakes many times over the last 10 years and they ain't what they used to be. Lemonade is still a walleye factory in the spring but the fishing tends to drop off a a lot in the summer months. it's always been that way. Favourable used to be a world class trophy pike lake however the natives who own the camp on the lake have netted the piss out of it. They should be ashmed of themselves as they take your money and net your fish and kill the trophy pike. It is very sad as I love favourable but netting has taken it's toll and it will take years for that lake to come back. A few years ago i would get at least three pike over 40 inches everyday on that lake and now you are hard pressed to get one in a week. Even the old owner of way north lodge Kevin Geary couldn't find the big fish on that lake last year when guided for way north lodge who portages in everyday to the lake. It's a crying shame and my heart is broken to what it has become today compared to just 5 years ago. All of the old way lodge customers won't go back due to the drop off in trophy pike. Also the walleye fishing has suffred a bit as well as we stopped seeing the bigger fish that we used to catch all of the time. Sad sad sad sad to see the nets in the creeks in the spring mostly with dead rotten fish in them. Oh well i have moved my trip into manitoba for the last 3 years and have found the best trophy pike fishing i have ever had on Silsby lake. The walleye fishing is great too with lots in the 24 to 29 inch range. Goog fishin Duffy
