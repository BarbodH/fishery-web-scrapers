550507,Guest,2005-07-19 16:30:00,0,"I went thru Duluth in early June on 53. The road to the top of the hill is all done, that is, to the old 5-way stop. From there on until you get out to the mall area is under construction but to my knowledge is still open. As long as the hill project took, I would expect this portion to drag on also. It's not all that big a deal. Some delays at the intersections. They did not have lights working, rather used stop signs. It's still quicker than the detour before the new road opened."

If you follow US-2 a little ways west, you hit, I believe 33 which is 4 lanes and that runs directly into 53 headed to I-Falls. Less lights, less traffice, less construction, less headache. May be worth it to try it sometime... Just a thought... Steve"
