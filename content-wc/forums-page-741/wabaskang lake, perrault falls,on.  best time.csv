The bugs are usually worst in the evening, but this year there were just bugging over your head. Not biting just being a pest! Fishing is good all the time, better in the spring thou. The weather can be hot or cold, this year it was hot and no rain. But I have been up there when was cold and windy, which it can be all the time in the spring. Good luck and safe boating."

Even though the bite is probably better in the spring (numbers wise), I prefer summer when the fish and weather are a little more predictable and the mayfly and dragonfly hatches are over and the mosquitos and black flys aren't as numerous. It really boils down to the weather pattern the week your fishing. I like to go for two weeks that way if the weather doesn't cooperate one week it probably will the next. GL."
