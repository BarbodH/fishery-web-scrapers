Can anyone give us some accurate info on prices at the Falls and say Brainerd Orr, etc etc. Thanks so much"
550497,Guest,2005-07-19 13:44:00,0,I bought gas there Saturday (7/9) for $2.17/gallon. The cheapest place seemed to be that BP station outside of town a few miles.

550562,Guest,2005-07-21 07:28:00,0,It was $2.16 at Murphy last night. $2.29 at most stations around Duluth. I woule expect about the same in the Cook/Orr area.
550571,Guest,2005-07-21 10:45:00,0,Hi. we find the best price at the food store/ gas station just west of the holiday inn in international falls its a big station so there is plenty of room to pull your boat and truck into and not too busy.
