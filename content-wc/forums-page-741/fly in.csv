Even if it was a portage situation, or a lake with small fish in large numbers. My dad has always wanted to fly in with me, but I have avoided it because I am mainly a musky guy. I am willing to take a year off from the big fish if necessary, but if we could combine it would be perfect. Any info is much appreciated. Thanks, Poke"

550488,Guest,2005-07-19 08:58:00,0,"The name of the lake is Kishkutena. It's a very short plane ride out of Nestor Falls. I've been on that lake six times fishing for smallmouth bass. It's an outstanding bass lake...also has some largemouth in it. 100 fish a day is very realistic on that lake. The biggest problem any bass fisherman has on this lake is keeping the musky off your baits. I caught six musky in one day a few years ago with the largest being 47 inches all while fishing for smallmouth. There were a couple of cabins on the lake but I'm not sure who owns them now. The last time I went in there it was owned by an outfit called ""Tinkers place""...you can do a google search and find out about them. I also portaged into that lake once when I was younger....not an easy portage though. It's a very unusual lake as it only has bass, musky and trout in it.....no walleye or northern to be found. I'm planning on making the trip back there in few years."
