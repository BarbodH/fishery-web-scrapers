550228,Guest,2005-07-09 16:51:00,0,We are headed up to Minaki next week. Any recent reports ? We will be fishing mainly for walleye and a couple hours in the evening for Muskies Thanks in advance
550475,IaCraig,2005-07-19 05:50:00,434,"Bumping this to the top! Some of us are heading up later this week and I'm curious how the early summer fishing has been, Ive heard the water is a good 3 feet high but dropping. This spring some reports had 95% of they eyes caught under 14"" size, with almost no eaters. Is that still the case?. How about you BKT?, How did your group do? IaCraig :)"
550479,Reels,2005-07-19 07:26:00,2876,"Just had a friend come back. He said walleye fishing is still tough and hard to find legal or above slot fish. He has been going up there for about ten years and knows the system well. He did say a lot of huge muskies are being caught, and the smallie fishing was great. <{{}}><"
550484,Guest,2005-07-19 08:17:00,0,I just got back on Sunday 7/17 and can tell you that the water wasn't dropping when I left....in fact it came up about an inch. It's about 42 inches high right now. It was a family trip with the wife and kids so I didn't do as much fishing as I would have liked. Did manage to catch a few 22 inch walleye throwing shad raps up on big sand and landed a 43 inch musky while trolling for walleye on Big Sand. Went out for about an hour trolling up on the Big lake two evenings and didn't do too well.

Boated down to the Marina one day to get ice cream for the kids and there were only four trucks with trailers at Paradise Cove. I wonder which resort is going to go out of business first? With such few people up there this year (and I suspect next year will be even worse), the walleye fishing should be really good in a few years."
550504,IaCraig,2005-07-19 15:12:00,434,"Thanks Reels and Aaron for the info. This will be a family trip and I've already prepared them so walleye expectations are not too high. If the weather patterns hold consistent for a few days, I still think I will find some good action. If my walleye tricks don't work, I'll have fun watching the kids cast for Northerns & smallies, play on the beach and water ski. (If we tie into a muskey, I'll probably be the only one jumping in the lake to ski) ;-) While I won't mind fewer boats, I hate to see the resorts suffer. The fact Marcy's family has been so good to us over the years is 1 reason I never considered not going to Minaki for a 2005. Thanks everyone, IaCraig"
550514,Guest,2005-07-19 18:59:00,0,Craig...not sure how old your kids are but for my two boys ( 4 & 7 ) I set them up with slip bobbers and whacky rigged them with Senkos. Just had then throw it up about 10 to 15 feet from the bank and they caught a lot of smallmouth...had a blast. Good luck.....it was nice to have the beach to ourselves. There was a group up there camping over the weekend before we got there and the slobs didn't have the common brain cells to pick their garbage up so they left the garbage lying around the threw their beer bottles in the lake.
