Or do you start to fish points & possibly a little bigger water. Have you started using Leech's & worms or still stick with minnows? Would you say 15-20'? or still shallow. Yes the weather has a lot to do with it but I'm just wondering about the Average early June time of year"

Spend a lot of time fishing points and island banks with special attention being made to wind blowing into fishing area. Minnows and jigs seem to be the best but crawlers on jigs or BB rigs and Lindy rigs work well also. Also drag some cranks on shore lines in 8 to10' water can be a good producer for bigger fish. I like to check out the wind direction for the week before and if it is consistently out of one direction and still that way when you get there hit those banks and points first. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1192011,brwhite,2010-04-21 19:32:00,41,I've been fishing Lac Seul for 10 years in early June and I think Mike hit the nail on the head there. Don't be afraid to try different types of structure (sand vs weed vs rocks) even if one seems to be producing well.

Certain bug hatches can drive the bait into the shore and the walleye will follow, eating the bugs and the baitfish. My wife and I had an incredible few days once, actually throwing tube jigs onto the shore in a sandy beach area, and dragging them into the water, could sometimes see their fins breaking water as they chased the jigs, very cool. Dragonfly and mayfly hatch will cause a frenzy as well. When all else fails, tie on a couple of Hot-N-Tots, (gold/orange, gold/pink) troll the areas from shallow to 15' or so, banging off the bottom is a good thing. Good for larger fish, and use a leader, because some jumbo northerns will likely make a visit."

I find myself constantly moving at this time, picking off fast action until it slows, then heading to the next fresh spot."
