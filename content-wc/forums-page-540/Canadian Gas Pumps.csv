1196971,Steve Ediger,2010-05-05 11:15:00,97,V-Bay Gord.How many of us Americans do you know that fully understand the metric system? We are still trying to figure out how many inches are in a litre.
1197094,v-bay gord,2010-05-05 17:13:00,3168,"Sky wagon.....gas is currently around 1.05 a litre, so it hasn't changed much. It was 1.05 in VBay when it was .99 in Dryden. Steve.......if you think the metric system is confusing when dealing with liquids, then you should try and figure out the metric clock that we have to use (only 55 US minutes in a Canadian hour)...."
1197121,rebs,2010-05-05 19:00:00,7587,"Niagara Falls and Buffalo NY area has a ton of self service gas stations, I always pump my own gas self service is a few cents cheaper than full service"
1197125,Cut a deal,2010-05-05 19:06:00,38,"Gord it's only going to get more confusing next year when all of Canada converts to Metric Time. Under the new system there would be 100 seconds to the minute, 100 minutes to the hour, and 20-hour days."

1199038,speckeye,2010-05-11 05:44:00,61,"They don't seem to be a full-service facility,if you look for them to live up to that name."
1196612,Catman59,2010-05-04 13:36:00,345,"After reading the post about blocking the gas pumps , it brought to mind a question. Why are most Canadian stations still full service ? I know there is a few that arent , but most are."
1196620,bigtimeelectric,2010-05-04 13:48:00,174,"great question, and I also find it hard to believe there is no modern convenience store type gas stations like the ones we have here in the states. I realize they are expensive, but wouldn't you think they're would be 1 in fort francis or dryden don't get me wrong I like going into kahooters in ear falls as much as the next guy....lol"
1196655,Mike Borger,2010-05-04 15:27:00,1554,The vast majority are self serve.It's only in the boonies where most are full service.
1196662,Hump,2010-05-04 15:36:00,578,I must be missing something in ear Falls. What is kahooters?
1196721,Wall@y@,2010-05-04 17:54:00,191,"A few years ago on a Canadian fishing trip we stopped at a service station in Prince Albert, SK. When we got out to pump our gas the station attendant came out and said it was against the law for us to pump our own gas. We took him at has word and let him pump our gas for us. Now, unless he was just blowing smoke at us it may be the law in some cities against pumping your own gas. It seems to me that Oregon has similar laws when I made a trip there."
1196729,v-bay gord,2010-05-04 18:19:00,3168,True! It is against the law for an American to pump his own gas.....unless he can prove an understanding of the metric system.
1196818,Skywagon,2010-05-05 05:09:00,1106,"bigtimeelectric: The 711 in Dryden on the TransCanada, is self serve and convenience, all the usual stuff you really don't need. Gord: I had to come back south a month ago to put the crop in, when I left gas was 99 in Dryden. Gas prices have jumped about 20 cents since being down here (Illinois) in the last week or two, what is it doing there now?"
1196869,Whopper,2010-05-05 07:28:00,340,"On a recent trip the NYC we had to stop in New Jersey to gas up, I got out and started the pump and the attendant came over and told me it was against the law to pump my own gas, told him my bad I wasn't from around there, he went on to tell me there are two states where it applies and Oregon is the other"
1196897,Waxy,2010-05-05 08:34:00,2938,"He was BS'ing you. It's completely legal to pump your own gas in SK, and in all of Canada to the best of my knowledge. In fact, the vast majority of stations will be self serve, or have a full service option. Waxy"
1196900,bigtimeelectric,2010-05-05 08:42:00,174,kahooters is a little gas station right on 105 you see their sign it is a top heavy woman crossed with a buck deer can't explain it any better than that. you can also buy apparel with that symbol on inside the store..
