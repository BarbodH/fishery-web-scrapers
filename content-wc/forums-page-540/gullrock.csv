1196890,jfrealty,2010-05-05 08:27:00,7,does anyone know what the water levels of gullrock are?
1196932,2746,2010-05-05 10:03:00,3206,Maybe tackleman will respond as he lives there but over the years fishing gullrock I've noticed that It's not much affected by low water levels like Lac Seul or other surrounding lakes. Not sure I know what I'm talking about ....just what I've observed over 10 years of fishing there.
1196940,tackleman,2010-05-05 10:27:00,444,"right now the water level is at the normal summer level, but we have been getting rain for the past few days and the creeks are pouring water into the system so they may go up a bit more."
1196951,SoulFulCry,2010-05-05 10:45:00,158,water levels are a lil low for this time of yr but with the rain the last few days n the wet snow today they have come up but the rocks reefs are just under the water line so if ur goin to the north end of gull rock the big reeef up there ya can hit it with ur motors its that shallow as well as a few on keg that are easily hit u need to have a locator or if some one actually marks the reefs it would be alot easier to know the hazzards even found a couple new reefs that i never seen before using the ontario west navionics chip is a must n e ways hope ya have a good trip n just use a lil caution on the waters in gull n keg
