1159291,scar,2010-01-10 18:18:00,196,Heard that there is an access road now north of the town of Red Lake that is drivable with a remote landing on the north west side of Trout Lake. Can anyone confirm this?

1159335,Pooch,2010-01-10 21:16:00,4619,There are winter roads (paths) all the way past Birch lake to the old gold mines. When flying over you can still see the old power pole path. Logic tells me that they are unusable during the soft water season.Last time we fished Birch the logging was getting closer all of the time. When conditions were right we could hear the shredder in the evenings. Sounded like it was SW of Birch and several miles away. Hard to tell how far though. Hate to see any more access those lakes by road. Snow machines make it in the winter along with some construction equipment and maybe materials.I don't know how far the road goes past Nungesser.Pooch

1159363,Pooch,2010-01-11 06:23:00,4619,"The gold mines on the north end of Birch Lake are gone and all that is left is a couple small ""pits"". The site has been fairly well cleaned up. I don't know when they were built, but I don't think they were there very long. I think gold went down back then and it became to expensive to mine that area. Odds are someday it will happen again.Every winter people with mineral rights go up to various area to ""work"" their claim in order to keep from losing it.I've pictures of a core drilling rig and sample racks that I took a number of years ago on the east side of Birch. Interesting to see back then.There are several contributors to this board from Red Lake who would know far more than I do about the mines. Hopefully one of them could fill in the gaps and tell us about that area. All I know is from what I've been told by several people who live in Red Lake.I think that one of the richest producing gold mines in the world could be in Red Lake. Not sure though.Pooch"
1159376,hoosiercanadian,2010-01-11 06:59:00,104,"Trout lake has at least 3 fly in camps on it, if i owned one of those camps the last thing i would want to see is a road through the bush for the locals and tourists to access the lake, and so far i think they have kept it pretty much isolated, there may be a 4 wheeler trail somewhere that gets you relative close , but doubt that it goes right up to the lake. You can view google earth maps that show the logging roads, they do get close, but no banana!"
1199643,NotEnoughFishin,2010-05-12 12:36:00,4,"There is an access road, but the MNR guy said it is only allowed for them to access the lake. One year when we were fogged in at Trout we thought about trying to use the road to get back to town but a couple hours later the fog lifted and the planes came in to take us out."
