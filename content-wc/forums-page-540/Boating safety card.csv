1198632,Sutsgold,2010-05-10 07:28:00,219,Do I need a boating safety card if I am bringing my own boat to Canada?
1198652,Jimmy Jig,2010-05-10 08:15:00,1905,"NO, unless your staying along time."
1198676,WalleyeWally28,2010-05-10 09:02:00,298,There's a previous thread on page 7 that this was discussed indepth. According to the law you do not a card if you operate your own boat in Canadian waters for less than 45 consecutive days. You may want to read thru that thread - lots of good info.

It is good in Canada and I think they may eventually be required here in most states anyway. There are plenty folks teed off in Canada because we don't need one and they do which may change things for us shortly. It took a few hours and $24 to get one on line.

Works for me! And it is free. Does take some time and effort, however."
