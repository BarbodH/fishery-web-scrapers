We are pretty hardcore muskie guys, fishing all day usually, eat our lunches in the boat. I would like to take some time and try to locate walleyes. Any hints? I have been to Gullrock a few times, know what really good walleye fishing can be, can a person get into that kind of walleye fishing in LOW? We probably will be staying in Nestor Falls, maybe one of the island camps, have not decided yet. I know the smaller water areas (Stony Portage, Stevens Bay, Sabaskong Bay from Nestor Falls) pretty well out to Blueberry Island and Hay Island. I have been farther west but don't know those areas as well, but have GPS and am willing to go farther west to find the fish. Anybody want to trade specific walleye hotspots for specific muskie hotspots? I would mark a map and trade it with someone wanting to catch muskies. If not, general hints would be terrific since I am not the best walleye fisherman. Muskie fishing can be real tough some times and we would like to be able to put our sons on some walleyes if at all possible. Thanks."

1199156,scotttheguide,2010-05-11 10:01:00,73,You won't have a hard time finding walleyes to eat on LOTW. Walleye fishing is great and they are pretty easy to catch in numbers. If you are after some bigger fish or want to save time hire a guide in the area for a day or even half a day. If you are a Muskie fisherman then you know learning patterns and structures are key to putting good fish in the boat. Certain structures just seem to attract larger fish and more on a regular basis. A guide will save you allot of time trying to find fish and help you build up knowledge of patterns and structures. It will help you maximize your fishing potential in the future. Have a good trip!

Humps should be easy to find on your mapping software. 1/4 to 1/2 oz. jig with a minnow or a crawler. Some guys do real well bottom bouncing but if you're not experienced at that, probably easier to jig. Easy and relaxing fishing, especially compared to musky hunting."
