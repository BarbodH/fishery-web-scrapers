As a traveler to NW Ontario for 32 years, I particularly appreciate the insights and opinions of those of you who reside in the area.As to the issue with which you started this thread. . . everything is relative, isn't it. I understand dcraven's point. In the grand scheme of the universe, lingering at the pump is not such a big deal. But, let me tell you, when I'm sitting there in the Saturday morning sun, having driven for 13 hours, and close enough to Ord or Cliff or Pickerel that I can smell them, then it gets pretty important and personal when those two boat towing trucks sit there at the pumps, not a person in sight, while four or five sleep deprived jerks try to decide whether to buy orange or chartreuse jigs. Oh, by the way, we might as well buy our licenses while we're here, too! Duh................Somehow we do survive, despite all the energy wasted by the inconsiderateness in the world. I'll move my truck after filling up and before going in to pay. Somehow it just makes me feel better. Puts a little smile on both my face and the face of the guy who waves as he pulls up to pump."
1198413,Obabikon,2010-05-09 13:36:00,2370,"I think a couple of you have allowed your cabin fever to turn you grumpy. Hopefully once everyone's out on the water the attitudes will change. This guy just mentioned a pet peeve of his. Nothing wrong with that. And, nothing wrong with suggesting a way for the station to deal with the issues."
1198439,Bill Krejca,2010-05-09 15:10:00,6107,"Just to make things more interesting, I've seen signs telling the gas customer that it is not OK to move their vehicle until they pay! Thanks for your comments, guys, these spirited discussions are one of the reasons that makes this site so fun to read. I believe all posters had good intentions, and are welcome anytime around my campfire. Bill Krejca"
1198450,AllenW,2010-05-09 15:49:00,11482,"Just wondering if there actually is a place to pull off with out getting accused of trying to drive off, or getting the boat far enough away that its open for theft while your in paying for gas/license's or getting boxed in so you can't get out?Sorry to hear your losing that 5 or 6 minutes of your life and yes people should be more considerate, even Canadians, but sometimes it gets hard to do.Al...who tends to avoid them places when ever possible."
1198504,2746,2010-05-09 18:33:00,3206,"Yes, there is lots of room to pull off and park. We don't normally purchase gas there because of the lines but, when we do, one guy moves the truck while another goes in to pay.Blue Lk, welcome to the site and keep posting your observations. You sound like a good guy to have on board!"
1198506,v-bay gord,2010-05-09 18:39:00,3168,Maybe Blue Lake could mention this problem to Ray and Denise at Bobby's Corner. I'm sure they would appreciate knowing why some folk may not be stopping by. Seems like a simple fix.........
1198522,Guest,2010-05-09 19:43:00,0,the biggest problem that they have at Bobby's is the fact that they don't have enough rest rooms. I usually pull in without stopping from the border crossing at Pembina. I need to go. if the line at the restroom is long. My truck don't move. I tried to give my keys to the attendant and told him to move it when done. He said he couldn't. rumor has it that the cant remodel the restrooms there. without major upgrades to meet Provincial compliances. So the problem goes on. It's all my fault. I will be in on Sat. June 26 some time between 11:30 and 1:00 If this will inconvnience you in any way be fore warned. thanx guys
1198861,2746,2010-05-10 16:05:00,3206,Sounds like you may need to start carrying that pee bucket from the boat in the truck with you. One of our guys does that.....bad prostate and we all complained about stopping so often for him he finally found a solution rather than take the ribbing.In spite of the line what I like is how clean those restrooms are kept!
1198934,eyemike,2010-05-10 19:18:00,233,Those that are inconsiderate enough to just leave their rigs blocking everyone else could give a rats a$$ about any sign. It happens at most of the stations going up to the border and has been for years.
1196406,Blue Lk,2010-05-03 19:48:00,269,"This is to all my American fishing freinds,this is something I see every summer esp Sat mornings,I pull into the local gas station in Vermilion Bay & the pumps are blocked by vehicles owned by fisherman inside the store buying licence or tackle,sometimes this can take a long time depending on the number of people travelling in that vehicle & everyone has to wait to get to the pumps.It would be greatly aprieciated if you could move your vehicle once your gas in pumped.There my rant is done,see you at Bobby's or The Village Corner this season,look for the old grey haired guy in the black Dakota,& good fishin!"
1196422,Golden Eagle,2010-05-03 20:19:00,2642,"A long time customer, but not once guilty. Wish we could pump our own and pay at the pump with plastic."
1196479,Tonyo,2010-05-04 06:03:00,212,We travel through there in just a couple of weeks but we have made it a point to skip this stop for that very reason. It takes an hour to get out of there. Nothing wrong with the store but it just is too cramped for 4 truck and boats to get in and out of there. We stop in Dryden on our way up and we stop after we cross the border on the way home. I will wave at you on our way by. Have a great summer. TonyO
1196810,Terwalleye,2010-05-04 23:17:00,166,"The long lines, or the crabby guy telling you how to support his local economy? Im kidding, Im kidding...I kid"
1196872,Whopper,2010-05-05 07:31:00,340,I try to avoid places that will hold me up
1197057,Freytown,2010-05-05 15:19:00,770,If the local stations placed a simple sign at the pumps advising folks to move away from pump if shopping in the store...problem solved.
1198238,Guest,2010-05-08 19:47:00,0,"Frytown's response is unfortunately typical of the mindset of too many Americans today. He needs a **** sign to tell him to be considerate of other people. Everyone now needs a sign or to be told what to do or they can't possibly be responsible for their own behavior. It is sad to see what our society has become. Before anyone gets too excited, yes, I am an American."
1198290,Freytown,2010-05-09 05:30:00,770,"Calm down moto, I don't need a sign but only offered a suggestion if this is an on going problem at a particular gas station. I have seen such signs at gas stations that offer other services besides gas that cause folks to linger in the store.People should know better than block a pump but if I was a store/station owner that had such a problem, I would be pro-active and try things to reduce the problem. If you don't try nothing will change."
1198304,dcraven,2010-05-09 06:26:00,47,"Blue Lake - To be posting something like this, you must not have any real problems in your life - that's my guess. Nobody in your family has had cancer or other major illnesses... While agitating, it is my guess that Americans aren't the only ones who block a pump from time to time. Put things in perspective... I don't intend to be forward, but, come on! Maybe fill up on another day than Saturday.On another (and more positive) note, if you have a place on BLake - what a wonderful lake! I'm 47 yrs old and have fished Blue since I was about 10 yrs old. My dad camped there the first year the park was open and there were only three campsites at the provincial park. That place has obviously changed a bit.I miss the BL Store being open. That place had character. I'll be up and not blocking the line at your gas pump - 1st week in August. I would hate to get shot while on vacation. Staying at KC's Landing."
1198328,Blue Lk,2010-05-09 07:43:00,269,"I'm sorry if you thought my post was petty & in hind sight maybe it was,good point about gassing up on another day.To reply to problems in my life.My life has had ups & downs,including having family members & a very close personal freind die from cancer.I do live on Blue Lk,on McDonald Rd,the property has been in my family for close to 50 yrs.The Blue Lk store was a great place & several owners tried to make a go of it there.The woman that owns it now has some cabins that she rents out on a weekly basis,but no store.As far as getting shot on vacation,it won't be by me.All though I don't rely on American tourism for my livelyhood,I welcome the visiters to our area & am very proud to share this beauifull country with my fellow outdoorsman.I would love to share a shot or 2 of our great Canadian Whiskey with anyone of you.In future I will keep my personal opinions to myself."
