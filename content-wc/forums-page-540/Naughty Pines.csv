My dad excitedly book us and paid the deposit onlyto be diagnosed with terminal cancer one month later. Obvious wecould no longer go so we called the owners and explained the situation to which they basically replied too bad. They said I could apply my dad'sdeposit to the next trip. WHAT BY MYSELF. My dad is dead you morons.We all reap what we sew people."

Completely unacceptable at any time to not do a 100% refund when a death or major illness is involved. While I do understand rejecting deposit returns in many situations, this one would be completely unacceptable. I'm very sorry about your father, and wish you and your family the best. Sadly, it does often work both ways. There are people out there that are willing to make up stories and not tell the truth in order to get their deposits back. It's a tough situation for a camp owner to be in, and the point of a deposit is so that they KNOW you're coming. A cancelation is very hard on the margin... especially a cancelation on short notice or canceling in peak times."
1198232,dandhcox,2010-05-08 19:11:00,6,"Yes i know that people do make stuff up and it does go both ways. I appreciate the remarks of sympathy although that was not my intention in this post. I simply wanted to echo some of the bad press this placehas brought upon themselves with their poor business practices. Besides, where my dad is at now, the lines are always tight and the fish stories true. The best part is he is learning from the Master Fisherman now."

The owner wanted to keep his deposit even though we showed up with 11 of our scheduled 12 people. I explained to the owner that if he cancelled without a good reason I would not have expected his deposit to be returned, but I felt a life threatening illness of his soon to be wife was a very valid reason. After a discussion with the owner his deposit was credited back to us. The interesting part was our group discussed it before the owner and I did and agreed to chip in for the deposit and refund it to the unfortunate guy either way. Had the owner not refunded it we would not have returned, and since then we've returned about 10 times with 7-14 guys every trip plus several referrals that have booked trips there also. All that would have been lost to the camp owner over keeping a $50 deposit."
