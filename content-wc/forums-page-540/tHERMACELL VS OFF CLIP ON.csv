1199311,Moondog,2010-05-11 16:08:00,362,Thermacell seemed to work ok but we had trouble getting and keeping it lit. Also if it is a little windy it did not seem effective. Did have a great idea tho.......Throw a big old box fan in the boat and use it during happy hour to blow the bugs off!!!!

They have all been impressed with them, in the woods there really isn't any wind, so it works good. I could see how it wouldn't work with a decent breeze, but with a decent breeze you really shouldn't have any bugs anyways."
