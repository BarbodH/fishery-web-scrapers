They are up in the shallower bays where the water is about 50F or above along old weed edges and in a few holding areas near spawning grounds. Find the warmer water and the weed edges and there are walleye, and lots of them. This year it looks like the ice will be gone a month before we get there, which is going to be a whole new ball game for us. So, where do you find walleye hanging out a month after ice-out in lakes in that area? It seems like it's going to be mid-June kind of fishing for opener this year. Thanks! George"
1188529,kgeary,2010-04-11 21:48:00,88,"Hi George Your way ahead of the game by asking those questions now. There will be many people fishing many lakes asking the same questions. Unfortunately most will wait until the 3rd day of their trip to ask the questions. Fish location will definitely be different this year than last. I'm on Nungesser lake just a few mile north of Trout Nungesser is a dark water lake. Trout Lake is a clear water lake so it will be a bit different. The walleye should be making their way to mid summer locations. Most of the spawning areas will be long vacant except for the little males and a few big pike. However many of the spawning areas on Trout are in the dark water arms off of the main lake. Look for points coming out of those areas and find structures on or near those points. It could be emerging cabbage weeds, boulder piles, or simply areas of transition from sand to rock or clay to rock or a flat off the point. I can't suggest water depth but a good sonar unit will tell show you pretty quick. I'd start looking in about 6-12 feet but wouldn't rule out 18 feet You can be catching them in 6 feet on a wind blown shoreline one day in one area and 18ft the same day in another. Visualize the route the Walleye will take to their summer haunts. Don't totally ignore those reed lines. When you see the green tips of new reeds sticking out a few casts with spoons will reveal if the shiners are spawning. Typically near small feeder creeks. If so you'll find a nice little pike bonanza and nearby walleye especially in the evening. (If it is not too far off their path) Most of the mid lake humps won't become productive until later into mid June ( july most years) The simplest and surest way to find out is get hold of some groups that normally come up mid june and ask them and or talk to the guides and find out where the go mid june. Of course the camp owner should also know. I hope this helps more than hurts"
1199649,NotEnoughFishin,2010-05-12 12:49:00,4,"Well George, you had the same question I was about to ask. Normally I go to Trout Lake the first or second week of June. This year, I am afraid things will be so different that it will take days to find out where the fish are. The first couple of times I went to Trout in 2002 and 2003, it was the last week of June. Still we went to the same places except Poplar and Long Channel. Fish were 12-15 feet down just beyond the weeds. On windy days, they would be in 5-8 feet where the wind blew. In the evening we would use deep diving crankbaits and would catch big walleyes on the points near Cat Island. This year I will get there on the 5th and I am stocking up on lures to make sure I am prepared. I have heard that since ice out it has been cool and things will not be as drastically different as we fear. Good luck on your trip."
