1198719,Guest,2010-05-10 10:38:00,0,I've never paid much attention to the duty free shops when going into Canada since I do not drink much when I am there and usually like to patronize the Canadian beer store and try something I have not had before. Last year I stopped in the Int Falls duty free on the way home and noticed some pretty good prices on Alcohol. I could not buy since I was heading home but was wondering if the same prices apply on the Canadian side. Can I buy in Fort Frances and pick up in Mn for the trip home? If so is there a limit on what I buy? I know I could buy in Mn and bring back on the way home but would be limited to one liter. Just looking for someone to explain how it works and if I'm missing something. Thanks for all input.
