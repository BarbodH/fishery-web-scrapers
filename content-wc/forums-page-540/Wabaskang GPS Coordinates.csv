1199444,RayRay,2010-05-11 23:56:00,9,We are from Newton but I have a son that goes to UNI so I know your area well. We went up to wabaskang the third week of June last year and the fishing was great and so was the weather. If you are near Gawley's stop by and say Hi.
1197676,WallerChief,2010-05-07 10:02:00,83,"Does anyone have any coordinates for Wabaskang? I don't expect to have anyone give up any of their top fishing spots, but would like to have any water hazards pointed out if possible.Of course if you would like to share your spots I'll keep them a secret for you!"
1197825,Peffley'sCamp,2010-05-07 15:52:00,37,"Chief,Generally speaking, Wabaskang is an extremely safe lake to navigate. There are few (if any) hazards in open water and the other ones are almost all well marked with jugs. A little common sense will go a long way on Wabby, give yourself a reasonable berth around points/islands etc. and stay clear of hazards marked with jugs and you are 99% in the clear."
1197925,Tbum,2010-05-07 20:40:00,12,WallerChief - I sent you a PM.
1197944,Glenman12,2010-05-07 21:31:00,762,Im pretty sure if you find Wabaskand on GoogleEarth it will give you what you are looking for
1198820,trapper_john,2010-05-10 14:46:00,83,"We have been going to Wabbie for years and it's pretty much as earlier stated. The hazards are all pretty well marked and if you read the water, use your head and observation, the reefs off of the islands should be pretty obvious."
1199221,RayRay,2010-05-11 12:34:00,9,Fish the first narrows late in the afternoon and the third narrows during the day.
1199223,RayRay,2010-05-11 12:39:00,9,"When are you going up and where are you staying? We are heading up from Iowa to Gawleys parkview camp on June 5th. We were there last year and the fishing was out of this world, can't wait to get there!"
1199227,Guest,2010-05-11 12:53:00,0,"Ray Ray...My group will be up there also on June 5th. If you were up there last year during this same week expect things to be a little different. With the earlier ice out and warmer temps compared to last year at this time I expect alot more weed growth and the walleyes will be deeper and more scattered. Last year we did excellent with slip bobbers barely moving the minnow in 6 foot of water. Most years light jigs slowly pitched and brought back to the boat work the best. The fishing should stil be fantastic but might be able to use a more aggressive approach is the water temps are higher. Where in Iowa are you travelling from? We are all from Cedar Falls area, staying at Jim and Julies."
1199259,WallerChief,2010-05-11 14:16:00,83,"My group is going up May 29th and staying until June 5th. We're staying at Sleepy Dog Cabins for the 2nd year in row. Tom runs a great camp and we were very pleased last year.This year is about 3 weeks earlier than we fished last year, but I expect the lake to be very similar due to the earlier ice out and warmer temps.Can't wait. I'll try to leave a few for you guys!"
1199336,JayM5209,2010-05-11 17:26:00,1050,"Hey, WallerC., we're going to be in the neighborhood the same week. Will be our 32nd year just down the road at Gold Arrow. We always go back to Aerobus for one day of laker fishing. We'll herd several down into Aerobus Creek and over the falls into Wabbie for you! Have a great week."
