1190973,Skwire,2010-04-18 18:55:00,7,"trp39 We're going to Nemio Outfitters.This will be my first trip to the Gouin. The guys I'm going with have been going to Nemio for a few years, before that they went to Walleye Point.Our original group has split up into 2 or 3 groups this year, due to various reasons. Some of the guys are flying into Little Miss with Airdale, others are going north of Sudbury with Sudbury Aviation. I was suppose to go with the guys to Little Miss, but family commitments had me cancelling this trip, and joining another group later in June that was looking for one more person to even out the group.One our first trip to Lac Hebert, we had a lot of bulk that would not fit in the Beaver and Cessna. Jean told us he had to fly in a new fridge to a cabin later on that day, and would fly it in for no extra charge. It's service like that that ensures repeat clients.....and the great fishing helps too!"
1191250,a3dad,2010-04-19 15:41:00,115,"As far as service goes, Air Tamarac is terrific. They always treat us well and you can relay on them 100 percent. One year driving up the Parent road, I got not one but two flat tires. Fortunately the second one was just as we were arriving in Clova. Jean told me not to worry about it, leave it with him, and go fishing. We we arrived back in base camp a week later, Jean had repaired my tire and mounted it back on my truck. All for $15 Canadian!!!"
1192757,NNYorker,2010-04-24 10:08:00,11,"NY Walleye - I have fished the Gouin with Tamarac outfitters 7 or 8 times and have always had good success. We usually go around the end of June-early July and catch a lot of Walleye. Sarana Bay and Mattawa Bay have both been good. This year we are going up in August, so we'll see how the fishing is that time of year."
1195813,NY Walleye,2010-05-02 10:15:00,78,Bump!
1198916,TheDFP,2010-05-10 18:50:00,39,"I have flown with Air Tamarac to Gouin twice and have another trip planned for June. I cannot complain about the trips I have been on. It is a family run and they continue to invest back into the business, even in these difficult economic times. Every attempt is made to ensure you have an enjoyable vacation. if you have any questions, please feel free to shoot me a PM."
1190514,NY Walleye,2010-04-17 09:38:00,78,Looking for any information that you can provide on Air Tamarac. I am planning a trip to either Gouin or Lake Hebert.If you have any info on the fishing or what bay to stay at Gouin would be great. Thanks for the info!
1190554,Skwire,2010-04-17 12:28:00,7,"NY WalleyeWe've flown in twice to Lac Hebert with Air Tamarac,Once from Clova, the last time from Baskatong, about a 2 hour flight, but it saved us a day of driving and a night at the hotel in Clova.Lac Hebert, the best walleye fishing I have ever experienced!They have upgraded their boats, motors and cabins since we were up in 2007. You won't regret a trip to Lac Hebert.If you have any questions fire away!Marc"
1190675,NY Walleye,2010-04-17 19:25:00,78,"SkWire,Was the fishing that good? They talk about the quality of the walleye, but I am looking to catch quantity. Going with my father, Nephew, and son. Looking to keep the action going throughout the day! Many people have stated to go to Gouin for quantity, but Hebert sound great!How many people where in your group?"
1190742,Skwire,2010-04-18 04:40:00,7,"NYWe were 6 in our group the first year we went, and stayed in a cabin on the main island. The second time (2007) we were 5, as one of the guys had to cancell last minute. We stayed in cabin #25 that time, which is a few miles north of the main camp.The fishing, especially the first time up, was that good! One evening, 4 of us fished until dark, and easily caught 100 walleye in an hour. The next morning, my buddy and I went out and actually counted each fish we caught in an hour. I think it was 40 or 45, and we kept 5 fish, and the average of these was 3 pounds.Fishing is good during the day as well, as the water is tea-like, but certainly, in our experience, the fishing was best early in the morning, and in the evening.If you`re into pike fishing, large northerns are present in the lake as well. A few of the guys went for pike one day and caught some of the biggest northerns they`ve ever seen.I`m going to the Gouin this year with a different group, although not a fly in. Expect a smaller average size on the Gouin, than on Hebert. Lac Hebert is a natural lake, the Gouin is a reservoir. If I had a choice, I would choose Lac Hebert.I`m hoping to get back up to Lac Hebert sometime soon!"
1190770,tpr39,2010-04-18 07:06:00,13,"What outfitter are you fishing with on the Gouin? We've been fishing the Gouin for 20+ years, most with Le Hibou."
1190791,PIKEMAN330,2010-04-18 08:08:00,101,"We fished on Gouin with Air Tamarac once.The drive to Clova was very rough going in.Coming out,it had just been graded and was much better. Air Tamarac is a very good outfitter,boats motors and cabins first class.For Walleyes I would choose Herbert just because it is a natural lake. Good fishing Pikeman"
1190796,retire55,2010-04-18 08:26:00,1029,"Hello TPR39: With 20 years of experience fishing the Gouin, I'd appreciate your comments on the average size of walleye typically caught on the western side of the Gouin. From other reports I have read, I would conclude that the western side of the Gouin is known more for quantity than for quality of walleyes typically caught. I have personally only fished the Gouin once (2005) in the Baie du Nord area. While we caught lots of walleye (14 to 18 inches), the largest walleye caught was about 24 inches. Thanks in advance."
1190880,fosterthedog,2010-04-18 13:06:00,51,NY Walleye I'm going to Hebert 1st week of June. Its my first time there but will let you know how it goes. Met Jean(the outfitter) at the sports show in syracuse was a good guy answered our questions in a straight forward way. 45 days and counting.
1190902,tpr39,2010-04-18 15:16:00,13,"Hello Retiree 55:I have fished the southeastern Gouin 3 times at Wapus Lodge. The rest of my fishing has been in the West. At Wapus we caught bigger and fewer walleyes. Biggest fish 29"" with lots of fish over 20""s. More fish in the west but smaller. Biggest walleye to date from the west was 26"" although over the last three years the average size fish has gotten better with many more 20"" fish than in years past."
1190933,cnydave,2010-04-18 17:22:00,33,"hi. I have fished the Gouin several times, we fished out of the east bay camps , using Cargaier outfitters out of St. Micheal des saints in Quebec.We had excellent trips every time 7 the outfitter was excellent and very professional.Any question slet me know.cnydave."
