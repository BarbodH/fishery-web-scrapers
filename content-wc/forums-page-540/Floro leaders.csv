1198420,celticbass1,2010-05-09 14:00:00,67,"Now that you posted this question you'll get many opinions. I have friends that swear by floro leaders and friends who say you don't need them. In my opinion, if you are trolling, the leader probably isn't required, but try it both ways and see which works best for you. Good luck"

I fish Tablerock Lake in the Ozark highlands, a lake that has 10+ feet visibility during the summer. I have not found a need to use the leader. I think this may be due to the fact most of the strikes are reaction strikes. When I fish BB, I tie the braid to the BB and use Yozuri Hybrid (a fluorocarbon co-polymer) to make the harness. Hope this helps."
