1199494,schandm,2010-05-12 06:47:00,18,We have made this trip from Ohio a number of times and we stay in Wawa. Lot of hotels and restaurants and the timing works great to go on to O'Sullivans next day. Puts you there about 2 PM if you get on the road early from Wawa. just in time for the evening bite.
