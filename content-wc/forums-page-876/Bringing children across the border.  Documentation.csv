531430,Hammerhead Herb,2003-05-22 07:20:00,259,"Next year, I will be bringing my brother-in-law and his son to Canada. My nephew is 12 years old. What documentation does one need when bringing a child across the border? I understand --- and rightfully so --- that documentation is needed from both parents in order to show that the child is not being kidnapped in a child custody dispute. Is that correct? What exactly is required?"
531431,McQ,2003-05-22 07:40:00,615,"A letter from mom outlining her approval, childs birth certificate, destination, length of stay etc. Include a contact phone number and be sure she will be home or at work so an immigration official can speak directly to her if required."
531432,Karl,2003-05-22 19:51:00,63,"Everyone should have a birth certificate. Adults also need a drivers license or some kind of photo ID. I always have my bank notorize my statement that I have permission to bring my daughter into Canada for that specific timeframe.That's all you need. I've never been asked so far (in 10 trips), but better safe than waiting for hours (or denied entry)."
531433,bigfish1965,2003-05-23 05:44:00,3210,DO what McQ said and get a letter from the mother. Include her telephone number and make sure it is a phone where she will be near. It is common for parents in custody battles to try and flee into Canada with the children. Customs watches closely for this stuff.
