Where would be the easiest and best place to get these items? BTW, we are traveling in a 30' Motorhome with a U-Haul trailer. A place just off of the main drag would be nice."

Go to http://www.thebeerstore.ca/ , click on Store and Produsts, click on store locator, type in Sault Ste. Marie, click on submit, than click on the store. This will give you hours and address. Hope this helps."

Then go another 2 miles up great Northern Rd (its also Highway 17 north) You will see a Trading Post/ Esso station combination at corner of fourth line and Highway 17 North. (you are almost out of city because its the last set of traffic lights) get your bait there.If going east of Sault you will eventually be following a fourlane road called Trunk Road , its also Highway 17 east. When you see the A+P grocery store on your right pull into that plaza and there is a Beer Store on that plaza lot. As for bait there is a Highway variety store another 2 miles down the same Trunk Road and on right just after you see Boundary road (thats the last traffic lights also)But not much bait choice, if you can wait drive to town of Thessalon which is an hour further on Highway 17 east and at corner of Highway 17 and highway 129 is a better bait shop its on your left a hundred feet up Highway 129.Hope this helps."
531356,Stehle,2003-05-22 03:45:00,95,"This is a big help. We are heading toward Ignace from there and eventually Savant Lake. Only 4 weeks left and can hardly wait. I will keep this info for the rest of my group. We went through the Sault last year and didn't even think to buy anything there. After the Sault, you have trouble locating anything open. We usually end up in Ignace around 4:30-5:00 am and wait until the bait stores open up. If we can get our leaches early, we can keep on trucking to Savant Lake.BTW, renting a motorhome for this long trip is certainly worth trying. We go up with 6-8 in our party and rotate drivers/copilots. The copilots (shotgun) end up on Moose watch while in Canada. We almost tagged one last year near White River (the driver could've slapped it in the rump he was so close). The motorhome offers a place to sleep for the non-drivers, full kitchen for lunch, and, the most important item, a WC. No more looking for a rest area in the middle of no where.Thanks again,"

531358,Mr Twister 1,2003-05-22 12:41:00,5,"Agree with Fletch that the prices at Duty-free are much better than at The Beer Store, but the selection isn't anywhere near as good. Sault Duty-free usually only carries the real popular brands, I.E. Labatt Blue, Molson Canadian, etc. I think it was two years ago they had any kind of beer you like, as long as the beer you like is Labatt Blue Light! Don't remember if there was something going on to cause the lack of choice or just ""stuff happens"". Anyway, maybe get a case of Blue at Duty-free and a six pack of Kokanee (REALLY great brewski!)as a treat"
531359,Stehle,2003-05-22 12:47:00,95,"If you buy at the duty free, do you have the ""overage"" penalty that our group sometimes pays?"
