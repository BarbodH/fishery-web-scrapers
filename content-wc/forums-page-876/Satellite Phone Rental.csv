531475,Guest,2003-05-23 13:42:00,0,Has anyone tried the sat phone rentals. Any good bad comments on service. I've heard the low end models drop after 5 minutes or so which is fine since this would be strictly an emergency use thing. Last year while gone we had a pipe rupture in sprinkler system at night and my wife freaked. Had she been able to call it would have saved a lot of money for a midnight service call. She could have justed turned a valve.john
