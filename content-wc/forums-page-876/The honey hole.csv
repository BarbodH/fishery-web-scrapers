We all know about the big places to fish LOW, Lac Seul, etc. All the big places are great to fish no doubt, but what about the little places. Everybody has a few of these places where the fish don't jump into the boat all the time, but at times can be the best fishing for a week or two. Not only that but there is no boat traffic and you will only find fishermen out on the lake. So my question is what are your little puddles, rivers whatever that you like to get away to? One my little spots like that would be Mary Jane Reservoir, a close second would be Lake Minnewasta (great Crappie fishing)Fish ON!!"
531371,Trailerguy,2003-05-21 15:56:00,1407,"What you are asking for is what most fishermen take to the grave, myself included."
531372,BD,2003-05-21 23:48:00,739,"After you die huh? Then what do we have to do? Dig you up and ask? Hold a seance? Get some weird old woman to channel you? Train a salmon to sniff your gear and lead us to your spot? Maybe we should just bug your boat and resort to satelite tracking. I bet the NSA allready has your spot triangulated.""An angler is a man who spends rainy days sitting around on the muddy banks of rivers doing nothing because his wife won't let him do it at home."" --- Irish saying"
531373,Birdhunter_007,2003-05-22 04:09:00,2,OK there is one place I always wanted to go back to. I was there about 14 yrs ago. It is a little unnamed lake about 2 days paddle from the RR tracks down the Allenwater River from the bridge. There is one beautiful campsite on the lake overlooking 2 waterfalls as you enter the lake. There is another falls at the other end where the lake exits. Fish below these falls and you can catch all the eyes and pike your arms can handle--one after another. I would like to fly back there again some day and stay for a week.
531374,Stehle,2003-05-22 05:21:00,95,"I'll be at Allenwater in 4 weeks. Is that down the Allenwater river or into it? Can a boat/motor get there? :)Nevermind, I reread your post and saw ""2 DAYS""."
531376,Trailerguy,2003-05-22 07:43:00,1407,"If you need to know, find them the same way I have. If NSA had them triangulated the walleyes would all be gone. In NWO if one local knows your honey hole, you might as well publish it in the New York Times."
531377,Stehle,2003-05-22 08:04:00,95,"Are you kidding? I have found new holes every year that I've gone. Yet, every other boat from camp rushes to the river mouth and jigs. Yeah, you can catch that big fish (and a lot of fish), but there are holes throughout the lake that we go to that also produce. It is nice to fish, though, without another boat in sight. Maybe I shouldn't say anymore, you may want to know where this lake is."
531375,Birdhunter_007,2003-05-23 06:18:00,2,"Stehle, When I went down the Allenwater many years ago, my buddy and I had driven all night long to make the train at Armstrong at 6 a.m. We began our trip at the Allenwater Bridge and paddled across the lake to the first portage (around some rapids). As we were loading the canoe I noticed fins and tails breaking the surface in the shallow water below the rapids. My buddy asked what kind of fish I thought those were. I told him they were probably spawning suckers (early June) and not to waste time there since I had never seen walleyes breaking the surface on a bright sunny day. Downstream at the next portage, we noticed the same thing. This time we decided to try fishing and began catching a bunch of walleyes. If I was staying at the lake by the Allenwater Bridge, I would be sure to walk the portage and drop a line in below the rapids just to check it out. Good luck!!"
531378,Guest,2003-05-23 10:54:00,0,"I thought I knew you Trailorguy. It's good to hear from you again. I'm kinda with you, although I will give out one honey hole. Lake Nunnya. Every fisherman knows where it is at."
531379,Guest,2003-05-23 17:32:00,0,"My favorite honey hole is on a lake in the Clearwater/Jackfish area near Emo. My 5 brothers, Dad, uncle, and myself found a boat-in outpost that we enjoyed and did well at. There was one spot in a channel between an island and the mainland that had some interesting underwater structure, and we had caught several walleyes at mid-day. We made a plan to go back to that spot at about 7pm to see if we could pick up a few more. We all anchor and start jigging with minnows and crawlers. Nothing happens. 1 hour later nothing still. Finally, at about 8:30, the other 2 boats decide they've had enough for the night, and are going back to camp - leaving my Dad and I anchored there. Not 30 seconds after they pull out, the walleyes start hitting. In the span of about 20 minutes, Dad and I caught about 40 walleyes. I don't know how many times we had doubles, but we were laughing till tears came because we were slaughtering them and we could still hear the other guy's motors running on the way back to camp. They just about died when we brought back a limit of walleye and all were 18"" - 25"". That is one of my favorite fishing memories. Needless to say, EVERYONE sits on that honey hole now every night till dark, and we always hit fish. I love Canadian fishing!"
