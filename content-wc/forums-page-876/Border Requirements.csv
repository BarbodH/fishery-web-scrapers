I have heard mixed stories about whether you need a birth certificate as well. I understand that having the extra document will make it easier, but just want to know if they will turn you around without it."
531396,McQ,2003-05-21 10:42:00,615,Carrying your birth certificate is a good move along with at least one piece of photo ID. You'll find it most valuable when returning to the States - US Immigration is not in a fooling around mood. Make it easy for them to recognize your citizenship.

531399,Guest,2003-05-22 08:06:00,0,Thanks for the feedback. Leaving tomorrow morning at 5:00am from Chicago. Hope to be up at the border around 4:00pm. Any ideas on what the approx. waiting time might be? Heading to Dryden(Best Western) friday night and then onto North Star Camp saturday a.m. (Clay Lake).Cannot wait to latch onto that first fish. Pure adrenaline rush!
