531471,Guest,2003-05-22 21:53:00,0,Hi. I plan on taking my boat up to the border on empty. Just wondering what the price of gas is at Baudette for regular. we are coming from chicago and staying the night at black bear cansino for the night before going onto sioux narrows through Baudette. Hate that toll bridge at fort francis with a passion. That ##### paper mill has been collecting tolls for ever. Only toll bridge that I know of to into canada. Anyway now that we go to sioux narrows we skip the backup and cross at Baudette. thanks.
