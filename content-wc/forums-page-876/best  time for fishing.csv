One thing that has always puzzled me is the idea of an ""optimum"" period for a specific area. The idea was planted in my head when the owner of a fly-in resort in the English River area indicated that in his experience, the days around June 4th were the best fishing days on his lakes. I now frequent lakes further to the north and was wondering whether anyone had an opinion about the best week to be on a lake in the Red Lake area? By best I mean in terms of size of fish and numbers. Thanks for the input."

In other words 1st week in June vs 2nd week doesn't matter good weather vs bad (lots of fronts) does matter more. Given everything else I have settled on the first week in June. Slightly more consistent weather (whatever that is for this part of the world) than the opener and still in post spawn pattern. I have gone a few times in August and although the weather is a lot better the fish tended to be smaller. Bugs tend to be a lot bigger issue then too. Given I come from the desert SW cold / rain doesn't bother me, kind of like the change, and the fishing tends to be better for size. Just my two cents.Bob"

Seems that in June you are still getting the last of the males from the spawning ground hangouts - We see the fish in July in more traditional reef/drop structures..."
