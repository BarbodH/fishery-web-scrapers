531434,Guest,2003-05-22 07:22:00,0,I thought I remember some chatter about using cell phones as walkie talkie's some time back. Something about signing up through Thunder Bay for a minimal charge and getting access in Canada. Does anybody have any info on this? How much? Is there service on Lac Seul? How do you go about signing up? etc.Thanks15 days and counting.

Some cellular providers do have ""roaming"" service in NW Ontario, but the bottom line is that you have to be able to ""see"" a transmitter tower to communicate with it. So your service would work in downtown Dryden or Sioux Lookout, but will not work on Hwy 502 or on Lac Seul. You can rent ""satellite phones"" for $120 per month, which I'm thinking of doing this year. They work anywhere in the world."
531437,Guest,2003-05-23 13:08:00,0,We have that two-way system in our Public Works department through ClearNet it works better than their celluar service IMHO. Its a pay per use feature. If they offer that feature up north your phone needs to be two-way capable because the ones we use are special phones. The average cell phone doesn't have two-way capability to my knowledge.Crawdaddy
