531301,Guest,2003-05-22 21:33:00,0,"I have a marine safety booklet i got at the all canada show here in chicago last winter and all it says about radios is "" to make a distress call use channel 16 or 156.8Mhz."" I dont know if any one will hear you but I have read the some of the resorts with a fleet of guide boats out like tomahawk have marine radios on ther boat and monitor that channel. I have one so I will have to call a radio check and see if anyone responds. I am going up the 31st hope the fishing s good and i dont find too many rocks."
