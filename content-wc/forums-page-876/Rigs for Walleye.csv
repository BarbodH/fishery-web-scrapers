Looks like others have said that 1/8, 1/4 and 3/8 jigs in chart., white, pink and orange are good, either tipped with minnows or 2 inch tails. When fishing for Walleye, 1) do you need a steel leader? 2) Is Berekley Trilene XT 6 # test ok? What would you suggest? 3) Finally, at Lac Seul, do you need bottom bouncers or walleye rigs/spinners, or are everyday jigheads tipped with minnow or tail sufficient? Thanks very much for you help - cant wait to get up thereHap"
531303,Guest,2003-05-21 19:24:00,0,1. No leaders2. I use fireline because you can feel the bottom and the strikes better.3. I rarely use bottom bouncers or harnesses of any kind; I have a pile of them with me but I am jig fishing for walleye nearly all the time.

The just can't seem to stand that bait wiggling in front of their nose and have to eat it! Also prefer the 3"" or even 4"" twisters and instead of 2"", but that's my opinion. My father used to use the 2"" on 1/16 oz. heads and catch plenty of fish, but has since changed his ways and upsized to the 3"" as well."
