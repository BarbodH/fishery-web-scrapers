I don't mind the video content, but your theme song in the video is horrific. Either add the BIG WHEEL, delete the video from YouTube or hire somebody that knows how to produce a better video and song than your family members.......obviously there was heavy drinking involved during the production of the current video.

6346872,eyecatcher1,2019-08-03 11:43:00,323,"Our group had a similar experience back before passports. One guy had a DUI many years earlier and had no problems for about 5 years. That year they let him pay $250 for a week long get out of jail free pass, I guess. They said they didn't want to ruin 9 other guy's trip. He was told when he got home to fill out some paperwork to prove that he was rehabilitated. He learned that he had to pay another $250 to file the paperwork. He never did it, but told us that he did. About 6 years later when he was riding with me they caught him again. They told me that I was welcome in Canada, but I had to get him out of Canada right now! They even stood in the road until I disappeared over the bridge."

6347000,eyecatcher1,2019-08-04 07:55:00,323,"They seem to know everything about the driver or owner of the vehicle when you pull up to that window in Canada. Three years ago I bought a new truck after having the old one for 12 years. The first thing the border guys says to me is ""I see that you got a new truck."" A few years earlier we changed resorts and the guy says ""Going to a new resort?"" They have a lot of info on us in their system."
6347002,That Minnesota guy,2019-08-04 08:16:00,8293,"Maybe Google is a front for the FBI and they have as much info on each of us? Ya know, use our tax dollars for the gathering cost. Skim a bunch of the ad revenue. Ummmm, I might be onto something here."

6338452,guest61,2019-07-07 14:14:00,7,Found out a member of our party has a misdemeanor of theft from 3 years ago. Will there be an issue at the border or have people in the same situation been allowed to enter Canada?
6338472,Upnorth1085,2019-07-07 15:31:00,7,"It all depends what the crime was. They match the crime against our criminal code. If it’s a summary offence here, and there’s no other skeletons hiding, they should allow him in. Be advised that a lot of crimes don’t match up. DUI being the most obvious one."
6338476,guest61,2019-07-07 15:37:00,7,Summary offense? From what I know it was a misameaner A and he has an otherwise spotless record.
6338484,That Minnesota guy,2019-07-07 15:48:00,8293,Have him drive his own vehicle. If he isn't allowed in he can drive himself home. No sense ruining everybody's trip.
6338486,Walleye2242,2019-07-07 16:04:00,263,"honestly and from my experinces.....the border will do whatever they want, when they want. We had a guy in our group that had gone up for 20 years and had an assault/battery on his record the whole time....never bothered him...ever and then 1 year we had a guy with a DUI...he didnt get in and we knew that was a chance so he was just going to get a room in I. Falls and fish rainy until we came back....they also decided not to let our other friend come over that had been coming over the past 20 years, who 3 weeks before was in canada in toronto earlier. So...you just never know. No matter what the border fold tell you over the phone and how much you pay for paperwork."
6338492,The tank,2019-07-07 16:44:00,340,I would think it's possible that a class A misdemeanor could be a felony in canada. 1st time dui in Illinois is a misdemeanor and is considered a felony in canada. I would say he will be denied entry into canada if they catch it.
6338498,Skyraptor,2019-07-07 18:11:00,291,"Sounds like it would be classified as a Summary Conviction Offences under Section 322 & 334, theft under $5,000. The Tank, a DUI is a felony in Canada regardless of how it is classified in the states."
6338500,The tank,2019-07-07 18:14:00,340,That's what I'm saying. His misdemeanor maybe considered a felony up there just like a dui.
6346832,guest61,2019-08-03 08:05:00,7,Just an update. Our member who had the misdemeanor had no problem crossing into Canada. He had a passport and was never questioned on his conviction. The crossing guard was more interested in the minor child that we had. Had all his paperwork and notes from both parents.
6346838,Upnorth1085,2019-08-03 08:28:00,7,"Good to hear. Yeah, they are keying on minors now. One of our guards at Emerson let a father in with his four kids, who he was suppose to have no contact with, through without checking. Never talked to the kids or checked. Thankfully, the FBI and RCMP were able to track his bank transfer, and got the kids and arrested the guy and his wife."
