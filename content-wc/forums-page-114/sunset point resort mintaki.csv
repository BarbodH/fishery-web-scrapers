Also some big northerns (I didn't catch them but 40 and 43 inches were caught in my boat). The walleye fishing, for me, was tough. There are also smallmouth, which we didn't fish, but caught incidentally.I am not sure I can recommend for walleye, but a resounding yess for everything else.Frank"

The walleye fishing can be fantastic - we do a lot of drifting - jigs, or bottom bouncers with spinners.. You can do well close to your resort in Gun Lake or run up to Big Sand. message me if you have specific questions - we will be in a 20ft Ranger Tiller (grey with red stripe)and a white 115 Johnson.
