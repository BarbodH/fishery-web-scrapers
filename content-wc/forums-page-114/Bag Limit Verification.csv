From the way I understood, kids under 18 either help the parent or guardian with 1 limit or the kid underage has to get his/ or her own license to get their own limit. I would not monkey around and just buy the minor a license."

Most non-Canadian residents require an Outdoors Card and Recreational Fishing Licence to fish in Ontario, including those 65 years of age or older. The following exceptions apply:  Non-Canadian residents under 18 years of age may fish without an Outdoors Card and licence if accompanied by a person who has a valid Ontario Recreational Fishing Licence. Any fish kept are part of the catch and possession limit of the person who holds the licence. Alternatively, non-Canadian residents under 18 years of age may purchase an Outdoors Card and Recreational Fishing Licence to have their own limits."

6346698,mixedbag,2019-08-02 18:06:00,76,"Back in the 70's a kid in rural Sask on a Friday night could park the combine close to the shed, jump into the P/U ,drink beer and drive without a license. At least, thats what we told ourselves. On one of those excursions, the RCMP pulled up behind us, the driver panicked and stalled the ""three on a tree""a couple times before we were pulled over. ""Whos over 16 and sober?"" the cop demanded. Rick, who was sitting to my right raised his hand. Didnt matter that Rick did not have a valid drivers license..... he had a fishing license that showed DOB. ""OK"" said the cop...then you drive home.Go Green!!!!

6339990,Kansas Bound,2019-07-12 10:47:00,152,"From reading the Saskatchewan fishing regulations it appears Nonresident's under 16 do not need a fishing license. I did not read anything about that youth being able to keep any for lunch. For example a father takes his 12 year old daughter fishing. One license is purchased for the father, is the bag limit 4 or 8 walleyes?"
6340072,kettyspanky,2019-07-12 14:26:00,271,"From what I have read about Ontario fishing, The minor can help with the parent or guardians bag limit. The kids can't keep any for themselves. That's the way I understand Ontario's law. I'm guessing Saskatchewan is the same. Maybe someone else can help you."
6340080,The tank,2019-07-12 14:48:00,340,A child can fish without a license with an adult but you can only keep your limit. That would be with a full license for walleye 4. The child can help fill yours be he or she would not have a limit unless you buy them a license.
6340178,3M TA3,2019-07-12 18:42:00,2846,So I take it a 15 year old can't go fishing by themselves. That sucks. I spent many days fishing by myself as a youngster and can't even imagine who I would have become if that wasn't allowed.
6340296,WallyWarrior,2019-07-13 03:49:00,2488,"Just buy them a license. A small part of the cost overall. Buy my boy one every year, started at 7 yrs old. Money goes toward a good cause and really cuts down the confusion. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6340318,Shellback,2019-07-13 05:46:00,8083,Interesting point. Are there different rules for resident or non resident anglers? Seems odd if a resident 12 y/o couldn't keep fish he caught in a local lake.
6340334,The tank,2019-07-13 06:15:00,340,I'm sure residents rules would be different. Not sure on keeping fish. What a license cost I would guess they would just get one.
6340986,Kansas Bound,2019-07-15 10:17:00,152,I called the phone number listed in the regulations. The lady indicated that the child under 16 does not need a license and he is treated as his/her own individual fisherman. She indicated that the adult would have a limit of 4 walleye and the child would have a limit of 4 walleye. I would like to see that in writing but it sounds optimistic.
6340998,Juls,2019-07-15 10:55:00,13414,That's how it is on the Ontario side of Lake Erie here.
6341004,BreezyPoint,2019-07-15 11:09:00,1581,"No it isn't that way on the Ontario side. Page 8 of the regulations clearly states that a youth, under 18, counts their catch as part of the limit of the person taking them out who has a license. It states that if they want their own limit, they can buy a license.Frank"
