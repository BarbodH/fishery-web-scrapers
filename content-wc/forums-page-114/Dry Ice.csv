We left camp with fish that weren't frozen, so I wanted to get sufficient ice to freeze the fish and ensure they remained frozen for the two day drive home to southern Michigan. I bought 15# of dry ice which proved to be enough, however, I was shocked that I had to pay almost $60 US for the ice. Curious if this cost is representative of what dry ice is going for in this part of Ontario."

Even though 2 bucks a pound seems cheap, you can only get it in 10 lb plus increments. Stuff isn't cheap, but it can be worth it. Most places don't have it anymore."
