6341400,Peterpikes,2019-07-16 12:42:00,33,Headed up tomorrow night to fish Du Male. Looks like some warm weather Friday/Saturday followed by some nice 70 degree days. Has anyone been up there lately? Water level still high? Early reports had everything 2 weeks behind....is everything back on schedule now? Anyone have any recent reports? Thanks!
6342740,smallcal,2019-07-21 06:24:00,119,"Got home last night from a week at Baie du Nord. Great time as always.Conditions - Lake is higher than normal by quite a bit, by our eye. Had two quite bad storms while we were there in the evening, one took down a couple of trees and the caretaker said it was one of the two worst storms in the last four years. Daytime sunshine was hot when it was out. Surface water temps varied from 67 to 75 F with the highest as you would expect, on sunny days in the backs of the shallower bays. Storms, as always, came up within 30 minutes so be ready to make runs to camp the moment you see them coming, otherwise seek immediate shelter!Fishing - As good or better than when we were there 4 years ago. Backtrolling worm harnesses worked as always, seemed to be mood of the fish for which blade (I preferred stainless willow but chartreuse Colorado was very effective at times). Bead color did not seem to matter. 10-20 feet was where we found most. Crankbaits, when used were fairly effective when used (close to harnesses). Since we backtroll and speeds are lower, deeper divers worked better - TDD09 and DJHJ12 were producers for me.Some other guests and the caretaker were crushing walleye on jigs with leeches, to the tune of 10 in 30 minutes at times.We are there for a good time and rest, so quantity of fish is usually not a concern but have to say it was excellent. Four guys, 6 days, we only brought home fish 17""-18"" but was not difficult to fill the limit. Ate quite a few there as well. Threw back at least a full limit over the slot, best two being 24.5 and 25"" - the latter being 6 lbs. Pike were ancillary, with a 36"", 9 lb the best.Roads - going up (St Anne Du Lac through Parent to Baie Du Nord) were excellent. Storms while we were there changed that. Yesterday the Clova-Parent road was potholed and rutted more than on the way in. Also, they placed grey/black gravel for a good portion which is quite loose.All-in-all a great trip. Let me know if you have any questions.Thank you.PS - as an aside, the 'new' caretaker Jan (yon) who is in his 4th year there is excellent. Very attentive and very helpful."
6345508,Peterpikes,2019-07-30 09:51:00,33,"Returned from another great trip to the Gouin with Caesars North Camps (16 years in a row). Fished the Lac Du Male area 7/19 through 7/26. Fishing was great, best trip we have had in the last 3 or 4 years. Biggest walleye was 26.5” and biggest Pike was 37”. We caught about 25 walleye over 20” and countless smaller then 20”. We didn’t get a trophy pike over 40”, but landed a few in the mid 30’s. The weather was great, we had 2 warm days followed by 5 days of mid 70’s with lower 50’s at night. Almost every morning was cool and cloudy so fishing started great everyday, but slowed some when the sun got overhead. Had a few quick rain showers, but no major storms that effected the fishing. Surface temps were between 67 and 71 all week. Water level was extremely higher then normal, but dropped about 1” during the week. Found lots of walleye in the 9’ to 15’ range, but had better luck with larger fish in the 17’ to 23’ range. Oddly we caught our 3 biggest walleye 26.5” 25” and 24.5” in 10’ of water throwing spoons for pike. Caught more walleye on spoons then I ever have before. Silver seemed to out fish gold and colored spoons. Caught the most on a silver Mepps Syclops, no trailer. Caesars supplied exceptional service as always (thanks Oliver, John and crew). I couldn’t be more happy with this outfit and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a remote trip. They are constantly making upgrades and changes to make the trip more enjoyable. To anyone not familiar with the Gouin it’s a few hours north of Montreal. You do need to travel the last 130 miles on dirt logging roads, but they are well maintained with grooming trucks, we average around 60mph on the road. At the end of the road is a small town called Clova. There is a diner and a place to gas up, but that’s about it. Just about all the people you will meet here are fellow fishermen waiting to fly out. The small lake is shared by 2 or 3 other outfits that use it as a runway. From what I hear it’s much busier during the snowmobile season. From Clova it’s a short flight maybe around 20 minutes to the outpost cabin. It’s a trip of a lifetime and I consider myself lucky to do it annually. Only 50 more weeks before our next trip. Can’t wait."
6346502,Freytown,2019-08-02 06:58:00,770,"Pp, Wow you had a great trip, but I'm not surprised. Caesars sounds like their dialed in and I know the location well. Very remote and endless areas to fish and explore. Can you post any pic's? ""Ya done good"". FT"

6338722,smallcal,2019-07-08 13:09:00,119,"Have to ask one more time. Leaving Friday and already having trouble sleeping. Worms arrive tomorrow, most of my gear is packed. We usually backtroll in 12-15' of water for walleye. Never have targeted pike before, but hope to some this year.Tight lines!"
6338748,vteye3,2019-07-08 14:40:00,496,"Smallcal - bottom bouncers saved our last trip up there. It was early June, bite was inconsistent and trolled bottom bouncers till we found fish. I like the 1, 1.5 and 2 oz as they will cover the 5-25 foot depths so common on Gouin. Good luck look forward to your report."
6338758,Peterpikes,2019-07-08 14:55:00,33,"I’m headed up next Friday. Counting the days...smallcall have you ever fished the Gouin before? Which outfitter are you using? I go annual, this will be my 17th year. If you want pike then spoons are always a great choice. My favorite is the half wave, but Williams warbler, Johnson silver minnow, dare devils, dr. Spoons etc will all catch fish. I’ve had a lot of luck trolling suick baby Cisco kids. The walleye and pike go crazy for them at times...it became my groups go to for trolling. I have also had a lot of luck using 7” rapala original floater behind a bottom bouncer...I only do this on hot sunny days when the fish go deeper, but it’s a great way to present your bait on the bottom at slow speeds...usually 20’ to 35’ deep. Every year is different though, what works one year might not work the next."
6338778,tweedrules,2019-07-08 15:59:00,107,"Just got back from the Gouin. Very hot last week. Water level is very high but going down each day. We fish three ways up there. We throw spoons into the weedbeds for Pike, troll (Hot N Tots, Thin fins, Flicker shads etc..) and jig for walleye at night. We limited out on Walleye after three days. Best we've ever done that early. Walleye fishing was very good. Found fish at 10 feet all the way up to 18 feet. Pike fishing was slow until Friday 7/5 and 7/6. We found that anything VERY shiny worked better than painted spoons such as 5 of dimonds and red and white dare devils. I had great success with a spoon called a frisbee in all silver. It was made by a company in the NY Finger lakes called sutton spoon company. It's lighter than most spoons. Kind of like a Williams Wobbler. Trolling we did best on gold stuff. Full gold Hot N Tots and Thin fins worked well. 364 days until we go back. Can't wait. Have fun up there."
6338780,tweedrules,2019-07-08 16:01:00,107,Half wave worked great as well.
6338962,smallcal,2019-07-09 06:39:00,119,"Thanks for the responses! This is my 5th or 6th time going up, but has been 4 years since the last trip (health, weddings, etc.). Last time we were lucky, everything was 2 weeks late and the wind blew to a bay near camp for the week prior to our arrival. A group of 6, we ended up with 8 - 25""+ with the largest a little over 28 (yes, walleye!) We stay at Baie Du Nord, comfortable and our leader has been going there for 15+ years so we are treated very well.Thank you for the info on the spoons, have the Len Thompsons ready, also have a can of chrome spray paint in cast they don't like the colors I have!Thanks again. Tight lines! Will report on our return!"

6339796,tshea,2019-07-11 20:36:00,36,I am going back up tomorrow - will give an update
6340304,Freytown,2019-07-13 05:00:00,770,"Nice eye!! I can't wait to return either. IMO, the Gouin is the best $value$ for eyes and NPike in southern Quebec. And remember you can drive to many good locations and eliminate the plane costs and extra weight charges. Win-win in my book. FT"
6329912,tweedrules,2019-06-11 05:49:00,107,"Hello all, Trying to get an update on the gouin? Water level, weather, fishing report. 18 days until I hit Lac Du male for the 12th year. Can't wait. Tight Lines. Chris Grange"
6330678,sbe2,2019-06-13 06:00:00,63,Leaving tomorrow and will report back next week. Fishing Lac du Male area as well.
6330698,tweedrules,2019-06-13 06:36:00,107,"AWESOME. Have a great trip. Let me know if Daniele and Louise are still the care takers. They have been there the last two years and are such great people. Also, how deep are the walleye for jigging. Tight Lines!!!!!!"
6331728,Freytown,2019-06-17 06:03:00,770,"Gouin is full. I fished Jun7 to June 13, everything is two weeks behind. Water temp ranged 52* to 58* degrees. Walleye were not back from spawning grounds. NPike bite very well and walleye bite improved each day. My last day (6/13) bite was very good but not where it should have been.Filling my quota (8 walleye) was done with ease @ Pointe aux Dore' Baie du Sud. Wind was the worst I have ever experienced in 31 trips to the Gouin, but weather everywhere is not normal to say the least. Have a great trip. FT"
6331848,tweedrules,2019-06-17 11:13:00,107,FT thanks so much for the update. Glad you had a great time.
6333026,tshea,2019-06-20 16:36:00,36,"I have been up twice so far this year - the water is very high - last trip was last weekend - as someone mentioned everything is 2 weeks behind - water temp was 53 deg. F on sunday (16th) Fish were not biting, just sitting on the bottom - Heading back up tomorrow hopefully things will improve. We are on Mattawa Bay."
6334758,kegisfly,2019-06-26 09:33:00,22,"Our group of 4 fished Saraana East with Air Tamarac from 6/18 till 6/22/19. We had some of the worst walleye fishing in 8 trips to the Gouin. We also had very inconsistent pike fishing. The reservoir was at max full level and maintained the same level for all 5 days. The surface water temp was between 61 & 65°F. It started at 61° and ended at 65°. Everything seems 1 or 2 weeks behind even last year's late ice out and potentially several weeks behind in general. Pollen was thick on the water. Specifically about walleye: They were either still transitioning from breeding grounds, off the bite, or still not schooled up yet. We tried multiple areas and could not find concentrations of fish. We were catching them in everything from 3 to 30 feet of water, but, more consistently in 8 to 18 feet of water. We mostly jigged for walleye, but, tried some trolling to find schools. Trolling was only consistently productive for about an hour on one evening. Average fish size seemed smaller this year. We did put a 26"" and 22"" walleye in the boats. We found a feeding school of nice sized fish in about a 20 yard by 20 yard area (and 8 to 15 ft of water) the very last day when water temps were about 64 or 65°F. Pike fishing was inconsistent. We would hit flurries and then catch 1 or 2 or nothing for an hour. We only caught a few small pike while jigging. The largest pike was 32"" while casting a spoon off the dock. We caught 6 or 8 pike off the dock with minimal time spent. We spent some time casting for pike, but, it was not very productive in numbers or size. There was not much grass in the traditional grass beds. This was either due to the increased water level or late start in the growing season. We tried some casting at windblown shores with steep drops and had some success. We spent less time pike fishing this year because we spent so much time trying to find walleye schools. The weather was great and typical for the area. I would say the temps ranged from 45 to 75°F. Everyday had some sun, some clouds, and a rain shower. Winds were mostly moderate, with a few time periods of light to calm winds. There were some periods of fairly strong winds, but, not enough to get blown off the water. The typical wind direction was out of the North. Probably periods of 2 or 3 days would have been tough fishing (with respect to wind) on the main bay. Our neighbors, who mostly trolled for walleye, had a tough week also. The pair only put 5 to 10 fish in the boat daily. Except the last day. They caught a lot of walleye in the afternoon/evening. I believe that the fish are starting to school up and turn on!!! Have fun,"
6334768,tweedrules,2019-06-26 10:00:00,107,Thanks for the update. Hope it picks up. We leave Sunday.
6335258,Freytown,2019-06-27 16:34:00,770,"the more water the more places to hideIMO, you had perfect temps as 65* is what walleye's love. Pike have a lot of places to roam at full pool and that requires at lot of searching, but they & the walleye should have been near the bank. Nuff said................ FT"
6337330,smallcal,2019-07-03 11:07:00,119,"Bringing this back up to see if there was any new information. Heading up on the 12th and want someone to tell me worm harnesses are not working so I can justify the money and time spent on all of these lures and artificials to lug north with me! Always have a great time, any info would be helpful. Assume the levels are still high, but we have dealt with it before.Thanks!"
