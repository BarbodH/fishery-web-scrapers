6349498,eyecatcher1,2019-08-12 16:18:00,323,Both mine and my wife's passport expired this year and we went with the enhanced license. It was the same as a passport for us at the border. My daughter's drivers license expired and in Minnesota they recommended her getting the enhanced license because they say in a few years a regular license will be almost useless for an ID.
6349520,CI_Guy,2019-08-12 18:05:00,2118,"In MN there is the regular license, the real ID license and the enhanced license. The regular license will be almost useless as an ID in a couple years. The real ID will be acceptable for getting on a domestic flight and the enhanced will work like a passport card for land and sea border crossings in North America. The legislature should have gone with the real ID 8 years ago and the regular license shouldn't exist any more."
6349616,eyecatcher1,2019-08-13 07:15:00,323,I didn't know there were three. They just told her the regular driver's license would be useless pretty soon.
6348518,CI_Guy,2019-08-09 11:00:00,2118,"To the OP you should be able to cross the border both ways with a drivers license and birth certificate. Just not as pleasant of a crossing. To those who say your not required to have a passport to get back into the US, the law says you need a passport or passport card to reenter the US by land or sea. If you don't have a passport or card you will be allowed to reenter the US after a delay and hassle at the border. Here it is from a US Gov't. passport site: U.S. citizens who travel to Canada must present a valid passport to re-enter the United States by air or a passport, passport card or other approved WHTI and WHTI-compliant document when entering by land or sea. A Nexus card is also enough to gain entrance to Canada by land, sea and air. Here is the website if you want to check it out.https://www.us-passport-service-guid...uirements.html"
6348644,BreezyPoint,2019-08-09 19:23:00,1581,"You are correct, they will eventually let you in if you are a U.S. citizen. BUT, they can certainly make it miserable for you. I have seen a friend of mine get delayed for four hours (hours, not weeks), but it was not a pleasant experience. I would err on the side of caution and have the proper documentation.Frank"
6348654,Obabikon,2019-08-09 20:26:00,2370,"There are some misconceptions here. So... the Canadian side, driver's license is all that is required. That's the law. They like passports, because their system is easier to use with them. On the US side... the law is that a passport is required. However, they will let a US citizens into the country. They might run your plates, they might run your drivers license... they might do a back ground check... and it certainly increases your chance of being searched. But, they will let a US citizen in. However, the law is that a passport is required. Anyone saying something other than that is not telling factual information. Obviously, exceptions are made regularly. As someone who crosses the border 30-40 times a year, and has in the range of 800 guests crossing every year...... there's lots of stories out there. Good border crossings, bad border crossings. I have found that if you have everything in order, it is easier for you to cross. If everyone stopped bringing their passports... they would change the way things are done, and cut back on the exceptions. My suggestion is that everyone bring a passport. It is the law. People who have lost/forgotten a passport... use the current leniency."
6348744,eyecatcher1,2019-08-10 09:01:00,323,An enhanced driver's license is as good as a passport on the American side if you're traveling by land.
6348770,Kevin23,2019-08-10 09:43:00,2205,"You dont need a passport to travel to most locations. Some airports and countries may require one from US travelers but most dont... Youll just possibly be hung up and subject to questioning and possibly denied access if they dont believe you. You never need a passport to get back on US soil. You just have to prove you are an american citizen and you are who you say you are. You have a right to enter your country. You will need some sort of documentation proving you are yourself and a citizen though, gov issued photo ID, birth cert, soc card, named mail proving an address (bank statement, utility bill), marriage license, etc. The more and better proof you have, the faster youll get home. Passport is definitely the easiest and fastest."
6348790,3M TA3,2019-08-10 11:38:00,2846,"Here, for any misunderstandings from US DHS. https://www.dhs.gov/enhanced-drivers...-what-are-they.Ron"
6348872,Obabikon,2019-08-10 18:07:00,2370,"Enhanced drivers licenses are indeed acceptable. However, please don't confuse ENHANCED drivers licenses with the drivers licenses that 99% of people in the US have. A drivers license is insufficient form of ID to cross into the US. If you are a US citizen, they will let you in eventually... once they feel legitimate proof has been given. You can get.... Nexus card Passport Enhanced Driver's License (please don't confuse with a standard DL) Passport card All acceptable. This wasn't really the point of the original post, but alternative options are available."
6348906,3M TA3,2019-08-10 20:45:00,2846,"In post #25 Obabikon clearly states that ""the law is that a Passport is required."" Then, in post #29, he goes on to say that there are other forms of ID that are acceptable as well. I'm pretty sure he doesn't know what the law is as I think most of us here do not, perhaps 99% (another made up statistic) Just spewing bull. I only suggest this for all curious about crossing back into the US by land or sea from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. https://www.dhs.gov/enhanced-drivers...-what-are-they Know also that in 2020 some surprises will be coming. I suggest everyone be prepared. Really, read the link and delve just a bit deeper. Obabikon is right. This wasn't part of the OP's post. But it darn well is applicable."
6349244,Obabikon,2019-08-11 20:02:00,2370,"You are correct... just a sarcastic made up statistic. However, I do handle a ton of drivers licenses from my guests (daily)... doing fishing licenses. Enhanced drivers licenses aren't overly common. Is that better? Having handled several hundred so far this year, I would be surprised if I've seen more than 5. I certainly have seen two that I remember, so not many. From what I've read, there are currently 5 states that even offer Enhanced drivers licenses. Michigan, Minnesota, NY, Vermont, and Washington. You basically have to request them when getting your license, and then pay an additional fee. I'm not going to calculate how many people live in those states, and what percentage of those people from those states have Enhanced DL's... but 5 out of 50 is 90%, (then if less than half of the people from those states didn't bother with the Enhanced DL, that would be 95%... then add that 20% of the population are under 16 and can't have a driver's license... I wouldn't be surprised if I'm within a couple of percentage points of correct, but I am happy to admit it was just a guess. I would bet money that it is 98% of the population or fewer. I could be wrong though. For people on the other side... it sounds like Ontario is doing away with their Enhanced Driver's License program."
6349446,PRO-V16,2019-08-12 13:46:00,454,My passport card expired this spring so I got the enhanced DL. Went through Fort Francis and it was smooth sailing. I'm the only one I know that has one.
6347740,bassnblast,2019-08-06 18:18:00,56,I always keep a picture of my passport on my phone. While it's not 'the real thing' it could make it easier for border patrol to look it up - or a US embassy or consulate to reissue - in the event I ever lost it!
6347872,Guest,2019-08-07 10:03:00,0,Dong Says: You do not need a passport to enter Canada but can do it on a drivers license. Getting back into the country will be the same if you bring your birth certificate. Dong also thinks your passports will be found either under the seat or in the pair of pants you were last wearing
6347874,rockape,2019-08-07 10:03:00,215,"You are 100% wrong on it being required to have a passport to reenter the US. Border guards absolutely have to let US citizens back in. Drivers License and birth cert are 100% ok. Same with going into Canada. I have spoken to border guards on both sides , and it truly is no big deal at all if you don't have a passport. Have a great trip!"
6347876,Golden Eagle,2019-08-07 10:07:00,2642,"Mike, I suggest a visit to U.S. side of the border to discuss situation with border guards. I'm pretty sure they will make reentry easy for you. Knowing ahead of time will make your fishing week more enjoyable and sleep will be better and longer each night. Will you be fishing LV?"
6347912,eyemike,2019-08-07 11:55:00,233,"Hi Connie, I'm going up to see Brett and Judy. I got a letter from Brett giving the dates the we will be there. I have copies of our passports, birth certificates, and hotels we are staying at. I'll go and see what happens. I hope that you are doing well."
6347960,3M TA3,2019-08-07 14:43:00,2846,"seems we go through this every year. A passport or enhanced drivers license is not required to enter either direction. As a minimum you should have some sort of Gov't ID and birth certificate. You may suffer delays, most likely coming back into US however you will get back....eventually."
6347974,Aspencreek,2019-08-07 15:05:00,2911,"have you looked under the console, that's where mine was!"
6348040,Baseline,2019-08-07 20:31:00,3207,You go with your story and I'll stick with mine.
6348258,PRO-V16,2019-08-08 15:25:00,454,Rockape is correct.
6348494,Bobber1,2019-08-09 09:56:00,10,"I concur with Aspencreek. A few yrs ago withdrew $3k in cash enclosed in a standard withdrawal envelope to be moved from my TD bank to a Wells Fargo a few blocks away. Placed it in the Denali console, somehow disappearing within the 5 minute travel from bank to bank. After being certain I had looked EVERYWHERE, devastated and confused, I reported my loss to police, somehow finding its way to the local paper's Lost & Found, all in hopes that a good samaritan would turn it in. A few weeks later while cleaning the interior, noticed a minuscule gap in the console. Flashlight in hand, a corner of the envelope became visible... a champagne worthy event!"
6347468,eyemike,2019-08-05 19:39:00,233,"Leaving for Canada Thursday. I put our passport cards in the center console of the truck last night. Today, I cannot find them! It's too late to get replacements. I am just sick! Can I still cross or am I going to have to chalk this off to my stupidity? 😭"
6347472,johnboat,2019-08-05 19:59:00,2014,"It's Monday. Look around, they'll show up. I came close to not getting my passport renewed in time this year. I called Fort Francis and told them my issue. They said to bring my drivers license AND my birth certificate and I would be good to get back in the US. Coming from Iowa, a passport is not needed to get in.I questioned this and called back and asked for a supervisor and it was confirmed by them. My passport did arrive in time so I didn't have to test it. Athough I felt confident by what they said.Call them or Baudette and see for yourself.Baudette 218-634-2803F.Francis 807-274-3655Mine was the passport book, not sure if it would be any different with the cardGood Luck!"
6347474,1/4 oz Jig,2019-08-05 20:04:00,90,2 years ago my dad realized his passport expired 2 days before our trip. You are able to get same day passports at department of state buildings. Here is a link for the locations and requirements. You pay an extra $60 but you will get the passport and still make your trip! Make sure you bring your reservation invoice for your camp if you decide to go this route. Looks like the twin cities location is your best bet. Good luck!https://travel.state.gov/content/tra...-agencies.html
6347476,bearfvr13,2019-08-05 20:05:00,174,"I went to Canada in June,. .. .while doing mach 3 on the lake, somehow my pouch flew out and I lost my passport and fishing license. I came back home and then headed back up in July for my 2nd trip,. .. .. .i handed them my drivers license and birth certificate and they didn't ask questions. No issue whatsoever getting back into Canada without my passport. Hope this calms you down!!!! Chuck"
6347510,Lmbkiller,2019-08-05 21:48:00,639,"Don't need a passport, passport card, etc to get into Canada. Don't need any of that to get back into US either. It certainly helps but not necessary. I've been saying that for years on here, most disagree and don't believe it. I've been in the truck and seen it happen 2 different times. People are gonna believe whatever they want and I decided that it's not worth trying to fix stupid anymore"
6347544,Obabikon,2019-08-06 06:04:00,2370,"From a legal stand point... you do not require a passport to get into Canada. A drivers license is adequate. Returning to the US, you are required to have one, however, they have to let US Citizens back into the country with or without a passport. Long story short... you will be fine, but the border guards might hassle you a little. Explain what you did, and they'll be understanding. Have a great trip!"
6347546,MrSimon,2019-08-06 06:05:00,922,"And there are just as many stories of people getting denied entrance because they don't have their passport. It all comes down to the particular agent on a particular day. They can deny you entrance to Canada for ANY reason they want, or they can choose to let you in. Having a valid passport, a clean record, and being polite goes a LONG way .... but there is never a guarantee. The opposite is true, not having a passport or having a stained record doesn't mean they won't let you in."
6347552,bigcreekdad,2019-08-06 06:27:00,74,"If you are driving I think you are ok. Three weeks ago my son and I went to the French River, crossing at Sault St. Marie. Just before we left, I noticed his passport had expired. He had a state ID (doesn't drive), and I took his birth certificate as well. I called US customs at the Sault and was told he would not have a problem coming back into the USA. Decided to chance it with Canada. Gave the Canadian border agent his expired passport, State ID, and birth certificate. Agent didn't hold us up at all....right on through. I understand that flying into Canada might be a different story. Good luck!"
6347566,Baseline,2019-08-06 07:09:00,3207,"You are not the only person who have misplaced or forget your passport. A passport is not required to enter Canada. It is required to re-enter the US. Last year (2018) I forgot my passport and didn't realize it until I got to the border at I-Falls. My drivers license was sufficient for an ID. The only question I got from the Border Patrol was did I have a passport to which I explained what had happened. They scanned my license and told me to have fun. When I returned to the US I told the guy at the Border I had forgot my passport. He took my license and asked be to park and go inside. They looked up my passport, handed my license back to me and told me to have a safe drive home."
6347716,eyemike,2019-08-06 16:18:00,233,Thanks everyone for your input. I'll cross my fingers and head north Thursday morning.
