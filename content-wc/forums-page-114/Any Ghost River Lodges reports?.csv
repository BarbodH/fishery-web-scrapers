Walleyes that usually were on rock points, islands were actually in the weeds in 8-12 feet of water. Used mostly jigs with minnows. Clamshell was the lake most went too for the walleyes but at that time (September) they could be going into the fall pattern. Don and Darrell will point you in the right direction as to where the fish are. Singapore and Badshot can be good. We did well on Linda's Lake, Don knows the story on that one. Water was low when we got there an by weeks end was up a foot and you could motor to Clamshell. Good luck."

Stick to the right when entering the lake, halfway down on the right side is a feeder stream. Fish in front of that in 8-10 feet on the weed edge. We had the best luck starting at the mouth and drifting north. Also on Clamshell,in the southwestern bay, there's a small island. We started at the reeeds and drifted toward shore and picked a ton up. Right in the middle of the island and shore. We fished Singapore the last day. Fish are stacked up on the right side of the falls when you're facing them. You can go right inside the rock and sit in a whirlpool. Can get some size in there, caught a few 22's and a few 24's. Also some big pike in there. Expect to lose a few jigs."
