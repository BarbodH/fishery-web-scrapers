6344626,andreindy,2019-07-27 11:06:00,308,"Hello all. Looking for someone who could be a resource for a 1st timer Autochart Live / Autochart Pro user. I have returned from our Ontario fly-in (report and learnings coming next week for everyone) and during our 6 days of fishing, we ran the AutoChart Live mapping on our Helix 7 MSI G3 and Helix 5 units almost the entire time. For my group, this mapping was fascinating and ultimately beneficial whenever we would return to specific locations. Since it was our 2nd time to this lake, the side imaging on the Helix 7 helped me identify rock piles, bottom transitions and humps. Hard not to get caught up in it. I purchased Autochart Pro when I bought the zero lines card. Got a great deal. I will read the manual of course, but am interested in the process of how to take the Autochart Live mapping data and exporting it to Autochart Pro so I can see my maps outside of my actual Helix unit. I am generally pretty tech savvy, but I think my confidence is being tested because I view that data on those little zero lines cards to be so meaningful that I worry about inadvertently screwing things up. I like how the lines and maps look on the Helix unit as I was Live mapping. Am I able to replicate that on Autochart Pro? Thank you all. My wife mistakenly believed there would be a Canada reprieve upon my return, so all of this work is being done covertly..."

I will preface my statements by saying I don't have Auto Chart Live. I started using Auto Chart on a gen 1 Helix in 2015 and bought Auto Chart Pro shortly after when I learned/realized what the Helix could do. So I'm not the resource for any Live specific stuff. But just know that it is easy to transfer the data from your Helix to your PC and make your maps. For me, I record my sonar data and it gets saved as .dat files. I save those dat file in folders by Lake and date. Then import into Auto Chart pro from those directories. And it is not a bad idea to make backups. You can also make maps from your track data (*.ht files) if you didn't save sonar data. Each data point in the track file has a depth. Besides making maps, the AC Pro is awesome for making 3D bottom maps, vegetation, bottom hardness, side imaging mosaics, and my personal favorite, SI Replay. It is also great for editing out bad data points, such as when you lose bottom. Here is my recommendations: 1 - Read the AutoChart Installation_Operations Guide pdf. 2 - Read the AutoChart User Manual pdf Here is an important thing to remember for doing your own AC mapping. You want to find a point of reference for depth for each trip, so you can keep your data in sync year over year. So next year when you go, if the water is higher or lower, when you import the data you will offset it by the difference from this year. Example - this year an area you know is flat is 8 feet deep. And next year that same area is 9. You would offset the import by 1 foot. And you also offset the depth on the Hbird by that 1 foot so the contours match the actual depth. I hope I am clear enough. I have a AC PRo cheat sheet I made. It is raw, but it gets the job done for me. If you PM me your email I can send it to you. Good luck."
6344654,andreindy,2019-07-27 12:19:00,308,"Thank you and I will send a PM. Yes, addicting. I do know that I did not ""record"" sonar. I simply used the Autochart Live functionality to save to my zero lines card which I understand creates data that can be exported to Autochart Pro. If I could simply replicate the maps that Autochart Live made on the Helix, I would be happy."
6344696,bigdaddyguns,2019-07-27 14:47:00,608,Two step process. Step one is to transfer the AutoChart Live files from the SDCard to your PC. Your ZLC is likely named ACNAM1 with a set of sub folders. One of the subfolders is ACDATA. This is the folder that has all the AC Live recorded data. COPY all the *.ACU files in that folder to a folder on you PC. Now the ACLive data files are now copied from the ZLC and available on the PC. You can remove the ZLC. Step two involves ACPro. The objective here is to import the .ACU files into ACPro and convert them into .ACD files. AutoChart uses .ACD files as data source info to create maps. I use a Chart Index file by lake to accumulate all my .ACD files associated with that body of water. Once the Chart Index file is loaded you then have all your source data imported and can create a new map. Hope this helps.

6344930,andreindy,2019-07-28 16:28:00,308,"BigDaddyGuns, here some examples of where I get to. First picture must be where I uploaded data. Second picture is what happens when I ""Map Here"" in the green box. Third picture is when I then select ""Create map"". I apologize. My intent is not to burden anyone on what is likely a complicated process. I will continue reading the manual. I think there might also be a Facebook Group for Autochart Pro folks too."
6345078,lawson2343,2019-07-29 06:26:00,459,"AndreIndy You are on the right track. After your third picture, you should see that your Lakemaster Update Icon is now active. If you click that, it will write the map to your ZLC. It will then ask you if you want to display the map from the ZLC. Once you have maps on your ZLC, you can also see them by: Go to Tools > Settings > Background Map  LakeMaster button set - Layer is set to Default. Change to AC or SI I would also like to point out one very important thing about the Auto Chart Pro mapping. You'll notice that contour lines are created outside of where your boat actually traveled. These are ""guestimates"" of the water depth and I wouldn't trust them. The only true depth you can be sure of is the depth that your transducer has actually passed over. There are two variables called ""Interpolation and Extrapolation"". These are explained in the User Manual. I set mine to the minimum values.  Go To Tools > Settings > General  Interpolation Limit: 25m (smallest value - default)  Extrapolation Limit: 5m (smallest value  least chance for errors) Good luck."
6345366,bigdaddyguns,2019-07-29 20:30:00,608,You have the basics down. Here are a few tips AC tips you may find useful that I find make the map more readable. Your first map is composed of colored contours like my image 1. You can change that by doing a right mouse click on the map and unchecking the CONTOURS item. That will generate a map with colors scaled to the depth like image2. If you want contours on top of the color hit the right mouse again and check BLACK CONTOURS that will generate an output like image 3. Another overlay I find useful is plotting the tracks of the recordings. You can turn this feature on by right mouse and checking ADD/DB TRACKS. This will overlay the GPS path in grey over the contour map.
