6279492,bigdaddyguns,2019-01-15 19:02:00,608,"Fished Kirkness for the first time last July and the jig bite was on. The walleye fishing we experienced was phenomenal. As BTF said the off shore reefs should be going very well by then and those we fished last July produced many walleye. One thing I observation fishing Kirkness was the amount of rock on the reefs was minimal. Did not run into a lot of snaggy conditions. If you are fishing with younger kids that should help them get more fishing time in with less hangups. Another perk with SLL is the limited number of boats on the lake. You can fish in solitude all week and never have to compete for fishing spots. It feels like you have the lake to yourself. A comment on pulling a boat to SLL, the first 20 miles from Red Lake to the gravel road section is paved and a bit of a rough ride too. There are logging areas along that section of road and the weight of the trucks has damaged the road in spots. No gravel flying but you will need to be careful with the unevenness and potholes that will be a challenge pulling a rig. Enjoy."
6279606,trapsht,2019-01-16 09:58:00,28,"Thanks for all the encouragement. I'm really excited to go and meet some of you guys. You do have me concerned about bringing my boat up with the road conditions. I upgraded boats this year, and really want to take it. I will look into installing guards to help with gravel being kicked up. I should be fine with boat control as I have my Terrova I-pilot linked to my main graph."
6279658,BornToFish,2019-01-16 12:27:00,1224,"Greetings,I have made the trip to and from Stormer Lake Lodge many times. The gravel road is definitely hard on equipment such as trucks, trailers and boats. Knowing this, I would be concerned if pulling a fiberglass boat or painted trailer, either with or without a rock guard. A rock guard will minimize the number of dings in a boat and trailer, but will not eliminate them.The gravel section of the road is graded about every two weeks. Vehicles are normally traveling on this gravel road at about 40-50 mph. As BigDaddy pointed out, some sections of the paved portion of the road are not a bargain either.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6281060,Hwy 101,2019-01-20 22:37:00,33,"Trapsht, If you take it easy and don't rush it on the gravel sections you should do OK. I know how hard it can be to leave a new rig at home. If you have kids with you it may be a little less stressful for you to have a rig that the whole family can be comfortable in. There were years when my son would dive and swim off the boat and i could still catch fish right below him. There are some nice sandy beaches with places to pull up and hang out in the shallows. Dave and Linda keep the hazards well marked with brightly painted buoys. If you steer clear of those your chances of dinging a prop are remote. I think the most important gear to bring is some marker buoys and good jigging rods for everyone on the boat. We will get your map loaded with some good starting points when we see you! Let me know if you have any questions. Dan"
6281306,Golden Eagle,2019-01-21 13:42:00,2642,"My first trip up Nungesser Road, I had 1 spare tire/wheel for my trailer. I should have had 2. Would have saved a round trip back to Red Lake."
6282320,Guest,2019-01-24 11:33:00,0,hi. good fishing but real pricey. no discount for bringing your own boat. been going to the Red Lake area for 45 years. lots of options.
6339874,BornToFish,2019-07-12 07:09:00,1224,"Greetings,I apologize for the late trip report. Our daughter and her family have been visiting from the Boston area this week. They arrived the day after our return home. My wife and I were at Stormer Lake Lodge the week of 29 June - 05 July 2019. As I look back on this week of fishing, I have to rate it as one of the most challenging weeks of fishing that I have encountered in over eighty weeks of fishing in NW Ontario. I believe there are four reasons as to why the fishing was challenging: a mayfly hatch, transition of walleyes from shorelines to off-shore structure, high winds and wildfires.We started our fishing on Saturday morning, 29 June. The water temperatures were consistently 68 - 70 degrees F. and remained stable throughout the week. The weather on Saturday was hot, clear sky and flat calm - hardly ideal weather conditions for walleye fishing.I bounced around the lake checking out spots, in order to establish effective patterns to leverage throughout the week. We were catching a few fish on shorelines, points and off-shore rock humps. I never located any outstanding spots. No single pattern emerged as it all seemed rather bland. That evening, I was seeing vast swarms of may flies in various places on the lake. I was seeing the hulls of thousands of may fly larvae on the surface of the water.A light rain developed Sunday morning as I was leaving the dock at 4:30 a.m.. The rain ended about the same time as I finished putting on my rain gear. I heard a distant rumble of thunder and that was it for the rain. I commented on other threads how six wildfires developed in the immediate area as a result of cloud to ground lightning strikes.Most of our fishing for the next several days involved anchoring the boat an easy cast away from weed edges. We looked for weeds on soft bottom with the hulls of may flies on the surface of the water. Schools of walleyes were cruising these weed edges. We casted our jigs + live bait to the edge of the weeds, or preferably into pockets on the weed edge. We tempted walleyes to strike by keeping the baits moving along fairly quickly - reaction strikes. The walleyes were stuffed with may fly larvae. We would be on a great school of fish for a while, and then it would move on to somewhere else. Then, we just waited for the next school of fish to pass by. We caught nice fish with this pattern, but it tried my patience with the waiting for the next school of fish.A brisk wind developed Sunday afternoon when the front moved through the area. This wind stayed strong until late in the day on Wednesday. We were dealing with 2-3 foot high white caps most all of these days with the high winds. We ended up fishing spots out of the wind by pure necessity. Thus, we weren't able to fish spots that we wanted to. We just had to ""make do"".I sensed that the walleyes were actively transitioning from shorelines to off-shore structure (e.g. rock and gravel humps) when we arrived. Some walleyes were still on shore lines. I think most of these fish were cruising the weed lines for mayfly larvae, as I described above. Some walleyes were on off-shore structure. However, I believe there were several days when most of the walleyes were somewhere between the shore lines and their destination on the off-shore structure. These are tough walleyes to locate and stay on top of, as they are on the move.The wind pretty much blew itself out on Wednesday afternoon. We moved out to some rock humps near shore and did VERY well. The humps that could be reached without having to cross deep water were showing great fish in terms of numbers and size. This pattern held through Thursday night. We even caught a few fish on Thursday afternoon that were on rock humps surrounded by deep water.I mentioned the wild fires that were in the area. They impacted the fishing in two ways. At times, they served as artificial and dense clouds. There were times that we couldn't see any shorelines as the haze/ash was that dense. The lack of penetrating sunlight due to haze and clouds brought walleyes higher up on the rock humps at times. The wildfires were also a major distraction in that we didn't know if we would be evacuated by float plane at any time.The mayfly hatch was pretty much over by Wednesday. The walleyes were clearly established on off-shore rock/gravel humps about this same time. Our best depth on the humps was 18-22 fow. We caught some walleyes as deep as 32 fow and as shallow as about 10 fow.Our best northern pike fishing was in areas with rocks + weeds. I had an interesting experience casting this pattern with a copper Doctor spoon with an orange swirl. I saw a nice pike roll over my spoon as we drifted a weed bed. I fired another cast to this same spot with nothing happening. I fired a second cast to this same spot and saw a nice pike roll over the spoon for a second time. This pike must have been near-sighted or maybe it saw the bigger fish coming in for a look and decided it was time to be elsewhere. I saw a huge mouth open up and inhale my Doctor spoon. I set the hook and managed about ten cranks on the reel handle. The mighty fish made a power dive under the boat motor and the hooks pulled out. And there she was: gone! I have a hunch, even though I never saw her, that she might have been my new personal best.Several pike in the 39 - 43 inch range were caught by other anglers in camp that were working the rock + weed pattern. We were catching northern pike in the thirty inch range later in the week while fishing walleyes on the rock humps.All in all, I assessed the fishing as being about two weeks behind a ""normal"" schedule. That is, our fishing during the first week of July seemed to be comparable to what I would have expected during the middle of June. July seems to be the ""great equalizer"" in terms of stabilizing weather, weed development and water temperatures. I expect that anglers during July and August will encounter traditional fishing patterns.We did not put up the incredible numbers of fish that we have in past years during the same week, but we still did very well - no complaints from us! I am confident that this past week of fishing made me a more complete angler. I will remember the lessons learned and have them with me in the event we encounter similar situations in the future.Our stay at the lodge was awesome in all respects. Dave and Linda hired a new cook named Debbie. Debbie and Dawn took the salad bar to an entirely new level. Debbie is an accomplished baker, such that she introduced new breads and desserts to the menu.My wife and I are anxiously awaiting our trip to Stormer Lake Lodge in August.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6339996,adempsey2.0,2019-07-12 10:54:00,611,"Reading your review and reduced success brought back something I wanted to investigate further. This is not the first time I have heard the negative impact of forest fires on fishing. It certainly could be the smoke haze blocking the light and warmth from the sun. However, I am curious to learn if the ash and water runoff impact the pH of the water near the shore or at the surface. Just made me think about that again. Sorry to derail....Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk"
6340382,BornToFish,2019-07-13 08:16:00,1224,"Greetings, Adam: I was pondering the same thought as in your post. We drove on Nungesser Road on our way home from the lodge. There was a twelve mile stretch of road that was burned on both sides of the road. There was no undergrowth. There were no needles or leaves on the trees. The standing trees were blackened and smoldering. There was ash everywhere. I understand heavy rains may have moved through the area earlier this week. I'm sure that the rain water dissolved inorganic and organic salts, and then trickled down hill to end up in a body of water somewhere. I too wondered what impact those salts might have on a body of water. It might be that the lakes have sufficient buffering capacity to tolerate the infusion of new salts. It will be interesting to observe what happens to the fishery in upcoming years, if anything. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6349370,Hoosier_25,2019-08-12 08:47:00,9,"Returned from a week at Stormer and am now back in the office. In short, the walleye fishing was the best I have ever experienced. The pike fishing was so-so. We caught can insane amount of 20+ inch walleye. There were a few spots (mostly reefs in the 20-25 FOW) where we could sit there and yank one after another. One morning, in three hours of fishing, we had over 100 walleye between the three of us in the boat and only FIVE that fit the lake's slot limit of under 18 inches. Big walleye for the week in our group was 28 inches but another guy at camp had a 30 incher. Walleyes primarily caught on jigs and minnows/crawlers but we got a few on rattle traps and grubs. Kirkness Lake is a lot of fun to fish. Numerous islands, reefs, flats, etc. Tons of opportunities and new spots to explore. We tried Stormer a bit but had no luck there (nor did anyone else in camp). Stormer is more of an early season fishery as it is essentially a big sand bowl. We did spend a couple hours each day tossing for pike. Landed a few in the 30-35 inch range but couldn't get any real gators. The same guy that caught the 30 incher managed to yank a 42 inch northern. What a week for him. We had OK weather. Sat, Sun, Mon were warm, calm days. Tuesday was a mixed bag. On Wed, a front moved in and temps were in the 50s and low 60s with high winds and some rain. Fishing did not seem to be impacted. Food was great. The shore lunches on Sun, Tues and Thurs were phenomenal--so nice to have everything prepared for you as you sit back with a cold one. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Cabins were comfortable. Boats were the best we have had on any Canadian trip. Highly recommend Stormer."
6276912,Hwy 101,2019-01-08 22:50:00,33,"I will be back at Stormer Lake the week of July 13th also. It is a pretty fun group in camp. The fish will be stacked up on the offshore reefs, but we did catch a bunch of nicer walleye in shallow weeds when the wind kicked up."
6276924,BornToFish,2019-01-09 05:17:00,1224,"Greetings,Steve: I read your post with mixed feelings. Shannon and I are very sorry to hear that your father passed away. We are delighted to hear that you and your wife are expecting a new baby this summer! Hopefully, you will be able to one day take your children with you to fish at Stormer Lake Lodge. I'm sure that will make your father smile.Kindest regards...."
6278986,trapsht,2019-01-14 13:01:00,28,I just booked a trip for this July with my family. I really hope the fishing is great because it is a long drive from Illinois
6279072,Golden Eagle,2019-01-14 17:22:00,2642,Come down and pick me up so I can help you drive.
6279104,BornToFish,2019-01-14 20:39:00,1224,"Greetings, Trapsht: What week in July? July is normally the time when things start to settle down in terms of weather. Fishing typically becomes less weather dependent as fish are moving to off-shore rock humps. Weeds are well-established. I think you will be pleased with the fishing. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6279158,trapsht,2019-01-15 07:05:00,28,"We will be there July 13-19. Sent in our deposit yesterday. Looks like they have great boats there, but I will be towing my boat up regardless. Hoping for a solid jig bite for my kids. Its hard for them to pull rigs. Sounds like a jig bite should be good if they are on offshore structure."
6279184,BornToFish,2019-01-15 07:40:00,1224,"Greetings,My wife and I will be at the Lodge two weeks before you and your family. The reef (jig) bite will be in full-force when you are there. There are MANY mid-lake rock humps in Kirkness Lake. Many of these rock humps are pretty easy to locate. Most of the best structure in the lake is not shown on the lake maps, even though there is plenty of structure on the maps.The known navigational hazards are marked with empty freon tanks. As such, navigation around the lake is pretty straightforward.I had a couple of thoughts come to mind regarding bringing your own boat. The first point is that you should be aware that the last twenty five or so miles of roadway to the lodge is gravel. You will want a rock guard at the rear of your truck to protect your boat from dings. The second thought is steering on your boat - is it from the tiller or on the console? I've found that boat control when vertical jigging is much better with a tiller, compared to console steering. Boat control is often what separates anglers that catch fish from anglers that don't catch as many fish.My wife and I have a Lund Pro-V that is pretty tricked out, with steering at the console. I leave it at home when fishing at the Lodge as I much prefer to fish from a Lodge boat due to tiller steering.Don't hesitate to send to me a private message if you have any questions. My wife and I have considerable experience on Stormer and Kirkness Lakes.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6279348,ManitowishWaters,2019-01-15 11:49:00,39,"I'll be there this year that same time Trapsht. Will be my 4th year and still never ceases to amaze me. First time in July, but pretty sure fish will still be snapping. Should be a great trip and cant wait to meet ya!Steve"
6279368,BornToFish,2019-01-15 13:30:00,1224,"Greetings, TrapSht: I will offer you a BIG hint - just follow Steve around the lake and do what he does!! My wife and I have fished the same week as Steve and his group for the last several years. We shared the same table at dinner, thus got to know one another fairly well. Steve definitely has things dialed in! Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6279384,BornToFish,2019-01-15 14:02:00,1224,"Greetings,TrapSht: I just noticed that Dan (Hwy 101) will also be at the Lodge the same week as you. You will find that Dan is very knowledgeable of the lakes and a good fisherman. You will do well for yourself when you get to know him.I use to fish at another lodge in NW Ontario. People there tended to be fairly tight-lipped as fishing on that lake was more challenging compared to Stormer and Kirkness Lakes. It seemed as though folks were secretive and competitive, not wanting to divulge their secret spots or techniques.You won't find it to be that way at Stormer Lake Lodge. Almost everyone is very willing to share information and help newcomers. It's just the way it is, as most everyone is catching all the fish they want to catch. It's nice to go to shore lunch or have dinner in the lodge, as people are in a great mood when they talk about their day's fishing.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6266824,Living the dream again,2018-12-07 05:52:00,1,Anybody have any reviews of stormer Lake Lodge? How was the fishing?Thanks
6266848,Walleye2242,2018-12-07 06:34:00,263,"I know some people have, I have not but i have heard the fishing is amazing and the cabins and hospitaility are top notch."
6266866,BornToFish,2018-12-07 07:08:00,1224,"Greetings, You might want to do a search on this forum for other threads about Stormer Lake Lodge and Stormer/Kirkness Lakes. There are trip reports from several different fishermen on these threads. My wife and I fished at Stormer Lake Lodge for several weeks each season since the lodge was re-opened by the current owners (Dave and Linda Becker) in 2015. Stormer Lake Lodge is the only fishing lodge on two lakes that are connected to each other by an easily navigable channel. My wife and I boated about two thousand walleyes last season. On a ""slow"" day, my wife and I typically put about forty to fifty walleyes in the boat. An ""average"" day might see us boating about one hundred walleyes. A ""good"" day might involve boating about two hundred walleyes. An exceptional day might see us boating close to three hundred walleyes. I rate Stormer and Kirkness Lakes as having a truly outstanding walleye fishery in terms of numbers and size. Looking at it from the perspective of size, my wife and I catch 18-21 inch walleyes every few minutes. We catch 22-24 inch walleyes every hour. We catch several 25-28 inch walleyes every day. We have not caught a 30+ inch walleye from Stormer and Kirkness Lakes - yet! My wife and I typically start fishing after breakfast (ca. 7:45 a.m.). We come off the water at dinner time (ca. 5:45 p.m.). I often fish solo during the evening. The best walleye bite is often in the early to mid-afternoon. The walleye fishing normally follows classic seasonal patterns. The walleye bite in the spring is along shorelines and points. As the season progresses, the walleyes move a bit deeper and find emerging weeds. The walleyes then move to off-shore rock humps. Unlike some other lakes that I have fished, an interesting thing about Stormer and Kirkness Lakes is that all walleyes are NOT doing the same thing at the same time during the summer. I can find walleyes in weeds, around points and on rock humps at the same time. This phenomenon spreads the boats out on the lakes. I rate Stormer and Kirkness Lakes as having a good northern pike fishery. Many guests do not spend much time fishing for northern pike since the walleye fishing is outstanding. Our group in July has a contest for the biggest walleye and northern pike. The winning northern pike the last three season was in the 41-43 inch range. Some pike remain near weeds and points through out the season. However, many of the larger pike move out to rock humps when the water warms in July. These fish typically stay near the rocks until September. We throw spoons and in-line spinner baits over the weeds to catch pike. We use our musky gear to throw crankbaits and jerkbaits over rock humps. Stormer and Kirkness Lakes have small mouth bass and perch. Some anglers target the smallies and do well. Even though my wife and I do not target smallies, we often manage to catch several nice smallies (ca. 16-18 inches) during the course of a week. I haven't seen anyone target perch on these lakes. Stormer and Kirkness Lakes do not have musky or lake trout in them. Stormer Lake is a small lake by Canada standards. The water in this lake is stained. I rate this lake as somewhat resembling a ""bowl"" with not too much structure, at least compared to Kirkness Lake. The deepest water in Stormer Lake is about 24 feet deep. Kirkness Lake is considerably larger than Stormer Lake. The water in Kirkness Lake is somewhat stained in parts of the lake, and fairly clear in the remainder of the lake. Kirkness Lake boasts incredible structure in terms of reefs and off-shore rock humps. The deepest water in Kirkness Lakes is around 55 fow. The forage base in both lakes is shiner and spot-tail minnows. Stormer and Kirkness Lakes are straightforward to navigate. Known navigational hazards are marked with buoys. New anglers at the Lodge tend to get up-to-speed fairly quickly. Dave Beker conducts an orientation session on the first day to discuss with anglers where and how to fish, based on the activity from the previous weeks. Almost all guests share information during the week as well, as it's normally not too hard to catch fish. The atmosphere during meal times tends to be jovial, as most guests are catching a lot of fish. Please send to me a private message if you would like to chat further. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6267000,Hwy 101,2018-12-07 12:33:00,33,The fishing is great. The lakes are easy to fish using pretty much what ever style you want. The fishing for us has stayed consistent through windy cold fronts and hot calm conditions. Last year we had 2 nights of 100+ fish after dinner jigging on the off shore reefs. And I'll be the first to admit I'm just an OK walleye fisherman at best. A slow day for us is about 50 walleyes and that has only happened once. We fish for pike and bass when we pass a good looking spot but don't really focus on them much. The camp is very pretty and well maintained with great food and service. The camp shore lunches are always a fun time wit a lot of laughs. Boats are 18 foot Lunds and G2's that are set up perfect for walleye fishing with a locator and bow mount trolling motor. Let me know if you would like more details.
6267398,jtwater58,2018-12-09 05:53:00,5,Went there last year for the first time and we are booked for the same week this year. Like Born to Fish said walleye fishing is great. The customer service from Linda Dawn Kenny & Dave are top shelf. Boats are all decked out with graphs nets and trolling motors. The homecooked meals are out of this world top off with 3 shore lunches. Can't wait for August 2019. Want more info send me a PM
