6340568,yooper911,2019-07-13 22:31:00,143,It's actually shorter and quicker to take M28 across the top of the UP. Construction is about the same. Plus you can stop at Da Yoopers Tourist Trap in Ishpeming!
6340584,btyreprich,2019-07-14 05:45:00,1067,Lived in the Chicago area for all 62 years of my life and my experience has been to avoid Chicago area if you want to get somewhere quickly & without any headaches. I's suggest taking I-80 west to I-35 north to Rockford. Then get on I-94 and go through Wisconsin towards Duluth. Fewer tolls this way and a LOT less traffic. Top off gas in Indiana - our Governor just placed a significant gas tax and this has driven up gas prices significantly.
6340612,vaquero01,2019-07-14 07:19:00,101,"I live in NW Indiana. My route north.I80 west to I39 north to I90 to I94 to Eau Claire, then 53 to Duluth. Stay out of Chicago. And gas up in Indiana.I would imagine the UP route takes you thru a lot of small towns, but the scenery would be nicer. Except you will miss central WI, which is pretty choice too."
6341240,Shackflyer,2019-07-16 05:51:00,2,"Take the UP route. I39 between Beloit and Madison and I 94 between the WI/IL state line and Madison are dicey. Gas prices in Illinois are outrageous, as are the tolls. Save yourself the aggravation and go north. Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
6341260,Nick Kanauz,2019-07-16 06:26:00,176,"Definitely take the UP route. We take it to Wisconsin and Canada every time. Grand Rapids north on 131 to 55 east, to 127, turns into 75 to over the Bridge. Connect to 2 west to 117 and go thru Engadine north to 28 (about 17 miles), head west on 28 all the way to Ironwood, reconnects with 2 in Wakefield, and turn west to Ironwood. Great place to eat is Breakwater in Ironwood, on your left as you go thru on 2/28. Then 2 goes all the way across the top of Wisconsin to Duluth. We just took that route to Mercer, WI in early May 10.5 hours. about 3/4 hour faster than going thru Chicago on the toll way, even with my IPASS. Save 20 bucks both ways, that's a 1/2 tank of gas in the F150. Tight Lines!"
6341546,Aspencreek,2019-07-16 20:31:00,2911,"Running Hwy 2 from St Ignace MI to Superior WI is one of the most scenic drives in the northland. That beats driving in Chicago, EVERYTIME......"
6349680,rutter,2019-08-13 09:12:00,19,"Made the trek up to Red Lake area from southern lower Michigan a couple of weeks back. First time I took the UP route instead of through Chicago. Verdict is that the UP is the way to go. Taking the M28 route through the UP there is very little difference if any in time vs. going through Chicago, and it's so much more relaxing and scenic."
6339506,rutter,2019-07-10 19:41:00,19,"Heading up to Canada next week from south central Michigan through International Falls. I'll be stopping over night in Duluth. In the past, I've always driven through Chicago. I wondered if anybody has tried the route through the UP. From what I've seen on MapQuest, it's only 20 to 50 minutes longer than going through Chicago depending on time of day."
6339516,lenray,2019-07-10 20:06:00,467,I take that route when I go to the village of Pickle Lake north of Ignace. Beautiful drive and not a lot of traffic.....len at clare
6339542,yooper911,2019-07-10 21:40:00,143,The ABC's of driving Always Bypass Chicago Plus you can't get pasties in Illinois
6339560,kzoofisher,2019-07-11 03:45:00,5144,"Go north, speed limit is 75 and traffic lighter. Unless you planning on passing through Chicago after midnight add at least an hour for traffic. I went to O'Hare a couple weeks ago and got held up at 9pm."
6339570,x4flatfish,2019-07-11 05:20:00,319,And you wouldn't want to by gas in this god forsaken state...
6339592,Paul H,2019-07-11 06:52:00,1232,"I've driven the UP route a couple of times. From Ohio and was just visiting in Duluth. I was not in a HUGE rush nor towing. I've done the North and the South route. If you need a place to stay I can recommend a spot in Superior. It's pretty safe and actually, the lot is adjacent to a large marina and it's lights and security. Barker's Stayed there for most of a week.https://www.barkersislandinn.com/"
6339666,7 Mag,2019-07-11 10:08:00,1887,"If you decide to go towards Chicago this is the route I take. I-80, I-355, I-88, I-39, I-94, 53. This route is longer and there are tolls but you avoid a lot of Chicago traffic. I can make it to Duluth in approx. 9 hours from North Central Indiana pulling my boat."
6339716,Bstar,2019-07-11 14:26:00,564,"If you do the Chicago route I would take I80 west to I355 north to I90 west. That's the route we take from northwest Indiana. I think 88 to 39 to 90 is a longer route but to each his own. Timing is everything when going through the Chicago area. We get on I80 at around 4:45 after picking up our last guy in Frankfort,IL and we don't have any problems with that route. Now if there's an accident on the road then all bets are off. If we didn't have to go to Frankfort we would probably take I294 all the way north to I90 just past Ohare now that the I90 construction is finished."
6339764,Duflebag,2019-07-11 18:09:00,218,I give a good recommendation for Barkers also if staying in Superior or Duluth area.
6340408,Sportdog,2019-07-13 09:37:00,6735,"My advice is to go US127, I-75, US2, and enjoy the trip as opposed to fighting Chicago traffic. I can't imagine the nightmare of a possible breakdown in the huge metropolitan Chicago area. Plus you spend gas money/snacks in your home state. Yes, I've done it both ways. Note: I just returned and avoid US131 from Wayland to Grand Rapids if you consider that route. Construction had traffic at 0-10mph southbound. This was last night at about 10PM."
