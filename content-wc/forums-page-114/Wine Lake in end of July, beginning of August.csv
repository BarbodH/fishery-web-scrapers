(Ain't modern medicine amazing!). We are not used to a midsummer excursion so it was all new to us. Nick took us out on Tuesday and showed us where an how to fish. He showed us one of his secret humps in the middle of the lake and saved the week. We caught 120 fish in the five days and of those there was one perch, 5 smallies, 3 snake pike and the rest were walleye. Plenty of eaters and plenty in the mid-20s. I guess 12 fish/person/day is pretty good fishing but we have come to expect better as we are spoiled by spring. It was still great, though and it is a beautiful place. A little different vibe in the midsummer with families and parties being the focus. We were able to escape the noise and enjoy five beautiful days. Thanks a bunch, NIck!Fish ON!Hooks"

Now that would not be fun. Was the hump you fished rock or gravel or??? How did your fish it - with jigs, bobbers, trolling? I'm gong up next week and have never fished the destination lake in August. I have fished it in September - cold, wet, and spotty fishing. When it was bad, it was bad. When it was good it was phenomenal. But I don't know much about August. Any help would be appreciated."
6348022,HeHooksHimself,2019-08-07 18:35:00,725,"You described how I got my handle. Small pike on a crankbait, I grabbed it, it wiggled and hooked the ring finger and the middle finger together. Healed by the end of the week but the name stuck with my group. The hump was rocks in the middle of 60 ft. water, about 100 yds. long and 20 yards wide. First time I ever used buoys, but it was necessary. Jigs with flash, drop it to the bottom and then pull up about a foot to avoid snags. Worked very well. We are going back up to Discovery Lake in September. First time there. Good luck on your trip! Hooks"
6348030,law57,2019-08-07 19:11:00,1147,"When using treble hooks, I usually let the fish lay in the bottom of the boat and use my pliers to remove the hooks. I don't want to 'staple' my fingers together. Thanks for the info. I fished a similar hump in June. It (hump) is surrounded by 30 feet of water and comes up to about 6 feet. It is made of very large boulders. The only way to fish the top would be with slip bobber (very good in the evening) or cranks - Shadow Raps work good. Again, in the evening. During the day I back troll jig/minnow. The hump is about 400x100 feet. I put way points at the 20 foot level - all the way around. If I get inside of 20 feet I will likely snag. But I usually find fish on the edge of the hump. I use smaller jigs than most guys. I see them try to fish the hump and give up after too many snags. Lighter jigs seem to reduce snags. But it's still a game of 2 feet forward and one foot back. If you're going to back troll jigs, get used to going back to retrieve snags. The rock pile must have been laid down by a glacier. It's just a big pile of rocks. The material surrounding it is firm and will not snag you. If I find fish there next week I intend to work on my snap jigging technique. It's always good (and fun) to try different techniques when you know the fish are present and feeding."
