6347320,Mojo-NC,2019-08-05 11:25:00,1929,"We go to a lodge with similar restrictions, but our check-in time on Saturday is 9:00 AM. I don't have a problem with it at all. We fly up to INL and stay Friday night in Dryden and drive to the lodge the following morning adjusting our departure time so we will arrive right about 9:00 AM. By the time we check-in, unload, and get our gear ready, it's usually around noon to 1:00 PM. That gives us enough fishing time on Saturday afternoon to catch enough nice keepers for dinner that evening. We are supposed to be out by 9:00 AM the following Friday, but we're generally gone way before that in order to drive to International Falls to catch our flights back home."
6347342,Obabikon,2019-08-05 12:29:00,2370,"Boat rentals are pretty important. I'm not saying it's ok, but I certainly understand what they did. If a resort owner has purchased/leased a fleet, they have to rent them, or they are wasting money. If they already have most of their regulars bringing their own boats... they need to find some groups that can pay for the costs of their boats that week. There's a lease to own program that you can purchase new motors/boats from. If the resort has 4 of them, and are paying $2000 per month for nice boats... they absolutely have to rent them almost every single week. They can't afford for them to sit there and make no money. It is just like turning away house keeping guests when you have a chef on staff. You're usually paying them the same if he cooks for 8 or 40. Financially, you have to take what is most beneficial."
6347360,MrSimon,2019-08-05 13:41:00,922,"I get that. It just feels crappy as a guest to get turned away because I don't meet their idea of who should be renting that particular cabin for that particular week. Now, if they would have listed these policies on their website, I wouldn't be complaining. I could have just read the policy, shook my head, and moved on."
6345794,Habitual Eyer,2019-07-31 06:01:00,144,"Camps that make you leave on Friday automatically get kicked out of contention in our eyes. Takes much to get boat/gear/food ready. Long drive from Indiana. Week is already short enough and don't like pulling out day early. So, Saturday to Friday camps that charge same as Saturday to Saturday camps don't get a sniff from our groups."
6345806,Obabikon,2019-07-31 06:16:00,2370,"From a business model... they shouldn't call it a ""week trip"". They should simply call it a 6 day trip. Calling it what it isn't is clearly a good way to get potential guests upset. The reality is, they are probably small staffed operation, and need that entire day to empty/clean/turn over their resort."
6345808,eyecatcher1,2019-07-31 06:20:00,323,"I've usually found most resorts to be Saturday to Saturday. Red Pine Lodge where I go now is like that, but in the rare case that they're not booked I'm pretty sure they would do a longer or shorter stay. www.fishredpine.com"
6345822,MrSimon,2019-07-31 06:45:00,922,"What bothers me is that it's not even 6 days, it's 5 days plus an evening. Once we check in on Saturday at 3, register, unpack, launch the boat etc there are only a few more hours to fish before dark. And then on Friday morning we wouldn't have time to fish AND pack everything up to be out by noon. If they are small and need time to clean, I think they should let people check-out of the cabin in the afternoon. That gives people time to get a full half day of fishing in, and the camp still has 24 hours to clean. EDIT: I didn't realize it, but this particular camp does offer the option to purchase a seventh night, making it Saturday to Saturday. That's a great option, but it does kind of make their posted prices not apples to apples with other camps. Oh well. I still like the camp and think it's a fair price for a great trip ... and ultimately that's what matters."
6345888,Shellback,2019-07-31 09:30:00,8083,"If it's the camp I think it is, it was a pretty stiff price for the extra day. They fill right up, so I guess the schedule doesn't bother many folks. I'd like to see a camp say arrive when you like to fish, but park your gear and vehicle in a holding area till check in time. Same on your last day, clear out of the cabin but stay and fish if you choose. Of course, then the camp owners would have some folks asking, "" can we put our cold stuff in your fridge now, etc, etc"" So I kinda get where the camp has to have steadfast rules."
6345902,Aspencreek,2019-07-31 10:01:00,2911,"That is exactly what we do. We let the camp owner know that we will be there at around noon, we unload the fishing stuff and head out while everything else is still packed in the coolers, NOTHING goes into the cabins until we return at 5-6pm. Another few hours in the coolers is no big deal. They appreciate that we understand their need to get the camp turned over, and we get in a good 1/2 day. Since we cook all of our own meals, the first night in camp is an easy one, Steaks on the grill!!!"
6345928,bigwalleye1,2019-07-31 10:43:00,2632,"Perhaps you could consider camps that don't book for a weekly stretch. The camp I go to allows me to book as few or as many days as I want, provided there is a cabin available, and I pay by the night for the time reserved.. I arrive on a Wed and depart the following Tuesday, but some folks stay longer or shorter times. My point is that there are camps that provide accommodations for folks that want/need something other than a one week stay."
6346270,rockape,2019-08-01 10:30:00,215,I forgot that I did a Wed-Wed last year because of the schedule of one of my friends. You are so right on no traffic and no line at the border!!!
6346286,Ricky Spanish,2019-08-01 11:35:00,1298,"If you drive up to Temple Bay, you can arrive and leave any day you choose. There is a daily per person charge."
6347196,MrSimon,2019-08-05 06:57:00,922,"I need to vent a little bit about this same camp. I was thrilled to find out the cabin I wanted opened up for the week I wanted for next year. This place has massive repeat business so I felt very lucky! However, when I called to book they wouldn't rent me the cabin. They only want to rent it to people who are NOT bringing their own boat. Since I only wanted to rent one of their boats and not two, they turned me away. Apparently their renters in early season rent a lot of boats, but summer guests mostly bring their own boats. They want to spread that out so it's less work for them and they can thin out their rental fleet. I get it, they have their own best interests in mind, so they turned me away and will wait for a renter that meets THEIR criteria. That's the first time EVER that an outfitter turned me and my money away. It showed me they are less interested in pleasing the guests and more interested in pleasing themselves. I hung up with them and immediately called White River Air .... talk about a breath of fresh air!!"
6345544,MrSimon,2019-07-30 10:58:00,922,"I'm looking at a drive-in lodge that offers weekly packages where you arrive after 3PM on Saturday and check out by noon the following Friday. That's only 5 full days of fishing. I suppose you get a few hours in the evening when you arrive, and possibly a few hours the morning you leave - but probably not if you have to pack and roll out by noon. I feel like I'd be getting jipped out of a full day's fishing. What do you guys normally see?"
6345552,x4flatfish,2019-07-30 11:13:00,319,"Sat to Sat. Arrive around noon, fish till dinner time. Fish through Friday, leave early Saturday. Always done this. Some camps will accommodate you if they have the openings, but typically 7 nights Sat thru Friday."
6345556,rockape,2019-07-30 11:20:00,215,This is exactly what we do. Drive from I-Falls to Sioux Lookout on Saturday morning. Fishing by 2pm on Saturday. Leave the next Saturday morning around 5am. We have left on Friday afternoon twice because of big storms and waves that make the fishing very difficult.
6345612,Aspencreek,2019-07-30 14:11:00,2911,"The camp I will usually go to is a FRI to FRI. Yes that's right friday to friday. I drive up to FF on thurs night and in camp around 1pm (they know I will be a little early)get in a half day on friday. While all the sat guys are driving I got the lake to myself, plus NO line at the border either way. The advantages are simple, little to no traffic driving up on thurs or going home on Friday, no lines at the border, can get a room in FF easy, and when I get home on Friday night, I have the weekend to recover from all the strain I put on the arms wrestling fish the prior week."
6345654,Pooch,2019-07-30 16:56:00,4618,"Seven day trips are actually six and a half day trips. Always been like that since we started fishing Canada thirty years ago. Camp needs a half day to clean cabins and boats for the next groups arrival. Most camps are not happy when a group arrives early, but probably don't say anything.We try hard to not arrive early. If we do then we kill time out of their way until they are ready for us. One camp we fish, if we do arrive early, we put the boats in and go fishing. Then later in the afternoon move into the cabin. Courtesy works both ways.Pooch"
6345656,emma17,2019-07-30 16:59:00,436,"I guess it depends what time of year you go. Up until this year, all our prior trips were short week trips. We've arrived mid Saturday and mid Sunday, and we've left early Thursday, early Friday and early Saturday. In all of those cases, the camp owners worked with us to match the fishing and/or sleeping and eating (American Plan) to the total price. Those trips were late July and into early September."
6345676,mixedbag,2019-07-30 17:37:00,76,"Look for one that charges daily rates like Goose Bay Lodge, Lac Suelhttps://www.lacseul.com/"
6345708,pikeandtina,2019-07-30 18:58:00,145,"Mr. Simon, Just my two pennies, but less than 7 days is just unsatisfactory compared to my drive-time from southern Ohio. We did 10 days last summer, and it seemed optimal! P&T"
6345726,eyecatcher1,2019-07-30 19:51:00,323,I think that where I go will do that. www.fishredpine.com
6345738,Obabikon,2019-07-30 20:16:00,2370,"Part of the beauty of so many cool places, is there is literally a trip for everyone. If Saturday - Friday doesn't fit what you're looking for, you will have no problem finding a Saturday - Saturday."
