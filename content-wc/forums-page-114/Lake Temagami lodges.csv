6346152,LostMarble,2019-08-01 03:32:00,4,I use to fish Temagamie every May long weekend 15-20 years. Haven’t been there since the slot changed those many years ago. Unfortunately I don’t know much about fishing patterns past May 2-4 weekend.A guy I use to work with bought a camp. I’ve been following them on Instagram and they seem to have been revamping the place and things look pretty decent for a fishin camp.http://www.lakeherridgelodge.com/He was a great guys to work with and was an extremely serious fisherperson so I don’t doubt he’s found the spots.Another option (which I did as a kid as well) was the three bouys houseboats. It was a blast but seems to be booked up.Sorry it isn’t much help but I hope it’s a bit. Enjoy!
