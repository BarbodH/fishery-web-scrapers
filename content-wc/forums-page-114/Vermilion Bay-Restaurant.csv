6345936,BlueJayBert,2019-07-31 11:41:00,15,Stopped at the bakery a couple of years ago and they had some great breads...but can't understand why they aren't open on Saturday when there is a lot of traffic leaving and arriving.
6346036,Bill Krejca,2019-07-31 16:33:00,6107,"They were open several years ago early morning on Saturday,and we stopped and got something or other, don't remember what it was. At the time, they didn't have a very large selection. Bill"
6345316,Jeler,2019-07-29 16:59:00,92,"Read a few older post here on the subject, but am wondering if there still is any place to eat dinner and/or breakfast in town.Will be heading up that way at the end of August.ThanksJeff in Iowa"
6345320,v-bay gord,2019-07-29 17:15:00,3168,Lunch / dinner at Buster's BBQ in the fort or at the food truck at Bobby's Corner......I think both open around 11:00. Quakers Diner is sometimes open and does breakfast but their hours seem variable. The bakery has good coffee and does some lunch items but isn't open on the weekend.

6345452,Bill Krejca,2019-07-30 06:33:00,6107,"Morning breakfast at the end of September is hard to come by, in the past we have been settling for pre-made sandwiches or junk food convenience store style. I guess trying to keep a steady business cafe open all year is just mighty tough in that area. Bill"
6345492,mms3rd,2019-07-30 08:48:00,148,"Is Buster's full-service again. I'd drive to VB just to eat there....well, fishing would need to be involved as I think about it."
