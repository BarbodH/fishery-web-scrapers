6346960,Jim Clark,2019-08-04 03:53:00,9,Leaving for Snelgrove Lake Tomorrow morning. This will be my first fishing trip into Canada and I was wondering if it is customary to tip the pilot? If yes how much?
6346968,mixedbag,2019-08-04 05:16:00,76,It is customary. Most tip on the way out. $20 per passenger would be common.Have a great trip.

Some friends, my wife and I took a one day fly-in trip about ten years ago. The trip was scheduled from 8:00 a.m. - roughly 4:00 p.m.. I mentioned to the pilot that we would make it worth his while to come later than 4:00 p.m. for our pickup. His reply was to be ready and waiting at the dock at 4:00 p.m.. I also asked the same pilot to stay long enough to make sure that the boat motors started. His reply was to pull the choke, pull the cord twice, push the choke in and pull the cord to start the motor. As you might expect, one of the motors refused to start. We messed around with the motor for quite a long time and couldn't get it to start. We towed the boat out to a known fishing spot. We made up an anchor out of a rock, scraps of anchor line and fish stringers so that the boat would remain in place. Needless to say, the pilot did not receive a tip that day. On other fly-in trips, each member of the group contributed funds such that our group tipped the pilot $100 for the flight out as they did a great job in terms of making our trip more enjoyable. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
