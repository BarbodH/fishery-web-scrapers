6348852,IaDave14,2019-08-10 16:19:00,99,We are heading north on Fri 8/23 and unfortunately we can't leave any earlier from Cedar Rapids than 7:00 am. It will put us in Mpls/St Paul around 11:00 am or so. I'm sure there is construction north of St. Paul on 35 and I am wondering where it is and are they down to single lane. Got stuck last year in the lane closure at Pine City to Hinckley and it was ugly. Hopefully any construction is not that bad and if so is there a way to get around it?For those that traveled from Eastern Iowa do you take 218(Ave of the Saints) to I35 or go up thru Rochester and hit hiway 52? I have done both with same results but all depends on construction. Thanks in advance for any help.
6348916,Fred_G,2019-08-10 21:04:00,908,"Dave, I've been up twice this year and each time was different. In early July we spent about 1/2 hour getting through traffic where the lanes dust down to two. In late July we sailed right through. Really depends on the traffic at the time I guess. I always take 218/27 up to 35. Maybe it's habit but I think I make the best time this way. Hope you have a great trip! Fred"
6348934,TRapperJones,2019-08-10 22:51:00,36,I also am headed up on the 23rd...headed to lac seul. I go up 35 all the way to Minneapolis then cut out nw to st cloud up to baudette...smaller border and much more to see
6349060,IaDave14,2019-08-11 10:03:00,99,Just got a call from a buddy who left early this morning and said north of St. Paul about 15-20 miles it is single lane for he thought 10 miles or so. He wasn't sure of the exit where it started. Does anybody know where it starts hoping to by-pass it since we will be heading thru around noon on a Friday.

6349074,Jimmy Mac,2019-08-11 11:09:00,96,"I've driven that route several times over the summer. North of the cities, there are a couple construction projects on 35 that are underway. I think the area you're referring to is the overlay that is going on roughly between Harris, MN (Mile Marker # 152) and just south of the Grantsburg, WI exit. In this area, both southbound and northbound traffic go from two lanes to one lane. I think it's about a 12 mile project. Anyway, if you're in the cities at noon on Friday, you should be to the construction project I'm referring to at about 1:00 PM give or take. I would not change my route and would stay on 35. I've been through there at that time and only experienced a very slight delay. I think the busy time through there would be between 3:00 and 8:00 PM. I hope this helps. Good luck! Jimmy Mac"
6349078,IaDave14,2019-08-11 11:19:00,99,Thanks just what I wanted to hear. My fishing partner doesn't have any patience but since I'm driving he has no choice.
6349428,mms3rd,2019-08-12 12:05:00,148,When you get into the Cities you can go west and through Minneapolis or east and through St. Paul. I've timed the routes and they are pretty close. The Minneapolis and St. Paul roads meet and might be north of construction....the earlier post has more specifics than I have.
6349626,Jimmy Mac,2019-08-13 07:38:00,96,"Just and update.. Yesterday, I drove through the construction area I referred to in my earlier post. Anyway, the overlay is completed on the southbound lanes and traffic was open in both directions. The only evidence of highway construction in that area was was a survey crew just north of mile marker # 153. They still need to due the overlay for the northbound lanes and I don't know what the if they even plan on doing it this year. For now, it's smooth sailing in that area. For what it's worth, there is a lot of construction going on on 35. There were multiple areas where the freeway dropped to one lane. Aside from the 35e/35w interchange on the north end of cities, they tore the bridge out at Pine City (mile marker # 169) and traffic was down to one lane. At the time I went through, I was not delayed at all. I am probably giving you too much info and don't want to freak you out. Bottom line is at the time you are driving through, you should not have any problems in any of the construction areas. I would not delay though. I'm going up again later this week. If there is any changes worth noting, I'll create another post. Kind regards, Jimmy Mac"
6349660,IaDave14,2019-08-13 08:20:00,99,Thanks- We decided to take 218/27 to 35 to 35E thru St Paul. If there are delays no worries I will tell my fishing partner to take a nap. We are staying in I Falls that night so no hurry.
