6347612,Limeyangler,2019-08-06 09:17:00,563,"Thanks! I will keep posting, I have been making and posting videos on this forum and others for a decade, I enjoy making the videos. It is true that some work has resulted from them, but I don't think I have even mentioned more than a couple of times the ""service"" that someone mentioned above. In fact there are around 10 videos sitting on my channel that I have made in the last 2 months that are not posted here precisely because they make reference to my 'service' and I don't post here to promote that. I do make about $100 a month from Youtube but if you divide that sum by the hours I put in making them I might be making C$2.50 per hour, lol.Quote: Originally Posted by TRapperJonesThank you for posting videos...i am taking my 2 sons ages 12 & 15 on our second annual father/son trip fishing.

I walleye fish here in central Iowa but we dont have near the population canadian lakes have. Keep posting and we will keep watching. Know of a guide named dennis up that way? Dont know the last name...we are getting a guide for the 25th. Not sure I know him. Love hearing about the young ones getting involved, memories they will treasure forever, GOOD JOB DAD! More videos on the way as always, thanks for your kind feedback!Quote: Originally Posted by PoochDitto on the videos being appreciated.

I here ya Pooch, and I always appreciate your comments over the years. I too am a natural cynic, but it ticked me off to be accused of something that I am very conscious of not doing, like I mentioned above, the only thing I would have to admit to is promoting my videos and Youtube channel by evil devious means because I post on this forum and others....my bad!Quote: Originally Posted by Bill KrejcaYeah!!

This time of year though I do well at 22' to 17' almost anywhere on the reef but especially where you get any pronounced drop off to those depths, or at some points during the day right on top of the reef that tops out at 8' FOW."
6347900,TRapperJones,2019-08-07 11:05:00,36,"so...limey....do you fish the nw section of lac seul very much? I ask cause last time i was at lac seul was first week of september. we fished that section to about an hour boat ride southeast from evergreen lodge by ear falls (where we are staying starting the 24th of this month). I remember a rock we fished at one day called Ghost Rock. We were with a guide and caught about 140 walleyes that day between the 3 of us in 8-9 foot of water when clouds were out and 12-15 foot of water when the sun was out. I am sure the guide we get as well as the camp staff will be able to direct us to fishing areas but any that you can think of just general areas in that part of the lake that will get my boys on to pike and possibly musky...i am personally set up to fish musky complete with rods/reels, and tackle. i have about every walleye jig made lol as well as cranks, etc. Appreciate the input you give on here. and completely understand if you want to pm me the information"
6346610,wooglin,2019-08-02 11:02:00,371,"Nice work, love it! I'll be at Chamberlain Narrows in 1 week. QQ: How much do your rely on your Helix to find fish, or are you checking seasonal spots? IE, humps, weed edges, shallows...etc."
6346790,Limeyangler,2019-08-03 05:22:00,563,"I am fishing seasonal spots, i.e. humps, but the fish can be anywhere on the structure and I absolutely use the Helix to mark fish and then use spot lock to jig when I mark them, works good. I will also drop the jig behind the boat in the transducer cone and watch the fish come to my jig, see how they are reacting to what i'm offering and adapt my bait/presentation accordingly."
6346792,That Minnesota guy,2019-08-03 05:36:00,8293,Congrats on the video I guess. I must be the only one who doesn't see the point or maybe I missed it. I will admit after the first 2 minutes of pulling fish in I just scanned the rest. It seems to be all the same thing? Am I missing something or was it just a video for your guide service?
6346950,Limeyangler,2019-08-03 22:03:00,563,"Yup, you are missing the fact that I have only been guiding since last year and have been posting videos on this forum since 2011, 4 years before you joined."
6347222,wooglin,2019-08-05 07:34:00,371,"KEEP posting the videos, I love it - your commentary is great and the quality of the video is too. PS, I liked the eagle/muskie present on your lawn too!"

6346234,eyecatcher1,2019-08-01 09:34:00,323,I've never been to that part. Are there some good resorts in the area?
6346386,The tank,2019-08-01 18:33:00,340,Love the videos Limey! Where would a person stay to get you to guide them for a couple days. Sounds like an awesome time.
