The first trip towing I just put in drive and did not look back. This thing towed the boat like it was not even behind the truck The question is, how many guys with this same set up tow in overdrive? The tranny temp was normal and going up hills the truck never slowed down and the mileage was good."
531478,Guest,2003-05-24 14:20:00,0,"I have a 2001 with the same engine. My boat is a little bit lighter but not much. I always leave it in overdrive unless I am doing under 70 kms/h. No problems. It is my work truck & I haul a 3 ton asphalt roller all the time. When I am in town I turn off the overdrive, but on the open road its full steam ahead. Excellent choice in trucks I might add!!"

It just turn over 100,000 repair free miles this spring. Thinking about a new one but this one is just getting broken in."

I pull my 28' fifth wheel with my 1800 ProV IFS behind that in overdrive at 75 mph with my 02 Powerstroke, and very rarely does it shift out of OD. My tranny temp never moves at all. I believe in 02 they put a tranny cooler on them. These things are made for pulling. I don't think you understand what that thing is capable of. Believe me, your truck doesnt even know your boat is back there. Great choice in trucks, now get out and use it!!"
