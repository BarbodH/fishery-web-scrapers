The walleyes have been pretty good being caught in both 6-8 ft. and 20-22 ft. Go figure! Northerns have been pretty good also with some nice ones caught between 35 and 46 in. Some of the camp's bookings are soft this year...so late planners should have no problem finding a place to stay. It was cool last week, but yesterday and the rest of the week will be in the mid 70's. Spring is beautiful up here and no bugs."

Pike hit the green spinner bait, rattle trap and silver spoon with trailer. Water level still low. Whitefish bay and Red Cliff were hot."
