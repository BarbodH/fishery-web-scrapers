We usually get a lot of pike and a few walleyes but would like to turn that around this year. Any suggestions? We usually fish Dog Lake (near Wawa/Missanabie) and a few of the small lakes in the area. Any basic advice would be appreciated. Also, I can't remember the new slot sizes for Ontario. What are they?Thanks guys, Trout."
