531360,Guest,2003-05-21 09:09:00,0,How is the water level on LOTW? one more week for me.
531361,LyleK,2003-05-21 09:55:00,248,Water is low........ very low. Estimates are that it is down 3 - 4 feet.
531362,PRD1,2003-05-21 11:38:00,458,The LOTW Water levels show as between about 1 and two feet low from their norms at this time of the year per the LOTW Water Control Boards web site.http://www.lwcb.ca/pdf/LakeoftheWood...2003.05.21.pdf
531363,Guest,2003-05-21 20:35:00,0,"The Control Board has no idea what is going on. How can it it is not located near LOTW.The water is down a good three feet. I know a person in Shoal Lake who had a 74ft long dock. It is now high and dry. So you figure it out.One thing for sure, take your time running around this summer. What was under last yr. is certainly closer to the surface.Check with some of the lodges, or even the following site.http://www.kenoraontario.netE-mail the above for up to the minute information. The water is going up, but slowly, and I expect it might, that is MIGHT get back to normal. I truly doubt that unless we get some rain, and lots of it.As far as I am concerned the LOTW Water Control Board had better look closer into what they are doing. Last yr. the water went way up. They opened the dam in Kenora, but forgot to close the ruddy thing. We had no or very little run off. What can you except from a bunch of bureaucrats anyway. Big pay, nothing in return.Ron"
531364,Guest,2003-05-21 22:10:00,0,"You hit it on the head Ron. I was up there last year during the 12-14 inches of rain and the lake went up 3-4 feet while we were there. The resort owner said it would go up another 3 feet with the runoff.Now the lake is down.It was down when we got there last year and got back to normal and they opened the dam.It just don't make no sense.Will be up there in 2 weeks ,and I hope the water is up some. Take care, Mike"
531365,Guest,2003-05-22 02:55:00,0,"Do have fun Mike. You might want to look into one of thesehttp://www.propsplus.caComposite propeller. I know several marinas, and resorts that are now using them exclusively. You can hit something, and it will not loose it's pitch like an aluminum. Change one blade in most cases and you are back in action.Something to think about.As for the water, well I know a resort that built a new deck while the water was low last year. It was flooded over, Stores in Town were flooded out, and had to raise up several feet. Now you almost need a step ladder to get onto the docks. In most cases that I saw a week ago, you cannot reach half the docks around Lake of the Woods.Park 20ft off and walk across what once was bottom, and now is land.hehe..Funnier than #####.The water will go up. How much I do not know. I believe they finally closed the dam dam..After some nasty e-mails.The water level for LOTW should be controled by someone locally, not by someone down in Toronto or where ever they are. What the heck, 1200 miles away and ""they know"" what is happening here. Most do not even know where KENORA is for geesh sakes.RT"
531366,Guest,2003-05-22 07:19:00,0,You hit it right on.Whoever controls the water level is getting paid way too much for his or her job.We stay at the angle and do some of our fishing in the Canadian waters and have to call in every morning we fish and that call goes to Thunder Bay.Some of the people you talk to are very nice and some are down right rude.But I guess thats the price you pay to fish their waters.Will be up there the 8th of June.Have you fished the lake lately? I heard they were on the bite.If it is like last year it was a little tough for the first couple days with the rain but we managed to catch our fish.We will take it easier this year with the low water.I don't want to tear out hte lower unit of my motor.Let me know if you heard anything on the bite and I'll let you know how we did. Mike
531368,rpieske,2003-05-22 07:32:00,1276,"I'm looking out my window right now (Sabaskong) and the water is definitely down about three feet from normal. I have been coming here since 1953 and only saw the water lower one time, 1981 I think.Haven't been walleye fishing yet, but caught some nice northern up to 15 lbs. Been cool this week with some rain. Looks like it will rain today. Might try some walleye."
531367,Guest,2003-05-23 07:18:00,0,"Yes the lake is low but, the Control board has a very difficult job to regulate the water to please everyone. If you look around NW Ont there is low water everywhere!! Last Spring LOTW was very low as well and when the rain came (1 in 200 year event) LOTW and Rainy Lake where at flood like conditions within days. If The lake would have been kept at higher levels during the winter and early spring the lake level would have exceeded the flood of 1950. This would have been devistating. It is very hard to predict what mother nature is going to do and they can only go on trends from the past. If we would have had a normal runoff with in the basin (which by the way extends to Atikokan) the lake would be at normal levels. But there was no snow this winter or rain this spring (yet)!!Have a look at the rest of the graphs on the site Rainy Lake/River, Lac La Croix, Turtle River where is the water going to come from to raise the lake???Fish on.."
531369,Guest,2003-05-25 10:03:00,0,Just got back. It was still 3 feet down. Great fishing. Have fun.
