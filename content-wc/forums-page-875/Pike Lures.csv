530638,Guest,2003-05-18 11:52:00,0,"Yellow five of diamonds is a great spoon. So is the williams wobbler silver. mepps #4&5 in black, red, yellow are great. Try rubber stuff like twisters jigged fast over weed beds."
530639,Pooch,2003-05-18 18:00:00,4619,"All spoons work well, but most of the time a gold color on one side out fishes a silver color on one side. Last year my wife and I were throwing the exact same spoon, but she had gold and I had silver. I would get follows over and over. When she threw the gold back to the same spot she got hit almost every time. Could have been the time of day, forage or light conditions, but there was an obvious difference that week. This is in tea colored water. Seems like anything that makes a little flash and fuss makes them mad! We have also done well fishing Rattle Traps for walleye and catching Northerns.Pooch"
530640,Guest,2003-05-18 18:39:00,0,Fished Lac Suel last year for Northern and it was a riot using Suicks and Top Water Baits. Also tried a Top Water spinner called a double buzz bait which they would continually hit.Have fun
530641,DanL,2003-05-18 21:21:00,262,I like to use spinner baits with gold blades and shirts with some gold tilsel in them. Thay work great on calm and sunny afternoons. I like to slow roll them just outside the weeds beds close to deep water. For slow rolling a spinner bait use the colorado blades. For going over the weeds use willow blades or a colorada and willow combination. Good luck!
530642,Guest,2003-05-19 16:03:00,0,anything with a hook will work on lac seul.
530643,Guest,2003-05-21 20:01:00,0,Any further input desired? Have suggestions for some lures not mentioned.
530644,Guest,2003-05-22 09:47:00,0,"Yea lets hear it. Can't believe the knowledge that exists on this board. I've always loved using suicks. Still am thinking about bringing frozen shiners, but need to check with MNR about legality"
530645,Guest,2003-05-25 10:05:00,0,"Just got back. Green or orange spinner baits, rattle traps and silver spoons with trailer were fantastic at LOTW."
530646,Guest,2003-05-26 19:29:00,0,"Three lures work great; a #3 or #4 Tiki Spoonfish in chrome finish ( see tikilures.com) I have used for over 30 years with very good success., Esox Pike Minnow in ""Fire Pike"" color from Cabelas, and a Smithwick Golden Rogue. Will provide more details if you want more information."
530628,Guest,2003-05-08 10:17:00,0,"I agree with Karl. Most of my big pike have been caught using either a 3/4 oz. Five of Diamonds or Red and White Daredevle. Although last Oct. my wife caught a 42"" at LOTW trolling a #5 gold Mepps with a black bucktail - I think it's called a muskie killer."
530622,snaggletooth,2003-05-08 10:52:00,135,Yes !!!!!!!!!!I do like them spinnerbaits !
530629,Guest,2003-05-08 10:56:00,0,"You must try a soft jerkbait. A big 6-7"" one with some weight works great. Pitch it out in likely spots and then erratically jerk back to the boat. White has been the best colour this year. Try senkos, riverside big-guns, or the original sluggo. I tell ya, they work."
530630,Steve CO,2003-05-08 14:25:00,267,1 oz Red Eye spoons in silver and gold. My most consistent for NW Ontario.
530631,Ia Walihntr,2003-05-10 15:07:00,320,"Always have been an F18 rapala or red white, 5 of diamonds, hammered nickel Darddevle troller. Last year, my brother-in law out fished every one in our group (12) trolling a mackerel color 1 oz Darvevle. They are a little harder to find than the old standby Dardevele colors but are very effective. We were fishing the Tug Channel area of LOTW."
530632,Vitreum,2003-05-10 16:00:00,221,#5 mepps spinners in chatreuse color variants
530633,twining,2003-05-12 13:07:00,1,"Pike will hit anything, but remember to use a stainless steel leader at least twelve inches long with ten or twelve pound test. The bigger pike will follow the lure to the boat, if the bait is lifted into the boat the Northern will scoot off. But if the lure runs the length of the boat he'll think it's a baitfish and will strike. So reel in to one end of the boat and leave about three foot of line out; drag the lure alongside the boat and then reel in. Don't fall in the water when he strikes. Technique is the trick with big Pike. Key in on hiding places (shadows in the water), and try to land the bait near. Drop offs for big ones; look up the word thermocline. Bigger lures don't always catch bigger fish. One key is flash to draw their attention, and then life-like for the take. The time of the year is another key, you may be going up during the spawn.? Be sure to double check the laws for the zone and region you're going to... They change often ie.. you can't use belly meat. Hope this helps, Lee"
530634,Stevie B,2003-05-13 08:13:00,157,"I'm really surprised that nobody mentioned the Mepps Syclops. This spoon has caught me more northerns than any other. I preffer the silver colored ones with a little bit of prism tape on it. I use a #3 or #4, depending on the depth and the rod I'm using. In my years of fishing in Canada it is the BEST lure that I have found for pike.Fish ON!!"
530635,Guest,2003-05-13 09:24:00,0,Husky Jerks and Thundersticks. The bigger the minnow bait the better the chance of a larger northern.
530636,Guest,2003-05-13 13:04:00,0,"Gotta have some 3 1/4"" gold Williams Wablers. That is the ONLY spoon that my Dad uses and he catches BIG pike with it. I'm constantly changing spoons and he always catches more pike than me."
530618,Thumper,2003-05-06 09:11:00,133,"I haven't been on Lac Suel, but have been a few miles north at Red & Gull Rock lakes.I've really enjoyed using my Daredevel Clicker, 1oz in the classic Red & White. This year I bought a new one and put assitional hammered nickel #1 willow blades on the sides. I'll see if it out produces the old, torn to h##l one I've been using.Also, an F18 Rapala in Black/Silver works in late May."

530620,Guest,2003-05-06 12:01:00,0,just use a big J hook and a piece of belly meat from the previous nights catch
530623,FOOTDOC,2003-05-07 20:51:00,139,Thanks for the opinions guys. I am heading up to God's Lake and appreciate the different points of view.
530624,Karl,2003-05-07 21:04:00,63,"I've caught all my biggest pike by accident on a jig/minnow and 8lb test spinning gear.But seriously, the people I've seen targeting and catching big pike use a 3/4oz five-of-diamonds daredevil tipped with a 3in white Berkely Power Grub. Best of luck. I've seen the brochures from God's Lake and I'm sure no matter what you're using you will catch some monsters."
530621,5Paulie4,2003-05-08 03:43:00,34,Check the local regulations on this one. The use of belly meat is taboo in most regions. Thunderstick
530625,5Paulie4,2003-05-08 03:48:00,34,"A Johnson Silver Minnow dressed with an Uncle Josh Bass Strip is super for casting. Use a stop and go, jerky retrieve. If you troll, a red/white Daredevle is hard to beat. And don't be afraid of pushing your throttle up a bit. Have a jaw spreader and hook disgourger handy.Thunderstick"
530626,PRD1,2003-05-08 09:18:00,458,"Husky Jerks in the larger sizes are a great lure. The ability to stop and have them just hang there triggers lots of fish, particularly early in the year when the water is cold. We have been using them along with Silver Minnows in either 3/4 or 1 1/8 Oz and as the other post noted hang a trailer (pork rind or white grub) on them. The rubber grubs do inhibit the action a bit and Uncle Josh just came out with a larger muskie/striper strip which works great. Only issue with pork rind is they do dry out if left out of the water so throw it in the minnow bucket when you're not using it.As the year progresses larger spinner baits are also a great lure, 3/4 oz or so. Good fishing,Paul"
530627,Guest,2003-05-08 09:24:00,0,Well come on guys....the best way to pick up a few Pike is DYNAMITE. Just tie a couple of sticks together and put a pound of lead on it (weight varys with water depth) flip the DYNAMITE into a weed bed and be ready with the dip net. Helps to have a couple of Beers first.... GOOD LUCK
530607,Guest,2003-05-05 17:12:00,0,Hey im leading up to lac seul June 21. Earfalls area/ What would be the best lures to use for pike. I know spoons work well but theres millions of them. Any suggestions would be great
530608,Bobby,2003-05-05 17:30:00,211,"If you can hook your mother-in-law up to one pound test your sure to come out a winner. Don't forget to set it with a good snap of the rod. ""Hold on to the boat, boys, she's gonna ram us!"""
530609,Guest,2003-05-05 18:17:00,0,Len Thompson #4 yellow and red. Can't be beat. you can find them at www.lenthompson.com. good luck and hope this helps.Duffy
530610,lobo1,2003-05-06 00:10:00,734,might want to throw in a #4 white with red stripe as well !!then there is always the JSM with some walleye guts trailing off the back.May 29th for me Sean !!lobo1
530611,Guest,2003-05-06 03:28:00,0,Large Doctor Spoon with chartreuse stripe weight about 1.25 or 1.5 ounces.
530612,Guest,2003-05-06 04:58:00,0,"Doctor Spoon page 65 Cabela's Spring catalog: 4.5 inches long, 1 3/16 ounce, cost $4.40, color 144-chrome/yellow #144 or 184 yellow/red diamonds"
530613,Fred_G,2003-05-06 05:00:00,908,My favorite is the Williams Wabler in hammered gold/silver. Either 1/2 oz or 3/4 oz works great. http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/te...ype=index&rid=Fred
530616,Kilroy,2003-05-06 05:11:00,59,A 3/4 oz. Weedless Silver Minnow is a real killer every year as well for me.Kilroy
530614,Guest,2003-05-06 05:32:00,0,"I second the Wabler. I've been using them since I was a kid. However, I've really only tried a few other brands of spoons. The Wabler really does hold true to its name and, sometimes, that movement is what sets the pike off. We've caught large Walleyes on it as well."
530615,Guest,2003-05-06 09:06:00,0,All good examples. I will add 2 killers..a. Smithwick Roguesb. Sluggos -Pike go nuts on these in the bays.
