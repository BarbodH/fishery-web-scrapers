Due to family obligations,I missed last year and will miss this year.Late May was always an exciting time because it meant preparing for the annual pilgrimage to Ontario. Now,as therapy for my depressed state of mind, I must live vicariously through those who do go to Canada. If anyone is fishing Perrault this spring, please post how you did. If you have any questions about Perrault, ask. It makes me feel better just reading about it."
