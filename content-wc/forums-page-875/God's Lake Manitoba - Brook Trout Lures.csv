Apparently, the river has excellant brookies and we are not too experienced with brook trout. So, any suggestions on types and sizes of lures is appreciated. Thanks"

We mare scheduled to leave 5-31 at 6:30 am. Are you on the same flight? As far as lures for brook trout, the only suggestion I have is len thonmpson spoons about 2 to 3 inches long. Also mepps number #2 and 3. Good luck and let me know."

We used any small heavy spoon we had but green seemed to work the best. 1/2 oz krocodile's, Cast Champ, Blue Fox Pixee spoons are a few to try. Bring quite a few as we had our best luck casting into the ugly fast water and you tend to loose a few in the rocks. Also a good idea to bring a small hand net if fishing from shore as they are sometimes hard to corral. Wish I was going with you, Good luck."
