531519,jimbo,2003-05-25 16:56:00,223,Just woundering if anyone had any hot tips on this area? Will be there on June 7 thru June 16th at Deer Path Lodge. Any help appreciated. Would like to catch some Northerns. Where do you go for them?Thanks in advance
531520,Guest,2003-05-25 18:56:00,0,"Launch your boat at the Lac Seul public launch near Hudson and your in a Northern Pike haven.Go big, use huge mepps or try fishing for walleye and you will catch them by the hundreds.If you want Musky Big Vermillion (the lake your on) is a good spot, also for Lake Trout. If you want Lake trout get some heavy center link sinkers, some 3 ways swivels and tie the weight to your main line and run about 5' of mono of the 3 way to a hot shot lure or bomber in white/red spot, or yellow and drop your weight down to bottom and reel in pumping the line every now and then till you get it to the top and drop it back down. This fishing is wild you will have a great time.Good luck!"

531522,Guest,2003-05-26 06:43:00,0,Just outside of town before Hudson on the north side. You will see the boat launch sign and a big Radio Tower on the south side.Its about 1/2 mile before Hudson.
