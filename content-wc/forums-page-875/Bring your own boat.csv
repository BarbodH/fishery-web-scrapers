531488,Guest,2003-05-24 06:21:00,0,My friend and I have been making the trip to Northern Lights Lake the last few years from Wisconsin. Are there any other lodges that we should checkout within this area? The beautiful lakeshore drive along with the quite border crossing are the way to go. We don't mind pulling the boat a couple more hours north. Thanks!
