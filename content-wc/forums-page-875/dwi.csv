531505,ackermannsacre,2003-05-25 09:58:00,196,If your ID is checked it could be a problem. Here is a fact sheet of what can be done if convictions are less than 10 years old.<a href=http://ftp.canadatourism.com/ctxuploads/en_publications/CTC_Fact_Sheets_2002-03.pdf>
531506,Guest,2003-05-26 12:37:00,0,"I didn't check the last web site that you were given, but yes, a DWI or DUI is a problem. In 2001 I was sent away with a DUI from 1983. I later saw an immigration officer at the same check point and was given a ""temporary waiver"" (one time only) in exchange for $200 Canadien and was let in (about 140 US--I used a credit card and the company gives you the exchange rate) I understand that if your offense AND probation is over at least 5 years before you enter you'll get a waiver.If you have time (at least 4 weeks) I suggest you apply for a permanent waiver. You need to complete a ""Criminal Rehabilitation Form"" (#IMM 1444) and get a certified copy of the Court disposition, two passport photos and a birth certificate--and another 200 Canadien or you can just wing it and hope they don't ask--""have you ever been fingerprinted"" or arrested. You could lie but...if the guys in the booth send you inside, your Social Security number and date of birth will give them all they need. Canadien authorities have full access to all US criminal records. If you decide not to get the waiver and chance it and go, and get caught (I suggest you feign ignorance about the rule), make sure you went to a busy border crossing where they are likely to have an immigration officer available (customs dudes man the booths-immigration decides if you get in!) to take your money and waive you in on a temporary--I went to a puny one and got there Friday at 6:00pm and spent the worst weekend of my life in Ogdensburg, NY instead of catching walleye until I could see the immigration guy on Monday morning.Good luck"
