530357,Dave,2003-05-01 17:36:00,258,"Jigger:Leave some walleye for us! We'll be going in after Labor Day. We were there the same time last year when the water level seemed higher than usual and did Ok mostly jigging in 18-25', biggest was 29 1/2. Most of our success was at the Narrows and on the portages to Copper & Smitty. Some people rave about Bullock in the spring, but we've never had any luck on it in Sept. Boats, motors and cabins are fine. Make sure the pilot pumps gas into the big tank from the barrels. If you would like more detail, let me know. Dave"
