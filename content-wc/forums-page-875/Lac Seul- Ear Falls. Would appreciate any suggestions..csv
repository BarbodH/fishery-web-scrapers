I have been studying my map, trying to pick out likely spots but nothing beats experience. Any info. you guys could give us on areas and methods would be much appreciated. The young fellas I'm bringing with me (first Canadian trip for 2 of them) also want to get into some fast pike action, so suggestions there would also help. I have always loved to throw johnson spoons with a trailer tail into the weeds. Great site, I have been reading and searching it regularly for the last couple of weeks."
