4005666,stjoeguy,2015-06-28 13:23:00,979,"Our trip to the Winoga outpost cabin on Lake St. Joseph this year was good. Reports from the two groups ahead of us were that there was a bear hanging around the cabin. Apparently someone before them left some garbage bags in the gazebo and the bear ripped through the screen. We didn't have any trouble and didn't see the bear until we were leaving the dock for the return home. It was walking along the shore of the island about 100 yards across the bay. The group ahead of us hit it with a rock between the eyes last week. Maybe that sent it over to the island. The wildlife report is 1 fox, 3 bear and 4 moose on the drive up, 1 bear across the bay while leaving and a bear on the way back. We saw many deer in MN, of course, but they don't count. Bugs weren't bad, which surprised us, since the group 2 weeks ahead reported bad mosquitos followed by flies. Jim sprayed the yard once for mosquitos and that kept them at bay. Weather was good enough. We were blessed with smooth 26 mile boat rides both on the way in and on the way out. Two days were sunny, but dead calm, and fishing suffered. The other five days had at least some rain, but we were only forced off the lake by lightning one time. Only used the drift sock with strong winds 2 times. The best word to describe the weather is variable. We watched black clouds come and go and winds go up and down several times a day most of the week. The group ahead of us had very strong winds every day, so by comparison, our weather was good. The 6 guy group was very good, pretty laid back and everyone pitched in. We had 4 handed cribbage games every night. Water level was down a foot or so from last year. The rock Dave hit last year was just out of the water this year. Ron took some more off his skeg and dinged the prop a bit heading back from Sandy Point. Trolling the Pembina River in 4 feet of water, where I've never seen any rocks, I found a 3' boulder. Fortunately I was using the electric trolling motor, so we just clunked and bounced over it without damage. A skull & crossbones icon immediately went on the Lowrance. Speaking of the river, we had a ball trolling it with spoons getting walleyes one after another with the occasional northern. Fishing was ""slower"" this year, but that's by St. Joe standards. Our standard is that more than 30 fish per day, per person qualifies as a ""good"" day. There weren't a lot of spots where we got doubles or got fish one cast after another. Looking back over the week on the way back, however, we realized that we probably averaged 25-30 fish per day. That means 6 of us caught well over 1,000 fish in a week. It's hard to complain about those numbers. Big fish of the week were Ron's 26.25' walleye and Pat's 42.5"" northern. Pat's was a new personal best and was caught on 3/8 jig, no leader, in about 10' of water. Way to go, Pat! Jim got a 24.25"" walleye and 38"" northern. Other than occasionally casting spoons in the river, we usually just target walleyes and get northerns by chance. We got fish anywhere from the shoreline to 25' deep. I tried some frozen minnows this year, but these were a flop not to be repeated. I've used frozen shiners at Lake of the Woods with success, but these were a river mix that were harder to get on the hook properly without turning them to mush. From now on I'm sticking with orange or fluorescent gulp minnow grubs or yellow twister tails. I'm giving up on live, frozen or salted bait as not being worth the effort. We got very few small walleyes this year. The most common size was 17-20"". A few hammer handle northerns were caught, but most were fat and in the 25-30"" range. All in all it was a pretty good week. We had no major injuries or boat incidents and it was a good group with a lot of fish. We started tweaking the menu for next year on the way back and are already starting to line up next year's crew. I can't wait!"
4005850,unclepaully,2015-06-28 15:08:00,112,"Thanks for the report. No bugs, no injuries, pretty good fishing, good friends, and a few wildlife sightings. Sounds like a pretty good trip."
4006114,Fred_G,2015-06-28 17:19:00,908,"Darn, now you have me really drooling. Sounds like you had a great week overall. We'll be leaving July 25th for a week, then my wife & I head back up August 8th. I have a new boat I just picked up this weekend so I'm a little nervous about that but I guess I'll just have to be more careful. Lake St Joe, is this heaven? For me, yes!"
4006514,stjoeguy,2015-06-28 19:21:00,979,"Fred, I dont know who Hal Turner was, but you might appreciate this marker that is on a spot called The Abyss just southwest of of Carling Island."
4006970,John N,2015-06-29 05:35:00,362,"Thanks for posting a report, sure getting excited about heading up! I'm with Fred and a bunch of other unruly suspects - we've been coming for close to 20 years, and sure are familiar with the marker by the Abyss, though didn't know the fellow. Agree with the sentiments for sure. John"
4007106,Fred_G,2015-06-29 06:26:00,908,"Hal Turner was a gentleman from Fort Dodge, Ia who started coming to the Old Post in the mid 80's. Hal died of cancer and his request was to have his ashes buried in the lake at the Abyss. One of the guys in his group made the marker from a rock he found at St Joe and then placed it there. I sure would have liked to met Hal. From talking with the guys he fished with he was a good man."
4007618,stjoeguy,2015-06-29 09:14:00,979,"Thanks for the story behind the marker, Fred."
4008034,Fishoil,2015-06-29 11:34:00,1277,"Thanks for the report, very enjoyable. I wouldn't completely give up on some form of bait in favor of twisters and Gulp though. I used to think the same but this year the salted minnows really outshined the plastic for me (and that's tough for me to admit). We were on Pashkokogan 2 weeks before you were on St. Joe. I was talking to the owner (Jim??) of Winoga at the All-Canada show this year and really hope to make it there sometime in the near future."
4008274,Guest,2015-06-29 12:41:00,0,Hi Everyone Looking forward to my first trip to Lake St Joseph. it looks like a topo map is not available. I have read about fishing the bumps and was wondering if anyone could post the lat/long coordinates of a few to get us boys started Many thanks greybeard
