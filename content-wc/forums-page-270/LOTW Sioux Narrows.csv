3997722,djk50164,2015-06-25 08:41:00,370,Go west
4001274,Redline,2015-06-26 10:34:00,73,Yep! Head out to the Cliff/Mouse/Bath/Britannia island area.
4005762,fishanytime,2015-06-28 14:25:00,63,More often than not the bigger walleyes will be a little higher on the hump.
4007634,srk-low,2015-06-29 09:15:00,78,A group of nine of us just got back after a week at our cottage. Action was probably the best I have seen in ten years. Only walleyed one day and got everything we needed at the humps around Chisholm Island. Rest of the week was spent chasing muskie. Six pike between 40 and 42. Five muskie between 41 and 51. We had lots of follows with the biggest around 54. Back up in three weeks to give it another shot. Good luck to all.
4008474,Lazy Fisherman,2015-06-29 13:58:00,276,srk Sounds like you had a good trip. Will not make it up that way until September. Hope the fishing stays good.
4008602,eyekeeper,2015-06-29 14:36:00,49,"Thanks For the reports, can't wait."
4009306,srk-low,2015-06-29 18:52:00,78,Lazy Fisherman Wow talking about fishing 850 miles away and we live within ten miles of each other. Small world.
