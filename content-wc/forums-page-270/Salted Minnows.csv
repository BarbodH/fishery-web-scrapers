4015650,John N,2015-07-01 17:29:00,362,"A quick thanks to Minnesota Bait & Tackle - minnesotabaitandtackle.com - I've ordered salted minnows for years from another source - while they were never great, the last couple years they were pretty poor. This year (following a recommendation from another WC guy) I ordered from Minnesota Bait & Tackle - enough salties for our group of 8 guys. A little snafu getting them here, sent them an email, they took care of it immediately and had them on my front porch in two days. In a foam cooler. Still with frozen bags inside. Vacuum packed in eight separate bags and lookin' good. I'll plan on introducing these minnows to some Canadian walleyes in a few weeks. Thanks again to Minnesota Bait & Tackle. John"
4016178,Ebarnett,2015-07-01 21:20:00,60,I also got minnows from there and mine look great. How are you planning on using them? Straight jigging? Tipping other lures? Slip bobbers? Ive never really used them before and want to make the best use of them.
4016322,John N,2015-07-02 01:50:00,362,"We've just tipped jigs with them, pretty simple formula for us. Lightest jig that will stay reasonably vertical in the conditions we're fishing (usually 3/8 oz. in our case), tip the jig with the minnow. Fish bites. We reel. John"

4018178,Iowa Hawkeye,2015-07-02 17:26:00,90,"Do they have medium size minnows? We normally make ours, but bought from Minnesota bait this year. We thought they were very small, more like a crappie minnow."
4018266,John N,2015-07-02 18:29:00,362,"Just have to check with them to see if they have what you want. Mine look like they're about 2.5"" or so. John"
4019234,pastorted,2015-07-03 08:57:00,19,"Hey, I really appreciate this information. I order some salted minnows from another source that claims to be the best. I live in Louisville, KY and when they came they were just mush and had started to rot. No ice or dry ice in the box. When I asked them they said they didn't ship them with ice - a little hard to understand in the middle of summer. Have called Minnesota Bait & Tackle and they are really helpful. Hopefully will be able to get some before we leave a week from today."
