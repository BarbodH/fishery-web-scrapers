574637,Guest,2008-06-03 19:40:00,0,Does anyone know if a non resident of Canada will need a boaters licence in 09' if they are to use a rental boat or houseboat from an outfitter in Canada? I know that if a non resident brings their own boat they won't need one if they are to stay for less then 45 days.

Thousands of folks would have to have a permit in the case of using a rental boat. I don't see it happening, from a strictly logic perspective."

Yeah but we are talking about the Canadian government and that means logic doesn't always apply ( lol )."

Also, if you have a boater's card from your home state that will be sufficient. There is no cost to the boaters checklist form. It is just a means of having the person renting the boat have some understanding of operation of the boat and safety issues that may be pertinent."
