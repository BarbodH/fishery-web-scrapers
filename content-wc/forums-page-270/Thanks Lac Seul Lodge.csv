4020634,Mike Kansas,2015-07-04 05:40:00,1463,Lac Seul Lodge and their Black Bay Outpost is as good as it gets. This year was our 33 year there. Started going before LS Lodge owned it. I would hate to guess how many thousands of Walleye we have caught there. This year in early June for our week we were near the 2000 mark AGAIN. Mike Kansas
3965618,Mike Kansas,2015-06-14 16:38:00,1463,Just got back from Black Bay Outpost on Lac Seul. The outpost is ran by Lac Seul Lodge. Once again the fishing was awesome lots of nice fish with a good share of over slot. Great service by Lac Seul Lodge as always. Mike Kansas
3965954,Carnhzkr,2015-06-14 18:41:00,964,"I second that, Mike. I've stayed at their Sunlight outpost two years ago, and at their main lodge last year and will be back at Sunlight this August. Had a great trip on my previous two and expect the same this year. Great hosts, equipment, and cabins on Lac Seul. Who could ask for more? I'd love to get into their Black Bay outpost, but that's kinda like trying to get season tickets to Cornhusker football games - you have to wait for someone to die. Say, how's your health these days? Any nagging coughs or unexpected lumps?"

3967386,worthsr,2015-06-15 09:15:00,52,"Mike, it's good to hear you made it home safely from another great trip. We leave Friday and will be at Black Bay Saturday. I get just as excited about the trip now as I did 20 years ago, it's a special place. Go Hawks!"
4014098,worthsr,2015-07-01 07:21:00,52,"Lac Seul Lodge, Black Bay trip 2015. The Lac Seul Lodge owners and staff are top notch! The facilities and boats are always in great shape. This year the rental boats were upgraded to 50HP motors. Our group consisted of 9 guys this year. Three guys in their 70's, four in their 40's and two teenagers. We had truck trouble on the way up and ended up only fishing 5 full days. Four boats caught 1,450 walleyes in 5 days. Two of the 70 year old guys caught their personal bests, a 29.5"" walleye and a very fat 28.5"" walleye. We've been spending a week at this outpost for the last 20 years, this was one of the best weeks ever. It's a special place and I miss it already."
4014122,Mike Kansas,2015-07-01 07:27:00,1463,Glad you had a great week. Mike Kansas
4015602,greg2648,2015-07-01 17:03:00,80,We leave on Friday. Great people. Great camp. Great fishing.
4015746,IL John,2015-07-01 18:36:00,45,"Sounds like my friend Tom was on your trip, he has always told me the Black Bay outpost trips were awesome, he sent me the pic of his 28"""
4015778,Riceburner,2015-07-01 18:40:00,436,What is the current water temp/height? Any changes/new hazards discovered? Current gas prices. Any issues with border crossings?
4016666,worthsr,2015-07-02 06:53:00,52,"Yes, Tom is a great fishermen and an even better person. He's also mastered frying up the walleye for lunch. The water height was exactly the same as last year, no new hazards discovered. The water temperature was about 65 on the main lake and mid 70's back in the bays. I didn't pay attention to the gas prices. Border crossing into Canada was 15 minutes total. Easy crossing largely in part to my 2015 Stanley Cup Championship hat and a little Chicago Blackhawks conversation with the border agent. Coming back into the US was even easier, maybe 5 minutes total. This was by far the quickest we ever crossed back into the US, must have just gotten lucky with the timing. Good luck on your trip."
