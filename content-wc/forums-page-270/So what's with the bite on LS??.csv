Fish scattered, none of the seasonal patters established, a few here and there, but spots we'd expect to fish for periods of hours only produced a few fish... I know there are others that did well, but it seems based on a total lack of anything scientific, but that the folks that did well were vastly outnumbered by the folks that experienced a bite considerably off the mark for what they'd normally expect. Two questions, then. What caused it? and has it improved/changed? My suspicions are the dry winter, the wet spring, the large inflow of cooler water, the wide variety of conditions (we had two days in the upper 80s, one in te upper 60s and one in the upper 50s, wind from every direction of the compass, or none at all, to standing 15 mph with gusts to 20+. We're going again in 2 weeks, so I'm trying to see if the bite has solidified and become more consistent with the seasonal patterns."
4001066,SinOrSwim,2015-06-26 09:35:00,1528,I watch a lot of facebook pages and the pictures of fish have definitely seemed slow the last couple weeks. I'm heading up Monday. I hope they get REALLY hungry.
4001106,rnnonmt,2015-06-26 09:47:00,992,"This year I agree the fish were not stacked up as much as usual. We did have to hunt and peck a bit. Our normal spots did not produce numbers but this year was the year of the slot fish and dinks. We did have our share of 35"" Pike and one at 40"" and one in our party at 42"" Those were the 2 biggest pike for the trip. 40"" was on a fire tiger rattlin rap (lipless) and the 42 was a jig/minnow on 6lb test I think. With the different circumstances this year we went back to basics by doing a lot of point to point jumping after the normal spots weren't producing like normal. On the calm side of each windy point produced what we call the ""point guard"" which was usually a pike in the low to mid 30"" range. If anyone catches a low 30's pike with a fire tiger rattlin rap please PM me so I can have you send it back to me. LOL! Walleye were also not in the numbers but we caught plenty of slot fish. Im thinking we caught 5 in the slot to 1 ratio. We found enough little guys 13-15"" range to eat. Good luck on your next trip."
4007674,tv4fish,2015-06-29 09:26:00,2694,"We were on Lac Seul last week (21st to 26th). We found decent fish in our regular spots (we hit Grassy Bay and Canoe Bay area). More fish in and over the slot than previous years (Thanks MNR for your policies). Water temp started out at 63 and warmed through the week to 70. Most fish caught on wind blown points in 12-16 feet of water. We found more decent sized northerns ""mixed in"" with the walleyes than normal. We typically vertical jig with crawlers/leeches and were surprised at the number of northerns caught (and, of course, jigs lost). One guy even put on a leader to prevent the usual ""bite-off"". We had a great trip."

We had about the same results last week in the NE section near Chamberlin Narrows. The mayflies affected the bite a little for 2 days. We jigged minnows and also slow trolled liddy rigs with crawlers. One guy used gulp all week and caught a lot of fish in and over the slot, but not any eaters. Had a lot of rain first 3 days, then very hot and sunny. Good Luck"
4007914,stjoeguy,2015-06-29 10:58:00,979,"We asked ourselves the same question when we were up at Lake St. Joseph during the same week as you. Fishing was good, but not ""hot"". Fish were scattered, not stacked up in some of the usual places. Dick told us that Old Post was reporting the same thing. We considered the usual suspects: ice-out dates, snow cover, cold fronts, too much sun, lack of wind, swings in temperature, wind direction and speed, time since spawning, bug hatch, etc. Then we wrote it off to every year is different and we just have to go find them. Of all the possible causes I like the ever changing wind direction and speed the most."
4008522,IronDioPriest,2015-06-29 14:07:00,96,"We were up June 12 for 5 days. Water temps were 5-10ยบ warmer than typical for our same week in prior years. Eyes had already moved out of the bays adjacent to the main lake where we usually find them stacked, and were staging on the points and along the shorelines near those bays. Fish were on the move. We'd find them, the bite would be hot, then suddenly taper off. We'd move along the shoreline, and find them again. Movement was key. Standing still and vertical jigging a hot-spot is usually a favorite method, but this year it was an inferior method. In the end, we caught our usual numbers and sizes. We had shore lunch every day and brought home our full limit of 17.9""ers. Just took a little hunting. And as others have said, we had to catch lots of overs and slots and lots of dinks in order to get our eaters."
4008586,prov1800,2015-06-29 14:28:00,5010,"Big lakes like lac seul and eagle behave differently.it all has to do with surface water temps.lac seul main lake current always has cooler water and have seen 60 f temps in july.when i see that i wont even think about fishing regular spots for that time of the year.yes you might catch a few but not many.usually just around mid june till late june mayflies are hatching and most walleyes will be in the bays gorging on them.most people wont want to fish near mayfly hatches but thats the best place to be.fishing two to five ft of water.i will be on lac seul this saturday for a day taking some cluents.iam sure the fishing will be nuts wether i get to the main lake or not.everybody always wants to motor out to the main lake, but there passing up all the good fishing in between.walleyes hold up in the weed beds as they do on eagle to.still catching walleyes in 5 ft on eagle as well as 30 ft right now.every year is slightly different just need to adjust to the fish not what your thinking."
4009378,Blades-n-Beads,2015-06-29 19:01:00,484,"I'm with Prov1800 on this one. I will always hit the weeds first up to mid July on bigger water. Snap on a northland slick stick bouncer and drag your crawler harness right through those weeds. You will be amazed most of the time how many big fish are in the weeds feeding even at mid day. Just look for some wind blown weedy shoreline and start there, if there not there work your way out."
4018194,Mark Oakley,2015-07-02 17:32:00,21,our weather has alot todo with it one minit its sunny the next its storming. i was out guideing a house boat for a week and i had a hard time producing. feel upset about it. but weather and may flies did its part in slowing the bite down. we went into scaler down kecabeka there was a layer of may flies a half inch deep down the whole stretch of kecabeka you could see the fish coming up and feeding on them. but the bite is getting better for sure. the lake getting back to normal
