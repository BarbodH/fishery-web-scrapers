3987969,smbrickner,2015-06-22 08:09:00,276,"Just got back on Saturday.Caught a lot of fish. One evening between Edwards and Indian we probably caught 50 walleye on one small spot. Just hit the Spot Lock and threw out slip bobbers. Caught fish in as shallow as 3 feet and as deep as 22. Ended up catching 5-6 musky without even casting for them.Took the portage from Little Boulder up to Augite(Spelling?) and caught our limit of Lakers.Overall not a bad trip but a lot of small fish. It was nice that we didn't have to kill the fish right away like on Minnitaki so you can try to cull up to larger fish to take home. Everything over 19' was released of course.EDIT:Only real annoying part of the trip was pulling the boat out on Friday. Apparently loading a boat was way too difficult for the 3 people ahead on me waiting to use the launch. It was pretty ridiculous. When you have 4 people in the truck and the boat is on the trailer slightly crooked you can just wiggle it over yourselves, you don't need to back it in and out of the water for 15 minutes. Morons."
4008250,SpoonieLuv,2015-06-29 12:22:00,16,How is the water temps for some of the Chain lakes?
4012802,wishinfishinmn,2015-06-30 17:26:00,52,72 in indian and edward. a little cooler in boulder. mayfly hatch has slowed them down.
3961441,SpoonieLuv,2015-06-12 21:24:00,16,"I've caught some big girls in the middle of the day with high sun in less than 12 fow. Sometimes even shallower, through the summer."
3962129,bobbylfishermon,2015-06-13 09:42:00,241,"I agree sir, but, are you fishing clear water lakes like you experience in Canada ? Nature has given the walleye a clear cut advantage over forage by being able to see MUCH better in low light conditions , which makes them more active, some lakes (Eagle) have a ban on night fishing, why, harvesting too many big fish........ just my opinion"
3962649,SpoonieLuv,2015-06-13 13:40:00,16,No doubt the best times are low light conditions. I just want people to know they can be caught all day at times so dont count em out. I see some fishing 30 fow in the summer while we are hammering them in 12 fow and less. This is ON the Indian Chain as well as some of the clear bush lakes we fish west of Cliff Lake.
3973106,IAWally,2015-06-16 20:27:00,38,"Back from another great trip to the chain. Lots of Walleyes caught a 26"", 27"" and a 27.5"" all fat and healthy and still swimming to fight again. Stayed at KC's Landing great camp. Several Musky trolling for walleye."
3974994,wishinfishinmn,2015-06-17 10:55:00,52,IA Wally Going up next week. Where on the Chain did you feel produced the best? Which lakes did you like to try? WishinFishin
3976178,IAWally,2015-06-17 18:41:00,38,We had our best luck in Edwards and Indian Lakes. For numbers jigging was best for size trolling cranks produced the larger ones.
3976226,prov1800,2015-06-17 18:56:00,5010,When your talking numbers how many you putting in the boat.
3976306,IAWally,2015-06-17 19:29:00,38,We were getting 30-40 in about 2 hours from 900pm till 1100pm. A lot of smaller ones but steady action.
3977162,prov1800,2015-06-18 06:24:00,5010,Those are good numbers
3978226,SpoonieLuv,2015-06-18 10:37:00,16,Those #s are about the same for the whole chain. I prefer Canyon Lake over the others for the least amount of pressure and it's a better musky/smallie lake also. Edwards would be my second choice for the Chain.
3950729,bobbylfishermon,2015-06-09 14:52:00,241,"I'm sure harnesses will catch ""em"", some were tipping jigs with crawlers or a half crawler and catching fish too......."
3953897,smbrickner,2015-06-10 12:23:00,276,Any tips for Lakers on there. I am going to dedicate a day to them. I have never caught one before and I really want to.
3954121,bobbylfishermon,2015-06-10 15:12:00,241,"Smbrickner, when we left ,the water was 61 degrees sooooooo My guess would be the lakers are down deep, you can dead stick cut bait down in the ""GUT"" (just like catfishing), after spring the lakers scatter and are hard to find. Your camp owner might know more...."
3958769,Puckfan21,2015-06-12 06:23:00,8,Any more quick tips for this area before I leave?
3959017,pale ryder,2015-06-12 07:15:00,1937,"When you troll or cast crank baits use a wire leader, because you will get muskies on them. I use uncoated 18 lb. 7-strand."
3959105,Puckfan21,2015-06-12 07:38:00,8,We usually do while trolling anyways. Thank you
3959985,bobbylfishermon,2015-06-12 12:02:00,241,"Puckfan21, the best tip I could possibly give you FISH THE RIGHT TIME OF DAY, for wallys, the first 2-3 hrs of day light, and the last 2-3 hrs of daylight!!!!!!!!!! I hear all this crapola from guides saying the chain only has small fish, that's because they are fishing 8am-5pm, try fishing the hours that the fish are most active you'll find a whole different program, but your a$$ needs to get out of bed in the morning and be fishing early morning and late evening..... Hope you have a great trip Puckfan21, stay safe man....."
3960057,smbrickner,2015-06-12 12:41:00,276,There is always at least one morning where rising early is difficult though.
3960105,Puckfan21,2015-06-12 13:10:00,8,Thank you. We got a good group of guys. It should be a great time! Hopefully I will have some good fishing stories for everyone!
3960449,bobbylfishermon,2015-06-12 15:27:00,241,"SMbrickner, totally understand the early rising, I slaughtered the brain cells when I was younger, and the three surviving brain cells I have left, will NOT tolerate that kind of behavior anymore, that is, not without paying the consequences, if you know what I mean, and, I'm sure you do......."
3948777,pjshorthorn,2015-06-09 07:01:00,5654,Thanks. I learned something new today. It does make sense. Nice fish either way PjShorthorn
3948785,bobbylfishermon,2015-06-09 07:04:00,241,"P.S. The ministry can check your phone for picture,,,,, if I understood him correctly !!!"
3948793,pjshorthorn,2015-06-09 07:06:00,5654,"Out of curiousity, did the MNR approach you after observing you catch the fish or did you approach them? PjShorthorn"
3948849,smbrickner,2015-06-09 07:17:00,276,Sounds like I will be able to save on bait if the crankbait bite is working! I leave Friday night. Getting real antsy now.

3949137,smbrickner,2015-06-09 08:03:00,276,We are staying at Clarks on Edwards lake. Like I said I have never been there before but I have a Red Lund Pro Guide with a red Talon on the back. Give me a wave if you see me. I'll be the 6'7 guy with a cigar in his mouth most likely.
3949249,Puckfan21,2015-06-09 08:21:00,8,Always going to wave down a fellow Packer fan. It will be my friends and my dad and his buddies. We will probably be looking lost ha. Trying to do some research and seeing what is hot and working.
3950297,bobbylfishermon,2015-06-09 13:23:00,241,"Hey PJShorthorn, the ministry watched us from their boat and were checking two other boats down the shoreline, about 15 minutes after the 45incher was caught we headed back for lunch and the ministry followed us back to camp, checked our fish, 2 eater wallys (14inches) and our licenses and were more than polite!!!!! If you're headed to the chain guys, crankbaits up shallow, 8ft.-in, trolled or casting,first couple hours of daylight or the last couple hours,,,,,, for bigger fish,,,, jigs and minnows inbetween, lots of fish being caught 8in.-25in. water temps were starting to warm 61 degress and some fish were sliding deeper during the day, 10-13 ft. Have fun amigos and stay safe out there!!!! Tell Lance and Cheryl that Bobby&Jane from Omaha say howdy,,,, wish we were there!!!!!!"
3950393,smbrickner,2015-06-09 13:44:00,276,Now I am getting really excited. With the water warming up I am sure we will pull a lot of crawler harnesses too.
3940809,smbrickner,2015-06-06 08:25:00,276,As long as we catch enough walleye to eat for supper I am happy. We actually chose this lake because of the musky population because that seemed like a nice change of pace.
3940889,SpoonieLuv,2015-06-06 09:17:00,16,I really like Canyon Lake for bigger musky. It usually has less pressure than the other chain lakes. Excellent walleye and some real good smallmouth too.
3943049,wishinfishinmn,2015-06-07 08:43:00,52,"My family have been on the Chain for about 5 years. We did Lac Seul and Eagle for years before. Big bodies of water. My dad feels Boulder is the most scenic area of water he has fished. My 11 year old has a 30 inch walleye replica on the wall from Forest Lake last year and my dad caught a 30 inch walleye trolling for muskies with a rapala in Little Boulder 2 years ago. We stay at KC's landing and see that Canyon Lake is just up the road. Would love some intel on this lake to start a new adventure. How is the landing? Any reefs to worry about? Spots for smallies, muskies, and eyes? WF"
3943561,Bigfish10702,2015-06-07 12:23:00,60,"This will be my 10th year going up to the Indian Lake Chain, we go in September and stay at K.C.'s Landing (The Clarks are just fantastic!!!). There are lots of walleyes to be found all over, you have to move around a bit to find the bigger ones. Boulder and Little Boulder are deep and clear, all others are much more shallow with varied clarity. BEWARE going through the narrows between lakes (Edward to Cobble) there are stumps below! It looks like clear sailing through them, but you have to follow the channel or you may find some problems. If you go back to Moose and Little Moose BEWARE The bay leading into the mouth of the channel has LOTS of nasty stumps. go slow and easy - once in the channel there are rocks at the beginning, and again at the end just as you get to Moose - Be careful many a prop has spun its last in there!"
3945665,smbrickner,2015-06-08 07:25:00,276,"Unfortunately Musky won't technically be open when we are up there. Not that we were planning on taking any home, but I worry about getting in trouble even casting shorelines."
3946809,bobbylfishermon,2015-06-08 14:08:00,241,"Just got back from the chain Sat. the 6th, we were there 2 weeks and if not for 89 and 81 year old mom trouble (falls) we would still be there! Wife got a 30in. and a 28in wally, and I got a 45in. musky and was watched by the MNR ( thru binco's) to see if I would take her out of the water to take a picture (BIG NO NO ) they were very nice guys and thanked us for KNOWING the LAWS !!!!!! The chain is a numbers fishery, BUT, the last 4-5 years something has changed in the forage base and the numbers are fatter and longer, love the lake, Oh, got a 38inch musky that went well into the 30-35 lb range, thickest musky I ever caught. would have loved to have a picture of that FAT GIRL, but that's a BIG NO NO...... Everything was caught on crank baits, 8ft. and in, trolling !!!!"

3947801,SpoonieLuv,2015-06-08 19:58:00,16,It is illegal until musky season actually opens to remove the fish from the water. Water release only.
3948433,pjshorthorn,2015-06-09 05:07:00,5654,Ahhhhh. The season wasn't open. Got it. Thanks for clarifying. PjShorthorn

3931273,smbrickner,2015-06-03 08:04:00,276,Anybody been up there yet? We always fished Minnitaki and are trying a new lake so I am going in blind.
3932401,prov1800,2015-06-03 13:16:00,5010,Nice lake chain of 7 diff lakes to go to.farther ones are deep and hold lake trout.if your used to the numbers of fish you catch on minnitaki iam afraid this lake will dissapointe you.fish are somewhat smaller also.good numbers lake for smaller myskies .
3933497,Blue Lk,2015-06-03 19:49:00,269,"I met up with bobbylfishermon the other day,he was staying at Indian Lake Lodge,he showed me some pics of some of the walleye he & his wife caught & released,absolute tanks!hopefully he will post a report when he gets home"
3933561,prov1800,2015-06-03 20:04:00,5010,Every lake has slobs in it.i have pictures of slobs in aboutcevery lake around here.but basically the chain has smaller fish in it.point i was getting across cause someone asked is the fishing is no where near it is on minnitaki.with lots of slobs and you can catch a bunch of fish there in a hurry.if you have ever fished minnitaki i wouldnt have to explain myself.i fish the sioux lookout area a lot and you cant compare the chain to any of it.just like the chain doesnt hold a candle to eagle either.i just giving my opion to somebody asking and just giving it to him straight.
3933873,IAWally,2015-06-03 21:35:00,38,I am heading up on Friday 06/05/15. Our group has been going for the last few years. We fished eagle before that. We have had much better luck fishing the Indian Lake Chain than we did at Eagle. Not saying its better than Eagle but we have had more consistent results. I think our luck is better because of the size of the Lake. Eagle is so big that I think due to our lack of experience we spent a lot of time fishing unproductive areas. We are now at the point were we find a good number of walleye without wasting much time hunting for them. There are a lot of small musky in the chain. I have had some very large ones follow fish that are hooked up to the boat. We like the Chain one of the reasons is that we don't have a dozen other boats join use every time we reel in a walleye. The size seems to be getting better every year but that may be due to the fact we have multiple spots marked that produce for us.
3933929,prov1800,2015-06-03 21:57:00,5010,I you fished eagle a didnt do well is probably due to not fishing the right spots.i guide on eagle a lot and its a walleye factory.not hard to put a 100 + walleyes in the boat out there with some hogs mixed in there.lots of self guided fisherman give up on eagle because its to intimadating and then they they go look for smaller lakes to fish.guides usually can solve that problem.ive taken lots of guts out and should them areasvto fish from the west arm to the east end.they absoluty love it out there.nothing like it to get out on the humps and catch fish all day.same goes for lac seul.incredible fishing bigger yet then eagle.i would put minnitaki right up there to.cedar lake being smaller acts like a big lake also when it comes to catching fish.ive fished the chain and its ok i know guys that live on the chain and know guts that have cabins on boulder.so i know what the fishing is like.but i like going out with ten dozen minnows and come back with a empty minnow bucket.but wherevver guys are and happy we thats good to.
3934017,IAWally,2015-06-03 23:07:00,38,"Yeah we defiantly could have used a guide on Eagle but being stubborn we didn't hire one mistake on our part. But we are more than happy with the number and size of walleye we catch. I am sure that there are better places to fish and we may try some in the future as we get more experience on walleye. Old bass fishing habits are hard to break. I personally like to try new places while the rest of the guys like the familiarity of the Indian Lake Chain. My son and I have been going to different lakes for our fall trip but this year he wants to try the chain since he hears the guys talking about it. Its close enough that I might be able to talk a couple of the guys into trying Eagle for a day next week. If there is good weather, last time we were at Eagle the weather kept us in the Cabin for two days."
3934137,prov1800,2015-06-04 04:15:00,5010,The weather can do that.iam off to cedar lake today.smaller lake but very good fishing and the crappies are spawning so will try to get a few ofcthose today as well.
3935089,srj,2015-06-04 09:14:00,971,"Haven't been there in quite a while but this is what we found. Nice chain, easy to navigate. A really cool variety of lakes from shallow and stained to deep and clear. It may have changed, but oddly there were no northerns in the chain. Lots of walleyes, but few biggies. It's harder to find them on Cobble/Boulder but fairly easy on the other lakes. Boulder has lake trout and a very good whitefish population...fun and tasty. Throwing 3/8 ounce orange whistler jigs and orange twisters on points caught lots of muskies but there doesn't seem to be many (if any) big ones in there. Still lots of fun on walleye gear. Don't discount the shallow lakes for eyes or the shallow south bay on Indian. As Prov said, the other bigger name, bigger size lakes provide bigger fish, but you will probably find the chain lots of fun. For a change of pace and a totally different fishing experience, you could run over to Wabigoon for a day. Or maybe Thunder Lake if you can still access it. It's fun to explore. Good luck"
