4013298,Bill Krejca,2015-06-30 19:53:00,6107,A beautiful remote area with very good fishing. Bill
4013530,GBS,2015-06-30 21:08:00,2271,"Consider Grass River Lodge (http://www.grassriverlodge.com/) Drive-in resort in Manitoba (one days drive straight north from Winnipeg). They do guide for some of the biggest northern you have ever seen. My wife and I were catching several a day in the 40-45"" range, and our bests were 49"" and 52"" respectively. Walleye fishing is very good, and the guide will be glad to go after them, anytime. There is always a prepared shore lunch with fish you caught 15 min. before. Ike (the owner) will also fly your party and guide out to a remote lake for hitting that 100-150 walleye goal, as an day-trip option anytime during your stay. An overall class operation."

4014290,Fishoil,2015-07-01 08:07:00,1277,I agree Bill. I recommended Shady Roost because of my personal experience with the level of service but have to give the nod to Obabikon for the scenic location. The roost is nice but it doesn't compare with the view out there.

4016450,Guest,2015-07-02 05:22:00,0,minnow its our first time to o'sullivan's 2nd week of September I always value your opinion we fish 65% walleyes 35% northerns do you think we can realistically catch 25 walleyes/day/man also a catch a 10# plus northern we fish hard 10 hours/day every day will be housekeeping suggestions for any areas to work appreciate your suggestions thanks jim wolf Chicago boys talked to shelly a few times on phone seem like decent owners they are booked the whole summer which impressed me she said mostly repeat customers year after year which tells me they must be catching a lot of fish to return year after year

4009178,Rayiii,2015-06-29 18:16:00,40,I would like to take my wife on a nice fishing trip to canada. I have been there 30 or more times but always a do it yourself trips. I would like to have it all guided and all meals provided. I have been to places that i have caught 150 walleye a day and to places we caught very few for the week. Looking mainly for walleye and northern. looking more for numbers of walleye then fewer bigger fish. Looking to stay under the 4000$ mark. Any help in finding such a place would be great. Thanks for your thoughts
4009290,ftfarms,2015-06-29 18:52:00,444,My aunt and uncle used to stay with witchbay camp on lake of the woods. He never had any complaints so it must be top notch. (he's never satisfied). We stayed at grassy narrow lodge in milesbay. We don't do American plan or guides but we ate in the lodge one night and it was awesome. The guides had people on fish everyday. Service we had was awsome I would also call Jared at obabikon bay. These are all on lake of the woods.
4009418,Obabikon,2015-06-29 19:18:00,2370,"We at www.obabikon.com could provide all of that. Feel free to shoot me an email to get some exact pricing and any other info. [email protected] Also, thanks for the support ftfarms!"

4009850,lunker99,2015-06-29 20:48:00,236,"I've got a trip that I bought at a NWTF banquet that sounds like what you're looking for on McKay Lake near Longlac, Ont. Trip isn't going to work out for me, so trying to move it. Details are on the swap board. Can be taken this year or next. Check it out and their site to see if it's what you'd like and let me know if you're interested to get it transferred."
4011474,KSjim,2015-06-30 10:33:00,88,"I would highly recommend Maynard Lake Lodge. Fishing,food and accommodations are all very good. Maynard is an easy lake to fish and you have the English river to explore also. It's worth the trip up to Oak Lake to view the waterfalls coming into Oak. It is the largest falls I have seen in NW Ontario. Maynardlake.com"
4011978,Lovetofish,2015-06-30 13:16:00,458,I have a friend who has gone to New Moon several times and he speaks very highly of this place. He's taking his wife early September.
