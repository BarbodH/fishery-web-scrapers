Probably the best numbers to size fishing I've had in 10 years there. Water level is down about a foot from ""normal""."
3980178,wiwalleyefreak,2015-06-18 21:00:00,25,Thanks for the information. Checking to see if any one has another current report on the great Dogtooth Lake.
4006570,wiwalleyefreak,2015-06-28 19:41:00,25,We leave for Dogtooth in a few days. Any one have any new information on Dogtooth?

We went early June or mid-late July. We only fished for big fish 90% of time and would catch our eaters in early evening. I would spend all my time on wind blown points and reefs from 6-10 am, bfast and beers 10-4, and then same thing from 4-9pm. We would usually have milk run of 8-10 spots depending on wind and hit them straight for 5 hours. Usually catch 1-2 big fish and then move, if you marked them they bit cuz they were up in 10-18 feet. That was our plan and we would consider 20 fish per day a great day for the boat. But, those fish would be 23-30"" and someone would always get a 30.5 or 31"" on the trip. Good luck"
4016138,wiwalleyefreak,2015-07-01 20:59:00,25,Mavs Thanks for the info. This will be my 4th trip to Dogtooth and your description is spot on for our typical day. Good lake for big fish... hard to catch large numbers. Thanks again.
