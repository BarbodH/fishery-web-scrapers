4007706,bigwalleye1,2015-06-29 09:41:00,2632,"TV, which way do you go from the Falls to home? Just curious, because I overnight on the east side of Mille Lacs, go up 47 to Aitkin, 169 to Grand Rapids, 2 to Deer River, 6 to Big Falls on 71 and 71 to I Falls. Is there a route using 53 that's shorter/faster/nicer?"
4007746,tv4fish,2015-06-29 10:00:00,2694,"Hey Big : We use a slightly different route (kind of the ""eastern one"") - We start out with an ""important"" breakfast over at Malmo, then east on County 2 to 65, then north on 65 to Hibbing/Chisholm - then take 73 to 53 into the Falls. You bring up a good route for the guys, however, due to the construction on 53, your route may be better this year. I believe your route IS a little shorter."
4008730,dutchboy,2015-06-29 15:14:00,5717,I would come down 35 to Harris and scoot down county road 2 to Cambridge and 65 home from there. It's 4 lane all the way from Cook south. Without construction it's a breeze.

4001434,bigwalleye1,2015-06-26 11:34:00,2632,"Others will weigh in on 53, there were some construction issues earlier this year. 502 looks very nice, no construction. The last 20 clicks into Dryden are the roughest, but you'll be pleased to know the entire road is brand new blacktop from the T on the north end of 502 all the way into Dryden. Safe travels!!"
4001474,55walleyes,2015-06-26 11:54:00,131,Good news on 502 and the stretch from T into Dryden because that was rough last year.
4001490,ogilville,2015-06-26 12:16:00,262,"I was at Perrault Falls fishing Wabaskang Lake last week. I live south of Indy and take I65 to I465 around Indy to I 74 west to Bloomington, IL, then north on I39. It seemed like there was as much road construction with the orange barrels and one lane driving in IN. & IL. as there was open road. Maybe not as much but it seemed like it. WI. was pretty good, mostly open road smooth driving. US 53 south of Int. Falls had a few places where the road was down to gravel for a short stretch. They did have warning signs but the drop off at start of gravel was pretty rough. By the time we were coming home they did have them patched with asphalt. Much smoother that way. So, it could all be changed by now. Good luck and happy fishing!"
4001546,Guest,2015-06-26 13:01:00,0,fellow fishermen crossed the border 1st week of june about 20-25 miles south of border on rt 53 major road repairs just have to gut it out jim wolf Chicago boys enjoy your trip
4001738,Bakefish,2015-06-26 15:09:00,1077,Slow down when approaching those construction patches on 53. Saw a boat in a gas station missing it's axle. They didn't slow down. Looked like locals too.
4001754,h8go4s,2015-06-26 15:33:00,1673,"US 53: Roadway reduced to one lane. Between St Louis County Road 520 (16 miles north of the Orr area) and Koochiching County Road 7 (International Falls). The roadway is reduced to one lane. There is a width limit in effect. Short delays are possible. Reduce your speed. Look out for flaggers. Width limit 12'0"". Until August 20. Comment: On MN 53 between Orr and International Falls culvert replacement. There will be patches of gravel on roadway and intermittent delays in several locations. Rat Root River bridge is reduced to one lane with portable sign system and restricted to 12' wide. Loads wider than 12' wide will need District approval for MN 53 not on the Rat Root River bridge.

4001802,dutchboy,2015-06-26 15:51:00,5717,"53 is being repaved. When it says ""bump"" theyaren't kidding, slow down. Take your time the fish aren't going anywhere. To the mini van from Michigan that passed on the RIGHT side if i see you again you will need a body shop and tow truck."
4007074,teddi,2015-06-29 06:10:00,349,105 from perrault falls is going to get dug up right away.
4007642,tv4fish,2015-06-29 09:16:00,2694,Maybe just an update on 53 - we did not have to drive on any gravel coming back last Saturday (the 27th). They are milling the surface and repaving. We just had to drive on paved shoulders in some locations.
