Glen always getting crappie on the dock and Lorraine always baking fresh bread and goodies and leaving them in your cabin. I believe it has been sold if not not once or twice since Glen left. I know they had a website but not sure.
4002330,Blue walleye,2015-06-26 20:24:00,29,I knew a guy named Dave was running it. I deer hunt up there and hunted with him 1 year. The website should be canadianhaven.net The phone number is 807-484-2628
4006298,Slushfish,2015-06-28 18:29:00,263,"Dave took over half of the camp last year, Brian and Kathy kept three of the cabins. Talked to Dave this spring and he told me contact Brian about renting a cabin. Haven't got a reply from him so, not sure what's going on."
