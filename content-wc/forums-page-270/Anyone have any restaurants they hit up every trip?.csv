3977698,bigwalleye1,2015-06-18 08:12:00,2632,"We didn't eat t the Wellington, choosing instead to do all our meals in camp. However, we fuel every day at the gas pumps at Wellington, and all looked pretty quiet there. Our last day, we hit Horton's for coffee before leaving at 7 am, and the Wellington was a ghost town."
3978058,IlliniMuskie,2015-06-18 09:37:00,22,Northwoods Brewpub in Eau Claire for supper on the way up (immediately followed by a trip to Scheel's). Perkin's in Superior for late night pie/coffee. Chocolate Moose for lunch on the way back home.
3979274,Fishin Fun,2015-06-18 14:49:00,218,We usually hit the Shore Lunch Cafe in International Falls early on Saturday morning. It has good food and service. The problem is that it is quite small and sometimes we have to wait a few minutes.
3985146,forgop,2015-06-20 23:13:00,880,I ate at Clyde's on the way up and as I passed through on my way home today. Get the Big C.
3985186,fishanytime,2015-06-21 01:15:00,63,"sometimes the slowest McDonalds also, at least some days anyway."
3985202,Gipper,2015-06-21 03:40:00,76,Yup. 16 hours and a water pump and a generator to Lac Des Mille Lacs north of Thunder Bay. I suppose it would be 12 max now.
3985610,3M TA3,2015-06-21 07:38:00,2846,"On your way up, just south of the big bridge is Indian River. Give Vivio's a try. Still a great place after more than 30 years. Just off I-75 south of town."
4007098,Kartman35,2015-06-29 06:23:00,245,Just wanted to point out that the dish (french fires with cheese and gravy) is called 'poutine' not 'poutain'. It's only worth pointing out because 'poutain' sounds like 'putain' which happens to be a french slang word for prostitute. Best to be careful with what you order at the resto
4007610,tv4fish,2015-06-29 09:12:00,2694,"Restaurant ""status"" for Sioux Lookout: If any of you want to grab breakfast ""out"" in Sioux Lookout, my suggestion w/b The Wellington (they open at 7) or The Lamplighter Hotel (just south of town - they open at 6). They don't advertise their breakfasts, but I think they should - good food. As previously posted, Knobbys is charred and Dick and Nellies not open."
3967002,Gipper,2015-06-15 07:46:00,76,Paul Bunyans in the Dells was a stop I always looked forward to. This was back before the freeways were built and we drove up Hwy 12 and 53 to Duluth. I remember trying to OD on pancakes sausage and milk.
3969074,Aspencreek,2015-06-15 16:22:00,2911,"That trip was an easy 8 hrs from the Dells to Superior before the I system, now 5 hrs from Madison to Duluth."
3969226,strength22,2015-06-15 16:58:00,49,"bunyans was always my gramps and old mans favorite stop. Was always so exciting to stop and we all eat as a group with such excitement. They are both passed on and the group is pretty much four of,us now so we do not stop anymore but sure would love to again. Now seems the stop is at the choo choo depot as you come into superior. It has changed hands a few times and when we first started stopping there they were a brewery and made their own root beer which was amazing. So we stop,there and my buddies love their bloody Mary's. Like a meal in a glass."
3969586,Golden Eagle,2015-06-15 18:34:00,2642,Meals on the road can't compare with our walleye dinners and Whopper's pasta sauce when we're in camp.
3975282,Fish_Heads,2015-06-17 12:44:00,154,Will be traveling thru the Michigan upper peninsula on our way to Canada in July & over nighting in St Ignace Mi. Any recommendations on where to eat there or within 20 miles or so ?I don't really want to have to go back across the bridge to eat if we don't have to.Thanks in advance !Fish

3976290,bigwalleye1,2015-06-17 19:18:00,2632,"I like the Shorelunch Cafe in I Falls. Good breakfast, and then push on to Sioux Lookout. Same place on the way home. A 7 am departure from Sioux and a coffee stop in Dryden at Tim Horton puts us in the Falls about time for an early lunch. Have the hot roast beef. Comfort food right there."
3976802,BuckeyeBill,2015-06-17 22:24:00,76,I sure missed Knobby's this year. We would always drive into Sioux Lookout for one meal. Wonder if they will rebuild?
3977082,bigwalleye1,2015-06-18 05:45:00,2632,"Souinds like it, esp since the float plane service for their outpost camps is based there as well. Howver, this season is likely lost, by the time the investigation, insurance, demolition, etc is done."
3977314,tv4fish,2015-06-18 06:59:00,2694,"So big: Could you still get decent service at the Wellington - or was it ""standing room"" only??"
3961769,forgop,2015-06-13 05:25:00,880,My parents took me there when I was a kid. Need to hit up that area for a trip with my kids one of these days.
3962121,LoDo,2015-06-13 09:39:00,721,"We roll 6-8 in our group each year. 5 fly into Minneapolis from Denver, CO. We are picked up by 2-4 in an old school Forrester RV and make our trip to Red Lake for our fly-in to Woodland Caribou Prov Park. Most years we call in carry-out pizza at the Border bar and eat in the RV headed north. We always eat breakfast at the Lakeview Restaurant before our flight. On the way home we usually hit the McD's in Dryden and have stopped at the Sawmill in Virginia a time or two. 8 weeks and counting."
3962225,breutzy,2015-06-13 10:16:00,12,For us it is Giovannis Pizza in I-falls on Friday on the way up. Excellent Pizza.
3962233,stjoeguy,2015-06-13 10:21:00,979,"On the way up we usually have lunch in Fort Frances at La Place Rendezvous. After reading these responses, we may have to check out the Chocolate Moose or Border Bar in Int. Falls. Dinner was always at Knobby's in Sioux Lookout, but I guess this year it will be at the Wellington."
3963481,northerneyes,2015-06-13 18:54:00,72,Our route and timing take us through Superior Wi and we always stop at the Perkins for a very early a.m. Breakfast. On the way back home we usually hit it around 6 p.m. for dinner.
3963665,pjshorthorn,2015-06-13 20:12:00,5654,The Firehouse in I'Falls on Hwy 53 is also good. Cool place if you like firefighting memorabilia. On the right as you head north into town. Don't remember if you need reservations. PjShorthorn.
3963865,Nimstug,2015-06-13 21:32:00,2605,The Harborage (faulty brain) going east out of Fort Frances. One year we had breakfast there as the sun was coming up over Rainy.
3963897,Bstar,2015-06-13 21:46:00,564,I think it's called ThE SPOT now. Last couple of times not so good. It was good back in the day. We are staying at the Rendevous in Fort Frances this time. We'll try their food and bar. Hope it's Good. Go Balckhawks!
3964417,vaquero01,2015-06-14 07:53:00,101,KB drive in in Eveleth. Good pulled pork and brisket.
3965257,Warrior56215,2015-06-14 13:32:00,46,We always have breakfast at the Harbourage in Fort Frances. We cross the border early and it's open at 5 am which meets our needs. The breakfast is good and the fried breakfast potatoes are the best I've had.
3958369,btyreprich,2015-06-11 21:11:00,1067,"our group always wanted to stoop at the restaurant on HighwY 53 in Minnesota on the way to Int Falls called ""The Dam Supper Club"" We still get a laugh out of that name as we drive by. We always have lunch at the Perkins in Eau Claire, WI. Dinner used to be any place open as we'd pull into Int Falls or Fort Frances. This year we will leave crazy early so as to have dinner in Int Falls at a reasonable time. Not sure where we will eat so I lol keep watching this topic for suggestions. Final thought, the McDonalds in Int Falls on the way home is always very, very busy."
3958433,muskyman73,2015-06-11 21:45:00,402,Alices in Baudette. Just thinking about them right now gets me goin !!!!!!
3958633,rjs1230,2015-06-12 04:49:00,21,I'll second the Border bar . Good pizza and burgers .
3959185,camp chef,2015-06-12 07:50:00,915,We stop at the Dam bar on the way up for a beer and a leg stretch. We bring a chunk of Aged wisconsin Cheddar and the owner gets out the crackers.
3959305,elway12,2015-06-12 08:05:00,335,We always stop and eat at Pizza Luce in downtown Duluth.

3961033,Da' Walleye Assassun,2015-06-12 18:43:00,358,The Norske Nook in Rice Lake has the best pie I ever ate. Try the fresh peach in season.
3961057,strength22,2015-06-12 18:58:00,49,"Driving up from illinois with dad and gramps and the rest of the group we would always stop at Paul bunyans in Wisconsin dells. Nice little breakfast and great cookies and doughnuts for,the road. Much smaller group now so we don't do that anymore. I miss that. Need to do it again."
3961497,fishman10,2015-06-12 21:47:00,226,We always stop for barley soup in centerfolds strip bar in Thunder Bay. We always land a few trophys there.
3956697,Guest,2015-06-11 12:10:00,0,"On the Way up, we stop at The Husky in Dryden- it's a truck stop, but good breakfast. On the way back, it's always Sandy's in International Falls. Another small diner, but great food."
3956753,Lovetofish,2015-06-11 12:17:00,458,Sven and Ole's in Grand Marais for pizza on the way home. I have their bumper sticker on the back of my boat.
3956801,gg1187,2015-06-11 12:35:00,1,I second The Chocolate Moose @ Int'l Falls - Try the Rueben!
3956857,bkw67,2015-06-11 12:46:00,70,We went there for the first time last year (as our go-to restaurant closed down). I would recommend it.
3957513,Bassmandpe,2015-06-11 15:55:00,42,We leave Sioux Lookout at 6:30am and cross the border and stop at the Shore Lunch Cafe in International Falls for breakfast. Blueberry Pancakes are outstanding!

3957705,pjshorthorn,2015-06-11 17:08:00,5654,"If you haven't stopped in at the Border Bar in I'Falls....you are missing a classic joint. Decent bar fare for food but not great . Many a fishing story has been told or heard there. Just ask the barkeep on duty Back in the day , it has been rumored that a fishing guide or two would speak up and claim to be the ""best of the best"" no matter where your fishing destination was in Canada I'll always have a spot in my trip memories for this joint. PjShorthorn"
3957785,Blue Lk,2015-06-11 17:47:00,269,I spent about 3 days there 1 night in the 80's. A classic for sure

3957929,Nimitz,2015-06-11 18:38:00,20,We leave central Iowa at 3:00 A.M. and have lunch at the Chocolate Moose in Int'l Falls. We leave Pakwash Lake to head home at 3:30 A.M. and stop at the Moose for breakfast on the way home. Many in our group say breakfast on the way home is their favorite meal of the year.
3955489,forgop,2015-06-11 07:25:00,880,"I have always crossed in Sault Ste Marie and stopped in St Ignance for the night. Read good things about Clyde's Drive-In online and checked it out. It's an old school place (cash only) and if you're in the mood for a great burger, I recommend the Big C. Very convenient off of I-75 and may just earn a repeat visit every year."
3955521,SinOrSwim,2015-06-11 07:29:00,1528,"Somewhere along the line the A&W in Fort Frances became a stop for us on the way up. Always to go. On the way back the McDonalds in Dryden is an annual stop because we are on teh road by 6am so it fits perfectly into our schedule. Then, the last few years our other stop on the way back is Gordy's in Cloquet, MN."
3955769,tv4fish,2015-06-11 08:25:00,2694,Same for my group - we typically leave Sioux Lookout by 5:30 a.m. on Saturday. While we are in Sioux Lookout - it's the Wellington for breakfast.
3956169,Mara5,2015-06-11 10:05:00,209,The Chocolate Moose in Intl. Falls is quite good!
3956257,Draco1206,2015-06-11 10:21:00,175,We always stop at the A&W in White River on our way up to and back from Nakina. Always seems to be about the the time of the trip everyone gets hungry.
3956305,green&orange,2015-06-11 10:40:00,28,"Clyde's! The kind of place where the white bags become clear from the grease! Great place. However, when I was younger we hit that place on the way back. In those days we drank a lot more than we do now so my body was not near 100%. I took down the Big C and a large fry. I will not do that again."
3956329,LOW1,2015-06-11 10:41:00,2828,"If we leave at our usual 5:00 am or so, we will be in Cloquet MN about noon. Gordy's is a good lunch spot. For me after Cloquet the drive seems to stop being a routine trip down the interstate and instead starts becoming a trip north."
3956345,wallydave,2015-06-11 10:48:00,2151,"We usually stay in FF on Friday night on the way North, Boston Pizza for dinner, Sat am its Tim Hortons for coffee and breakfast sandwiches. We hit the A@W on the trip home in I Falls."
