3965521,larry0418,2015-06-14 15:32:00,16,"We got back last Saturday 6/6. First time we had been to Nungesser. We found the walleyes in anywhere from 8ft to 22ft. Still somewhat grouped up, but by weeks end they had started to move more to summer haunts. Started showing along shorelines and were caught off the dock (with crank bait) more by the end of the week. Minnows with a jig were best although we had no live minnows - only salted, they worked fine. Orange or green jigs were used most of the time, but don't think color really mattered once on fish. Leeches were a waste of money, but I bet they are working now along with crawlers. I do know the shinners had just started spawning during the last part of the week and were being trapped in the creek area in north bay, but we discovered that too late to give that a try, but I would bet the walleyes were there with them. I failed to get into a really big northern - a number of 34 inchers being the best. Walleyes probably averaged bigger than we have seen on other lakes with our biggest being 29 and plenty of 24-26 inchers. A 32 had been caught just before arrived. Good luck and I would appreciate an update when you get back."

3974370,bjknipp,2015-06-17 08:07:00,6,"Larry, thanks for the info. I greatly appreciate you doing that. I will post how my trip went when I get back. Leaving Friday morning, and I can't wait."

3981058,tjandy,2015-06-19 09:24:00,107,"I haven't fished Lac Seul, but have been on Nungesser several times. If you want to catch a lot of mid to upper twenties every day, you can do this on Nungesser. You can also catch a lot of fish per day. We go in August and its the best lake we have found, fly or otherwise. We have been going to Canada for 30 + years and have tried a lot of them."
3986090,Fisheroffish,2015-06-21 11:04:00,5,"We have fished Nungesser and the Ear Falls side of Lac Seul (Evergreen) four times each in the past ten years. In my experience, Nungesser is a better lake both for numbers and size of walleyes. It is also more remote, which has its pluses and minuses. Lac Seul is also a terrific lake and Evergreen is a first class lodge with awesome boats, clean cabins and helpful staff, which is why we've gone there three of the last four years and haven't been to Nungesser since 2010."
3988186,jdahl625,2015-06-22 09:34:00,6,"I just got back on the 20th from NL. Fishing was excellent. Shiners stopped spawning mid week which ment most walleyes had moved to their summer spots (humps and points). We caught a number of mid to upper 20 inch walleyes and a couple of 38"" northern's. I personally lost a monster at the boat that had to be upper 40's. A guy in the cabin down from us caught a 51"" (I guess tied the lake record) on a sucker rig in North Bay when the shiners were spawning. As usual, a lot of fish caught with multiple 100 fish days and plenty of northern's trying to eat your walleye's."
4013418,bjknipp,2015-06-30 20:26:00,6,"We got back on Friday night from Nungesser Lake Lodge. It was a great trip. The folks at NLL are top notch. Great boats and motors, clean cabins, the dock hands were friendly and always willing to help and go the extra mile. As for the fishing, is was great. During the week we caught fish anywhere from 11-27 feet deep (we mostly used slow death rigs, or crawler harnesses, but also used jigs and leeches). The biggest walleye was a 27 inches and caught on a jig and a Kalins jerk minnow. The biggest northern was 35 inches and it was caught while netting a walleye (northern had t-boned a small walleye, and we netted them both). There was still shiners around the dock and then late in the week another bait fish was in the shallows (dock hands said that is was perch). Weather was odd all week. Rain, storms, blue skies, cold, hot etc.. Typical weather in Canada."
