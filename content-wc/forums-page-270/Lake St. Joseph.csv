No live bait was available or even needed. Did all of the fishing using twister tails - and did qiite well. I cannot imagine you'll need any live bait as I think your camp or cabin is in an even. More remote section of. The lake. For shear numbers of Walleyes, this lake is hard to beat. How ever we always caught bigger Walleyes on Lac Seul. You. Are going to enjoy Lake St Joe!!!!"
3992402,IaDave,2015-06-23 12:33:00,476,Look out for rocks if this is your first time. I took out my lower unit last year but I'm sure Verne's boats will have rock guards. Great fishing and can't wait for next year. The group I went with last year is there now staying at Winoga's outpost I missed out due to a surgery. I'm sure stjoeguy will post a report when he get back.
3992410,lemon,2015-06-23 12:44:00,5,Yes have heard don't really need to use live bait which will be nice. Any particular color twisters and jigs that seemed to do well?
3992994,btyreprich,2015-06-23 16:12:00,1067,"If I could only take one color to fish, it would be chartreuse Then yellow followed by white. It has been a few years since we went to Lake St Joe so I cannot remember if a certain color out produced another shade."

3994498,Fred_G,2015-06-24 07:05:00,908,"In 18 years fishing St. Joe nothing has out produced a pink 1/4 or 3/8 oz jig with a 4"" white twister tail. Slate Falls cabins are on the south end of the lake. Don't have any experience down there but I would believe the same color combinations would be excellent."
4004506,stjoeguy,2015-06-27 23:02:00,979,"I've never been down on that end of the lake, but I know you'll have a great time. I just got back from the Winoga Lodge outpost at St. Joe about 2 hours ago. We thought fishing was ""slower"" this year than others, but it's all relative. For our group less than 30 fish per day per person is a ""slow"" day. Largest for the group was 26.25"" walleye and 42.5"" northern. The walleye was in 22' and the northern was on a jig while walleye fishing in 10'. The deeper water produced both the largest and smallest walleyes for us. Most walleyes were in the 17-19"" range and were in 4-12' of water. We caught fish anywhere from the shoreline to 25'. Our preferred technique is pitching 3/8 jigs with Gulp minnow grubs. I like orange gulp, but anything works. I've tried live, salted and frozen minnows, but have decided they are not worth the effort or cost. One guy in our group used leeches left over from the group ahead of us and caught plenty of fish. We drift or sit in one spot and pitch jigs, but Walleyeski, who goes 2 weeks ahead of us backtrolls. Fred G likes white twister tails. Bottom line is anything with a little action on a jig will work. St. Joe is very rocky, so, especially if you haven't done much of this type of fishing before, bring a lot of jigs. Our most productive spots this year were drifting a windswept sandy/rocky shoreline with jigs and trolling a river mouth with spoons. We went to the river to cast spoons for large northerns but had a ball trolling and getting one walleye after another in 4' of water. Have a great time and give us a report when you get back. I'd love to try that end of the lake some time."
4006466,Walleyeski,2015-06-28 19:01:00,40,"We also fish out of the Winoga Lodge out post. We were there June 6th thru the 13th with 9 guys. We brought in 120 dozen of live minnows and finished up another 25 or so dozen the group in front of us left. We also bring Twister Tails-(White and Chartreuse seem to work the best), Gulp Alive-(2.5, 3 and 4 inch Emerald Shiners). This year it seemed the live minnows worked best except for one day when they were hitting anything you put in the water. Colors for jigs-pink, chartreuse, green and gold are our favorites. We pretty much backtroll but have a few that will pitch jigs. As you have heard from others there are many rocks, but it's awesome place to fish! Enjoy and please give us a report when you get back."
