4000058,Hookhunter135,2015-06-25 22:01:00,129,What are some basic lures for pike and walleye that I should make sure are in my box for this trip
4001242,rsiminski,2015-06-26 10:21:00,53,"Hookhunter, I have flown into Caesars a few times since 2010. From my experiences you have absolutly nothing to worry about. Oliver runs a very good operation and he will always go the extra mile to make your trip perfect. Dont get caught up with old reports or complaints about how things were 10 years ago. At that time Oliver decided to take a break from running the buisness to start a family and his cousin bought the operation. I'm not going to go into details about it but you can read up on what happened in the past from older threads. However, Oliver took back the reighn's and is running a bunch of great out post camps. All of the cabins are updated with running water and indoor shower/toilets. Some are completely remoldeled and some are older with a more rustic feel. But they serve their purpose and you will be comfortable no matter what lake you choose. If your a diehard outdoorsy kind of group it will be perfect. Keep in mind your in the north woods alone and things do happen. Sometimes a boat leaks, mouse traps go off in the middle of the night, the toilet might break, squirls stealing your food, bears around camp...............etc, etc. So take some of the negatives with a grain of salt. I know that there are some really bad outfitters and people have legitamate negative comments about their trips but this will not be your case. My guess is that someone who has given Oliver a bad review is either just a complete A-hole who can never be satisfied or its someone who has never experienced life in the wilderness. My two favorite camps that Caesars offers is Little Benny and Larouche. Benny is a beautiful lake and the cabin is only a few years old and its really big. The fishing was good and my group caught 450 walleye there. Larouche is an older cabin but the fishing was spectacular. Lots of huge pike our largest was 45"" and the walleyes were all over. Your typical days catch could be between 50-100 fish per boat. I have never bear hunted with them but noticed numerous stands along the shore.I typically use some spoons for pike. Hot n Tots are a must up there and jig heads with twister tails tipped with a worm. Thats all you will need. You will have an awesome trip!!!!!!"
4002106,Hookhunter135,2015-06-26 18:45:00,129,Thanks for the review. I am really looking forward to the trip. I hope I can give them a great review after the trip. A lot of guys seem to have good experiences with lake Benny. I am not the one that initiated the trip so we are headed to Bob lake. If I have a goo time this trip I will be booking a little Benny trip next time.
4004170,MyDinghy,2015-06-27 20:08:00,11,"Hook, We fished Gouin 2 with Caesars last year. We had a good experience with him. The flight was excellent (on time both ways and smooth), good fishing, boats and motors worked great and the cabin was in good condition. I have experienced the opposite of all the above at other outfitters and it makes for a miserable trip. We spent about equal time jigging and trolling. We would troll to learn the lake and then jig once we found a couple good spots holding fish. The better fish came from jigging and a jig tipped with a worm out-fished a jig with a Berkley Gulp. Overall, our group had a good experience at Caesars and hope you do as well. Best Fishes, Bob"
4004658,fishron,2015-06-28 05:04:00,317,"Some lakes are good trolling lakes and it doesn't take long to find that out. If you have a good portable depthfinder it will greatly enhance your fishing and let you know when to start jigging. On some lakes just a twister tail on a jig will catch fish but in my experience adding a piece of worm or just using the jig and worm will be better. I like to use paddletails for pike. They cast well, and use a large single hook that is easy to remove. The down side is they don't last long as a pike will destroy them in short order. Stock up. Good Luck!"
4005274,Hookhunter135,2015-06-28 09:37:00,129,So far my plan is to have a base tackle box with a mix of soft plastic jigs and jig heads heads that can be rigged with a worm tip. Buck tail inline spinners and spoons and hot n tots. I will also look in to trying out the single hook paddle baits for pike. I don't have one but was looking into buyin a Humminbird 120 fish finder to take along. I'm not really sure of the make up of this particular lake if it's a rocky bottom lake or primary weed bed lake or even a mix. I also would like to know I anyone has tips on fish (pike and walleye)patterns during the mid July time.
4007082,Kartman35,2015-06-29 06:10:00,245,"Bring some bottom bouncers and spinners (crawler harnesses) for trolling. Once you find them, try and anchor over them and switch to jigs, but for finding them, it's hard to improve on the tried and true crawler harness trolled just off the bottom. Definitely spring for the fishfinder. Good luck"
3998826,Hookhunter135,2015-06-25 14:07:00,129,Hey Guys. I am going on my first Fly in Fish camp. 4 guys we are headed to Caesars Northcamps in Quebec. I am an avid Bowhunter and have been to remote outpost camps for hunting so the camping aspect is not new to me. I am new to pike and walleye fishing. We are going to be on Bob Lake which is a private lake. I wanted to see if anyone has had any experience with this outfitter or the lake we will be on. Any insight or reviews would be great. My trip is next July and I just want to be prepared. Thanks
3999114,Bayou,2015-06-25 15:37:00,52,"I've used them before on a bear hunt but don't remember which lake we was on. It was on a drive to lake that afterwards we were flown to the lodge lake where we trout fished, trolling spinners. We tagged out as everyone else I believe but they were not huge bears by any means. For a bear hunt I would go else where but to each his own. Search their name, a lot of issues in the past.Sorry just seen you will be fishing, seen bowhunter and started typing. If the deposit isn't sent, I would keep shopping."
3999130,NY Walleye,2015-06-25 15:52:00,78,"The lodge from prior years had closed. Ceasars north reopened and started fly in trips. They are a good outfitter and heard good things about them. I use air tamarac that operate out of clova as well. I would switch lakes and flt into little Benny. I fish Lac Hebert and little Benny is off the same river system. Amazing walleye and pike fishing. Worms/ leeches on a jig works best for walleye. Drift and jig or anchor and jog when you find them. Large rapalas for pike, five of diamonds and the popular daredevil. Ceasars north is a good outfitter. Tamarac is top notch."
3999194,Bassmandpe,2015-06-25 16:38:00,42,"Saw your post and did some research and found this is the same place my Dad, my self and three other guys went to almost forty years ago. It was called Caesar's Lodge then. Flight into the main Camp and it was unbelievable, all the building were done in red! Plane taxied up to dock and there was the owner, Benny standing there with a fully stocked liquor cart! He was a real character and great promoter. A real classic! After a nice lunch we flew out to his beautiful camp up north. It was done in all red too. His daughter and her husband operated the camp and she cooked and he guided us for a week. We caught plenty of Walleye and nice Pike. The husband liked to use a French spinner and a piece of crawler on it. Benny used to winter in southwest Florida and I believe worked for a car dealership in the Naples area. We kept in touch with him for several years and my Dad would see him at the Sport Shows. Sorry but don't know much about the current operation but believe one of the Sons is operating it now. But still remember, the daughter was the best looking cook we have ever run across in the Northwoods! Good Fishing!"
3999410,Hookhunter135,2015-06-25 17:59:00,129,Not sure if we would have the option to switch since we booked already. I have read mixed reviews about the place. I am not the initiator of the trip so I am trying to find out as much as I can to help give us the best trip possible. I feel as though I you are flying into a remote lake in Canada you should expect to rough it and the lakes shoul all have fish I'm sure with experience you find the ones that are better than others. I just want to catch fish and go into it with an idea of how to do it
3999474,Bayou,2015-06-25 18:39:00,52,"Hookhunter, if that's your mentality then you will have a fine trip. Just have fun fishing with good friends and all will be o.k."
3999498,Hookhunter135,2015-06-25 18:46:00,129,If anyone sees this post and has experience on the lake I'm going on or the outfitter I would love to hear it thanks
3999586,5 of Diamonds,2015-06-25 19:22:00,151,"Hookhunter135: Fished w/ Caesar's Lodge years ago and knew Owners Benny and Anita Brossard and their son Olivier. I've heard they had some issues several years ago when a nephew ran the business but haven't heard much lately (probably a positive sign!). I'm hearing Olivier is running the new operation now. I trust Olivier. If you haven't read anything lately, then I think you're good to go. Unfortunately w/ the internet, negativity perpetuates itself and these ghosts haunt outfitters indefinitely. I had fished Hanotaux, Mattawa, Little Benny and Simard during my trips there. Again, I trust Olivier and if he's involved I believe you'll have a great trip. I have posted about this in the past. You may want to use this websites 'Search' function to gather more opinions and reviews. I hope you have a great trip and look forward to your candid review. Best."
3999714,Hookhunter135,2015-06-25 19:44:00,129,Thankyou Appreciate the feedback
3999850,Jtmwalleye,2015-06-25 20:31:00,16,"Ditto on 5 of diamonds post. I have been to Ceasers several times over the years and all in all...a great experience. If you know how to fish, love the outdoors, and are humble to things that just happen, you will have fun. Oliver is a good man. HTML Code:[HTML][/HTML]"
