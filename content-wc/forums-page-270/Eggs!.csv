4009114,SpoonieLuv,2015-06-29 17:49:00,16,"Why would one need to ""change travel plans"" due an egg/poultry restriction? It's simple...don't bring eggs/poultry from the states, any state even if not on the banned list just not worth it when you can buy it up there."
4009218,michigan walleye guy,2015-06-29 18:34:00,95,The eggs we bought at the Fort Frances Walmart were all individually stamped.
4012466,billy weaver,2015-06-30 15:37:00,470,"Bought eggs at 7-11 in Dryden, $3.49 a dozen. Had a cooler with a ice pack ready, no problem. Stopped at Dutchies on 105 for our license etc. gals that run it told us any time we need groceries etc. just give them a call and they will have it when we get there."
4012538,bkw67,2015-06-30 15:54:00,70,"Because our flight time east of Atikokan is at 8:00 am. If we would have stayed in international falls as is our tradition, there would most likely not be anyplace open at 5:00am in Ft Francis.Sent from my VS980 4G using Tapatalk"
4005466,drlee,2015-06-28 11:27:00,409,"We were well aware of the ban against taking eggs from the US to Canada. What we did NOT know was that you also cannot take Canadian eggs back into the US. They made us dig out our eggs, and turn them over to an agent. They were really pleasant about it all and joked around about it with us. Later, we stopped to get gas and my son talked to a guy who was heading up to Canada and he had just found out that he could not take his eggs with him. So, my son told him that we had just had to turn over Canadian eggs at the border; so, the guy said, here, take our 3 dozen, no charge. Quite a circus!"
4005482,pjshorthorn,2015-06-28 11:32:00,5654,"Both countries have Avian Influenza issues at this time. I'm sure that is the reason that you couldn't transport eggs from Canada into the US. It is somewhat like the saying, "" running around like a chicken with their head cut off."" PjShorthorn"

4007986,Kman67rsss,2015-06-29 11:21:00,30,Is this a new ban? We haven't had issues in the past. Never even asked about them. Thanks as I'm headed to gouin reservoir Friday morning for a week.
4008234,SpoonieLuv,2015-06-29 12:18:00,16,No eggs or unprocessed chicken for the last few months. Just buy the eggs in Canada so you don't hold up the line for the rest of us! LOL
4008570,CI_Guy,2015-06-29 14:26:00,2118,"The ban has been in effect for several months and has been well publicized in MN where I live and has been discussed several times here on WC. I don't know what state you are from, but here is the last list of states I've seen:Restriction on imports from US States affected by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)Updated May 12, 2015Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) has been discovered in the USA, most recently in Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and Wisconsin. The CFIA advisory to travellers has been updated to reflect this information.The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has implemented measures to protect Canada's poultry resources from an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza reported in poultry in the following states: Arkansas California Idaho Indiana Iowa Kansas Minnesota Missouri Montana Nebraska North Dakota Oregon South Dakota Washington WisconsinTravellers should know that, due to this outbreak, all raw poultry and all poultry products and by-products that are not fully cooked, including eggs and raw pet foods, sourced, processed, or packaged from the above states are under restriction until further notice. You may not bring these items into Canada.These measures are a normal part of Canada's animal disease control efforts and are consistent with international guidelines on trade.Examples of restricted items include: live birds and hatching eggs eggs, yolks, egg whites (albumen) poultry meat (other than fully cooked, canned, commercially sterile meat products) raw pet foods containing poultry products feathers poultry manure and litter laboratory material containing poultry products/by-productsCommercial imports are restricted from the specific quarantine zones within these states until further notice. Live pet birds may be brought into Canada with official certification from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Contact the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) for more information on the restricted areas.Commercial importers should refer to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's Automated Import Reference System (AIRS) for more information on restricted products.There is no food safety risk associated with these products. These measures are being taken to prevent the introduction of avian influenza into other parts of Canada."
4008666,Kman67rsss,2015-06-29 14:59:00,30,I'm from NH. It's not on the list. I guess we will see what happens.
4008706,bkw67,2015-06-29 15:09:00,70,"I'm in Illinois and not on the list either. But since the eggs around here are not stamped with ""layed and packaged in Illinois"", I'm buying in Canada.Sent from my VS980 4G using Tapatalk"
4008930,Seanik,2015-06-29 16:35:00,218,"All you need is a receipt showing eggs were purchased in a non-restricted state, anybody knows eggs are not individually stamped. Seanik"
