562399,Guest,2006-12-21 11:53:00,0,"There isn't much more detail to give....the burnt rubble hasn't been moved anywhere yet, if that's what you mean. Nobody has been charged or further implicated at this point, though I wouldn't know of any OPP progress made in the last couple weeks. There is only a couple people that could reasonably be suspected of having done this, or at least been the mastermind and had somebody else actually do the work. If those people with possible motive check out, the question of WHO will probably not be solved. As I mentioned in my other post on this topic (in another thread), the level of effort and risk associated with doing this (getting there, lighting at least 8-10 separate fires, getting back out of there) rules out the possibility of this being a random act of violence. It was premeditated, and would have required significant effort to pull off. The lodge had been financially struggling for a few years, new owners and operators 3 years ago, those operators stayed two seasons and then left, and new operators took over this past season. I can verify the NEW operators have been ruled out as suspects. At this time, there are no definitive plans on the future, though operation in 2007 appears highly doubtful. NWO Fishing Bum"
