In the past we have either hit it big at this time of year or we had a hard time catching anything. It seems to be no in between. By my experience if the weather is warm we usually do really good and if it is cold it gets tough. Last year we tried mid-late June and we had steady-consistent fishing everday, but not that many big ones. So we are going to hit the opener and hope for the best. No matter how the fishing is it is always a great trip."
562300,grt1,2006-12-13 11:36:00,259,just recently our local newspaper ran an article that said the MNR was having problems getting the 2007 regulations printed and the public should use the 2006 guide that is already in the field as the official rules for the start of the 2007 season. That would make the opening day the 3rd saturday in May.
562301,Guest,2006-12-13 11:44:00,0,"It depends where in Ontario...in some areas along the great Lakes in Southern Ontario (Bay of Quinte for example), it's first Saturday in May. Much of the rest of southern and central Ontario is second Saturday in May. Northwestern Ontario and much of Northeastern Ontario is third week. What you describe is the typical trade-off for spring walleye fishing. Walleye activity in the spring (spawn-post-spawn) is very dependent on water temperature, and the fish are shallow making them even more cognizant than normal of weather shifts. A walleye-opener cold front can severely drop surface temperatures which have been slowly rising, shutting things down for a few days. Whereas if walleye opener comes in the middle of the long, spring, warm, high pressure system, things should be hot. Such weather differences and associated effects occur later in the year as well, but the entire system has warmer water temperatures and the fish are deeper anyway, where the temperature is more consistent. So you're less likely to have the fishing extremes you get at opener. NWO Fishing Bum"

That spring weather can really change, about 6 years ago we got into camp and over night the lakes got a thin layer of ice on it in the bays but it would melt as soon as the sun hit it and by the end of the week it was 75 degrees. That really turned the fish on, we had a couple of walleyes on a stringer for lunch and it got to the point where we couldn't hang it off the boat because the northerns were attacking them constantly. About every 5th fish would get attacked reeling it in also. It was a feeding frenzy that I will remember forever."
