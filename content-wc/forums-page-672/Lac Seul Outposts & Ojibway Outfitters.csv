561889,Guest,2006-11-04 17:21:00,0,"I have read the posts in the past about these owners being rude. I was wondering who has been there in the past two years, what the camp is like (cabins, boats etc) and more importantly, how is the fishing. They book up fast, and charge a lot, so they must be doing something right. How far do you have to travel in July from camp? At the end of a week, how much will I be paying for gas as this is about the only resort where 5 or 6 gallons a day are not included. If you have been there, was it worth the extra money?"
561890,Great Sirmanski,2006-11-04 18:13:00,1,"Been there, not worth the extra money in my opinion. Lots of great resorts on Lac Seul that you will get better service at and catch as many fish."
561891,2 DOGS,2006-11-04 18:16:00,361,"The resort where I stay on Lac Seul was charging $1.10 a liter ($4.10 gal)last year. Who can predict what your lodge owner will have to charge 9 months from now, and only you can say how far you'll drive your boat. My guess would be you'd burn between 5-10 gals. a day, well, you do the math."
561905,Guest,2006-11-06 15:57:00,0,"<<<<I was wondering who has been there in the past two years, what the camp is like (cabins, boats etc) and more importantly, how is the fishing. >>>>>> The camp is consists of ""regular cabins"" and ""VIP"" cabins. The regular cabins are what we stay in (we're cheap). They are about as barebone as they come; bunks, sink with only cold water, small fireplace, very old stove, and an outhouse. We have stayed in the VIP cabins too, which are more modern with a bathroom, shower, and nicer bunks. The boats are also basic. They are small bench seat Lunds with a 25 horse Merc. The fishing is good to excellent, but in July to get to the best fishing you are looking at 12-16 miles one way for the very best fishing. Many will tell you you can catch fish right next to camp, even off the dock, but the best fishing is a quite a bit further. You mentioned that they must be doing something right because they book fast. The only thing that separates Ojibway from the other lac seul outfitters is that they are located in lac seul's muskie country, which is the only reason we put up with their unbelievably rude owner, (even though we fish walleye 90% of the time). Muskie fisherman make up a decent number of the guests. The muskie in NE lac seul are HUGE, but few and far between."
561908,tly,2006-11-06 20:34:00,1900,"There is not much reason to travel far in July (or any other time). If you are for muskies tho Andersons has a camp further north (Pickeral Narrows(?)) that is very good (we flew in & there were several folks with 50""+ pics and extremely happy) Ken & Brenda are still Ken & Brenda and could take some PR training but as opposed to most other sites we visit they are no worse than others (""there are 250m americans so I don't care if I **** off a few""-direct quote from houseboat service in Hudson), or owners/operators at Ear Falls being too drunk to give us gas in AM. Previous posts describe cabins pretty well. VIP is pretty good, have not had low end. I have dealt with them since early 1980's with no serious problem. In fact this year the trip started bad (the final trip of the Hunley) but they pulled us out (see a previous post for details). Ken & gang salvaged the trip. Our only reservation this year is the x hour delay at the border."
561919,Mike Kansas,2006-11-07 14:58:00,1463,"Two couples of us were there for a week in July in 2005. We did OK fishing Walleye (600+ for week) and did catch one Walleye over 30"". We did not do any Muskie fishing but several Muskie were caught the week we were there by other parties. The Cabin we stayed in was adequate and the boat and motor combination was OK except the motors were of an older vintage and without electric start. That may be updated know. We had an enjoyable trip and it is a beautiful section of Lac Seul. The owners were helpful and we had no problems with the service. Overall I would rate the Resort at a 7 out of 10 and would recommend it to others. We have stayed at 5 other Resorts on Lac Seul only because we like to move around. I would rate the other four we have stayed at above Lac Seul Outposts because of the motor issue and the other Resorts we have been at have nicer cabins while the fishing for Walleye is excellent all over Lac Seul. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
561928,Guest,2006-11-08 18:10:00,0,"Mike Kansas, What other resorts have you stayed at on Lac Seul? We might be up for a change this year. Do you have a favorite? I was always worried that if we stayed on the western portion of lac seul we would end up seeing a lot more boats than we'd like. Is this true? or is the ""boat density"" about the same all over? Thanks"
561933,Guest,2006-11-09 19:11:00,0,"We have been going there for about 10 years now and will continue to go back. I can understand some people having reservations about the owners, they can be a bit rough around the edges. But I am willing to bet most of that came from people who have only been there once, Ken and Brenda definitely cater to their repeat customers. Like that or not they still fill the camp every year, mostly because they have a ton of repeat business. The reason our group will keep going back is that you get the remoteness of a fly-in without the restrictions, for example there are no weight restrictions, bait shop right in camp, good boats (new 16' lunds with pedestal seats), good cabins (VIP), extra food and supplies can be brought in from town daily, etc... Not to mention you are fishing what is probably the best walleye lake in North America and the Northeast section offers a chance at a huge muskie. There is not another camp on Lac Seul that offers all of that. Thus supply and demand would dicate that it would be more expensive and don't forget they have to boat everything 80 miles round trip that is a lot of gas, boat motors don't get 20-30 mpg like a car. If you don't want to be in a remote setting then there are probably better places to stay that will offer the same walleye fishing. If I am going to travel 1500 miles to fish in Canada I want the lake pretty much to myself."

All of these are excellent places to stay and being on lac Seul they all have great fishing. The owners of each are very accomadating and work hard to make sure your trip is enjoyable. Lac Seul lodge and Evergreen are located on the west shore with LS Lodge being about 15 miles south of Ear Falls and Evergreen being just outside of Ear Falls. A group of us go to LS Lodge every June and stay at one of Dan's Outpost Camps. We have been going there for about 16 years. Both of his Outposts are normally booked up every year with repeat customers but it is worth contacting him and seeing if he has any availability. LS Lodge and Evergreen both have great facilitys and when staying at their camps they will put you on fish. Lost Island Lodge and SWWL are both on the south/central portion of LS and offer great fishing. Both of them also have a lot of repeat customer business and you can't go wrong with either one. Lac Seul is an awesome fishery and I really believe that any Resort on the lake can and will put you on good fishing. I think the most important item to consider when picking a Resort on LS is customer service because the fish are every where.These four Resorts would all be excellent choices. Our June group is returning to Lac Seul Lodge and the Outpost Camp (Black Bay)and four couples of us are returning to Lost Island next July. I don't have a favorite...LOVE THEM ALL. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
561937,HookedEye,2006-11-10 18:10:00,1,"Duh, We have been to Chamberlain approx 10 times. We have also fished the Senn Bay area, and the Grassy Bay region. Obviously since we have been to Chamberlain 10x we are very happy with the fishing. However, the last 2 trips we stayed a few extra days in town and put in at Deception and made the trip to Senn. The fishing in Senn has been just as good as the Chamberlain (Ojibway Outfitters) area. From others posts I am getting the impression it is like that pretty much all over lac seul. One of the posters mentioned that there is great fishing around camp in July. He is certainly right about that, but I would disagree about there not being a reason to go far from camp. Anyone who has been on Wapesi when it's really going would tell you that a 12-15 mile boat ride can get you to some even more amazing waters. Some might not call that far, but I do."
561940,Guest,2006-11-11 17:25:00,0,"We were there two years ago. Fishing was ok. Not great. The water level was all screwed up and we did talk to some guys who flew in to an outpost and they were struggling and told us the fishing was usually better. So I can not judge the fishing. As to the host/hostess, not one of my party will go back. One of our guys got yelled at ( way too heated ) for grabbing a bag of ice out of a freezer on the porch of a VIP cabin. It was an honest mistake and a quick little explanation would have been acceptable. The regular cabins are basic but we are not fancy guys so that was not an issue. The unequal treatment of the VIP and regular guys was noted more than once. The night before we were to go home we got our bill and divvied up the cost. One guy was showered and did not want to go for the last shot and volunteered to go pay the bill. Brenda made a mistake on the bill and got all hissy and pissy when he explained it was her mistake and not ours. My buddy said he would collect the extra money and bring it to her when the rest of us got back from fishing. That was unacceptable to her. She stated that she was not on call 24 hours a day and that he had to come up with the money immediately. He said he did not have enough to pay it and would bring it up when we came back. She did not like it at all, but, after a couple of more exchanges agreed to be gracious enough to accept our money and allow us to correct her mistake."
561942,Guest,2006-11-11 20:12:00,0,"We were once at Ojibway and brought all of our own gas. We did not buy any from camp. When we got our bill, there was a huge gas bill on it. Turns out we weren't the only Smiths in this world, but the other Smith party had already departed. Brenda's solution was to only charge us for half of the gas that we didn't use and was very upset that we didn't like her ""discount."" Unbelievable."
561950,Guest,2006-11-13 12:35:00,0,"We went to Ojibway for 6-7 years running with 12 guys (approx. $7000.00). Fishing was always great. But it was not so good that we were willing to pay $120.00 US a night for a bunk with no linen, able to park on the beach (no dock space), have someone count my minnows one at a time, the joy of dealing with the drop off/pick up at the dock (what a mess) and be treated like a pile of crap. Too many other good places."

562040,Guest,2006-11-24 11:24:00,0,"There are better places to stay by far as it relates to customer servcie and accomodations. It is real shame that business must be so good that Ken and Brenda can treat people the way they do and still keep their cabins full. Mahkwa Lodge has much better accomodations, outstanding food and good boat docks. I very much miss the great walleye fishing off the dock at Lac Seul outposts and the ability to fish walleye in Chamberlain Narrows when the rest of the lake is suffering from bad weather conditions, but the treatment at Lac Seul Outpost is just not over all worth it. Just one of many examples I can cite, is that I paid the parking fee for the boat landing (when there was one) at the Ojibway Office. When I told Brenda that at check out time she said she could not accept my word, so she billed me for the parking (paid twice). NE Piker"

562153,Guest,2006-11-30 13:40:00,0,"I have been watching this trail and just wanted to chime in, not disputing any of the other posts/comments but from my view: We were last there the week of Sept. 11th 2001. Upon returning back to the dock that Tuesday evening at about 7PM Ken met us with the bad news about the events in the USA. He was surely as upset as any of us were. He had his cell phone set up with an elevated antenna and urged all of us to use it to call our families to see that they were OK and offer our support. Each day he made a point of bringing in a paper so we could catch up on events. I have been to their place four or five times over the years and would go back. All I really want from a place is a place to sleep and tie up the boat. The beaching of the boat vs docking I actually like since your boat doesn't get beat up if there's a big wind storm. Just my 2 cents worth. Paul"
562160,Guest,2006-11-30 22:49:00,0,"In my experience, Ken and Brenda will bend over backwards to those in a large party, especially in VIP (ie big spenders), but other than that you will be treated like crap. I have seen this time and time again. We have gone there more than 10 times and have not once in all 10 years been asked how the fishing was when we came in for the day. (We are usually a party of 2-3). Why come back then? Good fishing and we are simple people who really only want a roof, dock, and a place to buy gas."
562184,Guest,2006-12-03 16:47:00,0,"It's nice to see that there is a mixed bag of thought with this Outfitter. My personal opinion is that i will never go back. They have a tendency to be a little ""Rip offish"" and there is alot of water on Lac Seul that the fishing is as good if not better and the service is better at 90% of the resorts. Granted their operation costs may be higher because of the long transporation issue but it doesent justify the customer gouging at the rate they do it."
562199,eyeman_1,2006-12-04 20:40:00,690,"It has been 10 years since I went to this camp, and I'm not in any hurry to go back. We had some interesting things happen when we went and the story is long. Suffice it to say, I still haven't gotten the outboard oil completly out of my musky box, I'll never get over the fact Brenda told me that we owed her for some bait we never got, and the lodging was, well, like Stallag 13. Our so called cabin, had a gap of about 2"" under the front door so we had more mice than mosquitos inside the cabin. We couldn't leave any food open anywhere or out of storage conatiner. Our clothes duffels had to stay zipped all the time, and one guy had a mouse run across his forehead one night when the lights went out. Oh yeah, and there was a teepee set up where some of the camp staff sent up smoke signals for the late Bob Marlee daily. Trying to find someone in camp to get us anything when we needed it was a chore. The outboard oil got poured into my musky box because the guy doing the fill-up had been to the teepee for awhile. The Fishing Hot Spots guys were in camp that week so we moved to the back of the rack for service. I thought all of us paid in the same currency, therefore, service should be equal....guess not? I'll go back to Lac Seul but I'm staying else where. There are better places to stay in that area, and if the cost is a few bucks more or less....well I think I can't do worse for customer service and I'll get a little better treatment from the owners. Just my$.02."
562204,Guest,2006-12-05 11:29:00,0,My experience with this camp tells me that anyone considering going there needs to find a different camp to go to on Lac Seul. Lac Seul is a great Walleye Fishery and has many quality camps on it that you will do just as well fishing and have MUCH BETTER SERVICE.
562159,Guest,2006-11-30 22:37:00,0,"I would have to agree with Paul. Our party has been going up there for years and will continue to go back as long as Ken and Brenda own the place. Through all of the years that our group has been going to Chamberlain Narrows we have been treated excellent by everyone. For example in 2003 my Grandmother was in the final stages of her fight with cancer, before we left camp that year Ken and Brenda heard about it and hold a friend of our families, that was on the trip to let them know if she passed so that they could come to the wake in New York. A couple months later my Grandmother died, since they were still in the middle of the fishing season they were not able to make it to the wake, however they had delivered a huge display of flowers and made a donation to the cancer center in her name. All of that for someone they had never met before. Our first year in camp one of our guys got a hook in his finger (funny story) and since it would take to long by boat Ken had a seaplane fly into camp to take him to the hosiptal and then bring him back to camp 2 hours later. Two years ago the same guy fell on to a hot frying pan and burned his side and elbow pretty good. Brenda happened to be at the shore lunch and took care of cleaning and patching his burns. I can think of at least 20 more examples like the ones above that Ken and Brenda went above and beyond to make sure our group had a great trip and to show that they cared more about us than our money. Let me tell you I have fished in many places from Alaska to the Bahamas and I have never been treated better than we are by Ken, Brenda and their staff."
561935,Guest,2006-11-10 14:35:00,0,"Hooked Eye, You are right the west side does have more boat traffic however there is more boat traffic all over Lac Seul. Where have you stayed at on Lac Seul? I assume you have been there since I read in another post from you that you hadn't got a 30"" Walleye on Lac Seul yet."
