I used to pull my lund IO up to lake of the woods from chicago without tooo much of a problem, it seemed to be mostly flat. from vegas to saschawan i am not so sure. I onl have a ford explorer v8. it seems like it would be moutains all the way. thanks alan"
562330,Guest,2006-12-16 23:20:00,0,I would head east toward Denver and get on the east side of the Rockies and from there go straight north (probably on US 85).
562331,Larry L,2006-12-17 00:56:00,335,"Alan Once you get into Montana, it is mostly downhill to Sask. I think most of Sask is under 2,000 feet elevation. If you are considering a run through Denver I would use I-25 to Billings. Then it depends what part of Sask you are going to. I-15 is not all that bad either. Whichever way you go you will have to climb to at least 6,000 feet somewhere. Let me know where you are headed and I will tell what I can of the roads. We have done both fly ins and drive ins to Sask. Towing was never any problem. Good luck Larry"
562342,Guest,2006-12-17 18:35:00,0,thanks. we will be going to tobin lake. from here its aboutr 1700 miles. i am thinking this first time we will leave the boat home and see how the roads are. it will be 2 longs days the way it is and the boat will slow us up. it weighs about 3500 pounds. i figure to rent the boat will cost about what its cost to pull ours up.
562346,Larry L,2006-12-17 22:45:00,335,"Alan I have made most of that trip at one time or another. I think I would follow I-15 to Salt Lake City and then take I-80 east to Rawlins, Wyoming. Take 220 north to Casper and then I-25 to Billings, Montana. At Billings head east on I-94 to Glendive. Then take 16 north through Plentywood to Canada. That will take you through the port of Raymond/Regway. This is a 24 hour port and they have always been pleasant to deal with. Once you are in Canada it becomes hwy 6. Going through Regina was not a problem my last time through. There is a bypass to the east side that is much better than the old way through the city. Just keep on hwy 6 north to Melfort and you will be very close to Tobin. I have not been on hwy 6 for a long time. Others on this board travel to Tobin often and can tell what it is like. Overall, you will have ups and downs on the Interstates. But there are not really any serious mountain ranges to climb. The pull up I-80 east of Salt Lake City into Wyoming may be the steepest. But it is not much worse than I-15 east of Los Vegas crossing Arizona into Utah. It would be a very long two days. If that is what you are planning, Casper, Wyoming or Billings, Montana are somwhere in the middle, Buffalo and Sheridan, Wyoming are probably your only other two motel options in between them. Gas and food are available in some of the other small towns. Have a good trip and keep the shiny side up.:)"

Once you hit Melfort, best to head east on Highway #3 to Tisdale, its about 25 miles, and at Tisdale you swing back north to Nipawin on Highway #35, its about 35 miles or so from Tisdale to Nipawin. I live in Melfort. Highways are fine all the way to Nipawin (or at least as good as they get in Sask!)"
