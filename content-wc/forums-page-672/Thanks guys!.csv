Our group decided to book Sumach Lake with Excellent Adventures out of Ear Falls. The chance for multiple species on a fly-in lake was too much for us to resist. Hopefully it will be a great trip. Its always tough to change outfitters when you've had nothing but great experiences (thanks Mattice Lake for great fishing, we'll be back), but it seems like this place has a good reputation."
