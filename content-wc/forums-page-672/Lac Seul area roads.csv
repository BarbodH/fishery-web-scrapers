Since my son is going to be running cross county for our local college, he needs to put in about 6+ miles a day during the week we are up there. How are the roads in that area? Are the dirt roads rutted out, or do the paved roads have any type of shoulder to run on?"
562357,Guest,2006-12-18 13:57:00,0,"There are paved roads right outside of Evergreen that he can run on. Last year, one of the guys in my party was training for the Chicago Marathon and did not want to take a whole week of running so he ran 3 times in the week. His only complaint was that it was a little hilly and he could not run the 15 miles, and had to stop at about 12. We mapped it out from Evergreen to 4 Seasons and he ran back and forth a few times. We almost felt bad drinking beer and smoking cigars while he ran."

And you can run further up the road, either southeast around the north side of Lac Seul, or northeast toward Canada North, South Bay and other lodges. You could go either direction for well over 50 miles. NWO Fishing Bum"

562365,dave10,2006-12-19 10:50:00,342,My son ran on the dirt roads around Evergreen last July and had no problems. Dave

562377,tjsker,2006-12-19 17:25:00,301,"My son trains on dirt roads most of the time anyway, since he's from rural Nebraska."
