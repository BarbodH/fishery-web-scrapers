510985,Guest,2001-02-08 07:07:00,0,"It is mostly a Lake Trout lake. Walleyes are pretty scarce. Very clear and cold water. If you have your heart set on Walleyes you will be disapointed. Maybe some long boat rides will put you on Walleyes. We do like the lake, we stayed at SAC Bay camp and it is a good a camp with above average cabins. I'd return if Lake Trout was what I was looking for. Bring your own boat though...Pooch in Central Illinois"
510986,Guest,2001-02-10 13:06:00,0,"I have stayed on Sturgeon many times over the last few years. If you spend some serious time and have good gear for trout you can get some real nice ones. The lake is very big and deep. If you have much wind it gets very treacherous in the Sac Bay area. Some of the adjoining areas like Jackpot, Mountain Island Bay, and Granite Bay are good for big Pike. We caught a 21lb Pike in Jackpot last year. Unfortunately that was about our only success. Bad weather kept us off of the lake for about 5 of the seven days we were there. The big ones definetly are there but you have to work for them. If you go to Sac Bay and stay there, make sure ahead of time that the cabin you will get has working heat and the docks have been fixed. Last year we had no heat most of the time and there was only room for about 3 boats on the dock, so if you were not one of the first to get back you had to trailer your boat each night or risk the waves beating it up. I have seen a lot of people come back in the evening with lots of good walleyes caught at lakes in that area but most of them would not tell where they caught them.(jerks)."
562217,Guest,2006-12-05 19:52:00,0,"well we went to sturgeon lake for the first time in late june 2006.. we stayed at the far northwest corner of the lake... deep and clear water for the most part, there are no GOOD maps of the lake so be very careful the first FEW times.... GPS is a must to be safe there....we had great walleye fishing but we went 25 miles to get most of them,, try the squaw lake spillway area.... small eaters like 12-15 inchers... but i caught a alot of 18-22 inchers in the deep water humps or running around rock piles... i caught a 8+ pounder{28in} which was released... the fish are very dark colored almost black!!! but all very fat!!!! caught most on crawlers and leaches, but minnows worked too {i was always trolling }... the lake IS a lake trout lake BUT if you just keep at it and hit the ""walleye looking spots"" a.k.a good looking points - around underwater humps and surface rockpiles... you will catch nice walleyes ..... JUST KEEP AT IT!!!!..oh yeah one more thing if you have no wind and high sky forget it.... from about 10am till 5pm they won't bite period!!! to clear of water in those conditions, which are not good on most lakes anywhere .... so you want walleye at sturgeon lake try the north end of the lake and keep at it!!!!! good luck and WATCH FOR ROCKS they are not marked on the maps at all....... i'm use to Lake Of the Woods where everything is marked....."
562218,Catman59,2006-12-06 06:31:00,345,". We have been going there for 6 years. Get a good camp and they will find you Walleyes....Last year was a little tougher. When that happens go to a local Cache lake and catch your 100 Walleyes for the day !!! There are a LOT of rocks in places that you wouldnt expect , so yes be careful. Its a good Pike lake , we averaged 50-70 a day on the days we targetted them , and they are everywhere it seems. The trout was outstanding ,--- so good , it kind of gets to you as they are like catching a Smallie on steroids. What a fight on a jig !!!!"
562227,guidedfishing,2006-12-06 20:17:00,531,"Have Stayed at Cobb Bay in the fall for the last 5 years. Jamie and Sheri are great hosts. If you need specific Info let me know, I am very famailiar with cobb bay the southern part of the lake and to a lesser extent the Northern part up by whisky jack and white sands. I've fished this area for over 25 years. Ignace to north of Savant lake. If you are going to fish Sturgeon for walleyes you will probably be disappointed Cobb Bay and the stained water bay north by White Sands along with the North East arm will hold decent walleyes at times. (ie. you can catch your limit in these area's if you work at it and at times do better on walleyes) You will catch eyes! If you are use to fishing the lakes around Sturgeon for eye's you will be disappointed in numbers, Sturgeon is NOT a walleye factory. If you can get on them it will hold some good numbers of Lake Trout but my experience is they tend to run somewhat smaller than some of the outlakes as well. The lake is beautiful like most Canadian Shield lakes, The main lake is BIG, and you can get in trouble in a hurry if the wind comes up. In my opinion the stained water bays see a fair amount of pressure. The Northeast arm and the main lake very little pressure. If you have specific questions about Cobb Bay or the South end of Sturgeon I can try and help. I you plan to go and pound walleyes you will be disappointed. This is why these fish camps have boats cached on near by lakes so their clients can get into some eyes. good luck GF"
562239,joro2548,2006-12-07 20:12:00,14,"muskyhead, I have fished Sturgeon for about 30 years in both spring and fall. GF is correct that it is basically not a walleye lake especially in the fall. The spring can be very good though in the dark water bays and any time of day. I have only fished the north and northeast arms. The lake is FULL of rocks and definitely in places not expected. I have taken out at least three lower units in areas I thought I knew. The thing I like about Sturgeon is that you can get lakers, eyes and northerns all in one lake. The lakers will be up until mid to late June depending on water temp and will usually come up sometime the last week of Sept. IF you don't have down riggers, you can usually jig them in the deep holes and do pretty good. Crossing the main lake in the fall especially can be very nasty when the cold strong NW winds blow as they seem to quite often. Also if you drive the small roads in the fall there are a lot of grouse. Good Success"
562278,Guest,2006-12-11 21:29:00,0,"We have fished Sturgeon every May for the last 20 years and we always stay at Harris Bay Resort, nice cabins and nice people. We usually get all of our walleyes from Cobb bay, we usually don't get nothing real big maybe a 5 or 6 pounder every year. A few years back in a bay half way up the lake our group caught and released 3 walleyes over 10 pounds in one morning. But the weather plays a big part, when sunny the walleye can be really tough. From what I hear the walleye fishing gets better a little later on in the year when the water warms up, because sometimes we have been up there with some ice still on the lake or the ice has been off only a week or two. We always go early so we can fish lake trout in the shallower water, usually nothing real big, the biggest over the years is 18 pounds, but the average is about 4-6 pounds. We also have good northern fishing right after the ice goes out, usually get quite a few in the 10-15 pound range, and we had 2 at 23 pounds over the years. The is also good lakes in the area for walleyes like Witcomb, Flying Loon and Jackpot which is connected by a creek to Surgeon and can be reached with a smaller boat or if the water is high. We also did really good on walleyes on Young Lake, which is catch and release only. Can't wait till May!"
