562181,scar,2006-12-03 10:14:00,196,last year was my first year fishing on lac seul. we would put in at deception and then have an hour boat ride to fish just past bear narrows near 3 sisters reef and ski doo point etc. we pass a lot of water on the way and see few boats. would anyone be willing to share some spots closer to deception or not as far away as bear narrows as some days wind or storm warnings prevent us from going that far. scar
562277,scar,2006-12-11 21:18:00,196,if this helps..... the deception bay landing is east of hudson about 7 or 8 miles. usually lots of vehicles parked at landing but we seldom see many boats. anyone? scar
562288,Guest,2006-12-12 15:51:00,0,The Deception Bay boat landing is 9 miles east of Sioux Lookout on the highway that goes past the airport. From the boat landing to Bear Narrows took me an hour and a half with the old boat. I haven't tried it yet since I moved up to something a little faster.
562290,Guest,2006-12-12 18:50:00,0,"Scar, Have fished out of deception many times. You are definitely going over some good water. A few miles south of bear narrows is excellent water. You can also go from deception landing to Senn Bay, which is a good boat ride but much smaller water, great fishing, which makes it a good primary spot or back up if the wind really blows. It's better towards the middle and later season. Grassy bay has good fishing as well. If you have a map you can find these spots, if not I can try and explain where they are. Deception bay itself actually has some pretty good areas. I talked to a local who uses a 4.5 hp motor to fish deception, and he says his 'milk run' in deception produces many 100+ fish days."

562293,scar,2006-12-12 19:52:00,196,my mistake-the deception landing is east of sioux lookout as stringbean mentioned. i have fished lost lake from the hudson landing but the lost lake area isn't any better from my experience than minitakki which is the lake i normally fish.bear/chamberlin are some of the best eye fishing i have had. most people that head up towards bear narrows/chamberlin narrows seam to use the deception landing although you can get there from the hudson landing. i have the navonics chip and it's an hour ride for me(115 optimax) but quite easy to follow as the chip has a trail burned right on the map for you to follow. just seam to go by a lot of water on the way up that way and seldom see anyone fishing until we get all the way up. still hoping someone might share a couple spots to try on the way. i know where grassy bay and senn bay are but those are big areas and am hoping to get something a little more specific-don't expect exact spots but near ?island or big flats near ?point would help. i have all 4 maps. thanks! don i can trade some spots on minitakki if you'd like. scar
