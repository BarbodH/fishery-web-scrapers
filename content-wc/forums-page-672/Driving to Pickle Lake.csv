562280,guidedfishing,2006-12-11 22:09:00,531,"eyesore, I know what you meant, Not Lake Michigan, Superior. The North shore of Superior is a beautiful drive. (added benefit) good luck GF"
562281,Eyesore,2006-12-11 22:29:00,455,"WHOOPS, yeah hey thanks for correcting me, LOL. Geeze I cant believe I mistakenly posted Lake Michigan for Lake Superior. And yes, 'tiss is very beautiful drive."
562283,jigman 2003,2006-12-12 08:37:00,981,"Yep, the drive along the lake is great. I've been going that way for the last 6 years or so and definitely like it better than going thru Fort Frances. Now that I'm not going to Armstrong or Pickle Lake I'm going to have to go thru Ft. Frances or Rainy River. Anybody got some input on those choices?"
562329,2746,2006-12-16 18:20:00,3206,"Jigman, we often cross at Baudette on our way back from Ear Falls. Our experience is that it adds about an hour to our travel time to get back to the Twin Cities. Don't know what that would mean to you in Wisconsin. There has never been more than a 15-20 minute wait there and we have encountered up to two hours at Internationl Falls. The wait time at I.F. is usually worse on the way back which is why we choose Baudette. Besides, it's a nice change in scenery."
562221,jigman 2003,2006-12-06 12:46:00,981,"Looking for someone who makes the drive to Pickle Lake. I'm wondering what the roads are for the last couple hundred miles. A time estimate from Duluth, Thunder Bay, Fort Frances, or Dryden would be appreciated also. Finally, anybody who's used either Pickle Lake Outfitters or Albany River Outfitters out of Pickle Lake could post their impressions. Thanks"
562224,Lovetofish,2006-12-06 17:29:00,458,"I've been as far as St. Joe. Hwy 599 is OK. There are a few rough stretches where you need to be careful, especially if you are pulling a boat. It's a good 6 hour drive from Thunderbay. I prefer 599 from Ignace vs. 516 from Sioux Lookout. I also prefer the border crossing at Pigeon River. Just my opinion."
562225,Fred_G,2006-12-06 17:31:00,908,"I can't help you with the outfitters, but I've driven the road to Pickle Lake for the last 10 years. The road is black top like most other Ontario roads. It's a bit curvy in spots but 60 mph is very doable. The time from Fort Francis is about 6 hours, from Dryden about 4 hours. Hope this helps!"
562226,guidedfishing,2006-12-06 19:59:00,531,"This last fall they had put 40 miles of fresh crushed granite on oil, between Silver dollar and Savant Lake. Just my luck of the draw managed to take most of the paint of the trailer, paint off the sides of the boat, Ouch. This is a re-occuring event never know when you will hit it. Just need to remember the gravel guard... It is a 55 to 60 mph road, I believe the speed limit is actually less than that 80kph. It is all black top but has some rough spots as stated. good luck GF"
562230,jigman 2003,2006-12-07 07:52:00,981,Thanks for the replies guys! Much appreciated.
562235,lenray,2006-12-07 10:35:00,467,It is a decent road. Always enjoy driving it. The 150 miles of gravel north of Pickle Lake is a very good road--better than any county road here in Michigan. Thanks for bringing up good memories about that wonderful drive can't wait to make it again.
562253,phishfearme,2006-12-08 12:47:00,1242,jigman - i think all the driving info provided so far is accurate but let me STRONGLY suggest you enter canada thru the pidgeon river port of entry. it's MUCH easier than international falls and actually a shorter drive to pickle. don't forget the rt 130 cutoff south of thunder bay which allows you to bypass the downtown area - unless you want to go thru town. phish
562257,jigman 2003,2006-12-08 13:33:00,981,"Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. A little longer mileage wise, but I'm sure shorter time wise. On another note: Anybody ever go to Ear Falls via the Rainy River/Baudette crossing instead of the Fort Frances crossing? We'd be coming from southern WI. Again, it's farther mileage wise, but I'm betting it's quicker time wise."
562259,guidedfishing,2006-12-08 19:11:00,531,"100% agree with Phish, also the river road is now paved on the 130 cutoff, very nice and about time. GF"
562273,Eyesore,2006-12-11 13:12:00,455,"From Duluth, I've gone both ways - thru Ft Francis, and Pigeon falls. I would reccomend P falls, as it is basicaly the same milage, but less traffic, better roads, and no $10 bridge toll. The view of lake Michigan is very nice too. Or, go thru P falls on the way up, then thru Ft Francis on the way back (no toll this way). Keep track of the milage/time/ gas bill/prices, and road conditions. As for Pickle Lake Outposts, I've never booked with them, but have spoken to the owner a few times and he strikes me as a stand up gent. He has a good reputation I believe. And lastly, fill up the gas tank to the cap before going in, and come back out on fumes. Gas anit cheap in canada"
