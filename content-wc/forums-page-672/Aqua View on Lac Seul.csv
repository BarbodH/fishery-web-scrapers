562067,Guest,2006-11-26 21:49:00,0,One of our group has this unit. It does a great job in clear water but stained water has its issues. Bring it along and try it out.....

I've seem lots brought up, but usually guys take them out once, try them out for a short time, and then that's it. But if there is room, you may as well bring it. NWO Fishing Bum"
562115,goldencardinals,2006-11-27 18:20:00,7,Why would you want to bring one? I've been told I'm old school so please help me out here. Do you feel you need one to find fish? Please don't take this wrong but if that is what you feel you need to catch fish go ahead. I would rather use my knowledge and instincts and it doesn't take much at lac Suel.

Trust me I am not interested in bringing one along to help find fish. I have been fishing Lac Seul over 10 year now and I am well aware that you don't need much more than some fishing line and a hook to catch fish. I thought it would be interesting to see what the bottom was like in a few of the areas we fish and also watch the walleye hit. I honestly think you would probably waste a lot of time if you used one of these units to find fish on any lake. Based on the comments thus far it does not seem like it is worth the investment. Thanks

562149,goldencardinals,2006-11-29 19:11:00,7,Sorry MTP- I didn't mean to sound negative.I was having a bad day. Your right that would be fun to see what the bottom looks like. I fish quite a bit on Minnitaki which is east of Lac Suel. They tell me alot of the bottom there is clay based which seems strange but I know at times my jig feels like it is bouncing off something besides rock. Maybe that is the LaBatts.
562203,Fishoil,2006-12-05 10:01:00,1277,"I took mine along to a different lake last year. The lake we fish has stained water and you couldn't see more than maybe 5 feet, but it was a lot of fun. My daughter and I took turns watching and jigging just to see the walleyes take it. It's amazing how they'll sometimes have the jig in their mouth and the person with the rod won't even feel it. By all means take it along, you don't have to use it, but it sure can be fun."
