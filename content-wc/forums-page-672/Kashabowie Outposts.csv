562223,thunderatwork,2006-12-06 16:53:00,79,"I know my info is maybe older than you want, however jigman you have always helped me when i posed a question on here. I went thru them four yearsago to mountairy lake. good walleye fair northern lake. excellent outfitter. I don't like the long drive to their base camp-as compared to some outfitters closer to fort frances(rusty myers)"
562231,jigman 2003,2006-12-07 07:53:00,981,Thanks thunder. What lakes have you fished with Rusty Myers?
562232,Larry S,2006-12-07 08:32:00,666,"Jigman, Drove to Pickle Lake in 2005,from Thunder Bay its around 5 to 6 hours,the road is ok paved all the way. There are motels in Savant Lake and I believe in Pickle Lake. Larry S"
562247,thunderatwork,2006-12-08 10:12:00,79,"Metonga-three times granite-once Metonga i think is the jewel of the north, excelent walleye.On every trip just about everyone in the group will catch 24"" walleye and every trip has had someone catch a 26"". lots of walleye and lots of size. northern are only fair- but I'm usually up there in early to mid august, not the best time for northern. Unfortunately metonga is usullay booked far in advance. granite was good also, however the size was not there. But only having been there once i think it could be better than we had just because we were not familiar with it. Also the other three in my trip to granite had never been to canada before, so they were impressed anyway. This year we are booked to wabakime lake,"
562248,jigman 2003,2006-12-08 10:17:00,981,"Thanks again thunder. These guys look good, they are in our top three for booking."
562250,thunderatwork,2006-12-08 11:10:00,79,"Gals not guys, last i knew kashabowie, and i know rusty are both run by ladies, very well run i might add."
562251,jigman 2003,2006-12-08 11:34:00,981,"Oops. The email I got back from them was from a guy (I assume) named Don, but maybe he doesn't run the place. Anyway, thanks."
