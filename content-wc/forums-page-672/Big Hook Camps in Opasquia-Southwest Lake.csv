Our flight out last year was delayed for nearly 11 hours, but it was due to a very low ceiling and LOTS of rain. It made sense to delay the flights. We were lucky to get out, lots of guys didn't get out until quite late that day."
562233,Guest,2006-12-07 08:45:00,0,"Jigman 2003 For all the experence you're suppossed to have I think you are very picky, delays are part of fly-ins, would you rather they pick you up in a unsafe airplanne??? On your outfitter post you again seem to be hard to please. IMHO"
562234,jigman 2003,2006-12-07 08:58:00,981,"straitarrow-Sorry to offend you. Don't know where the impression came from that I'm supposed to have lots of experience? I'm just another guy who loves going to Canada. If you noticed I said that last year's delay made sense. I didn't want to get on a plane and fly into the kind of weather we had. Weather delays make perfect sense to me. I will always trust the pilots and owners at Mattice Lake Outfitters. Don, Annette, Yolanda, and Jason really know their stuff. They are hands down the best I've ever used. Nothing but happy with them. I am picky when it comes to spending $1000. Lots of horror stories out there about poor fishing, poor planes, poor pilots, etc. I like to do my homework. What I did say was that if there is no reason for a lengthy delay (hours and hours) I would be a little put off. If someone is supposed to pick me up at 7 a.m. and there is no weather delay, then I'd expect to be picked up by 8:30 at the latest. If that's unreasonable, then I guess I am the picky fool you feel I am. P.S.-if you noticed in Jig Man 2's response he indicated that he was supposed to be picked up at 5 a.m and wasn't picked up until 4 p.m. for no apparent reason. If you are okay with that (like he was, that's cool) then no sweat. I guess I'm a little high strung. Oh yeah, and even though he indicated there was some problems, Big Hook is at the top of my list for possible trips in 2007. Excellent fishing will make up for lots of other issues. Sorry to everyone for the long post."
562236,Mohleye,2006-12-07 10:44:00,368,"If I read Jigman 2's post correctly, the reason given was the weather, although it was perfect weather at the lake. I've had weather delays on fly-in's, and obviously you need to trust the pilot's judgement. That's no big deal, and I think everyone can understand that. But an 11 hour delay? I guess I'd need to know a little more, if I was 50 or 75 miles away, and the weather was perfect all day. An 11 hour delay followed by a 12 or 14 hour drive means driving all night, after being up since 4AM. I guess a lesson for the fly-in guys. Not only keep some fishing stuff out, but some food and drink."
562241,kbkakes,2006-12-07 22:09:00,49,"Jigman 2003 Wierd...I just answered another post of yours on a different lake Id been to! Was at COCOS in 2005. Great river system and lots od water to fish. Would like to fish the lake again but for the hassle getting there and back. Very primative up there. The cabin was too small for us and we had a bear in camp. The BOZOs before us were throwing garbage in the burn barrel. If you are serios about going there, Email me and I will give you info youll want to know."
562243,jigman 2003,2006-12-08 07:52:00,981,"Hey, thanks for both responses. I'll contact you if we decide to go that way (Big Hook)."
562249,Guest,2006-12-08 10:58:00,0,"Update on the delay: The delay was caused by the weather in Red Lake. 180 miles to the south. The weather up north was fine, who knows waht was going on down south."
562252,jigman 2003,2006-12-08 11:36:00,981,"Okay, I guess I should just have kept my mouth (keyboard) shut. I apologize to the board."
562189,jigman 2003,2006-12-04 09:12:00,981,"Looking for someone who's used Big Hook Outfitters out of Red Lake. Wondering if anyone's fished SW lake with them, or any lake. Just looking for input. Positive or negative. The place looks pretty fantastic."
562194,jigman 2003,2006-12-04 12:26:00,981,Nobody used this outfitter? Somebody must have.
562196,Guest,2006-12-04 13:45:00,0,I have used Big Hook one time and we are going back in 2007. They have pretty good cabins where we stayed and the fishing was excellent. The stories we heard from other parties that we met on the outbound trip were very good with excellent fishing.
562197,jigman 2003,2006-12-04 14:11:00,981,"Thanks for the reply. For as far north as these guys are, I would think the fishing should be fantastic."
562200,Larry S,2006-12-04 21:03:00,666,"Jigman, Went to Burnt Lake Camp around 15yrs ago did very well caught lots of fish,this was in July during a heat wave,all the reports I have seen have been very positive Larry S"
562206,Guest,2006-12-05 12:10:00,0,I will be making my 2nd trip w/ big hook in 07. Stayed at Coco's the first time and 100 fish a day was a given. Just an Ok cabin compared to some but then again who cares when you are up there to fish. Try this link for great reports from the owners son who guides on central lake: http://www.canadafever.com/forumdisplay.php?fid=4 The worst part of the trip is the double flights.
562207,jigman 2003,2006-12-05 12:13:00,981,"Yeah, tell me a little more about the flight set up. It sounds a little screwy. What kind of delay is there when you get to the Indian Reservation?"
562208,Guest,2006-12-05 12:21:00,0,It was easy getting there in fact it was down right Hillarious. They told us to wrap the beer in black bags as the indian reservation was dry. Upon arival we saw an indian stagering drunk at 10 o'clock in the morning. They shuttled us over from the air stip by vans that were missing the doors. From there they flew us to the lake in two beavers or cessna's. No problem getting there just hassle due changing planes. On the way out they were to pick us up at 5am and did not show until 4pm then it was mad rush to get us back to Red Lake before the airport shut down for the night. Blamed the delay on the weather although it was a perfect day at the lake. All in all it was worth it as we will be going back with them and this is the first time we ever used the same outfitter twice.
562209,jigman 2003,2006-12-05 12:39:00,981,"So, the fishing must have been fantastic to put up with that? I would have been pretty frustrated with that experience."
562210,Guest,2006-12-05 13:02:00,0,We will be prepared of this and will look at it as getting an extra day for free. Keep a rod handy and a couple of jigs and fish until you hear the plane. 9 out of 10 outfitters say they will pick you at x time and invariably it will be at least one hour later.
