506858,Guest,2000-01-23 09:38:00,0,"As previously posted, last May we fished the Clearwater/Pipestone area, had a great time. This year we would like to try a different area (NW Ontario or elsewhere). We fly out of Phoenix and found it's more economical to fly into a large airport (ie, Minneapolis or ??? and drive to Emo or ???). With this in mind we would like to find a lodge that offers an american plan and is somewhat secluded. Any comments of suggestions would be greatly appreciated. If you answered on my original message please repost as I didn't have the chance to view them. Thank you in advance."
506859,kurtstepp,2000-01-23 10:30:00,8,You might want to consider Sac Bay Lodge on Lake Sturgeon in the Ignace area. Check out their web site at www.sacbay.com. Good lake for big lake trout. Lots of other lakes in the area also.
506860,Guest,2000-01-23 10:47:00,0,You may want to check out Camp Narrows on Northwest bay in Rainy Lake. Sounds like what you are looking for.(great fishing)www.ontariossunsetcountry.ca
506861,Guest,2000-01-23 11:26:00,0,"I would recommed Chamberlin Narrows on Lac Suel. This is a boat in resort with about 10 cabins. They boat you in and you have access to thousands of acres of Walleye country. The staff will give you maps or you can hire a guide(I don't think it's necessary) We fished off the dock one day and landed 50 or so 16 to 22 inchers. Because there is so much area to fish, you are usually by yourself. This area of Lac Suel is more sheltered that he big part of the lake, so you can get out everyday - even in bad weather. They have American Plan. Ojibway Outfitters in Souix Lookout, ONT. operates the resort. They have a webpage."
506862,Guest,2000-01-23 17:07:00,0,Check out The Old Post & Village on Lake St. Joseph. It's about as remote as you can get. Their website is www.oldpost.com.
506863,River_eye,2000-01-23 18:26:00,1486,"An excellent, secluded, American Plan, lodge to visit is Eagle Nest Lodge, it's on the Winnipeg River in Eastern manitoba, it's a 27 mile boat ride from the nearest road, and about 2-3 miles from Ontario border. One thing that would suit this lodge to you is that it is only a 2 hr. drive from the Winnipeg International Airport.Website: http://www.eaglenest.mb.ca"
506864,Pooch,2000-01-23 18:56:00,4619,"You can fly into Red Lake, Ontario. Many locations available from there. Most camps can arrange to pick you up from about anywhere and take you to thier camp.Pooch"
506865,Guest,2000-01-26 22:50:00,0,"HI: Two lodges come to mind. Both are in northern Manitoba.1-Healey's lodge in God's Lake Narrows. I beleive that they have an American plan. Beautiful resort with all of the walleye and northerns you can handle.2-Fishing lake lodge. I'm not sure about the American plan ,but,MONSTER walleye and northerns. Fairly new lodge so it's real nice. If you are interrested in either of these you can e-mail me and I'll get you phone #'sLawrence"
