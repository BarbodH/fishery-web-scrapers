506983,Karl,2000-03-31 22:23:00,63,"Good choice of accomodations. Centrally located to all the best spots on the Minnitaki chain of lakes, including the best lake trout locations. A guy I work with stayed there last summer and had a great time fishing. The owner was able to direct him to the best spots to fish during the week he was there. Too bad the English River is closed to fishing until June 15th. You can easily get 200+ walleyes a day there. Abrams Chutes should be fantastic during your week though, and Bass Island is also close by - best smallmouth location in the chain."
