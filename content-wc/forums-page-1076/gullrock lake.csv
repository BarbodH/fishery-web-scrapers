We were in about 10 ft of water close to shore. We used minnows and crawlers. Didn't try any artificial. The bite was to good on jigs to try it last year. Any color jig seemed to work well too. Make sure to take plenty of jigs, because you will loose a lot doing this. Good luck. I'll try to give a report when we get back to let you know. We will be back June 3."
