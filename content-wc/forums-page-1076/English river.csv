The walleye fishing was outstanding,the camp facilities excellent and the people there were very helpful.We caught our limit of walleyes by noon every day and broke lines several times on large northerns.We didn't use their guides so had to be careful of the many submerged rocks.The only downside was the 27miles of gravel getting to the boat landing but it wasn't that bad.I would highly recommend this resort if you like seclusion, away from all the boat traffic and excellent fishing.They also offer Rv and camping sites right at the boat landing.Let me know if you want more info."
