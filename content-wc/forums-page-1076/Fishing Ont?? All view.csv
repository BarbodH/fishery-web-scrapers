507245,River_eye,2000-04-10 12:59:00,1486,"Actually, I know that guy personally. He's been on the river for a long time, and is one of the best guides I know, as well as a great guy. I continually come to him when I have any questions as I am a guide at Eaglenest. I also happen to know the whole story about him being fired. It's the same policy at Eaglenest, no booze, no drugs.

507246,Ron,2000-04-21 09:47:00,387,"River_eye your trying to tell that wasn't a joint he was about to take a puff of when Ed walked in and caught him? Any guide that Tetu has hired that has also worked at Eaglesnest Lodge has either been caught smoking pot or drinking, Except for chris. So don't tell me that Tetu has the same policy as Eaglesnest."
507247,River_eye,2000-04-21 20:13:00,1486,"Yes, that's what I'm saying, there was pot involved, but it wasn't his and Ed didn't see him smoking it, it's even a little more complicated than that. If you are one of those people who believes everything they hear, that's fine by me. If you don't want to believe me about the Eaglenest policy on drinking and drugs, just e-mail the owner, he'll tell you, guys get fired there for that too.River eye"

507236,Nels,2000-02-28 16:50:00,29,"Could someone please list a few nice placesto fish in Ont. I will probably take my own boatbut will need a cabin to stay in. Nothing fancy just a place to eat, sleep and dock boat. I want a place where a person can consisantly catch big pike (to release) walleye and maybe perch. Like to have a place you can really catch fish. Be the 2 or 3 week in July. Don't want an expensive place something simple but comfortable. If this place has a web site please list, as phone #. Thanks so much for any info you can tell me about the place you list. Nels"
507237,Guest,2000-03-01 10:37:00,0,"I own a remote boat-in lodge (3miles from landing) 42 miles NE of Ear Falls. We are on confederation Lake 14,000 acres and 7 cabins that we only take 20-24 guests per week. Our rates are very reasonable and you can bring your own boat (30 gal. of gas included but no discount off of rate for own boat) Take a look at our web site southbaylodge.com Roger."

507241,Guest,2000-04-01 21:33:00,0,"I feel that Tetu Island Lodge in Northwestern Ontario is the best resort I have ever been to. The walleye fishing is Unbelievable, I was up there in July last year while In-fisherman was there. One day they caught 97 walleyes over 22"" and 19 walleyes over 26"". They also have great Smallie action and Trophy Northern Pike. For boats they run custom built 1750 Crestliner Fish hawks with 50 horse yamaha's. The meals are all U.S.D.A. Prime beef (New York Strip, Steak Oscar, Prime Rib, and BBQ Ribs). The service is awesome. I can't wait for my next trip. I think they have a web site. (tetuislandlodge.com)"
507242,River_eye,2000-04-02 15:06:00,1486,"They are nice boats, but I don't believe that they are Crestliners. I believe that they are a make called Deep Water, they just repainted them all green, but still nice boats. I know a few people that worked there, the employees aren't treated well at all, but I'm sure the guests are.[font size=""4"" color=""green"" font face=""signature""]River eye[/font]"
507243,Guest,2000-04-03 07:42:00,0,"As a matter of fact River_eye my guide last year had a demo 1750 Crestliner fish hawk that he was trying out for the 2000 season. When I stopped in at the sportshow in Minneapolis last month the guys that were working the Tetu both showed me the Special order sheet directly from Cresliner for the 20 New Crestliner fish hawks they had purchased for the new season. They are also running new Yamaha's 50 horse four-strokes. As far the help being treated unfairly, during my stay in July last year all the employees seem to be upbeat and having a good time. They would come down on the deck and talk to all the fisherman, you would also see some guides and some girls down in the lodge at nights playing pool or just talking with the guests. The comment about guests was entirely true, I had the best service of my life, the best food of my life, I fished out of the best boat, and I had the best fishing of my life. If anyone is looking for a truly awesome fishing trip it has to be Tetu Lodge."
507248,Dave,2000-04-03 15:09:00,258,"Try Press Lake Camp. The owners are nice, the cabins clean and well kept, and the fishing is good. Email me and I will send you the info as soon as I can, or search the web for contact info."
507244,Guest,2000-04-08 19:46:00,0,"I have been to Tetu three times in the past the boats, the guides, the food, the staff, and the fishing are all unbelivable. I am awstruck every time I go there with all the changes that evolve year after year. In reference to River_eye's comment about the staff, the staff seem's to be very happy working up there. The owners Ed and Kathi Henn have a very strict rule about no drugs on the island, I think this is an absolute must in any business. I do know that a couple of guides have been kicked out of Tetu because they were using drugs while they were employeed there, and come to think of it they went back to work at Eagle's Nest Lodge. I'm sure glad when I go back to Tetu this august, that my guide won't be stoned or hung over like some other camps."
