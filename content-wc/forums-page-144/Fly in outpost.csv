They fly out of Red Lake and John flies his own Otter. Another highly recommended outfitter is Slate Falls Outposts out of Sioux Lookout. www.slatefallsoutposts.com probably some of the finest outpost camps in NW Ontario. They also fit your needs. I have gone with both of these outfitters and highly recommend them.

I would have no problem taking my wife to their outpost camps, very nice. all the lakes are up around the albany river area, good walleye and 'shoebox' pike (big and boxy) fatter on average then the hammer handles u see below the 52nd parallel. their base camp in Armstrong is nice as well if u need to stay the night before. the business is modest but professional. now for the BIG 3, 1- the planes are good and well maintained(very important) don is a good pilot (also very important) 2- the equipment, cabins and included items at the lake are spot on. 3- the lakes are all of a good size and deep enough to hold decent size fish, very secluded doesn't always mean lottsa fish. I've been to the 'other place' and saved a few bucks, but was terrified of the plane, pilot and the flight in, terrible camp and equipment, small shallow and unproductive lake,etc. not sure what they charge now, but I consider it the same as shopping for a tattoo artist, cheaper isn't always better, especially if this cat is hurling you and your loved ones through the air at 150 mph. there is nothing better than a fly in to a remote lake full of walleye! enjoy yourself. pinenut"
