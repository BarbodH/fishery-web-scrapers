6235504,farmnfish,2018-08-20 09:47:00,130,"Depends on you and what you're after. I was there in the dog days of august and had no problem catching plenty of walleye up to 25 inches. Some nice smallmouth too. Its was an easier place to find fish than on some bigger lakes, at least for me it was. I got up and fished with the sunrise and I fished with the sunset. Then spent the bulk of the day doing family stuff. Having Blue Lake nearby and Vermillion Bay and Dryden gave us a variety of things to do with the kids.The resort owner told me that people there the week before us complained that they didn't catch any thing. But they didn't get up till 10. The bite was gone by then.I've caught more and bigger fish in other places. But for a family trip it was awesome."
6237062,Guest,2018-08-24 08:38:00,0,"The chain is a early and late bite (first 2hrs& last 2 hours) EXCEPT in the spring and fall. I've been fishing the chain for 20 years and its an excellent fishery, BUT, you need to know what you,re doing and when to do it!!! Thanks farmnfish"
6234134,knschmitt,2018-08-16 07:11:00,2,Just wondering if anyone has fished the Indian Lake Chain by Vermillion Bay?
6234256,38bill,2018-08-16 12:40:00,331,I have but it's been a few years. You can send me a PM with questions.
6234496,farmnfish,2018-08-17 06:39:00,130,"Have, 1 week, and I'm sure a fair number of other people posting here have more experience than that."
6234624,ToxicAngler,2018-08-17 14:40:00,30,"I have 1 week under my belt. I found that there's good populations of fish. Most walleye are in the 12-16"" range. My group caught 3 Musky, all were 42"". Bigger ones were seen. Lots of water to fish in one week. My personal opinion, there's better systems to fish in Ontario."
6234632,Bigfish10702,2018-08-17 15:05:00,60,"Heading up in September for my 13th trip to Indian Lake chain. Fishing is usually good, but you have to move around to find them. My group has been going to the chain for 25+ years. When you going up?"
6234634,Capt Morgan,2018-08-17 15:08:00,77,Go to yournorthernconnection.com I put up a report.
6234656,Walleye2242,2018-08-17 16:23:00,263,went there for like 4 years in a row. was not impressed. caught fish but nothing impressive for a daily output. 12-16 inches is a norm. we have found much better fishing further north in red lake area. just 1 guys thoughts.
6234880,spotter,2018-08-18 14:51:00,178,I was there last yr its terrible would never go back fishing is poor
6235104,Guest,2018-08-19 09:00:00,0,"poor fishing, really? Last fall I banged a 48 and a52 in. ski and this spring we got (wife nd I) 62 inches of walleye in 2 trolling passes in 15 minutes, a 32 and a 30 in 6foot of water. Poor fishing, naw, my guess. poor fishermon!!!!"
6235156,Guest,2018-08-19 09:45:00,0,"the chain is full of 12-16 inchers, if those fish were perch, no one would whine and by the way the walleye is the bigger cousin to the perch SOOOOO and that's why the new daily limits are in place, so the fish hogs can't eat 40 or 50 of your best fish in a week!!! Just my opinion"
