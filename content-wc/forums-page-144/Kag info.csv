For the first part of the week we fished a couple hundred yards up the river. One night it was just stupid there, we had three boats pulling up a walleye every cast. That spot slowed as the week wore on and the last few days we had similar action on the flat across from the Kag cabin on the far shore in about 6-8 fow. We bought several hundred minnows and had some of them flown in midweek. However, we did well with plastics so I would not spend the money. The water dropped about a foot while we were there and the river got a little treacherous. Fortunately you cant really go fast enough with a 9.9 to cause any damage. We talked a little bit with the group that was in Kag. All their boats flew the jolly roger and they were playing pirate. They said they did well and mostly fished spots in other parts of the lake. Please post a report because staying right in Kag is on my radar. Fish On! Hooks"
6238806,ziggyzag,2018-08-28 20:52:00,125,Thanks for responding but I believe you are referencing Kap if you where on Tennant. We have stayed on KAP 4 times thru the years when Remi was running it and found it to also be great walleye fishing. But I am asking about KAG north of there I believe. Thanks for sharing.

The Walleye were still migrating into the lake and were stacked up in the outflow from Van Poele and the river at the south end. Not sure what it was like in June that year. I was certainly surprised they were still migrating, that's for sure. I can't recall if it was a late ice out that year or not. Most likely."
6239278,ziggyzag,2018-08-30 01:21:00,125,No problem just glad you are willing to share.
6239280,ziggyzag,2018-08-30 01:26:00,125,"Thanks, we where there around 30 years ago in the spring and stayed on Van Poele and found the same thing fish were stacked in the river mouth. Went back 10 years later in the spring and stayed on Kag and found fish everywhere but that year the spring was early."
