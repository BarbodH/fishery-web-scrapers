6237608,MikeAnkeny,2018-08-25 20:10:00,67,Also leaving Friday. Hope to fish Steamboat and Mckenzie a lot.
6237624,tandm,2018-08-25 21:13:00,679,"Just got back today. Great fishing in select areas.Best luck jigging in 30-35 foot drop-offs.Minnows and crawlers both worked. Trolling worked in some areas, Spinner rigs in orange to red shades,again fishing drop-offs,Lots of 20 inch+walleye, Pike fishing was very tough."
6238110,fishingMN4eyes,2018-08-27 08:46:00,108,"Down about 3ft. When we were up two weeks ago they had only had 1.5"" of rain since May."
6230824,fishingMN4eyes,2018-08-07 11:33:00,108,Heading up Monday. Any reports out of this area? Thanks in advance!
6230882,Anglin Andy,2018-08-07 14:07:00,100,"We fished from Tuesday, 7/31 through Friday 8/3 out of Gawley's Little Beaver Lodge. We fished in McKenzie Bay (reefs West/NW of the Big Sand Banks) Windigo Point area, Manitoba Point area and Stoney Point area. Best depth was 26 to 30 feet. We fished primarily Spinners (Hammered Silver) Crawlers with Bottom Bouncers. We caught 352 Walleyes in the four days. 4 people. We did get some hefty winds on Tuesday and part of Wednesday and lows in the mid 40's for temps on a couple of evenings. Good trip for our crew:-) Anglin Andy"

6232242,David Anderson,2018-08-11 13:33:00,2073,"Just got back last night from Fisherman's Cove in Scout Bay. Had better catch days but can't beat the week away from home. I would not say fishing was slow but you definitely had to search for them. Our best luck was south of Stony Point on those mid lake humps. 22 - 30 feet of water. 8 guys, 5 days of fishing, a couple of rookies with, we caught about 560 walleyes for the trip. Nothing to complain about. One of our boats took the week off so we fished 4 guys in 2 boats. We 100% jig fished with minnows. Many of the fish were full of crayfish. 2 largest were 26.5 and 26.75. As always fish are just the bonus as we had a great time at the Cove."

6235526,fishingMN4eyes,2018-08-20 10:48:00,108,"Monday: Got into camp around 3:30pm, went out for a quick couple hours of fishing on a reef close to camp, and almost got blown off the lake. Still managed to bring in a couple of unders that first night though. Tuesday: Ran down to the Steamboat area for our first full day of fishing, not very windy and pretty sunny if I remember correctly. Struggled on some spots we fished previous years, picked up a few fish but nothing consistent. Managed a few shorelunch fish just in time for lunch. Found a nice spot with a 24' top surrounded by 35-40'. Fished that right before lunch and stayed there all afternoon picking up quite a few slot fish. Wednesday: Made the run down to McKenzie. Again we had very little wind and it was a very bright, sunny day. Struggled to catch fish in some good spots from previous years. The morning was VERY slow for our boat. Met up with the other boat in our group and caught fish around the edges of a rock pile/island and picked up a few fish after lunch. Decided to start heading back toward camp and hit a few spots on the way back to camp. Found a 3' top just as we were coming out of Shanty Narrows and ended up fishing that the rest of the day. Picked up some fish as high as 6-8' right around the top and then in the the deep 20s drifting onto or off of the structure.Thursday: Was forecasted to be a very sunny and hot day. Had a very manageable breeze that ended up blowing some smoke from the fires around and it turned out to be a really hazy day. Started out at the same spot we ended on Wednesday and picked up right where we left off. Even got into some perch on that spot. Not jumbos by any stretch but big enough that we felt like bringing a handful home. From there we moved down to McKenzie again found a new rock pile/island that we had never fished before. Picked up fish all around the island in 15-20' and basically fished that the rest of the afternoon. This was our best day of fishing IMO.Friday: Ran to Mckenzie again. Started off with a slight breeze and we hit a reef right inside McKenzie and picked up the last under and over we needed for limits right away on that first spot we stopped. From that point on the wind all but died and the sun as beating down on us pretty hard so the rest of the morning was slow. Fished the same rock pile we ended the day on Thursday, we picked up some fish but it wasn't as crazy as the day before. Did pick up a nice 23"" just hanging my line in the water while I was trying to eat my sandwich for lunch Then we found a spot that topped out at about 19' surrounded by 25-30'. That spot was very productive to end our trip after what ended up being a slow morning. Overall not our best numbers trip but the quality fish we caught was good as usual. We caught tons of fish in the 18-22"" range, it got to the point of ""just another slot fish"" in our boat. The other boat in our group had a 24.5"" and we had the lunchtime 23"" in our boat, those were the big walleyes for the week. Orange jigs seemed to be the ticket, although when fishing was really good the color didn't seem to matter. We fished minnows and crawlers, I'd say minnows were probably slightly better but there were times it didn't matter. My brother fished almost primarily bottom bouncers and most of time caught just as many fish as we did on jigs. I tried jigging raps a couple times and picked up a few fish on that as well. I'd say the most productive depth was 18-22' but it really depended on the spot. We did pick up some fish shallow as well but those deeper tops we found were definitely the most productive while we were there. Water was down 3'. There was a big fire going on in Steamboat and another smaller fire down in McKenzie so there was lots of smoke lurking around."
