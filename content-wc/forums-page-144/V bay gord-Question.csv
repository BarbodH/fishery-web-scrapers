6239518,bearfvr13,2018-08-30 13:45:00,174,"I selected you, but anybody can answer. I realize I need to have a life vest or PFD per person on the boat. But my question is this, does it have to be worn? Now before anybody gives me a scalding, I DO wear it, I'm only asking if Ontario requires you to wear it, or if it just needs to be in the boat? Thanks, ChuckBearfvr13"
6239522,vteye3,2018-08-30 13:50:00,496,We asked and if I remember correctly they do not have to be worn but must be accessible.
6239548,Mojo-NC,2018-08-30 14:29:00,1929,Unless it is an inflatable vest. Those must be worn to count.
6239558,v-bay gord,2018-08-30 15:27:00,3168,You need to have them onboard but you don't need to wear them. I believe the other responses are correct as well.....accessible.... and worn if it's an inflatable. I was hoping for a controversial question to stoke the fires of WC.
6239614,pjshorthorn,2018-08-30 17:58:00,5654,"Here are just a few ....... What is easier/ better for guests.......charging in USD or Loonies? Although legal to keep a big fish over the stated regulation sizes, is that morally the right thing to do to keep a fishery healthy? Is possibly banning a guest for keeping 6"" perch , just so you have to clean them , an acceptable conservation measure for the lake? Are yoga pants recognized as ""true"" fishing attire or just as a fashion statement? What's better.......fishing in the nude or just wearing a mink lined thong? I have more questions ,but I wasn't sure if you had the mental capacity to handle more than this small sampling . PjShorthorn"

I have sent questions by email to the MNR with the following email address:[email protected]In each instance, I received a thorough reply within a few days that addressed my specific question. You might give it a try!Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6239794,bearfvr13,2018-08-31 09:10:00,174,"Thank you everybody!! And thanks for the link BornToFish!!! I usually always wear my safety gear, but sometimes when we are drifting or anchored, I have been known to take it off, but as someone mentioned earlier in this thread, I use inflatable vests, so I guess I should keep it on to stay off the naughty list!!! Chuck"
6239808,Pymbet,2018-08-31 09:26:00,42,"Is the reason you have to wear an inflatable vest is that if thrown to a person in the water (who wasn't wearing it), it could sink? This presumes the unlikely event that it doesn't automatically inflate when thrown in. FYI, I started using one this year and really like it, especially on hot days."
6239822,wmd,2018-08-31 09:43:00,388,If the inflatable vest does inflate before a person has it on I don't think you will be able to get it over your head to wear it. wmd
6239842,The tank,2018-08-31 10:21:00,340,We got stopped while fishing this july by the MNR and one boat only had inflatables and i had both in my boat. The officer the other boat talked too said theres had to be worn. I had both life vests and pfds so we did not.
