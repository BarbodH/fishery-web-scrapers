6237264,That Minnesota guy,2018-08-24 15:03:00,8293,With all the Muskie & Pike in Eagle I ask myself why people bother fishing for those rough fish. (Walleye) Nice report!
6237294,prov1800,2018-08-24 15:41:00,5010,Funny.sometimes it's just a walleye week.this last week there were a number of muskie boats in camp and some great fish came in as it did last week.check out there Facebook page.ill be on lac suel 3 days then back on eagle and will be doing a combo for a few days.

6238444,Bwirth,2018-08-27 19:59:00,2,Got a guide for a day just wanted to know how things are going and what expect this time of year
6238496,prov1800,2018-08-28 06:00:00,5010,Water temps are dropping.iam up on lac suel now and seems a lot of fish there are in the 18 ft range.still some deep fish on my sonar but I tend to leave those alone.jig and a minnow still working great.color really doesn't matter as I use a black jig most of the time.we found a lot of fish right on top of some midlake humps at around 10 ft.and some right in front of weedlines in that same depth.had the same thing on eagle last week and those fish are way more aggressive than the deeper ones and also larger fish.ill be back on eagle wed through Fri.
