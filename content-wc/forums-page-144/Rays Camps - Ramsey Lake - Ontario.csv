I am trying to get in touch with them but the facebook user I was talking with(yes we spoke mostly on facebook) has been disabled or banned me for some reason. I tried to call the number on their website and it says I cannot be connected. Just hoping it is nothing and I have emailed them but I am a bit concerned... Curious if anyone has been recently."
