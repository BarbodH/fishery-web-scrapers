4120329,Bassmandpe,2015-08-11 14:34:00,42,"Our group of eight fished the Lake near Dubreuiville. We have been making this trip about the same time for many years. This year our fishing was different than other years. 80% of the fish we caught were 14 inches and under. Don't know if it was the late weather or moon phases. But we did catch one 30 inch Walleye and two 28's during this time. Worms or leeches didn't seem to matter, mostly small fish. Now don't get me wrong, we had plenty of fish to eat and this size are excellent eaters for sure. We caught some Pike to go along with the wallleye for dinners. Tried the Poor Mans Lobster with 7-up which was excellent, try it! One of the staffers said it has been the same since Spring with the small fish being caught. Wondering if anybody else experienced the same thing?"

Do you have any tips for me on lures or location to catch walleye? A guy in our group is also after big pike. Any help is appreciated.Also, any tips related to Loch Island Lodge would be helpful. This is my 5th Ontario fishing trip but my first trip to Loch Island Lodge."

4516481,Jaskonie,2016-02-04 18:58:00,80,"In order to catch walleye at wabatongushi you only need to have a line in the water. seriously there are a lot of fish there and a lot of good spots near Loch Island, just listen to what the staff tells you as far as depth and bait to use, time of day etc. For the most part you need to be on the bottom. If you are marking fish then you can get away with being off the bottom a foot or two or trolling hot n tots. That time of year you are probably gonna be jigging in 15 to 30' of water off points and sunken islands. Bottom bouncers with harnesses work well too. If you start catching a lot of small fish move to another spot until you find bigger fish. Good Luck."

6237646,pinenut,2018-08-26 05:18:00,16,"hey umpire, fished waba in july 2017, had to work for fish because we hit the mayfly hatch. ran a worm harness behind a 5/8oz. bottom bouncer and did o.k we stayed at isle of jorden and did our best trolling from the dock toward the narrow opening right side of island down lake. the narrows (full of weeds) above the no fish zone held some nice pike got a 38'' on a gold 5/8oz red eye wiggler (my favorite Canada lure). the pike in waba seem to be a bit bigger on average than similar lakes, run up toward erringtons, stop and fish the shoot between the 2 island cabins (private) and the shore, nice rock ledge and lottsa walleye and pike. lochisland is ok, jerry's cool, my buddy and his wife had to cancel, something about emergency open heart surgery, (big sissy) and jerry still put my wife and I up in jorden camp and gave our friends back their full deposit, he's O.K. in my book. cedar boats are nice, but a tad slow with a 9.9motor. didn't see a lot of people, which was nice, being there is a public boat launch near jorden camp. saw bear, lottsa bald eagles, coyote. very pretty lake, troll that worm harness if all else fails. GOOD LUCK! pinenut"
