An external hard drive could be lost to fire or virus, our brains pretty muc h the same, but also time. It's good to look back often on happy days as well.Quote: Originally Posted by gordy28Thanks for taking the time to do the write up and to share it!

6230324,Moosebunk,2018-08-06 09:42:00,211,"During July while contracted to work in Coral Harbour, Nunavut, I was treated to six days out on the tundra fishing arctic char. With rather tempered expectations but high hopes, an unforgettable experience would quite exceed anything I could have imagined ahead of time. This is a heavy picture loaded story inspired from places atop Hudson Bay few will ever visit, written for the spirit of fishing adventure.
