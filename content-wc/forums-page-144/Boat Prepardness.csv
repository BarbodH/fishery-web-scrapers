6238734,tandm,2018-08-28 16:15:00,679,"Agree with everything that has been posted. I, also, have a marine band radio with an 8' antenna, which I keep turned on when I am on the water. I have never had to use it myself, but did rescue 2 individuals having engine problems, after I heard their distress call late one afternoon. They were near the back end of a bay, where no boat would see them. Cheap insurance for what they cost. I made 2 new friends that day."

6221438,Mr Ranger,2018-07-14 12:12:00,272,"It amazes me how many unprpared people I run into out on the water on our Canada trips. Usually every year we end up towing or rescuing someone because they did not prepare properly. I put this listing together with some tips. For many old salts most of this is common sense but most people think nothing can ever happen to them. Perhaps this will help some prepare for that one time it could save your life. Boating Survival Tips July 6, 2018 Below are some suggestions for a safe and enjoyable boating experience while fishing. It is easy to get caught up in the whole experience and overlook some common-sense things that can make it a safe experience. No matter how experienced a boater you are things can happen and equipment can unexpectedly fail. I have a small bag that stays in the boat all week and a great week is one that the survival bag never gets opened. General Comments 1. Make sure you are dressed appropriately for the days event. Keep in mind weather changes very quickly in the great north so you need to be prepared especially should it rain. What if you do have to spend the night are you prepared? 2. Although you usually have a person along that is knowledgably on boating and knowing the lake it is important that everyone has a general knowledge of how to work the motor. Also, everyone should study the lake map prior to hitting the water. Thank god for GPS. 3. Thoroughly inspect your boat in the morning paying special attention to is your gas tank full, any excess water in the boat, and a charged battery. If boating long distances be sure to watch gas level closely. 4. Be sure to tell someone which area of the lake you plan on fishing especially if the boats split up. 5. If you do split up have a plan. What time will you meet up and where will you meet. It helps to pick a spot to rendezvous on the way back to camp with the understanding you won't go past that point until all boats are present. 6. Two-way radios can be a big help but have very limited range out on the water due to the rock formations. 7. Most years we come across stranded boaters both from the camp and locals. If you see a boat waving boat cushions or paddles it is a sign they are in distress. It surely is disruptive to your day to help someone but not helping is very wrong and pretty sure it is the law. Pay back both ways usually come your way so choose wisely. Supplies in addition to the required boat items required by law 1. Really good robust flash light with strobe with fresh long-lasting batteries. I pack a spare battery set just in case. I always put a fresh set in at the start of the week. 2. Snack bars and plenty of water. Us old timers need to stay hydrated, so extra water is a must. 3. Whistle 4. Water proof matches or lighter and light sticks 5. Air horn 6. Small mirror 7. Mosquito repellant 8. COMPASS 9. At least a 25-foot tow rope. When towing you will need to go slow especially in rough water. 10. Small retractable camp saw 11. Extra dose of required meds in case you must spend the night 12. First aid kitBoy scout camp fire song book ðŸ˜Š"
6221456,kettyspanky,2018-07-14 13:17:00,271,"I like all the things on your list. I would ad a good can of sunscreen. I also take a waterproof container and put in pliers and extra shear pin and my boat reg. card. Anything you think you might need, put it in the boat or wherever it will fit. Just like the scouts, be prepared."
6221460,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2018-07-14 13:23:00,629,"Mr. Ranger: Post well done. Having a summer facility here on LOTW, I respect all of the suggestions U have made & I have practiced such suggestions for every daily adventure on LOTW for the past 18 seasons. My days on the water can easily find me crossing the Int. Border into Ontario & miles from the S. shore & home & I have had to call on U'er list multiple times over the yrs! Set the Hook, CRJohn"
6221468,Mr Ranger,2018-07-14 13:47:00,272,How lucky are we to be faced with such dangers . Part of the adventure but I NEVER want to be that guy.
6221512,btyreprich,2018-07-14 15:58:00,1067,Great list of items to have in the boat. I'd like to add one item I had in our boat when we owned it: get a welders brazing case and place like 3 road flares inside the case. The brazing rod cases are pretty much water tight and will keep the flares in one safe spot. Cheap insurance - neither the rod case or flares are expensive.
6222002,rockape,2018-07-16 07:25:00,215,"This thread got me thinking. I've been towed multiple times and have also ran out of gas in a friend's boat. Always good to come out of these situations ok. Last year, a friend of ours that only goes every 5 years or so brought his son with him. They fished really hard, and always came in later than us. One evening, it was pretty much dark and he wasn't back. Small camp boat with a 25 on the back. We actually asked the camp owner what the protocol is to go search for people. We were worried because of it being really dark and him hitting a rock hazard. The camp owner kind of shrugged his shoulders, and said he didn't know of one. It's not like America where you can call the coast guard. Our friend did make it back a bit later. Who would you call if someone doesn't come back and a search needs to be performed? OPP? MNR?"
6222024,Mr Ranger,2018-07-16 07:56:00,272,ya that could be very scary for sure. Where we fish there is no cell service so calling someone is not an option. About the only logical thing you can do is pick a safe spot on a small island that is visible while it is still pretty light out and set up for the night. If your lucky someone might come out for you but very few camp boats have any kind of lights on them.
6222720,Live to jig,2018-07-17 21:30:00,159,"Mr.Ranger you are the man and so good to bring this subject up, as you know ...lol..I did spend the night on the lake and thought I would share the video. Kind of funny now but there were some ups and downs but being prepared is the key. I should state that we agreed ahead of time not to be out looking for anyone after dark on this lake due to the many hazards that are on most Canadian lakes including this one. I should have checked the gas before running out for the night bite.https://youtu.be/ltGE9ETBjDw"
6222870,lawson2343,2018-07-18 10:29:00,459,Great list. The one thing I don't have that I'm going to add to mine is the small saw. I've got a Gerber retractable that would work great. I also always have at least 4 emergency survival blankets in the boat. I didn't see that in the list.
6222884,Mr Ranger,2018-07-18 10:45:00,272,Great adds. That is the same saw I use and nice and compact. Good call on the blankets too.
