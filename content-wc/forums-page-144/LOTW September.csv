6239264,Ia Walihntr,2018-08-29 21:34:00,320,The upper end of Tug Channel in the deep water areas will hold crappies. The timing of your trip is the question and the crappie bite is strictly regulated by water temp. If temps cool enough the crappies will be there and biting. The bay to the right (upper end) that has the water falls has an island in it. Directly west of the island is a deeper hole (23 to 26 ft depending on water levels) that will hold crappies. On the left side of the upper end of Tug Channel is Schoolhouse Point. A deep hole on the south side of the point and east a short distance (depth is approx. 25 to 29 feet) will also hold crappies. There are a few deep holes further north at the entrance and along Johnson Passage. You might try there also. Hope this helps.
6239266,Mattymo,2018-08-29 21:42:00,16,Thank you. Much appreciated.
6236220,Mattymo,2018-08-21 21:47:00,16,Heading up to lake of the woods in the middle of September. We will mostly be muskie fishing but would like to get into some walleyes and crappies. Hoping to eat fish a few times while we are there. We are staying at spruce island not far from the nw angle. Any tips? Sounds like crappies will usually be heading for deeper water by then but don't know exactly what I'm supposed to look for? Thanks in advance.
6236260,Bill Krejca,2018-08-22 07:14:00,6107,"Re:Crappies - Look for a deeper area in otherwise shallower surroundings. they congregate to these places as the water cools. Then look for clouds, or ""pods"" on your depth finder. May also be just a few specks on the bottom. Then it is a matter of getting down to them and having them bite. The next day/next hour, the school will probably have moved, so the search begins again. Note the wind direction when you do find them, and store that information for the next time a similar condition prevails. You can predict, to some extent, where they should be, based upon prevailing wind, and other weather patterns. Also note where they are when no wind is blowing, they are likely to be there again in similar conditions. Unless they are not! Have fun!! Bill"
6236306,IowaWalleye1978,2018-08-22 08:50:00,96,Mattymo I will be at Spruce sept 9 - 14 in search of walleyes and will be throwing for muskies a little bit as well. I have been there the last few falls and have not had much luck with crappies but also not looking for them. It would be fun to get into a pile of fat crappies!!! Good Luck!
6236464,fishpoop,2018-08-22 17:01:00,630,"http://www.spruceislandcamp.com/spru...mp2014_034.htmFrom the map located on that page on the bottom... The Tug Channel: fish the islands, points, and buoys going north towards Johnston Passage along the north side of Falcon Island. The east side of Tug Channel has weeds. Johnston Passage: Fish that towards the south side of Lily Island. Then fish the entire island clusters north of Johnston Passage, east of Lily Island and west of Coste IslandFalcon Island: west side just south of Johnston Passage on the main boat track is a 3 reef complex called Monkey Rocks. These are marked by buoys and a light. Jean Baptiste Rocks: on the west side of La Verendrye Island which is n.w. of Johnston passage. Bishop Point: north of the Jean Baptiste Rocks is Bishop point and a series of reefs. That should keep you busy. Sorry, no help from me for walleye or crappie. Have never fished for them up there."
6236544,Mattymo,2018-08-22 21:01:00,16,Thanks guys I appreciate it. Iowawalleye we were up the 16-23rd last year and had iowa guys in camp.
6236708,jimirjr,2018-08-23 11:13:00,1149,"Me and My Group will be up 6th - 14th out of SIOUX NARROWS.. Doing an HB trip out of TOMAHAWK RESORT Usually fish around YELLOW GIRL vicinity.... We have NEVER had success locating the CRAPPIES... It seems the ""locals"" are far more tight-lipped about CRAPPIE Location than WALLEYE Locations... Oh well, it is what it is... Maybe we'll get lucky this year ? lol!"
6236734,rwl,2018-08-23 12:20:00,1655,"I love Spruce Island, been there 30 some times. Can't help you much with crappies though, ask Paul, he will for sure tell you what he hears, but crappies aren't always talked about too much. I've heard in the winter they get them through the ice close to the island so they should be near. Going by what Bill says you have lots of shallower water in Sabaskosing bay, loon bay etc, the clouds of bait and other fish on the sonar is incredible inside of the bay by what I think is Eagle island, (we call it something else) all the way back to the camp. At least in end of October early Nov. I've seen guys catching crappies in the bay up tug where the water comes down from inland lake near the sand beach, this was also in last week of October. If I was looking for then Id probably poke around out by Twin Islands, but I am not sure what guys mean by deep. I can't stop casting for musky long enough to look for much else. Of course you should be able to pick up walleyes right behind camp and the reef everyone fishes there for your fish fry. We get a bunch of them on the reef or deeper, perch too. I could tell you where a true tanker musky was in July, LOL."
6236786,IowaWalleye1978,2018-08-23 13:43:00,96,RWL if you tell me I will tell you!!! I know of a spot where some guides from Oak Island said they saw a 60 So they say anyways!
6237012,Bill Krejca,2018-08-24 06:50:00,6107,"Re: ""Deep"" - It is a relative term, and depends on the surrounding area. In the Sabaskong area, for example, I'd say deep was 18 ft - 35 ft, or over. 18 ft would be deep if the surrounding water had mostly 8-12 ft of water, and if there was a hole deeper than that, that is where I would start searching. Some places may go down to 48-50 ft, and here the crappies may tend to suspend at times. Unfortunately, a larger area of deep within surrounding shallower water can tend to be netted rather heavily, so this can be a consideration; I'd look for smaller pockets further from here. Bill"
6237338,oly67,2018-08-24 17:51:00,241,I would just follow the guy in the dark gray Ranger.........
