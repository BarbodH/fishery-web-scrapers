6237830,Thunderpants Johnson,2018-08-26 15:22:00,18,"Just got back from a week on Charlotte with my group of 4. First off, Id like to thank the guys on this page, Especially Mike G, for all the help. What a great group. It was my first ever fly in trip and it was made so much easier thanks to this page. I was going for trophy pike, with walleye as a bonus. I live in MA and the only eyes we have are in the CT River and Ive only caught about 6 of them accidentally during bass tournaments. We were there for 5 days, but day 1 obviously wasnt a full day of fishing, and day 4 the wind was SCREAMING out of the north and made anything but trolling close to impossible. To say it was the disappointment of my life would be an understatement. After 5 days of fishing from 6am to 830pm my group tallied 19 pike in the 3-5lb range. I managed 5 of them, mostly as a bicatch while jigging for walleye. I had 8 rods rigged on the boat and covered every inch of that place from top water to 15 feet down. Hour after hour, nothing. The pilot that flew us out was a young kid, and I really liked him. He took a lot of time going over everything, and marked our maps with the best fishing spots. I beat them all to death. Fortunately there were as many walleye in there as you could catch and I brought a pile of jig heads and 500 crawlers. He said the eyes would be in 20-30 feet, but we couldnt find anything that deep. I could pick any point in there, any time of day, and sit in 15' of water and jig up walleyes and never run out. We would pike fish for a few hours, get bored, go jig up 20-40 walleye, then go back to not catching pike. Most of the biggest walleye came in 5' of water on pike lures. I lost one about 6-7lbs at the side of the boat on a jerk bait. I think we caught about 250 walleye, all in the middle of the day in the bright sunshine. I cant imagine how many fish legitimate walleye anglers would catch in there. I also cant imagine the bait in there as these fish we the fattest Ive ever seen. The only thing I can come up with for the pike is they werent ever there to begin with, or the fact that the lake was so low. It was down about 3-4 feet and all the grass youd normally fish was in ankle deep water. They almost couldnt get the planes in and out, and you had to pull your boat motor up before the dock or you'd bottom out. If you want a walleye trip on a private lake with no one around, Id recommend it. Cabin was beautiful, lake was a great size. If you want to catch pike, stop at Lake Champlain on the way and save yourself the extra 8 hours of driving, with 4 hours of **** on that dirt road. Again, thanks to the guys on this page. With the exception of the fishing, my trip was flawless and it was because of your help."
6237872,fishron,2018-08-26 17:08:00,317,"Thanks for the report, thunder. I never fished Charlotte but fished Hebert three years in a row. They're only a short distance apart but you would need a blood transfusion if you tried to walk the distance. I've never fished more than half a day for pike on Hebert but I know there are some big ones due to having walleye picked up by pike and never being able to budge the fish to the surface. Charlotte has produced big pike and I don't think there kept. Could be the time of the season. The Gouin produces many huge pike and may be your best bet for trophy fish. I too hate the drive in on gravel for hours although it's much better than other washboard gravel roads I've traveled. Glad you had good walleye action and experienced the great service Air Tamarac delivers."
6237886,Thunderpants Johnson,2018-08-26 17:27:00,18,"I did have one huge pike grab a 12"" walleye I had. I fought him for about 3 minutes until he finally let go. The walleye was shredded"
6238000,Mike Borger,2018-08-27 06:31:00,1554,"Sorry to hear about your disappointment finding and catching larger pike. Charlotte is a very small lake, usually larger bodies of water have higher trophy potential, even remote fly in lakes. Also time of year. Unless you're talking far flung trophy pike waters in the far north, finding and catching trophy pike is most often a seasonal thing: Best early in the season when they're stacked in the spawning bays."
6238254,vteye3,2018-08-27 13:12:00,496,I am surprised Outfitter placed you on Charlotte rather than Gouin? I reread your post sounds like you asked for pike and were placed on walleye water.
6238978,Thunderpants Johnson,2018-08-29 10:43:00,18,"Thats what I was thinking. I mean, I really loved the idea of having a cabin on a private lake, but not enough to trade the fishing for it. I was pretty specific when I said I wanted to fish for pike"
6239350,Doublelung76,2018-08-30 07:35:00,42,"Big pike are caught at Charlotte every year.sounds like weather,time of year and lake conditions might have been a factor.definetly better pike fishing at Charlotte than Hebert.2 husband and wife couples flew out of Charlotte before we flew in to hebert,they caught 500 walleye and biggest pike was 52""."
