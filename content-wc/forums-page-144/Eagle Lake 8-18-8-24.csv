6237674,Remi,2018-08-26 07:04:00,41,"Returned home yesterday, fished out of Cedar Point Lodge for the past week. Each day we traveled to Portage Bay or the Big Water (Nash Bay and further). Jig and Minnow, caught walleye in 19 to 31 feet. Best was 26 to 31 feet. Find a reef and move around until you mark fish, then started fishing. It was a slow bite all week, you needed a very slow jig motion or just dragging jigs was equally as good, most fish would just grab and hold the jig, you wouldn't get much of a hit. 3 guys fishing 8-10 hours per day, finished the week with 442 walleye, 3 perch, 2 northern. Our numbers were about the same last year. Biggest walleye was 22 inches, the last day each guy in the boat caught 4 slot fish, so finished on a high note. I can't say enough about the staff at Cedar Point Lodge, very friendly and helpful. My uncle is 65 years old with health issues, and always a helping hand at the dock to help steady things as he gets in and out of the boat, they treat you like family. Wonderful trip, great memories. Thanks, Remi."
