I didn't even know it was still open.The rates are pretty attractive, but be forewarned - the location is on Eleanor Lake and it is a pretty healthy boat ride (5 or 6 miles) from there to Sabaskong Bay and you will have to navigate wide open water every time you go out ...wind could be a major factor if you are staying there.The location itself is very sheltered so and I am guessing launching and docking wouldn't be a problem. See the photo below for the actual location...it is on the blue patch just under the the first Â‘o' in the word Morson.https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...fd9af5bad7.pngFrank"
