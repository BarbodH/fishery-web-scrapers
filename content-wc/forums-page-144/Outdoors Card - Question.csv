6239828,wmd,2018-08-31 09:51:00,388,IMHO it is a fund raiser for the Ontario MNR. wmd
6239856,btyreprich,2018-08-31 11:30:00,1067,"Kind of thought so! Just the same, I LOVE fishing in Ontario so the cost of the card doesn't mean that much to me."
6240112,kzoofisher,2018-09-01 12:36:00,5144,I think the purpose of the card is to give you an identity with the MNR so that if you buy a different kind of license in the future they already have your info registered and you don't have to fill it in again. Why that ID needs to be separate from the license I'm not sure. I buy a three year fishing license when I renew my card and that gives me an all in one package. It goes in a zip lock baggie along with my passport and then into a zipper pouch on one of my tackle bags. I'll be ready if I ever get stopped by the MNR.
6238016,Bill Krejca,2018-08-27 07:10:00,6107,"See if we can still up a little conversation this morning: A friend misplaced his Outdoors Card, which was still not expired. He started to apply for a new non res. license, realized he needed the number on the card. He got the number from the nice folks on the 1-800 number which he then used to create a new license for use in a few weeks. He was told he could get a replacement card by seeing someone in Vermilion Bay, which we intend to do on the way up. I am just curious why he would need a duplicate card when the card number is on his license,the old card is not expired, and not sure why any one (officer) would ask for the card. Any ideas? Also do most readers carry the card around with them along with the license and has anyone ever asked to see the card when showing the license? Seems redundant. Seems redundant. Thanks, Bill"
6238024,pjshorthorn,2018-08-27 07:15:00,5654,"Bill, My recollection is that your buddy would be fine since the Outdoors Card number is printed on his license. I can't imagine a CO would have a problem with it just being on the license vs. having the actual card on his person. PjShorthorn"
6238028,djk50164,2018-08-27 07:22:00,370,"For Non-Canadian Residents, a complete and valid licence to fishconsists of an Outdoors Card or a Temporary Outdoors Cardaccompanied by a valid fishing licence tag for non-Canadianresidents. The Outdoors Card is a plastic, wallet-sized card valid forthree calendar years and used for identification and administrationpurposes. The licence tag is carried either as a document separatefrom the Outdoors Card or printed on the back of the card when thelicence tag and Outdoors Card are purchased or renewed at the sametime. Note: Outdoors Cards are not required with 1-day licences.Interpret how you would like but the way I read you need the card or temporary card. I'm assuming the CO reads it the same, as far as what they do is unknown."
6238046,BornToFish,2018-08-27 07:38:00,1224,"Greetings,My wife and I were stopped at a ""fish check"" two weekends ago, on our way home from Red Lake. We were asked to produce our licenses and Outdoor Cards.The MNR and OPP officers were very courteous, while at the same time being highly professional in their conduct.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6238054,rockape,2018-08-27 07:53:00,215,"I lost my outdoors card about 5 years ago, and it had another year or so before it expired. I called the 800 number, and they were totally cool. They mailed me a new one, and I don't think they charged me anything. Or...they may have made me pay the $10 or so and extended my expiration date. Not sure, but it was easy and they didn't screw me. I always carry both my card and my license 24x7 when in Canada. It is obvious I am a hardcore fisherman even when on land!"
6238070,Bill Krejca,2018-08-27 08:10:00,6107,"Thanks, folks. It just seems strange that while the card doesn't reach the owner until some time after applied for, it is OK not have it, due to the info being on the license,but later on the card must be in possession. I guess the grace period only extends from the time it takes to process the card and for the owner to receive it. I believe my new card arrived this summer just days before I left to go up. I'll just place the situation in the ""eye wink"" category and forge onward. Bill"
6238360,mr.crampster,2018-08-27 17:18:00,18,I believe that most of these cards and licenses are done online. You print out your temporary Outdoors card and printout your license. You are mailed a permanent outdoors card. You keep your printed out license. My permanent card was here in a couple weeks. Your temp card will due until the permanent one is delivered. Mr. cram
6238506,LOWrider,2018-08-28 06:35:00,40,"I agree with the original comment that it is redundant, I expect the reason is to be able to charge a small fee for the outdoors card every few years. This money likely goes to a different part of MNR and it is easier to justify and charge a different fee than move the money on the books. In WI & MN I presume the same kind of fee is charged, it is just buried inside of license costs, you don't see it as a direct fee to have your identification number. So in the end it is more about how the bureaucracy works than anything. Not really a huge deal, just more stuff to keep track of. When the kids were little and we were responsible for all their stuff, I remember having a pile of paperwork! Not so bad for just the two of us now. Agree with the comments about MNR being professional. Last Nov. after a late fishing / duck hunting trip we were driving back home and were pulled over near FF. Thought I was speeding (maybe just a little!). Since I was pulling a Bankes duck hunting boat the MNR guys wanted to have a look, and they checked everything over and we had a good talk. They even gave me their business card in case I ever had a question and wanted to give them a call."
6239214,eyemike,2018-08-29 19:21:00,233,"I was also stopped at a fish check just south of Red Lake on Aug. 18th. The officer asked for our licenses, I gave him our online copies. He wrote down our names, and numbers into a notebook, checked our fish and sent us on our way. Never asked for the Outdoor card."
6239630,btyreprich,2018-08-30 18:21:00,1067,Exactly what is the purpose of the Outdoors card? I understand the fishing license which contains basically the same information right? Just wondering.
