1476632,Skiball,2012-08-19 17:00:00,82,Thanks for the info. Iwas able to find them on Ebay for around 1.50 and direct through Gapen @ 1.85 to 2.50 each. Nice to use either with minnows or crawler harness.
1476692,Skillzilla,2012-08-19 18:58:00,65,x2 Lund1993 I also prefer the stick-style weights over bb's and 3way swivels. But in snaggy areas I run 3ways. THX SKZ
1474030,joeman79,2012-08-12 19:33:00,417,"Just got back from Lac Seul early this morning and jig fished most of the time. When it got real windy we pulled some BB and spinners and did really well. But we had a heck of a time with the spinner harnesses getting terribly twisted up once in awhile. How do you remedy that? I even put Sampo Ball Bearing swivels on and it still did it. Was I going to fast? Any ideas??? Thanks, Joe"
1474055,Gregking,2012-08-12 20:21:00,2658,"I just got back from witch bay camp and we ran BB most all the time. I sometimes get tangled if I am backing up to slow down a drift or most often let the line down to fast. I don't undo the bail, I run it down with the crank at a controlled speed to catch own eye that way. Also make sure your BB isn't flipped over your swivel before you start. How long of spinner rig do you use? I run 18-24"". Going to fast won't cause your rig problem unless I guess you weight is to light and you run over your line then it might I guess."
1474110,GreatWhiteNorth517,2012-08-13 00:24:00,286,I refuse to spend $6.99 apiece on the Northlands when I can mold my own straight/slip bouncers for pennies.
1474125,KHedquist,2012-08-13 04:48:00,4367,"Check out the Fin Tech Tech Bouncer, they have a Double R bend to keep the line from sliding pretty cool and simple idea, and they have a quick change weight, the weight slides on and off quick and locks in place."
1474131,northernbite,2012-08-13 05:46:00,1186,You have pmPaul
1474332,new hips,2012-08-13 12:55:00,498,"I only use Fireline/ with a florocarbon leader.....no twist.....good swivels also. You might possibly be to light on your weight. Anything over 20-25ft , I use 1.5 oz sometimes 2oz. Main line makes huge difference, with water resistance. I've had many walleye over 23in with 6lb Fireline, It's almost impossible to break. If you have a ton of line out your probably rolling or dragging your BB. Casting reel with open bail constantly watch your locator for ups and downs and reel in accordingly. Ease the BB down maintaining thumb pressure on the baitcaster when lowering it."
1475069,sidewinder,2012-08-15 07:28:00,96,"eagle claw twin pack hard to lose because you tie directly to bouncer, makes it as strong as your line"
1475601,James Morris,2012-08-16 13:02:00,544,That's my bet. Also might help to switch to a stiffer line like fluoro or XT (if you're not already using it).
1476575,Skiball,2012-08-19 14:32:00,82,Anyone using Gapens bouncers with the spinners and are you having any luck?
1476629,JayM5209,2012-08-19 16:52:00,1050,"Seems like years and years ago, but when they first came on the market I started using them. Still have a few in a tackle box somewhere. They are certainly my favorite type of BB, but they've gotten a little pricey over the years and other styles can be had for less $$. For lots of years my tackle box was well stocked with 1/4, 3/8, and 1/2 oz. Gapens, with just a few 3/4 and 1 oz. just in case. Man, that shade of orange brings back lots of memories of 'eyes caught pulling home-tied spinners behind 'em!"
1470528,pat_in_rhinelander,2012-08-04 14:21:00,3,"I usually go to Canada twice a year, fly-ins and drive-to destinations. My group varies from 2-8 people. While our destination and attendees may vary, one constant is our bottom bouncers.After 10-12 years of trial and error we believe that Cabela's two ounce bottom bouncers work best for us. We like the Cabelas's brand because they have the ""full circle"" connection point, and the stiffness of the wire is ideal; with some other brands the wire is stiffer which can break, not bend. Color is less important, but I prefer orange. Weight is critical. For the most part, we fish is 6-30 feet of water where the 2 oz. bouncer excels. Any deeper (which is rare for us), and we'll go to 3 oz. Any shallower (3-10 feet in May) and we'll go to one oz. Line and connector are also important. We use 20 lb. Fireline. It is strong enough to never break, unless we are severely snagged and can't pull it out. This happens, but is very rare. Most snags can be retrieved by going backwards, beyond the point where it is snagged. Many years I've fished all week and not lost a single bottom bouncer after fishing 5 days, 10 hours per day. The connectors we use are also from Cabela's; Norman Lures Speed Clips (Muskie/Pike size). It is important to avoid using standard swivels, they tangle more easily. For rod and reels we all prefer bait casters with a flippin switch, which makes one-handed operation very easy. For rods, we prefer softer 6.5-7' moderate action.We make our own snells, and once again prefer Fireline (14 lb. smoke colored). The 14 lb. Fireline works fine for walleyes and can withstand the occassional northern without a break-off."
1470548,kevplow,2012-08-04 16:06:00,9,"I've only historically fished crawler harnesses while in Canada since that's what the others in the group prefer, and we like the ""walking sinkers"". The downfall is that they cannot be switched without cutting your line. I'll use 8lb mono, slip on the walking weight (typically 3/4 oz), then a snap swivel, then my harness. Seems to work well most of the time, but will get caught up on occassion of it's really rocky. My co-worker gave me some lindy no-snags and some homemade pencil weights this year to try...both of which I believe can be changed out for different sizes without cutting my line. He also suggested using Fireline rather than mono, so I can get significantly deeper without adding anymore weight. Never fished anything but mono before, so I'm excited to give that a try this year."
1470559,lcwhit,2012-08-04 17:07:00,104,bing or google bottom bouncing as i know it by phil rolfe. everything you need to know.
1470659,JayM5209,2012-08-04 22:18:00,1050,"I use ""walking sinkers"" a lot and rig them so I can change size without cutting and retying. Run your main line through the swivel of a duolock snap swivel, add a small bead, and tie your usual snap or snap/swivel that the crawler harness attaches to. Put your walking sinker on the duolock snap and it is free to slide on the main line.The only time I've used a BB larger than 1 oz. is when fishing for lakers. Most often I have a 3/8, 1/2, or 3/4 oz. on. I also rarely fish deeper than 20'. If the 'eyes are deeper than that, I'm drifting and can get to 45'-50' with an ounce. My standard BB line is 10# or 12# Trilene XL. Works for me!"
1470910,bigdaddyguns,2012-08-05 16:27:00,608,We used the 2oz Northland Slick-Stick bottom bouncers last week with great success. Caught walleyes and did not lose one to the rocks. We were able to finagle them out if they got hung up. Also I second the recommendation to use bouncers with a complete ring at the attachment point. We started out using the L-shaped bouncers but they continually were being misaligned by contact with rocks causing more inspection time out of the water. We went to the slick sticks and never looked back.
1471215,Manitou,2012-08-06 09:29:00,125,"I use 2oz l-shaped, but often pull a small lipped crankbait around fairly quickly until I find fish. I'll start shallow and work my way out to deep water, 60' and back, zigzagging along the contour."
1473470,btmbncr,2012-08-10 23:18:00,492,"I use the single shaft bouncer ""lite"" or slip bouncer.They snag way less than the r shaped bouncers.I make my own I have fromn 1 oz to 3 oz.bouncers.I mostly used 1 1/2 oz on my trip to Lac Seul.I can fish this weight fron 5 ft of water to 35 ft of water.Heavier bouncetrs are better in deep water but I can slid out deep and check with that weight if I need to.I have fished bouncers for close to 30 years.It's second nature to me now.This last trip it was an eye opener fishing with my new bride,the questions she had about what I was doing and why.Like how I fish the bouncer,ie touch bottom then lift,touch ,lift,touch,lift,how long between touching depends on how aggressive the bite is etc.Telling the difference in bottom content,going from gravel to sand,sand to mud,changes in rock etc.Showing and explaining this really changed how much she snagged up,number of bites and hooking ratio.It all went way up.She can fish bouncers with the best of them now.Bill"
1473500,wallydave,2012-08-11 06:09:00,2151,"Thank you for the replies! I have some new methods to try now for next years trip! I like jigging but I want to try bottom bouncers too! With my wife in the boat sitting and jigging would get boring after a while, for sightseeing exploring and still getting some fishing in trolling and trying my hand at bottom bouncers will be the plan for next June!! Keep the reports coming!!"
1473515,northernbite,2012-08-11 06:52:00,1186,"I use 3-ways; 1oz, down 14 to 16 inches, some like them longer, and my worm harness about 4 foot behind. this works very well for me. I feel I can sense the rocks better than with boncers. It takes time to get adjusted to them but I don't like how a bouncer works.Paul"
1473588,wallydave,2012-08-11 09:36:00,2151,I have used three way swivels before trolling for lake trout. I found a Linders youtube the other day trolling three ways for walleyes! This next trip I hope to try some new stuff andy some new area's on the mighty Lac!!
1470161,wallydave,2012-08-03 12:50:00,2151,"In the past my trips have been late May and early June, perfect for jigging, now that we take later trips, mid June, I need to add trolling bottom bouncers to my methods of fishing. So, fellow walleye hunters, which ones, weight,color, and company work the best? Thanks!"
1470167,Lovetofish,2012-08-03 13:19:00,458,A 1/2 or 3/4 chain sinker with a spinner works great. But the chain sinkers are expensive unless you make your own. So I use 1/2 or 3/4 slip sinker and tie on a swivel. The 1/2 is plenty of weight unless it's windy.
1470183,wallydave,2012-08-03 13:47:00,2151,I was wondering if a three way swivel would work too! Lots of time to check things out! Keep the ideas coming!
1470192,Wall-i-Lama,2012-08-03 13:58:00,1524,"Dave, We moved to the Northland Slick Sticks this year and had good success on LOTW using 3 oz sticks and pulling crawler rigs. I have used a lot of different kinds of bouncers, but have to say the Northlands are tangle/twist free, come off of snags easy and provide good feel with the bottom. Because the line slips thru the stick, you have more of a direct feel with the spinner and its easier to tell when you've picked up weeds or have small bites. Kinda like a lindy rig/bottom bouncer combo. Wish I would have invented these Good luck!"
1470198,wallydave,2012-08-03 14:12:00,2151,"Just to add to the thread, what type of line works best? I have been a flouro guy in the past now slowly going to braid on more of the reels!"
1470209,Lund1993,2012-08-03 14:39:00,141,I use fireline that way I can pull my snags out whenever I get hung up. I use fluorocarbon for my crawler harness because it is almost invisible to the fish and makes a very strong knot.
1470217,adempsey,2012-08-03 14:52:00,963,"IMO, for the most part the only difference between various BB is the quality of the swivel used and if it has an ""R-bend"" or a complete circle where the line attaches. So if you get cheap ones you may want to change the swivel and for the ""complete circle"" style it has been suggested that your line may get caught and sliced. Hasn't happened to me, but most of mine are the R-bend type.I doubt color matters, but one can argue the bright colors may attract fish from a distance.On the other hand, pencil weights are also good and avoid both those problems. I actually converted a bunch of my bouncers to pencil weights by cutting off one of the arms and attaching a Mustad Slida (basically a hollow plastic tube with a clip on it). I also picked up some of the Slick Stiks, but haven't managed to try them yet."
1470227,Yarhcaz,2012-08-03 15:24:00,1389,"I have tried virtually all of them (at least I think so). Truth be known, I do not care for using, them but they sure work. I would suggest just buying bulk models that are not painted. The big question is whether you want a ""stick"" bouncer or an upside down ""L"" bouncer. The stick bouncers can be used in a similiar fashion to lindy rigging while the L bouncers can not. I currently use L bouncers but when I get a new boat (center rod locker) I will be changing to quick change stick bouncers."
1470242,Jigger1,2012-08-03 16:06:00,234,"To me it's all about the snell. I use Cabela's snelled bait leaders which are 15lb fluorocarbon with Gamakatsu red hooks. I use them because it's easy and I don't want to be blaming myself for a bad knot I tied if I lose a big fish. I then have a terminal box filled with beads, blades, clevis's and more so I can create the perfect colored harness. I only use quick change clevis's so I can change blades on the fly if I don't like what's going on. As it relates to the actual bouncer, my go to is a plain 3/4oz. I'll jump to 1oz if we're moving fast or going deep. I own some colored bouncers, but I've never really understood the need for coloring the weight. In my opinion I want the walleye focused on the blade and bait. If the bouncer has an open R-bend, I twist them closed. I prefer Colorado blades in size 4 or 5 and my go to is live or Gulp crawlers. Last but not least I tie on a barrel swivel to the harness. This allows me to quickly swap out harnesses if they get nicked or I catch a pike that tears one up. When I'm bouncing you'll know how good the fishing is by how many spent snells are under my feet. I match this up with a G Loomis Walleye Series Model WBR813C topped off with a Quantum reel with a flippin switch. This allows you to let out line by depressing the switch and then it immediately engages so you can maintain a tight line at all times. I just loaded my reel last night with Power Pro so this will be my first time using a super line on the bottom bouncer. I have historically used 17lb fluorocarbon so the snell would break and not the main line if snagged. That's about it, Good luck!"
1470252,SinOrSwim,2012-08-03 17:01:00,1528,"We always go in the late August or September and use predominantly the cabelas brand rigs. I have all the colors but use silver almost 90+% of the time. Hammered silver. I will use gold once in awhile but I have had the best luck with silver.I also use the Lindy snagless sinkers or the Norhtland rocker runner slip bouncers. I like those because you can use the quick release snap on piece to change weights quickly. Plus, they are cheaper than the lindy snagless and do the same thing. We pretty much use spinner rigs the whole time with fireline."
