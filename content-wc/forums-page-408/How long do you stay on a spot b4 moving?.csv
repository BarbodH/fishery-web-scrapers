1476215,SinOrSwim,2012-08-18 08:53:00,1528,"Just curious if people have a certain time limit they will fish a spot before moving if nothing is hitting? Or, after it turns off? Play it by ear or a number of passes etc?I think I tend to stay on a spot longer than I probably should if I have caught fish there before.We mainly use lindy rigs and minnows whether back trolling or drifting depending on wind."
1476223,bigdaddyguns,2012-08-18 09:21:00,608,For a newer lake that I am learning I give it 15-20 minutes. That is enough time to make a few passes over the location and see what the bottom and weed composition is for that area and if fish are present. If I am marking fish but no action I will place it on a list to try again at a later time with perhaps a different presentation. I will then try the next spot looking for an active bite while learning the lake a little better. Hopefully after trying multiple spots you will find some success and begin establishing a pattern you can build upon.
1476252,dan cardinal,2012-08-18 11:14:00,64,"I tend to do the samething...stay on a spot too long. My problem, an hour on the water can go by like 10 minutes. However, I think if you are marking fish, 15 to 20 minutes...30 minutes max is sufficient time to determine if you have active fish or not. But this would be another suggestion... attempt a couple presentations before leaving. I normally have much success marking fish then working them with a controlled back troll...even in windy conditions. But at the sametime, I have seen situations where I could work a spot with this presentation and not get bit until I started the drift back over the same spot. Obviously the opposite applies too. I love those days when all is required is to get it in front of them. But considering how walleye are positioned in relation to the conditions, the presentation, and the speed of presentation is often very critical to getting bit."
1476315,BenBeattie,2012-08-18 18:17:00,232,"Depends if I'm trophy hunting or looking for volume. Trophy hunting I'll stay a half an hour on a high confidence spot, looking for 1 bite. If I'm trying to just catch fish it's about 10 mins max with no bite before I leave. Trust your electronics. Scan spots first, find some fish before you drop your lines. Saves a lot of time looking for fish. my .02 c"
1476342,black white face,2012-08-18 20:07:00,1072,DependsA. If allot of activity on the sonar. I will usually stay and fish and change bait until I catch what I see on sonarB. if none of the above works.. 20 mins I move onC. I usually search with electronics before I fish a new spot.. I trust them to the nth degree.
1476864,81Saluki,2012-08-20 09:16:00,97,"To everyone who explicitly trusts their electronics, I tip my hat to you. Over the past 20-ish years we've bought several different brands/models and none worked to our satisfaction. As far as we're concerned, they're just a glorified depth-finder. After our last purchase we learned a lot about the ""transducer cone"". Since we mainly fish the same lakes/spots in 10 - 20 feet of water, the maximum area shown is less than the width of our Lund Pro-V (3.5' wide in 10 FOW; 7' wide in 20 FOW). So a few years ago I bought an underwater video camera. AWESOME!! Visual trumps virtual every time! :-) Regarding the question at hand If we don't get a bite within roughly 10 minutes* we'll drop the camera down to see if any fish are around. Can't tell you how many times we believed fish ""should"" be there, but weren't. And then there were other times when the fish were there but wouldn't bite no matter what we threw at 'em. * NOTE: Our tolerance depends on the size of the spot. A hump or hole might get 10 minutes whereas a 50-yard swath along a shoreline might get 30+ minutes."
1476888,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-20 10:07:00,235,"Usually with no bite in 10 minutes, we are outta there. The thing I always wonder about is whether there might be active fish just another 100 feet away downwind from you. It seems like when we move, we are always motoring to somewhere that is at least a half mile away or longer. What if just moving a little farther off your current spot was all it would've taken? That's fishing, I suppose - once you lose confidence, you want to reshuffle the deck."
1476891,Mike Kansas,2012-08-20 10:17:00,1463,I also try several different depths when I'm marking fish on a spot. With special effort on any drop offs or depth changes in the structure. Mike Kansas
1476893,drlee,2012-08-20 10:20:00,409,"It really depends on the total area of the ""spot"" I am fishing. Some of the reefs I fish are really large, so I move around until I find active fish...could take as much as an hour. Smaller spots? I will give it 20-30 minutes max; but, I do drift the area from a couple of different angles. I rarely change baits (most I fish jigs or little joe spinners to troll). I am not a big color guy. I have a really good, but not really expensive, locator. I use it to check depths, or course. Also, I can identify clouds of bait fish. Even if the walleyes are not visible or biting, I may fish an area where bait fish are present a little longer than usual. I recognize that the cone is pretty small: However, I do pay attention to whether or not I see walleyes on the screen. I am familiar enough with the reefs I fish that I know where they typically hang out. If I check a couple of key spots and there are no fish, I'm gone. I fish a 10,000 acre lake in late July and the walleyes are typically on the reefs or mid lake humps. I have about 20 areas on my gps so its pretty easy to explore and find active fish. The lake I fish in mid June, the fish are still around points, rocky, wind swept shorelines, etc. So, I don't really depend on the locator to do more than get me to the right depths. Geez, I love to hunt for walleyes. (BTW, I use marker bouys A LOT after I locate some fish.)"
