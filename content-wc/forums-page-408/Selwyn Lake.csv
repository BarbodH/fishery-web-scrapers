Did you here the term 9 mile and 11 mile fishing hole at all. Would like to know where these are on the main lake or the river? Thanks

Had another big pike to the boat and got off.fished walleyes most of the time.heard of the spots u mentioned and am sure they are up the river.we didn't go up the river but wished we would have.cabins are very nice. We will be back.words of advice though be careful with rocks in the lake. We were trolling and out of nowhere we scraped an unexposed rock."
