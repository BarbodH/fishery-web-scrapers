1430377,Larry S,2012-05-03 19:12:00,665,"Icwhit,I Love Deep Dish Pizza,it a meal within itself.It a personal preference. I also like a good thin crust pizza Rivratz, I have eaten at Boston Pizza in Kenora many times,its ok,but not a Lou's Larry S"
1433817,Kevin R,2012-05-10 18:39:00,305,"I grew up near Lou's in Lincolnwood il very good pizza but not my favorite. A place in ingleside il called Fanellas pizza is the one we like best. Lots of good pizza both in and around Chicago & Wisconsin couple other places Guzzardos in Lincoln il, Ida's in Wisconsin Rapids & The Woodbine near Necedah wi. Many other great places but these are all favorites of ours. I live in Florida pizza is mostly NY style I hardly eat pizza in Florida."
1433999,Larry S,2012-05-11 08:16:00,665,"We have a Rosati's Pizza,from Chicago,they advertise chicago style pizza,fairly close to our house.We get pizza,thick & thin crust there.There is also an Aurelio's who is also from Chicago,but its on the other side of town."
1434131,Mohleye,2012-05-11 12:51:00,368,"Octane, My daughter and her husband took me to Frank Pepe's in New Haven when we were driving from Boston-NYC last month when I was visiting. That is some very good pizza, and a pretty incredible brick oven."
1475987,wallydave,2012-08-17 14:48:00,2151,"The other day my wife, who will be making her first trip North with me next year said, well its ten months to go until we are at Goose Bay! Thanks to google I have shown her the usual stops we make on the trip! This years trip we ate at Boston Pizza in Fort Frances Friday night after we crossed the border. We had a couple of great pizza's and the beer was good and cold too! A nice salad made for a great meal! Next June we'll be stopping for pizza again!"
1476232,nitrodude,2012-08-18 10:01:00,60,"Between Chicago visits I'll call the 800 number (in title) to get my fix of Malnati's. It's almost like being there! Another one to try in the Arlington Heights/Des Plaines area is Jake's Pizza. Their BBQ pizza is 'DA BOMB! When I'm crossing the Canada border I prefer the In'l Falls side and The Border Bar. Try one of Ms. Ethel's Stickman pizzas and you will be pleasantly satisfied, if not amazed! Dangit!! Now I gotta go get me a pizza!!"
1476257,wallydave,2012-08-18 11:23:00,2151,"Yea we have had pizza there too, we cross on Friday night, so we just like to settle in Fort Frances for the night. Both are good, we didn't want to have a couple of beers before we crossed the border!? Playin it safe!"
1429871,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-05-02 17:26:00,84,We eat at Boston Pizza on the way home in Madison. Have been doing it for about 5 or 6 years now. Food is good and the waitresses sure look good after a week in the bush.
1429893,Jahloaf,2012-05-02 18:15:00,74,We ate at the Boston Pizza in Ft Frances last year and will again this year on June 1st. They got pretty good chow and its a sports bar atmosphere. I was impressed with their hot wings sample platter last year.Its much better then the grub at the Adventure Inn were we are staying cause the Super 8 was booked. Yea the AI is a dump but its walking distance to the Boston Pizza and we like that cause our tradition is crossing on Friday night to get 'acclumated' to the Canadian beer.
1429904,adempsey,2012-05-02 18:37:00,963,"Horrible restaurant chain. If you have other options, I'd go with that. Of course, there might not be much better options in the area you're visiting."
1429906,v-bay gord,2012-05-02 18:52:00,3168,Gee....I've never had a bad meal at one. Maybe they are better in the NW.!
1429907,bigwalleye1,2012-05-02 18:53:00,2632,"That doesn't take much....If that's the mark, anyplace'll do....."
1430047,octanehi5,2012-05-03 06:09:00,1104,Its hard to get excited about pizza somewhere else I live 7 miles from Wooster st New Haven Ct.
1430107,Rivratz,2012-05-03 08:02:00,105,"Sorry guys, Lived in Chi Town for 50 years! Once you've eaten Chicago Deep Dish Pizza, nothing else can come close, except for NY style. Sorry New York, still in second place. Order a cheeseburger & fries."
1430152,Larry S,2012-05-03 09:11:00,665,"I'll second what Rivratz says. I was born and raised in Chi Town, left after 51 years for Las Vegas Everytime I go back I always hit my favorite pizza place Lou Malnati's in Lincolnwood for a large deep dish pizza.I even bring several frozen pizzas back for the wife"
1430322,lcwhit,2012-05-03 16:53:00,104,"i've had chitown style pizza. too doughy. i like thin crust. when we went to bostons in fort francis, we had one appetizer, a large pizza, a couple of those small pitchers and one or two small salads. 4 guys. i picked up the tab and it cost me 80-90 bucks with tip. there are certainly cheaper options around. nice enuf place though."
1430342,Rivratz,2012-05-03 17:45:00,105,"Larry S, Lou's is my favorite also! Elk Grove! Nothing wrong with Giordano's either! Icwhit, need the dough to hold 4 plus pounds of cheese, sauce, and the other goodies, fully loaded! It's hard to order pizza in strange lands when your used to the finest made! Pizza blows in Colorado. They try, but... If your from Maine, don't order lobster in Mn. By the way, the Holiday Inn in Int'l Falls has a really good dinner menu and makes fabulous Wild Rice soup. Some of the best I've ever had! When I used to go that way I stayed there, AAA discount, eat breakfast at the Chocolate Moose early, and never waited long at all at the border to cross."
1429634,wallydave,2012-05-02 08:38:00,2151,"Has anyone tried Boston Pizza in Fort Frances? We are staying just down Kings Hiway from there, and wondered if the food is any good? We like to cross the border on Friday, usually less waiting. Any reviews would be great! Thanks!"
1429672,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-02 09:43:00,1460,"Wallydave, My outfitter told me last year that Boston Pizza is the place they like to go. The locals around there think very highly of the place. So yes it is an option. Personally, I think that the Harborage is a fun place to eat. It is pretty much a cafe with a diverse menu that has the traditional local flair. You just can't beat the view of Rainy Lake from either the Harborage of the Rendezvous. I think the Harborage has the best poutine around. But once I cross the border and get a big giant whiff of the beautiful smell of Ft. Francis, I morph into my alter ego. That guy is only interested in obtaining Cuban cigars and leeches. Also as quartermaster, I do my cross border shopping for fresh produce, dairy and of course good ole Canadian coffee. Pizza just isn't part of the program."
1429683,@Lunker,2012-05-02 10:10:00,835,Boston Pizza in Kenora has very good food.
1429699,wallydave,2012-05-02 10:42:00,2151,"Last year I took a first timer to Ontario, he was, shall we say less than impressed with his first views of Canada!!! Yea the smell of FF can help with anyones desire to eat! We are going to stay at the Rainbow, so the Harbor would be out of the way, we have a 12 hour drive so we just want to get a bite, have a few beers and try to get some sleep, hard to do when you are dreaming of hitting the Lac to find the ""eyes!! Part of our group is a family with a couple of boys along, they might like pizza, so do I!! Until recently I had never heard of poutine before, guess there is still plenty to learn about our northern cousins!! All part of the experiance, trying the local food, beer and cigars!!Thanks for the update!!"
1429710,Terwalleye,2012-05-02 10:57:00,166,"Our group does the same thing, crossing on Friday night. Ate there last year and enjoyed it. Just not used to $30 pitchers of beer. Course that did not stop us from ordering another. Go there, you wont be dissapointed"
1429713,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-02 11:03:00,1460,"That makes perfect sense! When ya get back, I for one would be interested in your culinary experience. Boston Pizza sounds like a great option for your group. Hope you guys rip em up on the Lac."
1429725,v-bay gord,2012-05-02 11:27:00,3168,"Boston Pizza is a lot more than just pizza. Some great items on the menu, and the beer is cold. Consider it a great restaurant that just happens to serve pizza. More information at this website... www.bostonpizza.com"
1429784,wallydave,2012-05-02 13:55:00,2151,"Gord, I have checked out the site, I really like in nutritional info and they offer more than just pizza on the menu!"
1429804,Skidoo600homxz,2012-05-02 14:38:00,37,"Try the Rendezvous or Kettles, both have great food."
1429858,lcwhit,2012-05-02 16:45:00,104,decent pizza. pretty pricey. nice place. lots of young locals. kind of a sports bar atmosphere.
