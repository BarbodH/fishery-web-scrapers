1476238,SinOrSwim,2012-08-18 10:13:00,1528,"Search this site. If I remember right those trak maps are like 5 feet wide? There is another link to differnt maps. But, they are all in sections. NW, SW etc.3 weeks from today I will be fishing finally. 2nd year at Lac Seul and 2nd year with Onaway. REally liked it last year. Had done fly-ins for about 15+ years prior."
1476246,rommel,2012-08-18 10:51:00,369,will i need to buy all four sections of the maps would think that we probably wont cover the whole lake in one week planning on just concentrating on sw/nw sections
1476249,WalleyeWally28,2012-08-18 11:05:00,298,You can buy whatever sections you are interested in. The NW and SW sections should more than cover you. Right now the thread about the best LS maps is on page 10 of this board.
1476250,SinOrSwim,2012-08-18 11:05:00,1528,"Yeah, considering the lake is like 120 miles long, no way to cover the whole thing. Here is a link to a thread I started awhile back. There are two links from JDP on the first page.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...t=Lac+Seul+map"
1476361,rather-be-fishin,2012-08-18 21:03:00,429,MorganMan ~ Yes that's and fact and I live close by too and it's NOT Sawmill on Lac Seul! LOL
1476364,rather-be-fishin,2012-08-18 21:08:00,429,"rommel ~ If your going the Dryden route, there is Tony's Bait Shop/ICO gas station on the left side right across the bridge over Wabigoon by the Paper plant when you first come into Dryden. They have excellent water proof maps of Lac Seul NW & SW section. Good luck and I'm sure you will have a FANTASTIC TIME on Lac Seul! Maybe see you on the water! RBF"

1475724,MorganMan,2012-08-16 20:08:00,341,We have been once last year and are headed back again in 3 weeks! Hope to have a good report for ya then. I'm sure you will like Onaway.
1475975,Cash,2012-08-17 14:01:00,73,"I've been to Onaway Lodge several times, but only in June. Blair and Kathy run a nice camp. The cabins are among the best anywhere. Some of the best walleye fishing in all of Ontario on Lac Seul. (but I'm sure you already knew all that. Good Luck."
1475984,rommel,2012-08-17 14:33:00,369,thanks for the replies kinda wondering if were going to have to burn a lot of miles to get to quality fishing or if we can plan on just fishing that 1/4 of the lake never been to lac seul or to any lake this large closest in size ive fished is devils
1476101,wallydave,2012-08-17 20:00:00,2151,"Ive been interested in a trip to Onaway for sometime. It looks closer to Mackenzie Bay than my usual spot. My group might be falling apart, so my next couple trips might be my wife and I. Good luck and have a great trip!"
1476129,rather-be-fishin,2012-08-17 21:37:00,429,"Onaway is a good resort in a good location on Lac Seul. Good Fishing close by in Scout Bay and quick access to Bay of Island and McKenzie Bay. If it's your first time on Lac Seul it's is very worthwhile to hire a guide early in your trip to show you safe travel routes and fishing spots and techniques that are working that time of year. We go that same week to Fisherman's Cove resort close by to Onaway and haven't been disappointed ever! We primarily fish wind blown islands in Bay of Island and McKenzie Bay and also go to South Inlet. If it is real windy, we fish Scout Bay and have good luck right there too. We also had good luck on the reefs in McKenzie bay this year. We troll, drift & jig & primarily use 1/4 & 3/8 oz jigs or spinners with minnows, but this year also used some leaches and crawlers too. Another good person to contact is ""Steve of Madison"" on WC who goes to Onaway yearly and can offer great fishing tips! Count down is ON for next years trip back to Lac Seul! RBF"
1476144,MorganMan,2012-08-17 23:24:00,341,"Our trip last year was only 3 days on the water and late Sept. We hope to do better this year with a little more information and having been on the that part of the lake once. We did fish bay of islands, but spent no time in Scout bay....would like to know more about closer to home. Looking forward to getting back up there and getting another chance."
1476145,MorganMan,2012-08-17 23:25:00,341,"Oh, and rather-be-fishing gets to go to the Sawmill anytime he wants? What a positive!!"
