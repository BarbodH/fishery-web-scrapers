1474933,fishincrazy,2012-08-14 19:11:00,1282,You know it I figure if we can do 2 weeks we can pattern the fish and really catch some dandy eye's plus it will give us some time to do some quality smallmouth fishing!FC
1474934,fishincrazy,2012-08-14 19:12:00,1282,Thanks for the responses guy's!I'm already counting the day's till next year!FC
1475007,adempsey,2012-08-14 23:29:00,963,"Did the chef move on or just go on vacation? The year I went to GI they had no chef either and one of the other young staff members prepared all the meals. Food was reasonable, but not ""chef level""."
1475079,micropterus,2012-08-15 07:43:00,450,When I talked to Michael he did not plan to return next year. I sensed some tension between him and Joe. I'm not surprised if he left before the end of the season.
1475378,fishincrazy,2012-08-15 20:25:00,1282,"I don't know the story,I go for the fishing the food was always a bonus.I never fished there when Michael was there,I thought Val did a fine job.I'm sure the new cook will get all of his ducks in a row and be rocking on our next trip.I am already putting together the money and trying to pick a week when my son can go.As of now July is out he has summer stoch he wants to do.So it looks like hopefully the end of August for us.I wish I could go early but we have to much work in late may and June.I'd love to fish with another WC member!FC"
1475526,adempsey,2012-08-16 09:44:00,963,"I went in mid-August my first time there and the fishing was just as good as early July. So, you don't have to worry about the fishing...just the waiting =)BTW, did you manage to fish that island saddle between those islands near GI??"
1475755,fishincrazy,2012-08-16 21:47:00,1282,"Got a 30"" fish out of that hole!We used to go the 3rd week of August every year I like the later season cause the Smallies are up and the top water bite is off the hook!FC"
1473886,fishincrazy,2012-08-12 12:19:00,1282,"Well another year has gone and my trip north has come to a close.This was my son's first trip with my brother and I he must've enjoyed himself because he actually talked to me(16 year old).This year had plenty of firsts my first 30"" eye,my brother's first 32"" eye.This was the first year I can remember not being cold.This was the first year of Sleemans Clear my new favorite along with Crown Royal Black now that's some fine brown liquor there!My brother and I enjoyed our before dinner drink every evening!My son (did I mention he was 16?) Is the king of not listening.The first day was a bluebird day comfortable temps in the low 80's and he doesn't sun screen up properly.I figure he's 16 I just need to tell him to put it on well go figure Dad should know better.Of all places his hands specifically the backs of them burned.He had problems all week once this happened.By the end of the week we had borrowed gloves from the camp owner in an attempt to keep the sun off of them.This seemed to work,no amount of sunscreen helped after the initial burning.I'm thinking he might have had a comobonation of burn and allergic reaction to the sun screen.Now on to the fishing.This year we caught more fish in the 25"" to 32"" range then ever before.It was a finess bite using a red #6 Gamakatsu Octopus hook tied direct to our 6lb braid with 1-3 #7 split shot as weight.We hooked the crawler once through the head and gave em a little shot of air to get em off the bottom.We also had fish on my HGT Jig's mostly in Chartruse/orange color.My son's first Canadian walleye came on one of my jig's the first day!Here are some pictures of the fish and trip:FC"
1473891,fishincrazy,2012-08-12 12:48:00,1282,The weather was of course nice if you wanted NJ beach weather.Me I like rain and wind we had flat dead calm on at least 3 of the 6 days we fished.The trolling motor got a work out pushing us around.We did have one day with some big storms blowing.Everything was coming from the south so when we saw lighting we high tailed it to an island on the North side and guess what.......The wind changed.We where on a big rock facing north and we saw it coming across the water it was to late to move and our boat took a beating.FC
1473904,adempsey,2012-08-12 13:43:00,963,"Looks like you got into some nice fish! Did you bring up your own boat, or do they have trolling motors on them now??Thanks for putting together your report, was wondering how your trip went."
1473937,Bill Krejca,2012-08-12 15:26:00,6107,Nice fish! Bill
1474021,fishincrazy,2012-08-12 19:21:00,1282,Joe said Hello we bring up our own trolling motor and always a drift sock to battle the wind.I have more pictures but there on my son's Ipod and I cannot opreate it.It was a great week of fishing!We also got to see Norm and Val the old owners who's house is totally awesome.Norm said he remembered you and your Dad coming to Garden Island did you go when they owned it?Or was it Joe's first year and they where showing him the ropes?The cook Michael left the camp the week before we got there so the food wasn't what we hve had in the past other then that it was great.FC
1474023,fishincrazy,2012-08-12 19:23:00,1282,Thanks Bill! Here in Philly we don't get to fish fo big eye's there aren't really any of this size here so this trip is a life saver for me and my brother.FC
1474035,Pikeslayer8,2012-08-12 19:45:00,1460,"Sounds like you, Jerry and Jimmy III had a rip roaring trip. Big congrats in your 30""!!!!! Did ya have any shore lunches? Way to go Crazy, a trip like this one really helps tide over upcoming ""wish I was back up there"" season."
1474044,fishincrazy,2012-08-12 20:00:00,1282,No shore lunch we where to busy fishing!i think next year calls for 2 weeks north especially since I fouind out there is a 40% discount for the second week!!!Just think we can pattern the fish then really slam them!!!FC
1474184,micropterus,2012-08-13 07:36:00,450,"Michael will be missed! He took fishing camp food up several notches. We stayed for two extra days this year, an extra week, now there is a great idea."
1474207,Hawkfan,2012-08-13 08:09:00,237,Talk about a good trip. Those are some hawgs. Nice pics!
