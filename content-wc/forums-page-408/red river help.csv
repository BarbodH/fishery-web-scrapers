1476295,Guest,2012-08-18 16:22:00,0,Its Open right now but i heard the waters low But justy wait it will rain or some other excuse and they will barricade the road again So if your coming up for the run Your guess is as good as ours around here Ps There has been some early signs of green already showing up
