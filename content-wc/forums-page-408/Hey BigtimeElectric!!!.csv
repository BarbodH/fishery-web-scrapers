1473843,bigtimeelectric,2012-08-12 09:34:00,174,"BTMBNCR, had a great week at GAWLEYS LITTLE BEAVER LODGE.Thursday was my best day pitching light jigs on to shallow reefs I threw 4 times and caught 4 fish between 21"" and 25.75"" just awesome. Great weather. Although when the wind quit in the afternoon so did the fish, but it was a good time to get back to camp and pack up. I can't wait to get back to Little beaver I doubt I will make it back yet this year, but you never know.How was the shock of you gas bill over there?"
1473933,IA JOE,2012-08-12 15:23:00,35,How about an update on water temps in McKenzie? Yours is the second post with comments on shallow walleyes. 3-10'?
1473952,btmbncr,2012-08-12 16:27:00,492,My gas bill wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.I'm working on a 3 to4 week trip for next summer. Water temp in Mc Kenzie was 71 to 73 degrees as of Wednesday.Bill
1473978,wallydave,2012-08-12 17:20:00,2151,"Bill glad to read your posts on Lac Seul! It's a great fishery, plus its in a wonderful setting! I hope Andrea and her staff took good care of you and your bride! Dave"
1475700,IA Boy,2012-08-16 19:02:00,3,"Hi Bill,I am the guy that stayed in the cabin next to you at Lac Seul. Hope you had a really great second week of fishing. Just wanted to say thanks again for all the tips, tackle and advice you gave us while we were there. Also appreciated the invitation to fish next to you. We learned a totally new (for me) tactic that we can use in the future.Hope you had a nice trip home. I see you are planning a 3 to 4 week trip next year. Maybe we will see you again then.Brian"
1475771,btmbncr,2012-08-17 00:12:00,492,"Ia Boy We went down south of Ghost Narrows for 2 days after you left.We had 3 spots down there we really caught big walleyes.Had one day where all but 4 of the fish were over 18 inches and we stayed busy all day.Went back to McKenzie and fished the rock just north of the island we all fished that day and we spanked them again,shallow that day.My wife out fished on big fish the last 4 days.Picked a truckload of blueberries one afternoon.Going back next summer ofr 3 weeks for sure,possibly 4 weeks.Not staying at the same place.Going to trailer south and fish McKenzie and the main lake body. My wife and I are currently boat shopping.Tuffy,my dog, slept the whole way home and for the first 2 days we were back.Take care.Bill and Lucy"
1475802,IA Boy,2012-08-17 06:23:00,3,"Thanks for the reply Bill. Glad to hear that you had good fishing the last week. We went down and peeked around the corner into Ghost narrows to see what it looked like. When we go back, I would like to see about getting closer to the better fishing too. A long haul every day from Goose Bay to MacKenzie Bay, especially if it gets rough. Trouble is my son met the camp owners daughter the last night we were there. They are both the same age. Now of course, he wants to go back there again!What kind of boat are you looking at? I have a Lund Mr. Pike 17 with console steering. I grew up fishing with a tiller steer and still prefer that by far. Thinking about trading this boat off for a tiller.Take it easy and keep on pounding them!Brian"
1476175,btmbncr,2012-08-18 06:48:00,492,"Brian I'm looking hard at a Lund Alaskan 2000 Tiller,their 20 ft tiller.Probably put a 90 to 125 hp Optimax tiller on it with my Terrova 80 lb.I Pilot and Humminbird 898.We used up a bunch of crawlers before we left,thanks again.My wife misses Lac Seul every bit as much as me.Bill"
