1472896,packpro,2012-08-09 16:50:00,695,"I have used Wilderness to fly into a non Wilderness location for 13 years. Wilderness is a well run, well organized operation. This year we took one of their daily fly-outs. We landed on remote lake and caught (3 of us) around 150 fish. 90% walleye. More over 20"" than under. 18"" was the small one with many cookie cutter 24"". Most amazing size lake I have seen for numbers. The lake is all catch and release so we put em back. We go with a large group, as soon as we got back our guys signed up for two additional trips to that lake. All trips we just about the same. Even though this was a remote lake, the boat was very nice, and the motor started first pull. It doesn't surprise me. You call tell by the condition of the Aerodrome, they are meticulous about the equipment. Good luck wherever you land."
1472934,v-bay gord,2012-08-09 17:57:00,3168,I second the thumbs up from packerpro. Many of the camps use Wilderness Air. They have been in business for many years and are well run.
1472946,oxdrift2,2012-08-09 18:10:00,37,I have been on quite a few one day fly in's with them. Great people.
1473005,Skywagon,2012-08-09 19:57:00,1106,Which of their lakes did you go to packpro?
1473060,fishinnut 3446,2012-08-09 21:57:00,638,"Packpro,Kind of sounds like the lake i've been luccky enough to go to twice as a 1 day fly-in Brommey(spelling) from Eagle lake,GREAT fishing for a C&R lake we didn't catch small one's,all between 18""-24"",highly reccommend this lake!and i'm sure we flew with wilderness air."
1475346,Terwalleye,2012-08-15 19:31:00,166,"Our group has used them 3 years running for one day trips. Boot Lake was ridiculous numbers, Lake No. 1 was good numbers with very nice size. many over 23"". This past year we did an overnighter to one of their cabin lakes. Portal Lake. Cabin was very nice. Equipment was in great shape. We had one day and it rained and the mayfly hatch was in full bloom. Did not ""slay"" them. However the group right after us used live bait (we did not) and they did slay them. Hoping to maybe get back there one day. But the people and the service has always been top notch with them. Highly recommend them."
1475823,bluegussler,2012-08-17 07:10:00,124,can you tell us how much a day trip cost per person?
1475967,packpro,2012-08-17 13:32:00,695,"Blue,It is a variable cost. If you are at one of the Eagle Lake Resorts you can get a discount as the resorts use the service frequently. They are getting a volume discount. Otherwise the price is based on number of people in the party and air miles to the lake. Different lakes have more boats for a larger party, and certain lakes require certain aircraft to get eveyone up/down. All that information is charted on the Wilderness Air web site. That would be the place to make the cost calculation. I think it is under ""Dailey Fly ins"""
