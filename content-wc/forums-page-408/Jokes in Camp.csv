1422193,doubleheader,2012-04-17 08:42:00,2652,"Not so sure about jokes, but have pulled some hilarious pranks. Last year I got this fake snake, I painted it so it looked like one of those big ole water snakes you see. I primed the pump by having the guide tell my friends there have been a rash of snakes climbing on boats. First day 6:00AM we go down to the boats. I have my fake snake in the front of my boat and I reach down like I'm picking something up and scream while simultaneously throwing the snake towards my friends in their boat. My buddy and his wife screamed like stuck pigs. I laughed so hard I was seeing stars. I could not stop laughing. Year before that my buddy and me decide to prank the wives. About two weeks before we leave we tell them we're buying duck harnesses for musky fishing. Initially they were dumbfounded we'd even consider using baby ducklings, so we just let them stew for awhile. Every day my buddy and I would compare notes on what our wives were saying. My wife was asking all kinds of questions and saying stuff like, ""I'm shocked you would do this to a baby duck"". My buddy was getting similar comments. About a week before we left I had the lodge owner send me a note saying he had secured the baby ducks, so we forwarded that email to our wives and said, ""Okay, this is your last chance I need to order the harnesses today."" Well, they both decided they wanted harnesses. So now they think the harnesses are ordered but they are flipping out. My wife and I would be sitting watching tv or just hanging at the house and she'd bring up the subject along with some question. I couldn't keep her hanging any more, so when she asked about how you fish them I said, ""Well, the harness has a hook on each side, you just put the duck in the harness, drop them over the side of the boat and let them swim around. If you want you can cast them but they don't last long casting"". Then I started laughing and she came unglued realizing she'd been had. Still working on a prank for this year. It gets harder every year."

We quickly figured out the hot water from the kitchen causes the shower to go cold. Every time we turned on the water in the kitchen we would here him scream because the shower would get cold. Then he would adjust the shower to get hot water and once we shut of the kitchen water it would then get so hot it would scald him. We kept doing it during the whole time he showered. We all laughed pretty hard, especially when he came out of the shower in his towel and his chest looked like it had 2 degree burns. Needless to say he did not get invited back after that."

Little did he know another buddy had slipped a remote fart sounder in his jacket pocket. Just as he's pouring on the charm the other buddy hit the switch and it was the most realistic wet fart sound ever. I almost spilled coffee on me the next aisle over.

Fun to watch guys stall out and pull their azzes off trying to restart. Usually they will run out of gas after the carb runs out.

So the next morning I go staggering over to my bro-in-laws cabin, still slightly inebriated from the previous evenings festivities and despite both our clocks saying 5:30 it was actually 3:30 in the a.m. We dutifully load our crap in the boat and go out to start trolling. After about an hour I say to my bro-in-law, why the he** isn't it getting light yet? Another half hour and still no sign of dawn he starts rummaging around his boat and finally produces a watch. Which reads 5 a.m. We were totally bewildered on how we both managed to screw up our clocks on the same morning. The pieces finally began to fall into place when we noticed our wives anxiously awaiting our return to the dock with smiles on their faces."

BIL goes in to take daily nap, screams like a lil girl about 15 minutes later as Mr. Chippy ran across his forehead just as he was dozing off.Stunt no. 2 - since stunt 1 didn't cure the griping stunt 2 was executed. We doused his toothbrush, chapstick and comb with Mike's Hot Sauce...the resulting fireworks were truly amazing especially when the top of his head nearly caught fire (according to him) as he was adjusting his combover..... some inventive cussing took place from the chapstick.He quit his griping btw."

One year I bought a roll of toilet paper that had UT logos on each sheet. On my way to the john one morning a UT graduate made it clear that he was next. When I left the john I took all the toilet paper and left the roll of UT paper in the coffee can at the john.

I explained they live in the outhouse and when you sit down this disturbs them, so they jump over and bite you, hence the name of ""testical"" spider. This kid never did go in the outhouse the whole trip. It helped that the second day by the dock was the biggest hairiest spider I've ever seen stitting there by our boat."

I had to wait, and time it properly. After an extremely hot and windy day on the water we were back in the cabin enjoying some pre-dinner drinks. I took out the regular chapstick, applied it and mentioned what a cooling effect it had on my wind/sun burnt lips (after I had slid it back in my pocket). My buddy said, ""Give me some of that, would 'ya?"" I threw him the Dr. Juice out of the same pocket ... and watched as he smeared it all over his lips.

He said late one night the cabin closest to his was making a real ruckus- the lights were off and all of a sudden everyone would start yelling .Then lights would go on and all would be quite and the lights would go out again. Well this kept on happening numerous times. Finally he said he had to check what the heck was going on. He said they would each put $5 on table. Bait their mouse trap and put it in a place of their choosing. Turn out the lights wait for the SNAP and see who won the pot.

We took about 10 yards of line off the reel cut it, and then wound it back on. Told him the cheap bucktail was perfect lure. Of course he casted and the lure and the ten yards sailed. I asked him what the he ll he did to my lure, and offered to tie on another but he would owe me. I tied on a floater, because I had cut his line another ten or so yards into the spool. He casted again and again the lure and line sailed away. He just couldn't figure out what the heck he was doing and wanted to quit.

Pretending to fish near camp, each of us on opposite sides.............we hear them coming. Totally surrounded we start pegging the dripping potatoes, cheese flying everywhere. Some how they outrun us and get back the Houseboat and arm themselves with eggs and potatoes. We hightailed it out of there to return later donned in our rain-suits and boots, and used boat cushions as shields, they chased us down like dogs, as we had the smaller motor on our boat.

After an evening filled with brandy and beer I took a handful of popcorn, wrapped it in tinfoil, and slid it under his bunk. Those of us who were drinking weren't bothered by all of the noise of the mice trying to get the popcorn. Unfortunately for dad he's not much of a drinker and spent a lot of time awake trying to figure out what all the noise was that night. Then there was the time that we saw a bear in camp. The next night the camp owner, after a bunch of 12 ounce encouragement, took down a bear rug off the wall, draped it over himself, and went around to the various cabins to see what kind of reaction he could get. At one of the cabins he scratched on the screen door to get the occupants' attention. Unfortunately for him the stove was right next to the door and the guests had a pot of water on it. One of the guys saw the ""bear"" and threw the pot of water through the screen door at it. Luckily it either wasn't really hot or most of it missed him, because there wasn't any damage done that couldn't be fixed with a cold beer. But I think he decided not to pull that one anymore after that."

One year a raven set up a nest in a tree outside the cabin's bedrooms and raised a nice little family. The problem was … the birds woke up at dawn and made a ruckus.One of the guys complained … a lot.One day while the ""complainer"" was out fishing in his year-old Ranger, the host borrowed a rifle from a neighboring lodge owner and shot all the birds. Later that day while the ""complainer"" was busy cooking dinner, the host took the dead birds down to the Ranger and put them in the live well.That night the group went fishing and the host shadowed the Ranger wherever it went. It took quite a while for them to catch a keeper but when they did, it was a riot … dead ravens were being flung high in the air every which way. And you could hear expletives being shouted for miles around.What a hoot!"

We hid the bottle, took pictures for clues and then sent them with another group of family/friends that was going up later in the year. They found and thoroughly enjoyed it! Another trick for the fly-in...we had one guy who always laid claim the the ""best"" bed. Well, we got a bit tired of that so we went down to the shore, found a nice big rock and hid it under his mattress and the bed frame. Remember, these are fly-in digs - not the most luxurious beds to begin with. He slept on it all week and complained about how stiff/sore he was every morning. End of the week we took the rock out and he never knew. For two of the less-than-dedicated fisherman in our fly-in group we replaced all their equipment with Barbie poles and matching Barbie tackle boxes. We did leave them with a few good jigs. To earn their equipment back they had to catch 1 fish with the Barbie pole. They did so quickly and they actually got a bit of a kick out of fishing with the Barbie poles at times the rest of the week. There are more, but these were some fun and harmless pranks. Scott"

The particular camp we went to had a camp dog, some mixed breed dog that was very friendly but into everything. We launched the boats and parked them at the dock and the dog was up and down the dock, but not in the boats. The rest of the night (before fishing the next day) we'd make a big deal about going down to the dock and finding that ""darn dog"" was in the boat - the guy with the new boat was quite unnerved by this. The dog, of course, was innocent. Late that night one of my other good friends snuck down to the dock and placed a very realistic looking pile of fake poop on the front deck of the boat. The look on my buddies face as we're walking down to the boats the next AM and he spots the large ""pile"" on his front deck (from about 200 feet away) was absolutely priceless. Scott"

We used it to train business customers how to handle call transfers etc. Half way through the week after we had all had a few beers,I set the phone up in a corner of the cabin.Everyone knew what was happening except one of my friends who always seems to get a call from his wife when we are out having fun. When the phone rang another accomplice standing close picked it up and announced that it was John's wife for John.

One of the guys had weak kidneys and had to releive himself during the night. He had an empty coffee can under his bed and when the urge arose he peed in it. One night after to many drinks (all of us)he went to bed. One of us (no longer with us) had the brillant idea to cut the bottom out on Ole's coffee can. Two AM (got the picture) Ole hasn't been fishing with since.
