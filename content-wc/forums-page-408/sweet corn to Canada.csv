1476963,Lovetofish,2012-08-20 12:25:00,458,We have brought a cooler of sweet corn several times. But the last few years we have gone in early July and the local corn wasn't ready yet. So we brought a few bags of freezer corn we make at home which is pretty darn good too. Less space and weight too.

1043927,2746,2008-07-20 13:52:00,3206,A friend wants to bring freh sweet corn into Canada with our groceries. Does anyone know if that is allowed or where I could find the regs to check it out?

1043934,Catman59,2008-07-20 14:41:00,345,I have done it a few times and never had a problem. They only asked about potatoes and firewood this year .
1043936,Bill Krejca,2008-07-20 14:45:00,6107,"You should be OK. The concern seems to be for food which is grown in the ground, e.g., potatoes. Why they don't care about onions, I don't know, but they never ask. I hope this doesn't start a thread on onions now. Or watermelons - there is always a little dirt on the ones I buy, he,he.

1043947,Five Lakes Lodge,2008-07-20 16:06:00,4,"Hi Larry - Everett here...as far as I know it is allowable to bring fresh sweet corn into Canada. Quite a few of our guests did so last year with no problems that we're aware of. As Bill pointed out - there are restrictions on the import of root vegetables, however. There is a quick reference table on the Canada Border Services Agency website....that weblink is: http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/fpa-apa/law-loi-eng.htmlSee you in a couple weeks......."
1044001,2746,2008-07-20 20:11:00,3206,Thanks everyone and good to hear from you Everett. See you in August! Larry
1476301,Guest,2012-08-18 16:46:00,0,tomatoes cant go in or out .and just because they only ask for certain things doesn't mean that if you bring it over the boarder and don't declare it the man said to me 300.00 dollar fine ...so make sure
1476304,jow,2012-08-18 17:08:00,20,I hope you can...nothing beats fresh sweet corn with freshly caught walleyedoesnt get much better than that imo
1476582,3M TA3,2012-08-19 15:03:00,2846,"It's really amazing what people make up to questions like this. For those tomato and potato replies, someone please show me a reference. Just one. Let's stick to 10 pounds or less too. Geez."
