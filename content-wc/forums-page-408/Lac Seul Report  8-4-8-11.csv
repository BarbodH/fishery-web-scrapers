1475703,Jabs,2012-08-16 19:07:00,24,"We just got back on Wednesday . We caught them on the east side between 12 and 28 fow. We did ok around the reefs by bear narrows. Did just ok by sen bay. Did our best in grassy bay. Jigs were not the answer for us, crawler harnesses were because they were real scattered. Had a unpleasant experience in se bay of minitaki. Two boats come racing in on a small hump we were on and turn on their stereo on full blast. It's the second time this year someone did that to us. As the common man would say, "" whe do these people come from!"""
1475891,joeman79,2012-08-17 09:26:00,417,"Ya I wish we would have switched it up more and gone away from the jigs, but it's hard when you fish with guys that live and die by the jig. We never tried Grassy or Canoe which we should have. Oh well there is always next year. Guess the weather is about the same and fishing is still off and on."
1474051,joeman79,2012-08-12 20:09:00,417,"Got home at 1 a.m this morning from Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul. Had a great trip of course. Fishing was off and on with 3 separate fronts hitting in our 6 days of fishing. Had a couple days where fishing the big water was near impossible for the boat I was in. Jigged 90% of the time and had our best luck in 18-23 ft but also caught fish up to 35 ft deep. Was not our year for big fish but did catch a bunch in that 19- 23 inch range which were as healthy and fat and fiesty as I have ever seen them. Our big fish for our group of 11 was a 26 and a half incher caught in Senn Bay. caught by a first timer to Lac Seul and our group, he was a pleasure to have along. He rated Lac Seul as good as the previous Fly-ins he had done. Seemed like most days we would catch 3-6 fish a spot and have to move aways and locate some more. Of course our last day, mostly in the afternoon on the lake on a DEAD CALM day was our best day, we had some great action of 20-40 fish in a couple spots. Extremely light bites and would only take a jig that was barely moving or just lying on the bottom, once we figured it out it was a BLAST. Of the 6 days we fished we had 2 days where my boat boated over 100 and 120 walleyes a day but the rest were 50-80 fish per day, which a guy should not complain about by any means. Caught more 8-10 inch walleye than you can count on a couple of the slow days, so the future looks good. 35 in Pike was our best and the guys threw for Muskies the last morning and had 3 follows but never set the hook. Had some great shore lunches, Fish tacos were a hit but Battered Walleye and onion rings took home first place. My Blackened Walleye for our evening meal was by far the group favorite as well. Lost Island Lodge treated us well and we will go back. Great bunch of guys and Gals. Looking forward to next year already."
1474062,Pikeslayer8,2012-08-12 20:35:00,1460,Really nice report Joeman! Glad that you had a great time. Slowing down your presentation to almost nil can be a hard thing to deduce. Definitely want to hear more about Joeman's Blackened Walleye but get a good nights sleep will ya.
1474175,wallydave,2012-08-13 07:15:00,2151,I'm with Pikeslayer! I'd love to read about your blackened walleye! Hum I love a good blackened fish!!
1474209,Mike Kansas,2012-08-13 08:23:00,1463,"joeman79, Glad to hear you had a great trip. Lost Island has always been great fishing for us and its service and staff are super. Good to see that you had a first timer with you that thought it was great. Have a good winter and I hope all is well with you and yours. Mike Kansas"
1474400,joeman79,2012-08-13 15:51:00,417,"Blackened Walleye rinse your fillets in good cold water and drain in a coliander or pat dry with paper towels. Put them in a big plastic or metal bowl an put in fridge or cooler to chill. Melt a stick of butter in a small pan and then take off heat and let it cool awhile. Take fillets out of fridge and pour the entire pan of butter over fillets and toss with tongs to make sure the butter coats all the fillets entirely. You don't use any oil in your pan. The butter coated fillets do not need any additional oil in pan. I use Zatarans Blackened Fish Spice which most Walmarts and bigger grocery stores carry, or you could mix up a bunch with your own spices. But Zat's is good. I then just shake spice over fish in bowl and I put on quite a bit. Put some on, stir the fillets around, repeat till all have a nice coating. You could do each fillet individually and put on cookie sheet also. But the way I do it works great. Fire up the propane fish cooker on about medium till pan starts smoking. I use a huge old Non Stick Skillet from home that is warped on the bottom, but Cast Iron works as well. Do this outside!!!!! The fumes from the fish cooking make you cough, it won't take you long to figure that out. With a set of tongs put a few fillets into hot pan, leave some room between fillets. They cook fast 2 or 3 minutes a side. Flip once when you can see the middle of the fillet turning white. When done remove with spatula. Serve with your favorite sides. I usually put a couple fillets on top of some Fetucinni noodles covered with a Garlic Alfredo sauce. Goes very well together. But the guys like it just on a plate also. It is spicy"

1475574,jimmie,2012-08-16 11:45:00,123,"I am at Lac Seul area now and same poorer luck. Spotty fishing to say they the least. I thought I had a world record (tiny) 'eye then recalled a few years back I had caught one only 5 1/2"" in length. Folks are indeed having to fish in 35/40 feet of water to have any luck in numbers. My largest to date this year has been 24 1/2"" for walleye and 35 1/2 for pike. I did catch more smallies this trip compared to the hot July trip with a nice 18"" 3 lb 11oz fish.Three more dyas of fun here tis year and back home. Ugh A bad year here seems to still equal and more often than not outdo most any where lese. Enjoy summer guys its 52 with rain ending soon today in Sioux Lookout. Jimmie"
1475579,tv4fish,2012-08-16 11:51:00,2694,"jimmie: Just put a little longer ""delay"" on that fuse since you're in that deep of water --- the dynamite will still bring'em up. OH - maybe this will help you feel better -- temp. here in Aitkin at 11:00 a.m. was 59 degrees."
1475587,wallydave,2012-08-16 12:08:00,2151,Thanks I can't wait to give it a try! Which Canadian beer goes best with this!?
