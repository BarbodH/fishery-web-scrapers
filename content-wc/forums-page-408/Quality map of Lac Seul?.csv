1464084,SinOrSwim,2012-07-20 12:09:00,1528,We have been to Lac Seul once and are returning this fall. We are looking for good quality maps we can order. The waterproof ones. Anybody know where to find these?

1464098,SinOrSwim,2012-07-20 12:37:00,1528,Thanks but the one I see on there is 3ft x 5ft. Looking for something a little more boat friendly.
1464103,Guest,2012-07-20 12:52:00,0,Thorne brothers in Minneaplois has what you are looking for. The Explorer series of Lac Seul maps are the best out there.
1464166,WalleyeWally28,2012-07-20 15:21:00,298,"I agree. The maps are produced by Red Lake Digital Media, Inc. under licence from The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. The lake is split into 4 sections (NW. SW, SE, NE) and you just buy the area(s) you are interested in fishing. They are sold in many places in Ontario or you can contact Red Lake Media direct thru their website for more info."

1464333,JDP,2012-07-21 05:09:00,1457,Here is the link to Red Lake Digital Media.It appears that Alex Wilson Coldstream sells the maps.You can contact Alex Wilson Coldstream at 1-800-465-7230or as others have said Thorne Bros sells the Explorer Series for Lac Seul.http://www.redlakedigital.com/html/custom_maps.htmlhttp://www.thornebros.com/shop/pc/home.asp
1476251,rommel,2012-08-18 11:10:00,369,do the red lakes digital maps include safe travel routes like the trak maps ones do? that may be good info to have for a first timer. if its accurate
1476385,JDP,2012-08-18 23:08:00,1457,I'll check on that...but the Navionics chip has safe ravel routes.
1476415,SinOrSwim,2012-08-19 06:20:00,1528,"By safe travel routes, does that mean just marking rocks with an X? I don't remember much else on my Navionics chip?"
