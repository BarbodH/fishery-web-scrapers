1474574,schandm,2012-08-14 04:25:00,18,So what is the law as it stands today concerning border crossing with DUI? We are planning 2013 trip and 1 person in group had DUI 3 years ago.Thanksdave
1475796,Juls,2012-08-17 06:02:00,13414,"http://www.noto.net/crossing_the_borderGuests with Criminal RecordsVisitors to Canada who have any kind of criminal record may be denied entry. Even if you have entered Canada before, new screening procedures may lead to you being turned back. Many jurisdictions distinguish between more and less serious offences. The US, for example, classifies crimes as either felonies or misdemeanours. Canada makes a similar distinction with indictable and summary offences, with indictable offences being the more serious. However, quite a number of offences can be treated as either indictable or summary in Canada, depending on the specific circumstances. This is important to know, since determination of admissibility is based on how the offence would be treated in Canada, not its status in the visitor's home state. Impaired Driving, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, may be a misdemeanour in a visitor's home state, but in Canada it can be an indictable offence. There are three basic procedures available that can allow you to legally enter Canada if you have a criminal record.Granted RehabilitationYou can apply through a Canadian Consulate or certain border crossings to have your record examined by immigration officials. There is a non-refundable administration fee that is usually $200 Canadian but may be higher for very serious offenses. If the application is successful, you will receive a letter stating that you have been Granted Rehabilitation, and you will now be allowed to enter Canada freely any time. We suggest that guests who are considering making an application for Granted Rehabilitation contact the NOTO office so that we can explain the process in more detail and direct them to the best point of contact.Deemed RehabilitationUnder some circumstances, you can be Deemed Rehabilitated without having to apply for Granted Rehabilitation. This procedure applies if you committed a single indictable offence that would be punished by a term of imprisonment of less than ten years (based on how the offence would be classified in Canada) and have not committed any offences since. Ten years must have passed since the completion of the sentence, including any probation. You can also be Deemed Rehabilitated if you have committed two or more summary offences and five years have passed since the sentences were served and no subsequent offences have been committed.Deemed Rehabilitation is generally determined by an immigration officer at the border crossing, although it may be possible to have a determination made in advance. There is no fee for Deemed Rehabilitation; however, the information is not necessarily entered into the database, so you could be denied entry on a subsequent visit. It is possible to obtain a preliminary determination of whether you are admissible under the Deemed Rehabilitated provisions in several ways.Guests can also apply in person for a Remote Area Border Crossing Permit through the Fort Frances Canada Border Services Office or by mail to Canada Border Services Agency 201 North May Street, Thunder Bay ON P7C 3P4. This permit is intended primarily for guests who intend to enter Canada by water in areas where there is no customs and immigration facility. However, since it requires a background check, the permit will demonstrate to customs and immigration officials that a determination of admissibility has been made. There is a $30 Cdn. fee for the permit, and the application is available at http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publicati...bsf386-eng.pdfTemporary Resident PermitAt their discretion immigration officials may admit someone who does not qualify for Deemed Rehabilitation through a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP). It is normally issued for a single visit, although it is sometimes issued for longer duration or multiple visits. There is a $200 Cdn administrative fee for issuing a TRP. A guest who arrives at the border and does not qualify for Deemed Rehabilitation but appears to qualify for Granted Rehabilitation may be offered the option of a Temporary Resident Permit in order to complete their trip, since the Granted Rehabilitation process takes a number of weeks to complete. It is expected that guests who plan on returning to Canada will then complete the Granted Rehabilitation Process before any subsequent trips.Welcome to CanadaThese procedures make it possible to enter Canada, even if you have a criminal record. In most cases, it is better to apply in advance to determine your admissibility, and which procedure is best for you to follow. You should also be prepared with additional information on the offence to help the officer in arriving at a determination. Remember, the determination will be based on the information in the database. If there are any errors, like a charge that was dropped, you need to get those corrected in your home jurisdiction. Despite the troubled times we live in, Canada is still the same friendly place to visit it has always been. The vast majority of guests still enter Canada with absolutely no problem. For those whose backgrounds may pose some difficulty, these procedures may allow them to come and enjoy what Canada has to offer."

1473310,QuikNet,2012-08-10 13:44:00,237,"Just got back home . crossed at Baudette / Rainy . It was the best crossing in 20 yrs . We were treated nice both ways. I also think it was due to the learning curve . I pre-opened my topper door and I rolled up my boat cover before going over the bridge . We also approached the check point with truck windows down , hats off , sunglasses off and passports in hand . I had my tag #'s on a sheet on my console . Answered all questions directly except when ask by the Canadian Guard if I owned guns at home . I responded that I did not have a conceal carry permit and I thought that what I owned at home was not Canada privilege to know. I thought maybe I had screwed up but he seem to take my response OK ."

Are there any Canadians that do this?

1473461,jimmie,2012-08-10 21:30:00,123,"Same experience here. As a Minnesotan folks wonder why I bother to go to Canada. I don't have to worry about a felony record of any kind as I don't drink. However coming back into the US thru a barrgae of Homeland security wannabies is very annoying. Last time I came home in July I was told by the US guard not to use the holder that the government provided to keep my passport in. It gets all over my fingers. I asked if they had a suggestion box and got a burning stare back. Was sent on my way with a ""don't use it again""!! I have had nothing but positive things to say about the Canadian guards. I would overall recommend the trip regrdless."
1473759,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-11 22:52:00,235,"Canada offers an unsurpassed wilderness fishing experience. For someone to say it is ""beyond"" them why any American would fish in Canada, you almost have to wonder if they have ever even fished in Canada. It is a wilderness experience that is not available in the States, save for the Boundary Waters or Sylvania Wilderness perhaps. I can't think of anywhere in the US where an angler of modest skill can go and get a cabin and rented boat and, without the assistance of a guide, can virtually be guaranteed to catch walleye, sometimes at an incredible rate. The hassles of international travel are worth it for me. I don't have DUI on my record, so I may look at this differently than others, but after numerous border crossings at Ft. Frances since the late 90's, we have usually always just been asked some standard questions and sent through. Border patrol have always been professional, though some are more cheerful and others are all business. Biggest hassle has been the occasional random vehicle search...you go through all that effort to scientifically pack the car and then they take everything out and make you repack the darn thing. But we accept that risk and that is a rarity, and to be honest, I would make the trIp even if I knew that was a guarantee each time. There's just something too alluring about landing on a remote lake to your own private outpost camp. I'm glad to hear that they are at least attempting to be more flexible on past drunk driving. Hopefully they can sort that out. I believe in giving second chances and I think that law has been mostly turning away people who are little to no threat. Bottom line is that any country's border cops are goverrnment employees. They are not in the customer service business. Just how it is..."
1473804,Sidge61,2012-08-12 07:42:00,59,Had a wonderful and easy time crossing into Canada this past July. Crossed about noon on a Saturday and had a 5 minute wait in line and was asked the standard questions and sent on our way. Crossing back into the states was asked if we were bringing anything besides fish into the states. She could see the rod case attached to the top of the car. Another guest at our lodge was asked by a Canadian border agent what he did for a living. Strange request.
1474339,Mike Kansas,2012-08-13 13:16:00,1463,I have been going to Canada since 1955 and have never had a problem at the border or with any of the Canadian outfitters we have fished with. In fact the people at the border have been very nice and accomadating. The places we stayed at have all been very service oriented and fairly priced. Of course I have always viewed the bucket as Half Full instead of Half Empty. Mike Kansas
1474416,Bill Krejca,2012-08-13 16:38:00,6107,"Re: Odd questions - It has been my experience that occasionally the authorities will ask a question to which the answer could not possibly have been coached to someone with a limited amount of English language / North American culture. My take on it is that it is a way of uncovering a 'potential problem person"" of one type or another. This is what they are being paid to do, and would we want it any other way? I have found that most discussions with these folks normally last no longer than the time required to go through the checkout line in the grocery store. A small price in time to pay, to enjoy the north woods. Bill Krejca"

(Casinos in Niagara Falls, Windsor, and Sault. reported dramatic drop after smoking in public buildings like these banned) So lets keep the factors of why border crossing are down in perspective. It is rarely the snarky border people (both USA or Canada) its primarily economy, exchange rate and health"
1473216,SinOrSwim,2012-08-10 10:13:00,1528,"Both sides have changed over the years. Going in used to be dicey for us because we take a lot of beer. They would always open our trailer and want to see it. Which is fine. Sometimes they were pleasant and other times very cold. We had one year they told us we needed a liquor license and we wouldn't be able to cross. I think he was just trying to be a Dbag until we got inside.The last several years, they have been much more pleasant and they actually are smiling and laughing inside. The US side has gotten worse since 911. They used to be all happy happy, and now they question you like we are terrorists. We have been asked the same questions 3 times in different ways to see if we give a different answer. How many fish. None. Okay 3 other questions, so what kind of fish do you have? None......okay...3 other questions. So, just the 6 of you and your fish? NOOOO, we don't have any fish. tricky *******.We also pulled through that big xray thing and they had to detain us for awhile and look because we had a RADIO inside the trailer. Could have been a bomb I suppose? So, it goes both ways."

1473229,1860Angler,2012-08-10 10:40:00,2642,"I have been turned away at the border, one of the guys that was with had a DUI at the time 8 years prior. It was very frustrating and disappointing to not be able to continue the trip. In this case it was for Goose hunting. I think that easing up the DUI rules is a good thing, don't get me wrong I'm not for drinking and driving, but in our case the guy with the DUI wasn't driving, so what's the big deal? I know Canadians drink!! As far as border crossings, for the most part I have had no problems in either direction, just the occasional search of the vehicle and boat, though a pain, they are just doing there jobs, and most have been pretty friendly. Last year when going into Canada at the Rainy River Crossing they had us pull over and were trying to get my tonneau cover open to do there check and couldn't figure it out. I kindly asked if I could help and they laughed and said sure, so I went back there and helped them open it. We have also got the same question asked 3 different ways coming home. As far as not going to Canada because of the hassle at the border crossings, it's going to take more than that to stop me from going to Canada!! I love MN and there is some great fishing here, but nothing compared to the waters in Canada!! Just the fact that you may not see another boat all day is enough to keep me coming back!! The fishing is 2nd to none, and I could care less if I can only bring back 2 fish!! That's not the point of going up there for me, it's catching a ton of fish that does it for me, shore lunch everyday is all I need!!"

I have never been hassled going in except for an issue that we had last year when we brought in extra liquor and declared it so we had to go inside and fill out some papers. They never searched our truck or boat even though we parked it in the search area while we were inside.................the only time I was ever checked on the way back out was once when I was by myself and coming back a day early. They made me go inside and sign some permission paper while they walked a dog around the outside of the rig.....that was it. We always approach the windows with all of our windows down and hats and sunglasses off. They seem to appreciate that...............either way, we have never really encountered what I would consider overly rude officers. Sometimes very straight forward and no response to my attempt at a cracked joke but, they aren't paid to listen to my stand up routine either.......the U.S. guy on the way back this year asked about my fish and I mentioned that I had some pike. He decided to share with me the fact that he doesn't even allow pike in ""his"" boat. I simply said ""very sorry for your loss"". He laughed and off we went................"
1473155,Suzuki,2012-08-10 07:46:00,4711,I agree. I understand why people go there and this will be a welcome change to many but I still have no interest in going there.

It does seem as if the agents have lost the ""atitude"" that seemed to exist for the prior years. IMO - that's a good thing. Another good thing is that the wait to cross has gotten much less time consuming and that helps the whole experience also. I commend you for doing what you did."

We've been asked a couple times to go inside for a passport check with no issues and all agents friendly and courteous. As far as the folks whining about thier DUI convictions, I applaud Canada in their efforts to keep known drunks off the road. I'd much rather deal with a deer, bear, or moose on the road than some idiot soused up and driving drunk. Rehabilitated first offenders have a great chance with the recent changes and I hope they appreciate it. For the others that feel they need to drink and drive, I hope they are turned away at the border every time. Their desire to drink does not trump my right to live."

On the Canadian side, folks were always very nice and respectful. And almost every Friday I would be detained by US Customs @ Buffalo. for any where from 30 mins to 5 hours. When I would inquire what I was being held for, I was told to ""go wait in your truck"" Well after that, I took my keys and went inside, asked who was in charge. A man came over and asked what he could do for me? I gave him my keys and told him what truck it was for cause I was going home !

And people in positions to know attribute a great deal of that decline to the border crossing at Ft Frances. Some estimates were that although not the busiest crossing, fully 90% of all visitor complaints were directed at the treatment received at this small crossing. And that included results from all crossings between the US and Ontario. There was a serious attitude problem there that has been addressed. That isn't my opinion. It is supported by the operational memo affecting all visitors to Canada. And if there was a wilderness fishing experience in the US to match the Canadian one I would gladly stay here.

1472870,Fisher-man,2012-08-09 16:09:00,422,"I suppose this will probably interest only those of us affected by a DUI or other criminal history. And as those of us turned away at the border know, in Canada a DUI is the equivalent of a felony. I don't think anyone wants to argue with their right to pass laws regarding drunk driving or how they view people trying to visit their country with what they consider a criminal history. Anyway, after being treated like an Arab terrorist at the Fort Frances border crossing I vowed never to go back. This was about 3 years ago. My brothers, my son, my brother in law, some nephews and friends had been making the trip regularly before they turned me away at the border, so the whole group turned around and we haven't been back. Canadian tourism views each of those turn arounds as a $6000 carload. And that has cost Ontario millions and millions of dollars in lost visits. A group called Nature and Outdoors Tourism Ontario (NOTO) has been putting a lot of pressure on the border folks to treat people better. For us it wasn't the fact that I was deemed inadmissible, it was the way we were treated. Rude doesn't even come close to describing the behavior of the border agents. Anyway, I spoke with the Executive Director of NOTO, a guy named Doug Reynolds. A really good guy who understands the issue very well. He says the word has come down from on high for the border folks to treat people in a polite and respectful manner. They have instructed the immigration folks to issue a Temporary Residency Permit automatically to those individuals with a single infraction, no matter how recent. You will still have to do the $200 rehabilitation if your offense is between 5 and 10 years old. If less than 5 years old you can still be deemed acceptable, but the rules are less clear. Anyway, looks like they are getting the message. The economic impact has been huge. Some say maybe $20,000,000 a year in lost revenue. You can go to the NOTO website at www.noto.net for further clarification. Looking forward to Lake of the Woods in September."

The newest and lasted way to fine you is no beer in a boat, not even for shore lunch.....Really?? Go to Green Bay, Lake Erie, MN....support American Guides, hotels and resorts! Just saying, Lou"
1472882,ffishman,2012-08-09 16:29:00,8955,I agree!!!!
1472891,v-bay gord,2012-08-09 16:44:00,3168,"Hey Fisher-man.......welcome back, and let's hope the process becomes even more tourism friendly in the future. Doug at NOTO is open to receiving calls from anyone who has similar concerns or needs some help. To Lou and ffishman, you are entitled to your opinion, but you are missing out on a great experience......besides some lodges up here are actually owned by Americans (maybe they are the ones that tried to gouge you)"
1472899,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2012-08-09 16:54:00,5533,Well said V-Bay. We have had nothing but positive experiences in Canada.
1472914,Fisherman1792,2012-08-09 17:13:00,927,"Well, from my experience of crossing the border into the U.S. all have not been great experiences as well.My truck has been searched numerous times at the border crossing at Rainy River from the U.S customs. Their attitude has sucked as well, and the last time I tried to cross there I got turned away (I have no record not even a DUI and declared everything I had on me, filled out paper work, etc) and still had to go back and money not being spent in Minnesota and they could use it.So remember, it happens both ways!!!Fisherman 1792"
1472936,JAY221,2012-08-09 18:04:00,877,"You are entitled to your opinion. As far as I am concerned it is like comparing apples & oranges. I wouldn't trade the Canadian experience for any stateside fishing! Later, Jay"
1472943,Phil T,2012-08-09 18:08:00,4820,"My hassles have been returning home to the US. Every Canadian I've met was friendly, helpful, and pleasant. US Border Patrol, not so much."
1473095,Shellback,2012-08-10 05:16:00,8083,"Same here. I have always been treated well by the Canadians, but when returning home, I dealt with some rude Americans. Not once has one said welcome home or anything related. Also what's with the US uniforms? They look like the Gestapo!"
1473103,northernbite,2012-08-10 05:50:00,1186,"Not so fast on that; this is what I've seen over the last few years. Attitudes are changing. I've been crossing going on 40+ years. I've crossed at the Soo, Ft Erie, Buffalo, and Maine. I've had 2 times that were not very friendly going into Canada and once coming back. The Soo seemed to be less friendly but the worst was in Ft. Erie. It was about cigarettes and I don't smoke and this was before 9-11. They all have job to do, and I think ""learning how to cross"" is the best thing to do. Example, this year coming back in July guard asked if I had my trailer license number, I told her and she smiled and said, "" I've been on duty the last 5 hours and your the first person that new their trailer number."" Over all I think it has got better. And yes the last time I came back I was told welcome home plus my buds in their truck where also told that. Maybe a new policy.Paul"
