Since it will just be the two of us I have reserved remodeled room at the Rainbow in Fort Frances, a remodeled cabin at Goose Bay and to make the trip complete a couple of nights at a B@B in Hayfield Wisconsin on the return trip. The Canadian fishing trips we not part of my life when we got married, so we have learned the fine art of making adjustments! A lot like fishing isn't it! Learning to be adapt to the changing conditions!!"

1475231,Ia Walihntr,2012-08-15 13:58:00,320,I'd Give Duck Bay Lodge on Lake of the Woods a good look. Fantastic sunsets from the island and fantastic food. There is great fishing close. http://www.duckbaylodge.com/ She won't regret it! (That's the most important thing. The fishing is just a bonus.)
1475457,Bitinlight,2012-08-16 07:28:00,95,"Before I could even comment on this, what are you looking for on your honeymoon-Wining and dining first, and then a little fishing to go with, or just a fishing trip with good accomadations? I take my wife of 40 years on a fishing trip every year in July to Lac Seul at Lac Seul Outposts. We also go to Mexico for a week in February for wining and dining and romance. If she had to choose one, she has said she'd pick the Lac Seul trip. With that said, I wish I'd have known about Lac Seul 40 years ago when we got married. By now, I could have had another 30 plus trips in!! Sunsets on Lac Seul are beautiful sitting in a boat on a calm night with your wife."

1474912,Danbear,2012-08-14 18:26:00,72,"Look at Birch Dale Lodge on Eagle Lake. They have 2 upgrade cabins with hot tubs, a great steak joint so your bride doesn't have to cook, great fishing and its run by two of the nicest people in Ontario. Check out cabin 9 or 10 on their web site."

1474996,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-14 22:03:00,235,"Is your lady into nature and actually likes/tolerates roughing it a bit? If so, look into a outpost camp, particularly one where you're the only cabin on the lake (Kabeelo Airways would be one to look at). The outpost will at least have a shower, and they might even make special bed accommodations for a honeymoon so you're not in bunks. You can consummate your marriage in a 14 foot aluminum boat...maybe catch a walleye in the act...not too many have joined that club."
