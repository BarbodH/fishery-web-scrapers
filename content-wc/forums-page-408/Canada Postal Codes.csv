I'm being plagued by invalid postal code entry at my work, and I might be able to help our data setup actions have fewer erorrs if I knew anything about the Canada Postal Code system."
1475234,adempsey,2012-08-15 14:11:00,963,That format is not correct. The first three alphanumerals designate the province and/or sections of the province. The last three narrow it down further.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_codes_in_Canadahttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of...odes_in_Canada (you can click on each letter for a more detailed breakdown within each region)
