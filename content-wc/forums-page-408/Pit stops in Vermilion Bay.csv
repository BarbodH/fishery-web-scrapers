1475888,Glenman12,2012-08-17 09:21:00,762,my mistake..he opened one of ours we had on ice..
1476302,billy8709,2012-08-18 16:52:00,2,"A hot dog on their menu is $4 or $5, the most expensive burger is $8 I think. Even if the dogs are $5 and you bought the $8 burger that's only $20.50 for the meal... You're saying a can of beer cost $11.50?"
1476358,Glenman12,2012-08-18 20:57:00,762,"like I said I was wrong about the beer..it was ours..I'll ask the guy that had our ""kitty"" what we paid but Im pretty sure it was $32..if I was wrong Ill apologize.."
1476493,Glenman12,2012-08-19 10:00:00,762,ok..something I forgot..we each had an order of fries..
1437026,v-bay gord,2012-05-17 20:23:00,3168,I think Busters is your best bet. Not sure when they open in the a.m. but pretty early. The Bakery also opens early....you might try there as well.
1437037,lunker99,2012-05-17 20:34:00,236,Is Busters on the west end of town? We ususally come in from the east so not sure what is past the intersection that goes north to Ear Falls.
1437043,v-bay gord,2012-05-17 20:44:00,3168,"Past the intersection is Fort Vermilion (on the north side of the highway) followed by the Bakery then the new chip truck........on the south side of the highway is Bobby's Corner (gas, tackle etc) and then Busters restaurant. Plus the turn off into ""downtown"" VBay which sports the Co-op store. Oh, on the highway is also the liquor store......a big attraction. So Lunker, you need to venture a bit further west to see the sights of vermilion bay!!!!"
1437089,JayM5209,2012-05-18 00:09:00,1050,"lunker, if you travel up 502 thru Dryden, the Trans Canada Motel and Restaurant is open early and serves a hearty breakfast. Right on Hwy. 17 - on the left side leaving town westbound toward Vermilion Bay."
1475552,billy8709,2012-08-16 10:49:00,2,"Kokums has so good food that is very filling and good prices, wish I could eat everyday. I love that burger!!! my only worry is the swearing and yelling when I go there. Not at customers but its not professional especially when kids around! Ihope the manager there knows there's a rumor someone working there has a warrant for there arrest. dunno if true but they should clear this up so people dont worry you know? Anyway I recomend that food to anyone it is worth the drive plus co-op & bobby's is so convenient."
1475592,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-16 12:35:00,235,"Flag is still at half mast here. We have since bought Subway sandwiches in International Falls and keep them on ice to eat in the car for dinner. We now gas up in Ear Falls at Kahooters (the Esso station). Foregoing the dinner stop does save time and basically ensures that we get through the 35 mile gravel road (to Kabeelo) during the day time. The Corner was our breakfast stop coming back, and we tried Trillium in Ear Falls this year...not bad, would probably go back."
1475602,teddi,2012-08-16 13:06:00,349,last time through it looks like there was some thing going on at the old travelers at the corner of 105. maybe it will be open soon.
1475671,Bobbajig,2012-08-16 16:53:00,24,"we stopped at Busters last June. I thought it was really good. Also get a bottle of their blueberry barbeque sauce, it is awesome."
1475834,Glenman12,2012-08-17 07:44:00,762,"3 of us stopped at Kokums on our way up in mid June..2 hot dogs, a burger, 2 cans of pop and and a can of beer was $32..we thought that was very pricey..food was good though.."
1475872,teddi,2012-08-17 08:53:00,349,beer from a chip truck?
1436929,v-bay gord,2012-05-17 15:24:00,3168,"Just a heads up to those travelling through V-Bay and needing a place to pick up a burger. In addition to Busters Restaurant (which is always good) there is now a chip wagon style setup across the highway from Bobby's Corner. It's called ""Kokom's Bannock Shack"" and I can vouch for the Bannock Burger. Other interesting menu items include an Indian Taco, Bannock Dog and Moose Balls. Of course check out Bobby's for some home made sandwiches and other items while you harass Alan in the tackle section! Have a good time fishing in NW Ontario! I am remiss to not mention the ""Bakery"" that is just west of the Fort Vermilion. She has some great coffee and baking, also some breakfast and lunch items. I should also say the ""Co-op"" in downtown V-Bay has a new butcher and the meat department is something else......definately worth the stop."
1436936,fishinnut 3446,2012-05-17 15:50:00,638,"Gord,Is Buster's that bbq place on the left?Last year before coming to camp we stopped for breakfast down that way and don't remember the name?But I do remember the 4 of us didn't like it,but then again it could have been an off day.And Gord I have to ask what's is and in a Moose ball?"
1436939,v-bay gord,2012-05-17 15:59:00,3168,"Yes, Buster's is the bbq place. I usually hear good things about the food, so maybe an off day? The menu describes Moose Balls as bite sized pieces of sweet bannock rolled in cinnamon and sugar.........sorry no moose ingredients that I can see."
1436942,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-17 16:06:00,298,Haven't eaten at Buster's myself but the couple we fish with eat there every year on their way up to camp. They always rave about it.
1436954,Glenman12,2012-05-17 16:33:00,762,Hi Gord Is Kokums basically like a fast food hot dog stand?..in and out in 15 mins or so?
1436979,wallydave,2012-05-17 18:42:00,2151,"A moment of silence for the Corner, it was always a nice place to stop going heading to camp and on our way home."
1436984,nitroman,2012-05-17 18:49:00,368,O how I miss the Village corner! It was a ritual last stop before camp!
1437006,wallydave,2012-05-17 19:43:00,2151,"Yea we now stop at Dutchies, they are from Iowa, moved up North to live their dream!"
1437011,lunker99,2012-05-17 19:48:00,236,Is there anything in Vermillion Bay that is open early and serves a good breakfast? Thanks.
1437025,v-bay gord,2012-05-17 20:21:00,3168,"Yes, that is exactly what it is. But the folks seem really keen, the food is all homemade and it is real native bannock, made fresh......so something a bit different."
