1475614,rocko0305,2012-08-16 13:42:00,138,"Hey guys,Our group of 12 that we've assembled for our trip next year on the Attawapiskat all know each other pretty well, and there are several of us that would like to swap partners several times throughout the week and fish with each other. With that said, we wanted to come up with some creative and competitive ways to bet against each other. Obviously, we are not going to be doing this the whole trip, only maybe a few times when everyone all heads out at the same time.Every year, we always put $20 in the pot for biggest walleye of the trip and $20 for biggest pike, but what I am looking for are some ideas as far as inches, card games based on fish caught, etc. that would be fun to do. I consider myself a Google wizard when it comes to searching the Internet, yet I can't find ideas out there.To give you an idea of what I am thinking, here are some of the things I have already brainstormed:- Total number of fish per boat- Total number of fish per boat - Every 10 walleye/5 pike get you 1 playing card back at the cabin. Best 5 card hand wins. Do you go after pike or sit over a walleye honey hole?- Total cumulative inches of 4 largest fish- Total cumulative inches of 4 largest fish - 2 walleye and 2 pikeThose are just some thoughts I threw together, but has anyone else tried any fun games on a trip? I don't need to hear about how that's not in the spirit of things blah, blah, blah because I agree. Like I said, this would just be a couple of times during the week to change things up and have a ""tournament"". Thanks."

1475638,packpro,2012-08-16 14:29:00,695,My boat partner bet me a buck for the next fish caught. As soon as I agreed he lifted his rod with a fish on the end of the line. Made us both laugh really hard. I cannot beleive I fell for that.
1475647,Lovetofish,2012-08-16 14:57:00,458,"My wife and two kids and I have a standing bet. The largest walleye and northern is $1 from everybody. In the end, nobody pays cuz the old man usually won."
1475648,NARDA 1,2012-08-16 14:58:00,636,"We have a dry erase board that we put on the wall of the cabin and record your largest walleye, pike and smallmouth to the nearest half inch. Then those lengths are added for a final score fore the week. Biggest total wins the pot. You can also do a side pot betting on if you better the highest score from previous years."
1475674,octanehi5,2012-08-16 17:00:00,1104,"How ever you want to do it, smallest Walleye per day, largest walleye per day,Smallest pike and largest per day. first and last walleye that day. pick a slot limit size like14""-17"" how many. Boat that hooks up two at the same time. angler that catches two at a time very hard.but has been done. reverse the hand of your reel and biggest fish you catch that way. I think you get the picture"
1475772,btmbncr,2012-08-17 00:14:00,492,I had to give my wife a back massage one evening for big walleye of the day.
1475781,HeHooksHimself,2012-08-17 04:57:00,725,I had to do the same for my wife for pulling out a snake pike. It happens.
1475788,Hawker,2012-08-17 05:24:00,3967,"We sorta do the same thing, but with a little ""twist""Fishing only allowed using jig & minnow/crawler/leech! (No steel leaders allowed) Everyone antes up $20 into a coffee can before heading out, winner collects can at the end of the day!Each boated walleye is worth one pointEach boated Pike is worth two pointsEach boated Yellow Perch is worth minus two pointsHighest ""plus"" score wins the pot! In the case of a tie, largest Walleye (length) breaks the tie!Since everyone is competing against each other, everyone keeps everyone honest! Sure makes for some funny stories at the end of the day, especially when a couple of the guys get into a pod of yellow perch and knock their scores into a nose dive!"
1475820,jimirjr,2012-08-17 07:09:00,1149,"My group has one additional ""standing mandate"".... He who catches the least number of fish during that day... does the dishes!"
