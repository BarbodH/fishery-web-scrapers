This is a report from our Kesagami Lake trip which highlights the food, fun and fishing our group of four experienced this past July. Enjoy. http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...howtopic=64689Bunk"
1476776,Ogoki,2012-08-20 05:17:00,291,"Enjoyed your trip report !!! Felt like I was there . Solo also does great trip reports . I usually read Walleye Central from my deck with my first cup of coffee each morning . I returned from Ontario this weekend from a bear hunt/fishing trip and I leave Thursday for a trip to a 35 mile section of the Ogoki River. I just can't get enough of Ontario , even after 35 fly-in trips , plus canoe trips and 10 archery bear hunts . Thanks for your reports guys !!!"
1476784,hoppy63,2012-08-20 05:56:00,367,Which outfitter will you use at ogoki? Species i suppose eyes and pike? Size wnd numbers you expect? Im with you.....could spend months in ontario if my wallet would let me.......and had a partner. Only been once and fell in love!
1476811,Ogoki,2012-08-20 07:29:00,291,"Hoppy63, This trip we are going to Whiteclay Lake . Don Elliot of Mattice Lake Outfitters recently purchased the outpost camps from Armstrong Outposts. I have fished Whiteclay 6 times in the past and I have fished Ogoki Reservoir 12 times . I prefer Ogoki Res but a friend from church set this trip up and invited me . Walleye and Pike are abundant . Ogoki Res has large numbers of walleye and large size . You can get into schools of 22 to 25 inch fish . Have taken 4 pike over 40 inches there , but Whiteclay has produced more big pike for us than Ogoki . My friend who I am going on this trip with, has been to Whiteclay over 35 times . He has been going there since 1971 . One trip to Whitclay i caught and released 12 pike over 38 inches . The scenery on Whiteclay is awesome too. There is a gorge there that is over two miles long . I know what you mean about the money part . I could spend the whole summer up there but it is getting pricey doing fly-ins ."
