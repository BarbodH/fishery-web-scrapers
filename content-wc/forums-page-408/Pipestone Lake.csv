1474437,Mike Kansas,2012-08-13 17:21:00,1463,Just had some friends get back from a week at Pipestone and they didn't do well fishing. The dock hands told them the lake has been terrible fishing for the last three years. Anybody else have any other or similar experience with Pipestone?

We had some great years and some not so great years. We fish at Lac Seul now, every year is a great year. It seems like every year you have to go further North to have great fishing. Back in the 70's we used to go to northern Minnesota and we thought we were in heaven."
