I do apologize for not better clarifying myself. The ad was only to tell people of road and fishing conditions in the area. The hosts of Mooshorn lodge, Doug and Roxann Lynn, are very gracious hosts and will cater to your every need. If anyone has any questions about the lodge, feel free to email me and i will be glad to respond.Thank you dctolle"
