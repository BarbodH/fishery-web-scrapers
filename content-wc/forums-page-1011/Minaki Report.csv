But as allways, be carefull. The orange marker on the end of the reef by the marina is about 2"" above the water. Water is over 5' high and still rising. Could explain some of the fishing we had. Fishing was very good as usual, but had to work on finding them. They are moving daily. Kill them one day, next they were gone. Go find em, again, next day gone. Kind of like a chess game, but it was fun and tested my skills.For those going up, Fish were most consistant on Burnt (Clay Banks) Wildedge did produce great for us on day on the mud flat. They were eating mayflies coming out of the mud. Lots of fish over 20. A-Frames are doing good, as well as the power lines down south of town. We did catch some fish trolling boards 70'in the evening once we saw the cisco busting the surface. Kinda early for that, but no one told the fish. Best advise I can give, is if you dont mark them on the graph, dont fish them. If you mark them and they arent biting, come back in an hour. They will feed. Game Wardens were out the last two days. I think they checked every single camp and cabin. One group got checked three times in one day! They were polite though, and it was painless. Weather was great. Not too windy, warm and only rained one day.Tight Lines,Ron ""Reels"" I'll let Musky Head Bill post how he did on the Toothy critters.Thanks Woods for sharing info on the water!"

They warned if we hit a fish check station they might make us thaw them out... That would suck. We did have live fish in the live well, and they were ok with that."

Please give us a report on your family trip in August, as I have thought of taking my family up there that time of year. We won't see you next year as we will be going a week later, but will be back to the same schedule the following year. This was my 15th year, and I still recommend Minaki as a place to go for a good fishing trip."
513521,Guest,2001-06-28 11:19:00,0,"Just returned and must admit that for someone that didn't eventarget Walleye,(I fish for smallies) I did quite well. As usual, the smallie fishing was great but I caught several bigwalleye (22+ inchers) with the biggest being 27 up on the biglake throwing a quarter ounce gold jig with a black twisty tailand a spinner. The walleye tore that thing up. They were all shallow and it really didn't matter what time of day it was and the weather was sunny to boot.....go figure? Best thing was we threw them all back.And for you Musky fisherman, I hooked a huge one about half way between Minaki and the Dalles. Fought it for five minutes before it straightened my spinner out. By far the biggest Musky I have seen. I would have liked to have gotten a picture of it but it just wouldn't let me get it to the boat. Oh well, didn't have a big enough net anyway.All in all the fishing was good. Good luck"
