513494,Pooch,2001-06-22 18:31:00,4619,Be safe and call them. Stores are sometimes closed in Canada on Sunday and watch out for holidays that we in the U.S. don't know about. As in the Bank Holiday or all Canada day. Wife and I have been almost caught short on a couple of trips without groceries! Sometimes you may find a small store open and sometimes not. The Safeway in Dryden is a really nice store. Wish we had it near our home down here.Pooch in central Illinois
513495,Jesse-WI,2001-06-22 20:07:00,534,I do not remember the exact hours but last year I think is was 10am-6pm.Everyone beware that on July 1st most everything is closed due to national holiday.
513496,Jigger1,2001-06-23 11:19:00,234,Any idea if there is a place to buy beer near by the Safeway in Dryden?
513497,Pooch,2001-06-23 17:48:00,4619,Bunch of places just north of Safeway along 17. Safeway does not have beer?Pooch
513499,Guest,2001-06-23 18:05:00,0,"Further...Safeway in Dryden may have limited hours of operation on Sundays. Usually, 12 -5PM. You can also shop at Walmart and/or a smaller grocery store called Economy Foods.If your headed further up to Sioux Lookout, you will find Johnnys Food Market for groceries etc. For liquor/beer you will find LCBO stores along the way, however they do have strange hours of operation.Hope this helps."
513498,Jesse-WI,2001-06-24 07:55:00,534,The beer store in Dryden is north of the Safeway by the tracks. The liquer store is about 1 block east of the beer store and 2 blocks south of the beer store. The attendants in Safeway are good at giving directions to these.

Don't know if they sell beer, but their cigarette prices are the lowest anywhere and they have to best bakery, especially the blueberry things."
