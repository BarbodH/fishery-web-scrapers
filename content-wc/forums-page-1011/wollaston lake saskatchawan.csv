513524,Guest,2001-06-25 12:32:00,0,Are you driving or flying in with an outfitter?
513525,paul,2001-06-25 17:16:00,38,we are flying into wollaston lake lodge. never been there and we are looking forward to it. do you know what lures would work at that time??
513526,Guest,2001-06-26 05:28:00,0,"If I were you I'd phone the lodge and ask a guide/owner what is working now. When I worked at reindeer lake different lures were successful at different times of the summer. Topwaters were great, but only for a couple of weeks. To be on the safe side I'd be sure to take some spoons, spinners, and jerkaits. Soft ones like slugos and crankbaits like husky jerks or smithwick rogues. Take lots of leaders or you'll end up losing all of it.Good Luck! I wish I was going."
