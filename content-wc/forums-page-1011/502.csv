513363,Walli,2001-06-19 08:03:00,63,Plan on heading to Dryden on June 29th. What is the lattest on condition? Is there construction in progress? My truck has lost a few parts in the past years on this one. I do enjoy the scenery but construction would not make it enjoyable. Thanks.

I think the sign said 25 K's of construction but the actual work zone was quite a bit shorter. I guess the decision would have to be based on day of week and time of day.lobo"

513367,RMB,2001-06-25 10:27:00,251,"Are you speaking of the dreaded red gravel slime that is nearly impossible to wash off? Apparently the road folks put down this calcium based spray on the gravel to keep the dust down in the summer and when it rains it is like a slick film that is really a pain to get off. If this is true, please tell because I will be leaving for Sioux Lookout on Thursday and I will take the Pigeon River crossing and all blacktop VS. the shorter but much messier route. I may drive 2 hours farther, but it would be 4-5 hours of washing. I think I'd rather drive!"
513368,slipbobber,2001-06-26 16:25:00,8,"yes i believe so,it had rained before we got to the gravel and any of the boats going the opposite way were just covered in the red lookung slimelater"
