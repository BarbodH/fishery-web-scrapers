Just wanted to say that if any of you guys are heading up to Minaki in the near future, look for me. I run a red lund (is there really any other colour that a Lund should be ?) 1775 Pro-V. Tiller. Check into the bar at Paradise Cove & chances are Pat will know where I am OR what I'm up to. She's like that....... ANyways, also be careful when running the lake areas. With the extremly high water, it has covered all them bad rocks, but has now created a whole set of new ones ! Just run the lakes as you would with ""normal"" water & chances are you'll be ok. One extreme area of caution is the reef that normally extends out of the water, the one just north of Green Island on the west side of the lake. It is completely under water now and cannot be seen until too late. No idea how safe it is to pass over, but we were thinking that it could be a dangerous spot.So, just beware of it.Good FishenRob"
