513384,Guest,2001-06-20 09:23:00,0,"Since there has been a lot of discussion on this topic I called the Canadian Consulate in Minneapolis ((612-333-4641) or visit their web site at http://www.can-am.gc.ca/menu-e.asp?mid=10 ) and learned the following:This is the entry requirements page for the Canadian Dept of Tourism web site:http://www.voyagecanada.ca/travelcan...CTId=28&num=44This is the initial set of requirements for entry into Canada:Visitor Requirements: U.S. ResidentsAlthough a passport is the ideal identification, you do not require a passport or visa to enter Canada. Just make sure you carry identification to establish your citizenship such as a Birth Certificate and least one ID card with photo. If you are a naturalized U.S. citizen, you should carry this certificate. Permanent residents of the U.S.A. must bring their ""Green Card"". Although it is rare, immigration officials may prevent the entry of visitors: -who appear to pose a health risk. -those they doubt will be able to support themselves and their dependents in Canada. -whose willingness and means to return to the U.S. is in doubt. As well, those admissible to Canada must not have a criminal record. This includes any convictions for driving while intoxicated. If you have questions about your admissibility to enter Canada, contact your nearest Canadian Embassy or Consulate for consultation.You will find a list of these Canadian contacts on the web site In talking to the people at the Minneapolis Consulate, s DWI is a felony in Canada so is treated very seriously. The immigration officer at the border has some discretion as to whether they check this and whether they allow a person who has a past conviction to enter the country. If the DWI is greater than 5 years old (as measured from the end of any sentence for a DWI conviction) then the person can apply for an Approval of Criminal Rehabilitation and pay a fee of $200 Canadian for entry. The officers sometimes allow you to do this at the border. When done in this manner however it is in effect a temporary process, good for one entry. If you go through the process before getting there and have the form submitted and approved it becomes a permanent step and you pay the $200 Canadian once in a lifetime (providing no future DWIs or other serious offences).If a person has multiple DWIs and or they are more recent, then the officer will most likely refuse entry. For these cases the person can still apply for a ""Ministers Permit"" which I think is the same fee and be able to gain entry. This is all at the discretion of the people at the border as to whether you are allowed to fill out this paper work there or have to go back and do it in the US.The forms are processed for this area of the country at the Canadian Consulate in Detroit (313-567-2085) so call them if you need the forms or have questions. The above reflects my notes on the phone call so I could have missed something or got something incorrect so if you are in this situation you should call the places noted and do the paperwork ahead of time to avoid a bad time at the border."
513385,Guest,2001-06-20 10:41:00,0,Does this apply only to the person that is driving and owns the vehicle? Or does this apply to all passengers in the vehicle?
513386,Hunter,2001-06-20 11:30:00,346,"It applies to all, If the owner of the car has been convicted, it pops up on there computer screen when they punch in Lic. plate number. There isnt usually enough time for them to check everyone in the car. If you look like a bunch of responsible people they usually will wave you right through. People have problems when they try and bring in goods they have to pay duty on. Or bring in an extra case of beer each, well you go in and pay duty and they punch your name in, bingo you just got put in a jackpot. Find out what you are allowed to bring in, and take less, you will have no problems."
513390,Guest,2001-06-20 11:32:00,0,What about children between 7 and 12 yrs old?
513391,whitey,2001-06-20 11:50:00,36,Greg: your 7 and 12 year old drink and drive?
513392,Guest,2001-06-22 07:30:00,0,"i bring my kid's across every year (same 9 and 12). had a problem 2 years ago because i didn't have a signed and notarized letter from their mother (my wife) stating that i could bring the kid's out of the country. i had to go into the immigration office with the kid's and they questioned them for 20 minutes tneh let us go. they wanted to know ""when was the last time you saw your mother"", ""does your father live with your mother?"" etc. etc. etc. it wasn't a big deal, but a delay and a hassle. bring the letter!"
513387,RANGER,2001-06-22 08:44:00,4341,"Hunter,I've been watching your posts regarding border crossings and this statement about getting on the ""jackpot"". Explain, please. Are you saying that this will put you on the ""suspect"" list for any future crossings resulting in stops and searches?Last year my partner and I had 2 cartons of cigarettes, each. We honestly thought it was OK. When asked I told the officer straight out. We ended up paying the duty at the border. Now, am I in the ""jackpot""?RANGER""KEEP YOUR LINES WET, YOUR POWDER DRY and THE BEER COLD!"""
513388,Hunter,2001-06-23 06:11:00,346,"Ranger no you wouldnt be a marked man at all. What im saying is there are ways around situations like these, may not be totally legal or should I say honest. But if there is no reason to be pulled over you are in good shape. When someone is brought into the little building to pay duty, there name is put into a computer ""to make a reciept"", at the same time there name is being run just like the lic. plates are being run. If there is a problem you will find out about it now. If you have a suspect past, dont drive in your vehicle and dont bring anything that you will have to go and pay duty on, and your name will not be run and you shouldnt have a problem. Canadian govt will not even know you are here.This law was put into effect because of very undesirables were coming over here and dealing theyre crack, they can get 10 times the price for it in Canada. Also we were getting criminals from other countries moving here and claiming refugee status, meanwhile they have heard welfare is easy to get, healthcare is paid for, and the law is lenient. Well my friend, I as a Canadian am sick and tired of paying for these peoples free ride. If we can get them out of the country, we want them gone. Unfortunately this also had an effect on our brothers to the south. It was not intended to keep someone out that made a mistake and is coming to visit for a week or two. But customs has found it is a cash cow, and they are taking advantage of it. My Ole Lady is a customs officer, she and her coworkers agree the HONEST people are getting screwed, and the undesirables are just using someone elses I.D. and walking right in. DONT BLAME THE OFFICERS IT COMES FROM HIGHER UP!"
513393,Guest,2001-06-23 15:55:00,0,"my wife and i were taking our grandson on vacation. we were in seattle and decided to take the ferry boat ride across to victoria in british colombia. when we arrived there and were disembarking the boat, we were taken to the border guards and had to answer a lot of questions. they asked our grandson who we were? and did his mother know where he was at. did we have permission to take him out of the country? if our grandson had answered any of these questions wrong, my wife and i would have been in big trouble. we were permitted to go on our way. we were also happy that the canadian border guards were that diligent and watchful. how many children are taken from their parents and taken to canada we may never know. but my wife and i are grateful that they take an active role to see that it doesnt happen. get written permission fromthe parents before taking any children on vation wheather you think you are going to cross any border or not. you might decide to cross the border on the spur of the moment like we did. pepe"
513394,bigfish1965,2001-06-26 20:19:00,3210,"You have to understand that it is common for children who have been kidnapped by a non-custodial parent to be smuggled into Canada, where they feel unlikely to be caught or reckognized. The immigration officers are protecting your children by asking these questions. Remember Canada is a foreign country and you need proper identification."
513395,Backwater Eddy,2001-06-27 04:19:00,3871,"Good point!If you are a person who has joint custody or do not have full custody of your children and enter into Canada for any reason be sure to have some written documentation from the custodial parent as well as there birth records on your person.I checked into this last year when planning a trip to catfish with my son in Canada. I was strongly advised to cover all bases and get a written release from my x-wife that stated where we were going and when we plan to return. Yes, this is due to the fact that parental abductions are the #1 cause of a child's disappearance, I do see there point, but a guy still feels like a criminal just trying to arrange a vacation with his son. If it slows or halts the abductions of children I guess I can live with the inconvenience!Backwater Eddy...><,,>"
513396,duffy,2001-06-27 04:28:00,49,Fly into canada and you won't have these problems. Customs is easy and it's more relaxing and you get more fishing time.
513397,Guest,2001-06-28 06:47:00,0,not true! the problem above occurred when i flew in to winnepeg. i've driven accross with the kid's several times without a problem.
513389,RANGER,2001-06-25 09:09:00,4341,"Appreciate the reply, thank you. For anyone else reading this, the duty on cigarettes is high. For two cartons we had to pay $28 can total. I believe that is a lot higher than the duty for beer.RANGER""KEEP YOUR LINES WET, YOUR POWDER DRY and THE BEER COLD!"""
