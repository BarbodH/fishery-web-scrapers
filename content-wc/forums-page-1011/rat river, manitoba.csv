513136,Guest,2001-06-09 18:19:00,0,Just curious if anyone has ever fished the rat river system in northwestern manitoba. I have fished it for about 10 years now and was curious to hear others' stories and their success. Time of year and location on the resorvoir.

513138,Guest,2001-06-10 18:01:00,0,"So you fished below the dam? Can you just walk down there and fish anywhere? We have always drove past the dam towards leif rapids and put in at the campground on the swanee river. From there we boat 11 miles (18 km) or so to rat lake and camp out there. Great fishing for pike and walleye. Wish I lived a little closer. I'm about 1800 km away, in Minnesota. (Think thats the right conversion, 1100 miles). Anyway, do you have any info on other lakes in the area you could share? Mainly looking for trophy pike to catch and release. We always talk about stopping and trying some other lakes up there, but don't want to waste a day looking when we only have a few days up there and its so far away. Thanks for any info you may have. Steve."

513140,Guest,2001-06-18 18:21:00,0,My computer won't let me email you directly from the postings for some reason. I would appreciate hearing about some of the spots you're talking about. Email me at [email protected] Thanks again. Steve
513141,Guest,2001-06-26 14:52:00,0,Northern Manitoban...Can you email me the list of lakes around Thompson you were talking about. I can't get your email address off of this page for some reason. Thanks. Steve [email protected]
