513530,netboss2005,2001-06-25 07:37:00,4,"[font size=""1"" color=""#FF0000""]LAST EDITED ON Jun-25-01 AT 09:48AM (CST)[/font][p]10 guys including I went to Manotak Lodge from June 15th to the 24th. The people were nice but the owner was kind of a Dick. The fishing sucked. Each person only caught about 20 fish the whole week. We did go on a fly in and caught the #### out of fish there. We limited out in about 3-4 hours. The cabins needed a lot of work, the roofs leaked, the furnace was broken, and the toilet was broken. George was one of the coolest people there, he is the dock manager. The whole time we were there the owner and the guides kept making excuses on why we didn't catch fish but they need to realize that the lake is fished out. The one guide was a jerk and told us that we didn't know how to fish, of course he is going to know where the fish are he has lived there his WHOLE life. If I brought him here (Michigan) to fish he wouldn't know how to catch fish or where to find them."
513531,Guest,2001-06-25 09:55:00,0,Were you with Moose from MI's group? I know he also was going to be there last week. I had communicated with him a couple of times via email and was waiting on his report before making my final lodge decision.
513533,Guest,2001-06-26 03:12:00,0,The lodge was sold over the winter although Rej and Linda were there for 2 weeks this spring to orient the new owners. Rej and Linda are enjoying retirement in Eastern Ontario. It's too bad that group had a poor time there. It may just take some time for the new owner to get squared away. I was there again last summer-the lake was most definately NOT fished out. Chuck C.
513532,netboss2005,2001-06-26 13:43:00,4,Yes I was with moose mi's group
513534,netboss2005,2001-06-26 13:46:00,4,The new owners were running the camp when I and the group were there. I dont know what happend to the fishing between the time you were there and the time I was there but I know for a fact that the fishing sucked. No one in the entire camp had good fishing results.
513535,Moose_MI,2001-06-28 03:49:00,31,"Well....here's my report....The trip....we crossed the border around 06:00 Saturday morning...No problems..no line to speak of. On the way back they had a fish check about 3 miles before the border on highway 11....seemed to be mostly interested in people with boats...we breezed right on through. We stopped in Dryden Safeway for groceries...a great store!! ...wonderfull Filet Mignon!! 502 and 105 were ok to travel. Not great roads and a little construction, but not bad. If your a little uneasy about your trailer or tires you might want to take the alternate route on 71. Gas prices were pretty much in line with everywhere else.The lodge...not bad, but they could use some work. 1 of cabins roof leaked, furnace didn't work but electric space heaters were provided, toilet handles were broken and had to manually lift the ball #####, water pressure was minimal most of the day...water would stop a couple times while trying to shower or wash dishes, no pay phone (either collect calls or calling card that they sold at the camp store...imagine that) other than this they were in pretty good workin order. Boat motors were on there 3rd yr and supposedly getting replaced next year...they ran. Boats were kinda leaky, but they stayed on top of the water. The lodge was very nice and the meals served there were very good. The new owner, Dave, tries to be personable but he has to work at it. George that runs the dock is the nicest guy in the world...trouble is none of them have fished the lake and they had little advice for us that worked. Guides seemed to do much better than the un-guided...If you get a guide...ask for Alfred (I think).Fishing....was tough for us. First time on the lake, no guides, and no good advice from new lodge owners. None of us are pro fisherman, but I guess our point is you shouldnt have to be a pro to catch a limit of 4 walleye in a couple hours in Ontario...right?... Anyway for the week I caught 12 walleye on Perrault fishing a average of 5 hrs a day. I never fished for northern...biggest northen for the week was 30"". We caught some real nice perch and a few small mouth. White jigs, with white 3"" twisty tails tipped with minnow/crawler. Mostly I back trolled looking for a concentration of fish to jig...never found them. Tried the Musky lake 1 day....nice lake...lots of musky follows...2 were caught.Did 2 day trip Fly-In's to Twain lake...WOW WOW....what a great time that was!!! *** I have went to my last drive in camp!! *** The first fly in we put about 40 Walleye in each boat...the 2nd about 80...it was unbelievable ... we had 4 fish on at a time! This is what I drive 1000 miles for!Summary....As drive in's go...Manotak probably falls right in line with the rest. I think the new owners are still gettin there act together. If you go...get a guide at least for the first couple days. $125 for a day trip fly-in...go to Sazania or Twain. We will never go back to any drive in. Our primary reason for going to Canada is to catch (and release) fish...lots and lots of fish. If the fishin is good, nothing else matters. For this reason we will do fly ins from now on. The drive in lakes simply have to much pressure on them. They still have fish, but you have to know how to fish them. When your only there for 5 days once a year, you cant afford to spend your time trying to figure out where the fish are....Were going to idiot proof remote lakes where we can slam the fish!!!Moose"
