Specifically, we're interested in waters in and around Laverendrye Park. How's the fishing? How are the water levels? Road conditions? Bugs? We're heading up there in another week. Thanks in advance for any info."

How many Walleye and How big were they?Thanks in advance for your reply, I am desperatly trying to get some info on that area.Greg"
513505,Guest,2001-06-28 08:02:00,0,"greg, i have seen the sign for pavillion wapus. what lake is that lodge on? have you been there before? do they have a website? we don't fish for pike anymore as we concentrate on walleye and do some laker fishing also. i caught one small laker this year trolling deep with a flutter spoon. it was a perfect eating size fish (approx. 4 -5 pounds) so we kept it and gave it to the lodge owner. the walleyes were biting in early am and evening but we had dreaded clear skies and extreme heat, and those conditions are not ideal. the eyes average about 18"", our biggest was 20.5"" let me know how you do. if your after pike, shouldn't you folks be up alot earlier in the year like late may/early june to get them in the shallows?"
