They are located on Myers Bay in Vermilion Bay.Reef"

513340,Guest,2001-06-18 16:42:00,0,A group of us will be fishing Eagle lake late July and early August. We'll be staying just out of Vermilon Bay. We've fished Eagle for the past 4 years but always in the spring or fall and on a section of the lake closer to Eagle River.Anyone out there know this area of the lake and what we might expect in mid-summer? Any help would be appreciated!
513341,Guest,2001-06-19 05:47:00,0,"Larry,Myself and two others will be fishing for the first time out of Temple Bay at the end of August, Any tips or areas to fish for first timers on the lake.ThanksMark"
513342,Guest,2001-06-19 07:55:00,0,TerryWe fish out of Helen's (Birch Point I think) and see lots of Temple Bay boats. I'll be out today but why don't you give me your e-mail and i'll get back with some specific info. Could even mail you a map. I'm at [email protected]
513343,Guest,2001-06-19 07:57:00,0,Sorry Mark - I had just written to a Terry and still had the name in my mind. (getting old!)
513344,Guest,2001-06-20 15:33:00,0,"Vermilion Bay is not that much different than the big lake during that time of year. Look for the submerged reefs in the bay or slide down to Portage Bay (unmarked rocks exist in Portage Bay, be careful) and on the reefs there. The ride down to Eagle Lake through back channel isn't that bad if you have30 or 40 horse, probably close to an hour. Try the area around Connaught Point as well. If your in the bay, try going out the west arm, but watch for the rocks (most are marked).Also you can get up clearwater creek to cleawater lake (Delano on some maps) which holds some big walleyes. If you go up to clearwater there is one big island, fish the side closest to where you came in where you will be able to see some really large boulders in the water. Clearwater is a trip, but hit and miss and you should try and stay up on a plane and expect a little prop damage even then. Watch extremely closely the last straight stretch that goes into the lake. I slow down and have someone in the bow, there a a few nasty rocks but you can miss them if you take your time. I'd look for fish in 20 to 40' of water on reefs. You can always get some decent eaters around round island and strawberry in about 12-15 feet of water.Good Luck"
513345,Guest,2001-06-21 04:48:00,0,Thanks for the info Reef! I will be doing some homework over the next few months. Thanks againMark in Mpls
513346,Guest,2001-06-21 06:09:00,0,"ReefThanks for the help. Most of our trips to Eagle have been in the spring when we were finding eyes in 6-10 feet in shallow bays like Muskeg, Blind and little bottle lake. Knew we would have to find deeper water in early august. Because this is a new area for us we would considere a quide for 2-3 days. Are you familiar enough with the area to know one?"
513347,Guest,2001-06-21 06:16:00,0,"Reef, by the way we've fished Connaugt point in years past but were not there this spring."
513348,Guest,2001-06-22 07:14:00,0,check out www.andymyerslodge.com go to fishing reports and you'll get all the info you need.
513349,Guest,2001-06-22 08:16:00,0,"FishslayerThanks for the help, but when I go to the site you mentioned its titled andymeyerslodge but the content of the page indicates it is meant for setting up your own web site-no info regarding lodge or fishing reports. I'm not computer literate-is there somthing I'm missing?"
