We fish at St. Catharines , near Niagara Falls. The walleye are monstrous here, and from now untill November are quite plentiful. Last night, I got two in the first 10 minutes I was there. The first was 5lbs. the second was 7 lbs. I have caught them up to 16 lbs., and a 15lb 2oz. monster, that was not a survivor after getting hooks in the gill rakers, adorns my wall. Anyone who is going to be in the area, e-mail me and I'll give you the info. For best results..fish weekdays(no boat traffic), warm nights with little wind , and if possible fish the full moon. There are tons of alewives and shad spawning here and the moon lights up their courtship dance, bringing in tons of [email protected]"

I'm in Minnesota and will be visiting he and his family sometime later this summer. We tried in vain last year to find a good guide out of the Niagra river area and ended up with a last second stint with a local. We fished the river delta where it dumps into Lake Ontario and didn't catch a single eye. We are both interested in paying someone to take us out for some trophy fishing. If this is something you'd consider please let me know and we can talk. Normally I wouldn't ask, but if you don't ask you don't get!"

513566,RMB,2001-06-26 21:30:00,251,"Really??? Wow! That would be great! My bud and I are both 40. I am an accomplished walleye angler, and he knows enough to catch on to new techniques quickly. The least we could do would be to pay for fuel, bait, beverages, and probably a good dinner. Please email me at: ( [email protected] )and we can discuss details. The same would go for yourself if you're ever out in Minnesota. I live smack dab in the middle of the best walleye fishing the state has to offer and am an addict. Drop me a line. If I don't respond right away it's because I'm taking a few clients up to Ontario for the better part of a week on Thursday. Look forward to hearing from you."
