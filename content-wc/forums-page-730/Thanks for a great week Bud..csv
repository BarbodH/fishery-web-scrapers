If you'd care to visit more in detail, you can drop me an e-mail at [email protected]. It would be interesting to have a local contact to visit with preceeding and after my trips to Gullrock. I usually come up once or twice a year. Thanks"

552171,sifty,2005-09-19 07:47:00,46,Our group has been going to Gullrock for About ten years. This was the first time at five lakes resort and we all enjoyed our stay. As usuall the fishing was spoty but the last two hours of the trip were some of the best fishing I've ever experianced. No lunkers this year 23 1/2 inch won the big fish title for the seven guys fishing. The cabin was nice. Having two bathrooms and two fridges came in handy. Thanks for everything Bud. Sifty.
552173,Guest,2005-09-19 15:26:00,0,I'm glad to hear you guys enjoyed the cabin. I hope you had a safe trip home. Sometime you're going to have to try the muskie lake.

552183,Guest,2005-09-20 09:53:00,0,"grt1, those minnows are good but even better when there towed behind Gullrock Tackle. Boy that fog was bad yesterday! Now about that new hump?"
552191,grt1,2005-09-20 15:51:00,259,"youve probably driven over it a thousand times, found it by accident and I've never seen anyone on it. I guess it's a secret spot now"

Afternoons were typically slow, but mornings were all pretty good. We had a group of 12 and nearly everyone had the fortune to catch at least one over 26"". Pat T"
