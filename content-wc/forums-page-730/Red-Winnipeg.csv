551575,Todd_NE,2005-08-18 08:39:00,1330,"Thought this was worth another post, I wrote this last year. By the way. Oh Yeah goes Lac Seul, everyone to to Gold Pine Camp at Lac Seul! Just teasing ya. Good luck wherever you go. You pack and check everything twice, three times, four times. You look for your ID's. Did I bring enough clothes? Will it rain or will it snow this year, it always does one or the other. Is everything alright with the suburban, is my oil ok on the boat and should I crimp a bunch of hook barbs and put those lures in one box so I don't forget to do that on the water. You pull out of your driveway hoping for good weather, good fishing, and to catch up with friends. For me it's usually after work on a Wednesday and before you know it your in Fargo or somewhere crashing around Midnight, trying to get a few hours of sleep or if you have enough guys driving all night to be at the launch at sunrise. Ahhh, the border. Things seem the same as they did when I was a kid going into Canada. You get asked a few questions, fess up to some beer and smokes and away you go. Only twice in my whole life have I had to pull over. You get the feeling the border guard wants to go along. Pretty soon you realize you are actually in Canada. The roads are made different, things are in French, and you wonder how much faster you can go than the 100 km sign without getting pulled over. Winnipeg looms and you know the way around the city to the east. Geese are everywhere and you wonder why the city never seems to grow any further east or southeast. You pass the Maple Leaf pork sign and think to yourself, I'll be back to the neighborhood some night this week Do we go to the Red or the Winnipeg. That's been decided but you always think you are going to the wrong one, the bite is better at the other. Suddenly you are in the Red River drainage heading north, maybe a skim of snow or frost and you are looking for the road to Pine Falls. Get to Clarks Corner, get the licenses and herd everyone through the rest room one last time for the day. Suddenly it hits you that forgot food for the boat. Grab a few things and head to the ramp. The road is still bumpy and you still thank the paper company for having it. You wonder why the province or town doesn't put in a facility, oh well, you're just glad to have anywhere to launch. You see all the license plates from everywhere, usually Manitoba, then Iowa, Minnesota, ND, SD, NE in order of numbers. What a mix of rigs! You get everthing into the boat, try not to forget anything and getted backed in. You think to yourself, why do the same guys park in the turning area every day, oh well, at least the road isn't icy today. You back in, pray she starts and idle around a bit. You just realize that your buddies are going to get mud and rocks all over your boat, oh well. It's a small price to pay. Now you're heading north. If you are lucky you have a windshield. Locals are fishing the river in snowmobile suits and you try to be respectful but make a good pace too. You are trying to remember where the two big rocks are and remind yourself to ""Stay Right"" most of the way, especially at the mouth. Out to the rocks we go, ooops. Too many boats, maybe we'll fish the snowmobile sign side. Ah heck, there's room and boats are on both sides. You idle down when you hit the drop off and come up to about 11'. You hand out linecounter rods with lures on them. Maybe a 8 pearl shad rap with some blue dots, a fire tiger 9 and a blue/red Jr Thunderstick. Put some juice on lures and send them out until they tick bottom. Remind the guys to check their drags, leave them a little loose and put on the clickers. It feels good to have the kicker going, everything is working and you're on top of the world. You wonder how many guys out here fishing you know or have seen the past ten years. A few hundred feet and you get your first 18"" fish. It looks good for supper and you throw it in. A few more fish come in and you see the jiggers are doing ok too. It's a city on the drop-offs. ZZzzzzzz FISH ON. There is a scramble as someone grabs a rod and you kick the motor down a notch if it's a big girl which you already know it is. You want to grab the net but you know it draws more attention than a helicopter at a state fair. The reeler says ""I'm down to 20', she seems pretty good."" You extend the net and make sure the boat is pointed away from everyone. The other rods are up and you put it in neutral. Suddenly you hear, ""Ohhhhh man, back out to 27"". Now you KNOW, this is a greenback and she just realized what happened. She comes up to 5' and you still can't see her but you all know it's the one. Your standing on your back deck in your goose hunting clothes and you want so badly to put in a big fish for your friend, it's their first trophy and you don't want to miss with the net. ""Go easy, your fine. Get her up one more time and I'll get her. I promise."" You sense more than see that she's coming. Focus on the head and net her quick. In the bag... My god. After a summer of normal fish you just don't know how to act. You are shaking like a leaf and you can't believe it. A 10, 12, or 14# walleye doesn't look real in your boat. It looks like another species. They are SO big. The head, the eyes, the fins, the belly. They are as thick as your leg. ""OK, can you hold her? Just like this and support her belly. You're going to release her right? Good man. Ok, let's get a few quick pics and video."" The other boats know now and they redouble their efforts, some make a trolling pass coming way to close. Others talk about it on the radio. Some are thinking big deal, ""been there done that"". Your buddy leans over the side of the boat with the fish in his hands. You can see on the video later how the big girl realized she was free and swam off, splashing everyone in the process. You ask your buddy how he feels and he can't even talk, just shakes his head and says, ""Wow, that was awesome. She was so big. Everyone else is teasing about the rod position he used, how she ran a few times, how you were worried about the net job."" Everyone high fives and you try to decide whether to keep going or make the same pass again. Lines and hooks are checked and you know why this is your favorite week of the year. Later you clean a few fish and wonder if the bears around this year, by morning you'll know for sure. Nothing like a fish fry with a few snowflakes in the air. Should we go back to Winnipeg for a little entertainment or to meet up with RTMG? Maybe eat at the Manitou, man the scallops and foccacia are good. Maybe the Red is hot, that could be fun too. Decisions Decisions. A few more times out. Hopefully lots of fish, maybe everyone gets a trophy, maybe they don't. You see the nets and get a little steamed but it's not your water or your country. Every moment the last day is savored. Time moves far too fast, even if the fish aren't going. Now you're on your way home. The boat is a little tired, little messy but pretty happy because she has done what she was born for. A feeling of dread sets in though. You know how lucky you are to have fished here, good fishing or not, but now work looms. You miss your wife though, and the dogs and you wonder what's happened in the world. It's the only time you don't read newspapers all year long. You wonder if any of these geese will be in your field over you decoys later this year. Will the nets ever get under control? Will the world record be broken? Should you get some pierogies to take home and you wonder why I can't get gravy on my fries in Nebraska and how will fish taste without vinegar. Suddenly you're trying to decide what kind of perfume to buy with your lodging tax refund at the border store. Hmmm, seems dumb but your wife always is happy when you bring home something nice. Sure wish I could bring home more than one bottle of Gibson's Rye Whiskey, can't find that at home! Now you are in the US border crossing. Pull over, look through everything, ""Ya, I'll untarp it"". And no they are just doing their jobs but you don't think you look much like a terrorist except for the long whiskers and faraway look in your eyes. Look at the beets piled everywhere. Things are in English only again. You last thought is I wish I could go with the guys going north on I-29. Is that guy fishing or duck hunting, hmmm. Todd 20"" is good. 30"" is better. ""Me First"" Irrigators + Barge Industry + Bought Politicians = Bad Fishing"

Talked to the owner on Friday AM and he is looking at opening earlier. Minnow are in good shape and of decent size. $3.50 a dozen. As far as the fishing went, River produced well on Friday morning. Brought home a 20"", 18"" and a 16"". Something even sized fish that day? Lots of Drum, Bass, etc. No walleyes in the bay. Weather moved in at friday noon and everything died. Same was pretty much the same story yesterday. Lots of smaller walleyes no size. Water temperature was in the high 63...to low 64. Roger"

I think my wife has went from laughing at the idea to promoting it when I've earned it someday :) By the way, I've been getting a lot of emails at home from people wanting info and tips. I sure hope no one thinks I'm an expert up there. There are guys that have forgotten more than I'll ever know. The biggest piece of advice I can give, in all sincerity, is get out on the water. I know when we're up there we're about the first on and the last off. A lot of people don't get up early and give up early, that's the wrong approach even in bad weather. It can be hard to get motivated when you can't untarp the boat when it's frozen down - I know - but do it and get moving! Unless a fish is looking at your lure, you aren't fishing. You just have stuff in the lake. Todd ""Tell the cook this is low-grade dog food. This steak still has marks where the jockey was hittin' it."""

My last day out was Monday spent a few hours out on the flats in the afternoon. Went through 3 packs of bait the drum and perch were driving us crazy, only managed to keep 7 small walleyes (2 of us). Water temp is 66 deg. Water is extremly high only a few little rocks are sticking out at Robinsons Rock. Hydro has cut the flow down to try to compensate for all the water on the lake. There is flow but its not screaming out of the dam that is for sure. There is a small one day tournament here on the weekend, put on by our local Jr team. They are expecting about 60 boats, this may give a better indication of what is going on out there. I don't expect there to be any big weights, although you never know someone may put a couple together. My prediction 12-15 lbs will win. who knows...."

We'll talk on the water and meet in the ""Nitecrawler Pub"" at the Papertown in the evening. I'll buy the first round. :cheers: Todd_NE I have eaten at the Manitou, excellent food. Breakfast at the Broadlands or Papertown, lunch on the water, dinner at the Papertown, Manitou, or at the ""BEST"" dining establishment in Pine Falls my friends house, (man can he and his wife prepare a meal). They serve drinks on the viranda or in the garage where all the guys hangout. It not unusual to have a dozen+ people rotating through, telling stories, when you hear people talk of the good life, this truly is it. :) :cheers: Bob-Indiana It seems to me that later October is better than earlier, as some have mentioned it can be a hit or miss for the ""BEST"" timing, (always good though). The weather can get nasty later but its only natural the ""Greenback"" migration chasing after those tasty shiners would be greater in numbers the later in the season one were to go.

551573,Todd_NE,2005-08-18 08:30:00,1330,"I'd shoot for Oct 1-20th. The river locks start closing at the Red sometime in early to mid-October. That can goof up the fishing over there for awhile. There are some tourneys on both rivers about that time too. Every year is different Bob, depends on the weather, water levels, forage, moon, and stuff I still haven't figured out. Try mapquest for a guess on your trip time. I think if it was my first time up there I'd maybe even fly in and fish with both Cats on the Red and maybe Leon over at the Winnipeg, or GMS or someone. If you post you are looking for guides they can respond to you here I think with WC's blessing then have your conversation via email. Try to see both systems. We made the mistake of only fishing the Red a number of years, now we let the fish tell us where to go. Burr, we've never met, be nice to meet you up there this year. We'll come in on the 8th. You guys have to try eating at the Manitou at night. WOW do they put out the food, it's unbelievable. It's the kind of place you could take your wife for Valentine's Day and you both like it. Release the pigs! Todd 20"" is good. 30"" is better. ""Me First"" Irrigators + Barge Industry + Bought Politicians = Bad Fishing"
551461,Todd_NE,2005-08-15 13:22:00,1330,"I'm in for my annual trip on Oct 7 this year. Last year was the first since 96 I've missed it, ouch! Any predictions? I hear the water is HIIIIIIGGGGHHHH and that a few greenies are swimmin' in already! Todd 20"" is good. 30"" is better. ""Me First"" Irrigators + Barge Industry + Bought Politicians = Bad Fishing"
551485,lund115,2005-08-15 18:16:00,698,"Yes, the way it looks it should be a great year with the water so high. A lot of things can change from now to then, but Things are shaping up for a great run."
551515,Todd_NE,2005-08-16 15:11:00,1330,"I'll have to start waking up the Husker Barbie, Bluejay, Miss NF, and Jerry Garcia Shad raps! Not too mention Walleye Flashers and Thundersticks. The special tackle box with the Hall of Fame lures that have went before and suffered the wrath of sumo piggy walleye teeth must be honored. They have already given all they have yet they continue to go and be honored for their previous accomplishments. It's time to add the new lures and make them reverential of grizzled and tooth ridden lures who have gone before. A scared lure is an erratic lure. Todd 20"" is good. 30"" is better.

551530,Guest,2005-08-17 01:02:00,0,"I can hardly wait for that time to come again. 4 weeks and those piggies should be coming in. Can't wait to actually set the hook on a 24+ fish, or have the chance too. Don't get me wrong, I luv me 14-18 inch walleyes in Min, but am ready for that heavy log. Things are looking good with the water levels, but evan if its just an average year, it's still the exitement of catching tha 10+. What a rush only 53 days and I'm up their. I already have the count down going. Any one else as excited as me, or do I have a problem."
551532,Guest,2005-08-17 07:40:00,0,"Todd, Looks like we are going to miss one another again. I am going the weekend of the Oct 1 and the weekend of Oct 15. You aren't a kiddin about being ready. Water levels seem to be high and the fish should be in. I hope the netting quota is complete by then as they seem to be in the way and take a lot of fish. Here's to a great ""greenback hunt!"" This will be consecutive year number 16 for me. Last 6 have been less than spectacular but the last two years were improving noticeably with last year being the best in 6... Oh Canada... my favorite trip of the year, every year! Here I come!"
551533,walley250,2005-08-17 07:56:00,161,"It's great to see these kind of posts begin. I have been loosing sleep for about two weeks now. This will be my fourth trip up there. We will be there for a whole week, so I hope we get the time of year right. 59 Days!!!"
551534,Todd_NE,2005-08-17 07:59:00,1330,"2000 and 2001 were the holy grails for me as far as fishing. But it dramatically declined for us in 2002 & 2003. Lot of theories out there - netting, forage, fish coming in later, water levels. All I know in a bad year it can still be awesome. I met a guy up there once who used to live up the lake a ways. He claimed he caught a 39.5"" fall fish in the Manigatogan (sp?). Perspective on that - I've had two in the boat over 14#'s and neither was over 32.5"". Those fish are the heaviest per inch I've ever encountered. Started to watch old video's this week. It's giving me the shakes! Todd 20"" is good. 30"" is better.

551543,Guest,2005-08-17 10:00:00,0,"never been up there for the run... heard a lot about it . i have fished in canada quite a bit , but i am totally ignorant about the walleye run. can i rent boats up there? any good lodges? any pricing on lodges , boats, put-in spots, etc would be much appreciated!"
551548,Guest,2005-08-17 12:30:00,0,"There is a couple of outfitters there that will guide for you but not much for boat rentals. Do a search on Pine Falls, or Papertown Manitoba as well as the ""greenback hunter"" or ""greenback"" and you may be able to find some links to someone that will help you. Remember, warm cloths. If you don't have them, get them! This time of year is frequently the turn of the season, often fishing in 25Mph winds, 3 footers with snow from time to time. Usually the weather hits low 50's Fahr. but typically pretty windy. Worth it if you want a shot at a 10lb plus walleye every day you are there."
551551,Todd_NE,2005-08-17 12:59:00,1330,"You aren't the Bob that duck hunts the missouri river near Niobrara are you? The places to stay in Pine Falls are the Papertown or Manitou, they come up on searches easy, you can email Laurent at papertwn AT mts.net (take out the AT and put in a @, there is no ""o""). Selkirk/Red River is the Daerwood Inn I believe or even better look up ""Cats on the Red"" near Lockport, south of Selkirk. there is another sorta dive motel between Selkirk and Winnipeg, worst thing happens stay in North Winnipeg somewhere or up in the Grand Beach area. For guides you can look it up on the net but Stu McKay guides on the Red, Leon from Pine Falls has a B & B and guides on the Winnipeg and I think GMS from the board a few other guys guide on both. I apologize for missing anyone, I know I correspond with guys occasionally but don't know what they are planning this fall. Lorne Weir and Jim Hyslop may still guide, not sure. RTMG/Rob Carlson may guide this fall too if you beg???? Greattttt guy. It's WORTH the cost of a guide for at least a day at either place!!!!! I've never had a bad day with a guide and always felt I got my money worth just from the questions I asked and friends I've made. I have some info on my website also, not trying to promote it, don't take me wrong. Also - search here on walleye central for greenback, pine falls, selkirk, red river, winnipeg river, etc. Todd 20"" is good. 30"" is better.
