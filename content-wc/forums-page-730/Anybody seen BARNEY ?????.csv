551969,Guest,2005-09-08 08:22:00,0,"I will be setting in my van next to the road in Dryden starting next Thursday watching for Barney to pass by. Im planning on following him with my camera crew so I can get some footage on how the little rascal catchs all those big fish. Last year I had my crew set up on a ridge above him and the footage was awesome. Barney gets upset when we hover with our helicopter over him while he is fishing. In fact two years ago he stood up on the boat seat and threw Coke cans and a tire iron at us. He is a scraper for only being 4' 10"" tall."
551971,Guest,2005-09-08 10:03:00,0,"Barney would make a nice ""Short Article"" in the Times."
551972,Guest,2005-09-08 10:22:00,0,"I DID see Barney waxed by a semi, next to the moose. End of Barney. Thankfully."
551979,Guest,2005-09-08 12:18:00,0,I see that you are still sick.....try an enema...it will clear what ailes you.
552138,Guest,2005-09-15 16:23:00,0,I heard he was rescuing folk on Canal St. in New Orleans and drowned when he jumped out of the boat in the knee deep water.
552236,Guest,2005-09-26 08:48:00,0,Last time I saw Barney he caught a Ellpout and a Carp on the English River below Ear Falls. He was also odering Flowers for his sweetheart on his cell phone. He is such a little romantic fella.

551713,Guest,2005-08-23 14:05:00,0,Its about time for Barney to rear his little bald head. I heard he is heading to the Ear Falls area in the near future and the Walleye are shaking in their little boots.
551714,Guest,2005-08-23 14:12:00,0,I saw Barney the other day at the Gander Mountain Store. He was stocking up on Snoopy Rods and Popeils Pocket Fisherman. He was having the seat raised in his boat so he could see over the side and having a Coke machine installed next to his Marlboro lighter. Barney also was looking at a new landing net that didnt have one of those pretty covers on it so he could actually use it to land his guests fish.
551715,Guest,2005-08-23 14:39:00,0,"I saw Barney on the way to Canada a while back, he was lying dead next to that moose that was nailed by a big-rig. End of Barney. Thank God."
551717,Guest,2005-08-23 15:00:00,0,You are a cruel Dud.
551726,Guest,2005-08-23 20:21:00,0,Caught a glimpse of Barney seining minnows at the local water treatment plant. He was only in two foot of water but it was up to his chin. Hope he checked his pockets for floaters when he got out.
551747,Guest,2005-08-24 20:28:00,0,Saw Barney watching Jimmy hum a couple bars of the Star Spangled Banner.
551754,Guest,2005-08-25 07:49:00,0,"Barney granted me an interview for the Stockton Sentinel News. In the interview he made it very clear that this year he is going to give up on those 12"" Sauger and focus on Bullheads and Carp. He went on to say that he has caught so many Bullhead and Carp growing up in Illinois that he has it down to a science. Barney is renaming his boat to either ""Bullhead Buddy"" or ""Carparama"".....look for it and see if you can get a Coke and a Marlboro from him."
551755,Guest,2005-08-25 07:50:00,0,"So THAT is why Barney smells, he's from Illinois!"
551758,Guest,2005-08-25 08:05:00,0,"Dud, Check your boots for the smell....Bad Dud."
551887,Guest,2005-09-02 08:26:00,0,Saw the little rascal we all know as Barney just last night. Barney was working his shoe shine stand amongest the working girls . Barney does very good shining shoes because he doesent have to bend over very far and he has had plenty of practice polishing door KNOBS.
