552254,Guest,2005-09-26 14:50:00,0,"Dear Sasquatch, My dear Big Footed friend you are sadly mistaken about Mike's walleye fishing ability. He is without a doubt the finest Walleye Fisherman to ever grace the clear blue waters of Canada. He showed everybody in our group how to catch Walleye and continues to share his wealth of knowledge with anyone who pursues the elusive Walleye in the nooks and crannys of Canadian waters. His prowness with a fishing rod and a jig is more than legend and his ability and eagerness to teach Walleye catching tactics to those who struggle in mediocrocy is a great gift to fishing mankind. I have seen him take full grown men who thought they were good fisherman and make them great fisherman. I personally watched him take a tire salesman who thought a big Walleye was 2 pounds and show him in one day what it felt like to have a 10 pound Walleye ripping line off of his reel while listening to his drag squeal the Walleye Song. So my large hairy foul smelling friend tread lightly when you question the talent of Mike. For his greatness only comes into the lesser fishermans life once and your time in his presence should be cherished just like the bounty that Canada lays at your oversized feet."

552242,Mike Kansas,2005-09-26 09:44:00,1463,Cant reach Lac Seul by boat from LCC but you can take your boat up to the Lake and put in. The lake has access within 10 minutes of the camp. The fishing is as good below the dam as it is on Lac Seul. In fact the average fish size runs a little better in the river than on the lake and the number of fish caught is equal to the lake. Great spot to take the family.

552251,Guest,2005-09-26 13:41:00,0,"Its only important that I catch fish.....my mental problems are a whole other issue. Most of them stem from having to fish with a bunch of Carp fisherman who wished they possessd my deft touch with a Walleye Rod in their hand. Fortunatly I let them hold my Walleyes so they can have their picture taken with some Walleye. It is a large shock to their familys when the pictures get developed and they see their Dad/Husband/Brother holding Walleye instead of Carp, Drum, Bullheads or Eelpout."

552237,Mike Kansas,2005-09-26 09:15:00,1463,Eight of us just got home from a week of fishing at Little Canada Camp below the dam at Ear Falls Ont. We had a great week fishing and I wanted to thank kevin the camp owner for making our stay such a pleasent one. Little Canada Camp is a great location to catch fish all season long and it is priced very reasonable. If you are looking for a place to relax and catch Walleye check it out.www.littlecanadacamp.com

552239,Mike Kansas,2005-09-26 09:33:00,1463,It is the first Resort below the Dam at Ear falls on the English River. The dam is the one built when they formed Lac Seul. It is only five minutes from Ear Falls. I believe they have camping onsite. Check out the website and give the camp owner Kevin a call. He is a great guy and works hard to make your stay at Little Canada a comfortable one. Plenty of good fishing and fish are easy to find.
