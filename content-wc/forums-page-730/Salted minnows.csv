552190,mwal,2005-09-20 15:09:00,151,Vados Bait in Spring Lake Park had sign up saying the had salted minnows. That was back in June. Give them a call. We buy minnnows from them then salt them ourselves using 1/2 pickling salt 1/2 borax. We put inch or so of mixture in 5 gal pail put a dozen or so minnows then inch or 2 of mixture. Let sit for several days until minnows are dehydrated. The trick is not to do very many at a time. If you do to many the salt borax mixture becomes wet and you have very messy bait. We have good luck with these minnows as we have had some problems getting the minnows we wanted in Canada. They were all small. Mwal
552201,Lovetofish,2005-09-21 10:09:00,458,"I put live or dead minnows/chubs on a metal screen and let them shake off their water and dry up some. Then I pat them dry with a towel and place them in big baggie with pickeling salt and shake well. After a few hours (I let them set overnight in the fridge) I break them down into smaller baggies with new salt. It doesn't take much salt at this point. Some people add sugar or Borax with the salt, I just never have. Either way, the key I believe is to get them dry first and then put them in new baggies later. You eliminate most of the mess. Then I just keep them cool. I don't freeze them, and I salt them the day before we go. They will keep a good week. This has worked for me for many trips. Brings back memories of the days when we seined our own from the creek. We caught some dandy shinners and chubs!"
