Enjoyed my time there, we came away with 473 fish caught in 7 days, fished 3 days 23 miles from camp, but did well at steamboat, lunker point (2 pound smallie there), did well on west side of Goose Island when the wind is from the southeast coming across the western point, makes a mudline, fish jigs with minnows underneath of the mudline and you will pick up decent fish, also fish around the 20 mph sign just on the east side of the bridge. anyone needing more info about the lac seul evergreen lodge, let me know, [email protected] is my email. service was awesome, gary was out taking care of bear hunters, bringing one in about every night, had 2 live bears IN camp, got pics of it in tree above cabin and met one around the back side of a cabin one time. awesome places to stay, excellent dock service, Lori takes great care of you and your boat. Definitely recommend, we are plannin a trip for there next year."

However, the lake was to choppy for my wife, So we fished at the dam. Hopefully this is the same person?"
552147,Hump,2005-09-16 08:02:00,578,How did you do by the dam?
552209,TKCENTERLINE,2005-09-21 13:01:00,24,"We did good near the dam at the bridge. As a matter of fact I caught a 22 1/2 inch walleye (release) on a green and yellow buck tail spinner I make called a Baby Teddy. I also caught a 39 1/2 in x 16 lb Northern on a Baby Teddy. We had a good time near the Dam. The Baby Teddy seem to work good. I made and tied one for a sportmens staying at the cabin. The next day and as luck could have it, on the very first cast of the Baby Teddy, he caught a 30"" Northern. He came running up to me in the evening with a huge smile on his face from ear to ear, telling me the story. It was his first big fish ever caught. Well, good luck to you."
552216,jjfurs,2005-09-21 20:43:00,16,"we primarily fished the around steamboat narrows, goose island and 3 days out in mckenzie bay and shanty narrows, ghost narrows was excellent for walleyes."

552269,TKCENTERLINE,2005-09-27 08:12:00,24,"We were fishing above the dam, just beyond the bridge at the first big bend. As a matter of fact, it was just left of the resort located on that bend in the river."
