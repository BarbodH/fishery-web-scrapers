Just like you, the night troll was the producer....we did well once again flat lining Deep Little Rippers over deep water just before and after dark. The walleye seemed to be in small schools, and spread out everywhere. You'd pick one up, swing back, and maybe get another, then they'd disperse. Most of the walleye were nice sized, 3# plus or minus fish. I caught a 34"" Northern one night, at first I thought I had the walleye of a lifetime. We managed to catch enough walleye for two nice fish frys (2 families, 9 people) during our week stay....that's all I ask. Wish I was there now, bet they're feeding more aggresively as the season changes."
