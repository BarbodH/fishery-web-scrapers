Ongoing issues over land use tenure, fisheries and outpost transfers often puts the parties at loggerheads when it comes to enforcement, resource management and business development. Tourist association officials say it's a counterproductive relationship, as outfitters and the province share common interests in tourism and the sustainability of the fishery resource. Outfitters took the opportunity to vent their frustrations at a well attended meeting with representatives from the Ministries of Natural Resources, Tourism and Northern Development and Mines in Ignace, July 13 and 14. They got the message that operators are concerned and to work with them rather than against them on resource based tourism, commented Gerry Cariou, executive director of Sunset Country Travel Association. In the weeks since the meeting took place, there are indications that the province intends to do just that. It was a very productive meeting. A lot of information was exchanged and a letter was sent out to all tourist operators in Ontario indicating a number of things MNR is moving on, said Charlie Lauer, MNR regional director in Thunder Bay. He said the letter advised outfitters that their representative will be included in two working groups the ministry is establishing to address regional fisheries concerns as well as broader provincial policy issues. Operators were also provided with an information package on land tenure which outlines the different options available to them, including land use permits and leasing agreements. On fisheries issues, Lauer indicated how the ministry will approach Requests for Transfers when an operator sells a remote camp. We will involve operators in determining occupancy rates and camp rules regarding catch limits, he said. The crux of the problem regarding camp transfers is the formula MNR applies to operators to determine the sustainable harvest of a remote lake. The Thermal-Optical Habitat (TOHA) model determines the maximum sustainable yield of walleye according to data specific to individual lakes. According to the outfitters, MNR also applies maximum catch limits per day based on full occupancy and the average weight of fish to determine the number of beds allowed at a particular camp. The calculation can result in a reduction of beds when the camp is up for sale, which directly affects the business model the transaction is based on. If an operator wants to sell a camp, MNR is invoking a reduction of beds based on the model and the sustainability of the fishery, Cariou explained. The model doesn't reflect the conditions in the field and also neglects that many outfitters have their own conservation limits to ensure the quality of the fly-in destination is maintained. Northern Ontario Tourist Outfitters Association executive director Doug Reynolds adds that the problem isn't so much with TOHA, which he regards as one of the better scientific models used to predict walleye productivity, but how it's being applied by ministry officials. The scientific validity (of TOHA) is not the issue but the model is being applied in an inappropriate way, Reynolds said. We believe many MNR district officers are characterized by a pervasive anti-tourism bias. I think they reflect a local cultural bias that natural resources, particularly the fishery, belongs to local residents and tourists are regarded as intruders. Apart from addressing the issue of bed capacity at outpost camps, and a more collaborative rather than confrontational approach to sustainable fisheries, Reynolds believes the province must provide outfitters with more secure access to tenure by replacing the current one-year land use permits with long term agreements. Investment is what we need and operators need a sense of security so they can develop their outpost facilities, Reynolds concluded. There's a tremendous atmosphere of distrust between MNR and remote tourism operators, a lot of fence mending has to be done."
