Beer and Your Health ... After water, coffee and milk, beer is Canada's most popular beverage and it is often overlooked as a product that is part of a normal healthy lifestyle. Each year, nearly 10 million Canadians enjoy drinking beer. There is clear evidence of health benefits from the responsible consumption of alcohol and each year new studies add to the evidence. Research shows that the moderate consumption of alcohol provides significant health benefits, primarily through reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, but also with respect to reduction in risks associated with other ailments such as stomach ulcers, gallstones, arthritis, etc. Evidence suggests that people who drink beer regularly and in responsible amounts are substantially healthier. A study supported by the Canadian government said people who consume one or two drinks a day are healthier than non-drinkers. In terms of nutrition, beer is a source of vitamins as well as proteins."
