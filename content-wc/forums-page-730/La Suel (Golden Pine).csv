552132,TKCENTERLINE,2005-09-15 13:17:00,24,"I just got back from Golden Pine Resort on Lac Suel. We had a great time. The fishing was Great. I got a 39 1/2 "" x 16 LB Northern on a spinner bait I make called a Baby Teddy. I caught the fish at the mouth of the incoming river and released it for another day. I also caught a 22 1/2 "" Walleye and my wife caught a 22"" walleye also released. The walleyes were also caught on a green/yellow Baby Teddy (spinner bait). It feels so good to catch fish on lures you make. We caught all kinds of walleyes under the slot that we enjoyed for a great dinner and/or lunch. A bear came into camp! That was interesting, since it ended up not more the 10 feet behind me. My camping neighbor spoke out and warned me by saying ""Hey the bear is right behind you"". To my amazement, I turned around and yes, it was right behind me. It was heading for a garbage can not more then a 10 feet behind me. I could have petted it. It walk so softly that one could not hear it. Anyway, I slowly went around my truck, hoped to find my keys and then let myself in to the truck. Sad to say the next day the ranger had to shoot the bear. They had tried to trap it. But it would out smart the trap. We had a great time with everyone and the owners of the resort were great people to enjoy a vacation with. Thanks to all that gave me good information about the area, the lake and the camp. We are looking forward to going up there again next year. Hopefully, the gas will lower a bit!!!! Thanks again."

Bill, Helen, Krista, Peter are the most accomodating owners I've known. Fishing has always been fantastic and everyone in camp seems like family. Can't wait for next spring !!! Spudsdogger"
552168,jjfurs,2005-09-18 23:07:00,16,"hey ted, we stayed at lac seul evergreen, and also had 2 bears in camp on wednesday night and friday morning, i got some cool shots of them. talk to ya all later."
552179,TKCENTERLINE,2005-09-20 07:55:00,24,"While at Golden Pine, We heard the ranger say that evergreen was having problems with bears also. As a matter of fact, the ranger said that he might have to go put a trap up and see if the bears could be caught. If he couldn't trap them, he would have to shoot them. Sad, to hear that the bears have to be shot!! I guess a part of the problem is that the spring bear hunt was not allowed to happen. Therefore, the bears are too abuntent and need more food. Nateral food is scarse, which brings the bears into camp looking for food. Anyway, that is what we where told by the ranger. We have a great time at Golden Pines, I sure am going to return in spring and in fall of next year. The only complaint I had was the kill fish law on the lake. I just dont like the thought of having a dead fish staying on ice in the boat before I eat it. I release most of our fish anyway. If we take fish to eat, I put a range between 14"" and 18"" to save to eat. My wife and I can eat 4 to 6 fish at dinner. If we only got one or two fish during that day, then we would release them at the end of the day and wait untill we got enough for a fish fry. If the fish would die,of course, we would keep it and clean it. But most didnt die and we would release them. I understand the law. But I feel it makes you kills fish you might not want to kill towards the end of the fish day. Plus, I like to see the fish I caught slopping around on the cleaning table before I clean my fish."
552180,Hump,2005-09-20 08:03:00,578,"This was the first year for me. I like the law and think it makes total sense. Fish are stressed when put on a stringer and more than like die if you release them at the end of the day. I thought they were much easier to fillet. I was told that they taste better, but I'm not sure there is a difference."
552181,Guest,2005-09-20 08:43:00,0,"Would you guys recommend Golden Pines for camping? Also, can one dock their boat there, and get to good fishing within a 20-30 minute boatride? Thanks ya'll!"
552192,Guest,2005-09-20 19:19:00,0,"We were at the Golden Eagle last week. Seemed to do a tad better on the slot and above slot than the original poster. Had a good boat with cover and could get a ways out. Monday night a Bear was trapped, and a big cub charged the MNR guy Tuesday morning while retriving the trap - it was shot. Next day a mom and two little cubs ventured in. The mom was trapped and screamed all night, the cubs were trapped as well and hauled off together on Thursday. Great northern light display on Sunday and Monday night."
552195,jjfurs,2005-09-20 21:00:00,16,"hey spank, as far as camping goes, don't know how well gold pines is set up for camping, but we had a camping cabin which is a little more than a tent with bunk beds, desk, table w/chairs, cooking items, small refridgerator and utensils for $249 for a week at lac seul evergreen lodge which is before you get to gold pines. great boats too."
552206,TKCENTERLINE,2005-09-21 12:39:00,24,"We have a camper and used it at Gold Pine. The site are good size and some of the sites have all the hook up (electric, sanitary and water). The sites are in the back behnd the cabin. Some tent site are near the water. We had no problem with the camp sites. They do have a shower house and toilet. The shower house wasn't the most modern but it had plenty of hot water and water pressure and it was clean. Like I said it was a good place and the people where great!. Another place that we went to see is the near by Park (Packwash)on Packwash Lake. It too was a good place. Primitive camping but very nice. Some sites had electric and water. No Sanitary and no docks. But each site had a fire ring and a grill. You would have to trailer your boat and go to a dump station. But it was very nice. It had a beach area and a park. It also had many nature trails and a fish cleaning station. All of this for only $7.50 a night!!!Well worth it, if you don't mind trailering your boat each day. I understand the kill fish law and honor it. But, since my wife and I dont abuse the fishing anyway and really never have abused fishing with or with out a law. I just prefer my fish jumping on the cleaning table or wish to release them should I wish not to kept them. I never use a stringer, other then to bring them to the fish cleaning station. I have two huge live wells in my boat with fresh water airators. They seem to work very well in kepting the fish alive. Like I said, we never take more then 4 to 6 fish to eat every couple of days or so. We have always release the big ones. Otherwize, we release all the fish and eat chops and burgers on the grill for a change."
