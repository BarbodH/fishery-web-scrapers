Any info would be aprreciated greatly. Thanks.
552144,Guest,2005-09-15 22:11:00,0,I HAVE NOT BEEN THERE FOR AWHILE BUT KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT WAS BOUGHT BY OLGAS DAUGHTER SHE WANTS TO DISCONTINUE THE CAMP AND BUILD A HOUSE THERE THEY SAID SHE IS UNFRIENDLY AND UNSTABLE FISHING IS STILL GOOD BUT NOT WORTH IT AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT I HEARD.
552146,Guest,2005-09-16 07:36:00,0,thanks for the input. very interesting. I wonder if it would be worthwhile to go there for our vacation. I heard the fishing was very good there since it was the only camp on the lake and I guess there is alot of water to fish. Too bad the daughter is a pain in the a$$. I have heard for awhile that they were trying to sell the camp.
552149,Guest,2005-09-16 09:29:00,0,must not be a very popular place. usually ya put a camp on here and you get 100 replies. that should tell you something about the place.

If you want info, you could contact them. I'm sure they could shed some light on it. I think is is www.Merkelscamp.com. If not, do a search."
