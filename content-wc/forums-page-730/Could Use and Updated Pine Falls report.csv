Then on to Pine falls to fish with my Father and Brother for the weekend. Hope to be on the water by noon. Expectations are good but hope to hear some more encouraging reports. Anyone that has been fishing either Selkirk on the ""Red"" or Pine Falls either in the river or on the bay, please update me on the fishing. How about water flow, temperature and levels? Thanks in advance and ready to hammer them....Also, will be up again two weeks after that so should hit it at some point."

There's been a few reports on some nice ones being picked up at the mouth of the river, and most recent as yesterday, some 19"" were being picked up in Traverse while crankin. I personally was there last Friday/Saturday. Did much better on Friday before the weather moved it. I was using Roach/Lindy rigs tipped with semi large minnows(4"" or so), Jigs(gold, silver, bubblegum) tipped with live or salties and that was ok. Fished mainly the river as there didnt seem to be a lot of action on the bay. Lots of Drum out there. I have seen some guys anchored just before the first island on the right as you go into the bay, they were doing ok, again not a lot of size to them. Its still a little warm. Water temperature has been hovering around 60 these days buts its bound to go down. Night time lows are averaging in the low 40's and daytime highs are high 50's to low 60's, so it shouldnt be too long before the action picks up. Water is high!. I would estimate that the water is at least 2 feet higher than some years I've seen. Robinson's Rock is almost completely under water. With the water being so high, the current break are as easy to spot, at least for me so you have to go with your knowledge of the river. Something I am still learning. Am most likely going back this weekend, you could say I am persistent! I will post when I get back, hopefully things are better. Hope this helps. Roger"

552203,Guest,2005-09-21 11:09:00,0,"When do they spill water.. Manitoba Hydro determines how much water will move through the dam by what the river capacity is above the dam. Anything above 34,000 or equal to 34,000 cfs is the capacity to the river system. If the water is above 34,000 cfs water is let go to reach that level. At the present time water is just below 34,000 cfs so no water is being spilled. They like to make power with six units (generators) running. When six units are running there is a fair amount of current. Not as much as when they spill water but, a fairly decent flow. After speaking with Hydro today they say that they have enough water in the system to run six units for the month of October. ""Make as much power as possible to keep up with demands"" At the present time there is an exception to this 1 unit is under repair till friday or so, so they have opened one gate to compensate for the water not going through the unit. As of yesterday fishing has been fair, lots of fish being caught with limited amounts of large fish. I am hearing of 28 -31 in fish being caught, but not in the numbers that we would all like to see....Lots of bait in the river, both cranks and jigs are working. Most of the bigger fish being caught are comming from the bay. Hope this helps.."
552208,Guest,2005-09-21 12:50:00,0,"Just wondering. How far out beyond Robinson's rock into the bay do people go to fish? I haven't been up there for a couple of years and can't make it this year as we have plans for Devils Lake. When we were there a couple of years back we never went to far beyond that as it didn't seem like there were many boats out that far. Thanks, cnem"
552211,Guest,2005-09-21 16:25:00,0,"CNEM, Most people don't go to far past Robinson Rock. If they do they are just fishing the flat on the opposite side of the main river channel. The water isn't high due to the dam, it is because of the high water in Lake Winnipeg, the Winnipeg River system above from the dam is at normal level. Hope this helps. Oh, yeah, fishing has been pretty consistant so far, but nothing with any size to them. Lots of 1 - 5 lb'ers. Good Luck, and See You Out There!!!!! "" I Only Work Because I Fish """
