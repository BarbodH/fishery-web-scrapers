552270,Burr,2005-09-27 08:31:00,8612,"Shimano makes some very nice baitcasters, probably not in your stated price range and most do not have the flipping switch - I think there is 1 low profile that does have Shimano's version of the flipping switch. You may have to increase your budget to @ $200.00 in the Shimano line to have several choices of very nice quality baitcasters. I have a Quick reel mfg by D-A-M, I believe it is made in Germany. It also does not have a flipping switch, but it is sooooo smooooth I use it for all my baitcaster presentations, except bouncing. The Quick Reel runs @ $100.00. I'd suggest a medium to medium light rod. The baitcasting rods tend to be stiffer than the spinning rated in the same category. I prefer the medium light for casting and rigging, medium for bouncing. If your not buying until springtime - check back after the new year. There is a new line of signature rods coming out. The beta versions I really liked - alot. Not yet sure of the distribution channels that will be utilized."

552275,Ohio fisherman,2005-09-27 11:05:00,989,Another vote for the Cabelas Prodigy XML combo. Very nice and a good value if purchased as a combo. I use mine the same way as the above person says. On handed operation with a tiller. Good for many methods of fishing too.

552283,sidewinder,2005-09-27 16:21:00,96,"I am not sure what you mean by a flipping switch.I bought a couple of daiwa accudepth reels for my rods .We were trying to fish for lake trout in 70' of water and we also trolled bottom bouncers with accudepyh. New experience for me all the way around. caught a few trout and caught some nice walleye. Want to explore these methods more. I have a Cabelas megaroyal plus baitcaster for pike. I like it. It casts very good,(no major backlashes for a beginner). Sounds like the consensus is that my med heavy 7' rods are overkill. I was trying to balance rod with deepwater trout and walleye.What are the negatives with my rod for walleye? sidewinder"

552289,Guest,2005-09-28 05:29:00,0,"Flippin switch allows you to release line without completely releasing the spool (as in casting). The Prodigy works by pressing the flippin switch to release line and let off to stop...pretty simple really. When trolling the shield lakes, I've found it imperative to change depth quickly in order to get my lure in the holes. The Prodigy reel helps do that with one hand.http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/te...331&id=0017588"

I have a couple of basspro extreme md heavy rods. Budget would be 50-125 dollars. Thanks in advance. I have really enjoyed feedback on best and worst products and best beers,so fire away. I have until middle of May to decide. ""rather be catching in Canada than fishing in Tennessee"" sidewinder"

552260,MN_Moose,2005-09-26 18:50:00,965,"A good source of information would be ""bottom bouncing from A-Z"" by Phil Rolfe in Just Fish Ontario. As far as baitcaster for walleye fishing I asume you are looking for info on live bait rigging and spinners. I like a seven foot medium action. I do use 6 1/2 feet medium also. I think a medium heavy would be too stiff, but brands do vary. For a reel a bass style baitcaster with flipping switch is the ticket. Many guys have been searching for left handed with flipping switch. Cabela's has a couple. You can use right handed just as well except the handle is right where you want to hold the r/r."

Very nice rig and the flipping switch allowed me to stay on the bottom while fighting the tiller and boat. The rod was a bit short on the handle, as it was made for casting. I will probably switch rods with my crankbait reel next year in order to have that longer butt."
