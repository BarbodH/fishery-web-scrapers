551876,Guest,2005-09-01 16:23:00,0,"We are looking at changing camps next year, and was wondering if anyone had any info on Cedar Lake Camp, south of Perrault Falls, ON. Stopped by there to look at the cabins/meet the owners, but I need to know about the fishing on Cedar Lake during late August Thanx"
551891,Guest,2005-09-02 11:39:00,0,We went to Cedar Lake Lodge (the one on the island). I was just finding fish on day 2+ when my wife saw a mouse run across the floor. We left about 3 hrs later. This was in spring.

551908,Guest,2005-09-03 09:12:00,0,"I never stayed at that camp but I stayed at another on Cedar. The smallmouth fishing is incredible almost to the point of being a nuisance. The walleye fishing was pretty good too. Musky was also good. You can also access Perrault lake and some others. You will have plenty of water to keep you busy. We found that year after year, the two best baits for eyes on the system were Crawfish color shad raps and a simple split shot and a hook with leech."
551920,Guest,2005-09-04 23:51:00,0,I have been to this place about 15 years ago when the Burkes ran it. If things have not changed it was the worst place I have ever been to. The cabins were run down. The toilet flushed right under the cabin. The water intake wes ner were the fish cleaning station was making the water smell of rotting fish. Let me add that after this I have been to Canada every year since but never to a drive to facility. Always fly out to a remote area even using an out house was better than what cedar lake camp had.
551924,Guest,2005-09-05 21:47:00,0,"We went to Cedar Lake Camp in 2003 and 2004. Used a lot of gas to find walleye. They say it is a top muskie lake, we didn't find any of those either. We had a certain campsite reserved for 2004 but got bumped when we got there because some friends of the owners showed up and wanted that site. Our son had a bear hunt scheduled which included a cabin and boat but he ended up bunking with another couple that went up with us that had reserved a cabin. Needless to say we felt like we got ripped off along with the fishing isn't that good."
551959,walleye guy 88,2005-09-07 16:24:00,28,"i fished on cedar lake just this past july. i was there from july 23-30. Yes, the walleye fishing was tough, but when we got on them they were in 10-20 feet of water. The best we did was on either monday or tuesday and we caught almost 50 walleyes in a matter of 2 hours. when i say we i mean me and my uncle. We also had some pike, bass, perch, and i got a musky. we caught fish everyday and the camp we staye at was Cedar Point Resort owned by ray and kathi. very nice people and they know whats going on and where the fish are. i really enjoyed my stay there."
551960,itry,2005-09-07 19:50:00,78,"I stayed there the first week of August in 2003. The weather was hot and bright and the fishing was really slow. As far as the owners and the camp, lets just say I have since gone elsewhere and will never go back there."
551961,Guest,2005-09-07 19:53:00,0,"If you are talking about Jerry and Ellie's place, we stayed there late last June 2004, and it was the cleanest camp we have ever been to. Very friendly and accomodating people.(almost to a fault) The fishing was a little slow, but we were dealing with some very sporadic weather that week."
551983,Guest,2005-09-08 14:32:00,0,"I STAYED AT THE ISLAND TWICE..... MIXED RESULTS. DEFINITELY NOT A PIKE LAKE BUT DECENT WALLEYE FISHING. MY BUDDY LANDED A 45"" MUSKIE, THERE ARE A LOT OF LAKES WITHIN BOATING DISTANCE.... IF YOU BRING YOUNG KIDS - THERE IS A GOOD ""ACTION LAKE"" (ST. CLAIR I BELIEVE)... MY 10 YR. OLD AND I CAUGHT AS MANY SMALL- MEDIUM SIZED PIKE AS WE WANTED. CAUGHT A FEW WALLEYE THERE AS WELL. THE BIGGEST PIKE WE CAUGHT WAS 37"".... THE TRIP THERE IS LONG THOUGH. IT IS EASY IF THE WATER IS UP . WE SAW MOOSE, BEAR, AND A LYNX ON THE TRIP TO ST. CLAIR LAKE."
