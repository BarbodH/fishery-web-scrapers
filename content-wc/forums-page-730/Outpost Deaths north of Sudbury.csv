An outfitter found the men's bodies Saturday at a remote cabin in Gogama, north of Sudbury. Provincial police Const. Marc Depatie said it's believed the men died sometime between Wednesday evening and Saturday. Police found a digital camera with pictures dated from Wednesday. Authorities don't suspect foul play and have removed a propane fridge from the cabin for a technical investigation. The dead are Michael Common, 66, of Salem, Ohio, his brother Richard Common, 61, of Alliance, Ohio, and Richard Common's son James Common, 24, of Tampa, Fla. Depatie said the men had visited the area for a number of years. © Copyright by Chronicle Journal.com"
