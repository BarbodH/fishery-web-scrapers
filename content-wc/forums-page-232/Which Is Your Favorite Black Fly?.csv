4878681,BornToFish,2016-05-29 07:50:00,1224,"I just returned from a fishing trip in NW Ontario. The black flies were out in full force. I recalled a thread a few weeks ago about how to repel black flies. I then recalled another thread a few years ago where a fellow posted that the only sure-fire remedy that he knew of for black flies was September. I got to wondering last week about which type of black fly annoyed me the most. I came up with the following choices:The cloud of one hundred black flies that swarms about my head from early morning through the evening.The black fly that walks across the inside of my glass lenses.The black fly that lands in my eye.The black fly that goes into my ear canal and then gets really mad.The black fly that goes up my nose and thinks it can come out the other nostril.The black fly that bites my scalp on top of a previous bite.The black fly that goes way inside my mouth and makes me gag.All of the above. So, which is your favorite type of black fly?"

4878985,fishron,2016-05-29 11:01:00,317,I like the one's that I swat and their all bloody. Makes me think he got what he deserved! Then I realize that it's my blood I'm looking at.

4882145,Bill Krejca,2016-05-30 16:02:00,6107,Isn't it funny the crap we put up with just to be up there? Just imagine having a job and having to daily contend with the bugs we may encounter while pursuing our favorite sport. Call it fun and the endurance hand is allowed to go much much higher. I do recall a bush surveyor friend from years back relating the literally cases of 6-12 which they used to go through. Bill

4882297,Catch 22,2016-05-30 17:10:00,417,Which Black Fly????? Answer: None of the above..............
