4868169,Obabikon,2016-05-24 17:29:00,2370,"I want to add... I crossed in I-Falls today. First time in several years. It went great. I had two very polite and professional officers. It took some time, but I know that it is going to when I buy things at Menards for the camp. The line was very short, and the crossing was as good as one can expect! So... thumbs up for both crossings!"
4871577,jdan9,2016-05-25 18:17:00,5,Leaving in a week for LOTW's. We were going to bring a reasonable amount of booze and a box of cigars. If we do wil that create a problem for us?
4871593,pjshorthorn,2016-05-25 18:33:00,5654,"My understanding from a number of previous posts is that the drive time to/from Dryden is about 30-45 minutes longer crossing at Baudette vs. I-Falls. We drove to I-Falls last year, saw the ridiculous line and made a decision to drive over to Baudette to cross. Nice crossing, nice border agents. The extra 90 minutes driving over to Baudette was probably quicker than waiting in line at I-Falls on that particular day. Sorry that I can't answer your question about drive time all the way back to 90/94 via 53. It has been quite a few years since I've driven that route. PjShorthorn."
4871625,Obabikon,2016-05-25 18:38:00,2370,"You get ONE - 1Litre bottle of liquor per adult. (19 and older in Canada) You get one carton of nicotine based products. (chew, cigs, cigars) If you're under that, there will be no duty to pay. If you're over that... the odds are, the officer asks you to step inside and pay tax."
4865777,Fishoil,2016-05-24 05:25:00,1277,"Now that the season has opened how was your border crossing and which crossing did you use? Is there anything in particular that they were looking for at the border - eggs, bait (including preserved), potatoes, etc.? Those of us who haven't crossed yet appreciate any information that will make our crossing experience easier and faster."
4865817,Obabikon,2016-05-24 05:39:00,2370,"I've crossed several times... nothing out of the ordinary. They haven't even asked about eggs. Easy crossings! But... I'm crossing in Baudette, and not I-Falls (which in my mind is an evil place lol)"
4865961,pjshorthorn,2016-05-24 06:27:00,5654,We crossed at Baudette last year after having driven to the evil I-Falls crossing. The line had to be 2-3 hours long at the end of July on a Saturday afternoon. Drove to Baudette and had two cars in front of us We will be using Baudette for both trips this year. I don't want to go back to the evil place again........unless there is a draft beer special going on at the Border Bar. PjShorthorn.
4866465,U D,2016-05-24 08:27:00,249,"They will ask for your ID, and Citizenship. They will ask if you have alcohol, tobacco, or firearms. They may ask where you are going and for how long. If everything is legit you will be on your way. If things are out of sort, you could be in for a car search and more. Have your poop in a group. Treat them with the respect that an authority figure such as themselves deserve and you will be good to go."
4866569,LOW1,2016-05-24 09:00:00,2828,"As UD says, it's more common sense than anything else. Have your passports ready and put a rubber band around the photo page so that it is easily found. Have them all opened and in a stack to hand to the officer. If you have minors with you, the parents who are not there need to sign and give you a permission letter. Don't bring your gun. I wouldn't bring bait, alcohol or tobacco, as these are just more questions and hoops to jump through. Don't look like a dirtball. Above all, don't be a jerk. Baudette waiting lines are non-existent. IFalls lines are usually reasonable but can be longer on Saturdays. The worst waits I have ever seen are returning back through IFalls on Saturdays."
4866649,Fishoil,2016-05-24 09:17:00,1277,"I've crossed the border over a hundred times with very few problems ever. Got torn down a couple times but even those were decent experiences because I(we) always treat the border guards with the respect they deserve. After all, they have a job to do and suffer enough verbal abuse from the people who just don't get it.What I'm looking for is experiences from this fishing season. It seems they like to fixate on just a couple of items and I try to make sure I don't have those items when crossing to avoid any potential delays. There's nothing our group takes across the border that we can't purchase on the other side so we typically leave the chosen items home and purchase them after crossing."

4866753,Fishoil,2016-05-24 09:29:00,1277,"Thank you, I already have. That's one of the reasons I'm asking what I'm asking. That was a letter Gord received but doesn't tell us anything about actual recent crossings."
4866937,Fisher-man,2016-05-24 10:15:00,422,"Ditto that. The folks at Baudette seem to be very polite and friendly. We have had a couple issues there, but it was all handled in a purely professional manner."
4867257,poultryman,2016-05-24 12:34:00,183,"At Baudette they will ask you why you didnt cross at I falls. They know Baudette is less trafficked. So, while I have no info that they inspect harder at Baudette, if you look suspicious, they may look more closely there. But Ive never seen a line at Baudette."
