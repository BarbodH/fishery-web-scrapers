4866361,rockape,2016-05-24 07:54:00,215,"I use 65# Spiderwire Stealth on my lighter rig for smaller pike baits. I use 80# Spiderwire Stealth on my big musky/pike reels. For casting cranks for eyes, I use 20# Spiderwire Stealth. I used to use PowerPro, but switched a few years ago. The stealth casts better and holds up just as good, if not better. For jigging eyes, I'm old school with 8# Trilene Sensation. Everything is getting respooled next week. Can't wait!"
4866617,skirkpat,2016-05-24 09:07:00,12,i'm surprise more people aren't using mono for walleye jigging? Guess I'm old school too. 8lb

4867689,jsmyers,2016-05-24 15:02:00,198,"Any thoughts/reviews on superlines (braid or fused) that either sink, or don't float as much.I've been a nearly 100% convert to superlines since the mid 90s when I first tried it. One irritation that I've had is that they tend to float. I cast a lot for pike, and on a long cast or when trolling, the line sticking to the surface film keeps the lures riding higher than I'd want. 99% of the time, ""surfing"" a dardevle isn't a good presentation.I'm seeing some lines advertised to deal with this, such Sufix 832 Deep Down or TUF HeviCore. I thought I once saw something from Spiderwire as well I also believe that when the original 832 first came out, it was marketed as being denser.http://sufix.fishing/products/832-d-deep-downhttp://www.tuf-line.com/products_TUF-Lines_24.htmlAny reviews or thoughts?"
4868233,SkWalter,2016-05-24 18:08:00,515,"I use 20# 832 with a 12"" knot too kinky leader for nearly all my fishing up here. I do have a couple rigs with 8# mono and a 8# Flouro leader for jigging walleye but rarely use them. If I'm going to target only walleye I usually take the titanium leader off my 832, tie on a flouro and a snap swivel and I'm good to go. I've used these rigs to pull in 20# pike. Heck, even my kids have done that so it doesn't require a lot of finesse or skill. I can't see using something over 30# when I can use 20# and cast better. Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
4868417,levee breaks,2016-05-24 19:14:00,5,I guess I am seriously under powered!! 6lb Cabelas Pro Line for the walleye rods and 10 lb Pro Line for the bigger Pike/Laker rods. I do make leaders out of 65 pound power pro but the Pro Line is the best line I've used and very reasonable!
4869169,northernbite,2016-05-25 05:27:00,1186,"65# power pro for pike, no leader. 12# 832 for walleye. I think you catch more fish with braid than mono. Paul"

4823010,bthomas3333,2016-05-10 14:54:00,465,"Guys, Ok I recently saw that someone was using 65# PowerPro for Spring time pike. I thought I was on the heavy side when I use 30# 832 for Pike and 832 20 with a Floro-leader for walleyes or 10-12# 100% Floro if in clear water for walleyes. What do you guys use for Pike and Walleye? I'd like to see what others think? B-"
4823402,pikeman14,2016-05-10 16:41:00,144,I use 20 - 30# power pro for my pike and 10# fireline for walleye rods. I don't use any leader flouro line.
4823802,BrianE,2016-05-10 18:28:00,98,"I never use any anything under 50 and usually stay with 80, i prefer Power Pro (Larry Dahlberg got me on to it) don't fish for Walleye but they do hit my pike lures occasionally. As always just my opinion and preference but to each their own."
4824506,ftfarms,2016-05-10 23:01:00,444,I use 60lb power pro for musky 30lb for pike and 6-10lb florocarbon line for walleye and 10lb 832 sometimes for walleye used to be all the time but went back to all floro.

4864273,octanehi5,2016-05-23 14:09:00,1104,"I have caught 25 lb pike on 10 lb 832, the length on the Titanium leader is what matters most 12 to 18"" Titanium leaders,never had one break or bend, That long because when they roll on you the gill plates still do not cut Line. For walleye 6 to 10 lb 832 tyed right to the jig.I have seen guys with 50lb braid with short steel leaders cut off like it was 2 lb test On 50"" pike. Be it 50 -65-80lb braid they can bite it off cut you off very easily with short leaders.Have learned this the hard way by losing big fish"
