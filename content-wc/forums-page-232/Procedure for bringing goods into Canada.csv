4865865,Shellback,2016-05-24 05:57:00,8083,"I'd like to purchase a Weber grill and bring it to Canada as a gift. I know they always ask if you are leaving anything in Canada. Is there a certain value that trips the meter to pay tax, and if so, do you just go inside and pay the tax, or is it more involved? I had intended to just buy the grill in Canada, but they are $400 in the US, and $600 CA in Canada. Better for me to pay the tax if required."
4865937,pjshorthorn,2016-05-24 06:20:00,5654,"I believe that is correct,but it has been a long time since I had to declare anything of significant value. PjShorthorn."
4866009,pwbmlr,2016-05-24 06:37:00,37,$600 Canadian based off today's exchange rate would make the cost for you around $420 USD. If you don't want to worry about the hassle at the border and traveling with it a long distance (taking up space) you may want to just buy it up there? Just a thought.
4866049,Shellback,2016-05-24 06:46:00,8083,"If that's a good figure, you are right. I would pay $400, plus 6% tax here to make my cost $424. So it would be a wash paying the ON tax on either place I buy."
4866153,Bstar,2016-05-24 07:14:00,564,According to the Bank of Canada $600 CA = $456.76 US
4866497,LOW1,2016-05-24 08:35:00,2828,"Don't forget to factor in the Canadian sales tax (Ontario is about 14%) and your state's sales tax when making the comparison as well as the time involved, inconvenience in buying the grill there, etc.Bring the receipt for the grill with you. The procedure is that the border officer asks what you will be leaving in Canada, you tell him about the grill, he writes this down on a small yellow sheet of paper, you pull your vehicle up into the inspection area and then take the yellow slip, the receipt, your wallet and passport into the building. The folks behind the counter will calculate the fee, collect the money, and give you a receipt.They may get cranky if you don't bring the receipt for the grill with you. Pay the duty by credit card. The exchange rate the Canadians give you for US cash is very pro-Canadian.I don't think there is a threshold and I think the duty is about 5% beginning on the first dollar."
4866529,Jesse-WI,2016-05-24 08:50:00,534,"When you declare you will pay the GST, PST and HST (14% or so). If the product is not made in Canada, US or Mexico I believe the duty is an additional 8%."
4867873,Shellback,2016-05-24 15:48:00,8083,I'm just going with buying it in Canada.

4875081,BornToFish,2016-05-27 07:25:00,1224,"I travel to Canada several times each year. My Canadian friends ask me from time to time to bring up personal items that they enjoy, but cannot find locally. An example would be a particular bottle of wine. One time, I declared the bottle of wine as being a gift. I was shocked at how high the import duty was on that occasion, compared to comparable instances when I said the bottle of wine was not a gift. Thus, I now declare all items as being for personal use."
