Or maybe we want to send a picture home to rub it in to that one guy who couldn't go? Man, we ARE dumb. We might be dumb but at least we aren't a s s h o l e s."

4845849,bus33,2016-05-17 09:50:00,289,This is what I use. We stay close to Ear Falls and it works. You can have it activated on a certain day or I think once you make your first call or text in Canada it kicks in. $2 per day and you use your existing minutes/data plan.
4847961,bpetersen,2016-05-17 21:52:00,251,That's what I needed to know. Thanks Bus
4848625,eyedrvm,2016-05-18 07:43:00,48,"I called verizon yesterday. They had to sign me up for the two dollar plan. The specifics are that no charge until you use it. Each phone on the plan that may be used needs to be added. The 24 hour period starts at the time of first call or txt... and runs 24 hours no til midnite that day. Each phone will be charged two dollars if they are used, even if one of the phones on the plan is in its 24 hour period the other phones cant be used under that 24 hour pass. Hope some of that made sense. It did to me as I typed it!!! So best value might be to call or txt in the afternoon. Then you could txt or call the next am also if thats your goal!? Then again two dollars a day is pretty small peanuts on a big trip."
4852249,SinOrSwim,2016-05-19 09:11:00,1528,curious with the $2.00 plan if it will connect to some of the analog towers more easily up there since they must have a deal in place to eliminate the roaming charges?
4852337,NARDA 1,2016-05-19 09:26:00,636,"T-Mobile has a North American Plan that includes all calls to or from Canada, no extra charges."
4852449,Lotw1,2016-05-19 09:50:00,36,"I believe most of Canada uses GSM towers now. In the US it is mostly CDMA, so if your phone is not international/GSM compatible it may not work in Canada even with the $2.00 Verizon plan. However I have no idea what the towers are in the lac seul area"
4855353,SinOrSwim,2016-05-20 08:23:00,1528,Be awesome if someone who has a really good understanding of how all this stuff works would put together a bit of a tutorial. Like settings on your phone that we can swtich to make it connect etc. With some of the more popular phones maybe?
4857009,bpetersen,2016-05-20 21:35:00,251,"If you have verizon, they have a good tutorial explaining Travelpass and they will let you know if your phone will work in the area you are traveling. I also found a coverage map on the tutorial that shows the areas in Canada that are covered and whether it is 2g, 3g, or 4g coverage. It was very easy to set up the phone for the plan, also."

Sometime it works sometimes not so much.Why do you guys come up here? Outside of your $ you are quite dumb. We need to build a wall. Perhaps export the lot of you in mid June.Trunp that."
4861417,pjshorthorn,2016-05-22 17:48:00,5654,"I for myself will be exported in June and August. I'll bring some extra H cream with me, but I thought there was a big distributor in Winnipeg for some reason . Can you confirm whether I can buy H cream cheaper in Winnipeg vs bringing it myself? I'll need a two month supply.Thanks for the information in advance.PjShorthorn. My apologies. I forgot to ask if Trump actually trumps Trunp ??"
4844217,bpetersen,2016-05-16 21:36:00,251,"A search only brought up old information. How is the cell phone reception on the northwest arm by Ear Falls? I am on the Verizon plan. Thanks in advance, Pete"
4844233,walleye/musky,2016-05-16 21:39:00,47,We have tbay tel/ Rogers and I would say I can get reception all the way to shanty narrows from ear falls
4844409,ftfarms,2016-05-16 23:22:00,444,I had to call Verizon and put the Canadian plan on my phone after that I had reception on lac suel up around earfalls. It pulls off of the Rogers towers. At least that's what it said on the bill.
4844745,Pooch,2016-05-17 06:00:00,4619,Now you guys are gonna make me take my phone in the boat and try to hit a tower when out on the open water. I'll be at LSL and I know there is no reception there or until you get closer to Ear Falls on the highway.Open water area in Bay of Islands? Might try it just for kicks. Be nice to check in back home once during our stay.Pooch
4844833,bigwalleye1,2016-05-17 06:14:00,2632,"For YEARS the only communication once I got north of the border was the pay phone in the lodge. As a result, only talked to home once, maybe twice, during the week up there. A number of years ago, a newbie ( the brother in law) hauls out his cell phone, calls home and talks to his daughter...his daughter's mother is my wife's sister.... I was free of the cell phone for years...Nah, nope honer, no reception...no towers....spotty even if it worked...too expensive... In one phone call, he destroyed the one opportunity i had for peace and quiet... Now, phone is on from the time we land in camp to the end of dinner, then it's turned off. That is my only concession to technology. BTW, we stay south of Sioux Lookout and trailer to LS every day, so tower signal is not an issue for us."
4844905,SinOrSwim,2016-05-17 06:28:00,1528,"We were in the bay of islands a couple years ago and my brothers phone range. Talked to his brother in law. Then the following year we had different phones and couldn't get reception very well even at the cabin. Seems like it depended on what phone you had vs the service provider. I guess point being is I'm not sure there is a way to know for sure whether it will work until you get up there. But, it very well might."
4845025,Shotgun,2016-05-17 06:56:00,759,"Times I've used a pay phone one call home cost me more than the Canadian plan with Verizon. I'll set it up for one month then cancel on line when we get back home. However, Verizon's plan does have some limits, just don't recall the criteria off the top of my head. Pooch, I agree the only reception I've had is near Ear Falls. I'll take my laptop and in the evening log into LSL's wifi to keep in contact with home. The wifi is rather limited but works ok for e-mails. Doesn't help much for on the lake but if there's an emergency at home, they'll call the lodge and leave a message."
4845209,prov1800,2016-05-17 07:41:00,5010,If you feel the need to be in touch with the outside world rent a sat phone.i have some guest that do that.some guys just need it for business reasons.but being in broad lake and getting and receiving calls is pretty cool.some of the carmin spot units now hae email and text so thats another system that could come in handy also.
4845449,JDP,2016-05-17 08:23:00,1457,One of the guys in my group has done this. Worked very well for him. Most of us in the group prefer to not even know that the d*** thing is around. Great for emergencies though.
4845761,bpetersen,2016-05-17 09:33:00,251,I was just thinking with Verizon's new plan. It doesn't cost to have it and it is only $2 each 24 hour period you use it in Canada and Mexico.
