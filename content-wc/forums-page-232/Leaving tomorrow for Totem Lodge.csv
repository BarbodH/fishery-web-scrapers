Over the two days my wife and I caught about 60 fish split between Walleye and pike with a couple of smallmouth, one nice maybe 4 pounds and a fluky 24.5 inch Whitefish. Our guide Marc Lalonde was awesome, it was really cool the way he handled out boat in tight quarters while we were fishing in high winds and the way he used the electronics."
4867761,Low4fish,2016-05-24 15:17:00,37,That's great news I was fishing in the Wiley area did not have much luck as I was trying the normal shallower post spawn areas. Thought about going deeper but ran out of daylight. Did not try many spots over 20 ft. I see other reports that 30 ft was productive as well. That wind was difficult on sundaySent from my SM-N910W8 using Tapatalk
