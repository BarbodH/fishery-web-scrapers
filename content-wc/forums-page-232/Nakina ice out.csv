4836738,halfmoon007,2016-05-14 22:24:00,121,"the last full week of july. Cant wait ,this is is year 5 and it doesn't get any better than melchett. Hoping water levels are up so we can do some exploring into the other lakes. Hoping you will give me a e-mail on the status of your trip. Think en our group has to try a early season week there just for comparison. the no bug early august is pretty good. your melchett friend the Campbell group from lower Michigan STATE. Halfmoon"

4843625,halfmoon007,2016-05-16 18:22:00,121,I remember fishing Gogebic 25 years ago in the U.P. Michigan with a picture just like that. after 2 hours the hands were so cold couldn't put a crawler on the hook. Just have to remember a tough day of fishing is so way better than a day of work at the shop. Thus you now have the August fishing trip for us old farts that know better.We fish Melchett lake that is fed by Meta and I must say those are mighty fine walleyes you send down the river to us.
