4864633,trapsht,2016-05-23 15:43:00,28,"I took a quick trip up to Pasha Lake Cabins to fish for early season pike and brook trout. I have wanted to chase ice out pike for some time, and was able to make it happen. Fish proved to be a little deeper than I was expecting, but once I started fishing the drop offs leading into the shallow bays it was great fishing. Jerkbaits definitely out fished spoons and bucktails. It was common for the fish to swallow my X rap up to the leader. Fished nearby L. Nipigon for one day and caught a 21"" brookie and fat pike(pics attached). What a beautiful fish!! The water is so clear on that lake that you can sight fish for the trout and pike. I saw every strike happen. The cabin I stayed in was right on the lake and in great shape(wife approved if you want it to be). Will be back up in the fall to chase walleyes. I've been to Pasha in the past and it's always great fishing and beautiful scenery.View from my cabin"

4868393,herky10,2016-05-24 19:10:00,1,Thanks for the report trapsht! Very nice pictures. My group has plenty of experience fishing in Canada but we will be making our first trip to this area in a few weeks. What other lakes did you fish besides Nipigon? Thanks again.
