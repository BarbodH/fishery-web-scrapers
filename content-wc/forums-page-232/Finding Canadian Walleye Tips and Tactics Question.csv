4870401,Sportdog,2016-05-25 10:41:00,6735,"These tips are sure appreciated. I've been lucky on my first three trips to Canada but am going to a new place this year. I'm so used to fishing weed walleye around here I tend to think in those terms, thus trolling crawlers. I have fished jig and minnow in Canada but it was always a river system. I guess this lake is too but it's huge! Can't wait to get there Saturday!!!"
4870665,Ver88,2016-05-25 11:51:00,114,"i like to start shallow and work my way deeper until I find fish. I also use my electronics to find fish. The technique does not seem to matter as much as location. I would use the technique that you have the most confidence in. For me that is pitching jigs and plastics. I like to fish very fast until I find fish. Dont overlook very shallow, 1 to 3 feet, or weeds."
4871089,pike50plus,2016-05-25 14:00:00,584,Help locate fish and active ones at that.
4872473,Redline,2016-05-26 07:51:00,73,"Wow, I'm surprised they were that deep already. I'll be in Sioux Narrows in 3 weeks. We've had years with them in 12' of water and years with them in 40' of water. Always Fathers Day Week/Weekend."
4872545,bthomas3333,2016-05-26 08:04:00,465,WOW! Going to LOTW next weekend. I would be shocked if they were that deep over in NW corner since it isn't a summer pattern yet. Almost like they were pre-spawn... I can say last weekend we found them in 14-20 and some hadn't spawned yet. Just another piece of data but I am shocked they would be so deep already.
4879529,Fisher-man,2016-05-29 16:56:00,422,"Yeah, that....great advice. Everyone will agree that Lac Seul is a walleye factory. But even there you can have trouble. We just couldn't find them one year at all of our usual hot spots. Kept going from point to point to island to reef to sand bar and finally found them in 25' of water off two rocky islands a half mile from our cabin! Great stuff. You feel like a real walleye fisherman when you work that hard and finally find the fish. And of course we kicked the crap out of them for the next 3 days. Good luck, and have fun."
4883513,octanehi5,2016-05-31 05:57:00,1104,"Knowing the lake is always the best way to find them, if its your first time on a lake i suggest you troll bottom bouncers with worm harnesses,covers more area than just drift jig fishing once you find an active bite area mark the spot with a bouy marker,Then start jig fishing. also pay close attention to structuture and wind direction. Walleyes will be walleyes no matter what lake your on,Try differant colors,depths. If you caught walleyes in an area before odds are you will catch them again yr after yr."
4868369,Sportdog,2016-05-24 19:08:00,6735,Leaving Friday and am looking for suggestions on locating walleye. I thought I would start out trolling drop offs on points ajacent to river mouths with spinner crawler harness but my friend says minnows are the ticket. Troll minnows w/spinners? Typical pitching jig and minnow? Cast or troll cranks? What say you guys??? Thanks
4868433,bigwalleye1,2016-05-24 19:16:00,2632,"Vertical jigging is the secret to Canada. Fish fast, find active biters and let them have it. When they stop, move. Never fish memories or somebody's spot from last year. Don't leave fish to find fish., but if you're not catching, search til you do. Classic walleye, start shallow, work deep. Wind points and inside turns. Have fun, take pictures, and enjoy your vacation!!!"
4868713,Pooch,2016-05-24 20:54:00,4619,"On unfamiliar water I tend to drop a BB and spinner and start looking for fish in what I think are likely places. If I go through what I think are walleye and don't get hit, I'll drop a jig and minnow on them. If that gets no response I go to a jig and paddle tail and go through them again a little faster trying to trigger a reflex strike. If that fails I might go minimal with just a hook, split shot and minnow or leech. If that fails, I move.Some days I move... a lot!Random thoughts:Most guys do not pay enough attention to the wind at the moment and the wind yesterday. My experience makes me believe that a jig and minnow is a numbers game while trolling spinners usually puts fewer but bigger fish in the boat.Off subject, but most of us (me) started walleye fishing with jigs then morphed over to trolling and have come full circle back to jigs. I now jig and troll about evenly with the fish telling me what they want at the moment.Have a great trip and tell us about it when you get home.Pooch"
4868793,Fishoil,2016-05-24 21:59:00,1277,"I never troll in Canada, no need to where I fish I guess. A jig and minnow are as good as it can get - vertical or pitched. You mentioned river mouths so the best piece of advice I can give you is ""current=walleyes""."

4869001,roscoe33,2016-05-24 23:54:00,653,"This time of year, the eyes can be anywhere from 3-4' of water, down to 15-18'. It all depends on how long since they finished spawning, water temps, clarity, and amount of sunshine. In NW Ontario, ice out was 4 weeks ago, so they were probably done spawning 2 weeks ago and starting to move out to deeper water. Like 8-12'. But the majority of their feed is still shallow, (minnows perch leeches) so they will still move very shallow in low light at feeding time. And be driven deeper in bright sunshine, and as water temps increase. We've caught eyes in 4' of water, back trolling with only 6' of line out. We often troll a spinner with minnows, or a rapala, to find the depth that active fish are hanging out in. If the fish are concentrated in a smaller area, we then will cast and jig with minnows, crawlers, or crank baits."
4869033,ftfarms,2016-05-25 03:38:00,444,This time of year don't rule out sand that has small rocks mixed and the transition from sand to hard bottom. Points with small rocks. I like pitching jigs toward shore. We've caught alot of walleyes this time of year in 2 foot of water. It's almost like bass fishing. I like jigs with spinners on them when casting. (Northland tackle whishler jig)
4869081,martinbns,2016-05-25 04:50:00,1520,"We were fishing this past weekend out of totem Lodge in LOTW and the Walleye were really deep, 30-45 feet of water. We caught them all on minnows and jigs. Had lots of fun catching pike in 4-8 foot deep bays."
4869537,worthsr,2016-05-25 07:24:00,52,"We spend a majority of our time trolling spinners (Klass Walleye Catchers with steel line) tipped with minnows or soft plastic tails. I would also target a depth of 4-8 feet, in warm water bays with a wind blown shoreline. Good luck!"
4869561,bthomas3333,2016-05-25 07:32:00,465,Electronics can really help this process along. On unknown lakes I bring in portable electronics. These start at about $100 and go up from there including do it yourself projects to make dash mount finders portable. Then I look for the 'normal' places as referred above and use the electronics to locate depth and usually some fish. Then go spinners / jigs / slip bobbers / shot & hook. I usually am able to literally find fish to target.B-
