4871337,acplumber,2016-05-25 15:58:00,80,MattI had no idea about those fires until I read this thread We are also going to nakina but not for 30daysI asked nakina air on Facebook and they said the fire was all to the south of them in greenstone but they had just reopened the road this afternoon to nakina

4872089,gmattbruin,2016-05-26 04:56:00,174,"kinda glad i started this thread, and hope maybe it helps with those headed up and into any lakes out of Nakina. From yesterdays news, i ""believe"" the road btwn Geraldton and Nakina is back open, not sure abt the hwy11 btwn Longlac and Hearst. My group isnt heading thru geraldton and up to Nakina till Jun17th but maybe info on here can help those going this weekend. I have no doubt the outfitters are crazy busy right now and communication might be difficult. Just another way mother nature reminds us our fishing trips are just a luxury in our lives....some yrs it ice still in, this yr could be issues with fires. by the looks of the summer forecast, dry&hot, we all could be dealing with whats happening right now at anytime."

4883385,gmattbruin,2016-05-31 05:10:00,174,apparently the fire ban has been lifted so im assuming any fires are in check now and the threat is pretty low for more
