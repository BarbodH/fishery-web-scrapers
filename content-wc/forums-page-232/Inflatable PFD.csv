4876201,Huskerbuck,2016-05-27 14:17:00,2,The other thread got me to wondering. I have an inflatable pfd that is about 6 years old. Thank god I've never needed it. My question is how do I know the gas canister is still good? Also how often should one change canisters. I bought it when I went to Canada about 6 years ago and am going up in about 3 weeks again and it's got me wondering. I did buy a vest type to take along this time but was wondering what everyone else's thoughts are in the inflatable ones. Thanks

For further peace of mind go ahead, jump in some water, deploy the PFD and confirm that everything works as intended, THEN install a new cylinder and repack the bladder.On the otherhand if your PFD is an AUTO-INFLATE then one should replace the trigger ""pill"" at least every 3 years."
