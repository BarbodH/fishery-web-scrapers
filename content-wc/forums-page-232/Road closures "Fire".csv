I know 584 was closed for a day or two and is now open, what about 11 between Hearst and Longlac? Also hearing of a fire around Whiteriver area. Our route is crossing at Sault Ste Marie headed up 17 to Whiteriver then 631 north to 11 west to Geardlton then 584 to Nakina. Man been waiting all year I sure hope and pray we can get there."

Just be ready for some occasional ""washboards"" that will settle everything you are bringing with you quite nicely. If coming from the east, it is actually a faster route to Nakina, albeit gravel instead of asphalt."
4879361,adempsey,2016-05-29 14:03:00,963,I traveled down 11 from Longlac all the way to Barrie. Was no road closures. Not sure about 584.I did notice that the area along both sides of the highway heading to Hearst was all burned. It looked like a controlled burn though.
