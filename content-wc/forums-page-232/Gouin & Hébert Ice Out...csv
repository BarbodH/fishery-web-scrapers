4881897,fosterthedog,2016-05-30 14:03:00,51,"Not gonna be there for a couple weeks after you guys, Fishron has it right, do it at camp. That said we have done it twice over the years once on the west end of the island that the camps are on and the other on the beach at the north end left of the shallow bay at the top of the lake. We will be in 7/9 thru 7/16, cabin 23 if we're around stop by . fosterthedog AKA Steve"
4883497,octanehi5,2016-05-31 05:41:00,1104,"We have stopped by the island thats set up for a fish fry, loads of bugs, A good spot is the right hand side on the inlet to the back bay,with a good west or south west wind no bugs. 90% of the time we do it right in camp.Time on the lake is very precious, it takes some time to build a good fire to fry on,the propane in camp is much quicker."
4867377,MikeG1,2016-05-24 13:06:00,434,"I was kind of hoping it would stay frozen until AFTER the week Ron is scheduled to visit, because I'm scheduled the week after that. From what I hear all the fish have sore jaws from Ron's jigging technique and we are hoping to catch a few. Oh Well, I guess he can't catch them ALL!"
4867953,octanehi5,2016-05-24 15:56:00,1104,"Hebert Is ice free today,Mike when you see the amount of fish in this lake your not going to believe your eyes { no pun intended }I have to tell both the week on the 26th -the 3rd and the 3rd - 10th The fishing is going to be off the hook,walleyes are going to have the feed bag on,its been a very long winter for them.hopefully the water temps will be in the 60's,with winds out of the southwest"
4868217,MikeG1,2016-05-24 17:58:00,434,Hope you are right. You sure know how to get a guy excited. Thanks.
4875297,octanehi5,2016-05-27 08:24:00,1104,"The good news the ice is out, the walleyes are spawning, All the camps are ready,I started to pack my arsenal , My group as well as myself are starting to chomp at the bit.Being 30 days out,From what most Fishermen consider a trip of a lifetime, I am truely blessed to be making my 13th yr in a row to fish this lake. Good Luck to all!!"

4875865,fishron,2016-05-27 11:13:00,317,"WoHoo!, new motors, not that we had any trouble with the old ones. Air Tam does provide great equipment and a beautiful camp. Can't wait to approach some of the great new spots I had success on last year with a bit more knowledge. Working on a new walleye recipe Ron. Shore lunch on the way."
4876993,octanehi5,2016-05-28 06:17:00,1104,"Sounds great Ron, I will have a Cajun Beer batter with me,nice zing in it.Looking forward to spending some time fishing with you guys as well as a few Walleyes"
4878009,NY Walleye,2016-05-28 20:08:00,78,"guys, What's the best place on Hebert to have a shore lunch? Easy in and out of course. There are lots of rocks in some of the bays. Looking for a good spot. Thanks See you guys the Weekend of the 26th."
4878441,Bigredmf,2016-05-29 05:29:00,129,The outfitter has a formal shore lunch area but we never used it.As you can see there are a multitude of locations you can use.RedSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
4878513,fishron,2016-05-29 06:12:00,317,"We have never used the formal shore lunch area either, Red. It's in the middle of an island up lake and looks to be a bit buggy. The fire ring in front of our cabin, which is on an island is the place we use. Few if any bugs and if I forgot anything it's in the cabin behind me. Quite a beautiful view also. Maybe it's not authentic, but it gets us back on the water fast."
4854089,NY Walleye,2016-05-19 18:25:00,78,We will stop by and say hi. Fourth trip to the lake. Looking forward to it.
4855129,MikeG1,2016-05-20 07:17:00,434,"I've been excited about this trip for a year now. The recent posting are making it more so. I've been forwarding some of the information to my group and I believe they are getting equally excited. All we have left to do is buy food, pick up bait and put the final things together. I hope we'll be close on weight. Thanks again to everyone for the info."
4855825,Freytown,2016-05-20 12:01:00,770,Southern baies on the gouin are open...a few more days for the rest.
4857329,octanehi5,2016-05-21 05:53:00,1104,"Its not an easy task,making the plane weight,Send in your water order a head of time,The overage charge of .75$ lb is not hard to deal with.Bring the things you need,Do not double up on to much fishing gear.we usually allow 1 case of 24 cans of beer or other beverage.in a persons weight any extra beer is 18lbs a case about an extra 13$ to fly in.Extra cases of beer can be bought on the lake at 60$ Canadain. Ice out is on its way only a few more days.Good luck to you early Fliers"
4860945,Freytown,2016-05-22 14:45:00,770,Today's satellite image show's Gouin ice disappearing. But Hebert remains locked-in.
4860977,Freytown,2016-05-22 14:49:00,770,Pic's I've seen of the Gouin show water near full capacity. Lot's of snow melt this year.
4862041,Kartman35,2016-05-22 22:10:00,245,"Heading to Baie Verreau next weekend (north-east corner). Super excited for the high water and the late ice out....Two years ago I was there at the same time and with the late melt there were virtually no bugs!!! What an awesome thing to be able to sit outside around camp with no deet and no bugs. Couldn't believe it. Of course I'm bringing the mosquito coils and the deet, but would be super cool not to have to use it. We'll see... Bonne Peche !!"
4864361,octanehi5,2016-05-23 14:21:00,1104,Latest Sat photos show the gouin about 50% ice out. Hebert 30% ice out but going fast
4864641,Freytown,2016-05-23 15:47:00,770,5/23/16 satellite image....Hebert ice free. All is good.
4865801,octanehi5,2016-05-24 05:37:00,1104,The image I saw still had ice but melting fast
4849769,a3dad,2016-05-18 12:33:00,115,"Hey Air Tamarac Fans,I was just looking at the MODIS satellite images from today (just two days before the opener) and it appears that the majority of the Gouin and HÃ©bert are still frozen. See the attached image. The red indicates ice. Anyone heading up this weekend? Any word from Elaine or Jean?"
4850233,East coast,2016-05-18 15:02:00,32,We're heading up to the Gouin on the 26th. 1 week of warm temperatures should do it in. Take a peak at the Barrage Gouin Facebook page. He had an aircraft up today with pictures. Lots of ice but the melt is well underway. May be rough Walleye fishing but the pike fishing should be awesome!
4850249,East coast,2016-05-18 15:03:00,32,Anybody hear anything about water levels this year?
4850265,octanehi5,2016-05-18 15:14:00,1104,"I saw the same pics,Hebert and the gouin will not be ready for this weekend.Should go out in a few days,A week from now it will all be good.Walleye will be spawning for the next 3 weeks. I have always targeted the last week in June into july Just for the late ice outs"
4850529,fishron,2016-05-18 16:49:00,317,"Hey Ron, I completely go for the later weeks of June and early July to maximize the good fishing and the comfort of less layering to keep from freezing. I'm only up for my third trip to Hebert but I made a small observation last year. The first year, same time period, the raspberry bushes outside of the cabin were in bloom and the miniature bumble bees, about the size of honey bees were all over them. Last year, second trip, no blossoms, no bees. Small difference, but an indication of a later season. Probably the same this year. Not to worry, the fishing will still be fantastic. Can't help it, It's just in me to take in these little variances, its all part of the great experience."
4850593,MikeG1,2016-05-18 17:29:00,434,Appreciate the info guys. Can't wait to begin my first Hebert trip.
4851417,tshea,2016-05-19 05:03:00,36,hi guys - Mattawa bay is open as of yesterday Water level is high according to the guys at Air Tamarac I am heading up on Saturday - weather forecast looks spectacular - so it will probably snow and hail
4851753,octanehi5,2016-05-19 06:55:00,1104,"Pike Fishing should be good,Walleye will be slow, The weather this time of yr is very volatile,I have seen the wind direction change 5 to 6 times in a day.Rivers and streams feed the Gouin its constantly moveing,Hebert on the other hand is spring fed giving it its very clear water for a Canadian shield lake,Forged and carved by Glacier""s 10's of thousands of yrs. old.The Gouin is man made and under 150 yrs. old.Both are great fisheries.I like the remote experience of camp #26 the north side of Hebert,6miles north of the main camps on the island,There are may days you only see the 4 other boats from camp 26 & 25. 5weeks from now My group lands on the lake,Meeting up with old friend's Fishron, Daniel the caretaker.Mikeg1 We will leave your group a few fish. See you when you get to #26. To everyone else Have a great time In the north country"
4852417,NY Walleye,2016-05-19 09:44:00,78,Weather the next five days looks good up in that area. Ron- we will be there the same week as well. Staying on the north end. Should be good fishing of ice is out and swan is on.
4852969,octanehi5,2016-05-19 12:09:00,1104,"By the last week in June The spawn will be over for about 3 weeks,Walleye will be putting on the feed bag.If your in camp 25 stop by and say Hi"
