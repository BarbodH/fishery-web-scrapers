It is across from the Wal-mart just before you leave town. I don't know of a store in the Sioux Lookout that is as nice."
512456,Guest,2001-05-12 06:00:00,0,"Chris,In Dryden, there is a large Safeway store that has almost everything you probably would need. It's up about a block and a half from the paper plant on the right hand side. If you're headed to Sioux Lookout via highway 17, you'll be going right by it, so it won't be out of your way. Hope this helps and good luck fishing.Remember to keep your eyes open and your feet dry.S.v.m"
