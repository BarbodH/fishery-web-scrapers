512263,JN,2001-05-13 04:39:00,47,We camped just to the west of there about 5 to 10 mi. We caught alot of Lakers but few pike. Then we found this little lake off the main lake Trout Lake camp had a boat in it. We fished that Lake the rest of the trip we were catching 100 + walleyes per hr. they were 3 to 5 lbs. I don't have a map to tell you the exact spot but Trout Lake should now where it is.
512253,Skyraptor,2001-05-06 07:13:00,291,"Going to Reindeer Lake on June 23rd (47 days to go) and am wondering a few things. How is the road between LaRonge and Southend, heard that there are some big potholes as we are taking a motorhome, also what is the average ice out on the lake? We will be fishing mainly for lake trout and northerns and have been told that both should be in the shallows at that time of year. Any clues on what lures to bring? Also what type of weather to expect at that time of year and are the bugs going to be a problem. TIA"
512254,Guest,2001-05-06 08:00:00,0,I've never fished Reindeer but I have driven the road past there on the way to Wollaston. I took a motorhome a few years ago. The road wasn't too bad. Just keep your speed down. I held it between 35 and 40 mph. When you see trucks coming slow down and look for an wide spot in case you need it. The vehicles that were the worst seemed to be passenger vechicles traveling at a high rate of speed right down the middle. I suspect that heavy rain can make the trip interesting. Just remember to keep your speed down and be ready to get over if you need to. The road can be very dusty when dry. A friend recommended running the air conditioner when you leave the pavement. This creates a positive preasure inside.
512255,whitey,2001-05-06 15:51:00,36,"I've been to reindeer twice but never drove. Heard the road isn't great. The ice should be long gone. bugs on the lake won't be a problem, but on shore they will be thick. take spoons, 5 of diamonds, red eyes, daredevils in different colors. Rattle traps worked on trout. On of my favorites is a mepps spinner that has a rubber minnow imbedded on the end. Worked great trolling for trout and casting for pike. Also take rubber baits like sluggo's. caught a 22 lber in the shallows with it. Good luck and take the bug spray."
512257,JN,2001-05-07 03:32:00,47,"Been up the road 2x, it wasn't the best but you'll make it. Went about the same time of year, and the fish were bitting. But if you want to get to the good fishing you'll have to run up the lake a gooooood distence. If your self guided I'd recomend getting a GPS cause that lake is huge."
512256,whitey,2001-05-07 16:29:00,36,"Good point JN. I forgot the BIG part. Plus there's like 5000 islands, so getting lost is real easy.one year, 2 guys in our party had an indian guide and they got lost. needed to send a float paln out to find them. This guide couldn't find his own butt."
512258,4bigfish,2001-05-07 20:00:00,25,"The lake should be pretty good at that time. Big Trout might be down already. Try trolling in a ""S"" pattern. This will let you hooks go deeper. Pike will be great. Try the bays or the mouths of the bays. As far a lures go, pick up some ""Len Thompson Spoons"" #2 and #4 size. I have the best luck with Red and White or Five of Diamonds. Have a great trip!Markwww.4bigfish.com"
512259,Guest,2001-05-08 05:23:00,0,"I used to work at a fly-in lodge on Reindeer but have been down that road many times. It will be a long drive in a motorhome. The fishing should still be pretty good at that time of June. The ice is usually off near the end of May/ beginning of June. The trout should still be shallow but you may want to take downriggers to try get the bigger fish that are deeper. You will have no problem trolling spoons and catching lots of trout from 2-5 pounds. The pike will likely be in the bays which makes for the most exciting fishing. Take lots of minnow imitating crankbaits such as rapala husky jerks,slivers, and shallow shad raps , bombers, and Smithwick Rogues. Make sure to use a leader or you will lose a lot of money! Take some topwaters as well. If they are in the right mood the pike will nail them right out of the water. In line Spinners and plastic jerkbaits also work well. Never had much success with ""bass"" spinners. Make sure to have a depthfinder, a gps would be very handy as the lake is huge and it is easy to get lost. Watch out for sunken reefs as I know of a few boats that lost props and legs of motors on them. It is true that the best fishing will be found North. This is a long way from Southend so if you go make sure you have lots of gas. The outfitters on the lake will sell it to you but be prepared to pay double or triple regular price. Good Luck! I wish I was coming with you!!"
512260,JN,2001-05-10 20:07:00,47,"Forgot to mention this before, I don't know where your coming from but it may be better to go up through Mann., go up past Lynn Lake till you hit Reindeer, I think it's shorter(no better road thou but no worse). I do know you'll be farther up the Lake. I think I can make it grom Des Moinse IA to there in 26 to 28 hr. took us almost 35 to go to the S end. Then we went 30 mi. up the lake and wished we went more."
512261,Guest,2001-05-11 07:16:00,0,"Jm is right. If you go past Lynn Lake, Man. you can get right to the lake at Kinoosao(Co-op point). This is where we picked up supplies and guides for our camp. Fishing the main lake around Kinoosao is going to be much more productive than staying south. If I were to drive to Reindeer I would probably head to Kinoosao simply because I know the fishing around there is excellent. If you have a map I could tell you the names of some places to try."
512262,Skyraptor,2001-05-12 03:56:00,291,"Hey Guys, thanks for all the helpful information, we are going to be staying at Reindeer Lake Trout Camp that is located about 15 miles from the south end I think right around Deep Bay. From what I have read the further north you go the better the fishig will be. So what can I expect since I will be on the south end of the lake? I take it the fishing will still be good and that the northerns and lake trout still can be caught but in what number and what size? Anymore insight would be great. TIA"
