512272,Hammerhead Herb,2001-05-12 08:39:00,259,"S V Man,What's 71 like? Is it 4 lane and what is the speed limit going through some of the towns?"
512273,Guest,2001-05-12 09:30:00,0,"Hammerhead Herb,Highway 71 has recently been widened and resurfaced and it puts highway 502 to shame. It is a mostly two a lane highway, but in some areas, for short distances, it goes to a four lane or has passing lanes. It also has nice wide shoulders in most areas. I can't remember for sure what the speed limit through the towns are, but I think its 30 mph. There are only two real towns that you pass through on highway 71, Nester Fall and Sioux Narrows and it only takes a few minutes to get through them. It is a good highway all the way to highway 17(running east and west), which is just out of Kenora. Hope this helps and good fishing.S.v.m"
512286,Guest,2001-05-14 08:58:00,0,"Heading up to Eagle lake just west of Dryden on Friday. Will or has construction already started? I can handle the pot holes but construction delays could run into the ""hours"" on this opening weekend. Might consider going around, although it appears to be nearly 75 miles further."
512276,Guest,2001-05-09 06:04:00,0,"Heading up to SE end of Lac Seul first week in June and was planning on taking 502 but not sure now. We're from Duluth. Does anyone know what the ""best route"" would be for us? We need to get to Hudson by Souix Lookout. Thanks"
512284,GregK,2001-05-09 09:54:00,113,"I've used 502 for the last 6 years or so. The last time was last September. The road is indeed rough although some of the southern most part has be redone very nicely. Here's the scoop. Yes its a rough road. Yes, it has no shoulders in many areas and deep, deep drops if you screw up. It's got pot holes etc and you have to slow down to navigate it. HOWEVER, you will be hard pressed to find a more beautiful stretch of highway in all of Ontario. If this is your first trip to heaven, I would suggest taking the 502, save the travel time and gas, sloooow down and take time to smell the flowers. Just be very careful and let the other crazies pass you when they have the opportunity."
512277,Guest,2001-05-09 10:58:00,0,"In my opinion 502 isn't that rough. I avg. 55 to 60 MPH pulling my ProV. The risk you take for travel this summer is the delays caused by road construction. They don't have a shoulder to devert traffic on and when they dig the middle of the road it is shut down in both directions until they are done. Last summer we sat for 1 1/2 hours on one trip. HWY 71 is about 35 miles west of Ft. Francis. Go north to Hwy 17 then east to Vermilion Bay. I would estimate that this route is about 75 miles further. I've been to Ear Fall using this route and it was not that big a deal. ##### I was on vacation, right. I would suggest that you find out the construction schedule by contacting the Ontario Provincial Police office in EMO or Fort Francis. I'm out of Duluth as well. Heading to Bassit and Whiteface this weekend (MN opener) What about you/"
512278,Guest,2001-05-09 11:16:00,0,Fishing fever must be affecting my reading ability. Going to Hudson would be about 125 miles further by the time you got back to Dryden. Are you going Houseboating? TGG
512282,RMB,2001-05-10 11:21:00,251,"I go to Sioux Lookout and Lac Suel at least once or twice a year as well as other trips to the Dryden area. Take the North shore drive to the border at Pigeon River. After you cross the border about 10 miles north of there towards Thunder Bay there is a County Hyway short cut, Hyway 138 I believe (it's on the map), that will take you right up to Hyway 11 west near Kekabec Falls. Go west on 11 and it will eventually turn into hyway 17 that goes towards Dryden. Just as you enter Ignace take the major hyway north just before town towards Pickle Lake. Follow north till you come to the Silver Dollar and turn left there. Follow this till you get to Sioux Lookout. Hudson is just through Sioux Lookout and to the East. You may want to stop there anyhow as there really isn't anything in Hudson any way. Word of caution. From Hyway 17 all the way there are many moose at night. just be careful as they are not afraid of the hyways or you. Good Luck!"
512283,RMB,2001-05-10 11:24:00,251,"Also, forgot to mention that this route is all very nice roads. Even the back hyways north of Ignace."
512285,Buznick,2001-05-10 12:52:00,7,"Here is the latest scoop on 502. Gamble Constuction of Dryden will be completing their contract from last year, which consists of 38 kilometers from where they finished last year. This means their contract will end at Gold Rock. The MTO have applied to have the rest of the Hiway improved to Dryden. Unfortunatly theOntario Government is not spending any $$$ on road improvements at this time. The MTO are hopeing this will change later on in the summer. Keep the sunny side up And have a great vacation!!!Buznick"
512279,Guest,2001-05-11 06:34:00,0,"Thanks for the info! We probably will take 502 in the daylight and take our time, sounds like a pretty drive anyway....Going to Vermillion for opener... how is Whiteface in the spring? We've fished it in the summer and it's like the dead sea!! Hope you catch your limit and then some.... good luck and report back after the weekend if you get the chance! Thanks!"
512280,Guest,2001-05-11 06:36:00,0,"Oh, no we're not going houseboating. We're taking our own boat and staying at Lost Island Lodge by Hudson on the SE end of Lac Seul. Can't wait!!"

512264,Hammerhead Herb,2001-05-06 09:14:00,259,Do any of you nice folks up North know if the MTO of Ontario has any plans to ever improve 502 from east of Ft. Frances to Dryden? It seems that the road is getting worse every year.
512265,Buznick,2001-05-06 18:09:00,7,I have travelled 502 recently and it is in worse shape than it ever has been. I have been told that a local construction company was awarded a contract for repairs of up to 35 kms.It could sure use alot more repairs than just 35kms. I will checkwith the MTO and verify this info.Busnick
512266,Moose_MI,2001-05-08 06:37:00,31,I'll be going up 502 through Dryden on my way to Perrault Falls in June. How bad is 502?....What's wrong with it? I've never been up that way.
512267,Guest,2001-05-08 06:56:00,0,"Moose_MI,Besides being curvy, hilly, and having little or no shoulders on the highway, it is full of bumps, potholes, washouts, and miles and miles of no pass zones. It is approximately 100 miles of wilderness, so hope you don't breakdown after reaching Mallard's restaurant (approximately 22 miles from the turn-off of highway 11). Also, it is not recommended traveling at night (or sometimes early in the morning) because, have you got this, the moose population that has a tendency to cross over the road at the most inopportune time. Give yourself plenty of extra time if traveling the infamous Highway 502. Last year, however, they did make about 30 miles of improvements at the southern portion of the highway. The most redeeming quality of the highway, is that it goes through some very picturesque Canadian scenery. Good luck on your trip and good luck fishing.Remember to keep your eyes open and your feet dry.S.v.m"
512268,Walley Guide,2001-05-08 07:37:00,67,"I have been using 502 for many years. If I remember wasn't it first paved sometime in the 70's? We traveled it once before the pavement was there...WOW what a ride...100 miles of gravel road...and the pulp trucks had the right a way for sure....when we reached the camp it looked like someone dumped a bucket of dirt in our bags.Last year the road was as bad as ever. Drive with caution, I remember seeing two rigs with hubs/axles being repaired. I have always managed to make it with out many problems (knockin' on wood)I did toss a bearing buddy off a trailer a few years back...Just be careful...About driving in daylight, that's great advice, one: for the view and two: as mentioned I tried it once in the dark and that black spot in my headlights had to be ""Bullwinkle"" himself....I'll be heading up 502 the first of June...But I plan on driving along Superior Drive either on the way up or back....Happy Fishing!Walley"
512269,Guest,2001-05-08 10:29:00,0,"I have traveled 502 for 12 years on my way to Red Lake. last year i tried 71 west of Ft. Francis. Excellent road. It is a little further, but the time is the same because of the good road. i won't take 502 again."
512270,Guest,2001-05-08 11:34:00,0,I have traveled that road for years also. I believe they will do about 30-35 km / year for the next two or three years. The southern end is finished and in good shape but if they are working on it depend on up to 1 hour waits for blasting. 71 is my choice for the next two years or until they finish construction on 502. Once a logging road always a logging rd.
512271,Guest,2001-05-08 14:54:00,0,"Using highway 71, which is now a very good highway, is a good alternate route when traveling up to the Ear Falls area. However, it is a bit out of the way if you're headed up to the Sioux Lookout area. If going north on highway 71, then east on highway 17 through Dryden, this will add a little over an hour to your journey. But, as mentioned in the above post, you will run into delays (possibly long ones) if highway 502 is under construction. It seems that there are limited ways to reach your desired destination on Canadian highways and they are not always of the best quality. Also, watch out for those free-wheeling, cross the center line logging trucks. Good luck and good fishing to all.S.v.m"
512274,BD,2001-05-08 18:02:00,739,"What's the road that goes north from Atikokan (brain dead tonight, can't remember the number)? The pavement is pretty good, the logging trucks are just as bad as anywhere else, but it won't add a lot of extra travel time like 71 if you're heading to Dryden."
512275,BD,2001-05-08 18:17:00,739,"Correction; The last line of my post above should have read ""heading east of Dryden or to Ignace""."
