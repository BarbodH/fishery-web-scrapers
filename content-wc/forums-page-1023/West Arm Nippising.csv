The last 5 yrs or so it seems the fishing has really fallen off, specially last year. We usually go in June and sometimes in Sept. A group of 5 last year only caught 2 walleyes among us, the usual amount of hammerheads, not many perch but the ones we did get were jumbo's.I realize they put a slot limit into effect on walleyes, which was far overdue, but it seems they aren't there anymore to even practice C&R. Trying to get my group to go further NW to another lake but certain ones just want to go back and ""beat a dead horse""!! I would be very interested in what others have to say about this part of the lake? The people and the camps are great but the fishing has been less that desireable. Thanks for your comments."

512314,Fallsman,2001-05-08 01:52:00,93,Generally the most consistent walleye fishing has been on the south shore or in and around the mouth of the French River. You might want to make a change this year and try one of the lodges in this area.
512315,Guest,2001-05-14 10:08:00,0,"I've been fishing the area near the mouth of the French for a number of years. We had a great trip last year. Caught a number of walleyes, smallies and largemouth. In light of the fact that we are catch and release guys, the slot limit made the trip more fun. We were suprised that the fish seemed to be a little bigger than in past years. We've often considered trying other lakes, but for some reason, we keep going back."
