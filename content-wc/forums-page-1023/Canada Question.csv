512488,Guest,2001-05-13 07:11:00,0,I can't find it in the regs:1. Are lifejackets now being required to be worn and not just in the boat?2. Legal drinking and smoking age. Unfortunately my son(age 20) has begun smoking. Is he legal in Canada.Thanks
512489,Guest,2001-05-13 07:43:00,0,Drinking and Smoking depends on the Province.......these are like states. Ontario is 19....Manitoba is 18. Quebec has no laws on this (just kidding....couldn't resist getting a jab in) If you are in Nothern Ontario....smoking and walking in fire season is against the law. You have to stop and have your smoke. Boats and boating are coast guard which is federal. I do not think you have to wear them just have them handy. I like to wear mine..............just in case.

Also you need a whistle, bailing bucket, flashlight, and a rope in the boat. Drinking age in Canada I think is 19 I think...so I would assume smoking is the same or younger... Enjoy your trip...."

I looked for the booklet, and thought I would scan the page for you, but I am unable to find it. I believe it was from a couple of years back...anyone out there know? I would be interested to know as well...I talked to the camp owner and he told me the regs in Ont. were basically the same as last year. All I have, which isn't much.Happy Fishing!Walley"
