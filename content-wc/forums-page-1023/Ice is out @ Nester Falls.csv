512214,Guest,2001-05-05 03:29:00,0,The ice is out on Whitefish Bay too so this morning we are off to the island. No e-mail service there. See you in October.
512211,Guest,2001-05-06 15:52:00,0,We usually go up the first or second week in June and then the middle of September. This year we are not making it in June. Go by Splitrock camp often and looks like a nice place. Do they have a web site?

512215,Guest,2001-05-09 09:45:00,0,We always go up over Memorial Day. Have had success jigging the weeds and sany bays. Do you guys ever pull cranks or spinners in the Spring. Are you keying on sand and weeds as well? We stay on an island near Young's wilderness Camp in Steven's Bay.Lane
512216,Guest,2001-05-14 15:49:00,0,"Walleye fishing we use bottom bouncers (just enough weight to feel the bottom), gold and orange little joe type spinners, and nightcrawlers. Alot of people use leeches and minnows, but we feel you catch more with worms. Work the areas you talk about around Wolf and Blueberry areas. We have had decent pulling # 7 shadraps (shad and copper colors best) and thin fins (blue and black)."
