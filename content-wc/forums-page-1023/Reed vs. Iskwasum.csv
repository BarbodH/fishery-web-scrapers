512493,Guest,2001-05-13 10:30:00,0,In my earlier post- somebody said to fish Reed for 'eyes'. Our group goes to Iskwasum. Is it as good or should we go the extra km. to Reed?
512494,Guest,2001-05-13 17:49:00,0,"Both are good. Iskwasum opens June 1 and if weather is blowing, it is a safe choice. Reed is a large lake but produces some great walleye catches. Just be careful if weather ""blows up"". Have a safe trip."
