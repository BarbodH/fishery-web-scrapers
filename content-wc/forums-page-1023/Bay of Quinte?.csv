Specifically: Any ideas on where to stay (one or two nights, tent camping is an option), where to fish and ""how to.."" Time frame: Any time before the middle of June. Thanks in advance."
512391,Guest,2001-05-11 12:24:00,0,The bay of quinte has become increasingly poor over past few years. The ministry of natural resources seem to blame it on Native spearing and gill netting of spawning fish in the spring. They report reductions of 30% plus a year in fish population. I would focus on alternative fishery as I was forced to do despite regular excursions in past.
