We are thinking of trying some other areas for variety, and Wiley Point Lodge appears somewhat remote on the map. Is this a good lodge and how is the fishing? Thanks for any insight Don"

It was a full meal deal with a nice lodge, good food and a very accomodating staff. Fishing was good, raised a real nice Muskie and caught some walleye. It is a good boat ride from their Totem Resort on the east shore at LOTW by Souix Narrows. Must be 15 miles or more and it is as you note remote being on the NW shore of LOTW with only boat access."
