512085,Guest,2001-04-29 17:55:00,0,"Finally someone hit it. Watching all the math (and all the mistakes) made me start to look into it.I was glad to see that someone hit on the exchange rate. So...I started looking at it.Say...gas is 77.9 per litre. At 3.78 litres/gal (approximate but close enough being less than 3/1000 off which is minimal/not noticable for a regular gas fill up and a 55% exchange rate you get the following:If I do exchange correctly: 55% would be $1 Canadian funds would cost $.55 U.S. funds (assuming this).779 x 3.78 = $2.94 (canadian...assuming the 77.9 is canadian funds)Take the $2.94 x .55 = 1.62 per gallon. About the same..if not less than what we pay here. God I hope I am right on this...I better be (being a math teacher) or I need to go back to basic algebra. If anything is wrong it will be in the exchange..the other math is correct..that I know... If I am wrong, I am sure I will get someone poking fun at me...math teachers are not always correct..."
512086,Hammerhead Herb,2001-04-29 18:22:00,259,"Sorry about using the factor of 4.546 l. per gallons. That is the factor for Canadian gallons (not US). Chaz is absolutely right on his factor.SVaerst, I understand that the Canadian dollar is closer to 64 US cents. Therefore multiply your 2.94 CD$ by .64 to get US $'s.I come up with 1.88 US$; that's about what we are paying in the Chicago area for 89 octane."
512087,chrism,2001-04-29 18:46:00,429,"HH-You are correct on the exchange - I just bought some USD a few days ago and ""ouch""!I guess I should have been more specific on which currency I was using - my final calculations were in Cdn $$$, based on what I am paying in Winnipeg. Regardless, it is around $1.75 - $1.85 USD per US gallon depending where and what you buy in Manitoba, and more in remote locations.And yes, it is almost the same once all the conversions are done.Lakes are still solid up here....."
512088,Chaz,2001-04-30 03:11:00,46,"It doesn't matter which side of the border you are on; the oil companies are still making enormous profits compared to last year as prices continue to rise.I work for a Corporation that owns electric and gas companies and I find it funny that these items are regulated because they are essentials but the petroleum companies can set any price they want, whether it be home heating oil or gasoline. Am I missing something here?"
512089,Guest,2001-04-30 11:21:00,0,"The thing I hate about it is that I Believe the Government Knows it's going on, but is not willing to stand up to our wonderful members at OPEC. OPEC knows the global market and if they want to cut production they can at their own will...that is what stinks...everybody needs the stuff, so nobody wants to harm the trade. The government gets good tax dollars from the sale of petroleum products, so they like the demand...more money to spend foolishly.As for my calculations above, I just went with the previous post on the 55%. That did seem awfully low for exchange...usually has been around 70% or so, so the 64 cents us to $1 canadian seems more like it. God I hope the prices don't go up too high or a certain manitoba trip is going to get expensive..."
512090,Guest,2001-05-01 07:34:00,0,"Presently, in Québec city, a litre of regular gas costs 86.9 , canadian money ; a U.S. gallon equals 3.7854 litres . Have a good trip."
512091,Walley Guide,2001-05-01 07:56:00,67,Folks thanks very much for the help. It has helped me line up how much money to exchange to take on the trip. There is no way I could have figured all this with out you help.I hope I can help each of you in return on this board as well...Thanks again.Walley
512092,Guest,2001-05-11 11:53:00,0,You could always keep on eye on http://www.gashawk.com It will give you current gas prices.
512075,Walley Guide,2001-04-20 05:07:00,67,I need some information on the current price of fuel in Ont. I am working on plans for a trip to Canada and would like to have some idea on the total cost. Thanks in advance for the help....Walley
512076,Dan,2001-04-20 08:13:00,325,We're paying between 72.9 up to 76.9 a litre
512077,Guest,2001-04-20 08:50:00,0,sudbury ont. 80.4 fuel price
512078,River_eye,2001-04-20 13:06:00,1486,"Come to Manitoba, It has been 62.9 lately, but it just went up to 65.9River eye"
512079,Walley Guide,2001-04-20 19:11:00,67,"Thanks for the help.....I wanted to get some figures on the cost of the trip. Our fuel is running around $1.60 per gallon...and I'm sure it will go up before spring.Thanks again,Walley"
512080,chrism,2001-04-21 12:23:00,429,"$1.60 USD per US gallon you say? Let's see.... 1 Us Gallon = 4 litres;..... 1 US gallon = $1.60 USD, or $2.50 Cdn... 1 Litre = 70 (ish)cents, or $2.80 per US gallon...Bottom line is that our Gov't charges about 10 % more when all the math is done! Not worth sweating about.Beer and tobacco is another story..."
512081,Guest,2001-04-23 08:08:00,0,Québec City: 83.4 this morning but heard it will rise 15 cents per liter today.
512082,Hammerhead Herb,2001-04-24 08:20:00,259,"According to this websitehttp://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Metrics/factors.htm#volumethere are 4.546 liters per US gallon.As of today1 Canadian dollar equals 64.54 US cents.Therefore, once you know how much the gas is in Canada, multiply the [(Canadian $)/(liters)] by 2.9339884 (roughly 3) to get the price in US$/gal.Therefore 0.75 CD$/liter gas will run approximately $2.35 USD/gal. If you buy gas with the VISA card, you incur very little loss in the exchange rate."
512083,Chaz,2001-04-28 03:22:00,46,3.7854118 Liters per US gal.
512084,Guest,2001-04-28 05:00:00,0,We were in Fort Frances and Nestor Falls this past Thur and Friday. Pump price in those places was 77.9 Cents per liter..There are 3.78 liters per U.S. gallon. Exchange rate is 55%. What exchange you get at businesses will vary but usually a little less that at a bank.
