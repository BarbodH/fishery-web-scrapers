Any suggestions on were to fish as well as preference of minnows, leeches, or crawlers? Assume Jigging and trolling of spiners are the preferred methods"
512406,HLLGuide,2001-05-10 20:33:00,10,"Are you fishing out of a resort? When are you coming up to the Falls? If you are fishing in May or early June look for the fish shallow. Lost Bay can be a real good spot. Pitch 1/8 or 1/16oz jigs near islands or weed patches. Trolling a hammered gold spinner can be deadly also. Mainly fish with minnows this time of the year. Mid-summer look for the walleyes on reefs or island shelfs, 15-25 feet. Again jigs with minnows or a lindy rig with a leech or crawler is the preferred method. Erickson's reef, Stubbs shoal, or the little island east of Steamboat are good spots this time of year. If you make it up past the Brule Narrows, fish any reef on the map, all of them will put fish in the boat.(Same methods as mid-summer.) Hope this helps you out. Best of luck to you!Guide"
