I would love to experience a trip that allows the opportunity to catch trophy fish everytime you wet a line. I have watched their website for years and the quanity and size of fish caught there are very exciting. I just can't get my Walleye fishing buddies interested in Pike and Lake Trout. I hope that the trips that are mentioned in this thread will expand some of our ideas on other trips to be considered. Thanks, Mike Kansas"
2177313,wallydave,2013-10-21 08:15:00,2151,"My dream trip would be to a remote lake with one or two cabins, fantastic fishing and plenty of solitude. Eddie North comes to mind, but Im sure there will be some great replies! Nothing like some website surfing during the post-pretrip time of year."
2177425,hoppy63,2013-10-21 08:48:00,367,"My dream trip is a retirement (pipe-dream) trip.....although I have thought about it, I'm sure it will never happen, but it is a ""dream"" trip. I would have to research and plan well in advance but it would go like this.....I would trail or my own boat up north leaving in early June, and stop at my fishing destinations, staying in a cabin and fishing the nearby waters.....starting out north and west of the soo, stay in 5-7 days at a stop, and traveling west above minn........mixing in 2-3, week along fly-ins to various lakes....then make my way back first or second week of sept!"

2178225,Pikeslayer8,2013-10-21 16:53:00,1460,"I have given this much thought over the years. Sure, there are a few lakes that might offer a better chance at catching a trophy fish than where I fish (Wabakimi) and sure, there are lakes that offer more and different species of fish than where I go but, when I am at my lake, I am home. Go somewhere else. Not fer me. I got absolutely no desire to go anywhere else."

2184770,skap,2013-10-25 08:52:00,58,This is an easy one for me. Lake St. Joesph for a week. Its just someplace I have always wanted to go. I make a couple short trips a year to Minnitaki and love it! however just once I would like to travel a little farther north and spend a week at St. Joseph.
