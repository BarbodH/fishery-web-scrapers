2217730,gary2242,2013-11-13 10:24:00,49,"I manage the websites for 200 lodges in Ontario and also spent 20 years as a fishing guide so maybe I can help.Lakes with massive trophy walleyes usually have a much lower population of Walleyes. So quality of Walleye fishing needs to be split into size vs. numbers. Best Lakes for Big Trophy Walleye (not in any order):- Lady Evelyn Lake- Gowganda Lake- Ceder Lake into the Petawawa River (Algonquin Park)- Lac Seul- Eagle Lake- Wabigoon / Dinorwick Chain- Jackfish River into Lake Nipigon- Attawapiskat River- Bay of Quinte- Lake Erie off of Wheatley Harbour If you live in the mid-west or on the west coast then you should consider fishing the Churchill River in Northern Saskatchewan.There are hundreds of lakes where you can catch 80 to 100 Walleyes per day. It's more practical to list them by region. The fly-in lakes north of Vermilion Bay, Red Lake, Nakina, Jellicoe, Armstrong & Cochrane are a good place to start. Finding drive-to lakes with 80 to 100 walleyes is much harder. You will never find this kind of fishing on a lake with public access. Some lodges are licensed to have boat caches on backcountry portage lakes and only their guests are allowed to fish them. Here are lodges that I know of that have really good portage lakes.Auld Reekie LodgeAnishinabi LodgeSandy Point CampPasha Lake CabinsFive Mile Lake LodgeI hope this helps.GaryWalleyeHeaven.com"
2222162,pjshorthorn,2013-11-16 07:11:00,5654,"Anderson's is also another nice outfitter on Lac Seul out of Sioux Lookout. They have American plans cabins, new equipment, guides and outposts cabins with all the amenities a lady might require. They have a website with all the details. Another suggestion would be Lost Island Lodge. More of an outpost lodge ( on an island) ,but they do have an American plan with cabins that are fully appointed. The lodge is a short 5 minute ride by boat to the boat landing where folks park. I'm sure they would run you over so a dinner trip into Sioux Lookout could happen if you had the desire to dine out.Have fun and Tight Lines,PjShorthorn"

525922,Guest,2002-12-17 06:26:00,0,"Portage in from Brown's on West Clearwater (good laker fishing) or outpost cabin from berglund outfitters, right? Ever try sanford for lakers? AB"
525942,walleyedude,2002-12-17 20:38:00,34,"Here's one no one else has mentioned- Cygnet Lake near Minaki.We have had many 300 fish days there.Nothing over 8 lbs but with that kind of action,who cares?"
525943,Guest,2002-12-18 14:58:00,0,any lake that gawley fly's into. Have been going up to ontario for 23 years and I am only 30 and have been too all kinds of lakes but for the past 5 years I have never seen anything like Gawley's fly in's do. You have to pull your line in and put your pole down to stop catching them.

525944,Guest,2002-12-20 09:43:00,0,"walleye-ahhhh, been thinking about gawley's for the past few years but never pulled the trigger on them for lak of references. So what lakes have you been to and could you elaborate on them a little, fishing,acomadations,service,best time to go. thanks; Doc."
525946,walleyedude,2002-12-21 20:51:00,34,"It is 7 miles west of Minaki to the access road (toward the Whitedog Reserve) and another 7 miles south down the access road.Hard to get to, the roads are rough, but the best fishing is always at the end of the worst roads!The previous owners,Bill & Sandy Demker,were awsome.The camp was well kept and you could not ask for 2 friendlier people.They sold the camp to 2 guys from Wisconsin summer before last,and I have not been able to go since the camp changed hands.They have some pretty big shoes to fill.We will be going again this May long weekend.w"
525928,Guest,2002-12-16 10:32:00,0,"John, I fogot to mention it earlier but the Pike fishing is great the first week of July on Lac Seul. We fish the weedbeds with 3/4 oz spinner baits and have had many 200 Pike days per boat on Lac Seul. The colors that worked the best for us are white,chartreuse,red and combos of each. We like double willow leaf blades in Gold or Silver. We fish out of Lac Seul Lodge and stay at Black Bay Outpost Camp....this part of the Lake has been great for us."
525929,stratman,2002-12-16 11:19:00,16,":) Thanks for the info Mike. Lac Seul sounds great. I would like to try the outpost but I would have to talk my wife into that. I promised her american plan or at least evening meals out. I've located a resort close to the one you stayed at. They have meals and really nice boats with padded swivel seats. When you've had a lot of birthdays you need more comfort. Now I'll have to make a decision on where to go. Maybe I'll try another lake also. I should have stated in my post that I was wanting northwest ontario. By the way I live in Des Moines. It must be illegal to have double beds in canada, because all most all resorts only have single beds. I'll bet the resort owners don't sleep on single beds."
525930,Guest,2002-12-16 12:46:00,0,"John, There is a Lodge on Lac Seul that sounds like it might meet your requirements. Silver Water Wheel Lodge is has Amercian Plan and is located on a great part of Lac Seul to fish. I believe they have full Guide service avaliable and I know they have a great reputation for fishing and service. They have a website ...just type in Silver Water Wheel Lodge....GOOD LUCK"

525932,stratman,2002-12-16 17:01:00,16,"Darn you Fred-G, now you've given me something else to consider. This place sounds fabulous. I may have to spend the whole summer in Ontario. Ha-Ha"
525933,Guest,2002-12-16 17:15:00,0,"is there a map or web site or any thing with a picture/drawing of a lake on it AND all of the lodges that are on the lake also indicated? examples ;lac seul,gull rock,st joseph,eagle lake.(these lakes seem to have a significant number of lodges on them.in their brochures they never mention that there are any other lodges on the lake.i've been trying for 11/2 years to find some thing with this info and haven't come up with it yet...some one should publish something like this.i think it would sure help out some one trying to find the RIGHT place to spend their money.any one out there got any suggestions?

They feature a Canada Fever section during the winter months, I love it. Pick up a copy. And no I don't work for this magazine."
525916,stratman,2002-12-15 17:00:00,16,Would someone know the top 10 rated walleye lakes in Ontario ? Also does the rating mean that much as far as deciding where to take a fishing trip. Thanks for any help.
525917,Walleye Wacker,2002-12-15 19:07:00,6,Dont know of a official rateing....but Lac Seul has to be one of the best. We have fished it for years and it yields many fish and a trophy or two every year for us.
525918,Guest,2002-12-15 19:29:00,0,White Otter! - Betcha don't know where that is in Ontario. But it is wonderful
525919,stratman,2002-12-15 20:47:00,16,"No Iron Ranger, i've never heard of white otter and have no idea where it is."
525920,bigfish1965,2002-12-15 23:55:00,3210,"Lake Ontario holds most of the annual live release winners, but Erie puts out more fish than probably all others combined."
525923,Guest,2002-12-16 08:01:00,0,"Where are you coming from? There are so many great places to fish. Are you looking for an Amercian Plan ,cabin or a outpost? Do you want to catch numbers of fish or big fish and what time of year are you going?"
525924,redlaker,2002-12-16 08:39:00,0,The Chukuni watershed lots of fish 5 lakes all connected.
525925,Guest,2002-12-16 09:59:00,0,"Lake Nippising hasn't been mentioned nor has the Niagara River. Both of those places are very good for walleye.Another great place for big eyes is the Bay of Quinte (on Lake Ontario) close to Bellville and Kingston Ontario and only a stone's throw from the US border. At times the ice fishing on Quinte can be really hot, and it frequently yields some pretty BIG fish."
525926,stratman,2002-12-16 10:00:00,16,Mike I live in Iowa and will be going to Canada probrably the 1st week in July. I fished the woods for several years and thought it would be nice to try somewhere else. I thought I would go to one of the top rated walleye lakes and live it up with american plan and upgraded lodge boat etc. I know there is a list that rates the lakes. I know that Lac Seul is in the top three. Right now I'm looking at Lac Seul and Gullrock. I also enjoy catching big pike.
525927,Guest,2002-12-16 10:24:00,0,Where in Iowa are you from ? I was raised in Iowa City. Like I told you earlier we have fished Lac Seul for years and it is great. We used to go the week of july 4th but last year we went the second week of June and the Walleye fishing was the best ever. I went on a fall trip to the Red River in Manitoba with a gentleman from Illinois that fishs Gullrock every year. According to him Gullrock would be a excellent choice also. Dont think you can go wrong with either one. Gullrock is smaller and it might be easier to locate fish for a first timer. Check your outfitter out close and get a good lake map and a depth finder will be worth its weight in gold.
