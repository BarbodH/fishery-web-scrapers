2210186,kzoofisher,2013-11-08 08:35:00,5144,"Since rates tend to be higher in May and June I'd say that's the consensus prime time. Everybody having the itch to fish probably a points for some of that, too. Another example of all of us being ripped off by ""the man""."
2196282,onetimedave,2013-11-01 04:12:00,502,In talking with my outfitter i find that most of the prime time are already reserved for 2014. Act now and get yours.
2196338,Camoclad,2013-11-01 06:00:00,628,"What are the times that you consider the ""prime times""? I am a relative newbie to the fly-in experience and just wonder what folks consider to be the best times of the year to book. Thanks."
2196850,oleJoe,2013-11-01 11:26:00,114,"I would say the first 3 or 4 weeks of the season. Weeks 2 an 3 for sure, but it all depends on what you want to get out of it. Peace and quiet and relaxation and they are all good. Throw in some good fishing and you can't go wrong"
2197218,kzoofisher,2013-11-01 14:17:00,5144,"From the opener through the 3rd week of June, give or take depending on the spring then again from the beginning of Sept until it gets too cold for you. Lower density venues like fly-ins are bound to fill up early and stay full, especially if most of the people reserving spots are hardcore anglers who are less likely to not send in their deposits. One outfitter that I talked to filled every week from May through Sept with this past years clients, they just reserved their week when they checked out and nothing ever came open for next year. Tough for me but awfully nice for the regulars. I talked to them in August and they told me then that that was what they were doing and put me down in case anybody backs out. So far nobody has."
2198090,hoppy63,2013-11-02 08:23:00,367,"Not sure what ""prime time"" is except for black flies in June. I went third week in august and weather, fishing, and bugs were all great....maybe just got lucky....."
2198194,kzoofisher,2013-11-02 09:40:00,5144,"The up shallow, post spawn feeding binge is very popular. Fish are generally easy to find and concentrated shallow enough to reach with any presentation."
2198274,ftfarms,2013-11-02 11:33:00,444,IMO prime time would be on a fly in up to who's going. Meaning; what type of weather you are wanting to deal with. I've done 9-10 fly ins and gone form last week in may to first of September where we stayed didn't seem like fishing was much different you got cold wet early and sometimes a little hot the last of July- mid August.
2209778,onetimedave,2013-11-08 06:16:00,502,"Prime time for me is opening of season to last of June,"
2209834,Bigstorm,2013-11-08 06:36:00,799,"I've went up anywhere from the 2nd week in June to the 1st week in August, I honestly cant say anytime is better than another. My biggest walleye to date (28.5"") was caught in mid July. The only difference I noticed is that the fish are in different spots based on the time of year."
2210018,TIGHTLINER,2013-11-08 07:34:00,223,I like from the second week of the Walleye season opener to the last week of June. Only problem is this is prime time for the black flies also. I guess that depends on the weather up north also.
