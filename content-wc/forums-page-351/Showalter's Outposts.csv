I'm taking a trip with Nestor Falls Outposts in late May, and would like to try Showalter's later in the summer. Any thoughts, experiences, etc. would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

They are a long time family run operation that has significant repeat customers, so booking fills up fast. The repeat business speaks to their integrity, and great fishing! Their camps offer a true ""get away from it all"" experience. Most camps you are the only ones on the lake. Eddie works hard to make everything go well. We've had problems on small stuff, and he was up that evening or the next morning to help us out. I've been to Irwin x 2, Pine Needle x 2, and Cochrane Lake. Headed to Cherrington in June. Enjoy changing it up but all of these lakes I would definitely go back in a heartbeat. Would be glad to share more info on those lakes or their operation. If you are looking at a specific lake I can likely put you in touch with someone that has been there. Feel free to PM."
