2210210,Mike Kansas,2013-11-08 08:39:00,1463,"Would love to hear thoughts from WC gang on this. I have always thought that the transistion starts when water temps reach high 60's and the 70's. It also seems to coinside with 3 to 4 weeks after spawn. During the transistion period Walleye can be found in shallow (4' to 8') or deeper in (10' to 25') of water. It can be one of the most difficult times to catch eyes because with this kind of depth range they are spread out over much more of the lake. I like to focus on deeper points, sunken islands or humps that are close to spawning areas. These spots will be the first deeper water the eyes move to. If there is food there they can stage there and be very comfortable. I will fish those areas first and move up the drops back to the spawning area because eyes can be in any of those depths because of food content. I love jig fishing and will use that technique the majority of the time. Lightest jig I can keep vertical with and tipped with minnows or crawlers. Also will use bottom bouncing or Lindy Rig so I can cover more area faster. Watch your electronics for not only eyes and structure change but look for balls of baitfish. Remember there are only three things Walleye do. Swim, Spawn and EAT. Enough of me...lets hear from you. Mike Kansas"

The walleye will be near food so I often use the life cycles of the dominant bait species to target probable fishing spots. If perch are the dominant forage I'll be near weeds, if there is more open water forage I'll look where they might be near structure that walleye also like, e.g. humps, and I always look for spots that focus food like narrows and wind blown points. Last year my trip was a great example of how tough the transition can be. It was the second week of July, mayfly hatch winding down with water temps in the very low 70's. We saw bait everywhere, not just on the electronics but also swimming around the boat. We caught fish but never located any concentrations of good sized fish. Even in the places that held numbers of small fish no better fish ever appeared, even in the hours after dark or before dawn. We eventually resorted to spending a couple of afternoons just tooling around and looking for marks in all kinds of water. It was great to have a plan, too bad it didn't do us any good. Next year we'll crush 'em."
2212826,pjshorthorn,2013-11-10 07:25:00,5654,"I've always fished prior to the post spawn transition ( late May, early June ) and we tended to stay away from the most notable spawning areas as it tended to be mano y mano and motor to motor fishing with a bunch of energetic guys happy with 13-15"" males.We concentrated on the sandy/rocky points and underwater structure similar to yourself where there was enough current or wind to concentrate bait. In many cases we actually would anchor on top of a shallow flat that had a nice drop, cast out to 18-20' of water and bounce a floating jighead (w/ an egg sinker 18"" above) back up the drop slowly. Once we found the fish, the technique seemed to work very well.PjShorthorn"
2214162,Mike Kansas,2013-11-11 07:34:00,1463,"Excellent example of being adapatable to what can work. There are many varying conditions to fishing transisition fish and a good understanding of the structure , the depths and the wind allow you to try different techniques. Hunting them is half the fun and finding them is very rewarding. Mike Kansas"
2216434,btmbncr,2013-11-12 13:45:00,492,"I don't go to Lac Seul as early as a lot of you do.I still fish transitions.Sand to gravel,sand to soft bottom and rocks to sand.These are usually at deeper depths than the fish you find earlier in the season.Bill"
2217522,Mike Kansas,2013-11-13 08:57:00,1463,Even in the early season fishing those type of structure changes is beneficial. Baitfish will move into these spots especially if the wind is moving plancten into them and the eyes will be there to clean up. Mike Kansas
2218434,pjshorthorn,2013-11-13 18:54:00,5654,"I forgot to mention in my earlier post that in some cases a defined current line or pollen line can be that indicator where bait will be concentrating or where the drop starts.Over years of running around in the Gulf of Mexico looking for signs of life, we would stop on any current line and start to troll or drift. IMO the same holds true with walleyes......the bait will be there. Don't pass up the opportunity to explore those transition lines.I think most folks have seen those current lines......have we all fished them???PjShorthorn"
2218546,wallydave,2013-11-13 19:43:00,2151,"One year we fished the NW end of Lac Seul in early July, those areas that were wind blown points where the cloudy water boundries were, those spots held walleyes and pike! Hang on, you never know whats on the end of your line!"
