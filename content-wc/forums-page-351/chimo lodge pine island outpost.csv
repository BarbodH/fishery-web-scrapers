2166361,DavKin,2013-10-15 05:29:00,104,"Hoppy, Peter runs a good operation. We started out at Roderick in the late 90's and have moved on to his northern outposts of Bearberry and Hornby every year since in late August to early Sept. In addition to pike and walleye, Roderick also has lake trout. Dave"
