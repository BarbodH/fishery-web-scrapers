2225954,hoosiercanadian,2013-11-18 19:26:00,104,"I drive 12 hours north of Winnipeg Manitoba to the Lynn Lake area, one more hour beyond that the road ends at Kinnasao Sask. Reindeer Lake, you can;t drive any farther noth in Manitoba anyway. Don't know where your heading but there is a town on the north end of Reindeer lake called Brochet."
2226802,brochet,2013-11-19 08:29:00,88,"we are in quebec,and we can drive another 10 +hours if we had to."
2227266,LOW1,2013-11-19 12:54:00,2828,I am jealous and I hope you have a safe trip.
2227898,brochet,2013-11-19 19:38:00,88,"thanks LOW1 for being so considerate, I'll think about you when I catch my first fish."
2228298,LOW1,2013-11-20 06:37:00,2828,May the black flies pick you up and carry you home.
2219706,brochet,2013-11-14 12:57:00,88,"planning fishing trip for 2014.drive to unexplored,unfished adventure.catch over 100 pike daily.this is a moderately rugged trip.including boat to camp.share expences.need 1 or 2 advid fishermen."
2219738,wallydave,2013-11-14 13:39:00,2151,"Sounds interesting where and when! Plus, you might try this on the Share a Seat board! Good Luck!"
2220514,brochet,2013-11-15 07:20:00,88,"20 hrs from the border,2hr boat ride . maybe end of july.7 to 10 days."
2221242,phishfearme,2013-11-15 14:04:00,1242,"you may want to consider providing some detail. 20 hrs north of what border entry? sault? buffalo? IF? I don't think you can drive 20 hours north of IF or Pidgeon River or the Sault - so do you mean the peace bridge in buffalo. if so, that would mean your in the kapuskasing area - but I think that's less than 20 hrs from buffalo? fishing in northeast Ontario is totally different than in northwest Ontario - james bay lowlands compared to schield lakes. only pike or are walleye available (this is walleye central) providing some detail like the above would assist you greatly in getting a response. phish"
2221258,castnblast,2013-11-15 14:20:00,111,agreed. from thunder bay you would have a touch time driving more than 5 hours north.
2221322,LOW1,2013-11-15 14:55:00,2828,So what's the most northern latitude where walleye exist?Driving 20 hours - could be Great Bear area? Yellowknife?
2221330,tooski,2013-11-15 14:56:00,393,"It's been over 20 years but I think we took the road on the east side of James Bay all the way to what I think was Raddison Quebec. It was **** close to 20 hours, and that was from the Buffalo crossing... Certainly nowhere in western Ontario can you travel that far north....Are you rooting for the Brownies over Cinci Phish?"
2221418,phishfearme,2013-11-15 15:47:00,1242,DA BROWNS!! if the steelers can't be in the post season then neither should be the old browns nor the bungles.
2221426,phishfearme,2013-11-15 15:50:00,1242,it's not so much how far north - see:http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_173221.html phish
2221730,brochet,2013-11-15 20:59:00,88,"its 20 hr from thousand islands (not in a strait line) .i would like to find someone that's interested before I go into fine details,there are walleyes in these waters along with trout,however as I said its largly unexplored.i fished the area 3 times,however its so vast I just scratched the surface.this is an adventure.this is not a trip for the average fisherman,dont get me wrong,we always have a great time and the trip is well organized."
