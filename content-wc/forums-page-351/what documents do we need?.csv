2212434,bjknipp,2013-11-09 19:38:00,6,My dad and I are planning on taking my nephew to Canada next year. My father and I have been to Canada several times and each have a passport. My nephew is 13 years old and doesn't have a passport. Does he need a passport? What type of documents do I need to get from brother and sister in law? Any ideas???
2212474,BornToFish,2013-11-09 19:55:00,1224,"My wife and I took our nephew to NW Ontario on fishing trips. We took a letter from his parents that gave numerous pieces of inforamtion such as his name, his parent's name, our names, permission to cross the border together, dates of entry/departure from Canada, medical/dental insurance information, authorization to administer anaethesia and the like. The letter was signed by both parents and notarized.Our nephew had his own passport even though he was a minor. We sailed across the border both ways each time we went to Canada together. I know of situations where the adults did not have such a letter for their minor relative and were denied crossing the border. I recommend guys taking their children to Canada to have such a letter from the children's s mothers when the mothers do not accompany the children.Crossing the border becomes problematic when the youngster doesn't have the same last name as the adults. It's an automatic red flag.Our nephew did not need to purchase a fishing license as he was a minor, but his fish counted against our bag limit.Good luck. Enjoy your time together!"
2212562,BreezyPoint,2013-11-09 21:04:00,1581,That notarized letter is really important. They even asked me for that letter (from my wife) when taking my young kids across the border. Getting it notarized is really important.

It doesn't need a ton of detail but get the dates, destination, who else is traveling and relationships to the kid. A passport makes eveything a lot smoother and I think the guards appreciate that. We were all jokes at the border this year and got through in a couple minutes with two kids."

Passports weren't needed at the time when my son started going with me so I'm not sure on the age when it is needed now.Check the search engine in this website as there are multiple threads and links regarding this topic. I would also make sure to check the Canadian Government websites to ensure no requirements have changed recently. Examples of the letter format are on their website.I would recommend that you carry at least three copies of the notarized letter with an original signature from the parents on each copy in case the custom agents want to keep a copy or one becomes damaged during the trip. I carried three each year just in case.No one ever kept a copy and we never had a problem with the correct information in hand when we crossed the border.Best of luck on your trip. It has been the best experience for me personally to have my son on these trips. I'm sure you'll find the same with your nephew.PjShorthorn

And include on it the telephone number(s) for the border folks to call if they have any questions for the parents. I would include all work, home, and cell numbers.I take four trips to Canada with kids a year. On most of them my wife is home or driving another vehicle. I am asked for the permision letter about 40% of the time. My wife has never been asked."
