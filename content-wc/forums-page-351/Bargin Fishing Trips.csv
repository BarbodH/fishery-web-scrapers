2205889,kzoofisher,2013-11-06 09:48:00,5144,"When I started going to Ontario in the '80s we camped exclusively, paid a small fee to launch and set up on an island a few miles away. Other campers were very bad about taking out their garbage and we got sick of it so we started staying in cabins and now we're spoiled. I still think camping is a great way to cut costs if you can find the right spot."
2213794,roscoe33,2013-11-10 21:51:00,653,"We used to camp Ontario back in the 60's and 70's.But now, most of the guys don't have camping gear, and some of the gang don't have boats, and the women like toilets. Ok, so do the men. Personally, after spending hundreds of nights sleeping on the ground, dealing with the bugs and weather, I am more than willing to have a roof over my head, a heater in the corner, and a fridge in the kitchen."
2215882,wallydave,2013-11-12 07:10:00,2151,"http://www.sturgeonriveroutfitters.com/fishing.htmlThis looks a bargain trip, plus it is small enough that you will see very few boats to deal with. Thats the kind of place I like!"

2217818,bigwalleye1,2013-11-13 11:35:00,2632,"We've been going to Frog Rapids camp for years. A housekeeping cabin for 4 for a week is $378 per person. It's a drive-to camp, and I bring my own boat. I can access 4 lakes from the doc, and either boat to or trailer to Lac Seul if I choose. They also cut the rates for a second tri in the same season and after Labor Day. Deals are out there if you're willing to look."
2201881,v-bay gord,2013-11-04 11:33:00,3168,"I believe I can translate. Cut a deal is saying he misses the day when the cabin (including boat) was a set price. He seems to think everything now is per person with all the ""extras"" as extra charges. Apparently there is ""one guy"" responsible for this mess. Maybe that ""guy"" is the ""man"". Like back in the day, I say we all fight the ""man"". Cut a deal is just a modern day Chez Guevara......"
2202265,kzoofisher,2013-11-04 14:59:00,5144,I literally laughed out loud when I read this. Kind of embarrassing at work. If your lodge makes up t-shirts with a walleye wearing a beret and smoking a cigar I'll buy one.http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...2Kxuv-Ui7TNRsQ

Well I can't say enough about http://www.lacdesmille.com/rates.html We've been to over a dozen different resorts, mostly in the lower end of prices, over the last 30+ years. Not sure if they are doing meal plans anymore, but for housekeeping cabins, they do a nice job. The cabins are older, but have been refurbished, great kitchens and bathrooms, but a little sparse in the living room. Warm and comfy for $310 a week per person. Add $400 a week for a boat and motor."

2201361,tooski,2013-11-04 07:17:00,393,lol- now my mind is a mess after trying to read that...
2189321,Mike Kansas,2013-10-28 13:39:00,1463,"I have read a couple of threads about prices being a little higher than guys like to pay. So I thought I would ask the WC gang to post some lodges that are more reasonably priced and still have good fishing. Last year in August wallydave and I fished Black Bear Lodge on Red Lake in August. The price for a week there is $590 and it is Amercian Plan. The food is excellent and the main lodge is very nice. The cabins are basic with bunks and lights. The beds are comfortable and the camp is very clean. The boats (included in price) are older but clean and comfortable and the motors are 15hp and very dependable. There is a main shower and rest room and they are nice. The fishing was good when you consider the wind that week was still and any cloud cover was non existent. Two of us fished five days and boated about 170 Walleye with three over 26"" and a good amount of 17"" and up fish. The eyes were in 20'/26' of water and were caught on jig minnow. We also caught while jigging two Pike in the 37"" range and had several bite offs on what I assume were Pike also. While exploring the lake we found a lot of nice structure and many long points in shallow water (6' to15') that would be great spring/ early summer structure. All in all this place is a great value and I know that wallydave is trying to put another trip together for next year. If intertested you might want to get with him. Mike Kansas"
2189369,wallydave,2013-10-28 13:56:00,2151,"Mike said it well! The trip to BBL was pretty easy on the wallet! The thing that I like about the August trip, with 20 guys and 10 boats you had the lake to yourself for the most part!Not like Lac Seul when you find a spot and start pulling in some walleyes, the next thing you notice is boats all around you! True that has been the June timeframe, and I bet most lakes are busy early season. I liked having the space and less traffic.If interested let Mike or me know! Thanks!"
2189417,BreezyPoint,2013-10-28 14:22:00,1581,"I have to say Goose Bay Camp is a pretty good value if you can take one of their smaller cabins -$600-725 for two people per week. Their smaller cabins are pretty rustic and only big enough for a couple of people. The higher priced on has a brand new shower, bathroom and deck. You have to use the community shower in the lower priced unit. I think their other cabins are also competitively priced if you have a larger group.I was there the third week in July last year. Everyone was making the long trip to MacKenzie Bay every day. We went there only once because we caught a lot of fish close to camp, including our biggest fish within sight of the camp. We caught quite a few from 20-26 inches within a couple miles of the camp, all trolling crank baits in shallow water (6-10)."
2189793,wallydave,2013-10-28 17:34:00,2151,"I agree, Goose Bay has been a good place to fish out of. One of the nice things is you can pay by the day, not the week. Gas and minnows are included in the packages. BBL is a bargain too, just wanted to try some new waters! Either way you cant go.wrong!"
2190289,Larry Mac,2013-10-28 20:12:00,530,"Hi Mike Kansas, this is a great topic for a thread as I believe it will provide some options to those who may have thought that a Canadian fishing trip may have been out of their reach.My recommendation would be Cedar Lake in Perrault Falls Ontario. Cedar Lake is a drive to lake approx 1 1/2 hours south of Red Lake. The lake offers a variety of species of fish including Walleye, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Perch and Crappie. It is also designated as a ""Trophy Muskie Lake"". We have fished Cedar Lake 5 times and I must say on occassion it was truly amazing. We stayed at Jerry and Ellies Cedar Lake Camp. The cabins were amazing complete with full kitchens, 24 hour electric, hot water shower and spring matresses. $515.00/pp gets you a Cabin, Boat, motor, unlimited gas from Saturday to Saturday. I certainly do not know this lake like Glenman and others on this site but with their help we put together some amazing trips. Below are a few Cedar Lake pics. Great thread Mike!!!! I believe it will be useful to many. Thank you,Larry Mac"
2190793,Jatar,2013-10-29 05:54:00,169,"We went to BBL a few years back, I will agree that the food and fishing were great. It's just a little too spartan for my tastes, and while I'm on vacation, I really don't want to wash dishes."
2191153,Mike Kansas,2013-10-29 08:50:00,1463,The dish washing took about 5 minutes a day and the KP duty lasted about 30 minutes for one meal. While it is not a norm at camps it is one great way for BBL to reduce costs and pass them on to the customer. I thought the owners were very well organized and efficent and truly interested in customers being taken care of. It is a marketing function like I have never seen in the 58 years I have been going to Canada. The most important thing to me on a trip is efficent boats and motors that allow us to have succesful fishing while having a camp atmosphere that is condusive to having an enjoyable trip. My hat is off to BBL for taking a different approach and making it enjoyable and reasonably priced. After all $590 for a week incuding your meals (good food too) is a very good deal. Mike Kansas
