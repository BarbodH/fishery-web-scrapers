2198522,roscoe33,2013-11-02 17:33:00,653,"http://www.ourtownsylvania.com/Our-T...oat-crash.html She said alcohol was not considered to be a factor in the accident. They were looking for clues as to what caused the crash in Lake of the Woods in northwestern Ontario, about 130 miles east of Winnipeg, Manitoba, in which former Sylvania Mayor James Seney and Toledo native Robert Carmichael Foster, both 71, were killed. Mr. Foster was connected to some of the Toledo area's historically prominent families. Mr. Seney's daughter, Allison, said her father and Mr. Foster, of Frankfort, Mich., had made regular fishing trips to Canada and both took safety seriously. ""The driver [of the boat] was 62, so he wasn't a young reckless guy or anything,"" Ms. Seney said. ""All the guides, they go out on those waters every single day so it is the kind of thing that had to be a freak accident. My dad was very safe and Rob was like 'Mr. Safety' so they would not let anyone drive the boat who was intoxicated, but there are no details."" Constable Grosenick said Mr. Seney, Mr. Foster, and the guide were found onboard the boat by a passing fisherman. Mr. Seney and Mr. Foster were pronounced dead at the scene. Police were called about 8:30 p.m. Saturday, though it's not yet known what time the boat crashed. ""It's a big lake so the fellow who found them had to get to a phone because there's no cell service,"" the constable said. ""He had to go back to a local camp to make the call."" The guide, whose name was not released, did not have life-threatening injuries and was hospitalized in stable condition, Constable Grosenick said. He was employed by the fishing camp where the men had been staying, she said. ""The boat ran into [a rocky] shore. It didn't collide with another vessel; it ran into shore,"" she said. ""Whether the boat malfunctioned and the reason it ran into shore is still under investigation."" Read more at http://www.ourtownsylvania.com/Our-T...exdqoxxmjL8.99"
2195050,LOW1,2013-10-31 10:20:00,2828,Fortunately tragedies like this are not common. The guides I have seen and used have always been very cautious and safety-oriented. http://www.kenoradailyminerandnews.c...guide-deferred
2195978,kzoofisher,2013-10-31 18:49:00,5144,"Lots of questions about how such a tragedy could happen and zero information in that article. I would assume after the charges were changed that the prosecution doesn't have much of a case, are there any other details available? Couldn't find anything on the web other than that the accused is 64."
2195986,Obabikon,2013-10-31 18:57:00,2370,"Very sad, all around. Lakes are dangerous, no matter how experienced of an angler you are."
2196082,115 optimax,2013-10-31 20:44:00,650,"Ya,and I can just imagine how many boaters are booze cruising on top of that!LOTW is such a large body of water.I've fished it once and could not believe the amount of fast boats out there."
2196114,wallydave,2013-10-31 21:01:00,2151,"For most of my trips North I have been on the bow of the boat. Twice I have been at the back of the boat, the last time with my wife in the boat in June. Running the boat is a great responsibility! The safety of your boat is on you and nobody else. To have people in your care is something you can not take lightly!"
2197674,Obabikon,2013-11-01 21:25:00,2370,"Fished a different part than me. I fish all day, and see 3-4 boats most days (other than our camp's). All Canadian Shield lakes are dangerous for the rocks. Very few of them are different, if they allow large engines on the water."
2197874,Shellback,2013-11-02 06:11:00,8083,"Article said the guide crashed into a ""rock wall"". I wouldn't consider a rock wall a dangerous lake condition. More like the guide was irresponsible in his operation of the boat."
2197898,Obabikon,2013-11-02 06:21:00,2370,"A rock wall is, without a doubt, more dangerous than a beach, or mud shore line. I'm not sure what happened in this situation, but there are boaters out there (on all lakes) who accidentally doze off while they're driving. The difference is, you run into a rock wall on a shield lake, versus a bank on a mud lake. Neither is good, but rock lakes are dangerous."
2197938,v-bay gord,2013-11-02 06:44:00,3168,"I could be wrong, but I believe when I first heard this reported, it was said that the accident occurred at night. This might explain how you could mistakenly run into a rock wall."
2198026,Fisherman Ted,2013-11-02 07:36:00,461,"After the accident MNR paid visits to many if not all lodges in the area, one of which was mine. Their goal was to review safety procedures and ensure staff was being trained correctly in boat safety. After talking with the officer my understanding was that the boat did not go straight into the wall but rather jack-knifed right before the wall and sent the passengers hurtling into it."
