2180482,Bigsauger,2013-10-22 20:36:00,12,"I have really come to appreciate all of the advice and wisdom on WC over the years. Seems like a great group of people with lots of wonderful information.After going on trips with my dad, various friends, etc. over the past 20+ years it's time to start considering taking my 7 and 9 year old sons on their first trip north of the border.I've attempted to do some research on my own reading old posts but was curious if anyone had any first hand recommendations for me? I think I'm looking for a 5 day trip and will be driving up from Minneapolis. Obviously the shorter the drive the better but otherwise we are open to about anything although I think places that would offer some ""non-fishing"" activities might be helpful to break up the days.Any thoughts or insights would be appreciated!"
2180674,kzoofisher,2013-10-23 03:50:00,5144,"Sounds like you have a pretty solid idea of what you need already. Swimming and canoeing/kayaking are great adventures for kids, put a life jacket on 'em and keep 'em close to shore and they'll be having pirate adventures in no time. If the place has electricity keeping them away from electronics will be much tougher unless that stuff stayed in MN. We took electronics for the car ride (saved everyone's sanity) but since the batteries were all dead on arrival they weren't an issue during the week. I'd look for something like an outpost cabin that is a fairly short ride from the drive in. That's remote enough to be wilderness for kids instead of a Canadian Disney, but not so far that you have to worry about getting stuck. Oh, and teach them to play euchre, great game for rainy days and simple enough that they can ""beat"" Dad on enough tricks to really enjoy themselves. Don't know any specific lodges that meet these criteria in your neck of the woods but I'm sure there are some."
2180682,poultryman,2013-10-23 04:18:00,183,"""non-fishing activities""? You are setting yourself up for failure, my man. My philosophy is simple. Fish, or get out of the boat. My son was able to focus at 8 years old and pretty much maintain composure for the full day of fishing. He did stop fishing once in a while, but thats ok. Its hard work. Bring snacks, drinks. Get a guide. Bring good equipment. Nothing is worse than a finicky reel or mismatched gear that doesnt fish well for whatever you are fishing for. Good walleye rods are essential. Good musky or pike gear is essential. A buddy brought his brother with his kids. They had crappy walleye rods. They caught next to nothing. Couldnt feel a bite. My kids had decent rods that were very sensitive. Caught everything. That made it enjoyable for them and they were happy to go back out because they had confidence they could catch fish.The extra hands and eyes of the guide will pay huge dividends.As far as lodge recommendations, I would honestly not be swayed by any kind of trampoline or water slide or anything like that. Last trip, I saw the trampoline floating on the lake and it was covered in seagull crap. I have NOT stayed at these places but Ive seen good reviews of them and would try them myself. Id look at Stanleys on Eagle Lake. Or perhaps if you want to make it really an adventure, find a fly-in that has a very short flight. Halleys Camps have great fishing and excellent cabins out of Minaki."
2180730,Gary from Iowa,2013-10-23 05:31:00,74,"Where you go and what you look for is dependent on the children's experience with fishing and their ability to focus. For children that already like to fish and will focus; good tackle and a guide will greatly improve the trip. For children that are high energy and cannot focus too long on fishing, I suggest a camp or lodge with features such as a paddle boat, kayak, canoe or swimming raft in addition to fishing boats, motors or bait. My brother, two of his grandsons, ages 8 and 9 and I went fishing at Vermilion Bay Lodge in July. While it is a well run resort that meets the needs of a serious fisherman, it's also a great place for a couple of young brothers that like to use the paddle boat and kayak, and play with dogs at the camp and help bail out the boats in the morning and greet the returning fishermen and play in the sand and accompany the help and visit with all the guests and Gord and his wife. We took side trips for groceries and lunch and a museum in Dryden and side trips to eat in Vermilion Bay. We also visited Egli's Sheep Farm. Although I would have preferred more of a focus on fishing, you see how the kids react to an activity and adjust as you go along."
2180930,BornToFish,2013-10-23 07:14:00,1224,"Your intentions are very noble. It's great that you even consider taking your sons fishing with you a their young ages. The responses above offer some great suggestionsI took my wife's nephew on two fishing trips to NW Ontario. It was a learning experience. I offer some top-of-mind points for you to consider:1) Choose a lodge that has a family-friendly atmosphere. There are many such lodges to choose from. My point is that NOT all lodges have such an atmosphere.2) Assuming your wife (children's mother) is not traveling with you, make sure that you have a notarized letter from her giving you permission to take your children out of the United States and into Canada. We learned this lesson when my wife took our daughter out of country a few years ago. Without such a letter, you might not be allowed to enter Canada with your children. Our letter contains information about who we are, what dates our daughter would be out of country, where she would be in the foreign country, medical insurance information and such. We haven't had an issue since.3) Consider keeping your excursions on the lake somewhat shorter than you normally would without your children. Their attention spans aren't as well developed as your attention span. Walleye fishing was agonizing for my nephew.4) Intersperse finesse fishing (e.g. walleyes) with action fishing (e.g. casting for pike or perch). Youngsters seem to need movement/action from time to time.5) Consider taking along a football or baseball gloves to burn off some of their endless supply of energy.6) Your children's expectations regarding fishing success may not be quite as high as yours. Celebrate their 18 inch northern!7) Youngsters tend to want to be comfortable, e.g. avoiding getting up early, it's cold outside or I'm tired of being wet when it rains. You might have to back off on time on the water if you sense this becoming an issue.You and your sons will be creating memories together that will last a lifetime. Enjoy this moment in time together!"
2180994,Gary from Iowa,2013-10-23 07:46:00,74,"There are many good suggestions. Regarding the ""Permission Letter"", I drew one up for the parents to sign (before a notary) stating my brother and I could take the children for a specified period between the parent's residence to and from the resort and surrounding area. I also included a provision that we could seek needed medical, dental or vision care. We also had copies of the parents passport information. (Some templates suggest all parties, parents and adults taking the trip with the children also sign. And a copy of the state drivers license of the parents also be included.) I should mention both of the children had passports and that it was a close call on getting one of the passports in time because the authorities didn't accept the first photo with the application. Whether you need a full passport, or a passport card or just a birth certificate can be determined from reading various web sites. Since the parents anticipate future out of country travel, they got passports for all of the children-not just the two that traveled with my brother and I."
2204961,fisher_i_am,2013-11-05 19:21:00,498,"my two cents... my oldest is now 12 and has been going since 8.... he is a pro. this year I brought my whole family including 6 year boy, 10 year girl and my wife.... it was trip I will never forget and believe my family will not either... in fact it was unanimous to book for next year before we left... Key success factors... 1- candy in boat 2- allow napping in boat 3- fish in the morning, come in around noon for big lunch and time to swim or do what ever, then fish in the evening again. during the down time after lunch before we go out in the evening the kids can swim, tube, play games etc... We also have some cliffs to jump from and a rope swing they loved. 4- relax and have fun... you will be surprised how well they take to it."
2181002,LOW1,2013-10-23 07:47:00,2828,"With five kids and three or four trips per year I agree with all of the above.This place is about six hours from you and is worth considering: http://www.tomahawkresort.com/At least check out their webcam and online maps of the lake.And let the kids participate in the selection process so they can get a feel for what ads to be skeptical of, making a budget, etc Don't force the kids to do anything - let them find their own pace.Consider a day trip to Kenora for a movie or an indoor pool. The Farmer's Market on Wednesdays and the Lake of the Woods museum are worth checking out.You can teach them euchre if you want, but cribbage is a better game and will improve their math. (seriously) Kids under 16 need an original sealed birth certificate or a passport. Sixteen and above should have a passport.And bring along or find a place with a kayak - they are a lot of fun."
2193498,digjig,2013-10-30 14:25:00,146,"I have to throw Rainbow Point Lodge (rainbowpoint.com) into the mix for consideration. I have been going to various camps on Lac Seul for several years with 'the guys'. However, when the kids were 6 and 8 I wanted a lake were we could get back to camp in 20 minutes or less due to weather. Perrault Lake fit the bill at around 10,000 acres. Plenty of bays, islands and structure to fish. Rainbow Point Lodge has been our Canadian home away from home for a week per year over the last 5 years. We are already setup for year 6. The lodge is VERY family friendly. Bob and Gale are great owners, their staff are friendly and on top of everything. Last year was our best year yet on Perrault for walleye fishing. Pike and Perch can be caught almost at will. Plenty of Small-mouth too. Other than fishing there is hiking along Perrault Falls (right across the highway from RPL), they have 3 kayaks, a swimming platform with a slide, a playground, sand volley ball court, game room, horse shoes, ring toss, a store on-site and George (the dock manager, great guy) will occasionally take a group to the dump to watch wildlife an evening during the week. Last year we saw a bobcat, timber wolves and black bear in one night. Oh yeah, then there is the Tuesday night fish fry provided by Bob and Gale. Our kids always seem to find plenty of other kids to play 'tag' or 'kick the can' around camp in the evenings. RPL also has a family package which makes trip planning easy. Includes cabin, boat/motor/gas. No American plan, but the cabins are clean and have a bathroom with shower, stove/oven, microwave, coffee maker, refrig/freezer, dining room table, couch, etc. Like I mentioned earlier, we have our 2014 trip planned for the 3rd week in June. Hope to see you there. -DJ"
2193578,Duflebag,2013-10-30 14:51:00,218,I would recommend you take a look at Stanley's West Arm resort also. Rob and Chantal Wisneski run a family oriented camp. I know many of the camps in the Vermilion Bay area and Stanley's is the only camp that is really run for families. I am not affiliated in any way other than being a friend of the owners and their family. I go to another camp in the area. www.stanleys.com Here is the trip advisor page for Stanleyshttp://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserR...y_Ontario.html
2204353,Carnhzkr,2013-11-05 14:26:00,964,"My two boys were 7 & 10 the first time our family of four went north. I'd taken them both individually once prior, but this was the first time for the four of us as a family. We went to Wenasaga that trip, near Ear Falls. It was a good choice for the kids. It's a smaller lake, so we were never far from the cabin. There's a spectacular waterfall coming in to the river that feeds the lake. Kids (and adults) have a great time walking the portage up the falls and throwing lures into the pools. There's a smaller falls that exits the lake too. We made a point of picnicking at both. I'm looking at a picture of the two of them at the falls sitting on my desk as I type this. They have several other drive-to lakes with boat caches. We did a couple of them. Some are packed with northerns - the kids love that fast action. When my boys were young like that, I had always picked a day that looked like rain and went into the nearest town for ice cream or pizza or whatever to break up the week. With smaller boats, I always let my kids man the tiller once we'd get out in open water, with me standing at the ready. They love that.Here's another fun diversion you might look into for either the trip up or back. Check out the underground mine in Soudan, MN. It's about 20 miles off Hwy 53. You take an elevator about 1/2 mile down and a tour guide takes you through the mine. I also took one of my boys on a tour of the paper mill in International Falls one year. He thought that was the highlight of his trip - and it's free."
