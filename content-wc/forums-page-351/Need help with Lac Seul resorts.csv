Other good resorts located on Lac Seul, 15 minutes South of Ear Falls are: Lac Seul Lodge Fisherman's Cove Onaway Lodge Last two are Located on protected Scout bay with good fishing close by in case it's windy & it's a short boat ride to Bay of Islands, McKenzie Bay & South Bay. Good luck, planning is half the fun. Check into availability early since several of these resorts have high return customers so availability can be limited. RBF"
2226090,Steve of Madison,2013-11-18 20:27:00,230,"Second that recommendation by ""Rather"" either Onaway or Fisherman's Cove would be my suggestions. But don't wait to make contact or make your reservations. Both get a lot and I mean lots of repeat customers every year and it may be difficult to get in, don't wait for show season either, because you will not find either of them at the shows. With the repeat business they don't need to go to the shows. Now for why I recommend Onaway.......the nicest cabins, most are new, the BEST docking facility and fish house, and the best equipment on the lake. Then there's the location on the lake, within an easy boat ride to McKenzie, Steamboat, South bay, South Islet, Manitoba pt and beyond. If you can't find fish in all of those areas you need to find a new hobby, or take up golf. Good luck BTW, check out the video on Onaway's website, in the pictures there is my grandson and 90 yr old uncle."
2226834,Fishin Fun,2013-11-19 08:38:00,218,Thanks for all the information guys. We will probably only have 4 guys with us and our own boat. We usually bring our own food and cook our own fish nightly. So we are pretty low maintenance. Just need a resort that knows the lake and is willing to offer advice on where and how to fish it and has bait available.
2227162,2746,2013-11-19 11:55:00,3206,"We have fished out of Lac Seul Lodge, Fishermans Cove and Onaway. All are located close to the areas we like to fish and, if your a first time Lac Seul fisherman, are the places I would try for starters. Onaway is a Friday to Friday lodge which may or may not fit your groups schedule. We have settled on Lac Seul Lodge due to location but that's a personal choice. All three will meet your needs. Btw, we also made the move from Gullrock a few years back....and have found the fishing in Lac Seul to be just as good but with less crowding due to the larger body of water. Good luck!"
2227978,Hump,2013-11-19 20:37:00,578,We enjoy Evergreen. Great boats/ nice cabins. we find plenty of good fishing nearby. Why are you leaving Gull rock. We did 9 years ago and haven't regretted it.
2228034,Guest,2013-11-19 20:47:00,0,"Williams Lake Lodge has improved each of the last 5 years, boats and motors, cabins, fish cleaning house. It is a lodge that has everything any fisherman needs."
2225410,Fishin Fun,2013-11-18 15:48:00,218,Looking at the possibility of changing lakes for next year and trying Lac Seul instead of Gull Rock. I was wondering if any of you could suggest a resort? Thanks!
2225418,BreezyPoint,2013-11-18 15:49:00,1581,Try Goose bay Camp. Great rates and great fishing!Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk HD
2225426,scgibby11,2013-11-18 15:49:00,109,We like Timberlane lodge on the English river.
2225458,dane56,2013-11-18 16:01:00,18,"I have stayed at Goose Bay twice. It's an Ok camp but I would get her price quote in writing. Last year she changed the price between when I booked and when I paid. I asked her what her policy was and she said she didn't have any policy. Her website never got updated last year either, so if you look at that, make sure it is for 2014. She is the cheapest resort that I have found on the north end of Lac Seul. The biggest downside is that Goose Bay is a long way from the ""good fishing."" We boat to Mackenzie Bay most days, but that is about 18 miles by boat and can get pretty dicey if it is windy. Great Walleye lake!"
2225498,BreezyPoint,2013-11-18 16:26:00,1581,"I have to differ with you on a long way from good fishing. When I was there last August, everyone was heading to MacKenzie Bay. We went there one day, but to be honest with you we caught on ton of fish within sight of the camp. I also talked to a bear hunter who didn't understand why everyone was traveling so far to fish. He caught all of his fish right in the bay. It may not be quite as fast to find the fish, but when you work it, they are right there.Also, most resorts raise their rates the first of the year. This is common practice and if you book before that, you should expect a possible rate increase.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk HD"
2225506,Guest,2013-11-18 16:29:00,0,Go over to Goldpines. It's just at the end of the road from Evergreen Lodge. Peter and Christa run an excellent camp. They have everything you need from small 2 person cabins to large 8 or 10 person buildings. Prices are very competitive. Been going there the last 8 years. Just make your reservation early.

She has lived there most of her life,she can put you on the fish, she also responds to email, so you can get answers to your questions. One plus is she has a daily rate, if you need to leave early. Good luck!"
2225890,skindzier,2013-11-18 19:07:00,137,"I'll 2nd Timberlane. Great folks. Been there 3 or four times. Sometimes you can catch 20"" plusfish right off the dock in the evenings. Lotta fun when you get a bunch of people hootin' & hollerin' (but bring your bug spray!)"
2226002,thunder1,2013-11-18 19:42:00,27,Gold Pines cant be beat. Been going there for 20yrs. Plenty of fish close or far. Excellent owners and camp
