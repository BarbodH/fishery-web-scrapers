6328720,kcguy68,2019-06-06 12:44:00,51,"I apologize up front for posting in ""Walleye"" Central. However, I feel like this group has a lot of very good, seasoned fisherman that might be willing to provide some advise in regards to catching Pike. We typically head up to Eagle Lake Ontario to fish the first week of August. Most years the fishing is really good, and we always seem to have a good amount of luck with the walleye. However, from time to time, we do like to go after Pike. It seems like most of the Pike we catch, tend to be on the small side, and occasionally we will land a few in the 35-40"" range. For those of you who like to go after pike from time to time, what suggestions would you offer that would improve the numbers of bigger fish? Seems like we are typically working shore lines (casting), but after years of doing this, I think the bigger boys are more than likely deeper. Any advise is appreciated. I always enjoy the commentary on the message board. Thanks in advance."
6328748,That Minnesota guy,2019-06-06 15:19:00,8293,I would troll points and humps adjacent to deep water. I use big spoons and like to rip them and let them flutter down on the backside of points.
6328788,BreezyPoint,2019-06-06 17:10:00,1581,"I think this is correct. Big pike are cool water fish and can go quite deep. Also be on the lookout for cloudy, cool days. They will often come shallow into weeds to feed under those conditions.Frank"
6328820,That Minnesota guy,2019-06-06 18:03:00,8293,Another thing for the OP. I will seldom if ever use rod holders if i'm hunting big fish. I also try to do a overhead hookset vs a sweep. I believe the overhead has a better chance of driving the hooks into the roof of the mouth. I always leave the boat in gear and moving forward until i've set the hook several times. Only then will I reach back and kick the motor into neutral while keeping the rod tip straight up. With a big heavy spoon you have to always maintain the pressure or they will do a head shake and it's game over. They will throw the hook. As always you will get different opinions here on how to do it but thats what works for me. Frank we will put it to the test in a week or so!
6328940,adempsey2.0,2019-06-07 07:09:00,611,"Some grest advice already given. Some gear suggestions - The Len Thompson No.16 Dimpled and No.4 Originals work for me. The XXL Pelican Spoons and Yellowbird Doctor and Papa Docs are solid choices. I also like big swimbaits like the Savage Gear 4Play and Line-Thru series. ""Smaller"" musky cranks good too - Live Target Sucker and Joe Bucher Depth Raiders come to mind. Bulldawgs can be killer too. Spoons are always the easiest to work with though.Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk"
6328948,rkc118,2019-06-07 07:45:00,15,"if you have access to a depth map, study it before you go. A lot of the bigger pike i have seen caught have come on the following pattern. Find a shallow but narrow weedbed on a shoreline or small cove that is very close to deep water. in other words, a very short swim for a big pike from the bottom of a deep hole to a warm, sunny place. cast a small spinner all they way to the shoreline, less than a foot of water. not claiming i am the ""inventor"" of this idea, but I've never seen it explained anywhere before, and it might not even be true, but... my hypothesis is that the big females that spend the summer deep will come up to those areas after a meal because the water temp is much higher there and it helps them to digest the big meal they just had quicker. they strike the small bait in a reactionary fashion, a small treat for dessert, so to speak. i've always released these fish, so i have no way of knowing if they have a big meal in their belly or not, just a hunch i suppose. otherwise, i agree with other's posts here, when you are trolling, don't put the rod in the rod holder, hold on to it and use a jerkbait technique. again, i have no proof, but i think that they start following the bait (say a countdown rapala, hot n tot, rat l trap, etc) and are swimming along with it deciding to strike or not. when you jerk it forward, it speeds up, they speed up, you quickly move the rod tip to the back of the boat and the lure basically come to a stop with the fish accelerating at it, they have no choice but to strike. we catch walleye this way as well. make sure to post pics of the big 'uns you catch!"
6328976,MrSimon,2019-06-07 08:36:00,922,"I agree, small spinners in and around weeds can be a VERY effective summer pike pattern. A lot of the northern lakes stay cool enough all year that the big pike will still cruise shallow weed beds in the summer. Maybe not all day, but they definitely come up from time to time."
6328982,BornToFish,2019-06-07 08:51:00,1224,"Greetings,There are already many great suggestions on this thread!I was getting frustrated about ten years ago when I was casting for northern pike over weeds and weed edges during August. I was catching many small to eater size pike, and rarely anything bigger than that. I decided to switch things up and tried casting for pike near mid-lake rock humps. That was an eye-opening experience!As BreezyPoint already mentioned, northern pike (especially bigger pike) are cool-water creatures. They often leave shorelines in mid-June when the lake's thermocline begins to set up. I believe they cruise this thermocline until they run into a piece of structure, such as a rock hump or point/reef. The pike will stay near these structural elements, just above the thermocline and move deeper with it as the season progresses.One of my favorite patterns during August has been getting upwind of an off-shore rock hump about three cast lengths. I then drift towards the rock hump as I cast any big profile lure. I want the lure to get down about 8-10 feet in the water column - about one-half of the way to the thermocline. I keep fan-casting until I am about three cast lengths down wind of the rock hump. Most of my strikes come on the upwind side of the hump, with the fish being in at least about twenty feet of water.Most any big profile lure works so long as it gets down 8-10 in the water column. The pike see it silhouetted against the surface and come unglued. The strikes can be savage T-bone affairs, or can be subtle ticks when the fish overtakes the lure from behind. My best action often comes in the middle of the day. I might drift a hump and get nothing, and then come back to it two hours later and catch five.I believe that the biggest pike in the system often leverage this pattern. Little pike know better than to hang around these humps. I'm referring to the same rock humps that guys are using to target walleyes. Rock humps that have access to deep water (e.g. 30-50 fow) seem to be better.The lakes that I am now fishing haven't established a true thermocline from what I can tell. Bigger pike do frequent the off-shore rock humps, but maybe not in the numbers that I have seen in lakes that do establish a thermocline.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6329002,jsmyers,2019-06-07 10:21:00,198,"I haven't fished NWO at that time in decades, but I can confirm that we caught very few fish over 28"" inches fishing visible weedbeds at that time.I realize the answer to my question is in there (""most any big profile lure""), but I'm curious what types of lures you've had success with? How big is big? What kinds of retrieves work? Do you want something that dives and moves fast, or is a semi-vertical lift and drop spoon or jig retrieve an option?I don't have any experience with this pattern, but I suspect that it might also work earlier in the late spring/early summer time when weeds are minimal but the very early shallow pattern ends."
6329064,jsmyers,2019-06-07 14:42:00,198,"I wonder how a ~2 oz jig with a ~6"" swimbait would do? Or a 2 oz spoon (I'm thinking Huskie Jr, Devle Dog Gaint, or Cop-E-Cat) I also have a couple of there 3+ oz counterparts."
6329070,Ricky Spanish,2019-06-07 15:04:00,1298,"Some of my biggest pike from Eagle Lake have been incidental catches on a jig and minnow over rock humps, or while trolling Jakes or Grandmas in perch or sucker patterns. My wife's biggest came trolling a Top Raider."
6329080,BornToFish,2019-06-07 15:48:00,1224,"Greetings, I apologize for the error in my earlier post. In the first line, the word ""willing"" should have been ""unwilling"". I'm unable to fix the earlier post as I timed out the window for making corrections. I'm thinking that the jig/plastic or large size spoons should work well for JSMeyers. As I mentioned earlier, just keep it about ten feet down in the water, which is roughly one-half of the way to the thermocline (August/September timeframe). The jig/plastic and large spoons should have a big enough profile to be silhouetted against the surface of the lake. Don't give up on this pattern too soon. Give it some time. I often struck out making a few drifts, and then came back two hours later to catch several from the same rock hump. Hang on tight! Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6329370,Mojo-NC,2019-06-09 07:22:00,1929,"Lots of good information and advice here. Keep in mind that it isn't always the latest and greatest pike lures that catch the big ones. Last year was a pretty good year for big pike in my group. All but one of the bigguns came from using old school lures and techniques. My buddy and I decided to fish for pike one day - he threw an old school walleye crankbait and I threw a Doctor pike spoon. I caught a walleye on my spoon and he caught a 40+ish"" pike on his walleye crankbait. Another brute a little later that same day came off of a butterfly blade slow death spinner rig. Both fish were several inches longer than any measuring tape that we had available, we had no scale in the boat that day, and neither of us had our phones or a camera with us. Go figure. He caught his two personal best pike ever and the only record of the event are the memories that he and I will both likely have forever. Of course, when he tells the story the pike are much larger than when I tell it. A youngun from our group caught a monster on an old J-Plug that he got out of his grandfather's tackle box. Another guy caught a brute ripping a large 4"" saltwater rattle trap over deep water structure. Don't be afraid to be creative and present something a little different from what has been presented in the months prior to your arrival. The other guys in this post have already indicated where to look for them. Go to those spots and try a little bit of whatever feels good at the moment. It might just pay off nicely."
6329406,BornToFish,2019-06-09 08:42:00,1224,"Greetings, I concur with Mojo's preceding comment. I am quite confident that getting to the rock hump (point, reef or whatever), and getting my lure about one-half way down to the thermocline are the key aspects of this presentation. I don't overthink the choice of lures or chase ""fad"" lures. I tend to choose big profile lures that are easily silhouetted against the surface of the lake. Most of these lures do not look like anything that the pike routinely see in their environment. They are just big, slow moving targets that are not paying attention to what is underneath them. I strongly suspect that many of my strikes happen simply because the lure pi$$es off the pike. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6331178,reconssd,2019-06-14 18:24:00,147,"Just some food for thought when it comes to big pike or even muskie in August. Mojo and Born to fish are totally on point. I have fished lake Michigan for decades. A few years back, I brought up a dipsy diver rod/reel and dodger/salt water squid combo's along with big tiger pattern J-plugs. Have your reel lined with 100# power pro. The beauty with dipsy divers is that you can set them at any depth. You can also run anything behind a dipsy from a grandma bait, to a cowgirl, to big plastics, deep diving baits, etc. The sky is the limit with your choice combinations for running lures. The one thing I would recommend is that you don't hold on to the rod while trolling dipsy's. You will want a rod holder, and when fish hit the lure, the fish sets the hook. I have hammered big pike and musky with this presentation. It's also important to have electronics in the boat so you can watch your depth otherwise, you could bury a dipsy in the bottom of the lake, or a rock shelf. You can run at any speed, and any depth, depending on what you are trolling. Speed up, slow down, or even stop, and you will pop fish. J-plugs drive big pike crazy because of their erratic trolling pattern. J-plugs move all over the place, not to mention the rattle, and fish go nuts. I have caught walleye, northern, and muskie on this presentation. I know its another rod/reel combo to bring to Canada, but it will put big fish in the boat. Dipsy's are more convenient than down riggers, and they will get your presentation into the strike zone. The other must have component to this presentation is what's called a shock absorb-er. This is attached to the dipsy diver. When the fish hits, this shock absorb-er takes the impact so the line doesn't break. There is a heavy duty braided line in the shock absorb-er that doesn't allow for your lure to be lost. So in the heat of August, you may want to give this a try. Good luck and tight lines."
6329032,BornToFish,2019-06-07 13:02:00,1224,"Greetings, I chose not to mention what lures I use when fishing the summer/autumn rock pattern for northern pike. Not because I am willing to share, but rather many folks are not able to successfully fish the pattern. However, I will share the information since JSMyers asked. I use my musky fishing equipment. I'm referring to musky rods, musky reels and musky-sized lures. My favorite lure is the Musky Innovations Regular (standard) size Bull Dawg. This lure tips the scale at a hefty 4.9 ounces. I use a musky rated Heavy or Extra Heavy casting rod with a 300 series musky reel and 80 pound braided line. This lure has destroyed many standard casting rods and casting reels that guys might use for bass. I have also used musky crankbaits such as the Bucher Depth Raider or the Triple D. These also work well. Northern pike that T-bone the lure will almost always turn the Bull Dawg into chopped meat. These lures are expensive! Thus, I have tried all kinds of techniques to repair the lure, just to keep it going. I have used zip ties, mini torches and several different adhesives to keep them going for just one more fish. Another aspect of my reluctance to mention the techniques is that hook removal can be extremely difficult. Many pike will swim up to the Bull Dawg to overtake the lure from behind. This often means that the massive lure and leader will be entirely within the mouth of the fish. There are seven hooks to a Bull Dawg. Thus, this technique is best left to anglers that have the know-how, confidence and tools to remove deeply embedded hooks. I often cut the hooks with a Knipex hook cutter, removed shrapnel and then installed new hooks on the Bull Dawg. Anglers everywhere want to catch lots of BIG fish. When they do, the question often becomes ""and what do I do now"" when they are dealing with angry fish. My goal is to release the fish unharmed. Not everyone can deal with these situations. The northern pike will be cruising just above the thermocline. This means they will be around 20-22 feet down in the water column in August. The lure simply needs to get down 8-10 feet in the water column (ca. half way down to the thermocline) and have a big profile, so that the northern pike will see the silhouette against the surface of the lake. One kick of the tail and they will come up to grab the lure. I impart relatively little of action to the lure. I count it down 8-10 feet and then crank it back to the boat. I might do a little lift/drop or make short pauses. It's really pretty simple. Remember: this technique is targeting the biggest northern pike in the body of water. These fish are very special and need to be treated with care to ensure their survival when released. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
