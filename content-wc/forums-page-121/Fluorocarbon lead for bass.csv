6332538,Mojo-NC,2019-06-19 08:02:00,1929,I just allow the toothy critters to chomp off my plastics. I just tie on a new one as they're not expensive and it's likely time to change out my baits anyway. I generally use 12# P-Line Floroclear. I got PO'd about losing 3 expensive spinnerbaits in one day so I went ahead and tied directly to my 20# braid and haven't had a repeat since. It doesn't seem to affect the bite. Someone here on WC recommended TUF-LINE braided stainless steel leader and I purchased some but haven't used it yet. It says on the package it ties like mono. I really bought it for my Canada trip in September. A 5 yard spool of 20# is about $8.

6332638,Pezman38,2019-06-19 13:04:00,3196,I like Seaguar red label in 15-20lb test for bass flipping. Makes a great leader for walleye harnesses as well.
6332660,troutwater,2019-06-19 14:26:00,299,Thanks for the suggestions. I was hoping to hit up Cabela's in the next few days for some.
6332766,troutwater,2019-06-20 05:27:00,299,Ended up getting some Red Label as they were out of about half their stuff.
