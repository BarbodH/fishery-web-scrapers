Heading up for our first trip to wine lake camp over the Labor Day week this year and are super exited to have more time to spend on the fishery. I had a couple questions on some of the amenities and do's/dont's when staying at the camp. We are used to a camp with full electricity, on site fish cookers, gas grills, and full kitchens, so that may the biggest change to get used to. I just don't want to bring any unnecessary items if they are already available in camp. If anyone has any pointers/tips on what has made their stay in camp easier, I would appreciate any help from the folks who have stayed at WLC before. I have a whole bunch of questions and don't really want to get too in depth, but if anyone is willing to have a private conversation I would appreciate it Thanks!!!"

I don't know that I'd be a big help compared to some of the folks that stay their yearly.I do hope to get back next year. It is a wonderful place.I would recommend doing a trip up the Anishinabi if you like smallmouth with some pike mixed in. Our group sent folks up there two days in a row. The bass bite in Halvorsen and the north-most basin of Anishinabi was crazy. A lot of good sized pike where mixed in too.We did great along the shorelines with a rattling lipless crankbait, especially where the wind was blowing toward shore."
