6329802,fishin10,2019-06-10 16:40:00,2315,Very Cool...Has to be the boots!
6329820,Potatoe,2019-06-10 18:16:00,164,Awesome
6329834,kzoofisher,2019-06-10 19:00:00,5144,Fantastic video and great job by Dad. Where do I get some boots like those? I'll bet PJShorthorn has a pair.
6329842,kettyspanky,2019-06-10 19:16:00,271,Very nice fish. Glad to see the little kids having fun and good luck.
6329850,grizzley,2019-06-10 19:44:00,2518,", It's been brought up many times, good for the little guy!"
6329862,Slim03,2019-06-10 20:59:00,159,Thatâ€™s awesome for the little guy. We take a Disney Princess pole on our trip every year. Was brought along as a joke but sheâ€™s rigged with 30lb braid now and catches some impressive fish every year.
6329868,pjshorthorn,2019-06-10 21:11:00,5654,Dang straight I do. I have the fishing rod to match as well. Any fisherman worth a boot full of minnows has a pair like that. ðŸ˜Ž PjShorthorn
6329990,Mojo-NC,2019-06-11 08:05:00,1929,Our group brings a Disney Princess rod each year for a competition as well. We take turns and see who catches the largest walleye. It's a lot of fun.
