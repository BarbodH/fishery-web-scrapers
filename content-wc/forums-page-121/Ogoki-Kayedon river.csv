The rest of the week was spent dodging wild cold fronts. Fishing was up and down with the weather. Bite improved as the water warmed. Late ice went out 5/24 ish with cool weather preceding our week. We stayed with Boreal Forest Outfitters at Kayedon camp. Camp has seen significant improvements: solar fridge replacing old clunker, solar electric recharge batteries etc. New roof, siding were nice additions but never a factor in the past. We visit every other year. Fishing was good, bite picked up as I mentioned during the week. Walleyes are nice heavy bodied averaging 18 ish with some bites unable to find an under. I caught a dozen last hour of fishing buddy landed handful with one under an rest over. I took home one fish. Best was 26 with lots of low twenties. Warden visited doing his job and hammered us on having too many over fish. 6 of us had 6 overs in the fridge an two shorts. He was measuring filleted fish found in the bucket on the dock. We found out skin grows up too 1/4 inch post fillet. Check it out fillet a walleye and measure the remains before and after, we found up to 1/4 inch increase. I suggest keeping nothing over 17.5 Warden still could not find a seventh fish over 18.1 despite a serious tantrum. Might be a good nickname - Tantrum. He confiscated a improperly frozen fish that was coated with an inch of water. Fillet had walleye skin on it but warden felt he needed supper an refused to let us defrost the fillet. My brother was off fishing an avoided the fine. We discuss fish kept, frozen at least twice a day and never had more than 6 fish in camp until last day in camp. Pike were behind last trip with one trophy a 41+ and much fewer mid thirty inch fish. We also noticed surge of sauger. A couple evening bites we caught more saugers than walleyes. I ventured down Speckled Trout rapids on the lower Ogoki rock hopping down the beautiful river cleaning out pike after pike with no luck on the specks. I had a fantastic day quite beautiful spot. I caught a walleye on a Mepps #3 aglia silver blade a treat. Ogoki river is already seasonally low. We banged a few rocks and hope they release some water soon."

Sue and Jason talked about putting one in at their Mellchett camp do you know if they did. The Kayedon camp looks good with the new improvements. Sue and Jason are doing a great job going all out to improve their 2 camps. I hope new motors at mellchett are coming soon. We are headed into Melchett as usual on Aug 9th. Thanks for the report Halfmoon

I don't know about Melchett but party that left Friday morning hammered them. Melchett definitely fished better than Ogoki last week."
