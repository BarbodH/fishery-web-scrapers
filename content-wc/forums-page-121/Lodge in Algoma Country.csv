6331558,ElectricSlide19,2019-06-16 14:28:00,147,Thank you for the suggestions I will be checking them out as well!
6329430,ElectricSlide19,2019-06-09 10:44:00,147,"Hi all, looking for suggestions for lodges in the Algoma district. Will be coming from Kalamazoo, Michigan through Sault St. Marie in September and was looking for a drive or boat in destination anywhere from Nakina to Wawa. We can bring our own tub or use camp boats, no preference. Don’t necessarily need size, numbers would be great and then at least one more species to target whether it be pike, bass, etc. I have done some research and searches on here, was looking at Lower Twin Lakes lodge but that’s all I have really found. Some of the searches only bring up content from 2002 so I’m looking for some fresh info! Thanks all!"
6329512,kzoofisher,2019-06-09 17:29:00,5144,"Check out Happy Day Lodge and their other camp Prairie Bee. Both have bass, walleye and pike. HD heavier on the eyes PB heavier on the bass. Some threads here if you search those names or Windermere. It's an 11 hour drive from here if you don't go hard. I've made it in under 10 if I pack food."
6329522,ElectricSlide19,2019-06-09 17:56:00,147,Thanks Kzoo! Did y’all bring your own tub or did you use the boats supplied by camp? Would you say the lake is more numbers based for eyes? Any decent size? I will be shooting them an email shortly as they were on my list from a quick google search!
6329534,Mike Borger,2019-06-09 18:38:00,1554,"Here's two good ones:1.O'Sullivan's Rainbow north of Nakina. Either their main lodge, or the water access cabin on Dunn Island. Have heard nothing but great things about it. A number of WC regulars fish it so hopefully they'll chime in. Bring your own boat if you want (a bigger boat is nice if you have one), or use the camp boats. Fantastic walleye lake along with pike and lakers. Lots of water to fish and explore. By all accounts it's pretty close to fly in fishing quality but much more affordable.The challenge is finding an opening because they're always booked.http://www.osullivansrainbow.com/2. Ontario North Fishing Adventures in Oba on the now defunct ACR rail line. Accessible by gravel road south of hwy 11 just west of Hearst.AMAZING cabin with amenities more like a private cottage. Larger boats with 25's. Cabin is on the Oba River which has direct access into Cameron Lake to the east. Cameron is the attraction here. It's very remote with excellent walleye and pike fishing. I believe there's a fly in outfitter that operates an outpost on Cameron, but that's it.Very reasonably priced, and no, it's not a good idea to trailer your own boat here.https://ontarionorthfishing.com/"
6329546,kzoofisher,2019-06-09 19:20:00,5144,"Windermere is more numbers than size, mostly 15""-20"". We probably average 4-6 fish per hour per rod jigging. Not crazy action but steady when you find fish and you do have to find them. Tons of good looking structure but the spot on the spot makes all the difference. Basically, if we set down somewhere and don't pull a fish in a few minutes we move. Just a few feet if we marked them coming in, further if we didn't. I would say the fishing isn't as good as the Nakina area, we had a great trip to PercyLake last year, but it's considerably closer and cheaper. Since I'm footing the bill for a couple people that makes a difference. Haven't fished PB but I hear it has a lot of smallies. We've done both, taken our own boats and rented. The rentals are alright, underpowered imo and the sonar on them is very bare bones. I fish the west side and don't have waypoints for the east but can share some for as far east as Nicholson. A few other regulars here have fished it as well and may offer some tips."
6329550,Bowline,2019-06-09 19:48:00,8,Not too much farther down the road is Pasha Lake Cabins. Adventure fishing at its finest. If you bring your own boat you could explore lake nipigon. Chad runs a beautiful resort with excellent fishing.
6331500,ElectricSlide19,2019-06-16 10:53:00,147,"So I looked into some suggestions that y’all gave, lower twin and Happy days were both booked solid for that week. I have yet to contact rainbow yet. Any other suggestions? Thanks!"
6331516,Namegosikaa,2019-06-16 12:23:00,61,"Seven lakes runs the other lodge on lower twin called walleye cove, O'Sullivan lake outfitters is the other option on O'Sullivan. Kenogamis is a excellent lake in geraldton with a few lodging options as well, klotz lake camp and flint river resort are on the way as well."
6331526,adempsey2.0,2019-06-16 12:49:00,611,O'Sullivans is likely booked solid as well. Getting into either Happy Day or O'Sullivans is not easy since they have a lot of repeat guests.Some possibilities:https://www.fivemilelake.com/chapleauoutpostcamps.htmhttps://duseyriveradventures.com/hanover-lakehttps://namegosikaaoutfitters.com/outpost-camps/http://www.pennocksnakina.com/index.php/accomodationshttps://wildgooselake.com/http://www.air-dale.com/https://www.murraylake.net/https://normandy-lodge.com/https://www.northernwoodslodge.com/Several listed in this directory as well:http://www.greenstone.ca/content/gre...tters-charters
