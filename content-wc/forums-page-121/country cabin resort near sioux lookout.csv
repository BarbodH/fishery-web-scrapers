6330904,Sniper1980,2019-06-13 18:51:00,33,"Been staying at Judy’s place for 15 consecutive years now. Great place, great location and cannot best the price. Super clean fish house etc. Big V is great for trout, bass Muskie and northern. No walleyes in the lakeLost lake launch is just over three miles down the road towards Hudson. Using her rental boat with the 25 Honda on it will be more then adequate for you. Plenty of great fishing within short distance from launch. Would be Happy to share more if interested"
6331394,Guest,2019-06-15 17:53:00,0,"dear sir thanks for the information on the resort;can one fisherman realistically catch 20 walleyes /day at lost lake?? is lost lake connected to lac seul?? have you fished little vermillion 8 lake chain is worth going there ?? does big vermillion have huge northerns 30"" + ??? owner claims camp can be transferred to lost lake etc for no charge ?? have made 40 trips to canada since the mid 60""s just came back from last resort on english river chain about 1 hr north of kenora had a good trip caught our limits biggest walleye 25 1/2"" northern 33 1/2"" if you want to call me 9542054808 or email [email protected] appreciate it thanks again jim wolf chicago boys"
6331518,x4flatfish,2019-06-16 12:26:00,319,"If you can't catch 20 walleye a day a lost lake, you don't have your line in the water. So yes you can. Lost Lake is part of Lac Seul. Big V has Muskie and Northern. For size you may do better in Lac Seul. We typically catch northern 36"" and up, by accident, while walleye fishing Lac Seul. However Big V does have some big fish as well. Be advised that you cannot use live bait on Big V and I believe Little V is catch and release only. Someone here can correct me if I am wrong about that. Have never fished Little V so can't answer those questions. Also do not know about Country Cabins resort. We stay at River's Edge Outfitters just down the road from CCR. All new cabins and excellent rates."
6331530,Sniper1980,2019-06-16 12:59:00,33,"Used to stay at timbers edge when it was called big vermilion lodge. Owns by ‘jim’Judy’s place is great, secluded from the road and can’t beat the price. Little vermilion is catch and release for lake trout. Another correction to above post is big vermilion is artificial lures only. Big difference from live bait. So remember that when venturing out on big vermilion Here’s some catches from our trip last week on big vermilion 50+” Muskie, 26.5” laker, 18” smallie"
6331546,Sniper1980,2019-06-16 14:05:00,33,Artificial lures only on big vermilion
6331676,x4flatfish,2019-06-16 21:54:00,319,Read my post again...live bait CANNOT be used on Big V.... Just wanted to clarify....
6331678,Sniper1980,2019-06-16 21:59:00,33,Again. Check the specialRefs for big Vermilion Lake. Clearly states artificial lures only

6332630,wooglin,2019-06-19 12:50:00,371,"Stayed there from 2003-2006, loved every minute of it. Judy ran it then and still runs it now. At that time, there were camp sites with water/electric where we could get in and out, 7 days, for less than $100 per person. the camp is pretty nice, it's incredibly nice considering the price. Shower house and fish house always got it done for us, we were very happy with Country Camping (and I'll go back, sometime).That said, if you're into smallies, musky and lakers - Vermillion is your lake. But, don't count on those fish just jumping into your boat, you'll have to find them and their patterns.Lost Lake (Lac Seul) is not that far away, and you can find fish immediately. We'd go all the way west to Websters Bay (fish around the bridge, and the point to the north as you get to the bridge), and all the way East to Italian bay and Deception. Great for walleye and pike. Never saw a musky in the time we were there, but they are in there.Best of luck!PS, a pike one of my guys caught up there, still is in the pic rotation on Judy's website! (Lilly Lake, under the train bridge)"
