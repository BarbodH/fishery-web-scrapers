Looking at maybe switching outfitters just to find some new water so we don't have to repeat lakes. The web page doesn't have a lot if info on the lakes, so thought I would hit the knowledge base of all you guys.Cheers!"
6324508,UPnorth3,2019-05-24 06:19:00,22,"We have used Air Ivanhoe for several trips. Each time we meet others in the lodge who have been using the outfitter for 10+ years. We have fished Resound once, and Forearm/Hardiman 4 times. I would not recommend Resound. Resound has pike, walleye, and bass. Resound is a small lake, and Ivanhoe actually shuts it down after a certain number of people visit each year. Our group really likes forearm/hardiman. The cabin sits on forearm, but you will spend most of your time fishing Hardiman. The small portage is about the only downside. Both lakes contain smallmouth and pike. Caught a 40"" pike out of each lake before. Hardiman has some VERY nice smallmouth fishing. Heard reports forearm may even hold a small population of walleye. Air Ivanhoe is a great family outfitter. Never had any issues with the cabin or equipment provided. The only other negative is not knowing when you are going to be flown out. It could be 10am or 3pm. That and we just decided to focus on walleye for our next trip. If you decide on either of these lakes, PM me and I would be happy to help. Good luck"

With that said and comparing the accommodations to 2 other fly-in outfitters, Air Ivanhoe blows them away...... the fishing was good at Nemegosenda but not what you would expect for a fly-in trip but good enough for a fun trip. George IMHO runs a FIRST CLASS operation, including the accommodations you can book for the day before you fly in to your lake (I recommend doing this). I also fished PEBONISHEWI SOUTH back when Dick at Gogama ran it INTO THE GROUND.....it was a shiphole cabin but the walleye fishing was very good. I was glad to see George took over this lake and made improvements. Here is some info that I think you are looking for on all of Ivanhoe's lakes......https://www.airivanhoe.com/wp-conten...e_Brochure.pdf Bob"
6324772,dosxx,2019-05-24 14:23:00,60,"Our group flew many years with Air Ivanhoe. We did multiple trips to Paul Lake which has a walk to Pike lake (Raff Lake maybe) a couple of portage lakes, one had boats and motors a a couples had canoes. We always had a ball and caught plenty of pike and walleye using 1/4 ounce jigs and grubs and casting the old Bill Lewis Rattle Traps.One thing I recall was that the cabin really got hot and stayed hot in July. It was actually my first Canada adventure more than 25 years ago with the same group that I go with now.We also fished Mconnel Lake and did not do that great (it was cold and rainy) but it was still fun!We were always pleased with Air Ivanhoe all around. We would always stay the night before and have steak and some prime Canadian beverages, a tradition we still carry on. And I have no idea if they still do it but we used to have the Aviator Special for breakfast in the morning before flying out and it was a great way to start the day.Someone mentioned that fly out times vary and itâ€™s very true but better safe than sorry. I give Air Ivanhoe a thumbs up!"
6324788,fishron,2019-05-24 15:28:00,317,"I haven't flow with Air Ivanhoe but they sound like a solid operation. I have fished Pebonishewi back in the days when Dick Harlock operated a fly-in fly-out the same day operation. I agree, the cabins on the lake were terrible. The cabins at the lodge were fine and the meals were as good as we ever had. The lake. As I reply to this post I'm sitting under the first beautiful walleye I ever had mounted. Twenty seven inches and it seems small compared to the many larger I have released since. I don't keep large walleye and wish I never had. Love to catch them though. With better cabins I would recommend Pebonishewi for walleye, pike and smallmouth. It sounds like Air Ivanhoe has done a good job in providing good accommodations on this great lake."
6331218,wallags,2019-06-15 05:01:00,10,"My friends and I have fished McConnell, Schewabic, Pebonishewie, and Lincoln. Different lakes but great fishing and accommodations. We always come in the day before and stay at the lodge before flying out the next morning. George's staff is always friendly and courteous. Here is an idea of the lakes I've fished there: McConnell - Small lakes with lots of walleye and two outlying lakes including one you hike to with a small cabin with boats on it and has bass/pike. Beautiful cabin and view. Pebonishewi - 2 cabins on the lake. Very rocky so you have to take it slow. Fishing is unreal with large numbers of walleye, pike and smallmouth. I even did some fly fishing for bass with top water poppers. They're still working on the cabins so they can be a little rough. Lincoln - smaller lake but abundant walleye with very good size. Minnow lake and outlying lake with pike. Schewabic - good sized body of water which is part of a river system. Sandy bottom so very few snags. Great numbers of walleye, bass and pike. You can fish both ends where water runs in/out. Two other private cabins on the lake and its a portage system so you might see others but we never did. Fishing was incredible and the cabin is really nice. All of the cabins we stayed in had solar power with generator backup/showers/hot running water. You can't go wrong with this outfitter. Good luck!"
6331814,labsrus,2019-06-17 09:47:00,557,"Our group has flown with them 4 times, 3 to Rush Lake and once to Bromley. All trips were pretty good and cabins were in great shape along with the boat s and motors. Planning another trip next year. Will look at them very close. They have taken good care of our group many times."
