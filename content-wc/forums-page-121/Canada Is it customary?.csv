So unless we stir-the-pot it is probably time to look for a new lodge.BTW...My buddies and I are looking for a new lodge and putting a lot of pressure on one place to get a prime week in June. I don't think lodges and raking it in but they do seem more full this year and than past seasons. I would start making alternative plans asap.Brett"
6331946,Hwy 101,2019-06-17 15:42:00,33,"I have been in two similar circumstances. The first time the camp owners called and explained they had a group that wanted the whole camp for a week. They weren't going to fill it, but they where willing to pay for the luxury of privacy. The owner said it was up to us, and I believe he was being honest with me. We rescheduled and received a lot of perks when we got up there that year. Free boat up grade, bait wasn't added to the bill and the owner or the dock hand offered to take us out to their spots in the evening. Great customer service. We didn't ask for it but we got it. They retired and I miss them. The other case we received a check for the amount of our deposit back from the camp with a short note saying that they had overbooked that week. No options were apparently available.That camp went out of business so I guess karma came around.We took that opportunity to move on to a different camp which was a great experience. After that we fine tuned our requirements and are now at a camp that is a really good fit for us. Look at this as an opportunity to upgrade. Along with the usual suspects, there are some great camps (and owners) that are still relatively undiscovered by Walleye Central."
6331956,kzoofisher,2019-06-17 16:09:00,5144,"The place I've been going for a few years is similar to what's already been described. At check out they ask if we want to re up for next year. If the answer is yes the deposit is due in a month. We always roll our deposit over because it's easy and the interest on a few hundred bucks for three weeks is nothing. If we need to cancel and give them a few months notice they'll refund our deposit.The place is booked up pretty tight and getting your spot back if you pass on it one year would be tough. We lucked into this spot when I sent them an email in October asking to keep me in mind if they had any cancellations. Sondra replied that she had a group that was two weeks over due with their deposit, she'd contact them and if they hadn't paid up in a week I could have it. And I got it. Either next year or the year after I'm going to skip the trip and meet up with some old friends for a trout fishing trip out West. I've already talked to the rest of the group and they don't think it will be an issue to fill a couple spots so I'm good to go. It would be nice to have a few extra guys who sometimes want to make the trip so I can hold onto this place as a steady spot and be able to do other trips now and again."
6331962,NARDA 1,2019-06-17 17:20:00,636,We always book and leave a deposit when the bill is paid at the end of our week. No issues in 30+ years. We have been upgraded to a larger cabin or boat over the years when the lodge needed to accomodate someone but we always were always asked for our approval first.
6332164,Jdconins,2019-06-18 09:30:00,62,"Thank you to all of you for responding. I asked because I wondered if I was being out of line. My fishing partner has told me that this situation has left a real bad taste in his mouth about this situation. We both liked the people at this outfitter and have used them since 2013, my only guess is that $9,000 is better than $3,000 they are getting from us with a higher profit margin. I have done all the communicating with the outfitter over the years but have asked him to handle to situation but not to be jerk and to give them the benefit of the doubt before assuming and shooting from the hip. Hope everyone has a safe year fishing wherever you are and catch the biggest fish ever."
6332170,Hot Runr Guy,2019-06-18 09:41:00,16061,"I still think you are due a better explanation from the Outfitter as to why you were ""bumped"" from your slot. If ""they wanted warmer weather"" is a valid excuse, then you should have been able to push the next week out too. HRG"
6332186,Jdconins,2019-06-18 10:13:00,62,"I agree with you HRG. We don't want to cut off our feet to spite our face so once we talk it out and get a better answer, however, I have already started to look around and wanted to ask any of you about the following. Kaby Lake fly in out of Wawa, Brace Lake Outfitters & Twin Lakes Outfitters. The searches I have done show both Brace and Twin Lakes to have positive feedback. I know nothing is going to be perfect and stuff happens. Also, I would like to shorten our drive by a few hours."
6332196,vteye3,2019-06-18 11:33:00,496,"We like the camp we go to 4 times in 8 years and are clear we are an every other year group.I made that clear with outfitter this past Friday morning on the way out. I will contact them early next Julyto see which week is available for 2021. Outfitter welcomes the call our. Our group is respectful and goes both ways. Non guided AK float planned for 2020, fresh salmon is as good as walleye"
6332198,johnboat,2019-06-18 11:50:00,2014,"ANOTHER group wanting warmer weather should have NOTHING to do with YOUR group.Any owner worth his salt would have asked you if you would consider switching. If you don't then the other group is SOOL. If you can, then great."
6331808,Jdconins,2019-06-17 09:38:00,62,Is it customary for your outfitter to give you first crack at re booking for the next year with the same time slot? Have any of you ever returned to your outfitter to find that they have given your slot to another party which is bigger in size and have tried to either move you up to make your trip earlier or move it back to make it later or have they tried to convince you to move to another lake altogether? Just curious
6331820,Pooch,2019-06-17 09:54:00,4618,"Most camps we've fished over the years try to accommodate an existing customer by booking next years trip when you camp this year. With calendar creep occasionally trips have to be ""shifted"" forward or backwards a week. The goal of owning a camp is to fill the cabin beds in each cabin each week. I lingered last year and lost my place at one camp and now can't get an opening at that camp. I don't blame the camp owners in any way. Just myself for dilly dallying around.Groups that in the past have been a nuisance to the owners and other guests, are late making reservations or don't have enough guys to fill the beds in a cabin might not get their reservations filled first. Just my observation.Pooch"
6331822,Hot Runr Guy,2019-06-17 09:58:00,16061,"Can't answer about an Outfitter, but at the cabin we rent yearly, you have until you walk out the door Saturday morning to either leave a deposit for the same cabin/week next year, or it's up for grabs. Was a renewal discussed with the Outfitter, or were you expecting a call from him to ask if you are coming back? HRG"
6331830,Aspencreek,2019-06-17 10:36:00,2911,"Exactly, if you want to rebook for next year make it known before you leave camp this year, and leave whatever deposit is needed. The camp I go to after 12 trip's didn't require me to make a deposit, he knew I would be back, until I couldn't go because of business and my daughters wedding. Now my slot is full and I get to work myself back in, if ever. This camp is one of the best on LS and getting back in will be difficult. I will have to wait until someone else screws up."
6331870,valley366,2019-06-17 12:13:00,193,"Different camps have different policies. Most require you to at least give a verbal obligation for the same week the following year. I know I sat with the camp owner on Friday night when paying my bill and he has us slotted for a particular cabin the following year.Some require deposits right way. Some require deposits within 90 days. Some have a date like December 1st. All up to the camp.Like others have said sometimes the dates shift slightly. Usually this is based off when the opener is. I know ours slides a day or two earlier each year and then at some point slides later by 5-6 days. This is just how the calendar falls as the opener is the 3rd week in May.I could see an instance that if you had a small group and were in a large cabin this year that it would be in the outfitters best interest to get a larger group in that cabin. Most that I have dealt with are willing to have an open conversation with you about it. Like this year we were a party of 3 but were shifted to a 7 man cabin based on some other circumstances, I know next year we are back to our 4 man cabin.Have a conversation with the outfitter."
6331872,Obabikon,2019-06-17 12:13:00,2370,"I actually give guests until Thanks Giving to re-book their trips. As resort owners, it is almost always easier to have repeat guests than to have new ones. Plus, you develop a relationship, and become good friends over the years. I would be surprised if there was a resort out there that didn't give existing guests first shot at it."
6331884,BornToFish,2019-06-17 12:50:00,1224,"Greetings, The fishing lodge that I stay at does things the same as Obabikon reported. The lodge owners expect the guests to give a verbal commitment at checkout if they intend to return the following year, and then have until Thanksgiving to get their deposits to them. If there is no verbal commitment at checkout, that cabin goes to the next group on the waiting list. If the deposit is not received, the lodge owners know going into the upcoming show season that they have a cabin to fill. I can imagine one scenario that could complicate things. By way of example, say that a long-time guest needs to take a year off because of extenuating circumstances. The lodge owner might rent the cabin during the year off to a new guest, but with the understanding that the long-time guest has that cabin when they return to the lodge the following year. I would expect that lodge owner to make this very clear when the new guest books the cabin. Obabikon: well said. Kindest regards...."
6331886,kona77,2019-06-17 12:54:00,236,I confirm what others have already stated and every outfitter we have used (5-6 now) always asks if we want the same lake/same week when we finish up a trip.. I always follow-up with the outfitter when we get back home just to confirm this information.. Current outfitter looks for the next year's deposit in Aug/Sept..
6331896,Jdconins,2019-06-17 13:10:00,62,"Not trying to stir the pot here, every year when leaving we were offered the same time slot but this year we were informed that are slot was filled for that same week which was the group that was in our camp the week before we arrived. That group of six had complained that due to colder than normal weather, the fishing was not that good but would like to go a week later. When we asked about the week after they told us that the couple they just flew in had already booked that week for 2020.By no means have we been trouble makers and have left the cabin cleaner than when we arrived but I have found some cabins a complete nightmare from the prior group. I even turned other people onto the outfitter as referrals & just wondering if this is common practice among outfitters."
6331918,Bill Krejca,2019-06-17 14:40:00,6107,"Somewhat unusual situation, perhaps more to it that wasn't shared with you. Possibly a relative, very close friend, etc., normally not a proper fair situation for you, everything else being equal. I'd get real uncomfortable booking with these folks again, would always feel like I could be canceled down the line, i'd look elsewhere. Sometimes things work out better,even though circumstances may feel tough for the moment. Bill"
