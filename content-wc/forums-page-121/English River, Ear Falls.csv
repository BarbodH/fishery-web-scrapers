6328282,SteveZ,2019-06-05 06:43:00,271,The report is very little water coming out of Lac Suel. Little flow below the dam at Ear Falls.
6328288,UpNorthGuy,2019-06-05 06:55:00,53,"""Marginal navigation"" is a good way to describe it. As I recall you bring along some nice boats, I'd raise the motor and push if I was you. Good thing is there isn't any rocks in that channel, mostly mud."
6328310,ia bhtr,2019-06-05 07:28:00,212,"Well , sounds like the inside of the boat will need a good cleaning when I get home"
6329224,DanM57,2019-06-08 11:16:00,135,"We just got back last night from Manitou Falls. Water level was low and dropping. Like the previous post said, very little water coming out of the dam. Clear was accessible. Getting the channel leading in was the tricky part. I am not sure anything bigger than a camp boat could make it. Our group has been going for 40 years and we and we found some rocks we didn't know were there. Walleye fishing was steady but not as good as prior years. No real pattern, pretty scattered, Good luck. DanM57"
6331602,ia bhtr,2019-06-16 17:34:00,212,"Our group just got home last nite after a week at Knotty Pines , 1st couple days cold and rainy and for the most part stayed cool after that , fishing was spotty to start and picked up as the week went on , last 3 days were just like old times , pretty much hammered the walleyes ,lots of 22 to 25 inch fish with one at 30 1/4 , water level actually came up slightly while we were there , I am running an 1800 Pro V and had no trouble getting into Clear , altho I did go in and out with my bow mount , not my gas motor , we did get everywhere we wanted to go , Unexpected we trimmed up in places getting there , same with Johnson , all in all a really good trip again , fishing maybe over all a little slower than previous years , but very good none the less , a Big shout out to Norm at Knotty Pines , went above and beyond again this year for us , even got a couple of us on a fly in trip for Lake Trout which was an added bonus"
6332614,SteveZ,2019-06-19 11:22:00,271,We had similar results below the dam at Ear Falls. You had more flow than us as there was little to none out of the dam. It was a good trip. Some of the thunderstorms were a pain.
6332728,ia bhtr,2019-06-19 19:13:00,212,"Steve , yep , couple days boat control was a little bit interesting"
6332754,Lmbkiller,2019-06-19 21:10:00,639,Looking at flow data there's 12000cfs coming out of the dam and u consider that no flow? That's about 90000 gallons of water per second coming thru the dam. Just because there isn't water spilling doesn't mean there is hardly any flow. Some of the accounts of people's trips I read here are very entertaining.
6327480,jiggster,2019-06-02 10:30:00,183,Anyone knows the water levels ?
6327494,ia bhtr,2019-06-02 12:34:00,212,"Got a text in to Norm @ Knotty Pines , waiting on an answer to that very question , whatever it is , we will be there Saturday"
6327506,jiggster,2019-06-02 14:01:00,183,"I have a friend that was there last week, but have not heard from him yet."
6327696,Bakefish,2019-06-03 07:05:00,1077,After looking at some of the pictures from Knotty Pines the levels appear to be pretty low.
6327728,hoosiercanadian,2019-06-03 08:11:00,104,"Just returned from the Red lake area , all lakes are about two and a half feet or more low. The lake i fish is a shallow lake anyway , it cannot afford to lose any more water. This is the second year of low water levels and they had quite a bit of snow on the ground this past winter. Saw new reefs that i did not know were there, luckily didn't hit any. Already fires north of Red lake, they need about 3 weeks of steady rain."
6327972,ia bhtr,2019-06-03 20:56:00,212,"Sounding like similar to the same time later , maybe a touch better on water levels"
6328098,UpNorthGuy,2019-06-04 11:24:00,53,"I think its better than last year, but down from average years. Should be able to get into Johnson no problem if you take it slow, same goes for Unexpected. Clear will take some work getting into (kind of that way on good years)."
6328118,ia bhtr,2019-06-04 12:45:00,212,"Paul , is that beaver dam , or what left of it still a problem going into clear ??"
6328148,UpNorthGuy,2019-06-04 13:59:00,53,"Unless we get in there and remove it, it will always be a problem. I think a friend of ours has removed the builders from the area."
6328154,ia bhtr,2019-06-04 14:08:00,212,that was right nice of him Paul is the water low enough that we will need to get out and pull/push the boat thru or is it at least marginally navigable ??
