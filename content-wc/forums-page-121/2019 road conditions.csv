6331954,valley366,2019-06-17 15:57:00,193,Drove up 502 on the 8th and came back on the 15th. No active construction going on other then a couple guys doing survey work that did not affect traffic.Yes there were several areas that culverts had been replaced and are clearly marked with bump signs. If you are dragging a boat recommend you slow down for them.
6325564,Guest,2019-05-27 15:15:00,0,We'll be heading up to Sioux Lookout later this summer. We cross at international falls. How much longer does it take to go 71 vs 502?
6325574,Pooch,2019-05-27 15:29:00,4618,"That really puts you out of your way if you are headed for Sioux Lookout. If you were headed to Vermillion Bay then north it is about an extra hour over going 502 to Dryden. That makes some sense, but not going to Sioux Lookout.If you are coming from the Duluth area and want different (but at least an hour or more longer) scenery then go north of Duluth to Thunder Bay then west on the trans Canadian to the turnoff north to Sioux Lookout. Even that route will add at least an extra hour or so, but all are good roads. We used to go that way on occasion and spend the night in Kakabeka Falls or Thunder Bay. Just depended on what camp we were going to and time of day we planned to hit the border.Don't let people scare you off on 502. It's not a big deal at all and it's always got some construction somewhere on it. It is a pretty drive bordering on boring at times. Some trips wildlife is in abundance on any road, but 502 seems to always have it's share.Pooch"
6329412,reddemon2,2019-06-09 08:49:00,255,"Just returned from Vermilion Bay yesterday, 11 out of fort frances was clear upto the 502, about 30Km into 502 they are replacing culverts pretty much all the way to just about 50km south of Dryden, Also they are surveying and staking to replace the road in the same area, 17 west out of Dryden was clear to VB. Please note: On the return MNR was setup in FULL FORCE checking everyone on Hwy 11 just west of the 502/11 junction. Also, Northbound border crossing was backed up i'd say 3 miles around 11am, Southbound was about a 15min wait Good Luck"
6329418,NARDA 1,2019-06-09 09:23:00,636,"Waited through that 3 mile backup the first year we went up in '88, NEVER again, started crossing on Friday late afternoon after that. Spend the night in Fort Frances and then only a 3 hour ride to the lodge and could get an extra 1/2 day of fishing in."
6330612,Illineye65,2019-06-12 19:54:00,8,"Go here....https://511on.ca/#:Alerts Great website on road conditions in NW Ontario...indeed, the entire province. Even a few strategically placed cameras. Hope it helps."
6330620,lunker99,2019-06-12 20:20:00,236,Was there much of a traveling line and how much time were the waits at each of these replacement sites?
6330624,Aspencreek,2019-06-12 20:24:00,2911,"Same here, except we stay at a friday to friday camp now, but we still cross the border thursday night and stay in FF. Besides missing the BIG line in the morning, we get a healthy discount on rooms with the exchange rate. For the life of me I can't understand why groups will subject themselves to that line every sat morn when then could have crossed the night before, skipped the line, slept in and had a good breakfast before heading to camp. We always stay at the Super 8, clean, comfortable, good breakfast (waffels), well lit parking and a restaurant in the lot next door."
6331138,reddemon2,2019-06-14 15:19:00,255,"Less than 5 min wait on the culvert replacements, if your going up late morning or mid afternoon expect long delays, Leave 1 day early cross Friday evening, stay in FF, Rise n shine and head out by 8am you'll be fine"
6331582,stjoeguy,2019-06-16 16:01:00,979,"We didn't have any construction delays Saturday, 6/15, going south on 502. The road is not in very good shape, however. There are a lot of repair areas that are currently gravel. They're marked with Bump signs and some are VERY rough. They might not be too bad with a car but are very bad with a trailer. We saw one truck and boat with a trailer wheel off shortly after one of the rough stretches."
6331680,Northwoodswalleye,2019-06-16 22:04:00,262,We travelled to ear falls yesterday. Went up thru Nestor falls/Souix Narrows and zero road work not much traffic. Much better than the road construction on 502.
6323876,johnboat,2019-05-22 06:35:00,2014,"For those who have made the trip up North to Gullrock/Red Lake in particular, how are the roads? The 502 and 105.Construction? Getting ready for construction? I know it may be a tad early, but anything you can tell us?Thanks!"
6323880,BornToFish,2019-05-22 06:45:00,1224,"Greetings, I'm not entirely certain, but it appeared to me that there will be a stretch of road reconstruction on Hwy 502 - a stretch of about twenty miles south of Dryden. It looked to me when I came through about two weeks ago that crews were getting ready for the project. Hwy 105 was clear to Red Lake. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6323890,johnboat,2019-05-22 07:19:00,2014,"BornToFish, Thanks! That was exactly what I was looking and hoping for.That will work out perfectly. Hopefully after an uneventful 12 hour drive to Dryden for a handful of cold ones and a sleepover, it sounds like smooth sailing up to Gullrock.I hope your trip was a good one!"
6323932,johnboat,2019-05-22 08:58:00,2014,How about from Minneapolis to the border?
6323944,middle son,2019-05-22 09:18:00,15,"Google mn511 - that is MnDOT's site for road conditions, construction etc....."
6325322,BornToFish,2019-05-26 19:35:00,1224,"Greetings, I traveled from Red Lake to Wisconsin over the weekend. There are three areas of road construction to note. First, there will be a stretch of road construction spanning 37 km on the north end of Hwy 502. The north end of this project is near Century Road - just south of Dryden. This project appears to be imminent. The second area of road construction is also on Hwy 502. This project involves a span of 29 km on the very south end of Hwy 502 - beginning where you turn left from Hwy 11 onto Hwy 502. This project appears to be in the ""get ready"" stage. For both areas of road construction, crews have already replaced many of the wooden posts holding the metal cables - keeping cars from skidding into deep ditches. This might suggest that these projects may be limited to re-surfacing. The third area of road construction is when you leave Fort Frances on Hwy 11. They appear to be getting ready to re-surface the overpass that is very near Rainy Lake Sports. There are traffic signals to control traffic flow. This project may be over with fairly soon. Highway 17 from Dryden to Vermillion Bay and Highway 105 were clear of construction. The border crossings into Canada and then back into the United States were absolutely normal in all respects. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6325462,NARDA 1,2019-05-27 09:09:00,636,"You might want to look into taking the 71 instead of the 502. According to Google maps there is only about a 10 min increase in drive time to Vermilion Bay from Fort Frances. For the past 2 years I have taken the 71 and prefer it to the 502, it is a much less hilly route with more shoulder to pull off on if needed and there are several small towns to stop in also."
6325472,NARDA 1,2019-05-27 09:35:00,636,There is also Cell Service most of the way on 71. There is none on the 502.
