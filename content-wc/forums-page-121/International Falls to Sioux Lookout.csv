I am taking my 3 sons ages 9-15 and my father in-law on a fly in fishing trip. Tentative plan is to get some groceries in Dryden and then finish the drive to Sioux Lookout. I wanted to ask anyone if they had a suggestion of a place to stop to fish, hike, explore, eat or whatever. We have the whole day to make the drive and do the grocery shopping. So any suggestions would be much appreciated!! Thanks, Harry"

There is a long stretch of road (HWY 502) connecting I-falls and Dryden. There was at least at that time a surprising number of geocaches along that stretch of road. Our kids enjoyed getting out of the truck and chasing that stuff down. Just make sure you have everything downloaded as you likely will not have service. Just an idea, but it was something we did to break it up. Depending on what time you are passing through you may see quite a few bear on the way up. We saw a number of cubs walking in the ditches last week. Anyway, have a great time and good luck."
6331086,Pooch,2019-06-14 11:11:00,4618,South of Sioux Lookout is a Park on the left (north or west as you go towards Sioux Lookout) called Ojibway Park. We have stopped and fished the lake (Little Vermilion) numerous times over the years. There is a nominal fee to enter the park and it is on the honor system most of the time. You have to buy a park pass at a check in station as you enter. You pay the fee (cash) and place a card in your windshield. It's a nice place to stretch your legs and have look around. If you had your own boat the small mouth fishing is good.https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/ojibwayPooch
6331168,IaDave14,2019-06-14 17:40:00,99,I have seen folks fishing by the bridge just south of Sioux Lookout across the road from Frog Rapids Camp. It is above the rapids not sure if you can get below the rapids. This was in late May so no idea about later.
