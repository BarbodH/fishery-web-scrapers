The weather was kind of all over the place, and the wind provided whitecaps on three of the days, but we caught a lot of fish and had a great time. A big surprise was the number of fish in the nearby portage lake, Strawberry Lake. We did not fish it last year, but my brother and another guy in our group went in there for the day, and they caught 200 walleyes (using the fish clicker for honesty) almost all between the 15-19 inch range. No real big fish, but a sidetrip that was definitely worth it. Biggest walleye for the week was 26+ inches, but I caught piles of the 19-23 inch walleyes that give such a great account of themselves on 7-foot ML action rods, and that I love so much. I estimate that I caught at least 50 walleye per day, with one day producing 75+. The pike were actually a pest, I guess, if you can call a constant parade of 5-12 lb. pike a negative. I know there are some giant pike in this lake, every year guys take pike of 20-25 pounds, but not us, not this trip. Biggest pike was about 36"", but as mentioned, there are piles of 30"" pike mixed in with the walleye. Every day we had a good breakfast, fished till about 6, had dinner, and most days, we went back out for a few hours, taking advantage of diminished winds and a better than average bite. We had a new guy with us this year, one who had never been to Canada, and his enthusiasm and awe of the fishing was palpable. A great trip, great food, and good company! I'm home for a few days, and then back to Clear Lake for 6 days with a new group on June 16-22. Hope everybody is having a great season so far!!"
