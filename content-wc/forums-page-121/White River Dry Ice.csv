6330855,madnomad,2019-06-13 16:00:00,34,"i highly doubt it,ive never seen it there"
6330910,WesternAllegheny,2019-06-13 19:32:00,2,"I would guess ThunderBay If at all. It will keep for several days in a good cooler and keep it sealed.Places that make it are rare.I have a Dry Ice Vendor in the Pittsburgh, PA area. 25lb Blocks."
6330912,bfish,2019-06-13 20:04:00,1096,"How much do you need? Many dry ice makers out there under $200, just connect to a CO2 tank, especially if you don't need larger blocks. Penguin has one that is $78 on FleaBay."
6330922,rutter,2019-06-13 20:53:00,19,Probably just need Under 10#. Only need to keep fish dozen for about 12 hours.
6331108,Bill Krejca,2019-06-14 12:32:00,6107,"If fish are already frozen, a good cheap foam cooler will suffice for many hours. Add some ice on top, cover with newspaper if room. There is a a good reason why dry ice is not readily available in the area, little demand, eh? Bill"

Drove 14 hours after flying out ,to our cabin in Michigan. Spent night and drove home 6 1/2 hours next day. Fish still froze solid after arriving home . Took a butcher friend of mine on a 2 man fly in. He thought I was crazy doing that ,after arriving home i made him a believer . Have a 40 quart 5 day cooler . Put a few freezer packs on bottom and one of our bath towels on top. One row of duct around the seem of the lid. Never had an issue ."
