My sister here for 2nd time , a newbie here for 1st time and me here for 4th time. After reading Mike Borger's posting on his cold trip to N Caribou at end of May and start of June I'm hoping that the weather will be better and the fish will still be relatively shallow. We stay at Pickle Lake Outfitters camp on the Northwest shore of N Caribou, we seldom see anyone other that our group here. Will be trying several lakes north of camp, have a small motor and square backed canoe to do some exploring Will post a report when we get back Good Luck & Safe Traveling to Everyone Larry S"

(52.829490 -90.898940)..although I am sure its a regular spot for your group.Looking forward to your report.Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk

We will be going down to check out another camp(Runk Island) on an island by Terry Island & before Stewart Bay. Pete Johnson takes care of and rents this camp out for the owners. We looked into going there this year, but it was already taken. Its a lot closer than running down there every day. We want to explore the Stewart Bay Area and the Nango River"
