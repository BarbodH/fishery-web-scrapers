2973009,IlliniMuskie,2014-07-07 16:14:00,22,"I am going to fly in to Kishkutena later this month. This will be my second fly-in trip out of Nestor Falls. The first was in 2001 to Lawrence Lake. Tang of the North is the only outfitter that I'm aware of on Lawrence. We rented a private residence that is no longer available when we went. Has anyone here fished Lawrence? It's got walleye, northern pike, and lake trout. It's a very deep, clear lake that is located just east of Rowan. We found depths of up to 250'. Nobody in the group had ever fished for any of these species, but it was a relatively easy lake to figure out. We caught several walleyes 14-19"", northern pike until we were bored with them, and several lake trout after we rigged up a way to get down to them. I suppose I'm just reminiscing or being sentimental, as Lawrence holds a special place in my heart as the only Shield lake I've visited thus far. I've not seen mentions of it in this site and was curious what others thought of 'my' lake."
3039673,Obabikon,2014-07-28 19:10:00,2370,"I have never fished Lawrence, but I've fished Kish many times. Its a fun lake, and you should catch several muskies every day. It is also loaded with Smallmouth and perch. It fishes pretty easily, with lots of structure and weed beds. Have fun and be safe!"
3040185,IlliniMuskie,2014-07-28 20:45:00,22,"Kish was awesome. Fishing was slow the first couple days, but it picked up. My largest muskie was 41"". My largest smallie was just shy of 6 lbs. That was an awesome fight. The weeds were not very far along, but when we found weeds, especially near rocks, we found fish. We portaged to Marl and Wigwam one day. That was a blast. It was a bluebird post frontal day after a big storm the previous night. 3 boats landed 20 muskies between us in one day, even though conditions were less than ideal. Beautiful lakes. I cannot wait to return. The Canadian Shield definitely has a piece of my heart. Btw, I live in Fairfield, IL. Not far from the home of the Orphans. How does a southern Illinois family end up running a lodge in a Ontario?"
3040529,Obabikon,2014-07-29 04:34:00,2370,"I'm glad you had an awesome time at Kish! I have heard that there are some bigger muskies there, but about 40"" is my max too. The action is unreal though. My parents were from Centralia. They purchased Obabikon in 1970, and then sold it when I was 16 (in 1997). The opportunity to repurchase it arose, and I asked my wife if we could. She dove in blind, and the rest is history. This is our 8th summer as the owners. We go back and forth with our kids now, 5 months in Canada and 7 in Centralia. Do much Musky fishing in Southern IL? Shelbyville and Kinkade are solid fisheries. I went to college in Kentucky, and fished Cave Run many times. That's a cool lake too, but nothing compares to NW Ontario."
3042329,IlliniMuskie,2014-07-29 12:37:00,22,"I usually make to Kinkaid 2-3 times a year. It's kind of a poor man's version of a Canadian wilderness lake. Nothing but rocks, trees, and water. I love the lack of development on the lake. I've never fished Shelbyville or Cave Run. I would like to think that someday I will hit both, but time seems harder to come by these days. At this point the main goal is determining how soon I can return to Canada."

3060921,IlliniMuskie,2014-08-04 20:44:00,22,We booked both our trip to Lawrence and our trip to Kishkutena through Terry. He no longer owns the Lawrence cabin. He is a great guy and his place on Kish is top notch. And the pies he brings midweek are out of this world.
3061865,Mark Hivon,2014-08-05 10:14:00,4,"Terry was the realtor that help me find my own special place on LOTW.I've had my place now on LOTW for about 24 years. The fishing gets better and better each year. When I mention the old wind sock and the sand beach on Lawerence lake, your group was staying right there. The sand beach was where the old ranger station use to be by the narrows where the other cabins were. Kinda behind you heading thru the narrows towards the otter bay direction.Fishing on LOTW is different then a fly in, but we still have defintely plenty of great fishing for sure. Our group also fished with Knobby's...truly a walleye factory up there as well.However it sounds like you guys like to chase Big Muskies....so LOTW is also a great choice.Be Safe on the Water....Mark"
