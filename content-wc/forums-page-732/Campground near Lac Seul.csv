I know there are alot of them around the Sioux Lookout area, but would like to find one on Lac Seul. Have a slide-in pickup camper, so would like water and electric hookup at least. No need for bathroom or shower if they are on site. Thanks in advance"
551947,Guest,2005-09-07 10:44:00,0,Are you able to camp on Lac Seul? On an island? I always thought it would be cool to do that for a few days. Find a large rock shelf and put up a tent.

Wilderness camping is also right up the road on 664 with the same and Abram camp in sioux lookout has camping. if you are looking for something more private, i have a couple acres with a cabin on it about 4 miles outside of hudson that might help you out as well. www.siouxlookout.com then go to the business directory for contact numbers above campgrounds. good luck"
