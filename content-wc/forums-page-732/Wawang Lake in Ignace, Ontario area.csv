551788,Dr. Lee,2005-08-26 10:46:00,15,A group of fishermen are heading for Wawang Lake near the end of June in the summer of 2006. None of us have been on the lake before and are mainly interested in Walleye and Northern Pike fishing. We are staying at the only camp on the lake and would like any information about the fishing or the camp itself. We have always gotten great responses to our questions on this board in the past and thank you in advance for your assistance.

I looked up the people pictured on their gallery, found their numbers on the internet and contacted about 20 of them. Everyone raved about the lake. We are thinking of going up there next year. Good luck- Stu"
