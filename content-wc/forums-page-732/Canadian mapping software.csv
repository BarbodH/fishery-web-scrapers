A friend yesterday told me he would have bought a map for LOTW but as soon as he 'crossed the border' from MN to NW Ontario, it shut down, taking him back to the first screen of the Lowrance GPS/FF unit. I have a surface map of NWO and love it but it doesn't have topo. He says that Canada now wants a cut of the $$ because they are the ones that made the maps in the first place. WASSS UPPPP??"
551811,rpieske,2005-08-28 12:51:00,1276,My maps work fine on the Lowrance. There are numerous gps related maps available. There is no magic switch that knows you are north of the border and shuts your map off.
551832,rebelrn2001,2005-08-29 19:02:00,1563,How old are your maps? They all work by Lat/Long. They could easily make the new maps stop working at the border. This is something new this summer from what I hear.
551836,Reels,2005-08-29 20:11:00,2876,They are ran off of US satelites. Doubt the US would shut down north of the boarder. <{{}}><
551838,rebelrn2001,2005-08-30 06:44:00,1563,"I talked to a guy at the local bait shop this morning. He says this issue has been going on for about a year now. There are some maps that will shut down at the border. Yes, your GPS works off US Satelites, but it's up to the mapping software to decide where you are on the map chip that you buy. My point is, be careful when you buy one because most often, once you buy one and open up the package, they will not allow you to return it."
551840,Reels,2005-08-30 07:26:00,2876,"Good advice. I think I remember Navionics had an issue with the Canadians a while back, but something got resolved. Maybe Jeff can pipe in a answer the question. <{{}}><"
551864,Rich J,2005-08-31 20:00:00,65,"I bought a Navionics map for Ontario about a year and a half ago and it only contained Eagle and I think LOW or Rainy Lake. It seems there was some disagreement between Navionics and whoever distributes the Canadian electronic maps. I don't know if this has been resolved yet, I liked the Navonics map but it did not have the lakes I need. I currently have a Freedom map and although it is not a topo map it does show shore lines, islands and such, I have it loaded in my Lowrance GPS and it works quite well. Magellan also produces a topo map which can be downloaded with proper software. Here is a link which was posted sometime back that shows lakes in NW ontario. Enter the Location as Ontario and the type as Hydrography and then enter the lake you want to see.http://www.magellangps.com/en/produc..._topo&load=yes"
551866,rebelrn2001,2005-09-01 06:57:00,1563,"RichJ, I have that same map. It is much better than nothing at all. Last year we went to Lac Seul for the day to fish w/my cousin and we were 24.5 miles as the crow flies from the lodge....probably 35 miles of water covered. They knew where they were going but I'd have been lost w/o the map. Topo would have been REAL nice but as others have said, rocks/boulders can pop up anywhere/anytime!!!"
