551895,dancollins,2005-09-02 13:29:00,4,"Does anyone know the rules (and where those rulles are) regarding how many fish I can bring back to the US from Canada. I have a cabin on Lake of the Woods and catch a lot of walleyes, northerns and lake trout. I have never bothered to bring any back to the US, but I was thinking maybe I should consider it. I have a regular non-resident canadian fishing license (not a conservation license). I couldn't find anything is the canadian rules about what can be taken across the border. Can someone point me in the right direction? Thanks. Dan"

One days limit packaged in such a way that the size (where slots are in affect) and species can be identified. Leave a patch of skin on each filet and package one fish per bag. If there is a slot limit, leave the head and tail on until you get home."
551901,Guest,2005-09-02 18:51:00,0,"I believe the license allows you to bring back 4 walleye, 4 northerns, 4 smallies, 1 muskie (not sure of the size but guessing at minimum of 50"")."
551902,Guest,2005-09-02 19:03:00,0,"Hi. I gather from your posting that you can have more than one days limit in your cabin since you own it, is that right?"
551905,Skylane,2005-09-03 07:07:00,101,"Dan, just a thought here, but why spoil a good record? I also have a cottage on the Ontario side and have not brought any fish back south. We are in a position to educate and show by example how to conserve our fish resources. Maybe your lake is different, but mine has been showing the effect of over-harvest for quite some time. Please don't take this as being to negative, but just wanted to put a different spin on this subject that has been a concern to me."
551933,Jig A Lowe,2005-09-06 12:22:00,87,"The way that I have read the Ontario fishing regulations, there is no requirement to leave the head & tail on EVEN if a slot limit is in effect where you have been fishing. I have read & reread the regulations just to be certain. And, the owner of the resort where we stay has the same interpretation. Also, I have not read where these is a one fish per bag requirement. What I have read is that fish must be packaged so that they can be easily counted. But, yes, you do have to leave a 1"" sq. patch of skin onf filets so that the species can be indentified. What I have never been able to figure out is how many of these regulations are enforced when different bodies of water have different size and possession limits. If a person is stopped and checked for fish, how would the officer be able to prove where the fish were actually caught? Also, would it be legal to give a non-fishing friend some filets? If so, what would happen if he/she were stopped and didn't have a license while transporting those filets received as a gift? A little piece of advise is to have your fishing license handy when transporting fish. Don't do as I have done which is to have your license in your tackle box in your boat which is covered with canvas making it very difficult to produce. Bulldog"
