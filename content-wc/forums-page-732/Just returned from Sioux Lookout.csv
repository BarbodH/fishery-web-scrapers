551927,Guest,2005-09-06 08:13:00,0,"Got home Sunday afternoon from Abram Lake Park near SL. Our party was there for a week and fished mostly Abram and Minnitaki. Probably caught alot less fish this trip than any other, but had plenty to eat with alot of throw backs. The weather was very uncooperative. Alot of rain, wind, and just plain stinky conditions. Wed. was the only day we had sunshine. Fish ran small with many dinks less than 12 inches. It seemed the last two days (thurs. and fri.) the bigger fish were stacking up on the humps and into moving water like the ""chutes and frog rapids"". Our biggest came out of Frog Rapid and was 24"". Caught alot of slotters up in Lac Seul. Put in at Deception on Wed. and Thur. and ran up through the rags and fished that area of the lake. Did really good on Wed. (the only day of sunshine)but Thurs. was cold, windy, and rained most of the day. Evans Point was good but couldn't fish it very well because of the wind. Both days in Lac Seul we caught many slotters. Nothing above, but nice fish. Friday was out best day in Minnitaki for quality of fish. Couldn't hardly stay in the boat because of rough water but was able to get the anchor to hold (tied two together)on a hump just south of Harvey Narrows and caught nice fish. Not numbers but quality. If I would rate Abram and Minnitaki on a scale of 1-10 I would give it probably a weak 5 or 6. We used jig and minnow 90%of the time. I need to learn more on how to fish fall walleye. Seems I get hung up on a certain presentation and fall pry to the rut. I need to learn where to look in certain conditions. Spring is a no brainer and I catch myself thinking I can fish fall like I do in the spring. So, I guess what I'm saying is; other experiences walleye fishermen probably have a different opinion about the two lakes this time of year. I have alot to learn. But all in all I still believe a jig and minnow is an excellent go to presentation. We slowed trolled them, vertical jigged, and all that stuff. In the future, I will probably look for a place closer to Lac Seul that I can camp and have quicker access to LS. I believe I was probably two weeks early for the bigger fish since we started getting them on the typical fall locations. eyesnatcher"

I first fished that hump south of Harvey Narrows about 3 yrs ago with a local that worked at the resort we stayed at. He found 30' of water and anchored and we must of caught 60 fish in 2 hours- It was right before dark. That is a great spot unless the wind is blowing which it always does in the fall. Did you catch fish above or below Frog Rapids & Abrams Chute? Do you feel the fishing on Minnitaki is declining? I haven't been there for 2 yrs and from the reports I have been reading it makes me wonder. I'm heading up on Sept 17th, I still need to talk my fishing buddy into going if not I probably will still go and just hire a guide for a couple of days. I'm sure the owner of Abrams Park knows of some guides. I will post a report when I get back."
551932,Guest,2005-09-06 11:26:00,0,"Dave....Allan and Paula at Abram Lake Park are really nice people. I'm sure they can fix you up with whatever you need. It is a great place to stay. Nice cabins and campground. I have camped there at least three times with my 5th wheel. As you know, it is close to Frog and the chutes. I fished only one evening above Frog Rapids, however, some in our party spent quite abit of time there and caught fish, but small. I fished a couple evening below on the left side looking down and caught mostly small fish with an occasional keeper. I believe that is changing since they seem to be schooling up or whatever they do prior to spawning grounds. I didn't fish at all at the chutes, above or below. It is outstanding in the spring, but never had much luck in the fall. I don't know about the decline on Minnitaki. All I know is that I haven't done very well in the fall. Probably due to my lack of experience and willingness to try a lot of different presentations. We did troll with shad raps for about an hour and didn't even catch a northern. marty aka eyesnatcher"
551953,Guest,2005-09-07 13:57:00,0,"Fall patterns are if anything; different. we did better this spring than any in the past 10 years however we are not fishing for them the same way we did 10 years ago. instead of getting in the jig and minnow and 10ft of water grind, we now use crankbaits, bottom bouncers and fish shallow and deep as well. i think the evident honey holes are getting more pressure, but the population is strong as ever. i remember this spring on the 1st day the english river opened up and we shared the tight space with 55 other boats. we were throwing deep, slow cranks in certain colors and were catching 5 fish to every 1 in the boats around us. size was about average. we picked up about 10 above the slot and 20 in it for a week fishing with 3 guys. we also tried the mine shafts and hit twin pine harder than normal this year and deeper and it paid off well. also bobber fished in 4 feet of water around pads in lac suel and hit them good. it was an early spring too. we have caught fish in the fall in good numbers but i dont know fall good enough to match our spring numbers yet, nor do i know if it is possible. spring spawn really concentrates the fish from all over the lake. some of them little suckers have been tagged to go 15 miles or more to get to the english river. good luck"
551982,EricS,2005-09-08 13:54:00,20,thanks for the report...my dad and i are gonna fly out sept 24......north 100 mi. to gull lake on the cat river chain.can't wait:-)
551984,IaDave,2005-09-08 15:14:00,476,Eric- What outfitter are you using? We have been flying out of Pickle Lake the last few yrs and for some reason that extra 3 hour drive is getting tougher. Please post a report when you get back.
