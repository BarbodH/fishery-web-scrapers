551981,Guest,2005-09-08 13:43:00,0,"Fred, I was up there from Aug 19 through Sept 2, and the fishing was very good. Expect alot of walleyes from 14-16 inches. We used over 8 dozen minnows per day between 4 guys, and that's only fishing them for a couple hours in the morning and then again 2 more in the evening. They can be caught everywhere. Most of the common spots on the big lake are holding fish, devil's, doe, birch, etc. Most of the fish are in 32' to 38' of water. We had alot of trouble finding anything over 18 inches, but I think it will get alot better in Sept for your group. Northern fishing was also good, as the big fish seemed to be hitting about every 3rd day for us. We'd have a phenomenal day, then it would be slow for two, then great again, then slow. Best advice I can give you for the northern is if its windy, rough, and just totally nasty out...be fishing them! Those werre the days we hammered them. Good luck and let us know how it goes!"
