551860,Troutbeck,2005-08-31 16:10:00,682,"A friend of mine (who was intoxicated at the time) once asked a Canadian woman why they always say eh? Her response was, why do Americans always say, huh?"

551783,Guest,2005-08-26 07:42:00,0,"Dud, eh, You already forgot the 'eh', eh. ""It's like the law or something up there, eh."""
551789,Canucker,2005-08-26 10:51:00,9,Huh? I don't get it. Huh?
551791,jerry bark,2005-08-26 15:36:00,822,"i believe that using ""eh?"" at the end of every sentence would be incorrect. it is my belief that ""eh?"" is used as a verbal punctuation mark for the end of a rhetorical question. What's a rhetorical question? any question asked for a purpose other than to obtain the information the question asks. For example on one of my trips to canada my pal jim forgot to buy some milk for his coffee when we drove into the bait/convienence store, so we went back inside and the clerck said ""Forgot something, eh?"" just a polite greeting. Jim went on to respond ""forgot the milk, eh?"" apparently trying to live up to the traveler's cliche when in Rome..... the clerk gave jim a rather cold look and dryly said ""you don't know that eh? stuff"" i guess you had to be there, 'cause i laughed all the way back to camp."
