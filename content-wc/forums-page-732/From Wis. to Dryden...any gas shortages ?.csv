551867,rebelrn2001,2005-09-01 06:58:00,1563,Doubt any shortages but I'd bring and extra $100 for the gas.
551869,fishman,2005-09-01 07:04:00,60,We filled up with gas in International Falls on 8-27-05 at 9 am on the way into Canada and paid $ 2.69. Stopped at the same gas station yesterday and paid $ 3.19. Seen gas around the $ 2.99 for the next 200 miles. No word regarding any shortage.
551871,Skylane,2005-09-01 08:51:00,101,"Fishman, I wondered where the cheapest gas was south of International Falls? I am winterizing the cottage and heading south on Sunday. The look of fall has begun here, sure wish I could stay, but my harvest season is dead ahead. A week or two at a time is just not enough."
551874,fishman,2005-09-01 12:18:00,60,Once we got out of Intl Falls all of the stations along # 71 were at $ 2.99. Here in Alexandria today it is $ 2.99 on most and one at $ 3.19.
551884,Skylane,2005-09-02 06:55:00,101,"thanks for the info. Just heard on the Dryden radio station this morning, reports on local gas prices here. They reported $1.19 in Dryden and $1.28 in Red Lake and Ignace per liter. I am going to put enough gas in today to get well into MN. Had a call from home last night (central IL) and they talked of long gas lines and stations running out. Welcome back to the real world."

551890,jimbo,2005-09-02 11:29:00,223,I just filled up in Dryden yesterday for the amazingly low price of 102.4 at the Shell station East of Dryden a couple miles on the south side (Twin Towers). Good place to eat too
551906,Skylane,2005-09-03 07:17:00,101,"Mel, will e-mail you when I get back home. For now I will say that it is 8:00 am, 50 degress, no wind, clear skys and I am watching the fog lift off of the lake. Might even have to go out fishing today. So goes life in paradise. Next weeks chapter will be coming from the corn and soybean desert."
