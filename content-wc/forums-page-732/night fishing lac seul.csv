I'm sure there are shallow reefs that get good at night. We used to cast cranks off the island behind our cabin, did good until full dark, then it would slow down. After a typical day on the Seul, night time is for resting up for tomorrow. Good Luck"

My advice would be to grab a bottle of good canadian beer or some crown royal on the rocks and enjoy the night in other ways...its quite simply not worth your time. The reason i see was stated above, the water is stained and the fish feed all day long, even in bright sunshine so they have no need to feed again at night. On clear lakes where the fish are dormant for most of the daylight hours they will feed primarily at night. AV"
551863,Guest,2005-08-31 19:36:00,0,I was at Silver Water Wheel the end of July. We would still be excited from an awesome day fishing and not wanting to loose the pot for big fish of the day would go out after supper. We tried till dark and by the end of the week found dock fishing was more productive than an hour or so in the boat. Everyone has told you and I will too you will be tired by supper time. One day my boy and I caught 70 fish over 18 not counting under or northerns. Dude you picked a good lake.

551873,Guest,2005-09-01 11:28:00,0,I have a hard enough time missing rocks and reefs in broad daylight. Nightime could be damaging and dangerous. We always found enough fish during the day. Dem wallys also like to sleep in a bit - no need to hit the water at dawn.
