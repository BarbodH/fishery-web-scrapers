We always used the city park but it was too low last year so we used Stu/Cats on the Red a few days. Good luck. Thanks for the remarks on the other thread.

Willow springs is about halfway between end of main and clandeboye road. Nothing has changed since the following was posted http://manitobaanglers.com/fly/News/article/sid=40.html You could put in at chesleys off #9 and fish your way down as the greenbacks do make their way up netley creek."
