551916,bailey,2005-09-04 17:03:00,22,Can someone tell me what causes Lac Seul's water to be stained? I have done searches on WC and also checked internet search engines and all I get is a lot of info about the fishing but no explanation for why the water is dark. Any info would be appeciated or if someone could direct me to where I can find out. thanks

Generally how stained a lake in NWO is, has a relationship to wether it is a deep lake at the begining of the drainage system, or a shallow lake far down stream. It's like putting a tea bag in a 5 gal pail of water or 5 tea bags in a cup of water. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
