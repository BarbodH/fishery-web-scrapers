513418,Guest,2001-06-28 13:06:00,0,"I think the reason that folks got as upset as they did is the potential negative economic impact a post such a this might have on a camp. Imagine if the person who posted this message never responed back to fill in the blanks. Everyone would draw their own conclusions, and I think most people would automatically assume there was something wrong with the camp. Having reread the original post and his followup several times I must admitt it DOES seem like the intent WAS to get some negative attention focused on this camp. Or quite possibly I could be wrong and this person really is as stupid as his actions prove him to be."

513420,Guest,2001-06-29 04:53:00,0,"How can you people call this guy stupid, he clarified his original message and then apologized for the assumptions that were made...and many of you were mad because of what he made you ""ASSUME"" Give Me A Break...I truely hope this is not how you are raising the anglers of the future. Every young fisherman I know would rather be out catching their limit...than criticizing a fellow fisherman for something so little."
513421,Guest,2001-06-29 13:42:00,0,Well put Ms. Walleye. The gentleman clearly miscommunicated and has apologized. I've personally spent eleven week-long fishing trips at Moosehorn and intend to bring my own future young anglers there for trips for many years to come. The comments of the other anglers above certainly serves as heartfelt testimony to the unmatched hosts we've all found at Moosehorn and the consistent success we've had on the surrounding lakes and streams.
513409,dctolle,2001-06-24 16:54:00,9,"the fishing in the area was from one to ten, i would say a 6.we had some luck with walleye at the lake that the lodge is on, using nighcrawler harnesses. Also caught some northern on jigs and a few on accident on the harnesses. whitefish were biting on jigs with white tails. at the lodge lake, the walleye were in the back bay of the lake in 21 to 28 ft of water. The other lake we fished is called TENOR, it is a nirthern pike only lake. I have been to canada 3 other times. The northern fishing on this lake was the toughest i have seen in canada. That doesn't mean it was hard, just not as exceptional as the lakes in the past. They have several other lakes to fish. We did not get the opportunity to fish them, so i cant give a report on them. Although, i did hear of others catching lots of small walleye on them. I was told that in that area, they (walleye) only bite in the morning and evening. Where i am from (ohio) they bite all the time. So anyone wanting to catch them all day long, i would reccommend coming here. ha ha. I am sure they can be caught all day in some places, but i didn't have that experience. I am a tournament fisherman, i had a hard time getting them to bite. I don't consider myself a pro, but i do know a little about it. so anyways, good luck.dctolle"
513410,Guest,2001-06-25 12:59:00,0,"I just returned from the Moosehorn Lodge last week. This was my 15th year up at the Moosehorn.We made the trip from Southern MI and took alternate routes. The first (through Wawa) was fairly scenic and easier driving, the second (through Thessalon) was more scenic and an hour less but slightly more difficult driving - there is a 20 mile stretch along the river that is more narrow and has more curves. Every other part of the drive is similiar to any other highway in Canada.Hit the local rivers/streams during the day and pick a couple of lakes for night fishing - Tenor, McClennan, Pineal. You'll catch plenty. I left with my limit in trout, walleye and northern plus we had enough to eat for the week. Enough said. The lodge is beautiful and the hosts are great. They have a new hot tub and dry sauna that is the perfect wind-down from a long day of fishing. If anyone wants the real story with the Moosehorn, feel free to contact me anytime. Don't let some nut who has a problem driving, scare you away from a great place."
513413,Guest,2001-06-25 20:06:00,0,>WARNING to anglers going to moosehorn >lodge in Chapleau Ont. >email me for the details. This guy is nuts!!! I've been to Moosehorn a few times and I am heading back up there shortly. This lodge is a very relaxing and the host's are great. Doug and Roxann have taken the extra step to make sure my trips have always been top notch. I have recommended this lodge to several friends and would not hesitate to continue recommending it in the future. If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me.
513411,Guest,2001-06-25 23:52:00,0,"If you can't catch Pike at Tenor lake you're an idiot. Every time I go there I catch at least 20 or more in a short afternoon. You're right about not catching Walleye during the day. It's NOT Lake Erie! I am a tournament angler in Ohio as well and I had no problem catching Walleye at Pinneal Lake in the evening. Usually caught 10-15 walleyes with a few over 20"" in a 2 hour period. Try doing that in Lake erie. My suggestion to you is to stay in Ohio and continue to fish beautiful lake Erie for Smallies and Gobbies. And quit your whining!"
513412,dctolle,2001-06-26 16:06:00,9,"JP, as i said in my ad, i did'nt get the opportunity to fish any lakes besides tenor and mcClennen. and i did catch fish at tenor, just not as many as other trips to the area. I also caught fish in mcClennen. So my advise to you would be worry about yourself more than others. And a few 20 inch fish in 2 hours is pitiful for lake erie. I would hope you can do better than that if you fish tournaments. We rarely catch fish under 20 inches there. man know what you are saying before you open your trap."
513401,Guest,2001-06-26 17:25:00,0,"Having visited the Moosehorn annually for 23 consecutive years I can attest to the fine accomodations and fishing found there. The Lynns have worked very hard to make the fishery on their home lake top notch and if recent years' success is any indication, they have succeeded. I believe that this lake continues to produce excellent numbers and size of walleye. There are several other lakes and streams referenced in some of the other responses that also provide great action. If you are up for some adventure and poking around you will find great fun. I agree that evening and early morning are the best times for consistent action, but we have taken trophy-class walleye during the day as well. Surrounding lakes and streams have also yielded trophy Northern Pike and not fewer than 4 trophy Brook Trout that are adorning the den walls of several of my companions (regrettably not mine yet---maybe next year).The recent addition of a sauna and hot tub are just icing on the cake. There's no doubt that we'll be returning to this venue for the next 25 years!"

513415,kevin,2001-06-28 09:57:00,74,Gees the guy said sorry already. Give him a break and move on.
513416,duffy,2001-06-28 11:33:00,49,I second kevin's post. Maybe you all should apologize for slamming this guy. He miscomunicated and cleared the air. Move on!!!

513404,Guest,2001-06-22 08:29:00,0,Come on answer up this ain't right. Post something bad and then don't give details. Help out your fellow anglers let them know whats going on.

I have just returned from a week fishing at Moosehorn Lodge in Chapleau and had no difficulties. I have stayed at Moosehorn many times(23) and see no reason to stop after this year. The Lynn's are wonderful hosts, but they will not throw the fish into your boat...you have to do some work for them."

513407,Guest,2001-06-24 11:44:00,0,"Dear anglers, this message is only to warn people of the road and fishing conditions near moosehorn lodge. It was meant only for that reason. Highway 129 north going to the lodge, is a scenic road, but its conditions are yet to be desired. And for those of you planning on buying flats of worms for the trip, i would urge you to reconsider. I used nightcrawlers and my results were very unacceptable. For those of you who thought this ad was to try and hurt the reputation of this place, IT WAS NOT. some people thought it was . but i am saying again, In no way would my or anyone elses experience at Mooshorn lodge, reflect the experience you might have. So i do apologize for the misunderstanding. This was only to warn my peers in the walleye fishing community about conditions in the area.dctolle"
513408,Guest,2001-06-24 14:26:00,0,Please give us a fishing report on the lake. Thanks.
