I hear that the water is high but that the fishing is still good. I also would like to try for some muskies while I'm there. I'm taking four rookies so the trip should be interesting.Any info or advice you guys can give would be very helpful and appreciated.Thanks,Dave"
513596,dlhomes,2001-06-29 11:56:00,62,I have a cabin near Totem and from what I've seen they look great and you should have a great trip. You can't miss if you try Yellow Girl and I've heard Long Bay is good for Musky. I'm heading up 7/26 for a quick trip for eyes and maybe some musky. I'll probaly be on Whitefish bay-BIGGER fish I hope!! Good luck

Walleye fishing was just OK, seemed better for bass and northerns. We took a day-trip to Shoal lake east of Kenora and caught some of the biggest Walleyes I have ever seen (5 over 29 in with the biggest being 32 and 1/2). I think you need a guide to go in there and it is only catch-an-release and no live bait. You actually have to troll for Northerns and catch Walleyes by accident. When we were at Wiley, they were busted by the RCMPs and DNR for keeping more fish than the limit.Good luck."

The Slate Island reefs are holding nice fish if you want to jig or slip bobber. Also, around those same islands the nice walleye are hitting Rebel Crawdads and Shad Raps up shallow. Water temp was 70 degrees F.Good luck, I'll be back up there July 7-14."
