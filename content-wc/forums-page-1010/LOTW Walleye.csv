513594,Brownie,2001-06-29 07:51:00,12,"I just got back from a week of fishing out of Witch Bay Camp. The walleye fishing was very good, with lots of numbers of fish in the 17 to 20 inch range, up to a largest of 26 inches for my group. There was a 29 inch fish caught by someone else in camp, and quite a few 26 to 28 inch fish. After the cold fronts moved through early in the week of July 18th the fishing was slow, but as the warm weather took over, the fishing progressively got better. We caught walleye (up to 23 inches) casting jigs and shad raps along shorelines -- anywhere from 4 to 10 feet or so, vertical jigging in 26-30 feet of water, and bottom bouncing in 15-22 feet of water. The fish are just starting to appear in numbers and in size on the main lake reefs. However, on the windy days, we were catching them shallower than execpted (15 or so instead of 25-30 feet). In addition, a few sunny afternoons we caught lots of fish, although smaller, in shallow sandy and/or rocky bays. One bay off the main lake area had a west wind blowing into it, and we caught approximately 25 walleye in an hour or so using 1/8 ounce jigs and casting right up against some reeds. Also picked up a few northern (up to 33 inches) and a couple of little smallmouth. All in all, we had some very good walleye fishing. The bass fishing and musky fishing was slow, but seemed to be picking up our last couple fo days. Good luck."
