513471,Jigger1,2001-06-23 06:27:00,234,"Per high recommendations, I'm going to give Crystal a try this year. Bought Blue at the border last year, but need to get the high test Canadian stuff this time. Where is a good place near a grocery store in Dryden to get booze?"
513472,Hunter,2001-06-23 09:44:00,346,"Compared to U.S. beers, blue is high test, besides it is the beer everyone will like."
513473,Jigger1,2001-06-23 11:17:00,234,"I understand that's if you buy it in Canada, I bought it in International Falls so I believe it had a lower alcohol content."

513459,Guest,2001-06-22 03:32:00,0,LABATTS EXTRA STOCK. SO STRONG IT ONLY COMES IN A SIX PACK
513460,Guest,2001-06-22 05:14:00,0,I personally drink Coors Light but if you are coming to Saskatchewan you have to drink Pilsner or Canadian. Try some Calgary too if you can find it. It must be all right as my uncle seems to drink them fairly steadily.Have fun at Reindeer!!!
