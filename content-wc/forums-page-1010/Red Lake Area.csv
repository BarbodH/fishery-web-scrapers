513557,Guest,2001-06-26 07:29:00,0,I spoke to a camp owner on gull Rock last Wednesday and the mayflies had not hatched there yet.

513561,Guest,2001-06-29 10:07:00,0,RiceburnerI've fished nungesser for six years until switching to Eagle lake in 98. (wanted someplav=ce we could take our own boats) There are only two lodges on the lake so not a lot of pressure. A great ride up Nungesser river to get to the lake and the fishing that time of year always good. Enjoy your trip!
