513511,Guest,2001-06-27 04:12:00,0,"We were at Pickerel Arm last week. Weather was great except for the storm of the century on Monday night (85 mph wind and torrential winds). Power was knocked out for 24 hours and the lake really muddied up for a few days.Walleye fishing was excellent, in all the usual places, but especially in Red Pine Bay. Caught lots of northern, but not really any big ones, lots of slot size.I've been going there since 1986, and the water is as high as I've ever seen it. They need about three weeks without rain to get it to normal levels. You can't see 90% of the weedbeds, but they're still there.502 is about as good as I've seen it (which admittedly isn't saying much). There's a stretch of about five miles that was gravel, but it wasn't too bad. The southbound lane has some really bad spots, but the construction crews are making great progress."

We caught a couple of 7lbs and a few 6lbs. We caught alot of slots. We fished at the narrows and the cutout on the arm and done pretty good also. The smallys were on the bank around islands and in the river in redpine. Dc we were the guys in the bassboat from Ks., im sure we crossed paths or seen each other. It was a little chilly first part of the week,but beats fishing in the heat."

We stayed out in the NE section on an island out of Northern Sunrise Outfitters, nice place. Fished the English River inlet with lots of Walleyes bigest 26"", Northerns up to 10 lbs only. Some side fishing for whitefish was lots of fun over 50 ft of water.Also Lake trout.Where do you stay on Pickeral arm? Where do uou fish from there? I know it's a long way from the English."
513515,Guest,2001-06-29 17:44:00,0,"We stay at Pickerel Arm camp, just off Highway 72 before you get to the Ojibway Provincial Park turnoff. We fish the Arm itself, Red Pine Bay, Twin Bays, Lyons Bay. Used to go to English River, and always did well there, but is just too stinking far of a trip with a 25 hp motor. We haven't fished there in a few years. There are guys who stay at our camp that never fish anywhere but Pickerel Arm. We had much better northern action there than anywhere else this year. Walleye were best in Red Pine."
513516,Guest,2001-07-01 21:06:00,0,We stay at donnellys on the arm. We usually fish at redpine and the arm. This past trip we fished for walleye 90% of the time and the walleye were in redpine.
