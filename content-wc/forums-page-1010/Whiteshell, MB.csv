513579,Guest,2001-06-29 03:25:00,0,Where in the Whiteshell do you fish ! Off shore or with a boat. There are some prolific lakes with great walleye throughout the area.
513580,Guest,2001-06-29 04:17:00,0,"Just came back from Caddy. Did extremely well outside of northcross Tunnel. Drifting down the center of the channel along the weeds. Using 1\4 oz 1\8 oz tipped with a leech ,Chartruse and orange.Nothing huge, 23 biggest. But plenty of action. We were short on time so we didn't do the exit of the channel,but the 23 came out of the end of the run so a biggy is definitly is a good possibility.Good Luck and RIP SOME LIP!"
513581,Guest,2001-06-29 17:20:00,0,Thanks for the replyes. Caddy is a possibility. As per you're question rainman I fish from a boat and Big Whiteshell lake is where I spent most of my time. Fishing has been good in the past couple of years do to the new regulations. Just looking for some good holes that you been keeping a secret. Thanks and enjoy the waters.
513582,Guest,2001-06-30 11:20:00,0,"Well, in Big Whiteshell Lake your definitely in one of the better lakes...the top of that reef (is that marker under water this year) the islands closest to the Crowduck boat docks etc., all good spots.As you can tell, I am not out fishing today, something called 'working', however hope to get out soon.Pull your boat up and go to Whitemouth Lake, a tremendous walleye factory, reminds me a little of Crowduck, but keep the small ones and throw the big ones back.Have fun,"

Definitely will try that lake soon. Rainman you need to find a job where the weekends are off!.Hope you get out soon. Thanks."
