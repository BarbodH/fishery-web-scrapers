I didnt matter what or where you fished we caught em....I would seriously think about asking if he can get you on Zazania or Selt lake. These seem to have bigger walleye. We caught lots of 18-21 inchers and one guy caught a 10lb. 31 inch nice fish. I wont go to another drive in camp again... Just the same ole thing all the time.. Had to work way to hard to catch fish and we were told "" You dont need a guide on manotak""... you do!Good Luck Scott"
