513287,dctolle,2001-07-02 10:45:00,9,i recently took a trip to chapleau. i am a police officer and i wasn't aloud to take my sidearm into the country. I had to leave it with customs.
513286,Guest,2001-07-02 18:52:00,0,I tried that. It did not fly. I picked up my 25-06 on the way home.
513275,Guest,2001-06-14 11:03:00,0,"I am going to Red Lake on Saturday and plan on taking a shotgun. The reason for the gun is that we have bears in and around our cabin the last two years one time actually came through the screen on the window ( not fun at night ). I have the forms to allow us to take in the gun but was wondering if anyone has experience with this procedure and if you were given any hassle.thanks,Robby"
513276,Frank from TBay,2001-06-14 15:05:00,312,Check with OMNR before you go. There are strict rules about this sort of thing. Any CO should be able to answer your questions.
513277,chrism,2001-06-14 19:21:00,429,"I just had a face to face with a big old blackie - I went the pepper spray route, and it worked great...I do believe it is hard to get across the border also, but you can buy it in Canada at most outdoors stores - Only drawback is that you have to be very close. Most campers in canada, and the camps, might have a fit if you have a shotgun laying around - they are not use to seeing that sort of thing. But check it out if you feel that is the method for you....and let's hope whatever you decide, that you don't have another encounter!I do know you have to pay (around $50) at the border - some sort of fee (tax,b.s., whatever) that they have now imposed to transport a firearm."
513278,Team Alto,2001-06-14 20:17:00,75,"I believe you can only take a shot gun across for hunting not for self defence, so if its not hunting season up there the border guard might get not let it in."
513279,Hunter,2001-06-14 21:20:00,346,"If thats the case tell them you want to hunt coyotes, fox or wolf, those seasons are generally open year round."
513280,Frank from TBay,2001-06-15 01:58:00,312,There are no open seasons north of the French River in Ontario for public lands. Small game season is from September to April. OMNR does not want guns in the bush in the summer. Bears can be a problem at times especially in areas where food is and garbage. I have destroyed a few but do so only as a last resort. Most bear problems are preventable..... You also have the right to protect your property. If you have a cabin and own the property you have a legal right to own and keep a gun. If you are renting or the owner is letting you use his property check with him. Again....Most problems are preventable...check with OMNR or the OPP.....they willl advise you. They are also very experienced in bears and will help you with your problems. Good luck
513281,Guest,2001-06-15 13:14:00,0,"I have to agree with Frank- The shotgun is a really bad idea. A wounded bear could be lot more dangerous than a nosey bear. A clean camp is the number one preventative measure. Take your scrap food , fish guts etc to a remote shoreline or island - the bears & birds can take care of them there- Heck I don't even clean my fish in camp. Carry all the stuff in the boat & clean them at a remote site. Seeing you're doing a fly-in - It's quite likely others have been there before you. My first chore at a new camp site is to search the area around the camp/cabin for food scraps and/or fish guts etc. It's incredible how slopply (sometimes stupid) people can be. Get rid of the stuff. Bears use their noses a lot. If they don't smell food they have less inclination to be a pestI'M headed to Canada w/ my 15 year old daughter in late July for a Muskie fly-in by ourselves. Our solution: Teach the bear to avoid humans, i.e., a face full of pepper spray- I'm not talking about the little one's women carry in their purse- Most good sporting goods stores that sell to serious hikers and backpackers have magnum size pepper spray's w/ a belt holster. These things are good for ~20-30 ft minimum- a face full of caspium will take the fight out of just about any mammal alive. Best of all it teaches the bear that people are nasty and it should avoid them. Just make sure the spray is always at hand and you know how to use it if you need it. As you've obviously learned there's no time to read instructions during a bear encounter. Hopefully you won't have to use it.. If you live near Madison WI I can direct you to a store that carries magnum peper spray.Have fun.Catch'em & Let'em Go!><))))*>"
513282,Guest,2001-06-15 14:24:00,0,"ChrisM- Missed your reference to ""Blackie & Pepper spray""- My appology. I shouldn't speed read. Can you share the specific finite details of the encounter, i.e., time of day, weather, location, actions of bear, your actions & bear's reaction. I think it can greatly benifit those whom have never encountered a bear.Catch'em & Let'em Go!><))))*>"
513283,chrism,2001-06-15 17:23:00,429,"The story goes like this:At dusk, we were chillin' by the fire, camped on the beach...No wind, just a slight thermal coming from the bush to the water...we heard something walking towards us in the bush, then heard it rub itself on the outhouse (gov't backcountry campground) which was out of sight, but about 20yds from the beach. When I heard this I dug out the spray...we discussed screaming/banging pots/etc, but we figured it would only run away and come back later that night. Then we saw the bear walking down the outhouse path, about 10yds from us....It saw us, we were motionless, and it quickly stood up fpr about 2 seconds. Then it ran right at us 3 or 4 steps, and grunted, and then displayed some very aggressive behavior by smacking a 1.5"" poplar and knocking it over. It stared at us for about 30 seconds, and took two steps towards us and stopped, putting it about 10-12 feet away . At this point I shot the pepper spray (a quick 1 sec burst) aiming just below the face. The spray at this distance had a diameter of about 2.5-3ft, hitting the front chest, face, and legs. The bear snorted and turned around ran right into a big tree head first, then ran into the bushes and kept running into trees. As the air was still, we could hear it run for a good distance, and it was not in a straight line. Never saw or heard from him again that weekend!We chose to wait and spray to really scare/hurt the bear into not coming there again for a few days - whether this was good logic, I don't know, but it did work. I didn't want to haul 3 coolers with us fishing all weekend.I had an unopened can of suds on the table about 1 foot under the trajectory of the spray - unknowingly, and well deserverd, I grabbed the can, opened it and had a big gulp - and burned my lips off! I have had spray for years, as I used to do a lot of backcountry stuff in the rockies before I moved here - I disposed of the outdated spray by discharging it in the bush, and my experience is that you have to be very close, under 5yds maximum, and that stuff is very potent. Once the can is cracked, it is best to replace it. I don't know about the bigger cans having any more distance - I was told that they just contained more ingredient - but I would have to check on that.That is my story, and I will now be camping on the nearby islands whether the c.o.'s like it or not! chris"
513284,b8y,2001-06-16 17:04:00,7,"Chrism, was this on the big island north of cabin cut and south of bass island?"
