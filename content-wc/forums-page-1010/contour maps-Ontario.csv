513632,Steve,2001-07-02 06:38:00,259,Can anyone tell me where I can get contour maps for lakes in Ontario? I am looking for Larus Lake in particular-located in Woodland Caribou Provincial Park. Any help appreciated. Thanks

Where you're going looks like a fly-in or an extremely limited access area. The best bet there is to ask your outfitter or the resort owners or other outfittes in the area. A lot of times they have maps of their waters for sale. The Provincial Parks all have maps but I have never obtained a Government produced, Provincial Park map containing hydrographics.
