513590,Larry S,2001-06-29 04:12:00,666,"Just returned from a 10 day fishing trip to the Reddit,Ont area,which is 20 miles north of Kenora.Had excellent fishing for walleyes,my buddy caught his biggest ever walleye,29inches 9 lbs.A group the week previous got 3 over 10 lbs.We ate walleye almost every night.Also lots of worm free,large perch.Northern were consistant,although we didn't really fish for them very much.As a bonus we portaged into a lake and got some nice lakers 2to7 lbs.The walleyes were shallow,2to 8 foot in the weeds.Jigs and spinners worked well.We primarly used leeches,but crawlers also did well We fished 5 seperate lakes with no other people other than the camp guests on them.The camp is rustic to say the least,been going there since 1979,the fishing is only getting betterLarry S"
