512344,TQO,2001-07-01 03:22:00,10,"I have watched this message for quite some time and I was interested as to what the outcome would be. We used to represent Manotak for a few years as a booking agent. We dropped them a few years ago for the reasons you are saying.In general, drive to lodges are not for Michiganders (which I am one also), that want the experience of a great Canadian trip. If you go to the shows, you will see that all the booths are identical. They are all different, but they all show a nice cabin, a trophy fish and smiling faces. Don't let the faces fool you.There are plenty of fly in lodges that that are not worth a crap also. We used to book for a lodge in NE Ontario. I went there on an inspection trip for our company and caught 1 walleye in 3 days. Caught a few pike, but the walleye sucked. We immediatley dropped the lodge and looked for more. The logging roads were very close when we flew over and it seems that ice fisherman were taking lots of eyes. Also found out the lodge had new guides (hired from a local college) every year. They didn't even know the name of the lake half the time.Next time, do lots of homework. It is not fun to see how the posts started with great enthusiasm and now it turned to a bad memory. Lodges change quite often and an owner will always be able to supply you with good references. You need to do a lot more homework than asking for posts on this board.At least the fly in lakes made the trip.TQO"

512333,Guest,2001-06-05 13:34:00,0,ok well as I see it there are only a few cures for what you have 1) go fishin2) go fishin NOW3) stay trashed till you go fishin...Pick one or two and let me know what works..later ~P
512339,Guest,2001-06-24 17:30:00,0,Moose so how was your trip Tell me about the fishing or the lodge it self headed up in july.
512340,netboss2005,2001-06-27 03:44:00,4,"I was with moose_mi's group!10 guys including I went to Manotak Lodge from June 15th to the 24th. The people were nice but the owner was kind of a Dick. The fishing sucked. Each person only caught about 20 fish the whole week. We did go on a fly in and caught the heck out of fish there. We limited out in about 3-4 hours. The cabins needed a lot of work, the roofs leaked, the furnace was broken, and the toilet was broken. George was one of the coolest people there, he is the dock manager. The whole time we were there the owner and the guides kept making excuses on why we didn't catch fish but they need to realize that the lake is fished out. The one guide was a jerk and told us that we didn't know how to fish, of course he is going to know where the fish are he has lived there his WHOLE life. If I brought him here (Michigan) to fish he wouldn't know how to catch fish or where to find them."
512341,Moose_MI,2001-06-28 10:40:00,31,"Well....here's my report....The trip....we crossed the border around 06:00 Saturday morning...No problems..no line to speak of. On the way back they had a fish check about 3 miles before the border on highway 11....seemed to be mostly interested in people with boats...we breezed right on through. We stopped in Dryden Safeway for groceries...a great store!! ...wonderfull Filet Mignon!! 502 and 105 were ok to travel. Not great roads and a little construction, but not bad. If your a little uneasy about your trailer or tires you might want to take the alternate route on 71. Gas prices were pretty much in line with everywhere else.The lodge...not bad, but they could use some work. 1 of cabins roof leaked, furnace didn't work but electric space heaters were provided, toilet handles were broken and had to manually lift the ball #####, water pressure was minimal most of the day...water would stop a couple times while trying to shower or wash dishes, no pay phone (either collect calls or calling card that they sold at the camp store...imagine that) other than this they were in pretty good workin order. Boat motors were on there 3rd yr and supposedly getting replaced next year...they ran. Boats were kinda leaky, but they stayed on top of the water. The lodge was very nice and the meals served there were very good. The new owner, Dave, tries to be personable but he has to work at it. George that runs the dock is the nicest guy in the world...trouble is none of them have fished the lake and they had little advice for us that worked. Guides seemed to do much better than the un-guided...If you get a guide...ask for Alfred (I think).Fishing....was tough for us. First time on the lake, no guides, and no good advice from new lodge owners. None of us are pro fisherman, but I guess our point is you shouldnt have to be a pro to catch a limit of 4 walleye in a couple hours in Ontario...right?... Anyway for the week I caught 12 walleye on Perrault fishing a average of 5 hrs a day. I never fished for northern...biggest northen for the week was 30"". We caught some real nice perch and a few small mouth. White jigs, with white 3"" twisty tails tipped with minnow/crawler. Mostly I back trolled looking for a concentration of fish to jig...never found them. Tried the Musky lake 1 day....nice lake...lots of musky follows...2 were caught.Did 2 day trip Fly-In's to Twain lake...WOW WOW....what a great time that was!!! *** I have went to my last drive in camp!! *** The first fly in we put about 40 Walleye in each boat...the 2nd about 80...it was unbelievable ... we had 4 fish on at a time! This is what I drive 1000 miles for!Summary....As drive in's go...Manotak probably falls right in line with the rest. I think the new owners are still gettin there act together. If you go...get a guide at least for the first couple days. $125 for a day trip fly-in...go to Sazania or Twain. We will never go back to any drive in. Our primary reason for going to Canada is to catch (and release) fish...lots and lots of fish. If the fishin is good, nothing else matters. For this reason we will do fly ins from now on. The drive in lakes simply have to much pressure on them. They still have fish, but you have to know how to fish them. When your only there for 5 days once a year, you cant afford to spend your time trying to figure out where the fish are....Were going to idiot proof remote lakes where we can slam the fish!!!Moose"
512342,Guest,2001-06-29 11:08:00,0,"Number two guy with Mooses group.... I hope this guy that owns Manotak goes back to his Engineering job he left to buy this camp... cuz he doesnt know what the ##### it take to own a fish camp nor does he care what you think about the fishing... dollar signs in his eyes. Moose is right on when he says it PRETTY MUCH SUCKED.... it did. I am above average angler and have some knowledge of Walleye fishing, and I even got the guides to tell me exactly where to go...NO FISH!!Spend the money and go fishing with Doug Gawleey and his camp. He is an honest person and beleives that most of the lakes up there have been fished so hard, unless you live there for 20 years you are not going to catch fish...too bad... nice area.be sure and talk to Doug about his remote trips for the week. That is hands down the only way I will ever go back to Ontario again."
512343,Guest,2001-06-30 06:51:00,0,What is the name of Doug Gawleey's camp???
512324,Moose_MI,2001-05-08 06:54:00,31,"Hi all...Anybody give me the name and/or phone number of duty free stores in International Falls?Headed up to Manotak Lodge in Perrault Falls, Ontario (just south of Red Lake) June 15. If anyone has info I'd love to hear it. I'll be sure to give a trip report when I get backTHANKS"
512325,Skyraptor,2001-05-09 18:52:00,291,"Moose, I went to Manotak a few years ago, pretty good drive in lake to fish. The main fish is walleye and bass with some northerns and perch present. Manotak is a top notch lodge with good boats, meals and people. Some of the good places to fish is burnt island for bass, east bay for walleyes and whaleback rock for walleyes. My brother caught a 10#+ walleye there. Also you can travel into Cedar Lake for additional fishing and there are some good spots there for walleyes and also muskie. The primary bait used is the hook and minnow but minnows are not cheap. Fish are of average size and with a little work you can get good results. Also try twisters and fuzzy grubs. Good luck and please give a report on how it went!"
512326,Moose,2001-05-10 00:40:00,248,"THANKS SKYRAPTOR!! Really appreciate you taking the time to give the report. You can bet I'll give a detailed one when I get back...you probably wont be able to shut me up! I hear they have new owners at Manotak this yr, but they seem reel nice. Did you do a fly-in by chance? Really looking forward to getting into some Walleye while were there...yum yumthanks again"
512327,Guest,2001-05-11 06:15:00,0,"Moose:Went to Manotak the third week of June last year. Weather wasterrible-lots of rain. Lake was about a foot high. In spite ofthis my son and I were able to limit on Walleyes by breakfast bythe end of the week.We fished the whole week outside of Hopeless Bay. We were the only ones from the Lodge to fish before breakfast. We usually had limits by the time everyone else got up. Did best with minnows, but caught some with leeches. Fished for Pike during the day but never caught a decent size one. Also caught decent size Perch and Smallies.Some others did the one day fly-in. They caught 100-200 Eyeseach within 2-3 Hours. Also hooked up the some very large Pike.Make sure you do the Musky only lake for a day. You will get at least 30 follows.Hope this helps.Good fishing,Nette B"
512328,Moose_MI,2001-05-11 06:51:00,31,THANKS!! What a great report! Really appreciate you taking the time to tell me about it. Any smallmouth/pike/muskie bates you suggest?THANKS AGAIN!!
512329,Guest,2001-05-11 07:47:00,0,"Moose:We caught most of the Pike and All of the Perch backtrollinga plain lead 1/16 oz. jig tipped with a minnow. The perch that we caught were nice and big! We caught the Bass on crawlers and leeches. Unfortunately because of the size restrictions most were too large to keep.(anything over 12"" had to be returned) That's ok, nothing wrong with practicing CPR... and they were a blast to catch.Also, make sure you take a trip to the dump at night. We saw 8 blackbears. Fun to see.Good luck,Nette B"
512330,Guest,2001-05-11 15:40:00,0,"Moose;I would suggest you travel north on ""71"" from ""the Falls"" to ""17"". Then east to ""105"". The road has been greatly improved the past few years. The road to Dryden(""502) I beleave, is very pretty to travel, but no service of any kind for quite a ways. Be sure to get your license at ""Dutchy's"" at Perrault Falls. Chuck and Nancy are great folks and they will help in any way possible. They've been there for ever and know all the water in the area. Been going to Perrault Falls for 15 yrs. Plan to leave here next week. Send me a message if I can help in any way. You'll love it."
512334,Skyraptor,2001-05-12 04:24:00,291,"[font size=""1"" color=""#FF0000""]LAST EDITED ON May-12-01 AT 06:29AM (CST)[/font][p]Hi Moose, your days are getting closer till you arrive at Manatok. Like I said before I have been to Manatok many times over my life and can say I have been there about 12 times. Everything that has been stated is what you can expect to see, the walleyes are great as is the perch and bass but you do have to work for the northerns. For sure go visit the bear dump and see then. I started going there when King Johnson owned the camp about 30 years ago and have heard many stories about the lake and camp. Don't know if anyone now will remember the bear that was shot in the bed of one of the guides in the shacks by the camp for guides. Seems the guide came to his shack and found a bear inside and grabbed a gun and shot the bear right in his bed:D. The guide was Herman and he later drowned on the lake after a few too many beers:'(. Consider taking a day trip to either Cliff Lake where you can travel to a number of smaller lakes or to Ord Lake for some good fishing. We have done both of those over the years and have had good success. Depending on where the fish are all the locations in the previous messages have and will produce fish and I'm sure the the owners will pinpoint the hotspots on the lake unless you are having a guide. Since you are going June 15th and I am leaving for my trip on June 23rd to Reindeer Lake in Northern SK I will be looking forward to hearing of your trip on Perrault Lake. As for the life jacket question, I would contact the lodge owner and ask if they have any to rent as some owners do that. Here is there weblink in case you did not know it: http://www.duenorth.net/manotak/index.html Good luck on your trip and just hollar if you have anymore questions about the lake and lodge."
512335,Moose_MI,2001-05-15 07:30:00,31,Thanks again Skyraptor....We're about to explode waiting for June 15 to get here.Anything you can think of that might be of interest to us would be appreciated. You can email [email protected] or post here.Thanks again!
512336,Guest,2001-05-16 09:19:00,0,WENT TO MANATOK A FEW YEARS AGO--HORRIBLE. REG WAS THE OWNER THEN--YOU SAID THERE WERE NEW OWNERS NOW??? REG WAS PRETTY MUCH DRUNK BY NOON EVERYDAY. I SAW PEOPLE WITH LIMITS BUT WE ARE TALKING 12-14 INCH EYES!!! I ABOUT CRIED AT THE DOCK WHEN I SAW FOLKS BRINGING THESE IN FOR CLEANING. WE DID DO A FLY IN---HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT.
