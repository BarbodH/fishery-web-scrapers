513478,Guest,2001-06-22 05:43:00,0,We are contemplating a mid-September trip to either Eagle Lake or Lac Seul. Has anyone been to both and have a good idea on comparing the two? Thanks
513479,Guest,2001-06-22 09:38:00,0,Have not fished Lac Seul But other posts now and earlier have about convinced me that I should try it. Have fished Eagle the last 4 years and with guys who have been there for 14 years. Fishing is respectible and we are seeing bigger fish each year but we have to work for them and have not experienced numbers like some of the Lac Seul posts. I'd try Lac Seul.
513480,Jigger1,2001-06-22 10:54:00,234,"Quantity or Quality? Quality ... hands down LacSeul! I'll qualify my comments and say that my trip to LacSeul (last year) was guided and my four trips to Eagle Lake (20+ years ago)were with my Dad and we kind of fumbled around the lake, caught tons of fish, but never landed a walleye over 24"". Since then I've become a walleye hound and have always wanted to land a 10lb plus walleye. I researched drivable Ontario Lakes that were consistently able to produce trophy size walleye and Lac Seul kept rising to the top. I'll be back on Lac Seul in exactly one week and will be looking for my 2nd walleye at or above 10lbs. Last year I caught 27, 27.75, 28, & 29"" eyes and uncountable #'s under.To Eagle Lake's credit we did catch a lot of fish, had great memories, and saw a muskies that would scare a person (60+""), but for walleye's, I'm sold on Lac Seul. The lodge I stay at has a further conservation policy that asks that all fish over the slot be released! What a great policy, take a picture and put the trophies back where they belong... in the lake!Good luck on your decision and have a great time!"
513481,Guest,2001-06-22 11:48:00,0,"I agree with Jigger1, Lac Seul has some quality fish. The 29"" he mentions are big fish, they are so fat they are hard to get 2 hands around. 29"" walleye in the states lakes would weigh pound or so less and be alot older fish. LacSeul is full of forage fish so these eyes really grow big fast. If you are interested, I'd jpeg you a picture of one of them so you can see for yourself the quality of fish. I think Jigger1 will get that 30"" this year. Enjoy your fishing whereever you end up."
513482,Guest,2001-06-23 14:13:00,0,"Never fished Lac Seul, but have been going to Eagle for 20+ years. The fishery in the last 5-8 years has turned into a trophy fishery (ever since they banned night fishing in the late 80's). Won't catch a ton of fish per day, but every year we put fish 29-31 inches in the boat. Most fish will be in the 20-25 inch range- but you can sort through these bigger fish to find a few eaters. There have been days when we have caught 50+ fish per day, but don't expect this every day.We usually fish end of July first of August."
513483,Jigger1,2001-06-23 18:28:00,234,"AB, That's great to hear about Eagle Lake. It's a beautiful body of water and if you can mix some big eyes in, all the better. Lac Seul is calling, just a short six days away."
513484,trappermarc,2001-06-23 19:23:00,2,never fished eagle......fished lac seul for 8 times over a 11 year period.......the last trip was in 1999. the fishing is unbelievable.....4 people caught 40 fish over the slot.....biggest one was 30 inch......but he was a city boy and dumbed himself into it......no kidding....lac seul is a great lake.....we are going back july 10 this year.....16 days! we stay at ONAWAY LODGE.....what a great place.....blair and kathy campbell treat people like we do in the south.............kentucky......see y'all there
513485,Guest,2001-06-29 05:30:00,0,"There ain't nothing worse than a jealous country boy who cannot fish!! Did you mention the sucker you caught? I rather ""dumb"" myself a thirty incher than waste my time on 15 inchers. By the way, want to see a picture?"
513486,Guest,2001-06-29 10:11:00,0,Having been in the boat with trappermarc I can attest that as suckers go that was a nice one.
513487,trappermarc,2001-06-29 17:53:00,2,"well it seems like city boy and manitoba pirate, better known as kentucky river bucket setters have access to the internet................the only two billys i know that travel 23 hours to bank fish with bobbers. if any of y'all ever travel south through kentucky on I 65 look over to you right when crossing the ohio river......to no surprise you will see two ridge runners sitting on white buckets fishing the river bank....not hard to miss........one is a biscuit over 300 lbs and the other will have on designer fishing wear......see you on Lac Seul........"
