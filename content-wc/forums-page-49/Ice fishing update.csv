We drove back south to the Deer Lake Rd but the snow load was to much for our Atvs.Ok.plan 3 was a fair drive to George Lake 20 mi west of Vermioin Bay.Its a stocked spake lake.That trail had way to much snow also so we decided to walk on top of it for 1/2 mi and walk across the lake to first point.We broke through numerous but made it to lake and walked through some water to get on the ice.walking on lake was easy.Fishing was slow and most we caught were small and threw them back.Managed one good one around 17""and kept another ok one for our supper tonight.They taste fantastic. The long walk back around a mile and uphill was brutal.Breaking through way to often and our sleigh seemed to be getting heavier.lol.But made it.That will be last ice fishing attempt.Great adventure for our last trip.time to put ice gear away and hope the warm weather coming does what it's supposed to."
