6640602,Andre (wallyandre),2022-03-16 13:25:00,2274,I'm pretty sure proof of vaccination will still be mandatory and they will continue to promote ArrivCan

6640610,guidedfishing,2022-03-16 13:31:00,531,"https://www.reuters.com/world/americ...ws-2022-03-16/ Supposed to announced tomorrow ""Thursday"" that pre arrival screening will no longer be required at the end of March. for airline and ground border crossings. I did not see any discussion on proof of vaccination or random testing being mentioned in any context. That is a positive development either way."
6640612,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2022-03-16 13:33:00,629,"Hoping the Canadians will allow me to ""X"", through a land ""Port of Entry"", with only my Passport & Current Vaccination Card, & with the same credentials, continuing to be allowed to ""X"" the International Border by water, as in 2021."
6640614,MikeAnkeny,2022-03-16 13:35:00,67,Wow! Great news. Logistics just got easier. Our group might self test ourselves just to avoid a bad situation at camp.
6640628,7 Mag,2022-03-16 14:05:00,1887,That's great news!
6640638,combine_billy,2022-03-16 14:28:00,151,Progress!!
6640652,Obabikon,2022-03-16 14:44:00,2370,"A few additional things... 1st - I am guessing, but I do not believe the arrivecan app is going anywhere. They want to streamline the border crossing process. By filling this out, the officer does not have to ask these questions when you get there. I am guessing it is here to stay. 2nd - the ""random"" testing at the border is still in place. I do not know when that will be removed, but from my understanding... it is not being removed on March 31. 3rd - being vaccinated is still a requirement. I would guess that vaccination requirements are here for at least the next 6 months. They might lift sooner, but that's my guess. For those of you concerned with remote border crossings... I don't believe those will be reinstated until all proof of vaccination is lifted."
6640658,proguidedream,2022-03-16 15:00:00,345,"hopefully april 1st is a go , but hope that is not to soon for them to flip flop back to testing or closing before summer hits... the random testing people on arrivial at airports is costing Canada millions of $ , i dont think they would be bothered with the testing at land border. especially if they know you are going to a secluded camp. UNLESS they see signs you look ill.. OR if they have to do 50 a day or something as a requirement."
6640664,gbeyes,2022-03-16 15:08:00,21,"can anyone elaborate or have experience on the rules for unvaxed kids? 12-17 age group. from what i read online they would need to do 14 day quarantine? we would be very much quarantined in our outpost but dont plan to stay for 14 days, i would love to but cannot. hoping things continue to loosen up and are finally able to do our dream family vacation."
6640538,Obabikon,2022-03-16 11:16:00,2370,"OK I was informed today that pre-arrival testing is going to be abolished by April 1. Currently there is still the chance of random testing at the border, but you do not have to schedule a PCR or antigen test prior.I want to add that children under the age of 18 do not require vaccination if they are traveling with a fully vaccinated adult. The adult must be their parent, grandparent, Tudor (I do not understand this option ), or legal guardian"
6640540,Eckohlt,2022-03-16 11:22:00,3685,Any word if we need to fill out arrive Canada app??
6640546,kettyspanky,2022-03-16 11:47:00,271,This is great news. It will be less stress for some people and less hassle for everyone.
6640550,Hewhocookstomuch,2022-03-16 11:51:00,66,This is wonderful news. Since I travel from Virginia to my base camp in Minnesota three days prior to crossing. I had a small window for taking the test. Great news. Finally getting back to Saint Joe after four years of suffering.
6640552,Eckohlt,2022-03-16 11:55:00,3685,Hope this isn't a April fools jokeÂ”still wonder about arrive can app?
6640560,Golden Eagle,2022-03-16 12:02:00,2642,Thanks to a former Murray State Racer for bringing good news.
6640570,elway12,2022-03-16 12:41:00,335,Awesome!!! One less thing to have to do and worry about.
6640590,rosh1,2022-03-16 12:53:00,275,Great news! I was heading up the 30th maybe wait until the first. Thanks for update.
6640592,That Minnesota guy,2022-03-16 12:54:00,8293,Proof of vaccination still required?
6640600,walleye IA,2022-03-16 13:20:00,129,Yes!!!! Please be true!!!
