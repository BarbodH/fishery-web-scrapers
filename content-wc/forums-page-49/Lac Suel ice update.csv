6653080,Eckohlt,2022-05-02 07:28:00,3685,[QUOTE=prov1800;6653052]So imagine a 100 to 200 miles north of you john there's much more than 30 inches?
6653086,prov1800,2022-05-02 07:50:00,5010,[QUOTE=Eckohlt;6653080]It tends to be about the same up north as down here.But will more than likely have warmer temps bit south.Need constant temps right now to open up some areas and wind to be able to move ice sheets around.next 2 weeks pretty criticle
6653340,Skywagon,2022-05-03 08:23:00,1106,"I pulled the second shack off the ice today (May 3rd). There is still lots of slush, but not too thick and the in-between layer of water seems to have gone down to just a couple of inches. The ice is lifting and several air holes have appeared, there is still probably 2 feet of ice. This is latest I have ever had an ice shack out, it is an unusual year."

6652874,prov1800,2022-05-01 14:41:00,5010,Drive ins no problem and they have planes to get to all outposts and do what's needed.Just need a sweeping and dusting.Everything else will be fine. Just need to get water going.Just need to get rid of ice.
6652880,Eckohlt,2022-05-01 15:04:00,3685,"Fix all the leaky boats,get the motors to run,lots of things could have happend over the winter,don't know until they survey the outpost,you know,,,damage control."
6652882,prov1800,2022-05-01 15:13:00,5010,Could have a couple of issues i guess. Never been in a leaky boat at any of Clarks outposts.They take care of things in the fall as they close up.So easier start up.His nephew Chris will be putting boats in the water and takes care of any issues.Amazing guy.
