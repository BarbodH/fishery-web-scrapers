6654030,Eckohlt,2022-05-06 05:24:00,3685,"Good vid,that's a crap load of ice yet,, (wow)"
6654034,Twodogs,2022-05-06 05:41:00,115,Wow that is un believable ...I have fished Lac des Mille Lac for 40 years...we always went the second week of season till conditions like this....snow.. ice...cold..(beer stayed very cold setting outside of cabin though)
6654100,Eckohlt,2022-05-06 09:03:00,3685,Caught plenty of 30 inch eyes on lac des as a kid n teen.
6654114,Lazy Fisherman,2022-05-06 09:45:00,276,I also fished Lac des Mille Lacs a few times. I think the first trip was 1969.
6654120,Eckohlt,2022-05-06 09:56:00,3685,"I was 7 years old when I first went 1961,addicted ever since,but that's a good addiction."
6653938,Golden Eagle,2022-05-05 15:56:00,2642,"I'm always packed. Several times in late September and early October I've made a phone call late Wednesday afternoon, found an empty seat on a floatplane, then out of my driveway at 4:00 AM next morning. No alarm clock needed. One dummy in the boat is often better than two."
6653942,Eckohlt,2022-05-05 16:13:00,3685,"just be smart enough to keep the plug in the boat,if your above water you'll slay'em."
6653950,Golden Eagle,2022-05-05 16:23:00,2642,"I've tried it both ways. I like plug in. Better. This might be a good year to stay two weeks. May 2015, I spent 3 weeks in camp. It was a great time of many changes. All good. Began during walleye spawn and finished by fishing for walleyes and pikes in a couple of spots where shiners were spawning."
6653954,Eckohlt,2022-05-05 16:28:00,3685,"If I had your money n time i would defiantly go for the long haul,you going to vermillion?"
6653958,Eckohlt,2022-05-05 16:32:00,3685,"If I ever jump in the boat with ya,we can be dumb n dumber,I'll be the first guy lol"
6653970,Golden Eagle,2022-05-05 17:41:00,2642,sent pm
6653990,ia bhtr,2022-05-05 18:38:00,212,"Now thats funny right there !! , Thanks for the chuckle"
6653996,N_of_Quibell,2022-05-05 18:54:00,151,"Great question - and nope, I haven't figured it out yet. When you zoom in or out, the base map with names will appear briefly, but I haven't figured out how to toggle between the base map and imagery - if anyone knows, please let us know! Denny"
6654008,Golden Eagle,2022-05-05 20:27:00,2642,Nothing worse than fishing with a smart guy who requires constant reinforcement.
6654018,Eckohlt,2022-05-06 04:01:00,3685,"A big streak of warm weather coming to Ontario,that could do some serious melting on those big ice cubes!"
6653804,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-05-04 23:39:00,240,"Last summer's trip got canceled due to forest fires in the Red Lake region. In talking with our outfitter yesterday, they expressed concern that early season fly-in trips are going to be pushed back or cancelled due to thick ice on the outpost lakes in or near the Woodland Caribou Provincial Park. We are due to be flown into Malette Lake on May 25. I know conditions can change quickly, but this is a definite damper on the enthusiasm. We need 7-10 days of warm, sunny weather and I don't know that we are going to get it....."
6653806,RichA$1970,2022-05-04 23:46:00,1159,"Forest fires cost me a trip last September around 110 m N of Red Lake. One thing we can’t control is Mother Nature. Hope for the best as everyone wants to go and if anyone gets bumped, it’s not the outfitter’s fault so try to work with them as they need the $$$$ more than we need the trip."
6653820,Eckohlt,2022-05-05 04:33:00,3685,"I have friends that book a house boat on seul for opener,they've been bitten more than once cause of the ice."
6653822,walleyecheek,2022-05-05 04:42:00,2231,Just leave the boats at home and bring the LazerLite with the Milwaukee Fuel and you'll be fine .
6653830,Obabikon,2022-05-05 06:15:00,2370,"Lake of the Woods will be open by Monday (guessing). I don't know where all the other lakes are in ice out process, but there's warm weather in the area."
6653868,Hook_settr,2022-05-05 10:15:00,127,"Hi Jared-How would ice out next Monday compare to average? Ahead of, behind or on schedule for an average year?"
6653878,vteye3,2022-05-05 11:15:00,496,Forecast is promising next week. I've been watching the weather like a hawk.
6653920,N_of_Quibell,2022-05-05 15:08:00,151,"To keep an eye on your favorite lake, I highly recommend Sentinel Playground (can be found with a simple search). In the ""go to"" box, type in the closest town, such as Dryden, Ont, and then select it when it pops up on the menu. Use the calendar to make sure you know what day you are viewing. The satellite imagery resolution is pretty darn good unless there's a lot of cloud cover. Denny"
6653930,Golden Eagle,2022-05-05 15:44:00,2642,"Thanks for this one. Is there a way to bring up and hold a map that shows lake names? I've tried, but it hasn't worked for me."
6653936,Eckohlt,2022-05-05 15:51:00,3685,Golden eagle you ready to?your almost up to bat.
