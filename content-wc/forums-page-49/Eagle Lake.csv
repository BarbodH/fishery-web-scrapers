6654258,prov1800,2022-05-06 16:56:00,5010,Hope your right Gord.I guide on the opener.Keeping fingers crossed.I ice fished few days ago and that made me skeptical about ice out with the amount of ice there was.But there will be some open water someplace.Keep a eye out on Long Lake when that goes Eagle goes a week later.
