6653688,prov1800,2022-05-04 12:23:00,5010,Carter Lake up the north arm of Clay Lake will open quick.And Anishinabi Lake Lodge iced in but lots of dark spots and some water on shoreline.
6653692,Eckohlt,2022-05-04 12:52:00,3685,"Looks like carter could get some opener action,can you get boats in there??"
6653694,prov1800,2022-05-04 13:13:00,5010,Yup.from northstar camp straight north to Carter creek will be open If day most of Clay Lake will open due to 25 mi of current.water gets super high in spring tgere.we would normally be fishing in the bush the water gets so high there.
6653696,Eckohlt,2022-05-04 13:18:00,3685,That probably means plenty snag if your up in the brush.
6653700,prov1800,2022-05-04 13:39:00,5010,Actually not bad.But have to use weedless jigs.Which I have lots of and there expensive.lol.Amazing catching fish in that stuff.
