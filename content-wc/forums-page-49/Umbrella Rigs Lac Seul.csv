6653134,Eckohlt,2022-05-02 10:00:00,3685,Aren't they all pretty much the same?maybe I should be asking Johnny deep that.
6652714,maddogg,2022-05-01 07:06:00,178,I don't use it anymore I got sick of taking 5- 36in. northerns off it.
6652742,N_of_Quibell,2022-05-01 08:36:00,151,"From p11 of the 2022 Ontario regs:Hook  A hook includes a single-pointed or multiple-pointed hook on a common shaft but does not include a snagger or spring gaff. The number of hooks includes any single-pointed or multiple-pointed hooks that are part of a lure. Hooks and Lines  An angler may use only one line, unless otherwise stated in the regulations. Two lines may be used when angling from a boat in parts of the Great Lakes and for ice fishing in many areas. A fishing line must not have more than four hooks attached. My guess is the pictured rig is over the legal hook count. But just my guess... Denny"
6652750,Eckohlt,2022-05-01 09:28:00,3685,"By the looks of the picture if you caught a walleye on every hook you be over the limit,or if one fish gobbled up the five baits at once,he's a gone'r."
6652756,PRO-V16,2022-05-01 09:36:00,454,I apologize for referring to the wrong rig. After seeing the picture I realized mine was called a Christmas Tree rig. I'm getting old I guess.&#x1f644;
6652758,N_of_Quibell,2022-05-01 09:43:00,151,"If I recall correctly, someone associated with a lodge on Eagle Lake got pinched a few years ago for having more that 1 line in the water at a time. Their argument was that on average they did not, and that their lawyer said it was okay. One could make a similar argument with umbrella rigs, probably with about the same degree of success."
6652798,Wrktfsh,2022-05-01 11:57:00,492,Depends on how many hooks you put on it. You can swap out hooks for spinner blades for flashers
6652814,Eckohlt,2022-05-01 12:39:00,3685,Was the lawyer on the trip also??
6652872,tandm,2022-05-01 14:39:00,679,"How can that keep you dry, especially when you're in a water hazard?"
6652904,Yellowfin123,2022-05-01 16:35:00,2182,"there is 3 different umbrellas, or alabama rigs, same thing.. 1 is like the pic in the earlier post, the 1 in the pack is the same thing but with built in spinner blades, then the big one lol i coulda swore i saw a post couple months ago and pro v said it 4 hooks in ontario but it really doesn't matter, you just rig it with teasers if not sure and run a 4-5 inch leader on the middle eye and thats the trailer, all fish love to chase a school, and 95% of the time the fish will hit the trailer running 5 "" behind... just rig the swim baits for how many you want hookless, you can take a jig head and cut the hook off but leave the barb on the shank that holds the swimbait"
6653098,maddogg,2022-05-02 08:38:00,178,What time is it?Time to get a new lawyer.
6652496,Ronr81!,2022-04-30 10:07:00,15,Are umbrella rigs legal? I will be fishing on Lac Seul. At one time there was a limit to how many hooks you could have and I thought perhaps it was 3 or 4. But that was a long time ago.
6652522,prov1800,2022-04-30 12:33:00,5010,I think it's 3.
6652576,Eckohlt,2022-04-30 16:32:00,3685,What the heck is a umbrella rig??
6652580,walleyecheek,2022-04-30 16:38:00,2231,"I think it's like a golfer's umbrella. Your allowed three in the boat , but only if it's raining !"
6652586,RichA$1970,2022-04-30 17:04:00,1159,A snag machine if there’s a lot of cover & structure in the water.
6652596,Laketripper,2022-04-30 17:16:00,103,Let's keep it simple here folks...one barbless hook with the bait presentation of your choice.
6652602,Eckohlt,2022-04-30 17:46:00,3685,I'll stick with the sunny day rig.But thanks guys for your input.Sure learn a lot here on WC.Umbrella rig sounds like something WC fields would come up with if you ask me.
6652630,Laketripper,2022-04-30 19:09:00,103,By the way...that brought a chuckle on.
6652660,PRO-V16,2022-04-30 22:21:00,454,I have an umbrella rig I bought over 30 years ago for crappie fishing on Obabikon Lake. Never did use it. One hook at end of line and two more hooks dangling from wires attached to the rig sticking out horizontally a couple inches. Friends up there said it was quite the fight if you got two or three crappies on at once.
6652710,Wrktfsh,2022-05-01 06:47:00,492,Umbrella rig
