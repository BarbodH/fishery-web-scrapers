6653038,Hook_settr,2022-05-02 06:25:00,127,Typically my group stops at the LCBO and picks up an extra case of beer. This year we will need eggs too. Does anyone know if we can get both beer and eggs at the Beaver Mills Market? Or will we need to make two stops?Thanks!

6653048,prov1900,2022-05-02 06:40:00,544,Two stops. Beer (and all alcohol) are through the LCBO (and/or Beer Store) only.
6653060,Hook_settr,2022-05-02 06:53:00,127,That’s what I thought but wanted it confirmed. Appreciate it!
6653066,Hook_settr,2022-05-02 06:57:00,127,I like the way you think but I would like to have some eggs with it. We joke all the time that our diet the week we are in Canada would be a dietitians perfect example…of what not to do.

6653074,Eckohlt,2022-05-02 07:22:00,3685,"Agree.it be kinda tough to go through the week without eggs,good luck on the trip and that goes to everyone!"
6653592,Riding high,2022-05-04 02:07:00,69,The grocery store by Morson has beer and liquor the grocery store on 105 by Perreault falls has beer and liquor not sure if your going by them. But beavers mills does not. We stop at both in Rainy River don't take long. Now that the one in morson has booze we may just make one stop there.
6653594,Hook_settr,2022-05-04 02:51:00,127,"I assume you are talking about J&J General Store on the east side of the road? If so, that’s good to know. We will be driving right by there on our way to Mylie’s. Justin posted on Facebook after I started this thread that he will have eggs for sale at the lodge. Might just get them from him. Easier for us and after Covid, the lodges can use all the revenue they can get.Appreciate the tip!Hook_settr"
6653742,Riding high,2022-05-04 17:02:00,69,Yeap the new one on the east side. No kokanee but I get gibsons finest whiskey. Nice place with a good selection.
