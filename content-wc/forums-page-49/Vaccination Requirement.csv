6651064,runuts2,2022-04-26 08:37:00,25,"Already had shots and 2 boosters, zero side effects. If you love fishing in Canada you will need to be vaxed to enter. Don't expect anything to change for the foreseeable future. Get the shot."
6651066,That Minnesota guy,2022-04-26 08:40:00,8293,My house is 3 miles or so South of the crossing / customs. I would expect traffic to be backed up to my house every Friday. The border and businesses of International Falls are open and waiting!
6651078,v-bay gord,2022-04-26 09:13:00,3168,When it comes to my health I don't refuse a solution because there isn't a one time fix. Ask any diabetic.
6651126,CI_Guy,2022-04-26 11:11:00,2118,When I was in elementary school we got the polio vaccine every year. It started as a shot then in later years it was a sugar cube you ate.
6651150,Mr Ranger,2022-04-26 12:30:00,272,Thats awesome
6651162,emma17,2022-04-26 12:49:00,436,There's all kind of illness treated w on-going drug regimen- at the choice of the patient. Some patients choose to hop off the drug train and replace it with a lifestyle change.
6651164,andersaki,2022-04-26 12:49:00,1426,"When I got sent to Vietnam 50 some odd years ago we walked in a line where corpsmen injected us with what seemed like 14 different vaccines, inoculations and who knows what else. That was the least of our worries."
6651178,maddogg,2022-04-26 13:57:00,178,Same for me only I didn't make it to Vietnam.Thanks for your service.
6651190,HeHooksHimself,2022-04-26 14:57:00,725,Your polio vaccine made you immune from polio. They tested it for many years before offering it to the public. Apples and oranges.
6651196,rjthehunter,2022-04-26 15:22:00,154,"Bingo! Go to Vermillion or Rainy. Amazing fisheries, and you don't have to get poked to go!"
6650870,Benh,2022-04-25 17:22:00,3,Does anyone have any insight or thoughts as to weather the vaccination requirement will remain in force for the entire summer? Trip planned for early July my son and I along with 6 others are not vaccinated nor do we plan to get vaccinatedâ€¦ try trying to decide if we should book somewhere heee in the states? And Cancel Canada
6650876,That Minnesota guy,2022-04-25 17:30:00,8293,Book somewhere else. You aren't getting into Canada without being jabbed.
6650888,Eckohlt,2022-04-25 18:04:00,3685,You might be fishing the states forever.Good thing I'm not in that position.
6650926,Springstead,2022-04-25 19:10:00,12,"I would say make other plans for this year definately. Any Canadian outfitter will not even want to accept a reservation knowing that their guest are not vaccinated. It's not fair to them and they have already suffered enough during these last two years. I have a couple of friends in my group that will not get vaccinated so they make other plans. All the best,"
6651012,v-bay gord,2022-04-26 06:33:00,3168,"As long as Covid, or any strain or variant of it are around I'm sure the vaccination requirment will be in place."
6651020,HeHooksHimself,2022-04-26 06:58:00,725,"It does not have to be good science or common sense, it just is what it is. My wife and I are going to Norway via cruise in June, shortly after our guy's trip to Sunset Country for opening week, and they require a booster on top of the vax (depending on dates of original jabs). We had to decide what was important to us. My wife's family is prone to clots so we really had to weigh the options but decided that travel was more important to us at our age. I guess that is the dilemma for everyone. It should be an individual decision but ""the greater good"" seems to be the dominant philosophy these days. Easy to say but almost impossible to implement because who should the arbiter? Anyway, I am sure looking forward to fishing next month! Hooks"
6651038,Eyesore,2022-04-26 07:43:00,455,"I can only imagine the mind f that a guy must go through when he doesn't want the jab but reluctantly does take the jab after being persuaded by others in the group of their annual week long trip to Cantada, then after getting home having concerns of the numerous adverse side effects for the next 51 weeks and beyond."
6651044,Eckohlt,2022-04-26 08:09:00,3685,"I think after hammering fish for a week in Canada,he's probably more than happy to get the jab,he's probably ready for round 2 or 3."
6651046,v-bay gord,2022-04-26 08:09:00,3168,"Yes, I'm still fretting over the polio vaccine I took 60 years ago. When will the madness end!"
6651060,emma17,2022-04-26 08:35:00,436,And how many Polio boosters have you been required to have (and how many future jabs will you be required to have) because that original jab didn't work quite as well as thought?
