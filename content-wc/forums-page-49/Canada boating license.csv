6652988,ai54,2022-05-02 01:14:00,1,"Yes - in Canada all operators of a pleasure craft need proof of competency. A pleasure craft operator card is one of the 4 proofs of competency that Transport Canada recognizes. From the Transport Canada website :Proof of competency can be any of the following: - A Pleasure Craft Operator Card (PCOC); - A certificate that states you have successfully completed a boating safety course in Canada prior to April 1, 1999; - A completed and signed boat rental safety checklist (applicable only for rental period); or - A specified marine certificate or equivalency recognized by Transport Canada.I got my Canadian boating license from MyBoatCard.com"

6653158,David Anderson,2022-05-02 11:52:00,2073,"Juls, I am going back through some posts and seen your response. This is so true, heck I'll bet half the people don't even know the difference between Port and Starboard. Last year at Mazurik Landing a Coast Guard vessel was loading on their trailer when I loaded. It was rough and I'm sure the 2 younger guys were itching to do something productive so they informed me they were going to do a boat inspection. I told them that I would be grateful if they did that, it would confirm that my preparation for fishing on Erie was accurate. We went through the entire inspection and at the end the guy said that they were not going to have to ticket me for any violations. I guess I figured a warning if they found something. They were nice, I thanked them for verifying my Coast Guard requirements status, with that I got a signed copy of the inspection that was good for 1 year. I agree that a boaters safety course would be great."
6643790,Huntindave,2022-03-28 12:52:00,2194,I agree. I will add that even many adults don't have any clue about what the rules of the water are.
6643792,Mr Ranger,2022-03-28 13:41:00,272,Our camp started enforcing this a number of years back. We rent boats and you either need to have a boaters safety certificate which I did or you need to fill out and sign a camp form prior to operating a boat. Not a big deal and agree with others it is a worthwhile thing to do.
6643800,proguidedream,2022-03-28 14:21:00,345,"theres some good stuff in the course. especially on coastal waters and bouey identification. waste of money ? meh , its all relative to how you look at things. if your fishing a reef on the wrong side of a bouey and a boat crusing thinks your fishing there must be the correct side and clips the reef then hits you.... well it might have been worth that money if the guy took the course and knew the correc side before guessing. To me , i hope every boater has took some kind of course and always has safety in mind."
6643804,v-bay gord,2022-03-28 14:33:00,3168,Not sure if spending 10 minutes to fill out a rental checklist form is going to make you a good boat operator...but better than nothing I suppose.
6643814,Iceshack05,2022-03-28 15:27:00,31,"I challenged the test and passed similar to MrWalleye in and around 2004 at the Winnipeg Boat show. I've also had to get a replacement card as mine pretty much disintegrated into pcs as well. Nowadays, you can simply do the course and test online at home to obtain your boating license card. So you can literally have someone else do the test for you simply to have the 'card'. 'Right or wrong' all boaters need to learn to respect the waterways, hazards and other boaters & pwc's!"
6643846,Eckohlt,2022-03-28 16:57:00,3685,"I make sure and look both ways on flyin lakes,you never know who's gonna run a red light."
6643966,Iceshack05,2022-03-29 06:26:00,31,Gotta get to that fishing spot quick!!!
6644040,Donscs,2022-03-29 10:29:00,379,"I took a Boater Safety Course over 30 years ago put on by the Coast Guard Auxiliary. Still have the Certificate and still get a discount on my boat insurance for having taken the course. This past year was nuts on the lake, a lot of new boaters. I'm fortunate being retired so I only go out during the week except in the early spring and late fall, the pleasure boaters just don't like the cold weather thank goodness. We did make a mistake one year and forgot it was Jobbie Nooner day and we were fishing one of the north channels on Lake St Clair. While we were trying to jig boats were screaming by us one after another at 9:00 AM on a Friday morning, they start that party very early in the day. If you're not familiar with Jobbie Nooner here's a link, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F13h-SnsD74. Wonder how many of those boaters took a Boater Safety Course? I have some neighbors who will go out on the lake on weekends to just swim or lay in the sun. The places they like to anchor and swim were very crowded last year and even had idiots driving Wave Runners very fast in between boats with all kinds of people in the water, just nuts. Like Juls said one of the most annoying things to me is so many people don't know, or care, who has the right of way, such a simple thing to know and do. The good news is I can get away from an awful lot of boaters this year and cross the Canadian border by boat and fish Ontario waters. A lot of guys won't spend the money for a Canadian fishing license and the pleasure boaters really don't cross that much. Just going to cost me a bit more in gas. Donscs"
6644708,NWBearcatgrad,2022-03-31 16:34:00,36,We have been asked for yrs to verify we have our cards when we fly in...but never had to show them. We all have them in our group. I can navigate the MS River with mine ðŸ¤£
6644720,guidedfishing,2022-03-31 16:59:00,531,"You drive a camp boat you need a check list or certificate. If your a non-resident and drive your own non Canadian registered boat you have a 45 day window. ""Non-residents who are operating a non-Canadian registered vessel in Canada for up to 45 days do not require proof of competency. However, non-residents who operate a Canadian-registered vessel in Canada must carry proof of competency on board at all times. Proof of residency must also be carried on board during operation."" As stated it is sure a good thing to understand right of way, navigational buoys when present and your responsibilities when operating a powered boat. A little common sense never hurts either. Be nice, if I see someone fishing and they are in my general path, I go out of my way to go around them, and or come of plane as well."
6643436,Joek3,2022-03-27 06:42:00,244,"Ok, been going to canada for 20 years. Talking to a guy at a bar who informs me of the Â“newÂ” requirement this year for any operator of a boat to have a permit. So I google it and find this requirement has been in place since 2009 subject to a $250 fine. Been checked by Canadian authorities 5x minimum on water and have never been asked for this. Have I been living under a rock? Never had an outfitter mention it either. Do you all have this permit?"
6643444,Thalweg,2022-03-27 07:29:00,243,"From a Canadian FAQ site - https://tc.canada.ca/en/marine-trans...-card-pcoc-faq Do the Competency of Operators of Pleasure Craft Regulations apply to non-residents? The Regulations apply to non-residents if: They operate their pleasure craft in Canadian waters for more than 44 consecutive days or, They operate a pleasure craft that is licensed or registered in Canada (including rented or chartered boats). The Regulations do not apply to non-residents who operate their pleasure craft (licensed in a country other than Canada) in Canadian waters for less than 45 consecutive days. Please note that a proof of residence will be required on board at all times. If you require more information on how Canadian requirements apply to non-residents visit the Requirements for Foreign Recreational Boaters In Canadian Waters. What is acceptable proof of competency for non-residents? For non-residents, proof of competency can take one of three forms: A Pleasure Craft Operator Card; A completed boat rental safety checklist (for power-driven rental boats); or, An operator card or equivalent which meets the requirements of their state or country."
6643446,Juls,2022-03-27 07:45:00,13414,"Personally, I think everyone that owns a boat should take a boater's safety course. I run into so many that don't know the simplest rule of who has the right of way. Here on Lake Erie...the worst are the big giant pleasure boats that run back and forth to the islands...and, it's obvious that many are clueless, or just think that because they have the bigger boat, that they have the right of way. I don't trust any of them, to know, or do the right thing out there. If you only have to know one rule....let it be that whoever is crossing your bow from the starboard side, has the right of way....whether you're on plane or just trolling. The rule doesn't change with how fast you're going. BoatUS has a free boater's safety course too, and it's required for those born after a certain date to operate a boat. So, it's not just Canada that feels it's a necessity."
6643452,Joek3,2022-03-27 07:50:00,244,Great info. Thanks to all.
6643456,bbheli,2022-03-27 08:04:00,1387,The problem is the kids driving there Daddy's power boat don't even know what starboard side is. I agree anyone that operates a boat should have to take a class and pass a test. The waterway should be stricter than the roadways.
6643518,mrwalleye5,2022-03-27 12:05:00,1922,"I'm from Canada, Manitoba to be more specific. I was at a boat show in Winnipeg, I believe it was around 2004, just as the Â“boat licenceÂ” thing was coming into effect. I challenged the test. If I didn't pass I didn't have to pay. I passed, paid $35. Was sent a plastic card a few weeks later which I placed in my wallet in a convenient place to be able to wip it out every time I was visited by the authorities on the water. Never happened, ever. I asked the game wardens once if they wanted to see it and they said no, RCMP are the only ones that will want to see it. Many years later I was stopped by the game wardens and believe it or not the RCMP were with them. I had to ask if they wanted to see it, they kinda shrugged and said Â“ I guess, if you got itÂ” they glanced at it, hardly looking and that was it. A year or two later the card started to crumble to piece so I inquired about a new replacement card and that was going to cost me $50. I gathered the pieces and put them in a ziplock baggy. Later I taped them together with some wide scotch tape and put them back in my wallet, never to be taken out of my wallet again and that will have to do until my boating days are done. What a complete waste of money. I have been to probably 15 fly in fish trips and not one lodge asked if I had such a thing."
6643522,Wawajake,2022-03-27 12:29:00,413,In past ten years I have been asked twice to show boat license card by the MNR on local inland lakes in Algoma region. I keep it in my tackle box now and cell phone has pic of my fishing license. So yes it is asked for at times.
6643696,Iceshack05,2022-03-28 07:02:00,31,I have been asked 3 times for it on LOTW(in approx. 10 years). All 3 times has been by OPP.
6643778,prov1800,2022-03-28 11:55:00,5010,So about 20 years ago this boating license came into effect.Had a instructor come to my shop and had a bunch of friends come and we all took the course paid our money and got the card.So it's a pleasure craft card meaning when I take the family out fishing or tubing I need that card.If I guide during the day I don't need it.I have been asked to show the card a couple of times both pleasure and work.If iam guiding I tell tgem usually the OPP are the ones that ask that iam working and don't need to show it.Passing tgat test means nothing to me.I see so many people with cards on the water that shouldn't be out there.Some of the tourists that come here are scary.lol.
6643784,Eckohlt,2022-03-28 12:32:00,3685,Scary looking or???
