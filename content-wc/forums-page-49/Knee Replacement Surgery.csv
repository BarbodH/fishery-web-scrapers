Just now starting to walk and function ""normally"" Was on NWB restrictions for 13 weeks, and have had roughly 8 weeks of PT 3x a week since. My future appears to be a TKR. From my experience any and ALL movement pays dividends done the long stretch! Lack of leads to rapid atrophy and range of motion. I am pushing to get 100 degrees now, up from 30 eight weeks ago. Goal is at least 120. Gotta be able to get in and out of the boat p Good luck to all you! Its hard, but beats the alternative. Fishing from the bank lacks luster compared to being in the boat."
6647350,martinbns,2022-04-12 17:02:00,1520,"This thread kind of went away but I thought I would update. 5 months and 7 days, had my last PT appointment today, am bending to 138* and can straighten completely. Starting doing stairs two at a time a bit a few weeks ago, doing two stairs hurts less than one did 2 months ago. Sunday I hit a full bucket of balls without a knee brace for the first time since 2008. My knee is still swollen a bit, about 1.5 cm over my right knee. Pain is now mild discomfort, we have had a brutal winter involving me slipping and going down a few times with no residual pain. Wish I had it done a few years earlier."
6647830,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-04-14 08:58:00,240,"Sounds like you are doing real well. I finished my 11 weeks of physical therapy in February. I don't have the kind of flexibility in my knee that you have, but my knee is relatively pain free, and I am walking about 4 miles a day without pain. Like a lot of others, I live in a very cold, snowy, icy climate, and this year has been really bad for freezing rain and less than optimal walking conditions. Here in Michigan's UP (west end), we have had exactly one day all year over 50 degrees. I retired at age 60 this past year, so I am able to be patient with everything. Need to get the other knee done at the end of next summer. Anyway, I am glad to hear you are on the mend. That's great news."
6649528,5richards,2022-04-20 15:59:00,131,"Sorry for joining this late but I had a total knee replacement 2 months ago -- I took the pain killers like everyone said to ""stay ahead of the pain"" but after 4 days of severe constipation even while taking pills etc to comabt that I had to go off of the meds. My pain was never more than a 2 -- the major discomfort was from the tournequit. Surgery at 8:30 in the am and home by 1 pm. My doctor believes you heal quicker at home. I did pt 3 times a week and now am down to 1 or none if I want -- Knee at 125 degrees and flat. Need to build up muscle strenght but having no pain. I am almost 72 and am currently fishing for stripers in the Delaware River in my Lund. Just wanted to let everyone know it might not be as bad as everyone thinks -- I planned for the worst but got a great outcome. Hope you heal quickly. My best!"
6654440,jiggster,2022-05-07 09:21:00,183,"Has anyone had the Mako surgery, the robotic surgery?"
6654442,martinbns,2022-05-07 09:22:00,1520,"Not me, mine was the old fashioned style"
6622418,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-01-05 09:12:00,240,"Agreed with the swelling--it is subsiding, but still there, definitely. It is great that you have 122*! I am at 115 right now, but am improving with each PT session. Good luck with everything--It feels good to be 8 weeks out, doesn't it?"
6622616,reconssd,2022-01-05 19:34:00,147,"Since everyone is updating, I might as well too. Tomorrow, Thursday Jan 6th, I'll be 9 weeks post op. ROM is 140. I elevate and ice every day. Physical therapy is beginning to wind down. I do strength training at home. The key in my opinion is to go at your pace. Your body will definitely tell you when you are doing too much. I have some swelling but not too much. My physical therapist says the clicking will stop when the swelling is gone. Definitely glad I got it done. Thankfully my left knee is rock solid so I hope I won't ever have to get it replaced. My goal is to get ROM to 145 before I'm done with therapy. This is proving challenging as the last 3 measurements have been at 140. The only real challenge I have is going down stairs straight and not on an angle. I can go up stairs without grabbing the rail, and can move fairly fast. I can go up and down ladders without any problems. The winter here has been mild so far which has been good. No slipping or sliding. Climbing in and out of a boat should be a breeze in 6 months. Have a great new year. Tight lines, sharp hooks, and safe travels."
6622652,prov1900,2022-01-06 02:20:00,544,"I've been following this thread and I too am looking at full replacement sometime as the DR put it ""when you get tired of the BS"". My question is this. Did anyone do any pre-strengthening of the legs, i.e. weight training in advance of surgery? If so, did it help with recovery? I used to be (semi) serious about weight training, running etc. Then life gets in the way and you wake up in the mid 50's....lol."
6622664,reconssd,2022-01-06 05:15:00,147,"Yes. My doctor believes in strength training before surgery. Physical therapy gave me a sheet of exercises that I needed to do before surgery. After surgery, your leg will feel like a noodle with zero strength. So anything you do before surgery will pay dividends post surgery."
6624504,martinbns,2022-01-12 17:52:00,1520,"I saw a physiotherapist prior who got me help with massage and she gave me some exercises to do primarily on the stairs which was very helpful. I saw my surgeon last thursday, he was very pleased with everything, told me the swelling could be around for a up to a year. Told me to get an exercise bike which we bought saturday. Any of you guys use an exercise bike to rehab?"
6624534,skimottaret,2022-01-13 04:13:00,40,"Exercise bike is essential in my view, great early on to help with range of motion and then later for strength and aerobic conditioning. I did half pedals just to keep legs moving. then full circles once could manage and then gradually built up minutes to hours.. Key is that bike is non load bearing and once you can walk you can mix up load bearing exercise with non load bearing on bike."
6624592,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-01-13 09:24:00,240,"Once I gave up basketball as a form of exercise, I walked several miles at least twice a day. Once I was unable to walk without pain, I scheduled the surgery. I met with a physical therapist prior to surgery, and was given a regimen of stretching/flexibility which helped a lot. That would be my strongest recommendation, that you begin (and stick with) a program that helps you strengthen and increase your flexibilty in your quads, hamstrings, and hip flexor muscles. Most guys who go through this also benefit from exercises that help increase your balance and range of motion. Weight training may or may not be something that would help you; in my case, not so much. Committing to physical therapy is probably the strongest predictor of success in this type of surgery. I just got back from a PT session, and my range of motion has increased to 122 degrees. Happy about that. My only regret is that I did not have this surgery done a few years ago. I am walking without any soreness or sign of limp, and feel very good, overall. Just prepare yourself in advance for a few rough weeks after the surgery. Everyone's experience is different, but one thing I think we could all agree upon is the pain and discomfort that follows the surgery. It doesn't last, but clear your schedule for a few weeks so that all you need to focus on is rest, recovery, and physical therapy. I am 62 days out from surgery, nearly 8 weeks."
6625216,Moondog,2022-01-15 11:19:00,362,"I am 11 years post right knee replacement. I am also a physical therapist. From my prospective as a patient and a therapist getting your knee straight day one post op is the key. You do yourself no favors by sitting in a recliner with your knee bent or in bed with a pillow under your knee. It may feel better but NOT GOOD! Use lots of ice. by ice I don't mean a towel with a bag of ice over it. Get your knee cold. Cheap ice bags from Walmart work great. Put the ice in and some water. 2 of them is even better! 20 minutes on, 20 off. It is the thawing and freezing that helps the swelling. I was 0 to 120 after day 5. The rest was cake. As for the clicking......it never goes away. It is a function of the mechanics of the new joint and is normal. After awhile you won't ""hear"" it anymore! Hope this helps."
6625242,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-01-15 12:30:00,240,"Thanks for the input, Moondog--coming from a physical therapist who has had the surgery, this is sage advice. I was all proud of myself for getting past 120 degrees in 7 weeks--you did it in 5 days. I am humbled......although now I am at 122 degrees, my PT feels I can get to 130 by the end of the month. Question: how old were you when you had the surgery? I turned 60 this year, and my surgeon remarked that I probably should have had the surgery several years ago. But, better late than never...."
6625922,Moondog,2022-01-18 11:05:00,362,"I was 57 when I had my knee replaced. Here's the deal. At surgery you should have full range of motion, that is if it is put in correctly. Post op your motion is limited by pain and swelling. Everyday that goes by that your knee isn't straight just makes it all the harder to obtain. Tissues tighten. Period. Bending comes easier. So the initial goal should be pain and swelling management and making sure you don't put things under your knee to make it bend a little and feel better. Suck it up regardless. Lots of ice. Hope this helps."
6614130,@Lunker,2021-11-29 19:40:00,835,"I wish you well in your recovery and return to a normal life. Remember ice is your friend. I had my first done in early 12/15 and the second in late 1/16. 5 1/2 years out, I have traded one form of misery - sharp bone-on-bone pain - for another - a chronic, ever-present, nagging ache. I can't figure out what hurts ..it's all artificial !!! I consulted a different surgeon a couple of years ago, not to have it fixed but in the hopes of getting an explanation or some answers. He said, anecdotally, fully 15-20% of replacement patients experience on-going, chronic stiffness and/or pain. He said Frankly, we do a $hitty job of informing people of this possible outcome. 😫 😤 🤬"
6618522,reconssd,2021-12-19 15:49:00,147,"Michigan - I know where you are coming from. When I read your post from 11-18, I was 2 weeks post op on my right knee replacement. I'm 62, 6'4, 190#. If there are two recommendations I can make to anyone who needs this surgery, get an ice machine and a CPM machine. My knee doc didn't recommend these items. But, back in 1990, I had an ACL surgery done on my right knee. I knew the importance of these tools for my recovery. I had the ice machine and cpm unit for about a month. My out of pocket cost was about $150. It was worth every penny for my recovery. The key is to ice your knee while elevating for 20 minutes every hour. And when you are not elevating your knee, your leg is in the CPM machine. Physical therapy hasn't been bad because of my at home routine. I still ice my knee every day, although I don't ice it every hour. Lastly, try not to get in the routine of comparing your recovery with the recovery data. Everyone's recovery time is different. Go at your pace. No one knows your body better than you. Is my new knee better? Too early to tell. I don't think anything will be better than the original equipment. Good luck with your recovery and hope this information can help anyone who is dealing or will be dealing with this surgery/recovery."
6618540,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2021-12-19 16:43:00,240,"Thanks for the excellent advice. I am now a bit over 5 weeks post-op, and the physical therapy and ice regiment has really helped. I am walking over 2 miles/day right now, and the pain and swelling in the affected knee has greatly diminished. My range of motion is getting better each week, thanks to the PT I get twice/week. PT is no fun, as you would no doubt agree with, but it is wonderful to know that the surgery was a success, and that things are getting better each week. I really plan on making up for lost time, Canada-fishing wise, next summer. Have got 2 trips on the books for May and June, and am looking for a third trip, if possible. Thanks again for the info. and for the feedback. I am sure a lot of guys on this forum are no doubt candidates for this surgery in the future, and there's a lot to think through before-hand. You've really helped in that regard."
6620184,emma17,2021-12-27 15:36:00,436,"Glad you're doing better. I had my left knee replaced two weeks ago today- going to first outpatient PT (they came to the house 4-5 times). The major issue I have is sciatica on the same leg. I don't know why the nerve got inflamed, but it's been 24/7. Wonder if anyone else had that experience."
6621412,martinbns,2022-01-01 13:18:00,1520,"Thought I would update. 8 weeks yesterday, I haven't been using the cane for 2 weeks, a relatively small manageable amount of pain on long stairs, can bend my knee to 122* pain free, can straighten it completely, I limped so long I have to think about not limping, was clicking pretty bad up until about a week ago, that has gone down as some of the swelling has decreased. Still pretty swollen, with ice before bed, then A535 on my hamstring and the back of my knee sleep is good. I hit a few half golf shots last week with no issue. I am probably 90%, see my Surgeon next Thursday. I think the physio work I did prior to the surgery was really helpful and my Therapist says I am doing very well. How many of you have had the clicking stick around for an extended period of time, I'm not sure if it's normal or not. Happy new years"
6621426,RottenRalph,2022-01-01 13:55:00,31,"Still have occasional clicking in both of my new knees. Notice it more if I’m walking more than just around the house tho. In stores or down the road walking, it’s pretty consistent. Just over a year since mine were done. Still some swelling too. Limp is totally gone now. That came and went with the swelling. Now I just swell up if I’m on my feet too much. These negative temps don’t help with aches."
6621428,johnboat,2022-01-01 14:37:00,2014,I never did have a click.
6621876,skimottaret,2022-01-03 09:11:00,40,"I had a bi lateral done just over a year ago and I would say first 2 days were torture, first 2 weeks difficult with sleepless nights and pain, by week 6 wounds had heeled and week 12 had made good progress with flexability and walking. by month 7 or 8 you should feel pretty almost normal. Key is to do exactly what your PT tells you, work on your gait mechanics and ROM all the time. I overdid it a few times and was set back weeks each time. The clicking will subside, I was nervous about that but seemed to slowly resolve over time. Also I found that ROM gets better quite fast but then can take ages to make small improvements but they come eventually. One thing to note is that you will need to continue with balance and pro proprioception work to really get back to normal even after you are pain free and walking / doing your normal routine. I am a ski instructor and although now pain free and improved range of movement my balance is still not there and my skiing has a long way to go. My surgeon said up to 2 years to fully regain nervous system controls. Good luck, it is worth it !!Have you tried a pillow between legs for sleep? I had a small foam I beam shaped one that did wonders. Also concur on cryocuff and I had a TENs machine which really helped eliminate drug use. In the UK we only get Ibuprofen and Paracetamol after a few weeks and being consistent with the dosing of the paracetemol even when little pain really makes a difference"
6622414,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-01-05 09:08:00,240,"Hi all--I am almost 8 weeks out from surgery, and I have to say things have gone very well. I am walking up to 3 miles a day now, no limp, just about full range of motion. Zero pain. I will again echo what others have said about PT--it is very key to moving the recovery along. My range of motion is still only 115*, I need to get to 120, before I can ""graduate"" from physical therapy. I, too, have a lot of 'clicking' going on, but was told by my surgeon that this is normal and will subside over time. I and my PT team are happy about the progress I am making. Hoping to strap on the snowshoes in a few more weeks and start hitting the trails around here. Right now, on January 5, I am very glad I had this surgery. I would not have said that 7 weeks ago, because the first few weeks are, well, miserable. I am having the other knee done at the end of next summer (after at least 3 Canada trips!)

Their therapy sounded like he!! to me.

Me, no pain whatsoever. Kneeling on it like ""back in the day"".I'm not saying I did NOTHING painful. But I went through NOTHING like they did. An trust me, my pain tolerance would be towards the low end. Like, way low.Long story short, I think hitting it hard right out of the gate is counterproductive.Good luck!"
6612904,RottenRalph,2021-11-23 23:13:00,31,"I had both done in the past year. Not at the same time. My advise is to NOT sit in a Lazyboy recliner at all after the procedure. I’m pretty certain that caused my miserable time getting both to straighten to zero, before the 12 week PT timeframe. Even with a pillow under my heels, the hamstrings still bottom out on the chair and I had a heckuva time getting all the way straight on both of them. I am surprised to hear folks actually kneeling on new knees. I was told by my surgeon that my artificial knees have plastic kneecaps and I was specifically told not to kneel directly on them or they could crack.I still have occasional clicking. No real pain at all. Just more stiffness & swelling if I’m on my feet or sitting in one spot too long (car rides especially). I ended up having some other health issue pop up so my rehab suffered a bit and I’m still not back to walking as much as I was pre- TKA. All in all, I’d say I’m glad I had them done & I consider mine both a great success…..with that said, I told the wife I hope they outlive me.

As many have stated, the physical therapy is difficult, but I am approaching it as a lifeline to a better outcome down the road. Everyone was correct about the pain meds--they help enable me to get through PT, and they are prescribed for a reason. The first 10-15 days following surgery were bad, and, at times, really bad. But I do feel I am starting to get on the other side of this now, and I am so thankful. Only bad thing about this whole process is that I know I will be going through it again next fall, on my other knee. Thanks for sharing such good info. with me and with others.
