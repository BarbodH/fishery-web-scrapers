6654526,That Minnesota guy,2022-05-07 18:13:00,8293,Thats not a good thing for the area. Doesn't sound like anybody was injured so thats a good thing.

We fish Pakwash and have navigated up to the falls many times on the Chukuni and the photo and the wash out must be where 105 goes over Caribou Creek about a half mile south of the bridge over the Chukuni. The 105 bridge over the Chukuni was replaced about 10 yrs ago with an 84-meter single span steel girder bridge - and if it had been washed out, it would take a LONG time to fix. Hopefully they will have this one fixed as quickly as they say - the article is talking about days.."
