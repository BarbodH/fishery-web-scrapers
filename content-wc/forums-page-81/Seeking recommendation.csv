One common thread runs through all the discussions, no one has a clue what will come next or when. When that is known you can be sure it will get posted here as quickly as it does everywhere else. Until then accept that you're not as in control of your life as you thought you were but you are just as much in control as you actually were."

6523838,Wallychowder,2021-02-05 12:05:00,1567,One problem ! You just let the mods know your game plan ?
6523848,Net_Man,2021-02-05 12:23:00,580,Thank you kindly for the chuckle I got from your response.

6523882,Net_Man,2021-02-05 13:00:00,580,Unfortunately news has become a interpretation of events and not as much about plain facts. When I actually see a event happen I am amazed at the interpretation of the event being expressed by certain news outlets. And the bias runs well past these 3 news networks. What is the saying? Do not believe any thing that you hear and only half of what you see.

6523892,jambi,2021-02-05 14:12:00,504,be sure to ban the minnesota man
6523908,That Minnesota guy,2021-02-05 14:46:00,8293,Thats harsh.
6523724,BrianinVA,2021-02-05 07:56:00,160,"I'm looking for a website or message board where discussions about the current public health situation, US/Canadian border status and Canadian fishing take place. Such a forum would be a huge asset to both fishermen and resort owners. Any suggestions where one might find such a place?"
6523732,Maverick31,2021-02-05 08:01:00,9,Interesting read but doesn't give me a lot of confidence that Canada will be opening the doors by our trip in June ..https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/c...?sref=17ZCpRz5
6523734,That Minnesota guy,2021-02-05 08:01:00,8293,You could always start your own. Be sure to sticky your list of resorts & lodges who have wronged somebody.
6523740,Wallychowder,2021-02-05 08:06:00,1567,Watch CNN !!!!
6523764,LoDo,2021-02-05 08:28:00,721,Let me know when you find one cause this site isn't it.
6523776,MrSimon,2021-02-05 08:57:00,922,"I think he wanted un-biased, factual information."
6523778,Wallychowder,2021-02-05 09:00:00,1567,Oh.....ok FOX NEWS then........LOL How about Facebook ?
6523804,RichA$1970,2021-02-05 10:55:00,1159,I also check this site out as it shows daily progress or lack of.
6523808,RichA$1970,2021-02-05 10:58:00,1159,"Brianâ€™s list could become more useful if 2021 is a bust. Mainly for availability, closures and if anyone joins that one infamous resort in screwing the customer."
6523832,v-bay gord,2021-02-05 11:48:00,3168,"i would suggest if you want to talk about this subject without getting nuked then change the wording. For example, the ""border"" becomes the ""hedge"". The ""virus"" becomes the ""rotten egg smell"". The vaccine, the ""filter"", etc. So, when will the hedge become passable? Probably when everyone has a filter to deal with the rotten egg smell."
