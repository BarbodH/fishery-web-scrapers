I think because the lake sets up similar to lake Erie, which I'm familiar with. I love using traditional bouncers and slow death rigs so I think these Walleye nation rigs should be dynamite."
6514716,Ltrain,2021-01-07 07:27:00,4145,"[/QUOTE] Similar, but most Erie Dearies i see are 3/4 or 5/8ths ( they do make a 1 oz though). These are 1.5 oz and have a slow death hook as a trailer to the first hook which is a treble. Plus instead of the spinner you have a prop which takes less speed to turn it. I like to move around 0.8 mph when i use a slow death rig. These 1.5 oz rigs should let me keep in touch with the bottom pretty well, look forward to using them"
6515170,eyecatcher1,2021-01-08 11:38:00,323,I agree! I've done really good with slow death rigs. If all else fails on Mille Lacs you can't go wrong with a leech under a bobber.
6515404,gordy28,2021-01-09 10:28:00,437,"I have never used anything like that but just ordered a few as I am a sucker for something new lol Have never actually used an Erie Dearie on our trips - always have a few in the tackle box but never pulled on out We have had good success with harnesses rigged with a slow death - traditional Colorado blades, butterfly blades and on our last trip I tied some up with Smile blades I really liked them - couldn't say they caught more fish that a regular hook but definitely used less worms that w traditional, much easier to unhook than a double hook harness and didn't feel like they were any easier for fish to shake off Cheers Andrew"

6513024,CiscoKid,2021-01-01 14:37:00,28,"Has anyone fished with the Walleye Nation Creations Death Jig Rig? It is advertised as a bottom bouncer and harness all in one. Looks interesting to me, although t not sure how different than an Erie Dearie?? I am always looking for trolling search tactics to use and if I am being honest, bottom bouncing rigs seems to be a little bit of a hassle for the novice fisherman (me). I like to keep things as simple as possible, but I also like to catch fish.I do jig when I find them, but also find that on windy days, trolling is just easier than trying to position a boat for jigging when anchoring is not an option (too deep).Fishing mid-August when most eyes are 20-25' on the particular lake I take my trip. https://www.fishusa.com/Walleye-Nati...SABEgK0svD_BwE"
6513038,Eckohlt,2021-01-01 15:50:00,3685,"The only death rig I use when fishing is called a fillet knife rig,in most cases it causes death to the eaters"
6513058,Pickypickerel,2021-01-01 16:22:00,151,When i first started going to CANADA i dragged along my 50# tackle bag. Didn't know any better. Now its Northland fireball jigs and a piece of nightcrawler. You dont need all that extra Hardware !!!!!!!
6513176,Ltrain,2021-01-02 06:41:00,4145,"Well thanks you just made me spend some money, lol Going to try them on Mille lacs this year. I love slow death rigs so I will see if this compares favorably"

6514674,Ltrain,2021-01-06 22:16:00,4145,"I'll be there for 2 weeks in the middle of June, staying at Fishers, can't wait!"
6514700,pjshorthorn,2021-01-07 05:22:00,5654,"I make my own slow death rigs for about $.80 each instead of paying $4.99 each. My cost includes all of the components plus any shipping to get them to the house. I'll normally tie up 75- 100 a season and give a bunch away for folks to try out and see what patterns work the best. They are pretty simple,but I have decent luck using them. PjShorthorn"
