6519074,4x4bassin,2021-01-21 10:46:00,17,A couple friends and I did another trip up to NW Ontario to the outstanding fishery called Uchi Lake . Stayed at Uchi Lake Lodge and had a blast.The Uchi Lake Lodge family welcomed us back with open arms and again great times and fantastic fishing.I won’t get into details about the lodge itself because everything has been said on here before in previous reports but I will say that it is still an awesome place with a couple improvements to the cabins/docks and boardwalks . Boats are great and have reliable brand new Yamaha 4 strokes to power them. Due to this crazy virus there has hardly been anyone at the lodge so this was a great opportunity for us to fish some “unfished waters” and we were not disappointed. I didn’t really keep count but 80-100 walleye per boat a day was not a problem with the average size being 18”-20” The biggest walleye of the trip was a 27”er with several 23”-25” walleye caught. Lures of choice that week were the usual 1/4 oz jig in pink/white or lime/chartreuse with a 1/2 night crawler or trolled rapalas in various colours.Last time we were at Uchi we really didn’t target pike which was unfortunate and I spent last winter planning over maps and coming up with a couple patterns to target this untapped resource and we were not disappointed. We caught several pike over 35” and I lost one in the net boatside that was an easy 40” fish (not one of my most shining fishing moments ....lol) Anyways enough of the chat and let the pictures to the talking.....hope you enjoy Walleye pictures
