6522342,Billswest,2021-01-31 12:20:00,32,"Booked a trip with Walsten Outfitters to fish the Lake in mid-June. Wondering if anyone has information on fishing the Lake based on past experiences, or likewise thoughts you'd like o share about the outfitter and/or the outpost cabin on the Lake.Seven of us are going, teens and young adults, and this one old geezer, me. Looking forward to he week long trip, and hopeful that the border will be back open by mid-June when we are to be there. Any thoughts, advice, or otherwise would be much appreciated. Thanks"

We walked through the cabins on Chase back at that time just to check them out, they were very basic, but 20 years later there could have been a lot of improvements. Walsten's have been around for a long time, they used to be a good outfitter, nice planes, have not heard a lot about them lately. I never bothered fishing Chase, but the fishing was very good on Eagle, typical dark water lakes, I don't remember catching any walleye over 24"". Don't get your hopes up for the border to be open for tourists in June 2021, it just isn't going to happen. Feel free to message me for more information."

We caught them on bare jigs. Going east through Midway like into North Eagle lake there is a rock bluff to the North before you get into N. Eagle. At the beginning of this rock bluff (West side) is a big drop off. We caught numerous pike and walleye here. Fish around the large flat rock for Walleye. I tell you what, this could get really long. If you PM me your email address I'll hook you up with Maps and spots where we had good luck."

Most of Our (better) fishing was done on Eagle Lake... Any point or Island that the wind was blowing into was good fishing. We did catch some nice pike in ""Midway Lake"" at the entrance and exits between Chase and Eagle. Biggest was 43"" which inhaled My spinnerbait cast to the bull rushes. Caught quite a few in the 32"" to 36"" range also. Most of the Eye's caught were 15"" to 17' with the largest a 25"" By My Buddy. Minnows and Leeches were the ticket... Jigs in Yellow and White.. We were there during the 3rd week of June both times. Very rustic at that time, No running water... an outhouse, shower was provided by a black plastic 10 Gl bladder hung in the shower area. We dipped water into 5 Gl buckets from the lake for drinking, eating etc. Had to let it sit for at least 36 hours to settle. They did have all the rough ins for plumbing put in... none of it was hooked up though."
