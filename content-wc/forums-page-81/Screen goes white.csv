6517504,Hawker,2021-01-16 17:52:00,3967,"Temporary solution is to exit out of Enhanced Mobile View and utilize Desktop Mode as that is where it appears the issue actually is. YES, the powers that be have been made aware."

6517096,prov1800,2021-01-15 12:30:00,5010,Happening to me today.i switch to my desktop veiw and that seems to work.
6517098,Eckohlt,2021-01-15 12:39:00,3685,"The only thing that went white was when I looked outside when I woke up,everything covered with snow,so not much help to you rich on the screen thing"
6517116,RichA$1970,2021-01-15 13:55:00,1159,Well if the fish stop biting you can become an IT guy as that worked on my laptop...thanks

6517282,kettyspanky,2021-01-16 03:56:00,271,Mine goes white as well on my phone. Have not tried the laptop yet. Been happening for a couple days.
6517302,tv4fish,2021-01-16 06:48:00,2694,Rich: We all know that it IS a conspiracy. Big Brother is watching and NOT liking what we post......... SORRY - The devil made me do it...............
6517318,Eckohlt,2021-01-16 07:21:00,3685,"Come on man all of our post are fantastic reading,the walleyes make us do it"
6517322,RichA$1970,2021-01-16 07:32:00,1159,"No response from WC Moderators on helping as this is impacting multiple people, not just me as I did think maybe I got the ""Pikeplus"" treatment to join him in a re-education work camp north of the 38th parallel. Funny how a thread can get nuked in minutes when a discussion is about factors that impact the ability for some to fish for walleye in Canada but ignored when the site has a malfunction."
6517410,johnboat,2021-01-16 13:17:00,2014,I've got this issue as well. I've changed nothing on my phone. It has to be site related.A little assistance from the powers that be would be nice.
