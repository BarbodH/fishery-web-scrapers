The Ultimate Fishing Show - Detroit, originally scheduled in January, has been rescheduled to March due to the convention center's use as an Alternate Care Facility. This Show, the largest of its kind in the U.S., will fill the seven-acres of exhibitor space with fishing boats, fishing tackle, fishing gear, fishing vacations, and factory-direct exhibits. The Show is a perfect venue for anyone interested in fishing, from beginners to tournament pros!"

6515232,Baseline,2021-01-08 17:00:00,3207,I'd bet the odds are the Detroit show will not happen as Michigan is still a hot spot for the virus. The Northwest Sport Show in Minneapolis scheduled of late March has already been cancelled. I very sure the Canadian resorts will not attend the show knowing the status of the border closures are unknown. I have already received emails from Minnesota Boat Dealers about their spring virtual and showroom sales and events. One dealer is offering incentives to make an appointment to come in and browse the boats in their showroom. Large sport shows just might be a thing of the past as the dealers and manufactures learn how to sell their products without the expense of attending a show.
