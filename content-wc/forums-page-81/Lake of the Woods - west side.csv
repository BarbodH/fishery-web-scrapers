6513790,Scooterguy,2021-01-04 09:49:00,2,"Hi all. New to this forum as a poster. Not sure if any of you fish lotw on the west side or not. I started fishing in echo, rush and ptarmigan a few years ago when we got a cabin out here. I fish most days and put a lot of time in on the water and ice. One thing I have noticed is the amazing difference between summer and the rest of the year. During the summer months I have figured out how to catch eyes on each outing with a few days of 40 or more fish. All that being said, big fish are rare with only a handful of 25+ fish in 3 years. What is strange is how hard fish of any size are to find in the spring and winter...even late fall. I have spent at least a 150 hours on the ice over the last 3 years and have 2 walleye...yeah that's right. I have used live bait (where allowed), jigs, ripping raps, rattle baits, small spoons with a minnow head, plastics etc with no luck. I've tried all depths from 15-45 feet. Anyways, I love fishing and being outside so I still head out all the time. Problem is my kids hate ice fishing now because we never catch anything. Do most of the walleye move to the middle of the lake to the spawning areas? I am always fishing with a flasher and it is pretty desolate down there. Just wondering of any of you guys or gals have trouble finding fish outside of summer. I always heard that summer was supposed to be the hardest time?"
6514002,prov1900,2021-01-05 06:20:00,544,"I think summer brings stabilization to the walleyes, i.e. they are more predictable. Spring you are always fighting pre-spawn, spawn, and post-spawn and often within the same time frame, so I think I spend a lot of time traveling versus fishing, because I feel I have to. Of course walleyes are a fickle creature. I'm very envious of the guys that can always figure them out year 'round"
6514016,Medy,2021-01-05 07:00:00,40,"I am unfamiliar with LoW but fish NWO lakes. Ice walleye usually amounts to either an early morning or a dusk bite. I do get some fish off of deep reefs in the winter, but I find more success fishing deeper feeding flats with soft bottom (transition zones hard bottom to soft bottom where the basin begins). Some lakes do also have a much shallower bite if you know where to find reeds in the fall, sometimes these spots will have fish early in the winter. Later on towards March the fish start to move towards their spawning locations I believe, points and feeding flats near spawning creeks come into play. Also, if you're walleye fishing in 45ft of water, remember the vast majority of those fish you let go (caught from 28 feet or deeper) are most likely going to die if released due to barotrauma. Even if they swim back down the hole they have a tendency to float back up under the ice."

I fish the Stevens Bay, Miles Bay and Hay Island area during the ice season. We catch walleyes and lots of them in pinch points where the lake narrows down especially if their is current. I've caught walleyes using a bare hook and minnow suspended with a bobber. I also jig medium Rippin Raps and various rattle spoons. In the spring, run large fast action cranks in shallower areas off of emerging week lines and through major bays. The bigger walleyes will react to the action of the cranks."
6515370,Bill Krejca,2021-01-09 08:09:00,6107,"Re: Barotrauma - A real problem, especially crappie end up dying when caught from a much shallower depth, 18 -22 ft, on down. I believe the exact die depth depends on weather conditions for the day. The actions of folks who release fish caught deep, while supposing to have the best of intentions, can result in many dead fish. Same is true during the soft water period. Soft water fatalities can be almost 100% prevented by flipping the fish at least 6 ft in the air, the shock produced allows them to get back down and survive. This is not practicable when ice fishing. Yes, it works, no, they do not later die, been doing this for a very, very long time. (I have caught the same fish later.) Folks making videos for You Tube, etc., viewing can help eliminate some of the death rate by explaining this on their video. Bill"

6515926,Bill Krejca,2021-01-11 07:34:00,6107,"Ha! Yeah, if you watch, especially in the fall while crappie fishing, anywhere from several to 8 or10, eagles will be above you while crappie fishing, they have been conditioned to ""keep an eagle eye"" on crappie folks, as the folks can unfortunately leave a trail of floating fish as they pull up and release fish. Over the years, I (we) have been able to enhance the return to depth rate to almost all. Friends fishing with me who release a floater did not do the flip high enough. This maybe sound crazy, but flip reaching 6 ft min will send almost all releases right back down, you can watch the tail motion when they hit the water, heading straight back from whence they come. I repeat this technique here, which I have posted a number of times over the years, knowing there can be a hesitancy to believe by those who have not tried it. Those who have, and have done it correctly, are believers! I only share because it is a fish preserving approach, is good for the fishery. Yes, I have caught the same fish again over again later in the day, same depth. On the same artificial, meat for another thread subject discussion. Gonna be a long winter..... Bill"
