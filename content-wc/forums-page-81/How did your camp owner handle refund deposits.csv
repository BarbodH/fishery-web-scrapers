I am considering myself as lucky that I'm not a Clarks customer."

Border still closed... In order to help accommodate ALL groups that were initially scheduled at Lac Kamwakuskach, Jim rebooked us Tuesday 07 - Tuesday 21 July 2020. Border still closed... Again, remaining optimistic, Jim rebooked us Saturday 22 August - Saturday 05 September at Lac Evans as the other 2 groups that were part of the Lac Kamwakuskach plans had too many scheduling conflicts to recommit to an August schedule. Time will tell...we all remain optimistic that we'll be fishing in 35 DAYS! Jim has already told us that should border/quarantine issues remain in place that prohibit our Lac Evans trip this year, he will rollover ALL $ to 2021. FAST FORWARD TO 2021... NORTH CARIBOU (ONTARIO) - Owner's Rob, Sandy & Dusty Brodhagen We have 2 weeks booked at North Caribou Lake Saturday 14 - Saturday 28 August 2021. A modest $500 per person deposit was required for this 2021 booking. North Caribou has told us that in the event any U.S/Canada border restrictions compromise our 2021 scheduled trip, they would roll ALL $ to 2022. A few final notes... I greatly appreciate and value EVERYONE'S candor on this site. It is this candor that I and the other fishermen within our groups have taken as TRUTH, no matter how positive or negative, loving or toxic. Case in point, next year will be our 1st year fishing North Caribou. If it wasn't for each of you who've fished there and taken the time to provide your experiences and opinion here at Walleye Central about North Caribou, we wouldn't be going. The same could be said about our wonderful experiences and great times we have at Eddie North's camps (Beteau, Blackbirch & Windsor), all the wonderful people in Nakina Ontario, especially Greg Bourdignon, his family and the Nakina Air Service team and Rob Pennock, his family and the Pennocks Tourist Service team. Thank You Mike Borger for taking the time to share your passion of fishing in the bush. Your website has helped me maintain my sanity through these unprecedented times. Stay safe everyone."

I went with a couple buddies and my oldest son last year and I thought it was such a unique experience to do the fly in and be the only ones on a whole lake etc what a great way to leave each kiddo with unique memories and my wife makes these scrapbook albums so then at Christmas they would get a book to keep the memories. Pretty crushing for all not to get to go ..... And just frustrating for me about the $"
