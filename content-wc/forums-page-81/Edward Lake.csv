6518564,prov1800,2021-01-20 07:56:00,5010,"Few years ago i had a guest with me that caught a 54"" muskie while walleye fishing on a 6# floura leader.We got it in the boat.Anything goes i guess.ive got 8# braid on my main walleye rod with a 8# floura leader.Have had some pike cut it but normally good enough."
6518584,Eckohlt,2021-01-20 08:27:00,3685,"You can land about any size fish in n.w Ontario on 6lb or 8 it's all about having a reel with a great drag system,if you have a reel with a sticky drag bye bye fish"
6518586,Eckohlt,2021-01-20 08:32:00,3685,"I think we are back on track to keep this thread going,right hawker?"
6518588,prov1800,2021-01-20 08:34:00,5010,A good reel comes in handy.Lots of good ones out there.I have been using the ABUs for the last few years and mine do get used summer and winter and still as smooth ad when they came out of the box.

6518284,prov1800,2021-01-19 08:16:00,5010,Snuck out for a couple of hrs yesterday to Clarks camp.Fished 1:30-3:30.First hr was really so iam thinking 12:30 it would have been good to.But had fun hauking up walleyes about about every couple of minutes. Nothing big all about the same size.Caught 5 pike also. Weather is cold at -17c in the afternoon.But was nice and warm in the shack.Caught a bunch on a minnow and jig and then changed to a hard bait.Slowed a bit but got the aggresive fish.Always love it when they hit a bait hard.
6518294,Eckohlt,2021-01-19 08:31:00,3685,"John one year to be alone on the water is nice are you prepared for a second year of peace n quite?one thing I don't miss about the ice shack I was in there was hitting my head on the top of the door frame going in n out,I should have went back to the cabin a few times for concussion protocol,almost forgot nice fish in the pics again n again n again"
6518300,prov1800,2021-01-19 08:51:00,5010,Definatly got to watch the top of the door especially the shack i fish from that one is deadly.But i got it down.Only bang my head once and then i got it.Iam ready for round 2.It is what it is.Not sure what to make from our government.They let a lot of people into canada this year from all over the world.Dont know who or why.Seems they want to keep our neighbors out that actually want to help our economy.Vacinnes and negative tests and a rabies shot should do the trick to let people come up and spend some money up here in my book. Cant get a vaccine shot here but our snowbirds in the states are getting there shots there.Now tgats crazy.ill pick up a few cdn guide days and see how the season goes.There are going to be a lot of fish this year.
6518320,Eckohlt,2021-01-19 10:05:00,3685,I went to the vet today and got my rabies shot so I'm good there if I bite anyone lol
6518354,prov1800,2021-01-19 12:59:00,5010,Perfect.

Hopefully both sides will come up with a safe, simple plan to let both sides enter this summer."
6518480,prov1800,2021-01-19 20:46:00,5010,Rich the only people that want the border open are the folks that work in the tourism sector.The small towns in the northeast north of Toronto dont want anyone from toronto even coming up there.But from what iam getting is anotger shutdown.Vaccinating here is at a stand still.So until they start that here tgere wont be border talks.
6518508,Eckohlt,2021-01-20 04:12:00,3685,"I'm a positive person rich,but it looks like we might be fuked again this year,I was 100% sure we would get in a fall trip,but now I'm not so sure.I want to use my trip deposits on the lakes I'm suppose to go to,so then after that I can try some new lakes,but the way looks might not get to a new lake until 2023,hope I'm still alive"
6518522,prov1800,2021-01-20 05:55:00,5010,Apparently we might not get the vaccine till sept.Word was Canada was going to get enough but as usuall our government screwed up and all we hear is now excuses.Might not be a lot of camps left in 2023.The ones that make it would definatly be bus√Ω.The only news we get monthly is the border closure extensions.This is really getting old.
