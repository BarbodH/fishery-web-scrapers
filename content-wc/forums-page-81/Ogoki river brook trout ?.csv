6308194,vteye3,2019-04-05 14:26:00,496,Curious if anyone is catching brook trout in early June on the Ogoki river system? I broke trail (rough) to get into an area called Brook Trout falls and had no luck couple trips back. Is that fishing hit or miss strictly based on surface water temp? At what water temperature would you say (60 ?) its not worth the hike down through the brambles and just keep on keeping on with the walleye an pike? Thanks Charlie PS Fly in 63 days

There are stories of the north channel still having trout beyond Esser lake but I can't confirm that. There are ogoki tributaries that still support good trout fishing like the dussey, D'orrensens, colpitts, otter tail and many more small streams. It's a shame, at one time the Ogoki was a world class trophy trout destination. I went upstream from the Ogoki bridge to reach D'orrensens river and fished a pool below a water fall not far from the Ogoki confluence with no luck, went above that falls and the water changed to a emerald colour which was much colder then below. Trout were everywhere, amazing what a difference a 100yards upstream made."

Like Nemegosikaa said, I don't think they are there anymore, and that's a **** shame. What camp are you staying at? Could Brook Trout Falls be Speckled Trout Rapids?"
6308294,Mike Borger,2019-04-06 05:21:00,1554,"Had to go find my old journal to answer this question. In any case I can say with certainty that brook trout haven't been extinct from the river since the 60's.On one of my canoe trips I paddled down the Albany to the confluence with the Ogoki, then paddled/dragged my way all the way up the Ogoki till I got to the road just downstream from Ogoki reservoir where I ended my trip.There was heavy rapids and a small falls on the Ogoki just downstream from the confluence with the Dusey, I caught brook trout there. Upstream from there the river splits and flows around a large island. This would be downstream from Speckled Trout rapids. The north channel around that island had a lot of heavy water and lots of brook trout.Upstream from that point I didn't catch another trout."

I will study the maps further to see if there are streams following into Ogoki nearby Speckled trout rapids that might support brook trout. Thank you, I appreciate the responses."

6520796,Guest,2021-01-26 16:07:00,0,We've fished those rapids twice and did not see any trout (of course it was July both times).Its worth a visit just for the walleye fishing though
6521610,vteye3,2021-01-29 08:42:00,496,"Jason said a party caught brook trout at outlet of Ogoki lake were it flows into Kayedon area in 2018 or early 2019. I like the guy our trip was paid for and see no reason to give us false hopes. I fished a #3 mepps in there and could not keep the walleye off. I also hiked down into Speckled trout rapids fishing the Southern side of the rapid this last trip 2019. I caught pike at every pool and thought after cleaning out the pike I might have a shot at a brookie working it back up river. No brook trout but had a fish on that I thought was a brookie. If interested I would suggest fishing the south side much easier access, I've tried both sides."
