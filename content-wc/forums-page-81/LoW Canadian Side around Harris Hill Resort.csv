This is our first time as we have been doing Lac Seul for many years and wanted some different water for a change. Since we are new to the area, anyone have some advice for finding the big Wallies in that area please? Don't need your special spots, just some info to send us in the right direction. Thanks again and take care."

Walleyes in that area spawn along beaches and are moving out to deeper water. I don't seem to do well in the mid-lake reefs until a couple weeks later. But - every year is a little different, so start with something that makes sense and expand your options. You'll definitely find them with enough effort. Good luck."
