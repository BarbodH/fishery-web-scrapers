It was a bit out of the way from where we generally fished but it was always a great spot. If I was driving and I could see it I would exclaim want to hit Bread and Butter island - one of the guys said ""Why Bread and Butter"" My answer - its always good lol Cheers Andrew"

6513208,gordy28,2021-01-02 08:30:00,437,Oh man. So many good ones. Wives point really made me laugh as we had a spot called the walk of shame. Bro and I stayed out late one night on Lady Evelyn because we finally got into walleye after 3 days of tough fishing in brutal weather When we got back to camp we got grief from the camp owner for being out after dark and a real earful from my Dad. That spot became the wall of shame. We went back a few years later and wouldn't you know the walk of shame was out best walleye spot Love the names and more importantly the stories behind them Happy New Years all! Andrew
6513416,Moosebunk,2021-01-02 20:09:00,211,"Had fun naming so many speckled trout runs on the Sutton. After putting them onto the maps then into the report, it's cool to often get angler emails recounting their trips and telling me how this one or that one fished well for them. Everything from Peter Dinklage (smaller specks) to Italian Job (where we used Italian Fish Crisp for a shorelunch). Lots and lots of names."

Depending on the portion size of Canada's favorite hot cereal and the morning's seas, this was a great spot to start the morning trout troll after depositing the aforementioned breakfast on this small rock island. I still have the coordinates from my original Eagle Explorer GPS."
6521622,Matcaz,2021-01-29 09:02:00,22,"All these names come from a camp a group of buddies and I started going to during our college years on the Churchill river. Typing this out makes me smile as each holds such fond memories. Carl's Island: My very first trip to this camp was a high school graduation gift from my father, Carl, who was a golfer NOT a fisherman. But he took me on this trip because that was just the best Dad a guy could have. We were fishing a stretch of shoreline between to large islands. My Dad took his boat across the bay to fish a tiny set of islands extending from a point. He knew nothing about fishing, but something drew him to that spot. Turns out that those island were pure FIRE! We fished them every day the rest of the trip and all my following trips with the pals, Carl's Island was always our first stop. Orange Bucket: The Mulligan brothers on their first trip with me were fishing a large bay when they hooked the biggest Northern of their life. But when they left camp they had forgotten to put their net in the boat. All they had to land this behemoth was the orange camp tote that was used for garbage and to put the stringer of fishing in between stops. In their haste to land the fish, common sense had alluded them. They lowered the tote into the water immediately filling it with 20+ gallons of water and then guided the Pike into the tote. As you can imagine, lifting that tote over the side of the boat was impossible and the fish got away. Ho Ho Island: We were fishing a small island off a point when my buddy Nate asked if I wanted to share a package of Ho Ho's. You know, the little chocolate rolled up goodies. I declined the offer but he insisted I or the third party in the boat have some. I didn't understand the urgency until the Ho Ho wrapper was opened and it's contents were removed and Nate asked us to take him to shore. You see, he didn't want to eat or share the sweet treat. He simply needed some make shift toilet paper as nature was calling. Nate's Weeds: Same friend Nate, was a novice fisherman and by no means a boater. He came on these trips with us for the comradery, solitude and beauty of the Churchill River. During one of our long days on the water Nate had asked if he could run the bow mount trolling motor as we fished a large, shallow, weedy bay. Although he had never done it before, he was a bit fished out and wanted a break and to relax a bit and thought running that foot control looked easy. Within minutes of Nate skippering our vessel, we were buried bow first into the weeds along shore. Pokey Falls: My best friend had the nickname Pokey. And on these trips he tended to overindulge in beverages from time to time. It was on one of these days we were fishing a long shallow narrows between two islands. There was a slow current between the two islands, but certainly no waterfalls or any type of rapids. But Pokey ended up soaking wet regardless. In case you hadn't had your coffee yet at time you read this, Pokey fell out of the boat. Sheila: Jeff was a long time companion on these trips and was well versed how places got their names. One of two things had to happed for a name to stick. Most commonly a trophy Northern or hot walleye bite occurred and the angler who caught the trophy or discovered the spot got to name it. The other option, as listed above, was to have something embarrassing happen and your boat partners got to name it after you. We were in a shallow and narrow bay we had never fished before when Jeff landed a 43 Northern. Well, now this bay needs a name. Without hesitation Jeff says Sheila. Confused we asked why Sheila, and he said it was the first name that popped in his mind. There are many others with similar backstories such as Moose, Bear Creek, Dead Man's Cove, Mud Cove, Sliva's Slough, Bacon, Last Cast, Rattle Trap, Empty Can Alley, Rat n Roll, Three Legged Frog, etc."
6521714,bigwalleye1,2021-01-29 12:31:00,2632,"A HO-Ho PACKAGE??? Geez, that's hard up. I'd have been tempted to cut off the skivvies and go commando for the day, or cut off the bottom half of my t-shirt, or use a boat rag, or something... but a Ho-ho package? Like the little plasticy one?"
6521738,Matcaz,2021-01-29 13:14:00,22,"Yep, the clear plastic wrapper for a ho ho two pack. He has never lived it down LOL"
6521876,PA troutguy,2021-01-29 20:07:00,58,"I tend to fish alone most times in NW Ontario. I keep a record of where I catch fish so I name them when looking at the map in the evening after the day's fishing. Turtle Island because it is shaped like a turtle, lots of reefs great mixed bag spot, lakers, pike, bass. Crab claw, a peninsula jutting from the main shore line, good bass fishing and one tiny bay where the musky hang. Minnesota island because of its shape, good bass and pike fishing. Tea kettle named by a great group of people I met from Minnesota. They found an old tea kettle on an island and hung it on a tree branch. Hollywood and Vine, kind of an intersection created by a group of islands and a bay entrance and a travel corridor. Head about anywhere from there and the fishing can get hot. Otter Island saw a whole family of otters playing there one day. I stopped fishing to watch."
6512524,port1042,2020-12-30 16:20:00,509,"We've got lots of names for specific locations on the lake. My favorite is ""Miracle Bay"". One of our fishing partners used his favorite bait almost exclusively and did well with it. We always called it ""Dick's Miracle Bait"". (Husky Jerk in Tennessee Shad but you didn't hear it from me.) Anyway, one day we pulled into a really small bay. Four guys in two boats in a spot we'd never tried before. Dick caught two walleye and a northern on his first 3 casts. The three of us just watched or netted each one. That bay became ""Miracle Bay"" and it's stayed ""Miracle Bay"" for almost 10 years."
6512600,Cover Dog,2020-12-30 21:31:00,303,Family has been going to the same lake in Ontario for 30+ years. One Lily covered bay looks beautiful but we only ever caught small fish there. We named it the ORPHANAGE.

That IS part of the ""experience"", right?You know the routine - In the morning you pack up the fry pan, the cooking oil, the flour, the salt and pepper, the plates, the silverware, yada, yada.Then - when you get back to the cabin - you unpack everything - you do the dishes, clean up everything and pack it up for the next day......We always stayed for a week at a time (Sat. - Sat.) - WELL - on this particular Friday - one of my buddies had ""had his fill"" of shore lunch I know darn well that he purposely left that nice black cast iron skillet on shore so we would never use it again.........."

You can easily miss it, it's on the right as you approach the Caribou light from the south, by the time you make the turn, it's already behind you. Sadly, it was a junk teflon pan that went back to camp to the garbage. I WISH I'd find a nice cast iron skillet...."

Tipp's point...his first trip..found this point and slayed the fish. Armegeddon...a spot of an island that fish are caught but can get packed fast with boats. green buoy...a spot in the middle of nowhere that holds alot of fish"
6512688,Mojo-NC,2020-12-31 08:41:00,1929,"One year in NW Ontario, we arrived close to the end of the spawn when the fish hadn't yet spread out to the rest of the lake. The fish were all stacked up near where the river enters the lake, but my buddy and I didn't want to fish with the crowds. We struggled all day long trying to find fish elsewhere until late afternoon when we finally got into some nice quality fish on a long point that extended out into deep water. We were really into the fish as the dinner hour rolled around. We decided catching fish was more important than eating a hot dinner. Apparently the guys in camp were worried about us so they headed out looking for us. My brother found us and wasn't very happy when he arrived to find us not in trouble but fishing. We got another earful from the rest of the guys when we arrived back in camp. That's when we realized how inconsiderate we were, but decided they sounded just like our wives when we misbehave at home. That point is now called ""Wives Point""."

6512286,stjoeguy,2020-12-29 18:40:00,979,"My best is The Grassy Knoll. It's a spot on St Joe that has produced many fish for us over the years. The Grassy Knoll is a spot with about a dozen blades of grass out in the middle of nowhere. Some years the rocks around it are visible and some years they're not, but the grass is always there, hence the name. I've got it marked on gps now, but even with that I have to drive by several times to spot the grass in high water years when the rocks aren't visible. It's near the end of a point with drop-offs on two sides. Three Sisters for a string of three rock islands is probably a common name in many lakes. The Three Stooges was a rock pile found in a high water year when only three rocks were visible. The smallest rock at the end was Tail-end Charlie. Since then it's just a big rock pile in lower water years. The name remains but we don't go back much since the fishing has never been as good as the year we found it and it tends to produce a lot of northern bite-offs. My fishing partner has a rock off shore, some years visible, other years not, that we call Curly. Why, I have no idea, but when he refers to it I know the rock he's talking about. The Shoreline. How's that for original? But for our group it refers to a specific stretch of shoreline and everyone knows where you mean."

6512396,Larry S,2020-12-30 07:58:00,665,"One of ,if not my favorite nick name happened in 2014 . My group was fishing at Kearns Lake, half way between Thunder Bay and Armstrong. This was my Sister's first Fly-In Trip and I wanted her to have Fun and Catch a lot of Fish. She had a Great Time and on the second to the last day we were fishing a long bay after dinner. We had lots of success in this bay on this day due to it being a later ice out and this bay was several degrees warmer than the rest of the lake. This bay was very shallow 2 to 4 feet at most. Anyway my Sister set the hook on a fish and her rod bent over in half She fought the fish, we thought it was a large pike as we had caught a number this trip, and she had 2 over 40 inches so far. She brought the fish into the boat ,it was about an 18 in walleye hooked in the upper lip, but what was interesting was the huge glob of mud attached to the lower lip of the walleye. I grabbed the fish and proceeded to dunk it up and down in the water getting rid of the mud. Then found a large sweatshirt attached, it turned out to be a size XXXL Green Bay Packer Sweatshirt, which was appropriate since my Sister is a rabid Packer fan We ended up that day catching over 200 fish out of Sweatshirt bay that day To make a long story short Our group leader, phishfearme Named the the Bay Sweatshirt bay in Honor of my Sister's Catch. We wrote it on the Camp Map to forever be named as such"
6512440,bigwalleye1,2020-12-30 11:01:00,2632,"Greta idea for a thread... Let's see... On Lac Seul somewhere, There's Caribou point, for the root ball washed up on shore that looks like a caribou rack from a distance there's ""Fort Knox"" our usual after lunch spot, because that's where the ""gold"" is, There's the ""Over 21 club"" because we've never caught small walleyes there, There's ""Dad's spot"", the first place my Dad caught a big walleye on a rod I built for him, There's ""frypan beach"" for the old skillet we found that somebody left on a rock on shore, There's ""Suzuki Reef"", AKA Spider rock"" where a friend left an almost entire lower unit, ""The Kitchen"", a pre-lunch spot that's always good for some last minute eaters, ""Hal Alley"", so named by a friend who's boat partner picked the spot to fish, ""Karm's spot"", a little point with current running past it that is a traditional first afternoon spot, just to take the edge off. ""Knucklehead reef"" after the friends that got hung up on top of it not paying attention ""Trapper's cabin"" after a rotting cabin we found on a nearby island"
6512442,gordy28,2020-12-30 11:01:00,437,Some great stuff. Love the grassy knoll and the picture is perfect! We have a hump as well from a trip to Shekak Lake but that spot was such a big part of the trip I think it will get its own post lol Love the Green Bay sweater story and that the spot is now infamous HeHooks I think many spots end up being named around rocks etc. It's where walleyes live lol. Years ago on a fly in to Miminiska Lake when I was chatting w the dock guys about where to fish he basically said if you see a rock or a white bouy marking a rock start there and it was so true.
