6517860,Fishin Fun,2021-01-17 20:08:00,218,A guy I work with gets emails from a resort on Lake Nipigon and he said the resort owner sent our an email stating that he's stopped taking 2021 reservations because he's been told the border will probably remain closed in 2021. Doesn't sound good. Bummer.

6517868,elway12,2021-01-17 20:31:00,335,Good article. Thanks for sharing. As the article states I think the best case scenario is that the vaccine gets to the masses sooner(next 3 months) than later and hopefully the cases will decrease significantly so they feel that they can open the borders without the risk for increasing the numbers. Let's just keep positive thoughts for both us the fishermen and even more for the lodge owners that need the border open to stay in business.
