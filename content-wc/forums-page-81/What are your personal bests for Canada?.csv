If you were targeting pike, a guide isn't really necessary, we hired one on our first trip for half a day, but most of our current spots we found on our own. For pike we just look for cabbage in 10-14 FOW and start casting. If you're looking for walleye or lakers then a guide for a day might be beneficial, but the lake is loaded with big fish with lots of obvious structure and reefs to fish. It's long haul for sure, 18 hours from eastern Iowa, but the fishing makes it worthwhile, good roads all the way also.

All of these fish were released, caught in shallow water over sand, and only one (the 33"") was ever completely removed from the water for a pic. All were measured with a tape measure, but figure a plus/minus error on measuring of at least .5 inch. Given the size of the 33"", I measured it 4 times, the initial measurement was 34"" which I didn't believe so I remeasured 3 times and got 33"" on all subsequent measurements. Girth was measured once at 17.5. Not sure if it was the same fish all 3 times, but I do feel one of the 1st 2 fish was the 33"".

6451386,BornToFish,2020-06-12 06:12:00,1224,"Greetings, The fish reported below were caught while fishing in Canada. I measured some of these fish, while others were caught and not measured. smallmouth bass = about 22 inches musky = 52.5 inches (replica was prepared) northern pike = 42 inches (three way tie) walleye = 29.5 inches grayling = about 18 inches lake trout = 28 inches perch = 12.5 inches whitefish = about 26 inches The ironic thing is that I had on my line, or at least saw other fish, that would have beat many of these fish as being new personal bests. Thus, I know she is out there. I just hope that I don't run out of time before we meet up again! Good fishing and tight lines!!"
