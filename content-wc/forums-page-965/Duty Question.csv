In order to avoid damage in shipping and shipping costs, I am going to meet him at the border to pick up the items. I am paying $125 for it and was wondering if I need to know anything or disclose anything special at the border. This was an ebay purchase. Just wondering, real minor but I suppose it might look suspicious when actually just a simple little deal."

Technically, you must declare the value of any purchases made while you were in Canada, and this may mean you have to pay duty on them. If you are entering with fishing gear, or staying for any length of time, this is less of an issue, in practical terms.derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"
