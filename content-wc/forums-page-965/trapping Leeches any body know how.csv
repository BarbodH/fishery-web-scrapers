In the morning you'll have lots.Punching holes with the nail lets them come into the can, but they won't leave.Good Luck!!!"

519588,Guest,2002-04-28 13:18:00,0,"I don't know if this works on your lake, but 15 years ago a camp owner told me to take fish guts, put them in a plastic sack and weight it down with rocks. Put a few slits in the sack. It worked well, but I have never tried it since."
519589,Boots,2002-04-28 13:43:00,19,I know a fellow here in central Wisconsin that traps leeches and he said leeches go for blood. He uses any kind of meat chicken etc. but must be bloody and puts it in a gunnysack. (Not plastic) The blood seeps through the gunnysack and you tie a rope to the gunnysack and pull it in
519590,MNBS,2002-04-29 11:15:00,13,"A gunny sack with liver works very good as well. Just put the liver in the sack, tie it, and put it in the water overnight. In the morning, several leaches will be sticking to the sack. As the previous post said, bloody meat works the best. Liver is almost all blood. It is also better than eating it!!!!Bob"
519591,Guest,2002-04-29 13:58:00,0,"Try sticking your leg in the water for half an hour and see what you come up with! Seriously, we tried the fish guts once and got diddly. Never tried the liver, it sounds plausible."
519592,Mike M (Sask),2002-04-29 14:19:00,374,"Hi cbI catch a lot of my own leeches. I use a tin foil pie plate folded in half, I punch a hole through the lips of the pie plate to tie it shut and to retrieve it. Inside I place a piece of raw liver and a rock to weight it down. I leave about an 1/8"" to a 1/4"" gap between the lips of the plate for them to get in. I find the tin foil pie plate method to be very economical and simple. You simply bring it in, open it and slide the leeches into a pail. I have tried the coffee can with holes punched in it but its very difficult to get those little suckers out without cutting up your knuckles. The gunny sack idea I also found to be difficult to remove the leeches. I do this in the dark so I find the tin pie plates a lot easier. I usually trap leeches in sloughs and dugouts. I try to pick places that don't have fish. I usually throw the traps in about 1.5 to 3 feet of water. I usually put them in in the dark and pull them out in the dark. Usually in a 24 hour time frame. Hope this helps.Good Fish'nMike M (Sask)"
519593,Guest,2002-04-29 14:33:00,0,Was just talking to a friend this morning in Mi. we live in Mi.--he was fishing in that park near Hornepayne last summer and had netted some leaches that were swimming in the lake and was using them for bait.When he was checked by the warden he was told that it wasn't legal to do that as it was taking away from the local economy of those in the business of selling bait.The warden let them off with a warning.My friend is in his mid 60'sand not one to make up a tale.thanks len

Had I paid more attention to the spelling of ""Kenora"" I would have realized it was Ontario, as ""Canora"" with a C is in Saskatchewan. Anyway check you regulations, then you will know. I know its ok here in Saskatchewan.Good Fish'nMike M (Sask)"

519596,Peanut,2002-04-29 14:56:00,929,"Mike - good idea with the pie plates. I've done the liver/coffee can thing, and they can be tough to get out, as you said.cb - From personal experience, this is normally a nighttime gig. I put the ""bait"" out after dark, and go get 'em before dawn. On those times I forget, or don't wake up, or just kept drinking beer..., well, you know how it is. Regardless of why, if I wait until morning, it seems that most of the leeches have taken off.Good luck,derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"
