I do love to fish but everytime he brings me with, the fish never seem to be biting....lol Hmmmm, anyways, does Lac Seul have fish or should I plan a girl's weekend? By the way, I like to catch 'em one right after another! Any bites there? Or any suggestions on where I can tell him to fish? All info is appreciated, Thanks."

Won't guarantee you'll catch them one after another, but they are there and they are big, and they will bite! You may have to look a little harder for them. Your camp owner will give you help on where to go."
