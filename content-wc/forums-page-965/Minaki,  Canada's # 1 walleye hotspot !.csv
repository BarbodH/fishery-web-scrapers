519067,brian1785,2002-05-01 09:38:00,1534,Thanks dude!
519056,Guest,2002-04-11 13:28:00,0,"Personally, I think fishing under the bridge is great since you can watch the gal in the yellow bikini at the North Star Gas Stop while your fishing! Catching eyes is a bonus!"
519057,Reels,2002-04-11 18:35:00,2876,Your turning into a dirty old man woods.... <{{}}><
519059,Guest,2002-04-16 00:23:00,0,"I concurr 100%. It is a fantastic place to fish. I have learnt more about walleye by fishing in that area than anywhere else. Also dindnt hurt to have a great teacher....RTMG. Again Rob, many thanks."
519060,brian1785,2002-04-16 11:47:00,1534,Anyone know of a reputable guide for that body of water. We stay at North Star and are trying to learn the waters but would like to find someone to show us some great areas and techniques. Can anyone help?
519061,Guest,2002-04-16 12:08:00,0,I here that the fella that posted this thread(rtmg) is a good walleye fisherman but I don't know from personal experiance....hope to find out some day though.
519062,Guest,2002-04-18 00:31:00,0,"No doubt, Rob is good. Spent three days with him in Minaki. Day 1, slow. next two days were incredible. Did 2 days with him in Pine Falls, the days were great ! My personal biggest was a 13lb. walleye.(my biggest to that point was 5 1/2lbs)The best part, he lives a cheap phone call away for advice.Tony"
519063,brian1785,2002-04-18 11:33:00,1534,"Tony,Could you email me with the rates he charges? I was thinking of getting him to help me out up in Minaki. Thanks.[email protected]"
519064,brian1785,2002-04-24 11:09:00,1534,btt
519065,brian1785,2002-04-28 18:50:00,1534,"Tony, could you email me with some more specifics of fishing with Rob? I cant get in touch with him. Thanks, Brian[email protected]"
519066,Guest,2002-05-01 00:51:00,0,You can't get ahold of Rob right now because he is on the road workin. He works in television sports & it is currently stanley cup playoffs. He doesn't always have access to e mail when on the road. I have no idea when he is getting back home. Last I heard he was doing the Torornto / Islanders series and with the Leafs winning tonight he maybe just stuck out there now doing the Ottawa/toronto series.
519047,Guest,2002-04-07 23:30:00,0,Check out this item on walleye hotspots in Canada. Sure do like the area's that came in 1 & 2 place........Good FishenRobhttp://www.outdoorcanada.ca/hot_spots01_walleye.html
519048,Guest,2002-04-08 14:14:00,0,I would how much Paradise Cove paid for that?
519049,Guest,2002-04-08 23:58:00,0,"My short answer. NOTHING.I happen to know the author of the item & I do know that he isn't the kinda guy to stoop to that level. T.J is a fine upstanding angler & a very honest one at that. Also, the owner of P.C is not the kinda guy who would even consider paying anyone to promote his place OR the fishing in the area. Hr just doesn't need to. F.Y.I, the area that is # 2...the tourney mentioned was won by the owner of P.C...... 2 years in a row. He is a former touring member of the P.W.T. The artical just caught my eye & I thought it would be some interesting reading.thats all............Good FishenRob"
519050,Guest,2002-04-09 06:46:00,0,"I wouldn't be so quick to say how great and upstanding TJ is, careful if you don't don't him personally...."
519051,Guest,2002-04-09 12:12:00,0,"Well, in my dealings with him he has always been a good & honest person. My connection to him is thru a old friend (Bob Brockhill) who was the producer of T.J's television program. I work in the broadcast industry and have met my share of people who were not exactly the nicest. He seemed to me to be a straight shooter. Was it all a act to impress me ? I don't know..... but I just based my opinion on the person I met. Maybe there is more, but I really don't need/want to hear it.The whole idea behind me posting that story was just for some interesting reading, thats all. I also believe that the story is one mans perspective. Do I take it as absolute gospel truth ? No.Just f.y.i, Bob Propst Sr. put out a book a few years back & he rated the area # 3 in North America. I'll call the owner of P.C & ask questions to find out if in fact any cash etc was exchanged for the story.........Good fishen & readinRob"
519052,iamwalleye1,2002-04-09 15:47:00,1589,"I would be one to say, I have to agree with his findings! I have seen the walleyes make a great come back and with the DNR keeping on top of it, I hope it stays this way! Just keep what you cab eat save some for next time!"
519053,IaCraig,2002-04-09 21:39:00,434,Personally I think the dock girl at the North Star gas stop under the rail road bridge helped tip the scales to put Minaki on top. ;-) IaCraig ;-)
519054,Guest,2002-04-09 22:12:00,0,"Her name is Marcie. Her dad Bob is the owner of the NorthStar Resort. Be careful tho...... Marcie's ""better half"" is the town sheriff ! heheGood FishenRob"
519058,Guest,2002-04-10 07:22:00,0,"I agree, been fishing that area for 23 years and the Walleye fishing has rebounded ten fold. A lot of it has to do with the MNR and stricter limits, etc, etc, etc, but more importantly I think most of the lodge and resort owners are starting to change their ways and are now encouraging catch and release. I think they have finaly realized that if the fishing sucks year after year people will go elsewhere. Maybe some day walleye fisherman will adopt the Large mouth bass fishermans attitude towards catch and release.....or maybe I'm just dreaming!LOL"
519055,Reels,2002-04-10 09:26:00,2876,"Minaki has a sheriff?Heck, what about the girl At Jack's Bait with her new equipment?? I was there in June, and they grew in August!! I never bought so many minnows before...<{{}}><"
