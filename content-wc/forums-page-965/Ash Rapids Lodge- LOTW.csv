519552,Big Laker,2002-04-25 08:12:00,53,I stayed at Ash Rapids Resort a couple years ago. The fishing was real good but we had many issues with the resort and the service. I would definitely recommend the area but there are some things you should know about the resort to help you have a better trip. Email me at [email protected] if you want more details....
519553,DonC,2002-04-25 17:01:00,93,"Big Laker, I tried the e-mail address, but it didn't go through. Here is my edited e-mail.Big Laker,Thanks for the response. Myself and another friend are tentatively taking our 18 and 19 year old sons July 16th to Ash Rapids Lodge. Usually I fish at Birch Island Resort near Minaki, and have had good trips. I have talked to an ex guide, that used to work there, who is now largely retired, and still visits there frequently. He highly recommends this lodge. He states the fishing is very good. The food is great in his opinion. He is very helpful in his responses but any insight you have on this lodge would be greatly appreciated.Thanks again for your response,DonMy e-mail is [email protected]"
