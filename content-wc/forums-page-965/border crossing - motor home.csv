There will be six of us and all our gear will be packed inside the motorhome. I am wondering if the border guards will give us any extra hassle because we are in the motorhome rather than a vehicle and also if we need birth certificates or passports? In the past, drivers licenses have been sufficient. Thanks for the replies."

I have crossed the border several times with my father and son and have never been searched. When I drive pass the vehicles getting searched, it seems like it is often groups of young guys."
519572,bphunger,2002-04-26 07:13:00,28,"A passport is the best for proving citizenship. But is not necessary. Is you have one use it. If not have a birth certificate. The idea, going both ways across the boarder is to show citizenship and a drivers license only shows residency. Motor home is not a problem. Officer, again, on both ways crossing may come in to check. That is not a threat to your party. Patience and courtesy work wonders !!!"

519574,Behle,2002-04-26 10:44:00,51,"Our group of 6 to 8 have been crossing for the last 6 years in a motor home while also pulling a trailer with all of our stuff. Last year we only had six so we did not need a trailer. We have been inspected twice. Last year they took about 45 minutes to go over the entire motor home. Seemed they stopping all motor homes. This was at about 2 a.m. They appeared to have already decided they were going to check us before we got there. Very polite and professional. The group just behind us had a driver who admitted to having a beer at supper time and they gave him a breathalizer and one to the guy who was scheduled to drive next.The first time we were stopped was six years ago. They simply looked in the trailer and said we were alright. The lady did try to get further into the trailer and stepped on a friends case of beer and killed a couple of them. I guess that's what he gets for drinking ""light"" beer."
