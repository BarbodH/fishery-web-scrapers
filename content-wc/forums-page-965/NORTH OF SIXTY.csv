519457,Piscatorian,2002-04-21 20:30:00,12,"I've never been there, but I have heard that the owner is full of B.S. a mile long. When it comes to pricing, watch out for hidden extras, I have been told that is their M.O. Be careful. Oh, yeah, and don't be impressed by his fake graphite ""replicas."""
519458,Northern Manitoban,2002-04-21 21:32:00,195,"I have talked to Clarke Jenny about Laker fishing there he seems honest.And i know there is big fish there a close friend of mine and his brother used to guide there.And the stories of the big lakers from my friend were pretty impressive.Its a big body of water and anywhere in the Northwest territories you have a chance at catching the bigone.Don't know about the hidden costs,had asked what all came with the full price for one week.Snowbird Lake is the lake i was asking about.FISH ON."

If you really want to know where to get some big trout email me at [email protected] There is some big northern there though, did catch them up to 32 lbs."
519460,Guest,2002-04-25 08:25:00,0,"Try Kasba Lake. It's very close to North of sixty. Has it's own air strip, the fishing was great and the service outstanding."
519461,doc,2002-04-26 06:15:00,143,If you want big lakers check out lake Athabaska. www.lakersunlimited.comIt's the real deal!
519462,Guest,2002-04-29 10:33:00,0,"I would recommend Nueltin. I've there six times. They claim more trophy lakers are caught(everything is released) than any place in MB. In addition trophy pike and artic grayling are all over.Just as important,it is a very well managed lodge with outstanding guides. If you are interested send me your e-mail."
