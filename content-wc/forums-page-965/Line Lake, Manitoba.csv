519426,Bobby,2002-04-20 21:55:00,211,Has anyone here ever fished this lake for Muskies? Just curious about how it was. Any luck? What lures? What time of the year? How big were your fish? Etc...

Casting to the island or shore. Catch and release only. You will catch some nice eyes on the same lure. It's in the Duck Mountains across from Wellman Lake. When you hook your muskie, you better hang on. Caught 4 between 35 & 39 inches."

How far in do you think it is and what kind of a trail? Thanks for the tips on the rapalas... my favorite fishing is casting crankbaits for walleyes."
