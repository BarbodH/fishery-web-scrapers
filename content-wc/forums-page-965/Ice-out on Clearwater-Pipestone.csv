519319,Guest,2002-04-15 19:18:00,0,"OK, I've read a few ice out predictions the last few days and am not happy to see what we're guessing. From central Minnesota we always gave it 10-14 days after the ice leaves the local lakes and it has been pretty predictable. Ice has left a lot of the local lakes with the northern ""hawk"" sleeping and the southern breezes. Any chances of seeing boatable open water by April 26 on Pipestone?guide#7wantingtosinkalure-out"
519320,mark,2002-04-15 19:56:00,61,I predict ice will be out on april 28. My $.02
519321,rainy,2002-04-19 23:30:00,21,hey guide#7 i made a prediction of may 15 on another post and hoped i was wrong.the weather has been great for the most part. have had lots of rain thunder lightning and above normal temps. ice is starting to move or melt from shore.the weather forecast is warm and the ice maybe gone sooner than first predicted. keep posted for future updates as i will let us all now of the ice out on rainy lake.
519322,Guest,2002-04-20 05:06:00,0,"thanx rainy, I lose half my fishing party if the northern ""hawk sets in and freezes things up that are supposed to be gone already with the mild winter we had. We'd be fishin' already if it weren't for March. Sounds like last weeks warm spell really started the melt process.7 out"
519323,rainy,2002-04-23 22:04:00,21,"eh #7 went to cottage monday nite ice in bay is gone sand bay is almost gone. the native i spoke with said the ice will turn black, than white and than black again, than it is gone. we got the black and now it is white. weather is warm the ice will be gone in one week i hope. will give the official date when it happens. keep your fingers crossed you will be fishing in a boat on may/18"
519324,Guest,2002-04-28 10:06:00,0,"thanx rainy, but I really want to be rapala trolling for lakers this weekend before the Minnesota opener. Just trying to add another fishing trip to my annual schedule ya know. The Minnesota Lake Ice-out status 2002 website is a pretty good site to watch the ice out progression across Minnesota. Looks like Kab., Vermillion and Rainy are next to go. We could sure use some cooking sun to assist us.http://climate.umn.edu/doc/ice_out_status_02.htmlKeep me posted.guide#7 out rodspackedandreadytogo."
519325,rainy,2002-04-30 20:10:00,21,"hi guide#7 talk to pilot today he flew rainy and told me most bays are open ice should be gone on monday, will post the official date when it happens. you will sneak in that extra trip for trout. remember CRR, {catch release repeat} camera is optional if you are honest lol"
519326,Guest,2002-05-01 15:24:00,0,thanx rainy. I just talked to the guys at Sportsmans landing on clearwater lake and he told me the main bay in front of them was out but the main lake area was not yet. They flew over clearwater and pipestone on tuesday and he said pipestone still looked pretty white and not too much edge showing. this is not good.
