1535945,55walleyes,2013-02-10 17:34:00,131,Going to Blackstone via Hidden Bay Lodge. Is there any law or reason that would prohibit me from entering Lake St. Joseph?
1535967,stillangling,2013-02-10 18:33:00,149,"Lake St. Joe is one of only two lakes in the province (I think only two) that requires a tag in order for non-residents to fish. There are a limited number of tags that are issued to the outfitters on the lake. Residents do not need a tag but very few bother going there because it is far enough north. Took a look at the web page for Blackstone. No mention of access to St. Joe. My guess is that they would be advertising the heck out of it if they had access and tags to go with it. Regardless, I suspect that you are going to be into some awesome fishing considering the system that it is on. I think that the only other spot that requires a tag is Clearwater Bay on Lake of the Woods for lake trout."

1536350,drlee,2013-02-11 17:30:00,409,"Its been awhile, but I seem to recall the river you are talking about that flows into Lk. St. Joe from Blackstone. It is in fact a rapids under normal water flow conditions. It would be pretty dangerous to navigate. The previous poster is right. You would not be legal if you entered into and fished St. Joe. A few years back, we went from Bear Island to fish below the rapids coming out of Blackstone and due to water conditions, a couple of boats had come into St. Joe out of Blackstone. When they saw us coming, they beat a hasty retreat! We had flown in with Slate Falls Outposts. Again, this was many years ago."

They come from Lake St. Joe and enter from a connection at the NE part of Blackstone. You can also reach Lake St. Joe via the south eastern connection. We have been that way, saw a ""warning sign"" and turned around and went back. No real reason to go to Lake St. Joe when the fishing is so good in Blackstone. You will not be disappointed."
