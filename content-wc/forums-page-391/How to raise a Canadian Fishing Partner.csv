1537794,pike50plus,2013-02-14 13:33:00,584,I'd say that's true for me anyway!
1537802,HeHooksHimself,2013-02-14 13:45:00,725,"Roland, I have to admit, that one made me tear up. I guess only a father can relate. At least at one time she was thinking Notre Dame. Wish she was here to help us beat Baylor! We could use her 3-point shot. I love it that her player profile shows her love for fishing.Classic"
1537948,Rich B,2013-02-14 17:42:00,1081,"I enjoyed watching that 2nd clip of the high school basketball years.....in my younger years, I grew up playing B-Ball in Indiana and love that sport....in this case, she can catch fish with her Dad, and handle herself on the basketball court, and pulls great grades in the class room; and has faith in God. Her parents must be proud of her.......and rightfully so. Rich B"
1538087,pikeandtina,2013-02-14 22:09:00,145,"Roland, Look up the research on female athletes who are also scholars. They are generally among the most successful members of society. I teach middle school and can tell you, those are the students I worry least about. You and your wife have done well, my friend!"
1539822,NY Walleye,2013-02-18 19:05:00,78,Very nice video.
1539847,Gipper,2013-02-18 19:49:00,76,Natalie has a pretty cool dad and I think she knows it.I know because I've 2 daughters and tried to find a fishing pal in them. 50% success rate. Been there done that and the journey is the best as you know my friend. You'll always have a sweetheart.I'm now working on granddaughters. I think it would be much easier if someone would just pop a boy for a change!
1537607,pikeandtina,2013-02-14 07:09:00,145,"Simply beautiful! Having a 13-yr. old daughter myself, my eyes leaked a little."
1537613,revitup,2013-02-14 07:19:00,140,that is simply great thanks for sharing
1537650,Mike Kansas,2013-02-14 08:40:00,1463,"Awesome...gave me the idea to put something together like that with my girls and their outside adventures. Thanks, Mike Kansas"
1537699,RolandDeschain,2013-02-14 10:14:00,30,"Thanks for all the kind words guys! Don't want to turn this into a ""brag on my daughter"" thread, but since you did ask..... She plays for Belmont University in Nashville, TN. Which is kind of amazing bcs she blow out both ACLs while in HS, had to have both knees reconstructed, but still started every game for 4 years, and went on to the first state basketball championship in school history. (and saved me having to pay for college too ) All of which led to another video..http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9-adLnqsXc"
1537709,MrSimon,2013-02-14 10:43:00,922,Great video! Thanks for sharing. A Dad's biggest job is to model good behavior as a man so she knows what to look for in a husband. You've done well!
1537725,tv4fish,2013-02-14 11:15:00,2694,Roland -- You done good !!
1537737,@Lunker,2013-02-14 11:29:00,835,"Wow......there's one youngster that's not going to end up in the ranks of brain-dead, unsociable video game / cell phone addicts. And what a 100-watt smile. Congrats on a job well done, dad."
1537768,emma17,2013-02-14 12:23:00,436,"Thanks very much for sharing your fantastic videos- touching for sure. Your relationship is one I strive for with my daughter and your posts are especially timely for me.Although this may not be the proper venue for such a question, I imagine other fathers have faced what I am now and can perhaps lend some advice. My 8th grade (nearly 14 years old) daughter is a pretty good club level volleyball player and she made it her goal to achieve a DI scholarship. I wrestle with being ONLY a loving father (lather her with complements only) and my desire to help her achieve her goal- which sometimes requires reality checks and motivation. How do you handle it?"
1537789,RolandDeschain,2013-02-14 13:28:00,30,"It was a struggle, especially with all of her knee problems. Lots of good cop (mom) and bad cop (me,) along with lots of tears, but the fishing and hunting connection helped us through it, Don't want to bore the fishing community with all the details of recruiting, but if you want some tips on what worked and what we would do different just send me a PM."
1537791,MrSimon,2013-02-14 13:31:00,922,"Love isn't only about complements and happy-happy stuff. Loving a child also includes discipline, training, instruction, guidance, motivation, support, encouragement etc etc. Think about it, if you don't step up on the harder issues, nobody else will."
1537419,RolandDeschain,2013-02-13 18:38:00,30,Started my daughter out on her first fly-in trip at 12 and has been every year since. The Canada stuff picks up in the 2nd half.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb7dqTqIS_4 Now she is busy maintaing a 4.0 in pharma studies while playing NCAA Division 1 basketball but somehow still finds time to go with her old man to Canada every year. Start em out right and you have a partner for life.
1537438,bluegussler,2013-02-13 18:54:00,124,wow thanks for sharing. Storybook
1537439,JayM5209,2013-02-13 18:55:00,1050,Wow!! What a video. You did it right Roland. Be proud of your daughter . . . . . and of your accomplishment as a parent.Thanks for sharing the story and the video.
1537523,Rich B,2013-02-13 20:56:00,1081,"As a father of two daughters that enjoy time on the water and fishing, you are doing it right, especially for your future son-in-law ! Rich"
1537524,BennieS,2013-02-13 20:57:00,108,That is great!! Where is she playing ball?
1537527,v-bay gord,2013-02-13 21:06:00,3168,Job well done Dad!
1537538,grapeape,2013-02-13 21:36:00,156,"My little one just turned 4, I hope to post up in 14 years that I lived the dream as well."
1537541,HuskerFrank,2013-02-13 21:44:00,24,"Very nice! Us dads have a special bond with our girls, don't we? I have one who enjoys getting in the boat with her dad a couple times a year, and we really enjoy that time together."
1537575,Shellback,2013-02-14 05:43:00,8083,That was beautiful!! Who was that old man with her in the end? LOL!
1537586,Skywagon,2013-02-14 06:24:00,1106,It looked like you enjoyed a lot of great times.
