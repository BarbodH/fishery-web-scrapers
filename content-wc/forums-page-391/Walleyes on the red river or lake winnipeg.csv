1538627,Walleyehunter16,2013-02-15 21:31:00,163,"Yeah I don't head to the Red to catch ""eating fish"". I go to catch the one that EATS the one I already have on the wall.Biggest I ever witnessed 14lb 4oz. Best friend got me up there showing me a pic of an 18lb 2oz the 2nd year he went.(not his)"
1538953,sept61,2013-02-16 18:02:00,91,"Thats the best you can do.........................Really, I fished the Red for 40 plus years well before a single winter shack or fall boat.Theres is no problem with the big greens from the Red or big windy."
1538986,Patty,2013-02-16 20:06:00,54,I personally don't fish the Red that much so I don't keep any from there but there is nothing wrong with a big windy walleye!!!
1539961,zeebee,2013-02-19 06:53:00,1144,"Hmmm.. Red River ...looks like walleye, tastes like Carnival Cruise."
1541028,LeeMB,2013-02-20 20:40:00,83,Most of the walleye caught in the Red come up and go from the lake.
1532426,fishaholic_88,2013-02-02 11:55:00,104,"I have an uncle who is interested in catching a monster greenback that the red river and lake winnipeg are so famous for. I don't know much about the fishery, so any help would be appreciated. When does the action typically heat up and where would the best place to Concentrate efforts? From what I understand, the west side of the lake has more fishermen than the east? Any advise or tips would be appreciated. Thanks in advance, Shane"

1532975,mrwalleye5,2013-02-03 18:46:00,1922,"If you are looking for a pleasurable experience go to Pine Falls in the fall. Winnipeg River passes by the Towns of Pinefalls and Powerview and flows into Lake Winnipeg. Numbers of fish are there but the bigger fish not as much it seems as the Red. You do have to take into consideration that there are far more fisher people on the Red than there is at PF. That is what makes the fishing experience less pleasurable on the Red. If you like fishing amongst the masses, go for it."
1533143,Burr,2013-02-04 09:02:00,8612,"Do you want to do this on softwater or hard?Softwater - October, and into November is the season working either from the Red or Winnipeg River locations.Hardwater - South Basin outside the Red River Mouth in March would be my target. It's big water (ice) and not so much about where as it is about being mobile to find them. I've put over 65 miles on my quad in a day on the ice working the fish in the south basin. The one thing that happens with consistency, is where they were yesterday, the hot spot yesterday, well, today - they are not there anymore. Every day is a fresh start on the ice. I've made 8 mile moves overnight, most likely just found different fish, but that's not uncommon.Technique for the greenbacks is what is unique about it. Get out the hog callers, it's great when they hit the hog callers too, but you'll have to call them in first. Pay attention to water clarity too. If you can't see the bottom of your hole, it's not worth dropping a line.My suggestion, if you had to chose between hard or softwater, is go for Hardwater. It's not that one is that much better than the other, but weather (wind) can severly change things on softwater trips. Your hardwater trip is more predictable."

1533375,fishaholic_88,2013-02-04 17:57:00,104,"Sorry guys, guess I never specified that we are planning an ice fishing trip in March. Thanks alot for all the advise and to Scotty who has provided a ton of information to get us started...will hopefully post pics of a monster or 2!!"
1533597,zeebee,2013-02-05 07:50:00,1144,"I've lived in Winnipeg for over 20 years and have not fished that cess filled watershed for even a day. The first time I walked up to the banks my ""spidey"" senses told me something was very wrong...really is quite disgusting water. http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/st...-in-world.htmlMuch better places to go unless big cancerous fish are your bag. Sorry, but take it from someone who lives there. Even the city of Winnipeg draws its water via an aquaduct from LOW. Others might voice another opinion but I assure you none will dip their cup in those putrid waters."
