1525184,Pikekilla,2013-01-17 17:25:00,1,"have been fishing Kabinakagami near Hornepayne for 15+ years. Fishing is outstanding, but need a little change up. Met the couple from Brace Lake Outfitters near Nakina. They have me close to being sold. Anyone tried this area and/or the outfitter? Brace is connected to Meta and Ara lakes also."

Just researched them myself, but my group didn't want to drive to Nakina [sigh], so I ended up choosing another camp. I'd definitely go though. I've only read good things about the camp and the fishing. Price is definitely right for that area."
1525219,tooski,2013-01-17 18:39:00,393,"Dempsey, So where did your group end up booking? How much farther is Nakina for you?"
1525299,adempsey,2013-01-17 22:23:00,963,"It's only another ~4 hours west. We are flying out of Hornepayne to Buck & Bingwood on Lake Obakamiga this June. It's not much further, but the complaining started, so I just stuck with Hornepayne, lol."
1525625,onetimedave,2013-01-18 17:48:00,502,The above lake is connected to Meta Lake which has excellent walleye & pike fishing. Meta creek connecting the two is also very good.
1530930,fishforlife,2013-01-30 14:00:00,77,"Pikekilla,Have been there many times and can tell you from my experience that the owners are as nice and accommodating as possible. Your fishing options are great having 3 lakes 220 miles of shorline to fish. I've had my wife there and she loved it, each year with 7 friends, and this year will be my 7 year old grandson's first. Can't wait. Good luck in your choice. Brace has my vote."
1530943,mroyle,2013-01-30 14:14:00,74,Fishforlife---How were your numbers on Brace? Have fished Ara/Meta several times with great success but never made it to Brace.
1531290,oleJoe,2013-01-31 09:16:00,114,You won't go wrong fishing Brace or Meta. Lots of fish and local owners that will do everything possible to make your trip enjoyable.
1539853,fishforlife,2013-02-18 19:56:00,77,"MroyleWhat time of year do you plan to go? We go in August each year and do well all over. some of the nicest fish can be caught right off of the dock. I have never been there in the spring during the walleye spawn, but they migrate into Brace from Meta Creek and Meta Lake in mass. I just enjoy the later season (No Bugs) and weather is pretty predictable.(nice) but could rain anytime. Wonderful hosts, can't do enough for you. Good Luck to you.Rob"
1539947,mroyle,2013-02-19 06:18:00,74,Late July or early August is when we've gone in the past. Planning a trip now for sometime in July....I'm a little late this year. Was interested in what your average number of walleyes per guy per day was at Brace. Average size? Thanks- Mike
