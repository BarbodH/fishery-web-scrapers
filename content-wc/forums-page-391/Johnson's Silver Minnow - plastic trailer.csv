1540705,adempsey,2013-02-20 09:17:00,963,Ha! That's not a bad idea at all. Probably could slice a bunch up for a musky spinner too.
1540762,Golden Eagle,2013-02-20 11:12:00,2642,I think stink helps.

It's always fun to try to create something usable out of a piece of trash or junk that's laying around the garage/shop."
1538112,2746,2013-02-15 05:06:00,3206,"5 years supply.....sounds like my tackle box. Wish I could listen in when my boys clean out my tackle boxes after I'm gone. ""what in the world was dad doing with all this.....!"""
1538119,ohiojmj,2013-02-15 05:41:00,1262,bingo!
1538393,Esox Warrior,2013-02-15 13:13:00,64,"Mister Twister Split Double Tails!! I like white or chartruse. Also, put white and chartruse together in a ziplock for about a week and the chartruse will turn the white a sort of yellow/green color that works great too! These are also my favorite spinnerbait trailer for pike/musky and bass!!"
1538515,eyeman_1,2013-02-15 18:00:00,690,"I like 4"" Kalin's grubs in Chart, white, Orange, or Uncle Josh Pork trailers - split tails in white. Pike just seem to hate those combos."
1538598,reconssd,2013-02-15 20:45:00,147,"I must be the only angler who doesn't dress my silver minnow with plastic. I think plastic deadens the action of the spoon. That being said, I may try it this year and see what happens."

1539199,onetimedave,2013-02-17 10:40:00,502,"In the lakes we fish North of Nakina we find a 1/2oz or 3/4oz Johnson minnow tipped with a 3 or 4inch twister tail has proved to be the most effective for pike. You can cast this into the heaviest cover and still retrieve without snagging. If you get snagged then it is more than likely the cannibal of the north, a Northern Pike."
1539225,Whopper,2013-02-17 11:45:00,340,"5r's I've seen him in action, when the bite is tough he can still manage some fresh filets. Don't let him kid ya on the lard, he uses very little oil over the course of a week while deep frying. He just needs to heel up enough to get there and back, he'll be taken care of while he's in camp. As far as JSM's I use 3"" white on silver, yellow on gold and chartreuse on firetiger"
1540505,Walleye Wanderer,2013-02-19 21:14:00,101,Second that!
1540550,fisher_i_am,2013-02-20 03:03:00,498,I've have a friend that uses cuts strips from a plastic bread bag for trailers. Clear parts with a little color.
1537750,jambi,2013-02-14 11:53:00,504,"I love catching pike in thick weeds. Casting and fluttering a Johnson's into open weed pockets and waiting for big esox to mash the spoon gets my heart racing. When I first started going up to LOTW, my Dad and I used standard grubs or some pork for trailers. Work well and still do. In the late 90s we found some plastic made by ReAction Lure Co of Louisiana, I think they called it a VibraFin Shad or Leech. It wasn't soon after they quit making these; we bought some remaining stock on ebay. I go thru about a 10-15 of these each year and I'm just about to run out....Anyway I just found the Evolve RX Vibra Grub in the grub section of Cabela's. Looks identical to those ReAction plastics. I will be stocking up for this year's trip!Video from Tackle Warehouse:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFyuWgo9jP0PS - white and black are my favorite colors, 3"" are better. 4"" seems like they grab the plastic and not the spoon. What do you like to tip your Johnson with?? hahaha"

1537839,Golden Eagle,2013-02-14 14:36:00,2642,"I've been using 5 1/4"" pork rind strips produced by Uncle Josh. Recently stocked up with enough to last 5 years."
1537855,jambi,2013-02-14 14:54:00,504,"Me too, it appears to be exactly like the old ReAction lures I mentioned. Drop shotting this plastic looked looked interesting as well!Is it June yet?!?!"
1537862,5richards,2013-02-14 15:21:00,131,hey Golden Eagle -- I hear that you can fry those 5 1/4 pork rind strips in butter when the bites off!!! How's the wheel? I like to use a black or white 3-4 inch twister.
1537885,Golden Eagle,2013-02-14 15:57:00,2642,Tennesseans fry our stuff in lard.Wheel is coming along. Staples out tomorrow.
1538088,adempsey,2013-02-14 22:16:00,963,"Looks similar to a Reaper Tail.I use a 5"" Kalins Grub in white."
