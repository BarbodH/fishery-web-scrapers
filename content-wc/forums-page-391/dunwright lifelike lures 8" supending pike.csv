1540514,tight line,2013-02-19 21:28:00,37,Sounds good maybe we can Eddie to join us and will fry up some walleye.
1540554,pikeandtina,2013-02-20 03:40:00,145,"Sounds like a plan my friend! What kind of rod are you throwing a two ounce bait with? Speaking of Eddie, I've got to call him. Been trying to get the group together to call him on speaker phone, but think I'm gonna have to do it with who I can get. We leave 4 months from today! John"
1540679,tight line,2013-02-20 08:41:00,37,John I use a cabelas fish eagle 2 casting rod rated for 3/8 - 2 1/4 oz baits and 50# 832 sufix braid.I also need to talk to Eddie and get our beverage order placed.I will probably send him an e-mail.
1537073,tight line,2013-02-13 09:11:00,37,"Has anyone fished these baits for NP? Last year on a trip to Beteau lake with Eddie North outfitters was the first time I seen these baits.A friend of mine brought one.My first impression was thats the stupidest bait I think I've ever seen.Well I was wrong.The 8"" supending pike was killer.It seem to be able to catch the NP that were not real agressive.The ones that just follow your spinner or spoon back to the boat.I was curious if any other pike fishermen had any luck with these baits?"
1537598,pikeandtina,2013-02-14 06:55:00,145,"Rob, overstockbait.com has great prices for these. Cheers, John"
1537683,tight line,2013-02-14 09:41:00,37,"John you can also order them from there web sight at 40% off. Get a 8"" white pike. Rob"
1537799,pike50plus,2013-02-14 13:41:00,584,whats the site for these?
1537850,pikeandtina,2013-02-14 14:46:00,145,www.dunwrighttackle.com
1537852,pikeandtina,2013-02-14 14:49:00,145,"Rob and Pike, The ones on overstock bait are $8.99, don't know if they have the particular size or color though."
1538080,pikeandtina,2013-02-14 21:43:00,145,"Rob, Maybe I'll order some other colors and we'll compare the results when we meet up for beers in camp!"
1540297,PRD1,2013-02-19 15:23:00,458,"We did OK on them a couple years ago, nice fish on the first day. The lake we fish (resivor) has lots of timber so we do better with the big FlatRap (#16) with way less snags. As you said this is a good early season bait, the fish were clost to shore and back of bays. Twithcing a FlatRap or Glidin Rap is more fun."
1540318,NathanH,2013-02-19 16:11:00,697,What's the weight on these?
1540511,tight line,2013-02-19 21:24:00,37,"The 8""pike are 2oz."
