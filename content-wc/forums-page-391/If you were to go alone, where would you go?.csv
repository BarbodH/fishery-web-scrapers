I have milage to fly to a major city in Canada and want to stay under 3500, less is fine as long as great fishing. Been to Great bear, Athabasca, Greta Slave, Ganglers, and 12 other places. Thanks Guys!"

You have had a dozen trips of most folks lifetime. It's fun to try new places. I'm trying two new ones for me in NW Otario this season. Cedar up 105 Norrh of Vermilloin Bay and Mariom Lake just north of Atikokan. Both for smailies and eyeballs I hope. Whereever you go be safe and enjoy. It's too bad we don't live 1,000 years to fish 1% of where we'd like to. Jim"
