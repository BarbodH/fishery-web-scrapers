1518966,OutfitterJoe,2013-01-02 15:21:00,27,"If you want a top notch fishing destination, flying out of Winnepeg, try Tate Island Lodge Jim & Gail offer a nice operation, they have been doing it forever. The rates are very inviting, they pick up the flights from Winnepeg right into the lodge on the Saskatschewn side of Reindeer Lake.Great Pike fishing, we have caught over 650 pike, many over 20#'s in a week, two of us, super Walleye, Lake Trout, good food, good lodging. Give 'em a try.."
1518967,OutfitterJoe,2013-01-02 15:22:00,27,check out Tate Island Lodge
1518994,Mike Borger,2013-01-02 16:30:00,1554,"Thanks for the input, Reindeer is definitely one lake I plan on fishing at some point."
1539896,Guest,2013-02-18 21:56:00,0,You won't go wrong with Kississing. Theirnservice is second to none. Our group has been doing up to 2 fly-ins every summer from northern Ontario west to BC. We are at Hassett Lake this June for the first time at that lake. If it's walleye you're after consider Barnett Lake Outpost (another Kississing outpost). We had a great trip there 4 years ago. Here is a Manitoba web site link that will tell you the records registered from a ton of Manitoba lakes. Have a great trip wherever you go. Tight lines and monsters.http://www.travelmanitoba.com/master...rch.asp?lake=1
1508614,Mike Borger,2012-11-30 07:14:00,1554,"Still trying to decide on a camp for our trip to Manitoba next year.Does anyone have any thoughts or feedback on either Hassett lake with Kississing Lake Lodge, or Aswap lake with Bolton Lake Lodge?There's some talk of Aswap in the archives, but nothing about Hassett.Thanks!"
1508629,Larry S,2012-11-30 08:06:00,665,"Solo I have fished several times in manitoba,but not at the lakes you want info about. Go to this Manitoba fishing website xtremesportfishing.com The moderator Dave Colibaba guides in Manitoba around Thompson,you can post in the forum and I'm sure get some feedback on your destinations. You can also sent a personal message to Dave,he is very helpful and like you loves to talk fishing Hope this helps Take Care Larry S"

1508744,zeebee,2012-11-30 12:54:00,1144,I fished Bolton lake Lodge approx 12 years ago in Sept. Land (water) of BIG northerns and plentiful fish. Not at all unusual to catch over a 100 in an afternoon's worth of effort. We were actually there to focus on moose (succesfull) but the fishing was too good to ignore. I realize that doesnt address your question of the outpost but I would expect the fishing to be world class anywhere in that region.
1509542,pikeandtina,2012-12-03 09:11:00,145,"Hey Mike, Don't know exactly what you are looking for, but I've always thought this place looked interesting: www.dunlopfishing.com Wherever you go...can't wait to read the report! Cheers, John"
1509749,pike50plus,2012-12-03 17:51:00,584,"Some nice pike, small walleye, but easy to fish not a big lake by most standards"
1509784,AMPHIB206,2012-12-03 18:45:00,191,"Bolton Lake (Aswap) has big pike. You can also target walleye, and they can put you on monster brook trout. They are pricey; cater a lot to corporations and larger groups. The fishing is top notch, and should be. It is a lot more remote that Kississing. Bolton will fly you right to their lodge from Winnipeg. You can drive up to the Kississing area, and there are tons of drive to lakes around Kississing, Flin Flon, Snow Lake. Try Sas Lodge. saslodge.com Family owned for 50 years. Nice new aircraft and outboards. They are always upgrading their cabins. A MN guest caught a 60+ inch northern on one of their remote lakes. The lake has lots of islands to fish around; but also easy to get disoriented. Tons of walleye, big pike. Just need a siimple jig and a minnow tipped with a white twister tail. It's that easy; and fun. The remoteness is beautiful. A 40 minute flight from their base at St Andrews airport; 8 miles north of Winnipeg. Free parking. Great folks running the place. I am not affiliated with them; they know their business."
1509803,Mike Borger,2012-12-03 19:16:00,1554,"Thanks John. I actually looked into Dunlop already and talked to Jerry Dunlop directly. The outpost camps look great. Problem is they fly from Thompson which won't work for us. We're looking for camps that fly direct from Winnipeg.Quote: Originally Posted by CYAVBolton Lake (Aswap) has big pike.

I have fished at the Main Lodge, Big Island Oupost on Kississing and Waskwie Outpost but have not yet had a chance to try Hasset. My favorite so far is the Big Island Oupost on Kississing. Kississing is excellent for big norherns and huge lakers and at the Big Island Outpost you feel remote yet you have the security of the staff at the main lodge less than 10 minutes away by boat. Everything has always been as advertised with the folks that run Kississing and I don't think you could go wrong regardless of which outpost you select."
1510799,isumoose,2012-12-06 13:09:00,14,I've fished Kississing and the surrounding area half a dozen times in the 80s and 90s. The past few years we have been going to Bolton having fished both Joint and Aswap. The trophies are more prevalent in the Bolton area of Manitoba in my opinion. Aswap is a big pike factory and generally easy to fish even in the wind. Joint offers the addition of lake trout and bigger walleye. Our group has always caught multiple trophies each trip to Joint and Aswap. Tell Trevor & Jodi hi from Moose in Des Moines if you talk to them.
