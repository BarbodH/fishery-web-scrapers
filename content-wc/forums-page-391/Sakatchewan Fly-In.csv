I'm looking for something with lake trout & decent sized pike, on the American plan, for around $2,500. A guide would be a plus, but not especially necessary.Right now, I'm looking at Beaver Lodge Fly-In and Shadd Lake Cabins. Does anyone else have any experience with theses outfitters (good or bad) that they'd like to share? Or do you know another fly-in camp with lakers, pike, and meals in this price range?"

Outstanding pike and lake trout fishing and above average for walleye. Priced affordable, good facilities and equipment. Food is outstanding and Irvin and Diana are great hosts. You can drive from Saskatoon it takes 6-8 hours or you could fly out of La Ronge. I definitely reccomend the lake. I went last June and will be going back this year."

We fly into Saskatchewan, rent a car and drive to Southend, where the lodge's float plane picks us up. The American Plan prices are very competitive."
1539252,Sidge61,2013-02-17 13:09:00,59,They ever find out what happened to their plane that crashed in 2011 and killed 5 aboard? I know it crashed into Buss Lake and sank.
1539675,Guest,2013-02-18 13:51:00,0,The authorities recovered the wreakage and I saw it two years ago at the Southend Airport. I never heard what caused the crash. The lodge has a new float plane in service now.
