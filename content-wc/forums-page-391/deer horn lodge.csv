1524968,Guest,2013-01-17 09:08:00,0,"Over the years that our group went to deerhorn we had success with walleyes both near and far from the cabins. In general, though its much better to run a half hour to an hour for better fishing, especially for larger pike. The key to getting to what I consider the better areas is learning to find Iroquois Pass. I'm sure the lodge owner can give you a map and directions. It's invisible when you look at the shoreline and a very narrow passage when you do find it. Once through you will have access to Van Giesen's lake, Burns Bay and others. It's impossible to predict how the bite will be but in the past we have taken loads of walleye and very large pike in these areas. It's reasonable to expect your host to mark the areas that have been productive and the methods that are producing fish. Good luck"
1525353,joepa,2013-01-18 07:52:00,366,"carpface, The best thing you can do right now is to send for the map of cabonga. Telling you how to get to certain areas is almost useless without the map. For instance ronfish mentioned Iroquois pass/point. The pass is invisible when traveling down the lake. You have to know when to start looking for it. Once through the pass, rocks are marked by jugs on the left side. Then you look for bird poop rock but you can't get close to it because it gets real shallow. You have to swing to the left about 20 yards from the rock and then head straight into the channel. Once in the channel there are many ways you can go with thousands of islands to totally confuse you. Also, once you get to places, remember you have to get back and everything looks a lot different. Again, the navionics card of cabonga was the best investment I ever made. You mark home and the waypoints to areas and then follow your track back. Considering all the investments you have made in fishing equipment, boat, gasoline, electronics, the trip to cabonga and back, etc., the navionics card will make your trip a lot more pleasant. I got one for $100.00 and it has all the lakes in the northeast U.S. plus canada. p.s. try to find a map of cabonga on line. It will give you a good idea of the vastness of the area."

1518948,carpface,2013-01-02 14:29:00,11,"i just booked a trip at deer horn lodge,first time for me,is it good place to stay.also hows the fishing."
1518968,5richards,2013-01-02 15:23:00,131,Use the search function at the top of the page -- I tried it and it appears that the numbers and size of fish -- Pike and Walleye are somewhat small -- judge for yourself.
1518988,Guest,2013-01-02 16:09:00,0,"Our group hasn't been to Deerhorn for a couple years because they mess with the water levels and completely screw up the fishing. In the past we have caught walleye and sauger, big pike and decent lake trout. The walleye we catch run in the 16 to 22 inch class. I've caught them up to 30 inches. Pike to 40 inches but mostly smaller. Some monster pike were lost because the walleye gear and lack of steel leaders couldn't handle them. Use a light wire leader at all times. I would suggest a first timer to use a guide the first day. Gary is a good one if he's still there. It's a great lake when the conditions are right. I will return again because we know the lake well enough to enjoy the great fishing that is available. Good Luck."
1519218,TIGHTLINER,2013-01-03 09:05:00,223,Sent you a pm just now.
1519220,emanonmac,2013-01-03 09:12:00,62,"I've been to Deer Horn many times, the most recent was this past summer. There is a slot limit there but I have no problem with that as the smaller fish are better eating. Cabins are good and I prefer those on the water both for the view and the ease of loading and unloading your boat. Bring a small fan with you to keep the mosquitos at bay while you are sleeping and for comfort during the hot weather. I recommend you have a GPS unit with a SD card for the reservoir that shows the depths and obstructions. I have and SD card for both my mounted GPS/Fish Finder as well as for a hand held IPro. I don't really need the GPS much anymore but it still comes in handy with the depth of places you might want to try. Also consider purchasing the laminated map of the reservoir. It also shows the depths and obstructions. You're first time there it can get confusing getting around and a GPS unit will be a big help. The last couple of years there was considerable work being done on the dams which resulted in some drastic lowering of the water level. For the first time there, the services of a guide are well worth the cost. Gary was still there this past summer and I used his services a few years ago. While they may claim the 18 KM gravel road in is maintained, there are always sections that are not that nice and require slow speed when towing a boat. A trailer can get a beating if you drive too fast in those areas. Most fish I've caught were with bottom bouncers and worms on overcast or rainy days. Some people seem to do good with jigs and I have caught fish trolling diving lures along the shorelines. Good luck on your trip. I'm passing on going back this coming year but planning on a November trip to the Bay of Quinte."
1520230,joepa,2013-01-06 08:16:00,366,"I posted a reply about DH and offered a few tips but for some reason it never got posted. As you can already see, the best info about DH and Cabonga Res. will come from this site. I strongly suggest a GPS and if you can afford it, a Navionics Northeast card. It will help you tremendously!"
1521576,Guest,2013-01-09 14:44:00,0,"I agree that a GPS Navionics card is very helpful on Cabonga. It has saved our lower units in the past. There are dangerous shoals on the way to the lake trout areas as well as washega bay and other productive spots. Personally, I don't like to run to any of the way out areas without a buddy boat."
1522628,joepa,2013-01-12 07:34:00,366,"ronfish, Is the trip to the lake trout area worth it? Ive always wanted to go to the lake trout side but always thought you had to have a guide or follow the DH charter to get there."
1524259,Guest,2013-01-15 16:34:00,0,"Joapa, I think the run to the lake trout water on Cabonga is well worth it. We made our first trip with Gary, one of Deerhorns guide's. After that we continued to take at least one run to the area on each weeklong trip. I'm blessed with a very good memory of water routes once I've done it the first time. The run to the area can be seen on a good cabonga map. We have made it several times and have always come back with trout although none larger than ten pounds. My favorite lure is a williams wabler in hammered silver with a small piece of worm on the treble. A good depthfinder will let you know when the fish a under you. We use lead core and pick up fish in forty to fifty feet of water. The bottom in eighty feet or more is paved with fish but we haven't been able to fish that depth. We enter the large part of the lake and set up when we reach 100 ft of water. We then turn to the right and troll toward a distant island. Off the island other laketrouters often jig with good success. I wouldn't make the run if the lake level is down. That's the main reason we have stopped fishing cabonga. We have had great walleye catches in as little as 6 feet of water but after the lake drawdowns the food chain and fish presence it totally screwed up. To bad we can't be there the same week. I'd be glad to show you the way....Good Luck!"
1524455,joepa,2013-01-16 07:44:00,366,Thanks ronfish! Always wanted to try for the lake trout on cabonga but was worried about the channels and rocks. I have a navionics map of cabonga and it helps tremendously. Two years ago was the best trip we ever had. We caught walleye after walleye in the 23 inch to 28 inch category. We only kept the smaller ones for our fish fry though.
