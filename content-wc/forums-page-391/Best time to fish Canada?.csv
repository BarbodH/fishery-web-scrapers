1538005,ftfarms,2013-02-14 19:07:00,444,The only time we stay away from going is last ten days in August we've hit the lake turn over twice in that time fram and that makes it tough
1538015,castnblast,2013-02-14 19:18:00,111,"Davis knows his NWO walleye and I agree June is sweet. Being a local, after long canadian winters, warm sun and hungry walleye are tough to beat. That time of year is also awesome to chase pike in shallow bays with the fly rod. It,s fun to mix it up during the day with different techniques and species - and the variety makes for great conversation around the fire. That said, for me, as much as i like numbers, jerking post spawn walleye out of 10 FOW all day gets old fast. If I had to pick one time of year for walleye only I love the last week of august and first three weeks in September. The weather is great, and Labor Day long weekend is a cherished family tradition with awesome fishing, hot sunny days, great swimming, cool evenings, no bugs and less people. The fish are grouping up deeper and in PRIME condition. As fall moves on, the weather calls the shots. Pick the right days in October and the lakes are all but vacant with the very best angling of the year with big fish and numbers. Shoot some grouse on the way in and out and life is good!"
1538073,BornToFish,2013-02-14 21:09:00,1224,"I have fished for walleyes duirng many different times of the open water season in North West Ontario. My experiences are entirely consistent with the numerous responses above. Each of the various time periods has its unique advantages and disadvantages in terms of things like stability of weather, bugs, and warm rain versus cold rain. Assuming an angler chooses a lake with a reasonably good walleye fishery, I sincerely believe it comes down to matching the time period of the year with the temperment (likes/dislikes or strengths/weaknesses) of the angler. Some anglers prefer to run and gun, others prefer to troll, while others prefer to dissect a rock hump with surgical precision. Thus, I encourage anglers to seriously think about their strengths/likes in terms of fishing style, then pick a good lake and book a stay at the lodge of their choice during the time of the season that matches up with their strengths/likes. The big walleyes are there all season long, it's just how do you want to fish for them. For me, I dearly love fishing in mid to late September. The weather is the best of the best or the worst of the worst. However, the fishing can be so good it doesn't matter how the weather is, as I can have the entire lake to myself."
1538077,Glenman12,2013-02-14 21:27:00,762,We have always gone up the 2nd or 3rd week of June..had some lean years but for the most part we've nailed them..
1540384,dogrodder,2013-02-19 18:15:00,400,"I had a guy ask that question at the All Canada Show. My answer ""Whenever you can get off work"". When I'm not at work I'm in the boat! Actually the past couple of years have had a terrific opener with the early ice out on the lake that I fish."
1540450,zeebee,2013-02-19 19:48:00,1144,Really? Ive fished end of August for years and never experienced a turnover that early...anyone else?
1540919,Davis Viehbeck,2013-02-20 16:57:00,48,"Turnover doesn't happen in August. You'll typically see it occur in late-September in most of northwestern Ontario. In the warm water period (summer), the epilimnion (surface water) is the warmest. It is heated by the sun. The deepest layer (the hypolimnion) is the coldest and doesn't receive the sun's warmth. In the fall, the surface water cools and it becomes more dense, causing it to sink. This dense water forces the water of the hypolimnion to rise, ""turning over"" the layers. It isn't uncommon for the lakes to appear ""dirty"" with debris even without the presence of wind."
1541393,lcwhit,2013-02-21 15:50:00,104,"i like early to mid august. used to go mid july. august is usually dryer, cooler and the fish are deeper. like someone said, not as many walleye, but bigger. i fish lac seul."
1537447,LoDo,2013-02-13 18:59:00,721,"What summer months (may, june, july, aug and sept) do you believe is the best time to catch big walleyes? When do you feel the best months to catch several walleyes? I know some of you are going to say ""all months""? I agree, but curious if anyone has a different opinion. LoDo"
1537503,zeebee,2013-02-13 20:09:00,1144,"I love the period mid August to mid Sept when I can troll big cranks 20-30' down. You can cover a lot of water and its a time of year when you can target both numbers and size because even the ""smaller"" walleyes (18-24"") have moved deeper and co-mingle with the bigees. The larger NP's also occupy that depth range that time of year. Bonus are lack of bugs, cooler temps and more predictable weather. Business is slower at the lodges so you gain solitude and better pricing to boot. I used to book my vacation in June or early July but came to prefer the August/Sept period and never looked back."
1537509,1jigfish2,2013-02-13 20:19:00,110,"We have always preferred spring, the earlier, the better.We have also done mid September, had very good luck then also. No bugs either time.Spring shallow, fall deep.This year we are doing both times."
1537661,GeoFish,2013-02-14 09:03:00,70,"I am not claiming to be an expert, but this is my 2 cents.I have been fishing Ontario since 1961. I have gone to several fly in only lodges (four before I was 18 and maybe 12 more since) and I have also done some do it yourself back county fishing (three trips). When I go to a lodge, I like lodges with several portage lakes, this gives you a lot of variety fishing all types of lakes. Some big, some small, some deep and some not so deep. Most portage lakes are not fished hard, the boats are not usually the best, wood seats, small boats and motors. Since most people who go to a lodge want comfort they tend to stay away from the portage lakes.Well you said Big Walleye.I think it depends on the depth of the lake. I find that late June and early July are best for lakes less than 50 feet deep.Some of these very shallow lakes (20 feet or less) get too weedy late in the year, and they typically don't have large walleye, my experience (I have been wrong before). I think the fishing drops off because when the weeds get growing you also get bait fish everywhere. On deep lakes, we like to fish late July or August. I also find fewer bugs during August and fewer fisherman. Some lodges give discounts during July and August so this is a double bonus.This year we are going to fish August 3rd thru the 10th . We want to fish during the new moon.One of the lakes we like to fish is a deep lake, 150 feet plus, yes it has some shallow bays and shores, but it's not a big lake . This lake is a portage lake for a lodge. The people at the lodge who have been fishing this lake a long time don't fish this lake during June. They wait until the water warms and fish it in July and August for walleyes. We started fishing this lake in 1985 and have found the same thing. The biggest walleyes we caught were 31혬 & 32혬 with a lot of fish around 28혬 to 29혬.We found a way to access this lake by 4 wheeler, so we wilderness camp and fish this lake and a few others. During our August wilderness camping experiences, we almost never see another camper. We have seen a few bear hunters and a few local fisherman, but never another camper off the blacktop.Hope this helpsGeoFish"
1537695,Mike Kansas,2013-02-14 10:07:00,1463,"For numbers of Walleye I like early June. Walleye are usally schooled up in shallow water and as long as you fish windy points and windy sides of islands you can catch good numbers. For big Walleye I like late July and August. Walleye have transistioned to deeper water and if you find sunken islands and humps you can target some bigger fish. These same areas can produce a lot of fish but the big girls like that deep cool water late in the year. Jigs and big minnows or a whole crawler are good baits. Would rather jig them at that time than troll them becuse you can stay in strike zone longer. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1537796,MrSimon,2013-02-14 13:39:00,922,Late August early Sept!!!! Weather is typically very stable and quite nice. No bugs. Less people. It cools off in the evenings. Perfect sleeping weather. The fish are quite predictable this time of year. Its usually easy to establish a pattern quickly and due to the stable weather the pattern doesn't change fast like it can in the Spring.
1537798,pike50plus,2013-02-14 13:40:00,584,"late Sept, if no ice"
1537805,HeHooksHimself,2013-02-14 13:49:00,725,"First week in June, hands down. Trout are usually still shallow, walleye are hungry post spawn, northerns are gorging themselves. smallie bite is good. No bugs. usually comfortable temps.But what do I know!"
1537869,Northern Manitoban,2013-02-14 15:28:00,195,In Manitoba hands down June is the best month!
1537892,Davis Viehbeck,2013-02-14 16:09:00,48,"June is a pretty sweet month up here! Walleye are still relatively shallow and can be caught on just about every technique you can think of. They're usually some fish still in really shallow water, some on shallow reefs, some on weeds and others cruising mud flats. If you're a reef or crankbait troller, mid-August can be pretty solid. Fish are usually really easy to mark on larger bodies of water on mid-lake reefs. Good luck!"
