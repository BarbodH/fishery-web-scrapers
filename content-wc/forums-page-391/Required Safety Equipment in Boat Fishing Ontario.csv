1538183,Jimmy Jig,2013-02-15 07:53:00,1905,The requirement is the same as the state you live in. Rented boats are different and if you stay in Canada for an extended length of time. We go through this evey year....
1538267,vteye,2013-02-15 09:59:00,812,"A plastic gallon coffee container makes a great safety equipment. Cheap lightweight for flyins, Flashlight, rope, whistle, basic first aid and bailing devise all in one with lid."
