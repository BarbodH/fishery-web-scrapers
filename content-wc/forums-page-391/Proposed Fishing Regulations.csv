I am NOT referring to LOTW area, but not sure whether or not these discussions are about all of Northern Ontario, or just certain parts. Most of what I have seen is related to the Ignace/Thunder Bay area. However, I have not seen any explanations of these proposed regs. Any help out there on this issue? Thanks!"

The slot in effect now would be eliminated ,the daily limit would remain the same But you could only keep one fish over 23 inches.the other 3 fish would have to be under the 23 "". to my knowledge nothing yet has changed"

My slight variation is that anyone bringing a northern into my boat has a choice: a) swim to shore and bushwack their way back to camp, or b) get dropped off at the closest shoreline and wait to be picked up at the end of the day when we're on the run back to camp. The only thing worse than someone bringing a NP into the boat is watching the so-called ""fishing pros"" grabbing a NP bare handed while a three treble lure is hanging oout of its mouth . . . . then showing that on their Saturday morning TV show. Ugh.........."
