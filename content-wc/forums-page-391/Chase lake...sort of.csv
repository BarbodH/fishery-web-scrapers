The end of the video a haunting bird call reminded me of Goose Bay. Its not a loon, anybody know the name of the bird call in the Chase lake video? Thanks!"
1529036,SinOrSwim,2013-01-26 07:38:00,1528,The whistle or the squawk? I think the squawk was a crow or a raven but not positive.

1529042,phishfearme,2013-01-26 07:45:00,1242,"""oh sweet Canada, Canada, Canada"" or ""poor sam Peabody, Peabody, Peabody"" is indeed the white throated sparrow"
1529339,wallydave,2013-01-26 21:48:00,2151,I have always wondered about the bird that has sung so many songs during so many trips!!
1529572,Fishoil,2013-01-27 15:13:00,1277,Thanks!! I've been trying to figure out what bird that is for years. They are the sound of Canadian fishing to me.
1529617,wallydave,2013-01-27 17:35:00,2151,Absolutely!! Many a trip we have had the call of the white throated sparrow as a background music!

1542420,stillangling,2013-02-23 21:24:00,149,"Did a quick search of your previous posts and copied one from January 15, 2013 (see below). You were asking forum members if they knew anything about Halleys Camps. Now you are telling people it they offer the greatest fishing on earth. Guess you had a busy 6 weeks ice fishing on these fly-in lakes...or did someone find a new employer? ""Hi All, What can you fellows tell me about One Man Lodge, part of the Halley's Camps Group? Accomidations, fishing, guides, food, staff etc. Thanks in advance"""
