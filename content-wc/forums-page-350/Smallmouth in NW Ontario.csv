2231114,mms3rd,2013-11-21 11:19:00,148,"I don't quite get the question. I can catch plenty of walleyes and northerns in MN, but we still go to Canada. ""Oh, Canada...."" We don't eat bass. We don't eat anything except a few walleyes at camp. Don't bring anything home. To be clear, we fish all species....and change the target depending on the trip. I have not fished any lake where there were bass restrictions in the area where we fished.For me, Canada is Minnesota on steroids. I have few opportunities to catch big smallmouth here and go to northern MN and Canada. I love catching fish with topwater and seeing the fish actually attack the bait....the bigger the better....son got a 45 inch muskey doing that....his second day ever fishing in Canada. I love the remoteness of the NW Ontario lakes, the quiet, the clear water.....beats out a farm pond every day of the week for me....."
2231714,OldRook,2013-11-21 16:17:00,16,Why not Rainy? Awesome smallie fishing
2232962,mms3rd,2013-11-22 10:41:00,148,I have driven past Rainy a number of times but never fished there. I often fish between Crane Lake and Vermilion Lake in Minnesota.Are there places that feel as remote as many of the places 100-200 miles to the north?All I see is the stuff close to the highway with boats high tailing it every which way.Mike
2233698,OldRook,2013-11-22 16:30:00,16,If you do one of the boat in resorts on rainy you can get off the beaten path. At least similar to Lac Seul traffic Camps narrows is decent. Think it used to be a whole lot nicer but didn't we all? Clean and dry with showers and flush toilets. I've fished it several times from fort frances and really enjoyed the fishing. Did camp narrows last July and enjoyed it. Had some generous neighbors share patterns and areas with us.
2238881,Skidoo600homxz,2013-11-25 13:15:00,37,"Rainy lake cant be beat, literally, let me know if you are looking for a guide"
2263386,Steve of Madison,2013-12-09 09:19:00,230,"I guess I wasn't clear enough, that happens. Believe me, I understand the ""Canada thing"". But when I go to Lac Seul it seems to me that there is a restriction on Smallies that you can't fish or target them until after july 1 (spawning reasons) I may have my dates wrong!! And I understand the targeting of different kinds of fish too! Although I have no interest in targeting Northerns, I get enough of them by accident, and I don't want those slimey, black fly attracting, smelly, toothy critters in my boat, ....my personal preference. What I was getting to is that there are lots of great Smallie fisheries on your way. Chequamegon Bay of Lake Superior, Ashland Wi is unbelievable. Where ever you go have a great trip and be safe."
2263450,Steve of Madison,2013-12-09 09:31:00,230,"You would think you could still catch a meal of walleye around Madison, have you tried recently, if you have you would know the answer to the question. No. But you are correct, I understand the Canada thing, and my reasons for going to Canada are simple. A. when the phone rings it's not for me. B. The quiet and peacefulness soothes the soul, and well down on the list is catching a bunch of fish. And there is nothing better than a long peaceful day on the water followed by a good meal of fresh caught walleye and your favorite beverage watching the sun go down, telling fish stories and planning your next days adventure on the water. If a restaurant could duplicate that........well."
2222274,elkman99,2013-11-16 07:58:00,180,"sounds like you guys had some tougher conditions for that clear water. when we went in july, we mostly musky fished, but guys in our group smallmouth fished. they fished the islands around Art's camp, and litterally almost caught fish on every cast. One afternoon when my brother and me tried to do a bit of walleye fishing, we couldn't keep the bass off our rigs. We were cussing them lol. when you guys went to the outpost, did you have your own boats or rent them? It looks like a great place to stay. Does he have gas available at the outpost or do you have to haul it in?"
2222394,mms3rd,2013-11-16 09:26:00,148,I think that I wasted too much time fishing the shoreline with topwater....I am addicted to topwater and don't fish points and rock piles enough.The cabin is in a great location....if you like privacy. We loved it. Cabin is in good shape with a bunch of bunk beds.We were overly cautious and took 2 1/2 hours to get in...had two kayaks on top of boat...the wife's deal. Can be done in much less time.There is plenty of gas for boats and to run a gas generator for electricity....it did not need to be run fulltime. Do need to take own water in.I used the owners boat....good size for boat and motor...don't recall specifics.You go through one of the mechanical portages that hauls the boat over a small piece of land....pay $10 I think. No issues.I'd give you hotspots....but.....I'd go back if I could have a better handle on the fishing.
2225082,MrSimon,2013-11-18 11:12:00,922,"Happy Day Lodge on Lake Windermere is a good place if you like smallies. Lake Windermere itself has good to very good smallie fishing, along with excellent walleye fishing. But the real gems are the portage lakes. They rarely get fished and are filled to the brim with fat, aggressive smallies. Happy Day has a top notch outpost on the far end of Lake Windermere that is very close to the trail heads of both portage lakes."
2225298,kzoofisher,2013-11-18 14:22:00,5144,"AAAAAAHHHH! What did you say that for? I'll be at the outpost on Windermere at the end of August and all that you say is true. The outpost is booked for the year so unless there is a cancellation..... Happy Day has picked up the only four cabins on neighboring Prairie Bee, it has a reputation as a better smallmouth lake but still has walleye. Never fished it so I can't confirm. I believe they have some openings there if it isn't too far east for the OP.http://www.prairiebeecamps.com/"
2225402,mms3rd,2013-11-18 15:29:00,148,Looks awesome....but a looooong way from Kansas City.
2227242,MrSimon,2013-11-19 12:34:00,922,"I spent a week at the outpost in August 2012. If you want some detailed info on where we found fish, shoot me a PM. I have no problem sharing good spots."
2227250,MrSimon,2013-11-19 12:38:00,922,"That's almost the exact same distance we travelled from Philadelphia to get there. It definitely is a long drive, but an easy one and well worth the trip."
2229914,Steve of Madison,2013-11-20 18:33:00,230,"I'm sorry but you want to go all the way to Canada for smallie's? They may be fun to catch, but you don't eat them do you?Plus in many places in Ontario at least your not allowed or supposed to catch or target them until mid summer. Am I right about that?"
2230098,MrSimon,2013-11-20 20:08:00,922,"For a lot of people, its not necessarily that your catching smallies .... its that your catching smallies IN CANADA. Being on a Canadian shield lake, 1,500 miles from home, with some of your best buddies is why we go. Catching a bunch of hard fighting, 4 pound tank smallies is just a bonus. Besides .... smallies taste great! And most lodge owners would rather guests eat smallies and leave the walleye alone."
2230370,kzoofisher,2013-11-21 04:22:00,5144,"This. I have great smallmouth and walleye fishing within a couple hours drive at the most, including big fish. I'm talking 50 fish and up days with smallies averaging 3# and many 4's and 5's, walleye in huge numbers if you want to release them instead of just taking a limit and heading in, real shots at 10# plus walleye if I want to head hunt, multiple Muskie days, big stream trout, salmon, perch... Canada for me is about solitude, no distractions for my boys and maybe most importantly customers can't reach me so I don't have any nagging feelings about not doing my job. Thanks to cell phones it is impossible for me to actually get away from my job unless I leave the country. Even if I leave it at home the messages are there when I come back and being available 24/7 is what customer service is about these days. At least when I'm out of the country people still understand that they'll have to accept one of the other guys for a few days. If all I wanted to do was eat great tasting fish I'd save the Canada money and get bluegill and perch within a half hour of home. You can sure catch a meals worth of walleye around Madison, why do you go to Canada?"
2221114,mms3rd,2013-11-15 11:59:00,148,"I have read these posts and the websites until my eyes have bled.Our #1 target is smallmouth with walleyes close behind. Looking for suggestions for some place maybe $1,000 a person or less (outpost, drive in, boat-in).Went to Roger Lake a couple years ago (ne of Minaki) and had tremendous luck....with that lake, luck was not needed. Maybe 25 fish 18 and bigger and nothing under 14.But that is a little pricey for an annual trip. Modest success in Osborne Bay (eagle)...poor success in extreme north Pipestone (Clearwater-Pipestone).An suggestions based upon recent success? Thanks,Mike also in Kansas"
2221170,Hillbiehle,2013-11-15 12:22:00,66,"Lac La Croix is probably the best smallie fishing I've ever experienced. I've fishing many bass tournaments, and hands down Lac La Croix is the best smallie fishing I've ever had. However I never had the feel of remoteness as the lake is a canoe route through Quetico and we stayed at a lodge. I'm sure there are other places with compriable fishing that will still offer the true Canada experience (fly in, etc..). I might consider going back, but I would sacrafice some fishing with something more remote."
2221202,Duflebag,2013-11-15 13:16:00,218,"Mike, I have probably my best and consistent smallmouth fishing on Eagle Lake late in the season. Usually the third week of September and the next few weeks see the smallmouth congregate on reefs in Eagle. Many fish of 18 or over at this time of year. It's pretty cold but that is when they move up and concentrate on the reefs. Excellent luck with lindy rigs with a four foot leader, number 1 circle hook and big chubs for bait. Five and six inch chubs work best. Let those smallies run when they pick up the bait and run from the school with the chub. Wait till they stop, turn that chub in their mouth and swallow the bait before you start cranking till that hook sets. I have had days of fifty to one hundred fish a day on these reefs.Eagle lake would be a good place for you to look at based on your budget also. there are many resorts on Eagle Lake that would be within your price range. V-Bay Gord's Vermillion Bay resort would be one that meets your needs. He is a regular on WC and would be a good starting point. Eagle also has great walleye and pike fishing too. Good luck and i hope you catch a lot."

My opinion on smallmouth, yes, there are occasions when it is excellent, but to be up front with people I could only say Eagle is an average smallmouth fishery. Some opportunities with portage lakes, but that type of trip does not appeal to all."

Beautiful, but I had trouble catching anything. Mid-June, very warm and sunny everyday. There had to be more fish there than I found. Caught maybe 18 bass for the week....mostly 14 and under. Maybe 5 walleyes.Always tough going somewhere new with that much water.http://pipestonelodge.com/smallmouth-bassthis is kind of funny....coming to a lake near you!"
