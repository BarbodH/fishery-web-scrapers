We went there with Guardian Eagle but we were their last group before he sold it to Slate Falls. Worst trip we have ever had by far! But, it was what was promised and what was delivered. The good news Verne from Slate Falls helped smooth things over and we ended up being with Slate Falls for 10 years before we switched to a drive in trip.To be perfectly honest, we didn't really know what we were doing very well in those early years. We ended up switching to North and South Gull witih Verne until he sold those cabins to John along with Red Pine. My recolection is we switched because we fish walleye and Gull is a better walleye lake than Minnis. But, if you go with Slate Falls, you will not find a better outfitter. We have been going up for 20 years and Verne is easily the top of the list on the best outfitters we have used."

A family outfit... they have upgraded a lot in recent years and I like to see that...you don't feel like they are just throwing you out there like some places do... If you have not been there, its a big lake...lots of water but full of islands so wind is not an issue..you can always move to a less windy area. Bring a GPS unless your memory is better than mine They do give you a decent map...but you know how it is..you are having fun exploring and the next thing you know you forgot where you are... Lots of good walleye and lots of nice pike as well.... No real need for live bait unless thats your thing...we use all artificial now just cause we got tired of dealing with keeping bait alive.. They do sell bait though if you want it... We always seem to catch larger fish on average in Minnis then other lakes ... not sure if it has more feed or what... We also liked the fact that you are pretty much all alone up there and have lots of room to roam so its been a favorite for our group... So if you need help from other fisherman , if you are new to it...might not be your place as you are on your own...Gage and Armit are also good lakes....sometime hard to get into though as they seem to book regulars each summer. We have had good luck finding openings on Minnis. My guess is the sheer size of Minnis might scare some people away- but again lots of islands, nice cabin and good fishing ..can't go wrong I don't think... bring enough guys to fill more than one boat for safety sake... We make it a point of always bringing at least two boats together if we are going a long ways out just in case... you can get 3-4 hours away from camp in no time and while we have never had a boat/motor problem its always nice to have another couple of guys in a second boat with you... Great new fridges by the way...they actually make ice cubes and function like the one you have at home...(They fly you in with plenty of ice- but I like having a freezer/fridge that really works (i do the cooking on our trips) Hope that helps some..."

2261274,MarkMark,2013-12-08 10:10:00,7,Thanks - I was just trying to help someone else out on Miniss... I like the lake and have always done well there... I was turned onto it by a group who had been going there for years...and now we have many years behind us as well... They swore by this lake and they were right- it is good...
