In the middle of the day he took us to the Big Sand Banks.He tied himself up a rig with a #4 Hammered Silver Colorado blade with a long shank hook attached.On this long shank hook he thredded a white double Twister Tail grub.He added a live minnow to this and dropped it over the side.I'm thinking he's looking for a big Northern.I was wrong ,it was his ""go to"" big walleye bait.It didn't take long to realize that the bulked up bait was catching the bigger walleyes.I Have tried it on Lac Seul with mixed success.Sometimes it seems to trigger bigger fish and sometimes they won't hit it.Bill"

2253698,rather-be-fishin,2013-12-04 17:29:00,429,We have had good luck also on Lac Seul with #4 Hammered Silver or Gold Colorado blade with a long shank hook attached & tipped with a minnow. Our guide showed us this rig on our first trip to Lac Seul 10 years ago. We have not tried adding the white double Twister Tail grub so will have to give that a try next summer for sure! 7 months & counting down to next years trip to Lac Seul! :-) RBF
2253914,tuiflies,2013-12-04 19:31:00,158,Talk to the Muskie fishermen and they'll tell you it's not uncommon to hook massive walleyes while they're flying around the lake dragging chew toys big enough for dogs.
