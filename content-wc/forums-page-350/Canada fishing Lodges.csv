2254906,Hillbiehle,2013-12-05 09:41:00,66,I looked at the satelite map of Young's. It appears it is right off the highway (on the island) and appears there are other homes in that area. That doesn't seem accurate as others have mentioned the remoteness. Is their map off and just not centering correctly?
2254946,BreezyPoint,2013-12-05 10:05:00,1581,"I don't stay at Young's but I do fish the area at times. Believe me, once at the camp it will be quite remote. I rarely see boats in Steven's Bay and the road mentioned is a gravel road that you can't see from the lake.I've caught some very nice muskies in Steven's Bay, in addition to nice northerns and smallmouth. I never fished walleyes up that way."
2255466,jambi,2013-12-05 13:45:00,504,"Closest point I see from Young's Island ""thru the woods"" to Hwy 71 is 1.75 miles. There are two other homes in the east end of Stevens Bay (other than the Young's owners home). I've never seen anyone at these houses. There is a boat ramp in Stevens Bay that some of the Crow Lake resorts use. We may see two or three other boats (non-Young's guests) in Stevens Bay during the day but that is about it. I would say we fished about 75% of our week-long trips in Stevens Bay, then the rest in Stoney Portage Bay, or maybe one day up in Whitefish Bay if we feel up to the trolley."
2256626,Troy Mansfield,2013-12-06 06:26:00,22,"Old post probably has the best walleye fishing by far being on lake st Joseph, I've never stayed there, only have boated by, but I do know lake St Joseph. Big pike as well"
2257570,btyreprich,2013-12-06 13:06:00,1067,"It has been several years since I fished Lake St Joseph but I can tell you that the Walleye fishing on the lake is quite good. Great numbers of fish to be sure. Saw it advertised on that old TV show ""Outdoors Adventures"" with Kevin and Debra. That is why we decided to give it a try. We were happy enough there to go back several times over the course of a few years time. Lac Seul is where we have been going for the past several years out of the Ear Falls area. This lake too has good numbers of Walleyes and in our case, we have caught a few bigger fish on Lac Seul versus Lake St Joseph. Both are excellent lakes to be sure. As we live in Illinois, Lac Seul is a lot closer for us. That is why we settled for the Ear Falls area. If you want to give Lake St Joseph a try, check out the Old Post & Village. John Grace and his crew run a good operation."

The gravel road leading down to the landing is a private road, right at 2 kilometers distance from the turnoff on Hwy 71, approx 5 kilometers north of Nestor Falls. In the very back of Stephens Bay where the landing is, there are two other homes and in all the years we've been going to YWC, I've only seen folks there a 1/2 dozen times total, but you wouldn't even know they were there except for seeing a vehicle or two at the homes.It is a five minute boat ride from the landing to the YWC island, and once there you'll not see or hear any other signs of humanity for miles!Much like Jambi, we spend the majority of our time fishing within 5-10 minute boat ride from the camp, but will venture to Stoney Portage (10 minute boat ride to mouth of Stoney), or a day on Whitefish (20+ minute boat ride to the portage in Turtle). Several times we have ventured as far as Miles Bay (45+ minute boat ride), or out around Hay Island (20 minute boat ride), but overall spend our fishing time fairly close as there really isn't a need to go elsewhere. I've tied into 50+ inch Muskies more than a few times within sight of YWC island, and the 1/2 dozen or more prime Walleye holes are all within sight of the island as well.Tis true, Perry & Carol do have YWC listed for sale as Perry's back has been giving him lots of trouble these past couple of years and he's no spring chicken anymore (much like me lol)! Not to worry though, the camp will not be shutting down (except for the normal winter shut down) pending a sale or anything like that, and Perry & Carol will be making their annual rounds to the Sports Shows this winter as usual. Carol will soon have on their website an updated list of all the Sport Shows they will be at this winter and if they are anywhere close, highly recommend stopping by and paying them a visit! Yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,, I'm hooked on YWC, can't help it! Great folks, great camp, GREAT fishing!"
2259394,MarkMark,2013-12-07 13:17:00,7,Sometimes its hard to find a fly in that will allow you to only bring two and then need a guide... Sunset Resort on Lake of the Woods might be a better fit for husband/ wife needing a guide... Nice place very comfortable so your wife won't mind going again... Not as many fish as a rule as fly in- but still plenty of action... technically in MN- buy you will need a passport as you enter thru NW Angle...

2251633,mark27,2013-12-03 15:45:00,5,"Hello, I am new to this forum and need some helpful information on a first time trip to a Canadian fishing lodge. I am interested in a all inclusive american plan with a guide for a 3 day trip for myself and my wife this coming summer 2014. Looking for great pike fishing and walleye fishing. I have some lodges in mind but would like some feed back on accommodations fishing and service. I like to stay in the 2,000 dollar range. With so many websites it's really hard to choose a lodge ? Going to either fly in to Winnipeg or International falls .The lodges I have interest in are. Any feedback would be appreciated Young's wilderness camps- Ontario Old post Lodge - Ontario Eagles Nest resort- Manitoba Jackson's Lodge-Manitoba Halley's Camps -Ontario Pine Island Lodge- Manitoba Moose point Lodge- Ontario"

2251753,thyme to fish,2013-12-03 16:58:00,307,I second the motion...... Youngs is a top shelf resort...... Customer service almost better than all the fish in the water.....almost
2251817,Larry S,2013-12-03 17:43:00,665,"Jackson's own Amphiban Lake Lodge which I went to twice in late 90's. The Lodge is great, food was excellent. Fishing was also excellent ,3 of us caught 4 pike over 40inches in 1998. Walleye fishing ia also excellent caught hundreds largest 27 in The lodge is on the Pidgeon River System, lots of flowing water, lake is very narrow and easy to get around"
2252121,NARDA 1,2013-12-03 20:28:00,636,"Check out www.birchdalelodge.com on Eagle Lake, Vermillion Bay Ontario. 807-227-5262, owners name is Marcel. Runs a great camp, lodge has a grill your own steakhouse in the lodge. With their American Plan you order off a menu instead of everyone eating the same thing. My group has been going there for 25 years. Very nice equipment and cabins, they even have 2 upgrade cabins with hot tubs inside. Package boats have flat floors and pedestal seats with 25hp motors, upgrade boats have flat floors pedestal seats with 40hp motors and graphs and some have trolling motors. You can fish for walleye, smallmouth, lake trout, musky and northern pike. Terry"
2252818,LOW1,2013-12-04 09:58:00,2828,I think that you will have a great time at any of the places you have listed.Don't hesitate to call up the lodges and talk directly to the owners/managers. Or maybe some of the lodges will be at a sport/vacation/boat show near you this winter and you could meet them in person.
2253050,camp chef,2013-12-04 11:43:00,915,This is not on your list but look at the www.bignorthlodge.com website. I have been there many times and love the lodge and the fishing.
2253218,jambi,2013-12-04 13:55:00,504,"Ten trips with my Dad to Young's. Very comfortable setting, great service and food. Ideal place to take your wife. About an hour and a half from International Falls. Oh yeah the fishing was great, too. Would go back but he is unable to go with me, switched to flyouts. Hope to go back someday!"
