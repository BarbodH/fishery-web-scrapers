2051954,Crede,2013-08-23 08:59:00,134,"tuiflies - thanks for your reply and links. I base my question on a thread from 10 Feb 2012 in the ""Ask the MNR"" forum of Thunderbayfishing. fishingboard.thunderbayfishing.com/index.php?showtopic=11321 Note: the website requires you to register with a username/password to view the forums. ""Perch eyes. Can you use them for bait?"" ""I was understanding that no part of a game fish may be used for bait. Is this still true or can you use perch eyes for bait?"" ""Are there lakes that you can use whole perch for bait?"" MNR reply : ""In the 1989 version of the Ontario Fishing Regulations there was a restriction on using fish or fish parts that were not listed as baitfish. That would have prevented a person from using perch eyes. Under the newest version (2007) of the Ontario Fishing Regulations a person cannot use or possess for use as bait an invasive fish (alive or dead) or a live fish that is not a species of baitfish."" ""Therefore perch eyes would be permissible and a dead perch could also be used unless you were fishing in a lake that was restricted to artificial bait only."""
2052490,tuiflies,2013-08-23 12:20:00,158,"Well, there wasn't any mention of using parts of a fish (baitfish or otherwise) specifically so that may be allowed now. I've sent an e-mail to a CO I know so as soon as I hear back from him, I'll pass it on."
2264201,tuiflies,2013-12-09 16:34:00,158,"It took a while but I heard back from the C.O. Here is what he said. ""You cannot use live game fish as bait. Parts of game fish are allowed as long as the parts are/were not suitable for human consumption.""He also noted that ""suitable for human consumption"" has not been defined and that common sense should be used. (i.e. don't use the any part of the fillet)"
2264465,michigan walleye guy,2013-12-09 17:58:00,95,"On our fly in trip in late May/early June, we bring about 75+ dozen live minnows. Angler's Pro Shop in Nestor Falls bags them in oxygen packs, and sends along a few ""bait tamers,"" which allow us to keep the minnows very close to the bottom of the lake when tethered to the dock. We don't lose many minnows this way at all.On our mid- to- late- June trip, we found that we lost a lot of minnows, and then began bringing mostly leeches. Haven't tried bringing crawlers yet, but from all the posts in this thread, I'm going to start bringing some along this summer."
2264649,ricorth07,2013-12-09 19:40:00,1143,perch eyes really work for walleye? you put them on the end of a jig? we have caught sauger and walleye on Cut baitSent from my HTC-PG762 using Tapatalk 2
2265273,Crede,2013-12-10 07:51:00,134,"Tuiflies, Thanks for getting back with the C.O.'s answer. We have never tried using perch eyes for walleye. Occasionally following shore lunch have used a walleye eye on a jig (no tail). It has worked great for vertical jigging or casting."
2267330,Hidden Bay Lodge,2013-12-11 00:34:00,12,"Ask your outfitter to fly in half when you fly in and the other half on the check flight. Thanks what we do at HBL.Leeches work great to. Keep them in the fridge, but change their water. But nothing works as good as minnow."
2267818,Pooch,2013-12-11 08:18:00,4619,"Ditto what hidden bay said. Leeches are the most versitle, but treat them like minnows. Cool and clean water and they last longer than minnows or crawlers, both on a hook and in storage.Fishing with live minnows gives us confidence, but I seem to catch just as many on leeches without the hassle of live minnows. Especially on a fly in. The weight added to take in live minnows isn't worth it. Crawlers seem to always work, but again they are fragile and it takes some decent bait management. As in always, always keep them cool all the time. Same goes for leeches and minnows. Plenty of older posts about bait management on this web site. Just search the just fishing and Canada forums.Pooch"
2044146,phishfearme,2013-08-20 19:24:00,1242,buy them in a plastic bag with only a little water and a whole lot of pure oxygen - then keep the bags AS IS in the fridge or on ice with minimal disturbance until you use them - they'll last a long time this way. if you put them in a minnow bucket and leave them at the dock you'll be using dead minnows - which do work but.... HOWEVER - I agree with gord - use crawlers - MUCH easier and cheaper and essentially as effective. we used to do live minnows on flyins and just gave up - whatta pain. now it's crawlers only but frequently we don't use them all that much - twister jigs do just fine. it is a flyin after all. phish
2044170,2746,2013-08-20 19:32:00,3206,"Live minnows on a fly in? Like others I wouldn't mess with them. Crawlers, gulp and salted minnows if you just have to have a minnow. Crawlers on a spinner rig or a piece on a jig (that's my favorite) should work great."
2044194,NathanH,2013-08-20 19:52:00,697,Crawlers for sure. I was fishing opening weekend and crawlers on a jig were just fine we used minnows too. Crawlers were as if not more effective
2044737,popi,2013-08-21 06:05:00,593,Bait Cycle Blue will help keep them kicking longer.Besides oxygen they also like ice every so often
2046985,Fishoil,2013-08-21 16:10:00,1277,"The last trip way north I took salted minnows, you can't have live ones that far north. After a day or two we gave up on the salties, they were to much work to put on the hook when a twister tail worked just as good. On top of that they could each catch lots of walleyes before changing.I'd bring some salted minnows along but wouldn't bother trying to keep live minnows alive. If it's a quality fly-in lake you won't need them anyway."
2047665,fishguide1800,2013-08-21 20:32:00,84,If your going to a fly out why would you need minnows.use some gulp catch a few walleyes take out the gullets and your good to go as long as a norhern diesnt bitevyou off.end of the day take the jig of the line abd throw it in the fridge or freezer or use a fresh obe.best bait ever.
2048698,tuiflies,2013-08-22 08:49:00,158,"FYI it is illegal to use any game fish (or part there of) not listed as bait fish, for bait in Ontario."
2048826,Dautter,2013-08-22 09:43:00,1,i would check to see if it is legal to bring live bait to Canada. We went to the Quetico national park from the Boundry water canoe area and we were not allowed to bring in live minnows or leeches (we put them on salt)
2049562,tuiflies,2013-08-22 13:02:00,158,"FYI It is illegal to bring any crayfish, salamanders, live fish or leeches into Ontario for use as bait."
2050234,Crede,2013-08-22 16:00:00,134,"Can you provide a link or reference for this? I have read the 2013 Ontario regulations from cover to cover and can't find this. On another website which deals with fishing in the Thunder Bay area, this question was asked of the M.N.R. (""Is it legal to use perch eyes for bait?""). The M.N.R. response in 2012 was that it used to be prohibited to use parts of game fish for bait but that the restriction had been removed with the 2007 regulations. The response continued that it would be legal to use the perch eyes for bait in Ontario unless the lake was ""artificial lures only"". If you have newer info I would appreciate it as I have heard of some anglers who have gone back to occasionally using a walleye eye on a jig following shore lunch after they read the above."
2043290,LAURASDAD,2013-08-20 15:02:00,19,"HelloWill be going on a fly in trip next week for Walleye and Northern in Ontario. There are 4 in our group. We plan on 3 dozen minnows per person per day and we are fishing 5 days.So, our plan is to keep most of the minnows in a cooler and use a battery operated aerator. Will keep some in minnow buckets and keep in the lake.Any and all suggestions are greatly appreciated on how to keep the minnows alive. thanks in advanceLarry"
2043410,Lovetofish,2013-08-20 15:35:00,458,That will work but change your water every day. I got sick of this process and use strickly salted minnows.
2043474,v-bay gord,2013-08-20 15:55:00,3168,Is my math right......60 dozen minnows? My prediction is a lot of dead minnows. If it was me I would be taking in some crawlers and skipping the minnows.
2043490,fishinnut 3446,2013-08-20 16:03:00,638,Did Gord just say they are biting on crawlers over minnows?Now just need to know what color jig has been hot ?
2043498,turtle chain,2013-08-20 16:05:00,1398,we did the cooler and aerator keep the water cool and fresh every morning someone would do minnow management .Take out the dead ones and freeze in zip lock bags they catch fish too good luck
2043530,v-bay gord,2013-08-20 16:27:00,3168,Crawlers ALWAYS work........chartreuse blade on a crawler harness.......the rest is a secret.
2043602,SinOrSwim,2013-08-20 16:46:00,1528,"We used to deal with dead minnows on our fly ins. Even if you keep them in the lake in minnow buckets you will have a ton of dead ones. We took a mesh minnow bucket. This could be done with any container/bucket just drill a ton of small holes. But, we had a collapsible mesh minnow bucket with a velcro closure. We put all our minnow we were not taking out with us on the first day in that bucket, put a rock in it and sank it to the bottom and tied it to the dock. The water was about 3 to 5 feet deep right there. Probably colder and better flow I would imagine but NO DEAD MINNOWS.We tried keeping them in a cooler inside their oxygenated bags etc. Never did the aerator but on a fly-in you will need power and power means batteries."
2043610,Carnhzkr,2013-08-20 16:47:00,964,"Sometimes you can prearrange to have minnows flown in ahead of time so you don't have to bring them with you. If keeping them in standard minnow buckets, be sure to use the kind with a latch on the door. Otters love minnows and can get into just about anything. I stayed on a small lake earlier this year and the water temp on the lake was warm, so I put a rock about the size of a baseball into my buckets and sank them to the bottom where the water was cooler.If it were me, I'd do like others recommended and take in crawlers. They're much easier to manage and work just as well as minnows, IMO."
2043770,MorganMan,2013-08-20 17:43:00,341,Ditto on making sure that whatever you put them in at the dock has a latch that is otter proof. We have footage of an otter eating the **** out of our minnows under a rock by the dock. Just get em deep enough and you should have good luck with little loss.
2044018,Blades-n-Beads,2013-08-20 18:49:00,484,"Mix it up and take salted minnows, live minnows and absolutely crawlers. Especially on a fly in. If I were to skip any of the 3 it would be the live minnows, but if you have the room take them all. Good luck and be safe."
