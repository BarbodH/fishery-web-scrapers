2241458,tshea,2013-11-26 18:31:00,36,Does anyone know if Lac Hebert is in a ZEC or if Tamarac has sole fishing rights ? In other words - if I was to find my own way up to Lac Hebert - could I fish it legally ?? Thanks Todd.

It will not be a drive to lake any time soon thank God! Its one of Quebecs top walleye producing lakes,because its regulated and controlls the number of people on it"
