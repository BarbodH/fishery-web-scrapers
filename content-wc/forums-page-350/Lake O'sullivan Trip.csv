I was mad to say the least, well 10 years later the guys want to make a 1 last trip before they can no longer do it. I heard that Ted sold it to a new guy, I heard some piss and moans about prop damage, along side of the nick-pick hows the fishing, we are going with 4 guys and me and my uncle want to target the Lakers and the other 2 are walleye guys and pike hunters, me I want a 30# laker any tip on that? I'm thinking dipsy, lead core I remember It's a 100ft or better where the lakers are maybe a fish seeker or 2 with bait heads to troll smelts at 60-70ft is Smiths Bay still hot, how about the Black Hole. Any info will be greatly appreciated. Thanks PAP."

Our dates are July 12-19 2boats no motors we like to use our own, and bring our own food. The price was $650.00 per man I didn't think that was to bad, I was hoping $550.000 but can't have everything, well its a long time till then but cant wait."

2239041,Mohleye,2013-11-25 14:23:00,368,"I think there's more than one O'Sullivan's in Canada, maybe be a little more specific.....Ontario? Quebec?"
2239081,Bill Krejca,2013-11-25 14:47:00,6107,I believe the above is in reference to the Quebec lake. Bill
