We've since sold our boat, taken a year off, and now are heading up to Quesnel Lake this year with a camp boat. We'll be with other folks with their own boats so we can trust their GPS/electronics in terms of navigation. My question: How is fishing on Quesnel different than Lake of the Woods? It's the same time of year, same fish, but I know nothing of Quesnel's topography, water color, depth, bottom type, and such. We've always done jigs or hand-tied spinners at Lake of the Woods, and of course the water there is pretty stained. Anybody have experience on this lake? We'll have our jigs and spinners, but should we be preparing with something else?"

Most recently in 2012. We've always gone in August or September (once in October at it was COLD). The two-lake system is famous for big walleye and huge smallmouth. It's one of my favorite fishing spots because you catch smallmouth right along with walleye and the smallmouth run big. The honey hole is a large reef in the middle of Manigotagan. Although, I don't know if the walleye will be congregating on the reef in June. The reef runs as shallow as 13 feet and there's an irregular shelf on the south side that drops from 20ish and gets quite deep. You will likely see lots of boats lined up along the south side of the reef. Especially on the weekend. In summer/fall, we usually catch fish between 24 - 32 fow. Most folks will be using jigs/minnows. We always pulled bottom bouncers with crawlers. Frozen minnows work well there too.I'm very familiar with the lake system. I've had some of my best days ever out on that reef. My only problem with the place is, it takes very little wind and you're unable to fish the reef, and that reef is the only place where we've been able to catch anything with any size to it. I know people do well fishing in Quesnel, where the camp is, but I've just never had much luck anywhere other than on that reef. The camp owner offers the use of his boats on Happy Lake. Not sure, but it might be free if you're renting boats from him. Happy can be a lot of fun. It's mostly smallmouth, but you'll catch walleye too. When you find them, the action can be really fast. The last 11 miles, after you turn off the main road, will take you over an hour, especially if you're pulling a boat. I made the trip one time pulling a fifth-wheel camper and boat behind that. Not sure how I made it, and we'll never make that mistake again. You'll see what I mean. PM me if you'd like any more info."

2266009,Carnhzkr,2013-12-10 12:03:00,964,"I should have mentioned that you'll probably need to bring in your own bait. Sometimes, Peter has frozen minnows for sale, but then again, sometimes he doesn't. We've always brought a flat of crawlers, and I usually pick up a couple tubs of frozen/salted minnows in Pine Falls when we get our licenses. Pine Falls is the last town of any size.One time, we brought in 30 dozen live minnows from Pine Falls. I split the 30 dozen between two minnow buckets. I tied one to the boat and sunk the other bucket among some old stumps to hide it from anyone that might want to help themselves to free minnows. Our first day out, I forgot to bring the bucket into the boat as we headed out to Manigotagan (I doubt I'm the only person in the world that's pulled that trick). We lost every minnow in that bucket, so we went back to retrieve the hidden bucket and evidently an otter found it before we did. Bought 360 minnows and didn't get to use one."
