The bays stretching from Zippel Bay to Bostic Bay to Morris Bay have anywhere from 5 ¾ to 8 inches of ice. A pressure ridge has formed, but has refrozen and is easy to cross over. The lake currently has 5 ½ to 7 inches of ice and fishing is HOT. Walleye limits are being caught in 15-17 feet of water with pink geminis. Northern fishing is predicted to start next week on adjacent bays."
