2177737,moey38,2013-10-21 12:04:00,2,I will be heading to Tamarac end of May beginning of June staying at the Gouin Reservoir Cabin 17. This will be our first time there. We are hoping to catch lots of walleye and big pike. This will be our first time at that outfitter and was wondering if anyone had any experience there or have any tips or good spots. Thanks in advance

They school up in there for some reason in the deeper holes in those bays and spread out along the trees too. Real good on topwater lures or other pike lures that don't snag as easy. Don't be afraid to go too shallow.

Top notch outfitter!The river system back where cabin 17 has fishing restrictions due to spawning grounds. I can't remember it ends and if the cabin is within the no fishing zone. If it is, it's not very far where it stops."

We caught some nice walleye in 9-12 ft of water trolling large plugs in the middle of the day. It was a nice break from casting and some run up to 23""-24""."
