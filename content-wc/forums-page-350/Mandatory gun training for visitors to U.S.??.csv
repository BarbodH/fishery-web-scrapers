2237242,Skywagon,2013-11-24 13:56:00,1106,Sorry. Back to watching the lake make ice.
2237394,kzoofisher,2013-11-24 17:02:00,5144,I really like the next story down about the Texas town adding sugar to water to get residents to drink more. I think I'll bookmark that site.
2239121,Mark R,2013-11-25 15:09:00,1538,why would they need gun training they aren't allowed to own guns are they?
2239233,mrwalleye5,2013-11-25 15:55:00,1922,Yes but we need to know how to duck!
2239281,3M TA3,2013-11-25 16:14:00,2846,"Actually I think the training is probably a good idea. I'm having trouble accepting that the Canadian Parliament has proposed that all non residents must be 50 years or older to consume alcoholic beverages in any of Canada's Provinces. On November 20, 2013 the Honorable Jean Claude Beliut of Batt La Blue Parish proposed such a measure for parliamentary debate and that debate will be brought forward in February, 2014. Now that is outrageous."
2240417,LOW1,2013-11-26 08:40:00,2828,You got to love Canadian ploitics. Any truth to rumour that Rob Ford will quit as mayor of Toronto and take the similar job at Vermillion Bay? This might liven the place up a little.
2240473,v-bay gord,2013-11-26 09:03:00,3168,Rumor has it there is not enough for him to eat here in Vermilion Bay...
