2273394,wallydave,2013-12-13 20:47:00,2151,"For those of us south of the border, someday of us are just getting our first serious snowfall. Did the ice start out with just cold or snow and cold? From some posts I have read, how the ice starts can have some influence on the thaw!"
2273410,zeebee,2013-12-13 21:35:00,1144,what influences the thaw is the heat
2273434,BreezyPoint,2013-12-13 21:38:00,1581,"A large snowpack early in the season can result in less ice thickness. This is exactly what has happened in central Minnesota. There is already one report of a Jeep going through the ice, despite temperatures down to -30. The snow insulates the ice."
2273866,Limeyangler,2013-12-14 08:20:00,563,"The ice underfoot there was slush that had froze solid again. Its going to be messy here this year. We got the lakes all skimmed and literally the next day it started dumping snow for 2 weeks straight ..lots of slush out there. It is really cold here now and has been an average -25C daytime and -30C night, but the snow has insulated the ice, I still have not heard the lake 'booming' (making ice) which usually is the case when its this cold. The ice road on Wabigoon only opened yesterday (officially ..there are always those who cross early in an attempt to qualify for this years 'Darwin Awards') and there is 'reportedly' 15"". However, it is only a third the usual width as it normally would be with that ice thickness with at least 2 very narrow sections where they have been unable to plow due to slush. I have only lived here for 7 years, but keep a pretty good record of ice in/out times and conditions with my fishing reports /pics and videos. I would have to conclude that first ice conditions can influence ice out but are not going to help you predict ice out conditions with any accuracy. For example, we had great first ice and great -20C to -30C temps with practically ZERO snow in December 2011 ..the pics below were taken between 4th and 10th December that year (the deer was in front of our house and just gave up trying to get up from the slick ice), but that cold, snow free, early ice up was followed by the earliest ever ice out recorded up here in the spring of 2012. We we're fishing a whole week in the boat before the close of walleye season!!!! In fact i have a cool pictures and video of us fishing in the boat at Eagle lake the first week of April 2012! The picture with me holding the stringer is in exactly the same spot as the picture i originally posted(Osbourne Bay, Eagle Lake)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIwzaYeAy9whttp://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...IMG_1437-1.jpghttp://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...IMG_1448-1.jpghttp://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...IMG_1450-1.jpg So .lol .answer your question? The ice in/out of the lakes around here are obviously very dependant on location, size, depths etc .and the areas of the two lakes (Wabigoon and Eagle) I mention here are similar in those aspects and have almost identical ice in/out times. There is a handy record of Wabigoon lake ice in/out dates for the last 50 years at least at the link below .gives you a good sense of what you can normally expect.http://www.wintle.on.ca/wabigooniceout.htm Hope this was useful. Simon ."
