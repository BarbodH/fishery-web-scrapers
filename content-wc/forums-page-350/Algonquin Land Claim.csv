2244137,kzoofisher,2013-11-28 04:20:00,5144,"Not so sure all the bad treatment ended 150 years ago. Here's a story from the Miami Herald and I just read another one about a kid in the Bronx who was held for 33 months because he couldn't make bail. He was eventually released without ever being brought to trial. Also, a lot of what we ""give"" to tribes in the US is just living up to our obligations under the treaties we signed with them. I have no problem with the government keeping its word, wish it happened more often.Quote: Earl Sampson has been stopped and questioned by Miami Gardens police 258 times in four years.He’s been searched more than 100 times. And arrested and jailed 56 times.Despite his long rap sheet, Sampson, 28, has never been convicted of anything more serious than possession of marijuana.Miami Gardens police have arrested Sampson 62 times for one offense: trespassing.Almost every citation was issued at the same place: the 207 Quickstop, a convenience store on 207th Street in Miami Gardens.But Sampson isn’t loitering. He works as a clerk at the Quickstop.So how can he be trespassing when he works there?It’s a question the store’s owner, Alex Saleh, 36, has been asking for more than a year as he watched Sampson, his other employees and his customers, day after day, being stopped and frisked by Miami Gardens police. Most of them, like Sampson, are poor and black.And, like Sampson, many of them have been cited for minor infractions, sometimes as often as three times in the same day.Saleh was so troubled by what he saw that he decided to install video cameras in his store. Not to protect himself from criminals, because he says he has never been robbed. He installed the cameras — 15 of them — he said, to protect him and his customers from police.Since he installed the cameras in June 2012 he has collected more than two dozen videos, some of which have been obtained by the Miami Herald. Those tapes, and Sampson’s 38-page criminal history — including charges never even pursued by prosecutors — raise some troubling questions about the conduct of the city’s police officers.The videos show, among other things, cops stopping citizens, questioning them, aggressively searching them and arresting them for trespassing when they have permission to be on the premises; officers conducting searches of Saleh’s business without search warrants or permission; using what appears to be excessive force on subjects who are clearly not resisting arrest and filing inaccurate police reports in connection with the arrests.“There is just no justifying this kind of behavior,’’ said Chuck Drago, a former police officer and consultant on police policy and the use of force. “Nobody can justify overstepping the constitution to fight crime.”Repeated phone messages and emails to Miami Gardens Police Chief Matthew Boyd and City Manager Cameron Benson asking for comment on this story were not returned.Boyd did release a statement, saying that the department is committed to serving and protecting the citizens and businesses in the city.But Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union Florida, said that’s exactly what Boyd is NOT doing.“Where is the police chief in all this? In a police department in a city this size, this kind of behavior could not escape his attention. Doesn’t the City Commission know that they are exposing the city to either massive liability for civil rights violations? Either that, or they are going to wake up one day and find the U.S. Department of Justice has taken over its police department.’’Saleh and his attorney, Steve Lopez, are preparing to file a federal civil rights lawsuit, contending that the police department has routinely, under the direction of the city’s top leaders, directed its officers to conduct racial profiling, illegal stops and searches and other activities to cover up illegal misconduct.Full Story1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Next »Read more here: http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/11/2...#storylink=cpy"
2244249,2746,2013-11-28 06:28:00,3206,"No, sadly, all bad treatment has not stopped. We are as divided racially, politically and economically as any time in our history. Laws and government can't change that.....only people, one at a time, caring about and helping each other will make a difference. It's a good time of the year to try a different approach in in the way we treat each other."
2240313,Jig A Lowe,2013-11-26 07:56:00,87,Has anyone heard anything recently about the status of the Algonquin Land Claim in southeastern Ontario?
2240753,Skywagon,2013-11-26 12:10:00,1106,"I don't know much about the walleye fishing there, but if we had a rant and rave section here, that topic could bring a lot of good discussion. Since we don't, my guess is in the end, the Canadian taxpayer will probably pay to make that one go away."
2240857,phishfearme,2013-11-26 13:01:00,1242,"see:http://www.ontario.ca/aboriginal/algonquin-land-claim even after negotiations and public comment, both the algonquins and the Ontario government need to approve it. a tough task. in the US, the supreme court in 1980 ruled that the US government must compensate the Lakota Indians for the taking of the black hills in south Dakota. they dreamed up some large $ number but the Lakota said no thanks, we want our land back - it's sacred to their tribe. so, the whole thing sits in limbo. phish"
2240969,wallydave,2013-11-26 14:15:00,2151,"Who will offer the ""manditory gun training""?"
2241121,oleJoe,2013-11-26 15:45:00,114,"They still pay the native americans every so often that live on the reservations for the increase in land value. It will never end. I,m of Irish decent and am still waiting on them to compensate me for the potato famine!"
2243522,2746,2013-11-27 14:45:00,3206,It's interesting. The way we treated the Indians and the slaves brought to the USA generations ago was horrible but......we've done more damage since then by continuing to give and give in an effort to make amends. The old saying about training a man to fish has merit. If we had or even now would offer training to help those in need be productive it would be the greatest gift we could give.
2243633,tooski,2013-11-27 15:38:00,393,"Not sure of the analogy between the potato famine and the Algonquin land claim. And with due respect to Larry I can't see how what we have done since the raping of natives of their land rights can possibly be worse than the original power abuse. They do not want to be acclimated to our lifestyle, why is that wrong?"
2243641,Skywagon,2013-11-27 15:42:00,1106,"Free education and training is readily available on this side of the border for that population. Our area is rich in timber, minerals, with a viable tourist industry, there are many good paying jobs available for those that want to work in those or related fields, but most in the fastest growing population in Canada opts not to work. As in walleye fishing, all it takes is a good work ethic to make your dreams come true, unfortunately that ethic seems to have been lost due to overcompensation by the government for the sins of the past."
2243714,2746,2013-11-27 16:28:00,3206,"It's been 150 years and we can't go back and change what happened. I wish we could but as the saying goes, ""it is what it is"". Simply opting out by saying I don't want to acclimate to the country or economy as it is dooms anyone, native or not, to living in destitution or on hand outs. Not much of a future. I choose to teach my children to become productive in the environment we live in rather than continuing to support them into adulthood because I know they will be happier that way. We should/could do as much for our native Americans. As to the question ""why is that wrong"" I suppose one could say nothing is wrong but the way I've seen native Americans living on or around reservations for generation after generation sure doesn't look right. I also know we can't make it better through more gifts or payments......it will never be better for the next generation until they get education and/or training. Nuff said I guess but I've spent time on reservations here in the Midwest and the lives I see those kids living can break your heart."
2243754,tooski,2013-11-27 16:49:00,393,I see your point then Larry. Thanks for the reply. I guess if there were an easy solution we would already have done it. Have a great holiday season.
