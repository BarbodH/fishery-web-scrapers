2252458,Bill Krejca,2013-12-04 07:37:00,6107,"Moon - Thanks, I'll check it out. I think the switch is the culprit, tho. Bill"
2252546,Moondog,2013-12-04 07:59:00,362,"Bill, I thought so too and the volume also didn't work but changed the batteries in the head set took care of it. It had a rechargeable battery in it and it went bad so just replaced it with a alkaline battery. This battery was in the headset not the charger. Hope it fixes it. BTW.......lost my hearing listening to Creedence and the Doobie Bros!!!!"
2252626,Golden Eagle,2013-12-04 08:53:00,2642,Losing hearing to excessive farm machinery is bad. Losing hearing to Beaver and Cessna sounds is good.

2279122,115 optimax,2013-12-16 17:14:00,650,"What kind of noisy equipment did you use to run?...I'm in the Chip truck everyday and now I find the constant sound of the Turbos,engine brake,motor and loud Sirius radio is starting to bother my hearing.I tried wearing ear plugs,but then I can't really hear the other drivers that good so i don't wear them anymore.I don't want to cause a pile up in the back roads!LOL"
2279258,tuiflies,2013-12-16 18:04:00,158,"115, sounds like you need a good pair of noise canceling ear defenders! They filter the constant drone of the engine and machinery but allow you to hear voices and radios. They will seem expensive (~$300) but if you check out the cost of hearing aids (~$1500-$6000) they are a bargain! Our mechanics use Bose QC 15's when they are working around planes with their engines running and they are incredible! You really need to try them to believe it."
2279458,115 optimax,2013-12-16 19:05:00,650,"I'm going to check them out on line.If they work that good around planes it should be a breeze in the Chip truck.I need to hear the music though,or else I won't want to work.lLOL..Thanks for the info........."
2279466,tuiflies,2013-12-16 19:10:00,158,"There's a plug to connect to a phone or a ""line out"" jack if your radio has one. Might have Bluetooth for your phone too I think."
2280089,Skywagon,2013-12-17 07:15:00,1106,"115 Optimax, to answer your question: I have spent a lifetime in and around a wide assortment of things that have big tires, tracks, or 18 wheels and there was a time some did not have cabs. Every new piece of equipment that we buy today has improved from the series before, but as you know, they are still not perfect, thus the hearing loss.Tuiflies has the right idea for you on the noise cancelling headset. We wear them today in airplanes, why not in noisy equipment? You will probably want something wireless to mate up to your cell phone, Sat radio and FM business radio, (I would guess the FM radio would be the tricky part). If it were me, I would want to stay away from a wired connection if at all possible, as it can get restrictive at times. It is worth pursuing. As an update, a few days ago I received the Sennheiser RS 170 headset I ordered. They do make a significant difference in being able to understand what is being said on television, so mission accomplished. To the downside, they are a headset and you know they are there. In the end, being able to hear, outweighs the negative of wearing the headset for me."
2249674,Skywagon,2013-12-02 14:36:00,1106,"No dishnet, have direct, the new headset doesn't use Bluetooth so I am OK. The Sennheiser model that I am getting was almost $300 with shipping and taxes, so I am hoping for the best. If that doesn't work, I will get one of those megaphone things, stick it in my ear and practice reading lips."
2250258,Golden Eagle,2013-12-02 19:29:00,2642,"Suggest getting something for listening while out in the bush. Don't want a hungry bear to get close enough for you to read his lips. Screw TV shows, as they don't bite."
2250594,Pooch,2013-12-03 03:03:00,4619,A little winter paranoia setting in already Golden Eagle?Pooch
2250634,2746,2013-12-03 06:02:00,3206,"I have not been able to prove this yet but but have noticed that wives in particular speak more softly as they get older. I'm certain this is true because after I say huh? A couple time she is able to speak much louder and more clearly. . While we're on the subject I've also noticed the younger generation speaks very fast and mumbles terribly.....don't know why their parents don't correct that. Regarding TV's, the volume controls have been changed on the newer sets. A vol. of 9 or 10 was sufficient on older units but the newer ones require they be turned up to 20 or 25 to produce the same sound. Things just are not like they used to be!"
2250778,Golden Eagle,2013-12-03 07:13:00,2642,"larrym, I'm experiencing a slight hearing loss in my right ear that causes problems when I'm driving and my soft speaking wife is riding shotgun. I have no problems hearing anything else I want to hear. Pooch, I've been around a lot of bears while up yonder. Back in October 2005 we ran into one that intended to eat me, just two days before a cold snap that would have had him going for a winter sleep. We did everything possible to chase him off and he kept coming back."
2250882,Pooch,2013-12-03 07:49:00,4619,Bear must have been really hungry. Surely he was aware that we crabby old guys are tough as an old shoe and it takes a fair amount to BBQ sauce or mayo to make us remotely palatable.Have a safe winter.Pooch
2251313,Skywagon,2013-12-03 11:23:00,1106,"Larrym (and I know Pooch can relate to this),When I was a young whippersnapper growing up on the farm, I can remember working out in the field on an open tractor listening to WLS, the radio would be turned all the way up, my mother would say she could hear me singing along with the radio all the way to the house. I just can't understand why my hearing is not as good today, maybe if WLS had been talk radio back then.....Connie, that bear just needed an attitude adjustment."
2251337,Moondog,2013-12-03 11:44:00,362,"Bill, I have sony as well and you can change the batteries even tho the headphones sit on a charger. Just pop open and replace and it will work as good as new. Moondog"
2251361,2746,2013-12-03 11:54:00,3206,"Yep, have the same memories although my time was in Iowa, different radio station and sitting on an M farmall tractor. 1950-1965 and then graduated from college and left the farm behind. Was a good time but also very different from farming today....I doubt I could run a new tractor or combine today."
2251425,Golden Eagle,2013-12-03 12:20:00,2642,"I pick up WLS about 6 times every fishing season, going and coming. Bruno is now in bear ****. I have what's left of the spent cartridge."
2247385,Skywagon,2013-11-30 16:14:00,1106,"This is not really fishing related, other than I can't hear the Outdoor Channel, but I am looking for advice on purchasing some sort of wireless headset for watching television. Too many years in noisy equipment has made my hearing less than perfect, it is getting to be a struggle any more understanding television dialog. I am willing to spend what it takes (within reason). Anyone have any real life experience with these? Thanks for any help."
2247441,Fred_G,2013-11-30 18:00:00,908,"My wife uses TV Ears. She got the idea from her dad, who was also hard of hearing. She says they work great. As I remember they're less than $100."
2247457,zeebee,2013-11-30 18:12:00,1144,What?...speak up!
2247473,Bill Krejca,2013-11-30 18:19:00,6107,"The good news is that Sony remote headphones, which I obtained from Best Buy for a little over $100 several years ago, work very well, giving a great clear sound. The bad news (for me) is that it appears to exceeded it's self life. If I can't fix, I'll pick up another one. Bill"
2247841,Skywagon,2013-12-01 08:20:00,1106,"I knew I was probably not the only one with this problem. It is always nice to get an idea what might be working well for someone else with a similar issue. The Sennheiser 170 or 180 seem to get a lot of good press. My location makes it difficult to actually try anything out, so reviews from ""real"" people are much appreciated."
2247921,Jimmy Jig,2013-12-01 09:44:00,1905,2 years ago I bought a cordless headset by Sony. I love it. Try the Sony web site or go to a Sony Dealer.....
2248585,Pooch,2013-12-01 20:34:00,4619,"Skywagon, you are the first farmer I've ever met that admitted he couldn't hear. My wife constantly tells me my hearing is shot, but I just think that everyone else just mumbles when they talk.Snowing up there? Fishable ice?Pooch"
2248778,Skywagon,2013-12-02 06:09:00,1106,"Pooch, I have all the classic farmer symptoms, ringing in my ears, finding it difficult to hear when in a crowded room, distinguishing words, other than that, I hear great. I broke down and ordered the Sennheiser RS 170 headset. As is typical, the best price in Canada was about $65 higher than in the US. Free shipping, what's that? (only if you pay more). Hope they work. Yes, we are making ice, 7 inches of good ice in front of our house as of Friday. It snows some every day, so that is accumulating also. Snowmobiles are ready to go, ice auger is ready, just need to pick up some minnows today and ice fishing will begin."
2248850,Paul H,2013-12-02 06:58:00,1232,Just a note. If you have Dish and a Hopper you can use Bluetooth headphones.
2249418,Ferrispata,2013-12-02 12:28:00,63,I will second the Sennheiser wireless headphones. We own a set. And have just purchased another for my great aunt. They have a set that goes for $79 and another for about $89. On Amazon.com.
