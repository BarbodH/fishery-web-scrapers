I'd like to take my 15 yo son on a fly-in next year, and since most outposts have a 4-person minimum party size, I was wondering if there was another duo that'd be interested in hooking up. The first two weeks in August would be the ideal time, before school starts. I cross at IF, so would consider any trip with an air base between Minaki and Nakina, including Ear Falls, Red Lake, and Sioux Lookout areas.Another father/son would be ideal (although, my boy might prefer a father daughter ), but it wouldn't have to be. We could jump in with another small group.Shoot me an email or PM if interested."

2229434,MrSimon,2013-11-20 14:24:00,922,"I think its great you are taking your son on a fishing trip up North!! But, taking one with complete strangers is a really big risk. Group dynamics on a fly-in are more important than the fishing, location, and weather combined. And its not that the other guys will be bad dudes or anything, they just might have different expectations and approach things differently than you and your son. Being stuck at an outpost for a full week with guys you might not click with can ruin a trip .... especially if you have your kid along. My recommendation is to find people at home you and your son know well who would go too .... even if they aren't really fishermen. It also makes the logistics and coordination a lot easier."
2229882,Steve of Madison,2013-11-20 18:25:00,230,Might I suggest you do a drive too camp! For all of the reasons listed already and there are plenty that will accomodate just the 2 of you.
2230218,Carnhzkr,2013-11-20 20:38:00,964,"Let me level set here. I'm not some guy saying, ""Which direction is Canada? I think I'll go on a fly-in"". I'm not asking for suggestions on where or how. I've fished Saskatchewan, NWT, all over Manitoba, and most of Ontario. Literally, I've been on somewhere between 50 - 60 Canadian fishing trips. The trip I'm planning with my son will be his 13th trip. I have two trips booked out of Lac Seul Lodge next year, but I was thinking about changing one of them to an outpost fly-in. Nearly all of the outfitters I've checked with understandably require a minimum of four. Some show on their websites that they will allow parties of two, but they charge and arm and a leg for it. I've only been on six fly-in trips, but on three of those, my dad and I were paired with another couple. On those trips, we had no idea who we'd be paired with until we met them at the plane. Those all worked out okay. Mostly, we'd go our way and they'd go theirs, and we'd make dinner together. I just thought I'd throw a post out to see if there's another twosome looking to make it a foursome. If so, let's talk and see where it goes. If not, I'll be back at Lac Seul."

2230874,Mike Kansas,2013-11-21 09:02:00,1463,"What a great opportunity for another Father/Son team to join you. If I had a son that age I would be after something like this. I have been on many trips with new people that I had never met and they all worked out great. There is something about fisherman and the common interest of fishing that makes the new relationships work out. I guess it's the love of fishing. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
2231154,2746,2013-11-21 11:26:00,3206,"Try the ""share a seat"" board here on WC. You might pick up some additional posters. I think it's a great idea and worth the try!"
2232130,walleye88ia,2013-11-21 22:12:00,35,"I think someone trying to set up a fishing trip with 1 or more people they have never met is terrific. Some people only take trips with the 2-4 people they know. Life is short. Taking a trip every 2-4 years wont cut it for me. You only live once. Take more trips. If you know others that stay home,let them. Too many lakes. Not enough time."
