If we cancel before 60 days prior, we get it all back, or we can roll it over until next year with no penalty on a one-time basis and still hold our reservation for the next year. Miss 2x, though, and the cabin is up for grabs."
2185858,SinOrSwim,2013-10-26 08:07:00,1528,"Our drive in cabin is $100.00 per man and there has to be a certain number of deposits in. For instance, if we rent a 6 man cabin, we need something like 3 deposits to hold it. But, if we rent a 12 man cabin there has to be 6 or 8 deposits. I don't remember the number and to be honest, I have no idea what the refund policy is? Our groups are big enough when one or two cancel, it doesn't change the trip.Our fly-in outfitter we used for many years was $250.00 per person. That is just a bigger cost, so the percentage is approx the same. I mentioned in another thread we go in the fall and our week changes every year. So, we don't worry about reserving a specific cabin for a specific week. So, we also don't worry about when a deposit is due. We send in a deposit when we figure out what week works for us and if the cabin we want is open."
2187394,Jimmy Jig,2013-10-27 12:49:00,1905,"$100. for the cabin payable before the end of Feb., refundable if cancelled before 60 days of the arrival date. Thats about as good as it gets!"
2189889,Minnow Man,2013-10-28 18:14:00,85,"We are booked on a cruise ship this winter, it had to be paid in full months ago, and we are leaving in Dec. The Canadian Lodges seems to be the only vacation destination that we pay for once we get there, every other vacation we take, Jamaica, Dominion Republic, Mexico all must be paid in full long before we get there. So to pay a few hundred dollars deposit is a bargain."
2190937,Mohleye,2013-10-29 07:18:00,368,"The good thing about a deposit of 2 or 3 hundred bucks due by Jan 1 or something along those lines, is that it gets people off the pot. When we took bigger groups we always had 2 or 3 guys who ""wanted"" to go, but never committed. It also makes you put your heads together and decide on a week that works, if that's an issue."
2208121,Thumpr50,2013-11-07 07:32:00,139,"$200 per person is what is required to guarantee our stay, seems reasonable to us and helps soften the final bill due when we leave. Have no issues with it at all."
2226274,roscoe33,2013-11-19 00:16:00,653,"Amazingly, Lac des Mille lodge only want $75 per person for deposit, and they request you send it after January 1st. Cash only, no credit cards.Deposits are refundable before April 1 ??Or transferable to open dates if you need to reschedule to a different week.I get 200 from each person in our group, to discourage drop outs.I/we have no problem with a sizable deposit, or a minimum on a cabin(s), but any resort that wants full payment up front, 6-12 months in advance, for unseen accommodations, that may not even be in business next year, has another guess coming.Also, we used to bring a large group up every year, and when you are talking 20 people spread over 5 families, it is hard to get definite head counts a year in advance.Now, if the resorts are looking to draw in some first time visitors to Canada and increase their annual head counts, they might have to take some chances."

2260586,weston,2013-12-07 22:12:00,18,Our resort requires 20% of total bill. Booking is not secure until deposit is received. No time frame on when deposit is due. Deposit is typically non refundable (need a real good excuse).
2261746,michigan walleye guy,2013-12-08 13:39:00,95,"We pay $400 per person deposit at Nestor Falls Fly In Outposts. As someone previously noted, it gets guys off the pot, so I have no problem with this."
2183954,rather-be-fishin,2013-10-24 17:51:00,429,"Taking a survey. 1. Just wondering what is the per person deposit amount required to hold your reservation for next year at your resort in NW Ontario area lakes (Lac Seul, Eagle, Cedar, Perrault, LOTW, Red, Cliff, Wabaskang) etc? 2. When is the deposit due? 3. Is it refundable or transferable & if so what is criteria? OR is it non-refundable? Just noticed on the NW Ontario Canada resort's website that we have gone to for the past 10 years for the 2014 rates, the per person deposit rate cost was DOUBLED from all previous years. I feel this is a DRASTIC increase and am curious if any other area resorts are doing the same thing? Also it is due in end of December which is not a good time. Appreciate any and all comments and in put. Thank you! RBF"
2183962,Duflebag,2013-10-24 17:56:00,218,My camp requires a $300 per person deposit. They will not hold a date until the deposit is received. I know the owners well and know that requiring the $300 per person has stopped a lot of folks that blocked prime weeks and ended up no shows. It has resulted in much better scheduling. I know many of the other customers and we are all happy with the process.
2184074,wallydave,2013-10-24 18:37:00,2151,"Both places I have gone to ask $100 for deposit within a week of making the reservation. I will usually send a check for 200, just to pay ahead on the final bill!"
2184186,port1042,2013-10-24 19:20:00,509,"My deposit for 2014 increased from $100 to $250 per person. It is refundable up to the 1st of March and can be applied to different dates after that. I have a hunch a lot of no shows last spring because of the late ice out is the reason most lodges have increased the fee. I think $100 was a small price to pay for guys who were afraid of the weather. That really screwed the lodge owners. I guess I really don't mind. It's not like the rates when up (at least not more than expected), it 's just the deposit."
2184234,Rich B,2013-10-24 19:36:00,1081,"The camp we go to for the Opener in NW Ontario requests a $200 deposit per man......

2184522,kzoofisher,2013-10-25 02:44:00,5144,"10%-20% of a weeks stay seems typical and reasonable, refundable with at least three months notice and sometimes longer. After I had some guys back out late last year I take $200 non-refundable from everybody who is going. If they can get a reasonable replacement they can have their money back but I'm not going to foot 80% of the cost again and I'm not going to listen to guys doing shots and blasting Nine Inch Nails at 2am either. I would much rather have ten months notice that the trip is going to cost X than worry about who isn't going to show up just so I can save a little money. Seems like anybody who can't come up with $200 on a months notice probably isn't going to have the money next summer either. Actually, as wallydave said, it's money you're ahead when the trip comes so the cost in the summer actually drops by 20% or so. Not bad when you look at it that way."
2184578,UKBDM,2013-10-25 06:24:00,178,Our camp on Wabaskang requires $200 per cabin due first week in Dec. Very reasonable because I don't think there is much turnover year to year.
2185210,Skyraptor,2013-10-25 14:42:00,291,"Where we go it is $200 per person for a week and that is for housekeeping. On their moose hunt the deposit is 50% of the total price or about $2900. Moose hunt is Non-cancelable, but transferable."
2185322,Fisherman Ted,2013-10-25 16:19:00,461,"As an owner we require one third deposit up until 12/31, which is fully refundable up until 12/31 as well. Once we get into the 1st of the year the deposit rises to 50% and then finally 100% when we are in the season (i.e. May 15th). Once we hit 1/1 the deposits are not refundable. This is something I personally have been wrestling with for sometime. Many lodges make you pre-pay up front as you get closer to the date. There are so many permutations on how lodges address this. But I have been burned before. If a fisherman books in October and pays a small amount and then tells me in April he isn't coming its a big issue. Keep in mind that staffing and even guide requests are also affected which cause pain to other guests, not just the lodge. As someone else pointed out there is significant risk to owners (all the risk actually) when people bail at the last minute. Can you imagine if an airline only charged people 20% to book a flight? I highly recommend all my guests buy travel insurance. Best thing going. For pennies on the dollar you get real peace of mind."
2185346,JAY221,2013-10-25 17:41:00,877,"Where we are going on Wabaskang it is 200.00 per cabin & it isn't confirmed until they get the money. Later, Jay"
