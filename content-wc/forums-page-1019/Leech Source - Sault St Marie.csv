512583,Wallhanger,2001-05-15 10:02:00,17,Looking for a source for leeches by the pound between SS Marie and Wawa?
512584,Keith,2001-05-16 02:18:00,48,As you are leaving SSM try the Trading Post. It is on Rt 17 on the right just as you go out of town. It has a bunch of canoes on the north side of the building.In Wawa try Youngs General Store. It is just past the big goose. They sell all sorts of neat things. Don't forget to get an ice cream cone too!! Good Luck

512586,Reelmn,2001-05-16 15:20:00,328,Purchase your leeches at Young's General store in Wawa. Their leeches have always been good and don't forget to grab a handful of Northland Tackle Whistler jigs in 1/16&1/8. They always produce walleye for me when tipped with leeches or crawlers.
512587,Wallhanger,2001-05-17 06:40:00,17,I'm familiar with the places mentioned and appreciate the replys. Didn't realize they have leeches available by the pound?
512588,Guest,2001-05-18 09:26:00,0,Just got back from the Ontario bush pike and trout stopped at Youngs on the way back for gas---the MNR has taken the big MOOSE THAT WAS on the porch.len
512589,Guest,2001-05-18 15:34:00,0,Sorry to hear that the MNR took the moose. Was there any particular reason that they did so?
512590,Guest,2001-05-19 14:25:00,0,The young man at the store said that the MNR thought the moose might have been purchased by the owner which is against the law--the moose has been there as long as I have been going north.len
512591,Guest,2001-05-28 12:42:00,0,"Actually, the moose is new, the old one kinda fell apart. Henrietta being ""kidnapped"" by the MNR has created all sorts of chaos up here. In fact, Wawa locals started a yellow ribbon campaign to have him returned...we get a little loco up north after a long winter....:p"
