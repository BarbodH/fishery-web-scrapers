Hope you all are as excited and ready to have a good time.My wish for all is to PLEASE drive carefully - be sure to trade off with other drivers. It's not a race and the winners will be the people that get there ALIVE. Please keep in mind as well if you're going across at Intl. Falls, that it often is slow going, so be patient. That's it -- have a good, safe trip ........by the way, after this low pressure cold front moves through after this weekend, don't you think the 'eyes are just going to be HUNGRY?????Baxman"
