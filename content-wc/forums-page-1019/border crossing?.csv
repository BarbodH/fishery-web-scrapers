This year, one guy has to work the Friday evening we'd normally leave home. I'm trying to figure out the best time to leave to make the border crossing as smooth as possible and still get some fishing in that day.How early on Saturday morning in June do you have to be at the border to avoid a long line? During what hours is the line normally the longest on a Saturday morning in June? When does the line start to shrink? Thanks"
