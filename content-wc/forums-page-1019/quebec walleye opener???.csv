512673,Guest,2001-05-21 09:45:00,0,Needz to fish:Check out the following web site for the information you require:http://www.fapaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/index1.htmThat brings you to the english version of the Quebec Parks web site. Select regulations for 2001-2002 and get your information for the zone you will be fishing. Jay
