Last year year they had and were having so much rain that the water level on the river was way up and it was carrying alot of trash. We couldn't get where we wanted to go. Anyone heard about the rain-water levels up there now. We are taking bigger boats up this year so that we have more options as far as lakes etc.Need to know off some good areas to put in around Ear Falls. (Other than on the river, below the dam)Does anyone fish the river, below Manitou Falls?"

We fish out of Naughty Pines Fish Camp (NorthWestOntarioFishing.com of npfishcamp.com, they are running a really nice special right now so check them out.The River is still high but the Walleyes seem to be in the current.Let me know if you need anything else,.ThanksSharon[email protected]"
