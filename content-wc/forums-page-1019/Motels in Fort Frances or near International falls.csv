512317,Shawn,2001-05-07 19:46:00,33,"""The Fort"" really has 2 Hotels in town that are good and Clean, the Red Dog and the Voyager Inn. The Red Dog is closer to the border crossing and a litle more reasonable, but the Voyager is right on Rainy Lake, so I guess it's a trade off. I used to work a sales territory that covered the Fort, and I always stayed at the Voyager, good food and good service and you can't beat the view. There may be some smaller hotels closer, but I have never stayed there personally. I hope I was able to help.Shawnwww.fishingxcanada.com Walleye's and a whole lot more!"
512318,Guest,2001-05-08 15:37:00,0,The Super 8 in International Falls is good.
512319,BD,2001-05-08 17:47:00,739,"We stay at the Super 8 in International Falls. It's a nice clean place with rooms for smokers and nonsmokers, so you don't get a room you can't stand or you get one allready stunk up (make a reservation). Don't eat at the resturant by the motel (our opinion). Go to Barney's. It's on 2cd(?) Street south of the main drag in a small shoping center.Another choice, a little out of the way is the Emo Inn. Nice place with a great resturant."
512320,HLLGuide,2001-05-08 21:00:00,10,"Being from Int'l Falls, I would recommend The Super 8 or Holiday Inn. I agree with BD, DON'T eat at the International Skillet! If you want a great place to have dinner, then go to the Spot Firehouse , it's just down the street from the Super 8. Barney's is a lot like Perkins, good bfast-dinner. Just $0.02.Guide"
512321,Guest,2001-05-09 13:41:00,0,We stay stay at the Holiday Inn in Internatioal Falls every year nice rooms and staff
512322,Guest,2001-05-10 18:55:00,0,We're planning to arrive in International Falls around 11:30pm and be gone by 7am in June. We've tentatively made a reservation at the Budget Host Inn. Any feedback? We're just looking for a clean bed to catch a few hours of sleep and you can't beat the price.Anyone know a good cigar place in Fort Frances or Dryden?
