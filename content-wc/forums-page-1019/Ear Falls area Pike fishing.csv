512828,Rocky,2001-05-29 05:52:00,5,I am traveling to the Ear Falls area the first week of June. Was wondering if anyone would have some information on lakes with a boat landing in the area that would offer good Northern Pike fishing The lake we are at doesn't offer the best Pike fishing and we would love to catch some. We are looking for either size or numbers of fish it doesn' really matter to us.
