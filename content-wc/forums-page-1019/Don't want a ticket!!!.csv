512738,"Buck - Cadott, WI",2001-05-23 14:51:00,6,"Can anyone help me out with what is required in a boat to be legal in Ontario? I have heard that a person needs a noisemaker, floating flashlight, a throwable float with rope and other things. I am from Wisconsin are the regs the same for residents and non-residents? The boats are 14 footers with 15 horse motors. If anyone could help me out it would be great; I hate to wreck an awesome trip with fine.Thank you,Tim Blanchette[email protected]"
512739,Guest,2001-05-23 16:19:00,0,"1. PFD for each person in boat. If boat is US registered it can be US Coast Guard approved otherwise it must be Canadian Coast Guard approved? What the difference is I really don't know?? Shoot we probally taught em all they know! Just joking..!!2. Sound producing device (waterproof wistle or air horn)3. Floating rope (either 75' or 100' can't remember)4. Bailing device like a bucket or bilge pump. Water ""mountie""wouldn't accept the bilge but did have a pee container to make him happy! Wonder why that was... got 2 pumps each hooked on different batteries?5. Floating seat cushion ya can chunk to MOB6. Fishing permits for each person in the boat.7. No alcohol (drinking type!) in boat.8.

512740,Guest,2001-05-24 04:43:00,0,Thanks for the rundown Mp3553. I've also heard Ontario requires 2 oars or paddles in all boats. Is that true?
512741,Guest,2001-05-24 16:29:00,0,Got 1 paddle in boat. Water mountie never asked for that!Like it would do any good... 2' paddle in a 17' boat that weighs close to 2000 lb!
512743,Guest,2001-05-24 17:26:00,0,I wish they could make sure some common sense was a requirement as well. There was just three drownings south of Armstrong. They were out in windy weather in a 12ft boat. Four in the boat........one made it. He was a kid who watched his mother and brother drown. They held on to the boat for a while but the cold water overcame them. One life jacket between them. This happens pretty much every year. Hard to comprehend.
512745,Guest,2001-05-24 17:34:00,0,"Canadian Boating laws state (from Canadian Coast guard site): ""Once in Canadian waters, you must follow the rules that govern the safe operation of your vessel and protection of the environment. If your boat is registered or licensed outside Canada, then it must be fitted with the safety equipment required by your country while in Canadian waters. Boating restriction laws such as local speed and operating restrictions apply to all boats"" Note the statement: If your boat is registered or licensed outside Canada, then it must be fitted with the safety equipment required by your country while in Canadian waters.
