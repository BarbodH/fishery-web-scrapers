I'm not a guide or anything, but tournament fishing has taught me a lot. Some lakes around here it's nothing to catch 50 walleye in an afternoon. (Most lakes are catch and release)HrudeyAB"

512658,Guest,2001-05-29 16:58:00,0,Moose tournament is September 15/16 I believe. It will be a four fish per day tournament. It should prove to be an interesting tournament this late in the year.
