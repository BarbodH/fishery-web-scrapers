We're looking for a Resort fairly close to the main lake and has some cabins set up with 2 beds. I've done some looking around and most places are geared up for husband-wife combos or filling a cabin with friends. We want the lodging bill to stay under $1000 for the week. Any ideas or past experiences would be great."
