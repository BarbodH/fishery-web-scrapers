Then, we use one of the coleman coolers that you plug into your vehicles power outlet. I think I paid about 80 dollars for the cooler and have been extremely happy with that method. No ice, no mess. Make sure that you put the plug in the right way as these chests can heat or cool depending on how you plug it in. We use crawlers on a jig, so I doubt that the spinner is the attractant. I've seen them outfish minnows, powerbait, gulp and twisters once in a while. Not always, but I want to be prepared so I don't think leaving them at home is always a good choice."
556717,nitroman,2006-04-29 22:58:00,368,"I take everything i got along including live crawlers and all types of plastics just to keep my options open. I've had days where the plastics worked just as good as the real stuff but I also have days where the real thing seems to be preferred. I read the Lunkers Love Nightcrawlers book and started to employ that method when we are jigging and absolutly outfished everyone. If they are taking crawlers that system works for me hands down, had many days where the crawler never had a chance to touch the bottom before it was swallowed up, catching fish after fish for a couple hours straight is a real kick in the pants. So I will continue to take live crawlers with me cause they work for me. Thanks for all the input guys Nitroman"
556719,Guest,2006-04-30 02:34:00,0,"Walleyes can't resist the appeal of a fat, juicy worm trailing behind a spinner. And, for those days that the eyes prefer a jig to a spinner, nothing can beat live bait on a jig where I fish. Tried plastics there many a time when out of minnows or worms and they just don't work as well as the real thing."
556619,nitroman,2006-04-26 22:33:00,368,"I was just wondering how everyone packs their crawlers for the trip. I brought a flat last year in a styrofoam container with some ice packs in the back of my pickup undermy hard shell and when we got there they were awfully warm and and wet due to the ice packs sweating into the buss bedding and they were not to lively. And how do you guys store them once you get there, we kept the container in the cabin and iced down to stay cool but not cold but i think the trip took most of the life out of them."
556620,phaffy12,2006-04-27 02:08:00,9,"We usually put them in a metal, chest type, Coleman cooler which helps keep the ice cool. It also keeps the varmints (coons and skunks), out of the coolers at night in camp. Also, we freeze empty water bottles to keep them cool, but we only stop for one night on the way up. If you have a longer trip than that, maybe this won't work for you..."
556622,phishfearme,2006-04-27 07:41:00,1242,"nitro - we've found that those styrofoam coolers work very well IF you duct tape the seam all the way around. this should keep ""new"" moisture out and the sweating should only be from water within. we also change out the blue ice packs every day or so to be safe. they're a pain but sometimes save a trip! - phish"
556623,Guest,2006-04-27 07:57:00,0,"On a trip to Lac Seul four years ago, I used an old coleman cooler as suggested above for my worms and I did not poke AIRHOLES in the cooler. By the time I got up north, most of the worms were dead and the smell when I opened the cooler was awful. I went out and bought a Frabill Worm Habitat and it has worked fine for a few years now. It was about $15 and it fits 500 worms no problem."
556625,Guest,2006-04-27 08:18:00,0,"Off topic, do you guys know if the worms are effective around mid June?"
556627,nitroman,2006-04-27 08:46:00,368,from the house to the camp is a 15 hr trip so i think i will look into the worm habitat thanks for the quick responses. As for the crawlers in june I would say yes they work we go the first week of june (36 days an counting) and I have always had good luck with crawlers. I caught my biggest eye' to date last year in the crappiest weather drifting a white jig tipped with a crawler last year.
556653,Lovetofish,2006-04-27 14:41:00,458,I use a box worm farm and duct tape it so the lid stays on. Don't cover the vents completely. I set this on top of my salted minnows in zip locks in a chest cooler with a gallon of frozen drinking water on one side. This keeps the worms off the bottom (in case of a leak). Cover all with a large towel and keep the cooler shut until you need the bait. We get to camp about 30 hours later and maybe half the gallon has thawed. The next morning I'll replace it with another frozen gallon (I bring 4 total and refreeze 3 when we get to camp) and use the thawed for coffee or whatever each day. No mess and the bait is kept cool by itself and out of the way. I refill and freeze the jugs with lake water the last day for the coolers on the way home.

556703,Guest,2006-04-29 09:57:00,0,"Guys I have told at least 15,879 times!!!!!!! You do not need to take crawlers into Canada for walleyes. Walleyes DO NOT hit the crawlers because you are using live bait. THEY HIT THEM BECAUSE OF THE SPINNER. IF you don't understand please reread until you do!!!!!! I have kicked the dog stuffings and collected MANY $$$$$$$ out of EVERY person who ever said they could outfish me using real crawlers VS. me using the same crawler harness while using Berkley POWER BAIT or similar artificial crawlers. I haven't taken REAL crawlers in Canada since I fished with Lewis & Clark on their trip out WEST. When you talk of taking REAL crawlers into Canada, you show you lack of walleye fishing knowledge when you take MESSY real crawlers. I don't allow them is MY boat."
