Water is normal for this time of year and rising slowly; we are in dire need of rain, bush is really dry, rain in forcast later this week, will help with fire hazard as well as lake level. Got 5 cabins open and 8 boats in and ready to go!"
556767,Guest,2006-05-01 18:13:00,0,Does the early ice out mean the fish will be heading deeper earlier or is it too early to tell? Just curious as we'll be up the second week of June and want to be prepared to fish deep if need be. Thanks!
