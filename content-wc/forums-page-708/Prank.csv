We have a dude in our group that is real secretive about going to the outhouse, same guy that will get a poster size blow-up of one of us when he whips the door open on the crapper and hits you with a say cheese and snaps the pic...well, little does he know, we have a poster size blow-up of him from last year that we are handing out when we get to I-falls of a remote pic taken with a motion camera last year of him grunting for all he is worth while he's sneakin' a trip to the outhouse. He may never use the outhouse while in camp this year... That is all... Rob"
556729,Guest,2006-04-30 10:58:00,0,"The best one I remember was while ""Fat Eddie"" was in the bathroom doing his morning thing. We filled 2 big juice glasses with ice tea and one with Crown Royal. When Fat Eddie came out we told him we were going to have a little eye opener before we went fishing. We slugged down our tea and Fat Eddie with jerks and twitches slugged down the Crown. He didn't catch on until the 3rd morning when we poured the tea to soon and the glasses sweat and his didn't. From then on we all had a shot of Crown and laughed at the FATMAN. Good luck fishing everyone and save your pennies for gas!"
556731,spurs101,2006-04-30 12:23:00,635,"One of the best I ever saw being pulled off was ""Casino Night"". The entire camp - 40 plus guys - played along with it and it was priceless. Now -we're in the middle of nowhere - on a fly in, on an island, and remote as you can get. One group had a FNG and was told that mid-week (Wed) was ""Casino Night"" at the camp. Gambling, gals, and all the imbibing you wish to do. ""Nobody fishes that night because this is ritual"" One caveate was that you needed to shave, shower, and where your best clothes you've got. Even the camp owner and his wife where in on this. Everytime the FNG would ask anyone on the island - everyone was dead serious about - yup- looking forward to it with a straight face. You guessed it - after supper the guy shows up clean, showered , shaven , in a white shirt and sweater asking everone when the plane comes in the gals. Now - this lasted for about 10 minutes outside the lodge when twenty plus guys couldn't hold on any longer - you talk about laughter - we were all in tears. The guy realized he'd been had big time and in due time even got over the embarressment. I've never seen anybody setup so badly than this. Then we all went out walleye fishing. :-)"
556755,Guest,2006-05-01 12:49:00,0,"Well the one that was played on me by my wife was, a pair of hot sexy pink panties (dam* nice ones too) in the top of my tackle box. I pulled them out and was not real sure what they were at frist. But when I knew what they were ""I said who in the hel* are these"" my father inlaw said you had better hope they belong to your wife. So brother inlaws, outlaws,father inlaw, everyone had a big laugh on me. And yes I did find out they were hers."
556759,dave10,2006-05-01 15:20:00,342,"Spurs - your story reminded me of another good prank, again played on me (hmmm . . .) My sons and I met up with our group of twenty guys to ice fish Big Winnie in Minnesota last March. We were supposed to stay at a nearby lodge owned by the bar and restaurant where we met our group. When we got to the bar late that night, we were told there had been a change of ownership and a booking mix-up at the lodge, and we would be sleeping in an unheated barn outside of town instead. 10 degrees outside, no running water or electricity in the barn, cots with no blankets, etc. They kept pouring it on as the night progressed. They even got the waitress in on it, with her telling me that the new owners were really cheap and I could ""rent"" a blanket for me and the boys at $5.00 per. I got more and more depressed, but the clincher was when I decided that without electricity, I better take out my contacts and plug in my heat disinfection unit while I was at the bar. The waitress came over and told me there'd be a surcharge of 5 bucks for the electricity usage in the bar. Thankfully, I held my tongue and my temper. When we drove out to the ""barn"" a half hour later, I saw the deluxe cottages we were staying in. Funny thing - as we pulled up, I could see lights in the cottage windows, and kept saying to myself ""I thought there was no power out here..."" Everyone had a good laugh, and I tried my best to be gracious."
556666,dave10,2006-04-27 17:07:00,342,"Best one I recall, pulled on me and a friend, occurred when we were muskie fishing and stopped for lunch at a resort on the lake we were fishing. Our ""partners"" in the other boat walked over to ours after we walked away, and tightened down the spools on our muskie reels absolutely tight. The first cast after lunch almost had each of us over the side with the heavy jerkbaits we were throwing. In retrospect, maybe not such a funny prank. . . :) Dave"
556671,Guest,2006-04-27 17:57:00,0,"Of course, a standard prank is to do the opposite of what Dave just suggested, which is really speeding up the spool speed on somebody's baitcaster, giving them a monster bird's nest on their first cast (some fools will pick away at the mess and cast again doing the same thing three of four times before they clue in). NWO Fishing Bum"
556674,FlyBoy,2006-04-27 20:28:00,631,"Its funny this was brought up, I was just searching the web the other night for ideas for our week long house boat trip. The best one we've pulled off so far was to cut the line on all the poles in the boat right in front of the spool, then try to get the line stuck to something so the bait doesn't just fall off the rod. The problem was, when the guys noticed and stopped to fix it, they left their bow mount trolling motor down when they took back off, and promptly removed their trolling motor! Newest one for this coming year is anbesol on the rim of a buddies beer can. Watch his lips get thick! Keep the ideas coming, I need some good ones! -John"
556676,tly,2006-04-27 20:29:00,1900,Cutting top off of plastic milk carton and using as pee bottle. Then midway in day some clever guy taking knife & poking holes in the bottom & sides. A regular fountain for the next user!!! --or--- same person with knife got over served at camp. He took a power nap on a chaise lounge which would up along side hwy 17 along with a sign advertising his guiding prowess Stan is a class act
556680,Guest,2006-04-28 09:25:00,0,"A good one is to strip off about 20 feet of line or so and cut it then carefully wind it back on. The first time they cast, the lure will just keep on going. Just make sure it's a floating lure so you can get it back."
556681,Guest,2006-04-28 10:18:00,0,"I took my Uncle's 7 inch Rapala out of the plastic box and replaced it with a large alewife in his tackle box. After 3 days he said ""what in the &^** stinks in this boat,"" followed by ""who's the #$$%^&* who stuffed a @##%^& alewife in my box?"""
556685,Guest,2006-04-28 12:45:00,0,"this didnt happen in our group but another group in our camp. 5 old guys in a 17"" lund and somehow one of them tied(or hooked) some guys line on the boat and would give it a tug every now and then and the guy would set the hook and think he had one yet there was nothing there. watching this for over an hour was pretty entertaining."
556688,Guest,2006-04-28 15:55:00,0,"This isn't so much a prank ,but still funny So many guys say they will not eat pike. ""They don't like them"". In spring time when the water is cold I would always slip a few pike with the walleye into the batter and leave the ""Y"" bone in. EVERY single time all I would here nothing beats walleye untill the ""Y"" bone would pop out."
556690,FuzzyIL,2006-04-28 17:10:00,906,"Ontario Fly-In. The FNG was a little cocky to me. We came back to camp mid-afternoon one hot day. The FNG went to the cabin as it was his housekeeping day. I had to use the facilities. The other 4 guys were on the dock gassing up or on the beach wading. I sneak up to the cabin while FNG is sweeping and hide were no window has access. Then I brush up and push against the cabin real hard and start to huff and grunt like a bear. He drops the broom and doesn't move. I move a few yards and repeat. I mean I did a great job on the bear sounds. His pants are filling up. He is banging pots, yelling, you can hear the terror in his voice. This goes on for 10 mins and now the crew is coming up the trail from the beach. I peel off and head down the trial to join them so we all appear to be arriving together. The FNG opens the door, his face is white and tissue, 'hey fellas- there's a friggin bear behind here get the heck outta here' - I burst out laughing."
556691,Smeds,2006-04-28 19:01:00,103,"""The pee-puck"" ... best applied during the hard-water period. Past ice-fishing trip had two new guys sharing a bedroom. The door to their bedroom had about a 2-3"" gap at the bottom. (Someone) Took a whiz in a dixie cup, and let freeze during the day's fishing. Eventually the new guys had too much fun, we waited an appropriate amount of time, removed dixie cup wrapper, and slid ""puck"" under the door. The cussin'and accusations coming out of that room in the middle of the night were priceless! Not often do I come out of a dead sleep LMAO, but we knew right away what the fuss was about!"
556624,Guest,2006-04-27 08:00:00,0,"What are the best pranks you ever pulled on a fishing trip? We are usually low-tech with our pranks and it is usually something like a fish head on a pillow, or stinkbait opened under a bed, or a worm in a bloody mary..."
556637,Guest,2006-04-27 10:51:00,0,How about somebody's Ex-wife in big duffle bag. That is a real show stopper especially after the plane drops you off and won't be back for 7 days.
556641,Reels,2006-04-27 12:11:00,2876,My favorite was getting my brother all freaked out about tics durring shore lunch. We were having lunch and we found a few tics on us and he was absolutely spooked. I tossed a hand full of coffee grounds in his sheets. When he woke up he thought he had tics all over his body! Priceless. Then there was a turtle in someones pillow case. Thats was a good one. Icyhot in the underwear.... Making sandwiches and leaving the plastic on the cheese.... Putting a fish in the car at the beginning of the week.... <{{}}><
556645,Guest,2006-04-27 12:41:00,0,"We did a turtle in the bathtub, but never in a pillow. Best prank ever was when a guy found a bra in a dresser drawer that someone from a week before left behind. He took the bra and hid it at the end of the week in another guys dirty clothes. The guys wife found it. We still laugh about it. He does not. Catfish Powerbait under car seat or in pillowcase is a great scam."
556647,Stu,2006-04-27 13:04:00,472,"Last year one of the kids in our group was saving walleye eyes for perch bait. The only problem was that he put them in a beer bottle, replaced the cap and put them in the fridge. You can guess how this ended."
