556146,Lovetofish,2006-04-11 15:17:00,458,Dr. Lee. What was the cost to stay at Austin's?
556148,Guest,2006-04-11 16:01:00,0,"Sorry John, I was actually working and didn't see this post. I agree with what John said. I've been going to Allanwater for 5 years now and our group has gone about 15. John and Barney have done a lot of work on the place in the last 3 years. They are attentive to your needs and do a pretty good job. Most guys will help you get started on where to go and John and Barney will as well. As stated earlier, there is a lot of structure. It is not crowded either. Tons of fun and only 9-1/2 weeks left to go (but who's counting). StEhle"

556203,Guest,2006-04-13 13:05:00,0,do you have a contact number for austins?
556249,Fishoil,2006-04-16 21:54:00,1277,"I've been going to Pashkokogan for the opener for about 10 years now. Dr. Lee summed up the fishing pretty well. It's a great spot for numbers of decent sized walleyes, but if you're looking for a trophy you'll do better elsewhere. Northerns are usually plentiful, you'll catch plenty with a jig fishing for walleyes. We've always stayed at North Albany Lodge, so I don't have any first-hand experience with Austin's. But I've heard they run a good camp, as do the folks at North Albany."
556294,Brown,2006-04-18 08:35:00,4,"Here is the number to Austin's (317) 597-1514. Bob and Annette run a nice camp and have put alot of work into it over the years. The cabins are well kept and clean. My family and friends went there for 6 years. There are some nice fish in the lake. One friend caught a 20# northern and my best was around 13#. I have also been broke off a few times. Walleye's are nice size, and one can catch more than you can eat. I think the biggest walleye we caught was around 6#. Its a nice lake, lots of places to explore. One doesn't have to go far from camp to catch fish. There are nice weeds beds and lots of humps and points to fish close to camp. Everyone develops their own style of fishing, we longline number 13 floating rapala's while trolling forward. We were looking for northern's and caught alot of nice walleye in the process. It's a nice place, I have alot of fond memories from there."
556364,Guest,2006-04-20 16:03:00,0,thanks for all the info. maybe i will see some of you up there.
556756,Guest,2006-05-01 14:25:00,0,tried call the number given to austins but was out of order. any other numbers to contact them?

556041,Guest,2006-04-09 17:35:00,0,"Was wondering if anyone has been to austins lodge on pashkokogan(?)or to allenwater bridge lodge where you go in by train. Any info on fishing(walleye), accomodations and hospitality would be greatly appreciated. thanks."

556045,LeeHawk,2006-04-09 20:49:00,12,"I have fished Pashkokogan on three occasions. I have stayed at Austins and would highly recommend them to you. Very nice people, nice clean cabins, good lake location, and they will help you locate fish. As to the lake, I have had faster fishing in June, but even in the midst of a heat wave in July last summer, we had slow periods and fast periods...up to 100+ fish on two or three of the days, then slower on a couple of days. There were four of us in two boats. We were fishing with virtually no wind, 90's F. so it was tough. The lake is generally rather shallow, but has areas with current so the water stays cool and the walleyes are not down deep even in warm weather. In June, we catch them on windswept points and shorelines in 2-4' of water on a jig and minnow (live or salted doesn't seem to matter). If you are fishing later in the summmer, ask the owner where to find some current, or work deeper (15-22') off points and islands. Don't stay too long in one spot...you are wasting your time if you don't have some fish in the first 15-20 minutes. Also, there are many narrow areas where you can get out of the wind if you need to. I have seen a number of boats anchored and jigging while having very good success...again near current. Northern pike are available in predictable spots and of course move off deeper points in hot weather. Quite numerous, but not necessarily large. Have caught a couple over 35"" and one about 42"". Bigger ones seem to come when fishing jig/minnow for walleyes. Small coves with wind blowing in seem to trap bait fish and at times hold incredible numbers of walleyes. Look for them. Size of walleyes is really nice...many 16-20"" with some 24"", though not frequent. They are very healthy and seem especially tasty after a couple of cocktails. Go figure. I have fished numerous lakes in northern Ontario, including fly-ins to some of the best lakes available and P. is the best drive-in I have experienced. Sorry for the long post but I am getting spring fever and have three weeks in Ontario planned for this summer. Dr. Lee"

556053,JohnAB,2006-04-10 09:37:00,49,"I have fished Kawaweogama Lake (Allanwater Bridge Lodge) the past two summers as the wife's family owns the cabin on Star Island. Barney and John Jelinski own and operate the lodge. Very nice people. Lodge cabins are more rustic but serve their purpose very well. All the amenities there (power, showers, flush toilets etc). Boats are Lunds with 15 horse fourstroke Honda's. Fishing on the lake is fanatastic. Tons of structure. Do a search on this website for Kawaweogama Lake and you will get a few posts returned with lots of info on the lake and lodge."
