We fish Lac Seul out of resort boats, and there are days where it sure would be nice to have some for backtrolling. Anyone ever modify anything so you can take them off at the end of the week? Tried searching the archives ... came up with nothing."
556505,Blackmacs,2006-04-25 13:36:00,2121,I don't think it would take much for someone to make a portable pair. Many of the smaller boats resorts use have straight transoms. I think they could use a straight aluminum channel with clamps attached similar to the ones used on transom mount electric motors. One on each end should be good. The plexi part of the slash guard could be a standard length and then add enough rubber to make them a universal fit. I doubt there would be a big market for them but who knows. I may have just gave someone a million dollar idea. If so remember where you heard it first. :)

Will make changes to them and try again this year.https://www.walleyecentral.com/photop...php?photo=3058 Be sure to read the comments with the above photo. Biggest change will be to use a square mud-flap and trim it to fit the boat once we are in camp. I tried looking at photos from past trips and judging the angles of the camp boats. Since the clamp sets about an inch above the transom, a lot more water came under the splash guards than I expected. That needs to be addressed. Rubber should also be higher (taller?). Like I said, make them a little larger than you need then trim them once in camp. I'd like to find a lighter but still (a little bit) flexible material instead of the mudflaps. Sooner or later I'll run across something that can be used instead of the rubber. I've looked at several different plastics and some are close but not quite what is needed. Let me know if you have any ideas. As you can see, they are a work in progress. Pooch"
