If anything, they'll have a chance to fatten up a little before we dip em in bread crumbs. mmmmmm How many more days before opening weekend? Mista W"

556514,Guest,2006-04-25 16:14:00,0,"Yep, It's quite early for this time of year. Feels warmer then some of the summers we've had in the past. I was checking my dock this morning and there's a couple of boats out there already... I heard a couple of the locals jumped in the lake last weekend...Red Lake's polar bear swim I guess.. We've had snow in mid May and Ice for the May long weekend. Yep this is early and I'm loving it."
