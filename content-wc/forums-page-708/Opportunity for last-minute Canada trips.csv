Typical spring resort bookings don't tend to get really busy until beginning of June, mainly because the really good spring fishing doesn't happen until the water warms up a bit. This year, the good walleye fishing should be starting earlier, possibly by the opener. Is anybody taking advantage of the fact that there will be many openings during prime fishing, simply because prime fishing will be earlier this year?"
