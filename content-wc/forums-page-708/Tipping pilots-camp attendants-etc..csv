When I fish lake of the woods it's on the west side . Plus we were trying to remember the name of the black lab that would kick your beer over . Drank to many myself to remember"
556667,Guest,2006-04-27 17:15:00,0,"As a dockhand I bet my tips was equaled by the amount of booze that was left for us. Just about had to go to rehab before school started. If the dockhad is justing putting his time in it should reflect in his tip. The guy who wouldn't clean the perch shouldn't piss all for a tip. He should of cleaned it and shown you the problem . As for the perch . They are wormy , some worse then others . But in smaller walleyes you'll see they have the same worms. The worms are easly picked out if your keeping perch. Next time you catch a perch look at its skin real close and a lot of time you can see them just under the skin"
556670,Guest,2006-04-27 17:57:00,0,"brian d, the perch everyone else kept looked good.not to keep harping on that subject. are they always wormy, i recall cleaning some myself and were as clean as walleye. we leave beers for the guys as well as cans if there are any left!)we also party with the guys as well. hey, unfortunately i know a good place for rehab...what camp did you work at?? jig out"
556682,Guest,2006-04-28 11:46:00,0,"All those lakes in that area have those worms. From my experience's it make a difference on where those fish were caught . Again this is only what I think. The warmer the water they come from the worse they seem to be. The fish that came out of deeper water ( bigger fish ) don't have near as many worms. Not that I keep perch but everytime I catch one you can see them under their skin. I worked at Witch bay, back in the mid 80's."
556683,Guest,2006-04-28 12:12:00,0,brian d we will be fishing snake bay lotw 6-3 thru 6-10.never fished lotw b-4. how is that area? any areas nearby we should try?? how bout crappie and lakers that time of year?? any pointers or tips would be helpful. staying at white pine lodge for the week and at crystal harbour the friday night before.. 5 weeks from today!!!! jig out
556684,eyedoktr,2006-04-28 12:22:00,2426,"WOW! Reading these posts I am very surprised at the level you all feel is correct to tip. The ""low"" level. I would think that $10/person/day would be good , not $10/person/week. As far as the pilot goes, it depends on how many are in the group. The minimum I would tip would be $50 total (each way) and if there were 4 or more, $100 wouldn't be too much. No, I am by no means rich but I will reward someone for providing good service to me. heck, if I get $15 in pizza delivered to the house, I give them a twenty."
556686,jigman 2003,2006-04-28 14:19:00,981,"Wow, so a group of five would give the camp attendant a total of $350 a week for filling up gas tanks and telling you where to fish? You are a generous person, sir. I could see that much if he were cleaning, packaging and freezing my fish, cooking a shore lunch and doing the other things, but even then that seems a bit much. Guess I'm cheap. I can see tipping the pilot $50 for a round trip, but $50 each way seems high. Let's hear some thoughts on this guys."
556687,Guest,2006-04-28 14:38:00,0,i agree with you jigman. we tip 60$ leave our deposit cans and supply beers throughout the week for our dockand.this is for a party of three. more than generous we believe. (i could be retired if i returned all of our blue cans... or pretty close!) jig
556715,Wisconeye,2006-04-29 22:50:00,79,"Hey Jigman, we tipped about like you, to the same guy. There were eight of us and we all pitched in for $120, plus he joined us for beer almost each night. Two of our group were kids so it amounted to about $20 per adult The year before we left him a plano box of leadheads (about 225), all sizes and colors after seeing what he had to fish with and in the box we put $80 as well. The second year he was extremely helpful so I don't think he was disappointed from the year before. We tipped each pilot $10 per person, both ways. Again for the adults only. So total pilot tips were about $120. All in all, 8 fishermen @ $1000 each = $8000, tips equaled $240 so that's just about 3% overall. I think it's important to recognize the $8000 as a big chunk, not like it's an $8000 pizza! I guess after looking at it, the pilots did better than the attendant which is probably not right since the attendant was a great guy. For everyone elses information the camp attendant gassed up boats, picked up garbage from our cabin and called in for more minnnows, food, beer, etc. He would also tell us about spots on a map, but did not guide."
556732,Guest,2006-04-30 13:35:00,0,Brian D; I worked at Witch Bay for the summers of 83 & 84. Have you been back since?
556739,jigman 2003,2006-05-01 07:21:00,981,"Hey Wisconeye, where you going this year? I remember you were looking for a lake with smallies weren't you? Did you tip the pilots when you were climbing in or after you landed? I'm just curious how to do it. I've never seen anyone tipping them, so I don't know what the ""etiquette"" is. We just got back from Jamaica. There, you are expected to tip EVERYONE. We tipped after we would get out of a taxi, or after a service was performed. I expect that would be the norm elsewhere."
556561,Guest,2006-04-26 15:34:00,0,"When I get a guide I like to pay at the end of the first day, rather than in a lump sum at the end of the trip. This way on the first day the guide will see we do tip well, and the good spots on the lake can keep coming out."

556567,phishfearme,2006-04-26 20:41:00,1242,i agree with jerry - leave the returnable cans for the deck hands in addition to whatever tip you deem necessary. - phish

556649,Guest,2006-04-27 13:25:00,0,"My first 2 years that I worked as a camp hand, that offered no guides at least at the time on Lake Of The Woods. I was up with the sun making sure all the boats were ready to go ,I pointed the guests in the right direction. When time allowed I would go on my time for those who couldn't get on the fish and helped out. Plus on my own I would do a once a week big fish fry that was not expected out of me, and at night I was always invited to hang out with the groups of guests. I loved my job, and because I put a lot into it, it showed in the tips I received. Plus made a lot of new friends who I went fishing with years after I finished school. Keeping in mind I was a student and depended a lot on the tips made that summer. But it all boiled down to the same as going out to dinner. You get bad service small to no tip . If you had good service good tip."
556651,Guest,2006-04-27 14:19:00,0,"As one who worked strictly for tips (in younger days)... Plant the seed early. Give him money on the way in ....like, when you get to the camp...he will remember you much better. :)"
556656,Guest,2006-04-27 14:54:00,0,"jigman, if you want to hand out 50$ bills, we play tex holdem each night. lotw 6-3 thru 6-10... just kidding. we usually tip the dock hands 15-20 per man, but they are also cleaning our fish for us and are doing a real good job. didnt tip the dock hands that wouldn't clean the nice bonus perch on eagle becuase they told us they were wormy.(found out not the case)"
556658,jigman 2003,2006-04-27 15:01:00,981,"If I were to play hold 'em with you guys I'd just have more $50's to use for tips. Canadian perch can be wormy. We used to fish a lake with cached boats way back in the bush. We'd catch 13""-15"" perch with regularity. One year we kept some to eat (should have kept a couple for the wall), about 50% of them were FULL of white grubs that looked like wax worms. We felt bad for killing these huge perch and throwing them away. Haven't kept anymore since then, if I ever caught some small ones I might try again."
556660,Guest,2006-04-27 15:10:00,0,"jigman, we found out from the owner that the perch were fine (he wasnt real happy with his guys). only if im tippin a few you might get lucky at cards..lol phil hellmuth"
556665,Guest,2006-04-27 15:55:00,0,We tip about $15.00/ guy for the dock hands that also clean our fish. We tip the pilot $20.00 total each way. We tip our cook for the week $25/ guy. She is the only cook in camp for all of us. How do these figures sound? I am always worried that we are not tipping enough. fish24/7
556545,phern,2006-04-26 11:20:00,151,"Either currency. Yes, it's a good idea to give a tip to camp attendants. Most of their salary is with the tips they make. Many guides I know, don't even have a salary. Some are good guides, some are there just for a free day of fishing and some are very inexperienced fishermen. If the guide does any fishing....it's often because he is not paid...lol. The guide is there to carry your stuff, pack the boat for the outing, put you on fish and maybe show some techniques to less experienced fishermen, net the fish, unhook the fish, pass the beer, etc etc. If he is fishing, he has no time to take care of the customers. You can always ask the camp manager if the guides are paid or not."

Other than that, he takes care of the grounds. Weed whacking, checking on the generator, etc. We gave him $50 for a group of 5 last year. Was that too low?"

556551,Guest,2006-04-26 13:51:00,0,Yep the same sticker was in an L&M Outpost plane also. But when a family (of 4 or 5) spends all the money on the trip for a week it is hard to shell out more money for a tip at the end. I know it would have for me.

556560,grt1,2006-04-26 15:21:00,259,"In response to the person who wrote that if the guide is fishing, he isn't taking care of his customers. I don't agree with that wholeheartedly, but you must remember, the guide has to put his customers on the fish. I have had many who don't know how to fish wallleye and I have to show the technique to them. Therefore, I'm fishing. I have to find the fish and the depth and in order to do that I have to fish. Certainly at the camp I guide at we do a group shore lunch where some guides do the cooking and others do the fish cleaning. We all pitch in to ensure the customer enjoys the meal and his off the water lunch break. We net the fish, we clean the fish and we pass the refreshments when we are requested to do so. And we still fish. Guides are like most people, they have to enjoy working at what they do and most of the guides I know, can fish and work at the same time."
