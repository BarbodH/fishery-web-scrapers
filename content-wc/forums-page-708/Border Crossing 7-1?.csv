556090,Guest,2006-04-08 13:44:00,0,"At this time all you need is a picture ID, and copy of your birth certificate. Sometime in the future yet to be determined you may need a passport. I cross the border 3 to 4 times a year fishing or hunting so don't let anyone throw the ""you have to have a passport line"" at you. I have yet to have to show a birthcertificate or passport at the border. Usually just my drivers license. That being said I do have a passport and have carried it with me for the last 3 years when crossing, along with proof of insurance on the vehicle and the boat. I have never been asked to show any of this identification in the last 20 years, even during 9/11. Good luck and have fun, just remember you are in a different country and not the 51st state... GF"

The actual crossing the border experience is about the same everywhere, but the tenseness is much less at Baudette due to it simply is not as busy and hectic. Have a great trip. We are coming back when you are going up."
556644,hammer_gold_spinner,2006-04-27 12:41:00,151,"As has been said, have a picture I.D. and a birth cert along just in case. Traveling with a child and no wife along or a child who is not yours have a note from the kids mother or thier parents saying its ok to be traveling with you. If you have had prior DWI convictions or other felony convictions contact the Canada immigration office to get a special ok. Process may cost $250 or more. DO NOT try to get thru with out it. No firearms or ammunition. Fireworks are also a no-no. Mac"
556679,Guest,2006-04-28 07:01:00,0,"You shouldn't have any problem. We will be heading to Eagle for our 7th visit the following week and it is never really bad. We cross at International Falls. A trick that we have done for years now, is to have everyones D.L., SSN card or passport in the drivers hands before he pulls up to the booth. We also write down anything we wish to declare, so that there is no confusion when crossing. We have always found the crossing people to be friendly and business like. Have a great time on Eagle. As a side note........my brother-in-laws favorite lure up there is a #3 Mepps Black Fury. If all of you guys throw this lure, the pike should get used to it and I may finally win the big fish contest for the week! LOL"
554680,SteveV,2006-02-16 21:29:00,39,We are tentatively scheduled to go to Eagle Lake from Minnesota the week of June 24th thru July 1st this summer. So we would be crossing the border in Baudette back into the US on July 1st. Bad idea? I was thinking that there might be tremendous traffic going out of the US entering Canada. Anyone have any idea if it is bad that same weekend going the other direction? Thanks SteveV
554690,MoWalleyeguy,2006-02-17 09:51:00,409,You shouldnt have any trouble since your going through Baudette. Thats normally not quite as busy as the Fort Frances/International falls crossing. I will be going through at International falls on July 2nd and coming back the follwing Saturday and this will be my 5th year on that weekend. Never much trouble. My longest wait was last year coming back and it was maybe 30 minutes. (got there around 9:30am) It often depends on what time of day your driving through... but like I said Baudette shouldnt be much at all.
554693,Crappie Kid,2006-02-17 11:41:00,1581,I am glad you brought this up because we are crossing July 1st into Canada (Eagle Lake). How busy do those crossings get?
554697,Guest,2006-02-17 12:45:00,0,We've crossed at Baudette the last couple of years and there has been little traffic either time. Last year coming back to US on a Sat. am there were less than 5 vehicles there.
554701,Guest,2006-02-17 15:03:00,0,"Here's a website you can use to monitor crossing times at the larger points. It is pretty good, and you can definatley see the patterns develop when things get into summertime crossings. I start monitoring flow about month before we go across (last week of june). international falls is definately a lot busier than rainy river.http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/general/times/menu-e.html Chuck"

555342,jimmie,2006-03-12 15:19:00,123,usually there is little delay at the falls either if you are early in the am. Howwever be aware of special events.
