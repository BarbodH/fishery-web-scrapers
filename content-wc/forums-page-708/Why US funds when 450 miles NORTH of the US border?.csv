556628,Guest,2006-04-27 09:12:00,0,"I'm not. That's what I was trying to say. The lodge we go to charges in Canadian dollars. They have raised their rates very little in the ten years I have been going. But, because of the change in the exchange rate. It costs us a lot more."
556632,VMS,2006-04-27 10:04:00,1103,"I understand your argument, but let's go a little deeper. Over those years between 1998 and 2005, the overall inflation rate in Canada was roughly 16.5%. In the united states the overall inflation rate over those same years was 19.9%. This would reflect that prices are not rising as fast in Canada as they are in the united states (and the overall weakening of the US dollar since it does not get as many goods and services as it compares to other countries). So...even though the lodge operator might only charge a 2% increase in rates, he is staying with a yearly inflation rate, but his dollar goes further when he spends it in Canada. interesting how things balance themselves out... It's just one of those odditites of higher rates in US dollar as you mention, but when a different perspective is put on it, things begin to fall into place better in the overall scheme of things.

556764,Guest,2006-05-01 17:45:00,0,If you're in Canada you should be doing business in Canadian dollars. Wonder how they pay their Canadian taxes when they charge out in American cash ....hmmmm
556773,River_eye,2006-05-01 23:01:00,1486,"Although, being a canadian citizen, living all year round in Canada, he has always spent the majority of his profits in Canada, meaning that his revenue increase of 2% is far behind the inflation rate. Which his price increases might be expected to follow even if his services weren't upgraded. On the contrary, his services have been upgraded substantially (30 hp, 16' boats, upgraded to 40 and 60 hp motors on 18' boats, four new buildings, plus expansions to all five cabins) but his revenue increase falls way below the inflation rate. So in reality, the quality of his resort is going up, but the money he's making off it is going down. Sound surprising? That's why there are many lodges for sale right now, it's definately a buyers market. In case you're interested the lodge I speak of is www.eaglenest.mb.ca I guess you can look at it a couple ways. You can see it like I do, and say that he's not doing very well, due to the american dollar, or you could say, he just happened to be making a killing 8 years ago. I don't know his overall revenues, so I can't comment on whether he's rich or not. Either way, I say just be proud that you have a currency that is accepted everywhere."
556775,Guest,2006-05-02 06:41:00,0,"Very simply, even though you are charging in US Dollars, all transactions are ultimately converted to Canadian dollars. If I charge $100 US, and receive $100 US, that $100 is converted to $112 Canadian (or whatever the exchange rate is) based on the day the transaction took place. Even though I list and charge in US, all transactions are converted to Canadian funds. I do the converting to Canadian funds instead of the customer. Would it be easier for me to charge in Canadian, yes. Would it be easier for most of my customers, no (90% + are from the US). So it is a part of doing business for me. There are no tax advantages to charging in US funds. Greg @ Agate Bay Lodge"
556777,jigman 2003,2006-05-02 07:00:00,981,"US inflation was 19.9% from 1998 to 2005? Wow, that's news to me."
556782,Guest,2006-05-02 08:00:00,0,Does that sound out of line? That's a little less than 3% a year.
556803,Guest,2006-05-02 18:30:00,0,I understand the reason why you are doing it. As a local who went to a resort to pick up minnows and was charged in US dollars and then converted to Canadian funds the taxes charged on top was a little distasteful. Worked out to be about $6.50 Can per medium dozen. I guess the owner saw the look on our faces and then proceeded to say that he normally does not sell to non guests at the lodge and was doing us a favour. Public relations with the locals was not this gentlemans thing. The bottom line I guess is that if your guests are happy and it's working then great. The way our dollar is picking up strength (estimates are it will surpass the US dollar in a little over a year) it'll be interesting what the rebate thing will look like when your guests want to pay in Canadian dollars at a US dollar resort.
556807,Guest,2006-05-02 19:47:00,0,"I understand where you are coming with this also. Many places are owned and run by people from the US, and primarily cater to those from the US. I go out of my way to try to make Canadians comfortable, and they get value for their dollar. I don't take advantage of exchange rates, I give them the option of the exchange at the time of booking, or the time of the stay. I agree that the current trend of the dollar will likely swing to the Canadian advantage for a bit. For me so be it. I will continue to charge in US dollars, so the Canadians will be getting top value. That is part of the cost of doing business, and living with fluctuating currencies. I have been know to look the other way when locals stop by for bait, and just charge then the same at the Canadian dollar (5.00 per dz no matter the currency... based on the cost of bait to me). Part of that is just building friendships with the neighbors around me. I could also save a good amount of money by purchasing items in the US, and bringing them up to my lodge. My intention however is to make this business a part of the area, and doing business with the locals in town. Be it boats, motors, building supplies, bait, etc. etc. etc. I want to be part of the community that I am in, not just someone that passes through and leaves nothing behind. But that is my way of doing business. I am sure there are others that will make more money than I do. I am looking to make enough to make ends meet, and improve a few things on a yearly basis. I value my US and Canadian friends on an equal level. Just my perspective... I will now jump off my soapbox. All the best, Greg @ Agate Bay Lodge"

556565,River_eye,2006-04-26 17:26:00,1486,"Well, let's examine this. When I started guiding in 1998, the exchange was about $1.50 can for every $1 US spent. I think a three day, four night trip was about $750 US, converting to about $1125 can. Today his rates are $995 US for that same trip, exchange rate is about $1.15 can for $1.00 US so his rates convert to $1145 can. So.... to him (can. funds he receives), his revenues went up only 2% over 8 years, despite gas costs being about twice what they were then, and they have made extensive upgrades to the lodge and boats and motors. So as you can see, it seems like he's raised his prices 33%, but he really hasn't, it really is the lower US dollar that's hitting you in the pocket book. If he charged in Canadian dollars, and he charged 33% more today than he did in 98, which would make sense, given all the improvements. It would cost you $1523 Can. today. And you would be paying $1325 US today instead of $995. So..... because he charges in US dollars, and the US dollar has been suffering, he just ate $330 US dollars per person. Now, this is just speculation, because if he charged canadian dollars, and raised his rates 33% over 8 years, and you had to pay 77% more american dollars than you did 8 years ago($1325), you would probably say take a hike, even though most of the rate hike would be because of the falling currency. Everybody confused?"

556585,Guest,2006-04-26 08:31:00,0,"Steve, In my case, my rates are set, and based upon US dollars. The reason I do that is 90% of my customers are from the US. It makes things easier for them. With the exchange rate constantly changing I have to set prices at one or the other. I don't forget about my Canadian customers. For them, I give them the option of taking the exchange rate at the time of booking, or the exchange rate at the time of check-in. Customers can pay in either currency. I don't force someone from Canada to get US dollars, and I don't force someone from the US to get Canadian dollars. I do all the exchanges at the bank.

Let's put it this way, if fees were always in Canadian funds, you would have been pissed off that the rates were skyrocketing due to a weak US dollar in the last few years, instead, guests should be happy that they can still pay in US dollars. When a camp owner charges you in your own currency, he's doing you a service by dealing with the volatile exchange rates so you don't have to."
