Bought a small drift sock last year for Canada camp boat. Worked pretty good especially when doing long , open water drifts for Lake Trout. It too is kind of a pain in the butt. Used a gallon ice cream bucket to store the bag in (the boat) when not using it. Pooch"

556791,Guest,2006-05-02 12:59:00,0,Let's get one thing straight. Windsocks are lawn and garden ornaments. Driftsocks are serious fishin tools. ;)
556795,Guest,2006-05-02 13:55:00,0,"I have a medium windsock that I picked up last year before we left. We had some great luck using it to slow down the drift going with the wind. It made it much easier to fish lighter tackle (hook, split shot, leech) and we banged the 'eyes with this method. Took that time of fighting the wind and using all the trolling motor batteries out of the equation. I purchased mine from Cabelas. I use it on a 17.5 foot Ranger Cherokee. Worked great."
556798,chuck c c,2006-05-02 15:51:00,34,Tie a light line to the small end of the drift sock and use that to pull the drift sock in at the end of the drift. That spills all the water and makes it much easier to take out of the water. I tie the light line to the main line with some slack so I don't drop the light line overboard.
