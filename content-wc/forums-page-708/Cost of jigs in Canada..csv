I only make the spinners, playing with lead for large production items can be hazardous to your health if you don't have the proper safety equipment. (i do make my own jigs and weights)."

556448,grt1,2006-04-24 16:30:00,259,if you are looking at plain jigs about $.35 US ($.55 canadian). If you want the fancy paint jobs or whistle type they are about $1. US each at your local canadian tackle store.
556453,pikemike,2006-04-24 17:10:00,95,"Gull Rock, heard you've had open water! Also, do you make jigs in addition to your spinners?"
556466,dewyg,2006-04-24 20:02:00,1006,"If you buy them at a tackle shop you will get tagged big time. Buy your jigs off of ebay, you will save a great deal."
556478,jigman 2003,2006-04-25 08:03:00,981,"No, I make my own jigs. My question was out of curiousity. I know you can get 100 of the same color jig from Cabela's or BPS for around $15 + shipping, but was wondering what they went for at Canadian Tire or anywhere else they are cheap. My question would be in reference to painted roundhead jigs."
