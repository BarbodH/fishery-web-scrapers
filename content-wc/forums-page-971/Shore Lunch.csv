518146,Guest,2002-03-20 20:13:00,0,The rumour is true....but it only applies to Americans. Canadians can still eat Walleye on Lac Seul.
518147,Guest,2002-03-21 08:01:00,0,Thank God it's less than 60 days to opening day!
518148,Tim,2002-04-04 14:51:00,179,Ditto
518149,Red Ruffandsore,2002-04-04 19:19:00,81,"I heard a rumour that the CO's are going to be carrying ultrasound equipment to count and measure the fish eaten during a shore lunch. If the count in the stomach along with the livewell contents are over the limit, you are busted. Pepto Bismol has been known to block ultrasound sensors, so pack some in the tackle box.Stay off the pipe...and don't forget to wipe.Red"
518136,Guest,2002-03-13 14:01:00,0,"Hey,There is a rumor going around that while fishing Lac Suel a person may not be able to eat fish for shore lunch anymore. Have any of you heard this rumor? Hopefully it is just that, a rumor, and I can forget I heard it.Josh"
518137,Guest,2002-03-13 14:59:00,0,"JOSH YOUR RUMOR IS TRUE. NO MORE FISH FOR SHORE LUNCH AT LAC SEUL. THATS WHY THE PRICE OF LEECHES ARE SO HIGH IN CANADA. BUT THEY'RE WORTH IT, SAUTE THEM IN BUTTER WITH A LITTLE ONION AND SALT. THEY'RE DELICIOUS. MAKE SURE THEY'RE FULLY COOKED THOUGH, BECAUSE THEY ARE TOUGH LITTLE BUGGERS TO KILL. YOU'LL KNOW IF THEY ARE STILL ALIVE IF THEY STICK TO THE INSIDE OF YOUR THROAT ON THE WAY DOWN. IF THIS HAPPENS SWALLOW A LIVE LITTLE PERCH (ABOUT A 3 INCHER) AND IT WILL EAT THE LEECH ON THE WAY DOWN. I KNOW THIS WOULD BE CONSIDERED A FISH AT SHORE LUNCH AND IS ILLEGAL, BUT IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. SNOOKY"
518138,Guest,2002-03-13 15:10:00,0,I heard another rumor that you cannot buy a fish sandwich at the McDonalds in Dryden anymore.
518139,Guest,2002-03-13 15:22:00,0,"I highly recomend NOT using the 3"" perch method!Last summer while eating my leach sandwich,or it might have been the leach stew, one of the leaches(obviously not dead) attached itself to my throat.I needed to swallow at least 8 or 9 perch to get the job done.The problem is that the perch dont die right away and they keep trying to swim back up!.I had to drink a 12 pack of beer before the perch were drunk enough to pass out."
518140,Guest,2002-03-13 15:27:00,0,"you are 100% correct. the new law states that no fish can be consumed during a shore lunch on Lac Seul.The rule does not outline the legality of cooking up some fresh Bald Eagle, Horned Owl or a duck billed platapuss. So enjoy!"
518141,Guest,2002-03-13 15:33:00,0,I think cabin fever has struck!
518142,Guest,2002-03-13 16:01:00,0,I suppose now you going to tell me i cant drink beer in my boat in canada. But seriously if you can beat up the bears that are competing for the rock point for your shore lunch then your good to go. Just remember to have your fishing license.
518143,Guest,2002-03-14 07:00:00,0,"I am assuming that people replying to your message are being sarcastic as I am not aware of any new regulation stating that fish may not be consumed for shore lunch on Lac Seul. I just looked through the 2002 summary and no mention of this anywhere although it has always been contrary to regulations to eat fish for shore lunch then go out and not count those fish in your daily limit, ie. catch more than your daily limit but have eaten enough for shore lunch to keep you at your daily limit in possession."
518144,Guest,2002-03-19 15:08:00,0,"Josh Would you like to buy the Empire State Building, I can get it pretty cheap for you."
518145,NateW,2002-03-20 19:59:00,96,"I think I see where the confusion is...the rumor you heard is about building a shorelunch fire on Lac Suel, that you cannot do--not because of Ontario MNR rules, but because of the laws of nature building a fire on Lac Seul is completely impossible. Especially after ice-out.Find a spot on the SHORE to build your fire, then you'll be all right.(You have to tell these rookies everything!)"
