518744,Tim,2002-03-31 13:30:00,179,Planning a trip to Cedar Lake Camp (located 30 miles north of Vermillion Bay) in early June. Does anyone out there have any expert advise on this lake. Will be my 1st trip to Canada.

Personally, I really don't think you need a guide that lake is not that big, just talk to the owners, boat boys, they can usually give you a hint where the guys from the previous week were catching them. Since there is no slot limit on that lake, you will catch a fair amount of walleyes, but very few (if any) real big guys. Sound like a fun trip. Good Luck!"
518747,Guest,2002-04-03 10:37:00,0,We have gone to Cedar Lake Camp the last two years. If you want to catch alot of walleyes early in June go to Redwater Bay ( far SOUTHEASTERN BAY) fish around the islands at the east end and the west side of the bay to the north of the islands. The water in this bay is darker and warms up faster in the spring. This is closer to the spawning areas too. We also had some luck in 4 o'clock bay but expect some company there. The part of Cedar Lake south of the narrows has clearer water and is tougher when the water is cool for walleyes. Ask the camps for a map and these bays are on the lake map. Hope this helps.
