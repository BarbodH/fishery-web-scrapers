518905,Guest,2002-04-02 17:56:00,0,we are planning a trip to LAC SEUL LODGE this fall and would like to know if anybody out there has fished lac seul during the latter part of sept for WALLEYE AND NORTHERN. Northern is almost as important to us as the walleye. thank you for any information that you can give in advance....pepe
518906,Guest,2002-04-02 22:42:00,0,"Hate to tell you but Lac Seul usually turns over sometime between the 20-30 of sept each year; Fishing better in early Oct if you can take the weather. Thats when the big ones come up to fill up before freeze up. May find a nice musky in Oct if you stay around the rock piles and reefs fishing walleye, pike- big ones- like the rock piles too. Deep water of of grassy creeks will draw big fish of all kinds as they feed on the spawning cisco that spawn in these creeks just before ice in.Have fished here since the 50's and the turn over varies little with normal fall weather patterns; last year was the best exception I can remember with turnover a week or so late. Walleye fishing was good in the narrows everwhere on the lake even into moose hunting. Called out many a moose for clients while jigging walleye over the side of boat."
