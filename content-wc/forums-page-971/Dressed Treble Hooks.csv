I would really appreciate it. Thanks"
518921,Guest,2002-04-03 18:10:00,0,"Paul, there are several things you can do to get the flairing:1)Try building up a ""bump"" of thread behind where the hair will be tied. Then, when you tie in the hair, it will be diverted out. It works best to cement the bump as you are building it, use head cement, lacquer, etc, and let dry before tying in the hair.2)Try applying a little more tension to the thread as you are tying in the hair. This will cause it to flair. Too much will weaken and cut through, however.3)Try using "" body"" hair, rather than ""tail"" hair. The body hair is more hollow and will flair more. The down side is that it is also weaker, for the same reason, and also is shorter.4) Try applying head cement to the butts of the hair before tying. Just ""flatten"" the clump of hair, roll between the fingers or pull into a flat clump. Then apply the cement liberally to the butt end, maybe 3/8 of an inch. Let dry and then tie in. After finishing, apply cement to threads. After drying, grab hair ends and bend out from hook, being careful not to pull loose. Apply another coating of cement. Periodically while fishing, you can force hair out if it starts to ""unflair"". By the way, I find while tying it works best to tie tight the wraps holding the hair, but the wraps towards the eye that are produced to even out the tie should be somewhat looser, as the thread has a tendancy, though memory, to try to push the hair backwards, resulting in the hair becoming untited and falling out.Sorry for the long post, hope this helps.Have fun,Bill"

518923,Guest,2002-04-04 08:50:00,0,Thanks for the info - Can you tell me more about the silicone tape and paint process??Thanks
518924,fishinnut,2002-04-05 09:15:00,642,"The silicon tape I am referring to is available at the hardware store. It is used on pipe threads. Usually 1/2 inch in width, so cut down to 1/4 inch width. Wrap tight around thread and paint with enamel."
