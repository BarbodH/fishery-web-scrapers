518859,Guest,2002-04-02 12:27:00,0,I will be fishing out of the Linn Lake area in early June - Anybody have any idea what I should expect? What lake should I go to and for what?MN
518860,Guest,2002-04-02 12:41:00,0,Fished the Lynn Lake area four years ago. Hang onto your rod and have a great time. The fishing was super. We flew into a lake about 100 miles north of Lynn and the Walleyes were nice sized and plentiful. We have some Pike addicts in our group and they got several 40 inch plus fish.
