518902,Bobby,2002-04-03 00:39:00,211,"I have family that live in the Duck Mountain Park. While they fish for trout I do know that there are a few lakes there that have walleyes, such as Wellman which is just south of Swan River. I've never fished the area for walleye however my dad caught four master angler rainbows and one master angler arctic char in the park last june."
