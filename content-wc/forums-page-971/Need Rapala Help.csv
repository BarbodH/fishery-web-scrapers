Floating, Sinking, Countdown, as well as various lengths.I'm just wondering how to fish each type and what a good length to buy would be.ThanksAVS"

518750,Karl,2002-03-31 17:16:00,63,"I've been fishing the Sioux Lookout area lakes for ten years and have narrowed down what works best for me to the following:The #7 Blue-chrome (discontinued by Rapala in 2002) is best for trolling (or casting) from ten feet to about five feet of water. That's where the walleyes will be until the sun gets to high in the sky (before 10:00 A.M.). If you can't find that one get the #7 Shad color. I picked up a couple of the new ""holographic"" blue-silver to try this year. For later in the day and deeper water you can't beat the #9 Risto Rap in the Parrot color. Don't know why, but that color outfishes all the other colors. It trolls about 18-20 feet on ten pound test. Use a thin leader, as an occasional 30in northern will take it. Or the #9 Shad Rap in blue-chrome or perch colors, but it doesn't go below 16 feet.For northerns, the largest size suspending husky-jerk in dark orange color is dynamite. If you don't get a northern on the second twitch, there are none in the area.And don't forget, the guy using an eigth oz. orange jig with a minnow (or crawler or white Power Grub) will get ten fish to every one you get with a rapala.Disclaimer: the above is works for June and July. After that the walleyes go to 25-40 feet of water, and no crankbait will work."
518752,Big Tim,2002-04-01 07:56:00,63,"where on Lac Seul are you fishing? We fish the west end from the dam at Ear Falls all the way back to broad lake at the end of May. Rapalas are fine, as are wally divers, But the # 1 producers for us has been spinner rigs Followed by jigs tipped with a minnow or leech. Chartreuse & hammered gold were the best producing colors for us. For more detailed info. email me @ [email protected]. Have a blast, Lac Seul is a real walleye factory!"
518753,Walleye Wacker,2002-04-01 08:29:00,6,Have fished early June on the Lac Seul several times. I think the best presentation in June is jig and leechs or Minnows. Fish will be in spawn or post spawn and not to many will be out on main lake structure. Rapalas seem to work best after July 1st when you can troll larger areas and deeper water. This pattern helps locate eyes for jigging. I agree with earlier statement that jig fishing will produce more and bigger fish in June. My favorite Rapala is #5 or #7 in Perch or chrome/blue. Overall best color combinations seem to be those with green-black-red-orange. Combinations of these work well. keep your rapala in touch with the bottom and I like to drop it back with the tip of the rod and move it forward to make it appear more erratic....Dont know where on the lake you will be but talk to some of the locals and try to find out where the spawning areas are and fish them or lake structure close to the spawning areas.....Good luck
