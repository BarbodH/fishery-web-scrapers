517295,Guest,2002-02-19 07:24:00,0,"Nuker,Wife hates to fly, we will drive up from central Wisconsin. Was in the Ignace area last Sept hunting birds and some fishing. I didn't fish enough. We had a blast exploring a new lake each day but felt rushed because we hunted in the morning, kind of like trying to take in all the parks at Disney Land in one day.We have a cabin on a lake we can stay at in Wisconsin, we're still young enough were we don't suffer to much the next day if we don't sleep in a bed. Tent camping in some off the trail location seems appealing.ThanksKDS"
517301,manitobawalleye,2002-02-19 16:29:00,885,check the ontario regulations like previous person stated as only canadians can camp on crown land for free or without a permit...cannot exactly recall the scenario as it is against all the lodge owners profit margin....try ontariofising.net/ posted below or search for ontario mnr web sitesomeone else will post the site if you cannot findhere's 4 sites to starthttp://sunsetcountry.net/category.cfm/code/0/tbid/2/http://www.justfishontario.com/http://www.fishingxcanada.com/http://www.ontariofishing.net/
517302,Guest,2002-02-20 21:14:00,0,"I have the same problem about sunburn. I went to Goodwill and bought some very thin (almost worn out) long sleeve cotton shirts. It keeps me from getting sunburn!! I use max suncream on the backs of my hands and on my face, as does my wife. After 2 weeks in August, if we don't we have ""nightcrawler"" lips from sun poisoning. We also use caps that have ""desert legion flaps"" down the back to protect our necks ... made by Columbia ... got them at Gander. A person could wear a baseball cap and put a white men's hankie under it to protect the back of the neck if one cannot find the same type of hat.Look up www.justfishontario.com and click on ""big fish"". You will see one of the hats with one of our walleyes. Tom"
517303,Guest,2002-02-22 14:57:00,0,"If you bring you wife in late May she will not get sunburned. However, she will hate you forever because you exposed her to the worst weather on the planet. Just kidding. If you want a nice trip late August is a good time to go. Press Lake (Ignace) has good fishing that time of year. Agimac River Outfitters is a good place if you don't mind driving to some of the area lakes once you get there. Lac Suel is a good choice for easy and consistant walleye fishing. Lake St. Joseph gets many recommedations on this site. I'm planning on going up there for the first time in late August. TGG"
517304,Guest,2002-03-16 12:00:00,0,Whoa!!! Man...Take your wife to Canada ???...You need to check the Provience Laws...Section 275-672 page 42 paragraph G.....No married man may bring his wife to Canadian ground without a presigned agreement from her that she will do... What she is told...When she is told....How she is told....and will reply to all questions with ...Yes Oh Great Fisherman.......Thats the way we do it in Kentucky......PS. Anybody seen my wife???
517305,Guest,2002-03-16 18:24:00,0,"Well dern Billy,my woman wants to know if your woman doesn't already behave thata way. w.va"
517306,Guest,2002-03-16 19:30:00,0,I think I know where she is headed...I gave direction to a southern gal yesterday.....she payed for the whole tour.....kept answering....Yes oh great fisherman.....great lady and a fast learner....passed with flying colours.....said she had enough of the 9.9 and was looking for a trolling motor.
517307,Guest,2002-03-16 21:22:00,0,"Dock Boy, Yup I bet that was her. She likes to travel at night because the sunlight is tough on her fair skin. Did she have all her teeth in or just the one gold one on top and the silver one on the bottom. Dont be scared by her looks...she can clean a mess of Crappie in no time and she will keep your boat clean has a hounds tooth. I sure miss her ...if you see her again tell her if she comes back home I will let her run the trooling motor all she wants....Thanks"
517308,Guest,2002-03-31 18:26:00,0,"I fished that area since '89. Missed last year, family health problems. In '00 took my wife for the first time. Always wanted to camp in the ""bush"". The guys never would. We truck camp, due to age can't take ""tenting"" anymore, wish I could. In '95 my hunting & fishing partner got a 11 lb. 33.5 "" ""walter"". We always went the first week of August, still bugs but not bad. One year we went as late as third week in September, broke ice at the landings. In '00 after bugs, storms, heat I though my wife would say never again, she was ready to come back on the trip home. We stayed two nights at the provincial park on Sandbar Lake. Better than some of the nice state parks in Wisconsin. When I took my wife, I didn't get much fishing time, I wanted her to have a good time. This year we're going back. Try any of the lakes off the North Road off 599."
517309,Melonbob_ON,2002-04-01 21:13:00,61,"Personally, I find the fishing way easier in May, all you have to do is the the first point out from spawning creeks, and clean house...but the weather can be horrible, and the bugs may or may not be started by then, depending on how mild out spring is. If you want more fish, go at the end of May, if you want to enjoy the weather and catch some fish, definately go in August....(:"
517290,Guest,2002-02-18 08:19:00,0,"Can't decide when to go.End of May to end of August time frame. Looking at Ignace/Silver Dollar area. About 6 days.I would like to treat my wife to some good fishing but avoid bugs and scortching sun, (red head, with light complextion). ThanksKDS"
517291,Guest,2002-02-18 12:35:00,0,Go in August....The bugs have usually died down a little and early in the season can be hit or miss. On the really hot days we are on the water at dawn and usually are all fished out by the time it starts to get really hot. We then go for our afternoon siesta. Good luck.

Just kidding I agree mid august to late august for bugs. Later in Aug. and early spet. the wether should be cooloing off a bit. Have funDuffy"
517293,Guest,2002-02-18 13:48:00,0,"Duffy, ThumperWife is diehard fisher person and I get ""lucky"" whether the fish bite or not. I'm looking forward to it.Thanks, we were leaning toward the end of August. Week of 18 to 24th or the week before.Do either of you know if we can camp any old place or do we need to make reservations somewere. She wants as much of the wilderness experience she can get. Gotta appreciate a girl like that.ThanksKDS"
517294,Guest,2002-02-18 15:51:00,0,Were you talking about a fly-in trip? If so you might need a few more people in your party. Most resorts have 4 people miminums. I have been going to nestor falls fly-in for 7 yrs and it been great Dave & michelle will treat you right.
517296,Guest,2002-02-18 16:31:00,0,"Its always best to have a place ahead of time. If you are camping in the ""bush"" check the OMNR regs for limits and fees if there are any in that area. Have a good time. With the lack of snow this year it has all the makings of a good year for bugs. I have observed that when we get little or no snow the following season has very few bugs."
517297,Guest,2002-02-18 18:34:00,0,Contact Brad or Karen at Ignace Outposts (they have a website). See if you can book Cabin 2 of Lake Metionga in August. Perfect set up.
517298,iamwalleye1,2002-02-18 20:08:00,1589,I take my wife in august! I go for a week and then she comes up for the second week! The bugs are gone except them damm black flies! She likes the weather. I think it is more stable that time of year! I wen't out fishing one morning early came back for breakfast my wife had pictures of a bear on the porch of the cabin! Well that was the last time she stayed in the cabin. Now she gets up and goes with me! But don't tell your wife that!
517299,Tim Blanchette,2002-02-18 20:44:00,4,"I have been lucky to be able to make two trips to that area a year for the last six years. The weather has been warmer for the August trips. The bugs are often dependent on the rainfall. In August the walleyes have been concentrated on the classic structure, points, sunk islands, weed lines. I'll be up there around the same time this year lets hope for good wheather."
