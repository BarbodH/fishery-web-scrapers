518527,Todd_NE,2002-03-26 13:17:00,1330,"Thanks for the reply, I appreciate your time. I hope the recreational greenback fishing rebounds this year for locals and visitors. After all the trips up there, many with ""new"" people, someone finally broke down and mounted a greenback last year, they just couldn't see letting it go within sight of the net flags. I tried to explain that's how 14's become 16's, but this person wasn't convinced it wouldn't be supper anyway. I'm a selective harvest person over true catch and release, but somehow it seemed pretty melancholy at the time. The ethical dilemma of releasing a trophy for another to enjoy vs. keeping it as a momento, yet understanding many ""first nation"" folks need the subtinence - and others do not. It is a quandary.I think I'd be better off never seeing that net emptied out in the mouth of the Winnipeg. Give me nightmares for a long time I'm sure...Peace, and I hope you have a safe summer season without accident or heinous offenders.Todd"
518528,Randy,2002-03-26 14:44:00,53,Have fished the Winnipeg but the last ten years have gone to the Red. Fishing was slow last October but we went back in November and did very good. I hope nobody who fishs there spends $150 per lb because if you are you are having a bad day. I would guess our per lb cost of landed and released fish is closer to 20 cents a lb....Beer costs are higher.
518520,fishcop,2002-03-26 15:09:00,11,"I wonder how you came up with $150 a pound? An average angler catch and releases probably 50 lbs of fish a day, coming out to $7500 a day. Where do you fish so I know where to avoid going for a fishing holiday! Your figure of $1 a pound is somewhat mistaken, as commercial fishermen get $4.50 a pound. Along Lake Winnipeg and Lake Manitoba,as well as Northern Manitoba, commercial fishing is a major employer, and creates business for local service industry. In many communities, it is the only source of income. I don't want to seem condescending, however to net or not to net is a bigger picture than presented, with alot at stake. Commercial fishermen stand to lose if the fishery collapse, most have loans out for boats/motors as well as bombadiers. In Manitoba, commercial fishing is one of the older resource use industries, and will continue for a long time to come. This is a topic that will be debated as long as commercial fishermen and anglers share the same water and resource. I don't want ot come off as pro commercial fishing, however I feel that as working in the resource field, I can offer the other side of the coin in regards to this industry. No doubt the same could be said about the forest industry in Canada as we pay a 29% softwood lumber tariff. Better to leave the trees standing and deal with unemployment? Renewable resources are just that RENEWABLE! Responsibility lies with all users to ensure it stays that way."
518521,Todd_NE,2002-03-27 08:27:00,1330,"I took Eddy's comments as just making the point that possibly/probably recreational fishing puts far more $$$ and jobs into the economy than does commercial fishing. When you add up gas, boats, lodging, food, licenses, tackle, bait, etc., it is pretty amazing what the recreational angler spends for the amount of resources used in comparison to commercial fisherman. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I suspect Manitoba fisheries/game officers are largely funded by sporting interests vs. commercial interests? I do not know.We have similar issues here in the states regarding netting, river barge navigation rights, the protection of endangered species, agriculture, flood control, etc.Here in the Midwest we have seen a dramatic improvement for catfishing on rivers where commercial fishing has been banned or significantly reduced. I'm not in favor of running someone out of business, but the farm produced catfish market was already doing that.It's good to evoke culture and history, I'm sentimental myself. My family started ranching and farming in Nebraska when it was ""take all the land you can get - or keep"" and supper was a rifle bullet away, no matter the season.As I've said before, it's an interesting issue and I appreciate your viewpoint and comments.Todd"
518522,Hawgeye,2002-03-27 15:36:00,1355,"Fishcop,Thank you for your responses. I would like to know if per pound of $4.50 is strictly meat or the weight of the whole fish. Of course you are talking Canada funds so I suppose it is for the entire fish. I think BackwaterEddy had a very good point in that the visiting sportsman spends many more dollars on the community than commercial fishing collects. I alone brought $1800 of US money up to canada in my boat over 2 trips with 3 guys just to go fishing for 16lbs of fillets. Below is where I describe how I came up with that weight.Lets say that we each brought home 4 fish averaging 2lbs each for two different trips. That is a total 24 fish at 48 pounds before reducing them to fillets which may end up being only about 1/3 of the total weight of the fish. That being said, 16 lbs of fillets were actually brought home and out of $1800, that equates to $113 per lb!!!! Funny, BE's numbers were pretty close to mine. I agree that we received much more for our dollar than 16 lbs of fillets such as catch and release, a few meals, some gas, some bait, licenses, hotel, an adult beverage at the lodge, ...the list gos on but none of those things would be done without those fish. May it only be a perception that netting is the reason for the fishing to have been bad but perception could eventually cause less income from sports fisherman. I know that there are at least 80 rooms in Pine falls that are basically full all of October and more than 2 people are in every room. Add all those numbers up just for that town just for one month of the year and I think you will find the money brought in is staggering!!!I really appreciate your insight and being candid to discuss things here. I have been checked by your fellow officers and maybe even you and have been treated with respect and dealt with very cordial and helpful individuals. Sorry to be so windy but the netting thing strikes a sore spot with me. I respect Manitoba's laws and rules that are in place, I just think that they could be changed in a way that all could benefit."
518523,River_eye,2002-03-27 18:21:00,1486,"I see what fishcop is talking about, and I understand it. It's all about balance.Yes, if commercial netting was totally banned, then the fishing would be better. If the fishing was better, more anglers would travel and spend money here. In order for what your saying to have merit, the increase in sport fishermen dollars would have to compensate for the dollars lost from having no commercial netting. Do you think that's possible? I'm not so sure it is.It's just not economical for these communities to all of the sudden stop netting and open lodges."

518532,Guest,2002-03-31 06:10:00,0,"Most of you guys are saying that you didn't have much luck in october.I find year after year that if your fishing around the 2 tournaments in october things slow down considerably.I also find that it really doesn't pick up till a week after the last tournament.Look Traverse bay isn't all that big and when you get 200+ boats buzzing around it day in day out I find the walleye are really stressed out.Sure there were big numbers on the tournament boards but most of the top winners got there fish out on devil's island on the lake away from all the commotion.Also it's harder to really zero in on them at this time,when you do find a little school of some hungry wally's soon as you catch a couple your surrounded by a ton of boats and get pushed off them.If your fishing around the tournaments I do know that the flats are going to be alot harder so try to book your trip around them.You will find the fishing better and the rooms more avalable.Last year wasn't as good as other years but it was a late run.I only got 19 masters last year but 15 of them were in late november.I got 2 masters on nov 27 the day before I put my boat away and I was banging them as hard as other years for the 2 weeks previous.Another good point that you might not know is the nets have to out by october 30th so the wally's have a clear shot at the river.I have always found that the fishing has always been better in late october till freeze up with the exception of 2000 when they came in at the beginning of Sept.So pull out them thermal's and try a latter holiday and I'm sure you'll have more success."
518533,Backwater Eddy,2002-04-01 07:11:00,3871,"I am wondering how many of the USA or Canadian crowd go for the fishing, and not the meat?In 10 years of multiple trips per year (17 trips last season alone) I have yet brought a single pound of fish back to the USA with me, or cleaned and consumed any for that fact. I do not go for the meat, I can get all I need at home if I wish fresh fish.My point is, if the quantity and quality of the fishing suffers from netting, I would not go North. I go to look for a certain piggy fish and not to fish for the cooler full of fish.Some day I may bring home one fish, God willing? Most trips I would just as soon bring back home some pleasant fishing memories, and lots of pictures of piggy fish.Backwater Eddy ~ ~><sUMo> ~ ><>http://home.talkcity.com/ResortRd/backwtr1/index.html"
518534,Todd_NE,2002-04-01 13:01:00,1330,"Ed,When I fish Manitoba or Ontario for walleyes I do try to have one fish fry while there and another when we get back. It's a good way to involve the wives, look at pix, and relive a few memories.I'll have to admit. I'm a little like ol' Doug Stange in that I want to get my cast iron out, maybe fry a few donuts, do up some fish, tater's, and beans.That said, if I keep 1% of the fish I catch a year of any species, I'd be shocked.T"
518535,River_eye,2002-04-01 13:54:00,1486,"Good to hear that you guys care about our resources. There are some people on both sides of the border that don't have respect for the resource.Todd, you mentioned doughnuts? Do you have a good recipe for them cooked at shorelunch?"
518536,Todd_NE,2002-04-01 14:33:00,1330,"Eric,Just buy the small or large biscuit tubes. I usually buy the small ones that you can get 3 or 4 tubes for a $1. Just separate the biscuits and and poke a hole in them. Cook them on one side, then turn them over in the oil. When they're golden brown take them out, put them on a paper towel to dry, and lightly dust them with regular or powdered sugar. They aren't quite as light as Tim Horton donuts, but they sure disappear!My ol' buddy Jim from Manitowoc, WI sez that the dough helps season the oil. I'm not sure about that but for some reason a pre-fish donut fry seems to go over big wherever I've been.The wife likes it so much we do it for a wknd breakfast now and then.Enjoy!By the way, I've had the PRIVILEDGE of seeing untold numbers of piggies up at Pine Falls and I can tell you this, it's truly a place where you know letting those fish of a lifetime go means you may get to see a fish of the millenium sometime. I'm thinking a couple of those 14's oughta be about.... #____ right now... I'm hoping someone gets to say hi and goodbye to them again someday.Todd"
518537,River_eye,2002-04-01 20:04:00,1486,"Do you find these biscuit tubes up here in Canada, or just where you're at? I'm not sure if I know what you're talking about."
518538,chrism,2002-04-01 21:26:00,429,Dude!I think they are those 'cookie' dough in tubes that are in safeway - I've seen them around the cheese section!cm
518539,Todd_NE,2002-04-02 06:54:00,1330,"Eric,It seems I found some in Selkirk one time. Just go to the refrigerated section of your grocery store. You should be able to find ""biscuits in a tube"" of various brands. It's just a small cardboard tube with pre-sliced biscuits in the tube. I usually buy the ""off brand"" ones in the smaller tube, they taste just as good.T"
518526,fishcop,2002-04-04 08:50:00,11,"Hawgeye, the $4.50 a pound is for fillets, as for the amount it would be in American coin, no doubt less than that. My thoughts are based on catch and release as it seems to be more prevalant among American on the Winnipeg, most that I check at the end of the day have little or no fish on board, reporting that they released them all. I look at the actual fish caught, as there is no way on gods green earth that the cost of fish caught by angling can ever be viewed as a efficient way to put fish on the table. These are my views, and I, as many Canadians realize the $ spent by Americans, however the fishery is also used by Canadian anglers, who also spend locally. When I posted my views, I had no misconception that I would change anyone's views, however I only wanted to air the other side of the argument from a ground view. Food for thought."
518524,Todd_NE,2002-03-28 08:47:00,1330,"I respect your opinion Eric. I also think the point is being made that to keep that ""balance"", at least at the southern end of the lake. Recreational anglers have to have success, enjoy the area, and believe that future trips will be as good or better. Otherwise eventually the recreational angler decides to go to Bay de Noc, Oregon, Peck, Sakakawea, Saginaw, Mille Lacs - wherever. The traveling recreational angler is mobile and fickle, but a dang free spender. While I believe that last year was an aberration, a lot of people who have recreationally fished the Red and Winnipeg a great deal over the past 5 years or so feel the fishery is in decline. I know of no statistics to prove this false or true. Personally, our success over the last ten years was more based on timing, weather, and our own abilities - I think.Obviously the fisherman are still coming. I checked today and everything is full when I wanted to go this fall. I found this out because my own reservations were ""lost"". Oops.It's just difficult to see such large net(s) and not have some negative feelings. And as to balance, I don't think there is any hard data to say whether it is, was, or will be in balance - whatever mythically that is.It also sounds like two things are going on. One, the nets don't really get many fish so it isn't a big deal. Number two, it's a very big deal because of the huge economy netting supports. Either way or both, I love the area and the people I've made friends with and met.Have a great season!!!todd"
518525,Hawgeye,2002-03-28 11:09:00,1355,"I must change what I said above. I don't know that there are 80 rooms in that town. After I reread what I posted, There may be more like 45-60. Someone please correct me if I am wrong."
518529,Guest,2002-03-29 14:30:00,0,"Come on now.I'm a commercial fisherman and we mostly use 3"" to 3.5"" nets and we don't strech across the river like some guys.Myself and also many of my other fellow commercail fishermen also don't like that a few guys figure that they should use 6"" to 6.5"" nets in the mouth of the river.We stay back from the opening out side of Traverse Bay and want the big ones to get through and spawn.It's to bad only a few number of commercial fishermen think other wise and give us other guys a bad name.There is no reason why anyone should go just after the Lunkers other then Freshwater fish has a market for them.Stop the market for the Lunkers and then maybe these few wayword fishermen would use a smaller net and fish the eaters not the breaders,"

518514,iamwalleye1,2002-03-24 07:09:00,1589,"That is why they call it fishing not catching! I also found last year to be a tough bite! The walleyes were starting to make a good come back on the winnipeeg with the size restrictions. But now I hear about netting for white fish and maybe some walleyes. It has taken me years to get to know the system, I have made two trips a year for about 10 years and ever year I find new spots to fish and the fish that were in the spots the year before may have moved to another spot!"
518512,Guest,2002-03-24 14:26:00,0,Last year there was a good river bite with Jigs and Large live Minnows. The lake bite was slow.
518515,fishcop,2002-03-24 18:18:00,11,"I work the Winnipeg River at Pine Falls as a Resource Officer (Game warden for those from the south), and can attest that the success was down. Reasons-who knows, Lake Winnipeg is huge, look at a map and you'll see how huge. I heard lots of reasons why the angling was poor, however, one thing I know, netting is not it! Commicial fishing has been ongoing on Lake Winnipeg since the early 1900's in one form or another. Fisheries monitors the catch and regulates the lake quota based on the annual allowable yield. Years previous when the bite was hot, the commercial fishermen were present on the lake, and I didn't hear many comments about the netting when the fishing was good. Hope you all continue to come North, however that is your choice. I know that next year there will be more anglers out there, and hopefully the fall migration of green backs materialize. Till next fall-stay safe and good fishing!"
518516,Guest,2002-03-25 18:13:00,0,"Nice to get some reliable info, eases my mind in regards to netting."
518517,Todd_NE,2002-03-26 08:23:00,1330,"Thanks for the info FishCop, sincerely.After traveling north for so many years and enjoying great success I think last year was hopefully an aberration caused by mother nature. Possibly all those big greenbacks stayed safe and warm out of harm's way.I was wondering though how you know that netting is not a contributor? There have been reports even on WalleyeCentral from ""netters"" saying they really aren't checked that closely, at least in other locations. I'm really not trying to start an argument just wonder how you check commercial fisherman there. It probably just is the fact most of us recreational fisherman are not used to seeing nets running around 2 miles long where we are fishing, or in necked down areas. I saw a gill net once in Wisconsin full of fish that has had a very lasting impression on me in a negative way.I realize Lake Winnipeg is huge, about half the size of Nebraska. But certainly the ocean is huge, not all of it fertile or carrying all species of fish everywhere much as I suspect Lake Winnipeg is similar, and yet I think we'd all agree that commercial fishing has a huge impact on our oceans. I can't believe that commercial fishing doesn't have some impact on the Winnipeg system, even if small.Canada has it's own laws, enforcement, and culture. It is not my position nor right to say how to run your country. I love our trips north and will be there again this year.By the way, did anyone ever catch the bears at the Manitou? They seemed too smart for the trap... lolTodd"
518518,Guest,2002-03-26 08:51:00,0,"Good questions-I will try and answer to the best of my abilities. The catch is monitored several ways-individual quotas (which is the breakdown of the lake qouta somewhere around 2 million kgs) This includes not only walleye, but whitefish as well as nortern pike. Commercial fishermen are further monitored on the lake by Resource Officers to check for mesh size, rotten nets, as well as proper licences. A final check is done annual with index netting by fisheries branch, whereby the health of the fish populations are measured against computer models, as well as past year trends. As you can see, this is a simplified answer as the science of fisheries management is fairly complex. As for other areas refered to by actual commercial fishermen, I can't speak for other jurisdictions, other than to say in Manitoba we take our fishery resources seriously.This not to say we are without problems-I am sure you have read posts on the Lake Dauphin and Lake of the Prairies controversy with first nation fishing. All I can say is that first nations have always had the right to fish for food, and will continue to have that right as promised in treaties. This is factored into the grand scheme for fishery management. Lake Dauphin and Lake of the Praries are instances of individuals who are wishing to make a point, and they are not representative of all first nations. As in all walks of life there are troublemakers who wish to further their cause ( I see evidence of that on this site!)As for the bear problem at the Manitou, once all you anglers left town, we caught two at the Mantiou, and tranquilized one other in the general area. Bears love that fish cleaning shed behind the Manitou so much they won't get into the traps."
518519,Backwater Eddy,2002-03-26 11:02:00,3871,"With great respect to the MB fisheries system and the first nation peoples in Canada, I feel the present netting practices on the lake is unquestionably detrimental to the province and the peoples of Canada as a whole.I would have to say the continued netting of the big lake and the rivers will soon damage the walleye population in the system to a point where it will take decades to return, if at all. Subsequently destroying the fishery as well as the commerce from tourism generated by anglers. One would only have to look to the fisheries on other regions freshwater and saltwater to see this effect looming on the horizon.Fishing Guides in the MB region are reporting fewer and less large walleye in the past 4 years running on the rivers. There is real and valid cause for concern in the eyes of many, to the health and longevity of the present fishery.When angler dollar brings in $150.00 per pound to the whole community, in comparison to $1.00 a pound out of the net to only a few, it would appear to be foolishly utilized to say the least.Backwater Eddy ~ ~><sUMo> ~ ><>http://home.talkcity.com/ResortRd/backwtr1/index.htmlCherish reciprocal benevolence, which will make you as anxious for another's welfare as your own.- Aristippus of Cyrene, 365 BCE"
