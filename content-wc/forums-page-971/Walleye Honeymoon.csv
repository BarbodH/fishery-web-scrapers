We have had wonderful quality times fishing both in Canada and locally. More women should understand just how much fun this can be and how close you can get to each other.If your lady is an adventuresome person, a fly in might be just the ticket. There are many fine cabins out there that have most of the comforts such as running water and showers. They all come up with discounts for July and August and dispite what there literature says, they will take parties of 2 in during the slower months. I just can't think of a better place than having your own lake for a week.One last tip from a guy with 34 years in now. Get up before her and cook a nice breakfast and start the wood stove burning. Oh yes, congratulations!"
518398,Guest,2002-04-01 22:34:00,0,"Mike,A place to consider for your honeymoon is Tomahawk Resort. They are up on lake of the woods, and the accomodations are first class. Was there last July with my wife and rented one of their 17' boats. Great equipment and hospitality. The service was A-1. The web address is www.tomahawkresort.comGood luck on the honeymoon.Derek B."
518379,Guest,2002-03-20 12:34:00,0,"My wife and I went on our honeymoon to Andersons Lodge near Sioux Lookout. She ended up catching more fish than I did. This resort is plush, beautiful cabins and 3 great meals a day served on a flexible schedule. You don't have to get up at the crack of dawn or fish til dark to catch fish. My advice is to use a guide and use a bowrider (Andersons name for a 20 foot Lund with 115 HP Mercury)especially if you plan on fishing up into Lac Seul. My wife felt more secure in the larger boat and there was a cover on it in case it rained. In either case, remember that it is her vacation too. My wife likes to fish but she didn't want to put in 12 hour days in the boat. We always came in early to do other things. :)"
518390,Guest,2002-03-25 13:16:00,0,I just was at the boatshow and saw teh Happy Landing Lodge guys and it looked great check them out at www.happylandingfishing.com
518383,DarrenB,2002-03-25 14:14:00,28,"You're kidding right? If not, then man you are one lucky dude and I hope you know how good you have it! I had fun in Antigua when I got married but would much rather have spent it fishing in Canada. Ran that one past the wife 6 months before the big day, and the next day all her friends were emailing and laughing at me. I can't even get the wife out on the boat for more than 4 hours :("
518391,Guest,2002-03-25 14:25:00,0,"We got married last August and decided to spend a part of our honeymoon fishing for wally's. I looked at several places in NW Ontario which were drive-in and offered all the comfort and luxury of a resort.Try Totem Resorts, 5 star resort, great service, great food, fun fishing...a very comfortable resort with all the amenities. Look into this now as they have honeymoon packages with cottages/hot tubs etc.www.totemlodges.com You will love the fishing, she will love the being pampered at this resort !"
518392,Guest,2002-03-25 16:26:00,0,"Which of the ""Totem"" resorts did you stay at?"
518393,Guest,2002-03-25 17:44:00,0,"I also was there in August. Totem has two resorts. One is a resort with cabins, and that is Totem. Next door is YellowBird which they also own. Yellowbird is more romantic and has either cabins or a huge chalet with 15-20 rooms. Great food and service."
518394,ggg,2002-03-25 18:24:00,115,Totem has 3 resorts. They also own Wiley Point Lodge.
518386,BD,2002-03-26 00:49:00,739,My wife had her own fishing tackle when I met her; just so you know that you aren't the only lucky guy!
518395,Guest,2002-03-26 19:16:00,0,"You guys have it all wrong!!!! I found a woman who hates to fish. Then when I need to get away from her I just say,""Come on honey please come fishing with me."" She begs me to go with my buddies so she doesn't have to go. It works for me........."

518377,Guest,2002-03-19 20:09:00,0,My wife to be wants to go on our Honeymoon Walleye fishing in Canada...UNBELIEVABLE..I need to find a Resort that will fill her days with Walleyes and one that has good moonlight....Cmon Men help a fellow fisherman.....
518378,Guest,2002-03-19 20:59:00,0,"Walleye Fishing,LOL for a honeymoon?.LOL Hilarious, seriously try and take here to a nice place shell want to be with you, fishing, youll be divorced in 5 years LOL"
518380,Piscatorian,2002-03-19 21:23:00,12,"Dude, if you're serious then she is a keeper! Put her on the stringer (not one of those chain stringers, 'cause sometimes they open up and then they get away), and mount her. Does she have a sister? Even I might still be married if I found a woman like that."
518381,Guest,2002-03-19 22:15:00,0,Reply to you non belivers....This was her idea...she wants to fish by day and make love by night....and the best part is she has a job and she wants to buy a 18ft deep V Bass Tracker. Yes she does have a sister but she plays golf...which is still good.....Tell me about a Resort for lovers...Walleye too.
518382,Pannyraid,2002-03-20 07:59:00,3,The only advice that I can give you is to proceed with extreme caution. This sounds like a trap. Regards. ;)
518384,bphunger,2002-03-20 08:00:00,28,"Check out www.whitefishbaycamp.com. If you call ask about the honeymoon cabin on the point with bright moons, camp fires, and sunsets! Oh, and great walleyes too."
518385,Guest,2002-03-20 08:13:00,0,"bphunger, Thanks for the tip...Im checking the Lodge out today.....Thanks Again,Mike&Janet"
518387,DonC,2002-03-20 08:57:00,93,"Mike,I recommend Chaudiere Lodge at www.virtualnorth.com/chaudiere on the French River. They have gourmet chefs, good fishing, nice cabins and other activities. In western Ontario, Birch Island Resort is excellent on the Winnipeg River, near Minaki, but they don't have cabins. They are at www.birchislandresort.com. Have a good marriage,Don"
518388,bigfish1965,2002-03-20 10:48:00,3210,I second the French River. Make sure you are on the lower end though.
518389,JN,2002-03-20 11:41:00,47,"I went on my honeymoon to Wolverine Lodge. The fishing was great! The food and lodging are good. What is your budget, there are fancier places but dollar for dollar you can't beat the fishing."
