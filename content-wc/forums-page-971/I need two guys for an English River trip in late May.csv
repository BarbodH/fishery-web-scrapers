We used to camp, but the last couple years we've stayed in a pretty sweet cabin. Up until a couple days ago, we had our minimum of 4 guys for the trip...now we have 2 due to some pretty freakish events. I think that my buddy and I may have exhausted almost all of the potential candidates among our friends. There's still a possibilty that one or twwo may come through, but i still have to proceed with plan B because I can't count on plan A. This is a little bit scary to ask, but if there's two guys out there who might be interested, maybe we should talk. I don't want to lose the cabin for next year...it's ours for that last week in May every year until we decline it.I can give some more specific details about costs and what's included with the cabin if I think somebody is genuinly interested.My buddy and I aren't terribly hardcore...I would say we're average anglers at best, but I think we're both pretty easy to get along with. We always have a good time even when conditions are tough. We're there to fish, not drink.I'm open to any other legitimate suggestions too. Thanksw."
518456,Guest,2002-03-22 07:25:00,0,How many walleye due you get there on any given day??
518457,Guest,2002-03-22 08:23:00,0,"We don't usually spend full days on just walleye and like I said, we're average fisherman at best. But we've had 60 walleye in a good day. Usually when we're pulling in 30 or 40 per day though, the guys that really know what their doing are having 100 or even 200+days. One guy in particular (Tommy Ryan) is always there when we are. He's a guide on Rainy Lake but he spends his personal time at this place which should say something about the quality of this system. He always cleans up on the walleye and big pike...every day is a 150+ day for that guy, but he's very mysterious about where exacly he goes. At this time of year the smallies are staging or beginning to move up onto their beds. We always spend some time on smallies and there are monster pike in there too. We've never manage to boat any really big pike. There is some fishing pressure in addition to whoever is staying in the cabin; One camp is very close to where the cabin is and the other is way down river. Once you're on the water, you don't typically see many other fisherman. Also, this particular week that we go is only the second week after fishing opens so none of our favorite spots have been pounded.We put ALL walleye over 3 or 4 pounds back in the water as well as all the smallies. We don't typicilly keep any pike. We usually boat a fair number of 4-6 lb walleye. So far, my largest is only an 8 pounder although we've missed some larger ones. We're not there to drink (heavily) and we don't swear a lot, but we're not prudes either.This place is about 80 miles river system and Separation Lake is actually a very large widening of the English River...lots of variation in terrian and water. Its about 30 clicks NorthWest of Kenora, Ontario. From where we Live in Milwaukee, the drive (one way) is exactly 750 miles. The cabin includes boats w/gas, generator, fish house, stove, fridge. Cost per person is about $700.00I used to work in an office that shared space with Fishing Facts Magazine before it was bought out a second time. Naturally I talked with editors Carl Malth and Spence Petros pretty often and that's how I first found out about this place. I've been going there ever since. See if you can do a little research on your own and let me know if you might be interested or if you have any other questions. I'm going to need to resolve this whole thing pretty quickly. Where are you from anyway?w."
