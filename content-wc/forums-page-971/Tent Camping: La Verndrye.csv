I have emailed the park's headquarters for information and was simply told that there are lots of places to pitch camp and to, more or less, come on up. If anyone out there has any experience camping here (or in any Canadian wildlife preserve, for that matter), I'd sure appreciate some advice. I can trail a 14' boat and motor or pack a canoe. I am an experience camper with all the gear. My main interest is in catching walleye, northern and speckled trout. Thanks in advance to anyone who can suggest destinations or any other pertinent information."

I would definatly recommend a canoe trip as they have a set of trails with portages set out for you. All you have to do is decide what trip best fits your time schedual.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com
