517927,Babamel,2002-04-01 12:01:00,0,I find it intersting that this post (how much beer to bring) and the one about DWI have the most posts. Is there any relation between amount of drinking and DWI?
517928,Guest,2002-04-01 12:37:00,0,I bring 3 cases for a 7-day trip. Love CANADIAN and Sleemans. 3 other guys i go up with are much heavier drinkers ave a case a day plus hard liquor.
517929,Guest,2002-04-01 13:14:00,0,Drink 1 beer an hour on average starting about 11:00 am canada time (lol). I have 3 meals a day plus snacks and i seem to take it all in just fine. Plus dont you burn off a beer an hour anyways? Being over 200 lbs and eating every meal like it your last up there! being drunk is never an issue! Sometimes even enjoy a bloodymary with breakfast heck im on a remote lake no one else to hurt but myself. So please just relax and enjoy a blue for supper. P.S. how much are the prices this year on average for lets say a case of sleemans or blue?
517930,Thumper,2002-04-01 14:26:00,133,"About $32 Canadian for bottles and around $35 Can for cans. There are some ""deals"" at the beer store and the LCBO outlets. We fish on the premise that no fish ....no beer. However we will allow the credit system but be prepared to get a little grilling. LOL"

517914,Guest,2002-03-26 18:12:00,0,"I have to agree it's not fair, but life is not fair. If Canada had listened to the concerns on the frontside, they could have avoided this outcome. For instance 30% was going to happen, why didn't the providence levy a fee or tax to keep that money at home? Then if it was really too much they could have been creative and give the lumber companys an exemption on fuel/energy taxes or whatever? As far as a new house costing $2000 more in the USA, the Federal Govt. just gave tax rebates to everybody to stimulate the economy. So now we give it back through lumber and steel prices. Neither Govt. is ever going to give any free lunch! They give with one hand and take with the other.That's politics! The alternative is what they had in Afganastan last year at this time."

517925,Guest,2002-03-26 20:22:00,0,"OK - Iv'e heard enough. I enjoy a cold one as much as the next guy but I come to this site to share info on fishing Canada. Those of you doing a case or a bottle a day are missing most of what I love about the great north country...in addition to the fantastic fishing.Quiet, solitude, loons caling and sitting on the dock at night with a million stars blazing and being able to take it all in, something you could never do after a case. If a case a day is your bag, fine, but is the site the place?"

517915,Thumper,2002-03-27 09:58:00,133,"The ""lumber thing"" has been going on for fifty years. The playing field has changed as well because lots of ""Canadian"" lumber companies are multinationals. It is sad to see one industry towns shut down but change is what we are all about in being human. It will eventually get settled as these things do. Our Liberals have poor representation in the areas most effected by this. Eastern Canada is exempt. Hey wait a minute those guys are all liberal.....Hmmmmmmmm"
517916,Wawajake,2002-03-27 11:01:00,413,"That would be alright if the playing field was level and the rules were based on the free trade agreement, but US lobbiest know that bureacracy to chase down courts via WTO or free trade agreement is a year or more ! , so by then, even if they lose, the industry is shutdown in Canada and reopened and re established in US. They do this every three years and normally Canada industry decides to rollover and come to an agreement even if it is by US rules!! not free trade rules. This time Canada figured US with republican government would abide by free trade vision and purpose , but lobbiests basically falsified and twisted drastically the facts. Not what one would expect from friends , but the almighty buck causes a lobbiest and industry to lose all morals. Whats funny is now US wants to start free trade talks and deals with Central America countries !! Are they nuts, those countries should just look at how Canada gets screwed by the elephant and back away running !!! This could snow ball into a lot of countries deciding to buy local (Some European countries are starting already with retalitory tarrifs on US produced stuff because of steel trade issues. The working man in Canada and others might join band wagon and buy local despite our Governments advice. Sorry for rant but the full story is not being heard and that guy in the small town might be fishing for food from now on not recreation and for years to come!jake"
517917,Thumper,2002-03-30 07:24:00,133,"There was an interesting article in Thunder Bays paper today on this issue of lumber. Very informative. Some of the points....It has all to do with Politics and Lumber producing states who are Republican and Bush needs them reelected in November this year. Bush is also pushing for world free trade with the Feds there being able to ""fast track"" countries. This is very scary or it should be. It also gave some suggestions on how to solve this dilemma.....Eventually it will be in the courts like the last two times and we will be vindicated but....Canada has to become more like the Europeans. The steel thing is an example. We should follow their example and target industries in politically unstable states when our industries are threatened that way we are being more like them and bringing shoes to a ball game instead of skates......Get a better negotiator....Pettigrew is too soft......The most important one is .....Broaden our economis base with more customers and industries ...USA accounts for 85% of our business exports..... Business 101 says that you are at the mercy of your customer if you only have one."

517906,Guest,2002-03-23 14:11:00,0,I'm probably going to go back to school and get retrained at the college here. I may take Law and Security and then go on to be a Police Officer or a Border Guard like other good friends that I have. No problem getting in. They say its a nice job and you meet all kinds of nice people. There just a little travelling involved.
517907,Red Ruffandsore,2002-03-23 17:13:00,81,Lordy Lordy Lordy I can see it now. Canadian Guy turning Americans back at the border because they didn't bring enough beerStay off the pipe...and don't forget to wipe.Red

517910,Guest,2002-03-24 06:50:00,0,"Retraining would be a good idea, but being a border guard is like working in the armpit of the world, especially for someone with your obvious skills. Maybe you should aim a little higher, now that you say you have actual freinds, political science would be a good major, then you could travel a little to Ottuwa and really put your talents to work, EH?"

517913,Wawajake,2002-03-26 06:20:00,413,"I am going to jump in now that we got on topic of lumber and knowing that much of the audience on this site has seen the great white north and appreciate the magnitude of our forests. This is very serious stuff that the US government and ""Montana"" and other lumber lobbiest are pulling on Canada. I can only hope that a few of you American readers will spread the word that , thats not free trade ! We are not asking for any favours here , and we know that if we bring this to the WTO and trade courts, we will win but this has been dragged out be the US lobby for many months now and the courts will not hear it for another 12 months or more . This will be 100,000 jobs or more and that means the Canadian government will have to focus on helping those communities and not on the environmental things we all care about too.Please remind your influential friends : Canada has tons more trees tons more land and very little of it is private owned land so of course our ""stumpage "" is going to cost less than US .But also remember that the average size of the trees logged is smaller in Canada and we deal with a season and climate that costs more to access the logs , make the logging roads etc.(Canada has basically three natural resources, rocks, trees and water and we got tons of all three ) So in the end it has been proven that our logging is fairly traded, however the ""protectionest"" attitude of a few of your industry lobbiests has turned the tables and pulled the rug out from under your ""friend"" to the north. I guess we are good enough to trade with when lobbiests need our oil, gas , and water (and hydro electricity for california)Any way I ranted enough, Canada can thank our Prime MInister Brian Mulrooney for signing off a free trade deal that is a one way trip to nowhere now. Any way just hoping a few of you US fishing friends can appreciate the real picture and the next dreadfull year we are looking at in that industry and massive impact on our country.thanksjake"
517918,Guest,2002-03-26 10:42:00,0,"Not to brag but 8 of us averaged 28 bottles per day for 6 days, drank 3 bottles of wiskey, 1 bottle of rum and 1 bottle of vodka. This was all confirmed by the resort owner and he still talks about it. The camp was Cygnet Lake up by Minaki. Some good old boys from Wisconsin tried to break the record and ended up giving back their shore lunch on the front grass by the 3rd day. Those Wisconsin boys are funny that way."

517920,Red Ruffandsore,2002-03-26 16:48:00,81,"28 beers a day avg means that you were drinking on the lake and well over the legal limit...that is if we buy your story.

I have spent lots of time in Canada and played ball with many Canadians through the years, and I'm happy to say that ""Canadian Guy"" is the is one of a select few who has given me a bad impression of Canadians. The rest of you Canadians are great people and gracious hosts. I have been from Toronto to Saaskatoon and met many great people. I'm sure ""Canadian Guy"" is probably only half the bad #$*! he seems and I might even be able get along with him, if he would lighten up. Not all Americans are drunken, fish poaching, S.O.B.S."

517902,Guest,2002-03-22 19:25:00,0,thanks for asking about work guys....the softwood lumber tarriff just came in at 29% which means that we will not see work in the near future and your feds just added $2000 to the average cost of an American house. I guess most Americans don't know what softwood lumber is and where it come from. I guess I could always get a job at one of the outfitters guiding.......you never know who you might run in to. You Americans are so sensitive .........
517911,Red Ruffandsore,2002-03-22 19:41:00,81,Hmmmmmmmmmmm maybe now we can keep some trees in the forest for a while. Why is it that I'm thinking softwood lumber exports to the U.S. are not significantly hurt for very long? Stay off the pipe...and don't forget to wipe.Red

517888,Guest,2002-03-06 13:29:00,0,Well guys and gals I was almost to embarrassed to admit this but what the heck. I have been going on 5 day fly-in fishing trips for years on remote lakes of course and on average are party brings in 3 cases a piece and a bottle of whiskey for cleaning fish helps with the bugs lol and a bottle of good vodka for the morning bloody mary or screwdriver on those tuffer mornings. Like i said this is once a year but the partying doesen't really start until after dinner at the cabin. After all i would like to keep coming back year after year to do it all over again. Drinking to many in the boat just dosen't make to much sence.

In the u.s. side you can have a beer even when under power, as long as you don't blow over 1.0%.In canada you must have a head on board 0 alcohol for driver of boat ,unless you are anchored and staying the nite, I think it's still a democracy over here but mite not be for long."

517894,Red Ruffandsore,2002-03-09 21:50:00,81,">Just curious.......How much Beer do you bring for an average >...say five day trip fishing?I go north of Superior every year with a group of 12 -16 for a week. We bring 3 cases (24) per man and a few bottles of the Captain for good measure. No beer on the water...no drunks driving the boat. Most have a few at lunch, but when the boats are tied up for the night, the opener gets a good workout. Tis a shame to waste a trip on a binge but one night crossing the line is cool. It is amazing how a dozen beers at the camp is nothing compared to a dozen beers on your own couch. Y'all be safe on the water and look out for the guys who had one too many. Funny stories are great to tell around the fire, but each one ain't that far away from being a sad story.Red Ruffandsore,Mississauga, Ontario, Canada"
517895,Pooch,2002-03-12 06:39:00,4619,Our guys fall in the couple cans a day group. It's always interesting to watch other folks get off of the plane with more hooch than food. No way some of these guys remember the trip! They look like dog crap all week but don't seem to cause a problem in the camp. Actually better bunch to joke around with than some of the really straight laced types. If everyone was the same it would be a boring world.Pooch
517896,IaCraig,2002-03-12 16:36:00,434,"We always buy a case per person for the week, we probably use up 6+ bottles for beer batter, and we always bring some home. Normally I like my beer, but when I am in Canada I seem to be busy the whole time and usually only have a couple at bedtime. Now, meet me in my local pub some Friday night in the winter when I am bored, and I'll kill a few thousand brain with you."
517897,Guest,2002-03-12 16:56:00,0,We all are nuts when we are young!We were about age 24 many years ago.We went to Quebec on a fly in.Ten guys 40 cases of beer.We rented the plane to bring in the beer.Looking back I think that was stupid.
517877,Guest,2002-03-05 17:53:00,0,Just curious.......How much Beer do you bring for an average ...say five day trip fishing?
517878,Guest,2002-03-05 19:14:00,0,"We bring none from the States. Why would you? Canadian Beer is much better than US fizz. Sure, it cost more but how often can you drink a great Canadian beer at home? We factor that in as the cost of going fishing in Canada. Shoot, rather skimp on quality of food... anyways I can always get a Bud @ homeSuds for thought...."
517879,lobo1,2002-03-05 19:18:00,734,"..... and if you have to have Bud - the Canadian version is darn good !The amount would be a personal preferance and have to fit into any weight restrictions - should they apply.We have two weeks of bodily abuse each year - one in Nov (deer camp) and one in May/Jun (fish camp). Per boat (two men)we probably consume 6-8 per day while on the water/ shore lunch etc, we generally fish for 12 hours or so. When we return we consume probably double that. This is too much for most and not enough for some. The main thing is - you can't run down to the corner store for more - we always take a little extra and bring back whatever we don't use.I believe that the PC term for what we do is binge drinking - but it's our vacation and that's what we do; we're safe about it and within most laws most of the time. We do not become intoxicated on the water - EVER.lobo"
517880,Guest,2002-03-05 19:45:00,0,"I like my beer as well as the next guy (enjoying a cold one right now)When I fly in for a week of outpost fishing I take NO BEER. I want to fish and drink in the whole northwoods experience without the alcohol. Also I think there is a safety factor. Let me tell you - nothing ever tastes better than that first ice cold beer when you get back to Kenora, Red Lake or whatever town you flew in from!!"
517881,lobo1,2002-03-05 20:12:00,734,"Smally,I see your point of view here and it's a good one. What some people forget when they go (especially when they go REALLY remote) is that they ARE part of the food chain and bad shi$ can and does happen.Nothing better than a spring day way up north - about 70 degrees F sunny - short sleeves - no bugs - high noon - kickin back watching the eagles soar. A couple fish to boot adds........lobo"
517883,outdoor fanatic,2002-03-05 20:13:00,90,"None. I drink when I drink, but when I fish, it's all about the fish. It could also have something to do with the fact that I've just about killed my liver when I was in the military. Maybe I'm just getting older....I also have a young son who is starting to fish with me and I'm trying to set an example. I do however like to help out the guy who runs the fly-in camp I go to every year and will often but 1 case from him for when we're done fishing. But, since it costs $38 a case, I only get one. But it is Canadian beer and it can't be beat"
517884,Guest,2002-03-06 08:55:00,0,"How hot is the weather? Are the fish biting? How many hours per day am I in the boat? What time do we start cracking beers...9:00 AM, Noon, 2:00 PM? Just kidding.Really, these are factors most of the time; but we average about 6-8, sometimes 10 beers per guy per day we're there. We take it all in as there is no place to get beer once at the lodge (on a remote island). This year, we're planning 10-12 cases for 4 guys for 7-days. We ran out on Thursday last year....2-days before we left. We drank the camp dry....wine, beer, everything. That'll never happen again. For us, the superior beer available in Canada is part of the experience, and we indulge ourselves as you can see. We do give our livers a rest when we return home though...at least a week dry out."
517885,DarrenB,2002-03-06 09:47:00,28,"My buddy and I have been bringing 1 case up to Canada every spring for the last few years, and it has suited us fine in 1 week of fishing. One year we did not even finish it. Lots of it depends on the weather. Clipping across a lake in early June with the rain, cold wind in your face and low 50 degree temps it isn't exactly conducive to cold beer drinking for us. Especially in the morning. It's because of this that we are coffee fiends, and value our thermoses much more than our bottle openers. I'll usually drink maybe 2 all day. One with lunch and one a bit later in the evening watching the sun go down. I wouldn't want to get loaded out on a boat during my vacation anyways. We only get a week every year, I'd hate to waste a minute of it."
517886,NateW,2002-03-06 11:19:00,96,"Everybody gets at least one case of the favorite""flavor"" then most the guys will split a case too...so that's a case and a half per guy. He bring one case of US beer in for beer batter. Why waste the good stuff? We also have a hnbit of making a couple ""Poorman's Bloody Mary's"" with our breakfast a couple times a week. Beer is only consumed in the cabin. We have coolers of pop and water in the boat for when we get thirsty during the day. But we'll still manage to kill a case and a half per guy in six days. Man, I can almost taste it now......"
517882,Guest,2002-03-06 11:49:00,0,"My Dad and I go to Canada for 2 weeks every year in Sept. and we buy a case of Labatt Blue and a bottle of JD. I drink the beer and my Dad drinks the JD mixed with coca cola. We DO NOT drink while we fish. We fish sun-up to sun-down and when we get back to the cabin I will have 1 or 2 beers and my Dad will have one JD and coke during our supper. Then it's off to bed and do it all over again the next day with NO hangover. When we go to Canada to fish, we fish. We can do all the drinking we want at home, we don't have to drive 800 miles to get drunk."
