518068,Reels,2002-03-10 19:41:00,2876,"Well as for fishing, the fish move with the season, so best bet is to spend some time at paradise and suck a couple of cold ones down, listen, and they will be more than willing to share the current pattern.Good luck! great place to own a cabin!<{{}}><"
518069,iamwalleye1,2002-03-11 08:10:00,1589,I have to second reels on this one! Just ask some of the guts at paradise or the marina!
518070,Guest,2002-03-12 01:13:00,0,"You'll be glad that you purchased a part of God's country !My questions to you are:What lake exactly are you on ? If not on a lake, what part of the river are you on ? Have you ever stayed in the area before you purchased this cabin ? Good FishenRob"
518071,Guest,2002-03-12 17:18:00,0,"The cabin is on Pistol lake. I have never fished or been north of Kenora before. All my fishing has been east (Indian Lake Chain north of Vermillion) and southeast (Hillock, Veronica, Highwind and Dryberry Lakes) of Kenora. My first visit to the Minaki area sold me. My intention is to eventually retire here so that work will no longer interfere with fishing. I do a lot of back bush ATV'ing around Dryberry Lake and hope I can find an abundance of trails and old logging roads in the Minaki area but for now, I'm itching with anticipation for opening day.Thanks for taking an interest, any info is appreciated."

518073,Guest,2002-04-02 22:32:00,0,saw you've been on the indian chain near vermillion.......was wondering if you had any musky suggestions for that chain...... I'll trade ya some of my winnipeg river spots!slimetime
518074,Guest,2002-04-03 20:07:00,0,"slimetimeBest spot I can recommend is the east shore of Alexandria right in front of the cabins starting at the north end and working south. Also had a bit of luck in late August at the far west end of Alexandria where it narrows towards the falls but it is spotty. I have never managed to haul bigger than 40"" out of this lake but there are sure lots of them (and no pike)Good luckLe pic"
