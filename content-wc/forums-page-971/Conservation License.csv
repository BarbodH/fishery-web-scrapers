518680,fishcop,2002-04-04 07:44:00,11,"Sorry to dissapoint you guys, but us fishcops are not that sophisticated. As for possesion related to shorelunch, our methods are simply asking the questions, and observing anglers. Generally we are on a given body of water for the day (especially larger bodies of water), and often run into the same anglers several times in diferent areas (you guys do like to move around). I know the majority of anglers choose to abide by the rules, and most on this post don't subscribe to fish hog methods, so this question of limits should be a mute point right?? In most Canadian lakes, anglers catch and release far more than their limits, so when possed with the question of which licence to buy, go conservation , 4 fish per person is more than sufficient for shore lunch (I think!), and most of you don't bring fish home"
518683,Guest,2002-04-04 09:24:00,0,The fish you consume at shore lunch count against your daily limit.
518669,Brian,2002-03-29 14:19:00,140,"I will be going on my first Canadian fishing trip this year. The place where we are going includes a conservation license. I know the conservation license has a lower number of fish you can bring back and that is fine. I was wondering though, how does is work for shore lunches and if you want to keep one for dinner? Are those fish part of the total you are allowed to keep for the week or are they just part of a daily limit? This is probably a dumb question but just looking for some clarification.ThanksBrian"
518670,Trophymuskie,2002-03-29 14:38:00,254,"A conservation license lets you have half the limit. That means once you have eaten the fish it can be replaced with another one, you just cannot have 1 more in your posession saying you will eat one for lunch.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com"
518671,Guest,2002-03-29 15:23:00,0,"I understand it that it gives you half your daily limit, if a regular license is 4 for a daily limit your allowed 2.If you eat those 2 your not allowed to catch and keep anymore until the next day."
518672,chrism,2002-03-29 16:32:00,429,"In Manitoba, the conservation license is as stated in the other posts, but in some waters or 'zones', you can have either less than half the limit, or you can have more than half - for example, the provincial limit is 6 walleye with a slot, a conservation licence will allow you to keep 4 in those waters.There are a lot of waters, especially in the south east, that classify all waters as conservation waters, and the limit is 4 with a slot , regardless of what type of license you have - so if that is the only water you are going to fish, then it is a waste of $$ to buy anything but a conservation license.Bottom line, You have to read the book and see how your water is affected - there are a lot of lakes and a lot of specific regulations...It is a bit of a pain, but it is something you have to do!As for the lunch thing, your lunch fish in possesion counts towards your limit, until they are eaten - then you can go and catch more to get you up to the limit.Hope this helps!"
518673,bigfish1965,2002-03-29 19:01:00,3210,"The conservation license is as described, but there is one correction. If you eat a shore lunch, the fish you caught that you ate are included in your daily limit. Since daily limit is also your possession limit, if you had a shore lunch the last day, it would diminish the number you could take home. Now this is following the law to the letter. I always wondered how they would catch you on this infraction."
518674,chrism,2002-03-30 00:00:00,429,Bigfish - you may be correct on that - I am going to check up on it for my own safety!Here is a link for those coming to manitoba this year - www.gov.mb.ca/natres/fish/guide/what.htmlGood luck and Great fishing!cm

518675,Guest,2002-03-30 15:13:00,0,"You are correct Bigfish. Shore lunch is part of your daily possession limit. As to enforcemnet, our officers do have ways to enforce this should they feel that there is a problem.Carl WallManitoba ConservationFihseries Branch"
518676,Guest,2002-03-30 23:28:00,0,"Ok, Carl, how do the enforcement officers know what you have eaten and if the daily limit was exceeded? Stool samples?"
518677,tracker,2002-03-31 07:33:00,91,"Well the rumour is they take your fishing party, put them in seperate rooms and bribe them with free canadian beer. You know damb well one of your buddies are going to break down. Who could resist the offering of an ice cold Blue!!!!"
