I've never used the hot n tots before but it seems to me that I should be picking some up, if I can find the ones with the metal lips. Say, have you ever fished any other parts of the Winnipeg river other than pine falls?I can't remember where you said you were from. I'm guessing you have lots of good fishing nearby your place."

516191,River_eye,2002-01-09 21:17:00,1486,"About the size regulations on Lac du Bonnet. We have been subject to the same walleye length regulations right up to the Ontario border where I fish. Obviously, their are more fish in such remote areas so the effects of these limits have been more drastic. We are all noticing more Walleyes in the 16"" - 19"" range which is nice, although you can't keep them. The under 15"" legal walleyes are a little harder to come by now. It just goes to show that these limits are making a difference, and hopefully these bigger walleyes are laying lots of eggs.Look for new regulations in the angling guide this spring for these areas. It was proposed to raise the length limit by a minimum of an inch or two. I believe that the last couple of years were somwhat of an observation period."
