515479,DaveIN,2001-12-07 09:32:00,191,I have not stayed at Halleys camps but I do stay at a campground not far from there and there are usually some of Halleys boats fishing the same water that we do. Many of their boats fish the river in that area.The river fishing in that area is just great. Large walleye and lots of them.
515480,Guest,2001-12-07 12:16:00,0,"Our group has been up there two years, both of which have been great fishing. Its a nice camp run by some very nice people. It is traditionally booked pretty full (very high return rate).We have been at the Caribou Falls drive in camp but have fished over much of the western 2/3rds of the lake. The biggest walleyes have been in the 29-30"" range and we have cauht numerous fish over 26"".One of our party got a 44"" Pike last year and my son a 41"" pike. There are lots of Pike in this water and a decent population of Smallmouth.Good luck,PaulThey have a web site at:http://www.halleyscamps.com/"
515481,Guest,2001-12-15 20:51:00,0,"thanks for the reply hope to be up there in june,do you drive your own boat in or rent one ,im thinking of driving my in.it sure sounds like a nice place and good fishing ."
515482,Guest,2001-12-17 11:54:00,0,"I take my boat and the other guys use the resort boats. The resort boats are nice, as I recall they are 16' lunds with 40HP four stroke motors. Live wells etc. They do not have trolling motors or depth finders so you would need to take those. As I mentioned we stayed at the Caribou Falls camp which is the drive in. The others are boat in but they would probably run you back there in one of their boats. It's not a bad boat ride from Caribou Falls to the other camps but is probably a good 15 miles or so.Paul"
515483,Guest,2001-12-18 22:19:00,0,HAS ANYONE EVER ICEFISHED AT HALLEYS? WOULD LIKE TO TRY IT.I FISH IN THE SUMMER AT SEPARATION LAKE UP RIVER.LOTS OF BIG PIKE AND EYES.THANKS FOR THE INFO
515485,Guest,2001-12-26 17:49:00,0,"are the roads good up there ,and if the weather is bad how ruff will it be"
515486,Guest,2002-01-02 13:59:00,0,"The last 35-40 milesof road, from Minaki to the camp, was a non paved road until this year. They have hard surfaced about 3/4ths of it so it is a decent drive. Because of the lay of the lake, long and relatively narrow stretches, we have really not had much rough water on the lake. If you got a good East/West wind it could get rough but we have not had a problem.Paul"
515484,eyewitness,2002-01-03 15:06:00,680,Ditto. it looks like it would be a great place to pull in your portables by sled. Sure hope someone has some insight out there....
