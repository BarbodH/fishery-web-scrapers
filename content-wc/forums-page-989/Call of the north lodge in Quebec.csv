515866,Jersey John,2001-12-27 19:46:00,202,I was wondering if anyone has ever gone here and how the fishing was. I am planning on a summer vacation with the family for 4th of July week. How is the fishing during that time of year and where should I look for pike and walleye during this time. Thanks to all who answer. JJ

515868,Steve,2002-01-01 13:50:00,259,"In July in Quebec you have to fish the weed beds just like you will do for Northern Pike, the walleyes are feeding hard on perch at that time so any good perch look alike plug will do the job. I work in at a fishing lodge in Quebec check it out at http://www.quebec-outfitters.net Have a good trip in our beautifull province[email protected]"
