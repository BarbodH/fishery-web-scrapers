515880,Guest,2001-12-28 16:55:00,0,What are the stipulations on allowing someone with a DWI into the country? Is it just a judgement call from the official? What needs to be done if someone has a DWI and plans to enter next summer? Thanks for the help.

It will make a difference depending on how old the charge is. If more than 10 years it will be easy to show no more offences. Request the ""rehab forms"" from that office. You may have to pay the $200 CA processing fee. Get started today on it and you, and others in the same situation, may find it easy to do. Do not let it spoil you trip. Have agreat time."
