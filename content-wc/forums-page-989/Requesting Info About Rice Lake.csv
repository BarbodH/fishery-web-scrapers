One member of our ""family"" has suggested that we go to Rice Lake just east of Toronto for our summer of 2002 trip (July 2002.) We normally travel much further north (Senneterre, Quebec; Lac Seul, Ontario; etc.) for our annual trip. Can anyone give us advice regarding whether Rice Lake would be a good choice for our group? We fish for walleyes during the day and take turns having evening dinners (fish frys) at each of our members cottages in the evenings. Any suggestions about whether or not Rice Lake is a good choice for us, and, if so, suggestions about accomodations will be greatly appreciated.jj"
