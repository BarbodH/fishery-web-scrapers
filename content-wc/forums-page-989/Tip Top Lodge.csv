515908,Guest,2001-12-29 15:44:00,0,Does anyone out there know what happened to Tip Top Lodge on Sanford lake north of Atikokan? We used to catch huge lake trout & walleyes out of there. But that was a long time ago. I would really appreciate some information about what is going on with that area. I used to fish the area in the 60's & 70's.
