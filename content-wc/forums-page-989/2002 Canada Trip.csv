515567,BD,2001-12-14 15:58:00,739,"If you would like to try Lake of the Woods I would recomend Lake of the Woods Houseboats out of Reed Narrows. Our group has been going there the second week of June for years. It is located 3 miles north of Sioux Narrows on Long Bay. You can take the houseboat out a couple of hours from the landing and be into great walleye, crapie and northern fishing. The first week in June the lakers may still be up and you might get into some nice action with them. With the houseboats you have your ""resort"" right there where the fishing action is. Just tow your fishing boats along behind, tie the houseboat up to an island, and go fishing. No long ride back at the end of the day just at the end of the week.A drive to resort a little farther up that I can recomend is Press Lake Camp (near Ignace). Press Lake is part of the English River system. The camp buildings are the only structures on the 9000 acre lake."
515568,Guest,2001-12-19 15:10:00,0,"I have personally fished every lake you have discussed. My personal preference is LOW due to the variety of fish available, and it's easier on the first timer. By all means take out a ""good"" guide the first day or two if one is available. When doing so be sure that you find out beforehand what the guide includes for his cost. Be aware that you will not be experiencing very much of a wilderness fishing trip as most or many of the islands have cabins or resorts on them. If a spot gets a hot bite, it seems that everyone finds out about it, the guides do talk to eachother too. Have fun, keep an open mind and let us know how you did. By the way, if someone in your group has had a DWI, don't let them drive their vehical as they do a license check on all vehicals at the border crossings and the person that had the DWI will not be permitted to enter canada.Good luck,Jawjerker"
515569,Dave,2001-12-25 21:39:00,258,If you plan on making this the trip of a lifetime check out TOETEM RESORTS WEBSITE. It is a top notch facility with top guides and equipment and they have three resorts on Lake of the Woods to chose from
515570,Atomic Eye,2001-12-26 16:12:00,854,"Mo'Fisherman,Check this site out and read their newsbulletin comments of catching 1,000 Eyes in a week and Northerns to 51"". Anyone else had experiene with them?www.loonhaunt.comAtomic Eye of New Mexico"
515571,Guest,2001-12-26 20:33:00,0,"Hi, looking for a experience in fishing Canada ck out www.bighookcamps.com. This is a drive to Red Lake, Ontario and a 180fly in north west from there. It is fantastic area and fishing. You dont see other boats for the week. Steve has about 6 different lakes to fly you into and they are remote. I stay at Central Lake where he and his family stay also for the summer. Wonderful people and they guide also. Ck it out ok and if you go tell them cook from Chicago sent you. thanks"
515572,Guest,2001-12-29 19:00:00,0,"MoFisherman, My group has been going to Lake of the Woods for 30 yrs. If you are an experienced fisherman but still want to use a guide I would suggest either Wiley Point Resort (remote but nice) or Totem Lodge.They have excellent guides and services at both resorts. Lake of the Woods is a great body of water as you may know already, with all species of fish that most fly-in lakes won't have. you can fish for walleye, SM bass, Northern Pike, Muskie,Crappie & Lake Trout. Most Fly-in lakes only offer walleye & pike fishing, maybe lake Trout.Good luck !!"
515573,Guest,2002-01-04 11:27:00,0,"I would be careful of Eagle Lake. Went there a few years ago and had trouble hooking into walleyes on a consistent basis. Some of the portage lakes were OK (Crabclaw). I heard the musky fisherman getting a lot of follows by big fish, but not many takers. We fished during mid July."
515574,Guest,2002-01-04 20:13:00,0,":9 Totem resort was fantastic. For $1500 we had everything included. The food was great, service was top notch and the staff was great. It's a bit of money, but if you are the type than wants to be pampered, it is the way to go."
515575,Walli,2002-01-04 21:22:00,63,Ever try Rainy Lake great all around fishing and they hold the Canadian Bass Championship there in July-I do have a 3 bedroom cabin for rent for 500/week [email protected]
515576,bellbuoy,2002-01-05 04:07:00,490,"Look at http://www.witchbay.com. It is an American Plan camp plus the guiding is included, no extra $.I was there in '98, '99, and again in '01. It is by far the best camp I've been to. I might also add that this camp is about 25 miles north of Sioux Narrows. We would see Totem Resorts guide boats coming from Sioux Narrows to that area on almost a daily basis. A 50 mile daily boat trip is not one I would relish. Bellbuoy"
515557,Guest,2001-12-05 12:46:00,0,"Am planning a trip next June to Canada. Am considering Lake of the Woods or Eagle Lake due to their relative ease in accessing via paved road. However, am concerned about the numbers and quality of fish we might catch at one of these lakes versus a outpost (fly-in). Can anyone provide feedback on their recent fishing experiences at these lakes? We will be fishing mostly for walleyes the first week of June and plan to use a guide. Also, am looking into accomodations at Melines Resort, Totems Resort or North Shore Lodge. If anyone has feedback on these it would be appreciated.Thanks"
515558,Guest,2001-12-06 11:09:00,0,"I have not fished Eagle or LOTW but have fished just up the road at Lac Seul. From what I have read on this board over and over again, size and numbers should not be a concern on either of these lakes!"
515559,MN_Moose,2001-12-08 20:29:00,965,"Fished LOW passed summer out of Crawfords Camp right at bridge of Sioux Narrows. We did pretty well for 'eyes. We started out going 4-5 miles and caught mostly 15-18"" fish. Later in the week we were going 17 miles out and did very well.I have never stayed at Totem/(Yellow Bird, Willey Pt) but have been near them every year I have gone to Canada. Two things. 1) Bring your check book 2) Just because someone is hired on to be a guide for a day does not make them an expert (or even mediocre) fisherman. Did I mention bring your checkbook? Be wise, I know you Missouri guys, Show Me!As far as a fly in. It is mostly personel preferance. The boats may be un-comfortable. The accomidations difficult. The size of fish might be constricted because of population. My suggestion would be to go to a smallish lake. Easy to drive to. Visit with as many fisherman at the fish cleaning house a possible. Enjoy the time in Canada, and don't worry too much about catching the biggest fish in the province or country.MN_Moose"
515560,Walleye Wizard,2001-12-10 05:43:00,9,"Why not come up to Manitoba.We have a lake called Crowduck that is unbelievalbe. It is a catch and release lake only but if you want many big walleye try it out.There have been many posts in this forum about Crowduck in the past.If you want more info email me [email protected]. I am not connected with them. Make it a real adventure. Have them give you a boat ride across a lake, a short 4x4 ride, and for $150 a day a boat you can use where it is impossible not to catch fish. There is a beautiful camp there if you want to stay there too. If you are interested in Eagle Lake (Vermillion Bay, Ont) people go there for Musky fishing. There are better walleye lakes than Eagle Lake.PaulPaul"
515561,Guest,2001-12-10 10:11:00,0,"Thanks for the feedback. Having reviewed multiple messages on the this board regarding recent fishing experiences, I believe we are going to book a trip to Andersons Lodge and fish Lac Seul plus some surrounding lakes. A couple additional hours on the drive time but it sure sounds like it would be worth it. MN_Moose - i think your right about Totem Resorts. It certainly appears to have nice accomodations (5 star), but likely a little too commercialized for us ""show me"" boys.Nate W - any thoughts on Lac Seul? We tried to get lodging at the Silver Water Wheel but he was pretty well booked up...for the entire year!! He recommended we call Andersons Lodge. They've also gotten some good reviews on this message board. Thanks again for the tips. Our group can hardly wait to come visit and practice the conservation program (absent the daily shore lunches of course!)"
515563,Guest,2001-12-10 17:55:00,0,"Dear MoFishermen, if you are interested in Eagle Lake, please check-out our websites: www.duenorth.net/eaglelakesportsmenslodge or www.heartland.on.ca/sportsmenOur camp is located on the West Arm of Eagle Lake. The west arm offers waters that are well protected were you can fish in any weather conditions without worrying about high wind/waves. We have excellent Walleye fishing, that time of year the majority of the fishing is done right around the corner from the camp. The lake offers large and small Walleye. Lake Trout fishing is located on the West Arm of Eagle. The lake also offers Lake Trout, Muskie, Northern Pike, Small Mouth Bass, Perch and Whitefish.Thank you for your interest in Eagle Lake and should you have any questions or wish to make a reservation, please feel free to contact us at your convenience."
515562,MN_Moose,2001-12-11 07:01:00,965,"I know rite where your talking. I think you can't make a better choice. If Anderson's is full you might try Donnelly's (sp) on Pickeral Arm of Lake Minnitaki. There are also two or threeothers on Pckeral Arm which is 10 miles(max.) south of Anderson's. Pickeral Arm is very easy to navigate. All the fishing you could ever need within 5 -6 miles. Even Minnitaki is esay to find. At any location you might consider a day trip to Lac Seul. If you are that close, you'll kick yourself a couple years later if you don't.Good Luck"
515564,bphunger,2001-12-11 08:30:00,28,"It is worth a look at the web site www.whitefishbaycamp.com No dissapointments there with service, fish (all species including Lake trout) and the price. Have a great trip where ever you pick."
515565,PWaldow123,2001-12-13 19:02:00,198,"Mofisherman,If you change your mind and try LOW www.whitefishbaycamp.com cannot be beat as far as lodging and hospitality goes. I have never fished the Eagle lake area but have never found any reason to go any farther than LOW. Give them a try, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. If you decide to give them a try e-mail me and I can give you several starting points.Paul"
515566,Guest,2001-12-14 11:42:00,0,"Mo,We have a great time at Lac Seul. The resort whee we stay is Scout Lake Resort. The resort is on Scout Lake but is connected to Lac Seul thryu a shirt channel. You'll hear people talk about how rough Lac Seul can get--often times forcing you off the lake. With Scout Lake Resort being on a smaller lake, you can still fish on nasty days.www.fishlacseul.com --Tell Liz you talked to Nate from Iowa (The supposedly Psycho one!)The camp is adequate. If you' don't need five-star lodging you'll be fine here. The cabin can be a little rough, but everything works, it doesn't smell, the roof doesn't leak and the windows keep the mosquitos out. We were more than comfortable. Besides, you shouldn't need a cabing for anything more than sleeping anyway, right?I must confess this will be only our second trip there, our first was 2000. We thought the fishing was fantastic, but understand it was even better last year--the year we didn't go!e-mail me if you want to know more: [email protected] Good Luck!"
