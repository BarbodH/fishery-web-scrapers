515490,Roadhog,2001-12-04 10:18:00,17,I'm thinking about a trip to Lac Seul in late July or early August.Has anyone fished out of Williams Lake Lodge or Mahwka Lodge? Please give me an honest assessment. Thanks.
515491,Jigger1,2001-12-05 08:58:00,234,"Just my advise, but check out Silver Water Wheel Lodge. www.sww-lodge.com I don't know that they get any better than this."
515492,exnj,2001-12-07 07:22:00,103,"Jigger,I looked at the website based on your recommendation. It looks fantastic. How many times have you been there, what time of the summer is best and is it as good as it looks? Maybe we'll head up there in July. Thanks, Lou"
515493,Guest,2001-12-10 11:03:00,0,"RoadHog,I also was interested in Lac Seul and checked out the web site for Silver Water Wheel - even talked to the owner, Mike. He was extremely helpful in answering questions and seemed nice. Unfortunately, he was booked most of the summer and could not accomodate the dates we were looking for (speaks highly of his facilities/service). I took his recommendation and called Andersons Lodge (www.andersonslodge.com) They are on Lake Abram which is about 10 minutes or so from Lac Seul. Seems like a nice place. We'll likely stay with them in June.MoFisherman"
515494,Jigger1,2001-12-10 15:52:00,234,"Lou, I simply copied a post I had placed on an earlier string of comments regarding my success at Silver Water Wheel Lodge. Please disregard anything that's redundant.I can't speak for any other part of the lake, but in my book the central part of Lac Seul can't be beat. In my 8.5 days of fishing over the last two years I've personally landed 23 walleyes over 24"" including 4-27's, 2-28's, and one 29"". I've caught a total of 59 walleyes over the slot and no idea how many under 18"", but I can assure you it's a ton. The boat totals are 40 over 24"" and a total of 143 over the slot.We fish out of Silver Water Wheel Lodge (www.sww-lodge.com) which is located 42 miles north of Dryden. The last 30 miles are on a somewhat rough dirt road, but it's worth the trip. This place is first class all the way around. A spectacular owner in Mike Willems, fantastic guides who are fishing students, ultra clean cabins, incredible shore lunches, 18' Lund Pro V boats and more. I'm here to tell you that you'll be hard pressed to find anything better!Your only problem will be to find an opening. If I'm not mistaken the entire 2002 season is in the bag, however don't take my word for it, give Mike a call it will be worth the call.Good luck on your hunt!"
515495,Roadhog,2001-12-13 09:20:00,17,My question still stands. Any comments on the 2 lodges I mentioned? Thanks for the lead on Silver Water Wheel.
515496,Guest,2001-12-13 10:41:00,0,"Roadhog, I organize a trip every year to Lac Suel for a group of at least 12. Last year 16 and I have to keep everyone happy. First of all if you never fished for walleye on Lac Suel you are missing the boat. I have stayed 1 year at Silver Water Wheel [ old owner ] 5 years at Makwa Lodge. We fish the second week of June. At that time of the year fishing is right out our front door, it would be a 30 to 40 min boat ride from SWW . I see there boats on our end of the lake every day , there guides are very predictable. Makwa offers both Am. Plan and Housekeeping. The Guides worked at SWW for many years, they are natives and really know the lay of land. Let me know what you are looking for ?? I can tell you this after fishing Canada for 20 years I will not be going anywhere else. I have stopped at Andersons nice place but not on Lac Suel. The only time I head toward SWW is to fish the rapids / waterfall for northern. NOTE: This may sound selfish but I hoped no one knew of MAKWA LODGE !!!!!!"
515497,Jigger1,2001-12-13 17:15:00,234,"Fred,You must have stayed at SWW before Mike bought the place. The 1999 season was the first one under his leadership. He has recruited a spectacular group of guides and Mike is a fish biologist himself. With each passing year they're getting better and better. We're locked down on the last couple days of June first couple days of July. In regards to the falls I've only fished there once, however within site of the lodge I've caught several walleyes from 26 to 28 inches. While we've made occasional runs up to the north shore, over 80% of the fishing has been done within 10-20 minutes of camp. These boys know where to find fish. They're equipped with Lund Pro V's powered by 80 HP Yamaha's so you can cover some water in a hurry. Sounds like you've got a great thing going at Makwa and I agree I'm stuck on Lac Seul. By the way, where is Makwa lodge located?Jigger1"
515498,Guest,2001-12-19 13:36:00,0,"Jigger 1, Makwa Lodge is near Vaughan Lake which is east of SWW. We did stay with old owner at SWW. I have met the new owner at one of the sport shows. If you attend one of the sport shows this year pickyourself up a free Patricia Region Map. www. heartland .on.ca or 1-800-465-7101 it will show all the Lodges in the area. Happy Holidays, FRED"
515499,Jigger1,2001-12-19 19:38:00,234,"Fred,Had a map and now see where Mahkwa Lodge is. How big is that huge sand wall across the lake to the NE? I've only seen it from about 8-10 miles away (close as we've gotten to that area) and IT LOOKS MASSIVE! Can't wait to get back on Lac Seul ... I can hear it calling!Have a great Holiday!"
