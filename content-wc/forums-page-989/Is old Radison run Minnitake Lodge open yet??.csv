Does anyone know if it re-opened yet and under what name?? In case there is more than one Minnitake lodge, this was the one by Paradise Cove.Thanks"

It never really made any money and was finally seized for non-payment of taxes in 1995, I think. It was later purchased by an individual from Texas with the idea of reopening it but never really got off the ground. I heard that because it was basically just locked up when it was seized, without being winterized, the damages from ruptured pipes were just too severe and expensive to repair to make re-opening viable. It is really a shame because the main lodge is a beautiful, historically significant building. I have heard some talk from time to time that the site might be used to open a casino but this never seems to progress beyond the talk stage."
