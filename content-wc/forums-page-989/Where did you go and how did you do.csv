515165,Bobby,2001-12-19 02:30:00,211,"Fished area around Family Lake (fly-in community of Little Grand Rapids, Manitoba) nearly every day this past summer. Lots of 3-4 lb walleyes, not many bigger. Caught a few 5 pounders. Only 'heard' of one master angler walleye this year in the community... Biggest I saw was this one fellow's, a 27"" walleye in September. Caught consistently larger fish on Fishing Lake than Family Lake (next lake up the Berens River.)Caught a few 36"" northerns in the summer. In early October, managed to catch a 38"" northern. Barely caught any fish after that. Strange, scarcely a bite ever since, couldn't find the fish, especially the walleyes. And, mild winter thus far has prevented freezeup. Overall, summer was excellent for 'eater' size walleye, often 50+ per day, especially up the Dogskin River. Shallow Bomber Long-A's cast into eddies below rapids, deadly. Although the better half stuck to jigging and did just as good... There's several lodges in the area (Dogskin Lake, Shining Falls, Family Lake, Fishing Lake, Amphibian Lake, Moar Lake, etc...) Canadian shield - beautiful."
515166,Guest,2001-12-23 22:14:00,0,"Took a trip up to Lake Kabinakigami in June of 2001. Fishing started off slowly, but then employed the use of depth finder while we were trolling with crawler rigs that we turned into minnow rigs and absolutely slayed the fish. Also caught an ample amount of pike as well as whitefish. If anyone is interested in hearing about Lake Kabinakigami, please let me know. It is located in northern Ontario and you are flown in in a bushplane. The price was very reasonable for a one week trip ($615 US). It is not 5 star, but if you want to get away from it all, this is the place for you. This place is so good, that I'm taking another trip there this year and have made my own crawler rigs out of leader wire so that I can land some of those 40""+ northern as well. Any questions, please feel free to e-mail me at [email protected]."
515167,Flip,2001-12-23 23:29:00,10,"Marc,What outfitter did you use for your trip and when did you go. How was the cabin. Sounds interesting tell me more here or email me. ."
515168,outdoor fanatic,2001-12-26 20:48:00,90,"Flip, used Everson's Lodge. I went in the first week of June last year and am going in the last week of May this year. The cabin's are okay. They are clean and most have 2 bedrooms with 2 beds to a room, but some cabins can accomodate 8-10 people. They are heated with a wood stove (they provide the wood) and have complete bathroom. There is electricity provided by generators and there is a gas stove and refrig in each cabin. There is also a fish cleaning house and a little general store (but it will cost you plenty if you need to buy something there). There is one boat per 2 people. You fly out of Hawk Junction Ont. to Everson's Lodge. I believe the lake is 25 miles around and there are plenty of fish. Check out the website: www.eversonslodge.com. If I can be of more help, let me know."
515169,Guest,2001-12-27 18:50:00,0,went to nettogami lake with cochrane air lots of walleye 14\21 inchs biggest northern 40in good outfitter good lake
515170,Guest,2001-12-30 07:44:00,0,"We take a trip each year to South Bay Lodge in July, because that's when the cabbage is in full bloom. If you like to catch BIG pike, several each year we go over 40. Biggest I""ve seen was 53inches! Lake trout fishing here is good also....NW Ontario at the end of the road and then a 3 mile boat ride. good guides, clean operation! southbaylodge.com is the web address. good luck."
515154,hgf,2001-10-06 13:07:00,199,"June and early july, two short trips to S Dakota, so so. end of july, 4 days at Eagle Lake, so so,, two great days at Gull Rock Lake, south of Red Lake.Caught my two best ever northerns, learned how to finally handle my new boat and all the extras. Fantastic. End of august, one week with the guys at Bluffy Lake,, Ear Falls, a boat in resort. Lots and lots of walleyes, not big, but lots every day. One friend caught a 38"" northern. He is still grinning. Now, maybe one more trip in october????????//Waubay?Baudette? Canada (or is it too cold by now up there?Never been there this late) Oh, and I did keep the better half happy by taking her along to a conference in florida, spoiled a bit by being stuck there by the 9/11 deal. She thinks a ""make up"" trip is in order."
515155,Guest,2001-10-06 16:31:00,0,"Spent a month in Canada this year on three different trips. The first one was during opening week at a campground just south of Frog Rapids in Sioux Lookout. Abrams Lake Campground. Probably my best trip of the year as far as size goes. Lots of wallies over the slot with the biggest being an 8 1/4 lb - 28 1/2 "" long. This baby was caught at the bridge in Frog Rapids. The last week in May and first week in June, went to an outpost camp out of Anderson's Lodge where we fished Lac Seul. Big fish and numbers. Five of us guys were there for 5 days and figured we caught at least a thousand fish. With the water level up, it was great.Spent the last week of August and the first week in Sept. At two different campgrounds south of Sioux Lookout. Donnelly's for the first week and back at Abrams Lake the last week. Probably caught bigger fish at Donnelly's but more fish at Abrams. Donnelly's camp in located on the southern part of Minnitaki Lake. My biggest fish on this trip was two 24"" - 5 lbs. both caught out of Donnelly's. The last day of our trip was probably my best ever day. Fished Abrams Lake within a mile of the campground and caught between 80 and a hundred fish in about 6 hours. Great fishing but nothing real big. Several in the slot but mostly 15 - 18 inchers. Lot of fun, however I was hoping for some big walleyes this time of year. O well, next time. Cannot say enough good things about Anderson's Lodge or Abrams Lake Campground. They are great people and made our trips most enjoyable. My plan for next year is to be there on opening Saturday and stay until we come out of our outpost on June 4. I'm loving this retirement.If you want to email me for additional information do so at: [email protected]eyesnatcher"
515156,TangledAngler,2001-10-08 08:15:00,65,"Went to Sandy Haven Camp on Lake Nipissing near the mouth of the French River. It was the best fishing we've had there in years with the walleye fishing being top rate. We also caught good numbers of smallies and largemouth and pike. As usual, my thirst for next year's trip began on the ride home from this year's trip!"
515157,duffy,2001-10-19 06:18:00,49,Back to the top. Come on guys let's hear your reports. Thanks.Duffy
515158,Fred_G,2001-10-19 16:19:00,908,"A group of 10, including two of my sons, went to The Old Post & Village (www.oldpost.com) on Lake St. Joseph the first week of August. This was our fifth year at The Old Post, and by far the best walleye fishing of any year, in terms of size and numbers. We did, however, have one day that we were only able to be on the lake for about 3 hours due to wind and storms. We hadn't experienced this previously, but I'm sure it won't be the last time either.The best part of the trip came on our last day when my oldest son caught his biggest pike to date, a 36 incher. The smile on his face was priceless and will stay with me for the rest of my days.The Old Post is a great camp. John Grace and his staff go put of their way to make our stay the best possible. We are already planing next years trip. Looks like my son-in-law will be joining us also. Life sure can't get much better than this.Fred"
515153,Guest,2001-10-23 13:04:00,0,"Fished Athabasca For the last 3 years this year had 8 pike over 20# with the biggerst being 24 #. Had five of these fish in one day. Had days where you could literally catch a pike every cast. Also had a 37# and 32# lakers . All in all a good week Total numbers ,we give up trying to count."
515159,JD,2001-10-24 18:26:00,22,I went to Ramsey Lake in Sultan this past June. We averaged probably about 50 walleyes a day. Most were in the slot but did manage to get 3 8-10 ponders. All the fish were real fat.
515160,Seanik,2001-12-16 22:30:00,218,"Sorry about the late reply, just retired and got this computer. Live in NW PA and spend a lot of time fishing. 2001 trip, early Aug.was with Gardiner Air out of Cochrane Ont. Flew to Partridge/Kesagami Lake. Cabin rustic,boats/motors ok, fishing ok with a long and difficult portage to Kesagami. Outfitter is a control freak , has a lot of rules posted around cabin and spends an hour giving you do's and don'ts. Does a midweek military type inspection which we passed and were awarded 2 pies and ice cream, 2 pies because somebody flunked. Kesagami Lake is 45 miles SE of James Bay and is advertized as on of Ontario's best big pike lakes, didn't catch any over 30"" but a lot of that size. Our trips are c/r except eaters. Our bunch won't go back because of the many rules, some of the guys were uptight all week because they were worried they would screw up and violate one of Rons rules. Who needs the tension! We are looking for good fishing and lodges within 500 miles of Toronto(maybe north or northeast). Any body heard of Suzy Lake Lodge in Western Quebec? I would appreciate your replies or I can e-mail you if you need more info on the above."
515161,Northern Manitoban,2001-12-16 22:50:00,195,"Wow thats to bad,a fishing adventure like that is suppose to be enjoyable.Sounds like you need to come this way to Northern Manitoba for big Pike.FISH ON."
515162,BD,2001-12-16 23:03:00,739,Can you imagine what kind of trouble caused the outfitter to become a rule posting control freak? To bad what was to be a nice time turned bad for you. Check out www.presslake.on.ca I took my wife and another couple and we had a great time.
515143,duffy,2001-10-02 15:05:00,49,"Well, another season is coming to an end damm it!!! Let's hear how you did at the resorts in Canada. Let's here about the good one's and bad one's. Maybe the responses can help others who are searching for that perfect canadian vacation for next year. Personally I had a great time at way north lodge, north of red lake ontario. Caught all of the eyes (up to 7 lbs) and trout (largest was about 8lbs) that me and my buddy wanted. Pike fishing was tremendous with around 28 pike between 36 and 44 inches between the two of us. Let's hear your about your trips. Where did you go? How was the fishing? When did you go? etc..... It will be a long wait until next spring!!!!God bless america,Duffy"
515144,Guest,2001-10-02 15:42:00,0,"For the past 5 years my father, a couple brothers, and several friends, and I have gone up to Reed Lake in early June. Reed Lake, which is a 'conservation' lake, is in the Grassy River Provincial Park in NW Manitoba. The numbers weren't overwhelming this year, but the size of the fish were very good. On the way past Winnipeg we fished Cats on the Red River for a day. My younger brother caught a 34 1/2"" channel cat. 34"" is considered master angler. Then up on the lake this same brother caught a 42"" northern, a 28"" walleye"" and a 33 1/2"" lake trout. Master angler is 41"", 28"", and 35"" respectively. 3 out of 4 ain't bad in the course of a little over a week. I think he's still grinning from ear to ear.And the price is right. We drive all the way up (800 plus miles from central MN) and it usually works out to about $250 per person (gas, food, license, and campground).A couple of those same friends are up there as I write this. Haven't heard how they are doing but I'm sure that they will come back with some trophy size stories."
515145,Northern Manitoban,2001-10-02 20:34:00,195,I have had a great year i could write a post here about my summer but i would be here to long.I live only 2.5 hours north of Reed lake and fished it alot this year catching a couple hundred lakers this year.My partners and i take our biggest trip down there usually early june and clean up on Lakers.We release all our fish.3 weeks ago my partner did get a 10 pound walleye out of Reed lake.Might hit it again before ice up and then of course during the ice fishing season also.Big Walleye's are still biting up here and the Rainbows have really turned on.Ice up isn't far now.Can hardly wait until next spring back on Reed.Might take me most of the winter to recover from all the fishing i've done this summer.FISH ON.

515147,Guest,2001-10-03 09:32:00,0,"I leased a camp on Whitefish Lake just east of Wawa Ontario. I was dissapointed, only 10"" to 14"" Walleye and a few mid size pike and small mouth . Other boaters semed to have similar luck all summer. Large walleye from past years seem to be gone and yes I catch and release them. This lake may need serious management to recover."

515150,Guest,2001-10-03 15:09:00,0,"We had a 4 couple houseboat trip, Floating Lodges, Souix Narrows, in mid August. Fishing was a little slower than previous years but did catch and release some real quality 'eyes...2 were 28+, and down to the eating size, which we did a lot of. It was another great trip and would recomend it to all. My wife and I just got back from another fantastic trip to Nestor Falls for crappies and leadcore trolling for 'eyes. Did very well on both counts with all released over 20"" and 25"" our best. Stayed at Helliar's, great time as always, another recomendation. Planing to go to the Rainy River the 19th for some more big 'eyes with a few friends out of Baudett. Don't plan on putting the boat away until ice up. Still a lot of leadcore trolling to do and crappies to harass here in Wisconsin. Good Luck, Doc"
