515893,chuck,2002-01-01 16:31:00,105,"I have found for the money that the pro bass IM 8 7'med action rod with a Shamano CU200 bait caster with 10 lb Fire Line does a supurb job on all fish. The rod is sensitive and strong. The reel is excellent choice. I have caught smallies, walleyes, norther and musky on this reel and rod combo. I usually go up on line weight for fishing larger northern and musky though. My largerst on this reel and rod was 37"" Northern and 40 musky. I have caught small walleye with the lighter line also with jigs. If you snag with fireline dont pull with the rod to break it though, rap the line around the handle or something else in boat it can break the rods. I use a 2' leader of mono when jigging in rivers etc. good luck chuck"
515894,Bobby,2002-01-02 18:07:00,211,"I have a Shimano Compre 6' medium action rod. The high modulus graphite is phenomenal - so sensitive and strong. Also, it has a very strong butt section to handle big fish. I live in Northern Manitoba and I landed lots of walleyes this past summer on this rod, not to mention lots of pike as well. I have lots of other rods (Diawa interline, Cabelas, Mitchell Spider, Berkley Gary Roach 6'10"" Lightning rod, etc) and this is my favorite. I landed a 38"" northern without any stress on this rod at all. It also has a lifetime warranty. Early in the year I used 10lb Fireline and it broke a few times on pike. I switched to 14lb and it hasn't broken yet and is still plenty supple for walleye. I'm not a Shimano nut, but this is my favorite rod. I used a Quantum Response reel, it was cr@p, returned it 3 times thus far..."
515895,outdoor fanatic,2002-01-02 20:50:00,90,"I'm a firm believer in spending a little more and getting quality rods. I use a 7' medium fast action St Croix rod for 6-12 lb test (I use 8 lb) and a Shimano Sedona 4000FA. I got talked into the Sedona but have been relatively happy with it. I will probably upgrade this year to a different reel, but it's really the rod I'm most pleased with."
515889,Peanut,2002-01-03 11:31:00,929,"I too use Fireline exclusively, and would not go back to mono. It's a strong line, with non stretch, and NO line memory.As for line guide/bail damage, after 4 years of Fireline use, my Shimano Spirex is no worse for wear. derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"
515896,Atomic Eye,2002-01-04 19:46:00,854,"Just bought another Catera 4535 spinning reel today for $29.95 at a sports chain called ""Oshman's"" in Santa Fe, New Mexico. That's a pretty nice price for such a nice reelAtomic Eye -- ""Gone Fission!"""
515897,outdoor fanatic,2002-01-05 18:04:00,90,"Well, you guys talked me into it. Just went out and purchased the Catera for 29.99 at Gander Mt. Also had them throw some 8 pound Fireline on it as well. I CAN""T WAIT FOR SPRING!!!!!!"
515898,IaCraig,2002-01-05 20:28:00,434,"Why would you want to? I use 4 different setups just for walleyes? Trolling, bottom bouncing, casing cranks, jigging! It can't be done. If you need a hammer and all you have is a plyers, guess what, it works pretty good to pound small nails. How do you fish for eyes? If I am jigging for eye's with 4-6 lb test light rig, I could cast for pike but if I get anything over 30 inches near weeds, I'm probably SOL. But, if I have a heavy setup for big pike and muskeys with 14+lb test, I could jig for walleyes with it but I shouldn't expect to feel light hits.If you are a walleye bottom bouncer or troller, you might get a rig that is be ok for northerns, bass and even catfish and bullheads too. But, If you are a walleye jigger the only other thing you will probably use your rig for is crappies or perch."
515899,Guest,2002-01-06 11:10:00,0,"I use 2 Berkley IM6 gorilla sticks and Quatum longstroke reels spooled/12/24 fusion.I tie on a 2-7 ft vanish leader [8 lbs test]and use this setup for everthing.It gives me extrem sensitivity,no line memory,deeper lure patterns,RIPping power in snaggy water,the vanish line is very stealthy and gives me a little line stretch for easy hook sets.I can cast into the next dimension,witch is all very cool when you want to bring up the dead!Oh ya, I frogot to mention I can jig a properly weighted crank bait ....low and slow"
515900,IaCraig,2002-01-09 06:40:00,434,"OK undertaker, I admit the super lines reduce the gap a bit, and you can have a multi purpose setup. But I guess I'd recommend different action rods and types of line for different uses. For Walleyes I like a light graphite spinning setup for jigging leadheads, a medium light graphite spinning setup for casting cranks, a medium graphite casting setup for bottom bouncing and a 7-8 Ft glass trolling rod and linecounter reel for trolling cranks. But casting for Pike I prefer something med-heavy with fairly heavy mono line.I think I am starting to see why my boat is always so full of crap. :) To each their own"
515882,Rocky,2001-12-28 20:17:00,5,Can anyone recommend a rod and reel combo that can be used for both walleye and pike?
515883,stewart,2001-12-29 08:43:00,100,A medium rod with a spinning reel spooled with 8# line can do an awful lot.
515884,Fred_G,2001-12-29 17:33:00,908,I would recommend a 6 1/2' med. heavy spinning rod with a fast tip and a spinning reel like the Shimano Stradic 2000. Spool the reel with 14/6 Fireline and you're set.Fred
515885,Atomic Eye,2001-12-30 14:39:00,854,"Here's another moderately priced recommendation that should do you fine for jigging for WE or casting for N. Pike as well as bottom bouncing or precision trolling for eyes:- 6 1/2' Berkely Lightning rod model LR30 6'6"" - takes 4 - 10# test line, 1/8 to 3/8 oz lures- Shakespeare Catera spinning reel #4535 - very smooth with 5 ball bearings. I like this reel better than the Shimano because of where I can place the bail when I'm Lindy rigging or bottom bouncing so I can ""trigger finger"" the line.Whatever you get, don't buy low end junk that will detract from the pleasure of fishing.Question for Fred G. - is that Fireline a high tech mono or a super braid? Will it cut the metal on the bail? Thanks.Atomic Eye"
515886,Fred_G,2001-12-30 18:34:00,908,Fireline is a fused superline made of Micr Dyneema. It will NOT harm your bail or the line guides. I've used it since they came out with it and won't go back to mono.Fred
515891,Guest,2001-12-30 18:48:00,0,www.wristsaverrods.comi'd use the 7ft. medium action for both. this is a great new fishing rod concept. ice rods too!#49
515887,Atomic Eye,2001-12-30 22:19:00,854,"Fred,In the old posts at poage 8, Sept. 10, 2001, there's a lot of discussion about Fireline. Some guys say it cuts the metal of the reel. That's why I posed my question. Can you help me understand why you & they have different opinions? Thank you.Atomic Eye"
515888,Fred_G,2001-12-31 05:39:00,908,"I can only give you my experience with Fireline. I have never had a problem with Fireline cutting into the metal of a bail, or damage to a line guide. I have discussed this with people at Berkely also. They have tested the line extensively and have never found any damage to a reel or line guides. It is my belief that if someone had a problem with a bail, it was due to something other than using Fireline. Fireline has been on the market for over 5 years. If there really is a problem with the line damaging reels and line guides I don't think people would be buying it.Fred"
515890,eyedoktr,2002-01-01 06:53:00,2426,I second the Shakespeare Catera reel. I bought my first one on sale and now own 4 of them. They come in 2 sizes and both have 5 ball bearings. They are by far the best reel I have owned for under $30. They're also better than most of my $40-$75 reels. Great drags!
515892,Rocky,2002-01-01 07:34:00,5,Thanks for all the info. very much appreciated.
