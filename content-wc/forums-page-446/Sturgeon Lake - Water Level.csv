1411772,JJJMN,2012-03-26 09:17:00,153,Any update on Water Level this year. All indications seem to point to very low levels this year.
1413734,mikebertin,2012-03-29 20:25:00,83,"JJ . haven't heard anything yet but FYI they're hosting the Canada/US Walleye tourney this year out of Bobcaygeon, June 9th & 10th with a 5k guaranteed win. May be something to check out. Running 125 boats & taking registrations now."
1413828,Catman59,2012-03-30 04:47:00,345,"We were ice fishing Sturgeon last week. The water levels are down at least 2 ft and with no snow left to melt , there wont be much help until it rains. Mike are you sure you are talking about the same Sturgeon Lake ? he means the one north of Ignace."
1413852,JJJMN,2012-03-30 06:35:00,153,"Catman is right, Sturgeon Lake north of Ignace. I see they are getting some snow at Souix Look Out today with rain in the forecast. Every inch will help. Rocks were bad enough, 2 feet low we will be launching our boat at the public launch near Trappers Point. Not sure we'll even be able to use dock at our camp. Going to be rough opener for Lower Units, props and fiberglass. Might be a good year to bring someone elses boat."

1414941,Guest,2012-04-01 18:48:00,0,OK we residents of Northwestern Ontario get a little pouty about not being considered a part of the great GTA but I bet our Sturgeon Lake is the GSP of lakes and yours is a wimp
