We are flying out from Armstrong, to smoothrock lake.we will be bringing crawlers with across the border, but where is the best/cheapest place to get minnows and leeches from thunder Bay to Armstrong? Or are just better off getting them at the resort?thanks!also, how much bait do you recommend we bring? 2 of us, week long trip. was planning on a flat of crawlers, but not sure on how many leeches or minnows."

We always buy our stuff up there so not sure of the process.Minnows on a fly-in. All depends on how much you think you will use them. We go through a couple dozen per person per day but that is pretty much all we use. The biggest problem is keeping them alive. The best thing we found was a mesh minnow bucket that has a velcro closure to keep it secure. Put a rock in it and sink it down several feet off the dock. Then, raise it up each morning to take out what we will need. If you put them in regular minnow buckets and float them on the surface you will lose a ton of them. They get all skanky fast.Always over do it as well until you get a better handle on how much you will use/need. Not like you can run down to the store to get more.That said, your outfitter flying you in can always bring in more. We always just left a message on the dry erase board with what we needed and they brought on their check flights."
1416315,wallydave,2012-04-04 11:22:00,2151,"Sin makes a good point about sinking your minnow bucket! Otters will raid your minnows if given a chance! One night last year we wearing cleaning dinner, in the dim light of dusk we could see the otters going from boat the boat checking the buckets for their dinner! They will clean you out if you let them! Don't let the latch on the bucket give you a sense of security, they will get past those in no time!"
1416365,Larry S,2012-04-04 12:34:00,665,"Got bait for a fly-in out of Armstrong at Rockwood Bait 58 Rockwood in Thunder Bay 1-807-767-3096 The bait was excellent. We got a flat(500) of Nitecrawlers and a pound of leeches. They also have all types of minnows Give them a call,tell Gary that I recommended Rockwood,also mention that I'm the person who posted on Thunder Bay fishing thanking him and calling him ""DAN"" Larry S"
