1411242,tight line,2012-03-25 05:22:00,37,How much snow did the area north of Nikina recieve this winter? I am curious to what the water levels may be on the Attawapiskat River this spring.We are flying to Beteau June 9th.
1411545,adempsey,2012-03-25 19:27:00,963,"Out of curiosity, I was reviewing some of the climate data for the Lansdowne House weather station located on Attawapiskat Lake. After trying to get a better understanding of how forecasting lake water levels is done I concluded that it's is far more complicated than just looking at the precipitation and snow pack levels. So, I figured I would at least provide you with a link to the historical climate data so you can draw your own conclusions.http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climateData/dailydata_e.html?timeframe=2&Prov=ONT&StationID=10 244&dlyRange=1992-12-04|2012-03-23&Year=2012&Month=3&Day=01"
1411717,GOBIG,2012-03-26 07:40:00,126,"It has got to be higher than it was in late aug last year, and we had a blast then. Enjoy."
1411729,Mike Borger,2012-03-26 08:02:00,1554,"Last year there was no snow in the bush around Lansdowne House by mid Feb, this year there's plenty more.That combined with hopefully a wet spring will mean higher water levels.I fished it last spring under ridiculously low levels and we had a great trip though, so I doubt it matters all that much."
1411744,TIGHTLINER,2012-03-26 08:28:00,223,WE WERE THERE IN AUGUST OF 2011 WHEN I FIRST LOOKED AT THE LAKE I WAS NOT SURE WHAT WE GOT OURSELVES INTO AND WHY WOULD EDDIE LET US DRIVE ALL THAT DISTANCE FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS. WELL I HAD THE BEST FISHING OF MY LIFE AND EAGER TO GO BACK. YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY YOU BOOKED THE TRIP YOU WILL CATCH LOTS OF FISH AND LARGE TROPHY SIZE FISH. MAKE SURE YOU DO A POST ON WC WHEN YOU GET BACK.
1412000,tight line,2012-03-26 16:49:00,37,I have seen from all the post on Eddies that the water level can very quite a bit but the fishing always seems to be very good.I will post up some pictures when we return.Thanks for the replys.
1412062,Moosebunk,2012-03-26 18:26:00,211,"Eddie's advantage is the camp is on a lake that's part of the river. Fish will stay put, maybe even become easier to find in lower water....I predict a very low year up there for Attawapiskat River water levels. This just going by what should be the ""normal"" spring with ""normal"" rainfall. YES, they got more snow this year in the north, but Moose River broke the 20th and Fort Albany the 24th. The Skat won't likely be far behind... usually only a few days to a week difference from Albany. Although Kasheschewan and Albany are under flood watch today, they often are each year regardless. The Moose is dropping fast already. In 12 years of taking note of ""break ups"" on the northern rivers, there has never been a March break-up. Moose is normally 2nd-3rd week of April, Albany a week behind that and the Skat last week of April or first week of May. If Skat breaks by first week of April following suit with the other rivers... consider the ""possibility"" of river levels advanced 3-4 weeks ahead of normal, and the fishing too. Mid summer guys could see it at a real low point if rainfall isn't excessive this spring.I'd like to visit Eddie's one day having read Solo's and many others reviews. Problem he says has become being able to book early enough in the season to take advantage of the hotter post spawn bite while the river is higher for more travel."
1412070,Mike Borger,2012-03-26 18:43:00,1554,"Actually bud, the highest water I've seen and the most active pike was probably my first trip which was in early September. So you just never know.It's a river and like all rivers it runs in spate.Personally I think the main factor affecting the water levels is rainfall.The advantage of early season is they're in very predictable locations though.I think I can solve the problem of booking as well. Without divulging too much there will be some new water to fish in the near future.I'd recommend you keep a week open next year in late May/early June."
1412087,Moosebunk,2012-03-26 18:53:00,211,"Ohhh we've already discussed that plan over the phone Mike... I am quite interested for sure in next May/June if all goes to plan. You, me, Billy and Slop would have the time of our lives if we can make it happen.And yes... you're right about the rain (or even temps)... I'm just saying if spring/summer progress as what I'd think is normal for James Bay, then rainfall and temps would be average and the early break-ups and ""extra"" drain season will sap the levels sooner. But Mother Nature will come along and balance things when she wants, so it's all just hypothetical ramblins really."
1413796,EddieNorth,2012-03-29 22:57:00,32,"Greg from Nakina Air Service said there was good snow levels and the water levels should be close to normal at the camp,he also mentioned it will be a very early spring probably mid April for ice out.Cheers,"
