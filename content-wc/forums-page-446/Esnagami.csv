1410083,IndyTgrFan,2012-03-22 10:27:00,6,"I am new to the site. I'm not an avid fisherman but my 13 yo son who spent the last 2 summers at a camp in the boundary waters near International Falls is smitten and instead of going to camp wants to do a father/son fishing trip. I heard of Esnagami from a guide friend I have and by the positive ""media"" reviews that were listed on the website it seems to be very good. I've booked 5 days in late june/early july, adding my 10 yo son into the mix as well. i thought the lodge was the only way you could fish it but it seems like a few people have reported of staying on other lakes and portaging over to it to fish. Can i expect GREAT fishing (meaning between the 3 of us we'll catch 50+ fish/day or am i being too optmisitc and should i have just gone to a ""drive-in"" camp and saved $1,000 dollars?"

Esnagami Lodge looks to be a really nice camp. I have no doubts that your whole vacation will be an amazing one. Most important, your kids will remember it forever, so that alone makes it worth the extra money."
1410261,dirka13,2012-03-22 17:53:00,15,"ill be coming up pretty much as your leaving, so you can give me the low down hahaha, i am super excited i am bringing up a few baits that may or may not work, i bought some bass snakes i figured i might try for these big pike in the shallows, also i put 30 pound power pro for my pike rod, will that suffice or should i have gotten the 40 pound"
1411331,SteveJ715,2012-03-25 09:25:00,59,"I first went to Esnagami with my Dad when I was 9. I had an absolute blast, and I'm sure you and your sons will, too. Don't forget about the float-plane ride -- your boys will love it. One of them should be able to sit up front with the pilot and watch the whole process -- pretty neat for a 10- or 13-year-old. I believe there are a few guys out there who have stayed in the cabin on Stinger Lake, which is the lake you'd cross to portage into Esnagami. If memory serves, the cabin on Stinger isn't as nice as those at Esnagami. You might ask the guys who have stayed on Stinger if they would do it again or if they would stay at the lodge on Esnagami. My thought is that the portage in might get a little old by the end of the week, but again, I've never stayed there. Plus, in your situation, if the weather is nasty and you decide to stay in for the morning, your boys could head over to the lodge and watch a movie or play darts or something.As for the fishery, Eric has maintained a catch-and-release program for trophy walleyes and northerns for 20 years or more, meaning every walleye over 24"" and every northern over 30"" caught by lodge guests gets released. What that means is that you and your boys will have a very realistic shot at having a fish that size grab your lure during your stay. In terms of numbers of fish, it depends a lot on the weather and how much time you put in. But our experience has been that the faster-action days more than make up for the days when the going is slow. So you may not hit your target number every individual day, but you should for the week overall, and you could well be over it if you get some good luck.I've been there at least 15 times, so feel free to ask any follow-up questions you might have.Have a great trip! - Steve"
1414815,dirka13,2012-04-01 14:11:00,15,"PM sent steve, thanks again to everyone who has givin some insight on lake esnagami its greatly appreciated, i have done 2 fairly expensive trips before this one in ontario and another in quebec and the fishing was well below what i expected, but thats fishing"
1399685,dirka13,2012-02-27 02:54:00,15,"hi all after putting in a heap of overtime at work i am looking to take a much needed holiday, a friend of mine has portaged into Lake Esnagami and said the fishing was beyond belief, so i am looking to book a spot with them, alas ill be going by myself so i was wondering if anyone has been there in the last year or so with any kind of review of the fishing, best time of year to go or tips on lures, i have too much tackle to bring on the plane so id like to narrow it down, also what would be a good walleye rod n reel combo for this type of lake, thanks all, cant wait"
1399757,adempsey,2012-02-27 07:59:00,963,You staying on Stinger?
1399758,Larry S,2012-02-27 08:00:00,665,"dirka,Use the search link on this site,you will get all the reports on esnagami posted here"
1400274,dirka13,2012-02-28 12:17:00,15,"i will be staying at the esnagami lodge, and i have searched every article on esnagami i was just hoping for maybe a updated review, maybe a new hot lure that is a must have in the tackle box or maybe general areas to fish on the lake, thanks again all"
1400467,Curryale,2012-02-28 18:10:00,50,I stayed in Stinger Lake last summer and portaged over to Esnagami twice a day for the week. It was in August. Overall the fishing was excellent. We stayed in the eastern half of the lake the whole time. It is a very large lake and in a week you will have a tough time exploring the whole thing. We did not even get past the half way point of the lake. It was very hot that week. The pattern that worked for us the best was a bit peculiar we trolled crawler harnesses with inline weights over 40 to 70 feet of water. We were likely 15 feet down. We also caught fish jigging. Largest walleye was 28 inches. We saw some locals coming and going though the portage. They reported the fishing had not been that great for them - but it seemed fine to us. We didn't catch a single pike the entire week although we don't have any interest in catching them to be honest and we didn't try. We jigged for some lakers and ended up catching a bunch of whitefish which was interesting. Overall the fishing was comparable to O'Sullivan Lake which is right up the road.
1400590,dirka13,2012-02-28 21:38:00,15,"awesome thank you for the information, i heard about the inline weights on the harness from my friend as well he was suprised too lol, he also said bluefox vibrax spinners with inline weights killed em as well, i just ordered my rod tube and some rapala trolls to 10ft,clackin minnows, you say trolling over the deep holes did you have a sonar with you? did you work shallows alot? how fast did you go through night crawlers, did u use leeches?"
1401027,Curryale,2012-02-29 18:07:00,50,I would not go to that lake without a sonar. I just use my Lowrance for ice fishing with a summer transducer on it. We used worms the whole week on our harnesses. No leaches at all. I cant remember how may worms we took in but I suspect it was 30 dozen or so between two of us. We didnt fish too much shallow. We tried a bit at the begining of the week but didnt find too many fish there.
1401046,dirka13,2012-02-29 19:09:00,15,"thx for the info pretty much all of june is booked, so im lookin at july 7th for my trip bought my rod tube and some gear last night"
1402330,SteveJ715,2012-03-03 15:35:00,59,"I've been there many times, but not for a few years. Plus it was always in June, so I doubt the fish would be in the same spots by the time you get there in July.That said, I would bring spinner jigs for jigging with minnows or crawlers. These always seemed to work better than the standard gumball jig on Esnagami. Also, bring stuff (spoons or Rapalas) that's got that firetiger/perch coloration; both big walleyes and pike will hit stuff that looks like perch. Even if it's just a bit of orange, you can bet the pike will find it. I wouldn't worry much about spots at this point; Eric and his guys will tell you where the fish have been biting in the last few days when you show up in camp. I'd also recommend trying at least one of the portage lakes, especially if you want to get into some pike. Spotted Lake has blue walleye (and normal-colored pike). Betty Lake is a fun spot to get some pike. You have to sign up for the boat for these lakes in advance, though, so make sure you do so early in the week if you want to go. Have a blast, and let us know how it goes! - Steve"
1403151,dirka13,2012-03-05 14:19:00,15,"thanks for all the info, i bought two clackin minnows and a trolls to 10, ill have to grab a firetiger, because i have a few cotten cordels in perch pattern and a few rapalas as well, as for the worm harness ill have a grab a couple of those. i cant wait im a very excited, even if it is 4 months away lol"
