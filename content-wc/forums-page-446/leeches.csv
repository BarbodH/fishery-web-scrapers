1412647,BennieS,2012-03-27 19:48:00,108,Keep reading about leeches balling up in cold water. Is there any rule of thumb on an approxiamte water temperature obove which they cease to ball up? I want to try some in the first week of June but also don't care to spend hard earned cash only to have them ball up. Thanks in advance for any advice.

If they are jumbo leeches and you are looking to use them for bottom bouncing with spinner rigs, try giving them a squeeze before putting them on the hook(s). We have found that the jumbo leeches will twist and tangle your spinner rigs, but if you almost kill them before using them, they will do MUCH better for you. We use leeches a lot for slip bobbers in June, but tend to use the smaller leeches and don't usually have much problem with them balling up if you keep the storage water cold.To keep the cost down, I always trap my own too. One bait trap in the right pond will get you more leeches than you will need for a whole day of fishing with your whole family!"

But if you find yourself with balled up leeches just cup one in your hand before you hook it and blow warm air into your palms like your warming your hands. The leech will swim normal."
