1385419,kegisfly,2012-01-24 09:42:00,22,"There is some good info on the gouin in the forum. I have not been to plamondon, but, I think there are some generalities that apply to all Gouin fishing. For eyes... There is possibility for huge numbers, but, they lack size (13-15"" are the norm). The wind dictates fishing and is usually blowing pretty good by early afternoon on sunny days. There are usually eyes on all ridges, points, drop-offs, etc. The key is finding those really good spots or spots on the spot. We have caught fish here from 4 to 30+ feet of water (some of the biggest were actually shallow). 4pm to dusk are the best walleye fishing times. The fish come up in the late evening and can be regularly caught trolling or while pike fishing. Major river/creek inlets can hold fish. Pay close attention to the info provided by your pilot and/or the info you can extract from the fisherman you are replacing. The Air Tamarac owners regularly fish the Gouin, so, they stay current on the good spots. If pike is your game... just about any cove with some pike grass is likely to hold fish. Also, windblown points and windblown rock faces or rocks/trees in the water often hold pike. Hope this helps and hope you get a reply from an experienced Plamondon bay fisherman."

Usually there is 3 of us, my son, and brother in law. There are several fine fishing spots all within a couple of miles of the camp. I will try to find a copy of the map with hot spots. Pm me a personal message with an address and I will send you a copy. We are hoping to go hebert this year,we have never been there. Any info would be greatly appreciated."

1393214,pawalleye32,2012-02-12 08:59:00,18,"Ron. Thanks. I'm a HUGE Tamarac / Jean fan. Their facilities, equipment, people, and fishing are all first rate. I was at the Harrisburg show Friday and spoke with both Jean and Remi. We've been to Hebert a number of times. Looking forward to bringing my 7 year old on his first fly in adventure."
1393286,octanehi5,2012-02-12 11:36:00,1104,"Pa I spent last sat. sun. in the booth with them,I have been out with at least 4 outfitters in northern Quebec. By far Air Tam has one of the best operations in the province. You would be hard pressed to find a lac that you can catch more walleye than on Hebert. its a walleye factory. One of the reasones its such a great fishery is that it is the head water for the lakes just to its north {doda} Father Lac. The other thing is that they have exclucive right to that lac. You will have a great time with your son no matter were you fish with Air Tam. Have A good trip Ron"
1412999,pawalleye32,2012-03-28 14:32:00,18,Thanks to all who have given information. Keep it coming.
1413081,a3dad,2012-03-28 16:49:00,115,Been there many times and will be fishing the opener out of the brand new cabin #41 this May. The area that the cabins are in provides access to Plamondon Bay and Lac Du Mal√©. I have to say that a lot depends on the water level and the the weather conditions. I mainly fish for pike while there. You will have to experiment with the usual patterns to see what works. You should get a good set of maps and a GPS. If you have specific questions shoot away. One thing I know for sure is that Jean will treat you right.
