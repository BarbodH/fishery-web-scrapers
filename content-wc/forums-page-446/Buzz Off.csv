Whew, the pretty in pink thing wasn't working for my ugly mug."
1402461,eyeman_1,2012-03-04 04:51:00,690,I use this product on all my turkey hunting clothing and it does keep the ticks and skeeters away. I wonder how well it will do on the black flies. Last year on LOTW the first week of July they flies were insane. I wonder if you sprayed the boat carpeting if it would keep them at bay? If it doesn't stain clothes it might be good on boat carpet where the littel buggers love to stay and bite your ankles?
1416263,Perch_44,2012-04-04 09:39:00,55,i am heading up mid july this year and was told that the bugs are not nearly as bad that time of the year. any truth to that?
1416347,Ranger319,2012-04-04 12:08:00,166,"I almost bought some but had this exact question. My concern being, would the product give off a scent? Rods/lures laying on the deck now contaminated with this product? Has anyone ecer tried it on their boat?"
1401514,Pikeslayer8,2012-03-01 18:04:00,1460,"Tired of the skeeters and black flies? Tired of slathering on the bug dope just to leave the cabin to take a piss? Yeah, I was too. For the past 10 or so years I've been wearing Orvis brand ""Buzz Off"" shirts. I don't think they sell them anymore which is probably a good thing as they came in hideous colors, all pastels. When I first showed up at fishcamp wearing one, I took a lot of ribbing for wearing a pink shirt. I called it mauve. Well, the rest of my crew were gettin bit up pretty bad and I was pretty much unscathed. Wasn't long after that before we all are wearing these shirts, looking real groovy walking around camp in baby chit green, powder blue, yellow and of course my pink (mauve). I don't even bother buying bug dope anymore, but I do keep plenty of Cubans handy at all times. Looking at my Cabelas camping gear edition catalog today, I notice that Columbia now makes a product called ""Bug Shield"", comes in both shirts and pants. Apparently, how it works is some sort of synthetic chrysanthemum fibers woven into the fabric. I'm pretty sure it's the same technology that Orvis used. I'll be picking up a pair of those pants for sure. I wonder if others are discouraged (the wives?) from going on a Canadian fishing trip because of having to deal with the bugs? Anybody else have this same experience as me? I don't know but maybe its just me. I don't taste very good to the skeeters."
1401540,Mondo_)H,2012-03-01 18:50:00,91,Come On............tell the truth!! You just bought it because of the color!!!
1401547,Pikeslayer8,2012-03-01 19:06:00,1460,"Lol. Yeah, it goes well with my new pink ""Lady Trion"" rod. Wait till ya see the matching pants! Pretty sure there was a thread around here somewhere called ""Pink, the new super hot color"". It's not easy being an attractant and a repellent all at the same time."
1401557,fishincrazy,2012-03-01 19:35:00,1282,PINK IT'S THE NEW CHARTREUSE!!!!!!!Pike I found this picture the entire outfit you will look killer in this!!!!!With the pink rod and a pink bucktail Man Style to the max!!!!! FC
1401562,Pikeslayer8,2012-03-01 19:46:00,1460,"Man, start a thread about a bug repellent fabric and boy how the worm turns. Been a long winter, eh!"
1401572,fishincrazy,2012-03-01 20:14:00,1282,HE HE HE HE HA HA HA you said WORM...........I want pictures of you PRETTY IN PINK!!!!!!FC
1401593,adempsey,2012-03-01 21:04:00,963,"I had read about the Columbia clothing, but have never tried it. Many of the mosquito repellents use allethrin or a synthetic variation of it which is found naturally in chrysanthemum flowers. So, if the Thermacell works I can see a case for those clothes working. Although, I wonder how long they would stay effective?Mosquitoes love me. I think I get about 100 bites to 1 for every other person in my group. It might be worthwhile for me to invest in some of those pink shirts made from flowers before my next trip :P"
