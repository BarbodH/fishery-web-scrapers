1415300,gmattbruin,2012-04-02 14:45:00,174,Goin to abamasagi again this yr but not flying-in. Goin in by boat from Osullivans outfitters. Wondering if anyone has done this recently(Mike)? I know it is dwnstrm to abamasagi and just wondering how long a trip it was. Also wht was the trip like back upstream return to Osullivans. I know there was some info out there abt a group that had alot of problems with thier journy. I dont doubt their story but I also know from being on this lake that lots of others come in by boat. The no plane thing and worrying abt overloads will be nice. Also not waiting in the morn on the trip out for your flight will be a relief. Any info will be appreciated

From what I can recollect in my research it was fairly far...about 6km.If Howard's bringing you down you'll have zero issues, he knows the river well.If you're doing it by yourself I believe it can be done safely if you take your time, know how to read a river and don't take risks.I know Eddie North on the board has done that trip many times as well.From what he's told me it's a piece of cake early in the season when the water levels are up.With this years early ice out the river levels may indeed be an issue for you unless you're going May."
1415419,gmattbruin,2012-04-02 18:53:00,174,"Thx for the replys. I was thkg when we talked last yr you had gone in by boat,but I remember now how you guys went into camp. We have all been on rivers before and feel pretty good about it. Sure is alot easier in afishing boat with a 15hp motor than a canoe with a paddle. We are goin in the 2nd wk in june. I thk someone is goin in with us anyways to make sure the camp is good. 6km, sounds like a good trip dwn river but its all part of the adventure."
1415591,gmattbruin,2012-04-03 04:32:00,174,"thks Tooski,sounds like u hav done the trip afew times. Can u giv me an idea how long it takes to get into abamasagi. Once on the lake we r good with where we are and how far from camp. With the snow accumulation this yr,I like everyone else is hoping for better water levels."
1415745,tooski,2012-04-03 09:17:00,393,"I thought the trip in on the river was quite a bit less than 6km but Mike is certainly better with maps than I am. I know that twice we were dropped on shore and walked around the meaner rapids while Phil (Elsies brother) navigated them with the lighter boat. It is around a 20 minute trip from the river drop-off point to the cabin, depending on conditions of course."
1416289,gmattbruin,2012-04-04 10:33:00,174,I assume all gear and we have 8 guys travel dwn strm in a couple boats?
1416330,tooski,2012-04-04 11:40:00,393,Can't speak to that since I've never taken 8 guys and gear into Aba.
