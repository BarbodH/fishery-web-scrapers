1411606,FISH HUNTER,2012-03-25 20:42:00,161,"I copied this directly from the ontario ministry of natural resources website. Who needs to purchase a non-Canadian resident Outdoors Card and fishing licence tag to fish in Ontario? Anyone who lives outside of Canada is considered a non-resident for the purposes of fishing licence regulations. Most non-residents need a fishing licence to fish in Ontario. Specifically: Non-Canadian residents 18 years of age and over must purchase a fishing licence. Non-Canadian residents under 18 years of age may fish without a licence if accompanied by a person who has a valid Ontario-issued recreational fishing licence (or deemed licence). Any fish caught are part of the catch and possession limit of the person who holds the licence. As another option, non-Canadian residents under 18 years may purchase a licence and any fish caught apply to the catch and possession limits of that licence. Non-Canadian residents 65 years of age or older are not exempt from licensing requirements. Sounds to me that you dont need to buy him a licence however if you dont his catch counts towards your limit. He wouldnt need an outdoors card for this. However you can purchase him a licence and he then has his own limit. You would have to purchase him an outdoors card in order to get him his own licence. Hopefully this is what you're looking for.

1411615,fishincrazy,2012-03-25 20:50:00,1282,Bingo this is what I wanted so now I know.Thanks Fish Hunter!!!FC
1412503,J-Man,2012-03-27 14:24:00,191,Canadian youngesters can fish without a license and keep a limit until they turn 18. Residents 65 and over can do the same. You are supposed to have proof of age is you are fishing without a license under either of these regs.
1412519,FISH HUNTER,2012-03-27 14:55:00,161,"Sorry I should have clarified, and I think the original poster understood what I meant, that the info i provided was for non-canadian residents. You are correct for ontario residents. FISH HUNTER"
1412729,Catman59,2012-03-28 04:44:00,345,"You can buy your son a card and a license so he can keep his own limit also. My boy is 16 and has had a card for 2 years. Its nice to catch more than 1 limit when you are out fishing . Even though you dont need one , you still have the option to buy one."
1412824,Fishoil,2012-03-28 08:25:00,1277,"You have the correct information, both from here and your camp owner. I've taken my daughter since she was about 12 and she always fished under my license until she turned 18 and had to have her own. One other thing to be aware of is if you're camping on crown land as a non-resident you are restricted to conservation license limits, no matter which license you buy. It sounds like you're staying at a camp though, so this wouldn't apply to you if that's the case. Have a great trip!!"
1416518,Guest,2012-04-04 18:53:00,0,A child under 18 fishes on your licence or they can buy their own cost is 9.68 for the card and 50.15 for the 8day sport license. I sell licences this is 2012 prices. good fishing.
1416604,fishincrazy,2012-04-04 22:07:00,1282,Thank you!!!I will be getting them online.Where we go I believe we need a conservation license.We only keep a couple of fish and eat them at camp.FC
