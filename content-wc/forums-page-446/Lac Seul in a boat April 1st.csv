Cant wait to get back out again this week"

1415210,Knoxabilly,2012-04-02 11:48:00,225,How will this early ice out and low water effect the fishing for the opener?
1415464,TroyMansfield,2012-04-02 19:39:00,92,"not sure yet, I hope we get some rain and have a very slow constant warm up without both extremes so the water warms up at a normal rate and everything will be on track for cycles, I wouldnt worry about being able to catch fish, you might just have to change locations for the water temp, or depth. good luck fishing"
