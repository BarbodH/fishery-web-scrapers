1411551,adempsey,2012-03-25 19:32:00,963,"Thanks for the opportunity. I'd most likely be looking at the end of August though, but I will definitely make a note of it. Much appreciated."

1413978,gordy28,2012-03-30 11:10:00,437,hey thereWe have fished Lady Evelyn twice in September - both times during Labour Day weekend (first weekend in Setpember)First year we stayed at Ellen Island Lodge - and while a great lodge - the hosts were not great with trying to help us find fish. it was crazy cold (6 degrees or so) and rainy most daysOur best walleye spots were sandy flats that had a good chop - best lures were 2 hook crawler harnesses on a bottom bouncer. We did okay for small mouth by fishing stumpy bays using wacky rigged senkos or square billed cranks (perch or crawfish coloured). Found most of our pike - maybe 4 or 5 snot rockets fishing stick baits through weeds (either trolling ir ripping)Next year we stayed at Island 10 - really warm - 27 - 30 degres celsius every dayFishing for walleye was much better - best spot was a big sandy flat w scattered rocks at dusk - we trolled or backtrolled harnesses and rapalas - key was the drift - into shore fish were shallow (usually right at the lip of the last break) away from shore - deeper - closer to the second drop offWe also did well fishing drifting into islands where there was a steep break (think 28 - 30 feet to 4 feet in a 100 yds) - harnesses were the killer hereBass and pike spots were similar as the first trip. 2 guys in our group did really well for pike (lots of snot rockets and 2 over 35 inches) by pulling into weedy bays near where we were catching bass. Best lures were spinnerbaits and chatterbaits for the pikeLoved Lady Evelyn - will probably go back next year (trying Brennan Harbour Lodge in Spanish Ontario this year for change/shot at a musky)CheersGordy
1409352,phitans,2012-03-20 15:53:00,21,Has anyone ever fished Lady Evelyn lake in September. We are going the week of Sept. 8. I am wondering what the walleye bite is like that time of year. Thanks
1409444,Rich B,2012-03-20 19:18:00,1081,Normally you have good fishing in early Sept - PM me and I'll go into more detail. Good friends of mine will be up on LLE I believe the same week as you - they're staying at Island 10. Rich B
1410826,klgladhill,2012-03-23 23:55:00,12,"Don't be afraid to look deep for suspended walleyes, look for small mouth in grassy coves(unusual but very true). Check out Fish TV's special on Garden Island/Lady Evelyn fishing.When all else fails go sit at Idiots with the locals, they are a very good group of guys."
1410929,phitans,2012-03-24 10:20:00,21,"Thanks Klgladhill. Please excuse my ignorance but, what or where is Idiots?"
1410988,klgladhill,2012-03-24 14:15:00,12,"There are 5 very good walleye locations on the Lady that you will see Locals sitting anchored in the evening using minnows. The lake has 50+ great walleye spots depending upon conditions. Idiots is one of those locations. The locals call it Idiots point because any idiot can go there in the evenings and get bit. If you have a map of the lake, find the narrows located between the east and west arms. Idiots is on the west side(main lake) about 400 yds outside of the narrows.Good luck. I'll be there in June so there may be a bunch of fish with sore lips by the time you get there"
1411069,adempsey,2012-03-24 17:29:00,963,I put some spots on the Anglers Atlas Google Map a while back.http://www.anglersatlas.com/lakes/googlemap/25196/
1411170,phitans,2012-03-24 20:46:00,21,Yes!! Thank you for the Map! We fished a lot of those spots and they were productive when we were there in July.
1411248,micropterus,2012-03-25 05:43:00,450,You still don't have the really good spots and I'm not tellin' ============Walleye can be scattered and suspended in Sept but the smallies are big nasty beasts.
1411386,FrankLeigh,2012-03-25 12:44:00,80,"Thanks to adempsey. I wish I had that info a few years ago. We went up just for the day and fished where the fish weren't. (We were staying at White Pine, just across from the dam, mid September, '05 or '06.) It seems like a lot of people like Lady Evelyn, so we'll probably head up there, again, maybe next year."
1411464,adempsey,2012-03-25 16:29:00,963,"Not a problem It's not much information, but I've only been to Lady Evelyn twice - the first week of July and the second week of August. So, the information is from the summer and I am not sure how well it will hold up for other times of the year.I really wanted to head back this year, but it's hard to fight the urge to try new lakes. If I can manage a second trip this year, it will be Evelyn."
