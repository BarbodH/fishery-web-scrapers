If you arrive in Canada and forgot your card you can get a duplicate made, at a cost of 10.50 but be prepared to wait about 1/2hour as the license place has to call to verify that you actually bought a licence. If all else fails make photo copies of your card front and back will speed up replace time can be done at any place that sells licences."

Do you physically get a license or is it loaded onto the sportsman card? I know I can't be the only one that did the samething. Did you guys get your fishing license? Thanks."
1411009,HeHooksHimself,2012-03-24 15:22:00,725,Mine came in the form of a PDF attachment that I printed out.
1411016,Larry Mac,2012-03-24 15:44:00,530,"Hehookshimself is correct, I talked with the MNR and he instructed me to go online and be sure to print out my license as that will be your license as one will not be mailed to you. I got mine online yesterday and you must print the license out as it stated one will not be mailed to you. I was very happy with the online system and it was very user friendly. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
1411045,bluegussler,2012-03-24 16:43:00,124,"I did the same thing. You were suppose to print the license from the web page. I called the 800 number and the lady sent a duplicate by mail which arrived in a week. No charge,"
1411316,SSH,2012-03-25 09:00:00,526,"If you lose,can't print or forget to print your Ontario fishing license. The website states: If you cannot print your e-licence, call the Outdoors Card Centre toll-free at 1-800-387-7011 and they will print and mail you a copy."
1411346,Glenman12,2012-03-25 10:33:00,762,and thats exactly what happened to me..got the license in the mail 8 days after I called..
1412897,cuamb,2012-03-28 11:01:00,203,"I always (various fishing and hunting licenses) print mine to a pdf and save it to my computer. If you loose it, you can just reprint a new one."
1412933,HeHooksHimself,2012-03-28 12:14:00,725,"After I posted the above I went looking for my license and of course I could not find it. I would say my wife randomly moves my stuff around and even though that is true, I would never say it in case she reads WC when i leave it up on the computer screen. Anyway, I called MNR and told them that I had printed it but could not locate it and asked if they could send another PDF. I was told that they do not store PDFs and that I would have to come physically to ""Service Ontario"" and pay $10 (CDN) for a copy of my license. Soooo, be sure you save the PDF to your computer. By the way, I found my printout buried under some other stuff (I'm sure I didn't put it there, but of course my wife did not either- the dog did it) and put it with my passport!"
1414797,mrpike57,2012-04-01 13:32:00,97,"When did they start the online license renewal. I renewed mine using the phone number earlier this year, received my new sportsmans card but not my license. Just dawned on my that i had not recieved the license. I will have to call tomorrow morning and see what is up. I renewed back in January or February."
1416363,wallydave,2012-04-04 12:31:00,2151,I just printed my license out from the MNR website. Make that one less thing to check off my pre-trip list of things to do! Now its the long wait until June
