I remember years ago, on Turtle Lake, at Turtle Portage, LOW, the resort which was there had a dock on the north side of the lake which would have to be repaired every spring. The dock foundations were large log cribs formed in a stockade configuration and filled to the top with huge boulders. The outgoing ice would move or destroy the cribs and dock almost every spring, and the dock would have to be rebuilt. A large boat house was destroyed one year. To those familiar with the area, a few remnants still remain, great fish holding structure at certain times. Powerful stuff, that ice! Bill"
