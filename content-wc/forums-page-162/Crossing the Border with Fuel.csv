6188657,Remi,2018-05-12 15:34:00,41,"We do the same. Bring in 6 cans each 5 gallon. Some years no smells. Some years boat smells first day. We enjoy traveling far with boat, so it's worth it. Lodge never sold gas until few years ago, but we continue to bring our own."
6192385,big dog1,2018-05-14 15:46:00,4,"About 10 years ago we were following a big line of traffic on Friday night from Fort Francis over to the 502. On the Noden Causeway a guy up in front of us had his boat cover and boat all burst into flames. Not sure if a cig got thrown out the window or if he was carrying gas or what but his boat and about 1/2 of his car were burnt to the ground. They were packed to the gills. With a rough road to travel and the extra hazard, I would just prefer to travel without the extra fuel."
6193713,1shooter,2018-05-15 07:18:00,1493,its not worth the hassle. If the resort you fish at sells gas just buy it there.
6194025,stumcfar,2018-05-15 09:24:00,451,"We were chastised at the border one year, because we had extra tanks with for our two boats as we were camping on an island on Quesnel Lake in Manitoba. We were told 1 tank per motor. They didn't charge us duty but said they could and should. I think it will depend on the customs agent and their mood that day. Lots of people talk about the danger and hazards of hauling extra gas. People do it all the time, for their boats or for other things. I can say I have never heard of a explosion or fire caused by hauling an extra gas tank. Maybe in some parts of the country or Canada it happens all the time, but never around where I live!"
6196078,CMesserschmidt,2018-05-18 06:53:00,1006,Every year my buddy puts his 52 gallon farm tank with pump in the bed of my truck and we leave it empty till we get to International Falls. We then fill it there. I have never had a problem with them saying anything about it. And its clear as day no hiding. I like this tank as well because there is no fuel smell and no way to spill it. Saves us quite a bit of money. Since we burn 20 gallons of fuel in his boat a day which is a full tank for him. This year we're taking my new boat and the 250 SHO is pretty good on fuel so I don't think we'll need the farm tank this year.
6196722,NP4ME,2018-05-19 12:32:00,378,"Thanks for all the replies, guys. I was a little surprised by the varying opinions on this. We are staying at an island camp, and I'm guessing we are going to be burning quite a bit of fuel during the stay. I can't even imagine what gas prices are on the island, so I figured bringing some extra fuel along could be quite the savings. Thanks again for the suggestions."
6187161,NP4ME,2018-05-11 15:00:00,378,"We normally rent camp boats, but this year we are going to be bringing our own. I know several of you veterans bring your own boat each year, so my question is: How much fuel can you cross the border with without getting any trouble from the Border Patrol? Thanks for your expertise!"
6187169,btyreprich,2018-05-11 15:03:00,1067,Certainly thereâ€™s no issue if you have a built in gas tank in the boat and that is filled up.We too used to bring along a few extra gas jugs and never had an issue.No longer do we do this however. Too messy and dangerous
6187193,pjshorthorn,2018-05-11 15:10:00,5654,Always have just filled up the boat and the vehicles before crossing. The chance of a problem with portable fuel tanks in the boat just wasn't worth it to me. PjShorthorn
6187505,Andre (wallyandre),2018-05-11 17:38:00,2274,http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/tdg/awarenes...-faq-1159.html I agree with the others about the dangerosity
6187649,CI_Guy,2018-05-11 19:36:00,2118,"Brought an extra 10 gallons in gas cans in the boat 1 year. Reported it at the border with no problems. Even though no gas spilled, everything in the boat smelled like gas the first day because the cover had been on for 20 hours. I would rather pay higher prices for gas than put up with the gas smell."
6187737,Pooch,2018-05-11 20:51:00,4618,"There or four years ago a guy went through IF border with a bunch of five gallon race fuel type cans secured in his boat. He was ahead of us and we all thought that was foolish and he was pulled aside by the border guards. Don't know what the outcome was, but guessed they wanted duty on that much fuel. I felt strongly that it was tremendously dangerous even though he did a good job of securing them.It just isn't worth the twenty bucks we can possibly save to put yourself and others on the road at risk. Most camps will not allow gas cans on their property anyway.Pooch"
6187865,The tank,2018-05-12 02:01:00,340,we used to camp and bring our own gas. so we had a 110 gallon tank in the back of one pick up. never an issue. I know some guys who own a house on the west arm of rainy and they take 10-12 gas cans across several times a year with no problems.
6187969,Shellback,2018-05-12 05:21:00,8083,"I usually carry a 6 gallon can just so I have a can to refuel my boat when needed. Somehow I lost one on the way up, it was empty. Don't know if it blew out or not. Now I carry it with about 4 gallons in it. Realistically, it's not any different than trailering a smaller boat that uses a portable tank. How many folks trailer with their portable tank empty? I certainly don't recommend carrying multiple cans, but one extra shouldn't be a problem."
6188073,btyreprich,2018-05-12 06:43:00,1067,"Lodge we used to stay at moved out full gas jugs one day while we were out fishing. He placed these jugs next to his main gas storage tank. It was explained to us that our bringing gas into camp in such jugs is against his camp policy - mainly because of insurance policy. After that, we did not ring gas into this camp. Like everyone else, it's common sense to top off all tanks before crossing the border."
6188345,djk50164,2018-05-12 10:32:00,370,"""Section 4 of the Non-residents' Temporary Importation of Baggage and Conveyances Regulations states that baggage that non-residents temporarily import under tariff item number 9803.00.00 consists of any goods that such persons import for their personal use and that are appropriate for their needs and consistent with the purpose, nature, and duration of their intended stay in Canada. With regard to the importation of fuel by non-residents visiting Canada, such as tourists bringing in extra cans of gasoline for powering a boat, the fuel would fall under the provisions of tariff item number 9803.00.00 and the Regulations. The relevant policy is outlined in Memorandum D2-1-1, Temporary Importation of Baggage and Conveyances by Non-Residents, athttp://www.cbsa.gc.ca/publications/dm-md/d2-eng.html Therefore, where fuel is imported within quantities that are consistent with the purpose, nature, and duration of a person's visit to Canada, it would qualify for free importation under tariff item number 9803.00.00. So technically you could pay duty on imported fuel. I can tell you this I have not been asked about fuel for at least 15 years. Cross the Ifalls border 5 times a year and usually have extra 6 - 5 gallon tanks of fuel each time."
