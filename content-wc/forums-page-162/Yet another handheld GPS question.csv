6195140,KevinSB,2018-05-16 13:09:00,73,"First, I have (unsuccessfully) searched these forums before asking this specific question. While my fishing buddy and I (who use a camp boat) had considered the Navionics app on an iPhone/iPad with GPS only (i.e., no cell) service, we decided to purchase a dedicated device for a variety of reasons (e.g., potential damage to devices, battery life). We just purchased a Garmin GPSMAP 64st (on sale at Bass Pro). I understand we can download (via the BirdsEye subscription) a perimeter map of our lake (Wabaskang) during the free trial period and that it will stay on the device even if we don't renew the service. My question has to do with our ability to acquire a lake (i.e., depth) map. Here's my understanding: 1. The LakeVu maps, which don't work with our device, contain Wabaskang. 2. The BlueChart maps, which work with our device, don't contain Wabaskang. 3. The Quickdraw Contours functionality wouldn't help us create a depth map. In summary, I think we'll have no trouble acquiring and retain a perimeter map but not a lake depth/contour map. Is this right? I can live with it but just want to be sure I don't miss any options. Thanks in advance. Kevin"

6195866,KevinSB,2018-05-17 19:16:00,73,Thanks for the reply. I double-checked on compatibility and think I'm right. Looks like several GPSMAP products are compatible but it doesn't appear any are hand-held: https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/156004#devices

6196244,KevinSB,2018-05-18 11:03:00,73,I looked again and actually think you are right and I was wrong. Sorry if I confused anybody. Would be glad to hear of confirmation from any who use both together or otherwise know. Thanks.
