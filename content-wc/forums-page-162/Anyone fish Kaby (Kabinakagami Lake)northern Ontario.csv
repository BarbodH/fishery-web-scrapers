I've never fished opener on Kaby, but we were there in July last year and the mouth of the Oba was decent. The Oba River and Kaby River should be good. Other spots I'd check are Five Mile Creek, Ermine Creek, Bear Creek, Noisey Creek. Fairy Creek, Stoney Creek, Beaver Bay....a lot of incoming water on that lake. There are also some fish sanctuaries, so I'd check on the regs for that info."
