6197432,neldog257,2018-05-20 20:22:00,16,"Just talked to the outfitter we use, and he said all of their outpost lakes are down 3-4 ft. He said very little rain since first part of April. The lake with the outpost we use is rather small and our group of six guys would rate it as simply ok. We generally like to make a 40 min run to a portage lake that is much larger and our group has found great fishing year after year. If water levels don't come up, there is no way we will be able to make it to the portage lake. The guys in our group have already told me they don't want to go if we can't make it to the portage lake. We don't leave for another 1.5 months, so I hope and pray for rain to raise the water levels. A lot can happen with that much time. If water levels don't come up, I'm not sure how to tell the outfitter our group is not coming. Anyone else facing this situation?"
6197434,x4flatfish,2018-05-20 20:34:00,319,"Might want to give them a heads up. Also probably lose your deposit. I would get in front of it, and call them tomorrow if it was me..."
6197632,joeflip,2018-05-21 08:05:00,75,"Having the same issues with the low water levels, my group leaves in 5 days and the system we fish is 4.5 feet below normal, considering two of the major areas we access to fish only give us 5-6 feet of clearance, it's definitely going to cause some problems. With that being said we our still going to push on and maybe explore some new waters in the area, we fish the English river system just north of Minaki. This area has had low water for a few years due to repairs on the Caribou falls Dam, great fishing and good outfitters, I just don't know how much the area can take as it's getting lower every year. Best of luck .."
6197646,Obabikon,2018-05-21 08:21:00,2370,NW Ontario got a couple inches of rain on Friday... so that has brought LOTW's water level up several inches. A month and a half is a LONG way away. Water levels should be closer to normal by then.
6197850,Aspencreek,2018-05-21 15:12:00,2911,"My son and I fished lac Seul back in 2002, I think, when the water level was down about 4-5 ft all year. Best fishing we have ever had!! And the Plus side was, we discovered underwater humps, rock piles, and a whole lot of structure we would just drive right past before, and found SAFE travel routes when water levels are back at normal levels. Make the best of it!!"
6191625,ILScott,2018-05-14 10:39:00,139,"I will be headed up June 9th for a week and heard last year the water levels were lower than usual. Did the snow bring the lakes up or are they still below normal? I have never been with low water, so how does the fishing change? Scott"
6191745,martinbns,2018-05-14 11:38:00,1520,"We were out yesterday, the northern part of LOTW is probably down 3 feet from last year. Not sure how that will effect fishing combined with the late Ice Out."
6191801,Shotgun,2018-05-14 12:14:00,759,This site may provide some water level insight and data. https://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html
6192097,valley366,2018-05-14 14:10:00,193,That is an interesting site. Looks like they either intentionally draw the water levels down in the Mar/April/May time frame or the weather trend does it. Looks like on the 5 year charts levels drop those months then start ramping back up in mid may through the summer.Probably should specify that the 2 graphs I was specifically talking about were Lac Seul (https://www.lwcb.ca/permpdf/LS/5-Yr_LS-2011-2015.pdf) and Lake of the Woods (https://www.lwcb.ca/permpdf/LW/5-Yr_LW-2011-2015.pdf).
6195912,ILScott,2018-05-17 20:29:00,139,"Just talked to the lodge owner and he said the lake is down about 40"". That is a lot of new hazards to navigate."
6195918,x4flatfish,2018-05-17 20:41:00,319,Where exactly are you talking about?
6195936,prov1800,2018-05-17 21:08:00,5010,The water levels in the vermilion bay area/eagle and all lakes north to earfalls are all down which is basically normal every year.clay lake would be high as it normally is.we are expecting quite a bit of rain tonight and some more tomorrow.fire ban is also on.fishing will go on.for guys not familiar with the lakes need to be extra carefull as low water brings other hazard into effect.low water doesn't effect fishing one bit.hopeceveryone has a great and safe opener.
6195968,stjoeguy,2018-05-17 22:12:00,979,"Lake St. Joseph is down about 4 feet from last year. Last year was very high, but this year appears to be very low and definitely lower than average. Four feet lower on a 190 square mile lake is 158 BILLION gallons less water. Unbelievable. The walleyes will have nowhere to hide! The good news is that rocks just below the surface will be visible now. The bad news is that safe routes from the past may not be quite so safe this year. Oh well. that's what makes each year an adventure."
6196544,tv4fish,2018-05-19 05:48:00,2694,"I thought this was an interesting read. Just goes to show how important the dam is to the area AND how much all these bodies of water are ""tied together"".https://www.lwcb.ca/regulation/LWCBS...y2017Oct12.pdf"
6197178,ILScott,2018-05-20 09:02:00,139,x4 I'm headed to Wine Lake. It is a lake system between Wabaskang Lake and Annishinabi Lake. The Cedar and Annishinabi river run through it.
