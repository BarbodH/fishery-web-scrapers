6197700,aptar,2018-05-21 09:42:00,8,I'll send a PM right now.

5999409,PhilTickelson,2018-02-12 17:38:00,84,"Hey guys and gals, anyone on here have any recent experiences staying at Separation Lake Lodge? I'm looking to take my wife and son(12) on their first canadian fishing trip. I want it to be special but not break the bank. I really like the look of Separation lake lodge, looks like a low pressure body of water with potential for big fish and plenty of actionh. Can anyone attest to that? Is it easy enough to fish for first timers? I'm not a complete newbie to Canada or fishing(I've fished Eagle, Dinorwic, Raggedwood and Carling), but it being a river does worry me a bit. Looks like there are plenty of bays to fish if we want to stay out of the current, but do you end up using mainly river tactics/spots for walleye(current breaks / seams, etc). My wife and son are definitely capable of vertical jigging / trolling, but I'd like to avoid having to run lindy or spinner rigs all the time. Any information or help is greatly appreciated, I'm looking at mid-July, but they have openings through July and August. Thanks!"

6003465,Musky Magic,2018-02-14 14:43:00,3,I have also been looking at Separation Lake - any insight would be greatly appreciated.
6005105,The tank,2018-02-15 08:21:00,340,we have fished separation several times. we did it the cheap route and stayed at the camp grounds and brought our own boats. we fished the river section between separation and umfurmil about 75% of the time. smallmouth and walleye fishing can be awesome.
6014089,kayakmatt,2018-02-19 19:59:00,105,"We stayed there about 10 years ago. Water was record high, but fishing was fine. I'm sure it would have been great at normal levels. Lake was very remote with little traffic. Full of hidden shoals. Basic camp. Check the boats, They were really basic and they did not have electric start when we were there!"
6018705,PhilTickelson,2018-02-21 22:02:00,84,"Thanks for the response, I know that fishing a river system always brings that risk of extremely high/low water. Good to know you still caught fish in non-ideal conditions. Their website shows pretty nice crestliner boats and yamaha motors(but they don't say if they are electric start)."
6018945,Bill Krejca,2018-02-22 07:03:00,6107,"I fished the system in 1964, camped on an island, wasn't all that good at that time, sounds like the fishing had improved since. Bill"
6041057,aptar,2018-03-05 12:23:00,8,We were at Separation Lake Lodge last year for a week. Fishing was great. Camp not so much. PM me if you want more information (including pictures). This was my 6th Canadian fishing trip and this camp was in the poorest condition I've ever seen. Pretty sad really. Suffice it to say we are not going back there this year. PM me if you want more information.
