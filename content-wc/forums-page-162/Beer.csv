6186625,farmnfish,2018-05-11 10:47:00,130,"I couldn't find any last time I was in the Dryden vermillion bay area. The closest thing was the LOW blueberry ale, which is very good. No hint of Blueberry taste I could tell. Plan on taking it with you."
6187033,jambi,2018-05-11 13:57:00,504,any cold beer on a Canadian flyout trip is mighty fine with me. I do want to try some of the LOTW brewco ones though!
6187561,Lake Of The Woods,2018-05-11 17:50:00,124,"Keep it local,... you won't be disappointed, Lake Of The Woods Brewing Company: http://www.lowbrewco.com"
6189553,valley366,2018-05-13 08:12:00,193,"Good responses, I thank you much.Will be hitting the beer store in Dryden or Vermilion Bay. Lake of the Woods Brew is on my shopping list.Cold beer on the porch in Canada 4 weeks from today."
6192329,geomax,2018-05-14 15:28:00,29,"""Sleeping Giant Skull Rock Stout"" made in Thunder Bay Ontario.I have checked the LCBO (Liquor store) website inventory for Dryden, Sioux Lookout and Fort Frances as of today. The LCBO/Liquor store does carry it and in stock. If you are not aware the beer store is a separate store and may not carry it, this is the LCBO/Liquor store.Dryden has 44 cans on inventory.Fort Frances has 18 cans on inventory.Sioux Lookout 34 cans on inventory.Its a local stout product that is quite good and locally popular as a craft stout.You can search the brand and inventory update at www.lcbo.com"
6192649,bigwalleye1,2018-05-14 18:51:00,2632,"That's why this site ROCKS!!! I'm a month out, but here's fair warning to the Sioux Lookout store. I'm coming, and two other solid beer drinkers are riding with me!! Thanks for the liquor store vs the beer store tip, too!!"
6192729,pjshorthorn,2018-05-14 19:20:00,5654,There's been a few trips years ago where our group put a pretty good dent in the Sioux Lookout's beer inventory Canada does need to revise their hours of operation for The Beer Store. Waiting till 10 am to open is blasphemy. PjShorthorn
6194265,labsrus,2018-05-15 11:00:00,557,"There are lots of good beers out there. Like someone said, it is not wine, it is more important than wine. Me I like IPA and pilsner beer Brands that I like are Steam whistle, Molson, and Labatt's All are good ,but the best tasting beer is ""free beer"""
6196502,Wallyeyes,2018-05-18 21:20:00,50,One of my favorites is Labatt's Maximum Ice. Last year was our first trip to Canada since 03 and this was still available. My understanding was this was supposed to be just a commemorative beer but it has been around since the early or mid 90's.
6185865,Bstar,2018-05-11 06:36:00,564,Well said! My two favorite beers üçª are cold and free. Not necessarily in that order!
6186153,jveri,2018-05-11 07:57:00,70,Not sure how you guys drink Canadian on a fishing trip...ever heard of the molson mudslides? LOL
6186161,maddogg,2018-05-11 08:00:00,178,Are the beers for sale in I.F. the same as the ones you would get in Canada? I'm talking alcohol content.
6186169,v-bay gord,2018-05-11 08:02:00,3168,"Obviously this is coming down to personal taste. Pony Piss? I put Sultana Gold in that category. I would try one before buying more. It has an odd taste which I don't like. I do like Kokanee however. When the blueberry ale is mentioned (which I like but wouldn't want more than a couple) it seems people think it's a blueberry flavored ladies cocktail. Hardly.....it's somewhat a bitter, cloudy ale with 7 % alcohol. Drink more than two of the big cans and your on your way... Bottom line, cold and free, that's the best beer (unless it's some of the real crap from south of the border, now that's pony piss)"
6186193,bigwalleye1,2018-05-11 08:07:00,2632,"Any recommendations for dark Canadian beers, like Porters and Stouts that I should look for in the Dryden or Sioux Lookout beer stores?"
6186217,mjayn,2018-05-11 08:15:00,1188,First few times we waited to get beer at the beer store. Labatt extra stock was our main beer. But we tried quite a few. When push comes to shove I enjoy many beers with friends. I don't need or really like drinking thick heavy syrupy beers. Except I like stouts and bocks. I would rather have 12 lites then 4 syrups. Last few years I would bring as much beer as possible and only buy what I had to in canada. Beer is great but its not the kind I like to drink on fishing trips. And its ridiculously expensive
6186305,Remi,2018-05-11 08:36:00,41,"Enjoy reading this thread. I like to try some each trip. Agree, it is personal taste but helps to get suggestions. Kokanee - thought it was okay. Labatt Blue Ice - thought it was VERY tasty. Labatt Black Ice - it was good, but thought the Blue was better. Fun to look at stuff that I don't see in my local store here in Wisconsin."
6186425,terrapin,2018-05-11 09:33:00,353,"I'm shocked you guys would play beer roulette on a fishing trip. Am I the only one that occasionally tries out something the manufacturer claims is beer, but is actually industrial strength colon cleanser?"
6186489,Ricky Spanish,2018-05-11 09:53:00,1298,"So far, Miller Lite is the only beer that I will never drink more than one. Halfway through the 2nd and I'd better be sitting on the can. I have tried at least a hundred other beers and Lite is the only one to hit me that way."
6186537,Bstar,2018-05-11 10:02:00,564,It must be that Milwaukee water!
6184737,valley366,2018-05-10 12:47:00,193,"Have always brought my beer from home. This year intend on bringing my allowed 24 cans of beer from home but want get some local flavors while up there. Going to Ontario and I see there is a LCBO in Vermilion Bay. Will also be in Fort Frances and Dryden. Anyone have any preferred places they stop?Thanks,"
6184777,Ricky Spanish,2018-05-10 13:11:00,1298,"I would expect LCBO to have it, and I've only had it on tap at Temple Bay Lodge, but if you see LOTW Brewing Co. Sultana Gold, get you some."
6185033,Bstar,2018-05-10 16:01:00,564,Ditto on the Sultana Gold. Also try some Kokanee if you like a lighter beer. The Beer Store has a decent website.
6185065,valley366,2018-05-10 16:18:00,193,Sultana Gold and the Big Woods IPA were two that I was looking at. If got some of the Blueberry Ale and brought home the wife would like that.
6185585,hoppy63,2018-05-10 21:42:00,367,Kokanee
6185609,Aspencreek,2018-05-10 22:02:00,2911,KOKANEE..........mmmmmmmmmm
6185713,turkeyriver,2018-05-11 05:23:00,80,"The Beer Store has a great selection but expect to pay a lot more in Canada. We discovered last year that the liquor store in IF carries Kokanee, Molson, LaBatt's and a couple more Canada beers at a great price compared to Canada. The guy there said they had just recently started carrying them and couldn't keep up with the demand from Canadians coming across to buy beer and taking what they could back across the border. That was our stop on our second trip north last year and saved a lot of money. Can't wait for that first Kokanee!"
6185761,martinbns,2018-05-11 05:35:00,1520,"Can't believe of all our great beers you guys like the pony piss otherwise known as Kokanee. Other than great commercials it's terrible. In sunset country, get some Lake of the Woods Brewco. Sultana Gold is pretty good, last year they were selling an amber called Paper Maker that was excellent. Of our usual standbys, Blue and Export are vastly superior to Kokanee or Canadian."
6185817,turkeyriver,2018-05-11 06:04:00,80,"HaHa! I hear you. But if you want to try pony piss, try our most popular US brews, Buschlight, BudLight, Coors light, etc. Kokanee has way more flavor than those. When I was younger I liked heavier beers but age has forced me to a lighter brew, unless I only want to have one!!"
6185857,Aspencreek,2018-05-11 06:32:00,2911,"The best beer is .............an open one, the one I'm drinking, a cold one, etc. etc. It's beer, let's not make drinking a beer into a wine tasting event."
