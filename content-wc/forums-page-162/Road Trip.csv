6195538,Poutwhacker,2018-05-17 08:34:00,4,"I am considering taking a major fishing/road trip into Canada this summer, most likely either to Manitoba or Sask. I'd be pulling a 19' Skeeter and we'd either camp or stay at a lodge, whichever makes the most sense. I am looking for recommendations on destinations that I can drive (safely) to that are off the beaten path and offer fishing for lake trout, pike, walleyes, etc. I'm interested in a good adventure up North as well as great fishing. Thanks in advance"

Don't know present camps available, stayed at the second camp on right side. Lake is fairly close to the border, NW of Flin Flon, Manitoba. Bill"
