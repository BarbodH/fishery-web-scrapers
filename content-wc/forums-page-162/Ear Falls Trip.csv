6196326,SteveZ,2018-05-18 13:29:00,271,My first year there was 1988. We used to go over Memorial Day Weekend. On a number of occasions there was still ice in back bays and the lower portion of Packwash. As we have gotten older we have moved to later dates in June and now go the middle of June. The weather is a little more suitable for us old guys. We also go in September. As far as the difference in the fishing I would say that earlier you have the chance at a big fat girl but we catch plenty of big ones in the middle of June. We probably fish the river 90% of the time as it has provided the most consistent quality of fish throughout the years. We will be heading up on the 15th of June. Should be another great year.

5583137,SteveZ,2017-06-01 08:12:00,271,Heading to Ear Falls on June 9th for our annual spring trip. Should be a great time at JR's Portage Bay Camp. Can't wait to put the Kingfisher to the test.

5592265,homebrew12,2017-06-05 18:37:00,29,"Looks like you are probably fishing the Chukuni or camping lake but I was on Pakwash last week. Started our week really good, then cold weather and rain really screwed up the fishing. Late in the week it started to improve. It seems like every year on the last day we think ""it's going to be good fishing next week"". You would think by now we would change our dates but we've been doing this for over 20 years and habits are hard to break. Good luck."
5592753,Golden Eagle,2017-06-05 21:44:00,2642,"Don't change weeks, just add a week."
5592921,BornToFish,2017-06-06 04:52:00,1224,"Greetings,There is some wisdom to the previous post - just add another week to your trip!It seems as though we get slammed by alternating warm/cold fronts whenever we fish in NW Ontario - spring, summer and autumn. As I look back over the many seasons, it seems to me that the effects of the cold fronts have been magnified during the springtime. The cold fronts act like a gigantic curve ball for the anglers to deal with.My wife most prefers to fish during early to mid August as the weather then is about as stable as it gets in NW Ontario. She is a creature of comfort. We often need to deal with thunderstorms during August, which are often followed by a cold front. There is no doubt that these cold fronts (and wind) affect the fishing, but maybe not to the degree that they do in the opening weeks of the season.Anglers often ask me as to when is the best time of the season to catch BIG walleyes. My standard reply is to pick a good lake that is known to produce BIG walleyes. The walleyes eat pretty much every day. With this in mind, it's then up to the skill of the angler to deal with cold fronts and figure out how to get them to bite!Good fishing and tight lines!!"

We did Cedar Lake last year and have been doing trips up by Dryden for past 8 years or so. Heard good things about this lake system. Any guidance for a first timer on the lake would be appreciated.Stop on by for a beer if you like."
5594193,SteveZ,2017-06-06 13:50:00,271,Yes it is mine. It is a 2025 Flex Tiller. Wonderful tiller boat.
5594217,SteveZ,2017-06-06 13:54:00,271,We don't fish the lakes much. We spend most of our time in the river. There are good fish to be had in Camping Lake and the Chukuni as well as the south end of Pakwash. The bite is much more consistent in the river and the average size of fish is much better.
5594257,valley366,2017-06-06 14:12:00,193,Thanks for the information. 3/8 ounce jigs sufficient in the river or do you need to go heavier.Having kids along we mainly search for the more consistent bite type areas.
6096841,brett13,2018-03-30 09:23:00,51,"We did this for several years. We used to go the 2nd full week of june, but we found that fishing was ""tough"" as most of the walleyes were in their transition period. Finally about 5 years ago, we started going the first week of june. Amazing the difference in fishing in just a 1 week time period. Tight lines!"
