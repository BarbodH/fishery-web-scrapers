6197214,jkaup,2018-05-20 09:59:00,56,Just hope the Bug-a-Salt is not confiscated at security or the border! The spf 50 burns my face so I stick with the 30.
6197276,pjshorthorn,2018-05-20 12:54:00,5654,"Oh snap. I forgot about that part of the conversation. Yeah, that fly deterrent needs to go in checked luggage for sure. I'm like a piece of old shoe leather so I think I have the SPF 50. PjShorthorn"
6197288,phishfearme,2018-05-20 13:25:00,1242,we found a great way to avoid black flies - go fishing in July! better and more stable weather too. phish
6197360,mswope13,2018-05-20 16:16:00,73,"We've fished 3rd week of July for last 8 years now and they cover our boat on non windy days. Lac Seul, Steamboat narrows area. Out of the 6 days, you can bet that they are nasty on 3 of those days! Anyone ever try to wipe down the inside of their boat with bleach? It seems that fish slime is a big contributor that draws them?"
6197372,phishfearme,2018-05-20 16:52:00,1242,if you fish in or near flowing water you will have black flies almost all year - their peak in northern Ontario is typically early june and they die off rapidly after that. for us black flies in the first week of july are non-existent - but mosquitos at night can be tough.
6197510,jimirjr,2018-05-21 05:59:00,1149,Go after LABOR DAY... They are a lot less bothersome at that time of year!
6197940,Aspencreek,2018-05-21 17:30:00,2911,"I pack 2 Thermocell insect repellent and strap each one under the boat seat in front and back. That and boatside releasing all northern, helps keep the bugs, black flies included at bay."
6198010,martinbns,2018-05-21 19:50:00,1520,"In order in the Boreal forest in central Canada, Black Flies, then Mosquitos, then Deer Flies, then Horse. By the time mosquitos get thick, the black are gone, by maybe the 2nd week in July they are pretty much done. Unless you are far north where it doesn't get hot enough, then you have all four species until it freezes."
6198182,steve.a,2018-05-22 07:02:00,274,How does the Coppertone sport work for mosquitoes?
6196686,camp chef,2018-05-19 10:58:00,915,Just a reminder.... As well as protecting you from the sun...Coppertone sport SPF 50 will keep the black flies at bay as well as anything available.
6196930,pjshorthorn,2018-05-19 18:53:00,5654,Don't wear shorts and white socks. The black flies love those white socks. Watched my dad get ate up by black flies while wearing shorts. I had long pants on with white socks and never got bit. I would agree that Copportone Sport helps repel the flies. PjShorthorn
6196954,martinbns,2018-05-19 19:21:00,1520,"Black flies and mosquitos in general like dark colours, they are attracted to them. Wear beige and other light colours if the bugs bother you. Generally I will give my legs a quick spray, they the inside of the bill of my hat and the top of it and good to go. If you never take you sunglasses off it helps as well, they seldom get behind them."
6196960,That Minnesota guy,2018-05-19 19:31:00,8293,Wear two pairs of socks to help with the bites.
6196992,pjshorthorn,2018-05-19 20:19:00,5654,Maybe the black flies on Eagle Lake are color blind PjShorthorn
6197010,mswope13,2018-05-19 21:43:00,73,"x2 on Coppertone SPF 50 Sport. Never get into the boat without it. Make sure to wash hands thoroughly before touching your jig or putting on a minnow. You will be shut out if that Coppertone gets on your bait! We also take 2 fly swatters. Catch a walleye, kill 10 black flies, repeat. Never seem to make much of a dent in population, but has become the game of choice. Start up the motor, plane out the boat, and precede to get sand blasted by the hundreds of dead fly's. Oh I can't wait!"
6197050,pjshorthorn,2018-05-20 05:33:00,5654,"C'mon man!!!!!! You need to gear up and take the hurt to those black flies. Fly swatters are for ...........well.....swatters. Get you one of these for the trip. Fun and lethal. Be advised, if your fishing partner has a black fly on their neck...this will leave a welt. Don't ask how we know this. Just know that beer may have been involved.....https://www.googleadservices.com/pag...Qwg8ILg&adurl= PjShorthorn"
6197056,martinbns,2018-05-20 05:48:00,1520,"That's hilarious, would take quite a marksman to hit black flies at any distance. I guess for guys who don't live near black flies or significant volumes of other biting bugs they can be a pain but to me having lived in Canada's boreal forest for about 10 years of my adult life they are just part of the deal. You can learn to ignore them, now sand flies are pretty hard to ignore."
6197072,pjshorthorn,2018-05-20 06:05:00,5654,We used one while camping a few months ago and it took out flies at about one meter. It has a spray pattern of table salt so if one were to ever forget their salt shaker on a trip....bazinga!!!! PjShorthorn
