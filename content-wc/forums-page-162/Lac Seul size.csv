But don't you dare say bad stuff about the pizza! Chicago pizza rocks! I'm not talking about that stuffed cheese pie on a biscuit dough with sauce on top, which is actually delicious, but it ain't pizza to me. I mean the stuff regular Chicago pizza joints make. Thin, crispy, bubbly crust, slightly browned cheese, house made Italian sausage, fresh mushrooms, and for God's sake with sauce UNDER the cheese. I would bet that less than 10% of pizza places on the south side make a deep dish. I lived off of 58th and Harlem Ave until I got out of HS and don't think I tried a deep dish pizza until I was a teenager. You had to go to the north side or one of the 'burbs to get it.

Our biggest were a couple of 25 inch fish. Most of our fish were in the 20-23 inch range and were caught in 15-30 feet of water. We were there the first week of July. We believe in taking no fish over 17.5. My regular camp also doesn't allow any fish over that being taken out. We have seen a pretty good increase in the number of 30+ inch fish being caught over the past three years."
6155857,HYATT,2018-04-25 02:59:00,19,"The 3rd linky actually contradicts the 1st two - likely because the 1st two are for oceanic pelagic species which can spawn multiple times per year, whereas freshwater gamefish, like Walleye, cannot.Some time ago I was involved in a somewhat heated argument here about the advisability of keeping/eating fat OLD sow largemouth and smallmouth bass.Of course I caught holy-Hades from the many who believe in C&R for trophy-sized gamefish, but the FACTS remain unaltered.Large OLD gamefish, such as Walleye, bass, northern, & muskie, DO produce more eggs as they get larger and older. That much was never in dispute by me or anyone in the scientific communnity.What also remains true is that older, larger female gamefish, while they may produce more eggs, produce less SURVIVABLE hatchlings from that larger mass of eggs.Fertility rates drop, even as fecundity rates (egg size itself and numbers of eggs), continue to rise with size in freshwater gamefish species.As the 3rd article referenced pointed out, fish are different than lizards, birds and insects, because they are NOT limited in their potential maximum size. As they age the proportion of resources as measured against mass, devoted to reproduction, does not increase either. It remains linear. As such, the fertiliy of the reproductive material has to give, since the size and number of eggs (fecundity) increases with age.The limited percentage of resource energy input causes larger (and more numerous) eggs to receive a smaller proportion of the energy diverted to reproductive zygots. This causes a drop in individual egg fertility rates for older large gamefish.Fecundity and fertility are NOT the same thing & fishermen - not generally being ivory-tower scholars, for the most part - probably do not understand the differentiation between the two terms, which has led to a LOT of confusion and arguing over this subject.Selective harvesting is not going to change the genetics of fish populations. (The aliens swiping only tall humans argument.) Size changes in a given population depend MUCH MUCH more on available resources than any genetic changes that favor a reduction in growth or ultimate upper limits of growth.The available studies on Walleye is indeed quite limited but the bass populations have been studied to Hades and gone and there's plenty of research to confirm what I have just posted, on them, and they follow the same rules as Walleyes, northern, muskies, and even freshwater adapted salmon & trout species which do NOT spawn every year or spawn once and die.DNA is hardy stuff & humans, as top predators, are not going to significantly impact their genes without selectively breeding to do so, the same as all the other species we've collectively husbanded over the centuries.Fisheries experts are just that - EXPERTS - who follow the science and within reason try to satisfy both the demand and the quality of the species they are charged with protecting and disseminating as stock in our watersThere is a VERY DEFINITE reason why older brood stocks are rotated out in favor of younger fish who aren't quite as generous with numbers of eggs (fecundity) - it's because the fertility rate of older females drops significantly beyond an age closer to instant mortality than the optimal age at which they stock their breeding facilities.Article #3 was QUITE RIGOROUSLY clear (as mud anyway - lmfao) about that.I followed the math but I can understand why most folks would have their eyes glaze over after the 1st paragraph.(I'm editing this comment to make one more.)In older fish, with less resources going to each individual egg, there is a MUCH higher chance of genetic DAMAGE to the eggs that do successfully fertilize and hatch.That genetic damage can swing both ways - it might be an improvement, but MORE LIKELY it will not, and will adversely alter what we want from that species - if the offspring it produces is even viable.So while I can understand the (in my opinion) selfish reasons why many fishermen who would like to catch a ""biggun"" want us to release every over-the-slot fish caught, the reality is that unless overfishing severely depletes available stocks in a given water, there will always be an availability of trophy fish to catch sustainably related to that body of water's ability to produce them.The immediate availability of them, in numbers, is going to depend on food resources IN the body of water, as well as deficiencies in the biosphere (competing species for that food, predatory pressure from even larger species and voracious hunters of fry, and weather cycles unfavorable to hatching & the survival of hatchlings - like floods making spawning grounds silty & deoxygenating the waters, in the case of Walleyes) that put pressure on how many can grow to trophy sizes from any year class.Yes, fishermen CAN affect those numbers to some extent in the short term, if constant overfishing of species in a biosphere upsets it, but fish (and their DNA) recover once those pressures are removed.The pressure is actually self-correcting.When the ""bigguns"" & numbers are gone, the few remaining hogs are MUCH harder to find & the overfishers move on. The body of water has a chance to regenerate to it's sustainable levels in a few short years - and will do so without any diminishment of the genetic code for ""bigguns"" in that body of water.So while I personally like the idea of releasing big fish for others to enjoy, my OPINION really means nothing in the biologic sense - nor does the outrage demonstrated by the folks who want us all to conform to their standards of harvesting.The fish will still be here, in numbers and size, long after our fishing community PC attitudes are long gone.If I, or anyone else, CHOOSES to eat the ""biggun"", (gawd knows why anyone wants to eat a muddy-tasting old Walleye over say, 5#), that's their personal decision to make - just as it's anyone's personal decision to disapprove of those actions.But unchanged is the fact that they are NOT changing the DNA of those fish, as a species, in that body of water - nor are anyone's C&R ethics, as hard as that is for some folks to accept."
6196376,Bob/MN,2018-05-18 15:50:00,178,The group(10 to 12 people) I fish with always run a daily big fish pool. The daily winners are usually 26 to 28 inch fish. With the exception three years ago our boat landed a 29 1/2 and a 30 inch fish the same day. The guy that caught the 29 1/2 is still pouting. :-)
6155865,HYATT,2018-04-25 03:31:00,19,"Unlikely, because her DNA is directly related to every other Walleye in that body of water.The big fish may disappear, but the DNA remains in size-constrained members of that DNA group.They were her offspring or immediate cousins previously, for the most part.The only reason she grew as large as she did is because she was lucky and exceeded the odds against getting as large as she did, set by other factors such as egg-laying habitat, available food resources, and competition for food from other species in that body of water.Lose the notion that one fish - or even a lot of big fish - changes the DNA of a body of water.(Gene editing is affected more by egg transport on the legs of wading birds from another nearby body of water, than anything humans do with their fishing pressure.)DNA is stubborn stuff, and smart too. It can tell if there is a NEED to reduce maximum growth or not and it doesn't pay one iota of attention to how hard we fish a body of water or how many fat old sows we slay.It reacts to the biome itself, not us acting upon it - in a put & take sense.If we despoil the waters long-term, (pollution or change the eutropic condition permanently) that's probably likely a vey different story.The whiners complaining about keeping big fish would be MUCH better off whining even half as hard about the enviroment the bodies of water we fish, are in.THAT is where the real danger to sustainable trophy fishing, as well as enjoyable numbers of fish, comes from."

6196168,CreteHusker,2018-05-18 08:28:00,20,"My two cents. It's not at all about biology, it's about numbers. In a natural world there are simply less older fish than younger fish. It's better to protect the group of fish that as a whole will produce more offspring. Now for the important issue. My favorite pizza by far is the Chicago Thin.

I am pleased to provide you with a response.Ontario's Provincial Fish Strategy: Fish for the Future, which can be viewed by clicking here: https://www.ontario.ca/document/stra...ario-fisheries, guides the MNRF in conserving and managing fisheries and the ecosystems on which fish communities depend. One of the goals of this strategy is sustainable fisheries that provide benefits to people in Ontario. In order to meet this goal, we must ensure that everyone who relies on the resource is harvesting fish within safe biological limits.Anglers that harvest Walleye, or any other regulated species in Ontario, should abide by the current regulations to help achieve the goal of sustainable fisheries. Lake-specific slot sizes are informed by science and research, including information on the size and age of spawning fish. Size restrictions may be specific to a lake or Fisheries Management Zone (FMZ), as the relative fecundity and growth of a Walleye can vary depending on average temperature and food availability in a particular lake or system.It has been well documented that the number of eggs produced by a female increases as the individual gets older and larger in size. As you likely know, larger fish produce more eggs, which ultimately results in more hatched fry and more adult Walleye in the system. Walleye in southern systems such as Lake Erie grow relatively quickly and can attain relatively large sizes as shown by MNRF index netting results. These large fish have a higher fecundity than fish from populations in northern Ontario where Walleye grow more slowly and reach sexual maturity at smaller sizes. In all cases, if anglers catch and retain the largest and oldest Walleye, they are removing sexually mature fish from the population. Fish that are already sexually mature are able to contribute to the production of young walleye during the current or next spawning season, where younger or smaller, immature fish, are not.I hope you will find this information useful.

6137329,sverg,2018-04-16 15:01:00,102,"Well i guess Im not sure. I just remember him discussing the topic and if water was 70 or above they didn't have a very good chance. I suppose deeper water they'd be ok but shallower not so much?? He did also says that walleyes in the 17-24 in range are usually the best spawners. They tend to produce healthier eggs. I don't remember the reasoning. I'm not sure I believe this but...I don't think keeping a big fish is all that bad. Think about it...if you keep all the eaters say 14-17, and big fish (im talking 25-30) don't have much life ahead of them, then you only have one class of fish. The mid size 18-23s or so. I have actually seen this happen on some private ponds in my area. I fished an old rearing pond for a few years. Land owners frowned on keeping big fish. But I told them that they're going to die soon. (they grow really fast in these prairie waters and often outgrow themselves) I caught numerous fish in the 25-29 range but threw all back but one that died when netted. So all the fisherman that fished this body kept eater size but threw back pigs. Guess what... fish are now very hard to find in there anymore. Pigs died, smaller ones got harvested which leads to nothing. Now not a complete accurate source as the gfp no longer stocked etc but I think it is a good indicator of potential problems. But what do i know. Sure was fun catching those tubs!"

6137473,Aspencreek,2018-04-16 15:47:00,2911,"Nice theory! Your looking for answers to why you are not catching ""pigs"". I have a couple of theories too. You are looking in the wrong places, your tactics are off, and the way you are fishing for them is flawed. When I first started fishing LS, I thought how I did it around here was the only way to go. NOW, those tactics don't even hit the radar. I have over the years developed new tactics and take into consideration ALL of the other factors that determine where and how I will fish that day. Like I said earlier, our group will catch several 26-29"" every year, usually not in the same place, and in many cases by putting the puzzlel together. FYI, about 8 - 9yrs. ago There was another boat that was fishing the same area and before they left they came over and showed us a Pig they netted earlier. It was 34"" and had to have been 14 to 16#. They told us they came around an island and it was floating with fins waving, as they got closer they simply netted the big girl. It had talon marks from being hit by an eagle, which I'm sure, could not pull it out of the water, but had damaged it's spine. What a fish!! This is an incredible body of water and I truly believe that there are plenty of those fish still out there, they are not gone, I just need to get over the 30"" hump now. Finally the comparison to LS and other CA shield lakes to small ponds is hardly fair, like comparing apples and bananas. And doing studies for what size fish are the best breeders takes years and years, and the factors at play in the wild are so numerous it seems to me that coming to a conclusion is going to be so subjective it will almost make it nothing more than good reading for someone with insomnia. Remember any good study needs to be repeatable and come to the same conclusions, and that rarely happens in the fishing world. Just read a couple sited by Breezy, you will see what I mean."
6138833,sverg,2018-04-17 08:17:00,102,"Not sure what your ""itch"" is but you may want to reread my post as I stated...""Not sure I believe this."" I also mentioned how it is hard to find fish..I didn't say big fish I mean all fish. I also mentioned how these are different waters so hard to compare. Think you need you read closer before you type your expertise. I will stick with the facts from what the biology fella said. Waters around my area of Northeast SD are very fertile waters. Fish grow fast. Most bodies will produce a 14 in walleye in by 3 yrs old. That is why older big fish often die off. I didn't say I'm for it but do understand when someone keeps say a 28 because it's life expectancy isn't much longer and its egg health isnt what an 18 inchers would be. I don't do that because I can't believe they'd be good to eat. Then again, erie guys say they're the same. Talk to them. So no, I'm pretty sure I don't need to listen to an internet jockey and change all my 'tactics.' I have caught many a fish on many different waters. Think I'll be fine. Is this a theory? NO. But has been proven accurate in MY area. Last time I fished Rainy Lake the slot was 17-25. That is a great slot. All fish with healthiest eggs should be around to do their job. Couple over and under to eat.ps..I have not developed any tactic or strategies for LS. I've only been there once. Too much to learn in one trip but by our 3rd day we stuck them pretty good. Pretty sure we'll fine on this yrs trip."

6135673,kzoofisher,2018-04-15 19:28:00,5144,"The question of the relationship of size to spawning success may not be answerable in a repeatable way, explaining the lack of published studies. For selection in a hatchery environment you definitely want the greatest number of eggs with the highest level of fecundity because you control all the other variables. In the wild the variables can't be controlled and the data is much *fuzzier*. The biggest fish are going to get the best spawning sites at any given time; size matters. They also tend to spawn earlier as they get larger which I have to guess is an evolutionary advantage. There appears to be a correlation between cold spring weather and spawning success, possibly because cooler water gives the fry more time to find cover before predator metabolism ramps up. Early spawners get cooler water for more days than later spawners most years, increasing their success. The early fry also get a few more weeks growth before the start of the next winter giving them an advantage in the cold. All these variables are untraceable in a study. How do you tag and track walleye fry? What we do know is that in unexploited fish populations bigger is better and bigger fish are more successful at passing their genes on. When we have unnatural selection by humans smaller becomes more successful and overall size shrinks. The solution is relatively simple; put back the big fish and there will be more big fish to catch. The 29"" ""fish of a lifetime"" 25 years ago is becoming a ""nice one"" in a lot of places. That's the result of reproductive success out pacing angler pressure for enough years and the natural distribution reasserting itself. Yes, in some waters there just isn't the forage to produce the really big fish. Fine. So what? The places that do produce those fish should be carefully guarded and protected. And it seems that more and more places have that potential as we move more towards protecting the big fish."
6136097,Pooch,2018-04-16 06:38:00,4618,"Years ago and maybe I'm late to the table with this. I was taught that when sight fishing Bluegill beds and harvesting large bull males, removing them as they fertilize and guard a nest allowed smaller males and other sunfish to take over a nest. These inferior males fertilized the eggs and produced smaller overall hybrids. True or not, I don't know, but if so what we are talking about here regarding walleye is true pretty much around the fish world.Unthinking/caring or misunderstanding anglers are changing many fisheries, sometimes beyond repair.I have no grandchildren, but most of you folks do.

One of the factors is that the older bulls breed first which results in early calves. An early calf has the advantage of being bigger moving into the following winter and is better able to handle disease, predators etc. Which moose do hunters target? The biggest bulls, and perhaps one of the reasons in the decline of the moose herd. I think the same rationale could apply to other species, including fish.

You’re exactly right on the statement that fertility and fecundity in an 18 year old walleye is not the same as in a 5 to 6 year old female. I think what Travis was getting at is that many of the larger walleyes you’ll find in LE are females that are literally between 13-18 years of age, hence the term “teenagers”. This does not mean that these fish are more fecund, and that’s a good thing. If you catch the females in that age range, they’ve already reached their peak fecundity and their percentage of viable eggs is likely much less than that of an age 5 female.Hope this helps!Sarah I don't believe that I ever said that humans and fish are identical - But I do believe the above ""comparisons"" are pretty relevant for comparing the age of successful ""rearing"" of walleyes vs humans.I haven't researched much further - but I also believe there are more studies ""out there"" that will agree with these quoted findings."

Most of the time there's more than one option to achieve a given biological goal. The best option is ALWAYS the one that will get the most public support. Try to implement a program the the public won't support and it will be a failure. On rare occasions the biologists don't have any choice, usually because the change in the fishery came too fast or the public fought any incremental changes until the fishery was in crisis. A good example is the change on Saginaw Bay that lowered the minimum size to 13"" and raised the limit to 8 fish with the perch limit dropped to 25. There were multiple options for reducing walleye numbers on the Bay and this was by far the most popular. It has been a huge success with the public and perch numbers are starting to climb back up. Virtually every fish that is sexually mature is fair game for harvest and lots of them are being taken. Enforcement/compliance is easy because most people love the idea. The least popular proposal by a mile was allowing commercial netting of walleye. That tactic might have been just as effective, maybe even more so. Of course, it might have also resulted in armed rebellion by fisherman and secession from the Union by several Bay side counties. The social/political viability of regulations is critical to their success. 20-30 years ago the idea that a guy couldn't keep the ""fish of a life time"" was probably a deal breaker and would drive tourists away. That's slowly changing now. A new regulation that makes the slot 20"" and up might be doable today. It would protect the trophy fish that draw fisherman from far away while also providing enough meat for those who want to eat a lot."

I spent hours reviewing Ohio Sea Grant studies and could not find any such research. That thought may have been common a few years ago, but I posted numerous articles and quotes from biologists that run counter to that commonly accepted principle', all of them active in fisheries biology today. Not one but a lot. I spent considerable time on this, and I still have not found a contemporary article supporting this. The commonly accepted' thought today, from my research, is that the survivability of the eggs from older females is higher and according to my biologist friend, preferred' for stocking in Michigan.Last, but not least, they all preferred the genetics of the larger fish.The last study I posted showed a linear relationship between size and effort (from a biological perspective) in the production of eggs.If I find a study supporting your view, I will post it, but for now, that study remains elusive.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"

If, for example a group of six fishermen decided to keep and eat six fish over the slot size each and every day.....this would be fine based on the regulations, but unethical to most fishermen. Bottom line is you can't hide behind the regulations if you don't want to be accused of abusing the fishery. Just my opinion of course......"

It was he who informed us of the supposed studies that the MNR had done to determine what the slot size should be for this part of Ontario.

6132122,pjshorthorn,2018-04-14 05:41:00,5654,My recollection is that the slot was instituted on Lac Seul in the mid 90s. I believe the possession limit for a Sportsman's license was dropped from 6 to 4 fish at about the same time or in conjunction with the slot limit.Edit...... The attached article from 1994 suggests that the slot limit on Lac Seul may have been instituted as early as 1989. Also interesting is that the catch and release regulations on Muskie had been instituted on a year by year basis. That reg is still in place today.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1...-canadian-lakePjShorthorn

6132458,v-bay gord,2018-04-14 08:47:00,3168,"Why was that size selected.? I can only extrapolate based on my experience when the MNR was deciding on a slot size for Eagle. Probably two principles in play.......how to protect the greatest number of mature spawning fish while at the same time making it acceptable to the public (science vs politics). The science based on studies on the fish populations on the lake would give them an idea on age and size distribution of the walleye population. Let say they figure a slot of 18 to 21 protects 40 % of the spawning population (I'm just making this up)....... They consider this along with models that show the current harvest levels on the lake to determine how many fish they need to protect to sustain the current fishing pressure...hence the slot size reflects the percentage of fish needed to be protected to maintain a healthy fishery. A bit of science and some voodoo guesswork is involved. The suggestion that bigger fish aren't important because they weren't included in the slot size isn't true. There are fewer of them in the spawning population......but more of the 18-21. Extending the range of the slot upwards starts to have a diminishing gain, as fewer and fewer fish are near the top of the pyramid. I assume this was also a politically easier decision to make ""back in the day"".....I forsee a time soon where the slot size will be replaced by ""no fish over 18 inches.....period""....."
6132482,Jigger1,2018-04-14 08:56:00,234,"If it were me I'd look to statistics and weather. I have no data to support just assuming that research was done to calculate the most abundant spawning fish by size in a given body of water and then set protection to maximize the impact of the spawn based on the total number of eggs a given class would drop. If I'm not mistaken the spawn itself is largely if not solely impacted by weather conditions and as a result will directly impact year classes of fish. If you want to understand what's happening today, you may want to look back at the weather 25-30 years ago as these are the classes of 27-30+ sized walleyes are coming from. Years where weather shortens or lengthens the time of the spawn would have a direct impact on year class."

I believe with all my heart that the resource cannot support or sustain itself in a healthy manner with the amount of fish being harvested on about any Canadian lake.

It was done with much thought - I only wish Minnesota would be ""so smart"".That size female walleye has proven to produce the largest amount of eggs that have the best chance of survival - no difference than humans - do you think a 50-60 year old woman has the best chance to become a mother ? No - it's the younger woman that does - same darn thing with fish ...........Sorry for the analogy - but , ""facts are facts"" AND - I sure wish Minnesota would ""wise up""."
6130330,v-bay gord,2018-04-13 08:39:00,3168,"Facts are facts??? You are correct on the ""amount of eggs"" because in a typical size distribution of walleye there are MORE mid sized fish , hence greater egg production from those particular fish.........because of numbers......NOT because the bigger fish are inferior.......there are just fewer of them.

6130386,BreezyPoint,2018-04-13 08:56:00,1581,"Ok, with respect to facts, fish are different than humans...their growth is indeterminate and they remain fertile throughout their lives. You can't compare mammals to fish.I spent hours looking for research on fertility of walleyes as they age and could find no such study, just a statement that it is commonly accepted by one person. I reviewed every Ohio Sea Grant study I could find dating back to 2002 and couldn't find the study. I did find and post many references where it appeared fisheries biologists preferred the older females as the survivability of the young is higher due to larger eggs and yolks. So if you could post a study showing older females are not successful, I would love to read it.As to slot limits, Minnesota has all kinds of slot limits and they are on most major fisheries. They also have only one over 20 inches covering the rest of the state, so what does Minnesota need to do to be as smart as Ontario with regards to slot limits? What facts am I missing here?What Ontario does amazingly well is ensuring that their fisheries are sustained by natural reproduction.

If they want to catch and eat 3 unders and 1 over, every day, for a week, then good on them. Your opinion may differ, and that's OK, but that doesn't make the other person bad or wrong. Camp rules are camp rules. If someone (or a group) isn't following camp rules, eventhough they're more stringent than the regs, then they should be kicked out. Woman River Camp, for example, does not allow any overs to leave camp. Eventhough the regs say they can take an over, the Camp rules say they can't. If you cannot abide by camp rules, then adios, find somewhere else to fish. I personally believe, and this is my opinion, that on a fishery like Lac Seul, if a guy eats an over every day for a week, and doesn't go back for another year, it's no harm on the system. There are millions of walleye in that lake, and you know a World Record Walleye is in that lake, you just gotta find her. Opinions, although very valuable, do not trump the regs."

Kinda wondering what other lakes you guys would recommend for big walleyes? We tried Dogtooth last year. Hit it at a poor time weather wise as a cold front came through. We only caught 22 walleyes in three days between 2 boats. But actually that isn't too bad. We did manage 3 over 28inches. Had great accommodations and were treated great.

Depending on the time of year, weather, location and type of fishing you do catching 26 to 30"" walleye on Lac Suel is still possible, they are there. We seem to catch 6-12 26-29"" every year. And that is consistent with what we do every year, some years being tougher than others due to weather and water temps during the week we are there, and the amount of rain in the drainage area. All of these are factors in how you fish. Do not assume that you can go to the same location year after year and do the same thing day after day and you will get the same results. It's called fishing for a reason, not catching. But I'm sure you and everyone else knows that too. Fishing is a complex puzzle, and fishing on a fantastic body of water like LS is as complex a puzzle as there can be, but that is what makes it challenging, interesting and fun. There are guys that will sit at the Sand banks in McKenzie all week, because that's what the know and that's what they want to do.

Last year we fished out of Fisherman's Cove the first of August. My observations is that the fish tend to be sized based on the time of year, and where we fish. In the Chamberlain area, I'd say 75% of our fish are under 17 inches but when we fished the NW side, 75% were over 18 inches, including a number in the 26 inch or better range. The difference is in the NW we fished mainly mid lake humps 22 feet +. in the Chamberlain area we fish mostly points and 22 feet or less. That could be the difference, just where we fish. My group would rather catch 25 16 inchers vs 1- 26 inch fish, although a couple of Junes ago we did get a 30 inch walleye in 18 feet.

We fish the Canadian waters of LOTW pretty much weekly, we catch lots of walleye, the vast majority under 18"", last summer 2 26"" and a 28"" along with a good number somewhere in between. I went ice fishing on Lake Winnipeg a few weeks ago and four of us caught maybe 15 fish total and 6 were over 25"". We get regular reports that the fishery on Lake Winnipeg is actually threatened and one of the things they site is the ratio of small to large is off, too many big ones. The commercial fishery doesn't discriminate based on size to my knowledge."

That year class is gone, there are now almost too many fish in and over slot, lake can only 'feed' so much fish a season. There are camps mentioned that have people butchering overslot fish and that is a result of self centered money hungry owners with no intelligence when it comes to future fisheries, sell cheep trips, big fish now and to heck with tomorrow. I liked to fish the humps in the deep basins and did very well. Previous mention talked about catching/targeting late summer and fall fish in deep water. They are dead no matter how well they swim away; one camp owner on south end brags he's a biologist and targets these deep fish.
