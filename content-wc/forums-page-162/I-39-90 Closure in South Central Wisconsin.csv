Saw on google maps that it has us getting off of I-90 near Albion, and then getting back on it around McFarland. It says that it did this due to a road closure. Does anyone know if that section of road is truly closed? It re routes me to 51, then back onto 90 after Lake Kegonsa. Is that the best route? Thanks all! Counting down the days to our trip"

Two lanes remain open during construction during daylight hours but at times between 8:00 PM-5:00 AM there might be only one lane open. If pulling a boat, there are some areas with no shoulder...just concrete barriers. Can get hairy if something goes wrong."
6194746,ElectricSlide19,2018-05-15 20:02:00,147,Thanks neldog. We will be in 2 vehicles with 2 boats. We should be passing through there around 4 am Saturday morning. Does the closing to one lane back up traffic bad on weekends?
6194840,Walleye2242,2018-05-16 05:44:00,263,i also live in mcfarland....no issues...unless there is a wreck of course...which seems to happen alot. this area has been under construction for about 18 years now!!!! ha
6195034,neldog257,2018-05-16 09:20:00,16,ElectricSlide19 There will be no problem at 4:00 AM. Very little traffic. I believe all night construction is only during weekdays so I doubt you will encounter any one lane issues. Good luck
