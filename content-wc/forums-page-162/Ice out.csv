All the small lakes like trail lake are going to be gone this week they are pure black.cedar and wabaskang are getting a darker shade to so with some warm weather we have and 3 days of rain forecasted all the right ingredients will get mixed up.walked down to the public launch on wabaskang and took a picture of gawleys and king Fisher.that part is open and lots of water coming through the falls from perrault lake.on our way back I stopped at cedar lake lodge launch and lake is also getting dark and some open water on shoreline.its 19c here today so it's softening things up.

6174449,Rock Lobstar1,2018-05-05 07:52:00,134,Yesterday was very warm and very very windy. I think it sped up the ice out a lot. 2 days ago the ice was tight to the shore and still not very dark. Yesterday evening the ice was well black and pulled away from shore 30ish feet with open holes visible further out. I talked to someone on the downwind side of canyon lake also and the said the wind was pushing the ice up onto the shore and it was crushing and piling up on the shore. We definitely needed that.

6141961,prov1800,2018-04-18 12:25:00,5010,"Have been out trout fishing the last few days.been 4 days since I posted here.whats happened on the lake is that most of the surface snow and slush is starting to melt.yesterday at around plus 7c was doing a good job off melting.still a few nights where we are below freezing but just barely.woll still tighten up the surface water a bit but good warm temps in the forecast.things are looking good.we have been taking the truck out and 30-40""of ice is still there so I feel pretty safe yet but it's amazing how fast that ice can go.on another note we have been doing great on lake trout and yesterday in our trout holes we caught smallmouths and walleyes to.walleyes really shouldn't be there as there far from there spawning areas.ill keep you updated on the ice every few days.got to take my son and his girlfriend out .enjoyed the finally warm weather."

6106050,prov1800,2018-04-02 17:34:00,5010,Sounds perfect to me.will be guiding next week and looks like perfect ice fishing weather.
6106162,Rock Lobstar1,2018-04-02 18:48:00,134,I went across the ice road in Dryden today and it’s looking pretty healthy still. People are starting to pull their shacks off the lake but there are still lots out there. It’s been getting down to -20C at night still so my guess is you’ll be able to get your boat on the lake for opening weekend but you’ll likely be dodging icebergs. Like someone said before we need it to stay in plus temps overnight for things to really start melting.
6106938,stumcfar,2018-04-03 08:20:00,451,"Here on the Minnesota side of LOW, I will not be surprised if people were walking out and ice fishing on opener. It happened several years back and the ice is thick and making ice this morning as it is down to zero! 6 years ago we fished on the Rainy River and then went out in the lake and fished, in the boat on March 31st. The ice pack was out over a mile but it was funny watching people pull up to the ice pack with boats and some would hop out and take pictures. It is crazy the extremes that we see from here and north into Canada within just a few years."

I wanted so bad to do that last week in May, or first week in June, but my uncle's schedule didn't work for those time frames.

6119874,Rock Lobstar1,2018-04-08 21:37:00,134,Doesn’t look promising for the next 2 weeks. There are some highs of +7C for a couple days but no nights that will stay above 0. I remember spring 2013 I was hired to fly a group from red lake airport to a camp on Little Vermillion lake is the helicopter because there was too much ice for the float plane to land. I believe it was opening weekend or maybe a couple days before.
6121898,yoopertrout,2018-04-09 18:02:00,1172,"I'm in Northern Wisconsin, and as of today, April 9th, we have 16""= snow in the woods, 6""-10"" more coming on the weekend, and 30"" of ice. I doubt we'll have open water by the May 5th opener. So, I really wonder if N. Ontario will be open on the opener on May 19th. For those of you going to Ontario this spring, I hope you get a break and we get some warm weather."
6122050,prov1800,2018-04-09 19:39:00,5010,"Been ice fishing the vermilion bay area pretty steady and and have 25""-35"" of ice.today was the first day the snow layer on top got soft on our way home.yes there's a lot of ice but don't think anyone needs to panic yet.theres 6 plus weeks to go.ive never not had my boat in the water on the opener.close but always have had it in the week before for trout.give it till end of the month.if it gets warm,stays warm.it will be gone."
6125450,bones82,2018-04-11 09:07:00,121,I hope you're right. I believe there is 5 1/2 weeks left before opener correct? I was looking at a site that had the latest ice out ever recorded in the last 120 years up in that area and it was May 19th. And that was in the early 1900's I believe. In 2014 I believe it was May 14th or 16th for a point of reference.

6126410,prov1800,2018-04-11 16:15:00,5010,well my 4 days of guiding is over.was a fantastic week.great weather and fish were cooperating on all days.fish are behaving different and not where they are supposed to be.crappies we found on main lake deep in some holes I know of and once found very easy to catch.not anywhere were ive caught them before in other years. walleyes 25 ft.we also found 45 inches of ice on the main lake where narrower ares stayed steady at 35 inches.today it got warm on the trout lake we were on and snow is melting pretty good today.but as someone mentioned opener not far off so its going to have to stay warm.seems today there was 6 inches of frozen slush so once that's gone the ice will start going a bit faster.iam not to worried I do have a plan B and C.good luck.
6100522,7thCrowWing,2018-03-31 19:24:00,132,"if there is a record late ice out, what will that mean for fishing? going to Tamarack Island on LOTW June 4th, would that put crappie spawn into play or mess with it around that time ?"
6100602,That Minnesota guy,2018-03-31 19:39:00,8293,I think fishing is more dependent on water temp then the calendar. I might be wrong tho.

Just the other day Mike (Red Wing Lodge) told me they were using augers with two extensions to get through the ice. My guess is by June, it will be out.Locally, I don't think ice will be out on some lakes in the Brainerd area by May 11. Guys have told me there is at least a foot of snow on top of the ice and the ice is about 28 inches thick. And we have another week's worth of temperature below freezing with lows in the single digits. But who knows, a good heat wave and some heavy rains could change things in a hurry.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
6101738,prov1800,2018-04-01 09:51:00,5010,That just means a extended ice fishing season to me breezy.lol.but a lot can happen in the next 7 weeks till the opener.but iam betting it's gone.last time it was bad was I think 5 years ago.took a party out on eagle and headed to Osborn bay to find warmer water and we dodged huge ice flows on our way down there.but it can go very quick with the right days.i hope to be in my boat on the water before the opener for some lake trout trips and some pike.

All that snow is surely insulating the ice really well and I would be surprised is ice is out in Central MN by May 11 opener. In 2013 we had ice on the lakes here for opener.Of course a heat wave and some rain can change that quickly.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"

We knew we were in trouble. Got to Sioux Lookout and although the bay where we picked up the houseboat in Hudson was open, the rest of the lake heading north wasn't navigable. We sat at the dock for two full days and on the second night , one heck of a storm came through throwing guys out of their top bunks in the middle of the night. We were able to leave the dock the next day as the ice quickly started to sink,but we only made it halfway up to our intended destination before we decided to tie off for the rest of the trip. It was really an errie feeling hearing the ice bounce off the houseboat pontoons. PjShorthorn"
