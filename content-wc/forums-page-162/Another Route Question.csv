6197406,The tank,2018-05-20 19:24:00,340,we have gone that way also. just not as scenic as the little longer way. but faster.
6197554,UKBDM,2018-05-21 07:00:00,178,I have found that if you get in line at IF before 9:00am you usually will be across the border in an hour or less.
6196654,ElectricSlide19,2018-05-19 09:43:00,147,"Hello all, another which route to take question. We will be coming up from the Chciagoland area June 23rd-30th to Morson, ON. We normally take 39/90 up to 53, then 53 up to IF and cross there, but that is when we go to Kenora, or Red Lake. This year headed to Morson, I am wondering if taking Route 2, then to 72 and crossing at Baudette would be a better idea. We don't stay the night at the border and generally eat something quick before we cross, so restaurants and hotels won't be effecting our decision. With the possible back ups at IF, would it be more advantageous to cross at Baudette? Google maps has them less than 5 minutes difference and about 7 more miles to take the Baudette route. Interested to hear what y'all have to say. Thanks.I should add that we would be leaving Chciagland around 2 am Saturday and that would put us at the border right around 1:30/ 2:00 pm on Saturday, which I know at IF can be a long wait at times"
6196670,emma17,2018-05-19 10:05:00,436,"I also come from Chicago to Morson and have gone both ways, IF and Baudette. Initially I went through Baudette to save time at border crossing. But we tried IF once and since we crossed IF Friday morning we didn't have any wait. I think it's a toss up. You can drive faster going west in MN when near the border. I like the Baudette route scenery in MN better as it takes you through some lake areas."
6196680,coldtuna,2018-05-19 10:51:00,25,"Sorry to hijack this thread with a related question, but I am heading to Sioux Lookout on saturday in mid-June from Madison, WI area and was planning to be at International Falls about 1-2 p.m. What kind of wait times will we see at that time? Considered going through Thunder Bay which is an additional 45 minutes per Mapquest, but if that avoids a couple hour wait during border crossing in IF, Thunder Bay route makes more sense. Thanks for any information/suggestions."
6196694,camp chef,2018-05-19 11:06:00,915,I can't speak to the border crossing time at that time of day ...BUT...The trip up Superior's north shore is well worth the extra time if you have it. Stunning vistas.
6196758,AMPHIB206,2018-05-19 14:19:00,191,here is a link to border crossings into Canada:https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/bwt-taf/menu-eng.html
6196762,BreezyPoint,2018-05-19 14:39:00,1581,"There is no question crossing at Baudette is a better idea. No risk of extra traffic at border. Since it doesn't add significant time to your trip, this is the way to go. I have crossed at both IF and Baudette, probably several hundred times each and have never had to wait for more than five vehicles in front of me at Baudette. I have had waits exceeding four hours multiple time at IF. Trust me, Baudette is way better.Frank"
6196878,erino,2018-05-19 17:56:00,399,"Weird, I have crossed a bunch of times at IF and never waited more than 15 mins. I typically cross between noon -2:00 pm"
6196946,muskyman73,2018-05-19 19:11:00,401,"Baudette is by far the best, plus you can stop at Alice's and get the best pancakes ever. And the breakfast burrito too."
6197304,The tank,2018-05-20 14:24:00,340,im not going to say its that much better but thats what we do. (Baudette or IF) its 20-30 minutes faster to morson going through IF. But we like the scenic route to Baudette we take 53 over the bridge jump on 35s to 2 to grand rapids than 46 to northhome to 71 south a mile to 1 to 72 to baudette. way faster than staying on 2 to 71 to 72.
6197326,BreezyPoint,2018-05-20 15:10:00,1581,"The route to Morson is just as fast through Baudette as it is IF. Stay on 53 towards IF, cut over on 332 to 71 S. Take 71 S to Pelland and get on 11 which takes you right into Baudette. It's maybe 12 miles longer, but no risk with border waits.Frank"
