The camp was in fine shape and the lake was gin clear as always. Few walleye were caught in the daylight. After dark they came into the shoreline in 4 to 6 feet of water. They weren't alone. Big smallmouth, large rockbass and occasional pike were feeding in the dark also. We had a fine week. It was great to be back on the lake. The loons were singing, the coyotes were howling and the bourbon was flowing. Were lucky to have such a good lake within a seven hour drive from home. We didn't catch huge numbers but we all took limits of 17 to 20 inch fish home for the table. Jr. Thundersticks in the dark and hot n tots in the daylight. More bass than anything else although we never target them and they're quickly returned. Big rockbass (up to 12 inches) could be kept but we usually just clean walleye and an occasional pike. Hope everyone has a great opener."
