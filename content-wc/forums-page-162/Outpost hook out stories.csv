6195340,Baitslinger,2018-05-16 20:43:00,93,"When I was about ten years old I buried the treble hook trailer from a jig into the middle of my back. Two hooks buried deep. My dad tried pushing the points thru the skin, but after lots of BAD pain, it was clear they were not going to pop thru. About the time we were ready to call for a flight on the radio, one of my brothers saw a article from outdoor life pinned to a bulletin board in our friends cabin. It described the ""jerk out"" technique using lots of fishing line. My dad tried it on the hooks in my back, and it came out instantly and with almost no pain. What a relief! Since then have used it on others, and also had it used on myself again several times. Do a google or you tube search and take ten minutes to learn it. May save your trip."
6195446,Bill Krejca,2018-05-17 06:42:00,6107,"Besides the line pop out hook removal method, after 4 take outs of friends' hooks, I've come up with a slightly different approach, that is, prevention. New folks to the game need some advance advice: 1) Look back before EVERY cast, it can be surprising what may be behind you. 2) ALWAYS grab lure trebles with pliers before grabbing the fish. Two hook outs were caused by small pike slipping through the holders' hand. 3) Squeeze the fish tight enough to prevent it from slipping through your hand. 4)Keep tackle box CLOSED when it is not being used for lure selection. 5) Do not hang unused lures on side of boat, or in a foam bucket, etc. A friend lost 24 hours having a lure removed from his leg after a rogue wave caused him to slide into a hanging bait. 6) Grab a rod carefully to prevent it from slipping through the hand and getting a hook embedded. One hook which I removed from a fellow was caused by him not doing this. 7) Poses for pictures should be done carefully. 8) I probably forgot another one or two, but by now, you should kinda get the idea by now!

6195496,prov1900,2018-05-17 07:30:00,544,"Barbless isn't the worst way to go either, especially 3 treble Rapalas, etc. I've gotten one (actually 2 of 3 from one treble) stuck in my hand, while the 3rd was in the hammer handle. That was fun. Since then, I find myself crimping them down."
6195508,rockape,2018-05-17 07:47:00,215,"I once had a walleye I caught on a crankbait wiggle a little too much in my hand. Got a treb way deep in the knuckle of my index finger on my left hand. Got the walleye off, slammed 2 beers, and got to work. I was 13 miles from the dock. I was worried about ligament damage. The hook just would not come out. Then suddenly, it just slid right out. The barb was way past embedded too. I put some medical tape over it and continued fishing. If you fish enough, you are gonna get hooked by yourself or a partner. Just be careful when you cast so you don't hook a friend. Hook cutters and pliers are a must in your boat first to remove hooks from the fish, but to also keep you from a long drive to an ER."
6195510,spoonchucker,2018-05-17 07:47:00,82,"We fish only single hook, barbless. Even on the rapalas and such we will modify. The action may be altered, I admit- but at an outpost you are crazy to risk a treble in any part of your body by a freak cast with a bail shut or a flipping fish. Have used the pull fishing line technique once with a single barbless in deep and it was out in a second with no residual. The other part is that you give the fish a much better chance at survival. Honestly do not believe fish are lost because the hook had no barb on it."
6195516,RRK285,2018-05-17 08:02:00,44,Twice in 4 years sent guys to hospital in Sioux Lookout to get hooks out. Big trebles from Suicks. Use bolt cutters to cut them off the lure and then head to town.
6195696,Ogoki,2018-05-17 12:55:00,291,"In late 1980's there were six of us on a fly in our of Wawa. 4 of us in early 30',s, and my Dad's cousin and his buddy. About dark a boat speeds up to us and the one guy has a treble hook from a Rapala , buried in his thumb , right under the thumb nail in large part of thumb. Got to camp and cousin cracked open a beer along with my boat partner. Cousins buddy , a good guy ,who never lifted a finger in camp, and would say "" i don't come up here to work"" "" got busy peeling potatoes. The other guy started to complain of a migraine headache. That left me to remove the hook. Cousin came out with an unopened bottle of whiskey. Guy with book took a drink. Said wait until that takes affect. Now he takes another drink. Half hour passes and I start looking my nerve to remove hook , so I take a drink. Never had whiskey before in my life. Neither of us felt any pain and I got the hook cut ,turned and removed . Since then I carry lidocaine , sutures etc etc. By end of week you couldn't tell he had ""surgery at the island """" as we still call it to this day ."
6198338,wmd,2018-05-22 11:38:00,388,Too expand a little on this method. If you press down on the eye end of the hook until you feel a reduction of pressure the hook is at the angle it went into the finger. Then pull the line that is over the hook and it will pop out. You can buy a hook removal kit that has everything you need to remove a hook from a hand. wmd
6195194,ljcs789,2018-05-16 15:39:00,42,"Going to an outpost with Hearst Air in July and last year I did a drive in with my boys. Well, before we left the dock the first morning, my youngest got a hook in his finger. Luckily we were about 45 minutes from emergency room in Dryden and they wer really great and all ended well. Wondering if you have ever had to get a hook out when at an outpost and what did you end up doing? I am thinking I will be bringing a good wire cutter and a good first aid kit for sure. Want to be prepared in the bush!"
6195196,BreezyPoint,2018-05-16 15:48:00,1581,"Twice I have had big siwash hooks embedded in the fat part of my finger. In both cases, the point, but not the barb had come through.We (painfullly) pushed the barb through and cut it off. The hook just slid out at that point.We carry Knipex cutters and they can cut any hook, even the big siwash hooks.For other hooks where the bard has not penetrated so deeply, see this article. I have removed a few hooks from my buddies using the techniques in the article.https://www.aafp.org/afp/2001/0601/p2231.htmlHere is a link to Knipex. I highly recommend these for every fisherman.http://knipex-tools.com/index.php?id...7&groupID=1473Frank"
6195206,bthomas3333,2018-05-16 16:04:00,465,Yep. Rapala with three Trebles. One hooked to the pike. One hooked to the floor of the boat. One through the cuticle of my pinkie around the bone with just a tiny tip of the hook through the pad of my pinkie. Removed the fish/cut out of boat carpet/removed hook from Rapala/Cut off out two hooks of Treble. Rotated/Pushed it through....Then cut off the end of the hook with an old pair of needle nose. The pain....Ugh. Follow Breeze Points suggestion to always carry decent Knipex. The whole procedure would've been 2 minutes with a lot less pain and hassle.B-
