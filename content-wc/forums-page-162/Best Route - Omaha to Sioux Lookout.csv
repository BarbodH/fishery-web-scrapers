6194894,prov1900,2018-05-16 06:44:00,544,"We do Sioux City to Fargo, Fargo to Park Rapids to Bemidgi...then to I-Falls. US 71 for most of Minnesota. From Sioux City to I-Falls it is 9 hours with 3 pit stops. Sioux Lookout is around 4 hours from I Falls. We stay at the AmericInn in I Falls which has a great restaurant/bar. There are other numerous options in town too as that has been discussed here before. Get up early and cross the border and head to the 502. We used to do the Winnepeg thing, but it adds time and fuel stops."
6194930,rockape,2018-05-16 07:32:00,215,"Gas in Sioux Lookout is over $6 a gallon. Dryden is $5.60. Avoiding the 502 takes longer and will cost you more. I've never had much of an issue on the 502 and this is my 16th year driving that route. Everyone wants to get there, so not many people driving too slow. And as others have said, SCENERY!"
6194932,prov1900,2018-05-16 07:37:00,544,"Ha! We are the ones that are driving slow on the 502 or at least slightly above the speed limit. I swear that there can be no one behind us for 20 miles then boom, all of a sudden there is a stream of trucks/boats screaming by us. I always thought speeding on that road was a death sentence...remember 90 kph doesn't equal 90 mph"
6195420,Wallii1,2018-05-17 05:36:00,37,The border crossing at Baudette is much better than I-Falls. I-Falls can have huge lines.
6195506,bigwalleye1,2018-05-17 07:46:00,2632,"Don't understand all the fear of the 502. It's in WAY better shape than it's been in since I started going over 20 years ago. Travel in the daylight. You can still cross at Baudette if you like, but crossing I-Falls at odd times or odd days helps if you can. Very early am, very late at night and stay over one side of the border or the other. From Omaha, I'd just run through the twin cities to Duluth, watching for the construction at the 35E-W jucntion in Forest Lake, and then take 53 to the Falls. Plenty of places to stop for fuel or food on the way, good roads. And enjoy the views on the 502. The worst section of the 502 is the last 20 klicks into Dryden, and that's still WAY better than that whole 80 klicks in the middle used to be..."
6195526,rockape,2018-05-17 08:09:00,215,"It isn't safe to speed on the 502. I usually go just slightly over the speed limit. Way too many tight passes with traffic going the other way, and big drop offs into the ditch. One way to ruin a trip. It seems that small cars go the slowest on the 502! And as someone else said, the 502 is in WAY better shape than it used to be. That middle section used to totally suck!"
6195610,prov1900,2018-05-17 10:08:00,544,"We sure have seen some cool stuff on that road, in the way of wildlife. Lost track of how many bears and moose we see, up close enough to smack em on the rear as we slowly drive by. Seen wolves three different times, one was chasing a deer that we had to break for. He waited for us to pass and continued on his hunt. Cant beat it."
6195694,pjshorthorn,2018-05-17 12:43:00,5654,"I have seen a lynx on the 502. As we crept up on it, that big cat squatted and too a big pee to tell us we were in it's space. I'd guess we were 30 feet from it. Cool experience seeing that animal in the wild. PjShorthorn"
6194768,NVM,2018-05-15 21:08:00,107,We are flying out of Sioux Lookout in July. Does anybody have thoughts on if it would be better to go up I29 to near Winnipeg and then east or to go over to Des Moines and then north to International Falls? In the past I gotten to International Falls via the Detroit Lakes/Bemidji route but I am thinking the other routes might be faster/easier. Is there any difference in the border crossings? My hope is to drive within 4-6 hours of Sioux Lookout and get a motel and then drive the rest the next day. Thanks for any thoughts. nvm
6194802,Bstar,2018-05-16 03:32:00,564,Don't know about a route from Omaha but IFalls/Fort Frances will put you 4-6 hours from Siioux Lookout. Check out La Place Rendezvous in Fort Frances. Reasonable price and they have a bar and restaurant. We've stayed there the last couple of trips and it worked out well.
6194808,pjshorthorn,2018-05-16 04:22:00,5654,"If you take I-29 up to Winnipeg, you can stay the night there. It is about 6 hrs from Sioux Lookout with a stop or two. You can take the Trans Canada all the way east of Dryden and then pick up Hwy 72 to the Soo. All good road and you would avoid the 502 coming out of FF/ IFalls. PjShorthorn"
6194816,coldtuna,2018-05-16 04:45:00,25,"I am also trying to determine the best route to Sioux Lookout. I am traveling with my 12 year old son, so would like to avoid any road problems during a 12+ hour drive if possible. I was planning to go from Wisconsin to International Falls, then to Dryden on the 502, then to Sioux Lookout. You suggest avoiding the 502 -- why is that? Would it be better to drive from Duluth to Thunder Bay and then to Sioux Lookout? I have never been to Sioux Lookout, but drove on 502 last year to Eagle Lake and it was a bit slow going. Thanks for any information and suggestions."
6194820,pjshorthorn,2018-05-16 04:56:00,5654,"502 is an awesome route for scenery and the chance to see wildlife. It is a remote stretch of road with no easy way to reach anyone if you have a vehicle issue ( except if another group were to stop to help). As you mentioned, it can be slow going due to the high volume of traffic with a lot of impatient fisherman trying to pass each other on a two lane narrow road all the while pulling a boat. I'm not sure what,if any, road construction there will be on 502 this year. Lastly, although cool to see, driving the 502 at night tends to be a little sketchy with the chance of a moose, bear, deer, etc. deciding to cross in front of you while going 60 miles an hour. You can take Hwy 11 west out of FF and then pick up Hwy 71 north to just west of Kenora. From there you would take the Trans Canada highway over to Hwy 72 north just east of Dryden. This route would add about 30 to 40 minutes to the trip time,but the roads are good and there are plenty of towns to make a pit stop or deal with any unforeseen issues if it were to arise. Where are you going to be fishing? You will have an absolute blast with your son. Mine made his first trip with me when he was 10. Best trip of my life. PjShorthorn"
6194822,coldtuna,2018-05-16 05:08:00,25,"Thanks. I was not crazy about the 502 last year -- construction and quite a bit of traffic -- and we will be driving on it on a Saturday late afternoon. The route through Thunder Bay is not a good option then? I don't know if that road along Lake Superior is good and then from Thunder Bay up, or if it is similar to the 502 issues you mention. I see the route you are suggesting which send us west away from our destination a bit. We are going to Echoing Lake. High hopes for the trip for sure."
6194830,martinbns,2018-05-16 05:20:00,1520,"Just looking at Google Maps, it doesn't suggest going through Winnipeg, but that's how I would do it. You would be on a 4 lane road all the way until you reach the Ontario border. Much safer and easier driving. Also a lot more accommodation options here."
6194844,pjshorthorn,2018-05-16 05:47:00,5654,"That's interesting. When I pulled it up on Mapquest, it automatically pulled up going through the Peg and over on Hwy 1. I would agree that it would be the best for stopping and accommodations. Stayed at a couple of Holiday Inns in Winnipeg on the back end of trips and both were very nice facilities. PjShorthorn"
6194848,pjshorthorn,2018-05-16 05:53:00,5654,I'm not sure about the section between Duluth and TB...never taken it. From TB to the Soo is good road with the majority of it Trans Canada until you get to Hwy 72 to go north. You may have seen this but this is a nice trip about Echoing Lake. Have fun.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2fNfNNxAa2E PjShorthorn
6194880,Shotgun,2018-05-16 06:30:00,759,"Have made numerous trips to the Sioux Lookout area from Omaha. Just some of my thoughts and experiences. We've not had good results going through Winnipeg. Have been pulled into immigration and interviewed, which took lots of time, was very busy. I will also avoid going through Minneapolis as the traffic heading north on Friday afternoon is heavy with stop and go very time consuming. We go up I-29 and then across Minnesota and cross the border at Baudette. South Dakota interstate speed limit is 80 mph and Baudette is a small border crossing. We'll normally pick a place in the states to stay Friday night before crossing. Coming home, I've drove it straight through numerous times. Leave Ear Falls about 6 am and will hit Omaha around 10 pm. Enjoy, beautiful country."
