6194926,Freytown,2018-05-16 07:28:00,770,A few outfitters have posted pics on their Facebook pages and the ice should be gone for 5/18 opener on the Gouin. The water levels seem low however. Not sure how much snow is still on ground but this could change the early pike locations. Good fishing for all those going for the opener. FT
6195306,tshea,2018-05-16 19:38:00,36,Betting folks figure it will go out tomorrow - From some of the pictures it looks about 6 feet lower than high water mark ? hard to say - there was lots of snow in the bush 4' at Easter - hopefully the level goes up a bit
6196392,Freytown,2018-05-18 16:20:00,770,"There were a lot of frozen areas to greet the Gouin opener. Bays that have good in-flow seem to be open, but the bigger, deep areas have ice. Today's satellite images show the ice. A few more days to get the job (thaw) done. FT"
