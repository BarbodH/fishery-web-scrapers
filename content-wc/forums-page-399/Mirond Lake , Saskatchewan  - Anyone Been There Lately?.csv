I did a search for it on here but no one has said anything about it for a couple of years. I know the waters way up in that area and usually it's a good time weather wise for fishing. It should be a fun time no matter what, but I guess I'd like some reviews."

For insane pike action, scout for the bait fish that have collected up in certain bays and throw a spoon of almost any colour/size at them. A couple bays at the north end of the lake (near Pelican Narrows) have been particularly good the last couple years. It can be fun to use the ugliest thing in your tackle box and have them go after it (top-water bass lures like a frog can be a hoot. The backs on some big buggers will actually break the surface of the water several feet before they get the the lure. Please go barbless and have fun. For walleye, in 10 to 20 feet of water, nothing outfishes a jig/minnow combination. But wally diver type crankbaits (especially ones with a bit of gold colouring) can be deadly in some shallow bays that you might think would hold pike, but actually hold some of the bigger walleye (3 lb - don't laugh, this is up north we're talking). Go to ""Three fingers"" - ask your host/hostess. Your lodge will be on a bay, the exit of which is a straight that everyone calls ""the Narrows"". Go to the bayside of the Narrows (8:00 or 9:00 pm) in the evening and you'll have some fast and furious walleye action. Feel free to contact me for any other info. -Cameron Muir"
