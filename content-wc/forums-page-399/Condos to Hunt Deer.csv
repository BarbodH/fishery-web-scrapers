1503964,bigwalleye1,2012-11-13 17:00:00,2632,"Speaking from my MN perspective, I thought any permanent stand was at worst illegal and at best fair game for the ""first butt in the chair"" if it was on public land."
1504046,troutaholic,2012-11-14 05:03:00,827,"While it is not illegal to erect a deer stand on public land, whoever gets there first ""owns"" the stand. Stands are to be removed from public land after the season.........I am sure this is where there are issues related to the article."
1504127,Richard B,2012-11-14 10:18:00,735,"If someone built one of those where we deer hunt they would have someone in it 2 or 3 days before the season started. All they would need is a food, water, stove, and maybe a heater and they would be set."
