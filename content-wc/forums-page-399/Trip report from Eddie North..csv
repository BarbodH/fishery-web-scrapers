1476326,Weby13,2012-08-18 18:58:00,57,"Im in Duluth heading back to Chicago from our trip at Beteau Lake. First I would like thank solopaddler for telling me about Eddie! I was there with my father and son who is 7, my friend and his boys 11 and 16 and 3 other buddies. We caught 10 pike over 40 inches. With my 46 incher being the biggest. My 7 year old got a 42 incher.We had at least another 25 pike 35-39 inches. The Walleye fishing was a little slow but we caught plenty to eat! 26 1/2 was the biggest walleye. Every thing you hear about Eddie on WC is all true! He bends over backwards to make sure you have the best trip possible!!! Eddie joined us last night for fillet mignon last and He brought over lobster tail, homemade wine, rum and scotch for our meal. He took out our kids to help him bait for the bear hunters coming in this week! He let the kids help him around the camp and and gave them rides on the atv. He treated us like we were family! What an experience for the kids!!! By far the best outfitter Ive met in my 18 years of fishing in canada!Thank you Eddie for the your awesome hospitality! We can't wait til next year! I'll post pictures when I get home."
