1498332,GreatWhiteNorth517,2012-10-25 05:20:00,286,Why fluoro? Northerns are not leader shy. Braid or fireline to a swivel then sevenstrand to the lure or a snap.
1498364,Campcountry,2012-10-25 06:53:00,164,I find that even small hammer handles can slice through Fireline but not my fluorocarbon leaders. Pike may not be line shy but personally I got tired of wire leaders getting all kinky and had graduated to titanium leaders. They are expensive while making my own fluoro leaders is cheap. The side benefit of using fluoro for me is that it increases the likelihood of catching that big walleye or bass that share the area with the pike.
1498444,pike50plus,2012-10-25 11:45:00,584,"I agree that Floro is better then fireline or braid, after using both for years. Not expensive to make your own either and you can control the lengths you want."
1502678,rocko0305,2012-11-08 15:22:00,138,"Do you guys use regular fluorocarbon spools to tie your wire leaders, or do you specifically buy the fluorocarbon leader spools that only come in 25 or 50 yard spools? I ask because I would like to start tying my own fluorocarbon leaders for two upcoming trips, on to North Captiva, FL and the other to Beteau Lake in May 2013. The leader material I assume is more abrasion resistant, however if I am looking to buy a 25 yard spool of of 80# fluoro leader material, it looks like I can expect to have to throw down at least $35, which isn't cheap, as opposed to getting 150 yards on a regular spool of fluoro."
1502688,lassh,2012-11-08 16:14:00,553,"I use the Fluoro Leader material. It is harder and I assume more abrasion resistant. I used 80# and 100# up at Beteau last year and they worked fine. I used double barrel sleeves for crimping. Make sure you use a quality snap or snap swivel. The regular fluoro would probably work, I just didn't want to find out on a trophy fish. I also made some multistranded wire leaders that worked well."
1502975,Walleye Wanderer,2012-11-09 16:19:00,101,"Pretty much the same, I use fluoro leaders & Stay-Lok snaps for pike when I'm fishing in a location north of Nakina that can't be mentioned here. Started with 110lb and scaled back to 80 lb now with no problems at all."
1503324,pikeandtina,2012-11-11 10:41:00,145,"Hey guys, Mind telling me what size swivels, snaps, and sleeves you use with 80# fluro? We are going to that place north of Nakina also and would like to try making our own leaders as well. Thanks in advance, John"
1503336,Golden Eagle,2012-11-11 10:58:00,2642,Leader diameter and inside diameter of sleeves is available so you can match the size you desire.
1503438,Walleye Wanderer,2012-11-11 18:24:00,101,"I have had no problems using a #2 or 3 swivel and a #3 Stay-Lok snap with 80lb Seaguar, no sleeves just tie and glue."
1503445,pikeandtina,2012-11-11 18:38:00,145,"GE and WW, Thanks for the replies! J."
1490758,Mike Kansas,2012-09-27 10:49:00,1463,"Does anybody tie Flurocarbon leaders for Pike? If so what # test line, length and connectors do you recommend. Thanks, Mike Kansas"
1490763,zeebee,2012-09-27 11:06:00,1144,good article here:http://www.ontariofishing.net/news/dec2006-2.html
1490771,vteye,2012-09-27 11:22:00,812,Mike - I fish pike more thanany other species. I use big C house brand 40 pound floro tie 18-24 inches of leader using uni knots to connect to 15 pound power pro. The no stretch of a braid results in great detection of hits when the fish is coming directly towards me. I have yet to have a pike cut through thefloro but surprizingly have had pickerel cut it. I generally attach the floro to a 25 or 35 pound rated clip (1/2 a swivel) and then to the lure. I have experimented and find I get more hits not using the swivelbetween the braid and floro leader. Prime time for pike...
1490957,pike50plus,2012-09-27 21:26:00,584,I make my own with creeping sleeves. 10-11 inch
1491006,new hips,2012-09-28 07:06:00,498,"This year on the Attawapiskat River, We all used Floro leaders #75lb with Stay Lock snaps........No failures.......With a 43in PB Northern, I'm sold on Floro leaders from here on out."
1491041,5richards,2012-09-28 08:33:00,131,I use 50 or 60# F.C. and also use crimping sleeves -- works great -- no bite offs!
1497080,reconssd,2012-10-19 19:53:00,147,"Fluorocarbon leaders are the best and very easy to make yourself. I use 130# Seaguar, crimping sleeves, and cross lock snaps. Never had a bite off or failure of any kind. I will never use a wire leader again."
1497095,Golden Eagle,2012-10-19 21:31:00,2642,Same here and I use double barrel crimping sleeves. 130# Seaguar leader material.
1497117,Campcountry,2012-10-20 06:17:00,164,I use 80# for pike and 130# for muskie - and 40# for my spinner harnesses. I use the canoeman loop knot and coast lock snaps - hook doesn't come loose if snap fails and straightens out. The snap remains closed when it fails and straightens out. My own testing showed that duo lock and cross lock snaps straighten out when they fail and open up which means potential lost lures.
1497197,reconssd,2012-10-20 18:09:00,147,"I have not had a problem with cross lock snaps. To date, not one has failed me. Coast lock snaps work extremely well too. Bottom line, when it comes to fluorocarbon leaders, they are very reliable and very easy to make."
