1498973,Guest,2012-10-27 06:56:00,0,just looks like a crowded parking lot
1499054,Kwags,2012-10-27 14:37:00,48,Uhh - I don't get it?Can you expand on that?

Have talked to Dean several times, seemed very nice. Good prices and accommodations seem well maintained. Located next to the local boat launch. Once again, never stayed there but can't see anything wrong with it. Not nearly as crowded as some of the other places in that area."

1501275,mdsn,2012-11-03 10:39:00,121,I have only seen it from the outside since we use that boat launch often. Looks well kept from the outside but I can offer no experience with them.My only comment is that its at least about a 30 minutes ride from what is usually the better fishing areas. Unless you need or want to stay on the mainland there are many very nice island lodges right out closer to the fishing.PM me if you want specifics.
