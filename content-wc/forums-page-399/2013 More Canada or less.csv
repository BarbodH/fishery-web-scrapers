1498333,Ogoki,2012-10-25 05:20:00,291,"Have decided to spend 9 days (instead of 7) in June on a fly-in and just go up once . Gas and motel to go to Armstrong and back is now $1000 . Since just my wife and I go alone , we have to pay all that, as it is not split up with a group . For years I have gone up 2 and 3 times a summer . Want to do a moose hunt while I can still physically do it, so I will put some money aside for that . Plan a moose hunt in the next two years . Last summer I was up 3 times ."

1500663,Guest,2012-11-01 14:18:00,0,Hey all you South people Make sure you bring your own Potatoes......LOL
1500688,Bearing Man,2012-11-01 15:46:00,30,"I have not stayed back yet, although some guys that went with us in the past have bowed out.If we get lucky, gas prices will start to come down and help make the trip more affordable. The cost of travel, gas, meals, hotels, etc. adds to the trip, especially if you go all the way up to Red Lake or Pickle Lake.But the only way I won't go is if I can't find guys to go with."
1500966,SinOrSwim,2012-11-02 10:28:00,1528,"We have been going for almost 20 years. It was always a fly-in and for the last 10+ years was the same outfitter. However, the last two years that has changed to a drive in to Lac Seul. We can't get enough interest for the fly-in anymore where we used to have 4 to 8 guys with average being 6. We were struggling to get 3 or 4 so changed to a drive in and we had 10 the first year we tried that and 12 last year. It isn't really discussed but I'm sure cost is a huge factor with this. I do know a couple guys who had not gone for awhile didn't do so because they don't like to fly but for the most part it's cost. There is a huge difference in cost from a drive-in to a fly-in. I miss the fishing we had with our fly-ins but I must say I love having electricity."
1497824,Steve Ediger,2012-10-23 11:08:00,97,"People ask me ""why in the world do you go to Canada 3 - 4 weeks every year?"" I tell them that's all I can afford and I don't get more vacation time."
1497832,vteye,2012-10-23 11:26:00,812,Our group is back on track (7 years without a trip) and taking a first trip to ontario. We previously alternated between trips to Quebec (walleye/pike) and Alaska (trout/salmon). I am hoping Ontario trip becomes an annual event.
1497852,MrSimon,2012-10-23 12:36:00,922,"I am a firm believer in the old saying, ""where there is a will, there is a way"". People will always find ways to do what they really want to do in life. I put together a week long stay at a boat in outpost on a great lake for five guys this year. The all in cost was $800 per guy. If you can't find a way to come up with $800 a year to go to Canada, then you don't really want to be there."
1497964,bigwalleye1,2012-10-23 19:28:00,2632,"Death? I have provided for even that eventuality. Some of my ashes will be sprinkled in the water off the end of the dock at Deception landing on Lac Seul. That way, when everyone gets to the landing in the morning and fills baitwells for the day, I'll STILL get to go fishing, with lots of folks on lots of different spots."
1497966,bigwalleye1,2012-10-23 19:38:00,2632,"1860Angler, you've got mail"
1497992,Nimstug,2012-10-23 21:13:00,2605,I don't think I will be going in '13. My California daughter has been begging us to go with her on a trip so we will be in Poland and the Czech Republic. We are looking at early May. I am looking into fishing in both countries. Job situation would have to improve to get close to tenuous but ya gotta do what ya gotta do. NimstugAnyone know what the waiting time is to go through customs in Warsaw?
1498025,bigwalleye1,2012-10-24 05:30:00,2632,"No, but I don't think you can bring potatoes. Sorry, it was like a ""free one""."
1498072,bcmss396,2012-10-24 08:07:00,296,"I will be taking the family back in 2013 for 2 weeks. The kids would probably revolt against me if I cancelled. It's a great time to bond with the family and leave the world of electronics behind.Even with the price of gas, 2 weeks in Canada is less expensive than a week at Disney!!!Besides, it's a nice perk when grandma and grandpa can join us for a week for a couple of hundred bucks.Personally, I wouldn't miss it for anything. It's the only place I feel bad leaving.Blair"
1498086,skap,2012-10-24 09:17:00,58,"I take two short trips a year to Sioux Lookout and will continue to do so next season. I could stay for a week or so but would only be able to go once thus I usually leave on Wednesday evening and come home Sunday morning. Three full days on the water is enough to get my ""fix"" and its nice to know that I get to do that twice. We have taken a number of family vacations through the years to the usual places like CA and FL, but the fact is I would chose Lake Minnitaki over any of the places we have been if given a choice. Most of the time I am counting the days down until we leave but when I am up north I literally start to panic the day before as I realize I am running out of time!Have a great day all and good luck to those planning a hard water trip this winter! (working on one of those myself)Steve"
1498319,btmbncr,2012-10-24 22:12:00,492,"My wife and I plan on going to Lac Seul for 3 or 4 weeks,mid July to mid August.Offer both daughters and son in laws a week trip each.It appears that neither will be able to go.Bill"
1497768,Mike Kansas,2012-10-23 08:39:00,1463,"We are all aware that the economy has had a negative effect on fisherman traveling from the USA to fish at their favorite lodge in Canada the last several years. I'm wondering about how many of you that have stayed home are planning on making a trip in 2013. Also if there are any of you who will still not be there in 2013 because of economic reasons. Thanks, Mike Kansas"
1497778,camp chef,2012-10-23 09:09:00,915,Only death will keep me from me from fishing the Canadian shield.
1497780,tv4fish,2012-10-23 09:11:00,2694,Yeah - What he said (OR - if that happens to one of my fishing buddies)
1497785,onetimedave,2012-10-23 09:24:00,502,"Yes the economy has had an effect, but we are still going. Number 6 is on board for our trip to Nakina. We a flying out of Nakina on May 24th."
1497791,LOW1,2012-10-23 09:34:00,2828,http://www.pressdisplay.com/pressdisplay/viewer.aspxHopefully stories like this indicate that 2012 was an upswing year for tourism in NW Ontario.I'm looking forward to at least four one week trips in 2013.
1497793,Medds1,2012-10-23 09:35:00,18,"We have continued to go up through the economic problems. We have actually shortened our trip and I have picked up several small money saving short cuts that all add up to making the trip a bit more cost friendly. There are two of us that have actually saved enough doing it this way that we take the wives up for a long weekend over Memorial Day. 5 day trip; leave on Thursday morning, stay in International Falls one night, leave at 6am on the water by 11. Fish Friday, Saturday, Sunday, drive straight through to home on Monday. My Dad and I have gone up every year for the last 26 years. We have only fished together in the same boat twice, we are too competitive to fish out of the same boat. It is nice to have somebody in another boat that knows where and what the plan is without ever saying a word."
1497800,wallydave,2012-10-23 10:15:00,2151,"Part of my group will not be crossing the border for 2013. Instead they are trying to plan a grandparents trip, with less driving. My wife and I will be making the trip, not for a full week though! A little bit of Ontario Heaven will do just fine!! Looking for a 2014 trip, time for some new waters!?"
1497818,1860Angler,2012-10-23 10:53:00,2642,"I'm hoping to get to Canada more times in 2013 than this year. I'm having a problem getting enough people together to make more trips though! The economy isn't slowing down my fishing, just hope I can find some more fishing partners with the same attitude!!"
1497819,Babamel2,2012-10-23 10:54:00,414,"I might quit going, but I would have h____ to pay at home. So I guess I will force myself to continue going to keep the wife happy. She would not miss it for anything and makes darn sure that I am there to drive the boat for her. Since I am already in the boat, I might as well put a line in the water. Believe me it's a hard life, but someone has to do it."
1497821,wallydave,2012-10-23 11:00:00,2151,Hey 1860! Have you checked out the Share a seat board? There are a few others looking to keep a good thing going!! Good luck eh!
