He is registered as a guest and doesn't have the balls to have a profile. To the administrators, delete his post."
1503789,Larry S,2012-11-12 22:09:00,665,"Dwight & Dwayne are both good guys and will put you on Moose. The Guest poster caravan1 obviously has had personal problems with OPP officers,and anything he says take with a grain of salt."

1357534,Guest,2011-10-13 16:38:00,0,Give Lee a call at Wright's Wilderness Camp on Gullrock Lake. It's located just north of Ear Falls.
1357571,onetimedave,2011-10-13 19:09:00,502,Talked to Remi at AWO tonight. Said this was one of the best moose seasons ever. All groups got moose.
1359524,Guest,2011-10-20 16:45:00,0,"I'll call BS with that one.... I live in Ontario and Nakina is one of the MOST OVERHUNTED areas in Ontario. The weather this year was BAD....29 Deg.C and LOTS of Bugs...Moose taken were down across the board in Ontario. Natives in Nikina also make sure every year before huntin gopens up for others that they take more than they need. This area is hunted HARD... and wall to wall natives.... If looking for a place to hunt I would stay clear of Nikina regardless of what this guy says and totally and look elsewhere. Check out a different hunting form for Ontario called ""Ontario Out Of Doors""...It owned by the OFAH, there is a message board with hunting for Ontario. Just my 2 cents...."
1359623,Skyraptor,2011-10-21 07:12:00,291,"Well Davey, since you do not like the Nakina area, can you give me some areas or outfitters to look into?"

Call him at 1-888-847-0753 or 1-807-939-2911 e-mail is [email protected] Good Luck finding a Moose Hunt Larry S"
1366013,Mark R,2011-11-17 12:21:00,1538,I heard from Pat at Evergreen Lodge in Ear Falls. and they also had 100% tags filled 14 out of 14. That's alot of moose.
1366148,griff,2011-11-17 19:34:00,40,"""Also check out and call Dwayne Bolen at ThousandLakes Outposts out of Thunder Bay We saw many Moose flying over his lakes area while fishing this july.""Hmmm...didn't know moose can fly. I need to try some of that beer your drinking!"
1366262,Golden Eagle,2011-11-18 09:34:00,2642,"I suggest positioning yourself into a small group of successful, experienced moose hunters and take the place of a dropout on their next hunt. As a fisherman I've spent several weeks in camp during moose season. The regulars have much greater success than the new guy, traveling alone, on his/her first ever moose hunt. Is it possible to locate a camp that does not advertise 100% kill? All huge bulls?"
1354734,NWwalleye,2011-10-03 07:46:00,223,Bow hunting Or Rifle hunting ??
1354752,Skyraptor,2011-10-03 08:20:00,291,Since this is my first time I will be using a rifle. Not sure if I should go on a guided hunt or an un-guided hunt?
1354758,NWwalleye,2011-10-03 08:42:00,223,"I would suggest you look for a tourist outfitters in the Northern ( EarFall and up ) area of Northwestern Ontario, if this is the province you want to hunt in .. I have heard that Rene @ Sunset Lodge in Red lake has had very good success."
1354772,Guest,2011-10-03 09:53:00,0,Try Paul and Cheryl at Discovery Lake. They are big time hunters and will take one person. Truly great people that are passionate about hunting.
1355096,Mark R,2011-10-04 10:16:00,1538,I don't hunt but I do agree with teddi. Give them a call at Lac Suel Evergreen Lodge.
1355177,Skyraptor,2011-10-04 15:29:00,291,Anyone know of any sites that are devoted to moose hunting in ontario? Seems like considering this is my first time that I should go with an outfit that offers guiding service. Keep giving me outfitters and thanks for the help.
1355300,GNO,2011-10-04 22:32:00,153,"Kashabowie and Barry Brown's Clearwater West are the 2 best that I know of with great successs rates and fully guided professional hunts. I know there many other too, but these are 2 best I know personally."
1355318,Guest,2011-10-05 06:13:00,0,"Try calling Rene Franzak Red Lake Ontario Canada.Big Bull's and very good host{807-727-3474,Sunset lodge"
1357344,150max,2011-10-13 05:38:00,8,"If you want a good moose hunt try Dick Mansfeld at Winoga Lodge in Sioux Lookout and try to book his outpost on Ragged wood lake I shot a 57 inch bull a few years back a nd they just finished there hunt last week, shot 4 bulls in 3 days"
1357353,jrems,2011-10-13 06:15:00,17,"I'l second Wioga Lodge, Dick/Troy Mansfield. They hunt hard and produce the results, have been there three times and filled all our tags, both outpost and main camp. Biggest difference is outpost are Rut hunts, main camp is later. Word of advice with any outfitter is what/how do they hunt. Some have the idea that a quided hunt is lead you to a stand in the am and pick you up at dark. Dick loves the hunt as much or more than the hunters he's guiding. you'll definitly know you were hunting. any questions pm me"
1354430,Skyraptor,2011-10-01 20:09:00,291,Got the go ahead to do a moose hunt in 2013 and want to know which outfitters or lodges are considered good for a bull moose hunt? Is there a particular region of Ontario that holds a better moose population? What about success rate or size of bulls? I'm new to this and any suggestions would be great. Also any websites that are about moose hunting please share. I have until 2013 but need to start planning and budgeting now.
1354437,Guest,2011-10-01 20:49:00,0,try Kashabowie outposts.
1354446,fishforlife,2011-10-02 00:43:00,77,Are you a resident or non resident of Canada?
1354447,Skyraptor,2011-10-02 01:10:00,291,"I am a non-resident. Just looking for a good, quality hunt where the success rate is good for bulls."
1354458,phishfearme,2011-10-02 05:58:00,1242,sky - i know of at least two outfitters who are really only providing fishing trips to their lakes in order to justify their moose hunting addiction. dwight monck at north of 51 outfitters just emailed me that his hunters were 100% successful and he's closing his camps. the other is dwayne bolen at thousand lakes outfitters. has a number of flyin moose lakes that must be good also - this past summer he flew us to one for a day's fishing and proceeded to make me seasick turning the plane on it's side spotting moose after moose. give them a shot. phish
1354478,onetimedave,2011-10-02 08:07:00,502,Talk to REMI at AWO in Nakina. www.awonakina.com GREAT people and good hunting. If you are not an Ontario resident you must book very early. They have a very GOOD success %.
1354486,Larry S,2011-10-02 08:35:00,665,"I was on Dwayne Bolen's plane circling looking for moose,didn't get sick as phish did,since I was in 101st Airborne Vietnam. Saw several Large moose,and as phish said both Dwight Monck(North of 51 Outfitters) and Dwayne Bolen( Thousand Lakes Outfitters) have had,in Dwayne case 100% success moose hunting. These are just two of the Best Outfitters who can give you a great moose Hunt with an excellent chance of bagging you a Moose Larry S"
1354494,LeeMB,2011-10-02 09:09:00,83,Why limit yourself to Ontario? Check out New Foundland and Manitoba and other provences.
1354500,Skyraptor,2011-10-02 09:32:00,291,Thanks for the replies and keep supplying any other outfitters. Are there any that handle just one hunter as I will probably doing this on my own since my hunting partner cannot afford this type of hunt? Any that offer guided hunts?
1354602,teddi,2011-10-02 17:52:00,349,try evergreen lodge on lac seul in ear falls. they work very hard at the hunt and have a good percentage of kills.
