Due to my work, and people having babies in may, i have moved my week. When i called eddie, he understood completly. Said, ""no problem."" great guy. Hope someone fills this week."
1495614,wallydave,2012-10-15 07:26:00,2151,"Sorry to hear your plans fell through, I have a week at Goose Bay that week in June, sad to say I'm not able to fill that week for you. A couple WC regulars were looking to put a trip together with Eddie in the future. Some of his weeks in '14 and 15' are booked! He souldn't have any problems filling that week! Good luck with future trips!!"
1495653,Mike Borger,2012-10-15 09:07:00,1554,Wow that is a prime week! Sorry to hear you had to change your plans.I highly doubt Eddie will have an issues filling the slot.
1495716,GOBIG,2012-10-15 12:28:00,126,"Eddie has been very understanding. It was dropped on me last week. 2 people will be out having babies. I asked about June and the boss said NO. So, I will be up there Aug 24. We were licking our lures for the spring, but I will have a long wait now."

Well since I am there the week before, if no one else is interested I guess a second week wouldn't hurt as long as he has my log cabin finished c/w satellite TV, Internet, hot & cold running water, freezer, new Lund, etc."
1503138,Weby13,2012-11-10 09:33:00,57,Maybe Eddie will pay for my trip again if I keep giving him good reviews!
1503156,Walleye Wanderer,2012-11-10 11:20:00,101,"Hey, That's enough of that"
1503164,wallydave,2012-11-10 12:41:00,2151,At least Welby knows how to have And stir the Pot!! Not the legalizing thread!! Duuude!
