1496041,Mikeo2,2012-10-16 11:57:00,27,What cranks were working the best? Trolled with or against the current?
1496370,hangneyes,2012-10-17 13:58:00,25,"any new reports, heading up on sat. Looks like the weather isn't going to cooperate, so hopefully the fish do"
1496494,Topwater,2012-10-17 21:41:00,484,"Tail dancers and Wally Stingers are working for me trolled against the current. Leeches are working but are no longer availible locally (or province wide from what I hear), I haven't tried frozen minnows yet but it's about that time for them to start goin on minnows. Weather was gross today but I'm heading out early tomorrow"
1497683,Johnnie Candle,2012-10-22 19:44:00,1037,"Any news from up that way? Heading there for the full moon October 29, 30 and 31. Looks like I will need a lot of layers, but one or two 12 pounders takes the temperature up about 10 degrees. Should be just about right for the piggies I think."
1497703,Mikeo2,2012-10-22 22:28:00,27,"Slooooowwwwwwww to say the least. We just got back Sunday and there were very few fish caught, we had a few eyes, nothing big and no consistent ite, also hd 3 sturgeon. No one on the river was having much luck. Hopefully you do better."
1497922,walleyechop,2012-10-23 17:06:00,24,"Heading up the 27th through the 31st, Sounds like the weather is playing a huge roll in determining if the fish are going, as theyve had front after front! We mainly fish at night but have been hearing some good reports that the fish are going good on the days that are sunny? Hopefully the full moon pulls through for us again."
1498897,Topwater,2012-10-26 18:20:00,484,"Been fishing all week, happy with numbers but average size is way down. Been catching them on cranks, jigs/frozen minnows and still getting them rigging leeches. There are a limited supply of leeches availible at the co-op gas station by the Tim Hortons and Twin Marine has some jumbos as well (phone to arrange pick-up)."
1500357,PCDOC,2012-10-31 13:13:00,410,Our group was there for 5 days and just got back on the 25. One eye over 8lb for two boats and a few of the guys went days without a fish...... Slow to say the least.
1500934,Johnnie Candle,2012-11-02 09:32:00,1037,"I almost hate to post this report, but feel I need to. I don't know what happened between the 25th of October and the 27th, but it was something incredible. We fished the river the 29, 30, and 31 of October and it was nothing short of incredible. We landed 103 Walleye in the 3 days. Half of them were over 5 pounds, half of those over 7 and the two biggest were 13. 31 inches by 19 and 31.25 by 18.25 inches. 99% of our fish were caught trolling. We did fish leeches for an hour or so until our fingers got cold. Best lures were #9 Flicker Shads, Reef Runners, and the best by far were #12 Deep Husky Jerks. The Flicker Shads were great during the day, but not so much at night. Opposite for Reef Runners, Huskies worked night and day for us. Best speed was 1.1 mph on the GPS. Target depth was 20 feet. Best area was by the #3 sign. We did get a few nice ones at the White Rock, but honestly spent most of our time at #3. This was by far our best trip to Nipawin. We were nervous when we got there with all the bad reports, but it turned out great. Thanks to the Kingfisher Inn for the great hospitality. We will be back."

1493889,works2much,2012-10-08 19:26:00,17,"Is that a bad sign of things! Just curious on some reports from Tobin lately, heading up in a couple weeks!"
1493916,mrwalleye5,2012-10-08 20:34:00,1922,I was talking to a friend that fished the Vanity last weekend and the walleye seem to be just moving into the river system then. Bites were coming more frequently as the weekend came to an end. 63lbs took the tournament.
1495844,works2much,2012-10-15 17:43:00,17,"Heading up next week, anyone been up lately?"
1495995,Guest,2012-10-16 08:43:00,0,"Was up the first week of October, did very good. Pulled cranks the entire time. The fish should be in the river even more than when we were there."
