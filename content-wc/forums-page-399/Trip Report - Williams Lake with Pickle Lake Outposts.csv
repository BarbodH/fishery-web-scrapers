1459052,phishfearme,2012-07-08 09:07:00,1242,"We just returned from a 10 day trip (June 26 to July 6) to Williams Lake with Pickle Lake Outposts  owned by the infamous and proverbial Pete Johnson who is a fixture in Pickle Lake and has been flying bush planes for almost 40 years. This lake is a short flight northwest of Pickle Lake and should not be confused with the Williams Lake Lodge on Lac Seul. Our trip was originally planned for Neawagank Lake but the incredibly high water levels in the northern rivers (Pipestone, Pinemuta, Otoskwin, Attawapiskat and others) caused Pete to insist that we go to a top end lake where levels are only up a foot or two  fishing would be poor and somewhat dangerous on river system lakes. All of the Pete's cabins are the rent an entire private lake housekeeping, fly-in-only cabins and Williams Lake seemed large enough to keep us interested for 10 days so we reluctantly agreed. Neawagank would have to wait. We had done no preparation for this lake and went in blind. There was, however, a logbook in the cabin and it gave us some places to start. This lake is essentially three large lakes linked via narrows (but no flow) and all three are different. All, however, have one significant problem in that each has vast sections of very shallow flats that are essentially worthless for us structure fishing walleye guys and these areas freeze solid in the winter. And, one lake  the second lake  was almost totally worthless. The other issue was that the cabin is at the far end of Lake 1 with only one way to go to get to reasonable fishing. Walleye fishing ranged from mediocre in Lake 1 (in spite of some excellent rock structures), non-existent in Lake 2 (flat and shallow) and excellent in some sections of Lake 3. The further you traveled from the cabin, the better the fishing  both size and numbers  so we would trek to Lake 3 when the wind permitted it  45 minutes one way. The presents of the 10 man cabin on Lake 1 has clearly impacted the fishing in Lake 1  it was no problem to catch lots of dink walleye and hammer handle pike but that's not why we do fly ins. Some may find this acceptable though. Structured sections of Lake 3 however produced excellent catches of walleye that AVERAGED 19 inches  and this is a no BS number. We kept singing that famous Steely Dan song  Hey 19! One shoreline continued to produce even after hours and days of successful trolling back and forth. Largest walleye was 22.5 inches. We also got one 40inch and one 37inch pike trolling twister jigs in Lake 3. Leaders to prevent pike bite-offs were essential. I would NOT consider this a lake to go to for trophy pike or walleye. Now, for the facilities: Cabin  it's a 10 man, 5 bedroom old log cabin with lots of room for our group of 4. It had lots of nice features and lots of problems  some of which I'll discuss in subsequent postings. Lighting was provided by a small 110V AC generator  what a noisy pain. A 12V solar DC lighting system would be MUCH nicer  and it's already there for the water system anyway (which worked perfectly and included an instant on propane water heater located right next to the shower so there was none of those obnoxious delays in maintaining a constant shower water temp.). A satellite phone was provided and it would require periodic battery re-charging from a 110V AC source but using a DC to AC inverter for this infrequent use is a much easier (and cheaper and quieter) solution than providing an AC generator or, use a DC radio phone  it's not that far to the base. We also didn't need mosquito coils as there was a colony of bats living in the cabin with us!!! More on this in a subsequent posting. Boats/Motors  Pete provided two Stalker 16s with pedestal seats and complete flat bottoms and 25hp motors. These were the best bush boats we've ever seen  but one motor was a dog (I think due to water in the fuel which I'll get to later) and the other motor destroyed its own prop (which I'll also get to later). Luckily there were other normal boats with 15hp motors  but one of those motors also failed (would NOT operate at slow/trolling speeds) which I also blame on water in the fuel. We had to check the fuel bowls in the motor daily. So, why the water in the fuel?  Pete would fly-in 5gallon red cans of gas and pour them in to 55 gallon drums which had a hand pump ON THE TOP, OPEN TO THE ENVIRONMENT. Rain water (and there was lots of it) would run around down the side of the pump and also fall directly from the sky into the drum. He knew there was water in the gas and gave us a felt hat filter to filter the gas from the drums to the boat tanks. HUH? Felt filters water out of gas????? More on this in a later posting. The solution is to NOT allow water to get into the fuel in the first place but Pete has his way of doing things and I guess he doesn't think that letting us dispense gas from the 5 gallon red cans would be easier for us and cause fewer problems for him. I would offer this (and some other items mentioned) as evidence that retirement from operating bush cabins should be in the near future for Pete  stick to flying his Otter, he's great at that  and sell the cabins. All in all, an interesting trip. We fully recognize that shiit happens in the bush but this trip kind of stretched the limits. I have lots of other details  feel free to ask. phish"
1459068,greenie,2012-07-08 09:31:00,87,How much did this adventure set you back?
1459069,phishfearme,2012-07-08 09:34:00,1242,10 days were $1571 which included 6.5% HST (50% is automatically refunded by this outfitter - no application needed). travel and food is above this. phish
1459082,tooski,2012-07-08 10:01:00,393,Wow- thats a long haul to get those results. Really sorry to have read this report for your sake Phish but it is refreshing to read a report that is honest in its context. You probably knew when lakes got switched that things were gonna be going downhill. Thanks again for the great report.
1459093,5richards,2012-07-08 10:15:00,131,"Great and honest report. Really helps those doing ""research"" on this site. Not every lake can be the best lake they ever fished."
1459139,Larry Mac,2012-07-08 12:13:00,530,"Hi Phish, thank you for the very Honest report. No bashing just facts!!! Reports like that just reinforces the value and credibility of WC as a very creditable website. Thank youLarry Mac"
1498136,Bearing Man,2012-10-24 12:03:00,30,"Saw your post and thought I would comment:I have gone with Pete several times over 20 + yrs. and we have a saying: ""Pete is Pete"". We have come to expect similar issues although I must add that we usually tent-camped @ Mamiegowish, which is near Williams and a very good lake most of the time. Not for trophies, only a few 40"" northerns and 26"" + walleyes over the years.When we were younger we didn't mind roughing it on Mami and took a screen tent for our house, with seperate sleeping tents. Some years we caught so many fish (mid-June) it was insane. Bottm line, if we had warm, stable weather we slayed them.If you go with Pete, expect a few things like you mentioned but his lakes have lots of fish and you wil be the only one on the lake.Good luck."
1498336,Ogoki,2012-10-25 05:26:00,291,"Bearing Man, last June I went to Mamiegowish, and fised / camped with some friends . After fishing a couple days I felt that lake was good to catch fish but not great for trophies . You confirmed my thoughts . Had a real nice time but drove 1340 miles and still spent almost $1000 . Would rather add some money to that and fish the lakes I have been out of Armstrong and do better . I don't mind the camping part if I can get into better fishing ."
1498433,Fishoil,2012-10-25 11:06:00,1277,"I fished on the Pipestone north of Pickle Lake the week after you were up. It was my first time on that river system, so maybe I'm wrong, but the water level didn't look high to me. Are you sure that you got the straight story about water levels?"
1498437,Bearing Man,2012-10-25 11:26:00,30,"Agreed. I think it is too shallow for large walleyes, mostly 2-15ft. throughout. There is one 32ft. drop off to the northeast about halfway to the end. The best fishing on Mami is in the bay in front of camp and the channel towards the islands.I am surprised it cost you so much, is that for everything? Pete only charged us $300-$400 for the week when we went, although admittedly it has been 4 yrs. since our last trip there."
1498509,Ogoki,2012-10-25 15:00:00,291,"Bearing Man , that was everything for the trip . License , food , motel, bait and gas . Pete charged us $500 each including tax . Like I said on the other post , we drove 1340 miles each way . Always give the truck owner some extra for using his vehicle . Not as high as a fly-in with a cabin but if we had done better or it was closer I would go back again . A friend who has been there 3or 4 times wants to go again this summer but I don't think I will . He has never done great there , just plenty of walleye to eat and some pike around 35 inches . Worth the money but I like other lakes better ."
1498658,phishfearme,2012-10-26 05:22:00,1242,what can i say - the outfittter told us on june 26th that he just returned from neawagank lake the day before and had to pull the dock up out of the water even more than he did a few days earlier. i don't see any reason for him to give us bad info. and the water levels at williams lake were clearly higher than usual as there was little available shore line or sand beach available. we also flew over the otoskwin river where it dumps out of otoskwin lake into froats lake and it was a major rumbling brown mess. phish
1498659,phishfearme,2012-10-26 05:31:00,1242,"bill - as i mentioned in my report, the answer is to not let water into the fuel in the first place - but given our situation and the felt hat trick being new to all of us - we had to use the hat. but we were probably using it wrong - i think we let the last bit of water/fuel mix in the bottom of the hat for too long - so water did eventually drain thru the hat into the fuel tank. the last day of the trip, pete finally decided to demonstrate rather than just say ""use the felt filter"" and he threw away a large amount of the mixture well before we were dumping it out - he wasted a good bit more gas but did probably get the water out. key point - don't set your guest up to fail!! phish"
1499918,Bearing Man,2012-10-30 10:08:00,30,"We have caught a few NP in the 40"" range and 26"" walleyes. The fish in Mami are healthy and there are also perch there. It is a decent camping lake, with a short flight and planes going overhead fairly regularly as it is on the path to and from Pickle Lake.If someone wants a fairly inexpensive trip on an easy to fish lake, i.e. with kids, then this isn't a bad option. You can pretty much live in the large bay out front of camp and catch good numbers providing stable weather.That is why we went so often. I have paid 3 times more for cabins on other lakes, other outfitters and not caught S#%&t, compared to Mami, so I felt I should add another comment.In my years of going with Pickle Lake Outposts, talking wit hother guys going to cabins, etc. I can say that Pete's lakes generally fish pretty good if you know how to fish. But Pete does things his way and this isn't 5 star luxury.I would go again."
1498343,Bill Krejca,2012-10-25 05:48:00,6107,"Interesting report. sometimes things just don't work out the way we have pictured before hand. Re: Felt water filter - felt filters have been used for years to separate the water in gas. Dad used one back in 1926, when most gas for outboards ended up with water in it. Coleman, still (I think) sells a small felt bottom filter funnel for use in their lanterns. I have one, they do work, as I have witnessed. Bill Krejca"
1498396,MrSimon,2012-10-25 08:51:00,922,"Its not 1926 anymore, and there is no excuse for an outfitter to provide his guests with bad gas. There is nothing more frustrating than traveling so far and spending so much money to be hindered by completely avoidable equipment issues."
