We travel thru Wawa a couple times a season & always stop in town for supplies. Sad to see a town with an already down economy have to go thru this. Sections of Trans-Canada 17 washed away & the Ford dealership lot cut in two !Here's a link to a story & some pictures:http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/10...#slide=1692536 Fish"

1502236,Hawkfan,2012-11-06 21:27:00,237,Wow. What the water did to that road is just amazing. Good to hear no one was hurt in this event. Mother nature must be tuning up for that Mayan calendar prediction next month!
