1490348,fishinnut 3446,2012-09-26 11:04:00,638,"I for 1 have a potty mouth,but.......I do agree to many F bomb's!And I only made to 2:15"
1500041,ProFishingGuide,2012-10-30 16:06:00,6,"To all: I apologize for the F-bombs. I will be taking the video down and editing it together to get rid of them. @Outfitter17 - I'm David, the Oldest. 19 years old, currently going to school im Bozeman, MT. Ontario has a program that if you are a son or daughter of a Seasonal Business Owner in Ontario you can get a workers permit for that season. So all is legal. If we tried to hire another American it would be a completely different story because Immigration law states that we would have to prove that their isn't another Canadian that can fulfill the job the American is taking. @Lunker - The numbers aren't BS at all. @V-Bay-Gord I'm really un-knowledgable about lake trout movement. So thanks for the info! I did notice most of the fish we caught were on the way up or down from the bottom. We threw every fish back, and none of them were hurt. I understand trout are delicate. We pinched back the barbs on our treble hooks. The net we used was a basket net with a rubberized coating. Doesn't hurt the fish or remove scales. We had to pack everything into the lake on our backs, while draggin the 12 foot boat through the bush. Where do you get the idea we were horsing the fish? @Pikeslayer8 The fishing does truly get better every year. It was an awesome summer, we had great weather. Probably my best story from this summer was a group of guys that had a $500 pool going on biggest walleye of the trip. (Twenty guys at 5$ a pop). We have a spot on the lake named Lunker Island, because it constantly produces big walleyes. Going into their last day of their trip someone was winning with a 29 incher, that he caught at Lunker Island on the first day. So of course as the day wound down all of the guys wanted to go to Lunker Island! There were ten boats fishing in formation over one spot. 10,000 acres of water to themselves and they choose to fish over the same ridge. Again I do apologize for the F-Bombs."

My kid is 6 now, if my biggest concern with him at the age of 19 is a few f bombs while he's pounding on lake trout, I could live with that. There's plenty worse things a 19 year old could be up to.Definitely try and clean it up a bit if you're trying to promote your dads business though.Cheers"
1500106,MidWestFishman,2012-10-30 18:57:00,44,"Awww now I'm sure you didn't really mean that! I have never let loose of any curse words in a boat or any other place in probably 35 years or more and have fished with others that the worst words said was ""Darn It"" I have been irritated enough to want to throw my rod in the lake a few times though!"
1500194,v-bay gord,2012-10-31 07:09:00,3168,Hey Dave.......thanks for addressing the comments about your video. There's always two sides to a story...not just how a few (myself included) seem to interpret things. A few less f bombs are a good idea though.....I'm sure the next video will be better. Good luck fishing!
1489601,ProFishingGuide,2012-09-24 12:48:00,6,"I portaged into Bell Lake (NW Ontario, North of Shikag) to fish for Lake trout and found a killer spot. We ended up catching 20 in a 45 minutes period before getting pushed off the lake by some nasty lightning. This video is from Early August, I went back last weekend and we ended up catching 50 in two Hours, at the same **** spot. We couldn't believe it.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIpz7lAlOPA"
1489710,Limeyangler,2012-09-24 17:55:00,563,Awesome
1489741,v-bay gord,2012-09-24 19:10:00,3168,"The fishing might have been good but after three ""f"" bombs I quit watching....they did nothing for the production value of the video."
1489757,phishfearme,2012-09-24 19:34:00,1242,"i made the mistake of watching enough for about a dozen F-bombs to go off. other names for this video could be ""f'in' pounding the f'in' lakers"" or ""how to scare away potential clients"" phish"
1489767,v-bay gord,2012-09-24 20:04:00,3168,"I ""ef-in"" agree. Somewhere the respect for the fishery is lost in the ""f'in"" ego of the ""pro-guide"". But then again, what the ""ef"" do I know?"
1489978,@Lunker,2012-09-25 11:40:00,835,"Just the kind of chap a nice, young lady would want to take home to meet her mother.I ain't buying the story. First instance averages one fish caught every 2.25 minutes, the second is a fish every 2.4 minutes....horsing them out of 86 feet of water? Uh-uh. But, by golly, the guy makes an excellent fisherman, clearly pro guide quality, with the horse apples he can shovel."
1490116,v-bay gord,2012-09-25 17:27:00,3168,"I didn't watch the whole deal, but I wouldn't necessarily say the numbers are exaggerated. In the latter part of the season the lakers (in some lakes, it seems) can school up in preperation for spawn. They are sitting ducks at that point, and even a less than ""pro"" fisherman can hammer them. They would likely be in the 80 feet you mention but suspended from 50 to the bottom. Jigging a spoon or whatever would be effective. If Jay is reading this, he might remember I asked him if he wanted to come with me to fish a portage lake for trout last week........I went in this past Sunday with one other guest and we caught over 50 lake trout. A rubber net and barbless hooks are a must, and still I feel almost guilty ""hammering"" them in such a fashion. I think in those situations you really must acknowledge how darn fortunate you are, use common sense, and have a lot of respect for the resource. The ""f-bombs"" detract from that for me, but if I am reading that individual incorrectly, my apology. Jay, you would have had a blast.......and I don't think I would have heard the ""f"" word once out of you......."
1490162,LyleK,2012-09-25 19:47:00,248,Yup. Too many f bombs for me. These two are a couple of hillbillies with bad mouths at best
1490168,Outfitter17,2012-09-25 20:04:00,127,"The thing that raises a red flag for me besides all the F-bombs was the fact this guy says he guides on Shikag Lake, I am guessing at Moose Point Lodge. His Location says he is from West Bend, WI? The owners are from West Bend, but their kids are all young? By posting this link and drawing attention to himself he might be getting himself into trouble with immigration along with the owners of the camp if he is US and guiding up here. If he has a work permit it's ok, but if not - he might have opened up a big can of worms.If he was guiding at my camp with that language on film - I don't care how good the fishing was, it would be pulled immediately. He sounds like an idiot!"
1490182,Pikeslayer8,2012-09-25 20:52:00,1460,"Yup, imagine that, couple of twenty something guys in the boat having a blast catchin fish. The gall of them to let loose a few curse words. I'm pretty sure nobody reading this has ever let loose a few choice ones in the boat. David, Outfitter17 and Gord do have a point, maybe try a bit harder to clean up the language before posting videos on this site. The owner truly wants a family friendly forum. By the way, how was the fishing up on Shikag this year, any good stories?"
