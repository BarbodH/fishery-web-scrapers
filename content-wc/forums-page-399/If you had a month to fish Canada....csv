1498639,k80john,2012-10-25 22:10:00,53,LOW is one big lake! There is enough water to keep me busy for quite a while! Also thinking about black bear hunting.We fished 2 weeks in June and 2 weeks in August. It was great.
1498649,GreatWhiteNorth517,2012-10-26 00:37:00,286,I'd spend the whole time on Lake Winnipeg with the goal of a new PB.
1498815,vteye,2012-10-26 13:19:00,812,"I would spend a week in Ontario fishing walleyes and pike and:A week in Newfoundland fishing brookies, landlocked salmon and fresh runatlantics. A week at Anne Marie Lake in Quebec/Labrador fishing the giant brook trout - both bucket list propositions. Finally a week in Baffin Island char fishing: a 90 mile boat in, drop off tent camp reliving the first trip I did in 84 right after college."
1498879,Hunts1,2012-10-26 17:14:00,123,I like your thoughts on this.
1498891,castnblast,2012-10-26 17:53:00,111,"One week steelhead on the babine river in northern bc One week dry fly atlantic salmon on the st Jean and York river Quebec Another week of dry fly Atlantic salmon margauree river cape Breton island nova scotia One week walleye, pike and musky at home in NWO ...and a few days specks and lakers on lake Nipigon for good measure...."
1500461,btmbncr,2012-10-31 19:07:00,492,The whole month on Lac Seul last 2 weeks of July and the first 2 weeks in August.That's the plan for the summer 2013.
1500477,RyanK1,2012-10-31 19:51:00,244,I would jump in the boat with Aaron Wiebe and the Uncut Angling crew for the entire month. That would be one heck of a trip!
1502641,FrankLeigh,2012-11-08 12:53:00,80,"A lifetime is not enough time to fish Canada, but I would add The Campbell River area of Vancouver Island. I just returned from a week out there (not all fishing, unfortunately). There are different salmon species that run at different times, of the year. Both my daughter and I have caught 23 pound Springs and there are far bigger ones there.Lots to think about over the winter."
1490832,dutchboy,2012-09-27 14:18:00,5717,If the month was paid for? You can drop me on Wolliston for monster Pike and pick me up in 30 days.
1490843,wallydave,2012-09-27 14:52:00,2151,"....I must be dreaming, a whole month of Canadian fishing!! Sweet! I could see hitting a lake a week, muskie, lake trout, smallies, pike and maybe even a walleye lake that month! I can hardly wait to try to get some sleep tonight, dreaming I'll wake up North of the border!"
1490850,IaDave,2012-09-27 15:28:00,476,Hey Dave- You sure got the Canada fever LOL- I hope your winter goes fast. I have a countdown going also. 2017 can't come fast enough so I can spend that month or more up there. Keep up the posts I enjoy them- keeps me fired up for next summer.
1490971,Guest,2012-09-28 02:47:00,0,Dude you just need one lake ! Lake o the Woods !!!! Kenora . Also great area for whitetails if you plan to hunt. Bill mafturack
1490994,northernbite,2012-09-28 06:31:00,1186,"I know my cousin and I can't because after 2 weeks we start home. Also the key we find is 4 days a lake is enough , move on.Paul"
1491008,orchard frank,2012-09-28 07:18:00,1900,"When we retired, my wife and I spent 3 weeks at Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul. Easy decison for us, we had been going there for a dozen years by then. We liked the familiarity with the lake, great friendships with the owners and staff, using our own boat with all the gizmos, etc. etc. Explored a ton for new spots, fished our favorites as well, had a pretty low-intensity trip. Didn't care about how many numbers we racked up, but caught a million anyway. That was just us, others might prefer to change locations and explore new lakes. Lac Seul has many lifetimes of fishing available. We also spent 8 or 9 days at a high-end lodge for our 25th anniversary, Hatchet Lake. Great time,with fly-outs to outpost lakes etc. That was plenty of time (for us) in that type of set-up. Crazy good time, but wouldn't want a month. Lots of choices out there."
1491200,Hunts1,2012-09-28 17:36:00,123,"I would most definitely go to Lac Seul Chamberlain narrows area. It is a great fishery for walleye, muskie, pike and smallies. You could spend a lifetime there learning the lake and be successful all along the way. I have been there many times and always come back looking forward to the next trp. With that said and considering a month, my buddies and I have talked about that. We decided that going up for two, coming home for a week and then going back for two more would be perfect! Our wives would disagree. Part of the reason to come back after two weeks would be to make sure that all of our possessions were not on the front lawn. Great question."
1491243,Mudpuippy,2012-09-28 20:15:00,23,"I'm going to figure out a way to do this. Lac Seul would be the place. Walleyes in the morning, big Northerns incidental to really big Muskies.August would be the month, a houseboat on NE Lac Suel, would be the place.Now how much gas will I need, how much food, tackle ect. ect. ect. a couple pairs of clean socks . Yep we can do this.."
1491693,MrSimon,2012-10-01 07:59:00,922,"Great question .... a lot of fun to think about! I'd go in August. I'd pick two destinations and stay two weeks at each one. Each location would be a well equipped outpost cabin on a large lake with access to multiple smaller lakes. As to where ..... well I'd spend the first two weeks at the outpost at Happy Day Lodge and fish the big lake for walleye, bass, and some pike - then fish the bush lakes for big pike and bass. The second location would way the heck up north - Nakina area. It just seems the fish are bigger up there. Not sure which lodge - I'd have to research that a bit."
1491729,UKBDM,2012-10-01 09:28:00,178,"This kind of trip would be awesome because you wouldn't feel the need to fish daylight to dark due to only having 5-6 days on the water. I think I will be different than some and pick the last week of May and first three weeks of June exclusively in NW Ontario.Week One: Aerobus Lake - Lake Trout in less than 10' of water and only one camp on the lake. Never been there but have heard great things.Week Two: Wabaskang Lake - have fished this lake in late June for four years but would like to try it in early June. Big pike and walleye. My home lake so to speak.Week Three: Lac Seul - never fished this lake but it is on the bucket list. Probably fish east side from a houseboat or outpost cabin. Walleyes and maybe a musky. Hire a guide for a couple days to get acclimated to the fishing.Week Four: Caribou Lake - near Armstrong. My neighbor guided on this lake years ago and has a map all marked up. Underrated lake in his opinion. Oops, shouldn't have said that.When I retire some day or hit the lottery this might actually happen. Until then, I will dream."
1490597,lassh,2012-09-26 20:45:00,553,"If you had a month to fish Canada what would you do? Ontario, Manitoba, Work your way up to Saskatchewan, LOW, nakina area, LS, smaller lakes, Rainey? I don't like crowds. I do like fishing eyes, smallies, pike and musky (even a little trout fishing). I also like to catch big fish. How would you do it? Have any of you done this or spent a whole summer up in God's Country? I know that Pieske does this. What do you think? Would you concentrate in one area or roam around?"
1490614,zeebee,2012-09-26 22:19:00,1144,This is one big country and a month is just 4 weeks or 4 spots @ a week each. I'd start off at Tobin Lake in Sask ( eyes and NP)..week in and around Snow Lake(eyes and various trout) in Manitoba.Heading south Id spend a day or two fishin giant cats around Winnipeg on the Red and then off to a week in NW Ont LOW or Red Lake area (multi species). End it with a week on Lake Nipigon for brookies/lakers. I'd also choose August as my fav month for trophy fish and sparse camps.
1490634,blackxpress,2012-09-27 04:39:00,70,"I made my first ever Canada trip back in June. We went to Chapleau, Ontario and spent 7 days on Sideburned Lake. We caught fish until our arms were sore every day and didn't cover even half the lake. Sideburned is connected to Highbrush and Nagasin Lakes as well as a couple of smaller lakes that I can't remember their names. We could've spent a month there and never covered all that water. For that matter the fishing is so good there really isn't much reason to get very far from camp."
1490636,northernbite,2012-09-27 05:11:00,1186,https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...attach/jpg.gifThis is how my cousin and I due it. No crowds where we go unless we stop somewhere for more boat gas. Nice way to travel.Paul
1490694,nitrodude,2012-09-27 07:57:00,60,"I've been fortunate enough to spend 10 days in the Sioux Lookout area each year for the past many years and if I had a month to dedicate fishing Canada I wouldn't change my location one bit. I have fished several other places across the northern border and enjoyed my time there, but I've yet to find anything close to the variety of fishing destinations available within a short travel from Sioux Lookout. With the immediate availability to Lac Seul, Minnitaki, Abrahms, Big (and Little) Vermillion, The English and Sturgeon Rivers, plus an enormous selection of lakes interconnected, I can't find a reason to look elsewhere for trophy walleye, smallmouth, pike, muskie and various other species. The people are friendly and accomodating and you can have company while fishing or be alone at your whim by motoring a short change of scenery. I'm sure there are other wonderfully fantastic places in other parts of Canada, but I am very content in the area I've spent the last 18 years looking forward to returning to from the moment leaving Sioux Lookout."
1490754,adempsey,2012-09-27 10:28:00,963,"If it were me, that would would mean 4 weeks time and not a lot of money That would mean I could drive for up to 2 or 3 days and still have plenty of time for fishing. So, Saskatchewan or Manitoba would be a good choice and I'd likely stay wherever I landed. Hopefully somewhere with plenty of opportunities to fish various fish species and/or back lakes.ORI would drive out to western Ontario and fish 2 or 3 different lodges/outposts - maybe a week or so on Nipigon and the rest of the time on a fly in outpost or two (depends on what deals could be made). Otherwise, I'd go somewhere that had plenty of back lakes to fish so I wouldn't be fishing the same water body for so long.However, as much as I LOVE to fish, I wonder if I could actually fish 12+ hours every day for four weeks. Not sure that I could. So staying in one or two places on a larger lake has appeal for that reason as well."
1490781,2746,2012-09-27 11:56:00,3206,"I've said I was going to do just that before I leave this world and my plan would be to go to one of my favorite lakes (LOTW, Eagle or Lac Seul), find a deal on a basic houskeeping cabin and then liesurely explore a different part of the lake every day. Nasty days I can stay in and don't need to feel like I have to put in a 10 hour day if I don't want. I could try all the different techniques I've always wanted to but never felt I had the time and look for all the new spots I know exist but never wanted to take up valuable fishing time to find. Probably a two man trip ( it would have to be the right person) or my wife if I could get her to do it. Come to think of it, I'm not getting any younger so better get with the plan!"
1490801,tooski,2012-09-27 12:54:00,393,Great topic Lassh and for me a fairly easy response. I would take three weeks and explore Phishfearme's three favorite lakes. The final week I would spend on Little Vermilion because I believe it has the large northern fishing all year that Beteau only has in the spring....
1490815,Lovetofish,2012-09-27 13:33:00,458,A month of fishing in Canada would be too hard on my liver. I'll have to stick to a couple 6 day trips.
1490825,Fred_G,2012-09-27 14:08:00,908,I'd spend the whole time on Lake St. Joseph.
