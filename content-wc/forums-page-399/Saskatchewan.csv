Makes sense since walleyes are so common there.But I am adventerous and after going to Ontario approx. 20 times, I am thinking Saskatchewan for big pike. Walleyes are usually smaller there but I have heard bigger northerns are more common in Saskatchewan.I would appreciate feedback from those who have gone to this province.Thanks."

Our groups biggest laker is 42 lbs & our biggest pike was 32lbs. There is a strong walleye population that far north but we do not target them as the pike & lakers fishing is why we go there. Our biggest walleye was 8lbs. Very strong population of 20-40 lb lake trout. Pike are very numerous between 10-20 lbs. Our five biggest pike were 32, 29, 27,27 & 26.5lbs. Our five biggest lakers were 42, 38, 37, 36 & 35lbs. This is a big lake with great trophy potential."

Huge pike, great walleye and lake trout fishing. They said they're over 90% repeat clientele, I met one fella up there that has been going there for 28 years he said. I looked at their website today and they must be updating it but check it out. Outstanding value I'd highly reccomend."

1500829,bowhunter99,2012-11-02 00:16:00,218,i am from saskatchewan and you are correct about big pike and walleye... best time to get the real big ones is late march when ice is still on or first couple weeks of may when the season opens back up again and ice is off... pm me if you want more info
1500887,Bearing Man,2012-11-02 08:08:00,30,"Thanks, I visited their website. It looks like a lot of fun but a little too expensive at this point in my life, still paying down college loans for 2 of my sons.I have an older brochure from Hilliards Pine Island Camp, now called Pine Island Resort and this is more in my price range. Know some guys from my town who went when it was Hilliards and they had a very good trip.I also met Randy from Lawrence Bay Lodge at a show several years ago and kept his brochure. This may be a possibility, too.Appreciate the tip."

Our biggest is 51"". We fly into Saskatoon, rent a car and drive to Southend. The lodge's float plane picks us up there. The cost of the lodge runs around $550 per day."
