1499187,fishnutbob,2012-10-28 07:11:00,633,Its fun they hit like a freight train. Use a no stretch line for those trout like power pro especially if your fishing deeper water Pic of a nice trout thru the ice in canada
1499297,dhottle,2012-10-28 12:45:00,163,We get them in lake erie late oct-nov once the water cools down while fishing for smallies. Don't have to wait for ice season.
1499778,Basser,2012-10-29 21:30:00,31,Lakers in Lake Erie? I don't think so!

1500417,bigvenison,2012-10-31 17:00:00,15,Personally have seen lakers up to 35 lbs caught off the end of Long Point --lots of lake trout in L Erie which is 260' deep not far from there
1500871,Basser,2012-11-02 07:33:00,31,I stand corrected. Having only fished the western part of the lake I had no idea there were lakers. I'm glad to hear they are there.
1503516,TroyMansfield,2012-11-12 06:54:00,92,"I cant wait for ice up here in sioux lookout to go out and slam the lakers after the first of the year, we get some monsters out of minnitaki lake upwards of 35lbs , biggest one i caught was 43 inches through the ice. what a tank it was, never weighed it, just measusred and sent her back down the hole..... now I really cant wait for the season just thnking about it"
