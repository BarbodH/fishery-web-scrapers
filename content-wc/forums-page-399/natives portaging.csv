1500037,Mike Borger,2012-10-30 15:57:00,1554,"Most of the major waterways, especially river systems are historical routes that have been travelled for hundreds of years.Look on a map and see how many isolated native communities there are all over the north. For many of them a trip down or upriver is akin to us hitting the corner store for a bag of milk...no big deal.I've travelled solo myself extensively throughout the north, longest trip was almost 4 months and encompassed just under 2000 km's, so I can relate.As far as some of the natives creating problems vandalizing and stealing, I've seen my share of that too. But you have to remember in their eyes we're the ones encroaching on their land. Many of the issues that exist in these remote native communities are without a doubt the biggest social problem that my country faces. I fear things will never change though, at least in my lifetime. But that's an entire can of worms I really don't want to open.If someone is especially concerned about issues with natives on a fly in trip it's a simple matter of booking a camp nowhere near a native community. There's plenty of them out there."
1500044,Mike Borger,2012-10-30 16:09:00,1554,"No it's not. These analogies would only be good ones if the outfitters in ON have exclusive rights. They don't. Chances are pretty good for the most part that if you book a single cabin outpost in Ontario you'll be alone for the week, but there are no guarantees.If you want an absolute guarantee you'll be there alone you may want to consider Quebec. Many outfitters there have exclusive rights."
1500058,tooski,2012-10-30 16:47:00,393,"The analogy is simplistic at best and asinine at worse. As usual I get to wondering why some Americans think that since they are spending money the rules should be their rules. Conversely some Canadians seem to feel that the natives should harvest game according to rules set by outsiders to their culture. I agree that 90% of the fly-ins I have done are on some type of native travel route. The analogy that fits is Solo's ""hitting the corner store""..."
1500063,zeebee,2012-10-30 17:06:00,1144,"I'm sitting here wearing a big silly grin. You see as a Canadian who has spent countless vacation weeks in the bush and growing up exposed to the culture of the near north as it often referred to, you gain an appreciation of the Cdn natives rights to the vast wilderness known as Crown Land. Spend some time examining a map and you will find parcels of land known as IR's or Indian reservations. Remote native communities from which the local population sets out to fishing/trapping/hunting areas when and wherever they please. If your cabin happens to be in their transportation path....so be it. Just as there are no laws preventing me in setting a canoe in the waters and travelling anywhere on the waters I please. No one person in canada owns waterways and ""Crown Land"" is only occupied under permit by outfitters. It is a good situation. As for concerns of safety, I have never heard of foreign visitors physical well being or personal property threatened. As a matter of fact I guarantee you are safer there than on any street in urban USA. If it intimidates you...stay at a drive to lodge. Reminds me of a story a friend recently recalled bout a safari in Africa where the tourist complained the food didnt taste anything like back home...really? New experiences arent always offensive or to be feared. As for natives wanting to steal your wallets.....dont think so. On a moose fly-in several years ago I met up with a native trapper and his wife who had canoed across three larger lakes from their base camp also while moose hunting. For some reason during our conversation I had mentioned I forgot to take a lantern mantle with me otherwise, our trip had been goin well. He reached into his pocket and then remembered he had removed a mantle from that pocket that morning and set in on the table in his cabin. Ah well ..... they said goodbye noting the distance needed to travel back that evening. The next day after returning from the morning hunt I walked up to our tent and there...tied to the zipper was a couple of mantles. Based on what he had mentioned the previous afternoon I estimated they paddled some 15-20 mi there and back. There were several hundreds of dollars of equipment around including our wallets....not a thing was touched. Go figure huh. Dont develop the ""Ugly American"" attitude...there is good and bad everywhere and I have met with nothing but good while travelling the bush. The ""golden rule"" applies..treat em with respect and you will get respect back."
1500068,RickOnt,2012-10-30 17:24:00,217,"There are no 'Garantees'The best your outfitter can do is garantee you He has the only LUP(Land Use Permit) for said Lake. That means He is the only one allowed to cache boats or build a permanentbuilding on that Lake.On a bigger Lake there may well be more than one LUP or one outfitter may have more than one LUPThere are many Fly-In lakes that are portage/trail accessable.He cannot prevent canoeers or portagers (Native or otherwise) from accessing or paddling thru said Lake and I think? (Likely Solo will know) ""anyone"" can Camp on said Lake just no permanent structures or cached boats.Even you could have a visit from the MNR!!

1500245,v-bay gord,2012-10-31 08:30:00,3168,"Back to the original posters question. Coming from less remote areas (ie. the big city) it is an eye opener to realize that people travel in these remote areas via lakes, rivers etc. When I look at some pictograph sites on area portage lakes I myself find it amazing to know that hundreds of years ago some traveller has passed through, or called this area home. Considering that there were few humans around, and no towns, it makes you wonder what life was like back ""in the day"". As far as some of the comments about private property nature of outposts, it seems that some cultures may have a different view than ours. Where you would never consider entering a building in most built up areas, when you are back in the bush I think a remote cabin may have a communal aspect to it. In other words if you felt the need to take shelter this would be understandable. Perhaps locking up such a site is the wrong approach. I know many remote outfitters who purposely leave doors unlocked fully knowing that over the off season it will be used on occasion. I think that most people who take the trouble to canoe from point a to b would not fall in the ""vandal"" category. One can only hope for mutual respect from all parties."
1500953,SinOrSwim,2012-11-02 10:14:00,1528,"We did fly-ins for 15 + years and would periodically have natives pass through. Our outfitter told us if any stopped he has NOT given them permission to have any gas etc. My original thought was if someone stops and wants gas, I'm probably going to turn away and let them have whatever they want??? Maybe not but I'm not getting hurt over 5 gal of gas or anything else. (not saying I was in fear of getting robbed)We have had a couple times where natives stopped by our cabin. One was to tell us about 9-11 as we were in the bush during 9-11. They were very friendly but the rifles etc sitting it their boat were a little intimidating. I think it's crazy to expect a body of water all to yourself. You are remote but there are a lot more people in those remote areas than one might think."

1501229,go dart,2012-11-03 08:10:00,77,This thread seems to want to rewind civilization 100 yrs. For myself I could only honor a native choosing continue a tradition which his ancestors lived. We actually own nothing and will leave with what we came with.
1501312,Bill Krejca,2012-11-03 14:53:00,6107,"To go a bit to the lighter side, I read a book a number of years ago which was written by Eric Severeid (sp?), who later became a widely known news correspondent. The book described a canoe trip by him and his equally young companion. The trip, which was some time in the earlier 1900's, started in Minneapolis and ended up in the Hudson Bay area, I can't remember exactly where. The trip was mostly by water, with portages as required. Eric worked out a deal with a twin cities newspaper, where he would write reports on their progress, and the paper would bring in supplies by plane along the way, picking up his reports as the trip edged toward the goal. One experience of particular interest, as I remember, was encountered in the God's Lake area. At the time, and I suppose still, today, the area was a wilderness with few humans. Eric was portaging between lakes on a barely noticeable path, canoe perched on his shoulders such that visibility ahead on the path was limited. As he moved along, he bumped canoes with an equally startled native coming from the opposite direction. They both had a good laugh over the incident, the collision sending both onto the forest floor. After exchanging greetings, they continued on their way. There is no point to the story, other than even then at that time up there, folks moved from place to place, and occasionally ""ran into each other."" And learned to get along. The book in question, the title of which escapes me, is a very good read for those of us who enjoy stories of that nature, about nature and adventure. Bill Krejca"
1501315,JayM5209,2012-11-03 15:16:00,1050,"Bill, I believe the book you reference is Canoeing with the Cree. It is still available, from Amazon as well as other sources. http://www.amazon.com/Canoeing-Publi.../dp/0873511522.The trip happened in 1930."

1503535,TroyMansfield,2012-11-12 07:36:00,92,"best thing you can do when you come upon a stranger in the bush, be he white,red, a game warden or anything else, is you show respect for each other and your purpose for being there. your there to fish or hunt. not saying dont worry about your gear, but dont put yourself in a situation for grief. same as in the cities everyone should be able to get along, the bush is a vast wilderness for everyone to enjoy. some are visitors some were born there. lets just get along and go catch some fish and/or harvest a moose/or bear. Id like to think people can look beyond others differences. I am 3rd generation outfitter and I work to maintain a healthy relationship between myself, my clients and the locals of our area, meaning the natives or locals from town.... I have had guest suggest they cut up nets they come across, I tell them you do that youll wish you didnt, and youll be looking for a differnt place to stay. I dont tolerate such acts, Im not into netting myself, but its not for me to say either way. I have heard in our tourist memeber meetings about incidences such as that, and I am always first to suggest we purchase them a new net to keep the peace. no reason some ones rights should ever be viloated. remember it is illegal to harrass or interfere with anybody hunting or fishing if your intent is to interupt them. no matter what color your skin is. like anywhere and everywhere in the world there are good eggs and bad eggs, so hopefully you dont come across any bad eggs. no matter where you are As for natives portaging in the bush in the middle of no where.... thats what they do. they live off the land the best they can.... btw I hear loons are good eating from some of my native friends. but not for me"

1500552,bigvenison,2012-11-01 07:28:00,15,this might help you understand -- status Indians [ card carrying] in S Ontario have the right to fish and hunt any season or any limit from where the waters flow the other way [into James Bay] south into about 40 miles of NY State --they can do this on any private land and don't need the land owners or gov't's permission --the only place hunting is off limits is in parks like Algonquin [unless their band has historical rites ] and city limits --as for NW Ontario it likely is the same for that area
1500580,2746,2012-11-01 08:53:00,3206,"We have all stayed at drive to camps where the camp is shared with 35 - 75 other fishermen as well as the camp staff. Most of those cabins are not locked and I've never heard another fisherman show concern that their stuff might be at risk. When Indians are involved we become concerned. When we find ourselves in ""the wrong part of town"" we become fearful. A good friend has started a grain milling business in Afganistan in an effort to help farmers there. He and his staff are white Americans and are viewed with distrust by many natives. No matter who we are we can fall into the trap of fearing what we don't know."

I was told thats how you could tell if it was a native boat by the blue color.I should'nt of brought up why the outfitter wanted things locked up because this seemed to take the thread over. It really did'nt seem to bother our group as we have booked that lake for 2013. What I wish I had done was try to have some conservation with these people portaging, like trading some good grilled up Iowa beef for talk, stories, and info, maybe next spring I'll give it a try. I've searched the internet to learn more about these amazing portages, (and does each portage have it's own name) these people do,but have got nothing. So let this thread die, because too many took it the wrong way, and I'll continue my search elsewhere. Thanks and Sorry"
1500938,Mohleye,2012-11-02 09:39:00,368,"Matt, I don't know what part of Canada you were in, but there is a book named ""Yesterday the River"", which is a history of the Ear Falls district. It provides many anecdotes and history from the area in the days before roads or powered boats, when all transportation was by water and portage. You can usually find a copy or two on amazon, you might enjoy the read."
1500951,LOW1,2012-11-02 10:11:00,2828,"You have nothing to be sorry for-one of the interesting things about this site is that it shows the heights of people's emotions. Usually things stay civil, but spirited.I share your interest in the history of things. Two summers ago the Lake of the Woods museaum did a presentation on an alternative route from Fort Frances to Lake Winnipeg via the English River which did not traverse Lake of the Woods. Fascinating stuff. I recently acquired a 1930 (prehighway) topographical map of this area which shows marked portgage routes. It's set in a different area, but you would like Eric Sevaride's (sp?) book called Canoeing With the Cree. Sevaride is the now-deceased TV news anchorman. He and a friend paddled from St Paul to Hudson Bay when they graduated from high school."
1500296,Bearing Man,2012-10-31 10:30:00,30,"I have never had this happen in all my years of going on fly-ins. We did have a couple come through in a motor powered canoe once while on Grant Lake (L & M Outfitters). This was a retired doctor and his wife and they owned an island on a nearby lake and had come over for some lake trout. Obviously, they were not going to bother us and we gave them a beer and chatted for a few minutes.As for the natives coming through, I would also be very concerend about our cash and gear. That is a normal concern and should be understood, not to be racist. Anyone who has spent time in the towns up north can certainly relate to the problems that natives have and would be concerned about leaving their money and other possessions out where someone could steal them."
1500374,Mike Kansas,2012-10-31 14:12:00,1463,"While at a remote cabin on a lake a few years back one of our boats got lost and didn't know how to get back to the cabin. They saw another boat and franticaly hailed it over to them. In the boat was a Father, Mother and a young child all of Ojibway orientation. The father had a 30/30 carbine with him that we imagine was there to kill some fresh meat for his family. After our guys explained their situation the father picked up his gun (scared my buddies to the point of rapid heartbeat) he jacked a shell out of the chamber grabbed the cardboard remains of a beer six pack out of his boat and with the silvertip of the bullet drew a map for my friends on how to get back to the cabin. A fine gesture by a native who could have simply drove off and left my buds stranded. But instead he answered their prayers and got a couple rookies home safely that night. He also smiled when they gave him $20 and a big thank you. Mike Kansas"
1499964,matt31,2012-10-30 12:14:00,6,"Has anybody had any issues with natives portaging thru your lake, you are fishing? Just this past Sept. while on a fly-in we had natives passing thru pretty much the whole week, we've never seen this before in doing 20 years of fly-ins, it was a new lake for us. When the pilot to came to pick us up at the end week, he had us remove all the gas tanks from the boats so he could lock them in the shed. He said this lake was on a major portage trail and said things need to be locked or removed so that they would'nt be taken, made us wonder about all of our stuff, including wallets full of cash inside our cabin all week during the day while we were out fishin. Just wondering if any knows anymore on how this works with the natives portaging thru all that Canadian bush to get where and why."
1499986,2746,2012-10-30 13:22:00,3206,"Not sure how to take your post or what your asking. They are natives and they likely pass through lots of the lakes in their country. You refer to it as ""your lake"" but of course it's open to anyone who wants to be there. Why you would think your ""stuff"" is at any more risk than if your were sharing the lake with others your more comfortable with. Did you think the natives did not or should not portage through ""all that Canadian bush"" while you were using it? When we Americans are fishing Canada we are the guests.....not the other way around."
1499987,Guest,2012-10-30 13:22:00,0,"Story #1 We didn't have and issues, but did see evidence that others were there. About 15 years ago, on a fly-in where we were supposed to be the only ones on the lake. We found a campsite that was vacated less than a week prior. Saw where the tent was (matted plants), fire area, empties food cans, misc. garbage and a dozen or so used pampers. Also saw five loon carcasses. What's with that? It was June. Our cabin, boats, etc. seemed normal. We didn't see anyone else that week. Story #2 On another fly-in trip, we noticed a few inconsistencies with from our usual ship shape accommodations. The cabin ceiling had mismatched boards and the boat hulls had JB weld globs. The outfitter later told us that locals came before the season opened, and broke into the cabin via the ceiling. They took an ax and hacked holes in the 14' lunds. We never saw anyone. Story #3  Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore At a remote airstrip about 45 minute flight north of Winnipeg, we asked the operator about the holes in the Otter's tail. He explained that some of the locals from the reservation across the lake would get drunk, motor over in a small boat and take pot shots at the planes. Whenever he heard gunfire, he would get his rifle and shoot at their outboard. This caused them to have a miserable paddle back home. He casually pointed out that it has been going on for years and had not escalated. He purposely did not shoot at people, and they realized that. Local authorities would shake their head and say what are ya gunna do, O'l Bill has a painting of a Spitfire on his wall. Wonder if he flew one back in the day."
1500004,Hillbiehle,2012-10-30 14:24:00,66,"Not to speak for the original poster, but I can certainly understand his concerns and query. He has a valid question and shouldn't be critqued for choice of words. Renting a cabin, vs the context of owning the cabin...and fishing a lake at a fly-in destination in Canada, I think it would be safe to say that it is YOUR cabin and YOUR lake for the week in a hypothetical sense. One of the whole reason we go on fly-ins is not to have to deal with outside unnatural disturbances. I would be rather shocked knowing my personal possessions were at risk in such an isolated area when I see a pilot concluding our trip by locking up items due to the potential theft and it would likely keep me from returning at a later date."
1500006,Mike Borger,2012-10-30 14:38:00,1554,"But it's not ""your"" lake, hypothetically or otherwise.Outfitters in ON have commercial land use permits to operate their outpost camps. This doesn't give them exclusive rights. Myself I've done over 40 fly in trips over the years as well as numerous lengthy canoe trips north of Nakina and Armstrong so I can see both sides.Pretty much every single lake of substance in that region has an outpost camp on it.I laughed at the oftentimes unfriendly reception I received from guys who'd flown into a camp who felt I was encroaching on ""their"" lake. Give me a break.As far as the natives go you guys do realize that they live, hunt, trap and fish up there right? They're not transients LOL!"
1500010,Hillbiehle,2012-10-30 14:51:00,66,"To clarify, people are nit picking the original poster's choice of words. When you rent a hotel room...you don't say, ""where are the keys to the room of the hotel that I rented for a short term?"" vs ""where are the keys to MY room?""How about, eating at restaurant? When the hostess says, ""please follow me to YOUR table."" Do you stop and and clarify that you are not assuming possession of the table and that you are only going to be there for a short term?Make sense?"
1500014,Mohleye,2012-10-30 14:55:00,368,"I think most of us make the assumption that if we fly in to a lake to the only cabin on the lake, or portage into a lake where only our outfitter has the only boat cache permit that we have the lake to ourselves, however most of us know that's not really the case at all. The outfitter doesn't own any rights other than the rights to the cabins and or boats. Certainly any Canadian, native or not, can portage wherever they want, and while I don't claim to know the regulations inside and out, probably us Yanks can do the same in most cases, with the proper permits purchased. I'm not being critical of the OP, but I'm not really sure what his question is. No one can guarantee you that you have any lake to yourselves, because others have every right to access it."
1500027,Mike Borger,2012-10-30 15:32:00,1554,That's not a good analogy at all.
1500032,matt31,2012-10-30 15:41:00,6,"I did'nt mean ""my lake"" like in ownership it's the lake we are fishing. As for our stuff, if the outfitter wants things locked up, well maybe we should be concerned, never been to a non fly-in before, so always been the only ones on the lake up til this trip. My ""question"" was, I find how the natives travel thru that country going from lake to lake to get to whereever, and get themselves back to whereever, amazing, and if anybody here had any info or insight, or experience. Was'nt planning an invasion larry"
1500034,Hillbiehle,2012-10-30 15:52:00,66,I think it's a pretty good analogy and there is no need to pick his words apart.
