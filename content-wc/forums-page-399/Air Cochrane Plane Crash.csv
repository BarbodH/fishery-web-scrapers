My two borthers, father and I just got back from Cochrane early Monday morning June 11th after a wonderful trip. It could not have gone any smoother and the fishing was fantastic. There was absolutely no indication or sign at all of such a tragedy, everyone was in very good spirits including Mark Jones the Manager. Ironically I did notice that one of the Beaver planes was not present and that they were using two other air services to fly customers in and off of the lakes. It was so busy that we just assumed other planes were needed. I did however pick up on the fact that the pilot who lived on the property there at the air base was not around. Assume he was the one who tragically lost his life but not positive???We have always been so pleased with their attention to detail and safety. Our trips have been cut short many times due to the fact that they were not able to fly us out of the base to the various lakes due to poor weather conditions. Mark and his pilot never took chances!My thoughts and prayers are with the two who lost their lives, our thoughts and prayers are with their families and our thoguths and prayers are with Air Cochrane and all of their employees. We look forward to seeing them next year when we make our annual trip to one of their Lakes."

The pilot of C-FGBF that day I knew well and he was doing what he was told to do that day, not what he thought best. I have known him not to fly on a sunny day if snow is even forecast so to fly in conditions with 50 MPH gusts would have beena no brainer. The base should have told him to stay put and wait until the winds dropped (which they did) rather than risk such a tragic outcome. The TSB are still investigating so you might want to see what their final report says. You might want to ask yourself too about an operation that can lose a pilot, an employee and a plane on May 25th and then be all smiles and laughs on June 11th ....... hiding something perhaps ? That's your call but I know what I think .........."
