We caught lots, but nothing huge. We are going back next year. I talked to a guy that cut all the logging roads up there, and he confirmed that Biscotasing has lots of fish. The locals just want you to think it's fished out. Like I said, we caught lots of eating size, but no trophies."

1439565,phishfearme,2012-05-23 14:31:00,1242,it sounds like you didn't do a search on this site for this lake and outfitter - please do so. phish
1439588,TIGHTLINER,2012-05-23 15:21:00,223,You should have ask people on wc before you booked.. I have heard this is a fished out lake. Please put a post on wc when you get back will be very interesting. I do not know anything about the present outfitter.Please post.....
1439602,polaris-pete,2012-05-23 15:49:00,343,"I have fished both Bisco and Ramsey many many times. As the Owners changed over the Years, so did everything else, including the fishing.Both these Lakes get an enormous amount of pressure from locals and visiting fishermen. I quit going there many Years ago but do have some very fond memories and pictures to see the once great fishery that used to be there. As others have mentioned, do your homework before booking at any place. The places I fish now, the owners have quit doing the Sport Shows long ago as the repeat Customers don't warrant their going to the shows anymore. Good Luck on your trip. If theres anything specific you would like to know, PM me."
1439613,mcsteve,2012-05-23 16:15:00,13,I use to go to Bisco twice a year and the fishing was outstanding but that was 30 years ago. A few years back I was considering a return trip for nostalgia but after researching found much of the same comments mentioned here. Let us know how you make out.
1439836,BuckeyeATC,2012-05-24 06:24:00,88,If I was you I would portage into Indian Lake which is just to the south of Bisco. The walleye fishing is much better down there.
1440286,Berliner,2012-05-24 19:25:00,2,Thanks for the replies I'll post when we return
1446694,Hurkaman,2012-06-08 13:40:00,6,"We were up there for opening week. Check out my posting under Lake Biscotasing. We had a great week. We didn't stay at Ritchie's, but with Grey Owl. We were way down on the south end of the lake. Talking to some of the locals, they said the dam at Ramsey's was good - but be careful of the fish sanctuary and the rocks."
1446777,phishfearme,2012-06-08 19:03:00,1242,"this IS the ""lake biscotasing"" post - can't find your report. would like to hear how you did. i used to fish in that fish sanctuary before it was off limits and had some really good days (portaging down from ramsey when ramsey had no walleye) - but practically nothing elsewhere in the lake. thanks, phish"
