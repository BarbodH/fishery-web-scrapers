For sure they will last the weekend. ( Duracells). Make sure you take off the stupid fish ID. It doesn't work worth a crap with it on, but run it as a straight sonar, and its extremely effective."
520103,Guest,2002-05-15 14:15:00,0,I've got an Eagle SupraPro. I can run 4 to 6 (depends on air temp) 8 hour days per set of 8 D batteries. tgg
520093,Guest,2002-05-12 18:37:00,0,"Check out Batteries Plus stores if you have one nearby. They have small gel cells from 5-15 amps in 12 volt. Also what was neat is they have small 5v spiral cell batteries. They run about 25 bucks for the 7A battery. They also have the chargers. Kind of a neat place. I ran my portable for 2 days, no problem."
520094,lobo1,2002-05-12 19:01:00,734,I have a portable unit that I think is pretty good. I never heard of gel cells or I would probably have a set. I do know that the first year I took this unit north (5 years ago- NEW) I wasn't too sure about batteries so I brought two extra sets. Long story short - we fish 12+ hours a day but the unit is not always on. I have yet to get into the second set of batteries on a week long trip. Wish I could remember the brand on mine - I will be getting it out of storage for our trip in a couple days; I do know that it runs off of 8 D's.lobo
520095,Wally,2002-05-12 19:02:00,38,Just buy fresh batteries. Good ones such as Duracell. They will last you alot longer than two days.I did quite abit of fishing for about two months straight and changed mine out once during the season
520096,Wally,2002-05-12 19:02:00,38,"BTW, that was a FishEasy Portable by Eagle"
520085,Fred_G,2002-05-13 05:03:00,908,"I purchased mine from the local sporting ggoods store, however I have seen them in the Cabela's catalog. Here's the link to the online listing: http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/te...rentType=indexFred"
520097,Wawajake,2002-05-13 05:08:00,413,"I just bought another gel cell for my Eagle Fishfinder.My previous gel cell lasted 6 years and came with charger from Fishing store.But new battery and charger this time was listed at $69.00 Cdn. However this time I only needed battery so I took size and amperage to my local electrical supplier and compared to his listings for ""emergency light batteries for apartment buildings etc.I got a Panasonic sealed rechargable for $27.00 Canadian.part number for Panasonic was LC-R127R2PU 12 volt ,Same size as was listed in previous above post. Hopefully it will last 5 or more years too. jake"
520098,Guest,2002-05-13 07:33:00,0,"I use an Eagle portable and typically go through a set of 'D' Cell batteries once a season. I use the minimum number of options on the finder, for example I usually turn the fish identifier off (those blasted beeps just get annoying anyway). Take an extra set just in case but I'll wager that you won't use them. I use Duracell, but I'm sure any major brand would be just as good."
520099,lunker99,2002-05-13 08:53:00,236,Also have a eagle portable fishfinder. Put clips on the power wires so I could use a small motorcycle battery for power instead of the D-cells. Have taken it to canada several times and starting with a fully charged battery it has always lasted all week without needing charged. Hope this helps you out.
520100,ILLEYE,2002-05-13 13:04:00,127,I have a portable eagle ultra and use the D cells. I make it through a whole week of 12-14 hour fishing days and it always makes it until the sixth day. I wouldn't hesistate to use the D cells. Just take an extra set or two.
520101,Guest,2002-05-14 12:25:00,0,"I agree on the gel cells. If you can find one that fits in the emergency lights they have in many buildings for when the power goes out, that would be ideal. If you decide to go with Ni-Cad rechergeables, remember, they only put out 1.25 volts. Regular batteries put out 1.5 volts. So, in order to get the required 12 volts, you need ten of them. You will not burn out your sonar with 12.5 volts from 10 rechergeables, becuase a 12 volt lead-acid puts out 12.6 volts on full charge. I used to run my portable on a 12v motorcycle battery for three or four days. The one I used was about 3""X6""X4"""
520082,Wisconeye,2002-05-12 08:51:00,79,"Going on a fly in in June and need to keep our weight down so we are planning on operating our ""Eagle LCD"" fish/depthfinders on D Cell batteries. We have electricity at our camp but the boats donot have 12 volt batteries or trolling motors. Does anyone have anyexperience using portable LCDs on the 8 D Cell method. How long could we expect batteries to last? Rechargeables are an option but just wondering how long good non-rechargeables would last.I know there is a lot of difference in batteries, but assuming goodalakalines what could I get out of a pack?Thanks in advance."
520083,Fred_G,2002-05-12 09:08:00,908,"I'm not sure on the D cells, but my guess is that you will go through a set of them every day. I have used a portable set up with a gell cell battery. I always recharged the battery every night. It only took about 2 hours to fully charge. I think I could have gotten 2-3 days on one charge though. I was also running my GPS off of the gel cell. The gel cells run about $40 and come with the charger unit. I think you'd spend at least that much on D cells. AT least with the gel cell you could use it again next year. Just a thought. Good Luck!Fred"
520086,fishmaster,2002-05-12 09:38:00,209,Don't depend on the d-cells !!!!!!!!They just don't last depending on how long you are fishing they probably won't make it through a 12 hour fishing day.The rechargable won't take up that much room or weight take it along you go that long way for a trip why dissapoint yourself.Good luck and good fishing hope the ice is out by then.
520087,Guest,2002-05-12 10:45:00,0,"Last year we specially purchased an inexpensive depth finder specifically made for running on batteries(no 12 volt option). We had it on for 12-14 hours per day. We got through about 2 1/2 days per set. Now the difference in your case could be the type of display you are running. Ours was relatively small with relatively low resolution. The nice part is I dont care about seeing pretty pictures of fish on the screen, I really perfer to know depth and bottom type which we were able to get out of the low end unit quite nicely. In total I went through 2 sets with the third set about half way gone.If you have electricity at night just buy rechargeables with a charger and put your mind at easy.Bob"
520084,Wisconeye,2002-05-12 10:47:00,79,Where did you get your gel cell and charger? I've looked at few butno combos per se.I never even thought of this option. Thanks for the tip.
520088,WillieB,2002-05-12 10:59:00,292,"Wisconeye, Go with the rechargeable gel pak...it comes with it's own charger and is well worth the $$. Sending you info in re. Cabelas"
520089,Guest,2002-05-12 11:19:00,0,"I used 8 d-cells last year on a Garmin 160 vertical pics and they lasted 2 days. If you're worried about weight, carry the batteries in your pocket (along with your jigs). Have a good trip! Terry"
520090,Thumper,2002-05-12 11:25:00,133,The gel cell battery is a great idea. I run one but the charger is a milliamp charger and needs all night to charge. They are not compatible with regular battery chargers. Mine is a few years old and they may have changed but a sure way to ruin your battery is to charge it too quick or over charge it with the wrong charger. Good luck on your trip.
520091,AL,2002-05-12 12:42:00,89,"I purchased a new portable eagle unit this year. It runs on ""D"" cells as well. The outpost I'm going to does not have electricity so rechargable's are not an option. I will let you know how mine does. The other posts are right on though. I took an older unit last year under the same conditions. I could get 6-8 hours on a set. This new unit claims 48 hours of on time on one set. We'll see!"
520092,Guest,2002-05-12 13:52:00,0,"I use the rechargeable gell cells. They are rated at 7.0 amp hours.The avg. LCD uses .2 to .3 amps/hr. Most of these batteries are sold for ice fishing.They weigh approximately 6lbs and the dimensions are 2.5""W x 3.5""H x 6.0""L.You should be able to get about 20 to 22 hours of continuous use if you don't use the background light. They come with a small charger rated at 500ma. The one I have came with my Vexilar flasher but it works great with my LMS160.I bought a spare at Gander Mountain for a little over $20.00 this also came with a flasher.Ditch the D cells and go with the gell cell.Hope this info helps.Tony"
