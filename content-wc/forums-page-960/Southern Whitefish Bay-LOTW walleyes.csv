520064,darcyfish,2002-05-13 17:15:00,15,"I will usually use a 1/4-3/8oz jig bouncing it on the bottom, and this size of bait does attract a larger fish.I have also used white twister tails with a smaller minnow. Whitefish is known for its bigger fish (deep clear water).D'arcy"

520053,Guest,2002-05-10 07:09:00,0,"Every year I travel to Whitefish Bay and fish predominantly the southern half of the bay. Walleyes are my first love and are what I fish for 90% of the time. I have always had moderate success, but am still looking for that breakout catch and a trophy. I will be making the trip this year on June 22nd and was hoping for some tips to put me over the top. Thanks guys, good fishing."

520056,Guest,2002-05-10 13:13:00,0,"Oldlog,Thanks for the info. I will be quite a ways South of those spots, however. Anybody got any hot picks for the more southern portion of Whitefish?ThanksBill K"
520057,darcyfish,2002-05-10 14:08:00,15,What area of South whitefish are you guys fishing?
520058,Guest,2002-05-10 17:45:00,0,"Darc,I'll be staying at Calvert Island, which is South of Timber Island and North of Last Point. In the past, we have been doing most of our fishing over in Sabaskong, which means doing the portage. Any help would be appreciated.ThanksBill K"
520059,PWaldow123,2002-05-10 18:56:00,198,"Bill,Talk with Peg and Bob. They will know exactly where to go. Seems to be this early in the year, you need to get in some of the shallower bays just south of the island. If you need further info, e-mail me @ [email protected]"
520060,fishinnut,2002-05-11 05:41:00,642,I did well trolling some of the shallow bays in the evening. Trolled shallow running clown shad raps over tops of the weeds.
520061,Guest,2002-05-12 07:55:00,0,"Any more tips on specific presentations during the late part of June? Minnows, leeches, crawlers, crankbaits? What is the thought from people who have had experience in the whitefish waters?"
520062,darcyfish,2002-05-12 08:28:00,15,"In late June I try to target shallow humps 5-10ft for walleyes, Whitefish has never been a big numbers area for me, but a more of quality fish and it has lots of those if you can pinpoint a pattern.As far a bait I like to use sucker minnows that are 4-6"" long and bump them along the tops and sides of rock piles.Good luck people and maybe see you out on the water.D'arcy"
