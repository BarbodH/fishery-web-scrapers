519938,Russ,2002-05-08 09:08:00,17,"I'm looking for current information on ice conditions on some Saskatchewan Lakes. Specifically -> Lake Diefenbaker, Rafferty Dam Reservoir, Tobin, Candle, La Ronge, Pinehouse, Canoe, and Dore. Our annual May long weekend fishing trip is in serious jeopardy! Any information on open water is appreciated.Russ[email protected]"
519939,Peanut,2002-05-08 09:35:00,929,"As of this past weekend, all on your list (except Rafferty, which I don't know) were under ice. Although, Dief. should be open by May long. As for the others, I'd doubt it. To keep up to date on this, check the Sask. Fishing section of Go Walleye (I think the site is www.gowalleye.com) - there are message boards there set up kinda like WC, but with way less traffic. The ice issue has been discussed on a few threads there, and I'd guess that open water updates will be posted as well.Waiting for soft water like you,derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"
519940,Guest,2002-05-08 12:43:00,0,I talked to a friend of mine who lives at Sask Landing/Diefenbaker and he said the ice finally disappeared on Sunday. He said he spent part of Saturday fishing from shore and caught one rainbow until the ice drifted in to shore. I am thinking of heading down this weekend if the weather warms up.

519942,Guest,2002-05-12 21:20:00,0,"well there is still ice on tobin but it should be off may long hopefully, but the river is wide open."
519943,Guest,2002-05-13 06:50:00,0,I doubt if you will be going too far north. I talked to a woman from Tutle Lake Lodge and she said there was still 2 feet of ice there and that lake is 100 miles south of Canoe. I'm heading to Sask. Landing for the long weekend. Hopefully we'll catch some fish.
519944,Guest,2002-05-14 09:54:00,0,"Most of the bigger lakes north of Prince Albert will still be iced-up for May Long, including Lac La Ronge. Even the optimists are saying that the ice won't be off until June.Check out my website for frequent ice reports for lakes of north-central Saskatchewan:http://members.shaw.ca/napatak/"
519945,Guest,2002-05-14 17:08:00,0,"there are a ton of reports on pikemans board at http://www.westerncanadafishing.com.they have ice conditions, reports etc.A lot of guys have been getting out on diefenbaker, but the fishing is slow so far. From what i here, once the water warms up, the eyes should turn on.see ya on the water James"
519946,Guest,2002-05-15 06:45:00,0,Last Mountain is almost completely open now...
