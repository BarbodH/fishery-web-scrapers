Over the last 40 years at different times I have fished Fitchie, Hamilton and Badesdawa lakes. Last time at Badesdawa (Mud Lake) the water was low and the weeds thick, could not get around. Has anyone fished Menako or Pipestone from the campgrounds on 599 and what was the fishing and boating like there? Hamilton Lake is my paradise for fishing but the locals have driven out nearly all who camped there and it was quite a crowd 15-20 years back."
