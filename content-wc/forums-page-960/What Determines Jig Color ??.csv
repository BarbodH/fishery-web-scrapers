520125,Guest,2002-05-13 06:27:00,0,Going to Lac Seul second week of June. Have never fished there before. What is your favorite Jig color on Lac Seul and what conditions cause change?
520126,lunker99,2002-05-13 09:15:00,236,"What area of Lac Suel you fishing? I will also be up there that same week fishing in the Ear Falls area. I would have to say that color up there is mostly a confidence thing. Use what you normally use and you'll catch plenty of fish. That said, the combinations that we use most often are pink head/pearl twister and fluorescent orange head/chartruese twister. I usually take a good supply of pink, orange, white, char. yellow, and char. green leadheads and pearl, chartruese, black/chartruese, firetiger, and orange/chartruese twisters. Also don't forget the slip bobbers. Have sat beside jig fisherman up there and slip bobber with a lively leech easily outproduced the jigs. Good Luck!!!"
520127,Guest,2002-05-13 12:30:00,0,Thanks Lunker99....We will be fishing the southeastren part of the lake. Do you use jigs and twisters only or do you dress them with minnows or leechs? Have heard that Lac Seul is awesome Walleye lake...hope we can find our share...thanks again.
520128,lunker99,2002-05-14 07:16:00,236,"Usually dress with minnows, leeches, or crawlers. Have caught fish without tipping jig, but get a lot more action when there is some sort of meat on the hook. Lac Suel is great for walleyes. We don't see any of the true monsters this lake is famous for (must be the fisherman), but catch several 22""-26"" fish a week up there so who can compain. Good Luck!"
520129,Walleye Wacker,2002-05-14 09:52:00,6,Have always believed that if water is clear useing darker colors is best. When water is murky I like lighter colors. Fish them slow and feel the bottom but never have slack in your line....Catch and Release
