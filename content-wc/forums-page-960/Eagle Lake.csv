520040,Wisconeye,2002-05-11 11:53:00,79,"We almost exclusively jig, but do a bit of trolling with a spinner rig.The bay I couldn't think of yesterday is called ""Kenzlie (sp?)We went up into Bottle Lake via the creek last year and didn't catch any walleyes. Got quite a few pike throwing spinners at the shore.Lots of perch up there.We also went up the creek to Clearwater the last two years. Great Pike fishing in there and Lakers in the morning on jigs. At the far end is another lake you have to portage up to called something likeMcGregor or McKenzie lake. Tough pull up the rocks but there is some beaver cut rollers laying there to use (all work!) but got quite a fewwalleyes in there. Clearwater Creek will likely chew up a prop unless you get on a good plane which is tough to maintain because of all the switchbacks in the creek.In Vermillion Bay we fished around Boathouse and Round Islands and got nice walleyes- not many but nice. I've found this little better once the weeds got up so they were submerged about 4 feet below the surface. Before that it has been a slow bite."
520041,fishmaster,2002-05-11 14:56:00,209,Well Don I went and got my map out and the name of the bay is Kuenzli Bay?Or you might be refering to McKenzie Bay?
520042,Wisconeye,2002-05-12 10:41:00,79,"Sorry Fishmaster, just realized you weren't the original poster.You can ignore my private message.Once again, sorry- must have been daydreaming about BIG fish.Fishmaster, I sent you a private message that gives some other details.Let me know if you receive it o.k.?"
520044,Wisconeye,2002-05-12 10:43:00,79,Kurt:Send me an email and I'll give you some spots on the map viamy URL.You can email me by clicking on the icon up on the right of mymessage.Thanks
520043,fishmaster,2002-05-12 10:54:00,209,Thanks for the details will try out those spots down from the blue jugs and i do remember the one you are talking about now have seen guys fish this area but never tried it myself.Maps came through real clear.I will be able to mark these area on my map with no problem.Thanks again
520045,Pannyraid,2002-05-13 06:05:00,3,"Kurt,We have fished Eagle Lake (North End) the last few years and another north hotspot that hasn't been discussed is Iowa Bay. This bay also gets its fair share of traffic, but it can also be very fruitful with a good numbers of walleye, a few northerns, an occasional musky, and maybe a lake trout. Would you be willing to share where you caught the jumbo perch or anyother north hotspot that you know of?Wisconeye,It sounds as if you are pretty familiar with Eagle Lake. Would you be willing to share your secrets to another walley central user?Thanks in advance,Andy"
520034,DarrenB,2002-05-13 10:33:00,28,"No I live in Chicago, but have gone fishing up there nearly every year for the past 10 years. Usually we stay at the North Shore Lodge which is a short boat ride away from Spring, Mukluk, Boulder bay, Stanton Island etc.. and about a 20 minute ride down to Froghead and Lone Pine. Last time out we were at Evergreen, which is a nice place but a little farther away from the spring fishing spots that I know of.Last time out we ended up docking at the Century Lodge due to motor trouble and was told by a local that there is a rock reef, with rockpiles above the water straight out to the northwest of the lodge.You can see it to your right as you are looking out from the docks. Sure enough we hit that spot and caught several walleyes one day, with the biggest a 23 inch fish. Another spot to try that is good in the spring is Outlet Bay where the Eagle River comes in. Lots of big walleyes caught there along with a 35 inch Northern. A kid at our table also caught a 6 lb smallie there."
520046,fishmaster,2002-05-13 15:08:00,209,"PannyraidI have been fishing Eagle Lake since 1976 and just started to fish the North end 3 years ago this will be the 4th year.Those Jumbo Perch i can give you info on would be fishing Bottle Bay and if possible Bottle Bay Lake if the creek allows you to go up it, which sometimes can be a challenge with the Beaver Dams.Where are you from?That would allow me to tell you where you can purchase a bait strip that you use on a 1/16 oz jig and you will pull them in one after another.As for Iowa Bay i am familar with this site but have not fished it cause of the bummer of a ride to that area.If you need more info such as how to get this bait send me your e-mail and will tell you how to get it."
520047,Pannyraid,2002-05-14 07:17:00,3,"Fishmaster,I am from the Twin Cities and we are heading up to Eagle Lake this Saturday. Another spot that we had success in is the bay (Andy Myers Bay???) that Andy Myers Lodge is in. The back part of the bay has a nice weedline that holds walleye and smallmouth. Another option is to troll the middle part of the bay for some nice pike. Thanks for your help,[email protected]"
520048,Wisconeye,2002-05-14 19:19:00,79,Andy:Send me an email and I'll send you some information that I have.Wisconeye
520029,Kurt,2002-05-09 17:09:00,47,Anyone have any information on Eagle Lake on the far North end?Where are the spring HOT SPOTS for Walleye fishing.How is the ice coming?Any info would be great also where is the best Northern fishing on the North end.
520030,Guest,2002-05-09 17:12:00,0,"When you say the far north end, just what area are you referring to??Most of the resorts are located on the north end. Are you talking about the Eagle River area, Vermillion Bay, West End, Waldorf???"
520031,Kurt,2002-05-09 17:18:00,47,I am talking Vermillion Bay area and fishing down too Blind Bay.
520032,DarrenB,2002-05-10 08:04:00,28,"Some good areas that I know of are on the opposite side of the lake. The spawning grounds are down around Spring Bay, Boulder Bay, Froghead Bay etc... These areas are usually pretty good in the spring and we have had success fishing there."
520033,Kurt,2002-05-10 17:00:00,47,"Yea I use to fish out of Century Lodge and know The southern part of the lake well, has great Muskie fishing down on that end also broke a rod 1 year on a big muskie in froghead bay. Just started to fish the north end of Eagle lake a few years ago on openning week and just trying to get the heads up here found the perch HOT SPOT JUMBO perch to 16 inches have a great time catching limit in no time at all. Now if I could just find the HOT SPOTS for walleye and big northerns in May. Anyone else have any ideas sure would appreciate the help.Where do you stay when you fish Eagle Lake Darren or are you from that area?Good talking to you if you can get any more help would like the info?Thanks"
520035,DonC,2002-05-10 17:18:00,93,I recommend Osborne Bay for walleye in May. Hot Spots map is useful.Don
520036,Kurt,2002-05-10 17:28:00,47,Only one problem Don that is a little far for a boat ride to that end from the north end when you have a 25hp motor if you know what i mean.Just hope the ice goes out this week-end on Eagle lake. Have you ever fished the north end?Kurt
520038,Wisconeye,2002-05-10 18:50:00,79,"Fished Eagle/Vermillion Bay for several years 2-3 week of June.We had good luck on the windy side of Bottle Bay. Other good spotsto check are Back Channel, Detour Point. We made the trip severaltimes down to Muskeg Bay- it's a long trip but make a day of it and try down there- don't ignore the point just outside of Muskeg- there is an old cabin on the island and we have caught good walleyes and NICE Northern Pike there.I know some people do good in and around Canoe Narrows but we always went down the a cut to the east of Canoe Narrows. I don't remember the bays name, but if you go down towards the big part of Eagle try the easternmost pass and you'll see a blue jug- WHEN GOING SOUTH STAY EAST OF THAT BLUE JUG**ROCKS**, just after passing that take the next bay to the left and we caught a lot of walleyes in there."
520037,DonC,2002-05-11 03:55:00,93,"Kurt, I have only fished from Evergreen Lodge, south and east. Don"
520039,Kurt,2002-05-11 10:01:00,47,Know the area you are talking about Wisconeye fished the blind bay area also that is OK but gets lot of traffic in and out. Bottle bay area i have some spots there that i get giant perch. ever try bottle lake up the creek for walleye. I know there is lot of giant perch in there. never caught a walleye in bottle lake but never really fished it for walleye. last year caught nice size bass in bottle bay and one walleye. How do you fish for wallleye when you fish them?Kurt
