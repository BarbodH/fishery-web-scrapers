Highs Sat-Mon are no higher than 40*F (with rain/snow), depending on the location, of course. That's subject to change, I guess, but I'm packing all the warm stuff that I have. Hope it improves before Saturday!!Tim"
520212,Toolman,2002-05-16 06:17:00,2570,TTT. Don't get caught unprepared. The forecast is calling for lows in the 20's and highs in the 30's Saturday thru Monday. Being prepared can mean the difference a good trip or 3-6 days of misery! Good luck to all who are going up for the opener!! We'll be on Apisabigo Lake Sat-Wed.Tim
