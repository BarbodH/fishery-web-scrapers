520187,Guest,2002-05-14 07:58:00,0,"Here's the scoop--we're doing a flyout on Saturday (opener) to a lake slightly north (and east of RedLake). I am not too worried about the ice being out by Thursday, but they're calling for a cooling down starting Thursday (temps below zero at night for as far as they can predict). What are the regulations for landing float planes? Does all of the ice have to be gone, or can they land on a slight amount of ice (i.e., ice that develops overnight but then melts off by 10 a.m.)?Part of the problem is the outfitter doesn't have anyone coming in behind us (they weren't able to sell the dates) so I think he's trying to push our dates back. We can't change our dates because of prior commitments.Thanks for any info. Terry"
520188,Guest,2002-05-14 09:02:00,0,Temps might fall just below freezing for a brief period at night. But with even the slightest breeze there wont even be a hint of ice in the morning. You will have no problem with flying in! I just hope they have some pre cut wood for your wood burner you will be using that at night and day maybe? Good luck!!
520189,Guest,2002-05-14 09:20:00,0,I would check about the ice even being out north of Red Lake unless there is current to help it along. There is still ice south of there even though it is going at a good clip.
520190,Guest,2002-05-14 09:35:00,0,Thanks for the input. The lake is on a river system and it flows pretty good. The wood stove will definitely be stoked night and day! Terry
