519884,Guest,2002-05-06 08:56:00,0,I'm sorry. It is the Cedar Lake located just off Hwy 105 about 20 miles south of Perrault Falls.

519887,tracker,2002-05-06 10:26:00,91,"Try this site, I've purchased a few from them. They also have lake depth on them and are waterproof. http://www.redlakedigital.com/html/map_list.html"

519888,Guest,2002-05-07 05:21:00,0,Check with lodge owner about maps.
519889,tracker,2002-05-07 07:44:00,91,"Tim is probably looking for a map well in advance of his trip so he can get familiar with the lake and map out a few spots ahead of time. It gives you some confidence especially on a first time lake. Usually what happens when you get to the lodge the owner gives you a map, marks off a few hotspots, you take it back to your cabin and by the time you and your buddies have a few beer and mark their preferred spots the map looks like a connect the dot puzzle!!!"
