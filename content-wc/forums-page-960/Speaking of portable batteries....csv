520138,Pooch,2002-05-13 16:57:00,4619,Another post about batteries for portable depth finders got me to thinking. What would the amp hours be when using two six volt lantern batteries in series to get twelve volts. Each six volt Duracell is rated at 12 amp hours. Would that then be twelve volts and 12 amp hours? I'm now thinking that over several trips and years the rechargables may be cheaper. I can run two weeks on two six volt Duracells running a Zercom flasher mounted on an old Eagle battery box. But with a rechargable rated at 7.5 amp hours it looks like it will need to be charged every night. Or are they rated differently?Pooch
520139,luckyketch,2002-05-13 17:57:00,46,The rechageables should be recharged each night if possible. I beleive it takes approximately 30% of the time used to recharge it.Example: 3hrs use 1 hr charge time.Zercom has a charger that will not overcharge. Overcharging can be a problem with the cheaper chargers.
