520109,Guest,2002-05-12 16:37:00,0,Headed to Minaki the second week of June and I am looking for a place that offers jumbo leeches across the border. Any help would be appreciated.

520111,Guest,2002-05-13 11:52:00,0,Try JJ's Store (leeches) 807-543-3601. It is about 2 miles north ofHwy 17A on Hwy 596 going to Minaki. They are $28(CDN)per pound + tax. Call them to reserve what you need.....
520112,Keith,2002-05-13 15:15:00,48,Thanks for the information. Have you purchased leeches from them in the past and if so are they good jumbos? We are staying at Paradise Cove. We have stayed there for the last three years. Sure hope fishing is as good as we had it last year.
520113,Guest,2002-05-14 00:30:00,0,"Before you head up, give Duane a call @ Paradise Cove. He does have nice leeches for sale. They come from a different trapper than where Curtis gets his. Not trying to sound biased but I have found Duane generally has bigger/fatter leeches. I also think Ole Joe @ J.J's has nice leeches but sometimes isn't reliable. He is at the mercy of the guys who trap & they sometimes don't seem to be able to keep up to the demand. I'm not 100% positive, but I think Curtis gets his leechs from Joe. This is what I have heard.......but then again it all could be just hearsay. Duane only sells to his guests.Good FishenRobP.C # is 807-224-1107"
520114,Keith,2002-05-14 17:44:00,48,Thanks again for the info on leeches. I will be up there June 8-14. I can give you a report if you would like.
