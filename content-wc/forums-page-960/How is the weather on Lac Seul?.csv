519873,Guest,2002-05-14 19:40:00,0,Hey Winnie....Wife call Andrea today and she said the lake is pretty much ice free and Goose Bay should be ice free by the end of 5/15! That's great news! Did watch the weather channel and it appears that there will be another cold snap thurs-sat with rain/snow.Got the cold weather gear packed>hope it warms back up for the next 2 weeks! Bring your short pants and t-shirts!!MP
519871,eek,2002-05-15 01:36:00,72,"Brian,It will be great to meet you, it's always fun to make another friend. I will make it a point to see you there, maybe swap some lies and get a little wiser. I talked to my guide today, he said it was 70 deg. F and sunny. Also said the ice is all black and covered with water, should be gone by the time we get there. Further, he said the long range forcast is much better then it has been. He has a backup plan for almost any weather, and I have all the faith in the world in him. This will be my first time to Andersons, but is my 5th. trip to the GREAT WHITE NORTH, so when we do get together, you can bet I will listen very carefully to what you have to say... I don't think there is any better way to learn then time on the water. Next best is the man who has the time in, and is willing to talk about it.I will look forward to meeting you, don't drink much, but surely we will have at least some time to talk. Have a safe trip up there and godspeed. eek"
519872,eye_snatcher,2002-05-15 07:22:00,0,eek....looking forward to seeing you. I will be staying in my fifth wheel(Carri Lite/with Ford 250 PU) at Abrams Lake Park about 2-3 miles north of Anderson's. I will come over to Anderson's and look you up. I have a group that will be flying out of Anderson's the week of the 27th to an outpost. I have been using them for the past 6-7 years. They are great folks.Maybe we can get with Brian (another post here) since he will be there the same time you are. That would be fun to swap stories and places to fish. I have fished that area alot and would be glad to share with you where I've had good luck.See ya there...eyesnatcher
519856,Guest,2002-05-08 19:49:00,0,"Ice is away from shore in our cove; tried to cut with boat and 40hp, but still 6-8"" thick and honeycombed. We've got precip tonight and tomorrow then a great weekend forecast. Any luck we'll be open next week. Lake is open past Goose Island and the river mouth is open and should have tons of small males waiting to commit walleye fry suicide. Think positive and with warm weather we'll be OK."
519862,Winnie,2002-05-08 20:02:00,375,"Just did the math on the temps for the weekend. That is a range of 55-61 degrees for three straight days with sun. If the forecast holds up, that should do some damage on the ice. Look forward to meeting you at camp. We'll be there on the 25th. I expect a full report. ;-)"
519861,Guest,2002-05-09 19:59:00,0,Plan on callin Andrea 5/15 to see what she has to say...Might get postponed 1 week???? All depends on Mutha nature!Pray to the wind/sun gods and maybe a heat wave to boot!!!
519863,lunker99,2002-05-10 11:23:00,236,"Will be at golden fawn the second week of june, and seeing you all talk about this area is starting to kill me with the anticipation of getting up there. MP, we fish below the dam at ear falls a couple a times every week we're up there and always do pretty well. Also always make a trip to manitou dam, cause if they're in, the walleye fishing can get pretty hot there also. Just not a lot of room for numbers of fishermen there, though. Good luck during the opener and can't wait to be there myself."
519864,Guest,2002-05-11 20:56:00,0,Thanks for the input> running the river.. Is it just as hazardous as the lake? Where do you put in at?Still prayin like ##### for more warm weather!!!!
519865,Winnie,2002-05-12 18:48:00,375,"MP, Here is the latest from Ontario Weather....http://www.ontarioweather.com/foreca....asp?city=CXEA. Sunny and 52 F today, and either sunny and between 50-60 F or intermittant rain for the next several days, but never below freezing. Looks like ice melting weather to me."
519866,Guest,2002-05-12 19:54:00,0,On the other thread about weather: Ear falls local said that the lake was open from the Winnasaga River to Goose Island as of Friday.Got my fingers crossed...that the ice will darn near be gone by next weekend! Mother nature do your thing!!!!!!!!
519867,lunker99,2002-05-13 09:21:00,236,"MP, I never have put the boat in below the dams, ahve always fished from shore. Find a point with a good current breakline and the fish will be there. If you're wanting to put your boat in, I think the launch is on the north side of the dam in ear falls. You have to head down one of the side streets one you get into town. Maybe ear falls local can give you the street names, etc. For manitou, there is a fly-out camp right before you get to the hydro dam and I think the launch is there. Good luck and can't wait to hear how you guys do!!"
519868,eye_snatcher,2002-05-13 10:54:00,0,"eek....talked with a friend at Anderson's Lodge near Sioux Lookout this morning. She said the ice should be gone by mid week. Had rain and warm weather over the weekend. Bigger part of the ice is gone now and the remaining should go quickly.I'll be at Abrams Lake Park, just south of Frog Rapids on the 21th of this month. As mentioned in a previous post, the chutes are real good this time of year. If the water is high like last year, it will be good everywhere.eyesnatcher"
519869,eek,2002-05-13 18:53:00,72,"Eye_Snatcher,I will be staying at Andersons Lodge from 5-19 til 5-25, will try to look you up on the 21st. I fish out of a green/gold Lund Fisherman 1800 I/O (looks like a Tyee), ""Detente!"" May be below Pelican Falls on Lac Seul, but will still try to get there. Its always nice to meet another fellow Fisherman, especially someone from this message board. Good luck fishing, and hope for bikini weather soon...eekP.S. I am usually monitoring VHF channel 16 and 70 so if you see me, don't be afraid to give me a call."
519850,eek,2002-05-04 19:12:00,72,"After reading all the weather/lake condition reports and becoming more and more concerned, I wonder if there is anyone to give a report on Lac Seul's condition. I am leaving for Sioux Lookout on 5/18 for the Walleye opener, and sure hope that the lakes are ready to go. We usually fish Minnitaki and Pelican Lakes as well. Any information regarding any of their condition would be greatly appreciated.Thanks in advance. eek"
519851,Tom,2002-05-06 17:39:00,1063,You might want to check with your outfitter. I talked to ours last week and he said there was lots of snow on the ground and the ice was going out very slow. Hope they get some rain or sunshine.
519852,Guest,2002-05-06 17:54:00,0,"EekNo ice out info, but I have my first trip planned for 6/2/02... we are staying on pelican lake, assuming that the ice is gone, what can I expect for walleye fishing in the area?"
519854,Guest,2002-05-06 18:17:00,0,"Not much melt the past few days, days are warm but freezing again at night. The lake is pulling from shore very slowly; forecast is for moderation late in week. I think we have 1995 all over again, may have a few ice cubes at opener. Take care with the big walleye; there is bound to be plenty with spawn, remember they may be somebodies mama."
519857,Karl,2002-05-06 19:06:00,63,Talked to a friend from Sioux Lookout today. He said one windy day and/or one warm sunny day and it'll be gone. Ice is several feet from all shorelines and very soft. It should all be gone by this coming weekend. The boat landing on Little Vermillion is open.
519855,Guest,2002-05-06 19:11:00,0,"So there is some hope the lake possibly could be open enough by 5/18 to get a boat out???How is the English River below the dam @ Ear Falls early in the season? Might be plan ""B""? Prayin like ##### it warms up fast your way!"
519853,eek,2002-05-08 17:49:00,72,"AVSI am far from an expert, but am happy to tell you what I know.The last several years I have been there, the Walleye fishing has been very good near the mine shaft on Lake Minnataki (attached to Pelican) also near the bridge by Sioux Lookout, and if possible don't miss the chute especially just below the head of it.Bring lots of 1/4 oz and 3/8 ounce jigs, I have had my best luck with Firetiger color, clear line if possible, at least no bright colored types. Jig right off the side of the boat with a jig and a head hooked minnow, right on the bottow, using a very sensitive rod (I love my HSR 9000S GLX) and remember that most of the real big fish bite very lightly, so IF YOU FEEL ANYTHING AT ALL, SET THE HOOK.Last year the water was really high and the warmest I have ever seen it, in the spring. The bite was slow until we got into some current, then it was time to catch them, went to work and caught fish as fast as we could rebait our jigs. Plastic grubs, and even casting crankbaits worked also, in or near the edge of the current. However there are boulders the size of Volkswagons in the chute, so expect lots of snags and watch you boat control, I didn't even attempt to anchor, either drifted with the current or slipped downstream with the big motor.This area is best Walleye fish factory I have ever seen and fished, but you need to really watch out for reefs and for rocks etc., I would suggest that you get a guide and have him show you where and where not to fish and run. If you collide with a boulder or other underwater obstruction, you could be hurt bad. You can also fish Abrams lake, and the entire English River system from there, but bring a GPS so you don't get lost. If you come prepared you will most likely have the trip of a lifetime so enjoy it! I have fished all over the country (USA) and continue to return there every year.Tight lines! eek"
519858,eek,2002-05-08 17:58:00,72,"Thanks for all the information guys, I guess we will just have to wait an see what kind of weather the next week brings. I sure do hope that it warm and ice free. If not, we will just have to make the best of it. Thanks again! eek"
