5051921,The tank,2016-08-10 11:13:00,340,OtCan someone tell me how the road or road construction is from Rockford il to Fort frances. Wondering about 53 the most. Thanks.
5052017,Thompmd,2016-08-10 12:39:00,320,"Went through there from Indiana the first week in July, got into a mess around Madison going North. 53 was fine, nothing I remember that caused any lost time. The traffic around Madison on our way home that was going North was ok so it must have been timing for us. Good luck"
5052065,srk-low,2016-08-10 13:09:00,78,I returned to central Illinois from Sioux Narrows last Saturday. Very minor delays. Added maybe 10 minutes to a 14 hour trip. I'll try it again in three weeks!!!
5052081,LOW1,2016-08-10 13:19:00,2828,We also recently had no construction delays on 53. Troopers were out so watch your speed.
5053105,btyreprich,2016-08-11 04:07:00,1067,"We are currently at Evergreen Lodge leaving tomorrow morning. When we drove up last Friday, there was no construction on 53. It was smooth sailing. Now in Canada, highway 71 towards Kenora had several stretches of construction with areas of only one lane open. Those delays were not too bad however. If there are changes to road conditions from what I have posted above, I'll update. By the way, our fishing trip on Lac Seul is going along nicely. This year we are seeing larger numbers of fish, but not the larger fish we have caught in the past. In all, it's been a good trip."
