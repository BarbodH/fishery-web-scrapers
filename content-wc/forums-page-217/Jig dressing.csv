5050585,CycloneWalleyeHunter,2016-08-09 19:24:00,18,Getting to head to Mahkwa in about a month for our annual fall Lac Seul trip. We typically fish with jigs and either minnows or leeches. Typically we fish with naked jigs and the live bait. Just curious what type of dressing or tails people use on their jigs? I am curious as to which is more effective? Thanks

Have not used anything else with a minnow like twister tails or hair. Once in a while my boat partner does and I see no difference in our catch rate. Hos thinking is that with a tail of some kind, if the fish hits it and he loses his minnow the fish might hit it again with a tail on it.We used to go over Labor Day, but weather was too unsettled so we move a couple weeks earlier this year. Some years we like to froze without heat in the cabins and other years we were in shorts.Headed up next week. Cabin twelve.Pooch"
