5060313,FishinFreaks,2016-08-15 08:13:00,386,I'm happy with my chip's performance in my Lowrance overall. But what I've been wanting to get is a good paper map with 1' contours for Sabaskong and Whitefish that I can look over and strategize on when I'm in the cabin or preparing for my trips. What's the best paper map a dude can get?Thanks!
5060385,LOW1,2016-08-15 08:26:00,2828,I think you want Maps 6213 and 6214 from the Canadian Hydrographic Service available at most local stores in the area or from http://canadamapsales.com/en/catalog...I_B/index.html.Or strategize electronically here http://lakeofthewoodsmn.com/map.htmlThey may not have all the countours that you are looking for but I am not aware of more detailed paper charts.
5060609,pjshorthorn,2016-08-15 09:21:00,5654,"I bought the Hot Spots map for my trip this year to the areas you are looking at. The map number is Q272 and it includes both Sabaskong Bay and Whitefish Bay. The map is waterproof and has good contours marked on it with main navigational routes, navigational boys that are marked so you can follow your route against an actual bouy on the lake if necessary, reefs are pretty well marked ( there are many more on the lake that aren't marked on the map ), spots with vegetation are marked if you want to target those areas and about 52 prominent fishing spots marked where a short paragraph of information is provided for each spot. The GPS coordinates are also outlined for each spot. I found this map very helpful to do exactly what you described.........going over possible spots after dinner in the evenings. It won't give you 1 ft contours,but it is plenty detailed where you know that the depth is going from 10 fow to 2-3 fow. I think it cost about $11 and change. Shipping is free. The outfitter had 6214 map on his wall in the lodge but I enjoyed the HotSpot map to look at and follow our travels on the lake. Good luck on the trip. PjShorthorn."

The Hot Spots map is fun to peruse, lots of interesting, but generally well known information. When you get ready to start your motor, use the 6214 as the navigation tool, it has shows more spots that you don't want to literally hit than the Hot Spots map. Reefs, that is. Bill"
