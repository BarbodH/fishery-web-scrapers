In the original post, I mentioned that some anglers in our group had walleye fillets for shore lunch when they had their limit of walleyes in the freezer at the camp. The lodge owner advised that a Conservation Officer might view them as being over their possession limit. The walleyes at shore lunch were provided by anglers that did not have any fish in the freezer, thus were beneath their possession limits. There was a lot of banter back and forth for the original thread. Some of the comments were insightful - both positive and negative regarding the anglers being over their possession limit. I sent an email to the Ontario MNR, asking if the anglers in question would be over their possession limit. The following is a portion of their reply: Technically speaking, by providing your friend the two cooked walleye at the shore lunch, while he is in possession of the four walleye in cold storage, he would be breaking the law as he has more walleye in his possession than allowed for that Fisheries Management Zone. That being said, it kind of flies in the face of the intent of the possession laws. You legally caught and provided those fish for your shore lunch. Your friend is only having the cooked walleye in his possession for the 10 minutes it takes him to eat those fillets. It is very unlikely that you would find a Conservation Officer that would charge your friend for fish over his possession limit. The intent of the possession limits is to ensure a stable fishery for the future.The entire matter could very well come down to the type of day the Conservation Officer is having. As a group, we decided that anglers wanting to take fish home will keep an ""open spot"" on their possession limit. They will fill their ""open spot"" on the last evening of fishing.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

The MNR is dependent on the COs to interpret and apply the law on a case by case basis as they see fit to the conditions. Keeping an open possession slot minimizes the potential negatives outcomes a CO having a ""trying day"" may create in contradiction of the intent of the possession law. So be it."

So if a fish was mine legally, and I gift it, it shouldn't be any business of the MNR. But if that was the case, fishermen would be ""gifting"" their fish at the end of each day and could legally possess any number of fish. I'm not sure if the ""gift fish"" should even be in the regs, or they really need to clarify who may, and under what conditions, may accept a gift fish."
5040794,Bstar,2016-08-05 07:53:00,564,I don't understand why your beating a dead horse about this. It's pretty simple. If you want to eat fish at shorelunch during the week then wait until the last day to fill your limit to take home. Why take the chance of getting ticketed on a technicality? Better yet don't take any home. Are those 4-8 walleye fillets going to justify the cost of the trip? lol

The giver can then go fishing the next day and catch another limit. You cannot have more than your daily limit in your possession."
5054137,QuikNet,2016-08-11 10:27:00,237,We were checked by an Ontario Officer On the LOW out of Sioux Narrows last summer . He checked us just prior to shore lunch . We each had a conservation permit that allowed us to have 2 fish each . The officer completely checked us out and we were fine . The entire time he kept asking ( all 4 people in the boat ) each of us how many fish we had back at camp packaged to take home . Everyone response's was none . The Officer repeatedly said that he did not believe us. We continued to tell him that we caught plenty of fish at home and did not come to Canada to take fish back home but that we liked to have shore lunch. He told us that we were done catching walleye for that day and if we caught one it had to be released. He then followed us to the shore lunch site and checked the other 3 boats that we were meeting and found them to be in compliance but also the same question of how many do you have in the freezer . A couple of the boats had been Musky fishing and had no walleye so we still had just the right amount to feed everyone . We had an excellent shore lunch and returned to the water for more fishing . It was mid afternoon and the same officer came by again checked our live well which was empty . He then ask us the name of the Lodge where we were staying . He said that he was going there to check the freezer . He did not show !
