5051929,jsmyers,2016-08-10 11:18:00,198,"I'm curious to hear some tips from this community about how they go about pattering fish in the tail end of summer or early fall (pre-turnover).I'll be on Wine Lake (http://winelakecamp.com/) the week of labor day. I've PM'd a bit with HeHooksHimself who fishes the lake every spring. He is going to another lake the week after my trip and has expressed similar questions. (I let him chime in if he wants to tell us anything about his trip.) Based on reading the old camp blog archives (http://winelakecamp.blogspot.com/) through the years, I'd expect that the lake will turn over about 3-4 weeks after I'm there...Maybe a bit later as its been warm.My favorite are big northern. I have a pretty good concept of what they are up to that time of year, as they transition from a primarily deep life, relating to the thermocline, to a shallower existence as the water cools, and then eventually when the water is cold keying on the cisco/whitefish spawn. What I don't have a good concept of is how to nail down where on that continuum the fish are in a particular lake. What sonar, weather, surface water temps, or other clues from nature should I pay attention to to narrow my search?Sometimes, I'm happy to hit the shallow weeds to catch numbers of small fish. I fear the temptation to do so will be too great if I can't nail down a good pattern for the big girls.At the same time, I'm not a skilled or experience walleye fisherman. My understanding of walleye over the summer in the Canadian Shield is that they tend to get deeper as the summer progresses, and then will be often be very deep after the turnover. I don't know what patterns there are as the water is starting to cool before the lake turns over. Do they roam more widely?I guess I have similar questions about smallmouth, but they are both somewhat more mysterious but less intimidating, for some reason.I've read (and re-read) a number of Mike Borger's trip reports (http://www.canadafishingguide.net/reports/fly-in-trips/), especially the late summer/early fall trips. What those wonderful reports don't always help me with is how to take the clues I'll have around me when I'm on the lake and form a good strategy. I suspect for somebody like Mike--who has had more time on the Ontario water in the last two years then I will get in a lifetime--using these clues become something almost subconsciously felt.Any tips? Things to look for on land, in the water, or on the weather report?Thanks for the ideas!"
5052145,bigdaddyguns,2016-08-10 13:51:00,608,If the lake has whitefish and ciscos the largest pike in the system will be near by these forage fish. I have had success on rock points and reefs that are adjacent to or in the midst of the largest deepwater basins in the lake. Whitefish and ciscos roam the basins and the points and reefs are good ambush points for larger northern pike. Work the points/reefs top down with larger lures that imitate the forage base to find the active fish. Look at the lake maps to find starting points suggested above. On the water use your sonar and gps to keep you on prospective structure working the water column and looking for fish as the productive zones tend to be rather tight to the structure. Also keep an eye out for unmapped structure when motoring thru a basin. You may find a little known gem that holds fish.
5052881,HeHooksHimself,2016-08-10 20:42:00,725,"Jason, thanks for posting this. We are 30 days from our fly in and I have been wondering the same things. Of course I am not as eloquent as you and could never have expressed myself so clearly and thoroughly. I'm calling on you from here on out so I don't cause any more trouble! Best of luck at Wine Lake and say hi to Nick and the girls for me. I will look forward to your report. Tight lines! Fish On, Hooks"
5053297,zeebee,2016-08-11 06:24:00,1144,"Agreed. Come mid August and thru to ice up, troll large baits at depths of 20' across bay mouths, points and over mid lake structure. If your gear can handle it, 10"" Jakes and Gradmas will serve you well. The larger the better. Ive had sub 40"" NP's hit lures up to 13"".On another point, late fall transitions occur in late Sept/early Oct after turnover. Patterns that develop in August will hold for the most part until turnover."
5054337,jsmyers,2016-08-11 12:54:00,198,"Thanks for the tips!A follow up:Luckily, there are a lot of promising spots on this lake, but how do you define adjacent?For instance, there is a bay in Wine Lake that is about 1/3 mile wide where it meets the basin of the lake. The bay itself is largely pretty deep, and has some rocky fast-breaking structure ~3/4 mile from the basin. Would you say this is a good spot?Perhaps keying in on another part of your answer,Quote: Originally Posted by bigdaddyguns...the largest pike in the system will be near by these forage fish.I'll attempt to answer my own question: a spot in a deep bay, well-connected lake, or further from the deep basin isn't likely to hold the largest pike in the system. But that doesn't mean it isn't a good spot or won't hold some nice fish.But what about walleyes? Look for fish in the thermocline (structure or open water)? Does it not matter to walleye that the top of the lake (epilimnion) is starting to cool?It appears to matter for pike: http://www.in-fisherman.com/pike-mus...e-and-muskies/Look specifically at the graph in the 2nd part of the article. The top black line is the depth of 70 degree water. The bottom red line is the limit of livable oxygen concentration. You can see the large fish move shallower with the 70 degree limit before the turnover (the rapid drop in the red line starting in the beginning of Oct). I've got one of the academic papers this was based on. PM me if you want me to send you a copy. I cannot find the link right now.Quote: Originally Posted by zeebeetroll large baits at depths of 20' across bay mouths, points and over mid lake structure.

Other ones, like the spoons and Clackin' Rap may be more effective fished semi-vertically.Thanks again for the input...and I'd love more!I'm a bit more worried about finding walleye. Any tips there?"
5054921,Crackback,2016-08-11 18:37:00,257,"#11 and #9 TDDs deep Rapala Taildancers, Deep Storm Thundersticks and #25 and #26 deep Bombers, deep Bagley OB 6s and 8s Clown and Chrome, Gold and Silver with a black back are all deep water Big Pike Producers. Big Magnum wiggle Warts in gold chrome and old pre Rapala Rattle Tot-n-tots in clown and Hot Tiger have got me many a huge pike over 40"". 100 and 80 feet of 12# .040 line diameter or 15# with .050 line diameter with Berkeley BigGame. with get you down to 20-25+ with no problem. Hold on tight, 1.7 to 2.0 mph speed is a known killer. Rapalas 18s are nice and productive , but are used by me primarily at night since they are only shallow diving to 8 feet, but my fishing buddy has used 1.5 and 2 once trolling keel sinkers 3 foot above to get them down and has down REAL well. Florescent orange back and silver with black back are top colors too. Adjust your line out to match your targeted trolling depth according the dive chart when you find the depth of the suspended smelt, and/or ciscoes Good wide beam transducers are your friend to locate the Ciscoes. Another good lure I use often that hasn't been made in 20 plus years is that tough Big Lindy 6 inch deep Shadling and Baitfish....I bought them when they were cheap but now they go for $15 bucks apiece used. When they were in production they used to be $5.99 all day long anywhere. Many times you could find them half price in the bargain bins and paint them yourself to the new hot custom colors, which I did with a an air brush. The white sucker with the black back is a killer as is the Red headed one. I'm sure glad I'm sitting on 30 of each Lindy baits as they have slammed some big walleye too while fishing deep water in Lake Erie south of Erieau, Ontario east of Windsor. Steelhead like the Rapala Taildancers too. I just invested in a complete set of all the colors and 2 each of the foreign colored Taildancers and all the hot colors that aren't available in the U.S., but My Malaysian contact got me a great deal on 80 of them in 7, 9 11s. My wife would faint if she knew what I spent on them. You start investing in these light musky type lures and you will go broke. ....But they whack BIg Pike....and it is no problem if you got a trolling plan together with good fishing finding electronics."

5057170,bigdaddyguns,2016-08-13 10:29:00,608,"Any structural element that protrudes or is present near deep water of the basin where the roaming baitfish may come in contact and either be ambushed or pinned up against by predators.Quote: Originally Posted by jsmyersI'll attempt to answer my own question: a spot in a deep bay, well-connected lake, or further from the deep basin isn't likely to hold the largest pike in the system. But that doesn't mean it isn't a good spot or won't hold some nice fish.The premise around ""largest"" fish in the system is based on access and availability of the nutritional density of the forage base. If northerns are relating to weed beds or shallower bays they can grow to nice sizes however the numbers will decrease and as well as length of time to grow increase based on a minnows and perch, etc forage base. The in-fisherman article you posted provides some evidence of those relationships between size, locations, depths, and forage bases. Quote: Originally Posted by jsmyersBut what about walleyes? Look for fish in the thermocline (structure or open water)? Does it not matter to walleye that the top of the lake (epilimnion) is starting to cool?I have fished canadian shield lakes from mid june thru mid august.The general trend i have noticed is as the summer ages walleyes tend to school tighter to structure and deeper. Verticle jigging is one way to work a school once you find them. They tend to be more transient based on wind and weather conditions. Also try some wind-blown weed edges as those can be productive at times. Talk with you camp owner for some starting points and as I have found walleye patterns to be much more dynamic.

You will need to present them deeper than if you were targeting muskies. I have had more success with sinking body and swim baits than bucktails for northerns on these basin structures. Bucktails seem better on weedlines for me as I suspect bucktails are difficult to stay in the presentation zone for any length of time."
