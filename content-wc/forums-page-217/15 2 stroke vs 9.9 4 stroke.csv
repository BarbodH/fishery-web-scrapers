5049753,1K1MOA,2016-08-09 12:20:00,90,"I put a new Yamaha 9.9 4 stroke on an older 14' Lund and used this year in Canada for a week. The Lund is 190#, the two guys were 200# each, the gear (anchor, etc. etc.) was another 100# and the motor (84#) plus 15# for 3 gallons gas. Total was about 800#. It planed great (middle seat is gone for room, guy in front) and we cruised in the mid teens no problem (speed is a guess since didn't check with GPS, arrggghhh). What will knock your socks off is we ran down a five mile lake at speed, trolled, drifted and fished all day and ran back at speed...on about 1.5 gallons of gas with that weight. Albeit conditions were calm; if it were rough, it could dramatically affect gas mileage. Starts on one pull, no need for electric start as far as I am concerned. I thought about a 15 or 20hp 4 stroke at 104# (same weight motors) but decided not to since most Canadian lakes I fish generally are not bigger than five miles or so to cross, and I didn't feel the extra speed would be that big a deal. Hull plate states 20HP max.Oh, and the motor also has a Rock Hopper rock guard on it. BTW- I hit a giant granite boulder in 20' of water which with the chop and light I didn't see under the water, and I am REALLY GLAD I put it on. That probably affects performance a bit too."

5043778,fsz,2016-08-06 15:13:00,144,"Id like to get a brand new motor. The 15 4strokes are too heavy for my 14' camp boats. This leaves 9.9. I have a 15 2 stroke but would like the advantages of a four stroke plus electric start. I could add that on current motorbut its is already 20 years old might as well put the $ into a new one. Anyway, the question I have is how much am I really giving up top end speed wise between a 15 2 stroke and a 9.9 4 stroke? We sometimes run 3 to a boat which makes for a total load boat, motor and gear of around 900lb."
5043802,forgop,2016-08-06 15:27:00,880,"I cannot compare by any means, but my fishfinder reported a top speed of 19 mph using a 15hp a couple of weeks ago when it was just myself in the boat. Seemed pretty good to me. Sent from my SM-G935V using Tapatalk"
5044170,Guest,2016-08-06 22:24:00,0,"Really can't tell you without knowing what kind of boats you have. Probably just lose a few mph if you have jon boats. But if you have bee hulls, it the 9.9 might not even plane it out. 900# is quite a load in a 14'. How many HP are the boats rated for?"
5044178,Guest,2016-08-06 22:27:00,0,"That would be VEEE !!! hull. Oh, and I will never ever contact progressive for a quote."
5044394,Guest,2016-08-07 06:02:00,0,"Suzuki 9.9-15 horse same engine,electric start 106 pounds. Evenrude 9.9 80lbs, Evinrude 15 114lbs. 26 lbs difference between 9.9 Evinrude and 15 Suzuki I don't think you'd notice."
5044834,kzoofisher,2016-08-07 09:15:00,5144,I've got a 16' Alumacraft deep V rated for 40hp. With a 9.9 Merc 4stroke it will make 13 mph with two people and 9.5mph with three. Never had a 15 on it but from what I have heard you can upgrade the 9.9 to 15 with a carb change and it makes almost no difference in speed. I have also heard that on many boats the transom rating is based on two stroke weights and you have to compare the weight of a four stroke to the weight of max hp two stroke. A friend has 1800 fisherman and was advised by the dealer that if he changed his 115 2S to a 4S he would have to drop HP. I would definitely find out what the max transom weight is for your boats.
5044906,fsz,2016-08-07 09:28:00,144,"The boat/boats are v hull , not rated for motors heavier than 85lbs. So anything heavier is out."
5045874,Guest,2016-08-07 18:15:00,0,"I've seen lots 1800 fishermans with 150 four strokes and kicker motors, I had a 1700 fisherman with a 140 four stroke and a kicker, wonder why that 1800 was rated so low?"
5046842,v-bay gord,2016-08-08 07:13:00,3168,"In my experience the smaller 4 strokes seem to bog down with weight sooner than a comparable 2 stroke...........so going from a 15 2-stroke to a 9.9 4-stroke would be a mistake in my opinion considering the weight (900 pounds) you plan on carrying........unless you're not concerned with speed. On one of my portage lakes I replaced 15 hp Johnson 2-stroke motors with 9.9 Yamaha 2-stroke motors and was pleased with the performance of the smaller engine. Perhaps you could find a newer 2 stroke 9.9 rather than going the 4 stroke route? Fully loaded though, you will likely notice the difference in speed......"
5049729,Lake Wisconsin,2016-08-09 12:10:00,1960,"I agree with others, you will notice a difference. The 2 strokes are lighter and ""rev"" better than the 4 stroke counterparts. If you are just able to get on speed with the current motor, expect not to with the lower horse 4 stroke."
