Started going there as a small boy in 1962, fished it once or twice a year till 10 years ago, was back last year and caught a ton of small mouth bass which never used to be in the lake in the beginning. My theory was someone brought them in from Baril Lake and let them go because they didn't want to clean them years ago. Theres a camp down in Baril Bay with a portage to Baril. That early the fish will probably still be in Reserve Bay, although you might try the sand bars off Hook Island. I like some of my spots down past Birch Narrows as well."
5043282,Steeks7882,2016-08-06 10:12:00,9,I was wondering if anyone had a suggestion on where to stay in Ontario next June for 5-6 days with great walleye fishing. We live in Minneapolis and we are willing to travel from the border to around 3 hours north.I do have my own camper and would need a boat rental. The resort should have bathroom and shower available. I don't mean to be picky but some of the places boat rentals that I have been looking at have not been real nice. I want something stable and comfortable for 2 adults 1 teenager and 2 little ones. At least a 40hp motor.Our Budget is between $1000-1500.00I did already look at Ontario sunset country website.Thanks in advance!

5046594,Steeks7882,2016-08-08 05:09:00,9,Thank you for the reply's so far! I am looking into each one. I guess my requirement for a rental boat would be 40 hp or bigger tiller preferred with a flat floor . And a depth finder would be great. Thanks once again.

5048114,johnboat,2016-08-08 16:30:00,2014,Next June? Better get to booking. I'd be a little concerned about the fishing at a camp with a bunch of openings in June. Don't wait to long.
