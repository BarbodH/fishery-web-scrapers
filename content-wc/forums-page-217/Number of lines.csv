5051801,v-bay gord,2016-08-10 10:20:00,3168,"Nimrod Nimrod, king of Shinar, was, according to the Book of Genesis and Books of Chronicles, the son of Cush, the great-grandson of Noah. The Bible states that he was ""a mighty hunter before the Lord.... began to be mighty in the earth"". Extra-biblical traditions associating him with the Tower of Babel led to his reputation as a king who was rebellious ......and here I just thought the visit was memorable. Little did I know it was spiritual....if somewhat magical. Mighty hunter? Is that why the group wore loin cloths?"
5052233,Nimstug,2016-08-10 15:14:00,2605,Not sure of the zone but the northwest arm of Rainy is one rod per angler. Our first trip there we had a rod lying on the boat deck with just enough line out that the lure was touching the water. The lodge owner mention in passing that might be construed as having an extra line in the water. Just took an extra second to meet the spirit and intent.
5052473,bthomas3333,2016-08-10 17:10:00,465,If that is truly the intent how about this? Create a 3rd license type of catch and release only. Meaning you can't take any fish. Then allow more rods per person...say 2 or 3. I haven't kept a fish in the last 10 years but I am forced to conform to the same rules of someone who can keep 4 walleyes / 4 pike / 25 crappies / 50 perch... Whole thing just doesn't make sense to me. B-
5052505,v-bay gord,2016-08-10 17:32:00,3168,"It doesn't have to make sense to you........it's Ontario, not Wisconsin."
5052993,Lmbkiller,2016-08-10 22:36:00,639,"I don't understand how Ontario mnr has ""sky's falling"" attitude with lines per angler, how many fish for daily/possession limits, yet, in some fisheries zones they acknowledge that smb were illegally introduced to waters yrs ago, but then promote smb by protecting large specimens till July 1. Talk about not making sense....the overwhelming majority of resident and nonresident anglers go to Ontario for the incredible walleye fishing, not smb fishing. Read the fisheries management plan for zone 4. Btw, it's 17yrs old, fisheries can flip in that amount of time, it happened to many lks round these parts in WI. Walleyes galore 15-20yrs ago, now all centrachid based. Mnr knows not what it is creating by protecting smb"
5053017,pjshorthorn,2016-08-10 23:28:00,5654,"When one is on a journey to a place of reverence and majesty, the tribal nimrod code is to respect all animals and fish.....except for the mink. Mink fur is needed to line the loin cloths and has powerful medicinal benefits in order to prevent mosquito and black fly bites on those sensitive areas. PjNimrod"
5054025,johnboat,2016-08-11 09:44:00,2014,"I've seen first hand Ontario's MNR backing the one line rule. 5-6 years ago an officer weaved through a handful of boats and pulled right up to a boat with one guy using two poles. I was close and never noticed the 2nd pole. The guy got the book thrown at him. Ticketed for 2 lines, lifejackets, throwable, whistle..............untill I started slow trolling away. Officer was there quite a while after I moved away.I got the feeling one of the boats called him in."
5059681,Lake Of The Woods,2016-08-15 01:53:00,124,"Ontario Recreational Fishing Regulations 2016Page 8Fisheries Management Zone or Zone – The province is divided into 20 Fisheries Management Zones for which there are general regulations that establish open seasons, limits and size limits (where applicable) for popular fish species (see also Exceptions, page 7).Hook – A hook includes a single-pointed or multiple-pointed hook on a common shaft but does not include a snagger or spring gaff. The number of hooks includes any single-pointed or multiple-pointed hooks that are part of a lure.Hooks and Lines – An angler may use only one line, unless otherwise stated in the regulations. Two lines may be used when angling from a boat in parts of the Great Lakes (see exceptions to the general regulations) and for ice fishing in many areas (see Ice Fishing, page 11). A fishing line must not have more than four hooks attached.Immediate Release of Fish – All fish that are caught unlawfully or are illegal to possess (e.g., during the closed season, of prohibited size, or are in excess of the catch and possession limits) must be immediately released at the place and time of capture. This includes fish that may be injured during catch. This rule does not apply to invasive species like goby which should be destroyed and not released back into any waters (see General Prohibitions).Lead Sinkers and Jigs – It is illegal to use or possess lead fishing sinkers or jigs in Canada’s National Parks and National Wildlife Areas. Further information is available at www.ec.gc.ca/flf-psp/ default.asp?lang=En&n=80A2A&AF-1Live Holding Boxes – If you use a live holding box or impounding device, it must be clearly marked with your name and address and it must be legible without having to lift the box, unless it forms part of or is attached to a boat. Any fish in holding boxes are part of your limit. Always monitor fish in your possession; allowing fish to waste is an offence. Catch and retain possession limits apply to live holding boxes.Livewell – A livewell is a compartment designed to keep fish alive. For a livewell to be used to selectively release Bass, Walleye and Northern Pike, it must be attached to or form part of a boat, hold a total volume of not less than 46 litres (10 gallons) of water, have the capacity for water exchange and be mechanically aerated at all times when live fish are being held in it (see Ontario’s Catch and Retain Rules, page 9). Remember, live fish may not be transported overland without a permit. Livewells should be drained before leaving a waterbody.Muskellunge – For the purposes of this summary, Muskellunge includes Muskellunge and hybrids of Muskellunge and Northern Pike.Open Seasons – Fishing season opening and closing dates vary depending on the species and the area. Dates are inclusive: all dates including the first and last dates stated in the summary are open or closed. It is illegal to attempt to catch fish for which the season is closed, even if you are going to release them. Fish accidentally caught during the closed season must be immediately released back to the water. Unless stated otherwise, species that are not listed (such as sucker and Rock Bass) have a year-round open season.Pacific Salmon - For the purpose of this summary, Pacific Salmon include Chinook Salmon, Coho Salmon and Pink Salmon.Size Limits – All size limits refer to total length which is a measure from the tip of the mouth with the jaws closed to the tip of the tail, with the tail fin lobes compressed to give the maximum possible length. Provincial regulations are established using the metric system.NOTE: If you catch a fish in a restricted size range, you must release it immediately (see Units of Measure).Sunfish – For the purpose of this summary, sunfish includes Pumpkinseed, Bluegill, other species of the genus Lepomis and their hybrids.Units of Measure – There are many units of measure referred to in the summary. Provincial regulations are established using the metric system and converted to imperial measurement units for the convenience of anglers. The following short forms are used:• km = kilometre (or mi. = mile) • m = metre (or ft. = feet) • cm = centimetre (or in. = inches)GENERAL PROHIBITIONS – IT IS ILLEGAL TO:• Transport live fish, other than baitfish, taken from Ontario waters or to transfer or stock any fish into Ontario’s waters without a special licence to transport or stock fish.• Transfer live fish or live spawn from one body of water to another without the authorization of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.• Possess any of the following live invasive species: Rudd, Ruffe, Bighead Carp, Black Carp, Grass Carp, Silver Carp, Round Goby, Tubenose Goby or any member of the snakehead family.• Use live fish other than those listed as baitfish (page 10) for bait.• Fish for or possess any species of Fish listed as Endangered or Threatened under the provincial Endangered Species Act and/or federal Species at Risk Act.• Sell or buy any recreationally-caught fish (including taxidermy mounts), crayfish, leeches, frogs, fish eggs or spawn. Only holders of commercial fishing or commercial bait licences may sell their catch.• Possess a spring gaff, snagger or spear gun within 30 m (98 ft.) of any waters. A spring gaff includes any device which uses a mechanical spring, other than the fishing rod under tension, to set the hook for an angler. No person shall take fish with a gaff, snare, snagger or spear gun. A gaff, other than a spring gaff, may be used to assist in landing fish caught by lawful means.• Catch a fish by impaling or snagging it with a hook through any part of the body other than the mouth – any fish hooked in this way must be released immediately.• Take fish by any means other than angling, spear, bow and arrow, net or bait fish trap.• Possess a spear for the purpose of fishing on or within 30 m (98 ft.) of the edge of any waters except when fishing in accordance with the regulations (see Non-angling Methods, page 11).• Use artificial lights to attract fish except: – to fish for smelt, or to fish for Lake Whitefish or Lake Herringwith a dip net – if the light is part of a lure attached to a line used in angling.• Use dynamite or other explosives to take or destroy fish.• Fish within 25 m (81.8 ft.) of a pound net or fish culture cage.• Fish within 22.9 m (75 ft.) downstream from the lower entrance to any fishway or canal, obstacle, or any device designed to assist fish around an obstacle.• Abandon fish or permit the flesh to spoil, if the fish is suitable for human consumption.I do know that you can use 2 lines in parts of Zone 10 that are on Lake Huron."
5050673,That Minnesota guy,2016-08-09 19:40:00,8293,Minnesota is 1 line per angler in the summer. Is Canada (Ontario) one line per angler also?

5050777,Pooch,2016-08-09 20:09:00,4619,"Ontario is one rod or line per person. Although I've seen some nimrods with multiple lines in the water. Where is a warden when you need one?!!I think there is a limit on hooks (jigs) or lures per line, but not sure how that works.Where's V-Bay? He'll know.Pooch"

5050961,clawman,2016-08-09 21:27:00,2078,I always wonder why there is a limit on the number of rods an angler uses if you are limited to a certain number is fish what does it mater how many rods you use to get there?
5050977,Lmbkiller,2016-08-09 21:37:00,639,"To a large degree, it's a social issue. Has very little to do with an over harvest issue"
5051065,compact,2016-08-09 22:21:00,30,"In Ontario, I thought it was 2 lines/person on the great lakes, and 1 line/person on inland lakes."
5051233,Shellback,2016-08-10 06:00:00,8083,"Yes, that'a zone 20, and it's 2 rods with a couple exceptions. Sections of Bay of Quinte, and the St Lawrence east of Howe and Wolf Islands."
5051401,v-bay gord,2016-08-10 07:23:00,3168,Fisheries are usually managed and modelled with the idea that not every angler will harvest a limit. Increasing every anglers ability to harvest a limit will ultimately result in limits decreasing to preserve the fishery.
