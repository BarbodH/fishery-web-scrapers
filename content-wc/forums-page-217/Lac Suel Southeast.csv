Any advice on depths, structure types appreciated. Hopefully, the fish still gobble jigs/half crawler or leech. Anyone try preserved minnows. Thanks"

Fish were in 18-25 foot on reefs and shorelines 1/4 ounce jig and minnow. Was a good trip for us and it was great fishing with lots of numbers and good size.
