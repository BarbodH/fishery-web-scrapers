LOL Looking at there web site doesn't look like they have much of a docking system for a boat. Going after lake trout and this place seems to have a lot in this area, but hard to find info from those that have fished the lakes We have always gone to small resorts and this seems like a large resort with lots of campers. just looking for other opinions from people that have stayed at this resort."

I have been going up to Browns for over 40 years.White Otter has some very good Walleye fishing, along with great lake trout fishing. The Walleyes in White Otter take a bit of a learning curve to find. They are huge though. The Lake trout fishing is great! Actually fantastic.Clearwater Trout fishing is very good. Hit the lake early or late in the day. If you are coming back from White Otter early, take the time to hit a couple spots jigging (Buzz Bombs). It's nothing to pick up several trout out of the holes in a matter of 15 min's.I love the two lakes!!!Things have changed over 40 years there, but the fishing still remains top notch."

The biggest 27"" walleye. White Otter lake is crystal clear, my memory was you could see down at least 20', the walleyes bite is easier at night. I would bring some planer boards and fish them in White Otter during the day with some Crawler harnesses because of the clarity if I was to ever go back. My buddy caught some really big fish in White Otter but the bite was night time because of the clarity. You have to see the Castle, Jimmy McQuaits if I recall. Good luck."
