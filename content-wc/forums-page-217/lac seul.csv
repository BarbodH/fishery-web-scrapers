5063177,stumcfar,2016-08-16 10:13:00,451,I did get a copy of Yesterday the River. I am in the middle of reading it. Does anyone know or is there a map out there that shows the location of Mackenzie Fur Post that was on the lake? It sound as if there were several buildings and a cemetery etc. Just curious where that might have been located on the lake?
4841698,stumcfar,2016-05-16 09:06:00,451,"I have heard the book ""Yesterday the River"" is a great historical read of the Ear Falls area. I will be up there in 2 weeks. Is there somewhere in Ear Falls that sells this book? I love your Ear Falls area and just wish I could spend a lot more time up there. Thanks!!"

4842018,pjshorthorn,2016-05-16 09:58:00,5654,"Prov, Do you recall the title of the book regarding Sioux Lookout? I would be interested in taking a look at it. Thanks, PjShorthorn."
4842769,prov1800,2016-05-16 14:28:00,5010,Not off hand but ill get it for you.i have read it.lots of interesting stories.
4842977,stumcfar,2016-05-16 15:21:00,451,"This is maybe a dumb question, but anyone know how the name Ear Falls came about?"
4842993,prov1800,2016-05-16 15:22:00,5010,Wife says its called TRACKS BESIDE THE WATER
4843001,prov1800,2016-05-16 15:31:00,5010,I did a googlecsearch (earfalls on name) it will tell you
4843617,walleye/musky,2016-05-16 18:21:00,47,i was always told that the old falls where they built the hydro dam was shaped like a ear and I'm not to sure where to find that book .
4843641,pjshorthorn,2016-05-16 18:25:00,5654,Thank you very much. PjShorthorn.
4843681,walleye/musky,2016-05-16 18:30:00,47,but i agree I was born and raised here 28 years old now and never have a intention of leaving
4834058,Guest,2016-05-13 20:59:00,0,hey I've lived in ear falls for 28 years 'my whole life' and i was scared of lac seul till i was around twenty years old now i love it best walleye fishing anywhere and questions just ask
4834858,bus33,2016-05-14 07:51:00,289,We love it too. We stay just outside of Ear Falls. We talked to a girl at the gas station last year that grew up in Ear Falls and never fished Lac Seul....we were amazed by that. Said she goes to the smaller lakes around there.
4834970,eyedrvm,2016-05-14 08:14:00,48,How low is the water level below normal? Suppose the normal shallow spring spots will still be good just slide out to where there is actually water now?
4835010,zeebee,2016-05-14 08:19:00,1144,If only you knew what she knew.
4836634,ftfarms,2016-05-14 20:57:00,444,Lac suel is a awsome walleye lake for sure but not the best. Lake Erie and lake st Joseph are better.
4837562,Guest,2016-05-15 08:01:00,0,water level is low like always in spring time all the normal spring spots are still easy to get too i was out on the lake yesterday
4838410,zeebee,2016-05-15 11:01:00,1144,"Yup yup...your dads bigger than my dad. Thing is my dads a much nicer guy. So it is with Lac Suel, its just a much nicer place to be than Lake Erie."
4838538,prov1800,2016-05-15 11:46:00,5010,There's always something better some other place.but lac seul and a few other great lakes being within 10-40 min of my house they'll have to do.
4839850,eyedrvm,2016-05-15 18:33:00,48,Ok. Thanks for the update. So This is normal water level for may 15th?
4839946,walleye/musky,2016-05-15 19:03:00,47,yes the boat launch is 5 minutes from my house so it will do
