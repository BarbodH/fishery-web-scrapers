I've used them on the great Lakes with huge success and would like to try them on my next Canada trip. Planning on going to lake kipawa next summer and I read a lot about walleyes being deep. This seems like a great way to get down to them and hold am accurate depth. Any thoughts? If you do pull divers, what lures do you pull with them? We use spoons on Lake erie, but I know you can drag other things too. Seems like you could also pick up some deep Lakers as well. Sent from my SCH-I545 using Tapatalk"

I had a 4"" wire then a treble running frozen smelt connected to it. I was working between 40 - 60 feet for Lake trout. It was effective on Lake Trout and surprisingly we were hitting Northerns at that depth the first week of June. We also ran cowbells for Lakers and Splake with them. Used the rubber snub with 20# Fluoro off of it, was back about 5' from Dipsy. A couple of years ago, I lost a firetiger Dipsy, I believe a northern may have hit it, it was down about 50' in 100' of water, so I now run a wire leader that I connect the Dipsy too. Here is a Splake off a Dipsy this year my buddy caught."

5053945,1K1MOA,2016-08-11 09:25:00,90,"RE: your question about walleye on spoons behind Dipsy - I ran a small willow spoon on one with a 6' fluoro leader and minnow at about 40' because I thought we were marking walleye, caught 6....whitefish, not walleye. The whitefish tasted awesome!! I have yet to get a walleye off a dispy despite many hours with things they would eat."

5060001,Habitual Eyer,2016-08-15 06:25:00,144,"I fish NW Ontario for walleyes half the summer...Erie the other. Use dipseys a lot when Erie bite starts to migrate over to Pennsylvania line come late summer. Have tried to use much of my open water trolling gear in Canada (boards/cranks/dipseys/etc). With little luck. Just don't have or see the suspended fish out in open water like the Great Lakes. Almost all Jig/Minnow structure fishing when in Shield Country for us. I could see some contour trolling with cranks off riggers (or bouncers), but I don't know if I would even want to pull up walleyes from the type of depths that a dipsey would assist in. We did have a fair amount of luck a couple weeks ago using dipseys/spoons in the deep waters targeting Lake Trout. Caught a couple in the 30-35"" range. Beautiful fish and was a nice change of pace after spending the week jigging for walleyes. My advice would be to leave the trolling gear at home and focus on jigs, bouncers, spinners, etc. We have 100 fish days jigging up groups of fish after locating them with good electronics. Surprising how much fun even a 16"" walleye can be when pulling straight up from 16-28 feet. It is a very welcome change after watching rods all day while open water trolling on Erie."
