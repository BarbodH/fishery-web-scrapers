Coming from south ontario we are lucky and have many rescources for good quality perch. I agree with one of the responses above about how good perch eating is and if i ever have a choice its at the top of my list. BUT, what we dont have anymore from abt Cochrane down is reliable, catch your limit evryday walleye fishing...hence, we take 1wk every yr to go into these amazing lakes and spend some good $ to do so. With tht said, walleye and pike and pike to us are the reason for these trips and worth spending the $. Any perch we catch tht fall in the jumbo range are a true bonus on the days we eat fish. I could never plan any trip to any lake and have any decision be based on perch fishing. Just my 2cents."
5054113,rzep,2016-08-11 10:13:00,1196,"From what I recall about perch biology and growth, most large/jumbo perch fisheries co-exists with other predatory fish around, such as pike and walleye. If there is no predators around, the lake becomes overrun with small size perch. I guess the amount of food at some point decreases while the perch overpopulate the lake and their size stunts. Once the fish become stunted, there is no genes in the pool to bring the large perch back... outside of the re-population. So yes, I always plan to take a break and throw spinners for pike etc.. and much of the time with great success."

5054785,johnboat,2016-08-11 16:48:00,2014,"It does not come into play for my destination. I go to far north for the Perch to be a factor. I think the growing season just isn't long enough for them to get to jumbo size. But I could be wrong. But if the Walleye fishing was equal on 2 lakes I was deciding on and the Perch fishing was outstanding on one, then yes it would be a factor. But I would not sacrifice the Walleye fishing for perch. Tasty little buggers that for sure!"
5048658,Joek3,2016-08-08 20:26:00,244,Does the quality of perch fishing have an impact on your destination decision? Does anyone ignore the perch knowing you could easily obtain your limit?
5048802,forgop,2016-08-08 22:29:00,880,"I would love a fly-in that had a great perch population. You can take enough fish for a nice fish fry when you get home and it's quite yummy. In 4 trips, there's been exactly 2 caught on 4 different lakes and none of them advertise perch. Sent from my SM-G935V using Tapatalk"
5048825,adempsey2.0,2016-08-08 23:02:00,612,"I'd say it would definitely help sway me. Having a midday fishing option is always important, whether it's Pike, Lake Trout, Smallmouth Bass or Perch. Of course, most lakes will have Pike and Walleye, so Perch would be a nice bonus indeed. Nothing like a nice perch fry as well!"
5049089,packpro,2016-08-09 06:56:00,695,"Our resort offers walleye, pike, smallmouth, lake trout, musky and perch. With a group of 8-12 everyone is happy. We start keeping the perch that we catch with the walleye for the first few days. It turns into a nice little batch of fish. We never have trouble catching our walleye possession limit in the first hour each day. So, with a very short move from a walleye spot we are into the perch. Break out the 1/16th-1/8th oz jigs and the smaller minnows. Usually we can catch 30-40 (per boat) in half a day. Add that to the earlier catches and each guy takes 25-35 perch home. That little fish fry upon return makes it easy to get away again next year. If the perch fishing immediately shuts down, there is a bully in the hole. A guy in our group caught a 37"" pike just outside the perch spot on 1/8th oz pinky jig on light line no leader. 24 minute fight, lots of long runs, quite entertaining for those of us watching. At our camp the perch are easy to find. Find the weeds, find the perch. Perch inside of the weed line, walleye and pike outside the weed line. We do not put them in individual bags. 5 or 6 per bag. We have been stopped twice by MNR. It was easy to see we were well under the limit. We leave the required patch of skin on and make sure they flat in the bag. Both time the CO told us, ""Were not worried about perch"". That's no guarantee, but no issues either time"

We have spent 1-2 part days chasing them, and only 1 time did I come home with a limit of nice 10-12"" perch. Wife was happy as that is her (and mine) favorite fish."
5049129,Bill Krejca,2016-08-09 07:15:00,6107,"It doesn't hurt to check for worms in the flesh, before stockpiling a mess; some lakes seem to be more susceptible than others, deeper caught seem sometimes to have less than the shallow fish. Bill"
5050305,Obabikon,2016-08-09 17:45:00,2370,"Lake of the Woods perch fishing is better now than anytime I can ever remember. Something has changed in the lake, and the ""jumbo"" perch are showing up very regularly. As a kid, that was not the case. It really helps us to stay legal. We can send a group home with their full limits of walleye, simply by eating a few perch or crappie during their stay. Its a great eating fish."
5050385,DaBirdman,2016-08-09 18:19:00,164,Great eating fish. Pretty looking fish. But I'd much rather get them ice fishing. Open water I'm focused on the larger fish.
5051569,steve.a,2016-08-10 08:12:00,274,Is the LOTW perch limit still 15? It used to be 50. Big change
5051673,rzep,2016-08-10 09:05:00,1196,"I love to eat perch more than walleye. For me perch is #1 fresh water fish to eat. If you have warm-free, 10 inch + perch ... I am there ..."
