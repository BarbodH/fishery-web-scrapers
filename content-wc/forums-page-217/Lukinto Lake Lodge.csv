5059065,Fishoil,2016-08-14 15:04:00,1277,I used to go there yearly but haven't been back since 1997. It was well ran back then and the cabins were very good. The lakes had some great fishing in them also. I've heard only good about the place since then and would like to get back there again one of these years. Sorry I can't give you more recent information but I will be watching this thread with an eye towards a return trip soon.
