I've traditionally gone to closer destinations, but wanted to try something nicer and would accommodate a small group. We arrived early the day before we flew out, attempting to stop in Dryden for lunch but the power was out everywhere, so we ventured on to Sioux Outlook. to find out the same result. Power was restored around 7pm, so most of the town had already closed up for being able to grab something to eat. We found a food truck and thank goodness the grocery store opened briefly so we could gather our last foods to pick up like milk, eggs, and other last minute options. Ryan from Slate Falls Outposts stopped in to introduce himself and we discussed the camp and plans for our trip out the next day. We stayed at his bunkhouse, which I would highly recommend over any other motel in town. Ryan came in with us that morning and took us to a few spots on Maskara and helped mark another lesser known hump. He also carried over motor and gas to a boat on a portage we took to another lake. That was the toughest portage I've taken and he carried it without a problem. He also came back and helped clean fish before being picked back up in the afternoon. Camp was very nice and better outfitted than any other cabin I've been to. Some camps provide cheap kitchen supplies, but this was a cut above. There were 2 bedrooms with 3 beds with 2 more beds and a couch in the main living area. The cabin also had a full bathroom with a toilet. The mattresses were quite comfortable for a camp and Ryan went on to say that they're getting replaced. I've slept on far worse mattresses at nice hotels and here they are replacing perfectly good mattresses, so that's the level of detail they take in making their camps a cut above the rest. I brought a higher end seat as most boats have cheap seats and hurt my back after awhile. I bought a bench seat bracket to arrive and find out their boats at Maskara didn't have a bench seat and were a post mount and wouldn't work. We weren't able to get the bolts off another seat, so Ryan took the seat back with him and the brought the seat back 2 days later so I could use it for the rest of the trip. I won't upload pictures because we've all seen a ton of pictures of walleye, but I will say I had my best fishing experience in Canada yet. I would have done much better had I spent more time jigging the marked spots on Maskara, but my daughter is a bit ""busy"" and she was kept more entertained keeping the boat moving/trolling that anchoring and jigging. Anyway, here is a tour of the camp and will give you a good idea of what you'll experience should you choose to go to Maskare or any of their camps. I'm already looking to find possibilities for a return trip next year. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA5t3KpL4JUhttp://slatefallsoutposts.com/"

5030457,maddogg,2016-07-31 10:26:00,178,Glad you enjoyed your trip. We fished Mascara quite a few times. The cabin looks a lot nicer than the first time I went there but that was the first year Verne owned Slate Falls. We had many good times there.
5030489,forgop,2016-07-31 10:50:00,880,Yes-it is quite a nice cabin. I don't think many people could come away from any of his camps and say they were roughing it by any means. Sent from my SM-G935V using Tapatalk
5032201,maddogg,2016-08-01 10:50:00,178,The first couple of years it were an adventure on Mascara and Snellgrove then the new cabins started being built. Now it's like going to the Hilton.We do have more fun in the old cabins though. Mascara cabin in 1986.http://i.imgur.com/GDn6PTD.jpg?1
5033457,forgop,2016-08-01 20:49:00,880,Nice picture. Did they tear down and build new in the same place or build on a new site entirely? Sent from my SM-G935V using Tapatalk
5034457,maddogg,2016-08-02 09:56:00,178,I think this was an old trappers cabin. I think they built on the same site it had a sandy shoreline.
