5030777,Bigsauger,2016-07-31 15:33:00,12,"Thought I would reach out to the WC community to get some advice on what they would consider to be the best family lake for a trip in late July / early Aug next summer. I'm looking for easy fishing and numbers, not necessarily size as I want to keep my wife and kids (9 and 10) entertained and get them hooked on Canada! Also looking for a nice camp, preferably with some kids activity options, swimming, etc. We just got back from their first trip to Canada with a week on Cedar Lake and unfortunately I have to say was very disappointed. I'm blaming it on a bad week as many others in camp said it was the poorest fishing they had experienced in many years of fishing cedar. We loved our resort, cabin, etc. but definitely needed a little more fishing action throughout the week. Thanks for your thoughts and ideas."
5031977,martinbns,2016-08-01 09:01:00,1520,"Canada is a pretty big place, so not sure where you were thinking of going but we just came back from Five Lakes Lodge on Gull Rock Lake near Red Lake, Ontario. The Lodge has 9 cabins, very well maintained, the couple who own the lodge have two kids probably something like 9&6, they have a trampoline about 25' off the end of the dock in a very sheltered bay. There were two families with kids while we were there and they both looked like they were having a blast. Fishing is pretty easy, lots of reefs with piles of fish to catch. Ian will help out if you aren't getting active bites, he helped us. IF the weather goes bad they have a nice common cabin with TV and a card table. We found it reasonably priced.http://www.fivelakeslodge.com/"
5032105,BornToFish,2016-08-01 10:01:00,1224,"The previous post mentioned something important. Canada is big country with lots of lakes. There is something there for most everyone. You mentioned something important in the original post. That is, you might want to consider an ""action"" lake with multi-species of fish. I would not recommend for you to take your family to a trout lake or an exclusively walleye lake. These types of waters demand extreme attention by an angler. I've taken my nephew to Canada a few times. I found that his attention span was fairly short. He needed action to keep interested. By this I mean he needed to be moving about in the boat and casting, rather than vertical jigging the side of a rock hump. Thus, I encourage you to seek out multi-species lakes as something is almost always biting at any given time. Going in mid July to mid August is good in terms of stable (family-friendly) weather and weed development. You can usually find perch in developed weeds, which can lead to some rod bending. It's also worth mentioning that most, but not all, fishing lodges in NW Ontario are family friendly. Keep this in mind! Cedar Lake is a great fishery. I am somewhat familiar with it as I have fished quite a bit on Perrault Lake. It might be that you just happened to have a poor week because of the weather. Anglers often encounter better fishing if they stick with a good lake. They learn the lake better each year and refine their equipment and angling techniques. I encourage you to not hop onto different lakes each year in search of the magical fishery, as anglers doing this typically stay stuck on the first step of their journey. Good fishing and tight lines!! Make some great memories together....."
5032473,Duflebag,2016-08-01 13:05:00,218,"BigSauger,I would highly recommend Stanley's West Arm Resort on Eagle Lake. I have known the owners for over 25 years. The resort was owned by Marv Wisniewski for years and has been run by his son Rob and Rob's wife Chantel for quite a while now.Stanley's is one of the only family resorts that I know. There are a lot of things to do for the whole family. I have recommended Stanely's to many friends that wanted to bring their family up to Canada and not have the rest of the family not happy because you are in a strictly fishing camp. I am not related in any way to Stanley's other than being friends with the family for going on 30 years now. I go to another camp for my fishing trips but I recommend Stanley's for anyone looking for a family oriented family resort. I hope your family has the trip of a lifetime."
5032721,Jesse-WI,2016-08-01 16:00:00,534,Curious to know if you used a guide at any time during the stay?
5033377,eyemike,2016-08-01 20:20:00,233,"I have also stayed at Stanley's Resort. Big fully equipped boats; they also have a very nice pontoon. Definitely a family orientated resort. Beautiful cabins. Owners do a top notch job of giving you the trip of a lifetime. They also have as part of their service, free portages to easy access small lakes. Great fun for the kids! We did not have a guide while we stayed there and I sure wished we had! They have several very good guides on hand and Eagle Lake is a big body of water. It took me 2 days to figure out a pattern for walleye. A guide would have showed me Eagle Lake's patterns right away! You are very close to Vermilion Bay and a short drive to Dryden. I highly recommend Stanley's"
5035289,Bigsauger,2016-08-02 19:38:00,12,"Thanks for the advice everyone. Eagle lake has always been on my list and I will look into Stanley's as it sounds like a great resort. Jesse - We didn't use a guide and in hindsight I wish would have. I had heard that Cedar Lake was relatively easy to fish so I assumed my experience of 40+ trips to Canada over the years would suffice (rarely with a guide). Between hearing the fishing was ""slow"" from everyone at camp along with others on the lake we just assumed it was the pattern and not necessarily us. Next time (whether it's Eagle or another lake) we will definitely hire a guide the first day or two to get us on the fish quickly."
5058770,farmnfish,2016-08-14 11:41:00,130,"I just returned from a family fishing trip that went fantastic. I think mostly because we did not focus to greatly on fishing. We let the kids determine the pace, fished early mornings and late evenings when the fish would be biting, went to a nice provincial park beach in the afternoons, played with the lodges kayaks, and even (all the fisherman say ECK togather) pulled the kids on a tube. Collected rocks and pine cones and played uno in the evenings. Everyone caught plenty of fish, but I think we would have a great time even if we hadn't. I've been on trips were you had to really work to find the fish, and get all focused on fishing constantly trying to find them. That's not much fun for a kid."
