5061161,bwelch,2016-08-15 13:57:00,1,"My Group and I are heading to the Gouin for our annual seven day trip at the end of this week. Normally we go in June, any reports on water height, weather, ect..?"
5061209,Hookhunter135,2016-08-15 14:32:00,129,Just got back from Gouin stayed around Plamondon Bay. Our walleye bite there was very slow. There were 4 of us and we caught 60 the whole week. Water levels remain high. We caught fish equally in all depths but could never quite get them consistently. Jigging was tough due to windy conditions. Pike bite was steady collecting 160 throughout the week. Average size was between 18 to 25 inches. Largest were 33.5 and 45 inch fish. Surprisingly to me the 45 inch fish was caught mid morning in 3 feet of water. Overall it was a good trip. It's a beautiful area. I am new to walleye and pike fishing so take my report for what it is. Water temps were warm and fish seemed sluggish.
5062657,Freytown,2016-08-16 06:42:00,770,"Glad to hear you had a good time. A 45"" NPike is a real trophy. Did you take a pic of that fish? FT"
5063001,Hookhunter135,2016-08-16 08:56:00,129,Yes I will try to attach a picture. I'm 35 and it was my first father son trip with my dad. He got it on the last day last hour of the trip. I was fortunate enough to be in the boat with him and land this trophy. It was the biggest fish he has ever caught.
5063697,Freytown,2016-08-16 14:25:00,770,Thxs for sharing the pic.......your dad will never forget that one.
5001217,Hookhunter135,2016-07-19 09:07:00,129,Looks like a great trip. I leave in 2 weeks for Plamondon on the Gouin. How are the water levels at this point. This will be my first trip up.
5003313,tweedrules,2016-07-20 04:12:00,107,This is the highest we have ever seen. It's a real double edge sword. You don't have to worry about hitting any rocks but some of our favorite weed beds disappeared. Have a great trip you will love it.
5003441,walleye22,2016-07-20 05:20:00,59,what camp did you stay at? looks like a great trip. thanks for sharing.
5004177,Guest,2016-07-20 09:48:00,0,"The water is very high but the risk of hitting rocks never goes away. The hazzard just shifts to rocks that were previously visible but are now inches under the surface looking to collect paint from your prop. The fish bite has been very good this year on the Gouin, you should have no problem catching fish around Plamondon."
5004185,Andre (wallyandre),2016-07-20 09:50:00,2274,X2! What you can do is to use the Navionics APP and play with the water level adjustment. The Gouin is very well chart it's in HD and with Sonarchart level detail.
5004369,Hookhunter135,2016-07-20 11:28:00,129,I just downloaded the navionics chart.......very helpful. This will give me a good idea of where to start
5006361,Kartman35,2016-07-20 21:55:00,245,"I once hit my lower unit in what was supposed to be 17 FOW. Was at Mistassini not Gouin, just keep in mind it's not perfect and use caution when not in deep water."
5015473,Esoxfeign1313,2016-07-24 05:54:00,79,"My trip is in mid-September with Air Tamarac. They are the only outfitter I've ever used (granted this will only be my 2nd fly-in trip), but they run a smooth operation and they seem like really nice people. The cabins, etc. are in excellent shape. The fishing was good (caught my first 20# pike!), and it's really affordable. I'll get to one of those fancy lodges in the NWT, etc. eventually, but for now, the Gouin via AT fits the bill perfectly."
5015649,octanehi5,2016-07-24 07:05:00,1104,The Gouin still has a higher than normal water level this yr. Depth finder is always a must have on a fly in trip
5015665,Hookhunter135,2016-07-24 07:15:00,129,A depth finder was one of the first things I checked off my list. I'm hoping with the use of it and a map that it will help me get a good game plan together rather than just floundering around.
4890513,tweedrules,2016-06-01 18:10:00,107,I would love to hear about your Gouin Trips when you return? We are headed out to Lac du Male (Air Mt Laurier) for our 5th year 6/30. Can't wait. Post your highlights here if you guys and girls don't mind. Water level Jig colors hi jinx? Thanks Have a great trip everyone.
4899457,East coast,2016-06-04 16:43:00,32,"Hey Tweedrules; We returned from the Gouin after a week of fishing. We arrived May 26th and departed June 2nd. Ice was still flowing out of the St-Mauricie river on our drive in. Water was almost at its highest level, very similar to 2013. We target mainly Pike and did well with hundreds in the boat and the highlights were two 40""s, two 41""s and one 43"". Also easily met our walleye quota to come home with and a few midnight fish frys to boot. Both species were on the spawn with some being off the spawn dependant if you were in the south or north of the reservoir. The water was warming fast though with shallow bays reaching low 60s while the main lakes were at a cool 42. Good luck on your trip, wish I was returning in a couple weeks, but I will have to satisfy with the 365 day countdown."
4900817,Kartman35,2016-06-05 08:17:00,245,"I have never seen the water level this high. The fishing was tougher than usual this time of year but was getting better and better every day. Still no trouble to get a limit, but not nearly as many released as usual. Many were complaining that in ten years they have never seen the fishing this tough. I was not at an outfitter but camping in the north eastern corner Verreau bay. There's a steep sand boat ramp and having the heaviest boat I saw there (19 foot Princecraft Hudson), my pathfinder was not able to pull the boat out. It took my pathfinder, and a super helpful neighbour with a 2500 Silverado and a length of chain to get me out. Usually there's more room to get a running start but the water level made it really tough. Merci Pierre for pulling me and my boat out yesterday morning. Don't know what I'd have done without him. If I go back there I think I'm gonna have to install a winch first. (Unless I know Pierre will be there). As far as jig head colors go, It wasn't making much difference for me...I went through a box of multi colored jig heads each one different and results never seemed any different. An outfitter I stayed at last year swears the best way is just a #4 octopus hook with a split shot 18"" up and a leech or crawler fished liked vertical jig."
4900889,Freytown,2016-06-05 08:25:00,770,"Thank you guys for the updates, I will be making my way north soon. The weather forecasts seem cool and rainy for a while. I'd like to see a bit more warmer temps...but it is what it is."
4901417,tweedrules,2016-06-05 12:31:00,107,Thanks guys for the reports. Can't wait a month!!!!!! Glad you had good trips.
4910025,octanehi5,2016-06-08 06:38:00,1104,"Fishing right after a late ice out has always been slow,Very cold temps this week with lows in the 30's and highs in the 40's, Walleyes just coming off of the spawn, Fishing will improve every week Shallow bays will be your best bet the deep water is very cold at this time"
4935377,Freytown,2016-06-18 05:41:00,770,"Just returned from the Gouin. Fishing was very good. Hundreds of walleye and two 40"" plus pike. My first two days were brutal with temps in high 20's and a north wind that had 3-4 ft white caps all day long. Snow flakes and sleet mixed in to remind you that you're in the north country. PS: most eyes were caught in 20-22 fow, not many were shallow this trip....very unusually (water was cold). Despite the cold start, fishing was above average for the week. FT"
4974953,tweedrules,2016-07-08 11:22:00,107,"The trip was amazing. Caught our limit early in the week and had to throw MANY big eyes back. Pike was not as big though. Biggest one caught was 35''. Our group gets in the 40's from time to time. Rained every day which was good for fishing but bad for the comfort factor. The water level is the highest I have ever seen. Walleye's were caught in 8-25 feet of water so it was hard to figure. We caught them on all sorts of colors. Yellow, green, blue, florsent. We used no plastic just a jig and a worm except these new keitech jigs. They worked great. Try them they were awesome. White worked the best. It's called the crazy flapper 2.8. http://www.keitechusa.com/keitech-so...apper-2.8.html. All pike were caught on lucky strike half waves, live forage spoons and red and white daredevils. Hot n tots worked best for trolling. Would love to hear about your trip as well. 364 days until next year. On a side note the Quebec ministry of fishing (not sure if I have the name correct) actually docked at our camp to check licenses and amount of fish stored in the fridge. Never experienced that before."
