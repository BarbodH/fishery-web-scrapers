Ice covering 1/3 or 1/2 of the lake makes for 3 weeks of excellent fishing during the time of change. Eat on the move instead of having shore lunches. Pike show up in shallow water about 11:00 a.m. and move out when they feel like it. Spawned out pike are stressed and need to be handled carefully. Catch your dinner walleyes on the way back to camp."

Is it when there is absolutely no ice on a lake?...most ice is gone?...mostly open water...? How much and to what affect does the ice melt differently depending on the depth of the lake? I am from the desert so I have not seen with my own eyes a lake in the spring that is in the process of melting etc. I have been told besides temperature that wind plays a big factor in how fast the ice goes/melts."
6737067,N_of_Quibell,2023-05-05 12:54:00,151,"Good question! I copied the following from the Minnesota DNR's website of iceout data:The definition of lake ice out can vary from lake to lake. For the citizen observers reporting data, ice out occurs when the lake is completely free of ice. Or, it may be when it is possible to navigate from point A to point B. Ice out may also be when a lake is 90 percent free of ice. Observers use consistent criteria from year to year when reporting lake ice out dates. So the answer appears to be ""it depends"". As you say, I have also heard that wind is a very important factor. Air temperature no doubt plays some role, but solar insolation and rain can also be major factors. All of these together make it difficult to predict."
6737069,prov1800,2023-05-05 13:07:00,5010,"I would think total ice out would be when you can get in a boat and go from one end to the other.Some lakes that are smaller can be possible to do rather than some big lakes.There is a small lake out today which allows a flu out service to land there planes on the water today.This lake historically goes out and then roughly a week later Eagle Lake usually goes out.It happens in stages.Narrows open, bays open and so on.Awesome time of the year when you live in a area with 4 seasons.Spring being tops."

6737075,N_of_Quibell,2023-05-05 13:18:00,151,Yep! Looking good. A few more days. Truck's already half loaded....
6737079,stjoeguy,2023-05-05 13:50:00,979,"I use the ""absolutely no ice"" definition when reporting the ice-out date for our lake. May 1 this year. To follow the ice-out progress in Sioux Lookout I visit this guy's website:http://www.dickshideaway.com/"
6737081,proguidedream,2023-05-05 14:01:00,345,"if you want a good reference on ice out , and how it changes day by day. check out this linkhttps://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov...T18%3A56%3A31Z the easiest thing to do is zoom into lake of the woods , and click back day by day and you can see how much more ice was there the previous day. you can also back years, and change months and do it forwards and see how the ice is formed."

6737177,prov1800,2023-05-06 08:47:00,5010,That was last year on April 26 th when I got my boat in but only had a mile and a half of open water but that's all I needed to get some trout and 2 dumb muskies that didn't know the season was closed.
