6735431,WalleyeTherapy,2023-04-28 11:21:00,49,Thank you for alerting everyone. I usually stay at Best Western Dryden for Ghost River trip. Decided to try Sioux Lookout Inn this year for a short drive on check-in day. FYI to anyone else that has a booking @ Sioux Lookout Inn: Best to call Dryden hotels to book. For our date (August 4-5) there was no availability online at Holiday Inn Express or Best Western. Called both and they both had availability for King and 2 Queen rooms.

We are staying there Friday June 2nd and thankfully they will be open. We have stayed there every year, minus COVID lockdown, for 15 years."

Those anglers that have reservations there should make arrangements NOW to re book at other hotels ! Just found out today when canceling one of the rooms I had booked. I think a lot of folks will wind up without a place to stay, or have to stay in Dryden unless you take action quickly. My PSA for you all. Best Regards, TVTYD"
6734763,elway12,2023-04-25 10:31:00,335,Thank you for this. I had heard rumors that it was closing.
6734781,Lovetofish,2023-04-25 13:04:00,458,Is that place the old Best Western?
6734791,stumcfar,2023-04-25 13:36:00,451,What are some decent options to stay one night in Sioux Lookout?
6734807,Eckohlt,2023-04-25 15:07:00,3685,Lamplighter motel.
6734847,RichA$1970,2023-04-25 20:12:00,1159,"Pack a pillow, pull off at a safe spot, recline the seats and crash is what we do."
6734857,pjshorthorn,2023-04-26 02:03:00,5654,The Lamplighter Inn or the Forest Inn I believe is another option. PjShorthorn
6734869,jimirjr,2023-04-26 05:18:00,1149,"Stayed at the ""old"" Lamplighter last Sept.. My suggestion is to avoid at all costs.. The place has turned into a pig sty... Just a horrible experience to say the least !!"
6734917,Eckohlt,2023-04-26 10:27:00,3685,"It was many years ago I stayed there,thanks for warning others!"
6734925,pjshorthorn,2023-04-26 10:40:00,5654,I'm surprised to hear that. It has been a while since my last visit so it is very possible that ownership has changed. Good to know. PjShorthorn
