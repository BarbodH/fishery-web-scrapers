6734501,RichA$1970,2023-04-24 11:10:00,1159,Probably not going to happen but this is the same government that shut down 2 fishing seasons that crippled not just the bait shops but the entire tourism industry so I wouldn’t put it past them.
6734515,walleyecheek,2023-04-24 11:54:00,2231,Actually I've heard of guys using garlic salt for freezing Minnie's or shiners.

6734391,Eckohlt,2023-04-24 06:43:00,3685,"Ain't gonna happen in nwo,to many people make a living off of live bait."
6734401,walleyecheek,2023-04-24 07:03:00,2231,Ok then let the Carp thrive and the Crawlers crawl !!!
6734417,Franco,2023-04-24 07:28:00,107,It’s already happening…(see pic)
6734431,wmd,2023-04-24 08:02:00,388,All that says is you cannot transport live baitfish and leeches from one zone to another. It does not ban the use of live bait. wmd
6734433,Franco,2023-04-24 08:07:00,107,Quality of the pic is low but there is a full ban on live baitfish in the northwest corner of the province. I’ve blown up this pic for a better view.
6734447,Eckohlt,2023-04-24 08:34:00,3685,Crawlers??
6734451,Franco,2023-04-24 08:43:00,107,"I’m guessing it only applies to minnows, but honestly I’m not sure."
6734455,Eckohlt,2023-04-24 09:01:00,3685,"So if know live minnows,I would think bait shops are going to get into salting minnows big time!"
6734467,walleyecheek,2023-04-24 09:33:00,2231,"I highly doubt it ! They wont be able to possess live minnows to turn them into salted minnows, besides that you have to have Pepper also !!!!"
6734487,Eckohlt,2023-04-24 10:25:00,3685,Probably just go with lemon pepper Minnie's.
6730329,tv4fish,2023-04-07 07:07:00,2694,THAT has been so comical for many years - I have bought crawlers at Fleet Farm for many years and it says right on the package that they are from Canada...........
6730331,walleyecheek,2023-04-07 07:13:00,2231,Kind of makes a fella go Hmmmmmmmmm !.......LOL.
6730333,Laketripper,2023-04-07 07:15:00,103,It seems Mother Nature has no respect for the border policies put in place by the Government of Canada to protect it's environment and agriculture. She just dumped a bunch of brown snow in NWO brought up with the recent Colorado low.
6730339,prov1800,2023-04-07 07:28:00,5010,Got the Colorado low for last few days.Beautifull white snow.Hooefully the last kick.Outlook looks awesome now.Just want to say we appreciate you guys spending all your money up here.Id say it's worth every penny.I see lots of guys here always have a smile on there face so must be something good going on.Dont fret about the bait and the food.Just enjoy the trip.dont worry about the little things.
6730357,lollyjoe,2023-04-07 08:18:00,64,"A number of years ago my son and I organized a canoe trip into Quetico through an outfitter in Ely, MN. We stayed overnight with the outfitter and noticed he had tanks of leeches so we asked him about taking some with us. He told us he could not sell them to us to take into Canada. We had to buy them from Zupp's Fishing Camp on the Canadian side of Lac La Croix. As we were leaving he handed us a parcel and asked us to take it with us to Zupp's. In the parcel were our leeches which he sold to Zupp's who in would sell them to us. Disclaimer: I have dual Canadian/US citizenship and have lived in both countries for many years so this is not bashing either country is is about the stupidity of the bureaucrats."
6730363,stumcfar,2023-04-07 09:17:00,451,"I believe this has now changed, but maybe a decade ago, we were going ice fishing on Buffalo Bay which is the Manitoba portion of LOW. THey always questioned us at the border if we had any live minnows, which we never did as we knew we couldn't bring them up there. I chuckled and asked the border agent if the truck next to us was getting asked the same question. It was the guy from Minnesota who sells minnows and he was heading up to where we were going fishing with a tank full of minnows to sell to the bait shop! The agent told me they could be brought in commercially but not by individuals??? What????"
6730371,Golden Eagle,2023-04-07 09:45:00,2642,Bang on advice. I'm have the power to make every NW Ontario fishing trip a good one and I use that power every time.
6730769,wienerman,2023-04-09 07:23:00,4,"Nice to know Stumcfar. Last year we did the free Canadian weekend out of Warroad. I did check aroung the regulations, and aslong as we come by water and don't touch land, we were good to go and not have to call customs. I did find out we could bring bait( crawlers in bedding only) and we just pinched down our barbs. BUT I did forget to take off my other hooks. Thanks for the info."
6734357,Franco,2023-04-23 20:46:00,107,"Ironically, crawlers are invasive to all of North America. They’re native to Europe and Asia. But since they’re all over both Canada and the US, not sure why it matters anymore."
6734359,Franco,2023-04-23 20:51:00,107,"There’s already no live bait allowed in certain Ontario Provincial Parks (eg Algonquin). Given the carp threat, I don’t think it will be long before all live bait is banned in Ontario. Though it doesn’t make much sense to lump leeches and crawlers in with minnows, a complete ban on all live bait would be the easiest to enforce…and government always likes “easy to enforce”, even if it doesn’t make much sense."
6730225,eyecatcher1,2023-04-06 15:48:00,323,I saw an article recently that said Minnesota is talking about banning livescope.
6730233,Net_Man,2023-04-06 16:28:00,580,Minnesota Livescope - I had only seen this as a April fools joke
6730235,eyecatcher1,2023-04-06 16:30:00,323,I saw the article about a month ago. Not sure how they'd pull it off since people have thousands invested already.
6730253,RichA$1970,2023-04-06 18:40:00,1159,Based on the risk of invasive species I have no problem if they do away with live bait. Lampreys and Asian carp have no good uses unless they are dead.
6730263,prov1800,2023-04-06 19:19:00,5010,Definitely should ban them from fishing tournaments.
6730267,prov1800,2023-04-06 19:35:00,5010,Up here now in Canada with only bait from here is no problem never was.So the no bringing bait in from states was the way to go.
6730283,RichA$1970,2023-04-06 21:24:00,1159,I’m fine if the MNR feels domestic bait is ok as it’s a pain to haul bait and I enjoy taking a quick break to hit a local bait shop.
6730313,walleyecheek,2023-04-07 05:25:00,2231,It just seems kind of ODD that for years and years and years and years crawlers were welome to cross into Canada ! And then Covid hit and now all of a sudden they are Contaminated and invasive species ! And they wont let them cross anymore. I wonder how many get across anyway ?
6730323,Riding high,2023-04-07 06:46:00,69,It's kinda of strange that all the worms we bought in Northern Minnesota and took across for all these year where from Canada. We just bought them and brought them back home.
6730327,walleyecheek,2023-04-07 06:59:00,2231,They'll come a day when a person or persons can't bring any groceries across ! MONEY GRAB !!!
6729855,stumcfar,2023-04-05 12:42:00,451,"I hear Manitoba is considering a no live bait law in the future. Is Ontario looking at anything like this? I go to Canada to catch fish and laws such as these would have an effect on people heading north I would think. I know you can catch fish on plastics etc. but not like live bait. Is there anything scientific behind these proposals or just knee jerk? I am not trying to start a fight, just curious what is going on?"
6729877,Eckohlt,2023-04-05 14:05:00,3685,"Another late April fools joke,don't fall for it stumcfar!"
6729883,Old Timer,2023-04-05 14:10:00,255,"I read an announcement from the Ministry about the same thing. They are looking to institute the new regs in 2025 or 2026, as I recall. Not April Fools."
6729885,Old Timer,2023-04-05 14:11:00,255,"For Manitoba, not Ontario."
6729887,Old Timer,2023-04-05 14:12:00,255,Manitoba.
6729929,walleyecheek,2023-04-05 16:12:00,2231,Before long it will be All of Canada and also Livescope will be banned !
6729941,prov1800,2023-04-05 16:25:00,5010,Havnt heard anything about Ontario.Just tighter restrictions to avoid getting invasive species here.Thats a good call.Bait industry big here so something goes on we will here about.Manitoba has always had areas with no live bait since I was a kid when I lived there.the Provincial parks are like that today still.
6730073,Bill Krejca,2023-04-06 08:00:00,6107,"My last Manitoba fishing was for some years in the earlier 2000's. At the time, as I remember, no live minnows were allowed, and hooks had to be barbless/barb bent down. Bill"
6730197,stumcfar,2023-04-06 13:57:00,451,"Yes, Manitoba is barbless when it comes to hooks. Because I fish both sides of LOW, MN and Manitoba, I have to be really careful not to have a rod in the boat with a barbed hook, in Manitoba, as that is considered a violation even if it isn't in use."
6730199,prov1800,2023-04-06 13:59:00,5010,Just squeeze the barb down with plyers
