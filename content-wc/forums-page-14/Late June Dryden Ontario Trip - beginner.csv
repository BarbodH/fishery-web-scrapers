6734745,Mojo-NC,2023-04-25 09:13:00,1929,"I wondered if anyone would mention the Ned-rigs - good suggestion. We love 'em. As others recommended, 1/4 and 3/8 ounce jigs. I would also recommend bringing a few spinner rigs with size 3 Indiana and Colorado blades, or 3.5 willow blades. You can tip them with minnows, leeches, crawlers, or plastic paddle tail minnows. They are awesome walleye finders. I would pick up a couple of Rapala Shad Rap Deep Runners with at least one being in the fire tiger color pattern. Also bring a few Storm Hot 'N Tots with a couple in the black/gold color pattern. Finally, a few spoons such as the red/white Dardevle or orange/gold Doctor, and a yellow/red 5 of diamonds color pattern in either style spoon. If you brought just those few baits I guarantee you would catch a bunch of fish of all species that are present in the waters you fish."
6734749,Ldubs_12,2023-04-25 09:33:00,12,I'll do that. I'm sure he already knows the hot spots so I'll follow his lead.
6734751,Ldubs_12,2023-04-25 09:36:00,12,"Great advice, I'll do as much for him as I can!"
6734767,jaleonard,2023-04-25 11:07:00,29,"Savor every moment of time with him. I have been seven times. The first in 1997 with my 19-year-old son. I have done two trips solo. The camp operator let me do this because I was a repeat customer. These are float planes out of Red Lake, so it was true wilderness. I even did portages solo - four lakes over from the cabin. Absolute serenity as I was the only one - there is only one boat at each portage. I wish I could have done more trips with my son but normal life interfered. He passed this past July at 44 years old. What I wouldn't give to have another trip with him. I hope you have an amazing trip and catch all the love you can."

6734999,emma17,2023-04-26 15:26:00,436,"We love this lake- plan to be there end of May this year. If you're not aware, the camp practices strong conservation methods. Barbless hooks and no-lead jig heads. No Walleye over 18 to be kept."
6735387,MrSimon,2023-04-28 08:50:00,922,Man I envy you! I remember the excitement and anticipation before my grandpa took me to Canada for the first time. Don't overthink it though. Take a tackle box of the stuff mentioned in this thread for sure .... but make sure to take a camera! You're gonna carry these memories with you for the rest of your life. Enjoy the car ride. Take time to talk with the weird and interesting people you meet. Take pictures of the dumpy little gas stations and restaurants you stop at. Have fun and let us know how it goes!!
6734343,Ldubs_12,2023-04-23 18:29:00,12,"Im sure gramps has several hundred spoon in his tackle box and wouldn't mind loaning me one haha. I just purchased one husky jerk and will see what happens! From what my grandpa has told me, it doesn't sound like there are many people on basket. Are there any topographical maps that you know of for fishing the lake to find these various reefs? Like I said, his sonar is one that came with the boat and feels like it's just a continuous loop showing fish that aren't actually there and doesn't show any of the structure or topography."
6734345,Eckohlt,2023-04-23 18:56:00,3685,"Tell gramps to upgrade that sonar,or maybe he doesn't know how to works his??"
6734349,Ldubs_12,2023-04-23 19:18:00,12,Would love to get one but you hit nail on the head. Technology is not his forte.
6734355,prov1800,2023-04-23 20:34:00,5010,That old school tackle is still pretty solid stuff to use
6734361,Baseline,2023-04-23 21:13:00,3207,There are maps for Basket. Contact Vern's Bait Shop in Ignace and find out what he has.

I think this year I will start saving the Bucktails from hunting season and not tossing them in the dead pit and see what I can come up with. Last Sept I had a day they were slamming hair jigs"
6734415,Bill Krejca,2023-04-24 07:24:00,6107,"Let Gramps fish the way with which he is comfortable. It is maybe easier for him to just hang on to a rod while trolling than trying to cast continually all day long. As folks continue ""to mature"", it generally becomes more difficult to cast. Speaking from experience with my father, I got him a trigger activated unslung reel, my thinking was it would be easier to cast with, but he just couldn't get the hang of it, I ended up casting for him, and let him reel it in, he never liked to troll. That with which we are familiar is easier to use, particularly as we age. Help him into/out of the boat and while on the dock. Have fun, the things you will learn will amaze you, and the memories made will last forever!!!! Bill"
6734473,Mike from Boyd,2023-04-24 09:58:00,2,I'm close to your grandpa's age and also enjoy trolling for walleye in Canada. Two years ago I took my grandson with me to Canada and he didn't like to just sit there and troll even though we were catching lots of fish. He would cast off to the sides as I trolled. We both caught fish but I have to admit he caught more than I did. It doesn't make any difference how you fish as long as you enjoy it. My advice for walleye in June would be a jig and minnow or leeches. Leeches are tougher and last longer but sometimes they just want minnows. Good luck and have fun.
6734505,UpNorthGuy,2023-04-24 11:23:00,53,"Can't go wrong with some spinners, Little Joe or similar. Water will most likely be dark in that area (not always, but most lakes are). So I always go with shinny or bright colors. Enjoy your time with your grandpa, once he's gone you can't get that time back. I fished with my grandfather and father in the Ear Falls area for the past 30 years. They are both gone now, and I'd give anything for one more trip with them... Paul"
6734551,10point,2023-04-24 13:18:00,102,"Look into ned rigs. Someone gave me that tip before I made my first trip up that way last year. I caught walleye, northern, smallmouth, and a large musky on them but used them mainly for walleye."

6734115,Da' Walleye Assassun,2023-04-22 11:50:00,358,Don't forget to bring along a couple dozen 6 inch wire leaders. You don't want those pike biting through your mono or flourocarbon line.
6734125,RichA$1970,2023-04-22 12:45:00,1159,"Sounds like a great time to be with your grandpa. If I had a chance to go with my Great Uncle who passed many years ago but took me to Canada as a 6 y/o, I’d just ask what tackle I should bring. I think it would be fun just taking spoons, bucktails & jigs for an old school trip. Seems to work for him & I bet he’d appreciate you following his lead. Enjoy the trip."
6734131,Walleye2242,2023-04-22 13:54:00,263,Sent you a DM.

6734141,Baseline,2023-04-22 15:00:00,3207,Basket is down toward Ignace and part of the Basket River. I haven't been to Basket in a long time as we generally go to some lakes located downstream. Basket is the classic walleye lake with lots of structure leading to deep water. There are mid-lake reefs which are great spots to slowly jig minnows for walleyes especially during the summer months. Basket also has some huge shallow grassy bays which harbor lots of pike. You say your grandpa likes to troll spoons. It is likely he trolls down the main channel shorelines along the transition depths from shallow to 20 foot depths. He may also know where the reefs are located and they are good spots for larger pike. I think Basket also holds some lake trout. For roll just about any 4 to 5 inch brightly colored or flashy spoon that wobbles or inline baits that spin. In the shallow bays either toll or cast Bomber Long A's in bright flashy colors or any similar crank bait.
6734269,Ldubs_12,2023-04-23 10:05:00,12,I have been looking into some heavier fluorocarbon leader to hopefully prevent pike from taking my lures. Hopefully this will work
6734273,That Minnesota guy,2023-04-23 10:21:00,8293,You can try Floro leaders if you like. Metal strand leaders have been working for decades.
6734335,Da' Walleye Assassun,2023-04-23 17:53:00,358,TMG is correct. With a wire leader you have a swivel to tie on. You have a snap for changing lures quickly. Tying flourocarbon to monofilament is tricky.
6734341,Ldubs_12,2023-04-23 18:25:00,12,"Quote: Originally Posted by Da' Walleye AssassunTMG is correct. With a wire leader you have a swivel to tie on. You have a snap for changing lures quickly. Tying flourocarbon to monofilament is tricky.That makes sense, I was looking into a couple of videos teaching the knot from fluorocarbon to thread and it seemed like it could take a while. For me it would make sense for a faster change between lures for the wire. Thanks"
6734083,Ldubs_12,2023-04-22 10:16:00,12,"My grandpa recently invited me with him to Canada near the end of June. He has been going to a small camp up near Dryden Ontario for 30 plus years and has always had great luck fishing. It sounds like they generally catch both pike and walleye. Although I have been fishing several times here in Southern Minnesota, the fishing is completely different with shallow lakes that turn green for half of the summer. I was looking to get input from anybody on the types of lures you have the best luck with near Dryden the end of June. My grandpa is very old fashioned when it comes to fishing and just tends to troll, tell stories, and pull spoons. He does not have any of the fancy fish finding equipment or sonars. I have been reading up on a lot of different sites that indicate husky jerk, xrap, wally diver etc are quite popular. I do enjoy casting and am a more ""active"" fisher than my gramps who let's his rod do the work haha. Any ideas for sizes/colors or setups are greatly appreciated! Thank you for your input and help. I'm looking forward to this trip!"
6734089,That Minnesota guy,2023-04-22 10:32:00,8293,"I'm guessing you will want to cast more than Gramps will. Spinnerbaits will work. Mepps is always a good idea. Bring some Twister Tails (White) and jig heads. A Blue & Chrome Rattle Trap will work also. Remember, for you the trip is about catching fish. For Gramps the trip is about time with you and introducing you to something he has loved for 30 years. Don't waste this time of trolling and letting Gramps tell you stories. In 20 years you will look back on this as the greatest fishing trip you ever took."
6734091,stjoeguy,2023-04-22 10:32:00,979,"I'm sure your grandpa will put you on fish trolling with spoons, rapalas etc. I, also, prefer a more active type of fishing, however. My favorite technique is pitching jigs (1/4 or 3/8 oz) with a twister tail, paddle tail or some type of plastic attached. Fish should still be fairly shallow at the end of June. If you can convince grandpa to give it a shot, try any any windswept shoreline or point. Enjoy your trip!"
6734093,Ldubs_12,2023-04-22 10:47:00,12,Thank you for the advise and I'll never forget it I'm sure. He is upwards of 80 and his mobility is not what it used to be. You just never know when it will be their last trip to Canada.
6734095,Ldubs_12,2023-04-22 10:52:00,12,"Thanks a lot for your advice. I'll have to look up some videos of ""pitching jigs"" as many of the articles I have read indicate you can never go wrong with jigs and one of the best ways to catch Walleye!"
6734097,That Minnesota guy,2023-04-22 10:54:00,8293,Another thing I will add. Gramps probably won't be fishing hard anymore. He will like time on shore and maybe even a mid day nap. When Gramps is in the boat fish the way he wants to. Because of balance issues he likely won't want to stand and cast. You can grab the boat and go casting when he is having his break. While I'm nowhere near 80 my last Canadian trip I told the other guys to grab my boat and go. I wanted to stay back relax and read a book. Canada is different things to different people.
6734099,Franco,2023-04-22 10:56:00,107,"Mepps #3’s and 1/4 oz jigheads with white twister tails. That’s all you need. But if you want to have some fun, pulling spoons will basically guarantee you pike. Jigging raps give your arm a good work out and tend to produce walleye and pike. Wacky rigs will get you some SMB but depends on the lake."
6734103,Ldubs_12,2023-04-22 11:18:00,12,"From the fish I have caught, Pike are by far the most fun to catch as they put up a **** of a fight. My biggest pike I have caught in Minnesota is 33 in. My grandpa indicates he has caught some 40 plus inch Northern up in Canada so that would be awesome!"
6734105,Ldubs_12,2023-04-22 11:22:00,12,"Well if that's all I need to catch fish, I have plenty of jigs with white twister tails already! I will look into the mepps #3s. Maybe I'm just overthinking things haha. If I can catch fish in southern Minnesota, they should jump onto my line in Canada."
6734107,Limeyangler,2023-04-22 11:36:00,563,Which lake you on?
