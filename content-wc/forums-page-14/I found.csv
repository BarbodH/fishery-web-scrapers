6733603,Eckohlt,2023-04-20 14:29:00,3685,Border agent might think diffrently!
6733649,kettyspanky,2023-04-20 16:37:00,271,"So we can bring nightcrawlers as long as they are in bedding? That would be nice but, we have been getting at the general store right down the road from our resort. If we can bring them, we probably will."
6734059,[email protected],2023-04-22 08:59:00,6,Wonder if that is the same for Manitoba??
6732289,Eckohlt,2023-04-16 12:21:00,3685,"The five man electrical band song,signs signs everywhere a sign can't do that can't do this,they nailed the lyrics with that song,wonder if there from Canada?"
6732299,Skywagon,2023-04-16 13:06:00,1106,"You realize how this Canada exchange things works, 18 Canadian nightcrawlers=12 US."
6732309,walleyecheek,2023-04-16 13:33:00,2231,"Thats because it Takes 18 Canadian crawlers to make 12 U.S. crawlers ! (Size wise). I actually have a hard time believing that the crawlers we get down here (U.S.) Are Canadian crawlers, because I've bought crawlers in Ontario and they were pretty skinny !"
6732315,Yellowfin123,2023-04-16 13:41:00,2182,"you would think it would be the other way around, we wouldn't want canadian soil coming south infecting our golden farm ground, they should want our dirt, heck you could drop a nuke above lac suel and its not gonna hurt anything"
6732317,Eckohlt,2023-04-16 13:49:00,3685,No nukes allowed to cross the border!!cant bring'em in.
6732327,walleyecheek,2023-04-16 14:15:00,2231,I've heard that there going to Contaminate the soil with Nuclear Waste somewhere up there ! Don't send us any of them crawlers near that site !
6732333,Eckohlt,2023-04-16 14:22:00,3685,"No wonder I’m always short on crawlers out of a flat up there,I forgot about the crawler exchange rate,,,thanks for the heads up sky!"
6732483,Bakefish,2023-04-17 07:38:00,1077,"Nightcrawlers are invasive to North America, both Canada and the US."
6733167,JHuheey,2023-04-19 08:45:00,70,"""Progressive"" government at it's best - constantly creating new issues to regulate, manage, and try to control for everyone's wellbeing. Exact opposite of the old adage ""KISS"" - keep it simple stupid!"
6733539,JDsdogs,2023-04-20 11:34:00,165,"But we are doing our darnedest to irradiate them, one crawler, per hook at a time."
6732229,walleyecheek,2023-04-16 09:38:00,2231,"This lid on the River bank this morning !........ ""what the He||"" ! (And i wasn't in Canada).....LOL."
6732231,Yellowfin123,2023-04-16 09:54:00,2182,"nothing new, even clear down in missouri when reach in the cooler for worms, the carton says ""canadian night crawlers"" but probably came from somebody's back yard 10 miles away"
6732237,Eckohlt,2023-04-16 10:13:00,3685,"I put it there,I was hoping you found it!!,so no more mystery where it came from."
6732249,walleyecheek,2023-04-16 10:39:00,2231,How do you explain this one !
6732255,Eckohlt,2023-04-16 10:49:00,3685,"Well a 18ct of crawlers in Ont will last about 1/2 hour,so my explanation for that one would be discontinue that one,it probably got into the states by the us border agents crawler sniffing dog must of had the day off that day."
6732263,walleyecheek,2023-04-16 11:24:00,2231,"You see where I'm going with this ? You see we've been able to take U.S. Crawlers and Frozen Salted Minnows to Canada for Decades and Decades, and now all of a sudden they are contaminating their Lakes and soil ! I would say that their lakes and soil is most likely already Contaminated from all those years of us bringing Contaminated crawlers and frozen minnows !.........LOL."
6732265,Eckohlt,2023-04-16 11:41:00,3685,I thought they don't want crawlers n salted minnows brought into Canada cause it was hard on the border agents to ask about bait!!
6732271,walleyecheek,2023-04-16 11:52:00,2231,"Yeah we wouldn't want to ""0ver work"" the Border Agents !"
6732275,Eckohlt,2023-04-16 11:57:00,3685,"I kinda doudt worm bedding or salt from the minnows are going to contaminate the soil!I think whoever is making up those laws better come to the Mayo Clinic for a CT scan of the brain,think they have worms in there head chewing away!"
6732285,walleyecheek,2023-04-16 12:09:00,2231,Whatta make of this ?
