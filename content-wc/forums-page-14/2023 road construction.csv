6736599,Mondo,2023-05-02 19:53:00,61,"I guess we can be thankful to have this problem. A couple of years ago, none of us could even cross the border into Canada.So in retrospect, I'm happy to deal with the road construction. Just a perspective to smile along the way as you're traveling back into God's country.Mondo"
6736657,nitroman,2023-05-03 07:22:00,368,it's all about the lens you see the world thru! Amen brother!
6736705,N_of_Quibell,2023-05-03 09:52:00,151,"Great attitude! 53 is a much better road than it used to be. Goggle Maps shows the Blatnik (53) bridge as closed. I'm going up in about a week, and plan to take 2/35-2/2/13 to 53 around Duluth - it worked fine last spring and fall."
6736761,Walleye2242,2023-05-03 13:57:00,263,Yep...even through Duluth...i do it with a smile on my face as I know I will be on the 2 lane road soon past virginia heading to orr then I falls. Not a care in the world.
6735605,kettyspanky,2023-04-29 07:33:00,271,It's a good time of year to look at minnesota road construction. Some on hwy 53 and on hwy 61. The pigeon river bridge at the border is getting redecked. Looks like a backup at the border this summer. Just throwing this out there. I like to be prepared. I just googled minnesota road construction 2023.
6735649,RichA$1970,2023-04-29 09:18:00,1159,I typically cross Pigeon River around 2:30am and pull over and snooze til 5:30am and then on my way so very little traffic at those times.
6735689,kettyspanky,2023-04-29 12:26:00,271,We usually get there about 11 or noon. Very busy then. I may leave a bit earlier to avoid the jam up.
6735691,Walleye2242,2023-04-29 12:35:00,263,I assume the duluth area with be a mystery as always. i dont know how they drive in the winter.
6735799,7 Mag,2023-04-29 19:07:00,1887,"The I-35/53 interchange work won't be finished until 11/24, it was definitely challenging last year especially pulling a boat!"
6735813,Lmbkiller,2023-04-29 23:34:00,639,Duluth road work won't be finished ever ..fixed it for u
6735895,Walleye2242,2023-04-30 08:32:00,263,100% truth! been getting fixed for as long as i can remember.
6736101,nitroman,2023-05-01 06:32:00,368,Never had a trip in 22 years that didn't encounter some construction somewhere along the way. Most of the time it's multiple places of one lane only through Cloquet. I check the MNDOT site periodically through the spring to see what we are up against.
6736259,JAY221,2023-05-01 15:05:00,877,"And have never seen a good way around it! Later, Jay"
6736265,Golden Eagle,2023-05-01 15:09:00,2642,Whatever comes will be an improvement over last May's experience.
