I thought the authors' observation that landing time was negatively related to mortality was counter-intuitive; I've always had the impression playing fish too long was a bad idea. It wasn't until the very last sentence where they related rapid landing to increase ""barotrauma"". Wish they could elaborate in this, as I always feel a little guilty about playing a fish too long. Maybe the next study - 55 walleyes is actually a rather small sample size for such a study, and limits the richness of conclusions that can be drawn."
6733503,JHuheey,2023-04-20 09:50:00,70,There ya go! But ya probably had to work a little harder trolling or casting instead of jigging
6733507,Eckohlt,2023-04-20 10:20:00,3685,"Both jigging n trolling crawlers by the cabbage,find weeds you got fish."
6733509,prov1800,2023-04-20 10:24:00,5010,I don't troll but do flip out a jig.Once in a while I will throw crank bait.Was on a moose hunt up on Clarks Grace Lake mid Sept.And caught a bunch of walleyes up there in 6-8 ft.with very little problems.1/8oz and minnow.toss it away from boat a bit and crawled it back to the boat.Wife and I would catch one every time.there will still be fish on structure deep in the fall.At one point in time around 50 f they will go shallow thinking they should spawn.Also if you fish here in NWO and have experienced a lake turn over that's also a great time to get them shallow.But weather can be ugly as this usually happens in November.
6735379,MrSimon,2023-04-28 08:38:00,922,Funny. But true and on point. Jigging up a ton of walleye in relatively shallow water on a healthy remote lake will have a very low mortality rate and no impact on the fishery. A bunch of guys dredging up deep walleye all summer long on a highly accessible lake (like Mille Lacs) is gonna be a problem. There is a BIG difference between the two. It's important to not put those two types of anglers in the same category.
6733247,MrSimon,2023-04-19 10:36:00,922,"I highly doubt hooking mortality is having even a remote impact on the vast majority of Ontario lakes. Sure, maybe a few of the popular and accessible lakes might be impacted, but on those lakes over-harvest is a billion times more impactful than hooking mortality."
6733329,prov1800,2023-04-19 14:55:00,5010,I'll agree with the live bait.It will definitely out catch artificial baits anytime.

The question rather than ""how many do you need to catch"" should really be ""how many do you need to kill?"""

6733355,prov1800,2023-04-19 16:19:00,5010,Interesting read BUT way to long so I gave up about 1/4 way through.Personally I don't need all those statistics to tell me what fishing deep does.Lot of fisherman also know it as well.Problem is some fisherman want to catch fish and don't really give a sh*t if they kill a few hundred fish in a week.This goes on on from mid July till fall.I see guys pounding the same spots week after week.Many many spots all over the lakes.Iam sure some of them know what there doing some maybe don't.To me it's a shame what there doing.
6733377,Old Timer,2023-04-19 17:19:00,255,"Mille Lacs Lake in Minnesota is one of the most intensively studied walleye lakes in the nation. Hooking mortality is key component factored into the yearly regulations for that lake. It's a much bigger deal that many fishermen realize. Research has shown that big fish are seriously stressed when caught and especially so when hoisted from deep water. Yes, they swim away, but many don't survive. Smaller fish fare better, but they too are adversely affected. That's not a guess it's a fact."

I just love setting the hook, watching the rod bend, feeling that shake, landing it, and doing it again. Over and over. It's like a drug and it never gets old. Sure, after catching 50 walleye or pike in a morning I might relax for a few hours that afternoon and enjoy the solitude and the scenery. But that wares off pretty quick and I guarantee you by the next morning I want 50 more. I'm picky though. I want tons of fish, but they can't be dinks either. That's why I do fly-ins to northern Ontario. I get it all. Numbers, size, solitude, scenery, adventure, relaxation. I've been fishing for 40 years and its the only thing/place I've found that provides fishing perfection."

Some days we wake up and decided to target Pike with a fly rod, and that is more about trying to find a big one and laughing at one another for setting the hook too early when using deerhair frogs. Other days we wake up, and decided to try and put 100 fish up each. I think that is the appeal of the trip. Each day is different. Some days we are goofing off, watching eagles, and floating around with feet up, others we are actively in the hunt. As a kid, I spent hundreds of hours walking along the bank of Lake Norfork AR throwing crickets at panfish. I love to catch fish no matter the size. Sometimes I target big fish, but for the most part I would rather stay busy catching rather than only catch one or two big ones a day. I don't pay close attention to PB fish. No matter what drives us.... What a great life this is to live."

Nobody says you can't enjoy the scenery and solitude while still catching 150 fish per boat. This will offend some people, but yes we use clickers! We have friendly contests each day on which boat can catch the most, we have an award for the biggest walleye each trip. We used to have a special pair of boxer shorts that the guy with the big fish has to wear each day, on the outside of his pants, until someone gets a bigger one. It is kind of like the colored jersey on the Tour de France. I truly don't get sick of catching fish and after our trip is over, I think that I have had enough fishing for awhile, until the next day and then I wish I was back. We take just enough to eat each day and we may bring a few home for the wives at the end of the trip. This year is a consumption only lake so nothing will be brought home."

6733225,Old Timer,2023-04-19 10:10:00,255,"As my moniker suggests, I've been fishing Canada for many years. In the 50's the equipment was simple and the fish count was unimportant. We'd catch some fish, have a shore lunch, catch a few more and head back to the cabin. It's different today and for many it's competitive combat fishing with the clicker. Sure, most are being released, but the hooking mortality may be more than the fishery can afford. Big fish are especially vulnerable. Down the road I see Ontario going to artificial lures and barbless hooks. This wont be due to invasive species, but rather to reduce the daily catch and hooking mortality. I know some posters think they can catch more fish on plastic than on bait. But on balance, far more fish are caught on meat than artificial. Knowledgeable fishermen like Prov1800 know this."

Nets are always in the way and hooks get stuck in them. Fish get tore up in them. If I were starving for fish and was down to my last hook then maybe I could justify a net. To each their own I guess!

They invited me to have an even number for boat purposes - nice. My goal was a trophy northern pike - 40+. Note that all arrangements were handled by the control freak of the group. A few days before leaving I called the lodge to inquire about landing nets. The owner said that every boat has a landing net, if requested when going out, and if there are enough. He said bring a good net if I am serious. So I took my large net that I have used for Great Lakes salmon. The handle slides thru the flat hoop so easy to transport. The control freak told me to leave the net at home. I said it goes with me. He asked why, and I told him because I intend to land a 40+ pike. He said there are good nets and he has a mounted 31 pike which I would not beat. I took the net and put it in the boat assigned to me. The owner said it was great to see me serious because I brought the net we discussed. Control freak was furious that I had communicated directly. I studied the lake and fished hard. On the third day I caught a beautiful fat 43 pike and after an epic battle neatly landed it in the big net. I kept the fish for a skin mount. (It is beautiful!) Control freak went out of his mind. I never told him that the next day I caught one just a little larger which was safely released in healthy condition because of the big net. How many fish to catch? The control freak kept statistics for and about everyone. When he asked me to keep track and tell him for morning, afternoon, and evening - both number and size, I thought he was joking. He was dead serious. He explained that when back home he prepares a spreadsheet to analyze and share with the guys. I said sure and gave him intentionally incorrect info every day. So did one of the other guys. He was an absolute jerk in camp in the evenings. That was my first and last trip with that group. The other guys went along with his directives."

No need to even take it to a lake, just use it in the driveway. At a local lake, many big pontoon boat parties never leave the dock. I knew a couple guys who actually quit fishing because it interfered with their drinking. I have found life to be plenty challenging when sober. A couple drinks now and then are fine, but not if it interferes with activities or is unsafe for anyone. Because of a health condition and medication, booze is prohibited for me. Sure, I occasionally miss rum & cider in the fall, strawberry daiquiris in the summer, hard cider with a good ribeye, and rum and lemonade, German white wine, and other pleasant drinks. I read that Eric Clapton has always been a serious fisherman. Fishing gave him solace from his demanding career and the rock & roll lifestyle. One of the reasons he stopped the booze and drugs was because he went fishing and realized that he was too drunk to fish. In that state he realized that he had hit bottom as a fisherman."

6730533,SweetD,2023-04-07 21:35:00,243,My goal is to 3 to 1 my boat partner!!!! It’s generally easy pickings although on a tough day I might slip to 2.8 to 1.
6730541,dschiebel,2023-04-08 00:35:00,85,Just 1 A 30 pound walleye
6730589,Moosebunk,2023-04-08 07:15:00,211,"Been fortunate over the years to live and visit a number of remote communities, lakes and rivers in Ontario, other provinces and across the high Arctic. Walleye, pike, trout, arctic char, whatever... it's good fun catching numbers of fish but nowadays I'd often rather fish for that one fish, the big one or the most vibrant, etc. Would trade days of 100, 200, 500 walleye for just the lunker in the lake. Fishing in a barrel is fun but finding and catching that Hope Diamond is often funner! lol Crappies are an exception. Gimme as many for the table as possible."
6730603,Huntindave,2023-04-08 07:46:00,2194,"Good to know,,,,,,,,, I don't like being crowded after I've already launched. Get off my lawn,, and,, my river."
6730605,prov1800,2023-04-08 07:54:00,5010,"Lol.Crappie wise I just bring home what I need.Basically wife and I don't care about numbers and rather fish a lake that is hard to catch walleye but our chances of of 25"" and better always happens.I bring a few guests there and they are the kind of fisherman that know what to expect from this lake."
6730657,Thunder man,2023-04-08 12:12:00,27,what about plastic???No confidence huh?I’m the same
6730909,Pink Unicorn,2023-04-09 21:14:00,83,"This is a great question... if I'm guiding someone new, 15 fish an hour is a good minimum. If I'm with a good fishing buddy, 2 for dinner is just fine. As I once wrote in a poem to my sister ""fish are the goal but not the reward""."
6730913,prov1800,2023-04-09 21:46:00,5010,"I use artificial if I have to.one flyout oitfitter here does not allow live bait..pike,muskie,bass,trout,crappies.artificial works great.Walleye yes you can catch them and I do.But when I have guests they prefer the 100 a day or ten dozen minnows gone.Not going to do that with artificial."
6730953,last chance,2023-04-10 06:27:00,3262,I fish Erie's central basin and just want to get our limit of good solid keepers with some small fish while getting our limit. once we get our limit we are usually done for the day. I don't believe in fun fishing the deep water we fish because of the mortality rate on walleye taken from depths of over 30'. but to each their own.
6730437,7 Mag,2023-04-07 13:53:00,1887,"So the thread live bait vs plastics got me thinking; what do you consider to be an acceptable number of fish caught in a day, we're talking walleye's?"
6730447,stumcfar,2023-04-07 14:00:00,451,"2 people in a boat, 50 -150 a day. I go to Canada to catch fish and enjoy the solitude and that is what we have come to expect. Is that the wrong answer?"
6730449,walleyecheek,2023-04-07 14:01:00,2231,kinda like fishing in a bathtub isn't it !
6730459,Eckohlt,2023-04-07 14:17:00,3685,"There been times when there weren't many fish in the bathtub,they went to bed dirty!"
6730465,That Minnesota guy,2023-04-07 14:49:00,8293,Is there a correct answer?
6730481,prov1800,2023-04-07 16:00:00,5010,So for myself and my wife first priority is get 4 walleye first thing in the morning then go muskie fishing.If iam guiding I have to see what kind of guys or woman I have and get the low down on what there looking for.But normally they want walleye all day long so that's what we do.Of course depending on the bite so good day should be up around 100 fish I guess sometimes less sometimes more.I always load up with 10 Doz minnows.Most days we run out.Thats about how I keep track of things.Sometimes lose a minnow and sometimes catch 2-3 or more on one minnow.Anyways when bait gone you have had a great day.i personally don't fish all day I just let guests pound away.
6730503,pan-man,2023-04-07 18:44:00,299,"For me, my goal is 100 walleye over 12""'s with 25 over 20""'s and 5 over 24""'s. Does this happen often? Maybe a 1/3 of time as weather is my biggest deterrent. I go for solitude and the catching is a bonus. I also try to avoid seeing more than 5 boats a day and will never fish in the same area as someone else. if someone else is in the boat, than the goal is 150 fish/day for the boat."
6730505,Eckohlt,2023-04-07 18:51:00,3685,"I try n go for Double what pan-man says,but cut the boats in half from what he's seeing."
6730513,RichA$1970,2023-04-07 19:29:00,1159,"I’ll take quality >18” than quantity anytime. Usually fishing for pike and will get my 4 walleyes for the frying pan inadvertently. When I want to take a break and chill I’ll start jigging for walleyes. Like others have said, avoiding bumper boats with peace & solitude is what I enjoy vs catching 50 runts."
6730517,7 Mag,2023-04-07 19:37:00,1887,"No wrong answer, i like to catch 50-100 as well."
