6733467,Hillbiehle,2023-04-20 07:22:00,66,"As stated, it depends on the lake for whatever reason and the presentation. When vertical jigging on an outpost we frequent, I was using crawlers since we had them and felt the need to use them. My wife was fishing simple plastic. She was catching 3 to my 1 as she didn’t need to rebait. By the time I caught one, took it off and re-bait, she was already reeling up her next one and so on. We usually fish barbless, and usually avoid a net with a simple release boat-side with some pliers etc…. Much quicker when the bite is on fire"
6733655,gordy28,2023-04-20 16:47:00,437,"For me I like both. My typical jig is about as heavy as I can get away w, 3 or 4 inch plastic w a small piece of worm. I couldn’t say I catch any more or less than just plastic guys or minnows but it gives me confidence. Most trips I have always defaulted to trolling or drifting w worm harnesses as it’s what I grew up fishing but based on many peoples input I have slowly been working to love the jig &#x1f600;. Chatting w our outfitter a few years ago he mentioned that he never uses live bait but recommends it for people who are not experienced with the jig as he felt the fish would old on a little longer helping you set the hook and get a feelHe was also the one who recommended I not worry about using micro weight jigs. More important to make sure you maintained bottom contact as “northern Ontario fish were dumb”Cheers. Great thread Andrew"

Gulp among others works well, 2"", 3"" and 4"" in shad pattern is my favorite. vary your presentations-there's more to it than just the traditional vertical jigging we all do. Rip it, pitch and slow retrieve, even letting it sit on the bottom and slowly bring it up. They will let you know what they like. typically when they hit these they SMASH it. I also try to make the hook the least visible as possible when rigging these up on your jig."
6730189,skap,2023-04-06 13:10:00,58,"So I have started to use plastics a little more over the last year or two and had some pretty good results overall. To be honest, I was pretty reluctant at first but has been pleasantly surprised. I have fished the Ontario side of Lake of the Woods a few times in both open water and ice. Since October of 2020 you are no longer allowed to bring any live or dead bait across the border. Used to be able to bring crawlers or dead / salted minnow but no longer. I fished with a friend last September up there and we did really well just using Gulp and other similar types of artificial. I also fished ice up there a couple weeks ago and did well on 2-3"" gulp minnows. Now to be fair its hard to compare between this and live bait, but overall it has been a good experience. I will say you can get a lot of fish out of one piece of plastic. You can can also get a hit on a plastic and leave the line in the water without worrying about if you lost your minnow or not. That said, I do believe you need to fish it a little different and add a little more action to that lure than you are maybe your used to with live bait. It does seem a little more reactionary and the fish to seem to strike it harder than if using a minnow. At least to me it seems like this is the case. Side note, I have a number of friends that fish Lac Seul in summer and they all fish plastics exclusively. Never use any live bait. Good luck everyone"

6730381,Old Timer,2023-04-07 10:26:00,255,"Ontario's Sustainable Bait Policy prohibits minnows and leeches (dead or otherwise), but is silent on night crawlers. I may have posted this on another thread, but two weeks ago a friend was ice fishing with a Canadian border agent. The agent said the no bait of any kind rule was instituted by the border patrol to limit the interaction between agent and traveler during Covid. This is because the agent might have to check between allowable and unallowable bait. So the patrol said no bait and travelers would be asked specifically about any bait in their vehicles. Now the Covid entry requirements have been relaxed, but the no bait rule still will be strictly enforced."

6728469,kona77,2023-04-01 07:52:00,236,"We have found there are certain days that live bait really does out fish plastics by a larger margin. However when the fish are really on, it is a no-brainer for us to switch to plastics. You can catch 12-15 fish on the same gulf/berkeley minnow/paddle tail type bait and just saves a lot of time. Have a brother who just will not use live bait and takes pride in trying to get fish to hit plastics. Have to admit that he always holds his own in the boat but there are exceptions. Agree with the comment about fishing below falls/fast water. Those fish are typically in a trigger/reaction type mode and they tend to hit plastics just as well as live bait. When searching for fish our ""go-to"" method is a crawler and bottom bouncer (or lindy type rig). If the fish are really aggressive and hitting both hooks then we know we can start to jig and throw plastics. Regardless of bait, nothing beats that ""tap-tap"" of a walleye on a jig bite !!!"

6728267,turkeyriver,2023-03-31 12:06:00,80,our trips are July and August. We used to take a lot of crawlers. I was taught that a half a crawler on the jig was better than twister tails. Then somebody left some frozen minnows in the freezer and we tried them. What we've discovered is that you don't need more than a small piece of crawler or minnow with a twister tail to greatly improve your catch rate. We've cut down on how much bait we need that way. White twisters seem to be the best. We're always in stained water. This has worked too many times to be just a situational thing.
6728277,Bill Krejca,2023-03-31 13:00:00,6107,"Sharing opinions based upon experience/observations make readings so interesting. Here's mine- Novice folks logically should lean toward live bait, or dead, if not live available, just increases their odds. If I were a guide, I'd make sure the clients had live bait. Due to human scent on some folks' hands, a bit of bait on a plastic bait may help. Commercial scents can suffice. Those of us who are ""of long tooth"" and have studied fish characteristics (since time began ), have possibly mastered some status of ""fish whisperer"" and are able to use artificials/plastics to a satisfactory or better degree. Fish that are in current below a dam, for example, have found they must make a fast decision on whether to hit a presentation, so plastics even can be very successful in those situations. Catching rough fish on artificials/plastics/spinners below dams can be commonplace, I think, for the same reason - drop down to the calmer water, and the odds of catching carp or buffalo on an artificial drop considerably. Just my thoughts. Bill"

6728201,prov1800,2023-03-31 08:14:00,5010,This has always been a debate.Personally iam a live bait guy.Fish do like naturally forage.Iam out on the water most days during our fishing season in NWO.I get very inexperienced fisherman and very experienced fisherman.One thing for sure I'd never do a artificial day of fishing with rookies.Nothing like live bait in that scenario.Ill fool around with artificial when I run out of live stuff.Catching then slows down to a trickle from what the action was with the live.Early spring tends to be a bit better for artificial as most fishing is shallow and find the schools of walleye very aggressive.But as the season goes on and fish start dropping deeper and spreading out on structure fishing with artificial really slows down.When fish lick your minnow and spit it out good luck with a twister tail.My days are usually 10 dozen minnows gone around some time in afternoon.Thats what my guests are hoping for so that's a good amount of fish we catch during the day.Your not going to do that on artificial.plain and simple.
6728223,Pooch,2023-03-31 09:30:00,4618,"Catching walleye on fake bait is my favorite way to fish..... but..it seems to be a mostly a reaction strike. Trolling plastics is my favorite. Anchored and jigging plastics works, but not as well as live bait. Pitching plastics works, too. If the bite ""is on"" then anything catches fish on a feeding binge. I have caught walleye on a bare jig when west wind was blowing into an east shore in a dead end bay. This was just ahead of a storm coming in and it was just stupid fishing/catching. If you are gonna anchor and jig plastics you have to convince the fish to take your offering with how you work the bait. If there is any live forage nearby you might be eating hot dogs for shore lunch.Pooch"

I have had zero luck on Lac Seul with plastics, even in the middle of a bite where even a just remaining part of a minnow catches a fish immediately. I have tried them on our fly ins and pretty much had the same result. You catch a fish to probably every 10 on live bait. I hear people say plastics are as good as live bait and even better?? I fish a quite a bit and have never had that result?"
6727951,Mojo-NC,2023-03-30 09:56:00,1929,"At first I was hesitant to use plastics in place of live minnows, that is, until all of our minnows died while on a fly-in trip because the water was too warm. The dead minnows smelled so bad I quit using them. Once I put on plastics, I caught just as many fish as I did with live bait. During my last trip up to Lac Seul I did not use any live bait at all and caught almost as many fish as the rest of the guys. i would say that live bait did catch more small fish though. In my experience the plastics generally catch larger fish. I use a small paddle tail minnow nose hooked on my spinner rigs and I usually use a Z-Man Minnow-Z on my jigs."

I caught 7 or 8 in the first hour and he didnt get a bite. He finally capitulated. I gave him my rod to use while i redid his setup and I swear he catches a walleye on his first drop with my rod.
