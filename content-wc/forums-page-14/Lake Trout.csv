6735959,prov1800,2023-04-30 11:18:00,5010,Hopefully may 20.Iam done now.Boat project and need it done for when ever ice goes.
6735967,Eckohlt,2023-04-30 11:40:00,3685,"If the ice doesn't go off this year there,you can always go to Minnesota and pound on something,the only problem it might be bullheads.lol"
6735989,prov1800,2023-04-30 13:40:00,5010,I'll stick to NWO.Can always fish of shore here with good success.Äº
6736065,Skywagon,2023-05-01 05:19:00,1106,"I am done now too, the last time I was out (Saturday) the ice measured 24"", however getting onto the ice from the shore is not worth the risk. I officially call it the in-between season until ice out."
6736139,prov1800,2023-05-01 08:18:00,5010,With ice debatable now and have had my fun it's time to take the available time to do some projects.First one is replacing my floor in my boat that has lasted a incredible long time.Worst is the carpet it is gone and has been a couple of years and will get a vinyl treatment.Then some yard stuff and I have to lift my shop a bit which will be easy enough to do.Looking forward to getting into a boat and meeting up with old and new guests.
6735545,prov1800,2023-04-28 19:31:00,5010,Decided we should give lake trout another try.Ryan picked me up this morning and brought the big Honda.Shoreline was a little wet but had no problem.Nice ride across the lake.Bit wet but not bad.But top is starting to get pretty black.Lost a couple more inches but it's still good.We had had a unreal day catching trout.Pretty none stop.Hard to say how many chances we had.Lot of chasing.Forcevery 5-6 we had chasing the lures we maybe caught 1 or 2.We caught around 20 today we figured but not sure.We each took a over and had a tough time trying to get a under but we finally got a couple.Pretty nice day up around 10c.Sunny and cloudy periods with a cool feeling breeze.Will see if we maybe go one more time.Weather looks good and ice will probably go a couple inches a day now.
6735551,N_of_Quibell,2023-04-28 20:23:00,151,Beautiful! Thanks for the update. I'm thinking a couple of weeks.

6735825,Franco,2023-04-30 04:50:00,107,Nice fish! What did you catch them on?
6735837,prov1800,2023-04-30 05:36:00,5010,Mostly on tubes
6735911,Bill Krejca,2023-04-30 09:02:00,6107,Hm. Looks like time to get the boat ready. That last 10 feet to shore appeared to be getting iffy. Bill
6735941,prov1800,2023-04-30 10:30:00,5010,Bit more iffy on way back.lol.Not going again.Boat won't take me long to get ready I serviced it last fall.Working on putting new flooring in right now 22 years of slime and grime took care of my carpet.Decided to go with vynil.
6735955,Eckohlt,2023-04-30 11:04:00,3685,Will that be done by may 20 or next may 2024?
