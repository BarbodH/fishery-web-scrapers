No longer. Anyone know what's up with that? Canada doesn't want US to know their business?

6736877,DeBo,2023-05-04 08:08:00,211,The MODIS Satellites have reached end of life and are scheduled for vaporization later this year from what I read. I’ve noticed the data has been less and less consistent.The sentinel playground site uses some European satellites. Not daily but ver good imagery. You might find some decen imagery from the VIIRS satellites as well. They have a Great Lakes region that might cover where you are looking.I still like MODIS the best for the lakes I track. Kind of sad they are going away. I’ve been tracking ice outs for dang near 20 springs now.https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/sentin...howDates=falsehttps://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/viirs/im...olor_wgs84_fit

Two days ago (May 2) imagery was pretty good - Cliff (left) and Cedar (right) look pretty rotten, but not open yet. The thing that really appeals to my inner geek about Sentinel Hub is that one can download georeferenced imagery for Avenza Maps - not as high-res as say Google Earth, but better than nothing."
