6734775,prov1800,2023-04-25 12:16:00,5010,Ecks on the money.40-70 ft.Dont set hook hard.Tgere mouths are really soft.Can go down with a bottom bouncer and 6-7 ft leader line and run live or artificial small baits

6720811,fred44,2023-03-07 08:04:00,4,Going to Northern lights resort Cedar lake last week of July for first trip to that lake just wondering if you use bottom bouncers for walleye fishing at any time of year.
6720829,prov1800,2023-03-07 08:35:00,5010,You can if you want.Walleyes will be deeper at that time.Bottom bouncing just isn't my thing.Will do it sometimes if vertical jigging is slow but that's rare.Trolling you have to cover more area and slow between bites.Normally fish stack up on smaller area on structure and when you troll away from that structure 80% of the time your in a no fish zone.Nothing wrong with trying it.I do find sometimes you will catch bigger fish trolling flats.Cedar has lots of structure.
6720873,Eckohlt,2023-03-07 09:33:00,3685,John is there much for cabbage in cedar??that's a summertime magnet.
6720895,prov1800,2023-03-07 10:10:00,5010,Tons of cabbage all over.from end to the other.
6721205,fred44,2023-03-08 07:21:00,4,I see they have crappie in that lake do they catch many the fist part of August or is that later in fall I have never brought any crappie gear to Canada
6721207,prov1800,2023-03-08 07:29:00,5010,Catch them throughout the season.You don't need any special gear to catch.walleye rod med/light just fine.jig and minnow works great or some artificial stuff will work to.
6734687,FishFry2012,2023-04-25 05:48:00,27,"I'd agree that it's a really solid fishery, especially from a multispecies perspective. We've fished it for 20 years, though we've never had a whitefish and only one laker on the chain. This is usually at the end of May too. Where are you seeing these? Also, where on boulder are you finding walleye? We've tried it some in narrows and around islands in boulder, but have been very limited. We're typically just jigging in 5-15ft with the occasional crankbait. FF"
6734689,prov1800,2023-04-25 06:04:00,5010,The Chain as you know is pretty clear.Its best in early mornings and late evening.the narrows between cobble and Boulder is a good place for fish but again early and late.both cobble and Boulder have structure.cobble a bit more.End of May you do not need to fish very deep.Better of fishing Indian and Edward
6734703,FishFry2012,2023-04-25 07:24:00,27,"Thanks, Any thoughts on whitefish?"
6718765,dschiebel,2023-03-01 13:14:00,85,"Any info on Clarks Resort KC Indian chain, going up last week in may. Wondering about the resort and fishing thanks"
6718791,Walleye2242,2023-03-01 14:34:00,263,Nice camp and cabins. Prov will jump in and tell you more. For me and only my opinion...i found the fishing to be ok. we went there for 4 years i think.
6718799,prov1800,2023-03-01 14:50:00,5010,"Your right about the camp.Nice cabins and really good boats.Great docking if you bring your own boat.Fishing I would say is better than ok.Just my opion.Walleye very good.Size normally 13-16+""but some 25-30"" can be caught.Early mornings and late evenings are best time to be out after them.Lots of muskies throughout the day and great bass fishing.I don't fish often there in summer only take out few parties.So not a pro out there but have had good fishing.As I mentioned mornings were very good and iam talking 6 am to 9-10 am.Wasnt hard to put 40-60 fish in the boat of all sizes."
6719025,srj,2023-03-02 10:27:00,971,"The chain is really interesting and fun to fish. The lakes are very diverse...from very shallow to deep, cold and clear. We caught walleyes and muskies on all the lakes except Cobble, which is the deep lake trout lake. We caught a couple lakers in Cobble but got into the whitefish and that was really fun. Most of the walleyes were eaters with an occasional 20+. Our biggest was a 26. Most of the muskies were 24 - 36. The lakes are easy to navigate and not very busy. Good luck."
6719029,prov1800,2023-03-02 10:35:00,5010,Did you fish Boulder.Deep there and has some walleye structure in middle of the lake.Very good muskie in the bays there also.
6719333,srj,2023-03-03 10:21:00,971,"John, we never made it into Boulder. I had the old lake maps that were available for all the chain except Boulder. They weren't very good but better than nothing so we skipped Boulder. There is a lot of water to explore on the chain. Fun fishing. There were lots of muskies but no northern pike. Still the case? Really enjoy your vids from Clarks fish houses."
6719439,MikeinMN,2023-03-03 12:44:00,190,"Wayne has a new guy running the show at KC's. I think his name is Randy, and I think he will be able to give you some more direction on the fishing when you get there. He seems to know the Indian Chain very well, and by looking at some pics on his phone, seems to be a pretty good fisherman. Take some musky gear, because there really is a lot of them in there. The camp is really nice, better than most I have stayed at in Canada, and even has a great beach."
6719441,prov1800,2023-03-03 12:44:00,5010,They blocked off the water coming in from Corner lake many years ago to keep pike out of the Indian Lake system that worked for a while but high water still brought them in.Dont get as many of them casting but catch lots from the ice shacks.But through summer you can catch them.I don't fish as often there in summer as I do ice fishing.But the lake does have some huge pike and some very big muskies as well.
