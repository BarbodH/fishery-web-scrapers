6734309,prov1800,2023-04-23 14:55:00,5010,Caught a bunch of trout today on your jigs bill.The smaller yellow ones.
6734325,Eckohlt,2023-04-23 16:32:00,3685,Looks like the North Star lodge guest don't have to go far in the spring to catch a boat load of fish.
6734327,Walleye2242,2023-04-23 16:39:00,263,1st camp i was at in 1979. 7 years old. Arlene Gettings owned the camp.
6734329,Eckohlt,2023-04-23 17:01:00,3685,Did ya clobber a bunch??
6734413,Walleye2242,2023-04-24 07:24:00,263,"I think so? at 7 years old i didnt know what clobbering fish was? haha. I did catch a 10lb pike on a 5 of diamonds daredevil. that was fun for my age. We caught walleye all day. Back then we trolled rapala, thin fins, hot n tots and lazy ikes. Pitched spoons for pikes in weed beds. I think we changed lakes after a few years because of mercury or something????"
6734419,Bill Krejca,2023-04-24 07:29:00,6107,"Good to hear this, they seldom fail. On the really light jigs, I attach a weight 2 ft ahead to get them down. Bill"
