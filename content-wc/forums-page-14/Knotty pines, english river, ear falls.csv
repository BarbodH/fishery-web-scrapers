6313688,UpNorthGuy,2019-04-21 18:21:00,53,Not this year. I won’t be there until June 22 for a week. Then again about September 12 for a week.
6683114,Spurgery,2022-08-30 12:55:00,79,Anyone willing to share best areas to target smallmouth around this area of the river?
6684210,UpNorthGuy,2022-09-05 08:50:00,53,We've all ways had luck finding small mouth bass in Goose along the south shore in or near Moose Creek. Weed line in Johnson up against the NW shore. In July this year we stumbled into a few on a mid lake hump in Wegg and I can't explain why that happened. Paul
6684538,Spurgery,2022-09-06 19:29:00,79,Thanks for the reply Paul…&#x1f917;
6711435,Psrome,2023-02-03 05:29:00,3,Are there any other camps or boats from other camps around this area?
6712877,UpNorthGuy,2023-02-08 11:12:00,53,There is one other resort on that system south of the Manitou Dam. Like KPL they are a smaller operation. There are a handful of private cabins on the system as well. Maybe 6 or 8
6716175,ia bhtr,2023-02-20 12:05:00,212,Wilcox has always treated us very well on Smallies as well
6736909,UpNorthGuy,2023-05-04 11:34:00,53,Ice is quickly leaving the English River at Knotty Pines Lodge
6737027,ia bhtr,2023-05-05 09:02:00,212,One month from tomoro we will be in that picture &#x1f642;
6737029,Eckohlt,2023-05-05 09:05:00,3685,Be sure to post that picture!!
6216462,UpNorthGuy,2018-07-02 18:54:00,53,"Yup, Yup"
6218004,Guest,2018-07-06 10:12:00,0,Anyone been up here lately? Curious what the water levels are like and how the fishing has been. Thanks!
6228356,UpNorthGuy,2018-08-01 07:14:00,53,"Just got back from my second trip of the year to Knotty Pines. Brought along my 15 year old daughter for her first trip to Canada. I was a bit leary bringing her, she likes fishing but doesn’t love it. She ended up having a great time, fishing, enjoying the boat rides and scenery, playing with Jaxon Norms dog it’s was probably a highlight for her. Fishing was a bit on the slow side but it is late July and it’s to be expected. Water is low and the water temps are high (76 in some bays)Norm’s hospitality was as good as always. He’s currently working on another cabin and that should be done by mid-August."
6228416,Guest,2018-08-01 09:49:00,0,UpNorthGuy - Thanks for the report. How slow are we talking? Is it more of a Morning/Late aftenoon bite? What types of tactics seemed to be the most productive for you?
6228458,UpNorthGuy,2018-08-01 11:45:00,53,"Good early morning bite, died about 11am. Still caught fish but it wasn't gang busters. Weather was really warm, water temps are warm and there isn't much water moving through the system. Conditions are always changing, what I say this week may not and probably not translate to next week."
6232754,Guest,2018-08-13 10:12:00,0,Heading up to Knotty Pines this week and wondering if anyone has been up on the system recently and has an reports to share. Thanks!
6233074,maddogg,2018-08-14 07:54:00,178,I'm interested in Naughty Pines as I understand it there are individual rooms you sleep in. Where do you put your food and were do you cook it?
6233226,UpNorthGuy,2018-08-14 11:38:00,53,"Maddog,All the ""rooms"" have kitchens and living space, along with sleeping. Kind of apartment style in one large building. Norm has completed 2 or 3 individual cabins."
6311206,UpNorthGuy,2019-04-14 19:14:00,53,Looks like English River is breaking up. The owner of Knotty Pines Lodge made it by boat out to camp today. Season is coming on fast. If anybody is looking for a good camp on a great fishery this is it. Visit Norm at www.knottypineslodge.com
6313684,ia bhtr,2019-04-21 18:04:00,212,"Paul , are you going to be at camp the week of June 10th , we will be back with 4 boats/8 guys , Dan"
5500825,Bakefish,2017-04-26 07:38:00,1077,"Hi Grumps. Knotty has a large building split off into apartments. I've never been there, but passed by it dozens of times. Might be perfect for a solo fisherman. It does have kitchen facilities. It's a boat in lodge and you can bring your boat. There is parking by the dam. The dam draws many locals to fish for walleye which is concerning to me, although I have never heard of any problems with parked vehicles. I'll be stopping by there this spring to see what they have to offer. The ramp by the dam looks to be pretty decent."
5505306,nwifisherman,2017-04-27 16:52:00,9,There is a lodge with a kitchens in each section and then there are also bunkhouses with only beds. Best way to get more info is to give Norm a call. It's not the fanciest place around but the fishing is phenomenal and for us last year the living arrangements worked just fine. You can bring your own boat in also. Norm will meet you at the ramp and help you load all your gear and groceries then you follow him through some rapids to the camp.
5541969,ia bhtr,2017-05-13 20:49:00,212,"We will be arriving June 10 with 8 in the group , based on what our locals did up there same time last year , should be a great trip and they were very happy with Norm and what he offers , 1st time in Canada in 30 years , this next month is going to drraaagggggg by waiting for our trip ,"
5542113,Grumps,2017-05-13 22:21:00,134,Thank you for the information gentlemen! Soon as I get my tomatoes and peppers in it will be time to head north.
5707474,Guest,2017-08-08 11:43:00,0,Heading up to Knotty Pines the Friday after Labor Day. I've never gone up there this late in the season. How is the traffic crossing the border in IF? Anyone have a recent fishing report from the English river area? Looking forward to this early fall adventure on the English River and saying hi to Norm.
5728041,ia bhtr,2017-08-20 10:49:00,212,"Good luck on your trip and let us know how it went when you get back , say Hi to Norm from Dan & Bruce in the 2 black Pro Vs from Iowa that were up there June 10th , retiring the end of this year , so more fishing time next year , already booked early June next year , a fall trip like you are doing would be a nice finish to the summer"
6198462,Guest,2018-05-22 15:22:00,0,"I'm heading up to Knotty pines the 3rd week of August this year to fish. Just wondering if anyone has experience with this stretch of water in August? Want to know if I should expect deeper water walleye fishing, or since the water has current and stained color, do the walleye not venture out as deep as a clear lake. Thanks!"
6198744,Bakefish,2018-05-23 07:13:00,1077,No need to fish deep in these waters. My biggest walleye was caught in mid September in 8 feet of water. Like someone told me...just look for the point with a pine tree on it.
6215244,UpNorthGuy,2018-06-29 20:33:00,53,"After starts and stops, mistakes and miscues Norm finally has internet at camp!1"
6216438,ia bhtr,2018-07-02 17:48:00,212,U mean cell phones actually work now ?????????? coooolllll
4895297,Simmy32,2016-06-03 08:04:00,6,"Skid - We left you a map in the outpost. Just look for ""goose juice"" and you will be amazed by how truly close you are to great fishing."
4896401,nwifisherman,2016-06-03 14:07:00,9,I'm going up for the first time ever on June 18-24 and staying at knotty pines. Brand new to the area so any help would be appreciated. Any tips on what to bring and ideas on where to start would be awesome.
4896609,Bakefish,2016-06-03 15:12:00,1077,Like someone told me the first time I went there. Just find the point with a pine tree on it.
4899257,UpNorthGuy,2016-06-04 15:02:00,53,"Got back from Knotty Pines yesterday. Fishing is really hot right now, not a lot of thought needs to be put into finding the fish. Entrance to Johnson was really good. Most points in Wegg are producing as well.Camp is coming along great. He's got a bunch of ""new to him"" boats up and running. (Alumacraft Dominator's with 40 Hp 4-Stroke Merc's).Water is on the low side but with the recent rain its slowly coming up.Heard Mike Anderson is back at his camp. Mike let go the couple that was running it last year and he's doing it himself. (Good Luck)Paul"
4903849,Skid1966,2016-06-06 09:04:00,14,"Thanks Simms and rip, glad you guys had a good trip,"
4903857,Skid1966,2016-06-06 09:08:00,14,"Leaving for the goose outpost on friday, taking two new guys, hope the fishing stays hot"
4904233,Bakefish,2016-06-06 10:28:00,1077,"How do you like the ""apartment"" style of lodging?"
4905945,UpNorthGuy,2016-06-06 17:41:00,53,"Good. I've stayed there 3 years now and have not had any problems with the accommodations. That being said Norms got One of the 3 new cabins up and running this week. The new cabin sleeps 6. The other 2 are being worked on and will be done sometime this summer. He's got plans to do 3 more cabins on the north side of the property, they'll be done sometime in the future."
5487178,ripinlipstaknnames,2017-04-19 21:48:00,1,"sorry it took nearly a year to post a report about our 2016 trip(usually I cant wait to get back and share) but here it is. details aren't as fresh in my mind as when I normally post our trip results within a week or two of returning but it was awesome yet again. it was our first time staying with norm at knotty pines but have fished here on this water for nearly a decade now, going in june every year. norm was a great guy and eager to please, went out of his way to come talk to us every day and make sure we were having a good time and had everything we needed. we had a group of 10 last year and caught nearly 2000 walleyes! this is an extremely accurate number, give or take a few, since we use clicker counters to keep track. this doesn't count the tons of bass, northerns, a couple small muskies and the ""other"" fish-whitefish, perch, mooneye, etc. it was a different bite than 2015 in that the numbers of walleyes were a bit down but average size was way better, lots more of the low to mid 20 inch fish coming into the boat and at times hard to catch ""eaters"". the biggest northern of the week was 41 inches and the biggest walleye was 30 3/4 inches, couldn't quite pinch the tail enough to make 31! this was the second 30 plus inch walleye our group has caught here over the years and the biggest one to date. it was also the first walleye over about 19 inches that we have caught out of here that hasn't gone back to swim another day, it is a bit bitter sweet keeping a fish like that but it will live on forever on the wall in my dads basement. headed back up to see norm again this june and the wait is really starting to get tough. anyone else have anything to share from the rest of last year's season? who's going this year and when? fish on!"
5499689,Grumps,2017-04-25 18:40:00,134,"Just retired and looking for several, me only trips. Sounds like you folks were pretty happy with Knotty Pines Lodge. Just checked out the website. It's a little sparse which is fine by me. Good fishing, no internet and great rates makes me love it already! Do wonder what ""apartment style living area"" is? Assume you bring your own groceries. Any chance on bringing your own boat? Thanks for any info!"
4802746,ripnlipstaknnames,2016-05-04 09:41:00,27,"Wanted to make a new thread in this new camp and see if anyone on this site has been there yet or has a trip planned for this year. We have been fishing this stretch of the English for a number of years in a row now but haven't stayed at knotty pines yet(just re opened last year). If anyone has been here that has anything to share about the camp, or just fishing this stretch in general even if from a different camp that would be great. We have always done extremely well here and head up June 4 th this year. Always fun to stir up a little chatter to read and help pass the last 30 days (not that I'm counting) until we leave"
4803226,Bakefish,2016-05-04 12:19:00,1077,I'll be at Anderson's the week after you.
4871857,UpNorthGuy,2016-05-25 20:43:00,53,"I'll be heading up to Knotty Pines May 29th for a week of fishing and relaxing. My crew visited Norm last year and it was really nice. Norm is doing a good job of getting the resort going the right direction. It had been closed/abandoned for a few seasons and was in need of Norm's TLC. Fishing last season was beyond spectacular, we couldn't ask for anything better. You can find out more about the resort at http://knottypineslodge.com/ If you contact Norm tell him Paul sent ya..."
4872385,Bakefish,2016-05-26 07:33:00,1077,"Good luck Paul, no doubt you'll slay them. Let us know how you do. I'm interested in water levels."
4872625,UpNorthGuy,2016-05-26 08:41:00,53,Depending on cell service and Wi-Fi i'll give out a water level update sometime next week.Norm is working on getting internet/wifi out to the resort.
4873569,SinOrSwim,2016-05-26 15:14:00,1528,"lol That is code for........maybe next year........maybe. Have a great trip!!!!!(I do not know the owner, just making a joke)"
4881489,Skid1966,2016-05-30 11:24:00,14,has anyone been to Andersons outpost ? down the lake from Manitou falls
4884961,ripnlipstaknnames,2016-05-31 11:03:00,27,"we have fished this water for the last 8 years or so. this will be our first time staying at Knotty. we have stayed at the andersons outpost the last 4 or 5 years. feel free to message me if you have questions, ill answer what i can. ill try to check this thread once or twice more before we leave on friday!"
4885097,Skid1966,2016-05-31 11:33:00,14,"Thanks we will be going in on the june 11th, any help pointing us in the right direction for some walleye close to the outpost would be great. first time on this part of the english river. any falls close to the outpost?"
4885825,ripnlipstaknnames,2016-05-31 15:04:00,27,"no real falls near the outpost, as far as walleye, you can find them almost anywhere throughout the system. we catch them on all kinds of tactics, jigging, casting cranks, casting soft plastics, and bottom bouncing, rarely have to use any live bait. biggest tip i can give is if its calm, fish moving water, if its breezy, follow the wind, any wind blown bays, points or rocky shorelines will hold fish. the windier it is the shallower you will find them, often in 3-4 ft of water on windy days, the lighter the wind just slide deeper and they wont be far. with the dark stained river water we rarely have to fish deeper than 10-12 feet although we have caught fish in 25-30 at times but thats rare, especially when we go in june. have a great trip and pm me if you want more details, happy to share."
