6735033,Eckohlt,2023-04-26 18:56:00,3685,The fun never ends in n.w Ontario.a great day to be on the ice!
6735039,prov1800,2023-04-26 19:16:00,5010,That's what I love about having 4 seasons.Always something going on.

The ice is still most of the way up to the handles on my ice auger at our crappie spot, just the same it won't be long before it starts pulling away from the shoreline and the fun will be over. The crappie were biting, but the walleye even more so, probably caught 3 walleye for every crappie, they were aggressive. My wife skied out to where we were fishing yesterday and took some pictures along the way. The eagles are back in full force and flocks of sandhill cranes has been passing over in the last couple of days, spring is coming."
6735115,Eckohlt,2023-04-27 06:15:00,3685,So probably 3ft of ice?
6735117,prov1800,2023-04-27 06:27:00,5010,Defiantly a nice day.Ended up a bit breezy where we were but being as warm as it was that was no problem.Our ice had defiantly lost a couple of inches.
6735173,Skywagon,2023-04-27 09:34:00,1106,"Guessing 30"" or so on our walleye lake, the trout lakes like John was fishing on never have as much ice to begin with as they always freeze-up later in the season. Depending on forecast rain showers I may go back out again this afternoon, will try to remember to measure thickness."
6735175,prov1800,2023-04-27 09:38:00,5010,Sounds like you could drive your truck out there.
6735177,Eckohlt,2023-04-27 10:35:00,3685,Or a train.lol
