570177,scar,2007-12-14 05:54:00,196,"colin, i've posted questions a couple time regarding the south east end. my son and i started fishing lac seul 3 years ago as we have a place on minitkai and have been some what discouraged with the fishing on there. we put in at deception and make the long ride up to bear narrows,three sisters,ski doo point etc. area once in a while. sure travel over a lot of water on the way up there. went to senn bay once in may and didn't catch much only to learn upon our return to the landing that the eyes aren't really in there yet in may. would you be willing to to share some spots/locations in deception or hudson landing areas including time of year. thanks much! scar"
570191,Guest,2007-12-14 13:19:00,0,"Scar, whereabouts is your cabin on Minnitaki. I could probably give you some info close to where you are. Ever caught a monster laker? I help look after strawberry island by rice river. How often do you come up? If I had a free day, maybe I could show you some spots. I do well on Minnitaki, Abram, Pelican, Botsford as well, as I grew up on them...but not as consistently as Lac Seul. Drop me an email @ [email protected], and we'll exchange some info or spots."
570192,Guest,2007-12-14 13:40:00,0,">What area's or stratagies would you suggest during post spawn >time on the eastern end of the lake? Immediately after spawn, the big females seem to move through in schools. Stick to where you catch a big girl(especially if in a narrows), and more will follow. Getting to the males(eaters) can be tough at this time because they are still on busy fertilizing.You can force feed them by using live bait in the fast water....but it can be slow and tough on tackle. If you catch a Bass up shallow, it means they are scoping out their beds, and therefore the water temp has risen. The walleyes are far gone from spawn, and feeding in the shallows. Fish bass spawnings structures for walleye, and you'll be amazed at what you get them in. As soon as the bass are up, I stop targeting walleyes, and target smallies.....but end up catching more nice walleyes and pike as I do this. It happens like this everywhere. A lot of times you'll set the hook, and the fish is already in the boat. If you preffer trolling, which I don't, this is a great time to troll walleye divers nice and shallow. There are a ton of fish around...just keep in mind that they are scattered and still not schooled up thick...but they do feed in very similiar areas. * Here's my #1 hint.....I go through a ton of slip-bobbers at this time of year. ...and if that doesn't give it all away, fish with me sometime...LOL"

569964,Guest,2007-12-09 08:24:00,0,"Do you find that during the opener, the fishing has not been as good near Deception or Pelican rapids. It seams we have to spend more time up by Chamberlain & Birch Narrows."

569965,Guest,2007-12-09 10:03:00,0,"I find that opener varies from year to year, and what I do corresponds with how early the spring arrives. Last year the bass were already bedding down, and the walleyes were long gone from the spawning areas, and already feeding in the shallows. Chamberlain narrows is a fish funnel in the spring, as is all of the other areas that connect two large bodies of water in the lake system. The majority of my time is spent fishing areas not so popular as chamberlain(and not so far up!). There are endless options that can give you just as good of action, and trophies...without having to go so far. On the bottom east end, alot of fish spawn in Pelican falls, Crooked rapids, Manitou and alot of smaller tributaries towards Bindo bay. Chamberlain is the start of a great walleye migration the runs down and follows the north shore...heading west. When this starts, a different point or or main feeding area goes off every day. This time of year requires alot of trial and error, but if you keep moving you do get rewarded. I never spend more than five minutes per spot, unless it is worth it. That's where experience kicks in, knowing where to check. When these spots first go off, there is nothing like it! The lower end works the same, as the spot with a majority of fish migrating towards the main basin. The bigger females move first and the males can be touger to find. I can remember catching a single 30"" walleye on a main lake hump in forty feet, while the majority were still in the rivers. The walleye population is huge and the options on lac seul are endless, wherever you fish."

570088,Guest,2007-12-11 06:29:00,0,"We have fished the same week for 26 years and for the most part, the fish are harder to find on the southeast side after they have moved out of Pelican rapids or Marchington falls area's. It use to be that we could go to area's such as ""hole in the wall"" or loon rapids or even places like zig-zag and find where they are just starting to feed after the spawn, but the last 4-6 years we've been taking the longer trips up north where it has been more consistant."
570094,Guest,2007-12-11 09:50:00,0,"I have hit them well in all of those places, but it's all timing. The smaller sections spots still go off in a big way, but the fish move through faster. Hole in the wall for example still happens, but it seems for a very brief period...but when you hit em' there...wow. My favourite time is the mayfly hatch, when no one seems to be able to find them in their regular haunts, that's when I excel,they congregate in very unique areas that you would not normally target walleyes."
570103,orchard frank,2007-12-11 15:27:00,1900,"I have never been there for the opener, but early June a few times (over the years, mid to late August became our favorite time). During our June trips there were times when we really smoked them in Webster Bay and the water north of Frenchman's Head. I agree about the bug hatches, fish go nuts. We've fished some gnat hatches (shore was covered with gulls walking around) and were throwing out jigs right on the beach, dragging them into the water, catching eyes in a foot of water."
