557064,Guest,2006-05-09 21:07:00,0,I was just curious where you could get a good fishing map of wabaskang. Any news of how the water level is this spring?
557066,Trailerguy,2006-05-09 21:14:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Last week I was told the water level hasn't risen much. Even though there was good snow cover to melt, not much rain has fallen this spring. Most camps will give you a map, or Dutchies Store handles them. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
