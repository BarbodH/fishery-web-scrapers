570156,idapaul,2007-12-13 15:20:00,82,i was hoping to see a few more reports on ciff lake in the other post. i get the idea there isn't a large population of northern.what about musky. if rose would list the portage lakes maybe some of you guys could tell me what is there for fish. thanks
570169,Rose_Cliff Lake,2007-12-13 18:52:00,116,"idapaul Thank you for asking. Portage lakes are Pickerel, 3 Sided and Beaton Lakes are Walleye, Northern and Musky. By river system from Cliff Lake are Mystery, Evening, and Twilight. Same as above. By road is April Lake, Walleye and Northern. And by ATV is Schultz Lake which is Walleye, Northern and Lake Trout.

Next spring you should get to know David from Pickerel Creek Camp. He has a cache on Schultz as well, but comes in from the south end, it's not too far off a decent road I beleive, Davids easygoing, perhaps he'd help you out. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
570198,Rose_Cliff Lake,2007-12-15 13:40:00,116,"Trailerguy, Thank you for the tip, we will certainly look him up since we share some of the same water. I know there's been some friction with the previous owners and other resorts. We want peace, not friction. There's plenty of water for all of us. We actually want to partner with others because we have such a great Lake Trout population, and most don't. Rent a boat for the day type thing. Rose"
