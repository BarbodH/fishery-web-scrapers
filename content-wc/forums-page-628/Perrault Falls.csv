570207,Trailerguy,2007-12-16 13:52:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Dutchies is a convience store with beer and liquer. They also carry some fresh vegtables, canned and dry goods,an excellent place to pickup your lisence. The Sunset resteruant, south a mile or so down 105 has good food, the problem is to catch it open. The owner is in poor health and closes weekends and by 8 or so at night. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

570208,Guest,2007-12-16 14:47:00,0,I believe there is another restaurant about 9 miles north of Perrault Falls on the east side of the highway. We stopped there several times and there was always a couple of pulpwood trucks out front. I won't brag about the food. I remember the building being light blue.
