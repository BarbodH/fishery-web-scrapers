A few islands, a waterfall, etc.. Walleye fishing was again just o.k. when compared with the lakes connected to it. Caught small walleye in the currents near the falls. I have heard that the lake is a decent smallmouth lake, but i never targeted them. Went there a few times and never had success in terms of numbers or size as compared to abrahms and minnitaki. Best of luck."
