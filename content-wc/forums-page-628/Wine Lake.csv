570262,Guest,2007-12-21 21:33:00,0,Has anybody seen Tin Cann? I think he might have gotten busted again this year for bad fishing techniques and bad beer. Tin Cann are you going to the Wine this year? Let us know all your knowledge.
555914,Guest,2006-04-03 11:53:00,0,Anyone going to wine lake this summer. Will exchange info.
555950,Guest,2006-04-04 18:36:00,0,"Going to Wine in Mid June and just wondering where to fish for walleye and northern during this time. Also, what is the lake trout fishing like?"
555956,Guest,2006-04-05 12:17:00,0,"I am also going in mid June. Walleye n' Pike seem to be most active in smaler lakes. I guess it depends on what kind of spring they have, water level seems to make big difference too. Last few trips have found Lakers to be up shallow I guess because of late spring."
555978,Guest,2006-04-06 08:42:00,0,How shallow are you talking for the lake trout? In the main lake or the lakes that are connected? As for walleye what smaller lakes would you hit first?
556000,Guest,2006-04-07 09:15:00,0,Have found Lakers in less than 10ft of water back in dynamite bay also on sandy beach and turnaround. I always try Mud lake first then Ghost and Turnaround. Tipover is always a option if nuthing happening on main lakes.Have you been to wine before . I've been going off and on for 20+ yrs.
556079,Guest,2006-04-08 07:49:00,0,This will be my second trip and it is a wonderful secluded camp. I really liked the remoteness but I had to work a little to find walleye. How shallow do you fish for walleye during mid june? Do you just jig for walleye are do you do something different?

556094,Guest,2006-04-08 20:40:00,0,Anybody else besides big wally been to Wine? Is it worth going up to Wabaskang for a day? Is there any good fishing back by annishinabi falls? Where can we get a good map for Wine and the connecting lakes? Is there big northern up in the cedar river that goes to the portage? Is night fishing productive and where would I try?

556172,Guest,2006-04-12 14:14:00,0,"Good fishing always by the annishabi falls. Be careful if you go to Wine there is a undercover Mounty that hangs there a lot. He is short guy that is always smokin cheap cigars. We see him on the water alot just riding around aimlessly, not really a fisherman. He usually has a boat full of Big Tupperware containers ,when he first pulled up on us we thought he was some homeless guy. He keeps all his DNR crap in those tubs, he checked all our fish and acted like he never seen a Walleye before. What a jerk, we were fish legal but had open beer.He took all our beer,fish and gin but no ticket."
