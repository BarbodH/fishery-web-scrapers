570184,Guest,2007-12-14 08:46:00,0,"Thanks for all your support guys. I am the organizer for one basic reason in my mind......I am the only one who can do it right! I put up with all the STUFF, because if I left it up to someone else they would screw it up. Case in point....2 years ago My cousin and I left it up to 2 of his friends from MO. to set up a Wild Boar hunt in OK. With less than 2 weeks before we were going to leave there was no word from anyone about details, so we called. Long Story short....the Ozark MT. rednecks thought the other had made the reservations when in fact niether had, no reservations, no trip! I was ready to take the time off anyway and go shoot me a ""good ol boy"". I have always been the organizer and my father before me, must be in the blood."
570250,fishinnut,2007-12-20 08:00:00,642,How will they retrain all those kids who work the gas stations/stores? They always give change in Canadian for your US dollar. Might be a hard habit to break!!
570254,Guest,2007-12-20 13:57:00,0,"Why would that change? Give them U.S. money and they'll give you Canadian change. We'll just have to give more U.S. money and get less Canadian change, that's all."
570302,Capn Hooker,2007-12-26 15:57:00,333,"That's the ticket! All those meetings are at the local watering hole! ""I'm going to a planning meeting dear, be back later."" The more meetings the better. Ya gotta work out those details."
570145,Guest,2007-12-13 12:35:00,0,I quit a job once because they had too many meetings.
570146,Guest,2007-12-13 13:04:00,0,"Steve and JDP... you guys sound like you could be resort owners. A group won't show up until you have there money... even if they say they are. I still get a lot of people asking why the deposit is so much... it's because I can't afford for people to not show up, but still take the cabin!"
570149,Guest,2007-12-13 14:02:00,0,Now that is funny!!!!
570150,Guest,2007-12-13 14:09:00,0,"Have you ever had a group show up expecting to have a cabin reserved for them without ever having sent in a deposit of some kind? I have a reservation for next year, at least I think I do, and I am going to be sending a deposit as soon as I know who is in my group for sure and get $$$ from each of them."
570151,Guest,2007-12-13 14:16:00,0,">Have you ever had a group show up expecting to have a cabin >reserved for them without ever having sent in a deposit of >some kind? >I have a reservation for next year, at least I think I do, and >I am going to be sending a deposit as soon as I know who is in >my group for sure and get $$$ from each of them. Actually... yes, that happened to me this year. However, that was due to the fact that the previous owner had a ""deal"" with them where they'd just come up the same time every year. I was unaware of the deal, and the previous owner left in such a hurry, he forgot to inform me of everything. Luckily I had the space, and the food for them."
570154,JDP,2007-12-13 14:40:00,1457,"Kruger, The ""meetings"" are: - 25% of the time (no more than 30 minutes) spent on planning the trip. - 75% talking fishing and having a beer with old friends meeting new friends. No one falls asleep unless they have a few too many! As the organizer of the group, I need to make sure I have a solid/committed group before making a deposit to the resort. As I said works for our group, everyone looks forward to getting together. We also get many of us together for Sport Shows (NW Sport Show for example). JDP"
570159,Guest,2007-12-13 15:53:00,0,"Steve - anyone who has ever had to organize one of those ""trips"" understands what you go through and WHY! It's a lot of extra work and I'd often thought how nice it'd be to change organizers each year and I do believe after the chore had gone around the group how much easier it would be after a few years to get the commitments and money!"
570160,JDP,2007-12-13 16:05:00,1457,Amen! :bowdown:
570163,Guest,2007-12-13 16:56:00,0,I was just giving you a hard time. We do most of ours by email and our normal running into each other. We have taken as many as 11 and as few as 2.
570178,Guest,2007-12-14 06:34:00,0,"I'm with you Steve. Organizing trips is a lot of work. My group(s) has/have completely fallen apart. Thankfully I was able to hook up with Mr. Walleye and his group. With any luck, I'll be able to leave all the hard work for him from now on ;-)"
569999,bigbuck,2007-11-30 11:56:00,69,"Well, the loonie is below parity, it's quoted at 99.92 cents U.S. I just had a lunch meeting with a well known money manager and he thinks that the loonie will go back down into the 80 cent range at some point in '08. We'll see, trying to figure out foreign exchange is a black art and my crystal ball currently has a crack in it and no one seems to be able to fix it. A few bucks either way won't kill a fishing trip for a die hard. The wife just gets less spending money....LOL."
569967,Rose_Cliff Lake,2007-12-09 12:58:00,116,"We have gone to the same camp for 10 years and each year there was a minor increase, but every year they made some good upgrades. We now own a camp [as of 11-2-07] and because we're new, we are holding the 2007 rates.[in US dollars] For the 2008 season we will have a new septic system, 1 new cabin, an all purpose building which will house fish cleaning, bait, general store, gathering place and storage. [ about $120,000 in improvements ] So I'd have to say that we'll raise the rates in 2009, but we're making things better, not just putting money in our pocket. I agree that it's to be expected in most cases."

570070,Guest,2007-12-10 06:38:00,0,"I have a question for any camp owners; if you (or any camp owner) decide to go to asking for payment in Canadian money and then the U.S. dollar comes on strong, will you go back to asking for U.S. payment? I ask because in the newsletter from an outfitter I've used in the past; they state that they are going to payment in Canadian money. Just curious how owners plan to handle the situation."
570071,Guest,2007-12-10 07:45:00,0,"We're staying in U.S. I never really saw an advantage in switching in the first place. Infact, we held off raising our prices, and now that the US dollar is getting better (compared to the Canadian dollar) we won't have to!!! If 99% of your customers are US citizens, then the total amount spent is the same, wether in US or Canadian. I think they were just worried about raising their prices repeatedly. It's a marketing thing. If the US dollar drops, and a resort keeps their prices in Canadian the same... it doesn't look as bad. But, if the US dollar drops, and a resort raises their US prices (to make the same profit)... people get upset. I won't be switching. Unless the US dollar gets down to $.50, we'll make yearly adjustments (good or bad) to ease that blow."
570072,Guest,2007-12-10 07:46:00,0,"Also, I didn't even answer your question... sorry. I would guess that eventually, if the US dollar gets stronger, and stays that way... owners will revert back to charging in US."
570087,Guest,2007-12-10 21:46:00,0,"In the mail today I recieved a very nice Christmas card and note from the camp we go to on LS, along with the rate sheet for 2008. No changes in weekly rates from 2007, and in US funds. This was a very pleasant surprise, I anticipated at least a 10% rise but I will take it. Now if only the rest of my group would decide if they are going to go."
570090,Pooch,2007-12-11 07:13:00,4619,You mean our group isn't the only one that has a guy or two who can't seem to make up their mind or commit until after we've replaced him!!?? I suppose human nature is the same every where. Pooch
570141,Guest,2007-12-13 10:22:00,0,"Isn't it amazing...these same guys will ask if they can go along or be included in the next trip, but when push comes to shove they have to ask the real boss (wife), then the other boss (work), then check with the kids, mother-in-law, bowling league, co-ed softball team, and astrologist to make sure it's OK. My Goodness....I've decided to set a new rule..... ""you have exacly 7 days from time of invite, otherwise the invite is hereby recinded, and no other invite will ever be forthcomming unless accompanied by at least a $100 non-refundable deposit"" I need a new set of friends that have grown a pair!"
570142,JDP,2007-12-13 11:43:00,1457,"For our annual trip consisting of 8-9 guys I have created a process that seems to work: 1) In September I send letters with pertinent information regarding next year's trip (dates,resort info,estimated cost, etc) to anyone who has participated in the past or who has shown even casual interest. I encourage guys to bring along others that may be interested. I indicate an October meeting will be held (of about 1-2 hours at a local watering hole) where we will review the information. I also indicate that those that participated last year have the ""first right of refusal"" and are ""penciled in"" and will be asked to inform the group of their intentions at the meeting. If someone is unable to attend the meeting they can call me regarding their intentions to participate. Before the meeting, I can guarantee returning participants a spot. But I cannot guarantee a spot a new participant before the meeting. 2) At the meeting I confirm the decisions of the guys with the ""right of first refusal"". Then work to fill out the group. I inform everyone that a $200 deposit per person is required by December 1st. The depossit is necessary to show committment. The deposit can be refunded only due to serious issues like health, employment status, etc.--- I have yet to refund a deposit. 4) After the meeting I again e-mail everyone and provide a status of the trip. Again I state the requirement for the $200 deposit by December 1st. 3) Should a deposit not be recieved by December 1st, it is understood that a replacement will be sought for that spot. 4) The goal is to have all deposits for the group in place by Jan.1. then I make the deposit at the All Canada Show in early Jan. 5) I also hold a meeting in April for menu planning, driving itenarary, cabin responsibilities, etc. This has worked very well for our group."

Paying in American dollar seems pretty standard, and since USD is weak as compared right now, it will help the resort out if the USD gets stronger again... I'm o.k with it...because the amount of money I pay only goes up by what they raise their rates. I don't see the gain they make if the USD gets stronger. Won't stop me from going. To me, one trip a year is worth it to visit their country even if it costs me a few extra $$ to do so. I think it is pretty relative... Steve"

Now that the dollar has sunk to even money with the Canadian dollar they have to raise their rates to make money. Can´t say as I blame them. You´re lucky it was only $20.
