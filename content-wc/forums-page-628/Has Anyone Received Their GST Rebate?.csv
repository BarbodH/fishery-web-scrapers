569632,Bill Krejca,2007-10-24 11:45:00,6107,"Rh, I think the point that a lot of folks have missed is that the Canadian authorities simply changed the law. Because different rules are now in effect, the nice refund that we all got in the past is no longer going to be realized."
569633,Guest,2007-10-24 12:14:00,0,"I did a fly-in out of Nestor Falls in May, filed the paperwork (forms, receipts, etc...)in mid June, and received my rebate check in September."
569697,Guest,2007-11-01 18:32:00,0,thanks steve of madison. I will try but opening like that dont come up very ofton. I will keep my eyes open though.
569856,Guest,2007-11-22 02:46:00,0,"Came back from Wenasaga Lodge this fall, and received my GST rebate back , before I left, the new rules applied on how their package plan worked... They were honest enough and explained how it now works, rather then screwing their customers out of their rebate. I appreciated how they returned the monies owed to me, and if I was to recommend a camp with honest people that try their hardest to make your stay in Canada a trip to remember, I would definately recommend Wenasaga for your next trip with family or friends. If you're looking for a vacation with both value and honesty, I would check out their website at www.wenasaga.com. I'm sure you won't be disappointed!"
569867,Guest,2007-11-25 08:38:00,0,"I just got my rejection letter. It does say essentially that they could not determine what other services besides lodging I received, and listed ""tour guide"", as one of the other services that would have made me eligible for the rebate. We had employed a guide during our trip, so is a fishing guide the same as a tour guide. If the receipt from our lodge included the guide, I think I would have gotten the money. Next year I will ask the lodge to include the guide on the receipt."
569878,Guest,2007-11-28 09:45:00,0,Just got my rebate in the mail yesterday and cashed the check today. It did take longer than in years past. We were up the first week of August and sent in the paper work the next week. Mark
569924,Guest,2007-12-03 11:13:00,0,"Ours were rejected also. Reason given was that we needed something like 50% of the billing had to be for ""services"". Not explanation from the Canadians as to what qualifies for services.I never understood why the had a GST and a refund in the first place.The three camps we fish camps we fish have been overwhelmed with request for an explanation."

It >does not make sense to me that resort owners are struggling >and now the government puts one more nail in the coffin by >pulling the rebate. You have large sales taxes in many places I have visited...California, Florida, etc. The rebate program was axed because of lack of usage. Only a small percentage of guests eligible were using it. The rebate had nothing to do with resort owners. Southern Ontario drives the tourism machine here, not Northern Ontario. The money brought in from resorts is a drop in the bucket compared to places like the Toronto to Niagara area."
569466,Guest,2007-10-12 22:00:00,0,I see you miss the whole point of this excercise. the casnadian government now knows that most of the camps are owned by americans of U.S. citizenship. they know if they raise the rates through canceling the rebates the americans will stop keeping the U.S. owned camps open. this way the camps will have to be sold and with their more valued dollor the canadians will be able to buy all those camps back! dont you get it. those kanucks are really clever.

569473,Guest,2007-10-14 05:04:00,0,"At the border I was told that rebates were only being made for package deals that included more than just renting a cabin, i.e. cabin, meals and a boat. I told the agent that I purchased the modified American plan that included the cabin and meals, but brought my own boat. My bill did not show that, so she suggested I have the cabin owner issue a new bill showing that I did purchase a package deal and she said that would get a reimbursement. I did exactly what she said and sent in the revised bill with the proper form and about 5 months later I received a rejection letter saying my claim did not meet the rebate requirements."

569624,Guest,2007-10-23 19:06:00,0,The only thing the rebate did was keep lots of high paid clerks going and costing the taxpayer more. Glad they axed it and sent those clerks packing.
569417,englishbob,2007-10-09 06:03:00,2,"The GST rebate program is dead. The Canadian government killed it from April 1st, 2007. Check out: www.cra-arc.gc.ca/visitors for information regarding a 'replacement' program"
569420,2746,2007-10-09 11:31:00,3206,On our fall trip to LacSeul our camp owner gave us the rebate when we settled up and said he would turn it in. This was a new camp for us but we sure appreciated it and will be going back. Our refund request for our spring trip has never been received.
569421,Guest,2007-10-09 11:42:00,0,Well said D.B. Sounds like small fry 65 is one re-bait short of a catch....
569429,idapaul,2007-10-09 19:33:00,82,i'm still waiting on a refund for a 2004 trip that i sent in by mail. don't guess i'll ever see it.
569441,2746,2007-10-10 20:16:00,3206,Can someone tell me what the GST and PST taxes are and what % they each run? As I posted earlier our camp owner this fall said he would take care of the rebate for us and give us a deduct on our bill. Our bill before taxes was $2640.00 plus GST of $80.40 or 3.45% and PST of $169.00 or 6.4%. Total % tax of 9.445%. Can't tell if we really got a deduct or not.
569442,Guest,2007-10-10 20:55:00,0,gst is 6% and pst is 8% (5% on accomodations ie..cabin)
569455,onemorecast,2007-10-11 20:04:00,23,Got a letter from the Canadian Government that said I was ineligibe because we were there after April of 2007?? I would prefer they just tell me I am going to get screwed on the way in so I don't have to fill out the paperwork.
569457,Guest,2007-10-12 08:57:00,0,"Hey, your outfitter knew about the end of the old rebate, how the new one works (and doesn't work) and I think it was a major topic this spring on this board."
569458,Roadhog,2007-10-12 10:13:00,17,"I just hung up from the Canada Revenue Agency (902/432-5608). Don't plan on getting any refund on the GST this year. I don't think enough ""hoops"" are available in all of North America to file the right forms to get a refund. I was respectful in talking to the lady at the Department, but my comment to her was that I am really happy that I don't own a camp in NW Ontario because the government is really doing the campowners a disservice. I can't see how eliminating the GST rebate is going to increase money in the government coffers if less people come to Canada because of the increased expense. I know there are some people who say that money is no object when vacationing in Canada, but everyone has their breaking point. There is a term that applies to this whole scenario...""Death by a Thousand Little Cuts."""
569462,onemorecast,2007-10-12 17:30:00,23,"I don't care all that much, but my outfitter or the government is misleading me, either way how is that good for for business. I would pay, I just don't enjoy getting jerked around."
569392,Roadhog,2007-10-08 09:59:00,17,"I just received notice from the Canada Revenue Agency that our request for a rebate on the GST for our American Plan trip in July was denied. To quote the form ""Your application has been disallowed. A tour package must include eligible short-term accommodations and at least one service for an all-inclusive price. A service means anything other than property, money, and anything that is supplied to an employer by an employee in the course of employment. We are unable to determine what was included in your tour package."" We have never had a problem in the past, has anyone had any luck appealing this decision?"
569396,Bill Krejca,2007-10-08 10:59:00,6107,"After talking with several different folks at the Canadian office for about 15 minutes about the new rules, it was explained to me that unless the stay was part of a tour package, there will be no more refunds. As far as I know, at this time, no one has gotten any refund back for other than a ""tour"". There was an explanation that unless the stay was booked last year and payment made at that time, no refund will be forthcoming under the old rules. As the new rules have only been in effect this year, I understand some resort owners feel that further interpretations may allow a more liberal refund policy at some time. Time will tell."
569401,Guest,2007-10-08 15:14:00,0,"Bill: Thanks for the information, I guess. I went to a website on the GST Rebate and downloaded 28 pages of ""government speak"" on the subject and now I am more confused. One thing I do know is that if I was a campowner in NW Ontario I wouldn't be too happy with the whole situation. To me it's just another nail in the coffin."

569404,Guest,2007-10-08 16:49:00,0,WOW the canadian government must be awash in money now that the bucks are equal. no rebates and higher rates for customers. Just what the americans that have trying to decide to go or stay home need to help them decide the obvious.
569408,Pooch,2007-10-08 19:58:00,4619,Our forms were rejected also. I'm confused by it also. Pooch
569409,Guest,2007-10-08 20:03:00,0,"Yes, I did receive my rebate about 1 week ago. When i sent in my bill from the camp I also included the receipt from 2006 showing I had put a deposit down then. This was suggested by the camp owner."
569410,bpetersen,2007-10-08 20:25:00,251,"I sent my GST in for 2006 over a year ago and didn't receive anything. I e-mailed several different offices and was basically told the tax was not available for resorts anymore. Now I read it was good last year. Your right, more and more concerns keep coming up."
569415,bigfish1965,2007-10-08 22:48:00,3210,So now you get the same rebate I get when I travel to the U.S.
