570218,Guest,2007-12-18 09:49:00,0,"Gullrock....GGEEEEEEE's Took 502 up and 71 back last Aug. Both roads were what I considered good. There is a 20 mile section in the middle of 502 that is bumppy, but not real bad. There are no services, but just fill up before you get on it. The 71 route is at least 30 to 45 min longer and if there is traffic could get even longer. There is a short-cut that is easy once you get to the T intersection on the north end of 502 if you don't mind about 5 miles on gravel. It will cut another 30 min off the trip, by not going thru Dryden. At the intersection go right, rather than left to Dryden, go about 1 1/2 miles to Adams Rd. To make sure you are on Adams (if the street sign is missing) it goes downhill at the start through a cow pasture toward a ranch, that's about as easy a description as I can tell you. Adams rd. winds through for about 5 miles or so up to 17 and comes out at Oxdrift. Like I said, gravel, but will save you 30 min. and dealing with Dryden. I have taken this route for the last 6 years."

570235,Hump,2007-12-18 11:53:00,578,I think everyone should take 502 since it is shorter time wise and 502 is nearly all good.
570236,Guest,2007-12-18 15:07:00,0,Ditto on 502 and Adams road. The road through Soiux narrows is pretty and everyone should see it once but it is definately longer
570238,Guest,2007-12-18 19:10:00,0,Better turn left (go West) to make it to Oxdrift. Right goes to Dryden.
570241,Guest,2007-12-19 09:52:00,0,"That IS CORRECT. I just looked at my last post and I was wrong. At the T at the north end of 502 turn Left (west) to go to Adams Rd. turning right will take you into Dryden. Thanks for correcting me. Must be cabin fever setting in, to much snow, not enough sun, ice to thin, and wife to crabby."
570242,Guest,2007-12-19 11:57:00,0,Wasn't being picky. My black lab always liked to stop in the dip by the lake and grazing cows for a squirt before heading up or down the road. We really like that part of the drive. I've been taking that road up and back 6 or 8 times a year for about 25 years. Don't let the train sneak up on you at the crossing as you arrive at Oxdrift. They run quiet with those continuous rails.
570243,Guest,2007-12-19 16:04:00,0,"Not being picky, correcting my screw up, good catch!! We have seen deer standing on the road, coyotes, (or wolves) all sorts of intersting things on that small stretch. I finally feel ""in the bush"" when we hit that road. Can't wait until we leave next year!"
570245,2746,2007-12-19 20:24:00,3206,Taking 502 up and 71 back is the best advice if your interested in scenery. If not then 502 is faster. If your pulling a boat I'd stay clear of the Oxdrift shortcut. It will save time but the gravel is tough on a boat and trailer.
570199,LundDriver,2007-12-15 14:55:00,30,"We're planning a trip to Perrault Falls in Sept/Oct 2008. Pulling a 18' ProV. From Ft. Frances, what is the better/more scenic route? E to 502 or W to 71? Thanks Al W"
570200,Guest,2007-12-15 15:21:00,0,Hi. east to 502 would be shorter and if I remember correctly is more level. the last time we were on it there was not too many places if you need help. both are scenic though. I think the east route is about 50 miles shorter. if you are not in a hurry perrault falls is probably only about a 5 hour drive anyway from fort francis. If you have a choice cross the border before the weekend. we always crossed friday and stayed at La place rendevoux which was very nice.
570201,Oldschool,2007-12-15 15:25:00,163,"I prefer to take 71, although I do check closely before I go to see if either one is experiencing any delays from road work. The road on 71 is smoother with fewer sharp curves. The scenery is better mostly because there is opportunity to see it. 502 is fine, but the trees are so close to the road that most of the time that is all that you can see. It seems that 502 is a fairly decent road now, as far as roughness, but I think that the odds are that 71 will be much better on average. As I recall 71 is a bit farther, but the time is essentially the same due to 71's better roads."
570202,Guest,2007-12-15 19:46:00,0,"The time difference between Fort Francis and the turn off of Hwy 105 at Vermillion Bay is about 45 minutes longer on Hwy 71 vs Hwy 502. Hwy 502 is in very good shape when compared to a couple of years ago. We came back from Ear Falls on 502 last summer and there was no problem. There is about a 20 mile section that needs new pavement, but thats it. Hwy 71 is nice in that there are several small towns to go through and a lot more scenery than 502. Face it, 502 is 112 miles of brush from the border to Dryden."

I drive it many times during the summer. I can't imagine putzing it in 5 hours. For me 71 has a OPP station at Siuox Narrows, and a bunch of green recruits that are trying to make enough points to get a transfer to a decent post. 502 is smooth sailing with no interuptions. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

On the way up I take 502....slightly faster and it too is very scenic, especially around Rainy Lake....Stringbean is right there is NOTHING until Dryden, but forest, hills, rock cliffs and several small lakes and a occassional MOOSE! I find it very beautiful and peaceful....we always have lunch in Dryden and then head north of Perrault Falls......then on the way home, we take 17 W to 71 South Route, which is also very scenic and has several gift shops/tourist places along the way if you so wish to stop. It is very scenic on 17 W and 71 near Lake of the Woods. You do have to slow down for some small towns near Lake of the Woods. Some years I have seen a few vehicles pulled over by the OPP for speeding, so watch your speed on 71. 71 definately has more traffic. So, I look at it this way, with this circle route you get the best of both routes and makes it more interesting!!!! Rather-be-fishin (on Lac Seul)!! :driver:"
