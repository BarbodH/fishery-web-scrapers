We have 4 new people going with this year and they wonder if Lac Seul has Lake Trout and if so, where to fish them? :help: Appreciate any info! :thanks2: ""Rather-be-fishin"" on Lac Seul :cheers:"
570133,Guest,2007-12-12 21:40:00,0,There are lake trout in Lac Seul. I have tried for them without success. I don't believe the numbers are large but I could be wrong. Maybe NWO Fishing Bum will give some insight. Silver Water Wheel website had a picture of a very nice laker caught on Lac Seul a year or two ago. I don't know if that picture is still on there website.

July and August are pretty tough months to catch them even on lakes that do have a fishable population. I think if your guys want to try something different I'd try for smallies. If it were me I'd just keep catchin' walleye."
570173,dented boat guy,2007-12-13 19:36:00,24,I am a very serious walleye fisherman. I only fish for lakers when I get tired of catching eyes and that doesn't happen very often.
