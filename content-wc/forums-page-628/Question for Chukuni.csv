Had two walleyes around 26"" take a floating rap as it sat still on the surface. Two within about 10 minutes. Took it as I unhooked and released another walleye. Might you fish with your dog and sometimes your daughter in your boat. And do you know a guy by the name of Armstrong who is retired from Hydro?"
