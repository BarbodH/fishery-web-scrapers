570287,JDP,2007-12-24 12:06:00,1457,Looks like the passport requirement may be delayed until summer of '09....check out this articlehttp://wcco.com/local/passports.budg....2.615458.html JDP
570303,lenray,2007-12-26 16:47:00,467,Canada doesn't want the South folks--us me--to have to get a passport. Lodge owners and those in the tourist industry aren't in favor of it. The big push and only push for this is our own country. They want it so we can keep an eye on those coming in from the south so need to make it look fair --they want to put it on the northeeee also. It is NEVER we need one to get into Canada--It is we may need one to get back HOOMER. i WILL BE VERY SURPRISED IT IT EVER HAPPENS---PASSPORT. Thinking something smaller simpler cheaper if ever in my ole life timer.
