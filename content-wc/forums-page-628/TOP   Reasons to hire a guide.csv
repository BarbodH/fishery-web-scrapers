The nutshell version is that the fertile water from the south was allegedly having a detrimental impact on Whitefish Bay lake trout eggs, e.g., a thin layer of silt flowing from the south prevented some of the hatch. The potential problem was predicted and apparently confirmed, which lead to first the lock solution, which didn't work (no one closed the door) and later, the complete closing of the channel as it stands today."

570175,orchard frank,2007-12-13 21:22:00,1900,"If you are fortunate enough to find a lodge that you return to year after year, the staff, owners, and guides can become friends that you look forward to seeing each time. We spent enough time at Lac Seul to catch lots of fish, had 100+ fish days plenty of times, but the longer we went, the less important the numbers were. If a guide can enhance the experience for you, if you are relatively new to the area, or if you want to spend a day with someone you consider a good friend, a guide is the best expense you can have. We went to Lost Island Lodge in 1992, never went anyplace else after that, spent 2-3 weeks a year there for about 13 years. We're retired now, haven't been in a few years, travel budget mostly goes to Florida to see our son and daughter in law, but we consider the Hayes family and Basel and Vivian to be some of the finest people we've ever had the pleasure of knowing. A day in the boat with Basel will be at the top of my list whenever we get back up there. A Canadian trip can be so much more than catching fish."
570180,AllenW,2007-12-14 07:04:00,11482,"Not sure, but isn't drinking in a boat in Ontario illegal? Most of the few guys left that I go with don't do much drinking anymore, so it's never been a issue in the last few years, but seems to me its not allowed. Seems I'm not the only one who has had a problem with a guide and alcohol, I guess unfortunately its something one should consider when looking for a new guide...to bad. Like many other ventures with a person that does service for you, it pays to ask questions and get as many details worked out before you use them, just knowing the right questions might be a learning experience, asking on this forum is a good way to start. Al"
570181,Guest,2007-12-14 07:17:00,0,"Yes, drinking on the water is illegal. You are allowed to take beer with you for shore lunch. So, beer is allowed in the boat, just not to be consumed in the boat... Alcohol is probably the biggest knock on guides in Ontario."
570183,Guest,2007-12-14 08:43:00,0,"Obabikon, you would waive the guide fee?? now THAT is right neighborly of you. But seriously, I am not here to bash anyone or anything, and you are right about the old owner. He was the one that made up our decision to pack up and leave. We love our new resort and feel like we get spoiled and pampered there. And if I took you up on your offer I would have a mutiny with the group. Maybe this august we will stop in for coffee and meet you. This will be my last post because I have become very dissappointed in walleyecentral, especially the canada message board. It has turned into nothing but a tit for tat bash site and advertising board. This is why I dont hand out names and places, so nobody can slap them around just because silly old me wanted to sound like a know it all like most people on this board. Good day and maybe we will see you in August."

570186,lacseulwalleyeguide,2007-12-14 09:56:00,32,"Wow, I guess I never took into consideration the different types of guides, when I touched upon this subject. I agree with researching you guide well, if that is a way you wish to fish. Some guys like to do it all themselves, and all of the power to them. Personally, when going to a new lake.....I'm there to do nothing but catch fish, and if I can find some good help, I'll always take it. When looking for a new guide I would asked for letters of reccomendation from previous clients, I have tons, as would many lodges. The crew of guys I work with, have a minumum of ten years experience on the water, and we are buddies, exchanging information on a daily basis. On the other hand I know of places that could put you with a kid fresh out of college, with 1 months experience. Alcohol is a problem in this area as well. A good guide should realize that this is your vacation, and not theirs, and their partying can be had on days off, like any job. I usually have a drink with my clients after work, but don't drink hard until I have a clear day. Like every occupation, guides come in every shape and form, and only a handful excel in this area, those resorts usually make sure that they hang onto this type of staff member. I've been with the same guests every year for a long time, and I am only open to take a few new trips a year. At the moment I only have a few open weeks for 2008. My guests like the way they are treated, and the level of professionalism I put into every trip, so therefore remain faithful, and follow me wherever I guide. I give them the option of catching hundreds, or hunting for trophies, in every species. I no longer feel like these are clients, but good friends that I have made over the years. My reccomendation is that if you do take a guide that you want again, treat him well and he will do the same for you in return. Just a bit of research can lead you to someone, who will make memories on every lodge and lake. In this day and age, maybe posting a request for an experienced guide would lead you to the right person? I apologize to all who made have had a bad experience in this area, as I have seen and heard it myself. I do realize that a guide is not essential for all, as I've fished with experienced anglers who have taught me new tricks as well. Thanks for all of the great posts!"

I guarantee if you put a post on this board, ""LOOKING FOR A GOOD GUIDE ON ______ LAKE"" You'd get a bunch of replies. Then, you call the resort, and book THAT GUIDE. You'd better believe guides fill up just like resorts do. A lot of guests change resorts that they go to every summer, just so they can have the same guide (when he switches employers). So, making reservations early DOES DO IT, and if you get a name via research, then it's easy to request a guide without having been there before. If you're going to Lake of the Woods, (even if you're not coming to my camp) feel free to call/email me with guide requests. I set up at least three guides with ""outside"" work from phone calls and emails. Obviously, my customers get first crack at the guides, but if I'm not working them, I want them to have jobs..."

What's furnished and what's needed to bring. I'm betting there's a few more too. Thanks for the offer Obabikon, but we only go to Red Lake Ont, and after appox 25 years we don't need a guide.

If you go to a resort, and they're willing to send you out with a drunk guide, find a new resort. If one of my guides were to show up drunk to ""work"" they would be unemployed. NOBODY, I don't care what your job is, gets to show up intoxicated for work. If this had happened to you at most resorts, a lot of appologizing would be needed, and the owner himself had better take you out for free for the day!!!"
570161,Mohleye,2007-12-13 16:17:00,368,"I think this is a good topic. I definitely feel there are situations where hiring a guide makes lots of sense. A week of bad weather and bugs can still be a good trip if you're catching fish; and even if everything else is perfect, the entire trip will be remembered as a bust if you can't find and catch fish. I was at a resort once where the fish were pretty plentiful and easy to catch. A group of guys came in mid-week for a four day trip, all inexperienced. We saw them in passing on the lake, and the last night in camp they stopped over. They were really disappointed because they'd caught virtually nothing. The camp owner's son was available to guide, and if they'd have hired him even for a 1/2 day, their trip would have been totally different. Heck, even if they'd have stopped by our cabin for a beer we would have helped them out with a few ideas.I was also at a fly-in camp once where an elderly couple hired a guide for the entire week. They didn't feel safe by themselves, and liked having someone bait their hooks and net their fish and cook shore lunch. They used the same guide every year, and were happy as could be. I'm not sure I buy into the idea that a group of experienced fishermen need to hire a guide out of fear of navigational hazards, or to find the hot spots and patterns. I guess I feel those are things you should discuss with your campowner. I'd expect to sit down for a few minutes with a map lake, where we'd note the hazards, and at a minimum be pointed in the general direction of some likely spots. I think it all depends on your comfort level. You're there to catch fish, and if spending a day or two with a guide is what it takes, then I'd highly recommend it."
570162,Guest,2007-12-13 16:44:00,0,"Hey Obabikon, does showing up at the boat so hungover you are throwing up out the back of it count as well. 3 years ago one of your guides did this with us.... we fished 1 day and left because we were booked with him for 3 more days. Went to a mainland morson resort, got an excellent guide and take him every august for our 4 days on Lake of the woods, turned into a blessing. I know he still works for you cuz I saw him in one of your boats last summer. Dont wanna blackball him but just so you know his initials are B. L."
570165,Guest,2007-12-13 17:05:00,0,"He hasn't, and won't be doing that for me. Steve Huffman ran a differrent type of resort. My guides are no longer allowed to drink on the job, unless they are invited to have a beer or two with the guests AFTER WORK."
570166,Guest,2007-12-13 17:34:00,0,"Also, Indiana, I'd encourage you to come back, and I'll personally take you and your group out and wave the guide charge! I do apologize for his actions, and hope it didn't ruin your vacation completely. Some groups love to have a guide who is also a ""drinking budy"". But, my view on that is if you want a drinking budy, invite him to the cabin after dinner. To have a drunken guide operating a boat, with several guests in it, is a liability to say the least. That doesn't even mention the other problems."
570111,lacseulwalleyeguide,2007-12-11 20:01:00,32,"Here are the top 10 benefits of taking a (good)guide; 1. No time is wasted on finding the fish 2. You get to spend your time fishing instead of running the boat 3. Someone else can take care of the kids(or rookies) 4. You don't have to cook lunch or fillet fish 5. The netting, baiting, tying is done for you 6. The chances of wrecking the boat are gone 7. You will always be in the right spot to hide from any weather 8. The correct presentation is already known for each day or/and spot 9. They are responsible for knowing the regulations and keeping track of the limits 10. You simply can just relax any others?"
570112,Guest,2007-12-11 22:08:00,0,"How about stories and conversation. I've got guests that come up and request a guide every year, even if they don't catch fish. They just want to hear his wild stories and enjoy the conversation."

570119,Guest,2007-12-12 13:48:00,0,"I agree with phishfearme.. the few guides that I have used were very nice guys and pleasant boat companions,but mediocre boatsmen and fishermen. They were also quite surprised in future dates to see our boat in some excellent places catching fish. One even had the balls to ask how we found some of those spots,that only he knew about but of course hadn't shared with us. There is a need for guides but it's not for everyone"
570123,Guest,2007-12-12 16:54:00,0,"Hi. Right on. in 30 years of going to canada never hired a guide. we caught plenty of fish and had lots of fun too. discovery is part of the adventure. the guy was right, if someone else does everything for you, you might as well stay home and watch people on tv catch fish."
570124,Guest,2007-12-12 17:24:00,0,"Now that Lindner and Gary Roach have spoken, let me tell you how I feel. I used to be able to fish 5 or 6 full weeks a year and also a lot of weekends. With kids and all sorts of work and family committments, I get a week in Canada, and a long weekend in Wisconsin with the guys each year, and me and my family go to Wisconsin and stay at a cabin for a week. I am not on the water that much, and when I am not on the water, I am thinking about when I can get on the water. I also do not like going to the same place every year. I like new places. I always get a guide for the first 2 days of a trip in Canada. The water is too big and way too many rocks. I like to have a guide show me the clear roads so I am not taking out a prop or three. I also am not on the lake that much and want to right away start catching. I have watched fishing on tv, and catching one myself is a lot different than seeing Lindner do it. It might be cheating you ""pro anglers"" eyes, but when my days are cut down, a guide puts me on the pattern right away. I have also learned some good techniques on shore lunch from guides. I now make the best potatoes ever. Now if I can get Patty from Evergreen's baked bean recipe, I would be a very happy man."
570127,Guest,2007-12-12 19:27:00,0,"I agree with Dave B, on new waters I want a guide for the first day or two, I want to get the lay of the land or water, just too hard on props and I also want to get a quick understanding of the fishery. After a day or two I would then perfer to go on my own. Dave B what is your potatoe secret, my first love is walleye fishing my second is eating !! thanks BT"
570130,Guest,2007-12-12 20:23:00,0,"After the potatoes have been frying in oil and are done, take them out and let them sit a moment in paper towels so the towels soak up the excess oil. Pour the oil out of the pan but keep the pan hot. Throw in raw onions now in hot pan. There will be enought residual oil in the pan so the onions do not stick. After few minutes or so, throw the potatoes back in and crisp them a little while while the onions are cooking up. Season and chow down. This crisps them a lot more then just deep-frying in oil. THe onions also do not cook down to nothing like they do if you deep fry them with the potatoes."
570132,rather-be-fishin,2007-12-12 21:38:00,429,"I have been to Lac Seul for 4 years now and have hired a guide for 1 day the first day or two. I have fished the NW area 2 years and the mid-west and central area 2 years. Each time the guide was the owner of the resort. They showed our group different areas to fish each time and the safest ways to travel. Techniques didn't vary much, but I always still learned something new. I am going again for the 5th year and will have 4 new people joining our group. I plan to hire a guide again and have the guide go with them since they have never fished Lac Seul. I will tag along and still learn new ""hot spots"" to go. Then I have the rest of the week to venture and explore on my own. It's a big plus to learn the safest and quickest ways to travel....plus the conversation and stories they share are always entertaining......I still take my own fish off and bait my own hook and tie my own tackle....so they are not doing it all for me....I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING A GUIDE IF YOUR GOING TO LAC SEUL FOR THE FIRST TIME OR GOING TO A NEW AREA ON THE LAKE!!! You will catch more fish, won't wreck your boat or motor or get lost!!! :blahblah: 7 months and counting!!! :driver: ""Rather-be-fishin"" than workin!! :raisin:"
