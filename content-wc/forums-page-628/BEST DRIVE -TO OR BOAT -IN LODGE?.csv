570101,Guest,2007-12-11 13:27:00,0,"Hi, We go on Lac Suel every year but we get a houseboat for a week. Not the cheapest but split 6 ways not bad. You bring your own food, booze, beer. about the only extras are gas, bait & ice. If I remember right it is about 800 each. for everything including our food and gas up from Wis."

570252,Guest,2007-12-20 09:21:00,0,If you go to Devils Lake wash your boat every day. If you don't you will have some kind of mong or fungus on it that is almost impossible to remove on an aluminun boat. Don't know about a glass boat. It even gets on metal trim including stainless steel. Good Luck

We would have gone every year if I hadn't gotten laidoff in 02, but we finally made it back last year. I'm heading back up this year with my dad for his birthday present. I have not been to a better resort up there. The lodging is 1st class, the food tremendous, equipment is great and the fishing .....well it's pretty good too! Fished ski's seriously last year and we had several 40+ fish and the largest was 47.5"" Also eyes last year to 8#. Smallie fishing can be great and we went to Shoal Lake one day for big pike. Great trip! Check out this site. Good luck with your choice.http://www.totemresorts.com/"

569948,lenray,2007-12-07 15:37:00,467,CRS Good to hear from you. The key to what I do is that I have a select few younger friends who go with me. These guys are 30's-40's and see the dream I have for exploring new lakes. I will be 63 in Jan. Currently going 1200 miles one way from Mich. Up a river about 18 miles then portage canoes over to other portage lakes and camp there. Looking at 300 miles plus north of IGNACE AT THIS TIME. Have never seen others on these secluded lakes--NEVER. we JUST HAVE A GREAT desire to fish new water. There is a decent size lake about 1/2 mile plus from the portage lake we fished last year. Going to go there this spring and give it a try. That dream keeps an ole guy going thru a long cold winter looking forward to his spring time adventure. Went into a portage lake this past spring and at the end of the lake there was a place that had been damed up by beaver--a HUGE lodge was there standing on dry ground. High water cut a 10-15 foot path thru the dam and let out all of the water. It was kind of erie looking at it --like a ghost town. I was very surprised at the size of the lodge. My buddy wanted to go over to it and crawl up into it--from where the beaver went into it as it would have been under water before the opening of the dam. I also love to drive and see the scenery--never tire of seeing the landscape and the moose and bear. Most folks just want to go from A-TO--B and don't appreciate the long drive. Smell all of the roses as my mother would say. That country really has a draw for me at this time. My friend does the cooking and the eyes he fries up are so beautiful and golden you sometimes just hate for a few seconds to cut one apart. He also takes a turkey fryer and puts the eyes in there along with onions potatoes carrots etc.--makes a very hardy meal. This young 40 something has gone to lakes up there and has worked for as long as 3 days with a chain saw making a small path into a lake. That has become tooo much work for this ole fisherman. Still it does take more work than driving to a lodge or a flyout--going where we do. At his time we are going with two 14's pulling two canoes if three guys go. Have small motors for the canoes 1.2 HP Tanaka and a 2.5 and a 3 hp also with 15HP to get up the main rivers. Nothing like looking out at night into a pure Heaven and see the stars. I live in the country down here in Clare but we have plenty of light pollution from the yard lights. If ya want more info. just give me a shout [email protected]

It is VERY secluded and you can get into any lake you have the ???? to get into. We tent under the stars and never see other fishermen. If you are on a budget you can go a long ways on trips like we do. I am not on a budget but fish like I am--and just plain love it. Our good Canadian neighbors fish like this. Not all of course but many. I don't cook so take a guy who does. I don't have a big tent so take a guy who does.
