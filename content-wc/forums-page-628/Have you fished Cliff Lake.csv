570164,Fishful Thinker,2007-12-13 16:59:00,100,"Rose, I am from Dryden and have fished Cliff Lake numerous times, winter and summer. Great place wish you all the luck."
570167,Guest,2007-12-13 18:19:00,0,Cliff lake is close to the dead sea of Perrault lake. Have bben going to up there for about 30 years now(canada that is) Cliff lake is not that great of a walleye lake at all.
570170,Rose_Cliff Lake,2007-12-13 19:00:00,116,Fishful Thinker Do you have any spots you can tell me about and thank you for the good luck. Rose
570171,Rose_Cliff Lake,2007-12-13 19:05:00,116,"What If I understand correctly, Cliff feeds Cedar Lake and then Perrault Lake.{We're not at the end of the line} Can you tell me about your experience there? Where did you fish and where did you stay if you dont mind me asking? Thank you, Rose"
570182,bob oh,2007-12-14 08:33:00,3936,"Fishful, are you familiar with Rugby and Lorne Lakes? Fished them many, many years ago and just wondered what they are like now? Also fished Wabigoon, Thunder and a few others I can't remember now (old age) and have some great memories. Thanks, rod bender bob"
570190,Trailerguy,2007-12-14 10:52:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Cliff Lake is part of the Cedar River Chain, Twilight,Evening,Mystery which are upstream, are good walleye lakes, as is Cedar which is downstream. Features of the lake and pressure are the major factors that determine how good the walleye fishing is. Cliff is primarily deep water, therefore Lake Trout is the most commonly fish caught on it. Your assertion that Perrault is a dead sea, is quiet interesting, because the lake suports five resorts and a group of cottages. While the fish don't jump into your boat, it seems that if it was a dead sea, cottages should be dirt cheap, and the resorts would be broke. I'll have to see wether one of my friends who has lived in the area for 35 years and just bought a cottage on Perrault last fall for 225k thinks about your theory. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

570211,Guest,2007-12-17 08:15:00,0,"stayed at manatok lodge with old reg a few years back. Fishing was brutal--the worst lake i have ever been too in 20 years or so of going up there. If your friend but a 225,000 lodge on the lake I do not blame him but I think there is alot better fishin in other places."

[it took me 1/2 hr to get to registering.] Sorry if I've offended anyone, never meant to and Rod I'm glad you pointed it out b4 I get into trouble. I just so DARN excited...Rose"
570105,Guest,2007-12-11 17:52:00,0,"rose, just fyi, i love the info on this board,and i don't want you as a new resort owner to get a bad rap.you can talk up your lake as much as you want..nothing wrong with great enthusiasm as a resort owner.we all ask questions about certain lakes,and resort specific as well..there are some great posts from some great resort owners..pick your spots.you can use this forum to promote your camp, but tone it down just a touch. i guess from your moniker, we'll know you are from cliff lake..i wish it was june..grrrr!!! not a swipe at you at all.. pat at evergreen lodge on lac seul posts he4r all the time. ive stayed at her camp, and all that visit this board know of her as well.again,good luck..rod ouuuuut!!!"
570121,Juls,2007-12-12 14:36:00,13414,"Don't worry Rose...we were keepin an ""eye"" on you.:) Your original post wasn't advertising. Advertising would be if you were telling people to go visit your site or stay at your camp when no one asked you for that information. You genuinely (and we could tell that it was genuine) only wanted people to share stories of your new place. Best wishes in your new adventure as a resort owner. May you be successful! Thanks Rod, for the help....always appreciated Sir! ;) Juls"
570122,Guest,2007-12-12 16:07:00,0,"Rose, As a fellow resort owner, they don't seem to have problems, as long as you keep direct advertising away. Some people are annoyed, but the vast majority appreciate information about the different areas. I posted a fishing report all of last summer, and plan to do so again next summer. Most love it, some are ""offended"" by it for some reason, but the site is ok with that type of posts. I'd encourage you to start one in the spring too."
570128,Rose_Cliff Lake,2007-12-12 19:55:00,116,"Juls, I'm the little fish in the big sea. You're right, being new is hard and having some history from others is what I was after. Thanks, Rose"
570129,Rose_Cliff Lake,2007-12-12 20:00:00,116,"Obabikon, Thank you for the insight and suggestion. Was your first year so full of anticipation? Have you been in business long? Sorry if that may be obvious to some but I'm the new fish on the pond. Rose"
570137,Guest,2007-12-13 06:59:00,0,"My father ran the resort until I was 16, I grew up on our island. He sold it ten years ago, and by a tragic turn of events, my wife and I were put in the situation to take it back over. I had a job as a Sales Rep for Pepsi, and had to give a weeks notice in mid May to go up and run it. It really came out of nowhere, so there was no anticipation. Just hurry and get up there to run the resort. Are you doing sportshows? If so, which ones? We should meet for coffee... I'll be in Chicago (3times), Minnesota (3times), Omaha, St.Louis, and Milwaukee (sp?)."

569969,Rose_Cliff Lake,2007-12-09 13:15:00,116,We just bought Lost Bay Resort on Cliff Lake and I'm wondering if any of you have stories to share. Please let me know...Rose

570063,Trailerguy,2007-12-09 14:14:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Yes, I stayed there one time only, the former owners (Canadians)alienated me and many others with their attitudes. Lost Bay is also located on a hillside, you couldn't even park on the level beside the cabin. The owners and help constantly ran up and down the hillside on ATV's, they didn't walk anywhere. You don't pay $$ to listen to them screaming by day and night at a fishing camp. Beyond that, Cliff Lake has some nice trout, virtually no Pike, Muskys, small mouth, and a few walleye. With the walleye it seemed like the were nice sized on Cliff when you could find them. If you treat your guests right, and utilize some of the outlying lakes for walleye fishing, you should be sucessfull. Lost Bay had a boat cache on Shultz, which has walleye and trout, and day tripped over to Lulu for walleyes at that time. In recent years they didn't have enough business to bother with those. I sincerly hope you will be more in tune to your guests needs and you will ultimatly be sucessful. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
570065,Rose_Cliff Lake,2007-12-09 15:38:00,116,"Thank you for responding. How long ago were you there? I'm asking because there is parking now with the exception of one cabin and we are going to address that. As for the previous owners, I've heard that before and we are VERY different from them. And we both need exercise so we will be walking except on change over day when we need to carry supplies and move fast and we have a quiet golf cart for garbage pick-up. In 2008 we will be demolishing that huge garage, adding 1 cabin, putting up an all purpose building that will house the fish cleaning, bait, general store, gathering place for guests, and motor storage all under one roof and right by the water. [It will be located where the bait shack and gas tanks were.] The tanks have already been moved and a new septic system will be complete before the spring opener. We are so excited!!! When the big building is complete, then we'll tear down the bait shack and the fish cleaning house. We are also doing repairs to the other 9 cabins where appropriate. In 2009 we are putting up 2 more new cabins, taking one down and adding a new garage at the top of the hill to replace the one with the horns all over it. We will have a boat and motor on Pickeral Lake [portage], Schulz Lake [we'll take you in], Three Sided Lake[portage], Beaton Lake[portage] and April Lake[drive to]. Then there is also Mystery, Twilight, and Evening Lakes which you can get to by the river system. Now I havent heard of LuLu Lake, where is it and how did you get to it?"
570067,Trailerguy,2007-12-09 17:56:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]We stayed at Lost Bay shortly prior to purchasing our cottage on Wabaskang in 2000. I believe the large building on the west end was a sea plane hanger at one time. We stayed in a cabin about half way between the lodge and the lakeshore as I recall. Evening Lake produced well for us last June, and is a nice trip as well. Lots of other nice lakes in the area too. Lulu is east on April Road, a couple of miles as I recall,acessed at a very large culvert. A boat trailer normally launches into the creek on the south side and you easily motor up into the lake. There is a rocky point over on the SE side that produces well in a favorable wind. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
570074,Guest,2007-12-10 10:43:00,0,"Hello Rose Congratulations on your new acquisiton, we ice fish Cliff Lake & have caught plenty of lake trout over the years, no I am not going to give up my fishing hole ""Hot spot"". Would like to know if you plan on opening up for winter ice fishing. If building new cabins maybe winterize them. Would be nice to have a place to get off the hwy & park our vehicles, don't mind paying a parking fee. Would also be nice to get a coffee & sandwich. My lunch is usually frozen."
570078,Rose_Cliff Lake,2007-12-10 14:11:00,116,"Chukuni, We are not sure at this time. For example, this year we are doing 8 of 9 All Canada Shows from Jan 4th through Feb 10th. Due to illness the previous owners did'nt promote the camp for over 3 years and we have our work cut out for us. So I forsee this routine going on for a few years. What time of year do you ice fish? Also, we will have a new septic system in 2008. The previous system did'nt allow for even the main house to make it through the winter much less any cabins. So having the new system might mean new possibilities. Your right, when building new cabins we should winterize them. We will know so much more this time next year since we'll have some time under our belts. Are you parking on the road and then going in on Snowmobiles? For this winter if you just need to park...e-mail me at [email protected] we could work something out [no charge but you have to tell me about just 1 hot spot...ha ha]"
570085,bpetersen,2007-12-10 19:57:00,251,"I fished out of your resort 2 different times in the late 80's and 3 times in the early 90's out of another resort south close to the highway. It was called Staples back them but has been sold. Your place was owned by Dick Larson and was not a very good business minded person. Actually he made the stay quite unpleasant. I only gave him a second chance because I thought he was just having a bad week the first time. Anyway we had descent walleye fishing but challeging in your lake. We had great musky contacts and above average smallies. I realize it has been awhile but our best walleye fishing and smallmouth was to the north of your bay enterance. There are to islands to the northside. Most of the walleye came from the bigger island and a bay due east of the bigger island. Smallies on the northern most shore. Musky contacts all of the time around the big island and the bay to the east of there. This is before GPS's so I have no GPS reading for you. It sure wouldn't bother me to share areas. People on the forum have helped me. We did fish another lake east of Woganstal's resort, east of Cedar Lake, about 12 miles away called Ord Lake. The road was one lane most of the way but a bridge went out and the only way we could get there after that was on a logging road just south of there. I don't know if you are familiar with Ord but there were a couple of resort boats stored over there by Staples. We hauled our on boats in. The road was just horrible but that keep many people form going there. The walleye and northern fishing was fantastic. This lake was the main reason we went back. Mark Staples told us that Ord was his bread and butter for his resort to stay open. There were no resorts on Ord. There was one private cabin and an old resort that was closed. I heard that some people went up north of Perault and drove down an old railroad bed and put in on Thadeaus Lake and pushed their boats through a big culvert under the railroad bed. Like I said, it has been a few years since fishing those lakes. If you want any more information on Ord my email is:[email protected] Good luck to you, Pete"
