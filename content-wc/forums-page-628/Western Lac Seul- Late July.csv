569950,Guest,2007-12-08 07:22:00,0,I normally fish the last week of June. this year we have switched to the last of July so my son can go. I fish out of Evergreen. I realize last year was different. My question- where will I find fish on this section. I don't want to go as far as McKensize bay. any help would be appreciated.

570125,Guest,2007-12-12 17:42:00,0,you can limit out under the train bridge..took the evergreen hottie for an evening fish.tied to the bridge and threw small jig and minnow in the current..had a blast until the lightning came..jiggy

Also, try entrance to Steamboat narrows jigging with a minnow, and far west shore line of Steamboat bay down by the point east of Farewell bay trolling the points of the shoreline with spinners. If you find a ""hot spot"" the anchor and jig especially by the far point where it drops off fast....:)"
