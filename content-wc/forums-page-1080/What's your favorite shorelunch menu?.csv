507339,Guest,2000-03-23 11:11:00,0,the best batter i have ever had is called simply shore lunch it comes in a black box try it you can't beat it.
507324,Guest,2000-03-09 12:33:00,0,I've always found pinecones and a handful of sand do an excellent job of cleaning dishes.
507333,Tim,2000-03-09 13:57:00,179,The best fish breading I've found is also the simplest: Put a box of corn flakes through the blender and add salt and pepper.
507329,Pops,2000-03-09 14:25:00,61,"As for beer in the boat; spring of 98 my buddies and I where stopped by the MNR on LOTW and told that the law covering open container and drunk driving in boats and cars is the same in Ont.We had a bottle of schnops in the boat in plain sight. OOOPPPPPSSSSS.They, the officers, said they do not say too much about 2-3 beers each for shore lunch but that is about all they overlook. The only thing that saved us was that the seal was not broken.As for shore lunch, fresh fish, fried taters, beans and Red River Bread from Buena Vista Resort.If you do not have a problem with coleteral(sp) fri everything in REAL butter. :-)I have to see if I have any fish left in the freezer. :-)Keep your rod bent!!Pops"
507334,Guest,2000-03-09 15:10:00,0,"Here's a walleye recipe for day number four when you might be getting tired of the fried fish. Boil some potatoes the night before Catch several 2 pounders. Great big bottle of catsuponionsgreen pepperssalt and pepperalum. foilBuild a fire and let it burn down to good cooking coals. Bring a fire grate or grille alongOn a ample sized piece of doubled up foil take potatoes and chop them up into 3/4 inch cubes and lay them out on the foil about 2 inches thick. Take two big walleye fillets and lay them on the potatos. Chop up a liberal amount of onions and green pepper and place on top of the fish. Then take the catsup and cover everything using more than you think you need. Seal the foil and place on the grille. Eveything will cook in about 15 mins. Watch out that the flame doesn't touch the foil while cooking. Sounds kind of ucky, but this is an excellent dish. We've also use frech dressing, salsa, and mayo in place of the catsup. You can also add just about any kind of veggie. TGG"
507335,Guest,2000-03-09 21:16:00,0,"We deep fry walleyes with a variety of mixes. But the one thing we do different than most is to cut the pieces into bite size pieces. Finger food! Also, the hotter the oil, the better. I believe we don't put the fish in until we hit 400. It seals everything in.My mouth is watering reading all the good suggestions."
507336,Mal,2000-03-10 11:11:00,55,"Had this for the past 8 to 10 years on our fly-in fishing trip. There were 8 of us last year so we borrowed one of those skillets with a 3 foot handle and cooked for all of us in that skillet. The lodge supplies us the fixens per two people (one large onion, three large potatoes, 1/2 loaf of bread, 2 cans of baked beans, one large container of lard, one large container of butter, and cookies. More than enough for two starving fisherman. We have four of these for 8 people. Put a generous amount of lard in the skillet and bring it to 350 to 375 and put the onions in. Slice the potatoes and put them in with a generous amount of ""Montreal Steak"" seasoning. When potatoes are done, now is the time to have the walleye ready. Before putting the walleye in the skillet, we clean it and rinse real good, put the filets in a baggie that has flour and cajun seasoning. Add a little more lard to skillet, bring temperature back up and add the filets. Just thinking about it, I think my cholesterol jumped about 20 points."

507331,Guest,2000-03-14 10:46:00,0,"I found it, Andy's Seasoning Inc, St. Louis, MO They're going to have a website up and running pretty soon. Just called them today an ordered a 5 pound bag. This is perfect for shorelunch, no mix, no mess. Did I mention it tastest really good?"
507337,Guest,2000-03-15 13:54:00,0,"Here's a little different twist for a shore lunch that gets you away from fried stuff and something you can prepare at the cabin before heading out.Take a good size sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil and spray it with no-stick then add sliced potatoes, onions, carrots, green peppers and sliced mushrooms. Add some pats of margarine on top and some lowry seasoning salt, garlic powder and pepper. Crimp the ends and top of the foil and place in a cooler.For the fish bring along a sheet of aluminum foil, seasoning , onions and peppers sliced in a zip-lock bag, no-stick and a stick of margarine. When you are ready for lunch, fillet your fish as normal and place the fillets on the aluminum foil with the onions peppers and pats on margarine on top. Season and add some lemon juice.The potatoes cook in about 25-30 minutes and the fish take about 15 minutes so start the potatoes first. You can bring along a can of beans as well. A grate over an open fire works best. Use plastic utensils and paper plates and everything will burn up when you're done. Give it a try this way and you might change the way you have shore lunch as it takes less time to prepare and leaves more time for fishing. Leave the fried fish supper for back at the cabin when you have more time for a toddy and food prep. Just one idea."
507338,Guest,2000-03-19 10:52:00,0,"Hi Guys. Now we're talkin' my language. Shore lunch is one of the best parts of the day. Didn't see anything about wild rice in any of the posts, so thought I'd mention it. Cook that up with some mushrooms and onion and whatever else sounds good, along with the other options, fried potatoes, beans, etc.... Never met a shore lunch I didn't like. And indoor shore lunch sounds pretty good for tonight, now that I'm thinking about it. Good eating, John."
507319,Guest,2000-03-08 12:21:00,0,":9 This beautiful weather has put Canada on my brain! In the process of making out a grocery shopping list for our trip, I thought I'd get some other favorites, and hopefully liven up this board a little. What is your favorite shorelunch menu and how do you cook it? (Okay, I know it includes walleye, but what else?) Post your favorite shorelunch menu below."
507320,stewart,2000-03-08 14:43:00,100,"Walleye cheeks as apetizers(marinated in hot sauce, fried up with a drop of oil).Walleye that's fried, baked(assorted stuff and salad dressing), or in some sort of gumbo,and french fries form the main course. Baked beans too.Pretty traditional, but good :-). When the fries are almost done put some onions in. Delicious!Usually a fire square is made with rocks, and two logs set parrallel make secure rests for the pans. Baked fish is done with aluminum foil and a couple clamp things to hold them over the fire. Don't know why people often don't take more time for a good shore lunch. To me it's one of the most important parts of thre day.Looking forward to reading any other ideas and outdoor cooking tips."
507323,River_eye,2000-03-08 15:39:00,1486,"Here's a way that's delicious, but also extremely easy. All you need is a pan, oil, instant mashed potatoe buds, condensed milk(eg. carnation) and flour (and of course the fish). Coat the fish in flour, then dip them in the milk, then in the potatoe buds. I like to put enough oil in the pan so the fish are deep fried, but just a little coating the bottom will do. Make sure the oil is hot enough, when you throw the fish in, it should start bubbling. Usually we do potatoes in the oil before the fish. Leave them in till they're golden brown, and that's it. You may want to throw some spices or salt/pepper on them before they get rolled in the potatoe buds. [font size=""4"" color=""green"" font face=""signature""]River eye[/font]"

507321,stewart,2000-03-08 16:19:00,100,"Couldn't edit last message, but here are a few basic tips I know.-When frying, lay the fillet skin side down so it doesn't curl.-Canola oil isn't just good for cooking with, it is great for helping the fire out.If more heat is needed under a pan use the spatula to toss a bit of oil under it(especially under those slow potatoes).-If it rains it's good to have something to cover the cooking pans, such as an extra pan.-moss is an excellent pan cleaner."
507326,Guest,2000-03-08 17:39:00,0,"This has been a favorite for years and it's really easy: Dip your walleye fillets in egg or any of the egg substitutes until coated completely. Then roll the fillets in finely ground cracker crumbs. We use the salted variety which eliminates the neccessity to season, later on. You might be tempted to substitute the cracker crumbs with bread crumbs but crackers are less apt to burn. Place the fillets in a pan of hot shortening (Crisco), and when the fillets are golden, your fish is cooked. Dab on a little tartar sauce, ketchup or lemon juice, and you're in business! Fried 'taters, of course, are a staple but don't forget to wash it all down with ice cold Canadian ale and a healthy cigar."
507327,mkebenn,2000-03-09 06:58:00,59,"Stop it, I'm droolin' all over my keyboard. One suggestion, I preboil my potatos at home before trip, saves ALOT of time at lunch. Tight lines, Mike"
507328,Guest,2000-03-09 07:52:00,0,"I have a commercial fish batter I use (or WILL use if I can find it again!) as for the taters, I bake a few the night before, then dice them and throw them into a couple large zip-locs with some diced onions, olive oil and a little thyme. (By baking them first they fry quicker and get brown quicker!) I also mix up a couple cans of beans with my own ingredients and toss everything into the cooler when we leave in the morning. As I'm frying the taters I sprinkle some Lawry's season salt to give them a little zing. The Batter mix I use is called ""Andy's Batter."" If anyone knows where I can get more I'd like to hear about it. All you do is put some in a zip loc with about three or four filets, close the bag and shake it up. Best batter I've ever tasted but can't find it now.I agree on the Canadian lager & a cigar! However we've always been told not to have ANY alcohol in the boat, is that true or is it ""no open alcohol containers?"" Last trip we took there was a fire ban so we used a Coleman stove. We'll do that again this year because it's a lot easier than a fire.That reminds me, I think I have some walleye in the freezer at home! I'm gonna call my wife and tell her it's indoor-shorelunch tonight! :D"
507332,KnottyBuoy,2000-03-09 12:02:00,110,I have tried all the recipes listed and more.....they are all excellent.....I found a packaged mix in Minneapolis called David Howards Fish Breading......it is corm meal based and has a bit of onion and garlic taste to it.....really is a nice change from the normal flour based mixes.......
507322,Guest,2000-03-09 12:33:00,0,I've always found pinecones and a handful of sand do an excellent job of cleaning dishes.
