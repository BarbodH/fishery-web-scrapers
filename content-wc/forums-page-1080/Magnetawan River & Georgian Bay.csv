507123,Guest,2000-03-19 16:35:00,0,"I have been fishing the Magnetewan River and Georgian Bay out of that area for 26 years. I have never stayed at Bying inlet, I rent a cabin about 1 mile down river from there. I am there all summer, well from June 6th or 7th until August 17th. The fishing in the river for pike is slow, you have to go out on the bay for the better pike fishing. The walleyes in the river get big, my biggest is 14lb, 35 3/4 inches, but over the years the number of big walleyes has gone down considerably. It used to be that I could catch 2-3 walleyes a day, each being over 8lbs, but those days are few now. There are still a good many walleyes in the river though and they are easiest to catch real early in the morning or after 8:30 pm. My largest Northern last summer there was about 21 lb. but most of the pike range 4-8lb. The best day I had last summer for pike, I caught 17 between 4 and 14 lb. There are monster muskies in that river, so you have a variety of fish to go for. Hope this helps and feel free to contact me if you decide to go ther."
