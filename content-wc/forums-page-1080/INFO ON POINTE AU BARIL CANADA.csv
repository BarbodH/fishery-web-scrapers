507401,RANGER,2000-03-16 12:55:00,4341,"THIS COMING JUNE MY FRIENDS AND I ARE GOING TO FISH THE POINTE AU BARIL AREA AND ADJACENT WATERS. I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY AND ALL ""INSIDE INFO"" ON HOW TO FISH THIS AREA FOR 'EYES. WE HAVE FISHED CANADIAN WATERS FOR MANY YEARS BUT THIS IS OUR FIRST CRACK AT FISH'IN THE ""BAY"". MY BOAT IS ""GREAT LAKES"" RIGGED ie: 18'+, MAIN MOTOR, KICKER, ELECTRIC TROLL, DOWNRIGGERS, PLANNERS etc."
507402,Tyee,2000-03-18 17:40:00,60,"I've fished this area several times, andit's great for SM Bass & some northerns. It'sgood for walleye in the early spring and fall.If we have another early spring, the walleyemay have all pulled out into the bay by thetime you head up. Lot's of islands, reefs, etcand ALOT of unmarked shoals !! If you're lookingfor walleyes, you might want to hire a guidefor your first day. If not, I hear you canget into some walleyes out in the bay, or atnight time...but if you don't have a good GPS,I wouldn't want to go out on that water atnight.Last summer the Georgian Bay area was down3-4 feet (as was alot of other lakes), andfolks were hitting shoals that were never aproblem before...so be careful and have fun."
507403,RANGER,2000-03-20 06:06:00,4341,"THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION AND THE WARNING REGARDING THE SHOALS AND THE BAY. WE HAVE FISHED THE FRENCH RIVER AREA, THE MUSKOKA WATERS AND THE TRENT-SEVERN. WE WERE HOPING TO IMPROVE OUR SUCCESS RATE FOR 'EYES BY MOVING OUT TO THE BAY. BUT, FROM WHAT YOU HAVE SAID, WE MIGHT HAVE TO TRUCK OUT TO THE ""BIG WATER"" ANYWAY. I HAVE A VERY GOOD GPS BUT I AM SKEPTICAL ABOUT USING IT AT NIGHT IN ""NEW"" WATER. WE FISH LAKES ERIE AND ONTARIO HERE AT HOME (PITTSBURGH).THANKS AGIAN FOR YOUR HELP!"
