Many boys have very little fishing experience. Any suggestions for helping the boys catch more fish from their canoe. Any suggestions for an experienced Scoutmaster to also catch more fish. In years past, crank baits and jigs have worked well for me up there. Thanks for the input.Scoutmaster"
507416,Guest,2000-03-19 13:03:00,0,"Are you taking the troop on Lake Temagami,or in the area of Temagami???If you are going on Lake Temagami you will find that the Bass fishery is good.Lake Trout can also be productive with Spoons i find Blue and Silver work well,Large enough to get to bottom will you are canoeing.For Bass you can use your regular bass tackle,Spinner baits,plastic worms on jigges. GOOD LUCK!!!"

507418,Fallsman,2000-03-20 06:45:00,93,Which lakes will you be on?
507419,Guest,2000-03-22 21:57:00,0,We will be fishing Lake Wasaksina and some others. I can't remember the names off the top of my head.Scoutmaster
507420,Guest,2000-03-23 09:30:00,0,"I fished wasak last summer at the same time you will be there. I caught tons of smallmouth on a rapala skitter pop, clown color, largest size, over large rocks and weedbeds, had a blast. Walleye fishing was slow, but the best action I had was with a fire tiger husky jerk, pull and pause retrieve, over the large flats in the center area of the lake, others told me that the eyes were in the weeds. Will you be coming through Denedus or Driftwood and Iceland? I have fished those lakes along with Violet. good luck and have fun. mike"
