Thanks a million-FISH ON"

It is such a light, sensitive rod, but has the power to land fish. I also think the reel is great for the money. You can't buy a mainstay name brand with similar features for under $60-$70. Right now in the spring fever catalog they had the reel on sale for $30 bucks. Its smooth and has an excellent anit-reverse. I think the next rod/reel I buy will be the same...I haven't fished with their baitcasting model, but I wouldn't expect to hear many negatives. Another thing with ordering from Bass Pro is they stand behind their product and should something go wrong, they will usually fix it free of charge."

I'LL GIVE YOU WHAT, THROUGH A ""MILLION"" TRIALS, I HAVE SETTLED ON: CABELA's TOURNEY TRAILS IM7 7' 6"" MEDIUM-LIGHT RODS TEAMED WITH SHIMANO's SPIREX RB (REAR DRAG) SPINNING REELS. BOTH ARE $60 EACH. THE RODS HAVE A VERY FAST TIP AND A BACK BONE OF A MULE! THEY ARE EXTREMEY LIGHT AND SENSITIVE. USING FIRELINE OR STREN's VANISH I CAN FEEL THE BLADE STOP SPINNING ON HARNESSES!SHIMANO's SPIREX REELS ARE BALANCED PERFECTLY. THEY HAVE THE ABSOLUTE BEST DRAGS ON THE MARKET. I HAVE NEVER HAD ONE FAIL ME AFTER SITTING OVERNIGHT ON MY BOAT SOAKED WITH DEW IN THE MORNING OR DROPPED IN THE WATER/SAND AS I HAVE EXPERIENCED WITH OTHER REELS! ADDITIONALLY, SHIMANO HAS A UNIQUE ""FIGHTIN' DRAG"" LEVER AT THE REAR OF THE REEL THAT WILL INSTANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE YOUR DRAG BY ABOUT 25% IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE. THEY'RE FANTASTIC! I DON'T HAVE ""FENWICK"" POCKETS AND FOR A COMBINED COST OF $120 EVEN FENWICKS CAN'T TOUCH THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE COMBINATIONS - IN MY HUMBLE OPINION."

I bought it after comparing multiple spinning reels. Make sure to compare features (ie ball bearing)and don't necessarly go with the best known brand (you pay for the brand)"
