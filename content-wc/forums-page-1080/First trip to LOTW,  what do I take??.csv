Hint gas up you car and any tanks for your motor before crossing gas is atrousis here about $3.30 a can. gallon go to any sporting goods store or Canadian Tire store they will have fishing regs. ask the tourist outfitter about special regs were you plan to fish some parts have special regs. clothing warm weather it gets **** hot here up to the high 80s low 90s. wet weather gear. if you are bring your own boat make sure you have a life jacket for ever person in the boat seat chuson are not valid as life jackets."

507107,Guest,2000-02-22 09:16:00,0,"A couple of good comments made above, I wish I would have heard them before my first trip. About the border crossing: be polite, courteous and no matter what he asks, be pleasant. We were ""torn down"" our first year but were still in & out in about 20 minutes. The guys next to us were being a**-h****s to the mounties and the mounties were being the same back to them. Last time we went up we hit a MNR roadblock. Again, we were polite, respectful and were on our way in no time. Guys in other rigs were being jerks to the MNR and the Officers were again responding the same way. Our officer even complimented us and thanked us for being so helpful and cooperative. TAKE NOTE: We froze all our fish in clear plastic. Some people just use freezer paper and when they get their fish checked have to unwrap everything so the 2 inch piece of skin can be seen. Wrap it in clear plastic with the skin showing and any check-points you hit will go quicker."
507108,Guest,2000-02-23 08:51:00,0,"Get a GOOD MAP of the area you will be fishing!!!And a compass, or GPS is better.All bait stores and resorts will have maps. I was up last spring for my first time and got turned around/lost several times(even with a map). I was %$#@?& scared!! Even the guys that have fished the same area for years follow the map. Trust me on this!"
507109,Guest,2000-02-28 17:56:00,0,Be sure no one in your party has a criminal record! We were up last fall and had to send one guy home because he had a record. Another had to pay $120 to get in with a DUI on his record and was told not to come back until it had expired...
507110,Guest,2000-03-04 07:57:00,0,"Perhaps best of all rent a guide for a day,it will hit the cash buts it well woth it. going over the border be polite and you will have no problems.Ilearned something from the nam. if you do not have it your are sol! so bring what you want.never leave your boat with out a compass.Have a few bottles of water or juice with you,sunglasses and asprin.sun screen is a must so is deepwoods off.Leeches in canada depending on where you can get them will be grear or poor,but walleyes and smallies also love fat juicie nitecrawlers. best advice is to use common sense."

507112,Dave,2000-03-17 02:27:00,258,"Lots of good advise so-far. If you like to troll or cast over shallow structure I like the jointed L&S Mirrolures in size 00M, SM, or 15M and the floating River Runts also bring in some nice fish. A lot of the newer baits catch you in the bait shop but leave a lot to be desired on the water."
507095,Guest,2000-02-13 19:05:00,0,"I am going to Lake of the Woods the first week in July. I don't really have a clue what to take along. What are the regulations about crossing the border? We are fishing for walleyes, smallies and maybe pike."
507096,KnottyBuoy,2000-02-14 06:33:00,110,You are limited to the amount of alcohol you can take across the border.......and you can no longer transport live leeches or minnows across......Night crawlers are ok if you pack them in bedding and not dirt from your garden.
507097,GetTheNet,2000-02-14 13:05:00,29,"Non-Fishing Stuff:1-Case of beer or liter of liquor per person1-Carton of cigs per personFishing:NO minnows or leechesYou can bring nightcrawlers but they can not be packed in dirt. Use worm bedding. Northern bait shops will have them packed in Canadian approved bedding.Walleyes:Jigs, Jigs and more JigsRigs - lindy or other bead and blade rigsI also always bring a few crankbaits but don't use them much. Others catch alot of fish on them, so if you own them and have the room, by all means bring a few.SM Bass:Most of my success is on tube jigs and crayfish colored crankbaitsNorthern:Spinnerbaits and spoonsRB"
507100,dlhomes,2000-02-14 15:39:00,62,"#1 Bring Canadian currancy. You can stop at the border and exchange or best is from your bank. The Canucks love u.s.money because they don't have to give you the correct exchange rate. This tip will save you 15-25% of the cash you bring! Use a credit card whenever possible as you then get the right exchange rate. You must pay for your liscense with cash. Fishing: Don't forget your raingear and also some warm clothes. I have done good with bottom bouncers with a spinner& crawler. Last year in 3 days of fishing pretty much only bouncers I lost only 1! If your snagging your dragging. Have also done good trolling cranks in open water. Watch out for rocks, bring extra prop, compass and good map. Don't get caught in the dark. Good luck!!"
507101,Guest,2000-02-15 12:54:00,0,"Everyoone else is going to have better info on what fishing tackle to bring. (I've never fished LOTW) But I have fished for the last few years. First I never get into the boat without a small backpack, which is packed with the following:Rain suit--NOT a poncho!small first aid kit sunscreen (Good way to ruin a trip!)Bug spray (Don't go anywhere without it.)Extra contacts (If you wear them)Toilet paper in a zip-loc bag (Nature doesn't have call-waiting.)Plus I make sure I have a couple candy bars, cans of pop (No alcohol, allowed on the water) my camera and anything else that won't fit in my tackle box but I don't want rolling around the boat. There have been times where I've worn shorts and a t-shirt then long underwear & sweaters all on the same day. The weather can change fast, always be prepared to dress in layers. Plan for that when you're going to be a long way from the cabin. That's my 2 cents. You'll love it."
507102,Guest,2000-02-15 12:55:00,0,Check that second line--I've fished CANADA for the last few years. Sorry.
507098,MP35,2000-02-15 23:04:00,19,"Other border info.... No spare gas, only what will fit in the gas tank of boat and vehicle. Other words no ""jerry cans"" (what is spare gas? must be like spare money! Hee hee!) You can take more alcohol and tobacco but you will have to pay extra duty tax. A couple of years ago it cost me 3.00 per case of beer. Not bad considering the price of beer up there. So, a 14.00 case of beer + 3.00 = 17.00 about 1/2 the price of canadian beer. Unless you enjoy it! Declare all guns and ammo.... I get drilled every year in this area!! I personally have never taken any weapons up there but the border mounties think I do? One year they kept drilling me and I finally told the guy I don't hunt fish with a gun and he backed off. Usually ask if you have any gifts that your leaving in Canada, where are you heading and for how long. Radar detectors are prohibited Return trip...Will ask the followingWhere do you live, are you US citizens, anything to declare, any Cuban cigars (illegal) and how many fish. Pack your fish 1 fish per package with at the minimum a 1"" X 1"" patch of skin showing. Also, freeze fish laid out flat so it can be measured.Hope this helps...."
507103,Bill Coomes,2000-02-16 16:42:00,70,"If you plan on taking any kids & do not have both parents along you'll need a signed, notarized document from any parent not present stating that they know of & allow the child to enter Canada."
507104,Guest,2000-02-17 23:29:00,0,"rigs, jigs and plenty of crawlers(Canadien packed of course). I haven't been up there since the leech band but I don't remember the quality of leeches being all too great. About being searched (I've been 3 times) if the mounty starts writing start sweating because you are about to have all of your belongings torn apart by a party of five. Another thing, if you go up on a Saturday through International Falls get there before 10 am or you will wait for 2 hr in a 2 mile line. On the bright side, once you get there you will have a great time."
507105,GetTheNet,2000-02-21 11:12:00,29,"Willeye is correct about the line after 10AM. It takes about 5 hrs to get to I'Falls from the Twin Cities. If you get to the border after the city folks begin to arrive, you are in for a long wait. I never go through without following every rule by the book. It is just not worth it. If you are ever caught with that extra bottle in your duffle, you will be search everytime you cross from now until the end of time. Keep in mind, if you bring extra booze and plan to pay duty, they will charge the duty on the most expensive bottles. If you want to reduce the chance of a delay while you are searched, avoid Friday and Saturday crossings.RB"
