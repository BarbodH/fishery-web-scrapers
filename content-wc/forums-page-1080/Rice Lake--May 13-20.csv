507279,Guest,2000-03-11 11:42:00,0,"I plan on being there myself on May 15,2000. I frequent this lake at least 4 times a year from Dayton Ohio. It's according what your're fishing for as to where I will direct you to. If you like panfish....Cow, Tick and Spook Island is where you want to be. If you like big smallmouth the same islands along with the channel between the lakes to Peterborough.If you like Walleye... go to the edge of the weed beds and jig at night.I just bought a new Starcraft 17.6 Superfisherman with 125 Merc/9.9 four stroke kicker. Look for me on that lake. I'll be fishing for those HUGE bluegills and crappie. Good Luck"
507280,LindyRigger,2000-03-12 23:10:00,36,thanks for the info. See ya in May.
507281,Guest,2000-03-16 19:45:00,0,"Hello, Lindy riggerI don't where you are headed exactly but I must warn you about the northern pike we have here if you tend to use a lindy rig for walleye I have a much better product that will not fail under the pressure that the northerns put on those rigs, I am not a sales man but I can tell you that I used lindy spinner rigs for many years and got fedup wondering if that was a big walleye or a big northern that just bit off the line, If you would like further info contact me by email,ThanksWALT"
507282,skr,2000-03-19 13:53:00,40,I never have fished Rice in May but have fished it later in the year. There is lots of pan fish in the lake. The walleye fishing is good also. There are no northern in Rice Lake. There is muskie but they are few and far inbetween.
