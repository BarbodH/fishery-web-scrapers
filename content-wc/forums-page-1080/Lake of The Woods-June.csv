Walleye and smallmouth will be the main species.Any action in Whitefish Bay or Yellow Girl Bay?Thanks in advance for any information.Tight lines,Terry."
506764,Guest,2000-01-13 21:25:00,0,"I fished out of sioux narrows last week of july 99. We had a tough time of it. I fished mostly jigs w/ crawlers. Everybody said to use bottom bouncers but I couldn't quite get the hang of those things kept snaggin. We fished from hi-way all the out to yellow girl and past the happy face. Had the best luck throwin spinners for northerns. They wern't the biggest but sure were fun. The scenry was worth it even if you don't catch a fish.End of june might be better fishin though.Got stopped by a warden, he scared the crap out of the wife,pert near ran us over. He was cool though. Said to fish shallow and that's where we caught our fish. Going back 1st week of august this year to give it another try. Good luck post a report when you get back. We were at LOTW houseboats good people there. The owner marked the map for us I'm sure he did his best."
506765,Frank_Walsh,2000-01-13 21:59:00,28,"Terry,I fish LOTWs very heavily in June, but not the specific area you will be in. Typically in late June, the fish are making the transition from the sandy shorelines of bays, to the mid lake reefs.I would start by back trolling/drifting a spinner rig/bottom bouncer combo tipped with a leeech or crawler in about 5 to 15 feet along sandy bays. If there is rock rubble along the shoreline, so much the better. If this does not work, make the switch to the mid lake reefs, pulling the same rigs. I would run from the top of the reef, to about 25 feet of water. When you locate the fish, you may wish to drop a marker, and jig them up."
506766,Dave,2000-03-17 14:27:00,258,Try trolling or casting over shallow structure in the morning or evening with L&S Mirrolures or River Runts. We use Lake of the Woods Houseboats in mid-June.
506767,Bill Coomes,2000-03-18 08:15:00,70,"Terry,After fishing Snake Bay several years ago I got the impression it got it's name from all of the northern pike--we caught hammer-handle size pike all of the time, some nice Bass, & NO WALLEYE. I can't say much for the resort where we stayed either other than it is still owned by the same people and I cannot recommend it, especially it's guide. I'd get out of Snake Bay if I were you. If you look at the FHS Maps, they have no spots marked in Snake Bay. Get into Whitefish Bay or some of the other Bays nearby."
