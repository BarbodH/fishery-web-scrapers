The fishing in early Oct was quite poor, the fishing got better in Late Oct and into November. The bite at times was remarkable.You might want toa have a look at the discussion board at quintefishing.com for the months of Oct & Nov.There were some remarkable fish, biggest heard was over 15 lbs.FYIDavid in Kingston, ON aka superdad"
