We will be renting a houseboat out of Sioux Narrows in the last week of June. We would greatly appreciate any advice regarding areas, strategies and lures for both walleye and musky. Thanks in advance for your help. Brownie"

506776,Guest,2000-01-14 19:39:00,0,"Brownie, I am curious if you have ever houseboated on LOTW with another vendor and what was your experience like. My friends an I have houseboated for the past 6 years on LOTW and Rainy Lake. All of our trips have been enjoyable and I'm sure you will have a great time. We have had good experience with both vendors out to Kenora and Morison. Which vendor are you using?"
506777,Guest,2000-01-19 13:23:00,0,"John -- We have used Rainy Lake Houseboats in the past, and will be using Lake of the Woods Houseboats this time around. They are on Long Bay just north of Sioux Narrows. Thanks for the message"

We have fished Yellowgirl Bay, Chisholm Island and points west. Dan will tell you the hot spots just ask. WATCH THE CHARTS! All the little crosses are rocks and with 14000 islands it's easy to get lost. I like trolling or casting over shallow structure in the morning and evening with L&S baits or River Runts. Have fun!"
