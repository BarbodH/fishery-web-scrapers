507382,Guest,2000-03-18 10:42:00,0,"I prefer an ABU Garcia reel and a Fenwick rod. I prefer spincast because you can, I feel, have more control or the fish when reeling it in because the guides are on the bottom of the reel.EJ's Fishing- http://outdoors.at/ejfishingtight lines to all, and to all a good fight!"
