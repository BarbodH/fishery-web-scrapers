We caught tons of average size bass, reasonable walleye in the evenings and plenty of small pike when we targeted them. It is by no means remote if that's what you are looking for. We did a day flyout with them and went to a lake that we caught hammer handles on just about every cast. Plenty of action but all small."
1272192,Paul H,2011-02-17 15:14:00,1232,"I used to go to the area, stayed on the lake itself only one year. Smallies, walleye and pike - probably no giants, though there are some decent bass. But a good fun lake. Some amazing rock bass - yeah I said rock bass.... Real fun on a ultra light and great for kids if it gets slow. I really like some of the area lakes, if you plan on going to others it's a good place to stay. Feel free to drop me a line. Also some ares links on one of my pages, http://www.paulhaskins.com/fish/gowganda.htm"
1272316,djarz929,2011-02-17 20:22:00,40,Thanks for the replies. My group prefers remote locations. I guess this might be a better area if I am going to take the family.
1273087,captnzero,2011-02-20 08:09:00,15,We're planning our 7 trip in 3yrs to gowganda.we stay at auld reekie lodge the hospitallity is second to none. Gowganda lake is a tough lake to fish. And best fished at night. If you stay at auld reekie they have access to numerous remote lake that can be accessed by 4x4 portageing or fly in. Stompy lake is an adventure just to get to. But this all walleye lake is worth it. My biggest one in the 7lb range. Dinny lake is monster pike up to 50inches. Check out www.auldreekielodge.com if you have any other question feel free to pm me. We'll be there the 3week of june. If you can make it up then I will be happy to help you out.
