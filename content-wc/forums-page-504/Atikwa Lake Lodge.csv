I think it is a beautiful area and would be an interesting place to spend some time. Mainly trout in Atikwa, but there are some portage lakes with other species. I think trout are fun so that aspect intrigues me anyways......it would be a fun family adventure."

The weather is nice and stable, the bugs aren't bad, and the fishing is great (and predictable). I have not met the new owner, but I have heard great things about him and the things he has done in camp. Like v-bay gord mentioned the lake is really known for its lake trout fishing. It is one of the best lake trout fisheries around when it comes to numbers of 3-8 lb trout. Catching 50+ trout a day is very common year round if you find a good pattern. In August the trout generally run a little deeper (60-100 ft) and the most productive technique is using portable downriggers (check to see if you can rent a couple when you book if you don't have access to some) and shiny spoons. Vertical jigging can also be very productive (and fun) if you can find a school of trout as well. Pike fishing is excellent year round with the large pike relating to deep water rock piles and weed beds very close to deep water. To be honest July and August are my favorite time to be up there and the fishing is actually easier than in May and June when everything relies so much on the weather. Its been a few years since I have been up there, but I worked as a guide out of Atikwa Lake Lodge for 8 years so if you have any questions about the camp at all please feel free to ask. If you do book a trip definitely hit me up for more specifics on the fishing, baits, and techniques."
