Last flyin trip we added a little spin on the contest. Each person puts in a dollar Each day when you catch a fish, then you can declare if you want to keep the mesurement for score. Each day a person can declare two fish for the contest. The catch is that whn you have 2 fish declared then you are done for the day, even if you catch a larger fish later in the day. It does make for some interesting strategy, do you claim the mesurement or not. I had one day when I was hoping to catch a larger pike but only declared one 19 inch fish for the day. We had others declare each day when they caught one that was 25 inches. The lake we fish has a lot of pike in it and we can catch fish in the 25 to 30 inch range. We do get lucky and catch several each week in the high 30s so you always hope to get a big one. What are some of the contests that you guys do?"
1259140,tackleman,2011-01-02 18:38:00,444,"I read an idea on another board.the writer said he won a fishing tournament but then said , well it really wasn't a tournament as tournaments go.Here's what the group he was with did.each person put some money into the kitty and then they let each person pick 1 spot to fish. all the guys in the group had to go to that spot and then they measured each fish they caught and recorded it . After the designated time limit at that spot they went on to the next persons spot and fished there for the designated time limit , and they carried on until all spots were visited.the person who caught the largest amount of inches won the pot.It sounded interesting so we are going to try it at our get together in the spring on Eagle Lake."

You record the length of each species and then total the lengths to get your final score. We usually each put $20 - $30 each in the pot and with 8-10 guys it makes it pretty interesting, winner takes all."
1270818,ILScott,2011-02-13 05:37:00,139,"We have a fish contest that does not involve money but bragging rights. We randomly draw partners on Friday when we are staying at a hotel. Then we fish saturday and sunday with your partner or with other people in our group. On Monday we have our contest. It is one persons full limit per boat. So 4 walleye, 4 northern, 2 Lakers, perch and white fish. Can not keep Smallys. We weigh in at 3 at it is by total weight. We have 5 groups so the one with the lowest weight has to clean all the fish while everyone else watches with some nice beverages and fish from shore."
1272078,Guest,2011-02-17 10:08:00,0,"I'll tell you what not to do for a contest. When you have more than one boat involved, DON'T have a first fish of the day contest. The first person to declare their time of catch does not stand a chance of winning. I believe it has something to do with the basic theory of fishermen stories:-)"
1272635,bigtimeelectric,2011-02-18 17:52:00,174,"We fish lac seul in aperty of 5 with 2 boats and every year we each throw 10 bucks in for the largest walleye measured in inches for the trip, it gives you something to shoot for last year 26"" won but we boated several 24-25"" eyes in pursuit of that 26"" that looked a couple inches bigger in the net.. oh for fun can't wait for july....!!!"
1272750,Pikehunters,2011-02-19 07:07:00,100,1.00 smallest fish per week1.00 largest fish per week5.00 most fish per week1.00 boat total per day ( this one gets interesting )1.00 largest walleye1.00 largest pike1.00 odd species ( last year was a clam )We made up a spread sheet & keep it in our log its easier to keep track of than you think & alot of fun.
1272782,bigtimeelectric,2011-02-19 08:04:00,174,wow lots of numbers too keep track of. good for you keeping track of em. I have never figured out how people keep track of their exact number of fish must use a golf stroke counter... we too busy bsing and whatnot too pay that close of attention.....
1272815,Pikehunters,2011-02-19 08:53:00,100,Use # 1563 for duct tape. Piece of duct tape on side of boat & sharpie marker. Mark the fish as you catch & yell the slash to mess with the group out on the water. usually tally everything the following morning over breakfast. Adds to the strategy & start of the next day.
1273180,balsl6,2011-02-20 12:00:00,426,We do this but all have marine radios so you have to call it out when you catch it. Works pretty good.
