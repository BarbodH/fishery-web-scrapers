Looking for some receipesTried them last year, battered the fish with normal batter and a package of taco seasoning added, lots of shredded cheese and salsa and they were darn good. This year think we will take cilantro as well,,,Seems the softshells worked the best. Got any other suggestions for the fishmex ?"

I made it with carefully de-boned pike. It is FANTASTIC if you like that sort of thing. I made half a recipe and I cut the pike in small pieces and cooked it for a few minutes in boiling lime juice because I was a little paranoid about parasites, and then added the rest of the lime juice and let it marinate overnight in the fridge, but that is the only alteration I made. I recommend roma tomatoes and serve it on authentic tostada shells if you can get them. I can't wait to try it in camp this year with a tasty walleye."

I toss it into a soft tortilla with shredded cabbage, corn, cheese, cilantro, onion, salsa and/or some tartar sauce and/or sour cream.Of the details above, I've found that breaded & fried along with soft tortillas (flour or corn) is key for me. After that, I'll swap out garnishes depending on what I'm in the mood for."
