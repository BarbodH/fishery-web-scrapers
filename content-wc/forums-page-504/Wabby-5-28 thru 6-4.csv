1272758,Tbum,2011-02-19 07:27:00,12,I'll be up May 27-June 2 this year. Be glad to share some areas where we've had success over the years. Send me a PM.
1273450,jigmeister,2011-02-21 07:55:00,34,are you going to be at sleepy dog that week?
1273944,Tbum,2011-02-22 11:02:00,12,No...this will be our 6th year at King Fisher. I'm sure we'll cross paths in the 1st narrows. May 27th can't get here soon enough.
1274048,jsmyers,2011-02-22 15:12:00,198,"Can either of you (or any of the other Wabby heads out there) please help fill me in on what is in this area?It is the outlet of the second lake as it heads into the arm leading to the second narrows. (Click on the thumbnails to see them blown up a bit.)For the most part, the contours on the MNR map (that is often used as a base) don't match the islands and marked navigation hazards on the government topo map.Is that rock really there (the ""+"" sign between the little point and the cluster of islands)? Is it basically about 20 foot of water through the area unless you are near one of the islands or shore? Or is it deeper on one side of the cluster of islands?Is the area pretty rocky? Any cabbage beds?I don't remember spending much time around there during my trips to Wabaskang as a kid (just passed right through). Seems like an interesting area, but the two maps I have don't agree, so I thought I'd ask for more explanation of what to expect.I made a rough map of what I'd think is going on considering both of the sources:http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UT...5f6be70f955aaaDoes this match your recollections?"
1274311,jigmeister,2011-02-23 09:21:00,34,"can't help you with the rock situation as this is our first year on wabby.but if there are rocks there we will be sure to find them. DOH. t bum, call my cell in the evening would like to talk to you. 630-806-5795...jigmeisteror anyone else that will be on wabby 5-28 thru 6-3"
1274322,jsmyers,2011-02-23 10:00:00,198,"I forgot that you haven't been there yet jigmeister. In any event. One consistent pattern for walleye, especially early in the season is to find current.I've never fished for walleye much in Wabaskang (and not for years), and I don't know much about that spot, but it has a lot of potential for the time that you will be up there. There is almost as much current flow through there as there is in the famed second narrows, even if it has more cross section to pass through.I've seen the last point on the northeast on those little maps marked on a couple of maps, but I never heard any explanation about the spot.Your hosts at Sleepy Dog will be able to tell you more about how to catch fish in that area at the time you'll be up there."
1274341,Tbum,2011-02-23 11:03:00,12,"Yep...those rocks are there. I'd say about a 4'x8' section of the rock sticks out of the water. No weeds in the area...only rocks. About five years ago, I caught a nice 25"" walleye at dusk off the north side of the rock where it slides off into deeper water with a black/gold shad rap. I've never pulled anything off them since...really don't fish that spot too much."
