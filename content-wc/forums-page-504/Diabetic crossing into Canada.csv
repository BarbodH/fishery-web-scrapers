I will cross into Ontario in July with 2 dozen insulin syringes, a bottle of insulin and a list of meds that I take from the Veterans Hospital. Will I need a letter from my docter stating these are prescribed items? There isn't much information around about takeing syringes across borders and will it cause delays? Seanik"
