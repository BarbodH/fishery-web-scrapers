I can deal with that and hope everybody else can do the same. Sometimes it's a tough balancing act for YDG. I don't know the family and haven't been to their camp, but I appreciate reading about what's going on. YCG is a good neighbor whether in the house across the street or on a fishing message board."
1273563,youngcanadianguide,2011-02-21 12:45:00,60,"Hey Mr.B,The reason that I don't advertise on here is because it's the rules of the site and my Dads rules. I also like giving a non-biased report that gives information for the Chapleau Wawa area not my camp specifically. It makes me feel better to know that people like my reports and I don't have to advertise in them. And for the record my Dad did say I could tell the name of my camp on here but I chose not to. As an interesting fact my parents camp is 97 percent booked already and the new camp I will be running is 85 percent booked. With this being said maybe you can understand why we don't need to advertise. I hope you understand this isn't ment to make a wave.Thanks for understanding Golden Eagle."
1273747,3M TA3,2011-02-21 20:25:00,2846,Well Good Luck Ethan. I wish you and your family continued success. You're a great asset up there.
1272470,3M TA3,2011-02-18 09:53:00,2846,"What's a ""catch and release"" license and where can I get one of those?"
1272473,3M TA3,2011-02-18 09:59:00,2846,"So what's your problem young canadian guide? You've been asked several times where the camp is (existing and new) yet you continue to ignore answering the question. That's not the kind of service your customers want. Based on what you're saying so far, I'd say you're from Happy Day Lodge. Am I getting close?"
1272476,v-bay gord,2011-02-18 10:03:00,3168,There are seasonal conservation licences available......... Good to hear everyone's conservation ethics!
1272478,Wawajake,2011-02-18 10:06:00,413,"Sorry Youngcanadian, although both my daughters love fishing, ATV's and snowmachines , and camp life in general........they are engaged ! but will keep you in mind after you turn twenty if things don't turn out I do miss the fishin up your ways though and try to get up once a year now that I sold my cottage. I do understand why you are not stating your location , so as not to break rules at home and not break rules of advertising you are sensitive to, kudos !"
1272485,youngcanadianguide,2011-02-18 10:26:00,60,"Hey 3m ta3,The reason I don't say the name of either camp is because I am following the posted rules on this site. Saying the name of your camp is advertising and I'm not on here for business. I'm here posting as a outfitter and not as a fisherman. Also, I want to just give fisherman a heads up on whats going on with the fish, weather, bugs, and anything else they ask. Besides it's not important who I am or what camp I'm at, I like talking to other fisherman and asking questions. I say this in all honesty, I don't post to bring attention to our campsI just want to interact with other fishermen and I really don't want the preasure when everyone knows what camp I'm from. I'm sure, over time, people might figure out who I am but I just want to be known as Youngcanadianguide.I know in about 10 years I'll have to give up my name Youngcanadianguide.(I will be 26, still young just not as young hahaha)"
1272500,Golden Eagle,2011-02-18 10:56:00,2642,Would be good if something could be worked out so we could run wide open on the board with our discussions.
1272542,v-bay gord,2011-02-18 14:07:00,3168,I tend to agree with youngcanadianguide. If it was opened up for self-promotion then the quality of discussion would deteriorate.
1272549,Golden Eagle,2011-02-18 14:37:00,2642,"or..........become an advertiser to promote the new camp. However they might expect to fill it with overflow from their present camp. It's great to see a successful business. I'm impressed. They're doing lots of things right.In the past few years I've gotten valuable marketing lessons from two young store managers, one at McDonalds and the other at Wendy's. Both are my customers and I try engaging them in conversation every time they visit.I don't have a good solution for this one or I'd offer it."
1272659,jaggersr,2011-02-18 18:53:00,44,"Hello Canadian Guide,Your news is exciting to hear. You know how I feel about the conservation programs. A few fish to eat and plenty to catch and release is alright by me. Look forward to seeing you guys in June and September. Rick"
1273414,Mr B,2011-02-21 06:28:00,1,"Thats the 1st time I've ever heard a new outfitter buying camps on a lake and not wanting to tell anyone were he is,and a 16yr old at that.As for advertising his camps here,just read thru all the posts and you see ownerstalking about their lakes and services.Sure is a strange way to start a new business"
1272305,youngcanadianguide,2011-02-17 19:52:00,60,"hey Golden Eagle,Its good to hear from you again. Yes if it was a conservation seasonal then it would still qualify and if you wanted to stay at my camp all season I would give you a big discount. hahahaha"
1272307,Golden Eagle,2011-02-17 19:59:00,2642,"Didn't make myself clear. Actually I buy a 4 walleye license, but I fish as though I have a conservation license. If you'd put up with me all season we'd improve your jump shot to where you'd get a starting job next December."
1272327,gunther,2011-02-17 20:45:00,1,"Just an observation from a recent trip to the Green Bay WI All Canada Show. Very few camps made any mention of conservation. I have a pile of brochures showing large stringers of walleye, northern and even bass. One of the features that attracted me to the camp we use now is the C&R policy. I say run with the idea. Maintaining the quality of fishing in your lake is an important part of your investment."
1272332,Golden Eagle,2011-02-17 20:52:00,2642,"I'm really turned off by photos of fish with asphalt, docks or grass included. I don't like seeing a stringer of fish. And don't show me a picture of a bloody fish."
1272336,youngcanadianguide,2011-02-17 21:02:00,60,Hey guys we actually have a catch and release photo contest. we provide digital camaras and the people take a picture of the fish then a picture of releasing the fish out of the persons hand and their is a cash reward for it. I think that the biggest reason my parents run a full camp (80% booked already) is because of the conservation measures. Thats why we r buying another camp we are very full at our first.
1272339,Mondo_)H,2011-02-17 21:23:00,91,Where are your camps at? old and new ones
1272389,Mikep007,2011-02-18 06:19:00,77,"I like to bring home a few fish from my Canadian trips -- it makes a great memorable family meal. Having said that, I firmly support conservation efforts -- I catch/release the larger/smaller sizes and donate to nature conservancy groups and stocking programs.The keys to a good camp from my consumer view:1. Reliable, decent equipment. Seats in boats and dependable motors. Motor size should equal the water -- 9.9 are fine if the body is smaller but most camps use 15 HP and the larger/better ones are getting 20/25. I We tend to travel with guys in their 70s and they can't rough it like they used to.2. Decent facilities -- we left a place (great fishing) because the septic system / field caused the cabins to constantly stink very badly. 3. Good knowledge of the waters -- need to be able to put us on workable holes and explain the best bait/seasonal differences4. Personally, I like to have a walk-in remote lake to try something different on a day. Nice little hike and shot at fish others may not want to take the time to go after.5. Relate to number one -- one of the nicest innovations I've seen is a lodge owner offering better boats, larger motors, more accessories (depthfinder, live well) for a higher price rental. The inclusive plan gets the basic boat and we have the option of renting out the larger, better equipped ones. I get that boats and motors are expensive and this is a great way of managing and profiting. Youngcandianguide, I applaud your initiative and commitment -- I'm sure your parents are very proud. Good luck and best wishes!"
1272400,REG,2011-02-18 06:47:00,445,"I also like to have the regular license. I think you might make a bigger, longer term impact with a no fish over 18"" policy. Bill your lake and resort as a trophy/quality fishery. I'd even be OK with a total catch and release policy on Northerns and Bass. (You would have to push barbless hooks to cut down on the release of hurt fish) But I do like to eat some Walleyes. I didn't notice if there are other camps in your area but it would be easier if everyone was with the program. The guys who buy the conservation license will already be fine with this policy - and the guys who want to take a couple extra fish home might be fine with leaving the breeders in the lake for next year. Just a thought..."
1272429,SteveJ715,2011-02-18 08:08:00,59,"One catch-and-release program I've been a part of that I thought was quite successful was at Esnagami Lake. The owner started a catch-and-release ""club"" for guests where you get a T-shirt for your first released trophy walleye or pike (walleye over 24"" and pike over 30""). Each guy fills out a slip with his name, date, fish species and size, etc. Then at the end of the year, the owner draws four names out of the hat. Each of the four wins a free stay the camp next year. (More recently, he's added a free trip for the largest walleye and the largest pike of the season, and of course those fish are released, also.)Since many of the guests are return customers, the program is well-known at the lodge. Everybody wants to get one of those T-shirts, so everybody is gunning for that trophy fish, and the thought of keeping them never enters into the equation. As a lodge owner, you're making a financial commitment to a program like that, of course, but he's had that program up and running for at least 15 years now, and I think it's worked - literally hundreds and hundreds of trophy fish are released every season.Sounds like what you're after is an incentive for anglers to participate in conservation efforts. The possibility of winning a free week at the lodge is a great way to convince anglers who might otherwise want to keep or mount trophies. As for the smaller fish, I think if you're honest with your guests, you'll get pretty good participation in your conservation efforts. Explain that you're trying to rebuild the fishery, but be careful to do it in such a way that doesn't make it look like there's no fish in your lake. An overly strict program might come across as a red flag to some anglers that the fishery is depleted (even if that's not the case at all.)Good luck, and have fun with it!"
1272452,youngcanadianguide,2011-02-18 09:18:00,60,"Hey guys,Thanks for all your feedback and good ideas. It's nice to hear that their are conservationist out their that practice it willingly. Heres's another question I'm only 16 and I'm in search of a female business partner, so for all you guys who have a daughter or granddaughter ( must be near my age!!) who loves to hunt, fish, work, and able to live in the middle of nowhere in Canada. Please send pics and phone numbers and if it works out I will guarantee my future father-in-law free fishing and hunting trips in Canada for life. hahahaha"
1272277,youngcanadianguide,2011-02-17 18:51:00,60,"Hey guys, It's been a while since I have posted on here. Sorry about that but I had a busy mid thru end of the season up in Canada. We remodeled 2 cabins. It was some hard work but I had fun working with my parents on it and I'm sure our guests will love the new addition to their cabins. Now here's the big news, we are buying a neighboring camp that I will be helping run. Of course with lots of help from my parents. It's an hour away from our camp but in Canada that's like being your next door neighbor. It's between Chapleau and Wawa and I'm looking forward to starting on my new adventure. I have some big shoes to fill but thanks to my parents I appreciate them in helping me get started with my dreams. It will be scary but I love being in the bush and I know I will have my parents support. Plus, the nice benefit of knowing that I will have a camp of my own in a few years. My family will be helping me as I will be learning more about the business part of run a fishing and hunting camp. The lake has pike, walleye, whitefish, smallmouth bass, and lake trout. My new camp is a boat in that is about a 6 miles back on water. We are already finding some improvements to do like redoing the fish cleaning house (with stainless steel counter top), also some new boats and motors, solar lights in the cabins and other small things that will improve the camp for my first year. Yes, I'm a little scared but the excitement outweighs the fear. I'm really looking forward to meeting new people, but I will still go back and see my old friends at my parent's camp and visit a little with them during the week.I'm going to be asking some questions in helping me become a good future camp owner and getting feedback from you so I can make my guest's trip more enjoyable. As I have learned from my parents, if you don't listen to your guests needs you will soon be in trouble.My first question is we are trying to promote conservation fishing which the previous didn't do. I am thinking about offering a $60 per person discount on cabins with a conservation license or a $55 per person discount with a cabin boat combo. I know in the past that some fishermen don't like buying conservation licenses. I want to know if you think it's worth $60 to bring 2 extra fish home? I would love to hear BOTH SIDES of the story. Personally, I would rather spend that extra money on steak and still get some fish to take home because I can buy a lot of steak for $60. This conservation discount is a discount off of the regular price. Not like some stores do raise the price and then discount it. This discount is $60 off the current owner's 2011 prices.Glad to be back, Youngcanadianguide"
1272281,walleye4life,2011-02-17 19:05:00,54,"It's rediculous to take fish home IMHO on my annual fly-ins I don't pay $1000 to take home fish for a reason.... when I get there I want there to be fish. When I spend $1000+ on a fly-in, I don't really care about having to buy walleye for $10 a pound at the fish market... my 2 cents."
1272283,youngcanadianguide,2011-02-17 19:11:00,60,"hey walleye4life,Thanks for your comment and I hope to hear more. This will help me with my price plan."
1272284,trapperbob,2011-02-17 19:16:00,45,Our fishing group always buy catch and release licenses.We buy one regular license to keep some walleye to eat on our trip. Because we enjoy fishing in canada so much we believe in mostly catch and release. We enjoy the sport of catching the fish. We often try to pick camps that have conservation programs. I would hope that most fisherman would appreciate your attempts to improve the fishing.
1272285,Mondo_)H,2011-02-17 19:20:00,91,What lake is your new camp on?
1272286,youngcanadianguide,2011-02-17 19:22:00,60,"hi Traperbob,Thanks for your responce I wish more people were like you guys. My dad and I will be working with a biologist to do all we can to protect the lake."
1272290,Crede,2011-02-17 19:26:00,134,"Don't know if you will be selling licenses or not. My suggestion - If you can sell licenses, include a ""free"" conservation license for each angler in your package price. If you don't sell licenses, offer to reimburse the license cost to each angler who fishes on a conservation license."
1272291,trapperbob,2011-02-17 19:28:00,45,Heh where is your new and old camps?
1272293,youngcanadianguide,2011-02-17 19:31:00,60,"Hey crede,Thanks for your idea my parents do this at our camp and it works great."
1272298,Golden Eagle,2011-02-17 19:42:00,2642,"I've bought a seasonal fishing license almost every year, beginning in 1959. I don't bring fish home. I eat two walleyes many days during my stay. It's been a couple of decades since I've killed a walleye over 17"". I haven't killed a pike since 1976. I haven't killed a bass since 1959. I don't kill trout.Under your plan do I qualify for the conservation discount even though I spring with the extra cash for a seasonal license? A lot of fishermen would do well to improve their care of fish being released. I don't know how to get through to all of them. I've witnessed some nasty releases."
