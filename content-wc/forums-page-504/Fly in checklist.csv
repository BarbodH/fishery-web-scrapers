566214,Guest,2007-06-12 12:44:00,0,"Good first aid kit, antibiotic cream and small pair of sidecuts in case of fishooks in body. (Been there, didn't like it) Good sunscreen, straw hat, and I've started really liking those nylon fishing shirts (flats shirts) from BPS or Cabelas. Long sleeve that can rool up, real lightweight, drys quickly if it gets wet. You can wash it out mid week and it drys in about an hour. http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/te...018&hasJS=true I have a couple of the above shirts and love them. I also have the nylon fishing pants, real thin, zip off lower legs, dry quickly. I don't wear jeans anymore, too hot and I get burned with just shorts. In mid-july, I'd take one of those small battery powered fans. They can make sleeping tolerable if it gets too hot. Yard guard for the outhouse keep mosquitoes from biting your butt. Spray a couple minutes before climbing on the throne. In mid-July I've had 90 degree days and 75 deg. nights and I've had 60 deg. days and 45 deg. nights. OH yeah, the rain suit if you didn't get the message earlier. Seems to always start out sunny, storm blows through, sun comes back out, repeat. This happens every day. Fish before the storm hits. Take a nap when the sun comes back out after the front blows through. Beer."

566287,Guest,2007-06-14 10:02:00,0,"Basic gear list seems to be pretty good. What doe sthe outfitter provide? Nets, Minnow buckets, life vests, Boat seats with backs!! Also if a large party is going then split up group gear to bring. Lanterns, wood saw, First Aid kit, Tools. Bring one or two extra Fishing rods for group and extra reel and new line. We each brought a folding lawn chair so that we could relax in comfort when we were hanging around camp. Our motto is to pay the extra overweight charge so thae we can be in comfort. One thing that work well for us was to pack all the breads and soft items like chips and hamburg rolls into a large 100 quart cooler to protect the stuff from getting crushed. The look on the pilots face when he lifted it was worth it. We also split up the adult beverage between us. One guy brought morning suger, Baileys One guy brought another bottle for aftennon toasts Each guy bought a case of beer each. We did have a couple of older guys with us this last time and we took advantage of the Sat Phone just in case we needed to contact the outside world"

566291,Guest,2007-06-14 13:39:00,0,"Agree on the raingear. The top doubles as a windbreaker too. Gortex if you have the $$, or a high quality one of the newer ""breathable"" nylon. I have a breathable nylon suit I've used for three years, including a lot of portaging, and it's held up to the abuse well. I borrowed a gortex once, and the nylon definitely isn't as good, but it's much better than the alternatives (neoprene or cheap nylon). Can't overemphasize the need for high quality. If you're spending less than 100-150 bucks, you could easily regret it. Also, I like the lightweight nylon ""fishing"" shirts and pants. If they get wet, they dry quickly, and can be washed easily. I like to take a few ""travel packets"" of laundry soap, that way I can keep myself in clean tee's and skivvies without having to carry so much. I also like the ""smartwool"" hiking socks. They're comfortable (don't itch like traditional nylon), dry quickly, and are easy to wash. A bottle of waterless hand sanitizer. A pair of gloves and a mosquito headnet. I haven't had to use any bugspray in two years. A small toolkit. I've had to repair reels and sonar cables in the bush. I take a multi-tool, eyeglass screwdriver, a pair of sidecutters, needle nose pliers (use for hook removal too--from fish), a crimper and some electrical connectors, a lighter, and a box of kitchen matches. A small tarp goes in the boat to use as an emergency shelter, and about 50 feet of nylon clothesline rope. First aid kit with a pair of good tweezers and an epi-pen and some good antiseptic (I get antiseptic wipes) Neosporin is good, but not for everything. A spare hat, had one blow off in a storm on my first canada trip. Some one-zip freezer bags, and a small wad a plastic grocery bags. Most of those items I would take on a portage canoe trip where weight is even more important than on a fly-in."

1272746,Pikehunters,2011-02-19 06:53:00,100,"To save weight I take sweat pants instead of jeans. Slip on rain pants in colder weather. Always take bug spray, bugs can be as agrivating as being cold & wet! Roll of duct tape has a thousands of uses & can get you out of a pinch, works great a beer cuzie fits in the hole to keep it from tipping over while bringing in the big one!!"

566600,Guest,2007-06-22 22:32:00,0,"a lantern for if you are cleaning fish late or whatever outside its handy to have just wrap your clothes around it in duffle bag..bring a couple 1 lb packages of peanut m&ms you don't think about it but 6 days w/o something sweet?small radio w batteries there is aam stations u can pick up in most remote areas of canada sometimes u get sick of the silence. ha a bottle of dawn dish soap most these places have some ratty #### soap that wouldn't clean up spilt water! and remember don't have too high of hopes of your outpost cabin, the 1st flyin I went on we spent 2hrs cleanin the place up then it was good to go for the week..... anyway I'm jealous weve been drivin in the last few years, I miss the fly in outposts.I'm sure you'll have an awesome trip. good luck"
566611,Guest,2007-06-23 16:21:00,0,"two pair of long pants and two pair of shorts. MK said it first...use two pair of zip off pants, whatever weight you choose. They can't be beat and they're the most efficient to use. Secondly, freeze everything you can ahead of time. Then at the last minute, change over from your standard cooler to a styrofoam cooler. The frozen items will keep everything else cool during your flight and will last plenty long enough to get to your destination and get the stuff into the fridge.....assuming they've got one. And then you can burn the styrofoam cooler instead of dragging back. Also found that another way to cut weight (every single ounce counts on a fly-in) is to transfer things from cans to plastic zip-locs, even things like baked beans, etc. If people have a sweet tooth and would like desert with dinner, get a box or two of instant pudding (per meal), pre-measure some instant milk and mix it all in a zip-loc bag. Write the directions (ex: add 1/2 c water for the instant milk) on the bag in magic marker. Also take along a bag of chocolate chips and/or walnuts and mix a small amount in each batch for additional goodness. Lunk"
566725,joeman79,2007-06-27 22:34:00,417,"I was in Walmart yesterday and looking at fishing tackle and spotted a rod tip repair kit. 3 different sized tip-tops and hot glue stick. Thought it would be a great light little piece of peace of mind, so when I snap the tip off my new Fenwick HMG 56 ML I can fix. So its in the canada box. Also bought 3 B-ball nets for anchors, from previous post idea. 31 days and counting. Joe"

1271462,tilldawg,2011-02-15 12:28:00,55,"Many good suggestions. The three most important things:1 - great rain gear2 - rods, reels and tackle (depends on where you are going)3 - portable depth finder (can't catch em if you can't find em)clothing does not matter that much, just bring what you need. The above are absolute neccessities for a successul fly out IMO."
1271880,SinOrSwim,2011-02-16 19:02:00,1528,I know this is an old thread but one thing I have done the last 6 or 7 years is not worry about taking any pants/jeans with. They take up space and many years don't need them. I wear shorts and then on cold mornings (we go in late Aug/early Sept) I just put on my rain gear. The bibs from Cabelas. Works great. I can take them off when it warms up and keep them on if it's cold.I also second high quality rain gear. I spray them each year with the waterproofing stuff before we go as well. Nothin worse than being wet. Gotta have the bibs too. As I said....nothing worse than being wet........especially when a big stream of water goes down your arse crack if your coat goes above your rain pants. Get the bibs.
1272273,djcoop52,2011-02-17 18:47:00,1411,I buy and really like the fishing pants at Bass Pro with the zip off legs that way you have shorts and pants all in one and can change back and forth as the temps change during the day. No problem getting two days out of pair of pants. Sun screen and bug spray important items also. Wide brim collapsable hat works well to keep sun off. LOL

566162,ssauvain,2007-06-11 13:50:00,21,"Just curious in comparing notes about a fly in. What are you guys thinking are must important things to pack and how light do you go on the clothing options...we are going for a full week...6 days of fishing, July 14th trip. Thanks for the help guys."
566163,jigman 2003,2007-06-11 14:00:00,981,"Musts-rain gear, rain gear, rain gear. Nothing ruins a trip like fishing while wet for a week. Along those same lines, waterproof boots. I prefer Gore Tex lined boots instead of rubber due to the latter being hot. That time of the year you shouldn't need long johns, but an insulated hooded flannel will probably be appreciated from time to time. I'm sure lots of other suggestions will be posted."
566172,phishfearme,2007-06-11 19:31:00,1242,"let me just add one thing to jigmans post - GOOD raingear!! i don't think you can spend too much on this item. make sure it seals well in the front and has super duper strong crotch seam. take it from the voice of experience. another item - for fly-ins/portage lakes, you can buy a basketball net and a strong tie-wrap to use as an anchor. enclose the bottom of the net with the tie wrap, insert rock, use the anchor rope to close the top. viola!! phish"

One thing our party has found is that we over pack on the rest of the clothing. 2 pair of jeans 2 pair of shorts and a couple tee shirts and a sweatshirt. Also a heavy duty side cutters in case someone gets a large treble hook stuck in them."
566186,Guest,2007-06-12 05:34:00,0,"Great thoughts so far...I totally agree about the raingear...splurged and bought the bass pro shops paclite goretex rain gear. Nothing ruins a trip more quickly then being wet and not being able to dry things out!!!! I also splurged and bought some nice light rubber slip on boots, almost like really high top tennis shoes, very light and comfy. Keep the thoughts coming....I also think 2 jeans, 2 shorts, 2 t-shirts, sweatshirt, and 1 long sleeve hooded sweat shirts are a must."
566187,jigman 2003,2007-06-12 06:17:00,981,"I don't know about you guys, but I like to change underwear every day ;-) Seriously, I take a change of underwear and a t-shirt for each day. I sweat like a stuck pig and need a new t-shirt everyday or I'll offend my fishing partners. Through in a couple of lightweight long sleeved shirts for sun protection to the above suggestions. BPS has some real nice ""flats"" shirts designed for fishing in hot, sunny weather. That time of year, an item like that could be much appreciated."
566190,Roddy,2007-06-12 07:19:00,488,I also bring a pair of water shoes. They can come in handy if you are in a lake with low water levels and want to pull your boat through shallow openings to another lake.
