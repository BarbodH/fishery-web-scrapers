1274109,55walleyes,2011-02-22 17:58:00,131,Hidden Bay Lodge in Sioux Lookout is no longer flying to Hooker Lake. They are still flying to their other outposts. I was wandering if there is any body out there that knows why Hooker Lake is shut down or if any other outpost is flying to Hooker. I had fished Hooker on and off since 1978. It is a great fishery and I know the lake and want to go back. Any answers or information would be greatly appreciated.
