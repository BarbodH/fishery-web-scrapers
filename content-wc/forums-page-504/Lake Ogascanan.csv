1273865,adempsey,2011-02-22 08:05:00,963,"I have never been there, but it always looked pretty promising to me. Many of the lakes in QC require long travels down logging roads. I think for the most part they are ok later in the season but I have read some interesting stories from earlier on. The Clova road is a fairly popular logging road to get into many lodges in QC. You can do a search on that for some possible comparison. I have no idea if it's similar to the route you're taking though. You may want to reconsider taking your boat though, but I would highly recommend contacting the lodge about the road.I suggest you also try on www.kipawa.net. They have some information there I am sure."
1273889,retire55,2011-02-22 08:35:00,1029,"I fished Lake Ogascanan in 2000 (stayed at Smith Pass Outpost). The approximately 60 miles of gravel roads to get to the main camp were in great shape. While road conditions can change, the write up on their web site about the roads (http://www.ogascanan.com/location.htm) should put you at ease. However, you might want to consider doing something to protect your boat from potential rock/gravel damage. The fishing equipment required depends to a large degree on how many species of fish you plan to fish (e.g. walleye, lake trout, northern pike, bass) and what time of year you'll be there (e.g. lake trout can easily be caught in the first 10 feet of the water column early in the year - no downriggers required). For walleye, vertical jigging, slip bobbering, bottom bouncing and trolling/casting crankbaits are typical methods. Leeches and crawlers are the typical live bait used because it's illegal to use live minnows. Here's a web reference to a trip report from a guy who has been fishing Lake Ogascanan for years - see http://www.kipawa.net/viewtopic.php?...ight=ogascanan"
1274226,dirka13,2011-02-23 01:08:00,15,"i didnt think anyone was gonna throw me a ""bone"" on the info thanks guys i appreciate it, we will be going the second week of july, as for the boat, what would you reccomend for cover? maybe when i launch my boat in early spring when i take it out have a tarp under it? we will be going for walleye mostly but will be setting a day aside for lake trout, and pike will be caught going for both i imagine. again thanks guys. if theres any other kinda info like rod weight/action line to use and some hot lure colors it would help greatly"
1274297,adempsey,2011-02-23 08:52:00,963,"I spent some time researching Lac Kipawa for a fishing trip and it's very near Ogascanan, so it's probably very similar in terms of fishing methods [although, Kipawa is a fairly deep lake overall]. For gear I would assume your typical walleye setups would produce just fine. I was headed up in the summer, so this is what I would do at that time of year.Vertical jigging with a plastic grub or an artificial minnow like Gulp or slip bobbers with worm/leech. If you like to troll you can use cranks, bottom bouncers or Lindy rigs with a worm or leech on a harness. Slow death probably works fine too. All the standard walleye methods should work. Storm Hot'n""Tots (Fluorescent Red, Firetiger, Green Herringbone, Black/Silver, Black/Gold) seem to be popular on Kipawa - I use them all over, they work great. Troll deeper during the day for a chance at some larger fish - there are many ways to get down to 25+ FOW.For trout, sometimes lodges let you use their rods that have steel line or lead core. For me, I was going to try dipsy divers or jet divers or a three way rig to troll using a typical spoon (Sutton 44, Krocodile, Williams Wabler, Lucky Strike half wave) or floating rapala. If the weather conditions were good I was going to attempt vertical jigging with some 1-2oz jigs as well.You can get a free bathymetric map of the lake from the Quebec MNR here: http://www.mrn.gouv.qc.ca/abitibi-te...ogascanane.pdfLooks like Lake Ogascanan Lodge is located on the first map (C-1) [assuming that's where you are headed?].I believe the map contours are marked in feet even though the distance measure is in meters, but I am not 100% certain.Good luck!"
