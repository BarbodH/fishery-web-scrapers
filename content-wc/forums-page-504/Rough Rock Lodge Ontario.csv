Walleye are easy to find, lots of nice eaters and some big girls thrown in, too. The lake is very easy to fish and is beautiful. Lots of nice smallies, pike and muskie, too. The lodge boats are excellent, and the cabins have everything you need. A really nice spot. As there are only a small number of cabins, there really is no pressure due to the limited number of fisherman present at any one time. I highly recommend RRL lodge to you. I made it up there from Chicago twice last year, and hope to do the same again this year."
