1270999,irish21080,2011-02-13 18:47:00,4,Need a little help guys. I am going on a trip to whitefish lake near Wawa the third week of June. I have never been to this lake and was just wondering what type of fishing to expect. What is the water clarity? What type of structure holds the most fish that time of year? What are the average sizes of walleyes/pike/smallmouth? Thanks everyone in advance.

1272143,Wawajake,2011-02-17 12:59:00,413,"I disagree that it is deadlake , I had camp there for 9 years , but so much similar shoreline you need to know the lakes honey holes and lodges or locals can help. 42 inch pike and 28 inch walleye are my biggest, but regular limits of 16-18 inch walleye are common . But bigger concerns is that this Whitefish Lake near Wawa is a Hydroplant Dam controlled reservoir. Unfortunately the Hydro Plant owners last year got extra greedy and water level was down a good 30 feet from regular summer standards they are to maintain. The claimed it was lack of snow winter of 2010 , however even in a typical fall with the two rivers that feed that reservoir , they can easily fill it to brim (10 feet above normal summer levels ) in a matter of two weeks with dam closed. So real problem is they don’t want to close the dam for two weeks straight before fishing season starts. Meanwhile loons and shore nesting birds and animals are screwed. Besides camp owners. So you may want to check with your Lodge owner in May on how water levels are. Normal spring they have it filled to brim May 24 weekend and down to normal levels (10 feet lower by June) But if they have been greedy all winter and low snow melt, you can bet they will claim emergency aspects of their water control contract with MNR again and say they cannot meet summer promised levels, that they have met all previous 9 years I fished the lake. I rented a cottage at Whitefish Lodge last summer and even with very low water levels still found the walleye and Pike. Hard to launch the boat but was able to launch with ATV. Bigger boats you might need to ask your lodge if low water will still get you launched. google whitefish lake wawa and you will find lodges websites"

Besides camp ownersWawajake,I personally sat in the Aug. meeting about the water level's with my Dad and I can tell you that if you also sat during this meeting you should have also heard that the reasons that the power co. couldn't shut down the dam down was because of a few reasons #1 Was because there was fish fry (mainly trout fry) concerns and other people that lived below the dam to complete shut off the water, this would pose a problem down steam. So they sent what level of water that they could. # 2 Was the Canadian Gov. put a limit on the power co. with the min. amount of water that the power co. HAD TO ALLOW to flow though the dam. The power co. had to actually ask permission to even cut the water flow more because the Gov. has a certain amount of water that has to flow thought the dam for the fish below the dam. Also the min. amount of water flow is not enough to make power. #3 For the record I believe if you check the records the power co. DID NOT make any power during this low water time. So they were in fact losing money and not making any money for 5 plus months, if you really think about this there isn't any greed about this. Plus when I listened to the person in charged of monitoring the water level's, he showed the charts and graphs of pass years ( from 1945 thru today) with snow level and rain amounts from the area and I can tell you the he did the best that he could and as my Dad said during the meeting your not God and you have proved that you did the best that any human could have done, besides 20/20 hinds sight is always better.Also Wawajake there is a meeting this coming Tuesday Feb. 22 at the power co. office, they will be talking about snow levels and water level and everybody is invited to bring their ideals.Just call Wawa's MNR for more info. Plus they give a free lunch for everybody, in Aug. it was Subway my favorite. Remember $5 , $5 , $5 f o o t l o n g 's all this month. LOL!Youngcanadianguide"
1272383,Wawajake,2011-02-18 05:55:00,413,"If i still had a camp I would be there . But I do not come to this from ignorance. In 2005 I obtained a copy of the Water use plans from the engineering firm Acres with the 9 options that the power company wanted to determine which was the best water plan . I know all about the plants below the dam and the cottages effected (they all are part of the same land lease cottage group. ) the reservoirs get filled from the bottom one up every spring , then they run the river volume thru all summer and able to keep same normal volumes in each lake. The power company in 2006 decided on option 8, and the promised summer levels it would require but they always had backdoor methods to claim emergency and have lower levels (so allowed to break their promises). but this plan also allowed lower winter levels. Except water use plans done by other water reservoirs in North Amercia do not include summer to winter differences of almost 50 feet . Most water reservoirs in USA for example have a swing of far less. (some as little as 10 feet ) but generally no more than 20 feet so that wildlife can manage the changes. So you see if the MNR would not allow these companies to almost drain these lakes in the winter , then these lakes would not need as much snow fall and spring runoff to fill them back up. Unfortunately in Northern Ontario these power companies have the MNR brainwashed into thinking past practices are still the best. Case in point a reservoir north of Elliot Lake ( 150 miles away from this one) four or five years ago was drained during a extra hot summer when lots of hydro power sales were available. No drought and no lack of spring runoff was the cause....just greed. The locals went out in ATVs to the pools that were left in that lake (Rocky Island Lake ) when it was practically drained and had a fishing spree. No over the years I had many meetings with the power company and the MNR and the land owners at the time and they all blame the other party and know how to come up with excuses , but meanwhile the powercompany is making electricty . Point of fact the July month I rented a camp last year , I went to the base of the hydroplant and watched as the same amount of water was leaving the turbines below as normally did any previous summer. They were happily making power as if no shortage of water existed ."

They were happily making power as if no shortage of water existed . The DFO (Canadian Department of Fish and Oceans) which is over the MNR and the power co. does have a requirement that the Power Co. pass though it gates at less 17 cmf's . This is because of the cold water that is needed below the dam for the cold water species (ex. Trout) but from the meeting that I was at the power co. had actually asked for permission to reduce the flow to 10 cmf's. Also, even if the power co. did completely shut off the water flow thru the gates from July 1st thru July 31st, the lake would have only risen about 12 and this would not have included the sun's evaporation affect which you would not have made that 12 rise in water. Also, the water coming in the lake during July was so little because all of the lower water in the other lakes above the lake. If you want to confirm this about the min. water that has to flow thru the gates, just call the DFO 613-993-0999. Not trying to make any waves here, but just trying making all the info. available and the reason's base on the other side here. A saying that my Dad always says is that there is always three sides too every story Yours Mind and the Truth. Not saying that there is not truth in your story, but sometimes there are facts that have not been shared or known why it was being done this way. Just trying to add info. that I heard at the meeting and why things were being done."
1272467,Wawajake,2011-02-18 09:52:00,413,"Your missing the point about their taking too much in winter and i watched that lakes cycles for over ten years, but I won’t belabor the point anymore. But I will give you one tip youngcanadian My wife works in the logging industry and land leases in your area. And history shows that in dealing with the MNR the best way to get them into action is to prove that wildlife is being effected by the industry practices. The MNR may not react to cottage owners complaining about docks and boat launch difficulty, but they will for example react to a pileated woodpecker nest being in a logging zone. Just before I sold my cottage, one of the MNR biologist out of Wawa, asked that I take on the job of getting a few pictures of wildlife being effected by the high or low water, eg loon nests and beaver houses. Unfortunately due to economic conditions I had to sell my cottage and never got around to doing pictures for her. But I noticed last july 2010 that the loons were already rafting together in groups of a dozen or more , when normally they should of still been nurturing their young ones . No young ones were seen in these groups, that means that nesting failed for all these birds. It failed because too much water was gone in winter so unable to bring water levels up to where loons had access to hidden vegetation but still waddling distance to water. Someone should use photography to move the MNR to action on these watersystems effected by hydrodams. since the MNR ignores the cottager concerns otherwise."
