1254922,Pooch,2010-12-12 11:24:00,4619,Anyone get theirs back yet? How long did it take?Pooch
1254929,Bill Krejca,2010-12-12 11:52:00,6107,"Pooch, As I remember, it took about a month from my July trip. Had to have some camp service (s) listed on the receipt, I believe we got back 1/2 of the tax. In the past, with slightly different rules, I got one rejection, so at least I knew the folks had reviewed it. Bill"
1254963,Skywagon,2010-12-12 15:22:00,1106,"Pooch, if you had just set the combine a little closer you would not need that rebate. We are making ice today, looks like 0 will be the high. Christmas is coming and maybe so is your rebate. Steve"
1255020,Pooch,2010-12-12 18:22:00,4619,"Hey Steve! I'm socked in here tonight. High north winds have dumped a couple thousand acres of snow between the house and sheds. Far more than a PU and snow plow can handle. I've a township board meeting Monday night and in order to attend the road commissioner may have get me out! Never had to ask for that kind of assistance before, but we need a quorum to meet. Do you folks in Dryden get the wind like we do down here on the prairie? Pooch"
1255095,Skywagon,2010-12-13 06:14:00,1106,"Pooch,That sounds like a re-run of the 70's. It does not seem like the wind gets quite as bad here, as on the prairie. The trees block a lot of it, which makes a huge difference. We also don't get a lot of the wet snows, which are so common down in the heartland, so it moves easier. Snow forecast here Wednesday-Sunday, current temperature is -22 F and it's not even winter yet. Merry Christmas. Steve"
1255522,walleyeduran,2010-12-14 20:39:00,286,"minus 20 degres F. in Spoone Wi this morning with a little more than a foot of snow on the ground. 70 mile to the South of us they got 23 inches of snow over the weekend, my poor brother trying to dig out of that. HA HA!!! Like it was said, not even winter yet but it is here to stay for a longgggg time!!!! Duran"
1274250,Skyraptor,2011-02-23 06:40:00,291,Make sure that your outfitter or lodge owner spells out the services that they provide very clearly. Ours did not and it got rejected by the Canadian Gov't. and I had to file an appeal with a special form. Just got a letter back and they stated that they are back-logged for 5-9 months before they can even review my request.
1274266,Pooch,2011-02-23 07:22:00,4619,I had forgotten about my earlier post. It took about two months to get our rebate checks back. The only snag was in that the Canadian government checks could not be processed through our banking system and had to be sent (via our local bank) through a federal agency which charged $15 for each check and adjusted for currency valuation.Pooch
1274314,Bill Krejca,2011-02-23 09:30:00,6107,"Wow, $15, eh? My local credit union didn't charge anything. I do seem to remember a slight hit later, for the exchange difference, but it was minor, maybe a couple bucks or so. Bill"
