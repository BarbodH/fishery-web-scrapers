1267843,jswinter40,2011-02-03 14:42:00,127,"yep, we'll be there when you are there but in the ""blue"" boats 70 footer. probably beached somewhere in the taylor Island area. sounds like you do the same program as us (90% jig fishing in about 15-25 fow). (H2O Precision Jighead (made by BFISHN tackle)in Chartruese Sunburst tipped with a half crawler is dynamite that time of year for us)28.5"" is the biggest I have caught there but a 30"" has been brought to the boat by a fellow fisherman. I once caught 3 - 28"" eyes on consecutive drops of the minnow. (Manitou Rapids actually). many-many 15-23"" eyes."
1274776,whittsend,2011-02-24 14:32:00,14,"Gowrlop - I am one of the ""newbies"" in Winter's group. Anything specific work for you in regards to long lining? It has crossed my mind to bring up the leadcore and longline gear if we have room. Just wondering it it would be worth the effort. Thanks"
1265074,jswinter40,2011-01-26 14:09:00,127,I have been fishing the southeast and northeast sections of Lac Seul for the last 8 years and I was wondering if they have made any better paper/waterproof maps yet. I have the old waterproof green and blue map (forget the brand) and I hoping that they have come out with a more detailed one lately. Hotspotmaps or Lakemaster make anything yet? I want to get a couple for our houseboat trip to give to newbies ahead of time with spots circled and to share GPS coordinates. any help would be appreciated.
1265326,JDP,2011-01-27 08:10:00,1457,No Lakemaster or Hotmaps for for Lac Seul.Some of the best I have found:http://www.trakmaps.com/PrintedMapDe...c-1f02c6aa0d82You can purchase a Navionics Premium North Canada chip for electronics with basically the same information:http://www.navionics.com/LakeList_HM...asp?RegionID=5Maybe others can help you as well.Good luck!
1267429,jswinter40,2011-02-02 13:09:00,127,thanks for the help. that is what I am looking for in the paper map. We have the mapping chips. just wanted a labels topographic map to mark spots.
1267547,lacseul810,2011-02-02 18:00:00,22,The Navionics map is hands down the best map out there for Lac Seul.. The most accurate one I have seen yet. Well worth the investment
1267623,jswinter40,2011-02-02 21:22:00,127,"I completely agree, I don't think anyone should go without one. I just like something concrete to feel/touch/write on/talk about as I get psyched for the annual adventure to God's country"
1267736,gowrlop,2011-02-03 09:14:00,109,"JSwinter40I also fish from a Houseboat in that section of the lake, Wapisi Bay and Taylor Island area. I purchased the Trakmaps and found them very helpful. The maps are way to big for the boat so before we left I layed the maps out on a big table and took pictures of certain areas that I like to fish and made laminated copies of those areas for the other boats in the group. I also made a flip chart book of the route from Hudson to Wapisi Bay so the guys driving the houseboat had a detailed route in a smaller sized map which made it much easier. I have the Canada Navionics map in my boat and have found it to be well worth the money. One other thing when I ordered the Trakmaps it took quite a while for them to show up. They sat in customes for a while so keep that in mind if you order them."
1267753,jswinter40,2011-02-03 10:15:00,127,Thanks for the info. I am quite excited to get a nice big map of the area. I ordered 2 from the trakmaps site and will be sending one of them to the newbie boat . Can't wait. we fish primarily around taylors Island but once in awhile we adventure up past Bear Narrows. Have never gone as far as Wapisi. You guys fish Ski's up there? How is the walleye fishing in wapisi? The newbie boat and I are going to take some time and venture up north more and may spend a day or 2 musky hunting. have any tips up past Bear Narrows. YOu can be as vague or specific as you want. thanks for the reply
1267759,gowrlop,2011-02-03 10:27:00,109,I haven't spent any time looking for Muskies in Wapisi Bay although I plan to this trip. I have a friend that fishes them in that part of the lake. He has had quite a bit of success around Birch Narrows and the islands just outside of the enterence of Wapisi Bay. These islands are what I would call east of the entrence. The Walleye fishing is good in Wapisi but the size isn't as good as Taylor island in my experience. The best part of Wapisi is there usually isn't anybody else up there plus I love the drive up there.
1267766,jswinter40,2011-02-03 10:46:00,127,"what time of year do you go up there? We usually go the last week of june and/or the 3rd week of July. This year only 1 trip the second week of July. We really like fishing a little deeper structure and humps and the shallow action the wind brings that time of year. Also seems the eyes start to preferr the crawlers (much cheaper than minnows) that time of year. worst day I have ever had was 28 eyes, best was over 120. just can't beat it with a stick."
1267813,gowrlop,2011-02-03 13:16:00,109,Looks Like we might be there at the same time. We get on our 75ft boat the 10th of July and have it for that week. We will travel 8 hours up the lake to Wapisi for 3 days then the second half of the week we will move down towards Taylor Island. Most our fish are caught in the 20 to 25 ft levels unless its really windy then we can find them much shallower. We jig fish the majority of the time with some long line trolling. 26 incher is the biggest I've ever caught out of that lake but untold number of 20 inchers. I was in the boat with a guy that caught a 30 and a 29.5 in less than an hour a few years ago in Vaughn Lake in the middle of lac Seul.
