1272071,jswinter40,2011-02-17 09:52:00,127,Thanks Mike. I do love that part of the lake. DO you run spinners much up there? or mostly jig. I am going to give spinners more of a chance this summer as i want to learn to use them more.
1272148,Mike Kansas,2011-02-17 13:16:00,1463,"We are 100% jigging that time of the year. We use minnow or crawler and both produce well.Like to work the edges or front end (determined by wind direction) of the sunken structure we find. Most of time is spent on sunken islands but we do fish on some large flats adjacent to islands. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1272154,tv4fish,2011-02-17 13:43:00,2694,"JS: Sounds like you are up there at the same time we are - last week in June/first week in July. Obviously depends on the Spring/Summer weather, but for the most part, our best luck has always been vertical jigging with crawlers or leeches (or GULP) while doing a controlled drift. We work windblown points of islands or seek out the hidden reefs we have found throughout the years. What is ""weird"" is the depths that we sometimes find the walleyes. I kid you not - we have found walleyes as shallow as 2 feet on a bright sunny day - -'course the wind was blowing like a banshee at the time I live on Mille Lacs lake in Minnesota and I assure you we don't fish for walleyes the same way ""up there"" as we do down here. What we have found is that the fish WILL be in the same ""haunts' from year to year - we just slide in and out at those loactions 'til we find at what depth they are that particular time period. Has worked for us for quite a number of years."

Do you guys go back into Sen Bay in the summer much or is that more of an early season area? We usually fish from Pine point to bear narrows and down to Banana island. this year I was thinking about exploring Sen Bay some, what do you think? thanks againMike Kansas hit the nail on the head. At the time of year you are here I'm spending my time in the same area you are, Pine-Bear-Banana. No question you will find walleye in Sen but I believe the better fishing is in and around the bigger basin."
1272468,jswinter40,2011-02-18 09:52:00,127,"great info there fellas!. I appreciate the Sen Bay info. Sounds like we have the same game plan as you guys normally at that time of year. Crawlers really take over around the first of july and really saves on minnow expenses. So many places to fish up there it just never gets old. It sure is nice when you get a constant wind out of one direction for a couple days. Its just like taking candy from a baby at that point. TV4 - I fish Mille lacs a handfull of times a year and it sure is a different game plan on LS compared to ML. FYI- I am not sure what types of jigs you fellas use but if I can make a recommendation for a jig with half crawlers. BFISHN tackle now owned by Custom Jigs and Spins makes H2O Precision jigs, their 3/16 Chartruese Sunburst color jig with a half crawler is just dynamite for us up at LS."
1272545,SeulAreaWalleye,2011-02-18 14:30:00,100,"You can't go wrong fishing with a 1/4 to 3/8 jig/minnow or gulp when fishing the main basin points and humps on the east side. Color is not that important on most days, the fish mainly just want the meat!!! Lighter shades of white and chartreuse seem to be a bit better. Like Mike said, these are the areas with the nonstop action and highest concentrated schools, for sure. So fast that many times I can't keep up with all of the netting/baiting tying...lol. My walleyes usually top out at 26 inches in these action spots. In all honesty I don't usually find my huge walleyes amongst the frenzied feeding schools. Sen Bay and many other back waters hold huge walleyes year round, which I mainly encounter in smaller schools, or even as loners. I usually tell my guests to let me know when the novelty of catching a fish every drop wears off, so then we can go and hunt for a monster. Sometimes that novelty just doesn't wear thin...... In regards to the eastern musky population, they are scattered throughout in select areas, so if targeting muskies for the first time on new Eastern Seul areas, a guide is very recommended!"
1272563,tv4fish,2011-02-18 15:08:00,2694,"Colin: Interesting that you mention color We have found kind of the same thing - it USUALLY doesn't make much difference - when they're biting - they're biting. Sometimes it might seem that one of the 3 of us does a little better with a particular color, but it usually doesn't make any difference. One color I won't use however, if we're into the decent sized walleyes, is yellow. If there is a northern in the area, HE will hit that yellow jig. . And, typically he will cut/break the leaderless line, so it's time to retie, etc. and you're out of the action! And, of course, we use the lightest jig we can get away with and still stay close to the bottom. The wind usually dictates what size jig we use."
1272564,SeulAreaWalleye,2011-02-18 15:11:00,100,"Yellow??? Crazy, I always was convinced that Pike love the ORANGE jigs! Hope you have another great trip this year!"
1272827,Jabs,2011-02-19 09:20:00,24,"We always have Northern's bite us off with green jigs. 2 Years ago I lost a 50"" plus Muskie in Deception which shocked the **** out of us because we thought they were only in the N E section too. Collin, I've seen recent photos of you and your clients catching large lakers in Big V. Do you only catch them that size in the winter because in 25 plus years our largest was 8 lb."
1272961,SeulAreaWalleye,2011-02-19 19:36:00,100,"Jabs, We catch(and release) big lakers on Minnitaki , Big V and many other area lakes. Last summer, one of my guide buddies has a 36""(20+lbs) laker on Big V with his guests. I see many Lakers over 10 lbs each season in Big V. Keep the faith, they are in there, and after 25+ years, you are due!!!!"
1271598,Pooch,2011-02-16 02:36:00,4619,"I've a question for you Lac Suel fishermen. As big as it is, does the character of the lake, bottom type, fish species of Lac Suel change much from the Ear Falls area across to the Sioux Lookout area?We drive by many camps on the way to Red Lake and only guessed that because of the road access the west end may get more fishing pressure than the rest of the lake?Just curious and thinking about possible future trips.Pooch"
1271665,Mike Kansas,2011-02-16 09:09:00,1463,"We have been fishing Lac Seul for 25 years and have fished both west and east areas and central part of lake east of Windigo Point. In my opinion the central part and north east side are the best overall. Far less fishing pressure in these areas and plenty of quality structure in these areas. Plus large spawning area in NE corner which provides a lot of fish during transistion period to main lake. We focus mainly on Walleye but also do a fair amount of Smallie and Pike fishing and have been succesful with all species in these areas of lake. Lac Seul is a fishermans dream and fish can be caught all over but our group has had many days over the years that 6 to 8 of us have had 500 fish ++ days. It also seems that the quality of fish is better in these areas. If I can be of any further assistance please email me at [email protected] Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1271667,tv4fish,2011-02-16 09:10:00,2694,"Pooch:We fish the Sioux Lookout ""area"" of Lac Seul and I would say it gets plenty of pressure. The boat access at Deception Bay has a regular and an overflow parking area --- granted the last few years we have not seen as much traffic as in the years prior to the ""Recession"". We fished the Ear Falls area 6 years ago -- and I don't think we saw as many boats ""over there"" as we did in the Sioux Lookout area.Edit: UMMMM - Maybe I should say that we ""continue"" to go back to the Sioux Lookout area !!!"
1271696,jswinter40,2011-02-16 10:41:00,127,"I have fished Lac Seul for 8 years now and have always fished the East side of the lake from Hudson to Chamberlain Narrows (NE corner) but mostly focus on the NE section. Excellent walleye fishing, which is all we really fish for. But I do know some rock piles I can go to get some smallies if I want so I would imagine if you targeted them solely you could do fairly well. Northerns are readily available here too. SOme differences that I have heard (from people I know who go the Ear Falls direction) is that there are more resorts on the west side but give you more options in the price range. The only way you are fishing the NE side cheaply is by splitting a houseboat several ways or using the public access in Deception Bay and staying at a hotel in Sioux Lookout (I have done this several times). As far as the fishing goes: Muskies are only available in the NE section (they may exist in other sections of Lac Seul but not in fishable numbers - from what I have heard at least), there is not as much ""big water"" to fish on the east side, I beleive the walleye fishing is more consistent throughout the year on the east side (mostly biased from personal experience though). Either way Lac Seul is definitely a fishery to try if you come to Ontario routinely. My first Ontario experience was Eagle Lake and all I can say is is that I return to Lac Seul every year."
1271775,Mike Kansas,2011-02-16 14:07:00,1463,Great Lac Seul Lodge which is on an island at Hudson is Lost Island Lodge. Great people giving great service and access to great fishing. Been going there the last five years and it is as good as it gets and the pricing is right. Going back as long as I can. Mike Kansas
1271882,BenBeattie,2011-02-16 19:04:00,232,"Just wanted to add that the muskie fishing is excellent in the SE section (Sioux Lookout) as well as the NE section (chamberlain). There are walleye everywhere in this lake!! The central portion of the lake is certainly the least busy with boats due to the limited access and very few camps. In my experience, the East side of the lake is better in May/June and the central basin is better in Summer for walleye. I've haven't spent much time west of Manitoba point but have guided for 4 years in the central part (SWWL) and 3 years in the east part (Moosehorn Lodge, Sioux Lookout) of the lake. I enjoy the east end because of the tremendous opportunities for big walleye early in the season, then the allure of chasing muskies from late June through ice up. That's what I love about living in Sioux Lookout... Lac Seul is in my backyard."
1272000,tv4fish,2011-02-17 07:19:00,2694,"Ben: That's interesting ---- Not that we ""target"" muskies that much, but we always were told not to waste our time trying for muskies in any part of Lac Seul other than the Chamberlain Narrows area??"
1272004,SeulAreaWalleye,2011-02-17 07:37:00,100,"The entire Eastern half of Lac Seul is musky water, I have never encountered a musky, any further west of Pine Point, where the over all basin of this lake becomes much bigger. The East side has a main current, and endless tributaries/spawning grounds. This has to be the reason why these fish prefer one side over the other. I know that I do!"
1272043,jswinter40,2011-02-17 09:01:00,127,"I didn't know that either about Muskies in the SE side. I will have to test those waters.

1272047,Mike Kansas,2011-02-17 09:10:00,1463,"The area from Banana to Bear has a lot of fish as you well know. We have fished Sen during the summer and had some good luck but overall I dont think it is as consistent as Banana to Bear area. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
