Just thought everyone would like to know.The water levels for most of the major lakes in the area between Chapleau and Wawa are just a little bit above their normal levels for the month of February. Snow pack is below average in the bush. This spring's water levels will depend on if we get more snow or if the normal spring rain comes. As everyone knows we didn't get the normal spring rains last spring. There will be another water level meeting on May 6th. I will try to keep you posted on the water levels later this spring."
