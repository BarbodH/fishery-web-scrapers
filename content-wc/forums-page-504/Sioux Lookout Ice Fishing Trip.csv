Loved it so much we are going back in March. We stayed at Moosehorn Lodge at the main cabin. Wow it was so nice! I know these waters really well, but decided to use a guide. Thank you so much to Colin and Brian as they were awesome guides and people. They put us on some nice fish and see you 2 in March."

1271238,Batteryman09,2011-02-14 16:40:00,17,"We mostly fished Minnitaki Lake, we did fish Big Vermillion and another lake I am not sure of the name. Ice was 18-20 Inches. Was surprised that there was not more ice than that. Could be an early ice out!Mike"

Weather is getting warmer, but that will mean more slush. We just had a good dump of snow. Looking forward to March and the entire open water season! I am all about my guests catching lots of fish, and thoroughly enjoy every trip that I take."
