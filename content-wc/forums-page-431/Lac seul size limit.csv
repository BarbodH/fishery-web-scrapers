1445695,jswinter40,2012-06-06 12:41:00,127,"I don't think viability of egg layers is the only factor to limits and slots. it very simple to think about. I am 6'5"" and my wife is 5'10"" inches tall. We have 2 young boys. Can any of you care to take a guess as to how tall they will be at adulthood?If all males 6' and over and females 5' 6"" and over were eraticated or even thinned from the population, what would the population look like?Very simple concept folks. throw back big fish and you will always have fun catching those big fish."
1445814,jas4412,2012-06-06 15:53:00,15,Make sure you give us a full report when you return.
1441516,rnnonmt,2012-05-28 09:04:00,992,Good Luck Bird! There is a sticky link at the top of the Canada Eh page with the fishing regs for the Lac Seul Area. Make sure you read the special regs section for Lac Seul. This is where you will find the no keep slot size for the walleye and the no keep slot size for northern as well.Brian
1441523,wallydave,2012-05-28 09:33:00,2151,Andrea at Goose Bay puts a pamphlet in each cabin that provides info on how long it takes walleyes to get to keeper size. My memory fails me but it seems that 16 inchers are about 16 years old. When our group catches anover slot fish its time for CPR; catch photo and release! Catching the big ones is always special but so the feeling of watching the fish of a lifetime swim away for the next person to have the same feeling!!
1441619,FrankLeigh,2012-05-28 12:52:00,80,"If you google ""walleye growth rates"", you will find that many studies have been done in Canada and the U.S. In general, cold northern waters produce slower growing but longer living fish, than southern waters. Factors include population density, water temperature, forage, dissolved oxygen, etc. Also, in general, males mature faster than females, and females mature at 15"" to 16"" at 3 to 5 years of age. Also as the females age, the percentage of viable eggs decreases. Northern fish seldom live longer than 15 years, with the females far outlasting the males. Therefore, any large walleye is likely a female, with the ability to lay viable eggs, but not as high a percentage as the younger females.So, one has to wonder, why is the slot limit of ""no-take"" fish 18' to 21""? In other jurisdictions it is 14"" to 18"", which would seem to make more sense, or better yet, 14"" to 21"". That range would exclude the most productive females. Although probably, there are not that many guys, who would drive a thousand miles for three 13"" fish and maybe a 22"".And for those who champion catch and release, with ""100 fish days"", how many of those survive? Even if the the survival rate is 96%, (not likely, according to other studies),you are killing the equivalent of a daily limit.To release one or two fish is one thing, but 100?To me, it would make more sense to take four fish, regardless of size, and you are finished for the day, no culling, no catch and release. Or, fish for pike or bass or lake trout. But, again, would you drive 1000 miles, if those were the rules? I think that the regulations are part science, part politics, and the older I get, I realize more and more that politics trumps science, almost every time.About three years ago, I talked to a Province of Quebec biologist and he agreed with what I have thought for a long time, so I have at least one supporter.What do you think?"
1441671,wallydave,2012-05-28 14:55:00,2151,Frank that's for the update on walleye grow. Like posted my memory might be failing must be getting old eh? Your idea certainly puts forward a new way to look at fishing. I have kept fish that would not survive the release. The regs put us into some tough spots when we try to release fish that might not survive. Any other thoughts?
1441777,jimmie,2012-05-28 18:41:00,123,"Last year the limit was 18"" with one over 26/28"" as a trophy. Read the guide of regulations when you get there. I did not have one mailed to m for this year as I do not keep fish but read it anyway just to keep up. I'll try to carify with other camp sites but I think that is an erroneous claim by them. There are too many walleyes and many over the trophy limit to put in a silly regulation IMHO."
1441963,tv4fish,2012-05-29 08:49:00,2694,"Frank: If all we were allowed to do is ""catch"" our 4 legal walleyes and then quit fishing for walleyes, I assure you I would not continue going to Canada. My group is proficient enough in our ""catching"" that we do not ""gut hook"" the walleyes that we catch and I feel pretty confident that almost all of our released walleyes survive. Although you have a good point, I think your idea of ""limiting"" a catch of 4 walleyes is one that would be absolutely impossible to enforce and detrimental to Canadian resort owners."
1442017,joeman79,2012-05-29 10:14:00,417,"It's all in the circle of life. Nothing goes to waste. Pike eat some of the wounded ones and Eagles, Otters. We rarely see Dead walleye floating around on Lac Seul. We just keep enough for lunch or supper and toss the rest back. We don't even bring any home anymore. That way if you get stopped there is no hassle or questions about your fishes length etc."
1442100,FrankLeigh,2012-05-29 12:27:00,80,"All of you gentlemen are helping to make my point. Which is that we have more regulations each year and more exceptions. The 2012 ""Summary"" of regulations is 100 pages. I want to emphasize that. It is a ""Summary"", only.In many areas, there are multiple zones and exceptions on the same body of water. You must carrry a GPS and the ""Summary"", if you want to be sure that you are legal.The science tells us what the prime size is for egg production, but also that when walleye population increases, the average size decreases. A healthy population depends on many factors, not just an arbitrary slot size. Personally, I don""t think that it is a bad thing to keep one 26"" fish, especially if she is wounded. I would, however, strongly disagree with the practice of culling to try to catch and keep a large fish.Lodge owners and guides can tell you more about the health of a body of water than the MNR, because they live there and see the effects that happen when a new mine opens, or a big clear cut or forest fire takes place, or when First Nations people start commercial netting. I have met lodge owners in Ontario, who insist that slot sizes hurt their business, but did nothing for the fishery.Any bureuacrat knows that one's worth is measured by the amount of paper generated, so, Ontario cuts down more trees to publish more regulations and, yet, they close hatcheries, and cut funding for enforcement, at the same time, using front-line people to check you for a couple of beers on board. Without the income from licensing, there would be almost nothing in the budget for Fish and Wildlife.Again, my point is that increasing the size of the rule book, doesn't automatically, help the fishery, which, in turn helps the lodge owners and the economy of the area.Sorry, gents, I probably sound like I am just rambling. I should start getting my gear together, only 3 weeks to go.See you on the water."
1442117,joeman79,2012-05-29 12:49:00,417,You can't cull on Lac Seul.
1444277,jimmie,2012-06-03 16:11:00,123,"Absolutely correct. Only one over 21"". Keep a trophy and eat those within your limit if you like 18"" and under. A trophy for the wall should be 30"" and over or any legit 10lbs. if less than 30"". This is pretty much the rule for nearly all of zone 30. Have a great summer!"
1441240,Bird hunter,2012-05-27 11:11:00,7,WE will be up their june 9 thru the 16 i seen on our camp web site that their is a size limit of no walleyes to be kep over 18 inches is that just camp or lake rules.and how was the opening for u guys up their.
1441265,rnnonmt,2012-05-27 12:51:00,992,"Must be the camp rule because on Lac Seul you are allowed 4 walleye with a sportsmans license. 3 under 18"" and one over 21"" None between 18-21"""
1441301,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-27 15:11:00,298,"This is the way the regulation actually reads, but most camps discourage keeping one over 21"" and some have absolute rules against it. This and the slot limit have developed Lac Seul into one of the finest Walleye fisheries in the World. Enjoy your trip and post a report when you get back. My Wife and I will be leaving for LS on June 22nd."
1441318,Limeyangler,2012-05-27 16:14:00,563,Camp rule. You probably already know but dont forget no live fish in your possesion (apart from minnows)
1441459,Campcountry,2012-05-28 06:52:00,164,What is the rationale behind not keeping fish alive in the live well? Anybody know?
1441462,Blue Lk,2012-05-28 07:05:00,269,"I believe it is so you cannot ""cull"" or upgrade,by switching out fish in the livewell for bigger keepers as the day goes on,reducing the chance of the released fish not surviving,don't know for sure but this is what I was told."
1441481,TroyMansfield,2012-05-28 07:40:00,92,"your exactly right, they wanted to stop people from culling, and up fishing there limit, the chances of a walleye surviving are really low when culled. so rember to break your fishes neck, or bleed them, I prefer bleeding them out, the meat on the inside is perfectly clean when you go to filet them"
1441489,wallydave,2012-05-28 08:12:00,2151,After some posts last year and some talk in the fish house I started to hold the fish down and pull up on the top jaw until the spine breaks. A little grisly but so is thumping them on the head with a club. I use my forceps those teeth are sharp! I have never been stopped for inspection for live fish but it pays to be in compliance!
1441491,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-28 08:18:00,298,The regulation is set up to force an immediate decision as to keeping the fish or releasing it. In 19 trips to Lac Seul we've probably been checked 9 or 10 times. Make sure you are legal - the consequences are not good.
1441501,Bird hunter,2012-05-28 08:39:00,7,Hey thanks for all the replies i cant wait to get up their and catch some walleyes and hopefully some big pike.
