1445768,Sixfish,2012-06-06 14:46:00,2,"Thank you for your replies. We are going up from the Windsor, Ontario area. We have fished many areas in Ontario...North East and North West...including Lake Erie in our area. This is our first visit to this lake and lodge. We heard the lake was a good lake to fish, from friends near North Bay. We are inquiring about the lodge condition and any tips on the lake would be appreciated as well. Thanks again to all the replies."
