1445626,Planocat,2012-06-06 09:51:00,473,"First trip taking grandchildren. I called Canada and here is what I learned as passed on to my son and his wife. Fortunately, his kids have passports so it is somewhat more simple.""I called Canada to get the information.......Here is the website for border crossing. I would use the interactive link. One must be filled out for each of the kids and the information can be printed after it is filled in on the computer, although it does not save the info. You should be able to fill in and print, then just change the ""traveling child"" info for the next printing. This link is easier than the other 3 forms listed in the next section. You don't need both. If the kids all have passports, it will be much easier. Otherwise they want the birth certificates (original copy) as you could run into a jerk (and there are a few) at the border who questions the validity of a copy. With all border crossings, they have the final decision. Using the Canadian form should make it a breeze.""Hope it helps.http://www.voyage.gc.ca/preparation_information/consent-letter_lettre-consentement-eng"

1445859,Planocat,2012-06-06 17:41:00,473,"I kind of like the idea of having an official form with the Canadian letterhead and I bet I can fill out and print the online form faster than you can find a notary. LOLHey, whatever works for the crossing is great. Just hoping to eliminate one of the hassles of making the trip for whoever is crossing the border. Happy to see you have done the same. Now that I think about it, maybe the US Border prefers your documentation. Seems like the last few years the Canadian entry has been more pleasant than coming back to the states. We'll find out in a couple of weeks."

1425243,fishincrazy,2012-04-23 15:27:00,1282,"I was just told that i need to have some kind of letter signed by both my X wife and myself for my son to be allowed to cross with just me is this true?I guess if it is i need to have her write a letter saying she knows I have him,and get it notorized?Any help here would be very helpful.Thanks,FC"
1425255,nicko,2012-04-23 15:44:00,508,Supposedly you're required to have one. I've always taken one but have never been asked to show it. Better to have it than not. Nick
1425257,plumberjoe,2012-04-23 15:47:00,54,I always brought one but have never been asked for it.
1425326,Bill Krejca,2012-04-23 17:16:00,6107,"It is my understanding if you have sole custody, and a document stating so, you can take him w/o your ex's signature, providing you can prove that's who he is. Also, a birth certificate, and of course some identification he has, such as school ID, etc., with a recent picture on it should be brought. Also, of course, his passport - better get working on this soon if you don't already have. If the spouse is deceased, I assume a death certification would suffice. I'd suggest you give a call to the authorities up there and confirm. As I'm typing this, it seems like a lot of documentation to get, so any leeway would save some effort. Bill"
1425375,luv2fishcanada,2012-04-23 17:58:00,41,"I have taken my step daughter twice. Both times I had both her mother and father sign notorized letters saying it was alright for me to take her into Canada and I listed the dates. On each occasion when asked at the border who was all with me, when I began to talk about my step-daughter I handed the officer the letter. Last year when I brought my ten year old son, I asked the officer about needing a letter for a ""blood"" child and he said I did not need one if I was still married to his mother. Probably not a deal breaker at the border but I believe being prepared helped get through quicker."
1425389,fishincrazy,2012-04-23 18:20:00,1282,Thanks guy's I have a passport for him and will get a note from the X I have 80% custody but would rather not get involved in that crap at the border.I will work on a letter.FC
1425421,Happy Camper,2012-04-23 19:01:00,22,A signed letter from your X with a phone number she can be contacted at is all thats needed notorized dosn't mean anything in Canada.Have fun HC

1425684,Bill Krejca,2012-04-24 09:43:00,6107,"Thanks tv. Moderators - This might be another item to post at the top of the Canada section, there seems to be a large number of inquiries on the subject. Just a thought. Bill"
