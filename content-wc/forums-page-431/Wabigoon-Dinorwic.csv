For the Walleye tourney there a few weeks ago, people stated they were catching fish in 2 - 3 ft of water. On this chain of lakes there is a lot of water there to cover. Good luck, It will be good to hear how you did."

Usually minnows and jigs, but last year the may fly hatch was going on, we did really well using small pieces of crawlers and jigs in the weed patches. The goon is stained water so you can fish really shallow. On a cloudy day go try butler the water there is not so stained. You can pick up some smallies and eyes in there. We have picked up some nice musky's and pike trolling crank baits along the rocky shores, watch your depth finder, some places get shallow really fast. We have picked up eyes throwing mepps and small crank baits along the edges of the weeds too. If you like perch go back to mud lake, you have to go into butler to get back there. Some nice eyes back in mud also. get a good lake map. Hope this helps some. Good luck"

I think the build up is as fun as the fishing........almostCan't wait to cross Latitude 50. Thanks to all for the advice. Any last minute contributors, now is the time, 36 hours until departure. Back to all with a report when we get back"
