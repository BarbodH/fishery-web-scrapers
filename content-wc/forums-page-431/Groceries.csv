He likes to fly by the seat of the pants... in the dark... with the instrument lights off. When I'm in charge of food, 80% from home, 20% at the F.F. Safeway. We attend a boat-in lodge so there's no running into town for something. I highly recommend Coyote brand pancake / waffle mix. Add milk or water and (optional egg. Top with real maple syrup. We get the flax seed version, but I think they have two others. I sent an email to the Coyote people to see if I could order it from them but I never got a response.

1430480,Rivratz,2012-05-04 05:56:00,105,"Food, like fuel/petro, has historically always been more expensive in Canada. Everything depends on how much room you have in your vehicle. If space is limited, there's not much you can do regarding hauling groceries. If you tow a boat, that should help with hauling gear and groceries up. Be careful not to put a lot of weight on the trailer axle. A broken leaf spring on the journey has been known to cause severe migraines. Distribute the weight evenly, with the heaviest items in the bow. I like to empty my pantry first, with canned and boxed items that have been sitting around. Try to supplement the rest of your goods from the super stores like Costco, Sam's Club, Super Wal-Mart, etc. The regular grocery stores are expensive. Buy your meats and deep freeze them solid before you go. If you can get some dry ice, that will help to keep everything frozen. Wrap the frozen foods cooler in a blanket to keep it insulated. I like to have a cooler strictly for frozen items, and 1 or 2 coolers for the cold items. Always check the ice on the way up. I personally like to be totally prepared before I go up. After sitting in the vehicle for a day, or more, the last thing I want to do is go grocery shopping. Have a great trip!"
1430496,Rivratz,2012-05-04 06:37:00,105,"Probably best to buy your liquor and cigs at the duty free store. Beer is really expensive at the LCBO. It's such a ripoff at almost $50. a case. Medds1 had mentioned bringing over more liquor and cigs that are allowed per person, and paying the extra duty. Thats usually ok but... I can hear the customs official right now saying, ""Sir, could you please pull your vehicle over to the inspection lane over there, and wait for a couple officers to come over,"" to totally rip your car and boat apart. After they tear through all of your belongings, leave them on the side of your vehicle, maybe ask you, and everyone with you, to go inside, and get strip searched for drugs, because they think your party animals because of all the extra booze and cigars you had. 2 hours later, you pay the extra duty and repack all of your gear that they pulled out of your vehicles. Well, That was fun!!! Doesn't always happen, just depends if the Customs officials were feeling a little bored at the moment, and wanted something to do."
1430609,Medds1,2012-05-04 09:46:00,18,"We have found they check us less if we tell them we have 15 extra cases of beer then when we would take up our limit and buy the rest up there. They have our duty on file for the last 17 years so they can look back and see the pattern. People don't forget that the legal drinking age in Ontario is 19, so they are allowed a case as well. A lot of it getting searched depends on who is driving and if they look nervous. Even after 26 years my palms still sweat but I answer the questions the way they want them answered. Do not give them anymore info then they ask for."
1430620,Guest,2012-05-04 10:08:00,0,"We like to pack as light as possible. We take some meat from here but thats it. Buy all our beer and booze up there. We buy our fresh produce from up there. If we loaded up on all that stuff here we would need another vehicle or trailer to pull. With gas prices now a days I will pack light and buy up there and also support the local business up there...I am sure they need it as well and also appreciate it too. I think we could literally ""pack"" for our trip in 15 minutes and be on the road. If we forget something we will get it on the way or up there or just do without. We keep meals simple so we can fish. We eat alot of fish. Bowl of oatmeal for breakfast and e are on the lake. No big meals for us. We want to fish as much as possible so our graceries are nothing...maybe for all of us out total bill is 200 bucks."
1430621,KevinSB,2012-05-04 10:11:00,73,"I agree with Medds1, although I have limited experience. Last year we brought extra beer, which we had organized in the vehicle so it would be easy to display if required. When asked, we promptly declared we had extra alcohol and were told to go in to pay duty and complete paperwork. I never felt we received extra scrutiny, although as always we were polite and quiet.Accordingly, we've already purchased our beer for this year's trip (in only five weeks ) and look forward to another smooth border crossing. We enjoy unusual beer, so it's a special pleasure to find a fun bottle to bring for a first beer of the trip or to enjoy upon return to the cabin after catching a great fish. Of course, part of the atmosphere is enjoying some Canadian beer along the way.So bringing extra declared beer caused no problems for us in 2011."
1430671,Guest,2012-05-04 12:24:00,0,"We usually do all of our provisioning before we leave home. Once we start the trip, we can't wait to get to the resort and start our vacation. You would probably get shot if you tried a detour to go grocery shopping. Also, we're pretty well organized so our grocery list is complete - whomever does the shopping doesn't forget anything. Frozen stuff is purchased a few days in advance so we can pre-freeze it before it goes into the cooler. How much is costs is neither here or there - its all about fishing and not grocery shopping. We do make a quick stop at Dutchies for beer, fishin license and a few spinner rigs. That kind of shopping is OK, a little tradition. Also top off the tank so we are ready for the early departure in a week."
1430878,SinOrSwim,2012-05-04 21:10:00,1528,"We buy all food in the states. Easier to pack. We stop at Safeway to buy something forgotten or things like potatoes when we couldn't take them over. Plus, with food you don't know what they stock in their stores. I'd rather go with what you want vs risk having to settle for what they have. We have a menu completely planned out.We take all our beer and booze with us. The BEER STORE in Canada has horrible hours so be careful. Would hate to not buy it til you are up there and they are closed. Also, I think the duty they charge is based on what you paid for the case of beer. They will get their money whether you buy up there or down here. We take A LOT of beer!!! We get some weird looks but in about 15+ years have only been pulled over and checked a couple times. Never caused any trouble. I've seen people mention gas and space. I doubt a few extra pounds of groceries will run you a ton extra in gas? Plus, we have found their stores to be more expensive. Also, with space you are going to have to put it in your vehicle at some point? We have found it's easier to pack before we leave rather than packing in the parking lot at the Safeway. Oh, and if you do buy up there, take extra totes and boxes (empty) to put all that stuff in. Nothing worse than having plastic bags and food flying all over. Beer prices are relative. $20/case in the states and $20 duty or $50/case Canadian up there???? Did I mention the Beer Store has crappy hours. Seems like they are open from about 2 pm til 5 pm. ."
1445458,Pooch,2012-06-06 05:18:00,4619,"Since we are on the road two days going up we buy all perishables, milk, bread, butter, etc. in Canada or just before crossing the border at Two Harbors. Depends on our schedule and time of day. There are some large grocery stores that are pretty convenient in Thunder Bay, Fort Francis, Dryden, Red Lake and many good small stores in most towns. Ignace has a good small store on the highway in the middle of town.Our problem is the time of day we hit some towns. Stores are usually closed when we get there and we leave before they open.I think the Canadians have better fruits and vegetables than we can get in the States. Don't ask me why though. Just seems that way. I like their lunch meats better, also.A lot of guys pi$$ and moan about Canadian prices (and money does matter to us), but if we are going to drive on their roads, use their facilities then we should contribute. Most of the stores, gas stations, etc. are small and independently owned by guys just like most of us here on WC.Oops. Didn't mean to get preachy! Sorry if I stepped on anyone's toes.Pooch"
1445566,wallydave,2012-06-06 08:12:00,2151,Our group will buy perishables on the way to camp.Dry and canned goods we bring with us. We fish from drive in camp so our only limits are the space in the truck and suv. The local businesses might not survive without the business we bring to Canada.. Bait beer and ggroceries are just another few things to budget for when planning g a trip!
1445591,Kmanster,2012-06-06 08:53:00,26,Non-perishables in WI and the other stuff in Canada. That way we don't have all the extra weight and don't have to worry about ice. We do purchase all of our beer stateside and pay the duty as we found it is cheaper than buying it in Cananda. Good Luck....
1445612,WalleyeWally28,2012-06-06 09:29:00,298,"We buy our non-perishable items several days prior to leaving and pack them in totes so they are ready to go. Perishables are bought the day before, put in the refridgerator overnight and then in coolers early the next morning. We spend a long day driving to Kenora and don't feel like grocery shopping on the way or once we get there. The next morning we leave early for camp, arriving about 8:30 AM (no time to shop), unpack and then head out for a decent day of fishing. Our buying at home has nothing to do with cost or customs but rather having the opportunity for additional fishing time."

1445882,Canuck_in_NC,2012-06-06 18:44:00,17,"The meat in Canada is of much better quality unless you go to a specialty place in the US, but if you go to a supermarket in Canada and the US the meat is better there. Same as McDonalds etc the burgers are just better there. For the most part we buy meat in Canada, not too much we plan on eating a lot of fish, but a nice steak is good too."

We certainly have never skimped on our meals, it's one the reasons many go with our group. I believe having everything ahead of time helps make sure you don't forget something and depending on how far you are going, helps you more efficiently pack your vehicles. We take a lot of beer, but we pack it in the trailor/vehicles with the heavy coolers of food to best distribute the weight. Having gone for so many years like many of you, we have our ways that work for us!"
1431397,octanehi5,2012-05-06 09:20:00,1104,"How you buy your food relates to were you are going, if going to a drive to place its easyer to bring everything you want Weight is not a problem. when going on a fly in trip and weight limits are 100-110lbs per person you better have a plan. It is very hard to make this weight limit. We plan every meal and eat lots of fish while there.Burgers, hot dogs,Steaks,Sauce with meata balls ,pasta,Bread ,eggs ,bacon,snacks Coffee,Beer, Wine,Good cigars.Cyrovaced your meeats that way they need not be frozen, or Freeze in dry ice ,this lasts for about three to four days.

After 20 years we have our food list well organized. I start shopping the grocery ads about a month or so ahead. Our trip is in July and I already have a few things in the freezer. About all we buy in Canada is eggs and lettuce so it doesn't freeze on the way up. Then some fresh bread.

1431202,balsl6,2012-05-05 20:27:00,426,"When we go on trips I usually buy the groceries. I use tho time to splurge a little because everyone is splitting the costs and it is not really that much more expensive to buy from local (near my home town) meat markets and bakery's, and you will find the taste is much better than any Walmart or Costco type store. I have never had anyone complain about the cost or the quality. You will find it does not really cost much more if any at all. I find it hard to believe everyone shops at the big discount stores for a trip they have waited all year to go on. Try once to go out a splurge a little extra on the meals, you will be pleasantly surprised. Just my $.02 Happy shopping!!"
1431240,bpetersen,2012-05-05 21:29:00,251,We take pretty much everything across the border except potatoes.

I bring most of the freezables and the specific products I like with me, since I also cook, and try to buy spuds, onions, fresh bread, milk, fruit, eggs etc at the grocery in Sioux Lookout. I get what I like from home and don't have to worry about smashing the bread on a 700 mile trip. Helps me be happy eating good predictable chow, and helps the local economy. Besides, we go thru town every day for fuel anyway, and I can get stuff fresh and use it that night."
1429918,Guest,2012-05-02 19:17:00,0,Only thing we bring up is the meat. We use to dang near bring a trailer with all the crap we brought up...boxs of groceries. Canned crap. All we take up now is the meat and buy the rest up there. 4 of us can go up now in 1 truck with all our gear and meat. So So much easier and alot more fun as well to be honest. get our beer..head to store...pick up a few things. We eat all fresh food and produce anyway...cheaper and healthier. No boxed or canned stuff for us.
1430246,Cash,2012-05-03 13:31:00,73,90% + is purchased in US. Once I get across the border I'm going straight to the resort.
1430252,Medds1,2012-05-03 13:57:00,18,"With the exchange the way it is, it is cheaper to purchase most of your stuff in the states. As far as the alchohol goes, the best place to purchase that is at the Duty Free store. Depending on your drinking habbits it can get VERY expensive drinking $48 cases of beer. The Duty Free store gives a discount for buying beer in 5 case packs. If that puts you over the limit it is still cheaper to pay the extra duty to bring in the extra then to buy the beer up there. That is the same with tobacco. Cases of Canadian beer runs 5 cases for $80, $16 a piece. The duty on that still makes the price cheaper then the $48 a case in Canada. Cartons of smokes run anywhere from $15 to $30 a carton depending on brand. Feel free to message me I have been going up since I was 11 and 26 years later we have gotten really good at saving cash on the fly for our trips. There is a way to save on the cost of crossing the bridge to if you make multiple trips or have multiple vehicles going across together. Message me and we can work out a time to chat."
1430258,2746,2012-05-03 14:18:00,3206,"X2. I find a better selection in the U.S. and with coupons, sales and such can save quite a bit. Also have a list we work from and it's just easier (less time) buying in a store I'm familar with and choosing brands I know."
1430272,Guk,2012-05-03 14:44:00,39,"Make zero sense to buy anything in Canada that you don't have to, prices are outrageous and then alot of places will hose you again when paying with the US dollar....we have 13 guys going this year, about $500 worth of groceries and $700 in beer / booze...24 cases of beer and 19 1.75 ltrs of booze, we will pay roughly $400 in duty on the extra liquor but even that is less than 8 cases of beer there! Would love to spend more for the local economy in Sioux Narrows but the cost is nowhere near the same! A case of bottom shelf vodka cost me $54 last night, it $298 for the same product at the LCBO....I bought 2 cases for the trip, $108 compared to nnearly $600, that product alone covers the duty we pay! Besides, seems like when you have a nice size duty to pay at the border, they push you right through! Our trip costs us about 13 grand for 8 days, it would be another $2500 if we got stuff in Canada and we would have to spend a couple hours of vacation time tromping through a store when we should be enjoying an ice cold beer!"
1430300,tooski,2012-05-03 15:49:00,393,I'm thinking those that buy groceries in Canada are staying in a lodge type setting where you have access to a local store. If you are flying in there is almost no way you can find a store open at 7AM to do your last minute shopping. I box up the groceries and supplies the night we leave-- if you need something during the trip it better be in your personal gear cuz once I pack it we don't open it till we are on our lake. As for helping the local economy --- with my three trips this year we will be dropping around 20 grand. I don't think buying a jug of milk will change that number much....
1430303,MorganMan,2012-05-03 15:56:00,341,"We too buy what we can in the states as we know where products are for what we are making. Meat (steak) we get at Sam's....the big uncut loins/ribeye roasts and cut to our liking. Bread packs in it's own tote to avoid getting squished, though we have changed our shore lunches to using tortillas and making tacos/wraps because they are easier to pack and don't get squished. BEER is way cheaper to get in the states and pay duty on!!!!! We do stop at Safeway in Dryden for some produce etc if we forgot anything. As you can see, we all have our preferences and habits. Have a good trip!"

1430432,JJJMN,2012-05-03 21:33:00,153,"Kind of fine-tuned this over the past 20 years. Detailed menu for week is discussed with group and we create a detailed shopping list. Those that disagree can go without. Most of canned items, paper products, coffee and condiment's . Purchased at Costco 1-2 weeks before trip. Meat, bread and cold or frozen items are purchased early morning before leaving Minneapolis. Everything is put into Rubbermaid tubs with lids or Colman extreme coolers. This makes it easier for stacking in truck and boat without smashing the bread, also much easier to unload. During week of fishing any item that was missed or desired is added to shopping list for coming year. We do have a small store within 10 miles in Savant Lake (Limited Selection) but learned the hard way that Monday following the Walleye Opener is a Holiday in Canada. Several things like, jam, peanut butter, Pancake mix, syrup I pull from fridge or shelf from home and just bring back what's left. I also try to keep track of what was left over at end of week and adjust the shopping list for coming year. Beer and 1/5 are purchased at duty free. We drive from Minneapolis to Sturgeon Lake in NW Ontario (550 miles) and have kept the cost down to about $500 ea for the week staying in very nice modern cabin and bringing our own boats. 2 Weeks to go!"

I'm going to Duluth on Saturday, and then my fishing partner and I will be leaving from his place on Sunday morning very early. Should we do most of our grocery shopping Saturday in Duluth, or wait until we cross the border? Are there issues with what things you can bring across? I know that we are better to buy the alcohol over the border, but otherwise does it matter? If we do wait until we cross, should we shop in Fort Frances, or wait until we get closer to Lac Seul? If so, where do you recommend shopping? Thanks, Bill"
1429843,LOW1,2012-05-02 16:15:00,2828,"My preference is to pack as much as possible before I leave. Every time I don't I end up unloading and packing groceries in the rain. It's just easier for me to organize and pack before I leave. It's probably also 25% cheaper.I do stop on the way at a favorite grocery store to pick up some great bacon, etc which isn't available where I live.No problem with bringing food into Canada. I have had more issues with bringing food into the U.S. (citrus) than into Canada.I'd buy and pack most of what you need at Duluth or even at home. A few things like beer, bread, jam, blueberries, perogis (sp?) are better in Canada. If you like wine you may want to bring it with you as the selection at the LCBO can be slim."
1429844,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-05-02 16:17:00,84,We do about 50/50. We bring most of the dry/canned goods and frozen meat from Indiana and buy everything else in Nester Falls. We are a little cramped on room. We used to bring a motor home and would bring everything from home. We now use a van and have to buy about half there. It works out well.
1429848,elway12,2012-05-02 16:24:00,335,"We try to buy most all of our groceries in the US. Seems to be much cheaper. Duluth has some good stores and if you drive to Superior they have a Walmart Super Center. We stock up at the Sam's Club in/very near Duluth and Cub Foods. I know there had been the issues of potatoes taken across the border (but I think that is now gone.) I don't think, besides the alcohol, that there are any restrictions on most all food items. I remember going thru Dryden and there was a Walmart but can't remember if it had groceries."
1429849,camp chef,2012-05-02 16:24:00,915,I pack all the nonperishables in Rubbermade totes. Frozen and fresh produce gets packed in coolers the morning of the trip. A stop in Canada gets us fresh bread when we pick up beer and bait.Best to get as much packed and stored as possible. Bread always seemed to get squished on the way up and it is a day fresher to last the week.
1429861,jazzman,2012-05-02 16:56:00,13,"We also fish Lac Seul out of Hudson, Lost Lake area. We always bring in most of our food from the U.S. We always stop at the Safeway in Dryden for our bread, milk,fresh veges etc. Register for the Safeway discount card before you shop for a nice savings. We always meet other fisherman there doing the same thing. Good luck."

So the past couple of years we've brought up everything. It just takes a couple more coolers for the cold items. The other issue we had when buying up there is by the time we got back off the lake and tried to run into town for groceries, the grocery store was closed. So we had to buy food from the gas station for dinner that night. No more worries about that. Picking up groceries takes up valuable fishing time too!"

Alcohol and beer is purchased in the States as well. We found it to be considerably less expensive. Mind you are only allowed (If my memory serves me well) is that one adult is allowed one case of beer or 1/5 gallon of alcohol at the border crossing. However, we still end up buying more beer/alcohol once we are in Ontario. We probably have a drinking/fishing problem. I also like to think by purchasing some of items in Ontario we are helping the local economy. It is after all their livelyhoods as well."
