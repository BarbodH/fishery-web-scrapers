1445015,SinOrSwim,2012-06-05 07:24:00,1528,I just found my passport in my camera bag the other day. Whoops! That was supposed to go back into the safe when I got back last fall so I don't lose it. That would have been bad as I don't typically grab the passport til right before we leave. Would not have been good if I opened the safe and it wasn't there. Panic would have definitely set in.
