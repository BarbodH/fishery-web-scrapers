1445471,beerman69,2012-06-06 05:51:00,15,"Question? I usually have our local bait shop spool new fishing line on my reels. One problem, they have been doing a terrible job. Birds nest every cast? Here is the question, Is there a special way when you do it yourself? I don,t want to be on my fly in trip and have to constantly re-do my fishing line? PS...All I use is Berkley dark green, 6lb test.... thanks"
1445480,Bill Krejca,2012-06-06 06:06:00,6107,"Wow, we're getting back to a Ford vs Chev thing again. Different folks seem to have conflicting answers to this, even the line companies give different directions. You can spend perhaps days reading on this subject if you do a search on WC. In my 60 some years of loading the line, I have always just reeled it on, letting the line spool rotate around a pencil or screwdriver, or such. I have not had the curious problems shared by so many folks on WC as to bad line twists, etc, who have applied the line by other methods. Nor have I had to re-spool by dragging the line behind the boat, other than maybe once or twice when I used a very twisty lure with no swivel. This has been my experience, you will most like get other ""best ways."" Good luck. Bill Krejca"

1445523,Mohleye,2012-06-06 07:20:00,368,"I also always used the dark green 6 lb test (Stren), and had a local shop fill my spools. At times it worked great, and other times terrible. When it was bad I was always able to let the line out behind the boat, reel it back in and take care of the problems. The shop I always used closed, and the ones I tried since were really bad. I don't know how much is in technique, and how much is because they just put too much line on the spools, but I was getting pretty tired of it, and the per yard price was double and triple what I had been paying. Last year, I bought the 1500 yd spool of Bass Pro BPS Excel in dark green and filled my own spools, just like Bill describes. I've had much better luck, and the cost is about 1/2 cent per yard."
1445556,rnnonmt,2012-06-06 08:00:00,992,Wish I could shed some light on this but unfortunately I don't think I can either. I prefer to have the line coming off of the line spool from the top when putting line on bait casters. I have had good luck with this. On a spinning reel...well... I havent figured that one out yet. Ive tried from the top and the bottom with those reels and sometimes after releasing the bail the line shoots off the spool like I fired a harpoon. Then its time to let the line all the way out and reel back in.
1445587,Kmanster,2012-06-06 08:46:00,26,"I always spool myself. Once finished, I will go into back or front yard, have the kid hold the pole and walk the line out about 50 to 60 yds. I have him close the bail, hold the reel and pull on the line to get some (not all) of the memory out. Then, using a glove or a towel, I reel the line back in while keeping it pinched between my fingers as this helps get any twists out. Or, you can run the line behind your boat at the lake/river and use the finger pinch again. Good luck and ""Tight Lines"" (untangled of course)."
1445599,Larry Mac,2012-06-06 09:09:00,530,"Hi Beerman69, we spool our own reels and use a basic rule that has worked very well for us throughout the years. We use both braid and mono. We do it by hand off the spool onto the reel (no machine). When spooling a spinning reel with feed the line from the bottom of the spool. When spooling our casting reels we feed the line off the top. I remember it this way Spinning/jigging/bottom, Casting/topwater/top LOL. It works well for us. Always remember not to over fill your reels as you will run into challenges with the line wanting to come off by itself. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1445614,MN_Moose,2012-06-06 09:30:00,964,"In my experience it has more to do with too much tension on the line. I apply new line myself. I don't worry about which way the line is coming off the disc as I know the instructions say. I very lightly hold the line between my finger and thumb with my off hand and reel untill the line is about 1/8 inch from outside of reel spool. Too much line on the reel also causes loops and birds nests. Very, very light pressure."
1445643,RapShad,2012-06-06 10:26:00,76,"This may sound weird but it has saved our butts several times. If you feel you have a bad spool of line or have been using the line for two or three days try this. Put your motor at trolling speed, clip your bait off your line, and let the water resistance take your line off your spool. Once 95% of your line is off your spool start slowing reeling your line back on your spool. This takes the twist out of the line and also the reel naturally puts the line on the spool. We do this to all of our spools and reels (including our baitcasting) the last time we are on the water before heading up. It takes about 5 minutes but it really takes care of the headaches that can be experienced."
1445917,Bill Krejca,2012-06-06 19:45:00,6107,"Here's the way I see it: If the line is twisted while fishing, I let the line out behind the boat, this straightens the line out so there are no, or very few twists. If I am putting on new line, and I let the line come off a rotating spool (via pencil or screwdriver in the hole), it comes off straight, just like when dragging it behind the boat. At this point, just before being wound onto the reel, in both scenarios, the line is in the same condition - no twists. Winding it onto the reel, the line twists - one twist per bail rotation - it is just the nature of a spinning reel to do this, just physics, and is unavoidable. After being wound on, in both scenarios, the line is in the same condition- it is twisted. When a cast is made, the line goes out, untwisting as it goes. The question then becomes:Is it better to have the line twisted on the spool, or when it is cast? The answer for me is that it is better to have the line twisted on the spool than when cast. If it is twisted when cast (the line from the reel to the bait, of course) , then the answer to this is....to let it out behind the boat and untwist it. See paragraph above. The above can be illustrated by using a piece of rope and a cylindrical item such as an oatmeal container. Tie the other end of the rope to something, to simulate being attached to a spool, so the twist may be observed. That's the way I see it. Bill Krejca"
