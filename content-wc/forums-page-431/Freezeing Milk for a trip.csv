1445841,Rivratz,2012-06-06 17:00:00,105,"I have to agree that freezing fresh milk is ok but, has an after taste to it. I noticed it. I'm sure the boxed milk is a good substitute but, it can't taste like fresh milk. Would be great for a fly in or remote boat too outpost. I like Canadian dairy, milk and eggs! Have you ever noticed that scrambled eggs made with Canadian eggs come out white and not yellow? Just bring a gallon on ice, and buy fresh Canadian dairy if it's available."
1445121,bfish,2012-06-05 10:14:00,1096,"Why not use buttermilk, being cultured it will stay ""fresh"" longer than traditional milk."
1445129,phishfearme,2012-06-05 10:26:00,1242,i think just egg is best but if you're short on eggs you can cover more fish by adding a bit of milk (or water) to the egg - not a lot though. phish
1445275,tooski,2012-06-05 15:30:00,393,We freeze a couple gallons every year. Just remember to take a cup or so out of the plastic jug or you'll have milksickles in your freezer.
1445279,Seanik,2012-06-05 15:39:00,218,"Many outfitters in Northern Quebec that provide the American Plan (meals) use radiated milk. This milk in regular cardboard containers is radiated and lasts up to 6 months without refrigeration, once opened it is like regular milk and must be refrigerated. It tastes just like regular untreated milk. I have seen it in Northern Canada markets and is a bit more expensive than un-radiated products, also saw radiated orange juice. Radiated products are completely safe since there is no residual radiation present. Seanik"
1445284,octanehi5,2012-06-05 15:45:00,1104,Powdered milk?? stays a long time
1445290,Jiggin_Rob,2012-06-05 16:00:00,26,"I can live without milk for a week.. I bring International delight coffee creamers which have a great shelf life... use it for coffee, oatmeal topping and a little with either frozen or fresh fruit..."
1445292,TIGHTLINER,2012-06-05 16:14:00,223,I been buying milk that does not have to be kept cold until after it is opened. It has a expiration date on it and most of them have been 3 months or better. It comes in a container like you would buy almond milk or soy milk. Been using it for cereal drinking and cooking. No one has complained about it or said anything about tasting different. Beats the powdered milk i took years ago.
1445305,GOBIG,2012-06-05 16:58:00,126,I agree with tightliner. Very easy to use and also is good. Try it.
1445313,Beagle_Nut,2012-06-05 17:21:00,52,"We use the ""milk-in-a-box"" too, the wife says it's in the baking isle at WalMart, not the refrigerator. Also gets it at Dollar Tree stores some times for a buck if there are any of those around you.She also takes egg-beater eggs that come in little cartons, they do have to be refrigerated and are a little pricey but she uses them all the time and they have pretty long expiration dates."
1445323,[emailÂ protected],2012-06-05 17:55:00,21,Why do you need to freeze it? You can buy milk in a quart box at most grocery stores and Walmart in the US. Doesn't need refrigerated until it is open.
1445002,10point,2012-06-05 07:03:00,102,Any of you ever freeze milk for a trip. I was thinking about trying it.
1445005,phishfearme,2012-06-05 07:10:00,1242,"in many northern communities, milk comes in a thick plastic bag (quarts) and is frequently frozen. there's then a pitcher like container in many cabins where you can place the thawed plastic bag by thumping the bottom til it seats. then cut a small notch in one corner and pour away. works very well. we've not done this for years as a fresh gallon will last our complete trip (10 days) as long as you keep it cold. phish"
1445008,Hammdog,2012-06-05 07:15:00,11,We freeze the milk every year and never had any problems.
1445012,Lovetofish,2012-06-05 07:22:00,458,We buy bags of milk from Kwik Trip and freeze them. Works great.
1445036,10point,2012-06-05 07:53:00,102,My wife is from Canada so I know about the milk bags. I was thinking about freezing a gallon here to take. May just use it for dipping fish fillets into when breading.
1445041,stumcfar,2012-06-05 08:03:00,451,"""Milk Bags"", just sounds funny to me!!"
1445044,LOW1,2012-06-05 08:03:00,2828,"We used to do it as a substitute for ice in the coolers, but wife and kids say they notice a taste difference. We have switched to using frozen hamburger and frozen berries as our ""ice"" and keep the milk unfrozen."
1445073,phishfearme,2012-06-05 08:50:00,1242,"it's personnal taste but dipping fillets into a beat egg prior to coating makes for better coating, cooking and taste - no milk. the egg better prevents the oil from soaking into the fish as it rapidly forms a protective barrier and it also holds the coating on better. try it! phish"
1445089,10point,2012-06-05 09:20:00,102,I've been doing milk with egg. Maybe I should just do the egg.
1445105,Lovetofish,2012-06-05 09:52:00,458,We also freeze a couple cases of bottled water to cover the frozen items in the cooler we bring to camp. And throw a couple in the travel cooler for the ride up. In camp I'll keep a few frozen in the fridge freezer for the boat cooler each day and keep and re-use enough bottles to keep our fish froze during the ride home.
