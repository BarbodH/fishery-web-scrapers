1445904,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-06 19:30:00,235,Points and islands - look for the drop offs. Much more of a rock pattern than a weed pattern on many Canadian lakes...at least the ones I've fished.
1445968,Bob_Loblaw,2012-06-06 21:49:00,109,"Since Savant Lake is about 99% rock, that's a safe bet"
1445973,bobo4030,2012-06-06 22:20:00,235,"Sporty, I'm leaving the following Friday for Savant. Going back in late July/August with Pooch and two other old dogs. Everything sounds right on. Pooch is pretty meticulous with his maps and makes it a point to improve his knowledge of Savant on every trip. Stillair Bay is my favorite, but not just because it usually holds fish. It's a beautiful place. It's the go-to area when the wind gets too frisky. You'll do fine. Good luck. Rick"
1445991,Bill Krejca,2012-06-07 04:36:00,6107,"All tips above are good. I have not fished Savant, but the factor for fish I have found most productive has been to fish areas into which the wind is blowing. This can change day to day, or even during the day. It seems to be a food chain thing - wind blows small particles, which minnows feed upon, and up the food chain it goes. The common procedure is to troll until finding the fish, then concentrate in that area, using whatever the boat is equipped with to hold position/repeatedly drift. Not all windblown areas will produce, some areas are just better than others. Even a slight wind, as between islands, for example, on those days when it isn't ripping, can be surprisingly productive. Have fun! Bill Krejca"
1445608,Sportdog,2012-06-06 09:25:00,6735,"I'm leaving for Lake Savant, Ontario for my first Canadian fishing trip on Friday. I have received some very good information from Pooch and others and have another question to throw out. I've never fished walleye in any place other than weeds here where I live when fishing lakes. I spend 90 percent of my time trolling crawler harnesses or crank baits as the fish are usually spread out over the weed flats and drop off edges. What do you guys do to search for fish? What type of structure should I start with? Trolling, casting, wind drifting? Are nightcrawler harness rigs a good option this early in the summer? Thanks for your thoughts and advice. It is much appreciated."
1445613,v-bay gord,2012-06-06 09:30:00,3168,I think the techniques you are already using would work great up here as well.
1445641,adempsey,2012-06-06 10:24:00,963,"Trolling is probably the most productive way to find fish, but we also locate a promising spot on the map and just drift or toss around cranks because my fishing partners aren't always interested in trolling [or trolling isn't practical]. Trolling a harness on a bottom bouncer is definitely a great way to locate fish though. If we troll, once we find the fish we either keep on trolling around or stop and jig/cast cranks. We rarely anchor though - I still have nightmares about being the ""anchor boy"" growing up so I rarely use an anchor, lol.As for fishing spots, I like to fish island saddles, rock piles, sunken islands/reefs, shoals, drop offs, weed edges (can even rip within the weeds with a bucktail jig), bottom transitions (sand to gravel), wind blown shorelines/points, rapids and river inlets/outlets. Typical spots really.So, you can still do what you normally do at the weed edges, you just might have to pick a different ""edge"" to troll along. My experience has been that many of the northern lakes don't have large weed beds like my local lakes do so we have to focus on the other types of structure. I don't know anything about Lake Savant though.I'd definitely use a harness now. I also use Lindy rigs and Slow death rigs.Good luck!"

1445681,elway12,2012-06-06 12:01:00,335,Listen to Pooch he knows how to fish well and Savant is a lake he is an expert on! Having been there a couple of times here are some of my thoughts. As Pooch has said the eyes at Savant can many times be scattered or move from one day or week to the next. Jigging can be great if you can figure out what depth the fish are at and find water/structure close to drop offs. They will give you a good map to use with depths and it usually pretty accurate. We have never had too much luck catching fish at Savant from/near the weeds. Though I know they are sometimes there etc. My group now uses Bottom Bouncers more than jigging and have had much better success since you cover more water and can many times find the fish this way. We have never used worms there we always use either leeches or minnows behind the BB or on a 1/4 or smaller round jig. Some people have success trolling cranks many times in the evenings. The lake is very rocky - like most/many Canadian lakes. It is also a large lake thus we like fishing in the bays and around the islands - they seem to have the most fish consitantly. Just know that when catch the eyes on this lake you won't be disappointed - they are solid fish! Good Luck. I would love to hear your fishing report when you get back since I will not be able to get up there this summer
1445683,Guest,2012-06-06 12:04:00,0,"adempsey provided some very straight forward, accurate information on picking spots to fish walleye in Canadian shield lakes...well played, man!"
1445726,dan cardinal,2012-06-06 13:30:00,64,Sportdog...I sent you a PM.
1445790,Guest,2012-06-06 15:16:00,0,"ive been fishing canadian shield lakes for many years and the first year was by far the hardest. i grew up on lake that had lots of weeds and points that held a few fish, but most of the fish were concentrated on rocky shores or rocky flats. so everything looked good up there, its all rocks!! we find the most fish on reefs and windblown shorelines(we fish mostly lakes with cisco forage base). to locate fish we troll with cranks that run 15 ft deep and go until we hit something. then jig around. if nothing happens fast, move on. if you have a depth finder look for humps/reefs, flats with big rocks. where we go you cant use live bait, so one rod has a twister/ringworm and the other has a crank."
1445870,bigwalleye1,2012-06-06 18:13:00,2632,"go back to old school. Windy points, drop offs, inside turns, with a jig and minnow or troll cranks across the points, or find some steady depth snad and pull some Lindys. Fishing in Canada is very straightforward and basic. It's not that the walleyes are dumber than at home, they know it's a short season and the aggressive fish are the ones that get the food. Take advantage of that. Increase your speed, increase your jig size and find the active biters. There's way too many fish in Canada to try to tease neutral of negative fish into biting. If you're on fish, pound em hard. If you're not on fish, move til you find em. Never leave fish to find fish."
1445892,Bob_Loblaw,2012-06-06 18:58:00,109,"Savant has been pretty well covered - and the folks at the camp will help too. Which place are you staying at? DEFINITELY fish the wind, and - as mentioned above - don't leave fish unless you just feel like exploring. I've had days on Savant where my boat has pulled 50-60 walleyes out of a school over the course of an hour and a half. There are some weedy areas like Finger Bay that hold some eyes, but our best bet by far is fishing narrows areas and windblown points/islands. It's a very fun lake to explore,just wach out for rocks . Enjoy the trip, and give us a report when you return. Only 32 days til I leave for Savant!"
