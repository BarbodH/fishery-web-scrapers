A couple of us in our group are considering a new lake to fish next year and this lake looks nice from what I can see from Google maps.Thanks,Hammy."

We fished mostly for smallmouth. I think we caught 2 walleyes and 1 pike and the rest were smallmouth. I was with my Dad in his boat and he wasn't in for going very far. We made one trip to cross lake which I think was 11 miles. That lake gets little activity as the only way into it is from Temagami. The water was pretty low and we damaged 2 props. I think most will say it's a hard lake to learn as it is very large. Sorry I can't give you more than that.
