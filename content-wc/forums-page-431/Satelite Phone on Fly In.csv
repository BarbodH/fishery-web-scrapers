1445185,Ogoki,2012-06-05 12:14:00,291,We use Mattice Lake Outfitters and they have radios with connection to their base . Good for emergency and knowing when you get picked up .

1444815,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-04 18:36:00,235,"Question for those who do a fly in outpost trip: do you pay the extra money for the satelite phone rental? Our group never does, and I'm not sure how I feel about that. In some cases the ability to get to a hospital quickly is life or death. You can easilly wait a day or two for flyover check. We are lucky to have two doctors in our group, so that's good, but some times there's only so much a doctor can do without the technology and available meds."
1444832,Guest,2012-06-04 19:18:00,0,I will be going on my first fly in this year. It is just my two young sons and me. The outfitter rents Sat phones for $100. To me it seems like a reasonable price to have peace of mind just in case something bad happens. Definitely would not think twice about renting one if you are splitting the cost between 3 or 4 guys.
1444859,CSH Kucinski,2012-06-04 20:13:00,1340,"Tomorrow we leave for our annual Fly - In outpost trip, this will be our 11th year in a row. Outfitter is located eight hours N of Toronto where there is no cell phone service. We DO NOT leave the base camp without a satelite phone. We have heard too many stories about serious injuries or even deaths and that time saved by using one may just be the difference between life and death."
1444950,DavKin,2012-06-05 04:44:00,104,"Yes, we rent a sat phone from out outfitter for $100/week. The only time we use it is when we call them to check on our pick up flight or to let them know something needs to be fixed at our outpost. Signal strength and coverage is spotty. Waiting 20 minutes is not unusual."
1444971,rsiminski,2012-06-05 05:50:00,53,We use Cesars North Camps. Two of their outpost camps that have 45 min fly time has a phone at the cabin. Oliver does not charge any money for the phone but it is only for emergency use. Its nice to know that the phone is available if you need it. The other camps you will have to put the red flag out on the dock.
1445001,phishfearme,2012-06-05 07:02:00,1242,"for this coming trip with pete johnson out of pickle lake - he provides a satellite phone at the outpost for free - it's for our use to call in periodically but not to abuse. last year with thousand lakes outpost at kearns lake, the outfitter provided a satellite phone free but it only worked when one satellite was overhead - about 10 minutes out of every two hours. it was a challenge to make a call but it worked and it was free and much better than nothing. in previous years with north of 51 out of pickle lake, the outfitter provided a radio phone that reached his base camp - this was VERY convenient and also free (ie; part of the base trip cost). it only worked because his outposts were within about 50 miles of the base. prior to that, we had no communication with the outside world until the mid-trip check which sometimes didn't occur - i would guess that the liability now would result in outfitters being required to at least offer the satellit service - it's up to you then if it's worth the price. phish"
1445014,beerman69,2012-06-05 07:23:00,15,"We are leaving June 21st, Unknown Lake, Cochrane Air services!! My 17th trip with them.. We rent a phone from here https://www.satellitephonestore.com/...ium-9505a.html .... Never had a problem!!"
1445019,MorganMan,2012-06-05 07:30:00,341,"We have paid to have the satellite phone with us also every year since they became available. With so many guys with little ones at home, it's a small piece of mind to have that option to reach out if we needed to. Getting service was a bit of a trick occasionally, but worked if we needed it to. I don't recall the rate? I think we paid $50 for the 5 days we were in the bush and there was a calling card in there that we didn't get charged for if we didn't use it?? I think that's how it worked. Thankfully, we never had a true emergency that we needed to get help to us, but I have heard stories of serious issues others have had. Seems to be a wise investment easily split between the group."
1445034,jball82,2012-06-05 07:50:00,2,"I've always used Mobal.com. Its about $130 for 8 days and their phones are top of the line. Not to mention their per min rate is cheap, only $1 for outgoing. Once you learn how to use a sat phone it works 98% of the time. You have to know where the satellites are positioned and how to tilt the antenna. Mobal does a great job of explaining this to you."
1445147,labsrus,2012-06-05 10:49:00,557,"We took one on our trip last summer. Good thing, one of our guys suffered a heart attack and it still took 5 hours to get him out of the woods. We will always take one from now on."
