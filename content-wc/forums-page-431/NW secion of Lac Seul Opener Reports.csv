A little bit of wind does wonders, otherwise, your guess is as good as mine, and many others at the camp, as to where to find 'em. The usual bevy of boats are parked at Ghost Narrows as I have gone by. I suppose they wouldn't be sitting there unless some sort of bite is on. However, the weather is magnificent, we've caught our share, and my son and daughter saw a big *** black bear give chase to a cow and her calf today at the north end of Sunlight today. About the coolest thing I've ever seen. Can't beat Lac Seul even if she's a bit winsome with her treasure."
