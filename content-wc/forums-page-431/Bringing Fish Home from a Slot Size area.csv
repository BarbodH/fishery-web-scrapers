1444569,v-bay gord,2012-06-04 09:49:00,3168,I was told that size could be verified by analysis of the flakes (for lack of the proper term) of the fillet. Apparently they increase in size as the fish does. Obviously not something the average C.O. would be able to do on the spot.....but possible if they wished to investigate further.
1444826,RickOnt,2012-06-04 18:56:00,217,"I believe the skin left on is for determining species Bass,Lakers,WalleyeThe Length at 17.5"" to 19.5"" would be very tough to be exact.We are always very dilligent in packaging.But always bring some home.Sometmes in Camp we have to be careful as to limit!Rick"
1444911,3M TA3,2012-06-04 22:15:00,2846,What's with the diligently marked fillets and written label? Never heard of such a thing. Is that a new law or something?
1444951,Bill Krejca,2012-06-05 04:49:00,6107,"Labeling is not required in Ontario as far as I know. It is a good way, however, to keep track of what is in the freezer, besides a list. My guess would be that it also tends to show intent to follow the law, something I would at least take note of, if I were the warden. Also, sometimes the guy in the party who is checking the fish while in camp may not be as aware of what he is looking at, so additional info for him helps. There is an official series of pictures describing proper packaging, etc., I just don't remember where it is on the fish laws site. Perhaps someone could share that with us. Bill Krejca"
1444957,Aaron-IN,2012-06-05 05:16:00,500,"The burden of proof is on the CO, not the fisherman. If I keep legal fish and the CO thinks I didn't then he/she better be able to prove it wasn't legal. That's pretty much what if comes down to. I have yet to meet a CO in Ontario that didn't exercise a great degree of common sense in such matters."
1444978,north560,2012-06-05 06:03:00,53,the easiest thing to do ONLY GUT and GILL the over size that way there is no problem.Remember sometimes the fillet of a 16-17 walleye can be as big as a 18.1.
1445092,RapShad,2012-06-05 09:31:00,76,"From what I've gathered from being a long time friend of a retired ON MNR Agent from Sioux Lookout. It's really hard to figure out what size the fish is once it has been filleted and frozen. What they are looking for on the road stops that we see south of Dryden is A) Showing their presence to all of us American fisherman B) Sometimes they receive tips from locals, camps, responsible American fisherman etc. and doing these stops is an easy way to catch people, because it is a major funnel from several major fishing areas. If they notice that a fish does not have the skin tag on it or the anglers are acting sketchily they probably are going to ""take their time"" and be more thorough with their searches. On the drive back make sure your cooler is easily accessible (we always load the cooler last along with the toolbox), you have your fishing licenses and passports readily available. If you follow the law and treat the MNR/OPP officer respectfully and have all of your stuff ready the stop will take two minutes and you will be on your way to sit in Fort Francis border traffic."
1445139,phishfearme,2012-06-05 10:37:00,1242,"Bill K is right on the money - labeling each package - with masking tape wrapped around the package for example (you can write on masking tape easilly) - is definitly not required - but it shows your intent to follow the law. we mark ours with W, P or PERCH (and once in a while WHITE for whitefish) and the size: <18 or >18 or whatever the important size limit is. using metric doesn't hurt either although many of the MNR guys i've talked with still use and prefer the english units - habits die hard. phish"
1445258,3M TA3,2012-06-05 14:46:00,2846,"I guess this all seems strange to me because I don't take fish home with me. I get all I want at home and it just doesn't seem worth going through all the trouble. Besides, Michigan fish taste better than Ontario fish anyways. Also, only eat 2 to 4 Walleye meals during a week or two stay anyways and always buy the conservation license."

1444366,RickOnt,2012-06-03 19:13:00,217,"So if I am travelling with fillets, I came from a 4 fish limit with 0ne over 18"" area.My fillets are frozen.How can a Game Warden or Ministry guy determine the length?orAs long as I only have 4, I am good to go!Rick"
1444374,Glenman12,2012-06-03 19:25:00,762,"well youre supposed to leave, I believe, one square inch of skin on each fillet..supposedly they can tell from the scales how big the fish was..at least thats what I was told a while back...not sure if thats true but thats what we've been doing for years.."
1444379,RickOnt,2012-06-03 19:36:00,217,"I hear Ya on leaving a bit of skin on, But I gotta think it is pretty hard to determine length from that bit of scales. Just by looking at it.Rick"
1444419,wallydave,2012-06-03 20:51:00,2151,"We put our names, what type of fish, even though we only take walleye home, and the length on the ziplock bag. One fish, two fillets per bag. We haven't been checked yet, but hopefully we will not have any issues if we are checked!"
1444426,Glenman12,2012-06-03 21:01:00,762,Im guessing a conservation officer can..but like walleyedave said we also mark the length of the fish on the freezer bad...I doubt they go on the honor system so theres got to be some way they can tell..Im sure someone who knows for sure will chime in..maybe the skin is to just determine the species?
1444431,SteveJ715,2012-06-03 21:11:00,59,"My guess is that if you're asking whether they can tell the difference between a 18.5"" fish and a 17.9"" fish after it's been filleted and frozen, the honest answer is no. But I think they are looking for two things: 1) are you within your limit (numbers-wise); and 2) if you can only have 1 fish over 18"", do you have more than one fish fish that is clearly, obviously bigger than that? It doesn't take a rocket scientist to tell the difference between a 23"" fillet and a 17.5"" fillet, especially if you look at fish every day, as these MNR folks must.Note that this is just my best guess, what I would do.- Steve"
1444472,@Lunker,2012-06-04 05:01:00,835,"I don't think they can tell either with the fish within an inch or so of the cut-off. Only thing I can add here is that the camp I go to marks the ""over"" as W/O. 'Course, if you're doing your own butchering and wrapping, it's a moot point."
1444490,phishfearme,2012-06-04 06:14:00,1242,steve is on the money - as long as you have diligently maked your fillets properly (skin and written label) there will not be a problem. the key is to show that you have understood and obeyed the laws. phsih
1444509,Bill Krejca,2012-06-04 07:16:00,6107,"I believe the general consensus is as stated, very difficult to pick out 17-7/8"" from 19"". One camp I go to marks the overs, but not required to do so. If the camp doesn't, and I have an over, I mark it, just as a matter of trying to be conscientious about the intent of the law. An interesting twist to marking the overs, which I have thought about, would be if a smaller one was inadvertently marked over, and you ended up with too many marked ""over"", you could be in trouble, also. Just thinking. Bill Krejca"
1444544,retire55,2012-06-04 08:56:00,1029,"In Ontario, all size limits refer to total length which is a measure from the tip of the mouth with the jaws closed to the tip of the tail, with tail fin lobes compressed to give maximum possible length. I suggest that the maximum length of a fillet from a legally harvested 18 inch walleye is no longer than 13.5 inches (max). Consequently, as long as you only have two fillets (from one walleye) over 13.5 inches, you won't have any problems satisfying length limits with the authorities. I do all my walleye fishing in Quebec. There are few slot limits there. The norm is usually a minimum length limit. For lakes with a minimum length limit of 14.5 inches, the fillets must be at least 9 inches long. On those lakes with a minimum harvest length of 12.5 inches, fillets must be at least 8 inches in length."
