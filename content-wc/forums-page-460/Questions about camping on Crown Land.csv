I know the rules about only having beer at the cabin and not at shore lunch or in the boat but what about if you are tent camping on crown land, can you have beer at your campsite? Hopefully someone can clear this up. I always get a conservation license. I've been told that if you are camping possession limits are cut in half no matter what license you buy. I've also been told that they are whatever the conservation license says. Also for those of you who camp in remote areas on crown land do you do anything for bear protection. I know last year when we were staying with an outfitter he had a shotgun flown in due to a problem bear. I was thinking if we just did everything ""bear safe"" we should be ok.If anyone wants to add any other tips or considerations for camping on crown land feel free. Thanksunclepaully"

I believe you have to follow the rules of a conservation license for fishing as well.I don't think there are any alcohol restrictions specific for crown land. Also, I don't see why you can't drink beer at a shore lunch as long as the person operating the [motorized] boat isn't drinking.In regards to bears, I don't think you need to do anything beyond what you would normally do when you go camping (keep food away from sleeping area, don't sleep in clothes you cooked in etc..). If anything, it's probably less of a problem than at a populated campground."

My understanding on the beer thing is that it is OK in bringing it to the camp spot by boat. Shore lunch beer is at the discretion of the particular officer. Bet on the side of it being illegal.
