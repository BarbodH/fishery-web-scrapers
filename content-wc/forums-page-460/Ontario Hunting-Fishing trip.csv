1362724,RoughWaters,2011-11-03 20:40:00,98,Tomorrow morning I am fortunate enough to be heading north to Ontario with a group of buddies for a week of deer hunting and fishing. The weather looks promising for a good week of rutting whitetail action. Hopefully I'm able to fill a tag then hit up the water for some great fall walleye fishing. Not going to be able to sleep tonight...
