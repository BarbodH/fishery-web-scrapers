Advice above is great-rely on the lodge owners and local experts its a huge lake and everything seems fishy! We did well for bass and pike fishing bays with rock shoals or stumps but it was key that the wind was into them For walleye we did well during the day drifting w worm harnesses and jigs on slowly tapered points or islands. Best spot was an island where it went from 25 feet slowly up to 12 feet At night we back trolled one big flat with worm harnesses and rapalas -quite close to shore between 7 and 10 feet Lady Evelyn is a great place We are trying Brennan Harbour Lodge this year in Spanish Ontario-just to try something different
