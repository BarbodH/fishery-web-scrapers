1339831,rnnonmt,2011-08-12 20:38:00,992,"Looking for opinions on great walleye/pike lakes in Saskatchewan/Alberta area. Any worth comparing to the Mighty Lac Seul? Our annual trip with friends to Lac Seul is possibly fizzling out for many reasons so was looking to find something new to try. The 8 or 10 of us that have been going to Lac Seul for decades may be down to my son and myself. Don't get me wrong though, If my son and I have to go back by ourselves we will...... was just looking for other possible alternatives that me be a little easier to travel to from Arizona. Especially now that Delta is looking to close I-falls hub. Cabin or houseboat/fly-in or boat in package. 7 day trip. Doesnt have to have an american plan either. Budget is approximately $1200.00 per person not including airline travel etc etc. We just want to have alot of fishing action with decent sizes. Thanks in advance."

1359714,sanclemente,2011-10-21 15:02:00,2,"I have fished Reindeer Lake in SK for a number of years (Lawrence Bay lodge). There are no walleye available, but the pike and lake trout fishing are the best in canada. You must drive from Saskatoon to Southend (7 hours) to be picked up by the lodge, but the cost of the lodge stay is very reasonable."
1359836,LeeMB,2011-10-22 12:33:00,83,I believe you can fly direct into Winnipeg as well. Opens up a lot of possibilities for you
1362104,Chris K,2011-11-01 15:58:00,278,"Go to Nipawin, it is by far hands down a much better trophy walleye destination and you have a realistic chance of catching your personal best walleye that may be 11, 12, 13, 14 pounds or more. 16 to 17+ pound fish are caught every year. Steve @ Twin Marine can help you put together a package that meets your needs and budget.Chris K"
1362386,Mike Kansas,2011-11-02 15:04:00,1463,Lac Seul is hard to beat. Pricing is right and you know how the fishing is. Where have you gone on Lac Seul and what time of the year? We may have a couple openings in our group. Mike Kansas (25 years fishing LS)
1362393,Waxy,2011-11-02 15:39:00,2938,"Westjet flies directly from Phoenix to Regina, SK. From there you're a 45 min drive to Last Mountain Lake - the one that Doug Stange and InFisherman called one of the best drive to destination lakes in North America. You can get a hold of the very guide that Stange uses, Rob Shulz at G&S Marinas, and I'm sure he can hook you up with a complete package - boat, accomodations, guide, etc... The fishing can be tough at times, but it's a world class fishery for walleye, pike and carp, especially in the spring and late fall. The other option is Lake Diefenbaker, it's about a 2-2.5 hr drive from Regina depending where on the lake you go. I don't know about boat rentals, but there are lots of accomodations on or near the lake, and the fishing is great for everything from trophy walleye to world record rainbow trout. Of course, last but not least is Tobin, and like others have said, if monster walleye and pike are the goal, it's pretty hard to beat, especially at the right time of year. Waxy"
