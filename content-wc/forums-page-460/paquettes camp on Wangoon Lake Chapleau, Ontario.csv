1350457,jaggersr,2011-09-17 16:48:00,44,"I can not tell you much about Wangoon. However,we fish Windermere a few times a year and drive buy Pauquets on the way back. Windermere sets 17 miles back the same road Pauquets is on.Pauquets cabins seem to be your average at least from what you can see from the outside. The camp sets just off the rail road tracks. The train comes through 24/7 about once every 5 or 6 hours. So if that would bother you it could be a problem. The biggest thing I see different is Wangoon's accessability is much easier then Windermere and there seem to be alot of private camps and cottages on Wangoon so the pressure may be higher. The area is beautiful and you and will not disapoint. Wish I could tell you more."
