1356827,Chris K,2011-10-11 11:42:00,278,"I just spent the last two weeks there and the past week, the fishing was awesome! THey were not jumping in the boat, and you had to work for what you caught, but it was great fishing in my opinion. Even in the rain, the fish were biting good. Chris K"
1356834,hangneyes,2011-10-11 12:09:00,25,Were you cranking or baiting We pretty much only crank when we are up there. I havent heard many reports so any are appreciated
1356981,fulvescens,2011-10-11 21:51:00,1,"Was at Tobin September long weekend. Fishing was good and weather fantastic. Main lake, particularly ""the flats"" was very productive. Pike were hitting both spoons (#4's) and cranks but had good success hanging dead bait as well. Walleye were tough in that it took us 2 days to find them in any numbers. Best success ending up being bottom bouncing with worms in 26' to 32' of water. River was slow and I suspect will remain so until our temperature cools down and fish start to stage up the river. Given the forecast, late October through November will be eye time. Will be back next weekend and again in early November.If you're there try trolling cranks (big ones) against the current at night. We had good success last fall using this method just make sure your plug is banging off the bottom."
1357115,Chris K,2011-10-12 11:41:00,278,I livebait rigged with leeches 95 percent of the time. CK
1357117,hangneyes,2011-10-12 11:45:00,25,"Do you know if twin marine still has leaches, or any idea where we can get some"
1357227,tillerdude,2011-10-12 18:36:00,46,I got some leeches for sale if you need some. There are around 115 leeches to the pound and they are 40 dollars a pound.
1357282,Topwater,2011-10-12 20:57:00,484,Yes we do. Steve

1351060,Guest,2011-09-19 20:00:00,0,Its been tough!
1351726,Topwater,2011-09-21 18:16:00,484,Fishing has been great with lots of big fish being caught. The 5-11 lb walleye are consistent in the river. I've done 2 days of pike fishing this week on the lake with clients and have not got one pike under 33 inches with 10 fish between 18 and 21 pounds. Its only gonna get better as it gets later. Cheers Steve
1352347,Guest,2011-09-23 15:02:00,0,Going up in 3 weeks any tips. spots never been there but heard a lot. Cant wait.
1352383,Topwater,2011-09-23 18:36:00,484,If your fishing the river then come see us at the marina and we will point you in the right direction and give you a map of the river. Cheers Steve Twin Marine Outfitting
1353729,hangneyes,2011-09-28 21:29:00,25,any new reports from the last week or so
1354449,alanexpup,2011-10-02 02:16:00,278,Hi. we were there about 4 years ago after spending 30 plus summers around lake of the woods and lac saul where we always caught plenty of walleyes and northerns. we were in a lodge that was located in the middle shore of the lake and 4 of the 5 days it was so windy we could not get out on the lake. a real bummer. are there resorts in the river section? the day we got on the lake we made it to the river but did not have any luck. I guess as first timers to tobin we were not too happy. in the river section is that where the fish always are? I guess we need a resort on the river close to town and just to confirm you are not talking about the river below the dam are you??? thanks for the info. if we can have some kind of success asured we might come back but that week we caught one little walleye. when is the best time to come to catch these big fish you are talking about? thanks from a one time visitor.
1356513,hangneyes,2011-10-09 20:34:00,25,"any new reports heading up the end of the week. i heard the weather was horrible and the fishing wasnt that great, just looking for more reports"
1356527,tillerdude,2011-10-10 04:30:00,46,Going to head out there this morning. I will post when get off the water.
1356645,tillerdude,2011-10-10 14:24:00,46,Well just got off the water and had an okay day. Our biggest was around 11 lbs and was 30.5 inches which was caught on a crank. We also got a dozen or so that were anywhere from 3 to 7 lbs mostly on rigs.
