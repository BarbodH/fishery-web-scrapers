1358335,Joek3,2011-10-16 19:13:00,244,Anyway know the story of the toll booth just short of the border at International Falls? I was told it is a private owner who simply charges cars for going through his parking lot. Find that hard to believe.
1358339,Skywagon,2011-10-16 19:20:00,1106,"Toll for the bridge, it is privately owned."
1358353,HeHooksHimself,2011-10-16 20:23:00,725,We cross at Int. Falls because of the scenary and the smell of fresh air. it always impresses the rookies we bring.
1358392,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-10-17 05:37:00,235,The paper mill owns it. They have operations on both sides of the river. It does seem unusual.
1358427,wallydave,2011-10-17 07:27:00,2151,"To see the complete shock and disbelief on the face of the ""newbie"" I brought to Canada, at the crossing at IF was itself almost worth the whole trip! ""I guess they didn't consult thier marketing dept, when they came up with this eh?"" Maybe they could the tax rebate money, and some of the proceeds from outdoors cards and licsenses, to dress things up a bit!?"
1358439,v-bay gord,2011-10-17 07:48:00,3168,"Just a reminder if you cross in groups or several times a year...buy the ""card"". It is cheaper and is good for, I think, 20 or so crossings.......use it for all the vehicles in your group. Of course they don't give you this option at the booth, because they are pirates....you need to pick up the card at the grocery store near Menards, or the Conoco station before I Falls (I'm sure there are other locations as well). I agree on the scenery. All that is missing is the barbed wire and German Shepards."
1358443,HeHooksHimself,2011-10-17 07:59:00,725,"Between the newbies' bewildered looks and stench of the IF crossing and their first encounter with Allen at Bobby's in Vermilion Bay, our newbies have a lengthy hazing process. It usually also includes Gail at Pine Grove since we usually stay there on Friday night, trying to hold 30 kmh through Couchiking Reservation (and their toll booth for that one day), the additional stench of the Dryden paper mill (when we used to have to buy our potatoes in CN) and the washboard road through the First Nation shortcut to Vermilion Bay. It used to include the buzz of breakfast at the Village Inn, but sadly that went up in smoke. We have other stuff we put them through at camp."
1358466,jimirjr,2011-10-17 08:47:00,1149,"****, I was video-camming the whole adventure with narration and all... till we got to the booth and they told us in no uncertain terms.. ""we WILL confiscate that camera if you don't cease taking pics."" I jokingly told the Gal at the window that I was directing a documentary on border crossings and needed it for my Masters Degree.Then the fun started."
1359594,MorganMan,2011-10-20 22:50:00,341,"lol.....then you found out there is no sense of humor at the border? Someone has to do it I guess, get the people with no personality."
