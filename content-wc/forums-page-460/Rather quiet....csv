1360783,nitroman,2011-10-26 16:15:00,368,"We have a place on the Mississippi and 6 of us are headed up there for ""man"" weekend this weekend. Mostly some fishing, beer drinking, fish stories and alot of sled talk as we are approching the snowmobile season. I do agree this forum gets alot more action aroung Mar-June time frame and am guilty of not posting a fishing report after my trip for the year is over. I do enjoy reading all others posts no matter what they are it kills time and helps sooth the itch!"
1360088,wallydave,2011-10-24 08:34:00,2151,"Could it be that everyone is in mouring the nearing end of soft water fishing season? Last year we heard from Anglers Kingdom, with a great deal of chatter about those posts, some positive, some.. well.. not so much, but no posts what so ever this season. The Eddie North posts seemed to have taken the heat this year.For me, I have about 33 more weeks until we head North for another great trip, that means I will keep an eye on when the ice starts to form, how much snow, and when the ice off polls are started. Sure beats the polical debates!"

1360135,Golden Eagle,2011-10-24 10:55:00,2642,"A few excellent contributors, with super fishing information, have taken enough shots to make themselves feel uncomfortable with their contributions. It's happened on other fishing forums that I frequent. I see it as our loss."
1360183,vteye,2011-10-24 13:45:00,812,Fishing season never ends just the clothing an gear change. One last camping - fishing weekend planned this coming weekend. Temps in the twenties at night hunting trophy fall gators. Then a couple weeks where I question do I put the boat up or keep pushing the envelop then a brief gap to hard water. Gouin in Quebec ends around first or second week in September so no choice but to fish the local waters.
1360334,troutaholic,2011-10-25 02:37:00,827,"Anyone who has an issue with a contributor, should just skip their information!!! I also see it as a loss and regret the actions of the few that lessens the information that makes WC so excellent."
1360368,wallydave,2011-10-25 07:28:00,2151,"I am on-board with this line of thinking! We have the choice to follow a thread, to post or not to post. I like to hear about fishing trips, the when and where, ""someday"" might come and I can try Eddie Norths, or some other spot that a walleye wrangler finds to be excellent or a word of warning to the rest of us to rethink a trip that might be a waste of time and money. There are enough hassles putting a trip together, why add to them!"
1360408,Bill Krejca,2011-10-25 09:22:00,6107,"It seems normal this time of year for there to be a reduction in posts. Aside from the above comments, there is probably just a little less ""enthusiasm"", as an individual's trip/venture is still somewhat far off. As it approaches, there are usually many more comments and questions regarding what the weather is there, water temp, lodges, mayflies, etc, etc. Also, there just seems to be some segment of folks who ask about a particular place they are going, get some replies, and after returning do not file a report on their experience. It seems there is time to ask questions, but maybe not enough time after returning, to share their info with others, including those folks who contributed to answering their questions. As another thought - those of us who make our own tackle, i.e., rods, jigs, sinkers, bottom bouncers, smells, other rig types, etc, probably do the majority of this in the less fished months. In this case, having a separate section for ""Tackle Making"", I'm sure, would cause increased posts on these subjects, and fill the partial vacuum of posts through the winter months. Beside additional posts, the ""view only's"" as well, would probably increase. Just my thoughts, Bill Krejca"
1360518,mlure,2011-10-25 15:44:00,15,"Got home on Saturday after two weeks at the lake. Had great walleye fishing. Jigs and minnows 25-30 FOW, mostly current areas. One good day of crappie fishing, then they quit. Fished Thompson Creek area and Hay Island. Duck hunting for us was poor. Could have had more birds but we sat and watched the flights circle the decoys. It's not all about killing. Closed down for the season. Hope to get up for some ice fishing."
1360528,Ia Walihntr,2011-10-25 16:11:00,320,"Dick, Now you go back to Wi. and start taking all the Christmas orders for lure parts and probably make more for your component catalog. Hope you have a good winter and will probably see you around the third weekend in May 2012. Take care. Marv"
1360529,TIGHTLINER,2011-10-25 16:12:00,223,For some fishermen the season is over for the soft water fishing and this time of the year guys start to focus on the hunting season looking for deer and small game. Once the winter cold really sets in and most of the hunting seasons come to a end one will start looking for the hard water fishing. February and March start the sport shows for Canadian fishing and once that happens WC will light up like a Christmas tree once again and until then very little will be posted. Just my 2 cents ...
