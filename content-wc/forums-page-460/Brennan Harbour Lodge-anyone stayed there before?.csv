They said that there are 2 different zones one up the river and the other in the bay. They really liked the camp but the weather was bad and got blown off the lake everyday and fished up the river but the bite was not on."

It's really not secluded compared to the other boat-in/fly-in or other drive-in facilities and it really is mostly large bays and islands/shoals...but don't let that fool you. We've been in August and June and caught bass, pike, and walleye -- very good numbers. They do have a slot on walleye at 16.1 inches but easy to get the 15 inchers to eat! PM for more information if you'd like."
