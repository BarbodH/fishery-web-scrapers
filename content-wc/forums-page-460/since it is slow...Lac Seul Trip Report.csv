1360507,tsquared,2011-10-25 15:05:00,57,"It is long, but since the board is a little slow Below is my trip recap from Lac Seul in mid-August. Thanks to everyone for the posts and advice. The majority of the group have done fly-in's, but only one in the crew has done Lac Seul and that was many years ago. Luckily he got old maps which were his Uncle Joes and Grandfathers and his good friend Kevin gave us some maps and tips. Two rookies on the trip, Timmy and Ben. Dan and Timmy are my children. We are picking our buddy Clint up in Minnesota.POST TRIP RECAP:Day ZeroWe are supposed to leave Friday at noon, however, Chandler calls me at 9:50am and is ready to go. I meet with Michael (my boss and owner) and bail out of work in an attempt to get home by 10:30. The good news is Dan and Timmy will be there to help me pack and get organized what, Dan and Timmy are golfing? You have to be f***ing kidding me. My first threat of the trip: Dan/Timmy if you are not home by 11:25am I am leaving without you. Wisely the boys leave after 7 holes and are home by 11am. Everyone arrives timely and we get to packing. Joe backs in to get loaded and reaches into the bed of truck only to find his rod case is gone. Joe goes into full panic mode and is about to retrace his drive and is considering going to get new poles. Chandler would have let him sweat it out a little longer, but knew the gut wrenching feeling and tells Joe he pulled them out. The two vehicle scenario is going to work well and we pack everything but a kitchen sink. Ben makes his first contribution of the trip noticing I have left the burner on low on the stove with Ruth out of town for two days.We depart at 12:30pm but before we leave the subdivision it is apparent that Joe has done little to nothing to keep the tarp down on the truck. I ask Chandler how many bungee cords are being used and he says, none, that Joe said it was a heavy tarp, military issued, and wouldn't move. Chandler and I are not buying it. The tarp is heretofore referred to as Joe's magic tarp. We stop on Clarkson to fix the tarp, again offering bungee cords which are refused. Instead a cardboard box of beers is placed on the tarp to hold it in place. The trip continues and we finally hit the highway to start the long haul. Before hitting the HWY 40 bridge it is apparent that 1) the tarp is not going to stay on 2) the top of the beer box is going to fly off any moment and 3) we are entering one **** of a storm. On the bridge the storm hits with sideways wind and rain. An unwise motorcycle gets behind Joe and all I can envision is the box coming off and hitting the cycle. Luckily the motorcycle pulls off on the side of the highway along with many vehicles as sight has diminished to next to nothing. I am doing 35mph, hydroplaning and cannot see. We pull off on Hwy K to go to Quik trip to fix the magic tarp. QT does not have bungee's and we decide to use the beer and vegetable oil to hold the tarp down. We are clearly off to a slow start and Clint is assured of more beverage time at the MN airport. The trip resumes and we begin to make some pretty good time. As we get closer to 9pm we start to verify that we can reach Cabela's while open and we can get alcohol before stores closed (we have made that mistake before). I drop Ben and Chandler off on the side of the road before Cabela's (I believe vodka has been consumed at this point as Ben has broken his sunglasses and is attempting to fix them, yes it is dark already, and asks if he has to walk to Cabela's, yes, Joe is sitting behind us with the lights on). The good news is nobody has attempted to urinate inside the vehicle yet.Dan, Timmy and I go to get my boy Clint. Stupid Clint had to move to Texas the summer before and the nights on the back porch have not been the same, so it will be good to see him. Early indications are Clint is going to be liquored up. Picking Clint up those suspicions are quickly confirmed  The recap was 10 Jack's and two beers. As always Clint is bartering. He used 8 free drink coupons on the way up on Southwest. Upon arriving at the bar he ordered the large beer and was offered the shot for $3.00 which he accepted. He then asked for another $3.00 shot but is told he needs to order a beer to get that deal. Clint considers giving $3.00 to the person next to him to get the shot, but orders another beer and shot. All the bar flies can talk about are these **** cinnamon rolls at XXXXX? in Minnesota. I have to admit, warm cinnamon rolls sound good. We are 30 minutes ahead of the other vehicle so we stop for Cinnamon rolls. They were ok. Great if you like burnt bottoms and lukewarm rolls, but just OK. We continue the trip and hit the border early on Saturday morning. Day OneAs always the Canadian border patrol are friendly and warm and welcome you to their land with open arms. OK, they are asses every time, but nonetheless, we get through without any questions about produce, no questions about tobacco and they allow a little extra alcohol through. I almost would have preferred that they asked more questions and searched more as I know Chandler's mind is racing about what else he could have and should have brought.We are in Canada. Joe and I eventually relinquish driving in the middle of the night. In the truck, Joe decides that Chandler has finally sobered up at 3:00 a.m. after he request the Who Greatest hits and karoakes all the way to Dryden. I give up around 4am. I wake up in Dryden as we stop for breakfast and groceries. I skip breakfast and sleep in the car and heard that Husky is apparently a restaurant meant to serve dogs as breakfast at Husky tastes like Alpo served to the dogs. We get our 50lbs of potatoes and onions and move out. The LCBO is still closed and we stop in Hudson to pick up alcohol. We are plotting different ways to get on the boat early and convince Steve to let us to the dock at 10:30am. First things first, we get our alcohol. I am satisfied that three cases will be enough, but Ben and Chandler are clearly struggling with how much alcohol to bring. Despite having 90 beers and 4-5 bottles they decide in the parking lot they need a reserve. I am pretty sure the last bottle will not be a reserve, but is more likely to be drunken by Thursday. Chandler stops at local liver bank to purchase a spare.We load up the houseboat and our 14 year old captain is ready to take us out. Chandler tows two of the boats out to meet us on the water and sideswipes the other boats. In his defense, the wind is blowing and he was screwed from the start. Before tying up the boats Chandler notices the fish cleaning station is not attached and goes back to get the board. I give Chandler credit, he can fool you while he pounds alcohol, but he doesn't miss much. We are on the water and it feels pretty **** good. Once all aboard, we get 6 beers to make a toast to our being on the water. I tell Timmy to grab something to toast with and the rest of the guy's give me the head nod to let him have a beer, so we grab another Canadian beer and all toast to a great trip. We start the 4 hour trip up the lake. Somehow while getting everything organized the beds have been chosen for the trip and the sofa is all that is left. I quickly tell Timmy the sofa is his and take his bed, but it is in the hallway and there are no shades on the window. We spend the next three hours getting rods ready and geared up.We go on the back side of the island and start to fish taking bets on who catches the first fish. FISH ON. I get the first fish, a 20+ Pike and the fishing is ready to go. I can hear Cook scream as he lands his first. At that point we spread out and start to hit spots. The fishing is slower than Cobham, but fish are being caught. Timmy bangs the first smallie of the trip hitting a 17 on a transition point. I can see Cookie out on the red buoy doing a little Walleye searching. We join Cookie and begin to bang some Wallies. Dan and Clint eventually pull alongside of us. Within a minute, I look and Dan's rod is bending Uh, Dan I think you have a fish. Yeah, I thought I might be snagged he replied. No, it is a fish. Dan pulls up the fattest Walleye I have ever seen. Just under 26, this is a monster. The debate begins release the fish to grow bigger or keep the fish for bacon wrapped walleye. Clint is steadfast that the fish should be kept. We continue fishing before heading in for dinner. We ultimately utilize other fish for the Walleye Tornado. The menu is Andy's seasoned Fish in the deep fryer and for dessert, bacon wrapped walleye filet - unbelievable.Dan gets the big fish award with a 26 Walleye and Timmy grabs the big smallie award 17. Nobody claims the big pike award as they just weren't doing much. Day TwoIt was hot, sunny, without wind and the fish reacted accordingly. I appeared to have my head up my *** for the majority of the day. Leaving the houseboat my transducer (mounted on a board) came off and unplugged. Luckily for me the board floated. I eventually attached it back on, but just couldn't get it to work and eventually unplugged it. However, there was much cussing and fussing with it in between. I struggled to keep lures tied on and had one of my worst days fishing. I had a simple tangle and clipped the wrong line, watching a new Stanley on a titanium leader fall to the bottom. It was ugly.We headed towards Dewey narrows and stopped at Spider rock. Historically, this is a spot everyone talks about catching walleye on. We worked the spot over pretty well, but couldn't produce a fish (not sure of a bite either). We continued to fish some additional areas picking up occasional pike. Chandler and Ben found some islands and narrows that produced some #'s with Pike between 18- 28 inch. On the way back we stopped at our two buoys. On the second buoy, we finally started to catch some fish. Ben hooked a big one on the walleye rod and played in a nice 36 pike. Cook was not far behind and played in 32 pike. We continued over to the first buoy and hooked plenty of walleye. I get a snag and pull on the rod, which promptly breaks in two. This will become a recurring theme for all of us. Ben catches his first walleye and is getting ready to pose with it when Chandler saves his *** with a DONTPUTYOURTHUMBINITSMOUTH at the last second, an absolute classic.The menu was Clint's Foil walleye with an appetizer of buffalo walleye. Solid.Ben took the big fish award with a 36 Pike. Not sure anyone nailed a particularly big walleye that day. I was frustrated by the pike fishing and wondering if I was going to be fishing with spoons in 30 foot of water to catch them.Day ThreeAfter my frustrations on day two, I think they (Timmy) decided I should be in my own boat on Monday. The pairings were Tim; Tim/Chandler; Joe/Clint; Ben/DanWe headed below the Rags to Manitou Rapids. At this point, I think I finally figured out I needed to turn my other depth finder off for mine to work correctly. The rapids looked fishy. Some fish were caught but nothing great. We eventually split apart and fished some different areas. I headed to the XXXXX lake and worked the weedlines. The area looked great, but I could only catch little pike. I moved into the shallows and had a massive explosion in about 6 inches of water 10' in the back of the bay. I assumed a pike, but after seeing the musky pattern realize this was probably a Musky which would have shredded my Stanley. I worked the whole area catching a few pike and then ran into Chandler/Timmy, Ben/Dan. I went by my explosion area to take another cast or two while they met up with Joe. It appeared our shore lunch was about to become peanut butter and Jelly.I clearly should have followed them as I turned the corner and could find no one. It was raining and the wind was picking up. I proceed back to the rapids, nobody. Up to the rags, again nobody. Back the lake, nobody. I proceeded back to the houseboat, nobody. Thank god my GPS worked, because I'd have been lost 10 times already. I figured they would be looking for me, so I headed back to the Rags. By this point it was whitecaps and wind, with the rain hitting you like needles in the face. Then the battery died on my gps and I turned back. Needless to say they were at the other end of the lake looking for me. Eventually, they headed to Devil's elbow to look and the split up with Cook's boat touring back through the Rags. Turns out Chandler had a huge follow (50+) right after leaving me. Biggest fish he ever saw.I went to the hump and fished for Walleye in the nasty weather. First cast caught my biggest walleye ever, 24.5. Nice fatty, but not in the Dan category. Eventually the boys made it back and were not too happy with me. Neither of us were lost on the lake, but not being able to find each other sucked and wasted time (and the weather was miserable). Everyone regrouped and headed out in the wind to fish. Timmy caught his big pike of the week, a 32 boatside. Dan nailed a nice 36 with Ben in the narrows between islands to the north-east of banana island and I headed over to Knopp island and had my first big pike. Of course while trying to solo net, I brought him out of the water and he spit out the lure. I would have counted it as caught, but within 2 minutes, had another 32.Foiled walleye was a hit for dinner.Dan took the big fish award with a 36 Pike. I caught the big 24.5 Walleye and the 32 Pike to salvage what had been 2.5 mediocre days of fishing.The forecast to this point was right on and we all new that the next day would bring wind and cold.Day FourThe forecast did not disappoint. The alarm went off at 5pm and I could hear the trees shaking in the wind. We all passed on this opportunity and slept in. Chandler made one eyed Egyptians which were fantastic. We eventually summoned up the courage to go fishing around 11am. The pairings were Tim/Joe; Timmy/Dan/Clint; Ben/ChandlerBeing paired with Joe meant we were hitting the walleyes which based on the weather that wasn't a bad idea. Despite the conditions being rough, Joe and I checked out 5 places and caught fish in 4 of the 5 spots. We found a new spot to the left of the second buoy and caught lots of eyes. On the way back we decided to relax with a Canadian pop and troll to the red buoy #2. I hooked up a walleye in 50 feet of water. We then circled the red buoy and Cook hooked up a fat 19.5 smallie. Tim/Dan/Clint decided to head for calmer waters out of the wind. The Pike bite was starting to pick up and Clint nailed his all-time high pike, a 40. Dan contributed with a 36 which turned out to be his only fish of the day as he took the majority of the day off and played cards.Steak for dinner hit the spot (forgot what fish did we had with this)Clint took the big fish award with a 40 Pike, Joe caught the big smallie with the trip best 19.5.I went to sleep early as the next day I would fish with Chandler and we were making the run to Sen Bay at 5AMDay FiveThe boat pairings were Tim/Chandler; Joe/Ben; Clint/Dan/TimmyI look forward to the pairing with Chandler as I know we are going to run and gun and hit some spots. We wake up early and Joe/Ben-Chandler/myself start the run to Sen Bay. It is a beautiful day with a nice sunrise and some fog on the water. We arrive at Sen Bay and are immediately rewarded. Cast #2 Chandler has a nice smallie 17+. Less than a minute behind, I catch a 16+ smallie. Within minutes Chandler starts to do the funky chicken and barely makes it off the boat to shoreline. I consider a photo of the moment, but decide it is a breach of etiquette. Probably a good idea as I am dropped off on shore within 5 minutes too. But we are on the smallies and then .nothing. We go another hour or two with nothing, but then hit a double. We continue to take turns catching mainly small pike. We have shore lunch planned and decide to start to make our way back. On the run back from Sen Bay, Ben catches a very nice 32 inch pike on his 3rd cast with his Red and White Suick. Joe bangs a nice pike in the corner and he gets off ½ to the boat for what Joe will later deem many of his ½ caught big pike.About ½ way back Chandler spots an island and fishes the backside out of the wind. There is an eagle which I take pictures of and wait for it to take off. Meanwhile Chandler hooks a nice Pike (and mocks the Eagle with it), Joe nails a nice walleye and Chandler bangs a nice smallie on the crank. Meanwhile I sit and stare at the stupid eagle waiting for it to take off. Unfortunately, Chandler decides to remove the treble hook by hand and gets snagged. So the treble hook is through his finger tip and the other treble is still in the flopping fish a poor combination. I run up there and place both hands on the fish to keep it from jumping and Chandler rips out the hook. Chandler and I have done this routine before. While doing the hook routine, the eagle takes off. I don't believe it is the first time I say it on the trip, but clearly this is a time when I tell him Chandler, I'm going to kill you.We race back to the houseboat for some Canadian pop before meeting the boys at memorial island. We kept the Smallies just in case they didn't go walleye fishing. Good thing as there are no walleyes in the boat. Cook/Timmy/Dan go out to try and catch some last second walleyes, but no luck. There was some wagering on this last ditch effort and Chandler is thankful since he is tired of cleaning fish. We have a shore lunch of Smallmouth. Clint does a nice job on the smallies and the shore lunch is solid. Joe/Ben; Clint/Dan/Timmy fish a new area by the island which is loaded with cabbage, but in the middle of mine field of rocks. Dan bangs a nice 36. Joe and Ben come over to pimp on the action and Ben hooks a fattie. Joe was left with the broken net, imagine just the ring of the net with no handle. First attempt, the Pike falls out. Second try Joe scoops it and Ben has a 40 on trip one! Really an unbelievable job on Joe's part coaching and snaring the HOG with a broken net. It takes about 5 minutes for Joe/Ben to sit in the boat and settle down from the experience!Chandler and I go back towards the cabin area and work some spots Chandler has found. The fish are in a borderline frenzy. I have no fewer than 5 attacks on my lure. Finally, getting the pike to take my Stanley on a figure 8. Perhaps mesmerized by the visual, I decide to try to finesse it to the net and watch him spit out the lure. I am somewhat sick at this point. For good measure Chandler nails a 30+. We turn the corner and Chandler nails another 30+. I suck. The good news is we are both catching fish and the pike bite is on.We have an early Dinner of chicken breast. We threaten to have a late breakfast, but nobody moves. Three fat Smallies for the shoreline lunch. Evidentially the Eagle has stolen dinner from the seagulls as multiple seagulls are dive bombing the Eagle in the tree, it's pretty cool.Ben took the big fish award with a 40 Pike, not sure anyone hit a big walleye, but Chandler takes the smallie award with an 18+. Day SixThe boat pairings were Tim/Dan; Clint/Ben; Joe/Timmy; ChandlerThe downside of fishing with Chandler the day before is I am a little foggy this morning. The Canadian pop has taken a little toll. Timmy whips up a mean combo of onions and bell peppers, bacon, cheese and scramble eggs. This hits the spot and we put them in the fridge for an appreciative Chandler and Ben. Dan and I head to Chandler cove. I again miss the pike. This is getting old. Dan of course nails it, 36+. At this point I am beginning to think this is one of those trips where I am the netter. We cross the lake to the finger coves and on cove #3, I hook into a big boy. Finally I have my big pike, a 40, my personal best. It is fat, I can barely pick it up and have to reposition myself. Joe and Timmy go out fishing and Timmy continues to bang the smallies, catching multiple smallmouth. Cook finds a nice pike cove but breaks off his line (which is becoming habit at this point) and has a nice follow. Joe and Timmy find a new hump on the south side of the island. Good thing to as the red buoy has suddenly gone cold. Cook/Timmy proceed to bang a 22 and many others. Ben/Chandler/Clint go out and nail the Pike which are clearly on at this point. Ben catches a 30 pike on the red and white Suik making the investment worth it.A local comes up and says, Ay, I guess you haven't seen the weather, but a big storm is coming in. We get off the water and have an early bratwurst dinner with (?), the storm blows through and we decide to head towards the rags. As we leave it appears we have another potential storm. Undeterred, we continue to the rags. Once reaching the rags it becomes apparent, we have a BAD storm. Tons of lightning behind us. We consider hitting land but decide to see what the storm does. We all start to fish.As I take my second cast, I can hear Clint say, had to come to the f***ing rags for a **** experience, I knew we should have stayed near the cabin  However he was interrupted as my slop master suddenly was sucked below the water with a mean swirl. Big fish. Dan grabs the net and the fish swims by the boat. Looks like a 40. He swims towards the boat and suddenly does a reverse 180 flip out of the water. MUSKY! ******G MUSKY! The fish proceeds to jump another 4-5 times and then Dan applies the net. In the background, Chandler is netting his own 37 pike. The fish appear to be biting. Amazingly the storm passes behind us and the weather is great. I couldn't really say what happened after this point. I grabbed a Canadian pop and chartered Dan from here. As we met back at the rags it was decided that I should jump in the lake for my musky catch. Normally reserved for a 50, I agree and jump in. We head back to the south hump of the island for some late evening walleye fishing.We kill the walleye (though I don't think I caught one **** fish-I have clearly used all my goodwill from the fish gods on 2-40's today). Dan and Timmy each catch a 26 Walleye. Timmy is working on the fish pose when the Walleye flops back in the lake. We got one photo anyway. Multiple nice fish are caught though as the fishing is still strong.For dinner we have Uncle Joe's sweet corn flake walleye (next time I will bring sweetened condensed milk versus original), but Cook pulls it off with some sugar.Tim took the big fish award with a 40 Pike and 40 Musky, Timmy and Cook hit the big walleye with a 26 and I believe Timmy catches one of his bigger smallies a 18. Day SevenAlways tough to see the trip come to a conclusion. I request the last day with Clint, so the pairings are Tim/Clint; Dan/Timmy; Joe; Chandler/Ben. Overall we have not done a great job on our boat pairings. Part of this is due to learning a new lake and not wanting to wreck any more props. Chandler and Ben get up early and head out in the fog using GPS to navigate them through THICK fog. The rest of us sleep in a bit. As a 3 time award winner for fishing the most, it is clear Chandler and Ben have me smoked this year. I just didn't move much in the mornings.Chandler says it is a Cobham day as the fish are active and he is setting hooks. Clint/I and Dan/Timmy head to work the standard pike spots but we start in reverse order at Knopp Island. Right away Clint bangs a nice 36 pike. Timmy hits a nice 29.5 in the same spot. The fish are biting. We head to the side of the island and I catch a 29.5 on the Mepps in-line spinner which I immediately regret netting. We head to the remaining pike spots and Clint and I stop short of the main spot and fish a small weedline and, bang, Clint catches another 32 Pike. It seems like Clint and I have caught a lot of fish together, but I am clearly relegated to net status today. Chandler and Ben are killing it too. Chandler stops in a spot and makes 5 straight casts and catches 5 pike in a row. Ben is learning that operating the boat with Chandler up front limits your opportunities. The boys catch 50+ pike that day. We decide to join up with Joe and make a final run to the RagsBefore doing so we head back to the cabin and see that Ben/Chandler are down to their last drink or two or vodka. We know we have to do something. It is decided to replace the vodka with water and put the vodka in a water bottle. Much deliberation is done with deciding what to do with the water bottle. Should we leave a trail for them? Help them find it? It is decided to place it next to the bottle. We join up with Joe and make a final run to the Rags. We catch fish, but nothing spectacular. As we decide to head back Dan informs us he is out of gas. Dan had just learned the day before how to turn on the gauges, but on this boat the gauges truly don't work. Now we have an issue.We tie up the boat and start to sludge back at 7.2MPH with the GPA on. We decide we are at risk for running out of gas and losing the GPS, so we slow down and turn off the GPS which we can turn on after dark. We run into the SWW lodge boat who greet us with it's primetime ay, not a good sign for getting help. We ask if they have any extra gas, but they claim to need it all to get back to their camp despite the gas jug sitting next to them. My guess is they didn't want to waste 5 minutes of prime time helping us and their loyalty truly is to their clients who are paying $500/day. It is a beautiful night with a full moon (in fact there were two moon sightings on the way back). We luckily make it all of the way back but miss out on any last Walleye fishing. We arrive back at the houseboat and Chandler pulls out the bottle and says time for a final toast. They pour the vodka into a cup and make the toast. However, they spit it out all over once they start. Clearly, they have rehearsed this, but it is pretty **** funny. The story of when they actually tried the vodka was even funnier, but luckily they found the real vodka bottle water to have their last drink. Not much of a surprise, but the reserve bottle was needed.Chandler has the walleye filets ready and we are prepared for our last fish fry of the week. Clint heats the oil and the filets are ready to be dropped. However, there are some rocks or something under the basket in perhaps the grossest thing I have ever seen, 5 mice have infiltrated the fish fryer and have been fried. We clean the fryer, but the damage is done. It is much more difficult to eat fried fish that night and maybe forever. Day -1Chandler and Ben get up early to fish, I again can't answer the bell. At 6 we decide to start cleaning / organizing for Josh to take us back at 7am. However, surprise, here comes Josh at 6am, his Dad said he wanted us back by 11am. Chandler and Ben hit the hole where they pulled out the pike the day before it is slow and Chandler is starting to do the funky chicken and has forgotten the paper. Ben agrees but takes one more cast. BAM, a 30 inch pike. There is no net, so Chandler is ready to grab it with his hands. Chandler grabs the pliers and hoist the dog in the boat, nice job and a great conclusion to a great first trip for Ben  catching a 30 on his last cast. Luckily, since Chandler is doing the funky chicken he returns to the houseboat. We tell Josh, we'll be ready when we are ready as he told us 7am and we are not ready yet. No big deal, by the time Josh has the boat ready, we've gotten the fishing boats cleared out. We begin the trip backCook prepares some hamburgers on the way back. I decide bacon would go well with these, which while true, is probably not worth the smoke and ensuing grease fires. We eat, pack and take naps. Chandler is on the roof cleaning out the tackle boxes and rod/reels like the professional he is. We leave the dock at noon and start the trip home.The border crossing goes smoothly. Chandler does not tell the American guards in a vodka slur that they have a beautiful country so that is helpful. We have one rough 15 minute storm but make it to Minneapolis in great shape. As always, the airport is not located in a great part of town, but we stop at the local subway which is in a larger, well lit center, with 2 police cars in front. Timmy immediately runs to find the nearest rest room and we eventually scatter as most people decide they can't wait for the next restroom stop. Chandler takes my keys to grab his bag out of my vehicle. After a few minutes of not returning, I go to check on him and find my car unlocked with passports sitting out with no Chandler in sight. Chandler eventually makes it back telling me I think I gave you the wrong keys uhh, Chandler you didn't give me any keys back. I am standing here guarding my car, as I didn't want to lock it in case you left them inside. It will be my last, Chandler I am going to kill you statement of the trip. It becomes obvious later that Chandler did more than just use the restroom here as he urinates into a bottle in the back seat of Joe's truck later that evening.We drop Clint off at the hotel at 9PM and begin our journey back to stl. Around 2pm in Cedar Rapids we try to make our last stop for fuel. How we could make 3-4 stops with each place 1) not being open, 2) not having a station or 3) being named just diesel is beyond me. At 3am I relinquish the vehicle and we are on Clarkson at 6am as Dan drives by the cop doing 52 in a 45. The officer luckily shows mercy on us as getting pulled over after 18 hours on the road would have been disappointing. We get to the house, unload and reload all the vehicles and exchange pleasantries. 356 days until next year."
1360584,Pikeslayer8,2011-10-25 20:52:00,1460,I'm afraid your mice in your frypot will stay with me awhile as well. Reminds me of the time I was to take the leftover fettucine out with the guts. Found 3 mice in the bottom of the bucket so we dumped the pasta and guts on top of them. It was fun to watch the mice burrow out from under only to meet up with Mr. Gull. Sounds like you boys had a great time. How long to recover?
1360634,HeHooksHimself,2011-10-26 07:18:00,725,"While I am sure there might be comment or two regarding the great intake of vodka and Canadian pop while operating machinery, to the disdain of many, I bet your honest and thorough chronicle is more indicative of most trips than the ""we never have beer in the boat"" crowd. Not to mention the role models you were to a 14 yr old boy! But it sure sounded like a lot of fun. Fish on!"
1360643,tsquared,2011-10-26 07:49:00,57,"to HEHooksHimself, yes, I know we (I) will catch some grief, but this was my trip report I gave to all the guys and I didn't want to change it. There really was moderation while in the boat, different story after dark in the houseboat. FYI, my boys are 28 and 17. These trips to me are once in a lifetime trips which I have been fortunate to be able to do more than once and I treat each one like that.to PikeSlayer8, I won't fully recover until my next trip."
1360679,Guest,2011-10-26 10:03:00,0,That was awesome
1360868,keek,2011-10-26 21:10:00,1003,SO Good! Thanks for sharing this!
