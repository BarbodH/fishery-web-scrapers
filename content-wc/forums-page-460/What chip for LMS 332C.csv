He is looking for a chip that has northern states and, at least, all of Lake of the Woods. Of the three major brands, Lakemaster, Fishing Hot Spots, or Navionics which do you recomend and what version (gold, platinum, premium, promap, Insight, pro USA digital, etc.) would you purchase for a LMS 332C Lowrance. Hopefully, everything he is looking for will be on one chip so the cost won't be so high. Thanks in advance. Marv"

It has ND, SD, MN, IOWA, WI, MICHIGAN and some of the bigger lakes In Ontario. Don't think Bluffy lake is on it though. 9 months and counting down the days to return to Lac Seul! RBF"
