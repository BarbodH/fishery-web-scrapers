1354715,GWC,2011-10-03 06:21:00,1021,"We were there Sept 16 - 23. The weather wasn't real bad, just unpredictable. Caught some nice fish. I have reservations for June 2012. Before then, think I'll head south for warmer weather. Maybe Table Rock or Lake Taneycomo in Southern Missouri."
1354919,jkwildhunting,2011-10-03 18:05:00,361,"Head south for warmer temps your crazy lolMay try to plan an ice trip in march up there if not we are got our June Trip planned for next year, then another mid/late september trip planned.Wish I could just stay up there and live I could handle the cold winters with being able to fish year around almost!!!!"
1361822,Guest,2011-10-31 14:17:00,0,"well I started Friday using my final minnows in the bucket. the boats are put away, so i'm, fishing off the dock, i spent 2 hours friday, 1 hour saturday and 2 hours today, the minnows are all gone and I got my final walleye of the softwater season this afternoon . it was about 13 inches and got lucky since I didn't feel like cleaning it. I hope everyone i met on the lake this year has a great winter and I hope to see you back next year to teach those darn walleye a lesson."
1362378,Moondog,2011-11-02 14:41:00,362,"Amen, Tackleman!!! Stay warm this winter and we will see you May 18th!!!"
1351091,Guest,2011-09-19 21:38:00,0,"was out today and only saw a 1/2 dozen boats, how come there's no one coming out to fish? spent an hour over by perch island (1/2 way between the mainland and the island) got a 16, 15, and a 24 incher then I went to Stevenson Point and got a couple there. the lake has been really churning the past couple days and the fish are still in the 20 to 30 foot range."
1351094,Moondog,2011-09-19 22:01:00,362,Would be if we could be..........
1351223,jkwildhunting,2011-09-20 10:17:00,361,"Yup, I would be there if I could! Glad to see the fishing is still good. I was hoping to see you last week takleman but don't blame you not wanting to come out last wednesday in the snow"
1351243,Strickers cut,2011-09-20 11:50:00,33,"That snow was awesome! Big ol' fat flakes, then sleet/rain, then sleet balls that would sting your face. Turned the floor of the boat white. We were about the only group that left Wright's docks before noon. We got out, got our limit, and returned, fishing about 3 hours. The bite was good."
1351284,Pikeslayer8,2011-09-20 13:39:00,1460,"Yea, bet ya had to pee on your hands to retie your knot"
1351374,Strickers cut,2011-09-20 17:39:00,33,"everyone started with dry gloves, when they got wet we were done in a hurry"
1351425,Guest,2011-09-20 19:56:00,0,"yup, i was kinda sorry i missed you to joe, but i was on the midnight shift and only awake about 4 hours a day and the wife always has plans for me . speaking of peeing, as one of the last posters mentioned. I stopped in the middle the other day for a quick one and the waves were cresting and coming over the bow of the boat. shouldn't have stopped i guess, makes you get the job done faster LOL"
1351459,jkwildhunting,2011-09-20 21:08:00,361,Dont Blame you Tackleman! That weather tuesday and wednesday was something else LOL. Tuesday we were off an island by stevenson point. I just got the camera out to video the lake/wind. We had prolla 20-25mph winds maybe at that time. Soon as i put the camera away it all broke loose felt like 40mph came we lost all our signal and anchor point off the i pilot boats were scrambling back to back we just snuck into back side of a island and waited it out.We may be up this winter ice fishing
1354637,Guest,2011-10-02 19:49:00,0,"it's just like having your own private lake these days. only saw 5 boats today, 1 was my son, 1 was my neighbour, 1 was from golden hook camp and they stay up until the first snow. the other 2 were tourists. we were at fishermans point 3 hours and got enough for dinner between the 2 families. I kept 3, my 2 son's and grandson kept 6 but they sure weren't jumping in the boat. hopefully the bite will pick up over the next couple days."
1354689,jkwildhunting,2011-10-03 05:00:00,361,"Gotta love this time of the year tho up there, and the weather is not horrible cold yet so mite as well get after em while you can!"
1348936,tackleman,2011-09-12 12:00:00,444,"don't know how the smelt population is affecting the big walleye in gullrock because we never seem to see any in our area. I know the smelts were being found in the walleye in the west end of Red Lake. the smelt population was down for a couple years in red lake according to some of the guys i talked to who fish red lake regularly.of course during the fishing tournament I couldn't buy a good size wallleye in either red lake or gullrock, so naturally, a week after the tournaments i'm getting them every time i go out. 22s,23s,24s. go figure LOL"
1348977,Moondog,2011-09-12 13:58:00,362,"Ha ha!!!! I figgered that the report was a bunch of hogwash. I have never seen any smelt in Gullrock nor have I noticed a problem with size. Funny how rumors are started!!! Thanks, TM!"
1349481,GWC,2011-09-14 04:34:00,1021,We're headed up tomorrow. My second trip this year. The lake is very low this fall & I understand that it has been all summer. The weather report is showing a lot of rain coming in next week. We're looking forward to a great week of fishing rain or not.
1349502,pattmit,2011-09-14 06:19:00,36,JKWild...hows the fishing going up there this week? Hows the weather? I'll be leaving Des Moines Tomorrow and headed up Friday AM.
1349581,jkwildhunting,2011-09-14 09:09:00,361,"last few days been lil cooler and windy. Today it has been snowing on and off all morning. At times it was a HEAVY snowfall. Came back to warm up and dry some gloves off.Water temp dropped down to 62degree this morning.Fishing is good. We have got all our fish so far alot of 16.5-18"" which is fine to us those are good ""bring"" home fish. Not much for size so far got dozen or so in the 19-21"" still searching for the big girls.We are getting them on jigs and spinners"
1349646,pattmit,2011-09-14 12:15:00,36,I heard it was getting down to 30 degrees at night. Supposed to warm back up to mid-high 60s towards the end of the week. Looks like we will be wearing our rain gear most of the week. Are you still using a lot of gulp? I have mine packed but always turn to live bait when we get up there.
1349759,jkwildhunting,2011-09-14 19:41:00,361,"Pull the gulp behind spinners. We are using the chartruse/natural, orange/natural and all natural crawlers rite now. Today was the toughest day so far marked alot fish but they were in cold front conditions and had a very negative bite.Finding alot of our fish in the 18-26FOW range. Reefs and Islands are major areas we target."
1350037,pattmit,2011-09-16 05:54:00,36,Ow did the rest of your week end up? We are on the road right now!!!
1350060,seedmandon,2011-09-16 07:30:00,1,I have fished Gullrock for 10 years and never heard of Iowa point. Where is it? Thanks
1350386,jkwildhunting,2011-09-17 09:25:00,361,Iowa Point is over by Round Island. Last 2 days we were up there fishing wednesday and thursday were SLOW. I am guessing by now the action is picking back up since we had that cold front parked ontop of us.Good Luck
1347585,fish bookie,2011-09-07 13:36:00,53,"Gwc now where do you normally fish for northerns we use to cast by gull rock on the break i think east of the rock and in a few bays west of two sisters island but haven't got a clue were to go this year i hear that the weed bed are gone and if you find them they are pretty sparce we normaly use silver minnows and we do seem to catch some nice pike the biggest was 44.5 two yrs ago and a handful of 40's lots in the mid to high 30's but with the weed beds ""gone "" from what i've herd i don't know of many other spot i guess clay banks but we seem to cast for ever there for a bunch of little hammer handles thanks fish bookie"
1347665,jkwildhunting,2011-09-07 17:31:00,361,black n white dare devils have been good for us. We dont really fish to hard for them if we do we hit the channel going into 2 island lake. Fisherman point kicked off some decent ones and we caught alot off a few reefs this July.
1347696,fish bookie,2011-09-07 19:05:00,53,We do use suwicks as well never tried black and white b4 up there maybe i'll grab a couple what size did you use 4 inchers or smaller. We have fished the channel b4 and haven't really had good luck but we are going 3 to 4 weeks later then we normaly go thanks for the tip i appericate it thanks fish bookie
1347708,jkwildhunting,2011-09-07 19:47:00,361,"I use mainly the 1oz black and white daredevil. My uncle likes to northern fish and we dont mind finding some in the keeper range so we mainly target that channel for the 24-27"" ""snakes""!!!I am no pike expert but fishing any of the wind blown islands will produce pike as it seems like they will go on a prowl if its windy so trolling some big baits thru and around islands would prolla pick you up some!Walleye fishing not sure what will happen. If its slow like they are saying its gunna be a stirctly jig bite. If you have a boat with auto anchor feature that will be a big plus IMO. If not you may need to throw the anchor out and just try different depths we were jiggin em as far as 30fow this summer. We would search for fish go back and anchor over the top of them and jig them. They were biting very light at that time so be prepared. BUT we will prolla go searching with bouncers n spinner pulling artifical baits. The spinners kicked up most of the bigger fish in July altho jigs produced more numbers!"
1347719,GWC,2011-09-07 20:17:00,1021,"Hi fish bookie, I would have to say we've been pretty lucky. We taken northerns in a lot of different areas. A lot depends on weather, the time of year & water temp. In the spring (mid June) we find them in 8 to 12 feet of water. We are usually trolling long lines & with 8-10 pound line for walleye. In the fall (late Sept), they're around the same areas as the walleye and in 10 - 15 feet of water. For some reason, windy days seem better. We seldom cast for northerns, we usually troll long lines using baits that have a lot of flash (bandits, cotton cordells, rattle traps). The flats in front of Ranger Lake was good last fall. We had a northern hit a 12 - 14 inch walleye last fall. It let go when it saw the boat. When we landed the walleye, there were a good set of teeth marks on its body."
1348261,fish bookie,2011-09-09 15:55:00,53,We are off to gull rock hope the fish are biting and or ready to bite we will see very soon thanks for all the help guys fish bookie
1348647,dynamite,2011-09-11 08:58:00,20,We are headed to Gull Rock Sep 23. We find the big ones bite better when the lake has turned over and the weather is cold. Does any one know if the lake is ready to turn?
1348808,tackleman,2011-09-12 06:39:00,444,"the temperatures here are just starting to cool down today, it was +28degrees here yesterday, today is supposed to be +19 . when I was at fishermans point 2 days ago the water temp was 68 degrees. so it has a long way to drop before turn over."
1348879,Moondog,2011-09-12 09:52:00,362,"Just want to clear up something and know that you can help. I just got an email from a friend that just came back from up there and said that they caught very few large fish. According to them, the reason is no smelt and all the big fish are dying off. Someone fishing the Fall Classic told them that. Bunk??? We didn't have any trouble catching big fish when we were there. What do you think about this statement? Thanks!"
1348925,jkwildhunting,2011-09-12 11:37:00,361,"We are up here right now, finding water temps around 66-69ish. Today is cooler like tackleman stated, breezy at times with rain so that may cool the water temp off but like he said water temp gotta drop lil more.Fishing has been good for eaters and we have picked up numerous 18-21"" so far. Off to go searchin for the big ones."
1347093,fish bookie,2011-09-05 20:27:00,53,Does anyone have info on gull rock fishing report i'm on my way in 4 days and i can't wait to get to the lake and drop a line also has anyone used gulp minnows or leeches up there this year i've used them in the past and didn't have much luck but i am willing to try them again if someone has had any luck this fall please let me know what you used thanks fish bookie
1347133,tackleman,2011-09-06 06:13:00,444,"I fished the fall classic this past weekend and spent Sunday on gullrock, got a ton of fish, but nothing over 20"" so need less to say I didn;t finish too high up the ladder at the tournament.That being said , the biggest fish of the tournament came from gullrock, a 27 1/2 "" that weighed almost 8 pounds. the team that finished second fished gullrock for the 2 days of the tournament. I went out yesterday and went to Iowa point, put the ipilot on anchor in 21 feet of water and started jigging, I got there at 9am, had my 4 in the live well at 9:10 , it was just fish after fish, by 10am I must have caught 30 walleye all in the 15 to 19 inch range. So I figured if they are biting that great, i'm going to try a gulp leech, I had some of the largest leeches and spent 10 minutes trying that, finally i gave up on it and put on a minnow, by the time the jig hit the bottom, i had a walleye on again. needless to say, i wasn't impressed by the gulp, live bait is the way to go."
1347141,jkwildhunting,2011-09-06 06:32:00,361,"I use ALOT of it. Matter fact I have a bag in boat full of gulp and and a good sized box comes with us that is full of gulp and some trigger x I got on sale earlier this year.Will it be good? Who knows. We were up in July and fishing was TOUGH TOUGH TOUGH. Like tackleman said going have to do alot of anchoring and jiggin em. We were use to pulling spinners and gettin em which we will probably still try pulling spinners but if that does not work out off to spot anchor and jig.I caught a decent amount of fish off the gulp minnows on a jig while jiggin. BUT, I have much better luck when I am pulling gulp or trigger x behind spinners and bottom bouncers. Hard to say what will be working bring it all and if you dont use it then guess it wasnt the bait of choice, If you dont bring it they will be hitin on that!To be honest this was the first year in prolla 5-6 years That I have used LIVEBAIT!!!! It was very hard task to do but when the fish are negative you have to make it look so natural and live bait is one of the select few ways to do that!"
1347199,Moondog,2011-09-06 09:32:00,362,Good to hear that you are alive and kicking up there!!! How low is the lake? Were you able to get your Alumacraft in?
1347274,tackleman,2011-09-06 14:33:00,444,"I talked to the mnr guy in charge of the dam project today, the work is done, the logs are in and the mnr said they are only waiting for some rain to start bringing the lake up.on the bright side, it has come up enough I can get my alumacraft out of the lift."
1347445,GWC,2011-09-07 05:24:00,1021,"Good to know, we'll be headed up there is a few days. My second trip this year. Really enjoy our trips to Poplar Point Resort & fishing Gullrock lake. We've caught a lot of good walleye & northerns over the years. We were there about the same time last year & the lake was a little rough. The waves seem to bring the bigger northerns up to feed. Looking forward to this trip. It's a long time until next June & our next trip."
1347470,jkwildhunting,2011-09-07 07:15:00,361,"GWC,You going to be stay up this next week at gull rock?We should be there but stayin at 5 lakes! Bad fishing or good fishing....I am ready for a break from the ""real"" world. Kinda anxious to get back up and work hard for these walleyes we did pretty good in July compared to previous reports!!!"
1347499,GWC,2011-09-07 08:38:00,1021,We'll be in on Sept 16 for about a week. We did well last year once we found them. We like to use artificial bait. Last year we resorted to minnows & jigs fishing about 30 to 35 feet down for walleye. Northerns were in shallow. Some came right up to the boat & hit what ever we had in the water at the time. We had one 40 inch northern & several smaller ones (30 somethings). They're fun on light rods with ten pound line.We'll be staying at Poplar Point.
1347504,jkwildhunting,2011-09-07 08:51:00,361,"Yea, We were up July fishing was ""slower"" then normal but once you found the fish it was game on. We fished mid lake structure and never had anyone around us all week and we caught alot of fish. ended up with a handful in the 22-26"" range hoping to pull some big girls out. Being a artifical guy I had to switch to livebait. I got fish on artificial but not like I normally do had to switch over to crawlers and minnows first time in like 6 years this has happened!! Time will tell but it will beat working!"
1347583,fish bookie,2011-09-07 13:26:00,53,Jk where is the structre at we must not have good enough equipment or something we normally just fish the boot the rock round island and ia point can you give me a clue where some good structure is on the lake i've found the sunken islands before and fished them and cought a few good one but other then that not to much knowledge of structure in the lake thanks fish bookie i am getting excited 3 days until fishingthanks
