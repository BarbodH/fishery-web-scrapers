We had no problems or issues with the staff, plane or flights. Their web site looks pretty good, and thier rates are pretty reasonable for a fly-in! They had on-site parking, easy to find location. If I could get a few more people interested I would book with them again! Good Luck, hope to see your report next year!"

While we were there, at a ""fly in, only cabin on the lake"", several days there were other boats fishing the lake. Apparently lodges in the area can boat into the lake. The new cabin looks great but there are many nice cabins at outposts. The fishing was only fair. If you want a fly in walleye trip I think you can do much better."

Slot limits have been reported to help the catch in recent years. It would be dissapointing to think you have a lake all to yourself, operators should be honest about that! Anyone else have a report from Northwest Flying?"
