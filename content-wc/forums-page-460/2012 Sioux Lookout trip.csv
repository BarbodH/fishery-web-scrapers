1363611,Downrigger,2011-11-08 09:12:00,60,"Thanks everybody for the replies. Recently retired and plan on spending the summer at Abram Park Campgrounds. Have 18ft. Nitro with 150hp motor. Fished Lac Seul 2 weeks last fall, (Ear Falls area)and except for the wind, had great fishing. Picked Abram Park as it offed all the needs I feel I will need plus access to much water. We like to explore and boating a few miles has not been trouble in past. Do appreciate heads-up on the shute from Abram into Minnitaki. Is there difficulty going from Abram into Pelican? Thanks in advance."
1363640,tv4fish,2011-11-08 11:01:00,2694,"There should be NO difficulty at all You go under the Highway Bridge at what is called ""Frog Rapids"" (The bridge is on the way from your camp heading into Sioux Lookout). There usually is pretty good current there and you will see boats fishing right there."
1359724,Downrigger,2011-10-21 15:26:00,60,"Planning trip to Abram Lake/Minnitaki lake next spring. New to that area. Appreciate any info on lakes. Thanks, downrigger."
1359730,Jimmy Jig,2011-10-21 15:54:00,1905,What are your dates? Which camp?
1359731,Downrigger,2011-10-21 16:10:00,60,"Planning on late May, early June. Staying at Abram Lake Park."
1359732,Downrigger,2011-10-21 16:14:00,60,Should be there late May - early June. Staying at Abram Lake Camp.
1359792,Shotgun,2011-10-22 06:01:00,759,"Fished Minnitaki for seven days in August. Have had great success fishing this area the past two years. However, this year was a challenge. Not only a fishing challenge but water level down two to three feet exposing numerous water hazards. Will not return until water levels are up."
1361078,BenBeattie,2011-10-27 16:28:00,232,"Consider going up Lac Seul at that time of year. That's your best bet for numbers and size of walleye at that time of year, IMO."
1361253,tv4fish,2011-10-28 10:00:00,2694,I will second Ben's advice - for the earlier times of the season - I think you will find Lac Seul to be more productive. FWIW: We stay at the Red Pine Resort and we will launch at Deception Bay and fish Lac Seul almost every day. We kind of enjoy the boat ride
1361311,Cash,2011-10-28 14:23:00,73,I'm booked at Pickerel Arm Camp 6/16/12. I chose Minnetaki because I will be bringing my teenage kids for their first trip to Ontario. I thought the big water and long boat rides on Lac Seul might me a bit much for their first trip. Do you really think Lac Seul will be that much better at that time? (I've fished both several times and I know LS is tough to beat. LOL)
1361316,tv4fish,2011-10-28 15:05:00,2694,"You may want to do a search on the ""chutes"" that you will more than likely be going through for some of your fishing -- There is only one way that you want to go through them - WAY on the west side. If the water level is high (which it SHOULD be that time of year) it's not quite as concerning. What size boat/motor ???"
1362179,BenBeattie,2011-11-01 21:07:00,232,"For numbers and trophy potential combined, lac seul is no. 1 in may, june and into July. Minnitaki is big water too, with some decent boat rides depending on where you want to go. Both are great fisheries and we're lucky to have them so close to Sioux Lookout."
