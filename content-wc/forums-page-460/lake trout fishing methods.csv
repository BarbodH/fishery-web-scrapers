1360472,Guest,2011-10-25 13:15:00,0,"I have become very interested in soft water fishing for lake trout in Ontario in September. Problem is I am a novice. Two methods I have used are deep water jigging with some success and lead core with more success. What other methods could I use? What methods do WC lake trouters use with success? What tackle, what depths, what type of structure, etc. I am not looking for spots to fish just methods to use and try. Thanks in advance."
1360486,Guest,2011-10-25 13:58:00,0,"we fish trout on a lake called pipestone in northwestern ont. Fall time we jig with buckshot jiggin spoons,albino flukes,white tubes or spoons and do very well It depends on the bait in the lake you fish we have sisco,s good luck it,s a blast when there smackin, them"
1360492,wallydave,2011-10-25 14:06:00,2151,"One year we went after lakers, three way swivels, and ounce of lead, blue and white deep running lures and hammered silver spoons worked for us."
1360502,briand,2011-10-25 14:50:00,48,This year we didn't go for fall lakers as the fall was far warmer then we would care for.Generally we troll spinner's like the Gibbs teaspoon tipped with a live minnow over shallow ( 20' - 40' ) rocky shores.But keeping in mind we go in very late Sept and only if it's been a real cold fall. If the water temps are cold this can be the best time of year to fish. Just a note that we fish for lakers in smaller lakes north of Vermillion Bay / Kenora area.
1360782,Curryale,2011-10-26 16:13:00,50,"I mainly fish in smaller lakes in Northeastern Ontario for Lake Trout throughout the season. The main methods that I employ from July to the end of the season are:1. Leadcore Line2. Downriggers3. Dipsy DiversUsually near the end of the season like that I set all of the presentations for about 40 feet of water. Often the trout in the lakes I fish are over 70 - 90 feet of water or so.For some reason I always catch more on sloping basins then steep breaks. Generally I run a gang troll with a sucker minnow (threaded on), or a soft plastic swimbait also threaded onto the line. I will also run a hard plastic swimbait or a lyman lure as it gets closer to fall. Earlier in the year - like in July or August - I have more luck basically dragging the bottom in muddly lakes with the cannonball. I will use either the gangtroll or a sutton spoon which gets off the bottom a bit."
1361347,NMG,2011-10-28 19:35:00,1053,"Haven't fished them here yet (plan to next year when I get a boat again!), but back home in BC it's pretty much all about downrigging. 30-60 feet down seems to be the ticket back home when fish are active, but that said, they are also chasing landlocked salmon (Kokanee) and that's often where the schools are located. Spoons, swim baits, flatfish and plugs are the norm. We don't fish for them in the fall because they are gearing up for the spawn so we tend to leave them alone. Spring time is when it gets fun because you can break out the fly rods and hit the shoals . . ."
1361348,Bigfishhunter,2011-10-28 19:46:00,803,"get yourself some snap weights, handy little buggers for trolling. In the summer I jig, in the fall I like to troll till I find them and then cast for them. Usually I am long line trolling sometimes with weight, sometimes without, and in and around reefs and good shoreline structure."
1361573,SoulFulCry,2011-10-30 11:29:00,158,"i usually use 3 way swivels with a deep diving crankbait like a reef runner , tail dancer, or the new trolls to 20s with 10 lb 832 suffix and i can get them down to 32 feet on 150feet of line ,of coarse this is late sept early oct, i also kid them up with gulp alive 4 inch smelt coloured minnows n the doubled up 3 inch version or trigger x n i do very well, some times if there reallly tough i use big minnows 5 to 9 inches n lindy rig them, usually catch alot of big eyes to doin this n some huge pike hope this helps out a lil bit"
1361584,Guest,2011-10-30 12:39:00,0,Thanks for the replies and keep em coming. Has anybody ever slip bobbered deep lake trout or considered doing this? I bet with the right conditions (calm) this would work.
1361731,briand,2011-10-31 07:21:00,48,In spring and fall using a bobber from shore has out fished guys in boats many times.A nice strip of sucker belly can be tough to beat some days.In real clear lakes many times you can see the trout move up and down the shores under these cold water conditionsIdeally I look for points or reefs that have good access to deep water
