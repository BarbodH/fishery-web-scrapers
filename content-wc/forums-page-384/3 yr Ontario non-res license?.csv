1713345,Glenman12,2013-04-25 08:04:00,762,Ran into a guy from our group yesterday and he said he ordered his license by phone in January thru the MNR..he said they gave him the option to buy a 3 yr license for $150 which he took...they told him he could use it an unlimited amount of times during the 3 yr period..I ordered my license on line in January and don't remember seeing this option..the reason I ask is that this guy is also the biggest BS'er in our group..but I cant see why he would make this up....anyone know anything about this?
1713537,Medds1,2013-04-25 08:42:00,18,http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_165336.htmlThis will explain it all.
1713657,tv4fish,2013-04-25 09:06:00,2694,"He's not BS'ing you THIS time However that is the more restrictive ""Conservation license""."
1713665,Glenman12,2013-04-25 09:07:00,762,ok..that makes sense..I hope he knows the difference..
1714433,Jig A Lowe,2013-04-25 12:53:00,87,Two things I noticed on the links: (1) prices have risen significantly and (2) no financial advantage to buy a 3 yr. license ... other than to lock in the current price for yrs.
1714553,tv4fish,2013-04-25 14:19:00,2694,"It also looks like they ""changed their mind)"
1714817,wallydave,2013-04-25 16:48:00,2151,"The outdoors card is good for three years, why not have a three year license? You can tell the wife ""I already have the card and license, I might as well go fishing!""One less thing to check off the Pre trip list!"
1715937,north560,2013-04-26 05:21:00,53,Yes there is a 3 year sport license costs $239.64 or the 3 year conservation $148.18 plus the card $9.68
1715993,Shellback,2013-04-26 05:56:00,8083,"The license fee goes up a little each year. Does anyone know if they are planning a significant increase in license fees? If a big jump was in the forecast, I might buy a 3 year for the wife and I. But if only goes up about $5.00 a year like it has been, I just go with a one year."
1718825,Obabikon,2013-04-27 05:57:00,2370,"Personally, I think a $5 jump is a big one. I can't imagine them increasing it more than 5-10% on any year."
