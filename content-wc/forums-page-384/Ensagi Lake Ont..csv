Both are located at the southern end of the lake ,a short flight in or a train ride. They have American plan available at both and the pricing is comparable. We're a party of two and rather "" long of tooth"" with plenty of experience re. fishing Ca. Any comments on the lake, ownership,fishing etc would be appreciated. Would one place be better than the other ? No dates have been considered at this time. Thank you very much in advance"
1668521,adempsey,2013-04-13 12:15:00,963,There are a lot of videos on Youtube from this lake and those lodges. Many from various fishing shows.I'd take a look through those. Some even give a tour of the lodge.

I prefer Mar Mac as it is a bit closer to where you will be fishing during the day. The cabins are excellent and spotlessly maintained and have ceiling fans which I found handy at night. The food was outstanding. The fishing for walleye was VERY good and we caught many, many in the 20-26 inch range and a handful in 27-30 inch class. They have many days of up to 100 fish caught in a boat. We did not catch any pike but they do have pike and some good sized ones.The owners are very friendly and will take good care of you. They seemed to be genuinely concerned that their clients caught fish. They took care of a couple issues that occured while I was there and even reimbursed me some of my money because of it- they were were more than fair regarding that.My main beef is the heavy cumbersome cedar boats and the 20 hp motors don't move them very fast down the lake. The lake is easy to navigate.I took the plane in and both years due to bad weather had to train out. The train is seldom if ever on time. The first time we waited over an hour past its arrival time and the second time was over two hours. You will need plenty of repellent as you stand around the tracks and get chewed up by the insects waiting on the train.All that being said, it was a great two trips there and I think you would really have a good time and some excellent fishing."

Cabins awesome, food outstanding, owners genuinely nice, boats 1st class, great fishery (we caught more pike than walleyes last trip oddly because of 3 days of 90 degree heat and dead flat calm water). Trains also never on time as well. Take the plane if you can help it. Would go back every year if not for the price (adds up with kids and my Dad). The whole operation is run the way you expect it to be run. You won't be disappointed."
1681161,10lbeye,2013-04-16 18:04:00,61,PS forgot to add Mar Mac is much closer to areas north. It's a long lake and about 45 min from Mar Mac to north end. Add another 10 min if you stay ay Lodge 88.

THat being said, the lodge we chose to be guests of was terrible. It's the other lodge on the lake. Wally is the owner and he is just downright unfriendly."
