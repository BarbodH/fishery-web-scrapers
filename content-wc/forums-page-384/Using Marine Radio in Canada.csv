1689681,Powerstroke Diesel,2013-04-18 18:35:00,45,"Thanks Musky 101, eh!"
1689833,Musky101,2013-04-18 19:14:00,349,Marine radios work by point to point contact. There are no repeaters or towers. As long as you have a decent anntenae you will be fine.

1694321,Shotgun,2013-04-20 05:20:00,759,We use them every year between two boats. There has been times we've talked 15+ miles apart. We have 8 foot antennas installed. Just a good piece of equipment for safety and communications. We leave them on the emergency channel and if we want to talk make a switch to a predetermined channel between us.
1694961,rnnonmt,2013-04-20 08:12:00,992,How did we all know that was coming?
1695697,kliph,2013-04-20 13:23:00,2337,Sometimes the channels are different than in the US. http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/eng/Mcts/vhf
