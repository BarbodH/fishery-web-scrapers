1712377,stevensinks,2013-04-24 21:08:00,330,Thanks for all the info. I guess I will jut stick with my mono and check ouy the titanium leaders.
1712897,hawg,2013-04-25 06:36:00,2008,Use braid and check out Toothy Critter or leaders.
1713409,MrSimon,2013-04-25 08:11:00,922,Very very few people switch to braid and then go back to mono. It is superior in many ways.
1718985,octanehi5,2013-04-27 07:06:00,1104,"10lb test power pro or suffex 832 ,good casting, very strong, breaking strength is double that. As was mentioned, I tie the line on the spool then make sure you tape it to the spool,electric or duct tape will do. If you do not do this the line will spin on the spool.I have seen pike bite off 30+lb braid,I use a steel leader"
1719017,Dogbreath,2013-04-27 07:14:00,494,Power Pro and black steel leaders for deep trolling gets our walleye and pike in the boat

1706385,stevensinks,2013-04-23 11:42:00,330,Im thinking of putting braided line on my spinning real so I dont need to use steal leaders for Pike. I have used Power Pro on my bait caster for a few years and it is OK but I havent been overly thriled with it. I have been told that Cabelas' Ripcord is good. I have heard the same about spider wire. But there are so many out there Im kind of at a loss. They cost enough I dont want to buy somthing then find out it dosen't work well on a spinning reel or that its junk. So what would you or do you put on your spinning reels. One more thing I want to cast light lures with it so I want to stay in the diamiter of 6lb - 10lb mono. Thanks
1706489,Fred_G,2013-04-23 12:31:00,908,"I have 20/8 Power Pro on a 2500 Stradic. I like this set up very well. I've tried Ripcord and Spider Wire, and just about all other braids. I've found Power Pro to be the best of them. I would fish for pike without a leader. I suggest you try the titanium leaders. They are very flexible and don't kink like steel leaders. I have some I've been using for three years and their still good."
1706553,ftfarms,2013-04-23 13:08:00,444,I two have tried most other brands and only use power pro. Dont really like how any of them cast compared to mono. But power pro seems to be the better of what I've tried.
1706865,zeebee,2013-04-23 14:42:00,1144,"Stay with mono (or switch to braid) and tie an 8"" micro supreme leader on....will exceed your expectations. Renders all other leader material archaic. Braid itself is still susceptible to bite offs:http://www.afwhiseas.com/Coated-Knot...x-7-s/2261.htm"
1706889,packpro,2013-04-23 14:43:00,695,"I moved from Mono to Braid a few years for the exact same reason as you.....Mr. Pike in Canada. They were so prolific one year I spent too much time retying bite offs. Spiderwire at the time was one of the few choices available. Went with the 20# green on my spinning set ups. No problems very happy with the castabilty and the performance. I have since dropped down to 14# high vis yellow. Still satisfied. I have not tried the others, but I am very happy to stay with what is working. One caution in making the conversion is the knot type used with superlines. After tying a Trilene knot for my whole life, I had to learn the Palomar (very, very easy knot to tie). Unfortunately had to learn that lesson the hard way."
1706953,grizzley,2013-04-23 14:56:00,2518,"I have Stren Sonic Braid on a couple of spinning reels, not bad.One suggestion though, don't even think of fireline if you do alot of casting!"
1706993,Burr,2013-04-23 15:01:00,8612,"I use Fireline on most spinning reels. There seems to be lots of good choices in superlines, they are different, more than one is better than another.Spiderwire I tried, did not like how the line core separated from the sheath when tightening up a knot. Never tried any more of it after that spool, I might have been using the wrong knot.Fireline frays a little, but in my case, that's an advantage. When retying I just cut off a section.Powerpro has really good knot strength, which would normally be good - but that bit me. I'm used to fireline, if I want to break off a line, it breaks at the knot. I tried that with my new $20 spool of Powerpro, and it broke right at the reel - with 180 feet out. That was the end of that $20 spool of line. I don't like Powerpro as well for ice fishing, and who knows where the line will end up when I buy it. It seems to ice up faster.I've not used suffix, but many like it.Nano - I've started using Nano almost exclusively for casting rods - but it is not an abrasion resistant line, and it's breaking point is much closer to the lb test than other superlines - I would not suggest this line when you will be catching northerns, without a leader. However, I would use it with a good leader in a heartbeat.You will notice a reduction in casting distance as you step up the lb test. Lighter line will cast farther - I don't tend to use anything heavier that 14 lb Fireline. Some of your answer depends on how big the northerns are. If they are hammer handles, 10 lb fireline will work good. If they are 4-8 lbs, 14 lb fireline will usually work. If they are Canada big Northerns, you need a leader."
1707681,polaris-pete,2013-04-23 19:14:00,343,"I have converted years ago all 8 of my spinning reels from mono to Fireline and have not looked back yet.I use the #14/ #6 diameter and can honestly say its alittle noisy coming back thru the guides but casts well and no tangles off the spool. If I am in an area with pike I just use a Titanium leader.I will agree that if trolling cranks over rocky bottom or zebra musssel waters, you will get some fraying.Just like the others do, cut the frayed piece off and retie."
1708865,MrSimon,2013-04-24 06:36:00,922,"Good advice so far! I use braid on all my spinning reels .... but I make sure to put a wrap of electrical tape around the spool before putting the line on. If I don't, sometimes the entire spool of braid will spin around the spool and cause some issues. I also agree that even with braid, a steel leader is good for pike. Braid is really strong, but its very susceptible to wear and breaking if you are dragging it over rocks. If troll in rocks a lot (like I do) I suggest cutting off a few feet and retying once or twice a day."
1709025,hawg,2013-04-24 07:17:00,2008,"A GREAT alternative to a leader is Toothy Critter, but you do need one or the other."
