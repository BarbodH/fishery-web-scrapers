1693417,pike50plus,2013-04-19 18:44:00,584,Got a dual power unit for less than 300 and only wieghs 1.7 lbs
1702097,elkman99,2013-04-22 11:38:00,180,"thanks for the info. I think I'll just bring in an extra deep cycle battery and hook up to it. Hopefully since I'm the only one using it, it will last me 10 nights."
1704649,Tamarack,2013-04-22 21:20:00,16,"We are a remote camp on Lake of the Woods and we leave our generator on all night. Great for CPAP machines and for charging trolling motor batteries on boats. Or for guests staying up late to cook, play cards or whatever."
1705017,Ogoki,2013-04-23 01:23:00,291,"Last September I was on a fly in and one guy used a 12 v battery and an inverter . About every other morning he put a partial tank of gas in a generator and put the battery on to charge . So while we were out fishing the bettery was charged and we did not have to hear a generator run at night. With the partial tank the generator did not run for hours either. Worked out well. I do have a Winco generator with a Kawasaki engine on it . Puts out only 700 watts but that is enough to run our tv in the trailer and keep the battery charged . It is so quiet that with the tv on, you cannot year the generator running."
1705105,Skywagon,2013-04-23 05:11:00,1106,"A small solar charger would be another thought for charging the battery, they are inexpensive."
1705457,MrSimon,2013-04-23 07:38:00,922,"Solar chargers are great .... but the good ones can be pricey .... but well worth it. I've used a relatively small trifold one (about the size of a sheet of paper when open) that was more than enough to keep an iPhone charged for a whole week of camping .... taking pics, video, making calls, watching movies, listening to music etc"
1710249,Guest,2013-04-24 10:53:00,0,"I have a respironics system one. You can buy a 12v cigarette lighter adapter for it. I don't know what machine you use, but If it is capable of 12v input then don't use an inverter, it wastes energy changing 12v to 110 ac back to 12v. Also don't use the humidifier, the heater in it uses more power than the cpap typically."
1530489,5richards,2013-01-29 16:52:00,131,"For all you CPAP users out there, have any of you come across a reliable solar or wind charger that allowed you to go to a camp without electricity or a generator - or -- do you just carry an extra battery with you -- if so details please!!!"
1530531,pike50plus,2013-01-29 18:12:00,584,I sent you a PM
1530671,MrSimon,2013-01-30 06:49:00,922,"On our last trip, two of the guys used cpap machines. They both hooked up to the same deep cycle marine battery and it lasted them five or six nights. It was heavy to bring in, but we weren't flying and it was a lot cheaper than them both buying rechargeable batteries with fancy solar chargers. If you are flying in, a lightweight battery and solar charger are nice .... assuming you have enough sun and time to charge everything up."
1683257,elkman99,2013-04-17 10:34:00,180,"Simon, do you remember what kind of inverter/converter they used?"
1683401,MrSimon,2013-04-17 11:11:00,922,I will ask and get back to you.
1684681,Skywagon,2013-04-17 16:24:00,1106,"elkman,You might check to see if yours will use 12 volt (I think most will), you just need to get the 12 volt cord. I went to a electronics shop, picked up a plug and rigged up my own with clamps on the end to hook up to a battery when at the remote camp, the cost was insignificant."
1686713,MrSimon,2013-04-18 07:18:00,922,He used a $30 inverter from Harbor Freight.
1690193,Jaskonie,2013-04-18 20:36:00,80,you dont need a cpap machine if your in canada you should hit the hay after fishing all day and snooze all night. The fresh air will be all you need for a week. My brother sleeps with one every night and leaves his at home.
1690705,revitup,2013-04-19 05:06:00,140,"Sorry Jaskonie have to disagree with you on that one. That's how people die. Just quit breathing. if I die on my week of vacation in God's country--I don't want it to be in my bed, I want it to be while doing what I want to do."
1690753,Golden Eagle,2013-04-19 05:50:00,2642,"Yep, central sleep apnea doesn't know anything about fresh air."
