1692377,micropterus,2013-04-19 12:33:00,450,I do not have coverage in Canada.Need a travel policy I think. What is the recommendation?
1692409,@Lunker,2013-04-19 12:40:00,835,"Even if you had it, you'd just be asked to hand over your credit card and then request reimbursement from your primary carrier once you get back home."
1692681,SSH,2013-04-19 14:09:00,526,"I am insured by Medicare and a supplemental policy. No coverage in Canada. I am looking into purchasing travel medical insurance, also. Atlas Travel Insurance gives you a $500 deductible and $200,000 coverage for about $30 per week."

1693873,polaris-pete,2013-04-19 21:14:00,343,Just did a quote and Atlas will not cover you if you live in NY Stae.
1694185,rnnonmt,2013-04-19 23:08:00,992,Yep. Been there and done that last year. My sone broke his arm in Ontario and we went to the emergency room. Paid by credit card 1500 bucks. I was able to make a claim once I was back in the states with my health insurance.
1694849,pike50plus,2013-04-20 07:49:00,584,Medigap plans cover out of area treatment generall different than Advantage programs and HMO vs PPO Advantage programs also are slightly different in regular care vs emergency care. Best to understand all the coverage differences before picking a plan that fits each person needs and premium affordability before picking one?
1694889,JayM5209,2013-04-20 08:02:00,1050,"Excellent advice! Especially since plans and premiums change every year. It's a real pain to do the reviews/comparisons every year, but it's well worth the effort. My wife and I have been very pleased with our coverage since retiring six years ago. Excellent coverage, different premium each year ($0 - $60 per month). This year we changed companies and have an HMO-POS plan at $0 premium."
