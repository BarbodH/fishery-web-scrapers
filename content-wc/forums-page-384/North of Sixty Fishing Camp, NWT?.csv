Recently went to their site online and the prices, etc are dated 2011. Anyone have any info or been there recently? Other lodge suggestions welcomed."

1680265,MidWestFishman,2013-04-16 14:19:00,44,I fished this lodge as well about 12 years ago and found it run down as well with leaking roofs and a dock that was falling apart. Fishing was fairly good however. The guides and handy man told us the owner never kept things up as he should. I know a couple years ago the lodge was for sale but I don't know if it was sold and if the new owner has made improvements or not. I am always leary of someone who does not keep their website current on the coming seasons fishing rates. If they are the same as 2011 he should at least post the rates for year 2013.

It is pretty run down. The camp manager at Flett was very good, but I have no idea if he is still there. Decided to go to a different camp this year on a fly-in."
