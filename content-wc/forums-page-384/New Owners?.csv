1653945,tackleman,2013-04-09 16:29:00,444,"from what the local gossip is claiming, the new owners will take over sometime this summer and have been coming to the camp for a number of years. maybe minnowman will reply to this and give it to us first hand."
1719873,luv2fishcanada,2013-04-27 14:14:00,41,Bill and Maureen posted today that they have sold the resort. Good luck to not only the new owners but to Bill and Maureen too. I started going to Gullrock when I was 14 and have been there almost 30 times. In the 80's I believe it was called something like Steven's and then Horner's before becoming Golden Hook Camp. Even while trying to sell the camp Bill and Maureen continued to upgrade anything that needed fixing. This is truely a great camp to go to. I wish the new owners well and I will see you on June 14th.
