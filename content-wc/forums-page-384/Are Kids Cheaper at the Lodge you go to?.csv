1646337,NY Walleye,2013-04-07 18:16:00,78,Air tamarac has a discounted rate for kids. Bringing my son there this summer. Fly in lakes at a good price in Quebec.
1647145,danforth,2013-04-07 21:52:00,117,"yes, by 1/2 or more depending on how many go."
1696985,Guest,2013-04-20 22:11:00,0,I know Hidden Bay lodge in Sioux Lookout offers 1/2 price for Kids under 18 years of age on one of their plans. They also offer a discount for the kids and wives on their food included at the outpost plan too. We have been going with them for years. They have been flexible on their minimum people requirement for their fly in outposts too. Went once with myself and just the 2 boys and gave a discount for the boys. I highly recommend them. Great operator!
1697785,hawg,2013-04-21 08:16:00,2008,"A resort owner on LOW told me once why they don't promote family business. A group of 4 guys on a fishing trip bring 4 billfolds and them frequently, a family of 4 brings one and opens it on the day they depart."
1698233,zeebee,2013-04-21 09:45:00,1144,I have two kids both over 20 but both still in school so I pay the nut when we go. The key for a sweet deal is to go off peak season which is fine as I prefer mid-August anyway and discuss a deal with the outfitter.....you'll be suprised at the amount of discounts available.
1699297,3M TA3,2013-04-21 15:33:00,2846,"The lodge I go to has them $10 each or 3 for $25. That's for 5 year olds or less. I think the price goes up for older ones. They seem to be a little bit more trouble, hence the price increase. Anyway, I usually get rid of them at our summer garage sale and usually get most my money back."
1635866,Fishoil,2013-04-04 10:49:00,1277,"I'm curious if many Canadian lodges offer a reduced price for children. Does the lodge you go to offer a discount and if so, how much of one? Also, what ages do the discounts apply to?"
1635882,Woollybob,2013-04-04 10:52:00,158,Some do. Usually 1/2 price. Most do not.
1635914,wallydave,2013-04-04 10:56:00,2151,"Nearly all of them offer a discount for kids or a summer family rate of some kind. The rates and ages vary some, mostly 12-teens is one rate, younger than 12 another. If you have a place in mind check out the website, or checkout some random sites in the area your interested in. My son is in his twenties, so I have lost track of the discount rates! Good for you to bring your family North! Build some memories you will treasure!"
1637258,NARDA 1,2013-04-04 17:33:00,636,"Birch Dale Lodge www.birchdalelodge.com on Eagle Lake. Children 12 under stay free on the housekeeping plan, $300.00 for American Plan."
1637346,luv2fishcanada,2013-04-04 17:50:00,41,The lodge I go to has 1/2 off for kids once the minimum for the cabin is reached. So in my case a 4 person cabin the minimum is 3. Two dads and two kids under 18 each kiddo is 1/2 price.
1637642,bigwalleye1,2013-04-04 19:26:00,2632,"Nah, I think you'll generally find, with the exchange rate as it currently is, they just as expensive, and perhaps a little bit more, than the ones you probably already have at home...... Sorry, dude. Friday's almost here and I'm way under my weekly sarcasm distribution quota.!!!!"

1637938,Gregking,2013-04-04 21:22:00,2658,LOTW witch bay camps does half price on kids. Small kids I think are free
1638034,Da' Walleye Assassun,2013-04-04 21:45:00,358,Most fly-ins have a 100 pound weight limit. Put the kid in a duffel bag and tell him to be quiet. The kid gets to fish free.
1639649,fourt2,2013-04-05 11:46:00,45,"Black Bear Lodge (Red Lake, ON) has kids rates about 1/3 of adult for 12 & under, 2/3 of adult for 13+. (Right now, $590 adult, $390 teen, $190 under 13)."
