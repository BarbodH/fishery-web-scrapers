When you get there, ask to reserve the Lost Lake portage trip right away. you won't be sorry.Second when on the main lake fish weedlines for walleyes. If you like an adventure, take a day trip to Wine lake. Dave is allright guy, just not a real go getter. crawler or minnow with spinner. we used alot of both. if want more info just ask."
