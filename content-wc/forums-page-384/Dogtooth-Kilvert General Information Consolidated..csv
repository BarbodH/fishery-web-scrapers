1118770,hoowaa,2009-07-06 10:26:00,6,"I've attempted to consolidate info from Walleye Central threads (thanks to all that posted helpful tips/fishing reports) from over the years (2000-2009) that have contained general tips for fishing Dogtooth and Kilvert lakes. Here is what I have read and taken note of from many participants of these fine pages thus far : - Be prepared to spend some time doing your homework. - There is no ""great"" map of the Dogtooth/Kilvert system. - There is a map available for customers of Dogtooth Lake Resort owned by Wayne and Patty Jones. (http://dogtoothlakekenora.com) - Clear water results in difficult fishing on bright calm days. - Found the best walleye bite was during the evening as the sun began setting. - Fish rock reefs. there is not mid lake ""classic structure"". - Fish the rocks and play wind on all spots. If there was no wind, there was no fish. - Fish Bays that have rockpiles within them. Try the north end bays with shallow rocks. - Find inlets, current and hit them. - Keep moving. - The lake can be very frustrating on some days. A king-maker on others. - They didn't like the sun. But when the clouds & wind moved in they were very active- Friday afternoon we had thunderstorms - definitely turned the fish off-- FYI - My wife and I pitched fireball jigs tipped with minnows at rip-rap rocky shores that was receiving the wind and would catch 10-20 fish daily. - During the summer, the best fishing takes place on points & reefs when the sun starts to go down. - The lake also has a respectable number of smallmouth, northerns & splake (lake trout / brook trout cross). But, be prepared to spend some time doing your homework. - Found the big eye's in the ""cabbage"" ~ 6-->9 ft. They were wacking a slow trolled large ""Northland"" Gum Drop floater (Orange & Chartruese) tipped w/ leech fished about 2-3 ft above a Lindy 1/4 ""No Snagg"". Use the large gumdrop it definitely keeps the leech up there. - The first morning we headed for Weedy and worked that over and did find quite a few eaters. As you said, when it slowed down I went out deeper and caught a few nice ones along the shore towards the northwest side of the bay. Caught a few off that rock pile a couple hundred yards north of the reed patch. - The north side of the narrows going into Weedy was one of better spots we found. I think they were moving out of the bay and heading for the main lake. - The smaller fish were going in some of the bays if one wanted to catch them, but we were hunting for the ""one"". We kept moving and hit wind blown points, the couple of times the wind appeared, and found some fish. - The lake can be very frustrating. the river between Kilvert and Dogtooth (not the shallow one). Below the second narrows there are some good spots to hit. I have one OK map I could find online that labels the names of bays/islands etc that I can email to anyone interested. I am camping at Rushing River Campground from July 19th-August 2nd with my family; my wife and 2 little girls (3 and 5 years old) and would dearly appreciate any tips/maps or otherwise that would help me get my girls hooked on fishing this year. If you care to share your Dogtooth/Kilvert experience with me, I'd certainly appreciate it and reciprocate in any way I can after my trip in a couple of weeks. My email is [email protected], feel free to drop me a line."
1707697,bigtimeelectric,2013-04-23 19:16:00,174,I can't believe this old post didn't receive any comments. I have been up on Lac Seul for 8 years and have been thinking I would like to take on the challenge of Dogtooth. Is there any rapids or areas of noticeable current on the lake? thanks

But every time you feel that ""tap, tap"" you think it could be that 30+ incher on the other line. The map Wayne has is an Okay map just kind of small. You might need to zoom in and blow it up but otherwise a pretty good map. Thanks again for your info. We are heading up May 24th coming home on the 29th"
