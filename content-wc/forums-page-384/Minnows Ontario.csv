1699361,fisherman 1,2013-04-21 15:52:00,39,"As a Canadian and not being very familiar with laws in the USA. I have a couple of questions, Could I legally take my boat to public land or a lake on public land in the USA and leave it there for 3 weeks unattended with no strings attached? Or could I go and camp anywhere for any amount of time on public land with no stings attached? Is it ok to move bait and possible invasive species from lake to lake or state to state freely in the USA? I am not trying to be a smart a##. Just wondering what the rules are like in the US. I do love visiting down South and am curious how these things work there.Thanks in advance for the info!"
1699537,Nimstug,2013-04-21 17:01:00,2605,"Depends how you define 'public.' A lot of water in the US is public but the shoreline is not. Then there's 'PUBLIC' as in a national, state or county park. You'll have to focus on an area and find out the current regs for that area, body of water and state."
1699961,Shellback,2013-04-21 18:51:00,8083,"Let's consider Federal Land, such as National Parks, Army Corps Lakes, etc. A US resident or foreigner can usually camp for a maximum of 14 straight days in one campground. After 14 days, they have to move to another campground. You could basically go from one campground to the next endlessly. But, you must stay at the campground everyday. You can't pay the fee, then leave your site unoccupied. I'm not aware of any public lake where you could just up and leave your boat for weeks on end unattended. Now there are probably public lakes where you can pay a fee to leave your boat. The wife and I like to camp at Army Corps lakes. It's a sweet deal for us. We can usually pull our boat on shore right at our campsite. Camping fees usually run $24.00 to $30.00 a night with water and electric. As senior citizens, we get to camp for 1/2 price, $12.00 to $15.00 a night! I will say that I have never seen any fees that are higher for non US residents at Federal lands. State lands often have higher rates for non residents of the state, and non US residents would probably pay the same rate as a non resident of the state. Moving bait from lake to lake or state to state can vary. Each state, and each municipality can have their own laws."

1701345,Walley Guide,2013-04-22 07:40:00,67,"I don't believe it is against the law for a US resident to ""give"" minnows to a non-resident. My understanding is that a Canadian resident can give minnows to non-residents. Maybe this isn't the case. I haven't found anything to explain either way. I have a few good friends in Canada, but none happen to be game agents. If I happen to see one on my way out of the country this year I'll ask.....would be a good thing to know. Happy Fishin' Walley"
1682137,Shellback,2013-04-17 05:52:00,8083,"I'm a US resident and fish in Ontario. Nearest bait shop is probably over an hour round trip. As a US resident, it's illegal for me to have a minnow trap. If my Canadian neighbor has a trap, would I be able to retrieve minnows from it and carry them on my boat? I'm curious because I wouldn't have any receipt to show they were bought and not trapped by myself."
1682409,REG,2013-04-17 07:45:00,445,"First of all, I'll tell you that I don't know the answer (even though I've stayed at a holiday inn express one time). I doubt that you should be taking any minnows out of any traps, period - whether it's your friend's traps or not. How would you explain that one if the DNR came along while you were doing it? Not sure if your friend can only trap for his own use or if he can legally share/sell to you after he traps them. That's what you really need to find out. But with all that said - I've fished in Ontario a lot and have bought and used probably a ton of minnows (well, maybe not quite that many) - and in all the times I've been checked by the DNR, I've never been asked about minnows, where I got them, asked for a receipt, etc.."
1682441,Pooch,2013-04-17 07:49:00,4619,"We've always had a receipt for leeches with us in our boats, but never one for minnows. Sometimes we buy minnows on the way in and sometimes different camps furnish them. I don't remember anyone ever implying that we should carry a receipt for the minnows, too. Makes sense though. Why would minnows be any different than leeches?Things like this never came up years ago until the mad cow/leech war between the U.S. and Canada years ago. Trying to keep invasives out of non infected waters makes a lot of sense to me though.You pose an interesting question and I'm curious if anyone carries a receipt for their minnows in the boat. Or if we are supposed to.Curious to see what others say or what the law says.Pooch"
1682521,v-bay gord,2013-04-17 08:06:00,3168,"An Ontario resident can trap minnows for their own use. I believe that would make taking minnows out of your neighbors trap, and using them, illegal. It seems using crawlers might be a better alternative. By the way, as a lodge owner, I need to have a license to deal in bait-fish, and must keep records of what I buy and sell. Unless I am a licensed bait trapper I cannot catch minnows and sell them so there are quite a few regulations around the whole bait process. It is even more complicated now with the disease issues in some parts of the Province (southern Ontario)."
1682545,bobbylfishermon,2013-04-17 08:15:00,241,"It would be illegal for you to ""borrow"" minnows, residents, I believe, are allowed to trap12 dozen for personel use, Ithink, but they also have to be careful about trapping minnows in someones MINNOW BLOCK!! The minnow business is HUGE in Canada and MINNOW BLOCKS sell for millions of $$$. I know for a fact SALTED MINNOWS work almost as good as the real thing, hope this helps."
1683849,Bill Krejca,2013-04-17 13:07:00,6107,"So.. A U.S. resident fishes with a Canadian resident who trapped a few minnows. The U.S.guy buys some minners. Sounds like they need 2 minnow buckets - one for each. Or they can put all the minnows in the same bucket, they just have to make sure they just use the ones that belong to them! Interesting. Bill"
1684601,Skywagon,2013-04-17 16:07:00,1106,"A new conservation officer in the Ignace area, was checking tourists this last summer to make sure their minnows were legally obtained. This was told to me by a tourist camp owner in that area. It was the first time I have heard of that, so maybe it's something they have decided to key in on."
1684857,Bill Krejca,2013-04-17 17:08:00,6107,"I've had a bait dealer, some years ago, who I bought minnows from several times (different years) tell me to hang onto the receipt in case the warden asks for it. Funny, never had any camp owners tell me this, didn't even get a receipt when they were scooped into my bucket, as I remember. Almost got the impression from that dealer that I'd be better off buying from him. I've never had a warden ask for a receipt, would have been a long boat ride back, in several situations. Not that it can't happen. I've pretty much given up using minnows any more. Bill"
1698481,Mr.Hayoka,2013-04-21 10:41:00,4,"An interesting question: YES! I was asked once about my sales receipt for my minnows, of which I always ask for when buying my minnows. Never assume anything in Canada. Get the laws when in doubt! Also I was once made to 'walk' back across the border (International Falls) once 2 years ago to take my dirt back to the U.S.A. (where the dirt came from)...as I had forgotten to change out the dirt for the paper for my night crawlers. Then I had to explain to US customs why I was walking back across with this container of dirt and crawlers as they thought I was carrying a bomb!, called into the office and had to fill out paper work of what I was up to..no fine, just an hour and a half wasted time.Also was fined once for leaving my fishing boat in the Green Zone for 3 weeks...that's a no no up there...like Huh?No where does it state that in the fishing laws or the boating laws.. Its under the Land management Act. You have to remember that it is a different country, with different laws, might seem a bit strange to us, but its there country and their laws, so play by their rules. Love the place. I wish we owned it."
