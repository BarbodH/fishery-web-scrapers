We spend time fishing pretty much everything, muskies, walleyes, smallmouths, but I've always wanted to go after lake trout. I understand there are lake trout on big sand, has anyone fished for them up there in July? Any advice or experience you are willing to share? I have caught them on other NW Ontario lakes trolling spoons behind dipsey divers, but never tried on the Winnipeg River Chain. Thank in advance."

1715065,stillangling,2013-04-25 18:15:00,149,Big Sand in Minaki is not lake trout water. You might be thinking about another Big Sand Lake. There are lake trout upstream in Lake of the Woods so never say never but there certainly isn't a population of lake trout in Big Sand Lake.
