We normally get into large numbers of walleye . I like to experiment so when we have had 3 or 4 days of great action I just have to see what all will work. I have found unpainted jig heads vs painted don't seem to matter for us . BUT the tail color sometimes can . Seems like chartreuse , white and pink with metalflake are our HOT colors. ......... Also seems like small tails can also make a difference .I am only guessing but I think the bait fish are so small then that the small tsils seem more natural. On my trip at the end of August last year the tail size did not make any difference . That would make since as the bait fish that they are feeding on are various sizes then. ...................Another thing I had great luck with was plastic small crawldads. Many of the walleye we caught had soft crawls in them so I had to try them and they worked great. Just some thoughts."
1708889,MrSimon,2013-04-24 06:41:00,922,"I've seen times when color makes all the difference in the world ..... and I've seen times when it doesn't matter at all. The trick is knowing when it DOES matter and to make the right choice. Lots of colors and combinations have worked well over the years, but for me the hands down best color of all time is orange. Especially on spoons and the bellies of crankbaits. I think it looks like a perch so the pike, walleye, and smallies love it."
1711121,Ogoki,2013-04-24 15:06:00,291,"Mr Simon ,I am with you 100% on the crankbait with orange belly. . I my thoughts are the same as the orange gives the bait the perch appearance. The crayfish / crawdad that I use on my jigs have the orange underside also. I always look at what is in the walleyes gut when I prepare a few too eat and the vast majority that we catch on the river system that we fish , do have the crayfish in them with the orange underside . Hummmmmm The one twistertail that I just purchased 100 of ,have a brown body with an orange tail. Ran out of them last trip too."

1720417,Moosebunk,2013-04-27 19:41:00,211,"Lived 10 years on James Bay fishing mostly tannin stained and/or muddy waters. For best colors...Walleye - pink, pink/white, white, chartreuse, orange. Natural gold or silver.Pike - Natural gold or silver. Orange, white, red/yellow, black."
1699705,LoDo,2013-04-21 18:03:00,721,"What colors do you prefer in the spring for fishing walleye and norther? Our group is always up for new fishing techniques, lures, etc... Would like to hear your favorite lures for spring fishing? I prefer fishing with jigs, spinner baits, lindy rigs, etc.... when fishing for walleyes. I also enjoy trolling rapalas for a change of pace. Curious on the colors you prefer when fishing in late May early June? Six weeks before our fly-in out of Red Lake and into Woodland Caribou Prov Park."
1699761,Moondog,2013-04-21 18:20:00,362,I don't think color will matter this spring for walleye and the northern will bite on anything dead or alive!!!!! Just wave it in front of their snouts.
1699833,greenie,2013-04-21 18:31:00,87,"LoDo,Are you going to Sabourin Lake Lodge?"
1699873,Ranger319,2013-04-21 18:40:00,166,"Perch, chart, green, red, white, yellow, blue, orange, firetiger, black, purple,pink...come to think of it, you name a color and we've hammered the eye's on it. Each year seems to have a ""hot"" color and even then it can vary from day to day. Get a good assortment of colors, don't be afraid to experiment and let the fish tell you what they want"
1699921,jWN,2013-04-21 18:44:00,62,yellow with red dots lazy ike is all you need. if they are concentrated on an area yellow twisters ot white.
1700041,ftfarms,2013-04-21 19:08:00,444,"For northern pike my two faroites are chrome blue rattle trap and tony rizzo the whizz in chartreuse and red tube with a orange blade. Walleyes I love blue chartreuse jig with blue silver or purple silver or christmas lites 3"" tails I love trolling hammerd nickel blades on spinner rigs or rainbow is anouther good one. For crank baits we troll with hot and tots chartreuse with blur or purple back or solid blue or chrome blue. Thats what works for us anyway."
1700185,LoDo,2013-04-21 19:41:00,721,I'm going to Donald Lake. Sabourin is roughly 20-30 miles NE of Donald Lake.
1705905,REG,2013-04-23 09:09:00,445,"I agree that most any brightly colored jig along with any color twister tail will work at that time of year. Just throwing in a vote for shiny gold jig heads. (I use 1/8 oz about 90% of the time) I've found that the flash will sometimes work a little better than a color. Remember that at that time of year, you'll be fishing shallower so the jig can catch a little more light. And I'm a huge fan of 3 inch curly tail grubs from Dick's sporting goods that look like a chartreuse, glow in the dark color. They come in a box of 20 and aren't expensive at all - which is good because the eyes in early June just tear them to shreds!"
1707977,stillangling,2013-04-23 20:13:00,149,"I must admit that I have never been too concerned about the colour of lures. I normally think of a jig as nothing more than a weight to get the business end to the bottom. I have a pile of unpainted jigs that a buddy gave me. I never hesitate to tie one on. I watched an interesting episode of the Musky Hunter with Bill Sandy that speaks volumes to me. Bill is a legendary musky guide on LOW. Musky guys can get really worked up about colour. Jim Saric was going on and on about colour, moon phase, blah blah blah. Obviously Saric and everyone in his position flogs product and wants you to buy the same lure in 8 colours. Saric asked Bill his opinion. It was classic and I cannot believe that it was not edited out of the show. Bill's response was basically, I tie a bucktail on, wear it out and put another one on. Fish the spots that hold fish. Speaks volumes to me. In most of the mid-west US and Canada, the growing season is short. Fish do not have the luxury of only feeding when the feel like it. Find the fish and they will bite."
1708401,Papa eye,2013-04-23 22:20:00,124,"x2 Most years in spring this is true. If you happen to miss the bite having a selection is good. I pay attention to water clarity. Spring can be stained, coffee color. If so, White curling tails on black head will outperform most colors. If water has cleaned up, then the chartruse and pumpkin tails seem better colors. Usually though, it will be the feel not the color. We took a cocky young guy along a few years ago. I limited out, before he had one. Gave him my (1/8 oz white) Jig, and put on a plain lead head with no tail and half a minnow. Really pissed him off that I kept catching, and he didnt. He was using a medium heavy rod and couldnt feel the bite, I had a UL rod. After I loaned him my rod, he figured it out. Next year he had a new rod. As far as Canadian northerns go, if it moves they bite. Cant go wrong trolling Len Thompsons in any color."
