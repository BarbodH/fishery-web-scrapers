1695353,Andyeye,2013-04-20 10:27:00,179,Our group goes to Cygnet Lake North of Kenora. I was just wondering what did winter bring to the water levels in the area this past winter. We saw extremely low water levels last year especially on the Swan Lake Resevoir. I hope the levels will be closer to normal this year. Thanks for any info.

1696809,rnnonmt,2013-04-20 21:28:00,992,Not sure if this is the area your are thinking of. I saw you mentioned Kenora. http://lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html
