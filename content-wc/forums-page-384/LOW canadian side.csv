With there still being 2 feet of ice in central MN right now I am making a backup plan in case dogtooths water temp is so low it puts a halt to fishing or makes fishing dead.We coultrailer to LOW easily if you guys have any early season tips in that kenora area THANX in advance. I also would like to know of a good public access to LOW in that area"
1706449,LOW1,2013-04-23 12:00:00,2828,"Public accesses to LOTW near Dogtooth would be in Sioux Narrows (25 miles south) or Kenora (20 miles north) There are local LOTW resorts that are closer and for a fee may allow you to use their ramp.I think predicting the ice out date is a real crapshoot, although temps are finally suppossed to be in the 50s late this week. One would think that Dogtooth would open several days or a week before LOTW.Are you staying at Rushing River Provincial Park?"
1707649,stillangling,2013-04-23 19:01:00,149,"I have a couple of comments. Sioux Narrows is significantly further away than Kenora from Dogtooth Resort. 20 miles to Kenora seems too far to me but I have not measured it. Regardless of the distances, LOW can be very tough fishing early in the season so I am not convinced that you will fare any better there if we are looking at a late spring. My advice, for a backup plan, would be to fish the Winnipeg River. It is the outflow of LOW and it traditionally VERY good for the first couple of weeks after opener. Especially that portion close to LOW. It really shines if we have a late spring. There are good launches that are free to use, right in Kenora. It is charted water (LOW chip for navionics at least). The fish will be easy to catch. Normally a jig bite at that time of year but you will want to use meat...leave the cranks and artificials in the box. I love to fish on LOW and have access to both at my door step but I normally spend most of my early walleye season on the river. It is a no brainer. Don't forget the lake trout bite on Dogtooth if you are struggling for walleye. I have not chased them myself for a few years but I am hearing good things in the last few years. You should be able to get them flat-lining at that time of year. Try running cranks or spoons in 12-18' of water as a starting point. Look for shorelines with a good chop."
1709161,Leeches,2013-04-24 07:46:00,106,"Yes I remember it only being 15km to Kenora.I'll have to look at LOW lake master chip and see if that section of winnipeg river is on mine, thank you.We usually stay at dogtooth lake resort or canadian vacations. Only ones to choose from, have not tried rushing river park but it looks nice."
1709585,camp chef,2013-04-24 08:40:00,915,x2 We have fished late May out of Big North Lodge on the Winnipeg many times. We fish from minaki down to LOW. Very good . Very fun.
1710913,Flip Silverlake,2013-04-24 14:12:00,645,Be prepared to fish through the ICE. There is still well over 2 feet on the Minnesota lakes and they are talking about a mid May ice out.
