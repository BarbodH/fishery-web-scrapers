548581,MJ,2005-05-31 10:58:00,11,Can anyone tell me what the duty is on an extra case of beer? If I remember correctly is it a toss up.......US beer + duty vs. Canadian Beer$$$ Sorry to revisit this subject...inquiring minds want to know.
548625,Reels,2005-05-31 17:18:00,2876,"Duty is about 3 cents (Canadian) per ounce of beer, which is added to the value of the beer to get your net value of import. LCBO (Liquor Control Board of Ontario) charges 12% provincial taxes on the net value, Federal tax (GST) will be an additional 7% tax on the net, for a total of 19% tax on the net value of import. Taxes and duties are payable in Canadian funds (Visa, MasterCard, Cash, or Travellers Cheques). The upside is beer in the USA is usually very cheap in comparison to Canadian beer, where it is not unusual to pay $12 - $16/dozen for domestic brew, so the percentages are generally on a lower amount. Keep in mind that some of the more popular American brands of beer are also sold in Canada, including Budweiser and Miller so if you run out and don't want to try Canadian beer, you may be able to get your favourite brand there. <{{}}><"
