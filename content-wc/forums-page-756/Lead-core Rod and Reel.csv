We will be looking for them in 25-55 ft. Could anyone suggest an baitcast/trolling reel and rod that they've been happy with? Cheers, Kevin"
548597,Guest,2005-05-31 12:36:00,0,I Use a Shamano TDR #1903 rod $29.99ea. and Large capacity Penn 209 $49.99ea. or older Diawa seamaster reel. They hold plenty of backing and 2 cores of lead. They work great on Lake Michigan for salmon. I don't think the Diawa reels are made anymore. Good luck on the lakers.
548638,manitobawalleye,2005-05-31 21:11:00,885,mine are a little more pricey penn 320gts and gary roach 7-10 ? telescoping lightning rods 320's hold a full roll 18lb lead and 100' of mono behind another decent reel is the cabelas csd25 holds about the same
548671,Guest,2005-06-01 10:08:00,0,"Go wire instead of lead core. 15 lb single strand wire. put 300 feet on a used bait caster reel. Used fiberglass rod with metal eyes. 2 1/2 oz of weight and a standard spoon or 2 1/2 oz krocodile spoons. That will get you your 30 - 45 feet depending on trolling speed with 200 feet let out. Flat line trolling. It works at the Big ""O"". Lead core works as well ..... 6 or 7 colors with a standard spoon. Don't forget a mono leader (4 foot) off either! Have fun with those Lakers."
