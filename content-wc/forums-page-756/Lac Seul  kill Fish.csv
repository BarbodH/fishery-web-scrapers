548476,Guest,2005-05-27 12:36:00,0,"I am simply offering my opinion, nothing more. I choose to follow the regulations because I know it's the right thing to do, because I want my children (if I ever have any) to enjoy as good or better an opportuinity as I have, and because I believe in the multi-million dollar research effort that constantly goes into monitoring these fisheries and fish habitat and making appropriate recommendations and changes to policy and regulations governing such. I am not hiding behind anything. If you want to talk to me, here is my number (807) 343-8299. I have close friends in both the Ministry of Natural Resources and Department of Fisheries and Oceans whom are always interested to hear about new research or recommendations people may have. If you have some new insight they haven't considered into why this regulation should not exist, I know they would be interested. And you know what, even if they removed the rule I would still kill the fish I intend on keeping right away! Oh, and if I seem condescending because I'm suggesting the MNR and DFO know more about the health of the fishery and the justification for the regulations than you, than I'm sorry but they do! Suck it up and deal with it! I don't believe having a strong environmental ethic and being passionate about the sustainable management of our natural resources is hiding behind a veil of righteousness, but again that's just my opinion."

548533,Guest,2005-05-30 08:47:00,0,"NWO, I don't doubt for a split second your passion about this sport that you and I love so dearly, but I also care deeply and am anxious to follow the rules and help make other people aware of the rules imposed by the ODNR. I trust their judgement . The first thing I do when I get to the launch is ""check out"" the size regulations. The people at the ODNR are the professionals--I myself am a Biology major with a Bachelor's Degree and am inclined to trust the charts and the graphs and conclusions of the scientists at the ODNR. I have no idea why you think I was doubting the ODNR's conclusions and reaction to the results of the ""millions of dollars spent on research"". You just have a little communication problem. You twist a person's words (and your own) better than some of the best that I have ever met. Where your friends work have nothing to do with the validity of your arguments. Nor will I be calling you any time in the near or distant future. By the way, do you have any suggestions on how to keep a walleye fresh in 85 degree weather after killing it ---without ice? (on the 6th day of a 7 day vacation with no ice readily available). How about some positive input on the subject? Respectfully, 5 Stroke"
548540,Guest,2005-05-30 14:58:00,0,"Yes I do have some suggestions, now that we seem to have reached a consensus that the ""ability"" for someone to throw back a dead fish and harvest another fish is NOT justification for removing the kill fish rule. First lets put things into perspective. Though I normally try to raise these debates to the philosophical or theoretical level, prudence demands recognition of the practical aspects involved here. We are talking Lac Seul here. Many (in fact most) anglers on Lac Seul are lodge-based or outpost-based and have the luxury of fridges and freezers to properly keep their fish frozen, be it with regular power, diesel-generated power, propane, whatever. So that takes care of this problem for most people right away! Now, for the relatively few people/groups left over, if you are in one place or it us convenient, a small portable generator and cooler/freezer is a definate option. I have seem many poeple do this. If that isn't an option, slightly more care is needed. Perhaps the most important point, recognizing once again this is Lac Seul, is WAIT UNTIL THE LAST DAY, OR EVEN LAST HOURS OF THE LAST DAY, to harvest these fish. That should be no problem at least 90% of the time on Lac Seul, no worries about waiting to get take-home fish. Any fish harvested on the trip until that point should have been for a subsequent meal and thus did not require freezing. So the only fish requiring freezing is your take home fish from the last day. If you're leaving that day stop and get some ice. If, and only IF, you are leaving the next day will you require keeping the fish frozen. So, at this time, we should recognize how small a % of anglers we are now talking about. The only people which fall into this group are those on trip for several days, not staying at a lodge, not with a generator, intending on taking fish home, and not fishing the last day of their trip, therefore they need to keep fish frozen from their last day on the water until the next day when they get to somewhere with ice. This represents a VERY limited proportion of anglers on Lac Seul. But this limited group may well include you, 5 stroke. So, even for those like you in this very specific situation, here is what you do. Get a GOOD cooler, like the Coleman Extreme. Devote it solely to the purpose of keeping fish alive, or only for keeping things frozen (other meat, maybe cheese). The point is this is a special cooler, your drinks, etc. should be in another cooler. Get large Zip-Loc freezer bags, fill them only 2/3 full with water to allow for expansion without the bag breaking when it freezes. Freeze these solid and flat, possibly adding a small amount of salt to make them freeze harder. Put these in the cooler with perhaps other frozen solids at the start of your trip, and mark the cooler, it's purpose and contents, so there is NO uneccessary exposure to warm air. As well, you want your cooler as full of frozen stuff as possible, no open air to have to cool. This is why the cooler should always only be as big as needed. If desired, for EVEN LESS heat transfer, coat the cooler with Reflectix, on the inside too if you're really worried, and wrap other stuff handy around the whole thing to further insulate, or if you are stationary you could bury it until the end of your trip. Some of the ice will last at least 7 days, particularly if you protect it well and minimize exposure to warm temperatures (i.e., opening it up and staring into it like a fridge). Simply open the bags and dump out the excess water, therefore there will be no water in the cooler-no slosh! So there you have it, for those who actually need it. I'm sure 5 stroke will find some reason this doesn't work for him!! NWO Fishing Bum"

548366,Guest,2005-05-25 15:33:00,0,"I agree cullings' a bad idea but whats to keep someone from throwing back a dead fish and replacing it with a bigger, but now dead fish? And I keep reading about people catching 30, 50, 75 fish a day so what's the crisis thats caused this rule?"
548369,Guest,2005-05-25 16:04:00,0,"It is not a good law at all. I have fished up there for 20 years, most times twice per year. I never seen anyone cull a fish before the law. I have 4 times seen dead fish floating since the law and witnessed it twice. Only a very small % cull in the first place and a % of those fish survive. What happens is that someone plans on keeping it, but then hours later after the ice has melted and they see this old, white, dead fish in their livewell, they dump them. instead, why not put a nasty fine associated with culling and leave it at that. That will stop both people who are tempted to do it."
548377,Guest,2005-05-25 19:08:00,0,"Hey Just Wondering, Here are some thoughts on your comments: ""I agree cullings' a bad idea but whats to keep someone from throwing back a dead fish and replacing it with a bigger, but now dead fish?"" There is nothing stopping you from throwing back a dead fish for another dead fish, just as there is nothing physically stopping you from breaking most regulations, other than IT IS ILLEGAL!! If you have a fish in the slot you get fined, if you have too many fish you get fined, if you have live fish you get fined, if you are fishing in a sanctuary out of season you get fined, if you waste fish (i.e., throw back a dead fish to harvest another fish) you get fined, etc, etc, etc. It's possible to break any regulation you choose, but the simple fact is you are obligated to follow those regulations, as part of being issued a fishing license, just as you are obligated to follow traffic regulations, as part of being issued a driver's license. If you choose to throw back a dead fish you are breaking the law, just as if you leave the scene of an accident you are breaking the law. Sure some people do it, but that doesn't mean the regulation shouldn't exist! ""And I keep reading about people catching 30, 50, 75 fish a day so what's the crisis thats caused this rule?"" First of all, the number of fish caught by a given angler over a given period of time is COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT to this rule!! What would be your suggestion?? Relax the rules until the fishery is in decline, or collapsed, and then tighten the rules back up?? That is exactly the mentality and philosophy which has destroyed so many fisheries. People are catching 75 fish a day; GREAT, lets keep it that way!!"
548384,Guest,2005-05-25 22:01:00,0,Calm down. I don't plan to either cull or dump dead fish. I was simply asking a question. I like to catch fish but generally its all C&R. Not a big fan of the taste of fish. It just seems that the same people that used to cull some nearly dead fish will now cull definitely dead fish. Not sure I see a real advantage. Same goes for the question of what brought this on at this particular lake and not the entire region. Thats the problem with some people. Ask a question and all of the sudden you're guilty of a crime.
548414,Guest,2005-05-26 10:54:00,0,"""Thats the problem with some people. Ask a question and all of the sudden you're guilty of a crime."" Who are you kidding? That is rediculous. I am completely calm. Furthermore, I didn't accuse YOU of ANY crime. I simply stated that if anyone breaks the regulations you can be fined. I didn't say your a criminal whatsoever!!! And you still apparently missed the point. ANYBODY can break ANY regulation they so choose. NOT JUST THIS REGULATION, ANY REGULATION! You are obliged to follow all the regulations including this one!! Why do you insist on thinking people are somehow more likely to break this rule than any other? Yes, some people break the rules, and sometimes they get caught and fined, and sometimes they don't, but the situation is the same for any and all regulations. So yes, the small percentage of people who broke the rules before will perhaps still break the rules, but that doesn't mean the rules shouldn't exist!"
548422,Guest,2005-05-26 11:44:00,0,"It seems that the ability to answer a question in a calm, rational manner continues to elude some people."
548434,Guest,2005-05-26 15:59:00,0,"I remember NWO from last year when I tried to ""warn"" others that might have been unaware of the kill-rule. My buddy and I had live walleyes in the livewell and got a ticket. We were cool on size and possession limits. Posted a warning on this board to help make others aware and got skewered by a couple of guys who had nothing better to do than play God from behind their typewriter. Best thing to is just laugh it off! I printed out all of the responses and still get a kick out of going back and reading some of them !!! By the way, what is a guy supposed to do when he doesn't have easy access to ice? Our camp is semi-remote and there is no corner gas station to pick up ice at. Don't feel like running the generator any longer than necessary just for the sake of making ice so that we can keep the fish fresh. Generators are loud and smelly. Are we just supposed to let the fish slosh around in the livewell,slowly decomposing? How do we keep the fish fresh? Any suggestions? 5 Stroke"
548436,2 DOGS,2005-05-26 16:32:00,361,"I think you have several good options. If you're fishing Lac Seul, you don't have to save fish until the last hour or two before you want a meal. Then don't use the livewell. they aren't insulated. Get yourself a couple of good coolers, some of those 5 day jobs and some block ice on the way in. Break off some ice and throw in the boat cooler in the morning before leaving to fish, it will hold the fish real well all day. Or, run the generator while you're out fishing, you won't be there to hear it or smell it. Perhaps a little risky leaving it unattended but put in a small amount of fuel and it'll shut down on it's own. I personally use an old Coleman cooler with about 5# of ice and I'll throw ice out that afternoon after fishing and the fish are fresh as can be."

547373,Guest,2005-04-27 14:33:00,0,"I agree no culling should ever occur. My point is no cull should be on all the other lakes. We catch so many walleyes on Lac Seul no culling is even needed, if it was even legal."

548296,Guest,2005-05-24 16:04:00,0,"A couple of previous e-mailers gave you some good reasons. Just make sure they are dead. My buddy and I typically just crack their necks. We were once pulled over by DNR and one Walleye was still a bit alive. The DNR guy wanted to bust us, but was in a good mood that day. Whatever the reason is, they take it very seriously."
548301,Guest,2005-05-24 19:50:00,0,They are very serious about the no cull rule on Lac Seul. We had an OMNR officer check our boat and our buddy's boat on Sen Bay a couple of years ago. Neither boat had kept any fish that day (he checked)but after he was done with us he found a 14 inch floater that had been killed and gilled. This fish was not ours. Someone had tossed it after deciding to keep a nicer fish. He approched both of our boats again and came just short of accusing us of killing the fish. We obviously wouldn't de-gill a 14 inch walleye and throw it back unless we were keeping fish. I firmly beleive that we would have been ticketed if we would have had fish in our coolers. This man was very serious and not very friendly. I am careful about following the no cull rule.
548306,Guest,2005-05-24 20:44:00,0,This will get the boat rockin.... Better keep your cabin door locked cause this WILL stoke the fire!!!
548313,Guest,2005-05-25 06:37:00,0,Is there a culling rule at Gullrock?

547355,Guest,2005-04-27 08:56:00,0,"Going to Lac Seul this year for the first time . I heard that all fish you keep must be killed before you put them in Livewell. Is this true and if it is ,why?"
547356,Guest,2005-04-27 09:14:00,0,"They do not want you catching a 17 inch fish, putting it in the livewell, or damaging the gills on a stringer for four hours. Catch a 17 3/4 in fish and deciding to put the 17 inch fish that is near death back in the water. No Culling. I know we all see on fishing Tourneys that the fish are always live and well at the end of the day. I do not think most people use the same care, nor do their livewells operate as well as Pro Tourney boats. I think it is a good law. On Lac Seul, you then have a ""Deadwell"", not a livewell. I freeze a couple of gallon milk jugs and throw them in my deadwell. They last all day. If I decide to keep a fish, I take out my little bat and wack it. With the 30"" fish, I usually have to hit them a few times to kill them. (juuuussssttt kidding)"
547358,Guest,2005-04-27 09:54:00,0,"If it's such a good thing why isn't it a law for all lakes, why just Lac Seul? There is no need to sort walleyes on Lac Seul when we catch a 100 or more a day."
547359,Guest,2005-04-27 10:07:00,0,Its not just LacSeul its all the lakes around LacSeul also. It does stop the culling and the wardens watch it cloosly.
547362,Frankm,2005-04-27 11:13:00,154,I fish on Pakwash in Ear Falls we don't have the deadwell rule. Years ago we used to sort once in awhile. Now I think about how stupid that was. You have a 16 inch fish and a 17 inch fish. Your talking about 1 extra bite if that when you eat them. Not worth getting in trouble over. As you know the conservation officers have no tolerance for any offense.
547364,Guest,2005-04-27 11:56:00,0,"With time, this rule may spread to other waters. It's a good rule."
547366,2 DOGS,2005-04-27 12:34:00,361,"Note Gullrock went to a no fish over 18"" I believe, and now people are raving about the improved fishing. Eventually other lakes will have to go to something similar to assure fishing for future generations. I'd like to see the slot on Lac Seul increased to no fish kept from 18"" to 28"". Then it would truly be a trophy over that 28"". Hopefully they'd take pictures and drop her back in and get a replica."
547370,Guest,2005-04-27 13:49:00,0,"Replicas are better! They look better, they last longer, and you know you are helping the fishery. I will go ne step further 2 Dogs, nothing over 18"" period."
547371,Guest,2005-04-27 14:13:00,0,"The average guy on Lac Seul will catch probably 30 to 50 fish in a day. With the slot limit, you should only keep fish under 18 inches. Keeping fish over the slot should not happen so we are back to only fish under 18 inches. If you want a nice fillet, then you keep a fish as close to 18 as you can. Now when you catch a 17 inch walleye, and you throw it in a warm livewell, when it was living in water 10 degrees cooler on the bottom of the lake. Or it has its gills raked on a stringer. What is the point in keeping a 17 1/2 inch walleye later and throwing the 17 incher back that might not make it? It makes no sense. There should be a no culling law in every body of water."
547372,Guest,2005-04-27 14:16:00,0,"What about all that meat!!!! Nothing is as mouth watering as a 30"" walleye in the fry pan...plus if i was to catch a trophy walleye like that i would want to keep the skin of the beast, knowing that i had that would be better than some plaster mount any day. The big ones don't produce as good of eggs either, not as many as the smaller ones! D"
