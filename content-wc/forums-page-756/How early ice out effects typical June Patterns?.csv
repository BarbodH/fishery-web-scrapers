I've been told that this is the earliest ice out in many years and that we will not be fishing typical June patterns and since June patterns is all we know I was hoping to get some advise as to what types of patterns we might be fishing. We spend a little time for walleye but our main target are the big pike. Any suggestions on what types of baits, weeds, hatches, ext... we should be looking for would be greatly appreciated.

You are correct, the ice did go out early in NW Ontario lakes. However, since ice-out the weather has been cold with little sunlight up until a couple of days ago. Thus far the fishing reminds me of typical ice outs. It improved since opener and I expect it to be very typical for you on your June trip."

Even though the weather was not overly warm during the post ice period, the walleye are well past the spawn, and into the main lakes already. I would look for them transitioning to summer patterns very quickly. Walleye have already been caught in main lake areas. Trolling or bottom bouncing have been good ways to go. If you find them holding switch to jigging. Have a great trip! Agate"
