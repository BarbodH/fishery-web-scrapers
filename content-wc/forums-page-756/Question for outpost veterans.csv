548513,Larry S,2005-05-29 08:14:00,666,Pooch I never have had any trouble putting my clothes back into the space bags. Tell your buddy to get the type that you can put your dirty clothes in and then roll them to take air out. They end up being the same size as when you brought them in Larry S
548515,Guest,2005-05-29 09:53:00,0,An Xtra pair of sunglasses!
548521,Gary_IA,2005-05-29 15:04:00,144,"Sneaker pocket or shoe billfold wr wallet. Mine is large enough to hold a motel ""key"" slide card and/or car keys. It could also be used to hold driver's license and fishing license. The shoe billfold is designed to lace into an athletic or shoestring shoe. You put your keys, license, etc. while fishing. This will allow you to leave the billfold ashore if you want. The shoe wallet is nice when its hot out and you are just wearing shorts and shoes."
548558,jigman 2003,2005-05-31 06:14:00,981,"Another pair of eyeglasses is also a good idea, or a pair if you wear contacts. I would think that there would be some things you wouldn't need from a Quetico trip (cooking gear, utensils, etc.). Other things to add since you are not humping them up hills would be things like lots of jigs (you don't need tons of tackle), liquid refreshments (cold pop is good on a hot day if you are not a beer drinker), definitely a portable depth finder-I have found that fresh Duracells will last a week if you don't run the thing all day long, I personally don't take a big skillet and supplies for shore lunch-always concerned about starting a forest fire and it is so much easier to cook at the cabin, the space bags mentioned previously are great-just make sure you get the ones that have a one-way valve so you just roll them up and the air is pushed out. Leave the car battery and electric fillet knife at home (unless you have juice at your cabin), take several $3.99 specials from BPS or Cabela's-throw them away when dull or re-sharpen them at home. Baby wipes-yeah, lots of 'em. Very nice at the outhouse. Speaking of outhouse-take a can of bug killer like they use in barns. Hit the can with a good blast of spray before having a seat-makes for a more enjoyable stay ;-) A can of extra heavy duty Lysol is also a very good idea."

548616,Guest,2005-05-31 15:45:00,0,"Chapstick with sunscreen in it. Take it from a guy who was smearing the grease off the hot dogs one year. Also, a jaw spreader and a good set of needlenose pliers. A hook cutter is also important."
548466,Larry S,2005-05-27 07:11:00,666,"On Fly-in's I pack most of my clothes in plastic space bag's so you can take all the air out which makes them lighter and smaller. Also only take 2 piece rods which if you are traveling via airlines,you can pack in a large duffel bag with other stuff. Larry S"
548467,Pooch,2005-05-27 07:16:00,4619,"What ever you felt was essential on Quetico is still essential. Some of which will probably be in the cabin when you arrive. Find out for sure from your camp owner what is furnished at the cabin. Extra TP is pretty much a given. One sick guy can really go through your tp supply. Paper towels can be used for napkins, cleanup, soaking up grease. We use paper plates and burn them. We found we really like the Lipton soups with rice and other flavers. Don't get stale and keep for a long time. If safe drinking water is a concern, freeze your ice in gallon jugs for the coolers then drink them as they melt. Go light on perishables. Fridges in cabins sometimes leave a lot to be desired. Sometimes they freeze everything and the next time food spoils. Ezpecially propane fridges. Precook then freeze meats like hamburger for BBQ and spagetti. We have found lots of handy things to do over the years. These are what come to mind at the moment. Email me if you have any questions. We do all fly-ins anymore but have done boat in and the packing is about the same. Pooch"
548479,Atlanta Dave,2005-05-27 14:38:00,323,How does taking the air out make them Lighter? Atlanta Dave

548492,Larry S,2005-05-28 06:51:00,666,"Atlanta Dave. You are right,taking the air out of the space bags as you stated doesnot make them lighter. It makes the bags and clothes more compact For me it cuts down on the space,and makes it a lot easier to pack , when I fly to Canada from Las vegas Larry S"
548498,Pooch,2005-05-28 10:10:00,4619,"New guy on the trip last year used the vacuum bags on all of his bedding and clothing. Worked wonderful on the way up. When we were packing to leave, he had to use garbage bags for his bedding and clothes as they would not fit back into the duffle he carried them up with. The rest of us thought that was pretty entertaining. But then again, it does not take a lot to entertain a fisherman...... Pooch"
548500,IA  DAN,2005-05-28 16:48:00,53,"We take our own gas generator for the trolling batteries and while were charging them up we use the vaccum pack food saver for the fish were taking home.Small ice packs work great to keep the night crawlers happy( we change them out every day).Each person brings a roll of toilet paper for the week.Matches,oil,suntan lotion,2 pairs of shoes(might rain)who wants to put on shoes that are all wet all week.FISH BATTER,cut up onions,eggs and everything else that everyone said.Something we always forget is hand lotion,it might sound funny but after fishing all day and holding onto your line your hands do get afew cuts on them.We always take bottled water and everyones favorite beverage.The outpost we stay at has a generator but it only holds about 2gallons of gas,ours holds 5 gallons of gas and is more economical.Have fun and be safe, you need to take a first aid kit and Tylonal,aspirin,something to make shXt and something to stop you from shixxing. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."
548501,515,2005-05-28 17:20:00,254,Great lists so far guys. Here are a few things we add to the list. Sorry if I repeat any ideas. GMRS radios to keep in contact with others and share info as we find the hotspots. Handy mans best friend....duct tape. If you can get maps of the lake from the outfitter before trip we laminate them and tape on the boat seat in front of driver to make navagating the lake easier. Definitly portable fishfinders if you have them. Good Luck Mike

548393,Guest,2005-05-26 06:43:00,0,What are some of the little items that are easy to forget (or never think of to begin with) that can prove invaluable on an outpost trip where supply runs are not an option? Thx

548433,phishfearme,2005-05-26 15:45:00,1242,"first and formost: an electric fillet knife with deep draw car battery. secondly, a good heavy anchor (or you can do the basketball net thing, see posting). and third, every lure, rod/reel and piece of lead you own. this ain't that funny if you have to haul it up a portage for a customer. some other more useful items: swim mask and snorkel (mine has paid for itself already), a half gallon plastic milk carton with cap on and bottom cut off stuffed with a sponge, rod holders made with a 2 1/2 ft lengths of 1 1/4 inch plastic pipe and drilled with numerous holes to be wired to wherever you can in the boat, marker buoy, new batteries in your sounder, put your toilet paper into a zip lock plastic bag (ever try to use very moist t-paper?), the thickest garbage bags you can find, spatula and turner (we NEVER assume the cabin has one), two old towels, a hot glove for handling hot plates, plastic measuring cups/spoons, funnel, small flashlight, knapsack (for portages), a small tackle box (for portages), Dramamine, and finally  the best raingear you can find.

548456,Gary_IA,2005-05-27 05:46:00,144,"If you are walking your gear into a lake keep it light. In lieu of an electric knife, you want a decent filet knife that sharpens easily. I like rice and...in the foil packets by Lipton or other companies, just add liquid and cook. Chicken or beef granules if weight is an issue. Chicken broth, tomato paste as a base for soup boating or flying in. Maybe a portable grate or Coleman stove and a shore lunch kit-if you don't have to portage it. A water bottle and maybe a water filtration system if there is a health question about drinking the water. I carry toilet paper in a resealable bag. Check about life preservers-are they supplied by the outfitter? A decent cheap net that you don't losing or a quality foldup net that you won't forget. (Resort nets often leave much to be desired) Maybe one of those rubberized gloves with grit that are used for landing fish. I also like the waterproof bags for some towels, jacket sweatshirt. A throwline kit in case someone goes overboard-I think Canada may require one nowadays."
548462,Guest,2005-05-27 06:47:00,0,"Okay, maybe I'm dense, but you are kidding about the every rod, reel, piece of lead, and lure I own, right? I've taken my standard ""Quetico allotment"" and doubled it (okay, maybe 2.5X, but it's a drive up - boat in - no portage deal to get to the base camp). However, since I'm conditioned to packing lean for the park, maybe I'm being too frugal with weight. It's not like I have to hump all the stuff around with me everywhere I go once we get there."
