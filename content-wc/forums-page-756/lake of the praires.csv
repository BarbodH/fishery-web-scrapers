We fish mostly walleye with a couple of half days of northerns. We are considering July, but are open to suggestions as to the best time to fish the lake, we do not want to hit the lake on a may fly hatch if it can be avoided. Any particular patterns, methods, or areas of the lake to fish. How large of a body of water is it. Any help would be appreciated. We might consider a guide if anyone has any they would reccomend. Thanks in advance Brian Thomas"

I have a friend that is a guide on LOTP, he'd kill me for this, but you don't need a guide if you have a general idea of the lake. I've fished it lots. Used to have a seasonal camp site there for a number of years. W5"

We had Hank Parkers Outdoor Magazine out last summer to shoot a show on ""Canadian Walleyes"" OLNTV. In fact, you dont have to bother hauling your boat up here, we will take care of you, www.stickysbaitandtackle.com"
