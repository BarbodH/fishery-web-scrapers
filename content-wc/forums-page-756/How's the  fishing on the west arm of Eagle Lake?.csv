548551,fishmaster,2005-05-30 18:17:00,209,Larry Just got back from Vermilion Bay Lodge pike fishing can be good. Gord who owns the camp will help you he and his wife and son Mike are really great. I am sure he will point you and your family in the direction to where the fish are at the time you get there. Yes the lake can get rough but with any normal wind you will not have a problem. Ask for a marked map and he will give you one. Good Luck !!!!!!!!!

548496,Guest,2005-05-28 08:12:00,0,Any walleye reports? or fishing in general? Thanks..
548517,grt1,2005-05-29 10:39:00,259,"I just spent opening weekend on the west arm, It was poor fishing to say the least, I caught 1- 6 inch walleye and lost a big, really big northern, but in 5 days of fishing that was all I got, the group I was with went into the smaller lakes for trout and they made out ok, 6 trout in 2 hours, but I only saw, 3 walleyes caught on the west arm. my buddy got one that was 14 inches and a neighbour got 2 but they were over the slot size. at the resort next to where we stayed the report from the guides were the same. they were getting limits in the lakes they fly into but were taking guests to smaller lakes for northerns. nearly no fish were coming in to camp off the west arm. that said, it was raining for 7 days straight and it was just crappy fishing weather, so how hard do you try when you are wet and cold?"
548519,Guest,2005-05-29 13:24:00,0,Sorry to hear about opening week. Sounds like the weather was quite a factor. Our group is from Iowa and is headed up June 4th and hoping for better fishing. Our experience has been that the portage lakes usually produce better than Eagle. Have you been going to Kimberley's for quite awhile? What portage lakes were you on?
548531,chaim52,2005-05-30 08:18:00,8,Avoid Eagle Lake at all cost. I would never go there.
548536,Guest,2005-05-30 10:54:00,0,WHY?
548539,Guest,2005-05-30 14:44:00,0,"I am also heading up to Eagle 6/4 through 6/12 and plan to fish the area of the lake near Blind Bay and the Viking reef and would also like to hear why you feel Eagle should be avoided. Is it a matter of insufficient size of fish or are they just non-existent compared to other similar Ontario lakes. I have only fished the lake one day myself back in the late 80's, but did manage to catch a number of smallmouth and northerns despite a temperature above 90 as I recall. My dad fished the lake extensively when he was young in the 50's and from all of the old slides and stories I have heard over the years it certainly once rivaled the kind of fishing I hear about from Lac Seul today. What kind of fishery is Eagle Lake today? Should I expect to be disappointed compared to fishing the Minnosota part of LOTW or other northern Minnosota lakes, where I have done most of my walleye and northern fishing the past twenty years? Any other fishing reports since the opener would be most appreciated. Dave"
548541,fishmaster,2005-05-30 15:35:00,209,"In response to Chaim52,Maybe you just have not fished the lake with any success it is your own opinion on don't fish Eagle lake. I myself have fished Eagle Lake on the North end and South end, I can say the South end has great musky fishing and up in till the last 6 years have been fishing out of Vermilion Bay and the first year was a learning curve but I can say we have learned and learned well from others and I think the lake has a lot to offer. It show size for the musky and and have seen over the last couple of years the walleye size has gotten bigger in fact at times have seen it hard to get under slot size walleye. Lake trout fishing out of Vermilion Bay in the spring offers some of the best and size is no problem. You also have to remember that you can portage to many lakes from Eagle and the fishing on those lakes can be awsome. Talk to your camp owner for info when you go is all I can tell you they will be more than willing to help you out. We just got back from Vermilion Bay Lodge on Saturday and besides the weather which we have no control over fishing was good when you could handle mother nature."
548542,BB,2005-05-30 15:36:00,15,"You will see many people bash Eagle on various boards. I have not missed a year for the past 25 years and the fishing today is fantastic. It's fine with me if everyone goes further north to Lac Suel. Sure you may not catch 100 fish in one day like Lac Suel or some fly in lakes, but I have had a number of 50 fish days on the lake. Last year caught two 31 inchers in one day so the size is there. Biggest ever to come in my boat was a 13 3/4 pounder 4 years ago. It can be a difficult lake to fish, but if you find them, fishing is great. Don't fish in one spot too long if your not catching anything. Many times fish are on a spot for a day or two and then completly gone. Good Luck!"
548543,fishmaster,2005-05-30 15:39:00,209,BB very well put if you can't get them to hit move on to another spot. That is one problem lot of guys have is they sit till the spider webs start. Eagle is a very big body of water you just have to learn to adjust to the conditions or try new things.
548545,Guest,2005-05-30 16:03:00,0,"What is the northern pike fishing like at eagle lake? Will be staying at vermilion bay lodge in july with the family. Just from looking at the map it looks like that bay could get rough when windy? Anyway, the owner seems like a good guy from talking to him, and the kids can't wait to see their cabins with the wooden furniture. And i can't wait to chase the muskies that i here so much about in eagle lake. One month to wait :) Larry"
