548686,Guest,2005-06-01 13:29:00,0,"Not sure who is going on your trip. If it is your family, look for resorts that have family plans where one kid is free or very cheap for every paying adult. Last year, I spent a week at Barber's resort in Minaki. Caught a lot of Walleye (biggest for week was 26"")and a lot of smallmouth and had the biggest musky follow of my life. The resort needed a little clearing of overgrown trees and bushes, but the inside of the cabin was very nice, and clean. 2 refrigerators plus a deep freezer, and cable TV. We brought our own boats, and we only paid about $230 to $250 per person. It was very cheap as far as Canadian resorts go, and in lousy weather, we did well fishing. I prefer Lac Seul, but if I was adding an extra trip up to Canada and could not afford Lac Seul, I would go to Barber's again."
548698,Guest,2005-06-01 22:12:00,0,"There are deals out there if you search for them. In the case of my lodge it depends on the type of trip... prices start low if you bring your own boat, and are basically responsible for your own fishing... up to a higher price trip where I take your gear into a bush lake each day of the week if you choose. We also offer a discount to those who get a conservation license, and do offer discounts on kids with each paying adult. Housekeeping packages will surely save you money. I always preferred them myself. When on vacation I'd rather be on my schedule, not someone elses. There are deals, you just have to search for them. Have a great trip. Agate"
548714,Guest,2005-06-02 08:01:00,0,"thx for all the feedback guys...i appreciate it. i realize that there are better deals out there, its just disheartening because the ""canadian experience"" that i've grown to know and love is centered around this particular resort. Thx for all the great info and advice!"
548715,Guest,2005-06-02 08:06:00,0,There is a fly in service out of Knobby's in sioux lookout that a lot if not most of the lodges use in the area. i have heard that if you go directly to the fly in service to purchase your air directly it is a better deal than through an outfitter who packages the price. they also have good grub there too.
548617,Guest,2005-05-31 15:55:00,0,"what deals are out there for canadian fishing trips (not necessarily flyins) and what cost-saving ideas have other fishermen found over the years? we're looking at doing a number of things this year such as bringing in our own boat gas, taking more food up, etc. the resort where we have gone for 20 years has been steadily increasing her housekeeping package rates. this year it is another 10% over last year...seemingly unjustified 30% in the last 3 years. no change in services, no boat/motor upgrade, no major remodeling to the cabins. inflation hasn't been 10% in either the US or Canadian economy for quite some time, and another 10% and i'm feeling the pinch, much more and i'll be starved out. not trying to complain...just needing answers or i'll do something desparate like only go 2X instead of 3X per year, need some fresh ideas."

548624,Reels,2005-05-31 17:12:00,2876,"Sorry I did not answer your main question. You can save a lot of money bringing your own boat, and cooking your own food. It can be fun, and make the bonding with your fellow fisherman a better experience. (You also get to find out who are the lazy ones, me included) One thing we do is have everyone bring up a meal for a day, and we each bring a steak for steaks on the grill one day. Food is about 40-80 bucks a head and we eat like kings. You also pick the time you eat, which is very nice, not having to be back at a specified time. Keep one thing in mind though, it is also a lot more work. When your boat breaks up there, it is your boat, and it sucks being on the dock rewiring something after it has rained for three days straight. So there is a trade off. <{{}}><"
548626,Trailerguy,2005-05-31 17:33:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Running a resort is just like any other business. Is it a smooth running operation? Are they booked full? If the client base will support the rate increase they'd be folish not to raise it. Every business owner needs an exit plan, most businesses will be sold someday. The client base is one of the businesses assets, just like the cabins. If the new owner is going to be able to make payments, and a living at the same time, the fee schedule has to support it. You can't buy a business and then double the prices and expect the clients to stay, it has to be done on an annual basis. The largest money saver I've found was buying my own cottage. The annual taxes and upkeep cost about the same as 1 week long trip to camp did ten years ago, while the property value on the cottage has increased dramatically. The down side is that work days on the cottage and fishing days compete for your time."
548646,Guest,2005-06-01 05:24:00,0,"We saw the same thing happening and picked up a cottage of our own about 7 years ago. just in the past few, as taxes and insurance have beeen going up we have been renting to many in the same boat. in talking to our renters that are quite seasoned canadianites, they have been staying at the hotels in town as well as other private cabins for rent. let me know what areas you are going to and i might be able to steer you in the right direction. dont get me wrong, most of the lodges provide a great service and incredible canadian fishing experience for those looking to show up and step right in. i have good working relationships with quite a few of them where my place is at, but when they get full or when certain clientele of theirs can no longer afford the tabs, there are options. i still buy all my supplies, groceries, etc.. up there except for bulk items from the warehouse places down here. it is cheaper and more convenient than hauling a bunch of boxes of potatoe chips up [email protected]"
548655,Guest,2005-06-01 07:44:00,0,good point
548656,Guest,2005-06-01 07:48:00,0,"right! i won't bring up the good boat, and buying something reasonable just to take accross the border like an old piker runs the risk of breaking down, etc."
548660,Guest,2005-06-01 08:17:00,0,"sure, as a commercial loan officer i understand the business end of it, and anyone can realize that excess profits are good in the shortrun, but in the long run they're pricing themselves out of the market. as i stated we're seasoned-customers...my grandpa first took my dad to this resort, my dad and grandpa started taking me to this resort...we get along well with the owners, we're not a bunch of drunkards, we don't leave the garbage on the front step overnite for the bears to find...its just that the annual rate hikes are frustrating. a one-week full housekeeping package 3 years ago ran each individual about $1000 US, this year it'll be $1300/person for the same trip to the same lodge. she also quit providing minnows for us. (that's each person's share for the entire trip...mileage, fishing license, food, etc.) ...i'm beginning to understand how ownership could be cheaper... ---i know i'm getting pesimistic, and realistically they can charge whatever they want, i'll keep going..."
548662,Guest,2005-06-01 08:46:00,0,"we've always gone to Gull Rock/Red Lake atleast once a year, but are open to other places. typically take 2-3 one week trips north/year. we've tried different lakes, but hands-down prefer RL to anywhere we've been. we've come to really like the RL district, gotten to know a few of the locals, and want to keep returning for many more years..."
548677,phishfearme,2005-06-01 11:30:00,1242,one excellent way to get a reasonably priced fly-in trip is to find an outfitter with very short flights. take a look at my posting from a few years ago about an outfitter out of pickle lake with cabins on isolated lakes with a 5 minute flight. https://walleyecentral.com/dc/dcboard...ng_type=search i'm sure he raised his prices abit since then but i'll bet they're still the cheapest fly-in you'll find. we do different lakes every year and will go with him again. phish
