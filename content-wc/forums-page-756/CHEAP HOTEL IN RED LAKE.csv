548574,Guest,2005-05-31 09:32:00,0,MY BOYS AND I ARE GOING UP TO FISH THE RED LAKE AREA ..WE FLYOUT EARLY SATURDAY MORNING ... THINKING ABOUT GETTING A HOTEL FOR A FEW WINKS FRIDAY BEFORE JUMPING ON THE PLANE. ALL WE NEED IS A BED AND A SHOWER...CHEAP ANY SUGGESTIONS?
548601,Guest,2005-05-31 12:59:00,0,suggest calling your flyout pilot for a reference...otherwise perhaps try the vermillion bay area if traveling from the states. hotel in RL burned many years ago don't know what the new one is called.
548602,skrut,2005-05-31 13:12:00,52,Otherwise try the two motels in Ear falls. It is less than an hours drive to Red Lake.
548634,Pooch,2005-05-31 20:45:00,4619,http://www.norsemancapital.com/accommodations/ We usually bunk at the Norseman Inn on the main highway a couple times a year. Clean and reasonable. What outfitter are you flying out with? Pooch
548652,Guest,2005-06-01 06:57:00,0,"Howey Bay 807.727.3419 is OK, less expenisve than the Norseman but not as nice either. Depending on what time you fly-out they also have restaurant that serves breakfast and a bar for a late night Blue."
548687,Guest,2005-06-01 13:37:00,0,GOING WITH SPORTSMAN'S LODGE.... POOCH. HAVE YOU ANY EXPERIENCE WITH THEM?
548689,Guest,2005-06-01 16:39:00,0,"Hanger, That was the hotel in Geraldton that burned. The Red Lake Hotel is alive and well, and for sale as of October 2004."
548691,Pooch,2005-06-01 18:01:00,4619,"We have been using Green Airways for many years. Have not found a good reason to switch. Wife and I will be there the week of the fourth of July. Howey Bay isn't a bad place to stay either. Both motels seem to book up fairly early, so don't linger too much. Good luck Pooch"
548717,Guest,2005-06-02 08:18:00,0,THANKS FOR THE INFO ... I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
