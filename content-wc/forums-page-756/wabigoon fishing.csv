We are hoping to get into some good pike,walleye or small mouth fishing. Was wondering if anyone is familar with fishing wabigoon or any of the portage lakes. Any info would be great....thanks....good fishing to all.Dan"
548098,Guest,2005-05-18 21:45:00,0,"Try Butler, Larsen or Olsen on the East end of Wabigoon. Good Spots for Walleyes and smallies, also Dinorwic is good for smallies back in the bays and wallies as well."
548126,Guest,2005-05-19 14:13:00,0,"Never had much luck on Dinorwic with smallies, a little better with walleye."
548150,Guest,2005-05-20 07:36:00,0,"Babamel2, You are probably right about Smallies on Dinorwic. Better luck with them in Turtle Pond and Kaminasa Bay (South end of Dinorwic). When you heading up or are you local?"
548272,Guest,2005-05-24 07:35:00,0,"I plan to go up in August. Been going then for a number of years, the weather is usually quite nice and fishing is decent. I'm sure it is not as good as spring, but we have had some good catches."
548283,Guest,2005-05-24 12:20:00,0,"What resort? We are heading up on Friday morning the 27th. Can't hardly wait. We have been going up for a number of years. Always fish Dinorwic and the Bays. We don't seem to get over to Wabigoon that often. Just the Swede(sp Olsen, Butler, Paulsen ect..) lakes. Hope things go well for you in August. We have wondered what it was like in the fall as we have only been up in the spring."
548304,Skylane,2005-05-24 20:28:00,101,"Sparrow, which resort are you going to?"
548341,Guest,2005-05-25 12:14:00,0,Huber's - Little expensive but hard to break habits. Have been going there since it was Keiffer's Lone Pine Lodge. Maybe looking for another place as the cost is getting to be a bit much!!
548417,Guest,2005-05-26 11:12:00,0,"You may want to check out Brown Bay Camp. The current owners have really fixed the place up nice. It is a camp where it is best to bring your own boat, as they do not rent motors. Brown bay is on Dinorwic. I have been going there since 89 and even bought an old wooden boat from them that I restored."
548480,rebelrn2001,2005-05-27 14:50:00,1563,"Try: http://www.merkelscamp.com/ My wife and I have been going there for about 7 years now. I guess the 10th year is FREE! They just REDUCED their prices for the 'husband and wife' people that go there. They used to charge us for '3' people but now reduced that to 2. $333 US per person + tax. Nice clean cabins, 2 bedrooms, TV, microwave, stove, deck overlooking the lake. The dock is protected in their own bay. VERY GOOD HOSTS. Give them a try, you'll be back. Tell Terry and Merrill Dan & Sue from Green Bay sent you. If you go to Merkels, post again on here and I can give you (privately) some tips on where we fish."
