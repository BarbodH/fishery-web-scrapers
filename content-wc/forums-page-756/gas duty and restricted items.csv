548699,Eyesore,2005-06-01 22:25:00,455,"This question about duty on boat gas comes up all the time. In 4 years on this board I have yet to find the answer myself. But I will add... 6 years ago I was asked while crossing into Ont. if I had extra ""boat"" gas. I replyed ""No"". although I did have an extra 5 gallons, it was for my truck...grin. So my guess is that there must be a duty of some sort on extra gas, otherwise why would they ask. I have crossed many times and have only been asked this once. Last year in Sept, I crossed with full tanks (truck/boat) and had two 30 gallon drums with fuel in my camper. They did not ask, and I did not tell. I really doubt what I attempted to do was illegal, however if they would have seen the extra tanks, then they MIGHT have asked me to pay duty, as they do with all other overtaxed (smokes/booze) items in Canada In other words, when gas is mega overpriced, people will find a solution to ease the pain of the pump. Also, when I fill the truck up prior to crossing, I fill it up right to the cap. Same with the boat. I also plan it so I return into the states almost on fumes. If I can turn an otherwise $1,000 trip into a $950 trip, I will."

Anything else?"
548613,wooglin,2005-05-31 14:46:00,371,"Gas in WI is about $2.20 per gallon. Not sure about MN or the border...what is it in Dryden, Sioux Lookout, or anywhere else up nort? Not sure if it makes sense to actually bring it or buy it up there."
548615,Guest,2005-05-31 15:39:00,0,"in IA it's been 2-2.20 all year. i don't know the exact price up north, but it seems like in years past it has been higher at the marinas for boat gas than what we pay in the states...just a thought. our resort owner raised her price another 10% over last year and i'm looking to cut corners this fall. that's an idea for another post. ""what deals are out there and what cost-saving ideas have other fishermen found over the years?"""
548621,fishmaster,2005-05-31 17:03:00,209,Gas in MN is anywhere from 192.9-198.9. 198.9 at the border. Gas in Canada was about 95.9 a liter?
548628,Jesse-WI,2005-05-31 18:17:00,534,"You are allowed to carry a reasonable portion over the border duty free. The duty use to equal the difference in price, i.e. no savings. Reasonable equals = full tanks in boat and vechicle with all other normal tanks that would be carried full. Most lodges do not allow you to bring much extra if any and it is a very large hazard."
548631,wooglin,2005-05-31 19:11:00,371,3.8 liters per gallon (saw that on the urinal at work) 3.8 * .959 = $3.65 / gallon (Cheaper to bring)
548633,retire55,2005-05-31 20:44:00,1029,"You can get an idea of gas prices at various towns in Ontario at http://www.garnetknight.com/gas/ There are 3.785 litres in a US gallon. If we assume 95 cents Canadian per litre, then 1 US gallon would cost approx $3.60 Cdn. At today's exchange rate (1.2552), that's equivalent to $2.87 US for the equivalent of a US gallon. Even though that looks enticing, 30 gallons saves less than $25. Each unto his own but I wouldn't haul gas 500 miles to save $25."
548654,Guest,2005-06-01 07:41:00,0,"where's your price assumption from? is it a major stop such as dryden, ear falls, or vermillion for vehicles...or is it at a boat pump at a marina? the price may be different. you're right, it'd be safer to carry an extra 25 bucks rather than 30 gal. of fuel."
548657,retire55,2005-06-01 07:54:00,1029,"I looked up gas prices (on the reference I provided) for several towns in northwest Ontario (e.g. Dryden, Sioux Lookout, Fort Frances, Thunder Bay) and took a rough average to get 95 cents Cdn per litre. If one can buy gas cheaper than 95 cents Cdn per litre, the scale just swings more in favour of buying gas in Canada."
