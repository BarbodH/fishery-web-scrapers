1155586,AllenW,2009-12-22 09:19:00,11482,"Considering the varied information on crossing with a DUI, I'd think if I brought somebody with a DUI from anytime in the past I'd make up a battle plan in case they didn't get allowed to enter Canada.Might save a bit of confusion when or if it happens.Tough way to go, but ""they let me in last year"" might not work this time.Al"
1155595,scotttheguide,2009-12-22 10:49:00,73,"Why risk it? Send me your email address and I will send you some information of someone you can talk to. I am only trying to help.I don't want to see someone skip there vacation or see an outfitter loose a potential client on a maybe.Please do not blame the Immigration Officers at the border, it is there job to enforce the laws which allow visitors into Canada. I have been at the border and seen people getting denied entry and just ripping on the officers. I just shook my head like why.....One guy came out of the office all mad and then I heard him talking about his 3 DUI's and Posession Charges but they were all over a year ago....Uhhh, heres your sign!Anyway if you would like to talk to someone in advance please send me your information. All I need is your email."
1155616,AllenW,2009-12-22 14:40:00,11482,"I don't think most here are blaming any officer at the border, what seems to be the problem is inconsistent enforement, or a lack of somewhere to go to get a definite anwser.I've been lucky enough not to have a DUI on my record, but I'd think a email to the dept of tourism should either get a black and white explanation on whether you can get in or not, or at least a referal to someone who can.Wondering why if you have the anwser to the DUI problem you don't post for others?Al"
1155702,AllenW,2009-12-23 06:35:00,11482,"I want to opoligize to Scotttheguide, I made a comment on why he didn't post a source to help in crossing the border so all could see.He PM'd me and explained he didn't want to post it as problems arise sometimes when posting a personal email address on the web.Makes very good sense, and I missed that, sorry my mistake.Al"
1154036,celticbass1,2009-12-13 21:37:00,67,"So if you fly a commercial flight in to Canada and then rent a car or get picked up by the outfitter, do you run the same risk of being refused entry in to the country?"
1154490,lobo1,2009-12-16 02:22:00,734,A friend of mine applied for whatever rediculous tax this is to get into Canada that you all refer to as rehabilitation. This was a simple DUI - from over 20 years ago and the guy has not even had a traffic ticket ever since......matter of fact works for the U.S. Government (maybe this has kept him out LOL!) The guy sent in his $200 about 3 months ago and just last week found out that they deemed him NOT rehabilitated - entry denied! But the nice folks up there are not quitters........they encouraged him to apply again for another non-refundable $200.....maybe this month he is rehabilitated! I wonder how much money you have to throw at this to make it go away? We have decided to not go at all and have cancelled a 10K trip and the outfitter is a little pissed now that he didnt take the deposit I offered him a few months ago. I feel bad for him he is a very small outfiter - hope he can get a replacement. Being a police officer I understand how the law works but this 20+ year old misdemeanor holding us back from the big trip has me a bit ticked off at the moment. venting!!! Lobo1

1154518,Guest,2009-12-16 09:31:00,0,John: Every state is different as far as MVRs (motor vehicle record) are concerned. Here in Iowa a DWI never comes off (usually). I would have him contact his insurance agent or state drivers records and see if the old DWI is still showing. Chances are it is not and if he would happen to get checked at border there is no way they will know about if its not on his states MVR.
1154970,Guest,2009-12-18 14:47:00,0,What makes you think they check 50 different DOT's for MVR when the check for past DUI's They are looking for any past criminal records nut just DUI. It just so happens there are more DUI offenders trying to cross the meth dealers with records or murderers. The MVR would show neither of these offenses. BTY DUI does come off the DOT records in Iowa after 12 years.
1155086,walleyeduran,2009-12-19 07:55:00,286,"Up North Mark: has been watching too many CSI tv shows. I have a friend who answered the DUI question honestly in 1987 going through the border for a spring bear hunt, thus his name is in the Canadian system. For him to be considered redeemed, he had to contact the city in WI where he got his DUI. They had no know record of the DUI since it happened so long ago and told him to contact Madison to see what record they had of it. They had no record of the DUI either. It took him 3 yrs. to get this straightened out so he could get his redemption letter and Up North Mark thought this record would be in the FBI files. Duran"
1155142,Guest,2009-12-19 14:44:00,0,"Durna, How could I be so wrong about the NCIC keeping records of arrests and convictions. So what your saying is that the customs agents have access to all 50 states DOT records and they check all 50 when they check. Otherwise, if I had a DUI in Nebraska 5 years ago and now live in Iowa how else would the find my DUI unless they checked all 50 states, Right? I guess thats why it takes so long to get checked. Thanks for straightening me out on this one."
1155268,Burr,2009-12-20 08:27:00,8612,"I'm with you UPNORTHMARK, I think they check something like the NCIC your describing. Last year we got pulled to the immigration check. One of our party had previous DUI, when asked he admitted, and responded with the date in 1982. North Dakota hasn't had that on record for many years, but they saw it somehow on their computer. $200 and a one time permit and we were on our way.He was thinking of the other DUI's he had - much more recent than the 1982 conviction."
1155467,Guest,2009-12-21 13:19:00,0,"So I have 2 guys with DUI's that are going with me this year on a trip. Both of their first times to Canada. One is from about 12-13 years ago and the other will be from 7-8 years ago. They have no problem with paying the $200. What are the chances that if we are stopped and they are checked that they will be able to pay and enter? I know no one really knows for sure, but just want to hear some more experiences from people that have tried and been successful and tried and been turned away and any pointers that anyone has. THanks Blue"
1155469,v-bay gord,2009-12-21 13:35:00,3168,"Be sure they do not have other convictions on their record that they are not telling you about. Also consider where you are crossing the border. Fort Francis seems to be a problem.......Baudette, less so."
1153069,Guest,2009-12-09 07:13:00,0,I read the sticky of info posted by Juls. Has anyone done this? We have a guy that had a DUI 12 years ago that wants to go in 2010.... John
1153084,denpat,2009-12-09 07:54:00,86,"I'm not sure there is a correct answer to this question. In reading the Canadian laws it appears to me that after 10 years has past from the time a person has completed their sentence they are considered rehabilitated and are allowed into Canada. Then the next thing you read contradicts that. Getting rehabilitated is a very time consuming and tedious ordeal, which can take up to 6 months to complete. I have read posts where people are turned back after 20+ years and others that have no problem at all. My opinion is that it would be risky to go, as you may get turned around. I would also like to know the answer, but I am sure you will get many different answers."
1153091,AllenW,2009-12-09 08:19:00,11482,"Contact the Canadian Embassy or a Canadian Consulate in the U.S.Get a name when you call and if they can fax you someting, have them do it.It seems there's enough varibles that I'd have all my ducks in a row when I showed up at the border.Few years ago I went with a guy who had a DUI about 15 years before, they let us in, but we spent almost 2 hours at the border dealing with them.Al"
1153129,Guest,2009-12-09 11:09:00,0,"Thanks for the replies. The guy that wants to go is not a die hard fisherman, and this may be more than he wants to bother with.... John"
1153132,scotttheguide,2009-12-09 11:16:00,73,"Send me a PM with your email. I have someone you can talk to about this. There are steps you need to take to get clearence to cross the border if you have a DUI or other certain offenses. Do not wait, it can take up to 3-4 months if there is a problem to get it resolved.Please do not try and do it yourself."
1153478,walleyeduran,2009-12-10 18:37:00,286,"It depends on the State he got the DUI in. A DUI in WI 12 years ago would only stay on the persons record for 10 years, hence there is no way for the custom agents to have this information on their computers. If the person has been to Canada before and has claimed to have a DUI conviction, then the Canadian custom agents have this on their records and it will never be deleted. (you would then have to go through the paper work and $ to get the approval to enter their country). Note: all DUI convictions in WI now stay on your record for life. Duran"
1153548,Guest,2009-12-11 08:38:00,0,"I think the immigration officials are the ones that check for prior criminal acts such as DUI or OWI or armed robbery or drug charges, etc. The point is they don't just check a states DOT records for past traffic related charges like a DUI. They check the NCIC which is the National Crime Information Center which is run by the FBI. This shows all criminal convictions & arrests and does not dissapear after 12 years. This is truley your permanent record. The Canadian border officals have access to this record."
1153706,Guest,2009-12-11 23:52:00,0,"Had a friend go through the rehab route, keep in mind this is only good for three years, you would be better off to get your record mandated, which means cleared, and then you're good to go. I guess you can mandate your record twice in your lifetime."
1153848,tly,2009-12-12 19:45:00,1900,"AllenW has the right idea. We had one of our new guys from another state who got set aside when we attempted to cross at Ft Francis. He has a misdemeaner of a bit of grass back in the 70's. Small quantity. They asked him about arrests and he answered truthfully. The folks complimented him on his honesty and sent us on our way. Another one of our party was also taken into a private room. He declined to say why and we didn'd pry but all was OK in the end. Ironically, the brother of the previous guy was about 2 years into a DUI and he never lit up any lights or anything. While we were waiting, the party next to us got totally torn down. Door panels, individual lures in tackle box and all. This was while our guys were being 'interviewed"" caused us concern if they are that thorough. Go figure. I guess being honest has its merits though."
