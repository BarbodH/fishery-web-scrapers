1157130,Moondog,2009-12-31 22:59:00,362,"Just wondering. Heard from Mary Spencely in Florida and she is having surgery on her shoulder in January. She is homesick and so are we!!!! We spend 7 weeks at South Bay in the ""summer."" We can't wait until ice out! Long drive from Colorado but worth the adventure!"
1157162,tackleman,2010-01-01 07:54:00,444,"NO the other neighbour, Ian and Drew Cooke. Kim goes to the boys hut by the island across from Stevensons point"

1157195,tackleman,2010-01-01 10:44:00,444,"Happy New Year Bud, send me a email or private message on here so i can get your email address.Tell Malinda, Linda has her casserole dish that she left at Greg & Jens.See you in the spring, had the walleye last night for dinner, you would have enjoyed it."
1156780,lenray,2009-12-29 18:48:00,467,There is a sign on the road up north of the village of Pickle Lake that has this reading or something like that. Does this mean bait fish only or does it include night crawlers. Always have wondered. Might like to take some crawlers up if legal maybe leaches also. Anyone know the answer???? thanks
1156791,hoosiercanadian,2009-12-29 20:07:00,104,"Crawlers are permitted even in Manitoba, where non-residents cannot use live minnows, there might be some lake or park that requires only artificials , but for that area , i'm thinking the sign is refering to live minnows, not crawlers., but this is a guess without looking at the specific regulations."
1156816,lobo1,2009-12-30 02:36:00,734,That's funny Len! I think the sign means that when you pass that point that you just don't need to use bait any more......it becomes more of a hassle than a benefit!! That's my interpretation of that sign in that particular area! LOBO1
1156898,northernbite,2009-12-30 12:07:00,1186,"LenrayYou should know that, we took night crawlers up a couple of years ago. Let me know how they worked for you. Hows the weather in Michigan? A lot easier winter here in the Keystone than last year.Paul"
1156921,Bigfishhunter,2009-12-30 14:28:00,803,"Just gonna clarify something, in regards to Manitoba Lobo. It is not that live bait is not allowed only to non residents. The truth is that livebait is allowed in the southern part of the province for all anglers non residents included. In the northern part of the province there is no livebait allowed to anyone. However nightcrawlers do not fall into this, and you may use them. Now I am pretty sure that the same is true in Ontario. Crawlers are not illegal and crawlers can be used, but not brought in. I think the worry there is the water that they are transported in. I know that we catch crawlers ourselves on a daily basis. We just leave some fish heads in the shallows under the dock over night, in the morning they are loaded with leeches."
1156934,lobo1,2009-12-30 16:04:00,734,i like the leech trap idea - never thought of that - very good!!! thanks
1156952,rdsanford,2009-12-30 18:20:00,37,In Ontario you are allowed to take crawlers in but they have to be in bedding. You are not allowed to bring minnows in and non-residents are not allowed to trap minnows. You can buy them and use them in Ontario.
1157024,tackleman,2009-12-31 08:16:00,444,"I dug out the regulations for 2009 and it definately shows on the map where BAITFISH are not allowed. It doesn't mention any other type of live bait (ie:worms, leeches) as being not allowed. The regs may have changed for this year but the 2010 regulations are supposed to be available today at the various licencing depots and they would have to be studied to check this."
1157070,Moondog,2009-12-31 13:55:00,362,Any ice on Gull Rock yet???
1157076,tackleman,2009-12-31 15:02:00,444,"Oh yes, we got ICE. the guys from Red Lake are driving the ice road to cochenour and here on Gullrock, they are coming in the back way from the Ranger Lake road to get to the ice fishing village they set up by the 3 sisters.My neighbours have their hut out by the islands off of Stevensons Point and they are out there quite often. My other neighbour has a hut on the ice between his house and mine and so I guess it will be given a shot this weekend to try out my new ice fishing poles"
