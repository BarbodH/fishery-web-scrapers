1154806,celticbass1,2009-12-17 18:33:00,67,Earls sounds very interesting but my 10 and 12 year old nephews are joining us as well.
1154858,Bandit,2009-12-18 05:28:00,140,They just like to hire good looking 20- 24 year old girls & they dress like going to Fashion Show. The game here is to attract the business crowd & score some big tip money.
1155183,fishncamp,2009-12-19 19:03:00,49,Earl's on Main is a 5 minute walk from the Forks.
1155193,tackleman,2009-12-19 20:50:00,444,"Since these guys are fishermen, don't you think they should go to the Real Canadian Fish Restaurant ""Joeys Only"" Get a taste of that real fish flavour!!!"
1154035,celticbass1,2009-12-13 21:31:00,67,"Going to Wollaston Lake Lodge on June 29, 2010. We fly in to Winnipeg really early and we leave for the camp the following day. Is there anything we should do or see in Winnipeg? Anyone suggest any good places to eat?"
1154038,fishncamp,2009-12-13 21:49:00,49,"Visit the Forks...nice place to people watch, grab a bite and some nice shops to check out. It is close to downtown and the exchange district(if you are looking for some nightlife). The ball park is right across the street if you want to catch a ball game. Good central location too."
1154045,Chris K,2009-12-14 01:40:00,278,"Go to 529 Wellington and have dinner. It's a steakhouse in an old mansion. It is arguably the best restaurant in Winnipeg. It's not cheap, but if you are going to Wollaston, you are not worried about that! If you want to have a really neat fishing experience to add to your trip, I would suggest a catfish trip in Winnipeg in the city. Cats over 25 pounds are not uncommon. http://www.citycats.ca/ Todd is a great guy and wonderful guide, and I assure you you will have a great time. Chris K"
1154055,manitobawalleye,2009-12-14 05:04:00,885,http://www.citycats.ca/ i 2nd that as well.....Todd would pick you up at your hotel.... no need to rent a vehicle and go somewhere..... 529 wellington is a great steak house but also would suggest rae and jerry's steak house
1154065,campchick,2009-12-14 06:42:00,96,The North American headquarters for Ducks Unlimited is located just north of Winnipeg. Oak Hammock Marsh. Might be worth a look.
1154099,LeeMB,2009-12-14 10:12:00,83,Take the guys suggestion for fishing for Channel cats. It is a true trophy fishery and a unique experiance.
1154259,celticbass1,2009-12-14 20:25:00,67,Those are some great suggestions guys. I will talk to the fellas going with me we have a group of five so I'm not sure how that would work out cat fishing but I would love to give it a try.
1154267,Skywagon,2009-12-14 20:52:00,1106,"I will have to agree with these two eating places. 529 Wellington is first class, probably the best place in Winnipeg. My wife and I ate there, had two glasses of wine each and with tip spent over $200. Outstanding food and service though, just a little pricey. Have eaten at Rae and Jerry's a couple of times, good food, but nothing special. Like any big city, a nice place to visit once in a while, but has all the big city issues, they just come in a different package. Pick your motel-hotel carefully and ask the Lodge for suggestions on that, if they have not already done so. Enjoy your fishing trip, you will have a great time."
1154365,Aaron-IN,2009-12-15 12:03:00,500,Without a doubt you must go to the Hooters in Winnipeg. In my opinion the best Hooters in North America.
1154460,Guest,2009-12-15 19:48:00,0,The real channel catfish are caught at Lockport which is 25 minutes from the airport hotels. Google for outfitters!
