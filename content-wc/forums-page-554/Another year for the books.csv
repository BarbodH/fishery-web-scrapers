I can only think back to our Canada trip and some great fishing! I'm starting to look forward to another great trip to LacSeul. Remembering those nice Walleyes and fighting with large Northern. Looking forward to staying at a different camp and fishing new areas. I guess this is called the ""winter time blues."""
1157018,Babamel2,2009-12-31 07:43:00,414,"At this time of the year Canada seems so far away both in distance, in memory looking back and in anticipation looking forward to the next trip up which will be in Aug.What a great way to spend vacations -- on the Canadian waters."
1157056,Pooch,2009-12-31 11:52:00,4619,"I'm fortunate in that I can make several trips to Canada a year. When I put the rods back into the rod tube after the last trip, I start looking forward to the next season. I've never grown tired of fishing anywhere, especially Canada.Sometimes it's just being there that is so pleasant. Old friends, new friends, long gone friends. It all makes for a life time of memories.Thanks to all of you outfitters for putting up with this bunch of dummies that are addicted to that experience. For the ""pure"" fisherman, we lament the day when we can no longer smell the cedars and stare dumbfounded at the night sky.Pooch"
1157073,Seanik,2009-12-31 14:32:00,218,"My wife and I will welcome in 2010 with a lobster dinner and a glass of wine, quietly at home. My group of 5 oldtimers had a great 2009 Aug. fishing trip to Lac Achepabanca in Quebec, the fishing was very slow but the fellowship was outstanding and made the trip a memorial one. We have already booked 2010, A July fly in trip to Lake Nagagami out of Hornepayne< Ontario. In anticipation, I have gone on a buying spree, maps of the Lake, several dz assorted jigs, a Cabelas guide wear gore-tex Parka and bibs, half wave spoons, and a bucket of Gulp alive assorted 3"" minnows and this all happened in the last 3 days. We have not been to Ontario for the past 8 years, always Quebec, because it was closer. Looking forward to different scenery and making new friends. A happy and Healthy New Year to All, Seanik"
1157267,1shooter,2010-01-01 16:27:00,1493,Yep....we have our spring 2010 booked too. Just need to lock down a date for the fall and we will be set for the year.
1157462,joeman79,2010-01-02 18:28:00,417,"I hope in 2010 there is a little bit more of a normal summer weather pattern in Ontario. 1st week in August hopefully this year I will not have to wear Long underwear and rainwear 5 of the six days on LacSeul. And as Pooch said, Thanks to all the great Camps and Staffs for Providing us the places to do what we love to do. 208 days Can't wait"
