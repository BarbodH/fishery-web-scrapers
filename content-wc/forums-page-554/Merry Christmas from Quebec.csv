I'll be heading up to the Gouin once again in mid-February for my annual two week caretaking time while Ron & Rosie do the shows in and around Pittsburg. Nemio is just so beautiful in the winter months - absolute solitude! I'll return again mid-May for 6 - 8 weeks and this year will be doing some guiding too and then my annual August session is in play, so if you're in the area look me up - the fishing is awaiting."

When I think back on 2009, I will always fondly remember our Gouin trip at Nemio. I appreciate so much your help making this trip a really good one for my dad, my boys and I. My only regret is that we didn't get a chance to meet you. We're not heading to Nemio this year. We almost decided to but have elected to try something different. We are heading to Pasha Lake Cabins in Jellicoe. This place has been on my list to get to for sometime, and we have the opportunity to do it this year. We do hope to head back up to Nemio though in the next couple of years. Happy new year. Chris"
