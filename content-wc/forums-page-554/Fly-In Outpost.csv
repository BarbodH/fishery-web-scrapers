1153109,tilldawg,2009-12-09 09:33:00,55,Try this one: http://www.halleyscamps.com/fly-in-o...inmenu-22.htmlI used to fish Moar Lake at Norse Lodge (they are now closed). And we would often go into Sharpstone. Unbelievable walleye and pike fishing.
1153493,mnfisherman53,2009-12-10 20:37:00,1,"I do not post much but am a frequent reader. I have been with both Excellent Adventures and Wildernesss North. I now have access to a private remote cabin near Dryden so I have not flown in since 2006.Both these outfiters have outposts on good Pike lakes located on excellent river systems. This is the key to giant pike. If you are interested in one of these two outfitters, E-mail me. I have some info you will be interested in. ThanksK"
1153549,Golden Eagle,2009-12-11 08:40:00,2642,"I agree. I went in for the October 3 week and was the only guest in camp and on the water. Had the whole place to myself for a couple of days while the owner and his employee were ""up north"" closing down outpost camps. I usually look for a hole in the bookings and jump on it to be in camp when I'm alone or with maybe only 2-4 other fishermen. September and early October usually work for me. August, September and October fishing are almost always extremely rewarding. Extreme weather can trump a good lake.I pounded walleys and boated plenty of pike. Huge pike. Fishing was good. Fishing conditions were poor, due to strong wind, snow, and cold rain. Water lines froze, but not for long. The lake I fished is about 12-14 miles long and not very wide. It's considered a shallow lake compared to most in the area. Pike grow big by eating plenty of walleyes and whitefish. I really believe that the abundance of whitefish is the key to their growth."
1156347,IAranger,2009-12-27 09:34:00,352,A lot of great posts full of good info here I am looking for the same type of place but would like the diversity of catching smallies and / muskies also any good suggestions with that extra twist ?? Thanks in advance
1152527,Golden Eagle,2009-12-06 17:28:00,2642,"NW Ontario has lots of lakes holding big pike and many have no cabins or lodges on them. Some are a little hard to get to though. Locals know about them, but all they want is walleyes, closer the better."
1152594,onetimedave,2009-12-07 06:49:00,502,"Look at rhe Nakina, Ontario area. We have used Arctic Watershed Outposts for 13 times. GREAT fishing and the $$$ are right. www.awonakina.com"
1152605,phishfearme,2009-12-07 07:44:00,1242,EVERY lake holds big pike - but the bigest lakes provide the best chance for trophys - and there's pretty much none that either don't have other cabins/lodges or you can't access unless you're a native. the request was for a flyin lake (rent a lake to yourself) for trophy northern and my statement still stands that this is a difficult order. phish
1152693,IAranger,2009-12-07 13:22:00,352,I am following this thread as I am looking to take my son up for same type of trip snowin here today so let the spring fever begin ! Anyone ever try Mattice Lake Outfitters ?
1152703,5richards,2009-12-07 13:46:00,131,"Pike Hunter -- please email me @[email protected] and I will share my search for trophy pike with you-- This camp will meet all your needs for @$1,000/person --Goldeneagle would agree with me!!!"
1152792,pike hunter,2009-12-07 21:42:00,12,"Thanks for all the great information. Has anyone tried Excellent Adventures? Wilderness North? Amik Outposts? I truly appreciate all your input.5richards, I sent you a email."
1152824,deputy dog,2009-12-08 06:25:00,305,"IAranger, i have booked with mattice lake outfitters for july '10. this will be our first trip with this outfitter and based on the info i have gathered, mostly from this web site, they seem first rate. accommodations seem second to none and their reputation for customer service is impeccable, just hope the fishin is as good do a search for them and you will find abundant info about their business. you can also check out their site. good luck!"
1152916,skappel,2009-12-08 13:52:00,7,"My group has done REALLY well out of Lynn Lake, Manitoba. Look up Wolverine Lodge or Lynn Lake Fly-in Outposts camps online. A guy by the name us Russ runs the operation. Tons of pike up 45"" and walleyes up to 25"". Other wise look at the Winnipeg River System. Good Luck!"
1152975,phishfearme,2009-12-08 17:51:00,1242,doesn't lynn lake have lots of outposts/lodges? not what the original poster was looking for. phish
1153060,Bigfishhunter,2009-12-09 06:52:00,803,"yes, it does but they are all fly in secluded destinations, which is exactly what the poster is looking for. The guy wants a fly in lake with an outpost cabin where he owns the lake all to himself. Wolverine would fit the bill, but Grass River Lodge and Kississing Lake Lodges both have nicer cabins and facilities at their places than does Wolverine. Kississing has 10 outposts on separate secluded lakes that would satisfy everything you want."
1152068,pike hunter,2009-12-04 17:56:00,12,"Hello. I'm new here. I found this site while searching for a fly-in outpost for 2010. There is a ton of great information here, wish I found you guys earlier! Our group of 4 is looking for a fly-in outpost in ON or MB for 2010. We have been on some canoe trips to Canada but never a fly-in. There are so many websites out there we don't know where to start. I was hoping for some recommendations from you guys.We are most interested in trophy pike and some walleye. We would like a lake all to ourselves and we would like to keep it around $1500 or less per man. The cabin itself isn't really important as long as it has a fridge. Also, what is the best time of year for the big ones way up north? If anyone could tell me about their experiences it would be greatly appreciated."
1152110,Illinois fisherman,2009-12-04 20:28:00,9,Halleys is a good fly-out and not bad priced. Here are some web sites that might help. http://www.ontariossunsetcountry.ca/http://www.ontariopikefishing.ca
1152118,Larry Mac,2009-12-04 20:52:00,530,"Hi Pike Hunter, Take a look at Grass River Lodge in Flin Flon The Pas Northern Manitoba. We really enjoyed our trip up there. The owners are very nice.www.grassriverlodge.com 1-866-Big-PikeThere are so many great choices where ever you decide have a great tripThank you,Larry Mac"
1152124,Guest,2009-12-04 21:20:00,0,Lots of real good places. We like having a variety of species and have used a smaller operation close to the Fort Frances border. www.gatewaynorthoutfitters.net They have always been helpful and equipment worked great. We try to make a trip every year to get away from the real world.
1152156,Glenman12,2009-12-05 05:40:00,762,"Not sure where you live but if youre say, within 50 miles or so of one of the All Canada shows its worth the tripwww.allcanada.com/"
1152167,Bigfishhunter,2009-12-05 06:12:00,803,"without a doubt northwestern manitoba is the place to be. Even our drive in lakes up here are out of this world. I know a couple of really good outfitters that have excellent fly-in lakes. One of them has already been mentioned, Grass River Lodge. They are located on Reed Lake which is a drive in lake but the pike fishing is literally out of this world, with daily 40-45"" fish and every season someone gets a 50. They also have fly in outposts and they will treat you well. Kississing Lake lodge also has some phenomenal fly in outposts for Big pike. They have one on a lake called Barnet which is a great action lake as well as trophy lake. The bonus there is that you often end up catching three or four big walleyes on your trip casting the weed beds. Eyes are available if you want to target them as well.www.kississinglodge.com good luck."
1152295,phishfearme,2009-12-05 15:06:00,1242,pike hunter - i think the toughest one of your requirements to address is a trophy pike lake all to yourself. trophy pike lakes are almost always large and large lakes have numerous camps or lodges on them. one option that we've considered is wigwasence lake with north of 51. it's a large lake known for big pike and one camp for one group. check out northof51.com phish
1152368,celticbass1,2009-12-05 21:19:00,67,"For a first time fly in I would always suggest Air Ivanhoe in Ontario for great friendly service and a huge variety of lakes to choose from. I think they probably have 20-30 lakes that they fly in to now and most of them are remote enough that you will see no one. If you contact them and tell them exactly what you want they will fit your trip to your needs My first choice for quality fishing with the understanding that the accomadations aren't quite as nice would be Hearst Air Service. The fishing at their lakes is unbelievable, they have a great plane but last time we were there the cabins weren't quite as nice as some other places we've been. The fishing more than made up for it. We have been going for about 16 years and we have found the 2nd or 3rd week of July to be very consistent for fishing."
1152385,Bigfishhunter,2009-12-05 22:56:00,803,"Phishfearme, I am sorry but you are wrong. This may be the case in Ontario, but it is not the case in Manitoba. Larry Mac and I can attest to that. Take a look at our suggestions. There are sooooo many good lodges that offer great pike fishing where you will be the only one on the lake. I could name 10-12 within a 50 mile radias of me that are only accessible by air and are full of giant northerns."
1152515,phishfearme,2009-12-06 16:01:00,1242,i'll buy that - i was referring to NW ontario - i've never been to manitoba for fishing. i doubt if there's any large lakes in NW ontario available to non-natives that don't have numerous cabins or lodges on them. used to be that way in NE ontario but now you can drive to almost any lake there. seems NW ontario will not follow suit (i hope) and i hope manitoba doesn't follow suit either. phish
