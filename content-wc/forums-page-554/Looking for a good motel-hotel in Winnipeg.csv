Shuttle service and reasonably priced compared to the Greenwood Inn and others. I would stay away from the Howard Johnson though. A good idea is to check out hotels on www.tripadvisor.com once you narrow down your search a bit. Get the scoop from people who have recently stayed there. Hope this helps.
