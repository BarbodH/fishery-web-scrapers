We stayed on Kenoji Lake.At that time, I thought he ran a class operation. Cabins and furnishings were top-notch (in a relative sense - keep in mind this isn't Gangler's or Wollaston) for such remote locations. Service was great. He'd even take orders for beer and fly it in ahead of time so it didn't count against your weight limit. When we checked in on our second trip, we talked his wife out of a fresh-made cake that she sent along with us As an aside, the cabin we stayed at had a live-box for fish. Apparently someone had brought in some expanded metal and constructed a box next to the dock. The first day, we loaded it with any of the eaters we caught. Afterwards, if we felt like a fresh fish meal, we just walked down to the dock and took out what we needed. Fishing was excellent for walleyes, with good numbers in the low- to mid-20"" range. I would tell you that we did not catch many in the upper-20"" range, although I think, since those days, Mike has very heavily promoted and, on some of his lakes, insisted on stricty catch-and-release.I could honestly say that, if I were to consider a fly-in again, Mike would be one of the first options I would research.Good luck and have fun.Oh yeah...........the boats and outboards were certainly serviceable.....again, nothing fancy but they were dry and they even had spare outboards at the outposts in case there was a breakdown."

He certainly knows the Pipestone area and we caught five eyes over 27"" that day. Facilities are pretty much as advertised. Reputed to be a very good smallie lake but I did not fish for them... Good luck."

1157170,Skyraptor,2010-01-01 08:51:00,291,"Our group went to Kenoji Lake in the 90's about 3 times during the July time. The main lake has a good population of Walleyes and can be caught very easy. The northerns were hard to come by on the main lake and we had to run our boats up a couple of rivers to a area that was portage only. Once there(2 hour trip) we ran into the big northerns (45""+). The cabin was ok, the fridge ran on solar power and was hard to keep food cold since we had a lot of cloudy days and at night we only had one light for the main room. It is ok for guys that want to rough it. If I recall correctly he has a locked A-frame near the cabin that houses the beer and when the pilot drops you off he counts the cases of beer left and when he picks you up he counts again and you are charged for the usage. He use to lock it but found out guys ran out of beer and broke the lock all the time. It is a good operation and Mike is top-notch. Only problem we had was he was booked for the early part of the season and it was almost impossible to get the good times to fish."
