1152436,mvor,2009-12-06 07:52:00,3,My family and I are going to Montreal for summer vacation to see my inlaws. I am taking my boat and want to find a place for all of us (6) to go fish with a cabin/lodge for 4 days of pike and walleye fishing. I am looking to be within 5 hours drive time of the southside of montreal. (Brussard). Thanks

1153911,Andre (wallyandre),2009-12-13 09:00:00,2274,There is some links for outfitters on Lake St-Pierrehttp://www.lacsaintpierre.com/en/accueil.htmlhttp://www.pourvoirierogergladu.com/ Those 2 sites are in French but don't be afraid to give them a call they speak perfect english. Once in Montreal you can send me a e-mail and if I'm around I can take you on the St-Lawrence river right in downtown Montreal for some walleye fishing.

You can also head towards Ontario and hit Lake St Francis, it's a shallow lake with a good channel for large walleye. You can fish it, watch the winds. You can head south from Brossaard and hit the top of Lake Champlain, with lots of Bass and pike. HAve a look for Quebec website for fishing and get some other ideas. Hope that helps."
