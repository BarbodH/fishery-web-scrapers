1155708,schandm,2009-12-23 06:57:00,18,Anyone have any reports on this lake? Looking for a place to take my 9 year old grandson that has decent fishing but not too primitive. Any suggestions in eastern Ontario or western Quebec would be appreciated.Thanks
1155771,El_Bombero,2009-12-23 11:23:00,18,"Me and my buddy were gonna go to the Oldgascan in 04'. We ended up going to Lac Remigny instead.I haven't been up there since 2004. Camps Ronoda. Glen Oberland(?) was the owner then. I'm not sure if he's still there or not, the website looks a lot different. His place wasn't too fancy. We had the American Plan, it was nice - good food. He was a GREAT story teller.We happen to go up that year just after the mayfly hatch and that really turned the bite off. We don't really fish for Walleye that much anyway. We had some decent pike and some nice smallies if I remember right. When we were having a tough time, Glenn took us out on his own boat to some honey holes - which was really nice.The water is tea stained and (at the time) there were fields of rocks that were not marked and we almost bit it hard. The main lake narrows at the top end before running into the other lake. Up in this area, it is like a NASA wind tunnel. The water up top there gets really choppy, which makes for good fishing. I don't get to go up to Canada very often, so I never really have a bad time or bad ""luck"". Compared to Central Ohio, just about anywhere else is good fishing, and Canada is a dream. Having said that, others would probably give Remigny a thumbs down based upon our catches that year, but we did not have any knowledge of how to catch fish during the Mayfly hatch. I will say this...there was a goup of guys in another cabin from Pennsylvania who were illegally netting minnows and they were slaying the Walleyes. I'm not sure if using minnows is still illegal in that area or if there is a closed season on them. If they are okay - they were the way to go, obviously."

1155822,slug72,2009-12-23 16:47:00,34,"Hi Schandm, I have been taking my sons on fishing trips yearly for the past 6 years since my oldest son was 9. I have learned a lot of lessons, mostly the hard way. The biggest equation with a 9 y/o, in my opinion, is quantity of fish. While the memories of fishing with grandpa will be cherished no matter what, they will be even more cherished if the rod bends a fair bit during the trip. That said, I would be nervous about going anywhere without panfish as at least a backup option. I only learned this after a trip to a famous smallmouth bass lake with no panfish. After three days of my son not catching a fish, I knew I had made a mistake. Since then, we have been to locations where I have spent many hours relaxing in the back of boat watching the smiles of my boys catch one fish after another. If you would like some specific recommendations, need some more information than you have provided. Price range? Distance willing to travel? Housekeeping or American Plan? Favorite species (other than panfish)? In the meantime, check out Nemio Outfitters on the Gouin Reservoir. No panfish but pretty good fishing and Ron and Rosie will treat your 9 y/o like a rock star. Prices are unbeatable. Here is the link to my daily fishing reports posted from our trip this past summer...https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ighlight=gouin Chris"
1155861,schandm,2009-12-23 19:03:00,18,"Chris, Thanks for the reply. I am a died in the wool walleye/pike fisherman along with my son-in-law. We would entertain American plan places, but we are both good cooks and I would even title him as a gourmet cook. I am looking for a place that has some things to explore on shore as well as potential fishing spots. We once found an abandoned gold mine that was really interesting. In the middle of nowhere and no clue how they got stuff in there. They live in Phillie and I live in Ohio and we are looking for some common ground that is about 10-12 hours drive for each of us. The prices at Nemio look good, especially the family plan. We may try that place. We would be going about the same time you were there last year so I would anticipate the same fishing conditions. A little tougher in August but just have to find the pattern. We generally troll until we find fish and then set up and jig for them. Drifting also sometimes works if conditions are right. Thanks Dave"
1155934,ohiojmj,2009-12-24 10:08:00,1262,"I've been to Camps Ronoda 5 times in the past seven. Great camp and fishery. Glenn Oblander, the wonderful camp owner, passed away 4 years ago as he was closing up camp. His assistant, the motivated tall thin local guy ran the the camp 3 yrs ago. He was attempting to buy it, but the $$ deal ddn't work. I think Glenn's sister sold the camp. I've heard nothing about new people other than reading the updated website.Remigny lake is about 25 miles long. There is plenty of fishing in the first ten. We caught many pike each and every trip, and a decent amount of walleye and smallmouth. It's most notable for the pike fishing, The camp is at the end of the lake as a small stream runs though the peaceful little town into Lac Des Quinze, a 60 mile plus huge lake with walleye. Back to Remigny, the 2 mile bay out front of the camp is an enormous cabbage weed bed and trocky shoals. We caught limits of pike within a few miles of camp. Beyond the bay, there are a few islands, deep channels, endless bullrush weeds along shore, and rocky dropoffs. There is endless humps, bumps, and dropoffs for walleye and pike. Our favorite was weed beds 6-10 foot deep near real deep water. As mentioned before, lots of rocks; bring a spare prop and be preapred to hammer the pike. Weather is the true deciding factor on fishing success at Remigny. We've been there for relentless cold fornt action in late June, early July. We've been wacked by a relentless mayfly hatch. When the weather is right and there is chop in the water, it was unbelievable. Our biggest pike was about 19#, but we've heard of larger being caught and released. There is a French speaking camp about 7 miles up the lake, but it looked less organized and not as well kept as Ronoda.Hope the info helps. I'm planning a return trip in '10. We tried Lake Biscotasing (north of Sudbury) with 2 hours of graded gravel road and were disappointed by excessively high water levels and only fair bite all week of good weather. Remigny is fertile, natural lake with much more habitat for toothy critters. Last summer we went to Georgian Bay ay Key River and enjoyed outstanding walleye, but very very treacherous water for my new boat and we missed hammering the pike."
1156541,El_Bombero,2009-12-28 12:18:00,18,"Ohiojmj-That is really sad to hear of Glenn's passing. I must have been there the year prior to that. It was about 5 years ago. Glenn made the trip worthwhile. In fact, one of the main reasons why we picked his place is because he was from Ohio. I will never, ever forget a story he told us about a bear hunting customer who came up only with a bow and said he used it in Nam. It's too NON-PC to repeat it here, but I laughed till I almost puked. He was a great guy.We had hit the mayfly hatch and it shut down the walleyes. I think as we were still newbie pike fishers...we just didn't have the techniques down to bring in any (really)big ones. I'm not sure where we will be going this spring, but the last week of May going into the first week of June is our target date."

Maybe some of the other posters can fill in the details, something about written permission with proof from the parents? They ended up being delayed until they could get something faxed to the border authorities."
1156682,DBLNUT,2009-12-29 10:00:00,1,"Send me an email,[email protected],we had a group of 8 there in june of '09. Brian"
1156839,KSmithy72,2009-12-30 08:27:00,6,"Hi Schandm, Our group has gone to Ogascanan every year since 2001 and love it. Brad and Ginny are good hosts and keep a mean camp. You can either stay at the cabins at the main lodge with showers, toilets and electric, or rough it, like we do at the outpost cabins. There's beaches and conservation lakes to if the grandson needs a change of pace... We've gone up from opener to last week in June. Our last few years we've done well for eyes, but it took some time to figure out the lake. Here's my report from 2008:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ad.php?t=77354 If you end up booking, I can hook you up with some maps and hotspots...I think you and your grandson would enjoy it. Cheers, Kevin"
1156744,slug72,2009-12-29 15:23:00,34,"Given your desire to pursue walleye and pike, I have to recommend Nemio. The only drawback, in my opinion, to the trip is the significant amount of time on dirt roads to get there. Very doable but I was very happy to see paved roads on the way home. When we were up there, the fish were off. The walleyes we were catching had empty stomachs. But we still caught more walleye in the week than most locations in northeast Ontario and Quebec can offer. As I said in my posts, I am not a very good walleye angler. We didn't troll much which would've probably resulted in some more fish. McQ who posts here at WalleyeCentral goes there every year. He is an accomplished fisherman who has fished all over Quebec and Ontario. When a walleye angler like McQ goes annually to one location, that is a great testament to the fishing. Oh yeah, he fishes there in August also. The prices at Nemio are unbeatable, in my opinion. The cabins aren't fancy but are roomy and clean. The boats were in great shape. Ron and Rosie were excellent hosts. I spend a lot of time researching fishing trips on the web and am not convinced there is anywhere in Eastern Ontario and Quebec that offers the consistent quality of fishing as the Gouin and Nemio Outfitters. I know others will differ but I am also talking from the perspective of going somewhere for the first time. Any location can be real good if you go there year after year and learn the spots. But at Nemio, we were on fish the first night, and like I said, we're not very good walleye fishermen. Finally re: Nemio, I would recommend buying leaches. Gulp Alive minnows worked well for us but the Gulp Alive leaches weren't nearly as good as the live ones. I am planning a trip to Pasha Lake Cabins in Jellicoe, Ontario. This is a bit of hike for me from PA at 20 hours. It also entails portaging which may or may not be your grandson's cup of tea. Its worth taking a look at it given that you love walleye and pike. I'll certainly report when I get back next summer. Let me know if you have any more questions. I spend a lot of time reseraching this stuff and would be glad to help."
