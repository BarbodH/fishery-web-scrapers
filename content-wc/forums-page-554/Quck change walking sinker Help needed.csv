1155326,luv2fishcanada,2009-12-20 15:33:00,41,Last year in Canada I saw the slickest walking sinker setup but have not been able to find out where to buy any. I am not sure who makes them but I can best describe it as follows: There is a top end that attaches to the line which has two short prongs coming out of it. The weighted top of the walking sinker has two small holes on top that push into the prongs. You can switch weights in a matter of seconds. I believe the part that attached to the line was rubber. Any ideas??????????

I can either attach a bottom bouncer or a water gremlin snap on/off sinker so they are all interchangable as well as can also be incorporated with a bobber stopper for static presewntation.
