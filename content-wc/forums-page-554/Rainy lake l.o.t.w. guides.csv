1155544,cinderella,2009-12-21 21:32:00,2,"Id vouch for Jason John and #1 Oliver Gibbons. Or you could try Lake Despair lodge, Bill Godin also is excellent"
1154831,Guest,2009-12-17 21:14:00,0,"Looking for good guides on Rainy lake or Lake of the woods. My boss recommended shooting fish in a barrel guide service, said he's excellent, but I can't find any info on it. I'm not even sure wich lake or country. If anyone has any info please let me know. Thanks. Jim"
1154838,scotttheguide,2009-12-17 22:20:00,73,"I will get you some information. If I am booked I will refer you to some other good guides on LOTW. They are all good guides and more importantly good guys to be in the boat with all day, most of them are independents now. Please drop me a quick email.[email protected] - www.smittyscanadianfishing.com"

1154884,VernH,2009-12-18 07:11:00,1077,"With the new Coast Guard crackdown on guides, the few who go thru the procedure, training, etc. will be very busy. Book early. Make sure they have the right permits, etc. or be sure that you can get yhour deposit back.Big articles a few weeks ago in Mpls paper about the issue. Many guide flat out quit. Appears to be a nationwide issue."

1155061,Davis Viehbeck,2009-12-19 05:41:00,48,"Hi There,For Lake of the Woods consider Jeff Gustafson or Dave Bennett out of Kenora. Jeff's website is www.gussyoutdoors.com and Dave's is www.wildaccess.ca Both of these guys are young, hardcore and professional and will definitely put you on fish.On Rainy Lake, give Campfire Island (Wayne and Dean Howard) a ring. You can also try Labelle's or Camp Narrows Lodge up in Northwest Bay.-Davis Viehbeck"
1155154,Obabikon,2009-12-19 16:47:00,2370,"If you're going out of Morson, I'm happy to hook you up with a guide (as long as it fits their scheduel) Jason Gibbons and Bill Luney are my top two guides, but I have connections with Rueben, John and Oliver Gibbins if you know any of them."
1155197,WCoyote,2009-12-19 21:17:00,200,"If you want to be entertained while you catch fish look up Fairly Reliable Woody at the address below. You will have a great time on beautiful Rainy Lake. And: 1. you will stay on the lake 2. Grandma's a block away has wild rice pancakes 3. Woody's pub has cold beer plus an inordinate amount of nonsense 4. The ""muni"" (city owned bar) is 1 1/2 blocks away- has an inordinate amount of locals 5. The headwaters of the Rainy River is 125 yards away 6. All this in historic Ranier, MN (just east of IFalls) Tell Woody cousin Wells sent you. http://www.fairlyreliable.com/"
1155217,Chris K,2009-12-19 23:40:00,278,My vote goes out to Jeff Gustafson. He guides for everything and is a true professional. He fishes on Lake Of The Woods out of the Kenora or Clearwater Bay area and into Shoal Lake. Chris K
