Everything new, everything working, and doing things on your own schedule is nice. Obabikon fishing is great and the fishing on the big is too. Being "" stuck "" on an island for a week is awesome. The only thing I hate is leaving. We only have 7 months more to wait till we go."
1156732,Obabikon,2009-12-29 14:30:00,2370,We have decided to build an additional timeshare cabin (it's actually a lease in advance). It will be ready for 2011. It'll be set up for housekeeping... with purchasing meals in the lodge an option. It'll hold six people... PM or email me if you'd like more info.
