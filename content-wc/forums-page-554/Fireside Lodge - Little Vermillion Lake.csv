Anyways...I was wondering if anyone has been to this place or know of someone who's been. If you could let me know you experience I'd really appreciate it. Looking to maybe head up there some time and would like to get some feedback from those who have been there if possible.Thanks."

1156657,Jimmy Jig,2009-12-29 08:14:00,1905,"I think its the only camp on the lake. There is a State Park there also with ramps, camping, etc. I have never stayed at the lodge you are talking about but have heard good things about it. The lake is beautiful, super clear water and deep. I have fished it for lake trout and sm bass. There are muskies in the lake, lots of bass and some big trout. The trout season has been closed for about 8 years at least. No walleyes."

1156711,Guest,2009-12-29 12:07:00,0,"We stayed at Fireside Lodge three years in a row during the mid 90's.They have a very good fishery and top quality lodge.Alan & Audrey are great hosts and good people.The cabins,boats/motors and personel service are excellent.Other outfitters in the area do fish these lakes(as an option)but it's never crowded.During the times we stayed there we found very few people on the water at all.We have been there the last week of August and the first two weeks of September. I can give you an overview of our fishing experience.All waters are catch & release only. Little Vermilion is a very deep,clear water lake with plenty of structure.It has an upper & lower section each about 8 miles long and 1/2 mile wide.There are 3 other lakes connected to Little Vermilion accessed by creek portage.These are Maskinonge,Hooch & Cedarbough.There are also 3 more lakes accessed by land portage off the main lake.These are Closs,Booger & Terry lakes. We had are best action on Maskinonge & Hooch,we fished them 4 out of 6 days our first trip. Our results2 people) 37 Musky(avg.30""-35"") one 40"",39 Northern(avg.24""-32"") 1-38"" 1-391/2"",16 SM Bass(avg.14""-15"") 1-20"" 2-18"".From Little V. & Cedarbough 2 Musky36""&38"",10 Northern(1-38"") 11 SM Bass(1-19""). Our second year was much the same as we fished Maskinonge & Hooch for 3 days and explored more of the main lake.Some results:66 Musky(1-40"",1-38"") 32 Northern(all 28""-34"") 21 SM Bass (1-19""). Our third trip we got around to fishing Closs lake and probably had a hundred follows from Musky caught 4(32""-37"") and C+R 20 nice SM Bass.We fished the main lake too,but spent most of our time on Maskinonge with results much the same as before.There are Musky in the 45""-50""class we just did'nt land any.Also,there are no walleye on the main lakes but one portage lake does have fast action walleye & northern fishing.We were targeting Musky & Northern,if you went after SM Bass you could probably C+R 50-60 a day,no problem. Here's a good tip--fish smaller baits. 95% of our fish came on 1/2oz - 5/8oz(bass type)spinnerbaits or 1/2-3/4oz spoons and #5 Mepps. One of our favourite places I hope this helps you out,Good Luck."
