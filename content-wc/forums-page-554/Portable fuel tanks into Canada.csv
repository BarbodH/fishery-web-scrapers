1155112,Like2Fish,2009-12-19 10:43:00,210,PoochI've been crossing the border at Baudette or International Falls for the past 15 years or so. I have always brought in extra gas. Usually between 20 and 25 gallons in 5 gallons cans that I fill before I cross at the border. Never had a problem and was only asked one year if we were bringing in extra gas.Like2Fish

I left mine back in Illinois and bit the bullet and bought one up here, for transport purposes, but do not take it across the border. If they did not like it, the hassle may be more than it is worth."
