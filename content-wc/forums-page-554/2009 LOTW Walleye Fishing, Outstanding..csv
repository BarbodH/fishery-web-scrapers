1155337,GNO,2009-12-20 17:10:00,153,"What camp are you with and shows will you be at, maybe I can stop by and say hi if we are at the same shows."
1155353,scotttheguide,2009-12-20 19:25:00,73,"I will be at the ""Lets go Fishing Show"" in Collinsville, IL and the A.C. Show St.Charles, IL. The Madison Fishing Expo in Madison, WI.I have some other shows on the radar but I am still messing with the schedule. I meet with allot of people here in the Chicagoland area and go to many of the local Fishing Club meetings, dinners and fund raisers so my schedule is kind of busy. Plus I am working on some programs to sell some discounted trips to some of these clubs and other organizations so they can raise money for there organization and causes. I will be representing myself and the Motlong Familys, Rod and Reel Resort in Sioux Narrows, Ontario at the Shows."
1155465,bushy,2009-12-21 13:12:00,17,I have been fishing with my now 82 yr. old dad on Lac Seul the last 4 years out of Ear Falls. We have been doing pretty good but would like to try something else that has more variety. My Dad loves perch fishing. Could someone let me know where I could go on LOTW that I wouldn't have to travel far in the water with my 16' boat and 40 horse motor to get into some nice walleyes and jumbo perch. Thanks a bunch.
1155466,geareng,2009-12-21 13:13:00,335,Met scotttheguide for the first time last year and fished with him last year. I can tell you that everyone associated with his program are first rate people that went above and the beyond the call-of-duty for us. Had a great time!!
1156077,Guest,2009-12-25 13:19:00,0,"Hello Scott, My group has also based out of Souix Narrows the last 6 Mid Septembers (houseboat rental) and have had excellent success with 16- 24"" Walleyes. We are normally near the Yellow Girl area. We also get some nice Pike incedental to jigging for the Eyes. Talk about a blast..... catch a 38-40"" Northern on 8 lb and a jig! What a TEST! We never keep Pike and keep only the smaller Eyes to eat. Fishing has REALLY gotten better the last few years, I believe, but we can't seem to find any bigger Eyes or Crappies. I know seasonal patterns will dictate where to target larger fish, but is there something we are missing for those 8-10 lbers? Just can't seem to locate those..... Thanks in advance! JIMI R."
1156377,scotttheguide,2009-12-27 12:29:00,73,"Hey Jimi,Please Go to my profile and click on my web site link. Then you can send me an email and I won't have to tie up the message board. Thanks brother!A few others have sent me emails also, please be patient I will get back to you shortly, been busy with visiting relatives and finishing up some Outdoor Show preperations. I will get back to everybody."
1150668,scotttheguide,2009-11-28 14:59:00,73,"One of the best years ever for numbers and lots of 28"" - 31"" fish caught. Lots of bonus Jumbo Perch caught also. I was able to alternate between Perch and Walleye for shore lunch each day with some groups. Thank you Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. The years of creel limits and the slot limits are really starting to pay off big time. I even had some guests this year whos kids were catching walleyes off the dock every night after dinner. I am not talking little ones, some nice 20-21"" fish. Awesome.Allot of credit also goes back to the fishermen who fish LOTW. Taking pictures of the big fish and letting them go. Sweet!2010 is going to be awesome. Taking into account all of the above and add in the fact that pressure was way down this season, unfortunately just because of the way things are in the world today. Hope everybody gets to take there vacations this season."
1150672,Golden Eagle,2009-11-28 16:10:00,2642,That's good news.
1150791,Chris K,2009-11-29 13:23:00,278,I would have to agree that things were the best I have seen so far this summer. Chris K
1151099,geareng,2009-11-30 18:02:00,335,"We have gone to Lac Seul for years and were looking for a change due to costs of the houseboat and lack of people that could afford that route, so we tried LOTW (Canadian side) last spring for the first time. We caught Walleye, Sauger, Lake Perch, Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass and Crappie all in the same week, very diverse fishery. It was clasic lake structure fishing 101 to me, everything I 've learned about pattern fishing applied perfectly. Great Times!!!!"
1151483,scotttheguide,2009-12-02 13:57:00,73,"Geareng,Wait til you come up in June this year. The fishing is going to be out of control, maybe Don can better his 28.5"". LOTW is definately a structure related fishing lake for ""Big Eyes"". 16 -20""'s are all over the place which is great for the frying pan, but the big boys are on the structures and once you pattern them, you will catch them and it's not unusual to pull a lot of good fish off the same spot. Depending on the seasonal weather patterns those structures can be 4' - 45'. Thats what makes LOTW so great, it's challenging at times and rewarding. The good thing is why you are patterning the big ""Eyes"" you are going to catch allot of fish. Smallies, Largys, Pike, Jumbo Perch, Muskies and a lot of Walleyes.Can't wait next season, 163 Days and 8 Outdoors Shows away."
1152751,geareng,2009-12-07 17:54:00,335,"Well next year, I'd also like to try and get one of the quality Lake Trout that are in Whitefish Bay as well, we didn't really try that this year. At the lodge, we had the pleasure of having a meal prepared for us of a Lake Trout that a local fisherman had brought in, and I have to say it was one of the best fish meals I have ever had."
1152804,scotttheguide,2009-12-08 00:09:00,73,"I think I can arrange that for you, I just happen to know a spot or two where we can hook a few bonus Lakers for dinner."
1152961,Wall-i-Lama,2009-12-08 16:57:00,1524,"Scott, Have to agree. we had another great year at LOTW. Good quantity of walleye, northern, crappie and picked up a few lakers. The jumbo perch were awesome. Must be the pattern we are using (jigging), but we are doing REAL well on quantity of walleye, but are not getting any larger than 24"""". any ideas on where the big boys are? we fish out of soiux narrows. Thanks!"
1152976,scotttheguide,2009-12-08 17:53:00,73,"Wall i Lama, Cool name. Send me a PM with your email and I will see what I can do about pointing you in the direction of some ""Bigger Eyes""."
1155220,jake6767,2009-12-20 01:13:00,42,I am going to be on LOTW for a week in mid Aug 2010 for a houseboat trip. Any suggestion where we can get into some really good fishing for kids? We leave from Kenora.
