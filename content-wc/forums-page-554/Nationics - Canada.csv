I have had good success using it, but I have noticed they have a 2008 version (C4) and a 2009 version (C5). Has anyone used the newer cards and compared them to the 2006 version. If I call Nationics, I am sure they will say that they are the best thing since sliced bread, but I am trying to get some unbiased opinions."
1156489,guidedfishing,2009-12-28 06:51:00,531,"I have the 2008 card, and do not have any experience with the 2006 card. I have found some of the lakes off on the 2008 card by up to 400meters. (unusable) I have found others on the same card that are close to spot on. If your 2006 datum is on then your 2008 and 2009 will be on. If the lake was upgraded to a HD then maybe, if not I doubt you will see anything of great value that is different. I never did get a completely satisfactory answer from the rep when I asked if I upgraded to the 2009 chip did the lake in question have updated datum. good luck GF"

Don't know why they omitted the river when the systems connect, So obviously there will be flaws in any version or missing data but I think they TRY to do the best they can with the available data. Red Lake data was compiled in the 50s so take it from there. What was the technology they used back then to map the lake bottoms."
1156715,IAranger,2009-12-29 12:29:00,352,I have had the exact same with both 2006 and 2008 versions some places they were great and others they are worthless .
1156795,geareng,2009-12-29 20:23:00,335,Sounds like to me I should just stay with what I have......... Thanks for the input!!

1156947,fire105,2009-12-30 17:31:00,40,"I have an 06 chip and had no prblems getting around the lake. Most to all hazads are marked with in a couple feet of the obstruction. I thought it was a very useful tool as to getting around the lake. Would not go on the lake for any distance with out the chip. The problem i have is using the chip on the eastern part of the lake were Abrams and Minintoka run together ,my map needs an up date to show all the hazards. this were you have to shell out another $140 dollars to by an up dated chip. Why can't they just down load the maps on to your older model chip?"
1157021,geareng,2009-12-31 07:53:00,335,"I also used the 06 chip at Lac Seul and found it pretty accurate. With regards to the updating of the disk, are you first sure that the information you want is on the 09 disk? Software companies make ther mponey by doing updates and having people buy those updates because they are better. In the past Navionics has deals for doing an upgrade where they may give you say $50 for your old chip when you buy a new one. Looking on their website, they have a $50 dollar rebate that expires today which would bring your cost down to $99. That is why I have been trying to find out exactly what has been updated from the 06 disk to the 09 disk, to buy the new disk with the deal that exists."
