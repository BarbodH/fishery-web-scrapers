548482,Guest,2005-05-27 17:36:00,0,"I've fished sen bay the last three years and my Dad has fished it for at least ten years. Always the week after Memorial Day. Last year was our worst year but still did o.k. We always use the deception bay launch. It takes about a 30 minute boat ride to get to sen bay. We use crawlers exclusively; on spinners, harnesses, or sometimes on jigheads. I'm starting to get excited, we will get up there on tuesday! Has the rain stopped? What about water temps and levels?"
548483,wooglin,2005-05-27 17:59:00,371,"How about a little hookup on that Deception Bay Launch? I know some info. has been posted alreay, but the more the merrier! Good luck, let me know how you do, we will be up there in about 28 days!"
549054,Guest,2005-06-11 11:29:00,0,"Lac Suel water depth is up a lot more than last year. Broad Lake, Makenzie bay, South Bay, Sun Light are all hitting well. Makenzie seems to be producing the best. Caught some 45 inch norther and close to 30 inch walleye in some of these places. Water temps are a bit cooler and it was really rainy. Have to go to deeper water this year if you want the big boys. 20 to 30 feet unless it warms up. You can get nice eaters in the sallows. 17-18 inchers in 5-10 feet of water.Norther fishing was a little slow but should pick up good in the next couple of weeks.We still caugh some nice ones in the upper 40's but they get a lot bigger."
