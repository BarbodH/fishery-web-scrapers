548990,Guest,2005-06-09 12:20:00,0,"I just got back from Minaki June 4th, fishing out of Birch Island Resort with a group of 11. The fishing was good. I caught around 160-180 smallmouth, with one 19.5 inches, two 18 inchers, and four 17 inchers. The largest walleye in the group was 30 inches. Plenty of smaller walleye caught, most not in the 13.8-17.7 inch slot size. The largest pike was 36 inches, which is down from the usual 38-39 inchers we usually catch. The smaller pike were everywhere, and we couldn't keep them off the hook. I caught crappie up to 13 inches in size on sliders in brush, mostly near beaver dams in 3-4 feet of water. A few 11-12 inch perch were caught. The weather was great. The water temp declined from upper 50's-lower 60's Monday and Tuesday to 53 yesterday. The air temperatures was 70-72 degrees the last 3 days, so perhaps the high winds of Wednesday and Thursday mixed the water up. The group caught around 2500-3000 fish (all species) for the week. All in all a great week. Good fishing to all, Don Another post: Aaron, Most of the smallmouth were 3-5 feet of water. 90% of the fish in the 14-19 inch range had eggs still. Some in the 14-17 inch range did not, but were they males? A few smallmouth were 1-2 feet. There were about 10% that were 6-8 feet of water. The highest water temp in some bays of Big Sand was 66 degrees, but after 2 days of wind, that had come down. On Gunn Lake when I arrived, the water temp was 54.4 degrees on the main lake and 57 in bays. This came down to 53 degrees 2 days ago. There were some times of the day when mostly what we caught were 11-13 inch males, then the bigger females would start hitting. My best afternoon, I caught three 17 inchers, two 18 inchers and one 19.5 incher. That 19.5 incher was loaded with eggs, and looked to be pushing 4.5 - 5 pounds. Good luck, Don"

It seems like with the colder temperatures that the areas near the power lines would be good fishing. In years past when it has been cold we haven't done as well out on Big Sand. Also, I have never used minnows at Minaki. What kind do people generally use and where do you buy them? Thanks."
549000,IaCraig,2005-06-09 14:57:00,434,"I haven't been up this year yet, but I agree that this part of June Cobalt Narrows (bottom of Gunn lake by the Hydro Lines) and the shallower channels around Little Sand should be the ticket. I have never been much of a fan for fishing the RR tressel, but that can be great anytime. Have fun! IaCraig"
549001,Guest,2005-06-09 15:08:00,0,"Never had luck with minnows either...generally lindy and a leech or crawler for us. Had most of our success on little sand last trip. Going over my list for the millionth time now, can't wait to get up there- bm"
549003,Mille Lacs Guy,2005-06-09 16:57:00,401,"What do you guys consider little sand? I'm not to familiar with the area yet. I do know of some spots such as Deadmans Island, Burnt Island, Wildedge, etc. Could you give me some reference from those spots where little sand is?"
549008,Guest,2005-06-09 20:06:00,0,"little sand is just south of big sand, hit the channels on the east side....get a map and look for fire island, always done well there, good luck"
549056,Guest,2005-06-11 11:44:00,0,"We've always had good eaters just south of Sugarloaf Island in the channel between the island and the shore, and there is a point just south of that that is good for nice walleye. Greene Island has several humps located all around it, sometimes the walleye will congregate there. On Little Sand, head towards the narrows going into Rough Rock, and take a right just before going into the narrows. There are two islands on the north end of Little Sand that have some deeper points that are pretty good. If you go into the narrows and the current permits, there is a point just before you make the last north turn that can be fished up and down it with jigs. We've caught some very nice walleye there--but the current must be down. If you go thru the narrows just before you get into Rough Rock, there are some island with points to your left(west). Fish them with jigs up and down the point, there are gravel and sand beds there that hold some very nice walleye, but be prepared for a musky or two to help themselves to your walleye as you reel them up. There are some islands on the west end of Rough Rock that have some nice rock piles that can be fished. Look at 18 to 22' for walleye on these humps. Good Luck Chuck"
