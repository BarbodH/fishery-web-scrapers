Having fished several northern camps our group has found that their charts are wrong. Charts show that a 27-28"" walleye would weigh about eight pounds. Upon catching a fish that length, immediately hang that same fish on a digital scale and it will be in the 6.5# range. These northern lakes don't really have ""fat"" walleyes like you see further south. Plus, a fish of that length just looks ""old"" because they probably are! I really don't have a question here. Just something I was thinking about. Pooch"
