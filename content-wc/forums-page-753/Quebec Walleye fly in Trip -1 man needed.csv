549086,Guest,2005-06-12 08:25:00,0,What outfitter do you stay with at Lake Herbert? Do they have an e-mail address?

549104,WillieB,2005-06-12 17:34:00,292,Are they the outfitter who have or 5 cabins on the lake?
549105,Guest,2005-06-12 17:49:00,0,willie- yes they are the only outfitter on lake and they have about 5 or 6 cabins? have you been there- why do you ask?
549185,WillieB,2005-06-13 20:12:00,292,"The name of the lake rang a bell...very few ""fly-in only outfitter on the lake"" scenarios in Quebec compared to Ontario. Also, rarely do I read of anyone flying out of LVI. Being from Upper Bucks County I find no need to fly out of Philly...he11, it's worth an extra $50 on a ticket to have almost zero wait thru security or check-in. It really is a gem of an airport. We always use LVI to connect with Toronto (if we're going on to Timmins, Cochrane and the James Bay region) or go to Chicago and then on to Winnipeg (if we're going to Kenora, Ear Falls, or Red Lake."
