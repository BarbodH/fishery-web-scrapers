The collision, which sent six people to Lake of the Woods Hospital with non-life threatening injuries, occurred near Yellow Girl Point 28 km southeast of Kenora, OPP Const. Sue Cain said. Residents of Sioux Narrows said the two boats, a 21-ft. Lund carrying five people from Totem Lodge, and a 21-ft. Princecraft, carrying three people from White Birch Lodge, were travelling in opposite directions when they collided. Both boats were extensively damaged, the police said. Marnie Tebben, the owner of White Birch Lodge in Sioux Narrows, said just one of her guests was injured. The guest, who injured his rotary cuff, is out of the hospital and doing well, she said. The man operating the Lund boat was employed as a guide by Totem Lodge, she said. The Totem boat ran into us, she said, adding the day was rainy and foggy. Bill Haight, the owner of Sioux Narrows Marina, said when it's raining and the boats are moving, it's hard to figure out where you are. You gotta watch, eh? he said. I always say all boats should have windshield wipers like a car. Wayne Helliar, the owner of Helliar's Resort in Nestor Falls, said he'd heard the Lund boat went over the top of the Princecraft boat. Both boats, he said, had windshield wipers. But with the windows fogged over and the boat tops down, it's hard to see."

Just seems like alot of bad news recently, the drowings at Wobigoon and now this. This one though, could have easily been avoided had either boat been paying more attention to their surroundings."
548991,Guest,2005-06-09 12:26:00,0,"Absolutely!! Regardless of the area or the weather, a collision of this nature requires lack of attention on the point of both boat drivers."
548995,Guest,2005-06-09 13:28:00,0,I always use rainX on the windshield to keep it somewhat clear anyway. I dont think some people ever clean their windshield
549007,Guest,2005-06-09 19:40:00,0,"Based on my knowledge of the Totem guides, they may want to cut down on their visits to 'Bomber Bay'...just a thought!"
549149,Guest,2005-06-13 13:12:00,0,"I know the Totem driver personally, He is one of the more experienced guys on the lake, that's how I know it was just a freak accident."
