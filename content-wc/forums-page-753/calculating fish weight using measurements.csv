549010,grt1,2005-06-09 21:15:00,259,"I caught a big trout today and when I went to the MNR in Red Lake to discuss the correct method of measuring the fish, they asked me what it weighed. I didn't have a scale that went over 20 pounds so a camp owner that was in the office told me that to get a weight for the fish you multiply the length by the length by the girth (using inches) and divide by 800. This method is supposed to put you in the ball park by about a pound either way. Does anyone out there know if this is correct or is there another way to get a better(closer) weight? My fish was 37.5 inches long and had a girth of 21 inches. Using the method above it works out to 36.9 pounds. Does this sound right?"
549016,phishfearme,2005-06-10 08:36:00,1242,"this weight sound very high. look at the following post:https://walleyecentral.com/dc/dcboard...6224&mode=full i would think this fish would be in the 20 pound area - but a real beauty no matter what it weighs. congrats, phish"
549020,Snowball,2005-06-10 11:56:00,28,"Found this formula doing a search of the web. Formula to calculate the weight of a lake trout based on length and girth measurement, Length x girth x girth divided by 800 = lake trout's weight. Hope this helps. Regards, Snowball"
549027,grt1,2005-06-10 16:13:00,259,"That looks more reasonable to what I have discovered in various other sights, this way the fish I caught would be between 20 &21 pounds. This is more like I thought but who do you believe, yourself or the game wardens that do the fish thing every day? Thanks for the formula"
549043,fishinnut,2005-06-11 06:57:00,642,Using the length x girth x girth formula your fish would weigh approx. 26.07 lbs.
549062,bassinboy,2005-06-11 16:49:00,18,Here is a neat link that I keep in my favorites to calculate weight.http://www.bassresource.com/bassfish...alculator.html
549071,Snowball,2005-06-11 20:51:00,28,"37.5x21x21=16537.5 Divide by 800= 20.671875 I get the same answer when I use the fish weight calculator as shown on the previous post:http://www.bassresource.com/bassfish...alculator.html Regards, Snowball"
549077,grt1,2005-06-12 06:40:00,259,Thanks that is pretty cool and quick
