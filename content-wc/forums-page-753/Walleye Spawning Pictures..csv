548779,Guest,2005-06-03 12:04:00,0,"Those pictures were taken on Oliver Lake, just west of Thunder Bay, the first week of May this year. If you want more detail, they were taken by the site administrator for fishingthunderbay.com, known on there as Mahumba. I'm sure you go to the site and post a question or email him, he will be glad to give you more detail."
