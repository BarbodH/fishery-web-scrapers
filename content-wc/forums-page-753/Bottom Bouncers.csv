Not sure what depths you are using the 1/2 ounce weights, but at 30 feet I find that keeping such a light weight on the bottom is difficult with much speed at all. If you are just drifting in a moderate wind, 1/2 ounces work fine. I bounce at what I would consider a ""moderate"" speed using my bow trolling motor ... never looked at my GPS to see exactly what that is ... but even at that speed 1-ounce weights seem to lift off the bottom and lose the 45 degree line angle pretty easily. We have gone to 1.5 ounce for my aft partner and 2 to 2.5 to 3 ounces for me in the bow to keep my bouncer from getting too far aft and tangling the other lines back there. It seems to work. The first couple of days fishing, however, are tough on forearms when you are working anything over 2 ounces and are not used to it."
548970,Pooch,2005-06-08 21:11:00,4619,"Besides removing the front treble on (two treble) Rapalas, cut one of the hooks off of the rear treble (I cut the one hanging down). This keeps them from picking up any debris like sticks and dead weeds when bumping the bottom. Does not seem to make any difference on hook ups. When fish hit the crank they are feeding and hit it hard. None of that tap-tap stuff, just pow and they are on. Actually, I think removing one hook on the rear treble helps rebalance the rapala when the front treble is gone. Pooch"

The difference is that bouncing moves much quicker, consequently the heavier weights to keep the line angle and contact with the bottom. Most all of the time spinners are used with approximately five beads. Three hook snells are probably the best. The Lindy Rig, a much slower search tool is used after fish are found and a bouncer is used to find fish and find them fast. Although somewhat related, the two actually function quite differently. Lindy Rigging was done mainly back trolling and bouncing works best from a bow mount although a creative angler can work it a variety of ways."
549074,Guest,2005-06-12 02:35:00,0,Thanks Phil for the good explanation! What you say makes sense.
549082,Guest,2005-06-12 07:55:00,0,"I remember when bouncers came on the scene in northern Wisconsin. It was the late 80's, there was no PWT or FLW, just the MWC and it didn't pay much for winning either. Two old boys from the Dakotas, Mike McClelland and Bob Probst burst on the scene with equipment that made the pros from Minnesota laugh (Minnesota is where the walleye was invented). These Dakota boys said that boats were not meant to go backwards and that fish were to be found fast so you could go about the business of catching them. They didn't win every tournament, but enough to get famous----really famous. They taught the boys from Minnesota, and Wisconsin a whole new game. There were still times when it paid to use another method and it was these times that McClelland and Probst lost their advantage, but they became as adept at these other methods as the locals became at theirs. The playing field started to become level. It was about this time while fishing an MWC on the Cisco chain that I first tried bouncing, then on Lac Seul. Not good on the Cisco, but great on the Seul. Caught more fish over 25"" on one trip then I had in my whole life. I was hooked. And it worked just as well on the Woods and Eagle, St Joseph too. For 15 years, I never looked back. I learned new things about bouncing every year, refinements, the fine points. It's a book in itself. It's not the end all but it should be a part of your arsenal and frankly you will never be world class without it. Enjoy the great outdoors."
549098,Guest,2005-06-12 13:17:00,0,"Phil, I enjoyed reading your report. I've have fished Lac Seul with bottom bouncers and have had GOOD LUCK ! How would you rate St Joseph to Lac Seul as far as walleye fishing ? A few years back St. Joe was getting good reports, but has died off. I am not willing to trade Lac Seul for another lake without some solid reports !! As far as bottom bouncers go check out Todays Tackle and Gander Mtn. Gander has one by Apex Walleyes Inc? with a float that will not tip when you stop. Todays Tackle will not fall over and you can change the weight. Thank's"
548824,Guest,2005-06-04 20:03:00,0,"I'm hearing alot about ""bottom bouncers."" Anyone have any ideas on how to use them? How long should the leader be if using a spinner blade with one? What size hook on spinner blade? Any info. would be appreciated."
548825,rebelrn2001,2005-06-04 21:14:00,1563,"Leader would be about 3' (that's about what I use for walleye) and the hook would be #4. I try to be sure the leader is of less strength than the main line so if (when) you snag, you save the bottom bouncer."
548831,retire55,2005-06-05 05:03:00,1029,An article by Phil Rolfe provides lot of valuable information about bottom bouncing - see http://www.justfishontario.com/botto...ing_a_to_z.htm

548869,Guest,2005-06-06 12:31:00,0,"We've always used lindy walking weights (1/4 - 1/2 oz)with a hook and bead, sometimes spinner too. Can someone help me understand the pro's and con's of bottom bouncers and the walking weights? It seems that a 1oz-3oz weight is overkill, unless you crank up your speed? Thanks and good fishing and good friends!"
548874,IaCraig,2005-06-06 14:23:00,434,"In real rocky areas, bottom Bouncers are much more snag free for me. Also I feel as the the stiff wires bang along the bottom they give more action to the bait than walking sinkers. I use mostly 1 - 1 1/2 oz bouncers with live bait, but this year I am getting more into using stick baits behind them so I am stocking up on 2 & 3 oz ones so I can cover more area faster. IaCraig"
548875,Guest,2005-06-06 14:28:00,0,"I started to pull Rapala's behind bouncers on Lac Seul a few years ago. They worked great, but with the trebles, I foul-hooked a lot of fish in the eyes and gills. I like to fish but not mutilate, so I am back to single hook spinners with leech or minnow."
548899,Brian_MN,2005-06-07 12:40:00,738,Taking the front treble off the Rap really helps with that problem. All of your fish should be lightly hooked in the lip if you use just the rear treble.
