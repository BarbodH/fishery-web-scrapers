549051,Guest,2005-06-11 10:19:00,0,"My Bass Pro Visa charges 3% across the board. I spent nearly three week in Canada and it amounts to quite abit of money. They call it ""Foreign Tranaction Fee FTF"". Visa used to charge a hidden charge of 1% and I never really noticed it, but 3% I notice. At least now they will show it on your bill where before they would sneak the 1% through. When exchanging American $$ to Canadian $$ I don't know of any place where there isn't at least 2% charge for the transaction. I'm thinking about writing checks on our bank and seeing how that comes out. If it is for the amount, surely they can't figure out a way to add anymore to an already written check. eyesnatcher"
549057,Trailerguy,2005-06-11 12:45:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I've found that Canadian business are reluctant to take checks. Even Walmart in Dryden won't take a check written on a local bank, they want plastic or cash. Another pitfall is writing a check on a US bank to a business in Canada, you have the old currency conversion game just like with cash."
549061,bassinboy,2005-06-11 16:45:00,18,"bassinboy Just curious, What is the current exchange rate? We will be heading up in a couple weeks. Thanks"
549063,tjsker,2005-06-11 16:50:00,301,"http://www.x-rates.com/ I also take a little Canadian cash up with me just for little expenses. Some banks charge a fee, but mine does not because I have an account with them."
549012,Guest,2005-06-10 06:25:00,0,"n an upcoming trip we'll be spending a night in Thunder Bay where we're planning on picking up a few food items at a grocery store, licenses, and bait, with perhaps a little tackle shopping at Canadian Tire. Is it safe to assume I can do all this on a credit card (or with US currency) or should I make plans to get canadian currency. Also, what types of business hours do Canadian establishments typically keep? I'm expecting we'll be doing our shopping ~ from 5-9PM on a Friday evening. Have to hit the road very early Saturday morning to get to our pickup point on time. Thanks"
549013,Trailerguy,2005-06-10 07:10:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]Credit cards and US currency will not be a problem although you may not get a favorable exchange rate from some businesses. Most Canadian Tire Stores will be open.
549031,Guest,2005-06-10 20:18:00,0,"I thought when you use a credit card, it is automatically adjusted to the correct rate. Ron"
549038,Guest,2005-06-10 21:32:00,0,"Unless things have changed, we've always gotten the precise exchange at the time of the transaction. As for business hours, in Quebec anyway, they seem to be civilized in terms of keeping pretty much the standard hours you'd find in comparably sized US towns i.e. the small towns roll up the sidewalks early, the bigger towns offer 24/7 markets."
549039,Guest,2005-06-11 00:30:00,0,Use your credit card when possible. It will always give you a better exchange rate than any store or bank... As an american living in England temporarily I know this all to well.
549042,Gary_IA,2005-06-11 06:33:00,144,"Previous threads on this board mention that some of the credit cards charge a foreign currency exchange fee of 3%. Someone mentioned there was such a charge on his Mastercard, someone else mentioned that his Cabela's Visa didn't charge such a fee. I would use a credit card that didn't charge such a fee, if I had one."
549045,Trailerguy,2005-06-11 07:38:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I use The Royal Bank Of Canada, which has offices in many towns in NWO, including Dryden and Fort Francis. They are hooked via computor, and their exchange rate changes through the business day, they trade currency like you and I trade stocks. In this day and age that is the case of most Canadian banks. Most credit card companys also trade on currency, but Visa and mastercards new policy reflects a 3% fee and useing the day they process rather than the day of the transaction. By not useing the actual day you make the purchase they have the opportunity to ""fudge"" it in their favor. A fraction of a cent can be a lot of money at the end of the year for them. I'll stick with the bank, and get the most current rate, without a penalty."
549046,Guest,2005-06-11 08:02:00,0,"Actually, the fee on VISA and Mastercard varies by provider. Many ARE 3% (so in fact the exchance is .03 worse than you think) but some are only 1% (mine, as it turns out). But they ALL charge that fee now, anywhere from 1 to 3 %. In my case, I'll pay a one percent fee for saftey and convenience. But when it gets to three pecent..."
549047,yknotfrank,2005-06-11 08:23:00,107,"Cabela's charges 1%, just checked my bill."
549049,Guest,2005-06-11 09:42:00,0,"Just checked my capital one visa and they also charge 1%, they set me up for the vacation time we will be in Canada so there are no problems when we use the card up there. We will just use the credit card instead of converting at a bank as it will be more convenient. Ron"
