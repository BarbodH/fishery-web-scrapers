I wondering if anyone goes through the pelican chutes to lac suel? If so is it more difficult than the abram/miniki chutes and how does water level effect it? Never tried it and always feared doing it. The best way is to follow someone through the first few times and I won't try it based on some posts here, but was just looking for a little insight. Thanks."
