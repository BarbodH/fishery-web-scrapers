It is either that they have an extremely large amount of product or that nobody is buying something that we would all rather catch and eat then buy at the grocery store. Let's hope for the latter."
549102,Guest,2005-06-12 15:17:00,0,actually my supplier is still charging about $7.40 per pound wholesale. i don't sell them and never will. your guy must have been using them as a loss leader.
