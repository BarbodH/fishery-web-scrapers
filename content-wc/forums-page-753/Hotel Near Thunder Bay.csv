549092,Guest,2005-06-12 11:57:00,0,We are crossing at Thunder Bay. We have never been this way (we usually cross at Int. Falls). We were thinking of staying in Grand Portage MN. but the only hotel we could find is the Grand Portage Lodge/Casino. They are kind of expensive (about $100/night). Does anyone know of an inexpensive hotel in the area? We would like to stay in the US and cross in the early morning. Also if you have any suggestions on crossing at Thunder Bay it would be appreciated.
