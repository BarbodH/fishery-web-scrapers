549076,Guest,2005-06-12 05:33:00,0,Can you take a bow and arrow oner the border? We have had problems with bears in our camp and would feel more secure if there was a bow in camp?

549085,Trailerguy,2005-06-12 08:24:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]Obviously there are bear hunters that take bows into Canada during bear season. But not only are you likely to get static at the border at this time of year. How do you think you'd explain to the warden that a bear attacked you and you just happened to have a bow in your hand at that moment? Nusiance bears cannot be killed without notifing the MNR with in 48 hrs. And if a bear does charge you are your skills so great it won't mual you anyway? Get a can of bear guard at Canadian Tire and use it as a last resort only.

There can be exceptions to this. There are times when bears become conditioned to continually returning to popular camp sites as a result of other groups carelesness with their food, etc. -Davis"
549091,Guest,2005-06-12 11:04:00,0,If your camping make sure you don't leave tackle boxes where the bears can easily get to them......I learned the hard way one year.
549103,Guest,2005-06-12 15:47:00,0,"Why play around with a bow? Might as well haul the arsenal across the border and do the job right. These bears are real killers. They're notorious for tearing entire campsites to shreds and swallowing people whole after hours of bloody torture. They'll sometimes come armed. (They are funded, after all, by the Rockefellers and the Trilateral Commission) They'll eat the menfolk, guzzle all the liquor, smoke your tobacco and drive off with the women and children. (Yes...they have learned how to drive.)The horror...the horror. What's worse is that I hear that most of them are Republicans. Death by arrow is too good for them. It's war. Kill. And run from the squirrels. They eat nuts."
