549115,Guest,2005-06-12 22:50:00,0,I have eaten at three different places in Ear Falls in the last three years. Take a can of Alpo and save yourself the $10. Hands down the worst food I have eaten anywhere. Thankfully the fishing more than makes up for it.
549116,Guest,2005-06-13 04:39:00,0,"To bad you had three bad experiences. The NEW owners of the hotel 105 bar and grill do have a terrific place to eat. I hope for them it dosen't take long to live down the reputation of previous owners. Let's give them a chance. All of out guest that have gone there, were very pleasantly surprised with decor as well as food. There is also another resturant in town that has changed hands, Pape's,( also very good) I always wonder why only the bad experiences get posted here. Anyone else try the Great places to eat in Ear Falls? As always welcome to Canada, and happy fishing. Glad your here. Pat"
549182,Hammerhead Herb,2005-06-13 19:52:00,259,"Pat, As the originator of the this posting, I really never had a problem with the food that I got in town. The breakfasts were hearty and the dinner sandwhiches were tasty. My problem is that I can't get into Ear Falls until late in the evening (between 9 and 10) and find that all the restaurants are closed. Do you know of any that are open about this time in the evening? By the way, where is Pape's? Also, does Ear Falls have a military veterans club and are US veterans welcome?"
548534,Hammerhead Herb,2005-05-30 10:01:00,259,We are coming in late in the evening on a Fri night in July. We need a restaurant that will still be open about 9PM. So: 1. Does anyone have any suggestions? 2. Does Ear Falls have a military veterans organization and are US military veterans welcome to come in? 3. Any comments about Smileys Restaurant in Ear Falls? 4. Did the Northland get their liqour license back? 5. Any comments about the Sunset Restaurant and Tavern on 105 near Perrault Falls?
548552,Trailerguy,2005-05-30 19:00:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]The Sunset in Perrault Falls would be questionable at 9:00 pm, most week nights. I was in there a few weeks ago and some local folks came in at 8:00 PM. They were told to eat fast because he wanted to close up. Gary divorced his ex a couple of winters ago, he's trying to sell the place and wants to move back to Manitoba. In the mean time he's opening up ay 6:00 AM and has trouble finding help. You might want to stop in Vermillion Bay to eat, it would be earlier in the evening. If you want call the Northland, it's 807-222-3374"
548604,Guest,2005-05-31 13:28:00,0,I think the worst meal I ever had in my life was in Ear Falls a couple years ago. We stop and eat and sleep in Dreyden. The food is better and motels are better and cheaper. Selection is much better.
548641,Rich J,2005-05-31 22:27:00,65,"Herb The Northland has new owners and the food is excellent. We ate there last week. They are remodeling and also have a bar so liquor should not be a problem.

548647,Guest,2005-06-01 06:06:00,0,We always fished other part of Lac Seul...Staying at Evergreen this year. Is this restaurant near Evergreen? Looking for that place in the middle of the week where we can go and have a beer and watch a little sports updates on TV. Is this the best spot for that near Ear Falls?
548669,Hammerhead Herb,2005-06-01 09:39:00,259,The Trillium is better than the Northland as I recollect.
548673,Guest,2005-06-01 10:15:00,0,"If I recall correctly, both the Trillium and Northlander are only about a mile or so from Evergreen. I don't know about the TV in either, but I know they have food and the drink options."
548723,Hammerhead Herb,2005-06-02 09:35:00,259,The Trillium had a TV in its bar.
548927,Guest,2005-06-08 07:20:00,0,I have heard the trillium gave up it's liquor licence and has shut it's bar down. the little business it did wasn't worth the insurance premium. The Northland is now called Highway 105 and is wide open with the restaurant and bar. the food is supposedly excellent and plentyfull according to my neighbour who eats there regularly.
548946,Hammerhead Herb,2005-06-08 12:32:00,259,What time does the restaurant close?
