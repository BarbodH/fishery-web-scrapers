We crossed at Pigeon River on Saturday, June 2. The border person was very polite. He asked the normal questions - live bait, alcohol, gas, weapons, etc. Didn't ask about the DWI, but you know he knows it because they can read your record once they get your passport #. We were not pulled inside and we were through in about 3 minutes. BTW, the fishing was awesome! Hammered the 'eyes, northerns, and lakers every day all week. It was great to be back in Canada after missing last year!"

1448335,Guest,2012-06-12 12:41:00,0,"Well...six of us crossed the border last week, two with DUI's...one about 1 month old, the other about 5 1/2 years old. There were two lines of cars at the FF border. We got in the SLOW line. Apparently this officer was VERY thorough. We gave her all six passports, she scanned each of them in her system. She wanted to know our license plate number because her camera could not see it. We didn't know it, so she got out of her booth to read it. She then got out of her booth again to verify the pictures matched our faces on all the passports. She asked me where we were going, how long we were staying, any alcohol (which we purposely had none), any tobacco, what each of our occupations were and how long its been since we last visited Canada. Apparently satisfied, we were allowed to enter and go on our merry and VERY relieved way. A couple differences with our situation: we hired a shuttle to transport us to Atikokan where we entered Quetico park and then paddled all the way south to Ely. So none of us were driving our own vehicles. Also, we brought no alcohol with us over the border. I have no idea if passport scans show DUI offenses. I am guessing not, but we were never asked for our driver's licenses."
1439604,@Lunker,2012-05-23 15:51:00,835,"Unfortunately.........1) Even if you call and ask someone, I would bet at least a dollar you're getting that person's ""personal interpretation"" which could very well not jive with another person's. Like the adage says....""if you don't like the answer, ask someone else."" Oftentimes the left hand has absolutely no clue what the right hand.... If nothing else, I would ask the name of the person you got the information from so you can drop it at the border if necessary, although I pessimistically don't think it would do any good.2) Even though the ""federal government"" is in charge, I have had first-hand experiences where the local gendarme is empowered to make a personal decision, even if it doesn't jive with that made in Toronto...or Montreal or wherever. I'm just sayin'Good luck. This is one of the reasons I drink very little to nothing at all when I'm outside the house....specifically to retain my ability to cross the border. Wouldn't want to lose that."
1439620,v-bay gord,2012-05-23 16:42:00,3168,"The border officials are given the ability to use their own discretion on who is eligible and who is not. The issue here is minor criminality........and are you going to present a potential danger to citizens in Canada? If your single charge was a dui, then likely not. If your single charge was that you assualted someone, then potentially the discretion of the official may not be favourable........"
1442151,Guest,2012-05-29 13:44:00,0,"A group of six is planning to cross the border next Monday at Fort Frances. Two of us have one DUI. I asked the immigration officer whether we would be allowed entry. He asked if we'd be fishing and if we were using an outfitter, which must make a difference. We are fishing obviously, but not using an outfitter, which I told him. His response was the decision would be made at the border, but we would most likely be allowed to enter after paying the ""processing fee""...which I believe is $200. So, we'll see what happens."
1442167,Jball,2012-05-29 14:11:00,23,Lowbid - let me know what happens. We have 6 of us going up in 2 weeks 1 with a 4 year old dui. We called as well but they told us a similar story but that most likely the dui guy would not be allowed through. We are going to try anyway. If they turn him around we will just all fish in MN.
1442222,Guest,2012-05-29 15:35:00,0,we will not be returning until June 10th. Hopefully all goes well and they have become more lenient.
1442666,Jball,2012-05-30 10:22:00,23,I figured if things don't go well I would be hearing from you before then
1446121,jball82,2012-06-07 09:16:00,2,"The big day has finally come. Will my buddy get turned back and cause us to cancel our trip for the second year in a row, or will the crossing go without a hitch. TBD....standby for an update tomorrow afternoon"
1446146,Perch56,2012-06-07 10:25:00,17,Please post as many details as you can about your experience.Did they ask about any convictions? My quess is that they will have the details based on the passport....but I hate to assume.Did you have to prove that you will be using a outfitter?If they do pull your group aside....was there any thing that you did that helped the move the process along or anything that you would recommend that others be prepared for?Thanks!!!
1446860,Jball,2012-06-09 04:53:00,23,"*update* We made it across. It was a very interesting experience and one that I think is misunderstood. Our group was pulled aside and told to go inside to talk to immigration. It was a lengthy process and also rather intimidating up until the last few min. That said, we were treated well and with respect. Since I am typing this from my phone I will have to keep it short and reply later with a more detailed r"
1446939,bricken,2012-06-09 10:04:00,14,thanks for the update jball!! we will be headed north on Thursday. would love to hear more details. thanks again.
1436800,Mark R,2012-05-17 09:55:00,1538,Is anyone planning on trying to cross the border and take advantage of the new guidline regarding one time offense such as a DUI? I would be interested in learning how that works out.
1436805,@Lunker,2012-05-17 10:09:00,835,"As I understand it, getting this secondhand from Gerry Cariou (sp?), director of Sunset Country in NW Ontario, the Ministry has ""retracted"" their promise to go easy on DUI offenders. Friend of mine spoke directly to him at the Mpls sport show. Apparently Gerry was pi$$ed enough to chew customs badges. Perhaps Gerry is reading this and would care to respond or others have inside information?"
1438277,Mark R,2012-05-21 09:31:00,1538,any updates?
1438298,drlee,2012-05-21 09:58:00,409,"I wish I had an update. I am pretty darn tired of the Ontario province treating visitors the way they do on this issue. Just so we are clear: I have NEVER had a DUI...in fact, I have been driving since I was 14 (now 66) and I have never even had a moving violation. So, I have no personal ax to grind. Also, I recognize that the law in Ontario is their prerogative and that we can choose not to go there if we are adamant about the law being unreasonable. For example, given China's human rights record, I would not spend a thin dime in that country. That being said, the Province, especially given the economy in NW Ontario and the heavy tourist traffic that crosses from the US, owes the tourists a clear and well-defined law. Apparently, Ontario law makers are remarkably unable to use our common language to communicate with people who spend millions of dollars visiting their beautiful country. If the law was presented in this fashion, just as an example, I would certainly be relieved... 1. DUI within a five year span, no entry...period. 2. DUI more than five years old, but not yet ten years old, entry allowed, but not permitted to operate a vehicle in Ontario. 3. DUI after 10 years have passed, rights restored. 4. Second DUI on record, no entry...ever. I will possibly get blasted for this, especially by some of our Canadian friends, but so be it. I have always been treated very well in Ontario...or I would not go there. This summer, another month in Sunset Country. This absolute nonsense of not knowing until you hit the border what law may be enforced is just flat stupid."
1438376,Jball,2012-05-21 12:22:00,23,"Well buddy my group is right there with ya. We planned a trip last year only to cancel 2 weeks prior because one of my buddies has a refusal to blow from 4 years ago. He paid his dues via a good attorney and it does not show up under his criminal record, but does on his driving record. Needless to say he was never ""convicted"" of a crime, according to the database at least. This year after they passed this: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resourc...2012/ob389.asp The outfitter called us and coaxed us to give it a try again. Basically, we are heading up there in 2 weeks and will attempt a crossing rain or shine. If he gets turned back its safe to say none of us will be spending our 8+K in Canada ever again. That said, I called the outfitter again today and he was very casual about it, claiming that half the border patrol will be losing their jobs in the next 6 months due to cut backs so they have a ""i dont care"" mentality. Whether that is true or not doesn't really matter since there is still no clear cut answers regarding this joke of a an exemption. Either way we are going to try it, and if he gets turned away we will just spend the week in Northern Minnesota, again... To be continued.."
1438625,GNO,2012-05-21 20:23:00,153,"If you will be crossing in Fort Frances, call them and explain the exact situation and they will help you. The immigration number for the Fort Frances crossing is 807-274-3815. They can explain the new guidelines and how your situation will be handled. Please post a report after your trip."
1438639,remmy,2012-05-21 20:46:00,6,"I will share my experiences. I have traveled with the same group of 4 which we have always crossed at Ft Frances for approx 5-6 yrs. The 2nd or 3rd yr we crossed we had no idea about the issue of dui while crossing into Canada but we had a member with us that had been charged with a DUI only 2-3 months earlier. They called us into the office like they always had every year previously because we bring too much beer so we need to go in to pay our duty tax. They said that they needed to run a quick background check on us, again just as they always had and we were free and clear to head north after paying the duty. We didn't know that we were ""lucky"" to be able to get through. The member that had the DUI at the time has gone back with us many years since then and we have never had any trouble with his record, ever. Fast forward to 2008....I was charged with a DUI myself on July 4th (calm down boys, not everyone is perfect). We were headed across the border with the same group as always in late July thinking nothing of the incident as previous. Well, everything went as normal until they called my name to go into the back office for a private meeting with an officer. This female officer was very to the point on the matter at hand!! I was very concerned that I was about to ruin the trip for my friends during the ""interogation"" but she did allow us to pass after telling her how much $$ our group was spending in Ontario and she knew that I was charged but not conviced at the time. She said it was her choice to allow me to pass or not being that a conviction had not taken place yet. I got the charge dropped after we returned home and I have not had any trouble crossing since. I still don't understand how the other ""convicted"" person in the group has never had a lick of trouble crossing??"
1438657,bricken,2012-05-21 21:40:00,14,"waiting to hear results as well. I received a dui 3 yrs ago. It was a deferred judgment and I had it expunged. I learned a lesson and my business/career would be severely impacted by a 2nd dui. Even though I have this expunged I'm a little worried. If they ask me, I will admit to this,( just the kind of guy I am I guess. I believe honesty and respect is the best policy.) I plan on driving my truck to which says they will pry know about it. I will have a documentation of all court records, but I still am afraid of being turned back. I have been waiting to hear some real time experiences. I will be crossing in Buadette. Undecided whether or not to call and ask about my specific case? don't want to draw attention to myself. lol"
1438705,v-bay gord,2012-05-22 05:53:00,3168,"I'm not trying to defend the decisions at the border.....BUT....the confusion has more to do with the ""heresay"" and folks hearing what they want to hear. If you think that it is nonsense to not know till you hit the border then I would suggest you phone the border to actually find out what the rules are.....and how they will apply to your specific case. The border has nothing to do with the Province of Ontario, it is run by the Federal Government. Walleye Central should not be your only source of information on this topic if you think you might be affected by rules at the border. I do know that the Fort Francis border crossing has improved greatly in it's customer service and ""attitude"". If for any reason you feel you are being treated poorly by an agent it is your right to ask for a supervisor........do it!"
1438826,drlee,2012-05-22 09:02:00,409,"Good thoughts, V Bay. Thanks. Did not know this was federal, not provincial. In one sense, as I mentioned earlier, I don't really have a dog in this fight. I just want to encourage clarity. Some folks here seem to think that they don't get ""straight answers"" when they call ahead for information. Is there a specific number that should be used? A label for the position of the officer they need to talk to? As you suggest, sometimes it is hearing what you want to hear. I want my friends, the owners of the two camps I visit every summer, to attract as many guests as possible. I recommend the two camps to others and this question about dui's does come up. Again, thank you for your contribution to this discussion."
