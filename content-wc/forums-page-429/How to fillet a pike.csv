1446496,Campcountry,2012-06-08 06:43:00,164,Terrific video Gord. I have been enjoying boneless pike for years now but will modify my own technique a bit after watching your video.
1446510,Stu,2012-06-08 07:04:00,472,"Great job! I have found that NOT washing the fillets prior to freezing them greatly reduces the chance of freezer burn. Supposedly, the slime coat protects them. Also, I save the y-bone meat and pickle it. The brine dissolves the bones. Outdoor life has a great pickled pike recipe on their website. Thanks again Â– Stu"
1446595,v-bay gord,2012-06-08 09:34:00,3168,"Thanks for the feedback. Jay, my knife sharpening technique is pretty much ""cave man style"". I have a small belt sander tool that I run my knives over when dull.....and use a steel daily to try and maintain an edge. My knives are inexpensive Victorianox (Swiss army) brand knives that I picked up at the Mpls Sportshow for less than ten bucks. They are actually not razor sharp.....you might be surprised how dull they are. You can either ""fight"" the fish with your knife, or after much practise let the knife to the job on it's own....the latter only requires a so-so sharp knife. I have had people collect the y-bones for pickling as well. I rinse the fillets well.....it is easier to hang onto them that way."
1446598,PRO-V1,2012-06-08 09:43:00,142,"I have seen a few videos out there on deboning, but this is the best one yet (easiest way) thanks for sharing GordMike"
1446726,brant,2012-06-08 15:32:00,89,Thanks for the video Gord. It is always good to get a refresher when some of us only fillet northerns once a year.
1446797,Lazy Fisherman,2012-06-08 20:10:00,276,Thanks for posting the video.
1446949,Opie,2012-06-09 10:29:00,129,"Gord, Thanks for making our stay as great as possible. I will have to work on my videography skills a bit for the sequel . Looking forward to the next trip. Dean Thorn"
1447102,Litchfieldwalleye,2012-06-09 22:47:00,400,Thanks for the video Gord - well explained & easy to remember.
1447471,NWwalleye,2012-06-10 20:38:00,223,Great job Gord ... Very similar to the technique I use ..
1447508,1xcleox,2012-06-10 22:15:00,24,Very nice video. Watched a guy use the same method on Rainy Lake one year. Because of the haze of the LaBatts I always wanted a refresher course. Got it! Thanks
1446415,v-bay gord,2012-06-07 21:04:00,3168,"Well, I said I would put up a video on how to fillet a pike. Thank you to Walleye Central member Dean, alias ""Opie"", for his assistance. Done in one take, no script.....it could use a bit of work, but I think it shows the process. Before the ""bleed your fish"" contingent chimes in, let's just say I view it as ""pike juice"" rather than blood. It's all good. Here's the link... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX_bKTgE6NI&feature=plcp Just an update to my post.....somehow my video has now ended up on this pike fishing site http://www.northernpikebook.com/how-...t-the-y-bones/ There might be some info here worth checking out."
1446422,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-07 21:20:00,235,Nicely done.
1446423,elway12,2012-06-07 21:23:00,335,Great Video! Thanks for posting.
1446437,rnnonmt,2012-06-07 23:06:00,992,Nice video. Thanks for posting. I now know my filet knife is not sharp.
1446439,JayM5209,2012-06-07 23:51:00,1050,"Gord, thanks for the very instructional video. Given the number of fish you fillet every year, it would be helpful if you did one describing the fillet knives you use and how you keep them razor sharp."
1446452,2746,2012-06-08 04:47:00,3206,"Excellent video! I had pm'd Gord earlier telling him we stayed at his lodge in 2002 and 2003 and that it was he that had given me a lesson in cleaning pike. Ive been doing it that way ever since (had avoided them prior to that) and enjoy eating a pike every bit as much as walleye. Jay is right about those knives.....razor shrp and make the task look easy.Btw, it was at Gords on Eagle Lake I first encountered a Musky. That's a story for another post but what an experience!!!!"
1446462,packpro,2012-06-08 05:22:00,695,Hoping to put that to use in the next 24 hours.....Thanks for the post.
1446468,octanehi5,2012-06-08 05:35:00,1104,"very nice vidio, pike is a great eating fish. you just have to get all the bones out. I will use this method this yr. thanks"
1446488,Glenman12,2012-06-08 06:28:00,762,"yeah, thats got to be the sharpest filet knife Ive ever seen..."
1446495,Fishin Fun,2012-06-08 06:40:00,218,Very nice. Wish I was there!
