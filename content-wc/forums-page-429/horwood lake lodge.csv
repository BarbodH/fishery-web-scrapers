The end of the lake where the lodge is located (Hardiman Bay) is much deeper than what we were used to fishing, so we focused along the shoreline and some of the bays. I think we spent way too much time fishing closer to the lodge when we should have moved further into the lake. The Mayflies might have had an impact as well. I believe the better fishing is closer to where the three parts of the lake intersect about 10 miles down (the lake looks somewhat like a ""Y""), especially for pike. Anyway, I think the lake has a lot of potential for numbers of walleye. We did catch some that were 24-26"" though. I want to go back someday and try again because I know we could have done better. It's always difficult to assess a lake within a single week.The owner is a decent no nonsense guy and the price for a weeks stay is very reasonable. I don't think I have seen anywhere offer an American Plan for the price he is charging. He also offers some day trips to some of the other lakes in the area that have good fishing."

1447800,adempsey,2012-06-11 12:23:00,963,"I believe part of the reason is because the folks coming from MI/OH and the states west of there head to central and western Ontario since it's closer and typically the lakes have better fishing. However, if you do a search here on WC, you will see some reports from the past couple of years. Here's a couple from another site:http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...1&#entry606535http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...1&#entry354624http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...1&#entry234601I just read a report from a group staying at Big Bear Camp last week and they caught about 200 walleye for the week (not sure if that's per person, boat or the whole group). They were happy enough to book again for next year anyway."
