1438551,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-21 18:18:00,1460,"A few excerpts of History of Bush Flying http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_165922.htmlWith the advent of war in 1914, there were few registered pilots in Canada, and even fewer aircraft. Flying was a novelty of the well to do, and certainly, the daring. But over the next five years, young Canadian men would come to comprise almost one-third of the British air services. For many, it was an opportunity to escape the horrors of the trenches - the mud, cold, rats, lice and the ever ominous threat of a horrible death. It was a chance to take to the pristine blue skies, with the wind in your face and a silk scarf round your neck trailing in the breeze. It wasn't until January of 1920 that Canada's first private pilot's licence was issued, the first air engineer's certificate signed, and the first commercial aircraft was registered. At the same time, the goverment granted provisional approval to establish a Canadian air force. Regimented flying of course wasn't for everybody. The war-torn, embattled skies of Europe had unwittingly give birth to a new era in Canadian history - the era of bush flying. Veterans of aerial combat, and others, were to become the pioneers - the bush pilots It wouldn't be long before the aircraft would be reaching into the hinterlands of Ontario. On August 17, 1920, Roy Maxwell, a former Royal Air Force captain, accompanied by engineer Geordie Doan made the first flight into James Bay. They flew from Remi Lake, near Kapuskasing, into Moose Factory in an H-Boat. Only 11 days later, this same crew completed the first ambulance flight in northern Canada, flying a gentleman from Moose Factory to Remi Lake. In September, Maxwell completed the first volume carriage of air mail in the country, when he carried 100 lbs. of mail into Moose Factory aboard the H-Boat. Often unreliable aircraft left the crew sitting on a remote lake miles from anywhere, and of course, without comunications. Either the aircraft was made flyable or it was a long hike out of the bush to get help. Sometimes outside assistance was required. It might even mean changing an engine on the spot. Take your pick, in summer the blackflies would chew you apart, and in winter, the sub-zero temperatures made work very difficult. Simply starting an engine in winter meant a certain procedure had to be followed. At the end of the day, the oil had to drained from the engine and carried to the nearest shelter. It had to be kept warm overnight, if that was possible. In the morning, it was poured back into the engine. If it was too thick, it had to be heated first while another fire pot was placed under the engine to thaw it out. When the engine failed to start, the process was repeated. And with the days being so short, this was usually done in the early morning darkness to permit the maximum amount of daylight flying. The early aircraft had few comforts. Even when winter flying commenced, pilots and engineers often sat exposed in open-cockpit planes. Imagine flying at 35 below zero. The wind chill factor would be horrendous. As this season gets underway, a big tip of my cap to the rugged Canadian bush pilot. A man's man."

1438775,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-22 07:54:00,235,"Thank you for sharing. I just started my private pilot training and have a fantasy of being a bush pilot, but it's too late in life for me to make that change. The best bush pilots are some of the best pilots around. They are gutsy and some of them die doing what they love. All of them will push the limits of the aircraft at some point can can tell you stories of close calls and other adventures. If I was a single and on a career track for piloting (I am neither), I would love to do a few summers at a fishing outfitter in Canada or Alaska to build up hours."
1438831,Rivratz,2012-05-22 09:13:00,105,"Live in Canada from spring to fall and be a fishing guide!!! It's adventurous, sometimes wild, your outdoors, safe from crashing from the sometimes not so friendly skies, but, ask any guide, ""it's hard work"". It can be a little dangerous dealing with those humans if you don't find them their fish. The humans can get awfully nasty if they don't catch their 100 fish that day! And, that's 100 fish per person. That's what I paid for, isn't it???"
1438836,camp chef,2012-05-22 09:31:00,915,"I have never had a 100 fish per person day. We have been on track before, but I get too thirsty before reaching that plateau."
1438848,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-22 09:42:00,1460,"In Alaska it is something like one out of every 60 adults are pilots. Kind no wonder there are so many plane wrecks littered all over the state. I did like to watch ""Flying Wild Alaska"" on Discovery. I think that show got cancelled however. My son has my permission to marry Ariel Tweto. She is a cutie."
1438879,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-22 10:29:00,1460,"Good luck Ten Horse with your pilot training. I think that once you get your pilots license, you might want to change your handle. Despite the thread title, I am scared of heights and really don't want to actually be a bush pilot. Close calls, I've had a couple. Back in the day, the outfitters would cram as much people and gear into there planes as would fit and still get off the water. They were much less regulated than they are currently. There was this cowboy pilot named Ray who was picking our group up from Wabakimi. We were a group of 8 with a lot of gear and Ray wanted to take out some empty propane bottles and a bad outboard motor back to base. About this time the weather started getting rough and the whitecaps were forming on the main lake. We taxi out as far as Ray dared to without getting swamped by the rough conditions. My Dad who had his pilots license at the time knew that this was going to be tricky and asked Ray if this was smart, maybe we should try and wait it out. Ray didn't even respond, he just gunned it down the short water runway we had available to us. As we are sitting in the plane, we are watching the shoreline rapidly approaching and wondering if we are going to make it or not. The plane lifts off a the very last second and the pontoons clipped the tops of the pine trees. I think I threw up. Another time with Ray as the pilot, again leaving Wabakimi on return trip back to Ft Francis, we had a good scare. Everything was going like clockwork it seemed. We didn't seem to be overloaded and conditions were good for the flight back. We take off and start to climb to cruising altitude when all of a sudden, pluft, pluft and quiet. We immediately start to fall from the sky. We ran out of gas just 5 minutes after takeoff. Well, this didn't even phase Ray, he switched to a different tank and restarted the engines. Man I tell ya, the one sound you don't want to hear in a bush plane is quiet. I think this was the last flight for Ray as he was fired by my outfitter. I must say that my outfitter now has the finest pilots in NW Ontario. Brad and Chris are some of the most conscientious pilots in the business. I really enjoy these men who are part Grizzly Adams, part Charles Lindbergh."
1439057,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-22 14:42:00,235,A 100 fish per person day usually means a lot of 12 inch walleyes. I would much rather catch 30 that average 17-18 inches with a handful over 20...that is very feasible on many Canadian lakes.
1439075,81Saluki,2012-05-22 15:13:00,97,I tip my hat to all pilots (especially bush) y'all are GREAT! I love the air. I even took lessons once. Flying is easy but landing is HARD! And that was on a hard runway. I gave up because I figured it would be too expensive to figure out how to get myself safely back on terra firma. Ten Horse Johnson best wishes reaching your goal! Good luck man!!! 81Saluki
1439119,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-22 17:22:00,235,"I'm a lurker on some pro pilot discussion boards. An aspiring pilot had inquired about how to become a bush pilot, and some guys who'd done it chimed in. I guess you can develop a lot of bad habits as a pilot in this line of work, the pay is low, the women are scarce and if you do it for 30 years you have a 1 in 6 chance of being in a fatal crash. It takes a special breed, but I'm glad those guys are out there."
1439186,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-22 19:48:00,235,"Sounds to me like your pilot did not properly do his checklist. In the Cessna 172 checklist I use for training, there are at least two different points where you verify that the fuel selector is set to 'BOTH', both during preflight and prior to engine startup and (I think) right before takeoff. Seems like that would be standard for a Beaver or similar plane. I haven't had a scare like that up north fishing, but one year we had a day with low visibility and rough winds and an unconfident pilot. Not a good combo! We were waiting to get picked up at an outpost (with a new group coming in), and we weren't sure if they would even be flying due to the low visibility. But sure enough, the plane showed up right on time. Pilot gets out and says, ""boy, it's rough up there...I don't know if I want to go back up for a while."" He said he was going to wait it out for a bit, and we of course deferred to his judgment. After 45 minutes, he radios base and the other pilot, and he got a report that conditions were apparently fine at base, and we were going to give it a go. While taxiing, the pilot tells me (riding shotgun) that he hates flying in these conditions - when he was young, it gave him an adrenaline rush, now he just feels fear. He said if it was up to him, they wouldn't even be flying today.He then proceeded to ask me if there were any rocks or obstructions between a pair of islands that was in his takeoff lane (shouldn't he know that?). We take off and make our way on a bumpy 10 minute flight back. The normal landing path to the base is a long narrow bay/finger of a large lake, but the cross winds were fierce coming in and our pilot aborted landing and flew to a wide open part of the lake where he could get a straight-on head wind. The taxi back to the main lodge then took about 25 minutes, and during that time we saw the other pilot (the chief pilot) fly into the long channel and nail the crosswind landing with ease. Our pilot briefly commented on how good a pilot the other guy was, and then confided that he was worried the lodge owner was going to be pissed that he took so long to get back with other guests waiting in tow to flight out. He says, ""When we get back, I'm done for the day"". I felt some relief because this would mean that the chief pilot would go back to get my dad and the remaining guys back at the outpost. However, our pilot ended up going back out, and I was actually a little worried. I was extremely relieved when that second flight came back."
1439275,Ogoki,2012-05-23 04:41:00,291,"I looked into becoming a bush pilot in the 1990's . Mentioned it to the outfitter we were using and he said I had better plan on flying in Alaska . He told me the Canadain government requires that any employment position they fill has to be advertised and filled from a Canadian resident FIRST . He said there were so many young pilots trying to get hours that I would have trouble finding a job in Ontario. I have to check everything out for myself and that is pretty much what I found out also . My bubble was busted, you might say ."
1439296,Skywagon,2012-05-23 06:00:00,1106,"There are more people looking for flying jobs, than flying jobs available. The economy has not helped, less tourists, high cost of avgas/jet A fuel (which increases the cost of fly-in's). Most young guys that do get a job, end up working the ramp for a year or two, loading planes, digging holes for outhouses, cabin maintanance, with little flying to begin with. It has been said many times, that flying is hours of boredom with seconds of sheer terror, those seconds add to the sense of adventure and keep them waiting in line for that job, it's not the pay."

Any pilot who openly shows a lack of confidence in his own ability to do his job doesn't exude any confidence for the client. I hear ya.Quote: Originally Posted by OgokiI looked into becoming a bush pilot in the 1990's . Mentioned it to the outfitter we were using and he said I had better plan on flying in Alaska .

Think that I would like to fix cabins and load planes. Digging the outhouses might be a deal breaker, however. Seems like, at least at my camp, that there is just 2 different spots that the outhouses reside. Digging out year old poop is not gonna cut it for me unless it's done with dynamite and a very long fuse. I guess I'll continue with my present job status."

That said, there's nothing that sounds better in the morning than a 50 year old de Havilland. Had hands on a book years ago that told stories of the old bush pilots in Alaska in the golden ageit never came home. Sadly, I loaned it out and can't remember the title."
1439663,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-23 18:26:00,1460,"Great saying Bigwalleye1! I've never heard it before. One thing about pilots and especially the bush pilots is the heroic efforts they make when an emergency arises. Last summer when the fires were ravaging NW Ontario, they would fly the fire fighters and supplies all over the province in dangerous conditions on top of their regular duties. Unheralded heroes if you ask me."
1443842,Dogbreath,2012-06-02 09:07:00,494,"Our son was a bush pilot for a few years in Sioux Lookout and a couple of their planes had little placques on the dash that read...""Tipping your pilot helps him remember where he left you""""Worked the docks"" for a year or so, got to be a bush pilot and loved it, Last year he got his dream job of flying the 415 water bombers for the MNR. Is working the Kapuskasing and Timmins fires as we speak"

It is only a mile from the international bridge, in an old float plane hanger on the St Mary's River. The hanger was origanally the home of the provincial float plane rescue service.

Not to hijack this thread regarding bush pilots. I respect all pilots, especially our military pilots. Whether they are flying choppers or fighter jets, they help make our continent to the north and south, safe and free, so we can go where we want to go, when we want too... I still firmly believe the Alaskan bush pilots rule!!!"
