545884,Catman59,2005-02-23 03:50:00,345,"Thanks for ideas......Ive checked out a ton of camps and Im still very happy with White Sands on Sturgeon Lake. I take my family and they are very accomodating. Probably the most resonable priced camp Ive found. Fishing is usually fantastic , but last year became challenging , due to high water , cold and storms every day. We will be returning this year."
545895,Guest,2005-02-23 10:28:00,0,Hello LLABWONS Thanks for lthe info. I wqsn't able to bring up the total info. said page wasn't available etc. I have a 1998 70 HP Johnson 3 blade prop with the number of 390896 it is also a 13 X 19 . Sounds like a good idea--something that could be repaired at the lake. Anyone else with info. about fishing north of the villlage of Pickle Lake up Gary's driveway. len in michigan
545898,Guest,2005-02-23 11:40:00,0,"If you are happy with a camp by all means stick with it. Good to hear people going back season after season. Last year was a tough year weather wise... so its a good decision going back and giving ""your"" place another try. All the best, Agate"

545945,Guest,2005-02-25 13:35:00,0,Len: I've been going north of Pickle for over 25 yrs. Made my first trip there in 1976. Would be interested in comparing notes.
1447774,Guest,2012-06-11 11:55:00,0,"Check cabellas for a ""Prop Saver"" that bolts right onto your motor, they are being used by many Canadian outfitters and they really work they cost about $190.00 (what did your motor cost). Bought a new 25 yamaha,installed the prop saver on it, and got my moneys worth the first half hour on the water. we hit a boulder the size of a V-W with absolutely no damage at all to either the motor or the ""Rock Saver"" if U can't find it @ Cabellas check w/ Bass-pro---They really do work, jus rmemer to lece your motor ""Unlocked"" whie moving forward"
545812,IaDave,2005-02-18 11:28:00,476,"Taking a different route to Pickle Lake this summer. Crossing at Pigeon River and would like to stay at Thunder Bay. By looking at the map it looks like there is a by-pass(Hiway 130). Are there any motels out by the intersection of 130 and hiways 11/17? Also, more important is where is the nearest Beer Store?"
545815,Guest,2005-02-18 13:32:00,0,There are a couple hotels right along 61 as you head towards the 11/17 junction. I have stayed at the Best Western Nor'Wester. Nice place with a good bar. If you want some other choices check out this web site http://www.thunderbayhotels.net/ All the best!
545826,Guest,2005-02-19 06:27:00,0,I second the motion on the NorWestern. Have stayed there for years. Great place to eat across the road. Let me know when you get sick of making that drive to Pickle Lake. Our resort is 2 hrs north of Thunder Bay and have the best walleye fishing you could ask for.
545827,Guest,2005-02-19 07:39:00,0,Ia Dave Hello Dave. I think we have spoken before on the net. Have you been up the Pipestone into Horseshoe Lake. Thinking you gave me info. concerning that water. Sorry for my memory just turned 60. I am planning on going up in May so that I can help the prop repair guys stay in business. Would enjoy hearing from you and all others who go north of the little village of Pickle Lake. Almost 1200 miles one way for me. Take care len in michigan
545836,Catman59,2005-02-20 05:21:00,345,Does your resort have a website ?
545837,Guest,2005-02-20 07:35:00,0,"Hello lenrays Just read your thread where you mentioned keeping the prop man in business. Did you ever hear about ""Piranha Propellers"" They feature replaceable blades. Here is the URL for their site.

545838,Guest,2005-02-20 07:49:00,0,"The nearest beer store is located near the junction of Hwy 61 and the road to Little Trout Bay. It is not too far from the US/Canada Border on the LEFT side of the road on the Canadian side. It is a Convenience Store that sells Beer and Liquor. They also sell,at the present time, CAN-OP gasoline. Regards, Llabwons"
545846,Guest,2005-02-21 06:42:00,0,"Catman-Yes, their website is www.holinshead.ca. Really a great place. I'd certainly be happy to help anyone out going there with maps etc."
545849,IaDave,2005-02-21 09:39:00,476,"Lenrays- I have been fishing in the Pickle Lake area 8 or 9 times. I have done both a fly-ins and taking a boat up. Last year I was lucky enough to do 2 fly-ins. Had a little extra cash because I sold my boat. Have fished Mud Lake and Kabcethci Lake and have driven up to the Pipestone River one day when we got blown off Mud Lake. You are thinking of one of my fishing buddies,he has fished Horseshoe Lake with his brother-in-law. You may have run across his brother-in-law his name is Marv. Marv goes up in May and camps until July. It must be nice to be retired and have an understanding wife. He has been going to Mud Lake the last couple of years, he says the fishing is just as good as Horseshoe and it is closer to town. Swing by Mud Lake on your way up this year I'm sure Marv will be there,just look for a truck with Iowa plates. He is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to the area. I'm heading up the 3rd week of June for another fly-in."
545860,Catman59,2005-02-22 04:28:00,345,Thanks........I will look at it.
