1446820,Rivratz,2012-06-08 21:16:00,105,"I have been getting updates from Duane, owner of Paradise Cove Resorts, since the season started. Started good, then, a long lasting low pressure system sat over NW Ontario, for about 10 miserable days. Fishing slowed down quite a bit, some fish being caught when you were able to get on the lake. As of this week, Duane had said that the weather has been cooperating and the fishing has greatly improved! Duane had sent pictures of his guests with some really pretty, nice sized, walleye, bass, and pike. If you start out slow, hire Cory, out of Paradise Cove, to guide you to the fish!"
1447232,Caleb,2012-06-10 10:18:00,36,We are leaving this weekend for Minaki. Does anybody have any report other then Duanes. Thanks for any information.
1447600,briand,2012-06-11 07:52:00,48,"Well this weekend wasn't the best of weekend to be out. We did manage to fish around little around the washtub, wild edge and the brushpile. Nothing great, the fish were there, just ya had to work for themAll fish over 18"". Spent most of time in pistol and was able to land a good meal out of there with a few over 18 again.In pistol we trolled spinnes and worms, and in little sand we started with jigs but moved to bottom bouncer with worms.We did have 1 walleye that was shy of 25"" that looked like he went through ****. I've seen bite marks, but this poor sole was torn."
1447642,Caleb,2012-06-11 08:59:00,36,Thanks Briand for the info. It looks like big sand is probably going to be the best next week. I just hope the weather cooperates so we can fish out there.
1447676,briand,2012-06-11 10:05:00,48,I seldom venture that far anymore. But I would bet big sand should produce well soon.Rising gas prices as well I find the quality of fishing as good closer by.I used to make 2 trips a day to big sand until one night I shone the spot light into the lake and the whole shore had glowing eye's. Since that day I seldom go more then a mile.
