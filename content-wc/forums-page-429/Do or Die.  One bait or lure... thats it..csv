1446604,2746,2012-06-08 10:01:00,3206,"Our group likes to slow troll rigs and years ago concluded we did best with a simple 3 - 4' snell, number 2 colored hook dressed with a single bead. I've got a tackle box full of spinners that I occassionaly will try but always go back to the single hook snell.Now, having said that, the original question was ""what ONE lure?"" and if I was forced to that I'd choose a 3/8 oz, round, pink jig. Jigs can be used for all species, trolled or still fished, work in all seasons and dressed with almost anything. About as ""all around"" a bait as you can find."
1446617,labsrus,2012-06-08 10:43:00,557,Depends on the Lake I am fishing Go to seems to be a bright colored jig with a twister tail. Close second would be a harness with a nightcrawler
1446637,Rivratz,2012-06-08 11:22:00,105,Or the green #4 Gamakatsu hook with a red bead! The long leader is the ticket to success! I like to use less weight depending on the chop or current. Let the Games begin!
1446670,fishinnut 3446,2012-06-08 12:48:00,638,I perfer a chartruse 1/8 ounce jig with either a minnow or half a crawler.If it's for a musky trip big blue and silver cowgirl

1445570,rnnonmt,2012-06-06 08:16:00,992,This has been a fun post so far. Interesting to see what your favorites are. A few more posts and I will head to bass pro and pick up a few of each. {Devilish Laugh} Just kidding... I think I have most of these already. I will have to give some of your favorites a try. I think sometimes we fisherman get tunnel visioned into one or two lures/baits (because either we caught our largest fish on it or had a best numbers day) so we use that one lure 99% of the time and the rest of them just sit there in our tackle boxes only to be wetted for a mere 6 or seven attempts and then tossed back into the tackle box. Leaving with my 12 year old son for Lac Seul in 14 more sleeps. Can't wait! 4th year in a row for him now!
