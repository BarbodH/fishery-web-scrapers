1448032,davenathe,2012-06-11 20:34:00,113,Always pick up in Dryden at bait shop and has been good quality. Figure 500 crawlers in four days for 6 guys. If big use 1/2 crawler. Definitely not worth the border trouble or handling to save a couple bucks.
1442051,UKBDM,2012-05-29 11:07:00,178,Just pre-ordered a flat and and a half of crawlers from Dutchie's in Perrault Falls for our late June trip to Wabaskang. $55 per flat.Paid $35 per flat in Indiana last year but had to switch them to bedding and mess around keeping them cool in the back of my truck for two days and 1000 miles. Extra $20 is worth it to me. Will pick them up Sat afternoon on the way to camp and they will be in the refrigerator 15 min later.
1442722,villain189,2012-05-30 12:15:00,33,Yeah..not worth it for us anymore either even if it costs a few bucks more. Couple years back we got turned around at the border for worms. They were in non-dirt bedding but it looked enough like dirt the customs agent didn't care and made us turn around go back to US Customs. Dump the worms into a garbage can then proceed back across the Canadian Border again. All together cost us about 2 hours due to bridge traffic. Needless to say not risking that happening again!
1443529,ILScott,2012-06-01 10:21:00,139,How many crawlers are in a flat? I have seen some websites say 500 but I want to make sure.
1443532,UKBDM,2012-06-01 10:27:00,178,500 +/-
1443554,55walleyes,2012-06-01 11:07:00,131,I am planning on getting my flat at great bear shell gas station in Fort Francis. Any body out there purchased a flat from them and if so how was quality?
1443659,JLester,2012-06-01 16:41:00,13,How did you get ahold of Dutchies? That's a good price for the convenience. We're going to be there first week in August.
1443729,UKBDM,2012-06-01 20:20:00,178,"Went there late in the week when we ran out. 13 people can get thru 500 pretty quick. The lady you want to talk to is Rikki but her card is in my desk drawer at work. You can probably do a google search. Dutchies Perrault Falls Ontario We are at Jim and Julie's on Wabaskang so it's easy to run up there when you need groceries, beer, etc."
1447339,trapper_john,2012-06-10 15:19:00,83,We are heading North the end of this month. Instead of messing with crawlers here and taking them up we have decided to buy them in Int. Falls. Any good ideas or any place that we should avoid? I have one address and it's Outdoorsman's. Any other ideas? Thanking you up front.
1447954,jimmie,2012-06-11 18:07:00,123,"On East end near Sioux Lookout there are crawlers at Ojibway bait just south of town on Hwy 72 About $3.90 a dozen after tax. Since you only need a small piece that brings 'em down to about 10/12 cents a piece. Not too bad to be complianet and the worms are usully good size and fresh! Come in a styro bowl, with lid and seaweed. mmmmmmm yum . . . said all the walleyes!!"
1447962,wallydave,2012-06-11 18:21:00,2151,"Here is Dutchies phone number 1 807 529-6556. Good folks, we stop there now that the Village Corner closed.
