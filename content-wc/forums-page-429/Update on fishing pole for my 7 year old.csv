So, went to Bass Pro picked up an ultra light ugly stick and a Pflueger spinning reel. I decided against mono as I'm used to using fireline so put on some crystal fireline. He picked it up right away. Took maybe 3 or 4 tries to get to where he was casting it perfectly. We were out on the houseboat yesterday and were catching a TON of small bass. Then, BAM! Pole goes down, drag starts going out. He jumps up and starts reeling. Didn't even take it out of the rod holder. Reeled in wiht absolutely NO help about a 14 to 16"" Wiper/Hybrid Bass. The other rod/reel we were using, the line definitely would have broken."

1446806,SinOrSwim,2012-06-08 20:40:00,1528,He is a competitive little dude too. We had each caught two small bass when I had a bite. I got it on the line but then handed it to him to reel it in. He lifts it up onto the swim deck of the boat where we were sitting and says................I'm ahead 3 to 2. LOLWe also had our first double. he thought that was pretty cool that we each caught one at the same time. We have been fishing off the back the last couple years but this is the first time he is really starting to understand what we are doing and how it works. Fun to watch.
1446811,Rivratz,2012-06-08 20:49:00,105,"How do you think most of us Canadian river and lakes fisher people got started? Right, just like your son! Local lakes and rivers, is the best way to get the juices flowing. Why didn't you get him the Zebco ""Sponge Bob"" pole? That Ugly Stik and nice reel is going to last forever! They just don't die! Great move! Too bad you didn't have the video cam running when he reeled in that Big Bass!"
1447626,octanehi5,2012-06-11 08:30:00,1104,"The ugly stick is not a bad choice even for an old walleye worrier.He will have alot of memories with you and his rod the rest of his life.The old saying, If you give a man a fish he will eat for a day, If you teach him to fish, he will sit and drink beer in a boat all day"
