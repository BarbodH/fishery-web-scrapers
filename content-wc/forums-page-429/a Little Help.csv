1447637,trapper_john,2012-06-11 08:47:00,83,We are heading North the end of this month. Instead of messing with crawlers here and taking them up we have decided to buy them in Int. Falls. Any good ideas or any place that we should avoid? I have one address and it's Outdoorsman's. Any other ideas? Thanking you up front.
