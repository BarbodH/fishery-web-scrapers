Or was it tails?! With just two weeks to go before our group heads for Ontario the juices are flowing!! I picked up a few more jigs, braid and a shirt to keep my head in the Pre trip mode! Yes just what I needed?! How about the rest of you in the countdown phase? Stay safe and fish hard!!"
1443949,rnnonmt,2012-06-02 15:15:00,992,"Sat in the man cave all day watching fishing episodes on the internet tv with the fan blowing and the water misters on trying to stay cool. Its hot out here in AZ. Cant wait for some cooler weather, beautiful Canadian outdoors, fun times with friends/family and most of all FISHING! 19 days to go!!!"

1444226,JoeWho14,2012-06-03 13:20:00,20,"I've been going to NW Ontario for over 30 years, this year I've been the most excited I have been in years, for what ever reason!! We are heading up to the English River (NW of ON) in 8 days, 16 hrs. and 10 mins. I have had all my tackle, line, rods, etc. ready & packed for over a month & a half!! I usually have all my gear together about 2 weeks prior to leaving!! I don't know maybe it's just my age, but I love going up there every year, the fishing, scenery, peace of mind, friendship.....whatever it is, I can't think of anything that could top it!! Hope all of have a great trip this year and look forward to hearing how everyone did!!"
