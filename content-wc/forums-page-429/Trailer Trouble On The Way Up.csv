1447384,WalleyeWally28,2012-06-10 17:12:00,298,"It depends on the miles you have driven, but if it has been several years, I would suggest you do it now. The cost of repacking the bearings is not worth the time and cost of having it done if you breakdown on the road. I would then ask the person doing the work as to how often he would suggest it be done.A few years ago I had my bearings seize up right after I pulled into my driveway from a fishing trip. That was lucky but still cost a lot more to repair than having them repacked on a regular basis. I guess that made me paranoid as I have them repacked every fall before I store the boat for winter and again mid-summer between Canada trips. I do everything I can to prevent problems that may spoil a fishing trip."
1447482,Jesse-WI,2012-06-10 20:55:00,534,"North of the border some parts are almost impossible to find in a timely fashion. Over 20+ years, I have seen springs break, a wheel pass me on the highway, burned through a spindle to name a few mishaps. Even with well cared equipment strange things can happen. An extra set of parts to fix anyone thing wrong with a wheel, bearing, spindle, spring provides a lot of piece of mind."
1447593,Rivratz,2012-06-11 07:46:00,105,"WalleyeWally28 and Jesse Wi! Make sure you also check all tires and the spare. A tire dealer told me that trailer tires that are more than 3 years old should be replaced for safety reasons. He said because the trailer tires basically just sit, the chemical reactions in the tires make them dry and unsafe. He stated it's better for the tire composition if they rolled all the time like your car or truck."

1443322,Rivratz,2012-05-31 18:21:00,105,Just wanted to bring this thread up to the front for the guys who will be hooking up and leaving in the next couple of weeks! It's so important that your trailer is in tip top shape before the long haul.
1443340,wallydave,2012-05-31 19:32:00,2151,Each year we see boats and trailers along the side of the road North. After all the planning and preperations to be so close to hitting the waters of our favorite lake ruined by mechanic√°l issues would just plain suck! I hopeto see guys on the lakes or in the fish house and not along the road.
1443402,jaggersr,2012-05-31 22:14:00,44,"Been there, as over the years I have lost wheel bearings and blown tires due to overloading. I have got alot smarter over the years and now carry a box in the truck that includes extra wheel bearings, a complete hub assembly, grease, two spares and tools for repairs. Also spend the money each year to get road side emrgency service from Good Sams club. Another thing I do, is I bought a IR heat gun($65.00) from Harbor Freight. I check the heat on my wheel bearings during each stop. Takes seconds and its good piece of mind and I can spot a problem before it fails."
1443410,RapShad,2012-05-31 22:43:00,76,"In the past my group has seen and experienced some mechanical issues. No matter how prepared you are it seems like something will pop up. We ALWAYS bring a full tool box, which is the last thing loaded into the suburban so it's readily available. We've had trailer springs break (**** 502), nails in the tires, wheel bearings issues and we even saw a fiberglass boat catch on fire once, which looked horrific. Mechanical issues are all part of the trip, but make sure you check out the trailer before you head back too. I know we all get in a rush to beat everyone down to the border but there's just as much danger heading south as there is heading north."
1443526,Babamel2,2012-06-01 10:16:00,414,"I have heard that bearings are more likely to go out on the trip out, rather than home. The reason being is that on the previous trip the bearings for grease got wet and the bearings started to rust while the boat was setting. then when the trip started, the rust took over and wore out the bearing. anyway, since then, about a week or two before my trip, I take the boat out for a 15 -20 mile drive, then I stop and feel if the hubs are hot. One time one of them felt a bit warm, so I replaced the bearings. Never had one go out on the trip"
1443571,IMSPIKE,2012-06-01 11:45:00,12,Got my spare checked at good year and it basically crumbled when the guy took it off the mount according to my dad. It was brand new and never used-but old enough to rot i guess ??
1447220,Rivratz,2012-06-10 09:56:00,105,"Just checked my spare trailer tire. Final inspection. Excellent tread, sidewall looks good, unbolted the tire from trailer mount, the other sidewall looks like some rubber rot is going on. The spare probably wouldn't last 50 miles if I needed it! Thoroughly check your trailer at least one week before getting on the road guys! Happy Trails!"
1447316,1xcleox,2012-06-10 14:15:00,24,It's been a few years since I had anyone look at my hubs. I have bearing buddies on them. How often should you have them serviced?
1447330,tooski,2012-06-10 14:46:00,393,"Similar subject but tire related- trip to Lake St Joes in a friends twin axle motor home. Ten years old but only 11,000 miles. Tires looked great. Two blowouts on the way up and two on the way home. Tire guy in Mackinaw said the sun is a tire killer, that is why you see the tire covers on motorhomes not being driven. Never knew that."
1434558,Rivratz,2012-05-12 19:26:00,105,"All the prep time before the Big Trip seems to be primarily focused on booking your stay, who's going, food, tackle, booze, who's bringing what, etc. etc. You kick the tires on the trailer, make sure the tread looks good enough to get you there and back, hook it up to your truck, and go. Big mistake! Really big mistake! A trailer tire blow out on the road is a real buzz killer. What is that high pitched noise coming from the trailer? Oh no, a bearing just burned up! Uh oh, why is that state trooper pulling us over? Dang, I forgot to make sure that all of the lighting markers and tail lights were working properly. And, I forgot replacement bulbs! I forgot to grease the bearings or have them replaced. The spare tire is rotted and useless! A leaf spring just broke because i stored a ton of weight on them in the boat! It's 10pm and every store is closed until tomorrow. Oh dang, and double dang!!! Everyone is overjoyed! Have any of these scenarios happened to you? Do you make sure that your trailer is in top shape before your long haul! Every scenario has happened to me in my rookie years!"
1434578,Rich B,2012-05-12 20:24:00,1081,"I purchased 2 new Goodyear Marathons for my trailer this week.....the ones on it were 5 years old with lot's of tread....but I'd rather have good safe tires on my rig than trying to get the last mile from a tire.....heading north with my rig filled with my equipment riding on an older pair of trailer tires on the expressway for 22+ hours is not my idea of safe travels. Good advice to check the bearings, etc as well......what can go wrong will go wrong (sooner or later). Rich B"
1434648,Skywagon,2012-05-13 06:04:00,1106,"Replacing bearings, cups and seals, would be priority #1 if it has been a while. I am always ouchy with those things being in water a lot. It only takes one breakdown on the road, trying to find replacement parts to learn that lesson. I always carried spare parts and tools with me in case a bearing went out while I was on the road."
1434672,plumberjoe,2012-05-13 07:30:00,54,"One thing we found very handy is a complete trailer wiring package. They come with male and female trailer plugs, plenty of trailer wire, complete lights with bulbs and lense covers, and wiring accesories. With a few wire ties you can re wire the whole trailer if need be in a short time or you have spare parts for everything. I think it cost us under $40. When buying trailer tires don't cheep out get the ones with the highest weight rating you can so you dont have to worry if you put a littlr exta weight in boat. Also if you have a roller trailer check rollers you dont want rubber to come apart and have bracket go through the bottom of your boat."
1434678,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-13 07:52:00,298,It's not a bad idea to have the axle(s) aligned periodically. Tires can wear out very fast when axles are out of alignment. I learned that lesson the hard way.
1434688,fishinnut 3446,2012-05-13 08:29:00,638,"So,I stored my buddies boat over the winter and he picked it up yesterday, well I noticed although lots of tread on the tires,both outside edge's were checked/cupped/wavy,what ever you want to call it,they looked like"
1434700,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-13 08:56:00,298,"Mine wore completely thru on the inside. At a quick glance the tread looked fine. Dropped my boat in the water at the ramp, fished all day, reloaded it and noticed a flat tire. Not fun having to change a tire after a long day of fishing. I then noticed the tire on the other side was also just about ready to go. This was Sat. night over a Labor Day weekend. Spent Sun. morning buying 2 new tires at Wal-Mart (the only place open) as I didn't dare drive the 250 miles home with a very bad tire and no spare. I now watch the tires very closely and get an alignment if I see any uneven wear."
1434742,hoosiercanadian,2012-05-13 10:47:00,104,"On one of my trips up north with my daughters we stopped in Eau Claire Wis. to gas up and i noticed water running out of the bow of my boat, looking under the boat i almost started crying as i saw the bracket holding the main bow roller sticking into the bow of my lund mister pike. Luckily i was able to find a guy there in town who could weld aluminum. In a couple of hours we were back on our way, and the welds are still holding to this day, that was 18 years ago, i still feel very lucky to have run into that fellow, he saved our trip. Another time, after driving straight through on the way home 22 hours, had just gone through a very heavy thunderstom going around Indianapolis ,and blew a trailor tire, here i am pulled over along side the interstate on a curve , and the tire is naturally the one next to the roadway, as semi after semi blows by scaring the crap out of me , and i'm praying one does'nt plow into us, and to top it off the thunderstorm that we had just drove through was now bearing back down on me, finally got it changed , didn't get struck by lightning, or plowed into. In hinesight, i should have pulled the rig completly off the interstate, even if it meant destroying a rim, as the risk of getting hit was too great."
1434748,JayM5209,2012-05-13 11:15:00,1050,"I found this thread helpful, as were previous ones related to the same topic. It got me thinking about all the disabled tow vehicles, disabled trailers, and accidents we've seen traveling on Hwy. 502. Those who travel that route know how quickly you can come upon someone with a problem, usually just over the crest of a hill or around a curve. Made me realize that I do not have any kind of warning devices in my truck! Not being very fond of pyrotechnic flares, especially in the bush, I just ordered a kit with three LED flashing red lights. Found the kit, including storage bag, on Amazon for about $18, plus shipping.Something to think about..............."
