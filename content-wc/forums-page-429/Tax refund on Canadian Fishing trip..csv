1448131,tv4fish,2012-06-12 06:40:00,2694,"crazy: In order for you to ""qualify"" for the rebate - you have to had paid for an ""eligible tour package"". That (by definition) includes 1) ""short-term and/or camping accommodation in Canada and 2) ""at least one service"".You also had to pay at least $26 in HST. We have been succussful in getting our rebate w/o problems the last 2 years."
1448146,v-bay gord,2012-06-12 07:01:00,3168,"PC.....in a nutshell you are eligable for a rebate of half the HST paid on a ""package"" that includes overnight accomodation and at least one eligable service. In my case I use fish cleaning as the eligable service I provide. I have this printed on the front of my invoice. If you follow the link to the government form I believe you may be able to track down the list of eligible ""services""........best that your outfitter does the research and provides you with an invoice that will not be rejected. You need to send in the original invoice along with the completed form. Does not have to be 'American Plan""."
1448155,fishincrazy,2012-06-12 07:15:00,1282,"Thanks Gord I have contacted my outtfitter,we do the american plan with everything included except prop insurance.It would sure be nice to get some of that back.FC"
1448157,fishincrazy,2012-06-12 07:17:00,1282,"Thanks Beagel,We stay at an all included American type plan place.We do incur added expenses like prop insurance.I wonder if this will allow me to qualify?FC"
1448160,fishincrazy,2012-06-12 07:18:00,1282,TV I think I might just qualify for this.FC
1448173,tsquared,2012-06-12 07:51:00,57,Anybody have any luck getting the rebate on the Houseboats? I had mine refused when I tried.
1447585,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2012-06-11 07:16:00,5533,"Heads up - You can get 50% of your HST (Tax) back if you purchased some type of all inclusive package while in Canada. In order to get the refund back, you need to have purchased: 1) short-term and/or camping accommodation in Canada 2) and at least one service. (service can be food, fish cleaning, guiding etc.) Go to this link to get the form - http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/gf/gst115/README.html Make sure your outfitter lists the package as ""all inclusive"" on your sales receipt."
1447609,phishfearme,2012-06-11 08:03:00,1242,the outfitter should only collect half the HST in the first place - he essentially gives you the rebate right there and then. our outfitter will be doing this this year but the one we used last year didn't so we had to apply for it - then you get a check for the refund in canadian $$ which almost all US banks charge an outrageous fee to deposit or cash as well as hit you with a conversion fee. i sent the endorsed rebate check from last year to this year's outfitter and he credited it to our deposit. phish
1447666,JayM5209,2012-06-11 09:47:00,1050,"Phish, I'm thinking it may be a good thing you did not include the name of the outfitter in this public posting. If he only collects and remits half the tax, there must be some creative bookkeeping going on so an auditor doesn't trip over that practice . . . or, he reports and remits the total tax due and pays 50% of it out of his own pocket. The latter doesn't seem like a good way to get past the break-even point. Maybe someone who knows and regularly deals with Ontario tax regs can clarify??I've applied for and received the refund several times. No hassle, no fuss, bank deposited funds at exchange rate current at the time, no other fees. The important item is to have a receipt from the outfitter that shows you paid for at least two distinct services."
1447669,v-bay gord,2012-06-11 09:56:00,3168,"It used to be that the outfitter could rebate 50% of the GST.....not sure if that still applies to the HST. The only issue is that the outfitter is then on ""the hook"" for potentially thousands of dollars should the criteria of the rebate program suddenly change. I prefer to fill out and mail the forms for my guests. So far it has worked well."
1447713,phishfearme,2012-06-11 10:54:00,1242,"the outfitters who have done this have told me they have some type of arrangement with the gov. dwayne at thousand lakes outfitters (our trip last year) did not have any agreement and he wrote a clear receipt for us to mail in the rebate. in the past, northern outposts out of armstrong and pete johnson out of pickle lake have given the rebate at the trip payment. ] i think there's also something about paying a certain fraction of the trip upfront (deposit) but i'm just not familiar with the law here. and i think mailing in and getting a canadian $$ check IS a hastle. first, one of my applications was rejected outright with no reason given, another was totally ignored, they treat US$=canadian$ (back when it was WAY in favor of the US$) and then of course you get a check in the US in canadian funds. it's a hastle that apparently can be avoided. phish"
1447722,phishfearme,2012-06-11 11:03:00,1242,"gord - as i'm sure you are aware, the HST = PST + GST and you only get a rebate on the GST. i don't think the fact that these taxes have been ""homoginized"" makes any difference. by the way, i enjoyed your pike fillet video but i hope i never have to use it!! phish"
1447832,v-bay gord,2012-06-11 13:21:00,3168,"Phish...back when the rebate was for the GST only it was a 50% rebate on the accomodation portion of the bill (just the GST portion which if memory serves me was 8%). With the HST the rebate is 50% of the package which might include other things besides accomodation..ie. boats, gas etc. So if you consider the 50% rebate applies to the full 13% Hst, and covers more than accomodation, there is a significant benefit to the new visitor rebate. Some day you might discover the joy of eating pike.....I hope the fillet video serves you well ...thanks, by the way, glad you enjoyed it!"
1447874,phishfearme,2012-06-11 14:42:00,1242,"gord - you're right and i stand corrected. it is half of the HST not half of the GST like it used to be. i've been doing flyin, outpost packages for years now and with the new rules we get half of the etire HST associated with the package since there are two ""services"" (flight and cabin). it's a better deal than before when the rebate was only for half of the GST. but, it just seems MUCH more efficient and economical for the canadian governement to permit the outfitters to perform the rebate at the time of transaction. governments were never known for efficiency though. and pete johnson of pickle lake outposts in, of all places, pickle lake, is only charging us for half the HST this coming trip (less than two weeks!!) - he must be doing something different - and he's not the only one. and, i think pike are just as good for eating as walleye - especially fresh from the cold waters of the north. my first numerous years in northern ontario were with ray's camps on ramsey lake near biscotasing and that lake had ZERO walleye in it (they're not native to the spanish river system). so we ate pike all the time - and fought with the bones, fought with the slime and also brought some pike back home - but you had to eat it within a few months or it seemed to taste off. haven't eaten pike in over 20 years now - a i really respect the pike as they also prefer walleye!! thanks, phish"
1448095,fishincrazy,2012-06-12 05:40:00,1282,"So I'm a moron what you are talking about this 50% refund of HST can only occur if you are in an all inclusice American plan?Or is what your saying whatever type resort your staying at if you get extra services:ie guide for a day,extra boat whatever then your eligable??Please enlighten a totally tax ignorant canadian visitor.Thank You,FC"
1448126,Beagle_Nut,2012-06-12 06:35:00,52,"The rebate rules say that some extra service must be included in the package you're buying to qualify for the rebate besides just lodging. That just means the resort or outfitter you're staying with needs to be smart enough to write on your receipt that ""guide service"" is included in the package, which could really be just the normal bits of advice you expect to receive when you ask ""where are they biting and on what"". But, if the receipt they give you doesn't spell it out that guide service or something else (again see the rules) are included then your rebate request will be rejected. That happened to us when we stayed at a new place a couple years ago, and these people had been operating the place for many many years and I was not happy."
