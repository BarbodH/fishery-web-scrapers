1446784,Guest,2012-06-08 19:38:00,0,why bother? Is this a serious question?
1446791,hoosiercanadian,2012-06-08 20:05:00,104,"On ice , or frozen, just put your name and address on your cooler and tape it shut .They'll probably look in and inspect, and hopefully reseal the cooler. The problem is it will cost you at least 50 bucks for the extra baggage. Flew some home from Winnipeg, just depends on how badly you want some fresh fish when you get back home !"
1446800,Crede,2012-06-08 20:15:00,134,"When we fly - which is most trips now - we don't bring fish back. We eat plenty of walleye while there, but the hassle factor of keeping fish frozen plus the extra baggage (and fee) keep us from even attempting to fly fish home."
1446808,hoosiercanadian,2012-06-08 20:41:00,104,"We always fish the last day for take home fish, and just put them on ice, there is no need to worry about freezeing them and stressing about keeping them frozen."

1447929,elway12,2012-06-11 17:21:00,335,We always bring our fish back and just try to freeze them in camp before we leave. We then wrap and tape them with a few layers of newspaper. They are still frozen when we get home 14 hours later. We fly Southwest Airlines so there are no extra/chcked bag fees
