As we got a little closer my daughter pointed out that there was smoke rising. A little closer and we could smell it as well as see it in the air. Back at camp the owner called it in to the firefighting base in Pickle Lake. Within a half hour there was a helicopter full of firefighters, 2 waterbombers, and a spotter plane circling. It was amazing to watch the response. They were there in no time and everything was coordinated perfectly, from the bombers to the guys setting up a pump and running hose. They got the fire put out within an hour or so. We couldn't see the fire from where we were but did get to see the first water drop from the bombers and got some pretty good pictures of them. Thumbs up to the men and women that are there to fight those fires!!"
