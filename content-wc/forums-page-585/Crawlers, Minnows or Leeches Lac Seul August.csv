1086100,joeman79,2009-03-07 16:33:00,417,Just wondering if anyone really sees any real advantage with messin with Minnows versus crawlers or leeches on Lac Seul in early August? Crawlers are so much easier to care for. All tips and techinques appreciated. 5 months to ago. BLAH!!!!
1086123,Riceburner,2009-03-07 19:06:00,436,"All three will work great--but you are correct with the hastle about keeping minnows alive. That said, some folks use dead or salted minnows. Leeches will likely be sky high in price ($40+) by then. We use lots of crawlers....must be in paper bedding coming into CA."

1086236,Pooch,2009-03-08 11:40:00,4619,Last August minnows out fished worms and leeches hands down. And I'm a leech lover! Pooch
1086348,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-03-08 19:27:00,100,"Live minnows outproduce everything in August, as the majority of the Seul Walleyes turn to the massive smelt population as their main forage, but smelt is illegal to use as bait on this lake system. Be sure to carry a bucket of Gulp Alive shiners, or salted dead bait in case you run out of minnows, these require a bit more finesse...but are probably second best to the real thing.Get your minnows bagged in 3 doz at a time, dump one bag in the bucket and keep the rest in the bags on oxygen placed in an ice chest. Your bait will be fresh all day!"
1088554,joeman79,2009-03-16 21:06:00,417,How long will an oxygenated bag of 3 dozen minnows stay alive in a cooler with ice do u think?? I HATE thinking of paying 6.00 a dozen for minnows. That is what I have been told place we ae going charges. I think we will do well enough on crawlers and gulp alive minnows I have a bunch of those I have never tried.
