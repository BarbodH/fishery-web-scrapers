Wayne was not an internet fan, thus not a Walleye Central regular; but he was one of us. Wayne had a deep appreciation for the Canadian Shield. He understood like we, the wonders and beauty of the wilderness, its sights, sounds, smells, and unparalleled visual beauty. Wayne lived for his trips to Canada and he appreciated every minute of them. His father introduced him to fishing in the 60's  Pelican Lake, Gull Rock, Lac La Croix,. He renewed his love for Canadian Fishing, I think it was 1979 when he joined our group on a fly-in with Bill Mossbeck. Wayne has been doing fly-ins ever since. He's been going to Hammerhead with Showalter's for at least 25 years. Lately he was doing a two week trip early in the season followed by a one week trip mid-season and he never took it for granted. Though he knew every rock, structure and feature of the lake, he was always energized by the challenge presented by the environmental nuances that would change the patterns of fishing. He developed a wisdom and patience and tolerance over the years that bred camaraderie among the anglers fortunate enough to share the trip with Wayne and Barry. It was my fortune to demonstrate the backreeling technique with Wayne at the net when I landed my first trophy Northern on 6# test line and a 1/8th oz. jig 30 years ago. Wayne's son, and grandson and my son were all blessed with Wayne's nightly cabin salutation  Good Night John Boy. We will miss his quick wit, his wide smiles and those hook scarred mitts he used for hands. He shared the values with many of the folks who visit this forum. He was one of us. He will be sorely missed. So lets lift a Blue in memory of Wayne and emulate his virtues. He will be with us as one of the good spirits tossing down spears of light from the Aurora into the Woodland Caribou Provincial Park."
