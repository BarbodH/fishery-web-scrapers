1089662,scotttheguide,2009-03-20 21:15:00,73,Thanks for the feedback so far everyone. This is really going to help when I talk to some of the other Resort owners about what people want they come to Canada.
1089955,wolverine fan,2009-03-22 12:20:00,71,"Looks like im in the minority but since i dont own a boat the rental boat is the most important thing to me. Im only up there for a week and hopefully 90% of my waking hours are spent in that boat and i want those hours to be productive for me, i.e safe, comfortable, gear i need, and reliable. Seems i get one or two bad days in early june wherever i go and i sure as heck wouldnt want to be stranded or be in a undersized/motored boat when a storm is approaching. Dont get me wrong, i like decent accomodations but i would sleep outside to fish in canada once a year. This is all on the premise that the fishery was the most important thing to all. And last of all since i respect the water probably more than others (ie. dont swim well HA) it also adds into the mix. good fishin"
1090619,thunderatwork,2009-03-24 13:29:00,79,"Quality of fishing is #1, of course we have to have working motors, boats that can be kept afloat, and something that resembles a cabin to slept and eat in."
1091914,Deb Martin,2009-03-28 17:30:00,9,"They're all important to me, especially camp owner as I've met a few stinkers. Mostly because I love to fish late September and I think the season has worn a few owners down. But most important is that I have the lake to myself or that it feels that way. With a big lake, I know that's unrealistic. Still, I don't need to have other boats on top of me. But at some of my favorite camps, I have the lake to myself. I just tell the owner which lake I'm fishing any particular day and it's all mine. Boat is already there or delivered the night before. ""Reel"" Sweet, eh?"
1087962,scotttheguide,2009-03-14 12:26:00,73,"When you plan a Trip to Canada what are the most important elements of your trip? We have conversation about this all the time and I would just like to hear from some of you that come to Canada every year.I have listed the 4 main element that seem to come up all the time in a quick pole, you can choose more than 1 answer. Thank you."
1088006,REG,2009-03-14 16:19:00,445,"Good question.Shouldn't you have an option for quality of fishery too? That one would probably trump anything else.We go to a camp that does a nice job on all counts including the fishery but I think it's when a resort has (or develops) an issue with any of the above, you are more likely to start ""shopping""."
1088022,Baitslinger,2009-03-14 17:02:00,93,"Interesting question. Nothing is more important to us than the quality of the fishery. Without a good fishery, I'm not even interested in looking at the trip. If the fishery is good, I move on to price. We go as a family of four, so high dollar fly ins with gourmet meals and guides just dont work at the same time we're saving for a couple college educations. The boat in option has worked well for us over the past few years. If we find a good fishery at a reasonable price, then I'd look at cabins; boats are a minor issue, and even less is the owner. However, the number of other boats & anglers is important. I dont want to go to canada to experience combat fishing."
1088049,Guest,2009-03-14 19:47:00,0,"I agree that the fishery has to be good otherwise, whats the point of going there. Next is price. I can't afford a high end resort but look for something nice and clean. Service is next. Good equipment and meals round out my needs. We have been lucky to have found a nice resort in Canada where there is great fishing, excellent service, with good accomodations and nice boats. They really try to take care of their customers. Because of this, we keep going back year after year. Wingmann"
1088063,scotttheguide,2009-03-14 21:40:00,73,"I know the fishery is the most important, but I am trying to get a feel for what the other key elements are that you look for at a Lodge or Resort, all fishing being considered equally good.Thanks, and your feed back is greatly appreciated."
1088116,fishmaster,2009-03-15 09:31:00,209,I went on a trip many years ago in Northern Wisconsin and we fished from not so good boats and the motors were old and the boats had not very good floatation on it. I know the rules are much better now so that being said the comfort of fishing when you are out pounding the water all day is a big plus. Good seats and plenty of room is a must. Cabins must be clean and it does help if the camp owner is doing his job in making your trip a good one.
1088177,oldntired,2009-03-15 13:22:00,57,"Assuming the fishery is good, I would have to say that the camp owner is very important. I turned down a chance to go with friends to Sask. last summer and Im glad I did. They arrived and fished till noon and after coming in for lunch the lodge owner would not let them go back out because he said it was to windy (rental boat). This continued for 2 days and the owner would not let them trailer the boats to a nearby calmer bay so they could get out and fish. Even when they finally got calmer weather the rules were ""no boats out before 8 a.m. and all boats back by 5 p.m. They only got to fish 2 1/2 days out of the week and they said the waves werent nearly bad enough to stay in for. They were terribly disappointed and still were charged for the weeks boat rental. This year they are going to the same lake but a different lodge and have checked out the rules and policies with the owner so they will have a better trip than last year. In my opinion I would have to say. 1. Quality fishery. 2. Reasonable lodge owner/operater 3. Good boats & motors 4. accomodations 5. price."
1088567,bassface44,2009-03-16 21:51:00,96,"Assuming that the fishery is a constant (decent numbers with a shot at ""trophy"" sized fish of varying species) I would be looking at the following: 1. Distance from origin and travel 2. Price 3. Boats and Motors 4. Accommodations Clearly price comes first. That is dictated somewhat by where I am vs. where i am going. But the next consideration in my planning is boats and motors if the fishery is a constant. The problem lies in the fact that the fishery is not a constant in many instances, so allowances are made accordingly. Our group tends to choose several fisheries that we deem are relatively equal and then debate the amenities. Usually the quality of boats and motors is tops on the list but in many cases there is not adequate information on the quality of a particular outfitters' B's and M's so you are forced to move down the list. It would be nice if outfitters would post the make and model of all motor options so guests can decide (ie we run 40hp 2008 mercury motors)."
1088593,bellbuoy,2009-03-17 04:47:00,490,"One that isn't on there, the memories you have of each and every trip."
1088832,breutzy,2009-03-17 18:17:00,12,"assuming all fishing is the same, we tend to look at price as we take along several youngsters and they do not have the ability to pay their own way yet.our trip is a once a year, save all year to go. after price is lodging."
