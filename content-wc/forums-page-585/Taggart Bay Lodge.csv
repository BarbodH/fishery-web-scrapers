I fall hunt Ontario and am very well satisfied with where we hunt and fish in Ontartio, but my wife and I would like to do a spring bear hunt in addition to our fall hunt. I did a search on this forum about them but most of the info was old. Thank You Ps. Forgot to ask about the walleye fishing too."
