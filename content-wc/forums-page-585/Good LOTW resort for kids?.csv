However looking at their webpage it appears the same guide (Bob) is there. I didn't care for him either. We had three guys and didn't want to fish four to a boat so I follwed him in my Lund, he didn't like it or my LORAN-C. He'd leave a spot and not come get us. We caught zilch. Later in the week when he returned from a successful guiding trip I asked where he had caught the fish and he would not tell me other than """"in the lake""."
1089594,MikeMcC,2009-03-20 16:56:00,72,"I am planning to try the Canadian side of LOTW this summer for a family vacation. I'm looking for a location that is good for kids. I am thinking about White Pine Lodge in Snake Bay. They look to have a lot to offer for kids, small northerns, bass and pan fish close. I am worried about walleye fishing in Whitefish Bay. Will we need to run out past Yellow Girl Point for fast walleye action? If so, how tough a run with Lund Tyee/150hp rig? Will be going the first week in August. Any thougths or suggestions on locations or alternatives. Thanks"
1089603,Obabikon,2009-03-20 18:01:00,2370,"I recommend going out of Morson. Yes, you will have to go up to Yellow Girl to catch walleyes.www.obabikon.com is my camp... however, there's several in the Morson area, depending on what you're looking for. Redwing Bueana Vista Sabaskong Bay Duck Bay Grassy Narrows All legitimate places."
1089640,Wall-i-Lama,2009-03-20 19:51:00,1524,"MikeMc, We stay at Tomahawk Resort and RV Park. It is very clean, modern and well ran resort. You can stay in cabins, bring an RV or camper. They have a nice beach, swimming dock with slide, paddle boat, volleyball and hiking trails. Boat docks are second to none. Resort folks are very helpful in providing fishing advice. Close to city of Sioux Narrows where they have grocery store, bait shop, burger shack and mini golf. They do not serve or have food facility at this resort. We fish some spots in Regina bay for small mouth, some in whitefish for northern and out past yellow girl for walleye. Good luck and have fun on your vacation!http://www.tomahawkresort.com/ Jerry"

1089693,Obabikon,2009-03-21 06:17:00,2370,"Mylies place is another fantastic spot, and probably the best location if you're coming from the mainland."
1089777,rpieske,2009-03-21 13:54:00,1276,You might check out Canadian Haven Resort in Nestor Falls. A good place for families.
1089787,Larry Mac,2009-03-21 15:19:00,530,"Hi MikeMcC, I have been taking kids to Canada for many years. I always do a substantial amount of research before going on any adventure. In my line of work I meet and talk with many people. I use that opportunity when appropriate to discuss Canadian options. With that said I do not know Obabikon who writes on Walleye Central never even talked with him/her. I have noticed that he/she has always been helpful and has never used this site inappropriately to suggest their camp. So I am going to take this opportunity to talk about their resort. I have spoken to many people who have kids and they have strongly recommended The Obabikon Camp. So many it really caught my attention. They have had many great things to say about that camp, everything from the facilities to the crappie dock to never even having to leave the bay to fish. IMHO if I were going to take my family to LOTW I would really take a hard look at that camp. Wherever you and your family decides to go have a fantastic tripSincerely,Larry Mac"
1089820,Guest,2009-03-21 18:39:00,0,"I think Obabikon is a good place to bring the kids. Lots of northern action around there plus the crappie dock should keep them occupied. Another good place that offers a variety of things for the whole family would be Red Indian lodge www.redindianlodge.com They have mini golf, kayaks, canoes, tennis courts and hiking trails. So if the kids don't want to fish, there are a variety of things to do. Hope this helps. Wingmann"
1089827,Obabikon,2009-03-21 19:28:00,2370,Thank you both for your positive comments. Walleye central seems to be a good place to meet fishermen of all types. I don't hide the fact that we really try to push father/son or family groups... especially in July when the crappie dock is great. It definately is nice to hear that we have a good reputation.
1090047,rpieske,2009-03-22 18:35:00,1276,People who have never seen the crappie dock in full swing at Obabikon can not begin to realize the HUGE numbers of crappie caught. I have gone by there in my boat and been amazed at the kids (and not so little kids 40+ years old) lifting stringers of big crappies on to the dock. Kids will definitely catch fish there.
