They are driving on at Challis Beach to the mouth of the Red. Sleds and hit and run in a portable is more productive.There are significant ice heaves that jet out into the lake and parallel the shore so no matter what use a GPS to mark trails and tracks. A GPS will save you keister up there for sure!!Case and point...the other day in the Tuesday big blow and relatively light snow on the lake a crew was scattered out. Three had GPS 2 did not, they lost one guy for some time tell they did a grid and located him and they all escorted off together. Same day a guy in the crew was stepping out of the shack to take care of Biz and in a few steps his hat was ripped from his head in the wind so he started to chase it a few more steps...total white out...he gave up on the hat and still had difficulty locating his shack again. A few more steps and who knows, he may have wondered off into deep ice and got lost for good in that -40 wind chill...not good...he said it scared him a bit and he learned a valuable lesson.My Garmin is securely attached to me at all times on the lake...just in case...with a back-up battery pack.Fishing continues to be good even in the tough conditions and the cold. Not balls out crazy but you keep busy and big sumo Greenbacks swing in to play from time to time so it keeps interesting. All my fish except for a few perch were well over 19"" and my biggest this trip was shy of 29""..dropped a few ><,sUMo,> hogs in the hole....that always keeps a guy well focused on the next fish.Stu and the gang at ""Cats on the Red"" treated me well, as always, they keep you pointed in the right direction and look after you well. Cat's Guests can expect a free flow of information on the best areas and tactics to use. The guests always work as a team out there and we all look after each other, that is nice, friends and new found friends alike fishing for fun and looking after there fellow anglers...you got to love that.Fun trip, kinda C-c-c-cool at times..(-40 wind chills)...but I'm ready to go back ASAP!Baits and tactics:I had good luck with Salmo Zippers in Silver Blue Orange belly, Green Tiger Zipper, Salmo Chubbys in LBD, LOD, GMO, and Candlestick. Chubby's worked well in #5's and #6's.I also had a very good bite on Reel Baits Plain Jane jigs in 1/2 oz in the Superman and Firetiger patterns. Replace your treble hooks with Triple Grip trebles! This is very key to holding and sticking these fish while fishing barb-less hooks. Get grips one size larger then original equipment on that lure. Keep extras as they can bust off hooks at times and spares are handy.The Gold plated Reel Baits Flasher jigs were good as were the Metallic Flashers in Blue and Red...they like flash.Jig them up...some will race up 12' to smack a Chubby if they are hot to go. Then latter on they may not wish to leave the bottom so the flasher jigs produced best there...so keep the switch off rod handy to convert lookers into hookers.Stick with the best salted shiners you can get. They want shiner scent, don't waist your time dealing with and hunting for live bait...not worth the unnecessary expense or the hassle...stick with shiners or Gulp has worked well too at times, or a combo of a bit of each...RED GULP.Thanks for everything Stu!

1088111,Backwater Eddy,2009-03-15 09:17:00,3871,"The weather is really looking Sweet up North on the Big Lake this week...(Go Figure..I just got back and it was cold and windy yet fairly productive fishing)...so with the increased mobility on the ice the action should really heat up out on the lake. Reports already sound very good, I know some ice crews on the ice now and they are doing 20 - 40 fish days and some serious over sized Catch and Release Greenback sumo's mixed in. The last 2 weeks before the MB Walleye season close should be interesting to say the least.With luck, I'll get to slip back up one more time.....maybe."
1089411,Backwater Eddy,2009-03-19 22:08:00,3871,Reports trickling in continue to be very good. I think we will see a flood of new 10 pound club entries on the WC boards real soon.I predict a bunch from the Fargo/Moorhead area...starting about Monday.
1090444,Backwater Eddy,2009-03-24 04:32:00,3871,"I understand the fishing was preaty darn good for a few crews up on the lake last week, and this past weekend.Don't be shy now guys...lets here it."
1090463,walleyedude2001,2009-03-24 05:48:00,76,"I was fortunate to be invited along w/ ""the crew"" from Fargo last weekend & probably had some of the best ice fishing in a long time. Several fish over 25"" with a 27""+ being the largest. Some did manage to take some 29"" + fish & one person in the group caught a 10-11# & then have a chance at an even larger one only to have it come off right below the hole. Alot of 22"" plus fish caught. I had one 21"" that I should have weighed, it was like a football. Congrats to team ""Randash"" for winning the tourney. I think it was rigged. Next year Dave, your wife is on our team. Alot of people on Saturday during the little bragg'n rights tourny. The locals were very generous in having a chilly feed along with walleye fry on the ice. Hmmm. Steve & Roger (the two local spear heads) not only put all on fish but kept them on them throughout the weekend. Thanks for the local hospitality of all involved. The ice conditions were good, the only issue was the heave out about a 1/4 mile from the landing which changed hourly/daily. Friday morning it opened up a bit but with a few ice/snow chunks, it was passable. On Saturday, little problem. Sunday morning saw the heave raise up a bit but was manageable. By mid-day the ice rose to have about a 3' drop which was a little hard on some rigs. With the wind all day, I bet by afternoon it might have changed dramaitcally, good or bad (my guess would be bad). All in all, a great trip worth the effort. I even look forward to going back next year for that chance @ a fish of a life time."
1090498,kastmaster,2009-03-24 08:15:00,6,"6 of us fished Lake Winnipeg for the first time this past weekend. Man what an awesome place to fish. From Friday afternoon until Sunday morning, 6 of us iced about 100 walleyes. We had 4 over 10 lbs with the biggest being 12.5. We also had a couple 8's. Most of the fish were in that 3-6 lb range. I would like to thank Backwater Eddy for all of the info he gave us. It came in very handy. We stayed with Stu at ""Cats on the Red""!!!! He is a class act. He even drove us most of the way to his secluded access point. I would recommend talking with either of these 2 guys if you plan on heading up that way. We will be back for more next winter!!!!! Thanks again Backwater Eddy and Stu!!!!"
1090728,Backwater Eddy,2009-03-25 01:16:00,3871,"Your very welcome Kastmaster. The Red River and the Lake Winnipeg system is a phenomenal fishery, and the top end on these giants has yet to be seen. I just got an email on a 33"" plus girthy sumo Greenback that went 17# from up there, and I'm confident that is far from the top end yet.You will have to experience the Red River early in the ice season too, get you some sumo eye's and the game plan is a bit different and the numbers tend not to be as high on average in the river...but the size...UF-DA!!Now that you wet your taste for them Salmo Chubby Darters and the Salmo Zipper, you will have to watch for some new patterns due out in 2010 that may interest you. I hoped to get back up one more time to hit the ice but due to the flood fight we have going now on the Central Red River here in Fargo ND that may not be in the cards. Yet them giant catfish will not be too far off, and I'm all up to get back on them in May. High water springs tend to spell crazy spring sumo channel catfishing up North. That is something you need to try too...(DANGER...Sumo Kitty fish'n is highly addictive stuff)...don't say I didn't warn ya. Hope to catch up to you on the ice or on the soft water some time soon."
1090778,rednuht,2009-03-25 07:54:00,1,Hey I am just wondering how the ice is at the mouth of the river on lake winnipeg. a few of use want to fish it this weekend and need to know now the ice is. Can we drive trucks or sleds? hows the fishing?
1090819,Backwater Eddy,2009-03-25 09:56:00,3871,"Call Stu at ""Cats on the Red"" and get the most recent info on conditions. Ice is deep, not sure I would fish the mouth as the flow in up and the ice there will be the worst..first.We are dealing with the flood here in Fargo and lots of water will head North soon. So Stu is the best man to check in with on conditions. ""Cats on the Red"" 1-204-757-9876"
1091179,LeeMB,2009-03-26 07:20:00,83,"There is lots of good ice on the lake. I would not fish near the mouth. Too much dirty water. This time of year you want to fish clean water only. Stay away from the other red river chanells, thin ice.I haven't been out since Monday, I will make it out on Thur. afternoon if the wind goes down. Friday for sure. I will post ice conditions."
