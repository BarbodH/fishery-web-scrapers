1083208,toolboy,2009-02-23 21:40:00,515,"My dad has decided he wants to go to Canada with me and the grandkids. We won't go for at least a year, but are starting to look for places to go. We will be taking our own boat, going from southern Minnesota, and want to fish for walleyes and northerns. If you know of a place that is not too expensive on a lake with good chances, I would appreciate your suggestions."
1083254,Bill Krejca,2009-02-24 07:21:00,6107,"A good fish/cost ratio is at O'Sullivans Rainbow, near Nakina. Lots of good size walleyes, not necessary to go far from camp. Secluded location, drive to. www.osullivansrainbow.com Bill Krejca"

1083389,tackleman,2009-02-24 16:38:00,444,do a google search for sunset country. it has a ton of fishing lodges that are close to minnesota and more than likely you will find something that meets your budget.

1083555,PRD1,2009-02-25 08:13:00,458,"This will be our 10th year at Halley's Camps on the English River. They have one drive in and two boat/fly in facilities on Umfreville Lake which is on SW part of the river just NW of Minaki. For your case it may be attractive depending on the age of your younger fishemen because kids under 16 stay for half price. We have always caught lots of fish (walleye, pike and smallies) and it is in the Trophy Waters area of Ontario so all big fish go back. It's worth considering: http://www.halleyscamps.com/"
1083913,REG,2009-02-26 10:10:00,445,"We like Snake Falls Camp on Pakwash. www.snakefalls.com My kids have always had a great time - walleyes and northerns close to camp, great facilities, and there is a trampoline (always popular with the kids)"

If you're going to go to Canada it's as close as you can get. www.obabikon.com If we're not your type of resort, PM me, and I'll make several suggestions."
