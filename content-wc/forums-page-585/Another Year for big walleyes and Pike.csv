1089937,dlnemer,2009-03-22 10:39:00,1,I just heard that the fishing on Nunngesser lake north of Red lake is truely awesome. My friends came back from that area last fall and they caught 5 walleyes over 30 inches and 2 47 inch Northerns as well as the usuall massive numbers of Walleye. The equipment and service was great. I also was at the 77th Northwest Sportshow in Minneapolis and was told that they are going to wire up the lake for an interactive live fishing show with discussions and trivia. WOW that is RADICAL! Have you guys heard anything?
