1088584,Guest,2009-03-17 00:03:00,0,"When crossing into Canada last year, all members in our group were asked how much additional gas we had for the boats. Is there a limit and if so, how much?"
1088596,Tonyo,2009-03-17 05:42:00,212,"I'm not sure of the answer on, ""how much gas you can take in with you for your boats"" but our outfitter doesn't allow gas to be brought into camp. We are required to purchase our gas at camp. To be honest, I don't see a problem with this, since I don't want to be going to town to get 5 gallon cans of gas and hauling them down to the boat while on vacation. The small amount you would save by doing this is totally outwayed by the the work needed to get this done. I am on vacation and will pay the small amount more for them to fill up my boat daily. I'm on vacation to relax and enjoy myself, not work to save $20 for the week. Just my $.02. Tonyo"

1088649,retire55,2009-03-17 08:26:00,1029,Here's the information from the Canada Border Services Agency - see http://cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/...eng.html#s2x12
1088754,Guest,2009-03-17 13:31:00,0,Tonyo Time for you to find a new outfitter. $.02 is overpriced and this is the correct spelling for Missouri. Thanks and have a great trip!
1089497,plogsdon,2009-03-20 09:57:00,14,Thanks for the feedback. Phil
1089529,Boots,2009-03-20 13:17:00,19,I dont think you are allowed to take unprossed meats like steaks hambuger or pork chops into Canada. Canned meat is allowed.
1089572,joeman79,2009-03-20 15:58:00,417,yes you can take like 20 pounds of meat per person I think
