I want to catch Pike, Musky, Smallies, walleye. I would prefer to cast. I've fished St. Clair, Rice, and Georgian Bay and am strongly considering Georgian Bay since I haven't been in 25 years. Want to go back to LOTW but to far for this summer. Numbers as well as a chance at some size is important. Any Recommendations? Thanks in advance."
1088498,Guest,2009-03-16 18:18:00,0,You may want to try a camp that is east of Sault Ste. Marie. My trip planner says it takes 11 hours to the Soo from Columbus. There are several camps to choose from. You have to do a little research.
1088523,Guest,2009-03-16 19:36:00,0,"i drive that aolt during the year and it should take you about 9 hours to the soo. im 2 hrs south of col and i regularly make it in 9.5 hours home but im driving too fast, figuring 65 mph and a couple stops 9 should be your ticket. Good luck"
