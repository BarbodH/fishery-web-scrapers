Anyhow, it's intersting to see how the sunny weather and just a little financial good news makes a huge difference in interest. People are more up beat, and definately more interested in a summer trip. Even on here... seems like since the weather has changed, more people are posting."

It didn't help going to the local Bass Pro a few weeks back and they were running a walleye seminar. That walleye in the tank just loved what the pro was showing on rigging ideas. Plus that little ""issue"" we had last year that cut a few days off our trip has me itching to make up lost time! Alan"
