1089231,Steve of Madison,2009-03-19 09:36:00,230,"""Spot"" is good for locating you. There are much better choices for a GPS that will do much more for you. Problem is, many GPS units have way to many ""things"" that they do, and you need to take a course from the local College just to use them all. I am going to purchase the Lowrance H2oc with the navionics chip for my Ontario trips. Used a friends last year and was very impressed by it's accuracy, color screen, and ease of use. And it even showed me a couple mid-lake humps that I didn't know were there, even after 10 weekly trips over 8 yrs. If anyone has an even better idea we are all eyes."
1089270,LeeMB,2009-03-19 12:06:00,83,I had guest bring up a spot system last year. It was great for me to check the web site and see where they were and where they had been. It is not the system for in boat travel.

Not exactly a spot type tool for locating you but very nice for emergencies with FRMS radio ability."
