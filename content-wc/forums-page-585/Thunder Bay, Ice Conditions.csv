1089680,fishman10,2009-03-20 23:48:00,226,"the ice in the bay is still pretty stable. the days are getting warmer, but the nights are still cool. last night was -19. the weather is going to get warmer in the next week but the ice will hold out good. the ice in nipigon bay is 3 feet thick right now. check thunder bay fishing website for up to date info."
1090172,Guest,2009-03-23 09:16:00,0,"There is 24""-28"" of ice in the Bay. I was out on Saturday, conditions were incredible, and fishing for lakers was steady in 100'-135'. There is a critical bait shortage in Thunder Bay right now....so we've been hitting 'the big lake' quite a bit, in order to use our frozen smelt caught last spring (which is legal only on Superior). Unless things change dramatically (and right now there is nothing in the forecast to suggest such), fishing will be good out there for another 3 weeks anyway. Cheers, NWO Fishing Bum"
1090187,Guest,2009-03-23 10:16:00,0,"Thanks guys! We're fired up, leaving Wednesday to fish thru Sunday. We'll be bringing some herring with us, good to know about the bait shortage. Smelt better than herring? Thanks also for the heads-up on depth, sounds like my Marcum might come with (usually fish 190' + in the Apostle Islands ... too deep for the 160' max on the Marcum). NWO FishingBum ... we'll most likely be on the east side of the bay itself, any other tips for that area? THANKS AGAIN!"
1090227,Guest,2009-03-23 11:42:00,0,"Hey Smeds, You're in luck....I fish only the east side of the Bay, from due east of Caribou Island down towards the head of the Sleeping Giant, usually about 400m to 800m off-shore, in anywhere from 90' to 180'. Alot of the action this past weekend came in around 130' of water and pretty tight to bottom. Sweedish Pimples and other jigging spoons (3/4oz. - 1 1/2oz.) with a chunk of cut smelt has provided steady action for several weeks now. We always remove trebles and replace them with red #1 or #2 Gamakatsu single hooks. I definately recommend a flasher! As fishman said, you will probably get more tips than you need if you post your question on the Thunder Bay Fishing message board. NWO Fishing Bum"
