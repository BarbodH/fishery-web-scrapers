1089191,Gary from Iowa,2009-03-19 07:09:00,74,"I've see the Eagle Cuda 350 advertised from $200 to $250. While the promo material mentions the built in map of much of the US and coastal waters, it doesn't mention if it will take a chip. I've heard mention of a Canada North chip. Will it work in this sonar/gps and does the chip provide bottom contours of Canadian lakes? Are there other lower priced portable sonar/gps units that will take a chip and what is the on the water cost? How many hours of study does a neophyte need to use it?"
