1090281,alanexpup,2009-03-23 14:17:00,278,I would say that if while you are trolling you catch a perch you could unknowingly leave it on the hook and continue to troll and then catch whatever went for it.
1090338,Guest,2009-03-23 17:05:00,0,"Hi Noel, Are you sure they were perch minnows? There are a lot of Sticle Back minnows up here that get into mixed bags of minnows. I'm thinking they might be stickle back minnows. Roger"
1090365,Obabikon,2009-03-23 18:42:00,2370,"Roger, I know what he's talking about, as I've seen huge schools of perch minnows. Late in the year, they appear to be the perfect minnow size. Even used my minnow net to catch some to see what they were. Stickle backs don't have the stripes or colors that a baby perch has... I think it'd be difficult to confuse the two (but hey, I've overestimated people's ability of perception before!)."

1090400,EsoxProSport,2009-03-23 20:02:00,24,Wow...never thought my original post would draw much attention... in the regs I read that a trout-perch was an accepted baitfish.. looking further I found a trout-perch is a minnow and neither a trout or a perch. Thats where some of my question originated... Certainly not looking to do anything illegal or not trying to catch muskies on perch. Like I stated in another post it is legal to use them in Wisconsin. Another thought I had was regarding this VHS disease... often spread by transporting minnows and bait. Using Perch as bait caught in the same water you are fishing sounds like a better idea than importing bait that could spread disease. Food For thought..
1088876,EsoxProSport,2009-03-17 21:11:00,24,Wondering if it is legal to use perch as bait in Ontario? Going to fish Lake Of the Woods again this year and the kids always catch them off the dock.. we do this in Wisconsin where it is perfectly legal.. info I found online is not clear.
1088880,Obabikon,2009-03-17 21:27:00,2370,"No it is not... perch is a game fish, and the use of game fish as bait is against the law. (it's also danerous if you're looking for Muskies, as this is much more likely to injure/kill the fish)"
1088884,EsoxProSport,2009-03-17 21:42:00,24,thanx for the info.... are you getting this info from a MNR booklet? we lindy rig them for Walleye in Wisconsin or use them on tip ups.... here it is perfectly legal as long as they are caught by hook and line in the same water you will be using them as bait. Same goes for bluegills for catching catfish.
1088888,Obabikon,2009-03-17 21:48:00,2370,It is in the MNR book... it's not a new law and it's really clear. No game fish (in any form) can be used as bait. That includes rock bass
1088935,JinxCanada,2009-03-18 06:48:00,1306,"as an alternative, i strongly suggest you try out some Gulp alive...i had excellent sucess with them last year. or, if you really want the perch look i found some nice perch soft plastics with jig included at bass pro shops last year but i never ended up using them."
1089532,Noel,2009-03-20 13:27:00,115,Last year my camp owner on Lac Seul would fill everyones minnow bucket in the morning. It was part of the package for the week. There were lots of perch minnows in with the regular minnows. I never thought about it. I will have to ask him this year. I dont want to get pinched for illegal bait.
1089581,Obabikon,2009-03-20 16:14:00,2370,"I'm not sure about ""perch minnows"". I've never purchased a batch from my dealer that had any of those. However, I'd assume that sport fish are sport fish... no matter how small."
1090234,geareng,2009-03-23 11:58:00,335,"I have also used perch for bait in Wisconsin. In fact last year before heading up to Lac Seul, I called the Ministry of Natural Resouces to ask them that very question. There response was that as long as the perch was caught with a hook and line, it was legal to use it for bait in the same body of water."
1090242,Obabikon,2009-03-23 12:27:00,2370,"Gear, I'd be careful with that. (don't want people having the wrong information). The MNR officer may have gotten it wrong, unless they've changed the law in the past 2 years. In Ontario sport fish are not allowed to be used as bait, that's the rule I've always been told (and read)."
1090280,J-Man,2009-03-23 14:11:00,191,"Jared is correct. Perch is NOT on the list of accepted baitfish in Ontario.Please see MNR fishing regulations summary:http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...ge/198684.htmlThe regs are very clear on this point.It certainly wouldn't be the first time that someone at a government agency gave out incorrect information. Unfortunately, that happens often.Please don't give the COs a reason to ruin your day."
