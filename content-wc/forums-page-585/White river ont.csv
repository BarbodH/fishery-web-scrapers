The great lakes are off the beaten trail and will require some work to get into those. You keep asking about a cabin. A sleeping bag and a tarp is all a guy needs. When my wife and I travel here in the states, and we travel a lot, I don't think twice about spending 150-200 per night. When I am fishing I want to be on remote lakes. No cabins."
