1074631,lobo1,2009-01-19 13:58:00,734,"To us - it used to be mainly about the fish. We wanted camps that would provide virgin action - like 70-100+ or better fish a day per person and/or we were looking for trophy pike fisheries with good numbers of 40+ pike and a good shot at a bigger CPR wall mount. We never had to, actually found some great places, but we would have fished out of a tent. As time went on and fishing buddies either lost jobs or interest I started taking family - father, wife, younger kids.........now it changes. Pretty fast action remains on the list but added to that was nice accommodations.......but trophy fishing is no longer a necessity and moved way down or off the list. Like obabikon said - figure what you want and/or need and there is a list you can pick from lobo1"
1074859,Old Timer,2009-01-20 12:20:00,255,"The easy choice is to stay put and fish the lake you know. But the real adventure is moving on from place to place, learning new water and, perhaps, catching more and bigger fish. It's a risk, of course. But if you do your homework you won't be disappointed with the accomodations and the fishing action. I've been snake-bit more by bad weather than I ever have been by a camp or outfitter. Other posters are right, set your price point and then work from there. You still can find very good fishing at very affordable prices.My best advice is to start with good maps and search out lakes situated on strong river systems. Then look for camps and operators on those systems. I jumped around for many years and developed a stable of good camps and operators depending on what kind of trip I want. Some of the operators advertise and show up at sport shows but most do not. They're continually busy without looking for new customers."
1074885,Guest,2009-01-20 15:19:00,0,"All good information. One thing we did a decade ago, was helpful so I will share. We had been at a resort in NW Ontario for several years and at the end of that summer trip we booked it for the next year when left, but over the fall and winter we felt we needed a change (largely based on the fishing quality). Such a change was a big deal because we had been largely satisfied and liked the owners. Yet we did a bit of research and found another resort, just an hour away on a different body of water with a set of attributes that we felt might fit better. We called this new resort owner up and told him our situation and he invited us to stay for a couple of days prior to our week at our old resort. Of course we paid the daily rate for those two days and we were fortuante that our group had the time to invest in a couple of days. Well the new resort fit our needs to a ""t"" and we have been going there for a decade. I felt good about the change because we did not leave the old resort owner out of a reservation in winter and we had the chance to really experience the new resort without committing to it for the entire vacation. The new resort owner put forth a little effort on his part to accept a ""1.5 day"" party, yet that investment has paid off nicely for him in the decade since. Many resorts don't have the opening for a couple of days right before or after your current trip but if you can, nothing beats spending time at resort to check it out. One thing I like is that yesterday I fish here and tomorrow there, then you can really gauge the fishing because you lose the ""should have been here last week."" Finally remember, in a brochure, I am 6'4"" and am good looking, but in reality I am not sure I break 6' the only person that thinks I am good looking is my wife and even then its from a distance. Who puts out a brochure that says, our fishing is only marginally better than in the States, our beds are uncomfortable, the boats leak a bit, and the engines normally start. At a minimum, review sites like this and ask questions. The more info you have, the better your decison and the more satisified you will be your vacation IA Walleye"
1074992,cowboyd,2009-01-20 23:03:00,33,"That may be the one tougher question to answer than who should I marry? I don't know if you do more than one trip a year or not but if you do you may want to consider what our group does. We are very happy with one lake and do sometimes switch between outfitters on that lake ( only three to chose from) and sometimes we need two camps because of the size of our group. Someone has said earlier they had been bitten by weather much more than the outfitters and I have to agree. It is a very important thing to take into account when you measure the actual fishing part. I don't care how good a lake is when you deal with front after front moving through it is going to be tough fishing!But back to the issue of chosing,as I said above the fall trip is settled but we also take a spring trip every year and that trip is with a new outfitter at a new lake. I have to admitt many of the spring trips would be better spent at the same lake as the fall when measured by fishing success, but we do enjoy the variety. Our intention is to find another spring home but five years or more of variety has yet to produce that one. We are off to another camp in May and as always have high expectations this may be the one.We use the All Canda show too and our group makes a night out of it walking the isles and talking with camps in the area we want to fish. Then we head out to eat, drink and narrow it down to two or three finalists and do more research on them. We look for owners or operators who will be there all summer ( another great point made earlier that promises made by people who don't have to face you are easily broken ). We also put a lot of stock in how many repeat customers are around the booth and what kind of reactions they share with us ( just because there are no repeat customers there doesn't mean a whole lot because a lot of that is timing but no customers and no references found on sites like this is a concern ). Lastly you have to feel comfortable with the people at the show ( above criteria ) so many of them project the image of they don't really care if you come or not. Those that seem sincere, eagerly volunteer past customers as references, and have a can do attitude vs reasons for not being able to do something you want are, we feel, the best bets.Bottom line follow your gut........use your head and go into just like any adventure......hoping for the best but prepared for the worst. What to they say "" A Bad day at fishing is better than a good day at work"" ?Good luck and have fun.Dick"
1075675,Dan G,2009-01-24 06:04:00,31,"Scott:Since I fish there often...let me first pitch Lake of the Woods. It has an unsurpassed variety of fish. You can also fish almost any time of the summer and have an excellent fishing experience. As far as which resort to go to...I do empathize with you. I too went to the All Canada Show and found myself like a deer in headlights. They all look the same after a while too. In many cases you have to go with your gut reaction. Something they say or do may be the trigger to fishing out of a certain resort. I agree with another writer...many places have great brochures...but until you see and fish a place in person, you really don't know what you are getting. Research on the web can help you narrow your places. If a resort is unwilling to give you customer references, be wary. Best yet..if you can find someone you know to give you a reference then you are getting it from a source you truly know. Good fishing!"
1076235,Guest,2009-01-26 16:23:00,0,"For what your looking for, I have a recommendation that meets all your criteria. Silver Water Wheel Lodge has a one-cabin outpost on Lac Seul. While I have never stayed at the outpost, the resort itself is first class. I have spoken with the parties coming back from the outpost and they have nothing but great things to say about the experience. The boats are outstanding (in fact better than most camps standard resort boats) and the fishing on LS is first rate. You will catch walleyes, bass, northern pike and perch. Sorry but no lake trout in Lac Seul (LS). This is an out post so you are cooking your own meals and on your own. You boat in with a member of the resort who makes sure everthing is to your and the resorts standards (high) before leaving you and I do believe they do a mid-week check to make sure everything is OK. SWWL (Silver Water Wheel Lodge has a web site that has more details. I have been a guest of the resort now for a week in June for a decade and cannot say one thing bad about my experiences at the resort. Best of luck in your search...IA Walleye"
1077664,Steve of Madison,2009-01-31 15:32:00,230,"By your criteria there are only about ...uhhh...1000 or so places. SWW was recommended in an earlier post, I'm sure a great place, but if you do not need to be guided everyday, can cook your own meals, make your own bed, bait your own hook, and simply can do for yourself, save some big bucks and look elsewere. Lac Suel, Eagle LOW, Red Lake area, all will fit your bill."
1077669,Guest,2009-01-31 15:42:00,0,"Steve: SWWL is a resort, but it also has an outpost cabin, which was what I was referring to. Thus, if you have the desire to do the outpost thing and the fun of doing everything yourself, its an option to consider. With my 79-year old father as part of our group, doing an outpost is really not an option, but a resort that does it all, fits the bill. SWWL is terrific and the outpost gives you the option the origional poster was looking for. Cheers....IA Walleye"
1078969,Steve of Madison,2009-02-06 07:35:00,230,"Fantastic...SWW has an outpost cabin, is it available most of the time...I'm betting not! SWW is a High end Resort , only it's located on LS, and you pay big bucks for it. My group cannot spend that kind of money, nor do we need or even want the kind of services it provides. We enjoy driving the boat and finding fish without a guide, I can clean my own fish, cook them, and clean up after myself, make my own bed, etc. I don't, and along with a great majority of others, want or need those services, and I save myself a great deal of money in the process. If you do, then concentrate on those resorts that do provide those services, and pay for them. By the way, our trip this year includes my 82 yr old Uncle, we catch just as many fish as the boats from SWW do comparing notes from thier posts, and we eat very well, when we decide to eat it instead of when we need to get back to the dining hall. The original poster asked how to decide where to go and how to choose a camp. Levels of services provided, along with costs are factors in making that decision"
1089378,Raymond3588,2009-03-19 19:38:00,3,"Hey Scott - you are not the only one who's head is swimin' over switching lakes - been on Eagle Lake for many moons and sometimes 2 or 3 times in one year - comfort (the lake and knowledge of patterns) is something none of us like to give up - but, I am gettin' older and want some new shoreline to look at (like it looks any different). One comment from a fellow angler on your post was to hire a guide for a day - that is one smart fisherman - do that and it'll make your trip a great one and boost confidence for the entire week - here is another idea - book a fly out trip to a remote lake out of Red Lake Ontario - if you choose this - contact Medicine Stone Resort and book Hy Vee Lake. Fished it in 1977; 1986; 1989; 1997 and 2004. They have a nice web site and good map of lake. We even caught some ""blue walleyes""; I thought it was a myth but it is not. My buddy nailed an 18"" blue and we put it back after a picture. Anyhoo - a fly in remote when you are the only one on the lake is something you should try one time. It is the TRUE walleye northern back country experience. You'll get some big one's if you stay with it. But, you'll get sick and tired of catching the very fat 18"" to 22"" walleyes until your arms fall off. (OK, might of got carried away on that comment a bit.) Good Luck"
1075745,Larry Mac,2009-01-24 11:48:00,530,"Hi Scott, We book 1 year in advance, i.e. 2009 have been in place and now we are looking at 2010. This gives us time to really research our options.First is what type of trip we want to take. This is usually driven by the people who are going and their budgets. When that is done it is the type, size and quality of the fishery, then the equipment and accommodations. If we are not going to a camp we have been to before we really like to talk to people who have been there several times. This website is invaluable for that. I agree the choices appear to be endless but again that also is a blessing. We have been going North many years and only had (1) disappointing experience and that was still better than work. Our adventure begins with the question ""where should we go next year"" and progresses from there. Have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1075778,2Labs,2009-01-24 14:53:00,685,"Yup. Oba put you on the right track.I would suggest one thing to add to Steve's post. Complete your list your priorities and then ask in the ""Canada Only"" forum on this site who can recommend a camp that fills those priorities. You will get feedback from the customer's perspective -- the best source available to you.I would suggest you include in your list the province or general location you would like the camp to be in IF YOU HAVE ONE. That would eliminate a lot of recommendations that would not even be close to an area to which you would prefer to go.Then you can check the website of the camps and can also talk to the owners and see if you like and feel comfortable with the people you talk to there."
1075933,ILScott,2009-01-25 11:47:00,139,"Thanks everyone for the replies. Based on Obabikon's reply I would be looking something similar to where I go now which would be the following.1. $1000 or less2. outpost or remote camp3. boat in4. Walleye, pike, smallies, lake trout, perch5. northwest ontario6. rent boatAny suggestions please post.Thanks Scott"
1075947,2Labs,2009-01-25 12:42:00,685,"Scott ... it was good to let us know what your chosen criteria are. But, unfortunately, you might find that the only people that will see them if you leave it on this thread are those who looked at your original topic -- ""How to decide where to go.""I suggest you start a new thread with your criteria listed in the startup. You might title it something like -- ""Looking For NW Ontario Camp With ..."". Then list your criteria in the post, and ask for input. You will reach a wider audience than just those of us who looked at this thread so far and you will catch the eye of those of us who fish primarily NW Ontaria as well. There have to be a lot of folks who can provide you with that input now that you have defined what you are looking for. Just be careful to check out the input provided. The more input you get on a particular resort the better, obviously, because it eliminates the possibility of someone with an other-than-honest agenda giving you alluring sales input (I am trying to say that nicely )."
1076230,Old Timer,2009-01-26 16:03:00,255,"Scott:For $1,000/person you should find any number of nice boat-in camps for four or five days of fishing within 100 miles north of the border. Most will be on Rainy or Lake of the Woods. But also nice places between there and Minaki. May be hard, though, to find a camp that offers quality fishing for all species during the same trip.Tell us whether you want housekeeping, modified American Plan or full American Plan, and the outer range across the border you're willing to drive. You'll get all sorts of good suggestions. Nobody here is going to recommend a dump. Some good places have already been suggested."
1074461,ILScott,2009-01-18 12:49:00,139,"I recently went to the ALL Canada show and all the places looked great. How does a person decide where to go? Why would a person go there? I have been to Canada 5 times and always the same place. Do other people have a hard time switching lakes, lodges if they have had a good experience? It seems to me that I have figured the lake system out, so why would I change and work hard for a week or be frustrated. How many people on this message board change lakes very or are you like me and stay at the same lake? Just some thoughts I had after the show.Scott"
1074478,Larry Mac,2009-01-18 15:01:00,530,"Hi ILScott, Just curious, which camp have you been going to and what species do you prefer?Thank you,Larry Mac"
1074479,tjsker,2009-01-18 15:05:00,301,"Fear of the unknown of a new lake can be mitigated by hiring a guide for the first day or two. You'll be a smarter fisherman if you do, at least on that lake."
1074485,Pooch,2009-01-18 15:43:00,4619,"If you presently are comfortable with and like the folks that run the camp are happy with the size and number of fish you catch then stay put at your present camp. That's easier said than done as there are so many great places to fish in Canada. So many good camps offering different amenities. Narrow your choices down by prioritizing what you want and or like in a camp. If you want indoor plumbing then ignore the camps that don't have cabins with indoor plumbing. Etc.. We used to move around every couple of years, but have settled on two camps and try to fish either of them whenever we can. Wife and I tried a new camp many years ago and while it was a good camp and the owners were very pleasant the fishing was disappointing and we left after several days. We should have done more homework and asked for opinions on this website. If you have a lake that you find interesting, post it here as this bunch of folks are not shy about giving you a report or sharing their experiences with you. A new lake is always a challenge that I enjoy. Both lakes we fish are large enough that even after many trips we still find places to fish that we have never even seen before. Keeps it interesting. Good luck and don't be afraid to move on ar stay put. Pooch"
1074486,Glenman12,2009-01-18 15:45:00,762,"Scott Im sure you will get a lot of responses here so Ill give you my take This year will be my 25th trip to Cedar Lake in Perrault Falls...I wont even say the name of the lodge because I think you are talking strictly fishing. Many years ago just before they instituted the new slot limits we were having trouble catching fish..I mean we caught them but really had to work for them..So we decided to go try another lake...it was a disaster for us..the lake was much bigger, the lodge owner would tell us spots to try, techniques to try but we really struggled..so we went back to Cedar Lake the following year..you say you have your lake figured out so why would you want to go somewhere else?..We have Cedar Lake figured out and thats why we keep going back..."
1074499,Jimmy Jig,2009-01-18 17:30:00,1905,"I have been going to the same lake and camp for many years. Like you, its the easy thing to do. I like the camp and owners, the price is right I would be hard pressed to equal that let alone beat it! The fishing is good and I have the lake sort of figured out. The water area is big with several lakes to use so I always have plenty of new water to investigate. I guess at my age I will continue to do as always until I can no longer make the trip. I am looking forward to June and another Canadian vacation!! Good Luck, just go fishing........."
1074529,lobo1,2009-01-18 19:04:00,734,"We've been to numerous places - always looking for a place worthy of a return visit. All depends on what you want in a trip. If your needs are being met why would you change? I've found a drive-to lodge that will meet my needs and have found two outfitters for fly-ins that can do the same......so I no longer shop around. I can tell you that when I was looking around for places to go that just about everybody has great looking brochures, websites etc but not many of them actually produce the goods. If you listed on your post exactly what your priorities were I bet you would get a number of suggestions. AND if you search the WC archives for the names of your top prospects - you will probably find lots of info on them good luck lobo1"
1074551,SinOrSwim,2009-01-18 21:38:00,1528,"It can go both ways. We have been doing a fly-in for about 14 years. After year 3 or 4 we tried a new outfitter/camp. It was a DISASTER. Nothing as promised and he didn't care as he was in the process of selling the cabins. We liked where we were but were looking for bigger fish. However, it actually worked out well. The new owner helped mediate the problem with the ""old"" owner who we went with. We ended up going with the new owner the next year and have been with him ever since. Yes, it took some time to figure out the lake but we have been catching much bigger fish and the facilities are outstanding ever since. It's a crapshoot really. Tough to take chances when it's a single trip per year."
1074570,Obabikon,2009-01-19 07:18:00,2370,"Two other outfitters and I were talking about this exact thing yesterday at the St. Louis show. I'd be very happy to visit any of the outfitters at most of these shows. Everyone has a unique aspect. What you need to do is make a list of things you want in a resort. Then put those in order of importance. Examples: First set a price range American plan/housekeeping/outpost camps Drive-to/Boat-in/Fly-in Walleye/Muskie/Northern/Crappie/Perch/Small mouth Close to the border/Far north Bring own boat/rent a boat If you set these (and more), it will narrow your search. There are so many resorts out there, you should not settle for something that's not quite what you want. Also, talk to the owners at the show... those are the people you'll deal with. If it's not someone who will be at the camp when you're there, I personally wouldnt' feel comfortable (even if it's a camp manager, guide, cook, cabin girl or dock boy that's fine). Simply because promises can be made, and broken without much effort. Especially if the person won't be there to witness the outcome. Anyhow, know what you're looking for before you shop... you'll get more enjoyment out of the trip if it's exactly what you need."
1074630,Steve of Madison,2009-01-19 13:55:00,230,"O is correct, afterall he should know. Make your list of priorities, talk to the people at the shows, but remember, they do not represent ALL of the very good camps. Some very good camps do not attend the shows because it doesn't make financial sense to attend. Search the web as well. Make a couple of choices and then post them here. Someone else on this site has had experiences with your choices. Good Luck"
