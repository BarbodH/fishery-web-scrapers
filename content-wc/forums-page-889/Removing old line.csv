529458,Guest,2003-04-04 14:27:00,0,Berkely sells a line stripper for under $10. Operates on one or two C batteries. Very convenient. Be sure to recycle your line....it's deadly to fish and birds if they get caught in it.
529459,Wisconeye,2003-04-04 20:11:00,79,"I simply use a an old coffee can.I drill a 5/16 hole in the bottom, exactly in the center and put a 3"" x 1/4"" bolt in hole. You need a bolt with threads all the way from the head to end then stick the bolt through the hole from the inside. Run the nut up the bolt on the outside until tight on the can.I put the bolt into any electric drill. Tie the line around the can and turn on the drill. The line will wrap around the can and strip the reel in a hurry. I then cut the line off the can quickly and either burn it or take it to my local sporting goods store.Quick and cheap."

529464,Guest,2003-04-07 06:33:00,0,"No problem Rusty. When we get to Canada I go down to the dock where my buddy is launching the boat. As soon as he gets her in and is pulling away, I cast the jig head, less hook, to him. As he motors away the line is easily stripped away. Hang onto your pole tight and when the line reaches the end it snaps right off. My buddy then throws the jig head into the water where it sinks the line. Takes 20 seconds!"

529466,Ivy,2003-04-07 15:24:00,556,I thought Dick tied one end of his line to a Sea Gull and let the bird take it.
