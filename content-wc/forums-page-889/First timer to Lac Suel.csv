I was wondering what time of year to go I heard late july and early August are the best times to go. I also would like to know if there are any sure fire spots to go in that area. I would also Like to know the right lures to bring, I heard gold is the best color. Any info on the best tactics for muskies are that time of year.Thanks Steve"

Although the fishing is the main reason you are going be sure to take time to sit on a rock and enjoy the beauty.This is a trip you won't soon forget!As for your question.... if you are mainly fishing for Muskie try posting your lure and location question on the Muskie Central board.Just go back to Walleye Central's main page.Best of luck and have a great time!! :)"
