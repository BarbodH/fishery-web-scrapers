But just down the road are a number of lakes that do, Catherine, Catasrophe and further down Cygnet Lake.I have never fished Trout so if any one else has info maybe they can respond.Le pic"
529291,Slayer,2003-04-05 09:08:00,41,"le Pic,Thanks, that's what I thought. I guess I'll have to spend some time on those other lakes you mentioned. I will however try and jig up a couple of Trout as well. I suspect jigging a flashy spoon deep down might do the trick.""The Slayer"""

This I've heard from a cabin owner, have not fished it personally despite being next door.The other lakes mentioned......Catastrophe (Long Narrow Lake) - Walleye, Northern and Smallmouth BassCatherine (Very Small Lake) - Walleye and Northern. From Catherine Lake if the creek is ""high"" you can get to Pelican Pouch which can be a great walleye lake. If the water is not high, you can get to the Pelican Pouch boat launch going down the Pickerel Lake Road which is just north of Trout Lake. Travel about 3.5 miles and on your right there is a boat launch into Pelican Pouch. (Note it is not very well marked so watch for it about 10 minutes past the Pickerel Lake sign))Cygnet Lake is an excellent walleye lake and also has northern, perch and lake trout. Cygnet is a good 40 minute ride from Trout Lake.Regarding Pickerel Lake, you might be lured by the name, but it is predominantly habited by Smallmouth Bass. Walleye population is very low as I have participated in a Fish Study/Tagging program with the Ontario MNR for the past couple of years.If your up for Lakers....the road that goes to Cygnet has a smaller lake on it called Worth Lake. Once on Worth you can get through a small creek to a larger lake trout lake called Sword Lake. I have been up there with a 17.5 foot Lund when the water is at normal levels.If your mobile.....Cygnet is your best bet for WalleyeHope this helps a little."
