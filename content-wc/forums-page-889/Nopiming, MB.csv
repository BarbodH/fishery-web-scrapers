529131,River_eye,2003-04-06 16:39:00,1486,"Mike Britton, excellent guy."
529132,Jim,2003-04-07 08:16:00,238,Eric:Good luck working at Minaki. Sorry We will miss a chance to see you at Pointe du bois but thanks for the tips.Jim
529119,Soolkyut,2003-03-29 01:06:00,60,"What is the best lake in Nopiming park, manitoba for fishing, I know tooth lake is an excelent small mouth bass fishery but any other lakes to suggest, it is my favorite park and I would like advice on where to fish"
529120,Guest,2003-03-29 06:02:00,0,"There are lots of good lakes in Nopiming, Shoe, Black and Long are a few. Have you ever tried Quesnel/Manigotogan? You can get there by truck, about 3 hours from Winnipeg and the walleye fishing there is about as good as you'll get on a drive to lake in southern Man. There's a campground and lodge as well as secluded campsites on islands and near the falls. I have been there 4 or 5 times and have done very well.Good luckLe pic"
529121,Stevie B,2003-03-31 09:00:00,157,What are you going in with boat or canoe? If you are heading in with canoe than paddle up to McGregor Lake. It is about a day of good paddling. We had really good fishing there a year or two ago. If the fishing isn't too great than Snowshoe is the next one up the river. There are some great campsites along the way to. We started paddling from Tulibee Lake. We didn't fish there at all but it looked like a great lake to check out. I hope to be there this summer.Fish ON!!
529122,Soolkyut,2003-03-31 14:36:00,60,"Yeah, I'm thinking McGregor is where were going because the fishing is said to be good, the campsites are excelent and the falls are beautiful.We're using canoes by the way but on seperate times we may take in my friends boat (to different places)."
529123,River_eye,2003-03-31 15:51:00,1486,I'm going to have to check it out up there this summer. Never usually go up there cause my folks have a cabin at Pointe du bois.I've heard that long lake is good.
529124,Jim,2003-04-02 20:36:00,238,"Eric:We are going to stay at Trail End Camp the last week in May. We have been there the last 3 years and the guys usually just fish for big Jacks. My son and I would like to get out of that rut and try our luck at some walleye/smallmouth fishing. Do you think that late May would be good on that area of the Winnipeg river?Any tips on what to use or where to go would be great - if you don't mind sharing.Regards, Jim"
529125,River_eye,2003-04-03 13:01:00,1486,"That should be a good time for Walleyes and Smallmouth. I've fished a bit on the lower part of the river, but I know a lot more spots way up at Eaglenest lake.For walleyes it's probably best that you get your hands on some bottom bouncers and spinner rigs. This will help you cover more water when searching for walleyes. Use frozen shiners on the spinner bait hook. Also, pick up some 1/4 oz and 3/8th oz jigs for when you find the walleyes. Key jig colours are white, chartreuse, and pink in that order. Casting jigs tipped with salted shiners and letting them drop and rest on the bottom, then pulling them back, then let them rest, and so on, should help you in the shallower water. Remember to tie directly to the line. I've also had guests having tremendous success trolling rapala shallow shad raps in fire tiger colour. For the most part you should be looking for them in 4-12 ft. of water. Pay attention to where the wind is blowing and fish the windy shorelines.I don't know the bass spots on that part of the river, but you'll want to find the rock walls away from the current (they will be staging to nest in still, shallow, rocky/sandy areas) a good place to look would be in Blind bay, but check out the bays on the river as well. Fish the area from right against the rock to about 10 ft out. 15 ft of water max. Fish with dark coloured crankbaits (rattling fat raps, tail dancers rattle traps, nothing too big), spinner baits, and black or unpainted jigs (1/4 oz at the absolute heaviest) tipped with plastic worms (white, brown, black, somtimes brighter colours). Good luck."
529126,Jim,2003-04-03 21:09:00,238,"Eric:Thanks for the tips, I really appreciate the info. We have fished up as far as the rapids, is Eagles nest a long ways from there and would it be worth the trip - lots of rocks?Jim"
529127,River_eye,2003-04-03 22:42:00,1486,"The rapids are about 1/3 of the way to Eagle Nest Lake. Yes it is worth the trip, but there are lots of rocks, so I wouldn't reccomend trying it by yourself. Maybe I'll be around and be able to guide you guys up there for cheaper than trail end charges. I don't really know where I'm working yet this summer so it's hard to say."
529128,Stevie B,2003-04-04 11:27:00,157,"Eric,Do let us know where you will be this summer. My brother-in-laws want to spend a weekend up at Eagle's Nest this summer. One of them knows the way but extra ""fishin' info"" would be good.Fish ON!!"
