What's the road conditions?I'm tempted by the trophy Pike but I'm looking for some input.Thanks :)"
529271,Larry L,2003-04-02 00:50:00,335,"I have never fished Reindeer. I have heard good things about it though. We used to drive by it on the way to Wolloston and then fly out of there. The Northerns do grow big and they are plentiful in that country. The last time I was there, the road was paved for about 15 miles or so north of LaRonge and then reasonably good gravel the rest of the way. Good luck."
529272,North Of 55,2003-04-02 22:36:00,0,"I fished Reindeer 3 times & there are some good size fish.Huge pike & lake trout,good walleye fishing,as well as grayling.I live in northern Manitoba & travel north from Thompson 8 hours to co-op point.This road is rough & dusty,so your rig should be covered very well.This lake is huge & a gps is a good idea.Beautiful clear lake with lots of sand eskers & beaches.Lots of islands to camp on as well.Hope this answers your questions.Good luck fishing!"
529273,Northern Manitoban,2003-04-02 23:00:00,195,"Had a friend fish this lake last summer with friends and they did very well on Lakers.And like north of 55 says it is a very rough road,i have been wanting to go myself but the road is keeping me from taking my boat there.I'm about 7 hours away.Big lake it is and a GPS a must.FISH ON."
529274,ggg,2003-04-05 19:13:00,115,I fished there 10 years ago. Flew in and stayed at Lawerence Bay Lodge. All guided and American plan and expensive. Excellent lodge and people. Super service! Went in Aug. Trout were all down about 100 feet but we caught Northern shallow up to 33 lbs. Very big water so a GPS is a must without a guide. I understand that you can drive to Southend and the road is not that bad. Still one ##### of a drive!
529275,zzlaw,2003-04-05 19:28:00,34,I have actually fished Reindeer - many of lower southern lodges are a rip-off - stay at Southend - not a bad drive in - there is a nice camp at Southend - people are great - you end up fishing same areas as Lawrence Bay and other camps at way and I mean WAY less money - important to go when pike up shallow - best action - can still get lakers when deeper but I'd go for them when they are up shalow too - Northern Manitoban what are you doing? - stay close to home - you already have the great fishing - the moral is you want the most southerly camp - hope this helps - Larry(zzlaw)
529276,Northern Manitoban,2003-04-06 11:40:00,195,"Larry, I'm always looking for another adventure? lol."
529277,Cat Eye Outfitter,2003-04-07 15:22:00,9,"Fish there every year (two to three weeks a year).... Whitesand bay to the Cochrane river (the northeast side). Loads of trout (generally not all that big --- lots of commercial fishing), really good pike up to and slightly exceeding 50"", good walleye (Whitesand area as well as Paskwachi bay and river)nothing ever too big, Grayling up in the Cochrane as well off some of the Islands in the Steeprock Island area. Whitefish are present in some bays and can be fun on the fly. GPS is a great idea -- don't forget a compass and some maps. As it has been said this is a big lake and the chance of being ""wind stayed"" when up in the northeast corner is good. The wind can blow for a couple of days at a time and waves can get up (greater than 3 feet) in a hurry. Last year we had to leave when the Whitesand bay area as it went up on fire -- heavy choking smoke!! Apart from my super healthy respect for this awesome lake....I feel there is no other drive to lake like it... It has beautiful esker beaches, precambrian rock, monstrous burns with new growth filling in, all kinds of wildlife. Of course there are so many places to explore.... former fish camps, the odd trappers/local Cree cabins, bay after bay, neck downs, reefs, humps, ---- all the stuff you read and dream about for a wide variety of species. The swampy Cree move quite a bit from CO-OP point to Brochet. Commercial fishing in this section of the lake gets into full swing after the second week in July. This last point is where a lot of really hardcore fishermen balk at going to the big lake.... no matter to me, I'll just have more of the ""land of little sticks"" to fish with less people LOL. A bit of research and a long drive but its all worth it!Dan"
