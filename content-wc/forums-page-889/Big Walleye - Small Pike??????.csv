They run 19 to 24 inches. The walleye that we prefer to eat 16 to 18 inchers are a little hard to come by at times. Not complaining as we LOVE it. But, where are the big pike as in 40 inchers or even a 30 incher?? The largest we have caught so far has been 27 inch. Have tried all the usual type places that I have caught large pike on other lakes but just can't seem to get a big one here. Since the walleye are so nice I keep going back there. I guess curosity has got me here. Thanks for any input!!"
529479,Trailerguy,2003-04-05 07:05:00,1407,"I have a theory, most NWO lakes are connected through flowing creeks. When spawning time comes the water is high, and pike are aggressive about going upstream to spawn. I've found large pike tend to be found in the farthest upstream lakes in the spring and summer. I think they generally tend to move upstream as they grow and spawn, often remaining if conditions are suitable. Also that as fingerlings they tend to go downstream to avoid caniblization and find more suitable forage. However when a large lake is present they may never leave it, simply seeking diferent zones at diferent stages of life."

529481,zzlaw,2003-04-05 09:07:00,34,"In all liklihood what has happened and what is happening is very simple - initially there were lots of big pike in your lake just like there are in virginal fly-in lakes - all the big pike were caught and killed and it takes a long time to grow a big pike - now the pike in your lake get harvested as soon as they get beyond ""hammer-handle"" size - none or few grow to large size - that this is what has happened can be seen in lakes in Manitoba where special regs aimed at letting pike grow to large size actually create lakes full of large pike - Larry"
529482,Noel,2003-04-05 12:14:00,115,You are not fishing deep enough. Big pike are always deep except for spawning.
529483,zzlaw,2003-04-05 19:30:00,34,Fishing deeper in the warmer weather can be effective but the fish still have to be present - Larry(zzlaw)
