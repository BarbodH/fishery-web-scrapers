529319,Guest,2003-04-05 21:33:00,0,"While it would of been nice to have Canada commit troops to help clean up Iraq, Canada is in Afganastan with us. And they have lost lifes.Almost always there are multiple ways to get somebody else to do something you want them to. Sometimes what may seem like an appropriate response, such as boycotting, might actually make the situation worse. I am afraid that if we do not go, those Canadians who support us, might decide the leaders of their government were correct and that people from the States are not worth risking their troops lifes over.Besides - you can't beat the fishing! :)Fritz (with a Crestliner)"
529308,Vitreum,2003-04-02 18:35:00,221,"dave, show him this piece. this should help him make his decision. http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/ar...TICLE_ID=31846"
529310,Guest,2003-04-02 19:51:00,0,Is his name Ted!
529312,Guest,2003-04-02 19:54:00,0,He is confusing nationalism with patriotism. His loss. Sorry you have such a close minded fishing buddy.
529313,Tom,2003-04-02 20:23:00,1063,"People in america don't support the war, and some do. Our goverment went for the war. Most resort owners are american anywayz. I would tell ur friend, just that the goverment doesn't support the war doesn't mean that all canadians are agaist it. Fishing in Canada are alwayz unforgetable memories, not something that politics should control if you go or not."
529314,Guest,2003-04-03 10:42:00,0,"I have to tell you that I get a kick out of those that want to boycott Canada. Its the government that makes that call, not the guys like us that want to fish, have a few colds ones, etc. We arestill going...I love it up north...and will not let a few politicalissues change that. If we looked in the paper daily, and boycottedall those things that we didn't agree with, what would be left?An example...NYS doesn't want to increase salmon stocking in Lake Ontario....does that mean I shouldn't salmon fish any more, or that I should move out of the state?I know its an example on a far lesser scale...but to you get the point?"
529315,Guest,2003-04-03 11:32:00,0,JUST MY 2 CENTS WORTH: I dont think anyone likes to go to war but by God we better support our TROOPS.As far as going on a fishing trip to Canada ##### Yes I'm Going.I dont think boycotting Canada is going to prove anything besides I have a few friends from there.
529316,Guest,2003-04-03 11:53:00,0,Attaboy!Good for you.
529309,Soolkyut,2003-04-03 16:54:00,60,"Thats disgusting. Protesters are a stupid bunch who like to start trouble, I hope people don't pay attention to this cause those anti-war protesters are retarded."
529317,Guest,2003-04-03 18:42:00,0,I'll bet you almost anything the resort owner is an AMERICAN so your bud would probly only be taking money from a fellow AMERICAN .............kinda funny how that works aint it
529318,IaCraig,2003-04-04 18:15:00,434,"Why bother, is it his boat?Don't waste your time. Go without him, catch lots of fish and take lots of pictures, show them to him and don't offer to take him next year unless he asks. Find a new friend who is fun!IaCraig"
529298,IaDave,2003-04-02 11:11:00,476,We were heading to Bull Shoals last week when my fishing partner told me he is boycotting Canada this year. What arguement or news articles can I use to convince him to still go. I already told him it would be his loss. He is very stubborn so I need your help.
529299,River_eye,2003-04-02 11:51:00,1486,"Tell him that his beef is with the Canadian government, and although his decision not to go will be hurting government revenues in a miniscule way, the people that will be hurt much more are the honest individuals in NW Ontario and Manitoba that have a great respect for American clients and depend on them for their living. The chances are, these people support the US troops as much as he does.If he's he11 bent on making his voice heard, he should contact the camp owner and request that he write a letter to his MP on behalf of his American customers denouncing the governments decision not to join the war. If the camp owner isn't willing to do this, you probably won't have to search far to find one that would be willing."
529300,dutchboy,2003-04-02 12:54:00,5717,You have to admire a man with principals.My arguement would be why punish the resort owner.They should be held no more acountable for their governments actions than farmers being held responsable for the price of milk in the grocery stores.One has very little to do with the other!Still if he won't go maybe i would. ;) LOL have a great trip.dutchboy
529301,Guest,2003-04-02 13:31:00,0,"He can do what he wants. However, if he is taking a stance based on the misunderstanding that Canadians as a whole, think like Jean Chretian, he is mistaken.That is not the case at all. On average, over the past 35 years, I have found Canadians friendlier and more fun than many Americans we must endure everyday.If your friend is boycotting because of something that happened to him personally, so be it."
529302,Guest,2003-04-02 13:36:00,0,Tell him to remove his head from the rear portion of his body and enjoy a fishing trip with his friends. All Canadians dont support their current political decision. Thank God that Canadians have the right to openly speak their convictions....GO FISHING
529303,Guest,2003-04-02 14:32:00,0,"I say don't thank god, but thank the soldiers that risk thier lives so that we have rights and freedoms."
529304,Soolkyut,2003-04-02 14:38:00,60,Tell him to quit being a baby
529305,Noel,2003-04-02 14:43:00,115,tell him to take a hike. I will go with you.
529306,retire55,2003-04-02 15:46:00,1029,"America and Canada are democratic countries representing classless and tolerant societies.Millions of Canadians support the coalition war efforts in Iraq and believe that Canadian troops should be there. And the millions of Canadians who don't support war in Iraq, don't support Saddam Hussein and his treacherous regime either - they just didn't agree with war as the appropriate approach at this time. Regardless the views of its citizens, the Canadian Government made a decision not to openly support a coalition war effort in Iraq without UN approval. Regardless our personal views, all Canadians must live with the decision of our Government.Although your fishing colleague has every right to disagree with our Government's decision, as do we, as an American, surely he would support the democratic right to make such a decision. However, any attitude that proposes that such a decision warrants revenge/payback is immature. The underlying notion is clear, ""either do as we want you to do or we'll hurt you"". That is no way to win friends or influence people, nor indeed, to treat neighbours and allies. Even within America, there are millions who do not support the coalition war effort in Iraq. Chances are that if he did go to Canada, he'd want to crap on every Canadian he contacted. Perhaps it's best to stay away."
529307,Peanut,2003-04-02 16:01:00,929,"Well, if he's staying away because Canada is not ""supporting"" the US in the war - let him know this - there are in fact, at least 31 Canadian soldiers in/near Iraq, fighting alongside the Americans, not to mention the crews of the two Canadian ships that are ""in-theater"" doing patrol missions and doing escort work in carrier groups.The 31 is an odd number, but they are Canadians assigned to US units on exchange programs, and there could be more - our government just divulged this yesterday. So, regardless of how many countries offer their support, only Canada, the Brits, the Aussies and the US actually have lives on the line - regardless of our government's ""official"" position. Which is a more powerful motivator for him - to show his anger at our Prime Minister, or his respect for our soldiers, however few, that are in harm's way?Regardless, good luck on your trip.derrek.PS - here's a link to the story in our national daily paper:http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/...Story/National""It's the weaseling out of things that sets us apart from the animals....
