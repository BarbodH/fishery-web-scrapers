529439,River_eye,2003-04-04 12:13:00,1486,"It seems that I might be working up there this year, so yes I'd love to arrange somthing like that. You'll find I'm not near as volatile on the lake as I am in front of the computer, but hey, who is?"

529441,Esox Warrior,2003-04-04 17:08:00,64,"Yeah Bill, that's kinda what I was getting at. Hope the walleye bite is a little better than last Aug. or bring lots of chicken!"
