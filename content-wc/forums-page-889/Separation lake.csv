529263,Guest,2003-04-06 09:27:00,0,"Greetings Dave, Yep,its me, been keeping off the old key board for overa year.Got into too much trouble with internet b.s.got nailed for something I did not do,virus related. So, hopes all well with you and your family! been along time since we last chatted.Crazy world we live innow adays.Sure am glad Iam an old fart. Well last years trip was a bust,went in july and the fishing was really tough. Biggest walleye I caught was 8lbs.1oz. underneath the bridge.Found a grat spot and caught 2 back to back 5lb. smallies,wow should have mounted one.Walleyes were scattered all over,never schooled together,guess thats just the way it goes.Caught a --it house full of sauger all week,I would say over120 for the week, only a few northern though,dont get me wrong,but Idid nail tons of small walleyes1/2lb. to 1lb.walleyes on my favorite live bait, leeches .Nailed one smallie on a nightcrawler,the other on a leech,Amazing how the 2 big smallies hit,real slight tap,sauger hit everthing like a ton of bricks,used a new storm perch colored lurewow it is really great. Took my 10 year old nephew with us,caught his first walleye ever,a 6lber,underneath the bridge awsome.His first smallie was a 3lber also,he was just shaking when he landed his first walleyeHe had a great time fishing and swimming off the dock. This year change of place going back to Leech Lake in minnesota,next year(2004 ) back to canada got to go. keep in touch Rich"
