I booked a week at an outfitter's up there and thought a guide for a few days would be a treat for his 40th birthday present. Anyone got any suggestions????"

We have newver failed to fill up with 3 species; walleyes, northern and lake trour each time but 1 in 2 days.This area you need a guide--theres lakes up there he will want to try besides Sturgeon Lake.The guides name is Jim Krosschell. e mail address I have is;[email protected] He lives up there.You can contact me also if you want more information.
