529196,Guest,2003-04-01 06:34:00,0,It depends on water temp. the colder the beter I say some shad rap in blue/white&blue/silver that will dive 10--20ft. troll points and dropoffs. Good Luck

529198,Steve CO,2003-04-07 10:56:00,267,"I agree with the snap weight idea as I use them, but any weights (2-4 oz) will work. Put them on a dropper or in-line. If you use more than a 5-6 foot leader behind the weight to the lure, snap weights are essential for landing. I run either big rapalas (size 11 or 13) or 5/8 oz Doctor spoons in silver/gold bouncing bottom in about 40-50 feet of water in the NWO fly-in lakes we fish in mid-June. When we find a concentration, we mark it with a buoy and stop and drop 1 oz jigging spoons on their heads for a while. A portable sonar is indispensible for finding them. I'm going to try the J18 jointed rapala this year hoping for a real lunker."
