How about one once spoons?? I'm mainly a Walleye guy, but am looking forward to trying for some trout. (lakes, not streams)"
529474,PJM,2003-04-04 22:21:00,3516,"Matches What lake are you thinking about fishing in Canada? As far as lures you can use a lot of things. Jigs, blade baits like sonars, or you can use down riggers."
529475,retire55,2003-04-05 06:46:00,1029,"Matches:Usually, we're on our annual walleye trip during the last week of June or first week of July. We tend to fish walleyes in the early morning (0530 - 0900 hrs) and in the evening (1800 - 1000 hrs). If we fish during the rest of the day, we fish for lake trout.I would suggest that a depth sounder/fish finder is almost obligatory. During the first week of July last summer, we were marking most lakers just above the thermocline near 100 feet (but these were not the active trout). Most of the lake trout caught were caught between 30 and 40 feet deep. Our group fishes one of three ways for lakers. Some of us long line with mono and crankbaits. Others use lead core and a big gang troll with a leadered hook and dead minnow and experiment with number of colours out until lake trout are caught. We also use portable downriggers and light mono with crankbaits or with spoons. All methods have produced lake trout.Good luck on your trip."
529476,North Of 55,2003-04-05 12:39:00,0,"The lakes i fish usually produce #'s in the 30'-60' depth range through July & August trolling spoons on downriggers or dipsey divers.For the bigger lakers,i concentrate on underwater humps in the main lake basin & steep dropoffs or holes,all of which have forage.Dont forget jigging.This has produced some of my biggest lakers,either sitting on the humps or in the holes.I usually jig with 1 oz-2 oz jigs in white or chartreuse,tipped with whitefish or sucker belly.As far as trolling is concerned,i downrig at 4-8 mph,constantly changing depth & speed(helps pumping your rod).Some of my favorite lures are :#4 Len Thompson 5 of diamonds in yellow & red,Gibbs Croc 3 oz in silver or chartreuse,Nasty Boy 1oz,various Williams Trophy spoons 3/4 oz- 1 1/2 oz & the Crippled Herring.The best time of year for #'s June-turnover & Sept.-Oct.-spawn.Both seasons lakers can be caught longline trolling 3'-40' on or ajacent to reefs & flats.Good fishing & hope the info helps!"
529477,fishinnut,2003-04-05 18:11:00,642,"Try trolling with snapweights and 6-8 oz. weights. Blu/silver spoons, blu rapalas. Try jigging with Bomber slab spoons or buzz bombs."
