529254,Thumper,2003-04-04 14:47:00,133,"AVS,Good questions. I'll tweak the site to indicate that you should brush off the salt/borax crystals from the minnows before placing them in the bag. I really don't know about rinsing them off prior to freezing, but would think that may cause freezer burn. One of the reasons for using the salt is to remove moisture from the minnows prior to freezing. The borax toughens them up and preserves their appearance.If you just freeze the minnows in just water, when you thaw them out they will be very delicate, falling to pieces very easily.I've left some of the borax/salt on the bottom of the bags when packing the minnows. I don't know this as a fact, but I thought it would help suck up any air moisture in the bag, similar to those desicants(sp?) used to package electronics.As for the minnows, in the web site pictures, you see fatheads and large shiners. Both seem to do well. I don't see any reason that this wouldn't work for any minnow; shad, cubbs, suckers, smelt, whatever.Prices and availability depend on the season. It's really hard to find shiners or suckers in the off-season. Depends on the bait dealer you use, too. The place near my home is almost twice as expensive as a bait store near my relatives about 20 miles away. Shiners there, in season, run about $9 a dozen! Guess where I get MY bait? ;-)"
529255,Boots,2003-04-04 15:06:00,19,I have a friend that sells minnows and I just ask him to save any dead minnows he has and freeze them and he gives them to me cheap. He would throw them out anyway. I will try the Borax when I get them

529257,Thumper,2003-04-05 09:55:00,133,"A woman goes into Wal-Mart to buy a rod and reel. She doesn't know which one to get so she just grabs one and goes over to the register. There is a Wal-Mart ""associate"" standing there with dark shades on. She says, ""Excuse me sir...can you tell me anything about this rod and reel?"" He says, ""Ma'am I'm blind but if you will drop it on the counter I can tell you everything you need to know about it from the sound that it makes.""She didn't believe him, but dropped it on the counter anyway. He said, ""That's a 6' graphite rod with a Zebco 202 reel and 10 lb. test line. It's a good all around rod and reel and it's $20.00.""She says, ""Thats amazing that you can tell all that just by the sound of it dropping on the counter. I think it's what I'm looking for so I'll take it."" He walks behind the counter to the register, and in the meantime the woman farts. At first she is embarrassed but then realizes that there is no way he could tell it was her--being blind he wouldn't know that she was the only person around. He rings up the sale and says, ""That will be $25.50."" She says, ""But didn't you say it was $20.00?"" He says, ""Yes ma'am, the rod and reel is $20.00, the duck call is $3.00, and the catfish stink bait is $2.50."""
529256,Thumper,2003-04-05 10:03:00,133,"Lucky you! I wish I had friends who would give me minnows.Just a thought, but you may want to give your friend a jar filled with salt/borax brine water to keep the minnows in. Might keep the minnows from rotting if it would be a few days or weeks between picking up your dead minnows."
