When we've fished mono in the past we've used 6"" Invisa-Leaders to cut down on the bite-offs by the pike. This year I'll have 20/6 lb. power pro. Do I need to still add a leader or will I be good.Adam"
529496,Pooch,2003-04-06 08:24:00,4619,The Power Pro is pretty tough but you will still need a leader. Teeth nicks will cost you a fish sooner or later.Pooch

But the toothy pike can still manage to scissor it off.One thing about pike is they do not appear to be leader shy. I would recommend a leader and especially the new no kink Titanium leaders.They run more but coupled with Power Pro they just may last you a lifetime. No kinks, no fuss, the Titanium leader is the way to go with toothy critters like pike and muskie.Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson..><sUMo>"

Titantium is the best but you could always just pick up a spool of coated sevenstrand 20# and tie you own -- to suit what ever needs you may have (a good barrel swivel and crosslock snap are what I use when tying up size to suit you species). Love the feel, strength, and durability and price..........Dan"
