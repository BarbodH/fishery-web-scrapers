My recommedation would be for you to go to the Ear Falls side in mid-june. You would have access to Sanctuary Bay, Saw Mill Bay and the Cox's Island aera. There are lots of W's hanging around these areas this time of year. For resorts try Evergreen Lodge or Golden Fawn. These resorts are well maintained, full service and the owners know the lake. Good luck.TGG"

Besides the two places mentioned in the previous post, Goldpines is another great place to stay. You also have Goose Bay, Whitewing, Onaways, Timberlane, Little Canada Camp, Lac Seul Lodge, Fisherman's Cove to name a few."

I generaly fished it the second week of June and stayed at Dave's Fisherman's Cove----nice accomodations!!! The best fishing was about a seven mile run out to the sand banks.... wre really nailed them on trolling a spinner and minnow. Additionally, lost the biggest northernb of my life in a small lake accessable from Lac Suel, called mud lake.We used to freeze some larger minnows and used strip on spinners!!!Enjoy!!!"
511138,Guest,2001-02-21 11:12:00,0,"Nobody has mentioned it yet, but Scout Lake Resort is also a good place. There's easy boating from Scout lake to Lac Suel (takes about 10 minutes) and Scout Lake ihas good fishing and is well protected when the weather is ugly. We stayed there last year and had an awesome time! It's also an easy boat ride to Broad Lake, the Big Sand Banks and several other hot spots. Liz and family will treat you good. We used minnows and spinners mostly and caught lots of walleyes. Good Luck!--Nate"
