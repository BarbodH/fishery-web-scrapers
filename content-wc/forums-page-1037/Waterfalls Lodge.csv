511154,Guest,2001-02-19 17:53:00,0,Search the archives on this one pal. I am an unfortunate soul that has wasted my money there. If this is near Spanish Ontario all I can say is go somewhere else. The lakes at Waterfalls have been picked clean. The five plus pound smallies that they boast about were all catch and keep fish.
