510687,dlhomes,2001-02-05 12:09:00,62,"I've got a place on LOTW just 4 miles out of Sioux Narrows. It has 3 bedrooms, modern kitchen, shower room, screenroom and deck. It's clean and nice. Also includes fishhouse, docking, launch and great fishing! My last trip 2 of us caught approx. 40 ices a day with 95% over 20"" and 2- over 25""!! Also got some big perch and few northern. It's a 2-2.5 hr. drive north of International Falls. There's plenty of room and some cots for extras. I don't get to go up much (9mo.old twins)anymore and renting it a few times helps pay the hydro and misc. I'm from Wisconsin. My rates are $475 per group of 6 for 7 days. Contact me for more info. Only drawbacks are...toilet is -out back- but nice and we are not right on the water but approx. 100yd walk."

510692,Frank from TBay,2001-02-17 10:41:00,312,Holinshead Lake Resort north of Thunder Bay is one of the best drive in resorts in NW Ontario for quantities and quality of fish. They are the only resort on the lake. I have sent numerous people there and they all had a great time. Check out their website under Holinshead lake. I fish the waters near there. Awesome.
510693,Guest,2001-02-20 19:24:00,0,Suggest you look at SmoothRock.com - north of ThunderBay at Armstrong - will exceed your budget a bit - but was a very nice place and excellent fishing - reservation at this date might be hard to come by tho.
510694,Guest,2001-02-20 20:11:00,0,Might suggest you try www.smoothrock.com - had an excellent experience there in June 2000 - might exceed your budge a bit -located north of ThunderBay at Armstrong.
510676,Guest,2001-01-24 12:55:00,0,"Help! Help!Our Annual NW Onatario Fishing trip has been cancelled this summer and I'm looking for a new NW destination. Used to fish Onaman Lake by Geraldton. Great time but the qulaity and Numbers of fish have been rapidly decreasing each year and this last we finally had enough. eight guys spent $300 for four days of fishing and camping. We did our own food and paid for no guide. Anyone have any ideas within 8-11 hours of the twin cities in roughly the $3-$400/per guy range? A canadian experience to us is camping shore lunch awesome secenes, wildlife, semi-remote, and boating 20-50 walleyes per day with a chance at a mid teens to low 20s pike.I could use any info you have. I'm more than willing to call numbers and do the foot work but I'd just as soon narrow the search by taking ideas reccomendations from fellow fisherman.Thanks in advance,dave from Mn"

510678,BD,2001-01-24 14:52:00,739,"Try Lake of the Woods Houseboats <www.lowhouseboats.com>There aren't many places on the lake that you can't find great fishing, and you can get out far enough to leave the crowd behind."
510681,BD,2001-01-24 14:56:00,739,P.S. For eight guys a 52' houseboat works the best.
510682,Guest,2001-01-24 15:41:00,0,"Try www.lacseulwalleye.com , 10 hours from Cities, fishing is fantastic all summer. Have outpost for roughing it or modern cabins for those who like more comfort."

510684,Guest,2001-01-28 19:02:00,0,"North of Geraldton but south of Nakina is a good drive in camp called O'Sullivans Rainbow. (If you want thier website email me and I will look it up) Last twenty or so miles is a good gravel road so it is fairly remote. Nice camp, nice people, good cabins, boats etc.. I used to fish it a lot but switched only for a change. Would like to return again someday. Price was very fair. Great lake for a structure fisherman. Many islands and reefs to fish. It seems that the lake may be around twenty miles long with this camp (only one on the lake) in a bay about in the middle. Pooch in Central Illinois"

510680,BD,2001-01-31 19:42:00,739,"Our group has rented houseboats from Dan and Noreen at least once each year (sometimes twice) for thirteen years. It's a blast!
