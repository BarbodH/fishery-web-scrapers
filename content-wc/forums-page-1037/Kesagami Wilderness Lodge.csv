Single point barbless, keep virtually no fish, have a guide (extra charge of course) release all fish, and you MUST attend an introductory seminar when you get there to educate you on what's not allowed. This comes at the expense of you fishing time. I say, great fishery yes but is it worth the money no. In their website I feel as though I'm being spoken to like a 5 year old, no thanks. You can goto lots of places in Manitoba for significantly less money, HK plans."
