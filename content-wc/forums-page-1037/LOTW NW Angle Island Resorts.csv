This year I would like to cut down on boat travel and try one of the island resorts on Flag or Oak. I am leaning towards Flag Island Resort, but open to other suggestions. Looking for housekeeping cabins and plan to use my own boat."
511080,Guest,2001-02-13 12:49:00,0,I've been staying with Frank Walsh at the Bay Store on Oak Islandseveral times per year the last several years and can tell youthat they're extremely hospitable and Frank and Dick Pearson whonow guides exclusively out of there are two of the most knowlegable and fun Muskie Men you're going to find.Definitelyshould be checked out.

511082,Guest,2001-02-14 13:24:00,0,I would be interested in knowing some of those reasons. You can either post them or e-mail me. Thank you in advance.
