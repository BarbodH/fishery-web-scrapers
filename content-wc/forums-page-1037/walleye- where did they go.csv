It was a difficult lake to reach needed a 4x4 with a winch and had to cross over a couple of small streams with the winch pulling etc. about 70 miles of dirt road with about 15 miles of very very difficult traveling. The fishing was great more pike than you could count and the walleye were very numerous the biggest was 32 inches long-many pike 36-42 inches. We ate a few while there and released all of the big fish that were caught and didn't bring any home.Anew road was opened up on the Longlac side for logging and that next spring we couldn't get enough eyes to even eat while there.We were on that lake 3 times that year and the same story every time. Quit going there. It looked like that the eyes were netted out that winter--could something like that happen.It was a series of 3 lakes largest wouldn't be 2 miles long but great fishing up until the road was put in.Just can't believe that we lost our touch for catching them all at the same time.lenray
