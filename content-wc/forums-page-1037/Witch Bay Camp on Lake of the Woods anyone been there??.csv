If you are making reservations at that time, let me know, and I'll buy you a beer and tell you some fish stories!!Also, if you want to find out things about the camp, you can run a search of this site for some of the questions I was asking about a month ago. I got some really great responses from people.Hope to see you up there.Bill"

I was at the Rosemont Show in '97 & Al Lindner advised that the MNR had got the Natives to take down their nets and Walleye fishing was booming in the NE section of LOTW and he recommended August as the time to go. You'll also catch Smallmouth Bass, Pike, Perch, and possibly Muskie. The camp is the best I've been to as far as hospitality, and I've been going to Ontario every year but one for about the last 18 years. Gail & Steve run a fine camp and keep improving it every year. Al Peterson, who posts under acp, has been going here every year since 1969. You might watch to see if he posts under your message, or go the the Witch Bay site and click on one of his posts if you'd like to e-mail him. If you have any specific questions, feel free to e-mail me."

511095,Guest,2001-02-14 17:03:00,0,Bill I appreciate the info. I had a chance to talk with Gail about a week ago and it seemed well organized from the brochure I recieved. thanks for your input.
511096,Guest,2001-02-17 05:13:00,0,"First trip was July 2000 and we are going back same time fram again this year. The best fishing I have had in 10 years of Canadian fishing. Lot of 50 fish mornings per boat. Nothing huge but quite a few 4-6 lbs fish. Not too many Northerns and the Muskies were off that week. Got a few smallies and intend to go after the smallies more this year.Great camp, good was great and service was best ever. Only drawback at this time was showers and bathrooms are located behind the cabins with in 50 ft.Good fishing!"
