The pike weren't even up in the shallows yet, so I didn't get one all week. My understanding is that it's a great pike and walleye lake. We were up the last week of May...and coming off a cold winter, we were a little early to get into any great fishing. We caught fish though, and had a great time to boot. We stayed at Camp Lochalsh in their outpost cabin. Not the most posh cabin you'll ever stay in, but the isolation was nice as we didn't have anyone within a couple of miles of us. Very scenic beauty all around. They take their wildlife habitate serious up there and protect the fish with slot limits and sanctuary areas (for spawning). You'll see plenty of bear and moose, and a good number of walleyes I'm sure. Hope this helps."

Fishing is good, with large numbers of Walleye averaging 1.5-2 lbs. You will have a chance at eyes weighing over 10-12. If you're into pike, 20+ pounders can be found. I'm not sure if the same can be said for Wabatongushi, but I imagine it would be close. We have a slot of 14.2-16.9 inches, but that will vary from lake to lake. Check with the MNR to be sure. Good luck, and I hope you enjoy our neck of the woods!!"
