510387,Guest,2001-01-01 08:13:00,0,"Stayed once at Wiley Point Lodge,where we left from Totem lodge.Iam used to less conviences up north,so I thought this was an ultra nice camp Our treatment was second to none. Fishing in the last of August was Guided and excellent."
510388,Guest,2001-01-01 18:28:00,0,"Have fished out of Totem Lodge several times and can say nothing but good about the accomodations and the fishing.Although they are a bit expensive for their all-inclusive American plan package,that is the way to go.A 1st class resortif you are looking for a Canadian fishing experience to remember.E-mail me if you want more details about guides to ask for,which cabins are best,etc.Eric Brown and his staff go out of their way to make sure you have a great stay.In my opinion,Lake of the Woods is heaven for the walleye fisherman. The fishing and the scenery is second to none! Bud"
510389,Worm Dunker,2001-01-01 20:33:00,23,"I have stayed at both. Both are 1st class palces. Both are very expensive. I have been there in August and it is a long run to the fishing areas not quite to Willey Point but close. I would use a guide. They promote the catch and release of ""all"" bigger walleye. Jordy was a great guide for us.Good Luck The Worm Dunker"

They are quite nice and quite expensive but no doubt worth it if this is the type of vacation your looking for. My cabin is on Lobstick Bay and there is plenty of good fishing within 2 miles of our pier, however I usaully go out to Whitefish Bay or up to Yellow Girl, which are both approx. 14 mile runs. I was up middle of August last year and we caught all the eyes we wanted. Our only problem was getting some under 18"" to eat!! Most were from 20-23"" and we got 2-25"". If you have a clue you don't need a guide to catch fish on this lake. My cabin has all the luxuries of home including shower, modern kitchen, screenroom, fishhouse and boat slip. Sleeps 6 comfy and affordable @ $475 per 7 days!!! Contact me if interested. We are approx. 4 miles out of Sioux Narrows."
510391,Guest,2001-02-18 17:39:00,0,I assume you know that offering commercial accommodations at a private camp is illegal in Ontario?
510393,ggg,2001-02-18 18:42:00,115,Stayed at Totem in Aug. once. Eric run a 1st. class operation.Great fishing ! The only down side was that they were havingproblems getting the guides there on time. Had to wait somemornings till 9:00 to get started. Great food and lodging.
510392,Guest,2001-02-18 18:52:00,0,American fellow was renting his camp at our lake to other parties of American fisherman and was charged. Fine was pretty hefty. Lots of people do not know it is against the law. Good point curious.
510394,Guest,2001-02-19 15:38:00,0,">What time were the guides to be there in the morning. We usually like to go out by 8am, at the latest. Also, we like to go out after dinner. Was there any trouble getting boats at night. thanx"
510395,ggg,2001-02-20 19:06:00,115,"Blake, The guides were supposed to be ready to leave by 8:00.We had 20 boats & 20 guides for a very large group. Some ofthe guides were there on time, but some were not. Maybe thisis normal when you need that many guides ? All guides normallyhave you back at 5:oo at Totem. I'm sure that for extra $you can customize your trip. They do aim to please, they runa 1St. class place."
