511035,Gray Wolf,2001-02-11 07:14:00,32,I would like to take my wife to a fly-in outpost in late August. Does anyone know of a fly-in service that will take a party of two? All of the websites I've checked require a minimum party of four.
511036,Snagmaster,2001-02-11 09:41:00,10,I've done several 2 man trips with vikingoutposts.com out of Red Lake. This year 2 of us are going out of Armstrong With ogokifrontier.com in Sept. There are many more that will take just you and your wife.
511037,Indio,2001-02-11 20:11:00,12,"I know Ceasars Lodge has accomadated two in the past ( even tho they say 4 min), check it out."
511038,Karl,2001-02-11 20:38:00,63,"Get information from Pickerel Arm Camps - www.pickerelarm.comThey may also have availabilities for two, especially during that time of the year. Actually, just about ALL outfitters have vacancies in late summer."
511039,4bigfish,2001-02-12 04:23:00,25,"I know of many fly in outposts that can accomidate 2 people. What do you think of Saskatchewan, Canada? Great fishing and accomidations. Good prices. Let me know if I can be of any further assistance.Mark Thomas[email protected]"
