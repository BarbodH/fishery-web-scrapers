511059,Guest,2001-02-11 18:48:00,0,How do portable fish finders work? Also I'm hoping to get get one to put on rental boats. How do I put them on boats that are in the water?
511060,Go_Fish,2001-02-12 12:21:00,28,They work like all the others except the transducer (and the unit) are not perminantly fixed on the boat. Most come with a suction cup attachment that you just put on the back of the boat. Good Luck!Go_Fish
511061,ggg,2001-02-12 18:00:00,115,i have used the suction cup mounts and they come off in roughwater.i have lost transducers using them. either make a ADJUTABLE portable mounting bracket as i did or i think youcan purchase one from cabela's. good luck !

511063,Guest,2001-02-13 10:51:00,0,"I've had a portable fish finder on a rental boat for three years with no problems. The suction cup usually has a cord running thru it so you can secure it to the boat. I usually go one step better and carry some zip-tie with me and zip tie the safety cord onto the back handles of the boat. Haven't lost a transducer yet. Just be sure the safety cord is tight enough so that is the suction cup does come off it can't get near the prop. Be sure to check it a lot the first couple days out. It seems like it will come off four or five times at first, then will stay put. That's been my experience. Good luck."

I've bought a portable mount consisting of clamp and long rod and with some half straps connected the tranducer to rod. I power this with a dry cell rechargeable battery and find it much more reliable and powerful than the portable eagle I used to own, I'm going on 3 years with the battery and use the unit on ice as well as open water. Hope this helps you. The Fishin Musician Kevin"
