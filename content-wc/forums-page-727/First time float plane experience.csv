They are having a hard time pulling the trigger on this one, for some reason, possibly the $$$$. I'd like to hear comments on others that took their first float plane ride this year over Canada's wilderness. Tell them what a blast it is to land and take off on water, not to mention the beauty and the remote fishing experience!!!"

The experience it would seem for most was in itself worth it. As you said the floats are fun and skis really seemed to impress people. My guess is that people know they really are in the wilderness and at one with nature when they fly-in. Haveing said that, one should allways prepare for being in the bush, even on a day trip as weather is the nemisis. Even though I did it for a living I still flew out to hunt and fish for, I believe the same reason. Your friends should try the deal, it really isn't expensive when one factors in the costs of a fishing trip no matter the mode of transportation. I hope they go. Cheers Clark"
