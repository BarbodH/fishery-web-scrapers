It did not show any depth contour but had amazing shore and island detail. He said the chip was expensive but was well worth it since there is no electronic lake map data available. My question is, has anyone used the Mapcreate software for Canada in the Lac Seul area? Just wondering if the shoreline data and island data is as accurate as it looks."
