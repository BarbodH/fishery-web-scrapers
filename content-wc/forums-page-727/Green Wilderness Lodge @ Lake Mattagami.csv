One of our group found Green Wilderness Lodge @ Lake Mattagami on the web as a possible location for next year's trip. I've done a search on both the lodge and lake here, and no info on either (so to speak). Does anyone have any comments on this lodge or lake ? We're looking for a drive-in or boat-in location, with decent walleye and pike/smallmouth or Lake Trout as options...our group's ages range from early 30s to mid 70s, so looking for clean cabins, indoor plumbing and electric at the dock(s) for our boats with a decent lake to fish. We don't need trophy fishing, though that would be a bonus. If you have any knowledge on this lodge or lake good or bad, please post a note. IF you have a recommendation on a nice camp or lodge, please post that as well. We're located in Ohio and looking to keep the drive up and back home limited to one day each way. We normally drive up through the Soo, and if you have recommendation(s) for that area of Ontario, please post a note or the website. Faith, Family, Friends & Fishing, Rich B"

552818,Gary_IA,2005-10-27 13:02:00,144,The only area that I have had any experience is at Sonny-Bob Lodge on Oba Lake located on the Algoma Central Railway about 17 or so years ago. At that time it was strictly rail in or fly in. It was a nice experience where we brought a 6 hp outboard on the railroad (from Hawk Junction)and used it on resort's boats. If you don't get many responses on this board try the link pasted below. Most of discussion pertains to eastern Ontario.http://ontfish.proboards39.com/index.cgi?board=general

552879,Guest,2005-10-28 23:28:00,0,"The following link also has lodge listings. You might find a few more options that would be a shorter drive than those on All-Canada. A good number of the lodges in All-Canada are from the Sunset Region, NOSTA's (North of Superior Tourist Association) will be closer considering your trip from Ohio.http://www.nosta.on.ca/ All the best, Greg @ Agate Bay Lodge"
