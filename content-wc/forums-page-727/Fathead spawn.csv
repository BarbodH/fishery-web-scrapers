552901,Guest,2005-10-31 08:52:00,0,"Cecil, Dont know the answer to your question. Why do you want to know? Do you think that it will have a large affect on the Lac Seul fishing? We have fished Lac Seul for ten years in June, July and August and the fishing is always great as long as we follow the fish out on their transistion to deeper water once they leave the spawning areas."

It is dynamite if timed right. On the flyin, the first two weeks of July are the target times."
