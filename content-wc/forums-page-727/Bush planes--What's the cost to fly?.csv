552672,Eyesore,2005-10-16 11:44:00,455,"Next year while visiting in Ontario, I want to do a 1 hour flight on a bush plane. Small plane with floats is all that would be needed, as I will be alone and will NOT have any gear. Just a simple sight seeing trip. Does anyone know what the cost might be for 1 hour? Thanks"
552673,Pooch,2005-10-16 17:21:00,4619,Where are you wanting to fly out of? There does not seem to be any shortage of float planes in Canada. I'd plan on two to three hundred dollars for an hour. Pooch
552677,jerry bark,2005-10-17 06:02:00,822,"i wonder if $100 tip might get a guy invited to ride along on a fly-ins' check flight?? i would call around to fly in outfitters in the area you are going and ask. either way it should be a fun ride, enjoy! jerry"
552681,Guest,2005-10-17 10:57:00,0,I rented one for an hour out of HawkJunction Ont. (near Wawa) in July 2005 it was Cessna float plane to seat three guests plus pilot. It was $300 for the hour total. With fuel costs up count on $350 maybe.
552682,Eyesore,2005-10-17 11:04:00,455,"Thanks for the info, fellas. Now, are you guys talking in U.S or Canadien dollars?"
552684,Guest,2005-10-17 13:12:00,0,If you will be in the Vermilion Bay part of Ontario you could contact Wilderness Air...1-800-760-0924 and get a cost from them. The prices the other fellows are throwing around are getting close to doing a one day fly out ..... a cessna for 3 would run you under $600 Canadian for a trip to one of their closer (36 miles one way) lakes. Find two others to share the cost and the sight-seeing plus a day of fishing will set you back about $200 bucks (cdn)
552692,Guest,2005-10-18 07:01:00,0,Try Chimo Air in Red Lake (www.chimolodge.com). I recall seeing a sign in the office offering sightseeing flights.
552718,Guest,2005-10-19 06:36:00,0,"If you are on a fly in and want to send the plane for another trip, let's say for beer or something, they say they will do it for the price of fuel. Would I expect the same price then, $200-300? I understand that it will vary depending on the distance just trying to get an idea of a price range."
552728,Eyesore,2005-10-20 00:04:00,455,"Good point, Phil McCrakin Anyway, I am surprised to hear guys saying $200-$300. Man that seem low. I called a air taxi in Alaska last summer and he quoted something like $650 per hour. Are there any bush pilots on the board here that can set the record straight? Generaly speaking of course. Thanks"
