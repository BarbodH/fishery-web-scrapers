552683,rockpt,2005-10-17 11:44:00,589,"We saw a native pulling up a net at Naongashing on Sun., Oct 9 (that was the day after I ran across PJM at Bottleneck). However, during eight days of fishing we caught lots of walleye and most everybody else we talked to did also. The crappie was slower in Miles Bay and Obabikon than in past years but I heard it was hot at Hay Island. My opinion is that at current levels the Miles Bay/Little Traverse area can sustain both netting and sport fishing. But, it's a delicate balance that will have to be watched closely. I understand other areas of LOTW have more netting that is starting to adversely affect the fishery. By the way, I was wrong about netting for crappies. I've been told netting is allowed in Miles Bay in the area roughly east of Garden Island but not west of there."
552727,PJM,2005-10-19 22:40:00,3516,rockpt It was nice to meet you and I am happy to see that your boat performing better. When I saw you in Miles Bay We stayed there and pick up around 40 crappies but only keeped 25. They were right on the bottom in around 30 feet and were hard to mark. The action was on again off again but we fished until dark. Hay island was better. Hoped you had a nice trip and that was a nice looking boat you bought also. Keep in touch...........

You got that right Bill!! And it's going to happen sooner than later. Unless something magical happens this year, this will be may last. I'm sick and tired of seeing these huge nets out where we all are fishing. I just hate to see a lake like this destroyed over a few bucks. I couldn't have said it better, my thoughts exactly!!"
552892,rockpt,2005-10-30 09:34:00,589,"Going through some old articles today came across a Nov. 2004 article from the Fort Frances Times about the LOTW fishery. Some interesting points, according to the MNR: *Walleye account for nearly 50% of creel samples and ""overall, are doing pretty well."" *Black Crappie was introduced in the early 1990s and has taken firm root in LOTW. Sabaskong Bay has the largest black crappie harvest in Ontario. *Crappie numbers are subject to natural fluctuations that seem to peak every six years. The next peak was supposed to be in 2005, so we should have had a bumper harvest this year. We'll see what this year's MNR report says."
552893,Bill Krejca,2005-10-30 14:47:00,6107,"Being aware of the expected ""bumber crop"" this year, I was disappointed in the crappie fishing this September. I don't know whether this was a result of the warm water(65 degrees, middle of Sep), or to the netting/no rules catching. I suspect a little of each. As crappie were introduced to the lake and are not native, I have a difficult time understanding how they can be indescriminately harvested. There has to be an answer to the apparent unemployment in the area, which makes netting/no-limits catching worth while. I remember what it was like on the lake in the late 1960's, and no one was really profiting from the then depleted fish resources. It took 20+ years and the buying out of the commercial fishermen, for the lake to return to a great fishery, and now the damaging cycle is beginning all over. Do we not learn anything from history? Those in a position of political power who advocated the present no-rules fishing are short-sighted in their response to a need for employment in the area. Is this the best that they can do? I love the lake and just do not like seeing it being destroyed once again."

I was told that their trucks are up there weekly taking in the fish and hauling them to MN. We were up in LOTW from the 15th to the 24th and fished Obabikon on 4 days. Fishing was difficult with many marked, but really worked to get the big ones. Guess the water is still to warm this year for the bite to take off....eh. Stopped by Obabikon Bay Camp to buy some ice. The place seemed to only have 4-5 people staying there. Can't imagine how a guy as friendly as Steve can stay in business with only a few willing souls in house. Hopefully when it sells someone will take over and put it back on its feet again."
552446,Jesse-WI,2005-10-01 22:01:00,534,I was up in late August in the Morson area and it was common to see Indians and nets. I think my walleye fishing days on LOTW is over for the time being.
552448,PJM,2005-10-01 23:23:00,3516,Jesse-WI I have hit in the past two years net up the but the were in an area where you would not fish. When I say I hit the nets I mean it. All of the sudden the boat starts to slow down and the net is hooked on to your lower unit. The question I have is they are catching crappies with a rod and reel but how would you get them with a net.
552472,Guest,2005-10-03 15:11:00,0,"we were staying at a camp in miles bay last year in mid october. while motoring back to camp we spotted about a dozen eagles in the trees and on the beach. we went over to take a look and found a temporary fish sorting camp that had been recently used. there were dead fish everywhere on the beach. perch, crappies, northern pike and a small muskie. also some trash looking fish i couldn't recognize. anyway, it was obvious that the indians had been using that spot to sort whatever it was they were netting. this was west of the thompson creek area in one of the bays before the cut to get to miles bay camp. the only thing i could figure is that they were taking the bigger crappies and discarding all the rest. what a mess. no wonder the crappie fishing isn'nt what it was 10-15 years ago. but then, what is? br"

552512,Guest,2005-10-06 20:29:00,0,Didn't see the nets at Little Mink in the channel until we drove two boats through and chopped them up - About ten boats were fishing at Neongoshing getting snagged in unmarked nets and cutting them up - they were set across the main channal also. But we still caught hundreds of walleyes and ate some and let the rest go.
552534,PJM,2005-10-09 22:07:00,3516,Anon I was up there from the 6th thur 9th and there was not a net there but on saturday the 8th there were about 15 eagles on the point eating something in the weeds. So when did you see the nets?
552571,Guest,2005-10-11 00:46:00,0,I hate to say it but maybe its time to forget about canada as a place to enjoy catching fish in canada. just pretend you are while the natives up there empty the lake of fish. then they can try to figure out gee whats happened to the fish. I always thought they were smart but maybe I was wrong.

552193,Guest,2005-09-20 20:36:00,0,"For the purposes of selling fish commercially, Obabikon Lake is off limits for netting or catching fish in any way for the purposes of selling. Fishing for ""sustinence"" purposes is unregulated and difficult to interpret. Miles Bay is NOT off limits to netting. If you ever see a gill net being pulled in Obabikin Lake, tell your resort operator right away so they can call the MNR to report it. Also, anytime you see nets that are not marked to identify their locations, let your resort operator know. They can be dangerous for navigating when not marked. More and more conseration officers are getting disgusted with the way many commercial fishers are conducting their business and are more willing to investigate when things aren't being done properly. They need to be able to put pressure on offenders and their bosses before any progress can be made. And remember, they can only sell fish to people willing to buy it. Just say no to buying fish commercially. Come up to Lake of the Woods and catch your own."

I stay at a lodge in Miles Bay and I thought I understood the owner tell me that netting was not permitted in Miles Bay, but maybe I'm wrong. I'll be up in a couple weeks and get some more info. Netting for fall crappie could have a read adverse effect b/c unlike walleye, the crappie school up in only a few areas of that part of LOTW."
552215,Guest,2005-09-21 20:41:00,0,"Rockpt, I have stayed at the Obabikon bay lodge the past 14 years. I have been up both in July and October. Both times of the year, I have witnessed natives pulling nets from Miles Bay. As I come into Miles bay from the obabikon region, I cross the entire bay heading to thompson creek and about 2/3rds of the way across that expansive bay there is an island on the right. The nets seem to be just north of that island. I am sorry to say, I have not made it up there this year."
552219,rockpt,2005-09-22 20:03:00,589,"FOOTDOC, Thanks for the info. I'll see what I can learn when I'm up there and post anything worthwhile. I've read your posts the last few years and know you're one of the regulars in that area. Sorry you didn't make it up this year. I guess you know Obabikon has been for sale. If it goes private you'll need to switch to one of the other fine camps in that area, eh? Take care."
552220,Guest,2005-09-22 21:02:00,0,Fish wholesale in Brainerd? Must be Moreys on 371 boy I hate to hear that. Maybe if people would not buy the fish it would put a end to some of the netting.Someone go buy and ask Moreys if they are buying the netted fish. Good luck Elmo
552231,Bill Krejca,2005-09-25 13:05:00,6107,"Resort Guy, I was in Obabikon Lake last week. An Indian fellow and his female companion were fishing it. He had 4 rods out. Interestingly, he was using what looked like some kind of green dough ball, fishing it dead directly on the bottom, with no sinker. I'll admit, he had a knack for it, as he was catching real nice crappies right and left. He was throwing them into some kind of large tub in the middle of the boat. This is a real shame, as I'll wager he could be selling the bait for much more than what he will be selling the fish for. I don't like to see this happening, Would really be upset if I was a resort owner."
552255,Guest,2005-09-26 15:11:00,0,"I certainly can believe what you saw. I've spoken to the MNR about this more than once the last couple years and some of the people there are finally starting to get the attitude that enough is enough already. The most upsetting thing is that their hands are tied for the most part. The politicians have to show some intestinal fortitude and deal with this issue once and for all before things get too far out of hand. The economic benefit to the government, as well as the communities in the area is dependent on only a couple of resources and they need to be managed properly. There are many ways to share the resource without one group taking advantage of it for short term financial gain. The best most of us can do is report nets that appear untended and anything that are not marked as well as refuse to purchase fish commercially (as well as order walleye, crappie, etc in a restaurant.) Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day, teach a man to fish.... Also make sure you teach the young anglers the value of catch and release. It does work and is just as important to the health of a fishery than anything else. P.S. Crappies are biting, just not real strong yet. Weather has been too warm and water temps still over 60. Lots of fish being marked, you just have work harder for them so far."
