Fishing was tough on Red we did manage a 28"" and a very few small eyes and sauger but that is 4 guys and 2 very long days of fishing. Pretty frustrating, but we did see one guy get 5 nice fish next to us. They might have all been masters. Other than that all others boats seemed to be doing pretty poor. Winnipeg was better for us, lots of 16-20"" greenbacks jigging. One 29"" and one 27"". Pretty good time there, but again fishing was not really on. Good luck to all."
552744,mrwalleye5,2005-10-21 20:01:00,1922,Read this post and had to run to the calender and have a look. Thought I had missed a week. Getting old quick enough without missing a week. Must have been great to be on holidays and not have to look at the date. You are right. Fishing Winnipeg River at Pine Falls is yielding more fish but smaller then the Red. Rather fish Pine Falls. W5

Overall we caught about 20-25 fish per day and many were in the 15-20"" range. Not the best but I will take the nice weather anytime. I just don't see the nice fish that I once did...as always, had a great trip overall. Hawgeye"
