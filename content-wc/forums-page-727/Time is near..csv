550573,DaveIN,2005-07-21 11:10:00,191,I am leaving Saturday morning for a week of fishing the English River at Separation Lake with my younger son (age 35). He and I have never gone on a trip as we have not always gotten along well enough to do this. He has matured and I have mellowed enough that we feel this will work. Please pray for us on this. An added bonus is my wife is insisting that I take her back up there in Sept for our wedding aniversary for another week. This will be the first time that I get two trips in one year.

552933,Guest,2005-11-02 21:06:00,0,How was your trip? Did you and your son get along and catch lots of fish? I fished Lount last year and we caught a ton of fish.
552937,Guest,2005-11-03 07:04:00,0,"Great to hear you are giving this a try. My youngest son and I used to lock horns. The solution I found that worked for me was to realize that he and I were often in an arguement that was a power struggle. When I relaxed and thought to my self ""what difference does it make who is right."" I could relax and the situation changed. Some of the best advice I ever received was ""we can not change other people, but each of us is able to change our reaction to them."" When I realized my son's relationship with me was worth more than winning any arguement, our relationship changed for the good. Glad to hear you are doing this trip. It is a fantastic way to have a common experience to build a new relationship"

My dad died before we could fish together as adults, and I feel bad about missing that opportunity. One thing I've noticed over the years is the truth of the old adage that parents never stop parenting (giving advice, guiding their kids, etc). It's almost like we know we should shut up about some things, but out of love, concern, etc, we just can't. As a result, kids always feel like kids, even into their 40's and beyond, and it's easy to fall back into old habits like arguing. To ""break that cycle"", so to speak, I sometimes go out of my way to seek my sons' advice on things. I'm amazed at how positively they react, and how much more it makes me feel less like father/son and more like fishing buddy. Then when situations do arise where I feel the need to stick my nose in, it's not resented quite as much (I think). Just my 2 cents . . ."
