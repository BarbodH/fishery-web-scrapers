552911,Guest,2005-10-31 19:07:00,0,went to boois on trout lake(15 minute flight north east of red lake) 9 years in a row. bought a cabin with 6 buddies on minitakki near sioux lookout 4 years ago so haven't been to trout since. minitakki is good but trout lake was unbelievable and i really miss it. 75 walleyes by noon was common and after lunch it was northerns and lake trout to play with. would love to hear some good fish stories from that neck of the woods.
552913,Guest,2005-11-01 06:13:00,0,I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO TROUT LAKE...I HAVE BEEN TO TWO OTHER LAKES UP IN THAT AREA....NUNGESSER AND LITTLE VERMILLION. I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED MYSELF AT BOTH OF THOSE LAKES... NUMEROUS WALLEYE AND SOME HEFTY PIKE. MY YOUNGEST BOY GOT A 44 1/2 INCHER LAST YEAR. I LIKE THE RED LAKE DISTRICT BEST... I HAVE ENTERTAINED THE IDEA OF OWNING A CABIN UP THERE ... HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT? PROS? CONS?
552914,Pooch,2005-11-01 06:16:00,4619,don in wi. Would you email me? I would like to chat with you. We fly over Trout a couple times a year heading for another lake. Pooch in central Illinois
552919,ackermannsacre,2005-11-01 14:12:00,196,"Don - took the wife to Boois last year, we had a blast. The marked up map you sent me is worth GOLD! Of course the wife outfished me again with a 9lber up in Kissic(sp) Bay. We didn't catch tons of walleye because we don't fish that hard, spent alot of time cruising the lake trying to learn the layout for our first time there, but we caught plenty everyday, along with lots of pike in Joyce Bay and Picnic Point. Several 10lb lake trout close to the lodge between the islands near Picnic Point. This was a great flyin for a group of buddies or with the wife. This is not roughing it, although they do have an outpost if you prefer. We stayed in one of the new A-frames, two bedroom, full bath, kitchen with full size frig, full size freezer, dishwasher, gas fireplace, two decks over the water with gas grill and gas fish cooker...heck this place was bigger and nicer than the house we live in in Missouri. We ate all our evening meals in the lodge, which can get expensive, but you only live once. I really like how the guides go out everyday. They come around every morning with the weather report and let you know where they plan on going depending on the weather and the fishing reports and you can follow along or just meet up with them at noon. They bring all the fixins for the shore lunch, just drop off a small walleye per person and they do all the filleting and cooking. This was a great way to learn different areas of the lake and also meet some of the other fisherman staying at the lodge. Hopefully will make it back next summer"
552923,satchmoa,2005-11-01 18:01:00,19,I have been going to Trout Lake every year for the past 10 years. We have been staying at Catisland Lodge. The lake is a great fisherie and very scenic. Feel free to contact me for more info if you want.
