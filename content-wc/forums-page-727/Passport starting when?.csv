552853,Guest,2005-10-27 09:35:00,0,Uh Kay! It is all clear to me now. ;) Thanks fellas. I think I'll just get a passport and be done worrying about it. What about coming back from Mexico? LOL!
552814,Guest,2005-10-27 09:52:00,0,"That's what I did. A passport at the border gives you smooth sailing through the border, but don't tell Ben Dover Jr., because he is still.....well....LOL...bent over."

When you get to the Gate, just point at her belly and say ""anchor Baby, Jorge Arbusto Number one!"" They'll let you pass, #### they will probably escort you to the nearest ""Free Stuff"" Center for wayward illegals. Of course at that point they will expect you to register... To Vote."

552874,REW,2005-10-28 09:06:00,40083,"It really doesn't matter when the passport is needed. For the speed of entrance and exit, go down to your local pass port center - spend the $$$ to get your pass port for you and your family and move on. It is understood that EVERYONE - who leaves the boundaries of the US will HAVE to have a passport within 10 years. So, why wait, and have to pay a premium price to expedite a passport, when you can get one in 6 weeks for less than $100. TO get an expedited passport - i.e. within one week, can cost over $300. You know it will happen. ---- As many folks who have gone through customes - to and from the US have stated. All conditions being equal - the folks with a passport clear customs in 1-3 minutes. The folks without passports clear customs in 5-10 minutes. Save time for you and your friends, - NOW - and get your passport. With the passport, the customs officials, simply scan the passport with an optical scanner. With a birth certificate -depending on the location, there may be some manual writing or scanning involved. Take care REW"
552875,REW,2005-10-28 09:14:00,40083,"As one of the other posts suggest, go to the government on line site and complete the passport application on line and print it out. Then, when you go to the passport office - by the way, they have passport offices at many post offices; and many licencs registration locations now -- simply give them the completed paperwork, your birth certificate, and have them snap your picture. Give up a few $$$ and wait a few weeks and you will have your passport, along with any documentation that you may have sent in with your paperwork. In prepration for your passport - one thing that many folks don't have at hand is the date of birth and location of birth - for each of their parents. This is needed - whether your parents are living or dead. Other than that, the questions are simple residence questions. Take care REW Go to this us offical government site - to get forms and more information on passports, or any other travel requirements: http://travel.state.gov/ +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"

Its all a quess right now and I'm betting on it not ever happening between Canada and the US. As for getting a passport so that I might take a trip to some other country other than Canada, forget it! Between the US and Canada we have it all."

552791,Guest,2005-10-25 15:53:00,0,"Just heard that you will be able to apply for a passport at the All Canada Shows this winter...the US postal service will have a booth and will be also taking passport photos. You need to have a birth certificate. From what I have heard the earliest you will need one will be 2007 but rather than wait for a last minute rush you may want to do it this winter. By the way, why is WigWam such a knob? Still waiting for a response on the ontario trash posting from Mr. Know-it-all. BD."

552809,Guest,2005-10-26 19:13:00,0,I talked to my moma's favorite cousin's next door neighbor's best friend who works doors down from a post office and she thinks the passport stuff will happen in about 18 months give or take 2 years.

552749,Guest,2005-10-22 13:30:00,0,"To come back into the states from Canada, do we US citizens need passports starting 2006? I have heard this, but does anybody know for sure?"
552750,Jimmy Jig,2005-10-22 14:13:00,1905,"No one knows for SURE if or when a passport will be needed to get back into the US, but its NOT 2006."
552752,bigfish1965,2005-10-22 19:37:00,3210,The absolute EARLIEST will be Fall of 2007. Border states are pushing the feds to drop the new rules.
552753,Guest,2005-10-22 21:22:00,0,"Exactly Bigfish!!! This has not been set in stone, so if you need a passport for only a fishing trip to Canada, don't run to the post office right away (yet). Wait and see! NWO Fishing Bum"
552761,Guest,2005-10-24 06:55:00,0,I disagree Bum...the American people should get a passport regardless of whether it will be necessary to get into Canada or not. Maybe it will be the push they need to travel outside the precious homeland for ONCE!!!! D
552763,Guest,2005-10-24 08:17:00,0,You are WRONG. IT is Dec 31 2006. Quit getting your excerise by jumping on unfounded conclusions and incorrect rumor.
552765,jigman 2003,2005-10-24 10:41:00,981,December 2006 starts the requirement for all air and sea travel to and from the Western Hemisphere. December 2007 starts the requirement for all land border crossings as well. Do a Google search for U.S. passports and go to the U.S. government site regarding passports. It will tell you exactly what I just stated.
552767,jimbo,2005-10-24 12:57:00,223,I just got back last week and the guard at the US side said it would be 2008 at thew earliest. He said it may not start then either
