552815,Mike M (Sask),2005-10-27 09:55:00,374,"Hi Dave We did make it out to Last Mountain yesterday. It was better tan being at work but..... Wow was it windy! Made for tough fishing but we stuck it out. Nothing big though! Last Mountain can be nasty in the wind. There is no place to hide. I hope to get out again this weekend. Good thing you did a good job on the net... just think if you would have knocked it off! I was fishing one time and doing quite well and my partner wasn't, so he says if I catch another one he's going to knock it off. He did!!! Of course he said it was an accident!"

552787,Guest,2005-10-25 12:07:00,0,Got me a 30 incher on the English River this fall. It was a Carp but I thought it was a Walleye until it got close to the net. He is still my personal best.

552699,Northern Manitoban,2005-10-18 09:34:00,195,29 inch 14 Pounds? wow thats huge did you actually weigh it or are you guessing at the weight because that would be one girthy fish! I've landed 4 trophys this year biggest 29.5
552700,Guest,2005-10-18 09:38:00,0,"I weighed it but it was an off the shelf scale, ""non certified"". It was one supplied by the camp. So, I assume it is more or less accurate but could well be off by a few oz."
552702,Guest,2005-10-18 10:30:00,0,"Not to be putting down your fish but there is pretty much no way that fish was 14 lbs. 11 would be pushing it if it was really fat. Anyway, biggest so far is 11.9 lbs. Too many to count over 10lbs. just cant get that real big pig."
