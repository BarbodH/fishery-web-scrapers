I still have not found the results from the Canadian National Walleye Championship - but here is Kim Wilson's website, may you could contact him. Prior year results are posted, but this year is not. Let us know if you find them, I'd like to see the results as well.http://www.mts.net/~klwilson/cwc.htm The local tourney results can be found here. Find by searching ""Papertown"".http://www.papertown.ca/Web%20Weights05.html"
