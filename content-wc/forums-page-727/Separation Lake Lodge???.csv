Lots of walleye & pike, some bass too. This was in june of '99. The water was pretty high at that time. The rocks will get your as$ if you arent carefull too. Lots of rocks everywhere. This is probably the reason they dont rent motors, as you have to rent one outta kenora or bring your own. I've always wanted to go back. The 26 miles of gravel road to get there wasnt much fun tho..."
