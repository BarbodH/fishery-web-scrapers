552799,AllenW,2005-10-26 06:29:00,11482,"Just wondering, you guys that fly out of Red Lake, have you done much fishing in Red lake? I've always thought a fly in might be fun, but never had the need to as fishing has always been pretty good at Red, having a couple of friends who live on the lake helps and the 20+ years I've fished the lake probably does to, but I see them planes taking off and I sometimes wonder if I shouldn't be on one...:) Al.....who thinks it might be hard to get his boat in the plane...:)"

I used to go to a lake named ""Murdock"" with them. Great walleye lake. Just wondering if they still run a quality operation or not. Thanks."
552639,Guest,2005-10-13 18:09:00,0,"Hey Jigman, When were you at Murdock? I was there in '73 and '74 when it was still a tent camp and you had to bring your own motors. Yes, it was a great walleye lake."
552640,Guest,2005-10-13 18:16:00,0,"i was there in the mid '90's. Had a beautiful cabin at that time. We caught more walleyes over 20"" than under. It was the best walleye fishing I've ever had. I have been flying out of Armstrong for 6 years now, but the walleye fishing has never been as good as it was on Murdock. I have some buddies trying to go to Murdock this year, and was wondering if CFF was still a good outfitter. It must have been something back in the '70's. Wish I could have experienced it then."
552643,phishfearme,2005-10-14 06:23:00,1242,"do you mean canadian fly-in fishing / amik outposts out of EAR FALLS? if so, they're among the best but also about the most expensive. i've been to two of their lakes, springpole and sherstone - both were excellent but totally different lakes and the service provided was excellent - including a motel right at the airbase. - phish"
552652,jigman 2003,2005-10-14 10:59:00,981,"Nope, it is Canadian Fly-Fishing out of Red Lake (at least it was when I used them). They had Murdock, Piesk, Roberts, Job and couple other lakes. Thanks for the reply, though"
552657,Guest,2005-10-14 14:46:00,0,"I WENT LAST YEAR TO THICKETWOOD THROUGH CFF AND THEY ARE GREAT. THEY HAVE ADDED URINALS INSIDE THE CABINS. THEY HAVE A COVERED AREA OUTSIDE ON THE DECK TO GRILL. THEY CHECK ON YOU NEARLY EVERYDAY. EVELYN IS ""ALMOST"" RETIRED NOW AND HER DAUGHTER DIANE RUNS THE COMPANY. THEY DO A GREAT JOB! VERY NICE PEOPLE. I HAVE FRIENDS THAT GO THROUGH THEM EACH YEAR AND LOVE IT."
552658,jerry bark,2005-10-14 15:20:00,822,urinals inside the cabins???? the skeeters must be REALLY bad there. LMFAO jerry
552661,Guest,2005-10-14 18:04:00,0,"Back in the 70's, cff was owned and operated by Jim Thomas (of the Jim Thomas Outdoors Show). When I was a kid in the 50's, I remember watching his show every Sat. nite at 9:00 on WGN Chicago. He died about 9 or 10 years ago, I think. Now you want to talk about an old boy who could drink some beer..........."
552779,Guest,2005-10-24 20:22:00,0,"I can vouch for the urnials in the cabins as I have used them. They also have solar lights in the cabins which also interacts with the water supply for the cabin.. High tech stuff which keep the customer happy. Seriously, great people and great lakes to fish. They are teaming with 'eyes. Fishboy"
