Face it - it doesn't matter where you are, you have to follow the rules or you pay the price. If you are rude to the authorities, then they will use their authority to be rude to you... Doesn't matter where you are, you won't win. The rules were made up for a reason - not saying that they're right, however, it is not my call and I would think that we should respect those that did.As for the nationality bashing, well... I know lots of dorks on both sides of the 49th - Please judge a person for who they are, not where they come from. If ya gotta beef with the authorities, talk to them, but don't hold it against me just because I was born here which was out of my control...And although we are taxed heavily, we have our rewards. It kinda grows on you and you accept it.there are pluses and minuses on both sides, that is what makes us all unique. But you can't badmouth one or the other because you don't agree with the other system. Remember, what works for one may not work for another.I personally don't care who or where my fishing partner is or is from, as long as we have fun...and I have had a blast fishing with people from both sides and as a matter of fact, they are usually just people like me - they want to fish!It is all about respect for your fellow human being, whether it be their nationality, job, color, or what kinda boat they ride. I'm going fishing tommorrow with a couple of Americans I've never met face to face - and I'm excited as ever! Now that I've vented, I'm going to go tie some spinners...It is all about having some fun! Chris"
