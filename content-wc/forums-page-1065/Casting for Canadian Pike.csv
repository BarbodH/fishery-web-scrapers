508551,Guest,2000-06-16 05:47:00,0,I am fishing Allenwater in July and could use some sugg. on what type of lures would be good for casting for northern pike?
508552,Guest,2000-06-16 07:19:00,0,"Look for well established weed beds near deep water. Burn spoons and bucktails over the tops of the cabbage stalks and make sure your hooks are SHARP. Use hot colors in stained water, gold, sliver, red/white, 5 o diamonds in clearer water. One ounce daredevle's and Red Eye Wigglers work well as do size 5 and lager mepps and vibrax bucktails. If you troll, target the outside edge of the weeds adjacent to deeper water. In july the big pike will be seeking cooler water so they may down as deep as 20 feet. If so big deep diving crank/minnow baits will ring the dinner bell. The weeds should be full of medium sized pike with the occasional gator but the big girls will definitely be deeper, especially if it is sunny and hot. Best of luck..can you tell I love to fish for pike?"

First of all, find the weed beds, perfect hole would be 12 feet of water with weeds reaching 6-8 feet, or 4 -6 feet under the surface. Reeds and lilies are another good bet. I would not leave home without an assortment of 6 inch suspending baits. Husky jerks in black and silver, blue and orange, perch colours, even green pike immitations but my favourite has to be the fire tiger pattern. Rebels suspending rogues are also a great bait to cast in the same colours. Zara spooks and ""small"" topwater baits have proven to be great pike killers when action was hot and then slowed down. Work your suspenders very erratically first, if nothing takes use a quick twitch and then let it sit, this will often trigger a hit from wary pike. If you notice you're getting a lot of follows but no takers, use a slower retrive and let the bait sit for a little longer in-betweeen each twitch. This may sound a little un-conventional but trust me it works. When using a 6 inch suspending bait and you're getting a lot of follows, there is this teqnique you can also try, it's a little secret of mine but let me know how it works for you! Tie on a piece of 10-12lb mono to the ""last"" gang of hooks on your bait (I mean right to one of the hooks), all you need is about six inches. Then tie on a fair sized streamer or minnow immitating fly. A lot of times the fish will see the bigger bait but take the small streamer following it. Hope this helps a little,Tips Up! Bof."

The Jacks will hammer them.LOL and get bit."
508556,chrism,2000-06-17 20:44:00,429,"I fish for the big ones in the same manner as all the previous posts - once the water hits 50-60 degreesF they will start venturing deeper. I have had good success trolling big stuff as if you were after muskies..Big (7-10"")rubbertails /suicks/lindy plugs in a sucker color with a fast stop and go.Good luck and hang on!"
