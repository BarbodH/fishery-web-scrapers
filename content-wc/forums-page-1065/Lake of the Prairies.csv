Does anyone know if you can buy leeches by the pound in Russell and approx what I can expect to pay? Thanx!"
508595,gap,2000-06-20 10:21:00,25,"buy your live bait at mike's bait and tackle, i was at lake of the prairies two weeks ago for a tournament and bought a lb of jumbo for 35.00 and medium for 30.00. i use leeches most of the time but last saturday a friend was using crawlers and there was little difference in size and quantity of the fish we caught. where are you staying and then i'll give you some ideas where to fish this lake. either north end or south end. by the way where are you from maybe there is some other stores inn the area i could suggest."
508596,Guest,2000-06-20 12:14:00,0,"Hey Gap, thanx for the reponse. We are going to camp, probably at the park at the south end of the lake unless you can recommend someplace better. We are driving up from the Minot area on Saturday morning as soon as the border opens and staying late enough on Sunday to hit the border while still open. We planned on bringing our own crawlers but the prices don't seem so bad especially if you consider the exchange rate. Any areas of the lake you could point us to would be great, I have a GPS if you by chance have coordinates for any good spots. How large were the fish you were catching? What do you consider the best way to fish a leach on that lake? Around here I do pretty well with spinners/crawlers and when I do fish leaches, I usually slow drift a lindy sinker,3ft leader, and a leach on a gumdrop floating jig head. Again, any help you can offer is appreciated! Thanx- Mike"

Bottom bouncers and spinners, jigs and frozen salted minnows, I rarely bother with live bait, mostly berkely power bait, to keep the perch from robbing you blind. 1 power crawler will go thru 12 fish at times. You can also cast cranks to shallow boulders with the wind blowing in, hot n tots bouncing off the rocks. do not consider staying anywhere but the govt. camp ground at the south end of the lake. my buddy was there all of last week and did not have to go more than 2 miles north of the marina in a week. the fish are on any windy point you will not miss them.... the boulder field is about 3 miles up on west side. if you decide you want leeaches after you can always go the 20 miles to town. if you want an airphoto angling map go to canadamapsales.com any other questions email at [email protected]"
508598,gap,2000-06-21 12:10:00,25,"with leeches i fish them on an odd ball jig or any other standup jig, i also like to lindy rig on the flats. i do most of my fishing this time of the year close to pyott's campground 2 miles either way of the campground. the government campground is the best place to stay and pyott's is about a 10 mile boat ride from there. the west side of the lake has 3 islands that are small with submerged rocks around them that have been very productive. i have caught 1 master angler already and have caught many 25""to 27"" fish. any more questions e mail me at [email protected]"
