508562,Jesse-WI,2000-06-16 08:46:00,534,We usually cross the following Saturday and the wait has always been less than 30 minutes unless we got searched.
508563,GetTheNet,2000-06-17 15:13:00,29,"I was accross this morning at about 9:15am, and it took about 45 min. Not too bad. Comming back at 1:30pm, the line to cross into Canada was nearly twice that long. Should be 20 - 40 min at 8am.RB"

Here's what happened to us last Saturday while crossing to Canada around 10:00 am.The line was miles long, down past the railroad tracks and lumber yard and it took us 3 hours to get across. They were stopping almost everybody!Apparantly the Canadian government has a rift going on with Boise-Cascade of Int.Falls(part owners of the bridge) over badly needed repairs and lane additions. Boise isn't ponying up any money for the renovations and is expecting Ontario to pay for the majority of it. I get the feeling that Ontario was using last Saturday's huge crowds as an example to Boise-Cascade that they need to do their part in renovating and expanding the bridge to Fort Frances. I don't know if it will happen again, but like I said be prepared.PS: It would be a good idea to use the washrooms as soon as you arrive in International Falls. It would be a shame to wait a long time in line, only to lose your place because you gotta go and can't hold it.Good Luck!"

But to the bright side, it was cold the wind blew every day and rained 3 out of 7. leaches were $22(Can) per pound,( at Big Bear east of Fort Francis best price I found), med size mins. were $4.95 Doz(can), 2 fish at day, 4 in poss. with one only over 18"". but were had the best fishing in years we only kept 16 to 18"" fish but mostly caught 20 to 26"" there was 20 of us and all caught fish. Oh I all most forgot the bugs were not bad either. Good Luck Fishing"
