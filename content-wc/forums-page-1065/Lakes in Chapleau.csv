507719,Guest,2000-05-02 08:51:00,0,"I'm not too sure about the area immediatiely around Chapleau, but I have a camp on Dog Lake which is about a one hour drive from there (Between Chapleau and Wawa). Paved right to the town of Missanabie. Excellent Walleye fishing, as well as Lakers, Pike, Perch, Whitefish and smallies. If you want more info, feel free to E-mail me....BTW, I've seen a 16 lb walleye come out of here"

I've fished that lake for about 8 years, and they're in different spots each year, but normally very decent fishing. 6 pm to dark has been the best times overall."
