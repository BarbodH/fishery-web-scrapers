508583,Guest,2000-06-19 08:00:00,0,"Hey eyesore,I gotta agree with you 100% about stopping the border bashing and about the 99% getting along with the 99%.........Soooooo how come on your last post (#113)you were doing a little bashing of your own?Regarding the world crisis scenario,just suppose that Canada was to totaly disappear from the map.If you kept traveling north in this scenario,who would be your neighbours? You got it buddy. The RUSSIANS. I think you would prefer canucks.....Johnny T...CANUCK......PS..But you are right enough is enough is enough!!"

They should protect their resources and their citizens should have better access to those resources. Northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan have just as many lakes as Ontario. Why don't we have the quality of fishing. Three reasons, roads, cabins, overuse. Each destroys the shorelines water quality, and the fish suffer because of it. Let the Canucks run their own country. If you don't like it write to the MNR or call their representatives to parliment. They are all listed on the Canadian's government's web site. In the mean time, I'll be cruising the Canadian pristine waters, and hauling the Walleyes over the side of the boat. We should take heed, not bash, and examine how we use our own waters. TGG"

Everything we do as a government for the fisheries is political or a Band-Aid solution, thank God for the fish & game clubs and the association out they're stocking and doing clean up programs on lakes streams and spawning beds.I strongly believe the difference between the two fisheries is only different because of population, age and access not that were any better at it than you so don't be hard on your selves or pat us on the back.I know living where I live in the north I will never run out of places to fish in my lifetime, I just hope my children can say the same.Aside from all this I still feel blessed to live in what I believe is the best place to live in the world, Northern, Ontario, Canada even if some think theirs 10 months of winter and two months of bugs.."
