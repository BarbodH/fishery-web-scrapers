508063,Guest,2000-05-28 17:46:00,0,I've been crossing the border into Ontario with leeches for 17 years. Rumor has it that we will no longer be able to do this. Is this true?

508068,Guest,2000-06-04 19:34:00,0,"Recent law on the Candian side has change the law on the import of leeches. You can not bring them into Canada, but a bait dealer on the Canadian side can come into the States and buy them, return to Canada and sell them to you at an inflated price!!!! Where is this treaty called NAFTA?? I can only hope that our Govt. will hear about this and do something about it. As an option I have chosen to use Berkley Power Bait as opposed to the high price leeches. They work great!"
