508609,Guest,2000-06-20 14:32:00,0,"Rusty,There are no bait stores open at that time. They start to open at 6:00 am. Use your bank card at one of the local banks on the main drag. It will dispense the money in Canadian funds at the best rate available, at any time of the day. How far in are you going? I can recommend a bait shop on the way.Good fishing.Jeff"
