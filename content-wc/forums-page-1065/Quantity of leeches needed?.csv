For a weeks tripusually a pound of mixed size leeches per person.And, alot of crawlers, because we bring the excessback home with us. Lately everyone is all excited about leeches, when in reality the crawlers usually will ""out-catch"" leeches most of the time.Walleye just can't seem to pass up a good, HEALTHY night crawler. But when the bite is tuff a HEALTHY leech on a small hook seems to be one answer to shore lunch. My nickles worth. Good luck.Pooch"

Everyone lately is on a leech kick when for us crawlers outproduce leeches most of the time. But you really need both. Somedays the only way to shore lunch is a leech and a small hook. Good fishing.Pooch"
