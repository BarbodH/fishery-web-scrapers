As a consequence we had to make pit stops at the lodge every day for ice. I was told by the lodge owner that there were impurities in the propane supply last year and that most propane run refrigerators functioned similarly throughout Ontario. I have since been assured that this will not be the case this year. DOES THIS SOUND FAMILIAR TO ANYONE OR AM I GETING A LINE OF BS? Thanks in advance for any feedback."
508426,Guest,2000-06-13 09:54:00,0,I've used them for years with no problems and have never had the bad propane syndrome unless I was out or had a regulator problem. The one problem I have had is that if the fridge is opened and closed all the time the recovery rate for cooling is not very good. We always keep our beer and pop ect. in coolers and try to limit the opening and closing. Good luck: Frank
508427,Guest,2000-06-14 12:34:00,0,You are clearly getting a line of bull crap. The operator is not maintaining them. They must be cleaned and keep level. It was not dirty propane! If working properly they do recover quite nicely but they are not like your fridge at home.
508428,Fallsman,2000-06-16 08:53:00,93,"I agree with Hard Water Fisherman, you were getting a load of BS. What makes these things not work properly is when the exhaust vents are not cleaned every year. Propane is a low pressure gas and any kind of restriction in the gas line to the burner or the exhaust will cause them to function poorly. Bad propane ..... now that's a good one!"
508429,Guest,2000-06-16 20:20:00,0,I've been in the propane business for 40+ years and what he told is a bunch of BS. Poor maintainence is the culprit.
508430,Guest,2000-06-16 21:17:00,0,"Big Line Of Crap. A propane FRIG does not use Freon to cool, Im believe it uses An Ammonia compound. If the Frig is not cooling it means it has a low level and probably leaked out through bad seals."
508431,Guest,2000-06-20 06:10:00,0,"Jay, you must be very careful whenever you have an appliance which burns fossil fuels indoors because of the carbon monoxide risk. When I go into an outpost camp I have the pilot check to make sure that the flame is burning clean and blue. I had a friend of mine that took his two daughters up to an outpost and became ill because of CO2 from a poorly operating fridge.If the fridge has not been operating for a while you can get spider webs and other critters in the system which can cause problems. When I first get into camp we do not put any pop or beer in the fridge until they have been cooled down by ice in the cooler as warm pop and beer in the fridge will take forever to cool.Hope this helps for you next trip.Steve."
