The trucks slowing down when going downhill will keep you up all night . Also make sure it is back off the road a little . I usually sleep like a rock , but when traveling and a strange bed I sleep light . I found this out the hard way ."

1455186,unclepaully,2012-06-27 22:29:00,112,On the way back home from our Abamasagi trip we are planning on driving from Nakina down to Nipigon & then take 17 all the way back to Sault Ste Marie. Does anyone have any recommendations for lodging in either Terrace bay or Marathon. We want to break up our trip on the way home so we can do a little sightseeing.
1455200,northernbite,2012-06-28 04:31:00,1186,I stay in Wawa when I come home that way. That is from NW Ontario to Pa.Paul
1455268,unclepaully,2012-06-28 08:39:00,112,"We are staying in Wawa on the way up at High Falls Motel & Cabins, supposedly a really good option. We wanted to drive back a different way and none of us have been along the north shore of superior. I figured Terrace bay or Marathon would break the trip up nicely. Looking online it looks like a lot of run down/older roadside motels are the only options. Just wondering if anyone has stayed at a decent place where it's quiet & clean."
1455287,Mike Borger,2012-06-28 09:40:00,1554,"Wawa is your best bet, there's lots of good motels.Check online, there's descriptions of all of them."
1455296,mroyle,2012-06-28 09:57:00,74,Probably a little too far South for you but there's a really neat place right on the lake in Batchawana Bay. It's callled the Salzburgerhof resort. They have a great restaurant as well. www.salzburgerhofresort.com
1455329,TIGHTLINER,2012-06-28 10:44:00,223,There are several nice motels around the WaWa area. We stayed at the WaWa motor lodge they had a place to eat right there. Remember that area can become very foggy in the early morning hours it happened to us once. Might be better to head to the Soo to avoid this. Just trying to help
1455357,gobblestopper,2012-06-28 11:38:00,36,Normandy Lodge is a short distance North of Wawa just off 17 on the shores of Kabenung lake.
1455426,northernbite,2012-06-28 14:24:00,1186,I also think there is one in Terrace bay.Paul
1455624,pegasis0066,2012-06-29 06:23:00,64,Rock Island Lodge outside of Wawa. Right on the lake and way better than all the typical Wawa motel choices. Eat a Kninniwibi (sp?) Pines.
1455842,downriverbob,2012-06-29 15:57:00,880,"Here is some information about both areas, I stayed in Marathon but to be honest I can't remember where. It is a great ride along east/north shore of Superior.http://www.marathon.ca/article/accommodations-125.asp http://www.terracebay.ca/?pgid=157 BOB"
