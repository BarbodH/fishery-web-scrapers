1455936,Further North,2012-06-29 22:52:00,2008,"Saturday Night...Pike on one of my first casts...and on one of my ""articulated Clousers"".Nothing special, about 22"", hit a red, white and olive Clouser on a #10 bass popper hook with a trailer of the same size and colors hanging back about 3"". Plop - pause - strip - strip - WHAM! Had him to hand in about a minute, back in the lake 20 seconds later.Didn't think I'd move anything off the boat launch, so no camera.Sunday...Caught a buncha pike - maybe 3 dozen? Most in the 20"" - 30"" range had one bigger on for about a minute, had a follow from one that could have eaten a small dog whole.Water is high, this is both good and bad...it's letting us get into some water we could not get into last year, but it's also covering up some rocks that were well out of the water last year. F'rinstance, there's a lake in the middle of one of the islands in Sturgeon Lake - 70 feet deep. Thought it might have some decent fishing as it's inaccessible most years...not so much...but it was still cool to be able to get in there...Oddity of the day....we were followed for a good half hour by a pair of loons (real loons, not politicians).http://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z...k/DSCF1384.jpgOur first thought was that there was a nest on one of the islands we fished near and they were trying to draw us away...or they were just watching us...but they stayed behind us for a a good quarter mile, long after we had left the island behind......a couple of pics from a lake in the middle of an island in the big lake...http://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z...2/DSCF1383.jpghttp://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z...2/DSCF1382.jpgMonday...Buncha Walleye today, a few more pike, and a nice fat smallie.http://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z...allsmallie.jpgThere's a herd of these things on both sides of that waterfall in the background, along with walleye in the hole the water digs out, and more than a few pike.A pike the size of my leg rushed my plastic bait here - even had its mouth open...turned off at the last moment...I pissed and moaned about that for an hour....Tuesday...Man...thought I had the pattern nailed today...caught two 28"" and a 31"" on the way out of Mountain Island Bay...then zeroed in on a group of islands and caught 8 pike between 24"" & 29"" going around a main lake island that was exposed to the wind on its southern point......then I nailed another fat 29"" on my first cast on the south end of the island 100 yards north...then nothing...3 hours later I caught a couple of 22"", then a 24"", then in to eat...a few more pike after diner....Why they call it ""Sunset Country""?http://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z...setCountry.jpgPS: Got bit by a pike. Son-of-a-buck lunged 9"" up a pair of jaw spreaders and sliced up the tip of my right index finger (killed the fish gloves too)...pissed me off...I need that finger this week, dammit.On the positive side, it's now more sensitive than ever, so catching walleye should be even easier...also positive, ZAP-A-GAP works even better than regular superglue for sealing up this kind of stuff...dries slower, but thicker and tougher. The bottle from my fly tying kit is going in my first aid kit, and I'll get a new one when I get home...Wednesday...Tried a ""new"" lake about 25 miles down the road.Lotta little pike, couple of incidental walleye, desolate landscape from recent logging all the way around the lake. Boat launch absolutely sucked. We won't be back to that lake.Thursday...Weather sucked...wind was 25 MPH+, could not even got out of the bay the resort is on, and even the bay had whitecaps that made fishing pretty impractical...I went out anyway (big surprise, eh?) and worked what sheltered areas I could find for pike, spent about 4 hours out and topped the pike chasing with a bunch of mid-20s, and a fat 29""...maybe 25 fish in all. Not a horrible afternoon, but not the best by a long shot.Went on a Moose Spotting Expedition about 4:30 - drove up past Savant Lake got a couple of nice pics, saw the where the Sturgeon River comes out of the big lake...water's high...and fast...http://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z...ver800x600.jpgNo moose, but we did manage to hook a tree...http://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z...ggestcatch.jpgIt was lying across HWY 599......and take in a Panoramic Vista:http://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z...ramicVista.jpg...and I wonder what this is about:http://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z...awanttodie.jpg...and we had a discussion about thesehttp://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z...Polethingy.jpgWhen we saw them last year, we assumed that they were to stabilize telephone poles in swampy soil...but a lot of them were on solid rock...so we came to the conclusion that they were full of concrete and rocks and were the crafty Canadian solution for when they couldn't get the pole to either stand up (swampy) or couldn't get into the rock far enough (""Screw dis, get one o' dem rings, dis @#$%^& ain't gonna go no deeper!"")We did see a cow moose and a yearling (unless they literally grow faster than weeds) on the way to that other lake Wednesday, but they were gone too fast to get a picture.Oh yeah...my trolling motor took a dump as well. Can't wait for the bill to get that fixed....Friday...Not quite as windy, but without a trolling motor, way too windy to fish the big lake for pike...so I ""settled"" for the catch-and-release walleye lake across the highway.Last year I got 60+ minnows for the walleye fishing, and ran out...so I got around 100 (God only knows how many I got, the bottom of the bait well was black with the things). Steve at the Bait and Tackle shop said ""Ya know, with two days of SW wind, dat bay where the river dumps into Young Lake will have a lot of walleye in it..."". This was a spot I'd ignored last year as the main lake points produce absurd numbers of fish...As I was crossing the place Steve mentioned, I was getting all kinds of pings on the Humminbirds....so I said ""What the heck!"" and parked the boat. This was about 12:30. I never made it to the rest of the lake. I literally had to stop fishing for 15 minutes to eat lunch about 3:00 or it would have taken an hour to eat two sandwiches and drink a Gatorade...you could not keep a rod in the water for 90 seconds without a take...I even tried a slip bobber rig to try to slow things down...all that did was increase the size of the fish....Dunno why...Started rigging the slip bobber rig with Gulp minnows and leeches...and TriggerX minnows...didn't matter...Ran out of minnows about 5:00 PM. Ran out of Gulp (two dozen of each and they catch a bunch of fish each) about 6:30...said ""That's enough!"" and tried to head in...but the $#@*!&^ anchor was wedged into something on the bottom...hadda use the boat motor to get it out, was ready to cut it and leave it if I had to.Fish pics...I just didn't take many pics of fish unless they were ""worth it"", so here's a pic of a 23"" walleye. http://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z...wasfishing.jpgNo pics of the 22"", 21"" 20"" etc...there were too many of them. The one that was over 24"" got out of my hands before I could get a shot (that's why I took the 23"" while it was still in the water!)A mallard hen was waiting for me at the mouth of the river to say goodbye...http://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z...od-ByeDuck.jpgYou guys that like to fish who have never been up here truly don't know what you're missing...Wheels up and headed home to my girls tomorrow...can't wait..."
1456172,Larry Mac,2012-06-30 21:26:00,530,"Hi Further North, Thank you for the very nice report and beautiful pic's. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
1456197,1xcleox,2012-07-01 04:30:00,24,Thanks FN. We are on Sturgeon now. Trying to figure things out. Got a couple walleyes last night. Heading out now.
1456222,Catman59,2012-07-01 06:56:00,345,Nice report FN. I wonder how long it will take before someone gets a Smallie on the North end of Sturgeon !!! None that I know of yet.
1456334,Rich B,2012-07-01 12:27:00,1081,Thanks for your trip report and the photos....beautiful waters you fished....hope the surgery on your trolling motor isn't too costly (ha) ! Rich B
1456371,Further North,2012-07-01 14:37:00,2008,"I asked about that...nothing so far...but wow, is it ideal conditions for them."
1456373,Further North,2012-07-01 14:40:00,2008,"Yeah...I'm probably looking at a new electric motor...all the iPilot stuff works fine, as does everything when you hook it up to the foot pedal...the prop just doesn't turn....likely an easy, but spendy, fix."
