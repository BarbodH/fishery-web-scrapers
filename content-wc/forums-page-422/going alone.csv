1455901,BennieS,2012-06-29 19:46:00,108,"After reading Wallydave's What To Do Thread I've been convinced to return to Ontario alone. I went for the first time with my son in the first week of June this year. I think about it every day if for no other reason than to beat myself up for not having gone every year for the last 40 years. I guess it's not too late and hopefully I can grab the next 2o years from Father Time and wish for my good health into my 80's.I've been unable to convince a single friend to join me for the first full week in September. This does however raise a few questions I could use some help with.1) I am sending an email to the resort owners where we stayed in June. They are however a big hunting resort as well. Am I going to have a hard time finding a resort that will bring in one guy? They all seem geared to large parties and of course I do understand the economics of that and it would be tough for a resort owner to make a go of it with single parties.2) Is it even wise to go it alone? 3) How about handling a boat with only one guy in it? I'd assume it would be smart to look for a narrow body of water where a windy week wouldn't leave me stuck in a cabin? Our resort in June was a boat cache lake and I would have some small lake opportunities if I can hook up there.4) How about putting weight in the front of the boat to keep it down in the wind. Would I need to bring my own or would this be something resorts are prepared for and have weights on hand? 5) There's got to be other things I've not thought of at this point as I've just yesterday decided that The Ontario Walleye experience is really ""that special"" that i'd go it alone. Anyone have any advice for the solo guy?I know that over the winter that I read a thread on this very subject and that gentleman was given a lot of advice as I recall. Try as I may, many many searches have not brought me back to that post. I'm stealing a few days from my bow hunt and a few from my deer hunt which previous to our June trip would have been a laughable suggestion had someone made it to me. I'm not gonna say that we rocked the fishing world in June, especially when I read some of the numbers posted here, but we were thrilled every day we went out and every day when we returned and considered ourselves fortunate to have caught all the fish that we did.So, one final question, the biggest walleye I caught was 21"", my son caught a 24 and a 27"", how am i gonna get a picture of myself with one of those big beautiful 25""+ walleyes without setting up a tripod?? hahahahah just one of those things I'll need to figure out as no way will that fish I'm going to catch not be released back into the lake in good condition.Thanks in advance for all the good advice that i know is about to follow. This darn website is both a blessing and a curse as I get all bejiggity if I don't read it every day. It's a disease."
1455911,Rich B,2012-06-29 20:18:00,1081,"You ask some very good questions about heading north by yourself.....you might think about seeing if you could join folks from Walleye Central OR if you could meet up with some guys from Walleye Central at a camp in Sept ? You could have your own cabin and boat, though perhaps fish along with them on the water for a day or two (or the whole week off and on) ? I agree with you that Canada is a very special experience, though it's somewhat difficult to explain to folks back here in the states......I hear ""well now, you know we have pine trees and some white birch trees around our lakes, etc, etc""....as you know, it AIN'T the same !! Good luck with your future travel plans, and hopefully your son will be able to join you for many, many more fishing trips up north of the border in the future ! Rich B"

1455921,JayM5209,2012-06-29 21:15:00,1050,Here's one of the earlier threads on solo trips. Don't know if it's the one you remember or not.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ight=solo+trip
1455925,Golden Eagle,2012-06-29 21:29:00,2642,"I've done a lot of solo trips. Have gone in a week before the walleye opener and fished pike, then met the rest of my guys for a second or third week. I also like going in alone in October and leaving when moose hunters arrive.Take along an extra fuel tank for weight in front of boat. Rocks work also.Have extra stuff with you in case you end up spending a night out on the water. Keep fire starter in your pocket. Shop for a hole in flight schedules. You might even pick up a free day or two or three, if your schedule is flexible. Just do it. It's not a big deal. It's rewarding. Only one dummy in the boat works for me.Fish photos don't matter."
1455971,lassh,2012-06-30 07:01:00,553,"Very small (a few inches),inexpensive, tripods are available with bendable legs that work great for solo fishing pics. Most digital cameras have a timer mode. Just learn how to use the timer function before you go. Scope out where you will be positioned for the photo. I found the best place was sitting on the drivers seat in a tiller boat. Set the camera in the front, in a position to yield the right frame of view. Bend the tripod legs to get the correct angle and to keep the picture square. Mark the location for the camera/tripod either with a landmark (right behind seam on 4th rivet) or put a piece of tape at the location. You can leave the tripod camera set up connected. Its small enough to fit in a bag. I did a solo trip last September on LOW and it was one of the best trips I've had. Now, its different in that you won't have the camaraderie which usually adds significantly to the Canada experience. But you will have solitude and a chance to think, plan and do all on your own. I found it mentally cleansing and healthy. You will really appreciate the sounds of Canada and the peace and challenge of being alone in nature. I don't know if you are flying in, staying at a lodge where there are other people or not. But if you are in and area with cell tower coverage, such as most areas on LOW and I would imagine Lac Suel or Rainey, you can get a temporary international plan from your cell carrier to connect to the Rogers cell network for cell coverage and texting capabilities. That is a nice safety feature if its available and if you have the ability to charge your phone. I towed my 17.5' Aluminum boat up. On day 2 of trip I decided to visit the Kobelka's at Shoal Lake Lodge which is about a 18 mile trip from where I was through the torturous Labyrith Bay. Just as I started back in the evening from Shoal, I hit a rock and took out my lower unit on my Yammie 75. Fortunately I have an 8 HP kicker and was able to just get past the 2nd narrow rapids as it was getting dark. I then used my gps to stay on track and the light of the moon to navigate back. I fished the rest of the week with just the kicker and still had an incredible week. If you have a camp boat with small tiller, put the gas tank forward as far as the hose will allow on the opposite side of the boat to help her level and keep the nose down. Bring a portable gps if possible and make sure you know where you are on the map. When its windy and you hook up a fish, be patient, keep pressure on fish, keep motor running and establish the tail of boat into wind to hold your position (unless the waves are coming over transom). When you get into postion where wind is not going to blow you into shore, then go to neutral with engine running. Just be very careful and enjoy your trip."
1455999,new hips,2012-06-30 08:10:00,498,"I did a solo trip about 2 years ago. In this case the outfitter had 4/ 2 man cabins on a fly in lake, with a on site manager. I would never go it alone without at least a satellite phone (you can rent) I always have my portable GPS with me and overnight essentials. I rigged a clap on rod holder to the bow of the boat for my camera and used the timer, it worked great. This was really a great trip, there were 4 other guys in camp + caretaker, so in the evenings had plenty of fishing talk to go around and share. I know the feeling, our normal group has been dwindling over the past few years, not really sure why........most are retired. This year no one committed, so I'm taking my 2 boys with me. I've already decided next year that if no one commits I'm finding a 2 week trip, probably a drive up camp. There are plenty of outfitters that will fit you in especially if you are flexible with dates. I always go in September, so most weeks have openings. Haven't found an outfitter that wouldn't work with fitting me in, it just makes good business sense. In this economy, I find it hard to believe he will not work with you."
1456011,MidWestFishman,2012-06-30 09:06:00,44,"I read your post with a great deal of interest. My father always went to Canada with me but poor health made him drop out after 2005. I have been fortunate to take my daughter and uncle on 3 trips but as my uncle aged and my daughter became involved in her work, I had to start going solo as I could find no one that wanted to take a week long trip fishing in Canada.I never wanted to be responsible for someone else's property or spend time trying to find fish in a strange lake so always went American Plan and got a guide. Generally that has always worked very well. Last year I went to a lodge that treated me like a king and am going back this September and am really looking forward to it. I checked on several lodges before I made my pick on where to go and was surprised how many will take single fisherman even though they don't state that on their web site. I would say go solo if that is the only option left available to you- you will still have a great time and build great memories. Let us know how it goes when you get back!"
1456067,Gibson,2012-06-30 14:19:00,17,"99.9% of my fishing trips are solo other than when my dog accompanies me which will happen in 2 weeks. Make sure you cover all the bases and feel comforatable with safety issues up to and including a cell or satellite phone. I bush it for the most part but have been well recieved at lodges with a pet in tow for a reasonable price. I don't know where your planning to fish but my experiences have been (lodge wise) Minaki area and Kenora. Northern Manitoba is where I do most of my bushin it fishing and hunting.I find your not in as much of a hurry or feel expected to fill the live well when alone and go at your own pace. Just like hunting, you'll be amazed what you see and hear when your not yacking to your buddies and just sitting......Have a blast.....P.S I've got tons of pictures of fish lying next to a measuring tape, very few of me holding them....doesn't matter to me, but there's lots of tri-pods and cameras with delays.....One important note that I have been guilty of not using but have since soloing, is attatching my kill switch lanyard."
1456171,3M TA3,2012-06-30 21:23:00,2846,"Bennie. Perhaps a real roughing it experience would be in order. Small tent, a good bag, and the bare essentials. I've been doing it for at least a week for the past 17 years and it's been incredible. The only time I've gotten a bit jisttery on these trips has been when the bears come around. For the last 9 or 10 years been camping on a small island and I no longer sleep with one eye open. Used to be just the slightest odd noise would put me on high alert. Now i use ear plugs so that the loons don't drive me batty. You should consider this type experience also. Definitely worthwhile."
