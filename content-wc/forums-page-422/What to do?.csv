1455056,Fishin Fun,2012-06-27 17:05:00,218,I would say to take your wife this year and book next years trip. I'd love to have my wife go with and spend that time. Next year I bet you would find people from this board that would/could go.
1455067,pan-man,2012-06-27 17:27:00,299,"I just got back yesterday from a one man trip to the other end of the English River (Umfreville Lake)Pluses1. Nobody to question what, where and how to fish.2. Eat and fish when you want.3. Eat what you want.4. Leave home/lodge when you want (I woke up accidentally at 3am last day and just decided to head home and was home 4 hours early)5. Decide when to go by weather forecast.Minuses1. A little extra cost as no one to split gas with.2. Being a little more careful not to put yourself in predicaments.3. Not another line in water to help figure out bite patterns.Overall, second best trip out of 15 I have made to Canada."
1455168,wallydave,2012-06-27 21:33:00,2151,"Legendary? Really? Pike has the smoke from all those wild fires got to you!?? Knowing that a couple of days this last trip I caught next to nothing, hardly qualifies me as a legend. I do love my trips North no doubt about that. The more I think about it I may just make it a couples trip. Pike if we were able to meet at the Goose someday that would work for me! Thanks again for the replies!"
1455181,btmbncr,2012-06-27 22:15:00,492,"Wallydave I took a trip ,with a group years ago to Eagle Lake.It was the worst fishing trip of my adult life.They all talked a good game but didn't know what they were doing when it came to finding and catching walleyes.I was the only one in our group that caught any walleyes that week.Twice my ""boat partner"" stayed at the cabin for a nap and I found some rock piles and jigged up some walleyes.When I told the others and showed them the fish they said it was too far to run in the boat and we could catch them""here"".That didn't happen. I have 2 like minded individuals like myself and now my wife that like to fish in a similar fashion.I don't think walleyes are very hard to catch.They are hard sometimes to find,there in lays the fun.Finding them,the hunt,is almost as much fun as catching them. Don't let the perceived lack of success on your recent trip daunt you.Find another guy or your wife and go to Lac Seul next year.The weather may have been your difficulty this year.The pattern for the fish was not what you were use to.Find somebody that likes to fish like you,style/technique,length of time in the boat etc.Go get em tiger!!!Bill"
1455413,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-28 13:47:00,1460,"It would be depressing, if through the long winter months, you don't have a Canadian trip to aim for. We all love to hear about you breakin out a big Cuban cigar, out on the Goose Bay dock, and listening to the loons first thing in the morning. Not really interested in seeing a ""700 day club"" thread! Someday, if the dates work, lets do the Goose Bay thing."
1455447,wallydave,2012-06-28 15:11:00,2151,"Pike I agree about the dreaded winter cabin fever!! The idea of just a few months seperating us and our Wilderness Retreats in Ontario, somehow makes the long winter days more ""bearable""! That and the webcams that show the snow and ice up North! Sent an e-mail to Andrea today to see if she has a cabin open for next June's Fathers Day week. Time will tell! I could never start a 700 Day club, far to depressing an idea!!!! Have a great season, I hope the wild fires will let up! The morning coffee and cigar usually don't have the loon soundtrack, the evening Blue and cigar, thats another story!!"
1455452,vteye,2012-06-28 15:20:00,812,"Sore subject around here, my sons are now leaving the house and buds can no longer afford a trip. Father & uncle don't have the health anymore. A couple of new/ole friends like to arrive at the lake late morning - whats wrong with 5? The Mrs likes being out in the boat in sunny warm weather, no bugs-cold-wind waves etc. Uggghhh... Have never considered a solo trip but may have too once I am down to one in college."
1455504,Blue Lk,2012-06-28 18:02:00,269,"Dave,from reading your countdown posts(which I enjoy),it is very obvious how much your trip north means to you,it is much like watching a small kid waiting for Xmas morning.You cannot stop making the trip because your group has folded.I'm sure their are many on this forum that share your values & passion & would share your cabin/boat on a trip to Goose Bay.I don't know how many years you have been going to Goose Bay but I know Andrea & I'm sure she has you pegged for the type of guy you are.Maybe she could steer you in the right direction regarding hooking up with another group or individual that are looking for the same experiance.Life is short,play while you can."
1455519,wallydave,2012-06-28 18:28:00,2151,"Thanks Rick, I have been at Goose Bay 10 times over the years, one year when her youngest child was just an infant, Andrea was taking a walk around the camp with her child in a wagon. Something came up that needed her attention, so Andrea hands me her 9 month infant. That is the relationship we have, pretty good I'd say. I sent Andea an e-mail today explaining next years situation. Good idea to ask for her help, its hard to believe the responces this thread has created. Many of us find ourselves in the same""boat"" Sorry I couldn't resist, Any way this woulld be a good venue for those of us that want to put a trip together!! Its good they allready have the share a seat section, maybe a Canadian version would be good!!For what is worth I'm trying to get a small cabin for next Junes week of Fathers Day!"
1455641,wallydave,2012-06-29 07:20:00,2151,"My wife and I will at Goose Bay Camp Fathers Day week 2013.This has been a long time goal of mine, to share the beauty of the Canadian Bush with my wife! There won't be endless hours of fishing, but there has been some exploring I've wanted to do too! I'm not sure if there are any other open cabins for guys like me that are finding it harder and harder to put trips together but I'll have an open seat in the Lund Outfitter next year. Good luck to all!"
1454889,wallydave,2012-06-27 12:11:00,2151,"We all know how hard ot is to put a fishing trip together. Finding people that can get the same time off, share a passion for Canadian trips and a group that can get along and work together is a difficult undertaking to say the least.From the looks of things next years trip to Ontario will not happen for our group. Discussion for a shorter drive to include some grandparents, part of our group is a family with two boys, so I understand the family aspect of having the family together on the water!! Still part of me wants to go a little farther North than Wis. Or Minn.!! I mean I still have a whole year left on my Outdoors Card!! In the past our group has been on a off and on schedule, a couple of years of trips, then a couple without. Looks like we are back on that pattern.Time will tell, if it is destined to happen it will, if not well, I'll save a few jigs from a watery grave!!"
1454924,northernbite,2012-06-27 13:38:00,1186,"Real simple in my world, find one guy to go with you. 1 boat pack it and go. You will be so much more happy with just the 2 of you. Nothing against the other people but being friends at home and going to Canada fishing is 2 different things.Just my thoughts,Paul"
1454931,wallydave,2012-06-27 13:54:00,2151,"I thought I had found that one guy. My first boat/cabin buddy and his family are the rest of our group now that his boys are old enough to make the trip. I realize this maybe be just a year or two ""break"" from Ontario, but I would like to go while I still can go and enjoy it!!"
1454932,NathanH,2012-06-27 13:56:00,697,What about a one man trip?
1454963,REG,2012-06-27 14:38:00,445,"Ditto If no one wanted to go with me, I'd go by myself. In fact, someday that might be a fun trip to make. I sure wouldn't miss a year if I could help it."
1454976,wallydave,2012-06-27 14:51:00,2151,"That is my concern with a one man trip. Even though I have been to Canada 10 times, the idea of being alone in a boat even the NW end of Lac Seul is a concern of mine. My wife has said she would like to go, but she won't go fishing, in the boat yes, fishing no. With our walkies we could keep in touch that way. It's still early yet, I just have to be patient!! Thanks for the replies!!"
1454978,northernbite,2012-06-27 14:52:00,1186,Going by your self is not a bad idea. I am thinking of doing that justo entertain my self soon. I may get to know me better. Paul
1454984,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-27 14:58:00,1460,"Seems to me Dave, that you should book your trip for next year. I'd bet that there are a lot of fellas on this board who would love to experience the kind of trip that you do. This fisherman for one, would be honored to be able to fish with the legendary Wallydave. There are a lot of us in the same boat, so to speak, that have groups that are shrinking due to attrition. Lets face it, the economy sucks and some of us are getting too old. Situations change. I think your thread should be ""Who wants to go to Goose Bay Camp"". Just can't imagine a guy like you having to wait 700 some days to get back up there again. Good luck with whatever you decide to do!"
1455049,Rich B,2012-06-27 16:49:00,1081,"Wallydave, If your wife said she'd like to go up with you, I say do it....so if she reads or just talks with you in the boat.....you could troll 2 lines (if you get her a license) and she's content to read or snooze..... I take a week every year with my wife up ""nort"" and it's a great week....not the same as with my buds, but that's OK and in some respects even better....I don't know if your wife has ever been up with you before, and if not, it may give her an appreciation for the great north. As the other boys said, if you can make it happen, do it....life is short.....make good memories ! Faith, Family, Friends.....and Fishing ! Rich B"
