1414689,wingmann,2012-04-01 08:21:00,42,"A group of us will be fishing this area the end of June and would like to know if anyone can recommend certain area maps, plus give me an idea on what to use for walleye, northern and smallmouth. I would be greatful for any advice. Also, does anyone know how the reception for cell phones is in the area? We will be staying on an island.Thanks,Wingmann"
1414727,Bill Krejca,2012-04-01 09:46:00,6107,"The best map I have used has been ""Sabaskong Bay"", No. 6214, published by The Canadian Hydrographic Service, Dept of Fisheries and the Environment, Ottawa. It is available from a multitude of sources, and is the standard carried by just about every resort in the area. If you are like me, you'll want to study it before getting there. If you do a Goggle, mail sources should be shown. Can't help you on the phone availability, have never cared to try it, it just might work! More seriously, the resort probably has outside world accessibility should an emergency arise. Good luck, it is a great area. Bill Krejca"
1414741,bricken,2012-04-01 10:21:00,14,"I will second that!!! I will also be in the morson area around the end of June, and I had the same questions. Are there good walleye spots close or will we have to cover some water to get to them? we have one boat in the group with a 30 hp motor and one with a 175hp ( which I am in). LOL for the other boats sake I hope we have good fishing close by. June is right around the corner!!"
1414847,mlure,2012-04-01 15:28:00,15,"Plenty of good spots around Morson. We have a trailer up there and fish close by and catch all the fish we want. Jigs, bottom bouncers, minnows and crawlers. You don't have to chase all over the lake for fish. We carry a Jitterbug cell phone and have good reception with it."
1415041,fastpitch,2012-04-01 22:45:00,4,"I've been fishing the Morson area for over 15 years and would agree with the above posts. Buy a map, even if you have all the modern navigation equip. Just a few years back, a cellphone was worthless. Now, i believe the reception is excellent out west, close to Minnesota, and still somewhat iffy around the Morson area, but worth having in a pinch. Like Bill, i'd rather not have it on, and rarely do."
1416174,Obabikon,2012-04-04 06:56:00,2370,"If you have verizon, you will have service. If it's not working, take the battery out and let the phone sit for a few minutes. Then start it back up. If you don't have verizon, it's iffy. AT&T does not have service up there."
1416202,LOW1,2012-04-04 07:51:00,2828,"Also, Verizon has a calling plan which eliminates the rather stiff roaming charge in Canada. The plan doesn't require a long term commitment so if you are planning on using your phone a great deal in Canada it may be worth looking into. There are a few dead areas between Fort Frances and Kenora, but generally I have always had good luck with Verizon in the east side of the LOTW area."
1416498,wingmann,2012-04-04 18:22:00,42,"Thanks for the info. One of the guys going owns his own business so I know he will need his phone. The rest of us were wondering since the collect calls to home can get pretty expensive.Does anyone have advice as far as types of lures to bring or how we would likely be fishing for northerns, smallmouths and walleye?Im guessing we will be jigging for walleye but what size and color of jigs would you recommend?For smallies - does anyone have a favorite lure? (shad raps, crawfish baits?)Northerns - Any suggestions besides spinner baits?Thanks for any advice.Wingmann"
1416653,Ia Walihntr,2012-04-05 06:23:00,320,"Wingman, I bought a ""Telus"" card (prepaid long distance card) from the resort I stay at in Morson. The cost was $5.00 for 120 minutes, or 4.2 cents per minute. I bought it in 2010 and have used it for a weeks trip in 2010 and 2011. Still some minutes left on the card. Would call home every night and talk for about 5 minutes. The cards are definetely worth the cost! Marv."
1456307,Lunkerbass21,2012-07-01 11:31:00,25,We fish around the barrier islands and do very well with jigs and bouncers. I'll be updating my blog everynight this year the week of July 9th at www.newyorkfishingreport.com Can't wait to start chasing fish on LOTW!!
