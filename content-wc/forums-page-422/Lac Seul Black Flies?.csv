1455222,Skywagon,2012-06-28 06:12:00,1106,"They were horrible yesterday, the worst we have had them all season to date. My fishing partner's ankle was swollen from bites (he has problems with black flies also). As has been mentioned, deet works for a while, but must be applied constantly, tall boots and long pants are the best."
1455238,mswope13,2012-06-28 07:16:00,73,"I can't remember these critters ever being as bad as they were last year! The staff recommended to keep wiping down the boat and keep the fish stank off which draws them in? Any truth to that?Mike, we go straight through to Ear Falls (16 hours), and stay at Evergreen Lodge. What a fantastic place and they do a tremendous job. What camp are you out of?"
1454123,mswope13,2012-06-25 22:00:00,73,"Are there any reports on those nasty ankle biters this year? My groups not heading up till July 24, but I need to start preparing my mental toughness threshhold."
1454198,jkonop,2012-06-26 07:08:00,544,"I got back this past weekend, not Black Fly issues. Although the 60 May Flies (Huge Hatch evidently, I even found some more in my boat when I got home...) in my boat every morning did upset me.."
1454201,Mike Kansas,2012-06-26 07:12:00,1463,Try putting dryer sheets in your socks. Those pesky Flys hate them.
1454204,mswope13,2012-06-26 07:19:00,73,"Thanks Mike, noticed you live in Olathe. We are meeting up in Olathe and leaving for Ear Falls. When are you heading up?"
1454206,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-26 07:21:00,235,"Bring a fly swatter in the boat and take time between casts to bludgeon them. Even so, you will get bit. I usually just admit defeat. If fish are biting, it bothers me less. I just got back from the Sylvania Wilderness area in the U.P. and had about 50 bites around my ankles. Just finally starting to heal."
1454221,btmbncr,2012-06-26 07:48:00,492,"The last time I was at Lac Seul we used White Mountain Insect Repellent for mosquitos,black flies and no seeums.It works great.It's all natural,no deet in it.I was skeptical until I tried it.I was there for 2 weeks with no fly bites.It comes in a little bottle with a spout.I put some on a piece of paper towel them applied it.It worked so good I bought 4 more bottles so I'm never with out.Got a bottle in the boat,truck,car and house.Bill"
1454287,Mike Kansas,2012-06-26 10:01:00,1463,We are leaving late Thursday night 6/28. We drive to Dryden and stay overnight and head for Lost Island Lodge on Saturday morning. This is the trip we take our wives on which coincidently means the guys drink a lot. Just got back from Lac Seul two weeks ago and the fishing was the best we have seen it in 28 years. Where are you staying at? Mike Kansas
1454336,Jesse-WI,2012-06-26 11:42:00,534,I solve the ankle fly bite issue by buying fishing pants that are 2 inches longer than I normally wear.
1454789,jswinter40,2012-06-27 09:21:00,127,"Mike,i forget what resort you go out of the first trip each year up there? Mahkwa? Anyways, i am missing out this year but the group I go with is going up after the 4th. Where you fishing shallow shoreline struture yet or more main lake structure yet? depths? helping out my regular group and crying that I won't be there."
1455153,stillangling,2012-06-27 20:50:00,149,"The things you are referring to are called stable flies. I agree, very nasty. They tend to want to get you only around the ankles. I typically wear wool socks when they get bad. Real fashion statement with sandals! Alternatively bug spray on your feet and lower legs with deet works well but you have to apply it frequently. As far as an update on their numbers, they are just starting to get bad and should peak about the time you arrive..."
