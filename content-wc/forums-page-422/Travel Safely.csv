And although this may be quasi-political (and therfore boneyardable), I hope that everyone can agree that the good points of our nation outweigh the bad."

And while I will be out of the country on the 4th of July, I still plan to take a moment to reflect on the wonder that is my home country. Despite all the things about my country that I think could be improved, and disagreements I have with my fellow Americans on many issues, I remain proud to be called an American. Safe travels to all, and hoist a beer to Lady Liberty and the entire USA on the 4th . . . Bill"
