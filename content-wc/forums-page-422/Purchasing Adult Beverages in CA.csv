1456228,Bitinlight,2012-07-01 07:07:00,95,We did a study and compared costs of various options a few years ago and it seemed that the best bang for your buck is at the Duty Free in International Falls just before you cross. They have a pretty good selection

1452937,Sidge61,2012-06-23 04:58:00,59,What about stores at Sioux Lookout? What liquor and grocery stores are there and any idea where they are located?
1452948,phishfearme,2012-06-23 06:08:00,1242,"a case of 24 oz (355ml), full alcohol content blue is $37 canadian - the smaller size cans are $30 a case. the savings associated with doing the ""buy duty free beer at the border and pay the duty"" is not as large as it once was. not long ago a duty free case was $9 and the duty was $9 - that was about a $20 a case savings. now the savings is about $10 a case. phish"
1452987,Mark R,2012-06-23 08:03:00,1538,$10.00 a case X 5 = $50.00 enough for a couple more cases
1453068,1xcleox,2012-06-23 12:21:00,24,"Is there a beer store or duty free store by the pigeon river crossing? This might sound like a stupid question, but does the one case limit apply to only adults? We have more kids than adults, can we bring a case in under their name? No, they won't be drinking it....."
1453070,nemusky,2012-06-23 12:22:00,60,As long as they are 19 or older.
1456066,tooski,2012-06-30 14:11:00,393,This man knows beer.
1456168,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-06-30 21:00:00,84,Not trying to argue with you but we buy bottles. Case of 24. 12oz blue and blue light. 390.00 for 13 cases. Double checked the receipt. Not sure about the alcohol content.
1456185,Walleye10pm,2012-06-30 23:11:00,71,"There is a beer store in Keewatin, can't remember the name but they have a good selection."
1452657,Slashorn,2012-06-22 11:16:00,19,"Granted that I will be only transmitting the maximum allowable from the U.S. on my trip to Minaki, does anyone have any recommendations on where to purchase additional beer or alcohol in Fort Frances/Emo/Nestor Falls/Sioux Narrows/Kenora before I hit minaki?Thanks"
1452661,Medds1,2012-06-22 11:26:00,18,"Buy the extra at the Duty free store in International Falls. When asked at the crossing, just be honest and they will give you a yellow slip that you take in the building and pay the extra duty on the amount you are over.Example: This year we had 7 guys.We took 25 cases and 2 bottles across. Beer at the Duty Free is 5 cases for $80. $16/case if purchased in bulk.We had 27 units of alchohol, minus the one freebee for each guy=20 units over.For the 20 extra cases I paid $190. $190/20=$9.50 per case over.$25.50 is still cheaper then paying the $48 per case when you get across.Any questions message me.The border guy just laughed and said ""Oh I see you are from Wisconsin, try the fishing you might like it"". We have been doing this for 20+ years, it may add an extra 10-15 minutes but it is way cheaper."
1452670,camp chef,2012-06-22 11:45:00,915,"Labatt's Blue is $29.95 a case at Dalseg's in Nestor Falls.It is a nice grocery store too, for final food purchases...Easy to stop at and very nice people. Right on the highway and there is a bakery and sporting goods shop in the same complex.They also have liquor and wine if beer isn't your drink of choice."
1452684,LOW1,2012-06-22 12:16:00,2828,"The LCBO in Ft Francis will be right in front of you as you turn left onto 71 after clearing customs. Parking can be tight.LCBO in Emo is on right (north) side of 71I agree that Dalseg's in Nestor Falls is a nice store - good selection of most things that you could need. Very convenient parking, etc.LCBO in Sioux Narrows is on the east side of the road in between the Government Dock road and the bridge. If you cross the bridge while going north you missed it. Also very convenient with good parking.There's a Beer Store in Kenora (downtown mall) and an LCBO in downtown Keewatin. Stopping in Kenora may take longer than other places. You may want to take the bypass around Kenora rather than stopping at all.Pay attention to the store's hours to make sure that you will be going through when they are open.All have a good beer selection and all can be a bit thin on wine."
1452723,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-06-22 13:30:00,84,"Just bought 13 cases in kenora. Wasn't $48 a case. Was 390.00 total. That's 30.00 a case.Used to bring our beer when we had an rv, now we use a van and have no room for that much beer."
1452729,Mohleye,2012-06-22 13:42:00,368,"There's also a Beer Store in Ft Frances. I don't remember the exact address, but you can look online. The main thing to remember if you want to buy beer/liquor in Ft Frances or Dryden is the stores are not open very late, like 7PM. I don't know about Kenora or Nestor Falls. We buy our beer in Canada, and cost is in the $30.00 range. A small difference, but worth it to us not to have to mess around at the border with paying duty."
1452732,LOW1,2012-06-22 13:48:00,2828,"http://www.lcbo.com/products/index.shtmlHere's a link to a site with maps to the LCBO stores, products, etc.But just remember ""Labatt's"" and ""Blue"" and you will be fine."
1452763,Slashorn,2012-06-22 14:45:00,19,That last one was awesome.. Thanks for all the tips! I will let everyone know how it went.
1452770,SinOrSwim,2012-06-22 14:54:00,1528,"We buy ours locally and carry it over. Pay the extra duty which is quite a bit but I think it's still much cheaper than buying over the border.In addition, depending on when you plan to cross their stores have odd hours for selling beer. Meaning, unless you are there in the middle of the day you are SOL. Even if planning to be there during normal hours there can always be a delay of some sort.Also, helps with packing. We take quite a bit up, like someone else 20-30 cases so packing that after we have everything else already packed requires completely repacking. Easier to just buy, pack and pay duty.LOL We also get the wise cracks from the border guys about remembering our trip."
1452864,NARDA 1,2012-06-22 19:43:00,636,Might want to add Kokanee to this list!!!!!
