1456063,Gibson,2012-06-30 14:05:00,17,"My Moose area takes us up a river system that takes some stealthy manouevering up some rapids to get our camp in place. Not many venture past these rocks and we've got the whole stretch of about 5 miles to ourselves.Not only is the Moose action fantastic but the Walleye hit a bare jig. No need to bring in tubs of minnows. Walleye makes up the majority of the menu on a daily basis. Northern Manitoba.....Gods country.Not untouched, but quiet for almost the whole year."
1454907,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-27 13:03:00,235,"Are there lakes in the far north that have walleyes and northerns in them but no outposts, no roads or trail access etc? I'm talking about lakes that receive no fishing pressure whatsoever. Just curious."
1454968,Mike Borger,2012-06-27 14:43:00,1554,"Of course there is, although they tend to be the smaller lakes.Most of the very best fishing I've experienced has been on my lengthy canoe trips north of Armstrong up to Hudsons bay.Plenty of lakes with zero pressure, many of which I'm relatively certain had never been fished before by anyone."
1454969,clearis,2012-06-27 14:43:00,47,"Since no one has fished these lakes, there is nothing to report."
1454972,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-27 14:47:00,235,That sounds amazingly fun! Nice to know places like that still exist.

1455162,TroyMansfield,2012-06-27 21:08:00,92,"I have been to lots of bush lakes fishing and some I am sure have never seen a lure, incredible walleye fishing, hard to find much for size, meaning anything over 23, hundreds of 17-20'' eyes though, found one pothole in the bush once where smallest walleye we caught was 5 pounds and we caught 40 walleyes that day between 2 canoes, **** of portage, but worth it for sure"
1455565,chris.brock,2012-06-28 20:37:00,112,"like Solo said, lots of lakes with zero pressure, it's interesting though that an unfished lake isn't necesarily stacked with fish, top predators like walleye and pike are never teeming like you would see in a rainbow trout aquaculture pond"
1455995,stillangling,2012-06-30 07:59:00,149,"Of course there are litterally thousands of unfished lakes, mostly in NW Ontario. That being said they are small and tend to be in the far north. Unfished doesn't necessarily mean the best fishing. There is loads of information available on-line regarding potential productivity of walleye lakes. If you get too far north productivity suffers due to climate. Nutrients are also critical. Not by chance that the majority of users on this site are fishing lakes that are part of the English River or Winnipeg River drainages. Thick like soup broth and very productive systems. IMO you can find lakes in that belt between Ignace and Sioux Lookout with virtually no fishing pressure if you are willing to put in the work to get to them. Some keener has probably been there before you but not often enough to have any impact on the fishing. Maybe I am just getting older but I can splash my boat into awesome walleye water without having to pay for a float plane or carry a canoe. To each his own but effort expended to get there is not directly proportional to fishing quality."
1456007,NMG,2012-06-30 08:25:00,1053,"Yes, there are probably thousands of unfished lakes. Like others have said though, fish won't be found in all of them. Many of those lakes would be barren or only hold minnows and stuff like that. Fish will be where the conditions are favourable for them, not simply because there is water there.Honestly, there are probably tens of thousands of lakes across northern Canada that have never even seen a person. Much of the country is still very much undeveloped. If you REALLY wanted to explore, you would ignore the Provinces altogether and focus on Canada's Arctic. I cannot imagine the Arctic Char, Whitefish, Grayling and Lake Trout swimming in some of those waters that have never seen anything resembling human contact. Just to give you an idea, Canada's Arctic makes up roughly 40% of all the land in Canada and there are only like 100,000 people living there (and the majority of those would be in a handful of locations) . . ."
1456022,v-bay gord,2012-06-30 10:49:00,3168,"If it can be reached by a float plane, canoe, atv, or snowmobile, it's already been fished."
