1454901,bigvenison,2012-06-27 12:50:00,15,I feel sorry for US citizens coming to Ontario and being charged for having a beer with your lunch --this is absolute nonsense -- for goodness sakes OPP stay on the roads and do something more useful than charging a tourist for 1 beer --a concerned Ontario citizen
1454914,dkrusin,2012-06-27 13:14:00,97,"Sometimes it is very hard to define the word normal. My normal is 2 or 3 cold ones at shorelunch. Sometimes Labatts, other times Kokanee, really depends if we have fried fish or baked fish. You see for our group of 10 this is quite normal and has been for 30+ years. But I see for many on this board this would not be so normal or accepted and I have no problem with that.PS. We have even been known to drink a few Whiskeys and smoke cubans when we get back to the cabin. Lord I appologize."

Some people are too quick to judge!!Problem is you may have one and another guy has 6 and another has 12. The few always ruin it for the many. Not saying ""you"" have a problem. It never stops at one for a lot of folks. I don't need to have one. Sure it would be great, but I don't need one. So Im ok with the zero policy. If it gets the goofs off the water, I'm all for It. Like I said, I come to fish. I can have a beer at home. Have some friends killed by one of those people and you'd understand."
1455073,nicko,2012-06-27 17:39:00,508,Havin some at camp is great. I will have a cigar and a scotch too. I'm just sitting in a chair admiring the view at that point. I'm not driving a boat or a car and potentialy hurting myself and others. There is a difference.
1455499,Terwalleye,2012-06-28 17:40:00,166,"Who knew? The beer in the boat topic is a hot button!?!?! Let see, Next to start a thread about politics and then one about religeon. The way I see it; if you do bring a beer; no one will convince you otherwise. And if you think it's just riduculous to even think about bringing a beer; I can't convince you. Let's face it if the guy posting disagrees with you all you are gonna here is"

1455794,J.Iverson,2012-06-29 13:41:00,64,Are our boating fatalities that much higher per capata in the states where alcohol consumption is allowed in the boat?? It is normal to have a designated driver in our crew when fishing/boating Minnesota waters while the rest of the crew is being festive. No different than returning from a bar in Canada or the US via car??
1455798,vteye,2012-06-29 13:50:00,812,Its all about common sense. Yep the Ontario OPP are creating anew revenue stream in the name of law enforcement. Same type of thing happens with other laws in the states. I think its unfortunate responsible adults cannot enjoy A cold one at lunch without risking penalties. .02C
1454741,PRO-V1,2012-06-27 07:53:00,142,"Bigstorm, i think the cops call it having (accessibility) ie having alcohol anywhere inside the cab. Jig A Low your right about the sleeping accommodations, but alsoa toilet and the boat has to be anchored. If you brought the empties back and the cops found empties in the boat they might give you a hard time and give the breathalizer regardless where you drank the beer. Don't get me wrong guys i'm not against beer in the boat, i lived in Pickle Lake for many a year we fished 3,4,5 days a week and we never left shore without a case of beer, but times are a changing.Mike"
1454742,Bob_Loblaw,2012-06-27 07:53:00,109,"What are the other 24 reasons you no longer fush Ontario? That would be an interesting list, I'm sure. Me? I'm counting the days (11 more!) til I leave for my time in Sunset Country. And neither me nor any of my five fellow travelers will be bringing any beer. We're there for the fishing and the peace and quiet, and certainly don't need alcohol to enjoy either."
1454790,ohiojmj,2012-06-27 09:22:00,1262,"The hassles a hard working guy has to put up with to down a couple of cold ones on a hot afternoon on a lake in the middle of nowhere in Canada, yikes. However, I do support sober operation of motorized toys ....How many hard core drinkers will change their ways versus sneaking bourbon in a coke, tossing the empties 30 yds into the woods on a shore lunch stop, or fill the bottom of the lake with ten cent returnables? There will always be wreckless careless people."

1454838,Freytown,2012-06-27 10:42:00,770,"Sidge61, I am as bad as you, I even drank ""a"" beer in the boat while fishing in Quebec on my vacation in early June. I better join an AA club cuz I'm a bad man."
1454846,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-27 10:50:00,1460,"You are absolutely correct! I'm afraid that with these zero tolerance policies, fishermen of all nationalities will be sinking their empty beer cans just to get rid of the evidence."
1454847,Sidge61,2012-06-27 10:50:00,59,Not just AA Freytown but I'm starting to learn the Serenity Prayer as well. God help me as I'm a bad man because I want a cold one at shore lunch. Like I said I have seen more locals (native americans) bring and drink while in the boat then the guests. One would take his knee-high rubber boots each days filled with ice and beer.
1454866,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-27 11:21:00,235,"While we're at it, we should legalize alcohol in the car. What's wrong with having one beer while you drive?"
1454870,Sidge61,2012-06-27 11:26:00,59,Whats wrong with having one while parked on shore during shore lunch? Same as parking the car and having one while having lunch at a place.
1454876,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-27 11:43:00,235,"There's no inherent problem with it, but it gets hard to enforce as compared to other forms of drinking."
1453862,camp chef,2012-06-25 13:16:00,915,I have heard from a reliable source (friends who just returned) that the OPP has been busy in the Armstrong area enforcing what they call a zero tolerance policy with regard to beer in the boat. Check with your resort operators before assuming that a beer at shore lunch is no big deal.
1453900,Freytown,2012-06-25 14:19:00,770,"Yikes. What's next in Ontario prohibition? I can see operating a motorized craft while DUI, but nothing in the boat for a shore lunch. Must be 1920's again. I love Quebec."
1454523,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-26 18:04:00,1460,"Chef, When I was in Armstrong last fall, I saw the multi-million OPP station being built on the north part of town. There was an impressive looking chopper on the helipad right there in town. Looks like quite the imposing force to battle this dreadful affliction."
1454640,ranger22,2012-06-26 21:43:00,124,Good it's about time. For those of you that want a beer during shorelunch that's to bad. But I was fishing beside 4 a-holes that where drinking rye and cokes all day and could barely stand. There boat was powered by a 200 v-rod. How would you like having that coming at you at high speeds. Honestly if they die I don't care. But what if they take somebody with them. Now that would be terrible. When I seen the CO i told them and who knows from there.
1454663,PRO-V1,2012-06-27 03:57:00,142,"Keep in mind kids it's a motorized vehicle, it would be like having a cooler of beerin the passenger seat of your truck. Mike"
1454680,Guest,2012-06-27 05:51:00,0,these guys are not talking about getting ripped they're talking about ONE beer with lunch. Is one beer at lunch too much of a temptation for you? Reason no. 25 why I don't fush Ontario anymore!
1454684,nicko,2012-06-27 06:02:00,508,"This is one topic I always love to watch. I for one, love the no beer policy. I come up to fish. You want a beer, stay home. No one ever has one. I can't count the number of times I've been buzzed by some idiot that's had a few and thinks he's now driving miss Budweiser. I laugh when I hear how much beer people drink. Why come to Canada to spend the entire time in a stupor? Of course it's probably a normal state for some. Alcohol and motor vehicles don't mix. I don't care if it's one beer or 50. Most people have a hard enough time driving a boat sober. If you can't fish without a beer, you have a problem. Normal people can wait to get to camp to have one. Nick"
1454703,Bigstorm,2012-06-27 06:53:00,799,"For those of you that say a boat is a motor vehicle, here's a question, can you legally drive a truck/car with beer inside it in Ontario (no open bottles/cans)? If yes, then why cant you have some beer in a cooler in a boat if the alcohol is not open or the driver is not drunk?"
1454714,Jig A Lowe,2012-06-27 07:11:00,87,"I guess the question is: What exactly is the law in Ontario regarding alcohol on a boat and under what circumstances? Is it legal to transport alcohol to a camp site on a boat? Is it legal to have an open container on a boat that has sleeping accommodations? I have frequently observed passengers on yachts/cruisers/houseboats drinking whicle going thru locks. Prior to this thread, I had heard that it was legal to transport non-opened alcohol to a shore lunch and to return with the empties? Is there an offical web site that spells out the law on these situations? Seems like there are a lot of different interpretations."
1454725,v-bay gord,2012-06-27 07:26:00,3168,"I believe that a watercraft that has accomodations on board would qualify for allowing alchohol. Ontario's liquor laws were probably thought up back in the dark ages. You can't just wander around town drinking a beer...you must be doing it in a residence (which could be temporary, such as a camp site). This is where they get you regarding drinking a beer at shore lunch.....drinking in public, so to speak, is not legit. Interpretation seems to be another factor. I believe an unopened container (bottle, case of beer) can be legally transported in a motor vehicle. Believable in a car, but in a boat? Where are you taking it? Can't drink it on shore, not in the boat either.......therefor the interpretation is I will give you a fine. I suppose you could challenge the interpretation in court. Who has the time to do that while on a fishing trip. I suppose the strict interpretation is a result of abuses that have ended up killing people. Right , wrong? Seems to be the way it is. A conservation officer may let it slide, a police officer may not."
