1455053,rather-be-fishin,2012-06-27 16:53:00,429,"Are you coming from WI? Headed WEST on Bong bridge & Hwy 2? If so, no problem cross bridge take I35 South to Boundry Ave. turn Right. Go to stop light which is HWY 2 turn left West on hwy 2 & your good to go. Where in Canada are you going? Other route is Hwy 53 North through Duluth."
1455058,crawler catcher,2012-06-27 17:07:00,72,"Yes, coming up 53 from WI. Will follow your directions. Not sure where I could get through because of construction and flood damage.Headed to Lac Seul....great fishery.Thanks again"
1455165,rather-be-fishin,2012-06-27 21:25:00,429,"Hey Crawler Catcher, The route I told you will work and only a few blocks of a detour. (My son lives in Proctor & I just drove those roads on Sunday) Then are you taking Hwy 2 West to right on Midway road then left on Hwy 53 North? That would be your quickest route and road is open. Hwy 53 North to Virginia, MN is in good shape too. Few quick spots of construction, but won't slow you down. Where on Lac Seul are you going? We also go to Lac Seul and will be leaving in exactly 1 month and can't wait! We have been going for 10 years! Got the tackle box and boat ready to go! RBF"
1455176,crawler catcher,2012-06-27 21:52:00,72,We'll take the route you described.Have fished the English River system from Seperation Lake up to Maynard Falls for ten years. The past ten have fished both ends of Lac Seul and finally settled on the SE section out of Hudson. We stay at Deerpath Lodge. Make 4-6 trips per summer. Will also be back up when you are there. Where do you stay ?crawler
1455183,rather-be-fishin,2012-06-27 22:25:00,429,Wow 4-6 trips a summer....that's AWESOME! Very jealous! We stay in the NW section of Lac Seul at Fisherman's Cove Resort. We have never fished the SE section...... Have a great trip and SAFE travels!
1455439,trapper_john,2012-06-28 14:48:00,83,This is good to know. We will be in Sup. at about noon. Coming from WI we take 53 all of the way up. Going to Wabbie. If you are at the Mac's in Superior about noon and see a red ford edge pulling a Smoker. Say Hi. That be us. Old Man and Old Lady.
1455599,rather-be-fishin,2012-06-28 22:43:00,429,"Trapper John, not sure if your aware, but Hwy 53 Blatnik Bridge is closed North bound for repairs. It is open South bound. You will need to take Hwy 2 West Bong bridge & follow route in previous post. Happy fishin!"
