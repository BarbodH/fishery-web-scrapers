1456031,running bear,2012-06-30 11:23:00,3,Can any one give me some info for Miniss lake run by Slate Falls. Flying in Auf 11. Type of fish and size.
1456042,SinOrSwim,2012-06-30 11:59:00,1528,"We were in Minniss about 12 or so years ago. Walleye and Northern with size being very mediocre. Honestly, we were not very experienced fisherman at the time either so that could have something to do with itHowever, this was not with Verne at Slate Falls but with Guardian Eagle. We were apparently the last group for Guardian and he was selling to Verne. That is how we met Verne and were with him pretty much ever since as Guardian pretty much dropped us off and left us. Not even close to what they promised. Worst trip we have ever had but Verne took care of us at the end and he was excellent. You won't find a better outfitter imo. He also changes his conservation rules on his lakes so the fishing is excellent. We have gone to North or South Gull ever since but we were with Verne until he sold half the cabins to Red Pine. Which in actuality was the name of his main camp. He sold the main camp and 1/2 the outposts. You will stay in teh bunkhouse the night before and use Slate Falls Airways (separate owners). We have never had as consistent and on time service ever than we did with Slate Falls airways. His cabins are always in great condition and everything works. Clean etc. He really does a nice job with upkeep. If you talk to him tell him Hi from the McNulty group. He will probably chuckle, roll his eyes and make some crack about how much beer we took! LOL"

1437497,Hawkfan,2012-05-18 21:32:00,237,I'm with SinOrSwim...Slate Falls and Red Pine are great options.
1437522,wallydave,2012-05-19 04:06:00,2151,"http://www.hiddenbay.com/ I'd like to give this place a try! I just got an e-mail they had a late cancellation, "" Just wanted to let you know, we just a cancellation for a 4 day spot in JUNE at Blackstone Lake. June 12 -16."" Sounds tempting, but that is too close to our Goose Bay trip."
1437534,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-19 05:06:00,235,"If walleye and northern are your target and you want a do-it-yourself cabin that is secluded, I recommend Kabeelo near Ear Falls. Www.kabeelo.com --- been going up there for years. Can provide more info on specific lakes if need be"

1438386,RapShad,2012-05-21 12:31:00,76,Can't go wrong with either one of these outfitters. Verne and John are some of the hardest working guys in Sioux Lookout.
1438490,rpieske,2012-05-21 16:02:00,1276,"I can't believe no one mentioned Nestor Falls Fly-in. One of the best in all of Northwest Ontario. Great camps, great fishing and some of the nicest folks you will ever meet. They KNOW how to treat their clients.www.nestorfalls.com"
1438622,BW,2012-05-21 20:16:00,1816,Esnagi lake thru www.northtoadventure.com is a tremendous lake and lodge. First class operation from the cabins to the food to the boats. They fly out of White River just north of Wawa. Been there 3 times and can't wait to go back in the future.
1438687,Ogoki,2012-05-22 05:19:00,291,"After 35 fly-in trips , my wife and I since 1999 , have used Mattice lake Outfitters . Don Elliot told me they recently purchased another fly-in service to add to their lakes . The ones he bought are Mojikit, Whiteclay , Attwoood , Hurst and Luella . He now has 28 cabins on I believe 16 bodies of water . I have fished Ogoki Reservoir (11 times) , Whiteclay (6 times) , Mojikit ,Auger , Bellsmith , Hurst and Attwood . Some of them at least twice . As you can see ,we love the Ogoki River system . Plan to be at Whiteclay in August . The planes are very clean and first rate . The cabins are VERY, VERY nice . Lund boats and either Mercury or 15 hp Yamaha 4 cycle motors . NEVER have we had a motor problem or ran low on gas . Nice fish cleaning facilities . Plenty of ice . Very good about getting you flown in and out early, depending upon weather of course . They are not cheap, but competative . Our fly-in trips are a big part of our lives so we don't gamble on something cheaper where we don't know what we will have . I am sure there are other very good outfitters too or you guys would not be going back . Don Elliot could right a book on customer service . He started from scratch in 1988 and has one of the highest rated outfitting business in Ontario . Do a search on this forum and you will see . We drive 1150 miles each way to get there . All that being said, we do catch big numbers of fish too . That is what it is all about . I do not get any breaks on price either for saying this ."

1437234,SinOrSwim,2012-05-18 10:28:00,1528,"We have been on a fly-in with Slate Falls about 10 times or so and they do a great job. He sold about 1/2 his cabins to Red Pine Lodge http://www.fishredpine.com/ and we went with them to the same lakes for a few years. The cabins and fishing on North Gull or South Gull are fantastic. I have also heard very good things about St. Joe. If you go with Slate Falls, Verne will treat you very well. They also have a bunkhouse at the main lodge they use to house you the night before you fly out. It's a LOT of fun."
