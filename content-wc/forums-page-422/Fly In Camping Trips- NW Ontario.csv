1455044,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-27 16:41:00,235,"Looking at options for a cheaper second Canada trip for 2013 or 2014 (normally do a fly in outpost trip). Not looking for a resort environment...the group of guys I have in mind to invite are more Boundary Waters/Sylvania Wilderness types - outpost fly in costs scare them. A deal where you fly in, but camp in your own tents and bring your own food and gear seems like it might fit the bill. Outfitter to provide flight, boats, motors gas.Looking for something where the outfitter is less than an hour or two from the border, preferably International Falls or anywhere east as a crossing. I have seen the websites for Northwest Flying, Excellent Adventures and Schowalters. Anybody ever done a trip like this (if so, how was it), or do you know of any outfitter websites that I might investigate?I won't be pulling the trigger on anything soon, just gathering info. I need another excuse to daydream and not get any work done."

1455210,Ogoki,2012-06-28 05:19:00,291,"Ten Jorse , I have done numerous fly-in camp out trips and canoe trips . With the cost of fly-in going up so ,much I now find those trips being about 75 % as much as staying in a cabin . Most fly-in operators will charge you round trip each way . Then if you take a canoe or small boat ,there is a tie-on fee ,each way . The last trip my wife and I took this way was 55 miles in and 45 miles out . With the tie-on fee and taxes we were at $1966 . So in otherwords a $1000 each . Now on the otherhand the extra trip I did last spring with some frinds from church was a different story . The outfitter has two 14 ft Lunds ,already on the lake and he took in with us , two 8 hp Mercs . We took our own camping gear . That was $450 each plus tax . he even supplied us a Sat . phone . Very nice lake about 30 miles in . White River Air use to have a lake with a camping spot cleared and two boats already there . Take your own camping gear . Another thing I have done is fly-in in to moose camps ( not during moose season) and fish . Boats already there and we took our own gear . One place we went like this had a wood base the outfitter used for his tent for moose hunts . We just put our tent there and tied it down . Had fantastic fishing on that trip I might add. There are ways to get into great fishing if your friends do want to pay the $1000 plus for a fly-in with a cabin ."
