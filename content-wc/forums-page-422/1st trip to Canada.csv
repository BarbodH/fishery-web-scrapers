1454770,IndyTgrFan,2012-06-27 08:37:00,6,"I've looked through many threads on here and want to thank everyone for always being so generous with your advice and experience. I'm going to Esnagami Lodge starting on the 7th and leaving on the 12th. I am with 2 of my sons, ages 13 and 10. We aren't what you'd call avid fishermen but we are very outdoorsy (never car camp, only backpack camp...et). Ok, to the questions: How quickly will we get on the water the first day? (Fly from Nakina at 8:00 am.) Should I cook us a shorelunch that day or keep it simple with sandwhiches or something like that?Speaking of cooking the fish for shorelunch and dinner (they provide the cooking utensils) does anyone have suggestions on preparations methods that they've really enjoyed? Filet the fish for shorelunch?Special recipe for the batter/breading?With a place like Esnagami will i need to bring my own skillet for nights and mornings or will their gear be adequate?Recommended food packing list for Dad and 2 boys to cook for 4 days?Do you tip your fishing guide at the end of the day (if i'm only using him one day)?Do you tip the fish cleaning guys (assuming they clean our fish when we bring them back to camp)?Any other insights anyone has?Thanks in advance ... really looking forward to it...except for the 18 hour drive. ;-)"

By the time you fly in, get unloaded, geared up etc, the last thing you want to worry about is packing shore lunch stuff. That's just me though. For shore lunch, I'd recommend taking a plastic tote with you. Make a list of everything you want in the tote before you go and put it in a plastic sleeve of some sort. Use this to make sure you dont' forget something. Before we did this there were times we forgot tongs, batter etc. We fillet the fish, cut them into strips and batter them up to fry. We use Zatarains SEASONED Fish Fri. They make a ton of different kinds...southern etc. ONLY THE SEASONED is good. We have tried many others and this far and away is the winner by everyone each time we try something new. Cut them into strips, fry them and then place in a tortilla for a taco. Take some shredded lettuce and onions maybe pre cooked bacon crumbles. Add any sort of sauce from tartar to ranch to wing sauce. REally good fish tacos and simple. Our tote has things like paper boats/plates, napkins, garbage bag, ziplock bags (used to mix batter etc), tongs, thermometer for oil, oil, lighter, batter, paper towels, foil pans for things like beans, can opener, plastic silverware. If you are cooking on a fire the turkey fryer thermometer is awesome. Otherwise you can easily lose many fish if oil is too hot or too cold. Not sure on the packing list but prepare a list and make sure you take everything on it. Nothing worse than getting up there and one main ingredient for a meal is missing.Another easy but really good meal for night is cajun seafood/walleye pasta. Take a jar of alfredo sauce, linguini and then some small shrimp, scallops and then add a bunch of chunked up walleye. Add a jar fo cajun seasoning the the sauce and serve with garlic bread. I would tip anybody who provides an extra service."

SinOrSwim is right on the money with his recommendations, his Walleye Tacos are the best! Boys that age like to have candy in the boat, bring some treats to snack on. As far as your food list, pm me, and I would be more than happy to help you with that."

1455107,Rich B,2012-06-27 19:18:00,1081,"don't forget to get your camera out early and often.....you are making life time memories for your boys as well as yourself, and you'll do everyone a favor by having your camera handy in the boat and cabin. Have had many ""up north"" trips with my family and son, and wish I had taken a few more photos....too busy having a good time and catching fish, laughing, etc. Lastly, when you get back be sure to write up a report for us ! I'm sure you and your boys are counting down the days.....not very long until you're northbound ! Drive safe and have a great time ! Rich B"
