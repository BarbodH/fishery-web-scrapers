1455962,Ogoki,2012-06-30 06:36:00,291,"10HP Johnson you are ornery . Have been on 35 fly-ins to date . BY FAR my best trips are with my wife . She loves it as much as I do . She never ever fished one time before we married 24 years ago . We are going up later this summer and when we get back I will be going back up with some guys from church . Not really thinking about that trip , mainly the trip with my wife . We are even planning a trip already for next June . 5 days at one lake and move to another lake for another 5 . We have done that several times and that is a great trip . We love Ogoki Res and since Don Elliot bought Whiteclay ( been there six times) c, we get to go to our two favorite lakes in one trip ."

My wife doesn't fish, but she will go out with me for limited fishing, mostly some trolling I'm guessing! I have wanted to share with her the beauty and solitude of Canada for years! If any one else will be at Goose Bay that week, some days I will have an open seat, especially the morning hours!! It will be a slightly different trip next year, maybe not as many hours on the Lac, or as much beer consumed!? I know we will be able to sit on the deck and share in listening to the silence and watching the clouds drift by!"
1455760,NathanH,2012-06-29 12:30:00,697,Great news. Went to Goose Bay for my first trip I was 15 and that was 16 years ago. Great place solid fishing. My dad is still wearing his Goose bay hat bought on that trip.
1455766,rather-be-fishin,2012-06-29 12:37:00,429,"Glad to hear that your wife will join you. My son brought his girlfriend with who is now his wife years ago and he was worried about her not liking it. She told me, well if I don't like the fishing, then I will just go into town shopping!!! LOL I told her ummm, I don't think so, because the town of Ear Falls has very limited shopping! Well, after her first year fishing on Lac Seul and catching all of those AWESOME walleyes she absolutely LOVES TO GO and can't wait for each years trip! It was sooo fun watching her in their boat jumping up and down and clapping her hands when she was catching all the fish and a 28"" whopper to boot! Who knows, maybe your wife will fall in love with fishing in Canada too! It just doesn't compare to any fishing in MN that's for sure! So HAPPY that you will be able to continue your tradition of fishing Lac Seul!"

1455802,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-29 13:54:00,1460,And not 700 days! Big congrats! I bet your wife catches the Canadian fishing fever bug like we have and will be a blast to have in the boat. My experience is your marriage will only get stronger. or not
1455815,Pooch,2012-06-29 14:21:00,4619,"Dave,You will like fishing with your wife! We are in camp right now and she lets me fish anywhere I want. She reads most of the time which is good as she out fishes me whenever she does actually fish!Pooch"
1455818,mb386,2012-06-29 14:29:00,14,Congrats. Sounds like a great time.
1455836,Golden Eagle,2012-06-29 15:39:00,2642,"My wife and I fished Little Vermilion Lake September 24, 2011 - October 4, 2011. Heading back for the August 11, 2012 week and might extend if the conditions are right. Seven days won't cut it sometimes.Our first fishing trip together was in 1960 and we stayed 49 days. ...and 49 nights. all but 2 on the ground."
1455915,wallydave,2012-06-29 20:25:00,2151,"Pike you know me too well!? I was tempted to start the 2013 countdown, but _I'll wait until the start of hard water season. We have traveled quite a bit and been through a lot together. This will be another adventure to share. Thanks for all the replies!!"
