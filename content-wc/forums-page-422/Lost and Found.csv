1455032,bricken,2012-06-27 16:15:00,14,3 yrs ago my buddy lost his new high end rod and real due to a snag. pulled it right out of the rod holder. 2 days later trolling the same spot I hooked it and got it back for him. All on the same trip up north. How lucky is that?
1455033,bigwalleye1,2012-06-27 16:16:00,2632,Found a dead moose on the western point across from the Deception light on Lac Seul last year. About 20 years ago found a dead body in the river downstream from Kings Cove Marina on the Mississippi. Haven't been fishing in the river since.
1455059,v-bay gord,2012-06-27 17:09:00,3168,Many years ago after a big storm while searching for some missing boaters came across an old style flotation seat cushion bobbing perpendicular with something attatched. You guessed it.....pulled up the end and it was tied to the wrist of a fellow who drowned.

1454862,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-27 11:17:00,235,"A little girls dress in the Fox River, suburban Chicago. Very creepy. Was in a fishing club with a guy who snagged a dead horse in the Kankakee River (obviously didn't reel it in, though...he was wading and walked over to get a snag out and discovered it). Have snagged several lines with lures on them, too, as most fisherman have at some point."
1454871,TIGHTLINER,2012-06-27 11:26:00,223,I SNAGGED A FISHING ROD AND REEL ATTACHED TO A LINE HOWEVER COULD NOT GET THE LURE IT WAS SNAGGED ON TO COME UP. SNAGGED IT RIGHT THRU THE 4TH EYE ON THE POLE.
1454883,downriverbob,2012-06-27 12:04:00,880,"I lost a custom rod and Shimano Curado reel in LOTW when it slipped out of my hands while fishing in cold rainy weather. Dove in after it as it was falling out of my hands, had rain gear on and hat stayed on when I went into the water. Tried to snag it and searched with underwater camera never found it. BOB"
1454887,jas4412,2012-06-27 12:08:00,15,I snagged a net in Lac Seul in 2003. I still have it. A buddy snagged a spinner harness on the same day... he tied it on and caught several nice 'eyes with it.
1454938,Whopper,2012-06-27 14:04:00,340,"Just this year I purposely snagged up my boat partners rod and reel combo after it accidently went overboard, and it still had a large northern on the line. He was happy, I was mad that I lost the fish, note to self, never handle braid with bare hands"
1454975,hommer23,2012-06-27 14:50:00,523,Ice fishing in about 26 feet of water with a #5 jigging rapala tipped with a minnow head I felt a small bite and then nothing. I went back to jigging and it felt like the tail hook caught the line so I pulled the jig up and found a 7 inch leapord frog hooked in the mouth and the minnow head gone.
1454991,REG,2012-06-27 15:07:00,445,Found drifting? A dead moose was floating in the eddy at the bottom of the falls where we like to fish. Everyone was very careful not to snag that one with an errant cast..
1455004,Guest,2012-06-27 15:19:00,0,"Over the years I've snagged a lot of fishing equipment, rod and reels included. My best catch to date is a Heddon 6 1/2' glass spinning rod with a 300 Mitchell reel. Still got'm, still use'm- -jerr"
1455022,@Lunker,2012-06-27 15:49:00,835,"X2 on the dead moose. Found a bloated carcass floating in a small cove. Had been there quite some time; aside from the bloating, most of the hair was gone. Nothing chewed up on it. The head was also missing - had been cut off. Result of poaching, in my mind. The location is now and forever referred to as ""dead moose bay""."
