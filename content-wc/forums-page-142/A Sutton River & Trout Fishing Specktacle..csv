It'll probably be trouting at my cottage, but a French River muskie hunt isn't out of the equation, I'm just sayin' ..... there's always room for a guy named Bunk"
6244568,Moosebunk,2018-09-13 21:56:00,211,"The famous Sutton River and its speckled trout fishing!!! Writing stories online now for more than 15 years, this is the one which should have been the first. Learning of this remote, northern Ontario river back in 2000 while living in nearby Attawapiskat, since then it has been the longest standing fishing trip on my bucketlist. Flying in August to our starting point at Hawley Lake, my good friend Mike and I camped and paddled our way out along the Sutton to Polar Bear Provincial Park and finally, Hudson Bay. An experience completely out of this world, for 130 kilometers over 12 days, hundreds and hundreds of speckled trout were caught on lures and flies. Fishing the Sutton is truly unimaginable, just a very special waterway choked with trout for it's entire length. If you are ever going to take a journey with me or maybe plan to one day travel to the Sutton yourself, this is a story you should read. Full, picture loaded report at the link below. So get in the canoe and trust me. http://bunksoutdoorangle.com/a-sutto...ng-specktacle/ Thanks for reading, Bunk."
