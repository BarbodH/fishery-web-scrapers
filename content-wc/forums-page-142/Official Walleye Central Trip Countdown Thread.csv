That is unless all the stars align and allow me to make a long weekend trip before then once the weather breaks....1st picture is how we left it last fall.... Not enough hours in a day.....2nd picture is my view that I wake up to every morning.

In 187 days we head for northern Minnesota for our first leg of the trip to Red Wing Lodge on LOW Breezy Point Frank and Christi will have dinner ready for us, the next morning we head North to LOW for a week of fishing!"
5922218,BornToFish,2018-01-01 08:32:00,1224,"Greetings,Most years, my desire to fish hits a low during hunting seasons and the Holidays. The ""itch"" to resume fishing typically returns shortly after the Holidays are over. So, thanks for starting the official ""count down"" thread for 2018. I'm itching all over!I will be leaving with a group of friends in about seventy two days for trip number one - lake trout fishing through the ice on Thunder Bay. My next trip is in about one hundred and twenty days - pike fishing near Red Lake just after ice-out. The wife and I have several trips scheduled in NW Ontario for walleyes about every thirty days or so after the post ice-out trip.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5922226,Bstar,2018-01-01 08:36:00,564,Since this is the Official trip countdown thread we have 240 days until we leave for Melchett Lake with Boreal Forest Outfitters. Thanks to Onetimedave for a wealth of info on Melchett!

5926042,Bstar,2018-01-03 06:21:00,564,Good idea. You can also download a free app like Dreamdays and add the info and everytime you open the app it shows the countdown in days or months and days. See photos
5926114,bigwalleye1,2018-01-03 06:57:00,2632,"161 and 190 respectively for me. Our lodge gives their business card with your arrival and departure dates, deposit info, etc, on the back. When I'm having a bad day, I take those cards out and turn them over...makes me smile just thinkin' about it!!!"
5926210,Baseline,2018-01-03 07:22:00,3207,"6 days for a lake trout trip to my favorite lake 40 miles north of I-Falls. Been 40 below up there for the past week. Luckily we will be having a warming trend, but it will be still cold."
