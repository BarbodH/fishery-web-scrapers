Caught all sizes of walleye. Caught 4 27 inchers. No muskie but only fished them for an hour. As wind went up and temps down the fish that would bite were small ones. Saturday night we got measurable snow. I love fishing LOTW but she can get downright nasty in my 17 foot tiller boat when the winds are 30 kph with higher gusts. Used my bow mount electric in conjunction with 8 HP tiller to try to cover the spots. We jigged, rigged, and trolled cranks. Went all the way west to Ogema and Cul du Sac. Some walleye action over there but fishing was better in the barrier island area."

6248534,Eyetimes,2018-09-24 19:02:00,193,Snow already!!! That just depressing. Iâ€™m headed to LOTW the last weekend in October. If this weather pattern continues I might be ice fishing. What was the water temp?
