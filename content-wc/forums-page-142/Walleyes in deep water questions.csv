6240280,prov1800,2018-09-02 08:17:00,5010,I have touched on this subject a number of times over the years when walleye start going deep and usually get the same responses from guys that are experts on the subject.lol.with todays technology and bigger boats and more late season fishing I can see fishing becoming worse and worse as iam already seeing it.all the conservation that is being done can go down the drain in a hurry in the deep water season.not much I can do about when a lot of fisherman just rather catch more of those easy to catch deep fish which are normally mostly smaller to begin with rather than trying to find the shallow bigger fish.they are not hard to find especially with todays electronics.not all fish are deep.i happened to be on lac suel and showed 6 guys I guided shallower fish and weed beds and they had a fantastic week.never going much deeper than 20 ft and catching a respectifull amount in 10 ft.
6240284,kzoofisher,2018-09-02 08:32:00,5144,"This is in Canada last week. Yes, we saw fish deeper than 20' but why bother? Biggest walleye of the trip was 27"" and that's on a lake not known for really big fish. Most were 15""-22"", fat enough that two in the 15-18 slot made a meal, we had a seven man fish fry with sixteen fish and struggled to finish them."
6240332,kzoofisher,2018-09-02 10:51:00,5144,"I think the third link in my previous post is the study you are taking about. As you say, survival is good with rapid descent releases. The study does add the caveat that it is unknown if there is other damage to the fish the may affect reproduction or other fish welfare concerns. I highlighted some important takeaways from the body and conclusion.Thus, we attempted to live release 11 of 14 untreated fish, 12 of 15 vented fish, and 13 of 15 fin-weighted fish in the marina area after our assessment period. All of the released fish appeared to swim away normally (maintained orientation, submerged) and would likely have been considered successful releases by anglers. However, after release, we found 4 (36%) of 11 untreated fish, 5 (38%) of 13 fin-weighted fish, and 1 (8%) of 12 vented fish floating on the lake surface; we had to retrieve and euthanize them (failed release; Table 1). Detailed scoring and fish fate details are available in Table S1. Ultimately, after our ex situ experiment, 7 (50%) of 14 untreated fish, 7 (47%) of 15 fin-weighted fish, and 4 (27%) of 15 vented fish were not in suitable condition for live release.Management Implications The findings from our study have both fish welfare and fisheries management implications. Although based on a CFE, these concepts extend to general recreational angling for Walleye as well. The only way to fully prevent damage from barotrauma in Walleye or similar species (e.g., Sauger Sander canadensis) is to restrict deep-water fishing. In the absence of such restrictions, our study yields several important summary points. First, without treatment, a high proportion of Walleye with moderate-to-severe barotrauma will not be able to maintain orientation or stay submerged after release and are highly likely to die without aid. From both welfare and management perspectives, Walleye barotrauma symptoms need to be relieved somehow to enhance survival after CAR. Second, although fin weights are popular at CFEs in Canada, our results indicate they are not an effective means of treating barotrauma. Keeping fish upright in livewells while they wait for additional barotrauma aid may be desirable (fin weights plus descending or venting), but this remains to be specifically tested. Third, venting Walleye causes short-term behavioral changes that are likely related to the purposeful perforation of the swim bladder, which compromises buoyancy regulation. If venting is done properly, these effects may be short term and limited to negative impacts on fish welfare rather than survival. Fish welfare concerns are becoming more prominent for CAR angling and are an important consideration when evaluating techniques (Cooke and Schramm 2007; Muir et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2017). Finally, recompression of fish via descending does not appear to affect fish behavior or habitat use compared to controls, and it does not require an additional wound that compromises buoyancy regulation. Thus, descend- ing achieves the dual goals of enhancing CAR success for fisheries management, and minimizing negative impacts on fish welfare. Our study is the first that we are aware of to examine multiple barotrauma relief approaches in Walleye, and one of few to do so for a recreational freshwater species (Eberts and Somers 2017). Based on the current state of knowledge, we recommend 1) deep-water fishing for Walleye is avoided at CFEs or under any other circumstances where large numbers of fish may experi- ence barotrauma and 2) the use of descending over venting for Walleye barotrauma relief when deep-water fishing cannot be regulated. However, we strongly encourage additional research in this area to ensure that the best possible approaches are used to promote long-term survival."
6240458,phishfearme,2018-09-02 19:23:00,1242,"kzoofisher - thanks for the study references - I think this entire issue is summarized in the Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management article: ""Eliminating catch-and-release angling in deep water is the best means of managing barotrauma in Walleye."" unless you are going to keep what you catch from deep water, these are words we should all fish by. phish"
6246708,Pink Unicorn,2018-09-19 18:04:00,83,"30' is my max. I accidentally pulled out a 25"" walleye in 40-50' jigging for lake trout last year. It's eyes were popped out and it's stomach was in it's mouth. Sadly put that one on the stringer. The camp owner suggested 30' as the line and I haven't seen any issues like above at that depth. 27' seems to me the magic number for me anyway!"
6246720,DanL,2018-09-19 18:36:00,262,"I rarely fish deeper than 30 feet. I was up at Lake Of the Woods in the Kenora area last week. We struggled to catch fish above 15 inches in 30 feet of water and less. Guys were saying the fish were in 40 - 50 feet of water. After poor results we fished in 40 feet of water. We caught a 24 "" walleye and released it . About 20 minutes later the fish was floating and still alive. We ended up keeping the fish and fishing shallower after that. One thing I noticed was that the bigger fish seem more stressed by the deeper water. That was just my observation during that short time fishing deep last week."
6246826,wooglin,2018-09-20 07:21:00,371,"Many of the walleye we targeted this past week at Woman River Camp, were 25-40 feet. Simply, the fish were not shallow. And we never saw a floater all week after we released them. Also, a few things I've never experienced, this year at WRC: I was jigging for Lakers in 65 FOW, and I caught a walleye. The strangest thing (to me), he released and darted right back towards the bottom. My boat-mate and I were trolling 80 FOW for Lakers. He had a 22"" walleye hit his spoon, I'm guessing around 65-70 FOW. That fish also darted right back down towards the bottom. Did they live? I have no idea. BUT, what I do know is they are deep, they go deep, and they eat deep. Check out these pics - it shows suspended fish in that 40 FOW mark, our group guesses that these are likely suspended walleye, pike and the occasional laker, feeding on the schools of fish below. We did troll over these batches with deep running cranks, and did catch big pike and some nice walleye, so it seems to make sense. The second pic is the walleye caught trolling for Lakers. Check out how red its head and gill plates are. This is similar to a big pike we hammered, trolling deep waters. The pike was really read in color. We struggled to get her back down as her swim bladder was full of air. We manually burped her a little bit, but she couldn't get down. So, we took a knife and put a small cut in her underbelly and let the air out - as soon as we did that, flew down to the bottom. Anyway, interesting to say the least!"
6247482,Pink Unicorn,2018-09-21 15:14:00,83,"Easy there Wild Bill... The difference between us is that I don't intentionally target fish in water deeper than they can survive the release. After 26 years of Canadian fishing, I've never had to stab a fish to release it. Things do happen, it's the nature of sport fishing. If you think you're not killing 25% or more of the walleye/pike you pull up from 40', you're wrong."
6247494,prov1800,2018-09-21 15:32:00,5010,definatly don't need to many guys with attitudes like that fishing in Canada.we all try up here to help out the conservation efforts.vuys that fish just don't know how to fish shallower.those deep fish are easy targets to those kinds fisherman in my book.usually smaller fish in those spots also and if a big one gets caught it's dead to.what a waste.we love our solid fishing in Canada don't need anybody coming up here to ruin it for us.
6247098,Pink Unicorn,2018-09-20 17:25:00,83,Check out this blog which addresses the subject;http://wrightscamp.blogspot.com/Perhaps inserting knives into fish to allow their swim bladders to empty isn't the most responsible practice.
6247104,WallyWarrior,2018-09-20 17:38:00,2488,I always stab mine in the head and they go right back to the bottom. Haven't seen one come back up yet. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
6247260,wooglin,2018-09-21 07:11:00,371,"Valid statement. But I can say for certain, before we did it, it was floating belly up and it would have been eagle food. Don't get so butt-hurt. It's fishing. With really large hooks, that sometimes get the fish in the eye, and sometimes when they thrash hard, they tear their own jaws apart. We are humans, top of the food chain. We fish. We catch them, put them in livewells, starve them of oxygen and the cut them apart to eat them. So please, spare me the 'don't hurt the fish' lecture."
6239294,Oldicecoach,2018-08-30 05:05:00,15,Is there a depth you won't target walleyes because of survival concerns? Any links to scientific articles detailing survival of walleyes caught in deeper water?

6239328,BornToFish,2018-08-30 06:35:00,1224,"Greetings,The question posed in the original post is interesting. This question has been bantered many times on this forum and is likely to garner a fair number of responses. The article in the second post is the first published article that I have seen. It's nice to have data rather than listen to opinions. A thought came to mind when I read the article. It mentioned that the angler catching the fish from deep water summoned a chase boat to take the fish to a holding pen. I surmise that the fish was somehow tagged and then placed in the holding pen, where it was monitored for a period of time to assess mortality.I assume that it took at least several minutes from the time that the fish was caught until it was placed in the holding pen. I suspect that this delay time, under the conditions for the surface of the lake rather than at depth, very likely also contributed to fish mortality. Presumably, the mortality associated with this ""delay time"" stress is unknown. The authors of the article hinted at this phenomenon in the last sentence of the article.I fish as deep as I need to when fishing in order to catch fish, and no deeper. I use relatively light power fishing rods, such that I am slowly bringing the fish to the boat. The fish are promptly returned to the lake. I am very confident that the mortality rates associated with my practices are nowhere near that reported in the referenced article.Again, it was nice to see data for the first time!Kindest regards...."
6239338,phishfearme,2018-08-30 06:48:00,1242,"this issue has arisen numerous times in WC - search ""fizzing"" on this board for some reading material. for us - going deeper than 20-25 ft is out of bounds. some guys will say there's no problems with taking fish deeper than that (even when the swim bladder is sticking out of the mouth) stating ""we never see any floating belly up"" but the problem is something biologist call ""delayed mortality"" where the fish die many days later and also the fact that they will only float to the surface if bacterial decomposition starts and given the cold water at depth they simply sink to the bottom and stay there. (remember, lake superior is frequently called ""the lake that doesn't give up her dead"" - since bacterial decomposition is almost non-existent in it's cold waters.) bottom line for us - don't fish deep (20-25ft) unless you plan to keep what you catch. if you are strictly catch and release, stick to much shallower than that. phish"
6239346,phishfearme,2018-08-30 07:19:00,1242,"BtF - you make numerous good points - this study has all kinds of issues with it and I would hardly call it ""scientific data"" - it sounds like something a bunch of guys would get together and do on weekends. real data on this subject is practically non-existent due to the large number of significant variables involved including how long it took you to reel in the fish (as you mentioned), surface water temp, time in boat removing hook and on and on. I seems to me after fishing Ontario and Quebec for decades that you don't really need to fish much deeper than 20-25ft - there's always been plenty of fish to target shallower. phish"
6239400,Oldicecoach,2018-08-30 09:06:00,15,"Hate Gophers, thanks for posting the link. Although there are a lot of variables that could be considered it does show a definite cause/effect relationship. Deeper the water, the higher the mortality rate. Could be a Sticky or subject that should be brought up every July 1 for newbies or novice fisher people that are not searching the topic. An easy read. Phish, always enjoy your generous trip reviews and unvarnished opinions. Two years ago we had our best trip to Canada based on one of your reviews. Thank You."
6239796,stumcfar,2018-08-31 09:16:00,451,"On the Minnesota side of LOW, for the past month the majority of the fishing is being done in the mud flats 25'-35' deep. Lots and lots of fish 25""-30"" caught and released. It is concerning what the long term effects of this kind of fishing will have for the future of the lake. Not sure how you could ever regulate it even if it is very bad for the lake."
6239804,BreezyPoint,2018-08-31 09:20:00,1581,"I never fish over 25 feet. That's my limit. I believe right now the MN DNR is doing another study on this topic. It will be interesting to see the results.Fish do get the bends as well.That being said, some fish have special adaptations to allow them to change depths quickly. Lake trout have a specially vent bladder. Curiously, northern pike also have a somewhat vented bladder (not as extensively vented as lake trout). On the other hand, muskies do not. These adaptations help reduce mortality when these fish are brought up from deeper water. This might actually be a species specific question.I catch plenty of fish and do not need to increase the chances of mortality or increase my catch by fishing deep, especially in Canada.Frank"
6240122,kzoofisher,2018-09-01 13:40:00,5144,"Barotrauma studies on walleye are hard to find. We do know that there are two methods fish use to adjust pressure in their swim bladders: some have a connection from the bladder to the digestive track and can *burp* gas (physostomes), some have a gland that uses lactic acid to transfer oxygen back and forth between the bladder and the blood stream (physoclists). This second group requires much more time to adjust and reach neutral buoyancy. In the second link you will see that some of the walleye that experienced the 15' pressure change for testing did not achieve neutral buoyancy in 24 hours. This was a move to higher pressure before simulating a rapid pressure drop. I doubt that anyone bringing a fish up from 30'+ is going to do it slowly enough to prevent issues. Heck, those of us bringing fish up from 20' might be doing a lot more damage than we realize. The first link involves smallmouth which are also physoclists. The third is a study on treatments for walleye with barotrauma.http://fishlab.nres.illinois.edu/Rep...sey%202005.pdfhttps://www.pnnl.gov/main/publicatio...PNNL-24720.pdfhttp://fwspubs.org/doi/pdf/10.3996/112017-JFWM-096"
