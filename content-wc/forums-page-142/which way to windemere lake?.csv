I have been north on trans/Canada hwy past wawa to nakina and Armstrong in the past and to wabatongushi lake on 519. but never on 129 out of the sault. I will be hauling a 24' camper with my f-150 and need some help on which way is better. thanks for any help. pinenut"
6245898,MrSimon,2018-09-17 14:41:00,922,"Go to Google Maps and look at the Street View. You can see actual photos of the roads themselves - just like you were there. 129 is pretty remote. It's paved, but narrow with gravel shoulders. 101 is better, but not by an overly wide margin. I've always taken 17 to Wawa and then East on 101. I just love the drive up Superior!"
6245924,papadave,2018-09-17 15:27:00,151,I made my first trip there this past summer towing a boat. I was advised by Sondra against using 125 if I'm towing. We were glad we went 101 out of Wawa because it is a reasonably flat scenic road with practically no traffic. Plus coming up Hwy 17 was a very easy drive. Plus you are probably going to want to gas-up in Wawa before and after the lake.

6246050,Rich B,2018-09-17 21:01:00,1081,"X 4 on the 101 out of Wawa. Pulled my rig up the 129 and was dodging huge potholes and missing sections of the roadway once I got about half way to Chapleau. Needless to say, drove back to the Soo via the 101. Have fished Windemere over the years a number of times, and it is a beautiful lake. Do yourself a favor and at least one day fish the big bay by their Outpost cabin. The lake has good fishing for larger fish (thanks to Bob and Sondra's slot requirements). Safe travels...."
6246060,Overwatchmike,2018-09-17 22:43:00,201,X5 on 17 to 101! The drive along Superior is some of the most scenic you will come across! In Wawa make sure to stop at Youngs and get some of their summer sausage!2 years ago I had to take a 7 hour detour when 17 washed out north of Pancake bay. I made it to 129 and it was white knuckle hauling a big flat bed with quads....Sent from my SM-G955U using Tapatalk
