6247500,Riverkeg,2018-09-21 15:49:00,134,Wishing I was fishing there too! Our trip there is always spring. Next spring will be the week after the opener. I’m sure there’s better lakes but we love it and the folks at Clark’s. Couldn’t get on crappie this year but we slayed them last year. Good luck and have fun!

6246436,prov1800,2018-09-18 18:07:00,5010,Great day on Cedar Lake today out of Clarkes Northern Lights Resort.Could not have asked for a nicer fall day.Cool start so I went a little later but was peeling clothes of pretty quick as the day went on.Mainly went for muskie as I needed a casting fix having done a lot of walleye fishing lately.Muskies did not cooperate.to clear out and maybe to calm.Walleye fishing though was fantastic.Some of the muskie spots I fished had loads of walleyes of the rock piles and will try those spots tomorrow as iam headed to the east end of the lake for crappies.water temps today climbed a bit from last week at 66 f.Walleyes all over the depths fairly shallow to 30 ft.Tried my best with the selfie .
