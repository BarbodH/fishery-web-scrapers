6246392,fishron,2018-09-18 16:09:00,317,"We fished Crotch Lake for the first time in early May, 2017. The lake was way up and logs and wood were floating everywhere. It may have put the fish off their usual patterns but being our first trip to the lake it didn't matter. Crotch is a beautiful lake with many bays and islands. The bays in the lower portion produced the best for us. The walleye we caught were mostly keeper size and although we never got into a concentration of fish we managed to get enough to fill our limits. The opening of the bass season was weeks away but we couldn't keep them off our lines. In one small cove I had the fastest bass fishing in all my years. Almost every cast produced a smallmouth or largemouth of good size. They weren't on the beds yet and I have no idea why that cove came alive that afternoon. The pike we caught were not of any size, but we didn't target them. We fished out of Land o Lakes lodge and really liked the operation."
6247142,brutus99,2018-09-20 19:42:00,7,How as the fishing been at Bennett Lake this summer 2018. Is anybody catching walleye that are keepers. Have the bass been bitting.
2887993,Guest,2014-06-11 10:59:00,0,We have been fishing Crotch Lake for 13 years. We stay at Land o Lakes Lodge and are well cared for. The food and lodging are excellent ! As for the fishing......We have always caught fish. This year was the best ever with over 400 total fish caught. Anyone that says that Crotch is fished out doesn't know what they are talking about. We will be back next year.
2888665,MrSimon,2014-06-11 14:48:00,922,"It is certainly one of the most beautiful lakes I've been to, and we also enjoyed our stay at Land O Lakes. What's the breakdown on species of your 400 fish? Were most of them smallies? That lake is a killer smallmouth lake!"
3733386,Guest,2015-04-05 19:57:00,0,"My family has been fishing at Crotch Lake for over 27 years, usually in June or July. Bass season starts about the third week of June. We stay at Tumblehome Lodge. Ward's family has been always been wonderful. The fishing has always been good if you know where to fish. We have caught Walleye, pike, bass, channel catfish, and all types of panfish. We always go home with a nice bunch of fish. This is one vacation that my whole family(usually at least 12 of us) never misses each year!"
3894577,ShaneOO19,2015-05-21 21:31:00,1,"Hello, I am the same poster from a couple years ago who was looking to find information on Morrows Cottages on Crotch Lake. Just a phone number to contact the owners who currently run the place would be amazing. I went there as a child with my grandfather and it is/was a very special place to me. My grandfather and his father were two of the first people to stay there. If no cabins are available I would be happy to just be able to launch a boat and go camp out from there. Again any info would be great. Thanks"
3896617,worthsr,2015-05-22 13:43:00,52,It just seems like a small percentage of guys are way better off in the Crotch then everybody else.
4893025,Guest,2016-06-02 13:10:00,0,"I just came across this threat and was shocked how many people have had such bad luck at this lake. I have been going to Crotch and staying at Morrow's Cabins for 3 years now. The group I go up with have gone for the past 16 years I think. I am not a super good fisherman. I do ok at best. Crotch lake has make me feel every year I have gone like I am a pro! We are not catching monsters, but we are catching respectable sized walleye, pike, and largemouth. Morrows cabins sit right between Crotch and Kings lakes. We fish the Crotch for walleye, pike, and bass. We fish bluegill, perch, and smallies in Kings lake. We all have a great time and enjoy the time fishing."
4893961,fishron,2016-06-02 18:06:00,317,I'm glad to hear your positive comments on Crotch Lake. I'm planning on doing a trip there next year. The deal that's offered at Land O Lakes lodge is unbeatable and it's ten hours from SE PA so I will take my own boat. From what I have discovered about the lake it seems the experience will be much like the solitude found much further north. Thanks for your report.
6245544,brutus99,2018-09-16 18:28:00,7,Any fish Crotch Lake this year and how did you. What did they bit on.
6245678,Ernest T. Bass,2018-09-17 08:10:00,1,"My buddies and I,""The Stuart Plate Fishing Tour"" are heading up to Tumblehome Lodge this weekend. Sept. 21-23. We had okay luck last year despite a motor failure early in the day.(Thank God and Minn Kota for trolling motors! My partner and I caught Largies while other boys were tagging some Smallies. You have to do your homework on this lake as we found out and I've been burning the midnight oil in hopes of doing better this year. If you see us on the water or at the lodge,drop by and say hello. Most of us will have our ""STUART PLATE"" Shirts on. Tight Lines Kiddies!! ""SENIOR!"""
6245936,papadave,2018-09-17 16:05:00,151,"I fished Crotch for several years from about 2000 to 2016. I did really well on eater walleye and caught lots big smallmouth up to 20"" but that all changed in 2016. The Ministry upped the walleye slot size in that zone and a lot of locals that really know this lake came charging back and just creamed the larger slot walleye that were previously protected. My friends that still go there said it is very hard to catch a decent walleye now just like it was back in the 90's."
1323406,griff,2011-06-27 20:06:00,40,Any updates?...I know a group of twelve going up later htis summer for some fast action.
1329900,MrSimon,2011-07-14 14:12:00,922,"Me and five buddies fished Crotch Lake in May of 2010. We went to the lake looking for pike and were sorely disappointed. We caught six small ones in three full days of fishing. We couldn't find any weed beds and the bays had no weed growth. We never targeted walleye, but accidentally caught two nice ones. One nice older fellow we met was up there for two straight weeks fishing for walleye. He was getting about 4 to 6 per day. HOWEVER, the smallie fishing was fantastic. The lake is full of perfect smallie habitat. If you want an absolutely beautiful lake that is filled with smallies, this is your place."
1462244,Guest,2012-07-16 15:18:00,0,I use to go to Morrow's cottages between Crotch lake and Kings lake with my grandfather before he passed away. Due to a family dispute the time he had reserved there every year was lost and there is now a very long waiting list to ever go back. If anyone here has time available at this place that they would no longer like to use I would very much be interested. This place has a lot of sentimental value to. Thanks
1466194,packpro,2012-07-25 14:48:00,695,"You want to go deep in the Crotch. Doesn't hurt to scratch the bottom while there. Don't set the hooks fiercely. You don't want to damage the structure of the Crotch. Cover the area thoroughly, and it doesn't hurt to use an attractant. Stink bait is not the way to go with the Crotch, and heaven forbid if their is a mayfly hatch in the Crotch."
1466368,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-25 22:07:00,235,"I see you don't like when others come up and work over your Crotch. For me, it would depend on who and how sensitive they are to the Crotch.In general, though, from people's comments, it seems you need to get deep into the Crotch to really get to know it (every nook and cranny, every time of day). If you work the Crotch intensely, you definitely might catch something...perhaps something you might regret. MNR reports suggest that it's not uncommon to see beaver in the Crotch. Aint nothin' better than that."

1484285,Guest,2012-09-07 17:00:00,0,"Call Donna or Dennis Morrow at Carvin (near Peterborough). If you can't get their number, call Wm Sargent at Pleva and ask Delmar for it. Donna & Dennis are the proprietors today. People are cancelling because the rates have gone up to more realistic levels. And, of course, after 80 years, people are dying off and their heirs don't want the time or can't get up there at that time of year. My Hubby has been going there since 1960 every year for at least a few days. I've been there every year since 1979. We just back and had a great week. Balmy weather even in the first week of September."
1847465,betweentolakes,2013-06-07 19:58:00,5,"crotch lake will not give up it's fish easily u have to work for them they wont come to you like other lakes, its a cold lake with areas that run deep i've worked this lake all my life and i will never be a expert but some places are better then others.slot limit sizes have changed this year on the lake 15.7"" to 19.7"" are the only keepable sizes if you's come up to the lake this year be sure to get a reg's book with your license they seem to be few this year though or go to mnr's fishing regs for ontario.any one wanting phone # or address for Dennis, Donna Morrow feel free to pm me as know them well."
1848057,Moosebunk,2013-06-08 06:40:00,211,"Grew up in the area.Little to no walleye in Crotch. Never heard anyone say anything decent about the fishing there, always just the same line, ""beautiful lake."""
1921178,Guest,2013-07-03 20:49:00,0,I am a novice fisherman. I have been to Crotch Lake twice and have caught multiple walleyes each time.
511488,Jig A Lowe,2001-03-16 07:58:00,87,"Has anyone ever fished Crotch Lake? If so, what has been your experience?? What time of year did you fish? What techniques were successful? How would you rate the quality of the fish??Thank you."
511489,Guest,2001-03-16 09:58:00,0,"Like the man that had a secret to tell, but no one to tell, I'll say this about Crotch Lake...""I'm glad you asked.""Beautiful scenery, picturesque shoreline, wonderful coves and pockets....NO FISH!!!! I've been going into Ontario and Quebec for 25+ years, travelling to new lakes every few years or so. Went up to Crotch Lake with 3 others in 1998, I can't recall the name of the camp, but I believe it's one of the only ones. The four of us are above average pike, walleye, and bass fisherman. The weeks total for 7 days of fishing 8+ hours per day: 2 walleye of 20"" size, 3 huge perch, 2 pike < 24"", 1 smallmouth bass of about 3 pounds. THAT'S IT !!!!! It was awful. It was one of those trips where you realize you've made a big mistake on about the third day. We went up in early-June, the fishing should have been prime, but is was non-existent. The weather was good and stable, so that wasn't the problem. I think the lake is fished-out, as someone suggested in the next town over, Sharbot Lake. I've talked to others that have been to the lake and the typical answer is that the lake is very up and down. Well, we obviously hit a down year. And I watch the chat boards and have yet to see anyone say they've been successful on Crotch. A few alternatives for you that were MUCH, MUCH more productive than Crotch are Lake Nosbonsing near Callander, Lake Wabitongushi near Wawa (north of the Soo), and Lake Ogascanane 100 miles NE of North Bay in Quebec. Now, aren't you glad you asked."
511490,Guest,2001-03-16 11:19:00,0,"I agree with the gentleman who has had the fishless experience at Crotch lake. I went there in 1999 with my wife for a week of fine Canadian walleye fishing. No question, the lake is picturesque, with beautiful rocky shorelines. Only thing wrong is the lack of fish. I think the geographic location has been a factor. Let's face it, the lake is fished out! Not only that, one of the guides at the lake spent the entire week trying to make a move on my wife. I ended up being so bummed out by the whole experience that I spent the last two days in the cabin drinking beer. Never again!"
511491,Guest,2001-03-19 07:18:00,0,"I went to Crotch lake about 12 years ago and the fishing was just as bad then, 2 guys, 4 days(we left early) 2-12"" smallmouths and we did better than any group we talked to at the lake that week."
1223062,Guest,2010-07-28 08:59:00,0,"This is an old thread, but it comes up on google searches... My first time on the Crotch was in 2007, November and I hit into 7 or 8 walleye in about 45 minutes ranging from 3-7.5 lbs. Since then, I have gone every year, but in the summer and have not had as much luck. Skunked as far as walleye the one year, and a couple last year. I think the hardest part about fishing the lake is the size, but once you've located the fish you can get them in bunches, going back again this year (2010) in August."
1223480,stumcfar,2010-07-29 14:27:00,451,Was the couple of fish last year considered one the bunches????
1225570,Guest,2010-08-06 13:07:00,0,"In King's Lake, below the King's Falls, you catch perch, northern (pike), the odd walleye and bass. A lot of bass. You can catch pickel, too, but they are not common. Crotch Lake doesn't yield many walleye, but it used to. My husband has been going to Crotch Lake for 50 years."
1226263,ek2008,2010-08-09 11:56:00,7,"I'm from the area and the lake, for lack of better wording...""is fished out""..mainly due to what I think is fairly heavy fishing pressure. The typical ""spots"" get visited regularly by lodge guests throughout the day/night. It is a fantastic lake to camp and relax at however I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone considering the lake to make a ""fishing holidy/trip"" out of. I camp at the lake 3-4 times a summer and if I catch some walleye it's a bonus only. The lake used to be full of panfish and pike (even some lake trout) before they started stocking it with walleye 20 yrs ago."
1226403,griff,2010-08-09 19:55:00,40,"I seem to recall a story about Crotch Lake...seems a while back a group of 30 or so sailors and there, uh, dates, took a two week fishing trip to Crotch Lake (back then, it was called Chastity Lake). They really slayed the walleye...left nothing but a bunch of crabs."
1271452,pdsmith,2011-02-15 11:38:00,1,"I have been going to crotch lake all my life. my grandfather started going there in the 60s with my father. In the 80s my father bought a place on crotch lake which we still have to this day. last summer i was only able to spend 5 days there. but still only fished 2 full days and every evening. we had success. my wife is a novice and she did well lots of bass and a few walleye. all together we caught 6 or more small mouth over 3 lbs. i think we caught 4 or 5 walleye that are in the slot limit and probably 7 keepers (14-18 inch). truth be told we fish more for bass. probably caught 50 small mouth total. the thing is like state before the lodges do put pressure on the lake, but its really not that bad. see a lot of people go the the same ""spots"". maybe its bc i've been on that lake so long i know the little nuances of it. This summer i will be spending 2 weeks or more there so i will get all over the lake and i am looking forward to it. the other thing is i have found that i do A LOT better with live bait. i know that most people do too. I have seen and heard ppl before say things like these about the lake and i love it hopefully people will stop coming there on the advice of people that probably havent done their homework about really where to fish on that lake. i talk to lots of people at the lodges there and its all word of mouth about spots to go and thats fine, but as we like to joke when we see a group of boats in the same location ""someone must have caught a fish there yesterday. get your topographical maps out and find the shoals the points that extend a ways out the drop offs the bays. also the water drops a lot during the season. it takes a lot to fish this lake well. so do ur homework b4 going."
