I stayed there last year at Pleasant Point Resort, but I actually never fished on Willard itself. I basically used the resort as my base of operations, since I wanted to portage my canoe into some of the smaller lakes in the area, and I was simply looking for a centralized place to sleep. I am returning to Pleasant Point for 3 days next summer, but I was thinking about actually fishing Willard Lake itself. The funny thing is that I don't see any reports here regarding Willard. Is it not a very good walleye lake, or does it get overshadowed by the other famous walleye lakes which are quite literally across the street? (Hawk, Dogtooth, and Kilvert) I would assume that since Willard is an oligotrophic / lake trout lake, that it would have a very high population of ciscoes, and would therefore be likely to have good trophy potential for suspended walleyes. Does anybody have any input / experience on Willard, who could point me in the right direction? Mostly interested in hearing about the quality of walleye and smallmouth fishing in Willard, but may also be interested in pursuing lakers and pike there as well if it's a decent fishery. Any input / reviews of Willard Lake would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
