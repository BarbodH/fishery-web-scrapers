6243628,camp chef,2018-09-11 12:19:00,915,A group of 10 of us are headed up this week to deliver the ashes of a dear friend and long time Canadian fishing buddy to one of his favorite fishing holes. He started going to this lake over 50 years ago. May the fishing gods grant us safe travels and allow us many laughs along with the tears.

Let them happen , as they will for sure. My best piece of advice is to take a few pictures of your friend with you on the trip to celebrate the memories of past fishing trips and his life . In June I took three pictures with me on my trip that included my grandfather, my dad and my son. Although my grandfather is no longer with us, he is the rascal that got this crazy fishing thing started in our family. It felt good to have 4 generations together even if it was only a picture of them from fishing trips past. I'm hopeful that someone will be willing to do the same thing for myself when it is my time. I'm not sure where the spot on a lake /river is quite yet, but it will be similar to your buddy's wishes. I hope you have a wonderful trip in honoring your friend. PjShorthorn"

He will be looking down and smiling knowing he has attained that rare find in life.........really true friends. Great job Chef, hope all goes as planned."

6244066,packpro,2018-09-12 17:29:00,695,"We did the same for the founder of our group three years ago. We think of him often as the we start planning the trip. Emotions are high when we go back to Canada, but the thousands of great memories bring a smile to everyone. I had the chance to fish with him on the last day of his last trip. His last fish was a 40"" northern. His ashes were spread on that spot. The last two years I caught a 40"" Northern on that exact spot. Had to sit down for a minute each time and process what had just happened. You are doing a great thing for your friend and as well as everyone in the group that knew him. Memorializing him in that way means you always get the chance to go back and visit him, even if it just interpersonal thoughts."

6246676,gullrockguy,2018-09-19 15:53:00,44,"i had a fishing partner who passed away a few years ago and his son took some of his ashes and put them in a jar and buried it on the shore next to one of his favourite fishing holes. as the son was bending over to tamp the ground he lost the sunglasses in his shirt pocket into the lake, as he was trying to retrieve his sunglasses he knocked over the bottle of whiskey he had taken to toast his dad with. and now when we fish that spot we try to catch either the sunglasses or the whiskey. (preferably the whiskey)"
6248312,camp chef,2018-09-24 09:18:00,915,It was a great trip. Very good fishing and very emotional.....Some of the things that happened can only be explained if you believe that the deceased are always with us. Our group of 10 caught approximately 60 Walleyes over 24 in.with the largest being 28. We also caught 7 lake tout between 31 and 34 inches. Leaving camp at 5 am on the way home one of the guys videoed a Bull moose plodding down the gravel road for a full 5 minutes before he found the trail he wanted to go down.
