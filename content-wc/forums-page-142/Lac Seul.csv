6241314,MorganMan,2018-09-05 09:46:00,341,"Thanks vaquero01, we have been there and will be again in about 10 days. Hoping for some good weather and conditions as we will have a few ladies in the group this year."
6242154,HitmanSB,2018-09-07 15:37:00,10,"We fished August 11-18, water temps were 71 surface with light to moderate winds. 2 boats and according to the clickers, boated 750 for 6 rods, which was a better catch than 2017. With the light winds and hot sun days, the boat that lindy rigs crawlers did better sitting on top of the 20-30 ft structures, but when overcast and bit of wind, they went fast and furious on 3/8 oz jigs with plastic and crawler or minnows. One cloudy day, my boat put 75 over the rail, but only 4 were under 18혬, which was a dinner planning problem, but sure fun day on the water. We stay at Fisherman's Cove, in the NW section. Boat traffic on the obvious reefs and points was far more than I would have liked, but lots of water, and I like the challenge of finding new structure. Northerns were very active, when boulders were below or with a hard bottom, near deep water. The pike like white and larger profile baits, my nephew fought an estimated 45혬 for 3 minutes on video, that broke our hearts when the 6# engulfed leader finally gave up. Already booked up for 2019, and only this week, is my thumb and finger tips have regrown skin, after a week of fish hands. I am thinking about an 2nd trip, for late May or June, and would like to try the shallow post spawn waters, in McKenzie Bay, I hear is very good too."
6243858,lazermule,2018-09-12 06:14:00,86,"Heading up to LS the last weekend of September. We'll be in the SE section through Deception Bay. Hoping for some good Walleye, Pike and Musky action! LM"
6250934,lazermule,2018-10-03 07:00:00,86,"Returned 10/1, didn't see the action we would have liked to. Our first day on the water was 9/28 and it started out as a nice day then we had some snow. Fishing was fair but the walleyes were deep (40 feet). The following days, the fishing deteriorated and so did the weather. Ended up fishing shallower anyway and picked up some decent smallies and pike. LM"
6238812,MorganMan,2018-08-28 21:45:00,341,I have read in a couple posts that the water level on Lac Seul is down about 3ft? Is that still accurate as we are about to the end of August? We head up in mid September and I am looking for any information you may think would be helpful to us?
6238846,Stringbean,2018-08-29 05:22:00,279,"Here is the latest data for entire Lake of the Woods watershed. Lac Seul is an integral part of that. For Lac Seul specifically, click on #2 https://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html. You can readily see that the inflow is increasing, so maybe a few downpours will bring the reservoir level up by September. Water levels across the entire region are down."
6238874,Pooch,2018-08-29 06:37:00,4618,"I just returned from the mid LS area four days ago. From past trips (same time of year) the lake is down approximately twenty inches. Maybe three foot low from high water marks, but not three foot low.I'm basing my observations on shoreline that is now exposed and shallows that were under ten inches of water are now sticking out of the water by a foot. Near our dock there was old stump exposed about size inches that I had never seen before. The day we left it was once again hidden. The wind had been blowing hard out of the north so water may have been stacking up in the south end of the lake and may account for the perceived water rise. There was no measurable rainfall while we we there last week.Heavy smoke in the air when we left camp early Friday morning. The hard north wind must have stirred fires in the mid NW area of the lake or a new fire was happening. Smoke smell during the night woke our cabin up and made for a poor nights sleep.Fishing was good for numbers, but average size was down. Larger fish were found in deep water, but ethics kept us from fishing for them. Deeper being forty to fifty foot of water. We also caught walleye in five foot of water throwing cranks for Smallmouth near weeds. With the lake water down there were some surprises as far as ""new"" shallows and weed beds where I've not seen them before. Kept the trip interesting and you had to travel with your eye on the depth finder every moment. The guy in the front of the boat has to keep his eyes open for rocks when traveling.Pooch"
6238952,MorganMan,2018-08-29 09:52:00,341,"Thanks for the information and reports, Stringbean and Pooch. Greatly appreciated!"
6238954,David Anderson,2018-08-29 09:57:00,2073,"Pooch, I agree with you, the same website in the above post has the data for Lac Seul, https://www.lwcb.ca/pdf/LacSeulGraph2018.08.28.pdf The average elevation for this time of year is about 1169.2 and the actual is about 1167.8, I would agree, about 16 to 20 inches. I will be making my 4th trip to Lac Seul in less than 3 weeks and quite honestly it doesn't seem to have much of an affect on things other than if I can get through the Rags or not. Most of the fish are 20 - 25 feet anyway and we easily avoid any marginal area's as it's the fall and the locations are different. I run HDS Carbons with the Navionics chip that has Lac Seul. I find it very interesting to be running along and look to the side and see a rock sticking up 6 inches from the surface. The map has a red X marking that spot and it would definitely be underwater if the lake at it's normal height. It certainly gives credence to accuracy of the hazard marks on the map, I know that all hazards are not marked and all marks are not hazards but it give one a pretty good feel for the map data."
6238984,Pooch,2018-08-29 11:23:00,4618,"Dave,I have a lot of Navionics hazards double marked. One is on the chip the other is a waypoint using a red X. Some of the Navionics hazard marks are ""area"" type of marks so I try to get a good accurate mark on the actual hazard itself. Many, many hazards are in what Navionics shows as deep water. To the trusting boat driver these could be serious grief. When we are traveling I have my front depth finder turned towards me so as I look forward I can read and see a depth change without looking down at the one by the tiller.There is an old buoy marker base (no marker buoy there anymore) that at normal pool only the re-bar shows above the water line and is all but invisible. Sometimes there is a jug on it and sometimes not. This one is a boat killer for someone not familiar with the area. This year the entire rock(s) are about a foot above water. It is located near Mahkwa, west of Windigo Island.Kind of a ""trust but verify"" deal on a different level using Navionics chip for sole navigation. Chip is accurate as far as islands and land masses, but depths are at best, ""kind of"" accurate. Far better than no chip and paper only maps.Pooch"
6239112,vaquero01,2018-08-29 16:13:00,101,"I am at Onaway Lodge near Ear Falls now. Been coming here for six years. Water is down at least 20혬, owner says 36혬. Definitely seeing things I have never seen before. Much cooler and wetter this week and predicted for next week. About 45 degrees yesterday morning. Way brisk. Lot of smoke from fires north and west. Burned islands in Steamboat and near South Inlet. Fish seem to be in places dictated by winds and structure. I know you and Sin have been up this way before. Good luck."
6239376,David Anderson,2018-08-30 08:26:00,2073,"I normally fish out of Chamberlain Narrows, boating in from Deception. Trust but verify is quite accurate as just south of Bear Narrows it shows a Shoal with an X but every time I go over it, i have yet to find anything shallower than 40 feet. Also north of the narrows and about 2 miles south of Pecker Point it will come up from 30 to 5 like instantly. Although I never hit bottom it gets more shallow to the east however there is no marking on the map for this. I tend to put a big skull and crossbones icon in those spots. I will say that the houseboat trails tend to be ok, but again low water levels can skew your readings quite a bit. Even though the depth are what I consider suggestions, white is usually pretty deep and the land/water accuracy is nice. 18 days and counting!"
6239382,milfish,2018-08-30 08:35:00,249,"David, I'm at 28 days and counting until my annual trip to Ojibwa Outfitters. You mention 2 miles south of Pecker Point. Is that the spot about 1/2 way between Toms Camp and Pecker Point adjacent to the small island to the East? I've never marked anything less than 8 feet there and just wondering if it is the same spot and if it is, is the 5' closer to the East or West? Sure might be a worrysome spot if the water is down 3'. Thanks, Milfish"
6239564,David Anderson,2018-08-30 15:39:00,2073,"Yes! if you stay more west it's ok. I can look at my GPS tonight and PM you the waypoint, just stay to the west of it and you'll be OK. I arrive on Sept. 17th and leave that Friday. I'll be happy to leave you a nice report!"
