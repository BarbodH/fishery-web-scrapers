Am I wrong on that?? If it was due to a draw down, the lake levels will be back to normal after repairs are completed. Given some time of course."
6248348,Trucky1008,2018-09-24 10:48:00,39,"My brother was on the English River in early Sept. and the water level was about 3-4' below what we experienced in June this year. No access to Clear, Johnson, or Unexpected. We've been going to that body of water for over 40 years and it's the lowest we've seen it before. He ended up hitting a rock that will result in a complete lower unit on his merc 350."
6248546,ia bhtr,2018-09-24 19:15:00,212,"Aspen , was my understanding from the lodge owner that it was a combination of powdery snow with not much water content and lack of rainfall , unless I misunderstood When we left in June , the last day I didn't even try Clear , Johnson I could thread my way into , Unexpected - getting to it was way shallow , even with the big motor trimmed up I sucked it full of sand , only got off my channel a few feet , but it was enough and I got to buy a new prop , hit a rock in the channel after it started deepening up by the outpost cabin just before getting into unexpected As much as I love it up there , probably not going back till things change and levels come back up"
6248560,tandm,2018-09-24 19:34:00,679,"Fished Ear Falls area in August, Chamberlain Narrows area 1st week of September. Water level down about 30"" inches both places. Many forest fires in western Ontario this summer, due to severe lack of rainfall. Fire bans covered most of the area in August, but were lifted by early September. Both lodge owners blamed low water levels on lack of rainfall.Nothing was said about intentional drawdown at either lodge. Used my Navionics card route line to get from Deception Bay to Chamberlain Narrows and back with no problems. Did see a lot of rocks I've never seen before, so didn't do any highspeed freelance touring. Did tick a rock during Ear Falls trip. Water went from 27' to prop ticking depth in the blink of an eye. Atleast I marked a new walleye spot. $75 to fix the prop."

My son and I were there back in 2002 when it was down about 4-5' due to repairs on the dam and I fish all of those humps that were sticking out of the water."
6249472,UpNorthGuy,2018-09-27 11:37:00,53,"ia bhtrJust got back from my 3rd trip of the year to Uncle Norm's and the water is finally starting to come up. The Manitou dam was wide open on Monday when we left and made the trip up the rapids ""interesting"". The lodge owner says Lac Seul is filled up and that water need to go somewhere.See you next June... Paul"
6249554,ia bhtr,2018-09-27 14:15:00,212,"That is good news Paul , where is levels at now compared to June ??"
6249562,UpNorthGuy,2018-09-27 14:52:00,53,"Probably the same as June, July and August were really low. If we are lucky theyâ€™ll keep climbing and have a typical winter."
6250930,lazermule,2018-10-03 06:52:00,86,I just returned from LS 10/1 (East end not Ear Falls) and I'd say the water is about 6 inches up from early August when I was there last. The small water fall was running in Deception Bay as well.LM
