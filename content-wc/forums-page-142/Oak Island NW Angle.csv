6236862,IowaWalleye1978,2018-08-23 17:37:00,96,Will you be fishing with guides or fishing on your own ?
6236890,BreezyPoint,2018-08-23 19:00:00,1581,"When I fished there (several times), we found the best Muskie fishing on the Canadian side and the best walleye fishing on the U.S. side. Walleyes mainly around Oak Island area and muskies everywhere on the Canadian side.Frank"
6237026,nwiowa21,2018-08-24 07:23:00,4,First day with a guide then on our own from there on out.
6237070,IowaWalleye1978,2018-08-24 08:46:00,96,The guides will put you on fish no doubt. I have been up the last 5 or 6 Septembers and the last 3 you could not catch a walleye if you were not fishing in the mud which is okay but my preference is to fish a hard bottom(rocks) and cover water. We typically pull spinner harnesses with worms or plastics we will jig here and there but I find jigging to be kind of boring(although about 5 springs ago that is all we did and we absolutely hammered them) Hopefully we stumble upon some crappies and if we do I will let you know!
6237076,nwiowa21,2018-08-24 09:06:00,4,Thanks for the info. Really looking forward to our trip. We have never been up there before.
6237126,Stu,2018-08-24 10:11:00,472,Be sure to let us know how you do. It's on my short list for a new destination.
6248808,nwiowa21,2018-09-25 10:54:00,4,"We had a great trip. Sportsman Lodge on Oak Island was great. Fished in Canada 2 days. Day 1 with a guide. Caught around 50 walleye 23.5 was the biggest. 1 38.5 inch pike. Day 2 in Canada on our own 35 walleye 1- 28.25"" and a 25"" were the biggest all on Jig and Minnow. Day 3 and 4 windy so we stayed close to Oak Island. Actually fished in MN on the South side of lake and pulled spinners. Great 2 days. 48 Walleye the first day and 70 the 2nd. Can't imagine a better trip."
