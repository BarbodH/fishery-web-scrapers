6245060,mr.crampster,2018-09-15 10:59:00,18,We stayed at La Place-Rondezvous on the way up to Red Lake and on the way back lay week. Nice hotel. Big lit parking lot. Boat safe. Good food and service. Will stay again.

6243662,lassh,2018-09-11 14:52:00,553,I'm headed up to Canada on Saturday and want to spend night in Ft. Frances. Where is the best place to stay if you're towing a boat? If possible I'd like not to have to unhitch but most importantly I want a place where I feel the rig and contents are safe. We probably won't arrive until about 10 PM. Thanks for any recommendations or advice you may have.
6243676,Jesse-WI,2018-09-11 15:52:00,534,I always stay at the Super 8 that has lighted parking.
6243700,crankbait64,2018-09-11 16:50:00,13,"If it's an option, a few weeks back we stayed at the Americinn in International Falls. Plenty of room to park the truck + boat even though the hotel looked full. Maybe 10 or so others parked there."
6243704,Bigfish10702,2018-09-11 17:03:00,60,"Well, since the famous Tee-pee is no more we are trying the Northern Lights this weekend. Will let you know what we think of it."
6243750,Bstar,2018-09-11 18:23:00,564,"Although I don't tow a boat, we stay at The Rendezvous and it seems pretty secure. Fwiw, acouple of years ago we were there during a bass tournament and some of the pros had no problem leaving their boats there."
6243814,Skis,2018-09-11 20:46:00,1523,"I'll second the Super 8. Stayed there on our trip to Lac Seul. Big parking lot and when we pulled in at 11:30 PM, still had room for our rig. And there were a lot of vehicle/trailers in the parking lot!!"
6243816,Carnhzkr,2018-09-11 20:47:00,964,"I've stayed at the Super 8 several times, and as stated, it has a lighted parking lot. I always try to park within sight of my room. Probably doesn't make it any safer, but it makes me feel better. This year's trip, the Super 8 was full, so I stayed next door at the Copper River Inn. There's plenty of parking there too. It's more expensive than the Super 8, but it has a better breakfast. I feel safe at either."
6243826,btyreprich,2018-09-11 21:25:00,1067,We have stayed at the Super 8 in the past and I agree there is ample and safe boat parking. I might suggest ch cling out the Hilltop Motel in International Falls. Nice clean motel with good parking and very safe area. Quite close to the border.
6243930,pjshorthorn,2018-09-12 09:13:00,5654,Spent 6-8 overnights at the Super 8 as well. Decent enough for a quick sleep with coffee and a snack in the morning. Lots of parking space as mentioned and never felt uncomfortable leaving my boat parked there. Easy in and out and just a few minutes to the border crossing. Have a fun trip!! PjShorthorn
