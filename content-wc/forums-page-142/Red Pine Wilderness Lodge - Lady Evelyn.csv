In the past we fished with Island 10 and Ellen Island - since we went I know Red Pine is under new ownership Wondering if anyone has fished out of Red Pine recently (last two years) and can comment on the lodge under new ownership Interested in cabin shape, boats, customer service etc We are interested in Red Pine as they do have housekeeping option and are located closer to the area we would like to fish vs Ellen Island If you would rather PM me no worries Thanks Andrew"

Fishing was ok for us,not great.I can't recall what time of year we went.(either old age,or too many trips).If you have fished that lake before and like it,I think you will be happy with their outfit. Problem is ,lady evelynn was shut down most of this year due to forest fires. So there was economic damage.The way that business interruption insurance works in these situations is strange.If your business was told to evacuate by the ministry,you are covered. If people were restricted from coming to you,but you are not under evacuation...you have no customers and no insurance. So the lodges on lady evelynn could use some support next season. My friend wants to go back.I prefer total isolation,unless its a very large lake.Then knowing somebody is within 10 miles is ok. Nice thing about that lake it is a short drive (by comparison to Nakina) I see you are in Mississauga I live in Oakville."
