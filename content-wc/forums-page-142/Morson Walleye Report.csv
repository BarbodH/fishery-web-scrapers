6248792,fishingMN4eyes,2018-09-25 10:21:00,108,Coming up on Saturday. Any reports? Any advice aside from 'dress warm'?
6249008,LyleK,2018-09-26 05:16:00,248,"We just returned from a 4 day trip but can't report much as we spent little time on the water due to the high winds and rain. 30 mph+ winds coupled with rain made it a nasty endeavor to head out. At one point we were asked to pull our boats from the water due the amount of pressure the wind was putting on the dock system. When we did get out, we did find some fish in current areas but our time on the water was short."
6249448,fishingMN4eyes,2018-09-27 10:10:00,108,BummerOne more bump on this thread before we leave Saturday. We will be busy tomorrow getting the boat ready to go.
6244770,LyleK,2018-09-14 14:11:00,248,"Anyone have a recent report on walleyes in the Morson area? Wondering if the fish are still on the rocks, in the deeper mud areas, or possibly moving into the heavier current areas. Any thoughts/input is appreciated. Thanks"
6245034,Obabikon,2018-09-15 09:21:00,2370,They have moved to the fall spots... deep mud. They have actually been biting very well the last few days! Have fun!
6245244,LyleK,2018-09-15 20:58:00,248,Thank you. Would you start in the Miles Bay area of possibly to the deeper water West of Morson? Thanks - have an upcoming trip so was wondering about the best plan of action to start looking for the walleyes. Thanks again
6245684,skirkpat,2018-09-17 08:14:00,12,LyleK - when are you heading up? I am trying to figure out a way to drive up to the LOTW Morson area in early October. I have never been up there that late...always during summer. Question: Any idea when fall foliage will be occurring this year? If I was up in Morson the 1st week of October do you think I would hit it? I can't imagine how pretty the LOTW would be during this time. Good luck on your trip!
6245890,LyleK,2018-09-17 14:17:00,248,"Normally October is a very beautiful month up there. However, given the dry year that we have had I don't know if that would impact the leaves turning or not. Others with more of a science background would be able to help with that. We are going up there this week and again the first week in October. So, fun times on the horizon. Not that familiar with the walleye fishing up there so will be trying to pick some brains on types of spots to fish or general areas to fish."
6245918,Hook_settr,2018-09-17 15:19:00,127,I am headed up this Saturday for a week so I would love to hear how you did when you get back. Much appreciated!
6245920,LyleK,2018-09-17 15:21:00,248,Will do.
6246020,Obabikon,2018-09-17 19:11:00,2370,I never fish to the west of Morson for walleye. I'm really only fishing Miles
6246024,Hook_settr,2018-09-17 19:18:00,127,I venture out to Miles too so I am always happy to hear what you have to say. I heard there is a brush pile in your vicinity that is popular with guides. &#x1f609;
6246028,Obabikon,2018-09-17 19:20:00,2370,just the one guide hahaha
