Although like most the shot at big walleye (25 inches +) or pike (38 inches plus) is great to The Shab South cabin looks awesome as do the baots and have heard only good things about Thunderhook however have found very little info on the fishing PMs are fine as well and all info appreciated! Cheers Andrew

From what they said it's a walleye factory and I expect it is. Can tell you the entire operation and Drake Dill, the man behind it is very impressive. I highly doubt you could go wrong.The ONLY negative is the other two outposts on the island at the north end. If all the camps were full you might run into other boats on the water."

In terms of the other cabins I would say most of the lakes we are looking at fall into a similar category - bigger lakes w more than one outpost - Whiteclay, Attwood, Miniss, Abamasagi, Whitewater and so forth Cheers Andrew"
