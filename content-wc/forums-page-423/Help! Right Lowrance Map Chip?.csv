1453477,adempsey,2012-06-24 17:14:00,963,"Thanks Seanik. I thought I had checked that previously, but must have missed it. I've been thinking of buying that map set for quite a while now, just hadn't needed to. Luckily my handheld GPS is a Garmin. You can find that map set for $80 or less online as well. Of course, I am probably going to just download it from Garmin at the MSR price since I want it for my trip that I leave for in two days. Have you considered returning the Lowrance unit you purchased?? It's unfortunate they don't have the maps you need because you're not wrong in assuming they make a good product."
1453506,jow,2012-06-24 18:38:00,20,try the Elite chip
1453560,Seanik,2012-06-24 20:24:00,218,"jow, Do you mean the chip already installed in the unit or is there some other chip I am un-aware of. I was under the impression that most areas in Canada were not well defined and vague on the Elite but if you have used this unit in Ontario I very much welcome your input. Seanik"
1454574,jow,2012-06-26 19:24:00,20,Thats the chip i have.It pretty much covers all lakes in ontario that have been mapped by Navionics .I will see if i can find a link for itIt did not come with the unit.i purchased itCall Jocelyn at Angling Outfitters 1 519 5395494 and tell him what lakes you want and he will lead you to what card you need.he may not know exactly where these lakes are but give him all the info you can and he will do his best to hook you up with your looking for.The chip i have doesnt have ALL of my fav lakes but it has alot of them Including lakes in Quebec
1450571,Seanik,2012-06-18 08:22:00,218,"I recently purchased a Lowrance Elite-4 Combo sonar/Gps which i converted to a portable unit., it has a slot for a SDCard and I am confused on which one to buy for the lakes I usually go to on the annual trips. The Lakes are Nagagami near Hornepayne, Ont. and Flindt Landing (Heathcote lake near Savant Lake, Ont. It would be great if Navronics covered these lakes with depths and contours but they don't or does any one else. The best I can find is Lowrance's Freedom map Eastern Canada, discontinued but still available on eBay, it's a topo map, no depths but reported to be well defined. Any expierence,help and suggestions with this will be truely appreciated by this old timer who grew up in the 50's & 60's with Elvis Chevys & Fords with 3 on the tree, DA hair styles, Luckies or Pall Malls rolled up in the sleeve of a white tee shirt, pegged pants, tight levi's, cars with bench seats and girl friends that sat close to you on them, Ah those were the days and now we wait for our mail order meds to arrive, talk to our friends about health issues and dream about our yearly fishing trips. Again suggestions on the right chip are welcomed Seanik"
1450602,Golden Eagle,2012-06-18 09:11:00,2642,I understand your issues. I'll check with my nurse when she comes by to have me breath on her mirror. MapCreate is on my X-15.
1450619,Fish_Heads,2012-06-18 09:43:00,154,"I had the Hotmaps Canada chip in my Lowrance last year & it showed me crossing dry land when in the boat heading up the lake to some of our usual spots. It was a waste of money for the lakes we fish up there. Went with a 5 inch Garmin stand alone GPS and a separate Lowrance 5inch down imaging finder instead this year. Heading up Friday to give them a try..........I'll report back in 2 weeks how the Garmin coverage worked. Their preloaded inland US lakes maps were in better detail than I had with my Lowrance when we had the boat out here a couple weeks ago, so I hope the new Canada chip is just as good up there. Fish"
1450745,adempsey,2012-06-18 13:36:00,963,"I have the same problem. I use a handheld Garmin GPS and resorted to loading up the City Navigator maps since it at least shows the lake. No topo or anything though. Heading up in a couple of weeks so I hope it works somewhat OK. A bit frustrating since the hydro charts are available for Nagagami and my other map set includes Kabinakagami, but not Nagagami. Ah well, at least there's a hydro chart to work with. The Navionics for my cell phone doesn't have Nagagami either."
1450916,Lazy Fisherman,2012-06-18 18:13:00,276,Call Reeds http://www.reedssports.com/ and I am sure they will be able to recommend a chip.
1453260,KHedquist,2012-06-24 06:34:00,4367,Have you checked out the Navionics website? they have a dedicated chip for Canada and check the lake list to see if your lake is on it?
1453308,Seanik,2012-06-24 08:35:00,218,"Thanks to all who have posted on this thread, The search for the right Ontario, Ca. Chip for my Elite-4 Combo continues, at this point I am beginning to regret my purchase of the Lowrance Elite-4 comb sonar/gps. I probably should have gotten a Humminbird or Garmin unit, being old school I always thought Lowrance was the best since they were the pioneer maker of depth finders. I found the Lowrance Freedom map Eastern Canada F112 EX-Ec 000-0108-216 on eBay, it's a topo map chip that has all of Ontario on it, the chip is a SD Card. The Elite-4 uses Micro Sd Cards. I would be happy with this chip but can't use it, not available in Micro SD card format and Lowrance has discontinued it. Navronics does not have the Lakes I usually fish on any of their chips, Nagagami near Hornepayne & Heathcote near Savant Lake, Garmin does have Nagagami with depths and contours and Heathcote as a topo map only compatible with their units. I am stuck with a lowrance decent color sonar that sucks as a GPS for the application I want, I built a case to hold the unit and an 8 amp battery to make it portable. I have contacted Lowrance and asked for help and all I get is ""SORRY WE CAN""T HELP"". I was hoping they could convert the Freedom Eastern Canada chip to Micro. One option is is to convert the Sd card to a micro sd card with an adapter, the sd card is plugged into the adapter which is plugged into the micro SD card slot on the unit. I am not sure if the discontinued Freedom map format is compatible with the Elite-4 unit, also there could be a waterproof issue with the adapter. Again Lowrance no help about this. Expensive lesson learned, I should have bought a Humminbird or Garmin unit. Seanik"
1453350,adempsey,2012-06-24 10:09:00,963,What is the name of the Garmin Map??
1453369,Seanik,2012-06-24 10:57:00,218,"Adempsey, The map is: Garmin Canada Inland Lakes Ontario, price is 116.65 USD, comes in either SD card or Micro SD card and is bathymetric. Nagagami Lake is on this chip. Compatible with Garmin units only. Seanik"
1453388,KHedquist,2012-06-24 12:28:00,4367,"Here is a long shot, but contact Navionics they are continuously upgrading cartography and they may add it if there are requests"
