Have they moved off shorelines and onto mid lake basin structure and traditional summer patterns? Or are they still really scattered? Water temps? Also interested in smallies and muskies . . . Heading out for first ever trip to Lac Seul: Lost Island Lodge out of Hudson on Sunday. Promise to provide a full report on my return, and maybe even during the week. Thanks, Bill"
