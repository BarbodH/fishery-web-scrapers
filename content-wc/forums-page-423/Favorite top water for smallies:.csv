1453983,bassface44,2012-06-25 17:20:00,96,"To the original question I have 2 main topwaters for smallies up north, and pretty much every where I fish. The first, and most used, is the Zara Super Spook. I use both the Super Spook and the Super Spook Jr. I probably favor the Jr for smallmouth and the full Super Spook for largies. I don't think color makes a huge difference to the fish but my confidence color is the florida bass color. Bass just can't help themselves but to eat it. The other bait is a chug bug. I like torpedos and pop Rs and skitter pops but I just seem to have more confidence in the bug. I look at top waters as search baits primarily so if something else is catching more fish then I make the switch instantly. That being said there are times that the topwater will select for a better size fish. The other guy may catch more but all of yours will be good uns. Something to keep in mind. Even though you may be throwing topwaters toward open water that does not mean you aren't fishing structure. It may be that the structure is just 15 ft deep. I will fish topwaters in 20 ft of water but there has to be a bottom feature associated with the deep water. Usually a sharp break but sometimes it can be a couple of huge boulders or a ship wreck. It feels like you are throwing out into the middle of the lake but you really are throwing to structure. Marker bouys, structure scan, side imaging and imagination are what help on these spots."
1454011,FryDog62,2012-06-25 18:35:00,1126,"There is no better fishing than smallies on topwater. For me, poppers are too painfully slow to retrieve. Walk the dog types are fun but get a little tiring after awhile. Just right, in between, and provokes strikes as well as anything is the old reliable Jitterbug. I've tried most of those listed in the above thread, but eventually go back to ""The Jitters"" and have the best luck of all..."
1454057,fishincrazy,2012-06-25 19:50:00,1282,Wow I was waiting for the jitterbug to arrive!!The guy who owns the camp I am going to this year told me his favorite top water is you guessed it the jitterbug.Do you have a favorite color?Size?how do you work your retrive fast slow medium?FryDog going old fashion I love it!!! FC
1454059,fishincrazy,2012-06-25 19:52:00,1282,Bassface I too am a big fan of the bug!My favorite one looks like it has been through the battle zone!I also like to fish over deep structure.I haven't used top water as a search bait although I plan to give it a go! Thanks for the post!FC
1454377,FryDog62,2012-06-26 13:37:00,1126,"I use all different colors but typically the brighter green/yellow during the day, black with white early evening. I tend to stick with the larger size and consequently get some toothy critters once in awhile (that'll get your attention). Speaking of old time topwater baits - my close second favorite is the ""Crazy Crawler."" Love the swimming action of those arms!!"

1453879,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-25 13:49:00,235,"For a guy who fishes top water only occasionally, I find that I only have confidence (and not much at that) in what last caught me a fish. My first top water bass was caught on a skitter pop, therefor I've mostly only fished with Skitters. One of these days I need to go on an outing with the attitude that I am going to really fish topwater hard and really learn it. Too often, I'll tie on and cast for 10 or twenty minutes with no bites, and once I see my partner catch one or two fish in the meantime on our usual soft plastics, I just say ""F&%* it, I'm going back to Senkos."" The other thing that is daunting about topwater is where to fish. You can cast into the areas in which you normally fish (near shore or structure), but it's known that many fish hit topwaters out in the open water. How often do we see surface strikes way out in the open part of a lake, not near any specific structure whatsoever? But to fish for those fish seems like 'needle in a haystack' to me. With all that said, there is nothing like a topwater strike for the adrenaline rush. Too bad our friend the walleye is not the most cooperative with this approach (yes, I know and have seen walleyes caught this way, but it's almost always a rarity)."
1453889,nd89sc88,2012-06-25 14:05:00,92,"""Question have you tried throwing it with a wire leader?""I have tried them with a wire leader, but it changes the way the bait sits on the surface and I think it's just too visible against the sky. I just got some fluorocarbon leaders and intend to try them when I'm on Lac Seul next week. I'll report back my findings.Bill"
1453910,keek,2012-06-25 14:41:00,1003,"I catch smallies all day long on a topwater baits. I find that I need to let the bait sit still longer during the mid-day hours but I still have many days where it's been the best presentation even during the blazing sun. Experiment with a small fly on a 18"" dropper line off of the rear treble on your poppers. I have heard this is pretty cool- have not done it yet."

I really like throwing them there on that shoal N of Garden Island right at sunrise,also the back of lesbo has always been good and over by rose cliffs,and of course the hump. Can I go with you Friday??????FC"
1453915,fishincrazy,2012-06-25 15:05:00,1282,"Keek this works we call em teasers and fish them both above the main bait and below when throwing top water.You ne to fish a top water that doesn't take much to work or the teaser fly gets tangled up.Mostly I fish a teaser in fron of a metal lip shallow runner,or when casting metal.It drives em nut's!This is a common practice surf fishing amazing how a 30lb striper will eat a 3"" long streamer. Like it that you fish the top all day now that's outside the box!FC"

1453617,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-06-24 22:09:00,84,"We have been using Sammy's, from Yosuri I think. They are pricey but the smallies can't stand them. I bought a couple of the Bass Pro knock offs of the of the Sammy. They are like 4 bucks compared to about 15 for the Sammy. They worked great and I will start using them and save the 10 bucks. Never seemed to have much luck with poppers either. I like that walk the dog motion better."
1453651,keek,2012-06-25 06:01:00,1003,Topwater smallie fishing is just plain old fashion FUN! The Sammy's are a Lucky Craft bait and I love them as well. The Yo Zuri bait of the same style is called the Banana Boat which I also love. The Bomber long A is an incredible bait when worked slow on the surface. Reel once and then pause - repeat. You will get SLAMMED. The plastic Zoom Fluke rigged weightless with a 4/0 EWG hook is a great surface bait when worked in fast twitching/walk the dog retrieves. The Zara Rattlin' Spook in Bone color is a very good bigger topwater bait for smallies. I am a huge fan of the Skitter Pops myself. Firetiger has been killing the smallies for me this spring here in NY.
