They are not returning my emails or phone calls. We are supposed to be there July 7 - 14. Does anyone know anything about this?"

Please feel free to leave a message and I'll be happy to help you.Like many camps in the area, Bear Trail has been on the market, up for sale, for several years. Once again, let me clarify, our customers have been moved to several privately leased cabins between us and Birch Dale. Cheryl at Birch Dale has been great at accommodating everyone. Any and all deposits have been forwarded to her. There were also a few other guests that could not be accommodated at Birch Dale, where we placed them with Andy Meyers Lodge and Fin and Feather, both on Eagle Lake. A few groups chose to stay at Cedar Point this year. Some guests from Cedar Point actually came over to see us during their stay to get a FULL CASH REFUND of their deposits with us. We are not cheating anyone. If anyone wants to speak with some of our guests that are CURRENTLY staying at Birch Dale, feel free to stop by there to ask them if we have been anything but accommodating. In regards to the numerous calls to Cheryl at Birch Dale asking about deposits or Bear Trail, Yes, she will be quiet about some things because those are private agreements between us and them. We have full rights to conduct business privately.I'm sure, at the end of the year, I will find a few guests that were not happy, as we have EVERY YEAR. I.E. The fishing's not good enough, the weather was not good enough, etc... Every camp owner on this lake, or in Ontario for that matter, have guests that play ""musical camps"" because they will never be happy unless they have something to complain about.Since this mess has started, I cannot keep the nasty posts off of my FaceBook site from people I don't even know and numerous spams on our website, as well. I wonder where these are coming from???? Stop the madness. I hope that, someday, some of you will find some time to go fishing instead of chatting about on a forum site. Good Luck With That!!Casey & ChandaBear Trail Lodge"
