1453670,maddogg,2012-06-25 06:49:00,178,Sidge61I live about 12 mi. from Sheboygan. We go in on the 13th. I'll be at SRL one day just to check it out maybe I'll run into you there.
1453840,Larry Mac,2012-06-25 12:05:00,530,"Hi WMD, we were there 6/16 to 6/23 and they closed the tunnel on Sunday. The water is very high right now and we had rain all week. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1453869,Sidge61,2012-06-25 13:29:00,59,They closed the tunnel but are portaging over the tunnel to get to boats on the other side so you can still fish those lakes.
1453950,Larry Mac,2012-06-25 15:56:00,530,"Hi Sidge61, yes you are correct. They now have boats on the otherside and Clamshell is now a portage lake until the tunnel reopens.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1454046,wmd,2012-06-25 19:35:00,388,"Larry Mac, thanks for the reply, leaving Aug. 31 for Ghost River. Thanks again, enjoyed your pictures.wmd"
1454244,Larry Mac,2012-06-26 08:24:00,530,"Hi WMD, that is a great time of year to fish the Canadian Shield. I am sure you will have a very successful trip. Have a great tripThank you,Larry Mac"
1454299,Larry Mac,2012-06-26 10:42:00,530,"Hello WC Friends, I felt some inadequacy in my earlier report when reading the wonderful trip reports posted by other WC members. I will try to be more specific and brief in updating our trip report to Ghost River.We found the walleyes in 12 to 17 FOW in what appeared to be a later spring/early summer pattern. They were moving deeper as the week progressed. The water levels were high. We also were still able to catch them in deeper current areas. We had our best results with jigs/minnows and crawlers. We however also had success with trolling cranks.We found the perch in the shallower water where we found the walleye. They also hit the jigs/minnows and crawlers. The smallmouths were scarce but were taken on top water lures in 2 to 6 FOW. They were in typical bass habitat.The Northern were predictable as usual but small and skinny.For the guys familiar with Ghost River the following spots were successful for walleye;The North River (mouth)Burnt NarrowsThe Trussel BridgeTwin FallsOne Tree IslandLarsen’s PointGarbage IslandButt Crack RockReefs (they were just starting to move on them)I realize these are some ""regular spots"" but I guess that is why they are ""regular spots"" LOLHave A Great YearThank you, Larry Mac"
1451553,Sidge61,2012-06-20 06:19:00,59,"Maddogg, been to GRL once before and yes you can fish 15 lakes but alot of the good fishing is right on the main lake-Marchington Lake. I can't remember how far it is to Singapore lake since we did not go there. Had good fishing closer. I plan on going to Rock Lake and Clamshell for sure. I'm sure that Darrell and Don will give us the latest updates and point us to some good fishing spots that are active. I will be staying at SRL with my son and my fiancee so look for us in one boat. We will be boating in to the lodge Saturday morning. Hope to see you there."
1451776,wmd,2012-06-20 13:41:00,388,"It is about 45 minutes to Singapore from Ghost River Camp. How is the water level, were you able to get to Clamshell thru the tunnel?"
1451932,djarz929,2012-06-20 19:53:00,40,Last week the water was getting up there. Don is keeping a close watch. We came home on the 16th and with all the rain that they have been getting since then it might be getting pretty dicey in the tunnel
1453273,Sidge61,2012-06-24 07:07:00,59,"Maddog, what part of central Wisconsin are you from? I'm from St. Point/Plover area. When are you leaving to head to GRL? We are leaving early Friday morning July 13th."
1453286,Guest,2012-06-24 07:38:00,0,"Sounds like a great time in mid July, my son and I will be at SRL in cabin #2 on Sunday. Looking forward to meeting you guys. Travel safe.......Mark"
1453287,Guest,2012-06-24 07:39:00,0,Forgot to put that we will be there July 15th.
1453504,Larry Mac,2012-06-24 18:37:00,530,"Hello WC Friends, we returned early this morning from another wonderful week at Ghost River. We stayed at Sturgeon River Camp from Saturday 6/13 to Saturday 6/23. The water levels were very high along with rain everyday but the last. The fish did not care as we caught hundreds of walleye, lots of perch and northern along with some smallmouth bass. Our largest walleye was 26”, largest perch 12” and largest smallmouth 19”. The accommodations were wonderful. The kids had a great time along with seeing three Moose and one Bear. I have attached a few photos and cannot wait to return. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1453516,Larry Mac,2012-06-24 18:49:00,530,"Hi All, Just a few more pic's Have a great year.Thank youLarry Mac"
1453520,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-24 19:02:00,1460,"Larry Mac, Nice family, growing fast! Wow, 3 moose and a bear. They will be talking about that for years to come. Congrats on another stellar fishing trip."
1453548,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-24 20:07:00,235,Results! I like.
1450280,waterwick,2012-06-17 09:22:00,32,"For a first class boat-in fishing adventure Ghost River Lodge on Marchington Lake offers all anglers, young and old, an experience they will never forget. Took my three wave babies (daughter wife and puppy) into this Sioux Lookout fishery for a relaxing American Plan 5 day vacation and was very impressed.Excellent friendly service from all employees, Outstanding food (Tena is an excellent cook) and that morning coffee delivered to our cabin was a Very Nice touch.The water levels are UP about a foot due to all the rain in the area, which is a good thing. Heavy gusty SW winds were the norm for the most part and the lodge boats handled them with no problem. Rained off and on (heavy at times) for 3 days but was no match for the Frabill Stormsuit.The water temps were 60 to 63 and we found the Walleye trolling and jigging in 6 to 10 feet range for the most part. Didn't catch any Perch, Northerns we didn't target but caught many, nothing over 30"", caught one Smallmouth 20"" and many Walleye. Largest was 25"" and lots in the 20 to 25 range. Best spot for us was 5 minutes from the Lodge at the mouth of the North River. Second best spot were around the islands sw of Larsons Point and third was the reef at Burnt Narrows. The walleye in the 17"" to 18"" seems to elude us and we had a hard time getting that size for shore lunch, but we did manage.There is so much water to fish it would take you 20 years of summers to fish it all properly. A great walleye system. I have attatched some pics. Tight Lines."
1450302,adempsey,2012-06-17 10:44:00,963,"Thanks for the report, sounds like a good trip! I hope my daughter is still interested in fishing when she reaches that age.Are you all sporting the Frabill rain gear?? How do you rate it?"
1450304,Rich B,2012-06-17 10:48:00,1081,Thanks for sharing those photos and your report.....despite the rain looks like everyone had a great time and at least one good shore lunch (made me hungry for fresh walleye just looking at the fry pan- ha !). Sounds like you'll be back to Ghost River Lodge. Rich B
1450336,waterwick,2012-06-17 13:09:00,32,Hi adempsey. My daughter lives/works/lawyer in Toronto 900 miles from Mom and Dad and she loves to come back home to get away from the big city life for a relaxing fishing trip. Yours will to I'm sure. The Frabill Stormsuit performed as advertised and I was very pleased with it's performance and would not hesitate to recommend it. It got a workout. It poured heavy at times. Stayed dry thats the main thing. I was wearing an older Wetskins rain suit in one of the pics. Stayed dry in that to. It is at least 25 years old.
1450337,Bill Krejca,2012-06-17 13:09:00,6107,Good report.
1450659,Sidge61,2012-06-18 11:04:00,59,Heading up there on July 13th for 7 days. Been there once before and this time staying at their other lodge. I see in your shore lunch photo you were not cooking on a wood fire. Is that due to any fire restriction or your choice? Also did the lodge provide the lp cook stove for you? thanks much.
1450717,waterwick,2012-06-18 12:44:00,32,No fire restrictions. I just decided that with all the rain in the area my folding Coleman lp stove would be quicker/easier for shore lunch. Not much dry wood on the ground.
1450898,maddogg,2012-06-18 17:33:00,178,"Sidge61,My wife and I will be there the same week, we're staying at GRL, maybe we'll see you there. I'm almost done packing. This is our first trip to GRL (we usually do fly ins) sounds like a great place. How long a drive is it to Singapore lake? Looks like a long ride on the map.Maddogg"
1450974,djarz929,2012-06-18 20:01:00,40,"Waterwick, we were there last week also (came out with your family on the same boat on Sat.) Great fishing, some of the best quanity walleye fishing that we've had. No trophies but as you said, abundant walleyes in the low 20 inch range. Stayed at Sturgeon River camp, Don took great care of us, great boats & motors, good cabins and great customer service. Will definitely go back. And I agree with you; a couple of the storms were real ""frog drowners""."
1451029,waterwick,2012-06-18 22:51:00,32,I thought you looked familiar.The only bad part of the whole trip was having to leave.
