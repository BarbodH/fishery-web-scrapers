1453877,fishincrazy,2012-06-25 13:48:00,1282,He puts em in the salt and freezes them?FC
1453882,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-25 13:55:00,235,"Not sure if he freezes or refrigerates them. I will ask. I just know that we have several freezer bags full of minnows...picture one about a third to half full of salt, you reach through it pull out the minnows buried inside."
1453888,fishincrazy,2012-06-25 14:03:00,1282,Cool I'm gonna do this!!!!FC
1453909,5richards,2012-06-25 14:41:00,131,Hey Fishincrazy -- we talked about this last year -- I live outside of Newtown --- I bought the minnows in bulk from a fish farm near Morgantown Pa. I used kosher salt mixed with the Borax at 4 to 1 as per Golden Eagle -- I layered the live minnows in a cooler with a base of the salt mixture -- then covered them with another layer of salt -- keep layering and then store the cooler in a cool location -- basement -- for a day or two -- check on the top layer -- they will be a little stiff and dry -- I then removed the minnows -- sifting thru the mixture and brushed off the salt as best as possible -- and let them air dry for a few hours -- then I put @18 in a zip loc bag and put them in the freezer ---they stayed there for a few weeks til we left for Canada ----- placed them in a small soft cooler with freezer packs for the trip --- Flight to Minnesota and a 12 hour ride in a rental car--- no problem for the salty guys!!! at camp we kept the minnows in the freezer and took as many bags out each morning as we felt we needed -- in the boat we kept the zip loc bags in a small cooler with our beverages --- worked like a charm -- even left some for the group following us -- all in all the process is fun and they definitely last longer than live minnows!!!
1453920,Golden Eagle,2012-06-25 15:14:00,2642,"Gosh Rocky, you gave practically a one hour college course. Let's hope you manage to get your minnows wet this season. Plenty of room for you the August 11 week."
1454033,drlee,2012-06-25 19:18:00,409,"I have posted this info before...but, just had a recent experience with salted minnows. Just returned from northern Ontario, north of Ignace. I purchase my salt minnows at Dutch's in Fond du Lac...I live in Sheboygan Falls. Years ago, we paid 50 cents a dozen for them. Then, for quite a while they were around $1 a dozen. Now have gone to $2 a dozen. However, the live minnow prices I saw this year in Ontario were at least $4 a dozen. So, I am still happy; and, Dutch's is VERY reasonable on their prices and first class in service; talk to Rick about minnows! To get to the meat of it: We just don't see any difference between salted and live. Sometime, leeches or crawlers will be a hot bait for a day or two. But, day in, day out, salted minnows are just fine. I fish two lakes north of Ignace for a total of 3 weeks each year. I seldom use any baits besides salted minnows. Obviously, they are so very easy to manage...gets the bait in the water more quickly; easy to store; no fussing with minnow buckets; etc. I have used salted minnows on fly-ins, boat ins, and drive ins on a variety of lakes in northern Ontario with very good success. I would be curious to know how much you pay for minnows when you do the salting yourself??? And, hey: If you run out of food, you can always put them on a cracker, cover them with good Wisconsin cheese, and have them for dinner. (threw up a little in my mouth after re-reading that sentence) BTW: We fished ""our lake"" for the 10th straight year and had the best fishing ever, both in numbers and size (lots of 19-22"" fish in a very far north, isolated lake). Weather: high water, lots of rain, rain suits 6 of 7 days, chilly temps, good walleye wind. But, we were too busy catching fish to worry about it. Hope your trip is great: fishing, campanionship, weather, food, relaxation."
1454061,fishincrazy,2012-06-25 19:57:00,1282,"Hey Rocky I remember talking about salting minnies with you,I just find it very interesting how different people go about it.I was going to email you anthow I can't find the minnow farm info you sent me my magic box crashed and I lost a bunch of stuff.I do have a conection bu it is by Harrisburg like 2 hour drive.If I remember the place you went to was closer.Last question shiners or fatheads.I might do some of both to experiment.Thanks Rocky!!FC"
1454066,5richards,2012-06-25 20:07:00,131,sent you a pm
1454067,1860Angler,2012-06-25 20:08:00,2642,"50/50 salt and borax mix in a ziploc bag put the live minnows in the bag and shake until minnows stop moving. Put them on a cookie sheet, sprinkle with the salt and borax from the bag and place in freezer. Once frozen separate a dozen per ziploc snack bag and put into the freezer until we head out. We have started doing this to all of our leftover minnows at the end of the weekend, so when it's time to head north of the border we hardly have to buy any minnows to freeze. As far as if they work or not, I can't tell a difference. We have tested locally with live and saluted as well as in Cananda and the salted work just as good."
1453427,pikeman14,2012-06-24 14:43:00,144,"Have you used salted minnows on your trip? I have heard good things about this technique for fly in trips, where weight is an issue. Does anyone know of a web site where I could buy fatheads in bulk? Thanks in advance.pikemanI do realize that the eyes' will bite on anything, even bare hooks at good outposts. Just thought of this as a lightweight/ easy to travel with option."
1453439,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-24 15:10:00,235,"There are several past threads on this that you can find using the search function on this topic, but I will chime in with my typical plug for salted minnows. We used to bring live minnows to our outpost(s), but for the last several years we've switched to salties due to cost, weight and their ability to last without dying. We haven't found an appreciable difference in effectiveness between live and salted. There will be guys who chime in to the contrary. I'm just sharing our experience in flying in to lakes in the Ear Falls and Red Lake area (mid summer). Could be different in other bodies of water at different times of year. Honestly, you could probably bring in only soft plastics and still catch many fish."
1453509,Ia Walihntr,2012-06-24 18:44:00,320,"I agree with Ten Horse about the salted minnows. I don't notice much difference between live and salted even when you use both in the same boat against each other. I buy mine, on the way up to Lake of the Woods, at Fish Lake Bait at Harris, Mn. (Hwy I35 just north of Mpls.) Just call a week or so in advance and they will have them ready for you. http://www.fishlakebait.com/ Marv"
1453517,packpro,2012-06-24 18:52:00,695,"We used frozen/salted on a trip to Nungessor. Pretty good results, however as they thawed in the boat they got a little mushy, making hook placement an issue. We used stinger hook(s) to compensate."
1453526,pikeman14,2012-06-24 19:20:00,144,Thanks for the bait shop lead walihntr.
1453531,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-24 19:35:00,235,One other thing on the salted: I would recommend fathead minnows over shiners for salted. They're a bit easier to hook squarely. We have found that one pound per man per four days (the length of our trip) is just about right.
1453553,Golden Eagle,2012-06-24 20:14:00,2642,"Adding borax to your salt will help preserve your minnows. About 4 parts salt to 1 part borax, plus a little garlic powder for stink."
1453573,fishincrazy,2012-06-24 20:57:00,1282,Do you add the borax to the brine or when you put the minnies in the salt?How long do you leave them in either solution?Do you freeze them por just refridgerate?I'm also wondering we drive two day's and hotel it overnight to reach the landing where we go how do you keep them frozen till you get to camp?I was thinking dry ice might do the trick?FC
1453649,Golden Eagle,2012-06-25 05:53:00,2642,"There might be a better method, but:Mix salt, borax and garlic powder. Then spread it on the minnows. Let it sit for a few hours in a bucket. Next I separate minnows so they are not touching each other and dry them in the sun. Once dry I put 4 or 5 dozen in a small ziplock bag and keep them in the freezer. I keep leftovers over the winter and they do fine the next May.(I'm careful not to start with minnows that have started to decay.)"
1453669,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-25 06:48:00,235,"This sounds pretty close to the way the guy in our group makes them. I would add that he uses non-iodized salt to prevent the fish from turning blue, also he places the finished minnows in a plastic bag of salt."
