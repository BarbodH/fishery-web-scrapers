1454563,adempsey,2012-06-26 19:01:00,963,"Ya, most of my weight isn't jigs. I cleared out about 70% of what I had originally. We mostly use 1/8oz, so I have about 100 1/8oz and 30 1/4 oz and 3/16 oz. I don't think I have ever taken so few jigs with me anywhere. I probably have about 200 grubs though. Some pike plastics as well, for trailers and some Mega Swammers paddletails I wanted to try.I do have one full tray of cranks for walleye though, and another with pike spoons, cranks and jigs. I still like to throw cranks once in a while and I know my brother does too.I also love bottom bouncing, so I have about a dozen BB's. Slip bobbers and some pike flies too! I have to toss out some flies for pike, it's really fun. Their weight is insignificant though.Gee, I wonder why my box is 30 lbs?? Lol.Quote: Originally Posted by Redearadempsey if your going to Nag take 3/8 oz jigs chartruse,orange,last yr white.White spinner baits &silver spoons with tails for pike also every thing else your taking not much tackle up there lol.FREDYou think I need them that heavy?? I normally use only 1/8oz wherever I go. I have three pike spinner baits (two Reed Runners and one Grim Reaper) and four silver spoons. Never forget those!!Quote: Originally Posted by fishincrazyI wish my bag weighed 30lbs I could never fly in,We go to a boat in or fly in place so no weight restrictions on the boat.I think I have 30lbs of bottom bouncers.My son loves to donate my gear to the bottom.I must have 500 jig's just for him to lose.Plus the walking weights and egg sinkers.I'm glad I take 2 bags.FCTrust me. My tackle bag is actually a Rubbermaid Tote + a couple of tackle bags most of the time. I've been laughed at before, lol!Quote: Originally Posted by Babamel2This method I assure you will work.

1454359,adempsey,2012-06-26 13:04:00,963,"I've gone through my tackle about five times, removing stuff every time. The fifth time I removed what I thought was a lot of tackle.I now sit here staring at my tackle box that STILL weighs 30lbs. I don't want to remove any more, but feel that I may have to. I was aiming for 15lbs. Is 30lbs of tackle too much for a week fly-in for three guys?? Please say no, lol!"
1454368,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-26 13:20:00,235,"It's either that or beer where you have the most room to cut weight. For some people, that is tough choice even on a fishing trip."
1454370,Hot Runr Guy,2012-06-26 13:25:00,16061,"Man,,,,, that's a LOT of 1/8th oz jigs,,,,,,,,, HRG"
1454372,adempsey,2012-06-26 13:31:00,963,I have about 100 jigs for three guys for a week. Plastics that go along with them.We also fish for Pike and panfish. Maybe some brook trout.Luckily we don't drink too heavily and the beer is flown in prior.
1454378,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-26 13:37:00,1460,"Even if the overload charge is 1.00$/pound, that's just 15 extra bucks, I think it would be worth it. 30# of tackle for 3 is not excessive in my books so go for it. Have an excellent time!"
1454380,mr-fish,2012-06-26 13:43:00,58,Mine's at 15. Leaving Friday for the Gouin. I know I'll add a few lbs to the box by then. Just seems too light !!!!
1454405,adempsey,2012-06-26 14:23:00,963,"Thanks!Ya, I have no issues with the overweight charges, the problem is the rate is highly variable. From my understanding there's no guarantee that a partially loaded flight will be available, so the rate could be a lot higher than $1/lb.Well, at least I got it down to just below 27 lbs and that's what I am sticking with."
1454430,Bob_Loblaw,2012-06-26 15:14:00,109,"I take about: 100 1/4oz jigs (25 oz total - less than two pounds) 30 1/8oz jigs (less than 4 oz total) 6 1oz bucktail jigs for lakers 6-8 different spoons for pike Twister tails/gulp/other soft plastics Total total for my tackle, box included, is less than 8 lbs. And I have NEVER come anywhere close to running out of stuff. I could probably take less than half of what I do, and I'd be fine. But I'm of the ""two is one and one is none"" school of thinking, so I bring some extra."
