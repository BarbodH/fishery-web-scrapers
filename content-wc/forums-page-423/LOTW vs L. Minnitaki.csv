1454582,TroyMansfield,2012-06-26 19:34:00,92,"thanks, and look forward to talking sometime, good luck fishing on Rainy Lake"
1454943,Lunkerbass21,2012-06-27 14:16:00,25,Group of 6 will be up there the week of July 8th and I will be porting every night on how we do. We are staying just north of French Narrows. I'll post to Twitter @Lunkerbass21 and on my blog at www.newyorkfishingreport.com. Should be a great trip.
1451873,trapsht,2012-06-20 17:29:00,28,"I have to find a new place to go last minute as my previous fishing spot was cancelled....SO if I can find a place with availability I'm between these two lakes. Is one lake clearly better for walleye, or is it subjective?? I'm planning on bringing my own boat. This will be the middle of July Thanks"
1451993,RapShad,2012-06-20 21:46:00,76,"I've been fishing Minnitaki for the past 13 years, and it is an excellent walleye factory, second only to Lac Seul, but in my opinion the walleye are a little easier to target on Minnitaki. The water is up this year so the rocks are less of an issue. It also has excellent bass, northern, and laker fishing (haven't seen a Muskie but I know they are there). It is also connected to Abram, Pelican, and Lac Seul. You will not be disappointed with Minnitaki. I leave for Sioux Lkt. tomorrow! Cant wait!PM me if you have any questions. I would be more than happy to help out."
1452017,Guest,2012-06-21 04:19:00,0,I think it's pretty subjective. Lake of the Woods and Minnitaki both have awesome walleye fishing. You won't be upset with either.
1452138,trapsht,2012-06-21 08:48:00,28,Thanks for the input. I'll be hauling my boat from illinois...can't help but think that I'll be saving a lot on gas if I can stop at LOTW. What do you think.....is Minnitaki 2-3 hrs further north?
1452173,Shorelunch,2012-06-21 09:46:00,554,"We fish out of Morson on LOTW. Area resorts include Obabikon, Mylies and Buena Vista. All good choices. July is traditionally reef fishing for walleyes and good smallie fishing, too. Area is very scenic and has very good fishing. Morson is about a 6 1/2 - 7 hour drive from Minneapolis to Baudette to Morson."
1452211,Guest,2012-06-21 10:59:00,0,"I fished once on LOTW and 10 times on Minnitaki. On LOTW we went out of Baudette with a guide and his boat, caught three 30 inch fish, bigger than any we have caught in Minnitaki. Also caught lots of smaller fish, no northerns. We just anchored and jigged in a big flat 25 ft deep, about all we could do with the boat packed with 6 paying customers. The main basin of LOTW requires a pretty big boat IMHO, my 16.5 would not be enough there. On Minnitaki we fish on our own, which I prefer. While walleye fishin there we get lots of northerns. Other factors being the same, I love Minitaki."
1452225,smbrickner,2012-06-21 11:16:00,276,The resort we go to every year on Minnitaki just had a cancellation I guess. I am leaving friday to head up there and love it. Used to go to Mille Lacs but like Minnitaki better.http://www.timberedgecamps.com/
1452349,Obabikon,2012-06-21 15:49:00,2370,"That's true, if you go to the open side of LOTW's you'd need a bigger boat. However, that's not the case on the Eastern or Northern ends of the lake. I of course am biased, but LOTW's has some amazing fishing."
1454087,TroyMansfield,2012-06-25 21:06:00,92,"I make it from minneapolis to sioux lookout in about 8 to 8.5 hours, Ive only fished LOTW once and have guided on minnitaki my whole life, so I am biased as well, but I can def help you out if you need some. pm if you have any questions"
1454259,trapsht,2012-06-26 09:10:00,28,"Thanks for all the help...I couldn't find lodging at either lake that would fit our budget. We were looking for housekeeping only. We're booked on the US side of Rainy LAke. This was one of those situations where time was not on our side since our previously scheduled trip was cancelled. Rainy will be fun, and there's always next year. Troy, i heard you run a top notch camp. We'll have to talk sometime."
