1453994,Painter1,2012-06-25 18:01:00,26,"We just returned from Amik Outpost's Jeanette (Jenette) Lake, about 75nm ENE of Red Lake. We had 8 fisherman and John flew us in early Tuesday, June 19th. We had unloaded and weighed our gear the evening before, bought the licenses and listened to the orientation. We were able to take off early, as John and his crew got the Otter loaded and ready to go before we arrived in the morning. The flight out took about an hour and was comfortable. The lake is beautiful but the fires last year have left much of the shoreline cover scorched. There were 6 guys from Iowa coming out of the lake after a week there. They reported that the fishing had not been good and that they had endured a lot of rain. They had been to that lake many times before but they really didn't appear to be a happy bunch that day. The cabin, docks, boats and motors were all in good shape and clearly a lot of hard work goes into keeping everything up. We had a bunch of guys with CPAP machines so John had flown in a larger generator for us. There are solar lights in the cabin, hot water shower, screened porch and 2 fridge/freezers. There are several outhouses in back in good shape and a nice deck in front with a gas grill. There are 4 boats on the lake and 1 on an adjacent lake I have forgotten the name of. There is another cabin on the lake that is operated by someone else. We fished for 5 days and caught enough walleye to feed everyone but the catch rate never got much better than ""fair"". Some mid-20's walleye were caught and even a 28.5"". We didn't find many pike other than what was mixed in with the walleye, but there were a few caught up to 38"". The weather was highly variable, as usual. The guys across the lake reported pretty slow fishing as well. We had a great group and a fun time but, of course, wish we had caught more. We are very impressed with the services and accommodations that John & Rena provided."

1454187,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-26 06:37:00,235,"Thanks for the report. This will be my fifth time going there and several in our group have gone about seven or eight times (we use Kabeelo, the other outfitter).The lake has two outposts on it and both outfitters seem to have a stable of repeat groups who come back year after year. We meant to go last summer but the fire burned down our cabin a week before the trip (we'll be staying in the new cabin they rebuilt last fall). I can't imagine that last years fire would have an impact on the fishing, but who knows. I'm hoping the slow bite rate is just some unexplainable temporary cycle that will recover (and hopefully in a few weeks time!).I feel bad that you didn't get to see Jeannette in all her glory, unburned and with fast fishing. To this day, Jeannette produced the most amazing big walleye day I have ever seen personally...three guys in our group went out one afternoon and among their catch were 14 walleyes that were 24 inches or larger, including a 31.5 inch monster whom our outfitter (Kabeelo) said was the biggest they had heard of caught on Jeannette. All big ones released, of course. This was about 2007 or so."
