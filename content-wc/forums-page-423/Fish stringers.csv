1454322,Bluff,2012-06-26 11:23:00,152,Check out the QuikSlide stringerhttp://www.quikslide.com/quikslide/index.php)Purchased one several years ago. Fantastic.
1454333,jopes,2012-06-26 11:40:00,692,"Used this one and had it for 6-7 years, the clips did start to rust then it fell out of my truck bed. I bought another one to use. I use it all year long both on the boat and ice fishing. But during the hot weather of summer I bleed my fish out then toss them in a cooler on ice.http://www.cabelas.com/product/Eagle...h-All+Products"
1452754,dog2,2012-06-22 14:29:00,198,ihave been using the same piece of wire going on 15 years and it only cost .48 cents yeah I'm cheap. Go to hardware store buy 3to 4 ft #12 or 14gauge multi strand copper wire at one end twist wrap a loop in the end like a noose or ring then take electrical tape and wrap your twist to eliminate any snags or stray wires on the other end bare 2 to 3 in' of wire take some solder and solder this bare wire . After the solder cools you can take some shrink wrap tubing slid over the end to cover the little points of wire. you can wrap it in a little coil takes up little space its lite and if it takes a walk you'r not out a couple of bucks. basic rope stringer made from wire.
1452820,maddogg,2012-06-22 17:22:00,178,I've used this type for over 30 years.http://www.hookandbullet.com/gear/st...fish-stringer/
1452982,lassh,2012-06-23 07:56:00,553,"I use a simple yellow nylon rope stringer. It is a shorter length stringer about 6 feet. If you can find the ones with the brass ring and pointed end, they last longer. Just punch the pointed end through the the thin section on the bottom of the fishes jaw, through the ring then tie off on the boat. Its simple, you never have to worry about a clip coming open even if you forget to bring the fish in before you take off in the boat and they are inexpensive."
1453094,outdoorsron,2012-06-23 14:17:00,843,Hello: Why would you want to drag your fish around all day like that. If you don't have a livewell get a cooler with ice and put your catch in it. Ive seen a lot of people in camp boats use stringers and by the end of the day I wouldn't want to eat those fish. A stringer would be o-k to use to take your fish to the cleaning house. I usually use a net or 5 gallon bucket for that job. Good Luck O - R
1453178,TIGHTLINER,2012-06-23 19:51:00,223,I GUESS WITH THE INFO GIVEN I AM GOING TO LOOK INTO A ROPE STRINGER AND FORGET THE METAL ONES. I LIVE LESS THAN 1 HOUR DRIVE FROM NETCRAFT /TOLEDO OHIO/ I CAN HIT BASS PRO CABELAS GANDER MOUNTAIN. MIGHT SPEND A SUNDAY AFTERNOON LOOKING AT THESE PLACES. THANKS GUYS
1453269,micropterus,2012-06-24 06:56:00,450,What O-R said
1453293,Blue Lk,2012-06-24 07:54:00,269,"Ron on some remote lakes & small boats livewells or an abundance of ice is not an option.Fish can be kept alive for a long time on a stringer if they are properly attached,the rope/hook has to be through the upper & lower lips so you are not dragging fish around with their mouths wide open.(this will kill them pretty quick)"
1453395,JayM5209,2012-06-24 12:46:00,1050,"x2. I have a home made variation of this one. Years ago I had one with these metal snaps on the metal porch swing chain, but didn't like the chain. I cut the chain off and used a 6' or 7' piece of light nylon rope which I ran through the eye of each snap. Tied one snap on one end and a dog leash snap to the other. Just got back yesterday from a trip in NW Ontario where I used it for probably the 20th year. You can tie it to the boat at whatever length you like, then snap the leash snap to something as extra security."
1453671,lassh,2012-06-25 06:50:00,553,"We use rope stringers on fly-ins to keep the fish alive until we clean them. You are right; if you drag fish around on stringer all day in warm weather or long durations out of water they will be stiff by end of day. We try to catch the fish we eat when we are close to camp so we can clean them while they are fresh. Yes, if you have a livewell or cooler with ice available, then use it for your fish."
1453746,Larry Mac,2012-06-25 09:14:00,530,"X2 with what lassh said; we have been doing this for years and have worked extremely well for us. We use the heavy duty blue ones and never have a problem. When utilizing the thin section of skin under the jaw the fish remain alive for us all day in cool water and weather. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
1452401,TIGHTLINER,2012-06-21 18:33:00,223,CAN ANYONE TELL ME OF A FISH STRINGER THAT WILL LAST MORE THAT TWO YEARS. I HAD A BRASS ONE AND AFTER TWO YEARS IT BROKE AND WE LOST 6 FISH. I HAD A GOOD ONE I THOUGHT COST ME CLOSE TO $15.00 AND AFTER TWO YEARS IT LET GO ALSO AND ONCE AGAIN 3 FISH WERE LOST. SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING IS BEING MADE IN CHINA OR JAJAN AND DOES NOT HOLD UP. I HATE TO GO BACK TO THE NYLON WHERE YOU HAVE TO UNTIE IT EVERYTIME YOU PUT A FISH ON. MAYBE ONE SHOULD JUST BUY A 3 BUCK ONE AND TOSS IT AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THANKS GUYS.
1452404,Obabikon,2012-06-21 18:41:00,2370,"We don't use stringers anymore, but seems like they'd be pretty easy to make a good sturdy one. It's just a ring, a rope, and a pointed end to run in through. I agree about things not lasting anymore. But, coated steel should last a long time...http://www.lindyfishingtackle.com/pr...steelstringers"
1452430,phishfearme,2012-06-21 19:57:00,1242,this is a pretty good deal and last forever. positive closure on the loop is very valuable:http://www.jannsnetcraft.com/fish-st...218293008.aspx phish
1452440,Basser,2012-06-21 20:10:00,31,I've had the same metal stringer since the 70's. Still works fine.
1452454,TIGHTLINER,2012-06-21 20:40:00,223,Basser... What kind is it? Metal or nylon? If it is that old and still holding fish you have a gem....i really think with the fish twisting from trolling on the metal string it wears on the metal.
1452457,TIGHTLINER,2012-06-21 20:45:00,223,Fish/ i just looked at one of these today this might be the ticket and put a end to loosing fish/
1452463,Bill Krejca,2012-06-21 20:59:00,6107,"The Sampo shown in the Jann's site worked very well for me for a number of years. I would suggest a couple of things which will make you continue to like it while using it: - Check out the orange square collar which holds the clip closed. Occasionally, perhaps due to the nylon molding process, a collar will not seat properly to hold the clip closed ...and the fish will get off. Upon receiving the stringer, the first thing I would do would be to test each clip to determine if you ended up with a collar that..just slides too easily. Remove the bad clip. The rest should last for very many years. - Because the clips are able to slide, when you put the first fish on, slide the rest of the clips up to where the stringer is tied. Open the next clip and hook it over the boat attached clip before you get the next fish, and the stringer will be ready to hold the next one, and so on. It is really difficult to open a stringer clip while hanging on to a just caught fish. Also, no need to have to lift all those heavy(?) fish out of the water every time another is added. Dad taught me that some 60 years ago - he used metal sliders then. Bill Krejca"
1452621,wishinfishinmn,2012-06-22 09:54:00,52,"we use live well now, but my dad and i about 10 years ago found very solid stringers at canadian tire in fort frances.hope this helps."
1452674,tilldawg,2012-06-22 11:55:00,55,I have had one like this for years. No problems. Even used it in saltwater.http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shop...t/59111/111695
1452682,grizzley,2012-06-22 12:08:00,2518,"I use these and really like them.I also modify them by cutting the line and installing a large swivel, like on a dog chain. with fish on, especially in the river, they have a tendency to really coil. the swivel totally eliminates that."
