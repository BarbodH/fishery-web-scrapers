On the 53 there were a few small construction projects, but nothing major, delays were maybe in the 5-10 min range. Both crossongs were in near record times!! No new or odd questions like where do you work or if you own any firearms. Have a great trip!!"
1453921,rather-be-fishin,2012-06-25 15:15:00,429,Road conditions from Duluth to Int'l Falls on Hwy 53 are good. Flood did not cause any permanent problems on this route. Safe travels and have a great trip! 1 month to go and counting down the days to our trip to Lac Seul! RBF!

1454036,brant,2012-06-25 19:25:00,89,Does anyone know if the route from Cloquet to Int. Falls is open? I think I read or heard there was a bridge washed out on Hwy. 33? We will be heading that way in 3 weeks.
1454075,rather-be-fishin,2012-06-25 20:28:00,429,Hwy 33 North of Cloquet is OPEN and fine for travel to HWY 53 North to Int'l Falls. The bridge that was washed out was on HWY 210 near Carlton MN and another one on Hwy 61 North between Duluth & Two Harbors. Small detour there.
