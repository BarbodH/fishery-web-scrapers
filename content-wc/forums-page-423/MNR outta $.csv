1453456,BennieS,2012-06-24 16:14:00,108,"I don't understand the juristictions of different government groups here in the US much less Canada. But, as regards the border crossing, I've been reading WC daily since January, have seen hundreds of posts on the DUI situation and still have no clue what the real criteria are for getting into Canada. And I am no clearer on the current ""one time amnesty program"". If tourism in Ontario and the dollars it provides to the economy is the issue, then my opinion is that some clarity in the border crossing law as regards DUI would certainly be a big help to those with an infraction. I believe a lot of people would pay their rehabilitation charges as long as they sere certain that they could gain access. I went for the first time in June, beat myself up everyday since I got back for not going every year for the last 30 years, plan on going again in September, alone at this point it looks like, and thank my lucky stars that I don't have any DUI issues to worry about. I mean what good does it do to call the border crossing, talk to someone, get an answer, and then read here on WC from someone who has done the same and reports that they were given a totally different answer. If the Canadian decision is that they don't want anyone with a DUI in their country, so be it. Why not just come out and say so and then everyone knows where they stand. The whole issue just leaves me confused."
1453462,3M TA3,2012-06-24 16:37:00,2846,I'm unfamiliar with those Gestapo tactics. Perhaps you could share a few. Thanks
1453470,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-24 17:02:00,1460,It's really not hard to find there 3M. Look to post #13 of this thread is a classic example. Realize that the term gestapo tactics is an adjective and not the noun.
1453598,v-bay gord,2012-06-24 21:40:00,3168,"Gustafson....what a waste of skin. On a more positive note, in a recent conversation with a local C.O. who was checking anglers.......the cut-backs are not affecting the performance of his duties. Gestapo-like or not, they are truly needed because there are many more ""Gustafson's"" out there. Good work on the Gustafson file MNR !"
1453602,cuamb,2012-06-24 21:45:00,203,I agree with Crede. I have going north for 30 years and the fishing keeps getting better.
1453802,NP4ME,2012-06-25 11:12:00,378,"Pikeslayer,I usually love reading your comments...but ""gestapo"" tactics?? Come on. There are always people with their horror stories of getting all their belongings and cavities searched. But how about the good experiences?? I have had a couple contacts and they have been nothing but pleasant. I truly wish I got checked more often. There is a reason I continue to drive so many miles...I hope it continues."
1453848,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-25 12:28:00,1460,"You are right, I am not making myself clear at all and using awful wording to boot. Let me try and make myself understood better. I absolutely have no axe to grind with MNR. I only have the one-time experience of being checked by them last June on Wabakimi, however, it wasn't a very cordial visit and left a bad taste in my mouth. You know, getting checked in a Provential Park is a much different experience than getting checked on Lac Suel or Eagle. The very well paid MNR officer and his pilot have to fly to your lake and find you. They had better hope you are not fishing in a narrow finger of the lake that would be inaccessable to them or their trip is wasted. In my case of last year, I'm a 50 minute boat ride from camp. If they demand to go through the camp, well, that's a half a day wasted of my vacation where every second on the lake is valuable. Like I reported back last year, the officer wasn't much interested in how many fish we had, licences or what you would think that he would be interested in. All he cared about was finding beer on Americans. Is that truly protecting our fisheries? I don't think so. Lets add it up shall we. MNR officer @ 50$/hr + pilot @ 50$/hr. Don't kid yourself, these guys make good money. The plane costs close to a million dollars and the fuel to fly there and back is certainly not cheap. The very closest possible airbase to my lake is 50 miles away. Without depreciating the plane at all, you are looking at 500-700$ to have my party checked last year. Yea, I'm pulling numbers outta my arse, but you guys get the point. From a business standpoint, Is this cost effective? Yea, I would rather see the MNR spend their money on the big-ticket items like keeping the VHS, Round Gobies and the Asian Carp outta NW Ontario and stocking lakes out east of decimated fisheries. Is this off-base? Am I asking too much? I also would like to say at this point, I do not drink. I have not drank since 8/27/87. When guest Lurker asked if I should worry about having beer in the boat anymore, I thought long and hard. ""Sure, I don't have beer in my boat but should the MNR be flying up to where I fish to check?"" I just feel that they could better spend their money looking for the Gustafson's out there. Go out and find a real fish criminal (or deer). Frankly, I feel that the vast number of Americans who fish NW Ontario do so with respect and are not the violators of this amazing place we come to spend our money on to get our own peace of mind. I certainly, think that walleye smuggling is so minute in these days that........ Well I would love to see the numbers. I have faith in my fellow man. Especially you guys."
1454053,Skywagon,2012-06-25 19:40:00,1106,"Just the possibility of having the MNR drop in helps keep everyone honest, for fishing and other regulations. I guarantee they are not flying in and checking very often any more, but there is always the odd chance, so in a sense it is cost effective. I swear, some times when I read this forum I think the only reason some people come to Canada is to drink, is it so important that you can't wait for a beer until you come in for the evening? Gotta have beer in the boat, at least for shore lunch?The fishing here is good for a reason and that is because of regulations that have been set up to preserve the fisheries. People do die from alcohol related boating incidents (of course it is always the other guy, who can't handle their beer); it is costly to do search/rescue, sometimes pulling dead bodies out of the water. My suggestion: if you don't like the rules and don't think it is right that MNR should be monitoring the taking-keeping of fish, or consumption of alcohol while fishing, maybe those people should consider alternative places to fish....."

1454110,HeHooksHimself,2012-06-25 21:35:00,725,"Skywagon and Blue Lk. Thank you for your self righteous condemnation of us obnoxious Americans. Jeez, that has been the nature of the feedback in this thread, over regulation and senselessness makes some of us uncomfortable. Most of us believe in conservation, but many of us enjoy a beer or two on the boat. Really, does anyone get hammered while fishing? How many rescues and pulling dead bodies do you think the MNR really gets involved in every year? And of that number how many are drunk American slobs? It is an example of a stupid rule that is basically unenforceable. Fortunately, we have a right to point out the obvious in our country. But, you are right, the fishing is better in your country so i am coming back and spending my crummy American dollars so you can pay your taxes and have someone tell you how to live.Fish On!"
1454192,Sidge61,2012-06-26 06:57:00,59,Well said HeHooksHimself!!! I have known more guides that have brought beer into the boats then the guests over the past 40+ years I have been going to Canada fishing. I have and will continue to bring a beer for myself and fishing partners for shore lunch. Does make me a bad person or a person that only wants to drink while in Canada?
1454224,LOW1,2012-06-26 07:53:00,2828,How many? If there is one that is preventable there is one too many. And the percentage of boating accidents involving alcohol is unacceptable.And please remember that it is not damage done to drunken boaters that is the only thing to consider - it's the damage done to others by drunken boaters that is the primary concern.My prediction is that in 20 years the presence of open containers of alcohol in boats in the United States will be illegal. One of the reasons we bought property in Canada rather than Minnesota is because of Ontario's drinking while boating laws - it's safer for our kids in Canada.
1454271,HeHooksHimself,2012-06-26 09:33:00,725,"Like it or not, you simply can't prevent stupid people from being stupid, no matter how many laws you write or how strict the enforcement is. Murder has been illegal since Cain and Abel, but it happens every day. At some point unreasonable people suffer the consequences of their actions and their actions sometimes affect the innocent. It is the sentiment that there is a horde of drunken slobs from the south invading Canada to spread excessive drinking and poaching of Canadian resources that I am addressing. Like Ron White says, ""You can't fix stupid,"" no matter how hard you try. By and large we are good people that realize that conservation is desirable and we respect your resources."

1452230,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-21 11:36:00,1460,"I heard that the Ontario MNR has been living high on the hog the last few years, but the budget axe fell this year. Also heard that some of their planes are grounded and or severely curtailed.

Ontario Parks will have funds cut to ""infrastructure such as washroom and shower facilities, administrative buildings, water systems, electrical systems, roads, trails, docks, picnic tables, and waste disposal facilities.""

But having many close friends who work in the MNR I can tell you for a fact that the cuts at the MNR have been staggering in the last 10 or 15 years. There have been times when COs I personally know have not been able to go on patrol because their district doesnt have the money to put gas in the trucks or snowmobiles. They are operating on a skeleton staff and have been for years.The stuff coming out of the press releases of the government is nonsense. What it really means is that you will not get much service from the MNR, rarely if ever see a CO and the lumber companies will be able to write their own forestry plans and cut whatever they want without a view to the future."
1452329,adempsey,2012-06-21 15:20:00,963,"Yes, we're in a really sad state right now. All government funded agencies have been scraping by for a long time and now huge cuts again.

1452402,Obabikon,2012-06-21 18:35:00,2370,"If I'm not mistaken, only the OPP can write tickets for beer in a boat. Sometimes there's an OPP officer with an MNR officer, but I don't believe the MNR would get to keep the beer tickets. Just the illegal fishing tickets. Either way, it's safer to not take beer into the boat."
1452431,phishfearme,2012-06-21 20:00:00,1242,"according to my one ex-OPP outfitter, that changed a few years ago - the MNR can now ticket for beer in the boat during their inspections - at least in the pickle lake area - maybe different in other areas? phish"
1452455,tooski,2012-06-21 20:41:00,393,I believe they are permitted to ticket for real beer but Iron City is exempt.
1453083,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-23 13:38:00,1460,"Yes I'm sure that my view is not anywhere near politically correct, but yea, I feel the MNR should find some real fish criminals to catch. Now with drastically reduced funding, should the MNR fly all over remote NW Ontario and maybe catch a few Americans on some totally remote lake enjoying a cold Labatts Blue in a tin boat with a 10 horse motor catching a few walleye on a very healthy fishery or maybe spend their resources say in SE Ontario where the natives and locals have netted or over-harvested their own fisheries to the point of devastation like Lake Nipissing. Not to mention the invasive species like VHS, Round Goby and the very real threat of Asian Carp. But hey, there could be some drinkin in a boat up on Abamasagi or Wabakimi or perhaps Smoothrock. Who knows? I'm just saying, that it seems like to me that so many of the lakes in NW Ontario where Americans like to fish are pretty well policed as is. There is a pretty good OPP and MNR ground presence on the biggie lakes like Lac Seul, LOTW, Minaki and Eagle. The resorts themselves police there guests better than the authorities ever could dream of. Picture some guy trying to harvest too many walleye while staying at Vermillion Bay Resort. I would bet that Vbay Gord would probably knock a knot on the perps head and hogtie em before having MNR take him into custody. I would bet that Obabikon and J Man and the rest of our fine resort operators are the same way. So yes, I say the MNR needs to prioritize their spending and quit trying to drive away the tourists who are (were) the bread and butter of the same resources they are out to protect."
1453087,TIGHTLINER,2012-06-23 14:04:00,223,Came back from the nakina area early june and then just got back from ramsey lake area and neither time did we see the mnr at the soo. Both trips i went thru at the soo on saturday a big day for american fisherman to be coming out of ontario. Usually you will see a mnr vehicle parked at the duty free or at the customs building but nothing this year.
