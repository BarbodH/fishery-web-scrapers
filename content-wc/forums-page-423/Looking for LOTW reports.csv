Nephew just got back from Flag Island area and did very well also. They used jigs, lots of them, we were to lazy to keep tying so we vertical jigged with a bouncer. Keeper size were the majority, perfect 18 inchers."

Leeches and crawlers both work. We will no longer be buying a flat of nightcrawlers...plastic works just as well and doesn't get the boat messy. BTW, the fishing was good, the weather was crummy."
1453143,bricken,2012-06-23 16:44:00,14,"just got back from morson last night. We had REALLY SLOW fishing due to weather, and the big mayfly hatch. We had a rough time even catching full limits. We did catch a couple of 25"" walleyes, one 29"" and my 30"". All in a 2 day period of nice weather. other than that we wished we would had waited another week or two to go up. The bite was really on the week b4 we got there, and looks to turn back on soon. good luck,"
1454632,1shooter,2012-06-26 21:32:00,1493,"Yep...We left Obabikon saturday morning and the walleyes were really slow Thursday and Friday. Saturday-Weds they were biting good. We caught 4-25"", 1-23"", 2-22"" and several around 20"". Lots of 14-18"". Minnow or crawlers didnt seem to matter. Depth was 14-18'. Thanks Jared.....the camp was clean and the service was great! Of course the Northerns were crazy."
