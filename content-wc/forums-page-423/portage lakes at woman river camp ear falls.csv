It could be well worth your time as they will be moving shallower, depth will depend on water temperature. They should be able to help you with spots and depths at your camp."
1453927,Guest,2012-06-25 15:26:00,0,"keeper we will definitely check with owner always had good luck trolling (we troll a lot) with 6"" plus plugs my theory is the bigger the plug the bigger the fish have fish same lenght of plug hit the plug and caught them thanks jim wolf chicago"
1452947,Guest,2012-06-23 06:02:00,0,interested in information on portage lakes by boat at woman river camp out of ear falls corless seems good owner claims 100 fish days but 1 1/4 walk on logging trail?? suggestions for best drive and boat to portage lakes don't mind walking long distance if you guys have had great number days at lake;going the 2nd or 3rd week of september experienced fishermen about 35 trips to canada over the years;fished goose bay camp (west end of lac seul) in may and did well;comments and thoughts are appreciated jim wolf chicago
1453238,HeHooksHimself,2012-06-24 05:14:00,725,"We have been to WRC several times. Corliss is more like a mile over a logging road and you walk. While most of the walk is over clear cut, there is about a 1/4 mile through the woods that made me somewhat uneasy dragging fish through. We have been to Corliss twice. Once we caught many walleye and a 36"" pike (skinny though). The other time we only caught a few. In this lake you need bump on your jigs since the water is dark. Spot lake is more like a 1/4. it is catch and release but there is a nice walleye hole right across from the boat cache on a large smooth rock.The best and most productive portage lake we use at least one day every time we have been there is Snakeweed. This lake is right on the road to WRC. you only have to walk a couple hundred feet to the boat cache. Consistent walleye over twenty and a good bite every time we have gone there.Paul has many other opportunities for different adventures and he only charges extra if he needs to haul the boat in for you. We usually use this camp for our shorter stay in the fall and find the main system keeps us busy and well fed for four days. The only issue is you usually have to travel some distance to get some variety, but there are places close to the camp that are productive. you will not find a better camp owner than Paul (and Debbie). He is knowledgable and fair and really wants to put you on fish.Good luck and fish on!"
1453658,Guest,2012-06-25 06:17:00,0,dear sir thanks for all your help I think we will pass on corliss (seniors but in good physical shape) that 1/4 mile thru woods sounds difficult will go to snakewood;have you gone to narrow lake (about 1 hr/boat but only 10 minute portage owner's favorite lake for walleyes have good gps no problem getting there) any suggestions for fishing on main chain for walleyes also willing to troll and cast for big northerns any suggestions for main lake or portages;have you ever dragged the 14' boat into confederation lake is it worth it;any chance for lake trout the 3rd week of september thanks for all help your comments and thoughts are appreciated will send you pictures jim wolf chicago
1453705,Mohleye,2012-06-25 07:58:00,368,"I've been to Spot twice and Narrow several times. Spot is a fun lake to fish, it has good walleye and also has smallmouth. Narrow is a much bigger lake, and with gps you can explore a lot of it if you want to spend a full day in there. We've always done well on walleye in Narrow, and we don't target northerns, so I can't help you there. The Narrow portage is short and super easy. Both these lakes are used by other camps also, although in September you have good odds of having the lake to yourselves. I don't think I would bother with Confederation. I've never been there, but I don't think they have any walleye fishing at all. If you want trout you're already on the Woman lake system, which has good trout fishing. Before South Bay Lodge burned down a few years ago a lot of their guests portaged into the Woman system, but I never heard of anyone going the other direction. Spot is catch and release but as of last year so are all of the portage lakes in that area up to a certain size. Narrow is big enough you can probably keep fish, but you might want to check with your camp owner."
1453717,Guest,2012-06-25 08:18:00,0,mohleye thanks a lot I appreciate your help will send pictures and give report planning on 3rd week of september will visit spot and narrow jim wolf any other tips just post chicago
1453719,HeHooksHimself,2012-06-25 08:23:00,725,"Sounds like Mohleye has more experience than us. We have fished Big Woman some and that is a very nice lake. In the fall we had a little more trouble there, but spring results were very good in the first by from the river. Little Woman is full of smallies and big ones at that. Throwing Blue foxes or twister tails around the islands has been good for us there. In addition there is a rock shelf up the river towards Big Woman that has a ton of smallies on it. There is a productive walleye hump on the left as you enter the river from Little Woman. We also sat on a productive hole as you come out of the Refrigerator on the left. at about 15' of water. In Snake weed we caught most of our walleyes as the lake opens up from the road and along the shoreline on the right heading to the north falls. We have never been to Narrow and it is a long way from camp but I know Paul really likes that one. You will have lots of water to explore, but it is not practical to shoot back to camp for lunch or for an afternoon break. Say hi to Paul from Jeff and Norm. Fish On!"
1453752,Guest,2012-06-25 09:30:00,0,jeff and norm thanks for all your help will issue a report and email pictures if you want jim wolf chciago
1453800,HeHooksHimself,2012-06-25 11:08:00,725,That would be great and we will enjoy it. We will be at Cedar Lake this year about the same time you are at WRC. We will be there from 9/13-18. We will be posting a report as well. First time there for us. Fish On!
1453816,NP4ME,2012-06-25 11:33:00,378,"Jim,I wouldn't bother with Confederation. It did have some good numbers of trout and some nice northerns, but no walleye at all. Only fished Confederation one year...don't plan on going back.NP"
1453831,Guest,2012-06-25 11:53:00,0,keeper and minnow thanks for your help keep me posted how fishing was at cedar lake and we will not waste our time at confederation lake thanks again and please keep in touch jim wolf chicago
