1453591,Nimstug,2012-06-24 21:36:00,2605,"Jab, I basically did what it sounds like you are preparing to do - try a new line on bunch of reels at the same time. I did that... once. Thought for sure I would like what I was buying and it turned out I didn't like the stuff at all. So I just dropped X dollars and here the stuff is on all my most used reels. Not the answer to your question, but it were me with a week to go before the trip, use what you are used to (fresh line if you want) and save the new line for local trips on a rod or two and see how it works. Or maybe on one rod for your preferred technique, with a spool of your old stand-by if you don't like it. More to your question, I mostly use Power Pro but I kind of don't like it in Canada because it's so quiet up there. I find the buzz of the line annoying. Locally, I don't notice the sound it makes. Nimstug...back to 8lb XL?"
1453599,fishincrazy,2012-06-24 21:42:00,1282,Nim I was just thinking about that with my big surf poles and 50lb briad it's like sand paper sound when you cast and reel in.Totally annoying on the pin drop quiet nights on the beach.That is till the 50lbers come out to play then all you can hear is your heart racing full speed ahead!!!FC
1453616,Gregking,2012-06-24 22:09:00,2658,"To be clear I use the vanish but when my 12 yr old daughter comes to me with new line for fathers day,b day and christmas we put it on with smiles talking about how this is some great line. I have done this for years and won't stop anytime soon. She remembers all the line when I ask ""when did we do this one?"""
1453822,northernbite,2012-06-25 11:45:00,1186,"I've went from Fireline to others and now I'm running Power Pro. I was jigging with mono to flourocarbon and now crystal. I think I'm headed back to 8# xl and stick with Power Pro. I tried the Power Pro Slick and had tangle problems. Crystal is better for that.My opinion,Paul"
1453842,wallydave,2012-06-25 12:05:00,2151,"I had always been a flouro man for jigging, until I tried. Northlands camo walleye braid this trip! Great feel easy to tie and the white marker section was nice to have during cloudy days, really helped in those conditions. Fishing in current with a 1/4 oz jig I could feel the jig slide down the sides of the rocks and could feel the bite too!"
1454165,octanehi5,2012-06-26 04:59:00,1104,"My favorite is suffix 832 10lb test ,second power pro 10 lb,on those lite bite days tye on some florocarbon. these braids are on all my reels. I have yet to loose a fish because of line failure. biggest fish on this 10lb test 43"" #25 lbs pike. My fishing is done in northern Quebec waters, we fish very hard for 14 hrs a day and for seven days. never even had to change line. in a week we catch 850 walleyes and 150 pike this is from two guys.Braid is noisy on casting and retrieve,you can cast farther with floro,But the durablity of the braid can not be beat.It usually doubles the rated lb test it is.If you get snagged you will have to cut it with a knife.if you try to break it with your hand you will cut your self on the line"
1454614,Painter1,2012-06-26 20:42:00,26,"If you haven't tried the Nanofil yet you might want to try a spool. The diameter differences between 8lb and 12 lb is very slight so I have been using the 12 lb for finesse Bass fishing all year on Tablerock in Missouri. I used it on 1 reel walleye jigging with a fluorocarbon leader last week in Canada The Nanofil is very sensitive, casts a mile and generally handles line twist better than anything else I have used. I did troll an Erie Dearie and it twisted the line up pretty badly. Even after I untwisted it though the bottom 12 feet or so had a ""twist pattern"" set in it."

1452078,jab,2012-06-21 07:05:00,12,Starting to prepare for a week at Press Lake Camp and am going to start putting new line on all of the rods we will be taking up. Just wondering what everyone's choice of line is for.......jigging? trolling? casting? slip bobbers?

1452113,adempsey,2012-06-21 08:04:00,963,"All my reels are currently spooled with some type of braid - PowerPro, Sufix, Spiderwire. I also run a six to eight foot fluorocarbon [or mono] leader which will slowly get whittled down to about 3-4 feet before I change it. The leader is important because it makes it easier to work with (retying etc.) and I use a lower pound test (8 or 10lb) compared to my main line (20 lb) so it will break before my rod does.I also like using mono as a main line and typically have at least one rod spooled up with it. The stretch and floating properties of mono have some advantage at times. I've tried all sorts of brands of mono and co-polymer lines and find that most of the common brands are pretty good, but definitely all need changing each year. I just currently picked up some Ande mono to try - hopefully it works well because I heard good things and the price is right.I've only used the fused superlines (e.g., Fireline) ice fishing, and I really like it for that."
