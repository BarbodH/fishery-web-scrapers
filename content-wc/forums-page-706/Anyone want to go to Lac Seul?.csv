It is a 6-8 person cabin, with a required minimum of 4. One of our guys cancelled so we are left with 3. If any group would like to share our cabin (up to 5) email me at [email protected] for more information. The cabin is a regular cabin, with rates listed on the website. We have been to the region many times and the fishing is usually excellent. Thanks! Ryan"
