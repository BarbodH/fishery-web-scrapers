The lodging is first class all the boats are large Lunds and it has an attached 4star restaurant. The meal package gets you enything on the menu that the locals are paying good money for breakfast lunch and dinner. The river fishing is awesome 3 miles up river from the lodge is the dam, and you know they are always stacked up there, no matter what time of year. Take a look at www.kolodge.com. It may be what you are looking for We have been there 4 times over the last 9years. No matter what you decide have a great time."
