Never been there and wondering about good spots, good lures/tactics and fishing with an early ice-out. Has anyone been there and can help me out? Any info will be helpful. Thanks"
557052,Guest,2006-05-09 17:05:00,0,I'm going there in July - will be interested in what you find out - let me know how you do!!!!
557063,sidewinder,2006-05-09 21:05:00,96,"I went to Nungesser first week of July last year. Where are you staying? We stayed with Chad at Nungesser Lodge. Also know Kevin at Anglers Kingdom. Kevin is very good fisherman and he will put you on fish,really good piker.He also has great equipment. Chad put us on fish. He knows some beautiful humps that are a little tricky finding but are full of 22-26 eyes. Only complaint with Chad is he has a curfew 9:00 or 9:30 i think, just when we are getting our second wind. We would go back if we get chance. We are going to Wabaskang May 27. Staying at Peffreys(sp) Seems like a great guy on phone looking forward to meeting him in person. Did I tell you I am excited? sidewinder sidewinder"
