557077,Frankm,2006-05-10 06:49:00,154,MistaWalleye I don't remeber it being iced up by Ciancis but I remember the south end being froze. Did you catch those Walleye under the bridge right by Ciancis? I've always wanted to give it a try. Yep Frank mostly did ice fishing. I'm glad he gets to kick back and enjoy some fishing.
557091,Guest,2006-05-10 09:42:00,0,"Wallguy, Where are some general locations you would recomend on Pakwash for mid June? Let me ask you this. What is the general migration following spawn on this lake. Do most of the fish spawn in the river or bays then migrate to main lake points, reefs, islands? I'm not looking for you honey holes, just some general ideas would be appreciated. Thanks"
557095,Guest,2006-05-10 12:19:00,0,"Mid June you will likely find them around the Provincial Park Bay. That is the bay about 4 miles south of the Trout River on the east side of the lake. You can see the camping areas for the park as well as the picnic and play areas. Usually anywhere on the beach area can be great that time of year. Expecially if you get a nice south wind blowing into that beach. They can be caught in anywhere from 3 to 12 feet of water.There is also a resort in the same bay, its a bit hard to see but if you see a series of docks behind a break water the resort is hidden amongst the trees on the shore line. Even the Ministry of Natural Resources don't know all the spawning areas on Pakwash. My experience tells me that there are a number of areas on Pakwash that attract spawners. Which has resulted in many large walleye caught at the beginning of season. Anyway have fun and experience Pakwash for it is without a dought one of the most fun (and frustrating)lakes I have fished in this area. For me thats what makes it one of the best."
557109,Guest,2006-05-10 16:53:00,0,"Yep right at Cianci's, Red Lake was frozen up that year on opening weekend and I had some friends come up from down south. Frank C suggested to come down and launch from his camp because the river was open. The bridge did very well. Franks best kept secret... You'll probably see him at the camp this year on opening weekend. He's given the new guy a hand on the start up.. Tell him you spoke to Mista W... Cheers Mista W"
557133,Guest,2006-05-11 16:04:00,0,Sorry I did not get back to you . Being from MN it is the prov. Park not the state park. We stay at the camp that is up the river they have changed names. Walleye Fred
557161,Guest,2006-05-12 11:43:00,0,We stay at the camp that is up the chunki river [pardon the spelling]. Lost Lake can be good for eaters and bigger if you hit it just right. What has the weather been like up there this year? Anyone know what the ice-out date was. One other way to fish is to find a point outside one of the bays. Make-sure there is a good drop off and then jig early in the morning or late in the afternoon. Walleye fred
556914,Guest,2006-05-05 12:07:00,0,"We have never been there for the opener that I can remember. The earliest we went would have been Memorial day weekend. My Grandfather also went early on, back in the 50's. Dale actually owned several camps on Pakawash over the years and kind of move around and settled in where the current camp is. If I remember right my Dad said he owned Trout River at one time (this is where we are staying this year) and I believe his first camp was the one that was South of the park on the east side. I'm not sure it is called or if it is even there now. It has been a bunch of years since we have fished that way. We have been fishing other lakes in the last 10 - 12 years and I am very much looking forward to getting back to Pakwash. Do you think the fishing is better at the opener than say mid/late June? The bugs probably aren't as bad. We have been fishing in August and even September on some of other lakes and I have been very impressed about that time of year. June however, has remained a traditional time to go for the most part. Did Frank and Lucy retire, or buy another camp? Have you ever fished South Bruce?"
556917,Frankm,2006-05-05 12:28:00,154,"I believe they retired. I know he invested some money. He was telling us about various stocks he was into. Last year he made some huge improvements. Brand new docks, steps to the dock. All the cabins got new refrigerators (normal house size) and ceiling fans. The fridge was nice. We were able to keep our fish in our own freezer. I think your right I think Dale owned both camps. Do you remember Willy? The opener is hit or miss it seems like. If the ice is out late they are still spawning and we catch mostly skinny males. The last couple years have been wierd. Walleye fishing was pretty good last year but pike was slow. Two years ago we had and absolute incredible year for Pike. In the same spot in one afternoon we caught 9 Pike over 36"". The biggest being 40"" and 43"". I had never seen anything like it. We went back the next day and caught 6 more big guys. BTW I was up there when they had the forest fires. We left early and got turned around by Kenora there was a tree on fire in the road."
556955,Guest,2006-05-08 07:18:00,0,"Frank M, Oh ya, I remember Willy. He was something else. I wonder if he is still living. Last I heard (11 or 12 years ago) he was doing some work in Red Lake, helping load stuff in planes or something. I remember when Dale would go to Red Lake and get supplies, Willy would think it was a big deal and ride in the back of Dale's Cadillac, so the other Natives would think Dale was driving Willy around. I have a bunch of awesome memories from that camp when I was young. Do you ever Remember Indian Joe coming around. He lived in that Shack on the river on the other side of the bridge. Someone said, he got drunk, passed out and froze do death. He used to come around and look for some work from Dale. Willy would get totally P offed at that guy, because he was lazy and didn't work as hard as Willy. The year of the fires, we just made it through. We actually broke down in the cities and spent the entire day there getting the truck repaired. We then drove all night to get to camp. I think that is what allowed us to get through. The road was just opened up. It was something to see the devastation. My uncle, who was a couple days ahead of us also got turned back. Back in the early days, we used to go back into Walsh and Anderson Lakes a bunch. Dale had boats in each. Frank kept a boat in Anderson also. Back in 95, I caught a 47 inch, 28 pound Nothern out of that Lake. Frank took a bunch of pictures, you may have seen them at the lodge. I hope we get into some good Northern fishing this year. Last time, we went over to South Bruce and got into them good, but nothing over 3 feet. It will be interesting to see how things are after a number of years. I'm sure we will have a good time."
556957,Frankm,2006-05-08 07:49:00,154,"Willy finally retired and passed away shortly after. I don't remeber Indian Joe but I remember the shack. It is almost completely gone. Just the roof is laying on the ground. My grandpa told me the story about Willy in the Caddy. thats too funny. I hope the old photo albums are there. I would like to see that 47"" that is HUGE. I am so ready. We leave next Thursday. I wonder what memories this year will bring."
556969,Guest,2006-05-08 13:28:00,0,"I agree with the positive comments above about Bruce Lake. Our group has probably caught more walleye in Bruce than Pakwash over the years. East Lake can also be good, especially if you're looking for a place to get out of the wind. Our bigger walleye have tended to come from the area generally around the Walleye Islands and near the entrance to Fisherman's Bay. Look for humps. We also like to target sandy bays on Pakwash if the wind is blowing into them, pulling crawler harnesses in water as shallow as 5 feet. Rick at Trout River Lodge has always treated us right."
557012,OHIOPILOT,2006-05-09 02:40:00,19,"We've been going up to Pakwash for over 28 years with a few years at Gullrock mixed in. Last year there were alot of boats heading into south Bruce. Way back when before they busted the channel open for access Rick used to take a few groups per week, you would have to navigate back a ways in the boat and then walk in the remaining few hundred yards where he had 2 boats waiting. The walleye fishing was great from what I can remember. Fishermans bay is great for pike. Recommend that you look for 4-8 feet of water with visible weeds and throw Daredevls or any other big/heavy spoon. (red/white, or orange/gold -Cabelas makes a good knockoff of the old Blue Fox Aqua spoons)."
557035,Guest,2006-05-09 11:03:00,0,Thanks for all the advice everyone. I wish you all a fun and safe trip to Canada this year.
557039,Guest,2006-05-09 12:45:00,0,"The only reason someone would catch more walleye on Bruce rather than Pakwash would be because they don't know Pakwash. Pakwash (by far) will out produce Bruce Lake any time of year, in either numbers or size. Bruce lake is tiny, has very little structure and therefore easy to fish. Pakwash takes some learning but it is worth it in the long run. I too once thought Bruce to be the better of the lakes but now that I know Pakwash better I can always(and I mean always)find the walleyes. Enjoy the fishing where-ever it may be. Wallguy"
557069,Guest,2006-05-09 22:11:00,0,"Hey Frank, Did you go opening weekend the year Pakwash was iced up? We fished under the bridge that year and caught a 6 pound walleye. It was too funny. It's started to rain like cats and dogs. Everyone was fishing at the mouth of the river. Someone had just caught an 8 pounder and the rain started. We rushed back and decided to fish under the bridge. Best fishing ever! We caught 5 nice slots and the big one... Frank C was a good host, I spoke to him on the weekend. He told me that he'll finally get a chance to go fishing this year. He never really got out that much with the camp and all...I told him that I saw your post.. He says a big Hello! Mista W"

556758,BeaverPuddle,2006-05-01 15:06:00,13,"This June, my Dad, Brother, Nephew and I are going to Pakwash Lake, North of Ear Falls. We fished this lake when we were kids nearly 30 years ago, and again about 10 years ago. Back then, we fished from small camp boats and didn't get far from the resort. Now we are bringing our own boats, that are more suited to traveling further and exploring some. Can anyone help me with some places to start looking for walleye and pike? We are staying at Trout River Lodge and will be there June 17th - 23rd. We are somewhat familiar with the system and have fished areas like the Provincial Park, highline bay and East Lake. It has been so long since we have fished this lake, that I am not sure where to begin on this trip and I really want to get my 10 year old nephew into fish. I have a fairly good map of the lake and have been looking at some likely spots, but if I had some suggestions it would save on time when we get there. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance. BeaverPuddle"
556769,Guest,2006-05-01 20:17:00,0,You don't have to worry about fish. Rick or his son in law Bill will tell you where they are biting and what to use for bait. Just as any resort owner in this part of the world would. They want your stay to be as good as possible so you will come back.
556824,Guest,2006-05-03 09:36:00,0,"I'm sure Rick will have a good idea where and how to get into fish, but I would still appreciate any advice other may have. Thanks,"
556828,Frankm,2006-05-03 11:03:00,154,We've been going for the opener in May for 12 years straight and stay at Ciancis (right next to Trout River Lodge). We too fish the spots you mention. We also fish alot in Bruce Lake. If you look on your map heading towards Bruce there are a couple of bays. One has a big feeder creek. It can be a good spot for Pike and Walleye. Also where the river connects to Bruce there is a 20ft hole. You won't see many boats that way. Also in in Bruce when you come out of the river and go S.E. around the corner there are a couple nice bays. Be careful venturing anywhere else in Bruce there are some rocks right in the middle. The are usually visable. We haven't ventured too far into Pakwash. We usually have enough success at our close spots. Bruce is a nice place to find a spot to yourself.
556866,Guest,2006-05-04 10:02:00,0,"FrankM, Thanks for the information on Bruce. We did fish Bruce years ago, but not very hard. I will give it a try. We even tried South Bruce once with some good success. Not sure I can get my current boat in there now. Thanks again for the info and good luck on your trip."
556879,Guest,2006-05-04 15:21:00,0,Been fishing the lake for many years. Usually go for opener but have been there in mid june. The best luck for us in mid june has been the state park bay or flats. There has to be a wind blowing in there the stronger the better. Pull spinners and crawlers anywhere from 9 ft all the way up to the shore. You will get fish from small all the way up to 30 inches 31 was our biggest. Great lake to fish we stay on the camp that is up the river. Good Luck
556899,Frankm,2006-05-05 07:47:00,154,Walleye Fred did you stay at Ciancis too? Also where is State Park Bay. I looked on the map is it the skinny bay approx in the center of the Provincial Park? We've never fished up there. We've been going to Ciancis for 12 years straight on the opener.
556900,Frankm,2006-05-05 07:50:00,154,Walleye Fred did you stay at Ciancis too? Also where is State Park Bay. I looked on the map is it the skinny bay approx in the center of the Provincial Park? We've never fished up there. We've been going to Ciancis for 12 years straight on the opener.
556904,Guest,2006-05-05 10:18:00,0,"Thats exactly what we did in the past years ago. We would pull spinners or cranks on the flats at the provincial park beach. good to know that bit is still good. Good South wind there is the key. Have any of you fished further south from there, like the walleye islands or the islands just south of fishermans bay? I was told that lost lake can be good for eaters, anyone know anything about that? It is a little bit of a run, but after fishing LacSeul for the past several years and making up to 27 mile runs there, the run to Lost lake wouldn't be that bad. Also, on a side note, when I was younger we stayed at, what is now Ciancys. In fact, we stayed at Frank and Lucy's a couple different years, 10-12 years ago. Before Frank and Lucy bought the place, my Dad's cousin Dale Stouffer owned the resort for many years until his passing. The most interesting year we fished the lake when we where kids was the year of the fires. We were the only ones in camp that year and as I remember the fishing was very good. Again, back then we were just had the camp boats and didn't go really any further than the park. It will be neat having my nephew along to fish the same lake and spots my Dad started my brother and I on. Thanks for the info guys. Hope you all have a good trip up north."
556911,Frankm,2006-05-05 11:36:00,154,I started going when I was 10 years old and it was Dale Stouffers Holiday Lodge. I just found out a couple weeks ago that Frank and Lucy sold. There is a new owner Ron Brownalee (spelling?). Him and his family are going to run it. Did you ever go on opening week? We have been in cabin #2 for 12 years now. My 88 year old grandpa used to be with us. He started going in 1954.
