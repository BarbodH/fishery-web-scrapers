I have a pristine fishing boat that myself and my Canadian fishing friend have been fishing out of for many years.I am moving up to a bigger boat and now he wants to buy mine.Each time we call Canada Customs, its a different story from yes you can to NO you cannot!! Hoping someone here can help out on this. Thanks in advance."
