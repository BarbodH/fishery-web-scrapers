Does anyone have an opinion on underwater cameras and this technology? Recommendations? It seems some models have a limited field of view or problems with low light. Thanks for any help."
557160,Guest,2006-05-12 11:10:00,0,"this should be in general discussion or strictly fishing, you may have more response."
557167,Guest,2006-05-12 13:39:00,0,"I think it is a valid question and wish I knew more about them to help you out. I remember one time when Ron Lindner was fishing the Lake of the Woods in the KBI tournamnet. Well anyway he was using his camera and spotted some big bass, really big bass. Well he kept trying to get them to bite and stayed on them all day----but just couldn't get them to go. Moral of the story is that you may spot fish with the camera, but are they active fish. If not ----- move on."
557169,driftersifter,2006-05-12 13:57:00,109,I have one and I like it but in low level light such as prime time walleye bite they are not very good as they don't pick up light very well. They are great for learning to interpet the depth finder and what the bottom looks like I now can read my depth finder so much better. It really added to my confidence level on reading my lowrance. One thing it does also help with is how your lure is moving and acting to entice the bite. I have used these on trout streams to look into holes and under the banks it feels like I'm cheating though. I use to scuba quite a bit and the camera is faster and drier than suiting up. Michael

Essentially I believe they are NON-ESSENTIAL at BEST! They help during ice fishing and can rule out marks on graphs that MAY be fish. Otherwise IMOP they are vastly overrated. GOOD FISHING!"
557183,Mr. Walleye,2006-05-12 19:43:00,74,Forget the camera. It's cheating!
557188,Guest,2006-05-12 22:10:00,0,Dynamite is cheating. Underwater cameras are an expensive toy.
557206,Guest,2006-05-13 20:49:00,0,Had one a couple of years ago on Lac Suel. Because of the stained water it didn't work at all (unless it bumped into a fish). More of a pain than anything.
557208,Guest,2006-05-13 21:48:00,0,"Thanks for the replies. I think I'll skip it this year; whether its cheating or not (I think not), the more time I spend messing around with the camera is less time I spend fishing. Good luck Andy"
