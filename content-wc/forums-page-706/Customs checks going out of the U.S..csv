557016,jigman 2003,2006-05-09 07:34:00,981,"Yep, that's my point too. I have nothing to hide, but when we willingly give up our freedoms it is dangerous. For those of you who don't mind this intrusion: Do you own firearms? Are you ready, willing and agreeable to registering each and every one of them with the government? Will you mind when you are stopped driving on a local road and have your car searched? Are you ready for a ""government ID"" that would be required for getting a passport, leaving/entering the country, buying hunting/fishing licenses, etc.?"
557018,Guest,2006-05-09 07:56:00,0,A legal search is a legal search.Thank God that you live in a Country that allows us to express our opinions like we are here. The inconvience of a LEGAL search could have stopped the Oklahoma Bombing or removed a kidnapped child from the trunk of a car or confiscated drugs that poison our youth. Yes I would be upset if my house was searched but only because I would have a difficult time understanding why I was suspect of something illegal. A friend of mine had his house searched last year by DEA. Unknown to my friend his Brother who was living in his basement was selling drugs. it got ugly ...but it should have.
557021,Guest,2006-05-09 08:57:00,0,"I am a retitement age US citzen with nothing more serious than a speeding ticket on my record. Last 4th of July week, while I was on 2 week vacation in Canada. Homeland Security, (ATF & Postal Service), got a warrent and broke the doors of my midwest farm home. They had prior knowledge that no one was home or even in the country, they knew more about me that I even remember myself. They took gun related items, computors, my financal records, and other personal property. They left a copy of the warrent on my kitchen table and the local sheriff contacted a relative to secure the premisiss. I was called by this relative and informed of the goings on. I of course contacted my attorney long before I returned to the US. To this day I've not been contacted by law enforcement and even questioned about this. However when we got to the border US Customs took 3 hrs to strip us down and search us including a body search. Everytime I have gone through the US border since, I've been searched, there must be something juicy on their computor, last time 7 customs people were standing looking at us like monkeys in the zoo at one point. What did I do to deserve this attention? To the best of my knowledge and detective work, a former employer, of 15 years ago, still holds a grudge. Somebody sent an illegal package to this person. After the Feds. questioned this victum for over 4 hours and accused the victum of having sent the package themselves to exploit an insurance policy, the victum gave them my name as thier worst ""enemy"" in the world. Apparently a search warrent is easy to get for the Feds., according to my attorney. Obviously they found no incriminating evidence at my home, or I'd know it by now. The victum proceeded to publicly slander me, with numerous witnesses, which has seriously harmed my small business. Yes, I see a law suit in the future to address that slander. My attorney says I can file to recieve my property returned in 5 years after the statute of limitations runs out. In the mean time evey time I return to the US, I can plan on the dog and pony show at customs. And that is how ""Homeland Security"" treats honest citzens."
557023,Guest,2006-05-09 09:05:00,0,"Sorry to hear about your situation. This sounds to me like the real problem was the ""Grudge"" that put Homeland on your trail. It is possible that they had information from ""Grudge Boy"" that made sense to them. What if the information were correct and you were guilty of something. The Warrant indicates that the information was believable enough for a judge to issue.....even though it appears to have been a hoax caused by a idiot. Hope you get some satisfaction in your lawsuit."
557047,hammer_gold_spinner,2006-05-09 15:48:00,151,I kind of opened Pandoras Box on this one. I looked at the link above about Homeland Security and found it interesting that when talking about In-bound and Out-bound inspections they state that they have adopted regulations to allow this. Just wonder if its constitutional. ANYWAY let'm search to thier hearts content I am legal when I cross either way. Last question. Why do they have enough people to inspect a 60'sh & white husband and wife leaving the U.S. in their Chrysler van but don't have the people or resources to inspect more than 75% of the cargo containers coming into this country. Which could be the more likely source of the DIRTY BOMB??????? LOL I guess after working 28 years in law enforcement and not being able to search without P.C. I'm just pissed at all the crap I missed. Mac
557056,idapaul,2006-05-09 18:30:00,82,The man who gives up freedom for security deserves neither!!!
557057,rpieske,2006-05-09 18:37:00,1276,"Idapaul: Enclose it in quotes and attribute it to that great man Benjamin Franklin...""The man who trades freedom for security does not deserve nor will he ever receive either."""
556960,jigman 2003,2006-05-08 10:55:00,981,"As stated before, Homeland Security can pretty much do anything. That's why some people are a little upset. It seems we have our own Gestapo now."
556971,MoWalleyeguy,2006-05-08 13:55:00,409,"If they did nothing for the security of our Country then what? I have to say I appriciate everything that is done to keep my family safe even if they require seaching me my vehicle or just asking me a lot of questions. Money that ends up leaving this counrty often times is funneling to terrorists, and thats a serious problem. Money comes in and goes out and often times its to pay for there ""cause"". I agree with DaveB and say if you have nothing to hide then why worry. Hitler or any other communist dictator has nothing to do with it. We forget so fast of the horror of 911 that we are blinded and even get upset when they are trying to do a job even if its an inconvience. Airports and border crossings are just something we have to be understanding of and accept."
556973,Guest,2006-05-08 14:07:00,0,"The question is, how many freedoms are you willing to give up to feel safe? The $10000 cash limit leaving the country was around long before 9/11. It is about making sure you pay your taxes."
556977,MoWalleyeguy,2006-05-08 14:28:00,409,"No one is taking away from your ""Freedoms"". You have all the freedoms allowed to you under the Constitution. Protecting that Freedom is some thing not all of you understand. Its amazing to me how so many can be so negative when it comes to our security. When the Troops went into Iraq they found Hundreds of Millions of dollars of real US Currency which was being used to pay terrorists. How did that much cash get out of the US? I hope a pray nothing happens again in our country but that is very unlikely. Help the ones that are trying to protect YOUR FREEDOM. Go along with what they ask and then go about your business. Ive had Border Patrol Stop me 50 miles from our sothern borders looking for Illegals Aliens or even Illegal prescription drugs. This is just another part of the crack down on controling the wrong doers that hate us Americans."

556986,Guest,2006-05-08 15:23:00,0,"I think you're missing my point. I realize I have to accept some things in the name of security. But there has to be a line. When I cross the border into Canada, I fully accept their right to check and see what I am bringing into their country. I also understand it's the same when I come back. I'm not sure I like the idea of the border patrol/Home land security stopping me while I'm leaving the country or 50 miles from the border."
556987,Guest,2006-05-08 15:34:00,0,"I whole heartly endorse them stopping you or me anytime they want to. This is how we can all hope to limit terrosit acts, drug sales or any other illegal activity that can endanger our right to freedom. Too many of our young Men and Women have made the supreme sacrifice and died since the beginning of this country in order to protect our freedom and their sacrifice is only enhanced when security is inforced."
556989,Guest,2006-05-08 15:40:00,0,"I have to ask, who are the them and they that you endorse stopping us?"
556993,Guest,2006-05-08 15:58:00,0,"Only found a THEM. Im referring to anyone who has been issued a credential by a body of local, state or federal goverment that gives them the right under the law to make a search that is legal. I realize that this is a very touchy subject but I do believe that if we value our freedom and our rights and respect the country we live in we should each do all we can to protect it ....even if we think a certain law is not worthwhile we should embrace its enforcement. John Kennedy: Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country."
557015,Blackmacs,2006-05-09 07:17:00,2121,"Does this mean that when they, Homeland Security, come to your house and search the place in the name of national security you'll welcome them with open arms? We are protected by the constitution from illegal search and seizure. I have nothing to hide from anyone but as Americans we are also innocent until proven guilty."
556916,hammer_gold_spinner,2006-05-05 12:17:00,151,"A few days ago I had an unusaul experience. On our way to Canada we were in line to cross the border but as yet had not entered Canada. As we slowly moved ahead we say U.S. Homeland Security Personnel checking vehicles ahead. When we got to them they asked for I.D.s and asked why we were going to canada. Asked to look in the vehicle and the one question that they asked everone in the vehicle was ""How much money are you taking out of the U.S.? I guess you connot take more than $10,000 out of the country without telling someone. It was an interesting experience as it is the first time in my Hundreds and hundreds of trips into canada that I was checked by U.S. customs as I left. Does anyone know if they can do this without any probable cause or what. I know P.C. is not needed coming into the U.S. but going out???? Mac"
556918,Guest,2006-05-05 13:07:00,0,I've seen this quite often at our local small entry port in NW North Dakota. Not sure what the deal is....never been checked yet. Always see it on my way back in to the states. Clarkie
556920,Guest,2006-05-05 15:00:00,0,If your leaving the US they don't need probable cause to stop and question you.
556921,Guest,2006-05-05 15:02:00,0,Why would that be?
556928,north_alabama,2006-05-06 07:57:00,172,"They are an ""extra-constitutional"" agency, and thereby can more-or-less do whatever they want to whomever they want. Unless/until legislation is enacted to impose limits on them specifically. In the current state of fear the government is using to expand its power inside the country, I wouldn't expect anything to change in a positive direction."
556934,Guest,2006-05-06 11:03:00,0,This is almost comical. The U.S. Homeland Security people really must be the stupidist people on the face of the earth by checking for a measly 10K dollars going out of the country WHEN BILLIONS OF U.S jobs and products leave for China EVERY SINGLE DAY. The largest conglomeration of simple minded people in the U.S. are getting employment paychecks from the goverment.
556936,tlars,2006-05-06 12:27:00,137,"They're checking for drug/terrorist money that is somehow being ""laundered"" in the US and then taken out of the country."
556937,Guest,2006-05-06 13:36:00,0,If you are not doing anything wrong then there is nothing to worry about. They do not need probable cause for a border search.
556945,Guest,2006-05-07 05:56:00,0,"To Dave B: I completely understand what you are saying, Hitler said the same thing."
556959,hammer_gold_spinner,2006-05-08 10:36:00,151,"I agree that if you are doing nothing wrong you have no worry BUT tell me where does their authority extend to. I.E. I was 100 yards or so from the border and moving towards it when checked. How far back from the border do I have to get to keep from being stopped? A block? A mile? 100 Miles? I fish Rainy Lake a lot. Is border waters Can someone from Homeland Security stop me at anytime to check me out? Things could get interesting up there. You could be stopped by MN Wardens, Coast Guard, National Park Rangers, Homeland Security, Kooch Co. S.O. or St. Louis Co. S.O. They should hire the MN State Patrol to direct traffic for all of the enforcement boats. LOL Oh well! I guess we just have to put up with the crap inorder to have the fun. Mac"
