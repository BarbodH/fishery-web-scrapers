557185,Sutsgold,2006-05-12 19:46:00,219,I have heard many stories of NWO ballet being performed at PI's during the week.
556175,Guest,2006-04-12 15:36:00,0,"This is not a strictly fishing question. But, I will be spending a night in Dryden on my way to Sioux Lookout. Looking to enjoy a ""Blue"" while watching some dancers. Any in the area? Thanks and only 48 days to Lac Seul1"
556176,JimH,2006-04-12 18:02:00,320,When are you going? My wife and kids tell me I do a mean chicken dance...lol:rotflmao:
556177,Guest,2006-04-12 18:05:00,0,"Jim, Before I finished reading, the first thought that popped in my head was that you were going to tell him your wife would dance, lol."
556184,Guest,2006-04-12 21:02:00,0,I might have done a little research about this in the past and this is what I found out. There is this little circuit where a few girls go to different bars during the week and there is a stripper night at certain bars. One night the girls will be at a bar performing in Kenora. The next night they will move to Dryden and then move to another town the next night. The girls I saw in Kenora two years ago were from Whinnepeg and are paid well to do the traveling. They usually perform on Tuesday through Thursday. I tried but I could not find a full time club anywhere....unless we detoured through Windsor...and that town and the bachelor party is not allowed to be talked about!!!!!
556217,JimH,2006-04-14 08:23:00,320,He didn't say WHO he wanted dancing...lol
556219,Guest,2006-04-14 11:18:00,0,"Dryden is home to the infamous Patricia Inn Family Restaurant, also known as ""P.I.'s"". It hosts arguably the finest ballet in Northwestern Ontario. The ballet runs Monday through Wednesday in Dryden, and there can be just as much to view in the audience at P.I.'s, as on stage. On a few occasions, I have been fortunate enough to see an impromptu amature night arise. As a former connoisseur of the NWO ballets, the presentations do vary depending on the performers of the week, yet I am confident you will be pleased...and, regardless of the performers of the week, the more Blue you enjoy, the more astounding the performance. Enjoy."
556242,Skylane,2006-04-16 07:51:00,101,"I have not been to the area of PI's where the dance is held, but after dining in their restaurant last summer, I would suggest you eat somewhere else before you get there. I would also add that if some of the clientel I saw in the restaurant were the local talent Biffster mentioned, then a lot of Blue would be in order. Dryden is a nice town, but places like that are all the same."
556275,Guest,2006-04-17 14:15:00,0,Will be staying in dryden in june. Any good places to party or at least get a decent meal. We usually end up at Mcdonalds at least on time and edible. Also lookin for a place to have a few beers were stayin at best western. Have stayed at chalet befor but quit going there after new owners took over.
556279,IaDave,2006-04-17 17:21:00,476,There is a great place for steaks and it has a nice bar and also a deck overlooking the river that is there. I'm sorry I don't remember the name of the place but when you are coming in from the west and when you cross the bridge after the paper mill take the first right and it is down that road about 1/2 mile. The food was excellent. I'm sure somebody will know the name of the place.
