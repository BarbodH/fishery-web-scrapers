BUT .....lots of moose . We saw five randomly along route and near the road in broad daylight ....so keep your eyes open, watch for flashing headlights of drivers giving you warning too. Night time driving would be even more dangerous ! Those moose have a tendency to deconstruct a car or truck jake"
557094,Guest,2006-05-10 12:15:00,0,"If I was returning to Wawa and parts North this year(unfortunately I'm not) I would not even be disappointed if there was construction. The ride from the Soo to Wawa has got to be the most beautiful scenery I have ever laid eyes on. The Eastern shore of Lake Superior is something to see. I can't even imagine what it looks like when the leaves turn. So enjoy it, construction or not!!!"
