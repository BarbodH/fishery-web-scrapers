556975,Guest,2006-05-08 14:20:00,0,I have been Musky fishing only for 2 years and have minor success. I have actually landed three fish but had many follows. I have kind of hooked up with a group of Musky guys who are planning on fishing Lake of the Woods on the May long weekend. I know that the season opens in late June but these guys say that they only catch and release muskies and if we get stopped that we were actually fishing pike. Is it OK to fish Muskies catch and release only in Ontario. I don't want trouble with the DNR but would like to see these guys in action. Thanks.

556982,Guest,2006-05-08 14:40:00,0,"I wouldn't waste my time fishing with a couple of Richard Heads that dont have any more respect for the law or the fish or the fishery than they do. I hope they get caught and recieve the punishment they deserve. Most guys like that break all the fishing and hunting rules because in their mind they are ""Special"". They are right they are ""Special _ _ _ holes."

Have you ever heard an American call it May Long Weekend? Please don't assume everyone who breaks the Canadian laws are Americans."
557008,bigfish1965,2006-05-08 20:22:00,3210,A real Canadian calls it 'May Two-Four'. Intentionally targetting an out of season fish is quite illegal and in many places will get you tarred and feathered.
557009,Guest,2006-05-08 20:38:00,0,"It always amazes me how some sportsman can have so little regard for the law and the resources it protects. I have always felt that if you knew more about these individuals that you would find they lead lives that are filled with indiscretions. It may even be traced back to those who taught them about the outdoors when they first learned that what they wanted to do was more important than the law or the resource. Tar and Feather might be to good for them. Maybe they are just stupid and dont care about the rest of the world. But some day they will get their punk cans stepped on by somebody and they will probably yell ""foul"".....hopefully no one will listen."
