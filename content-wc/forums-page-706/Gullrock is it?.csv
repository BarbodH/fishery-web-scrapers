557100,Sutsgold,2006-05-10 13:36:00,219,Is there a public boat launch on the lake or do i need to be staying at one of the lodges?
557111,Guest,2006-05-10 17:22:00,0,If your staying in Red Lake there's a couple of launches ...And the access to Gullrock from the waterways is fairly easy. Bug river is your access to Gullrock.. Right off highway. But if your not staying at a camp where are you staying? Mista W
557113,Guest,2006-05-10 20:23:00,0,"We recently got a couple of cancellations in June due to holiday scheduling problems. We had been booked since the summer of 2005 for June, shouldn't be long before they're booked again. We are most definitly a camp geared towards an enjoyable fishing holiday no matter what your age. We look forward to seeing our guests in May."
556196,Guest,2006-04-13 09:44:00,0,I got a friend who keeps bragging about the fishing on Gullrock lake it's located near the town of Red Lake. I was wondering if anyone has fished this lake and could give me some info.
556197,Guest,2006-04-13 10:00:00,0,i think everyone here fishes at this lake. Have been there as well and it is a great lake. you will get tons of replies.
556213,Guest,2006-04-14 00:09:00,0,"Gullrock, Hmmm, my favorite ice fishing area. Large body of water, linking up to Ranger, Keg, Chukuni river, Red Lake, East bay, west end...Head up to East Bay in the spring for a non stop fishing frenzy...Huge spawning beds... You'll have a blast. Mista W"
556214,Guest,2006-04-14 01:36:00,0,"What can I add...how about fishing sunken islands in July and boating over 30 walleys in a 2 hour period and keeping 3 for lunch cause the rest were well over the slot...oh throw in the bonus 40"" northern my brother picked up on the same hump...kind of wondered why the 'eyes suddenly shut down. Not as big of water as the ""Lac"", but I won't complain about the quantity or quality of the 'eyes. Check out 5 Lakes, Bud and Melinda will take care of you right. Craig"
556221,Guest,2006-04-14 14:03:00,0,"Little Joe this is one of the easiest and safest ( for your boat) lakes systems and no guides needed you won't waste your money on Gullrock. 50 fish a day is bad day on the rock, if you can fish you'll catch fish, size & numbers"
556552,Guest,2006-04-26 14:02:00,0,"this is a great lake, we are there early to mid august and 100 fish days are quite common. with the slot on the lake, catching eyes over 20"" is not a problem and the pike get pretty big too!"

557055,sanmatt,2006-05-09 18:25:00,11,"We've been to the ""Rock"" for 6 straight years, and love it. Lots of 18-22 inchers plus trophies too. Two 28's and a 30 last year, and the year before we boated a 43,41,and 39 inch northerns in an hour one afternoon. Check with Lee Wright at Wright's Wilderness Camp, I see on his website he's advertising June openings. Matteye."
557085,Hump,2006-05-10 08:42:00,578,Wonder why he has June openings. I thought all of the camps are normally full during June?
