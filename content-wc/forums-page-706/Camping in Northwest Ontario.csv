Does anyone have any experience doing just such a thing? ""boyscout island"" on minnitaki is perfect, but Ive done that. Id like to find a place similar to it. If you have had any great experiences camping in that area Id love to hear where you were and what the experience was like. We are on Eagle lake, but looking to travel to nearby lakes, regardless of size. Thanks"
