I have used them in both instances above, and have landed fish solely on the stinger. But man, can those stinger hooks get messy and tangled. What do you guys think? I use them from time to time when I get frustrated with bringing the jig up with nothing but the top end of a crawler on it. Thanks!"

I like the Nipissing jigs that have the stinger already tied on with mono but I've only found them at bait shops around Lake Nipissing. Overall, I've had better luck jigging with stingers than without."
556342,Guest,2006-04-19 15:32:00,0,"I too have had luck on stingers catching a 240 pound idiot. As far as catching fish goes, if they are hitting good, I don't use a stinger. If I am on rocks, I snag up allot more with stingers, so I don't use them. Deep water jigging with a slow bite is the only time I use stingers. I use a half crawler and connect the front of the crawler to the jig and the back of the crawler to the stinger."
556343,Mohleye,2006-04-19 16:17:00,368,"That's my argument against stinger hooks, too. Some of the guys in my group can do enough damage with one hook. If they all started using stingers and crankbaits, we'd need a MASH unit."

557204,Guest,2006-05-13 18:36:00,0,"I only use stingers when the 'eyes are ""slow-biting""...just working their way up the crawler. Usually happens with unstable weather conditions. I use stingers that attach to the eye of the bait...not the kind that go over the hook. I also use the single hook stinger, not a treble. Learned long ago the trebles can hurt the fish and myself at the same time. Most of the 'eyes caught this fashion are in ""the lip"", so make sure your net man knows what their doing. Craig"
