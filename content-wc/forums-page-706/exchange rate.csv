556835,Guest,2006-05-03 15:32:00,0,has anybody been following the exchange rate lately? I read that by June the US dollar will be worth less then the Canadian dollar. That being said does anybody really care except the gas stations? iIstashed and extra grand away from the wife just for the trip so all that means is only 2 cases of Labby's and i'll take one accross the border with me. Might not be tucking any dollars at our overnight in Ft. Frances but I guess the exotic dancers will survive!

556840,bigfish1965,2006-05-03 19:42:00,3210,The predicted high from the two sites that I've seen get each prediction right over the last two years is the CAN$ going to $1.10. IT was then supposed to settle back down under $1.00.
556844,Guest,2006-05-03 20:42:00,0,"would it then be a good idea for those of us that need to pay in canadian money to get the money now? Going in late july early august to a canadian owned camp that prefers cash, no credit cards or personal checks for final payment."

If the trend were so obvious, the financial markets would already reflect that. Equal likelihood it well be up versus down."
557038,Guest,2006-05-09 12:05:00,0,There are many things under the sun that can confuse and confound the price of the loonie. Here's a couple of things you can chew on. The price of oil is on 3 year rise. Canada is a net exporter of oil to the U.S. The U.S. is a net importer of oil. The U.S. dollar will fall against most currencies but particularily against those with a positive foreign exchange. So it goes.
