557147,millerltman,2006-05-12 08:49:00,12,Has anyone out there fished Warrington Lake on the Ontario/Manitoba border. Going to Sportsmans Lodge in Red Lake June 15th and possibly to Warrington. Wondering if it's worth the extra money to fly in there for a couple of days?

He has been doing Red Lake and Sportsmans for a good number of years, the size and numbers of his pike are absolutely incredible. You may very well be so amazed with the quality of Little Vermillion that the outpost jaunt may be less of a consideration. My brother-in-law and I have Sportsmans on our short list...let me know how your trip goes!"
557173,millerltman,2006-05-12 14:35:00,12,"Thanks Willie, went to Sportsmans last year mid June and had a great time. 5 pike over 40"" and numerous pike from 34-39"". Would highly recommend it. Problem were the walleye, lots of numbers but no size. Largest we caught was 18"", here that Warrington has same quality of pike and big walleye."
