Walleyes, northern Pike, etc. I am going to do some carp bowfishing which should be fun but I would like to find some good fishing too while I am not in the treestand. Thanks for any help...."

My experience has been that the fishing is better when the weather has been stable-calm for several days. It's shallow and if it's been windy and the lake has been stirred-up the water is silty and the bite is off. My $.02.
