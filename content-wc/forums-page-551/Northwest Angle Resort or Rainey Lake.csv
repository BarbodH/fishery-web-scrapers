1167092,Busman,2010-02-08 07:41:00,146,Trying to make a decision on going to the Northwest Angle Resort on Lake of the Woods or Rainey Lake. Which has better fishing?
1167106,Outfitter17,2010-02-08 08:34:00,127,Try Stokes bay resort on Rainy Lake. It is at the far east end of rainy on the Canadian side. It is very remote and excellent fishing.

1167315,Nimstug,2010-02-08 21:39:00,2605,"I have not been to the Northwest Angle but have been on Rainy, both at the east end staying at Kettle Falls with my wife and the west end, staying at Camp Narrows with my son. We're making our third trip to C.N. this coming Labor Day weekend. It's an overlooked walleye fishery, with lots above the slot. Plenty of smallmouth and pike to keep you busy, too.The Camp Narrows area is not wide open. It has a lot of islands, bays and cuts where you can always get out of the wind if you need to. If you are looking for muskie, Rainy is not the lake for you. There is some muskie habitat but it is very limited. Have fun!NimstugThe physician can bury his mistakes but he architect can only advise his clients to plant vines. -F.L. Wright"
