Also I am curious about ice conditions regarding ice depths, driving on the lake with a full size chevy pickup. We will have an ATV and a snowmobile so I am also curious if ATV travel is possible. Just Will we need an extension for the auger? I have heard ice fishing has been a little slow. Any improvements? I guess any recommendations are welcome. I will be stopping by Pro-Am and buying lures, jigs and bait and will talk to Bobby...Thanks in advance for the input! Hawgeye"

1165893,Bandit,2010-02-03 20:05:00,140,"We are still traveling on the ice with 4x4 trucks or sleds ( ATV hard going right now ) Fishing is better on warmer weather days. I caught a 27 1/2"" & Boris caught 30"" Last weekend ( We fished for 4 hours only ) We used the Chalet Beach access. Head Hwy 9 North of Selkirk than turn Right on Rd 96 ( Chalet Beach Rd or on some GPS units they call it Shelly beach rd ) Head straight for 4-5 Kms to till you hit the lake. More fisherman to ask for help on west side of the Lake. Beacona Beach ( Balsam Bay Harbour ) Hwy 59 North past the pine falls turn off. Turn left at road 100 a local plows an access road onto the ice. Less fisherman on the east side. Pm me & I can send you some GPS waypoints"
