1167292,celticbass1,2010-02-08 18:36:00,67,"I have made up my mind, I am going to buy two, 2 piece rods, probably the Gander Mountain Guide Series as suggested, I've fished with them before and think they are not bad for the money. I will then keep both rods and have a couple of extras for people riding in my boat that don't have their own equipment. Thanks again for all of the thoughts and suggestions."
1166815,celticbass1,2010-02-07 05:31:00,67,"Going to Wollaston Lake Lodge in late June. Can anyone tell me what kind of fishing equipment they have for rent, how much it costs, and how they work the fishing tackle rental. Just found out it's going to cost $175.00 if I bring my own rods."
1166834,MoWalleyeguy,2010-02-07 06:44:00,409,I am guessing its costing $175 because you have LONG 1 piece rods? You can always buy some new 2 piece rods or call Wollaston and ask them about rods.
1166893,Glenman12,2010-02-07 10:52:00,762,"""Just found out it's going to cost $175.00 if I bring my own rods."" Did someone from Wollaston tell you this?..doesnt make much since under ""what to bring"" on their website it says rods 6'6 and bigger for northern and lake trout.."
1166897,celticbass1,2010-02-07 11:05:00,67,"Mo, correct assumption that I have nothing other than one piece rods so Delta Airlines charges $150 for the size rod tube I would need. The reason I posted here rather than e-mailing Wollaston is that I sent them an e-mail about four days ago and they haven't responded. Probably too cold to type up there LOL. I really don't want the expense of buying new rods (2 piece) just for one trip. I would probably never use them again. This trip is paid for by someone else, so don't assume that because I'm going here I can afford to go buy two new top of the line two piece rods. Thanks"
1166917,AllenW,2010-02-07 12:20:00,11482,"Not sure how many rods ya need, but if its just a couple for one trip, I'd find a couple cheaper rods to use, you can pick up a couple 2 piece rods for under a $100 easily.Al"
1166918,tackleman,2010-02-07 12:20:00,444,"why would you have to buy top of the line 2 piece rods, I'm sure you could get cheap ugly stiks that would more than handle the fish up there for around 30 dollars."
1166978,Opti-Mist,2010-02-07 17:22:00,1402,Not a thing wrong with Ugly Sticks.
1167013,oldblue2008,2010-02-07 21:24:00,313,"I fished the south end of Wollaston a couple of times, and the surrounding smaller flyout lakes for years. I used a 2 piece ugly stick and a mitchell 300 reel with 12 lb test and caught dozens of pike in the 17-24 lb range, so I have to agree, get a couple of 2 piece rods, and have fun. A lot of guys fish Wollaston with fly rods for big pike. don't forget the black flies!!"
1167224,celticbass1,2010-02-08 15:18:00,67,"I am taking your suggestions under consideration. I just heard back from the lodge yesterday and found out that rental for equipment is $20.00 per day which includes rods, reels, and a tackle box. If you loose a lure you replace it. So that's a possibility as well. Thanks for the advice."
1167231,Northern Exposure,2010-02-08 15:37:00,29,"Either way you are going to have over $100 into this. If money is tight I would buy a couple of Gander Mountain Guide series 2 piece rods. When you get back you could sell them on ebay and get something back. Still a cheap trip to where you are going, good luck."
