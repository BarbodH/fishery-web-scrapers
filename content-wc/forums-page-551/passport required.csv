Just bring a birth certificate. An unexpected early spring ice fishing trip has suddenly hatched and now we are scrambling with last minute preparations"
1167827,Outfitter17,2010-02-10 12:48:00,127,"You are suppose to have one to re-enter the US, that being said I live in I. Falls, and I have 2 US custom agents as neighbors and they have both told me numerous times that if a person does not have a passport and they are US born with proper ID (DL lic., birth cert.) - the US customs can not deny that person entry. (You can not be denied entry to your home country as long as you have a proper ID that they can check to prove your citizenship."
1167854,cast_and_blast,2010-02-10 14:12:00,1098,"That may be true (that they can't deny you entry back home), but I would guess that the process will be lengthy and unpleasant. Not worth the hassle and delay IMHO. You're supposed to have a passport - you can get one and pay and extra $35 or so to have it expedited. Scott"

1167915,MoWalleyeguy,2010-02-10 16:55:00,409,"Aint that the truth... there are very pleasant Customs Agents that make the crossing great and then there are ones that are just ""pudding heads"" and act like your just ruining there day, so they feel like ruining yours...and man can they ever!"

1167959,SimilarIsland,2010-02-10 19:49:00,121,"Last year, because of some circumstances beyond his control, my fishing partner crossed back to the US from Canada in June and again in September without a passport. In June, they pretty much waved him through with only a Birth Certificate (lost his walltet). In September, they made us get out of the truck and go inside for about 15 minutes, then let us go on with only a Drivers license. I had my passport."
1167987,bpetersen,2010-02-10 21:02:00,251,My wife sent in for her passport last fall and it only took 3 weeks without the extra fee for faster service. You have time to get yours unless your planning on standing on ice to do your early spring fishing.
