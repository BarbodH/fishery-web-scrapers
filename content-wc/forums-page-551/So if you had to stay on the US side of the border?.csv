1163144,prov1900,2010-01-25 14:17:00,544,"I would 2nd/3rd Kabetogama. My only comment is if you roll the dice and cant get through, how do you plan on getting into a resort, any resort...or all of them...that may be booked up? Tell the kid that 21 year olds do what 21 year olds do...and that it won't haunt him forever. Too many times people put too much emphasis on a ""glorified"" traffic ticket. This comes from a police officer, yours truly, for what it's worth. Glad, like everyone else, that you are going to go with him regardless."
1163153,Reelcranky,2010-01-25 14:42:00,31,I believe they will still allow your son to cross by having to purchase a tempory citizen card for a fee which will allow him to to cross the border even with the DUI on his record. I am not sure of the total cost but I would call Canada customs and they will give the actual details and the cost. I had a employee go thru this by purchasing this temp card 2 summers ago on his family fishing trip to Ontario when they were crossing and his only option was to turn back or pay the fee. His DUI had happened back in the 90's and it still shows on the computer. They were crossing into Ontario at SSMarie bridge.
1163167,Guest,2010-01-25 15:33:00,0,"I agree with the above. If you take the chance at the border and they say no, how will you get into any US resort that is good? More importantly, what message are you sending to your son? I applaud your decision to stick with him and help him grow, but now do the next step and have him fill out the paperwork and get approval to go into Canada 100% legally. Yes it will cost some cash, but that is still part of the education this lesson is providing him. As to glorified ticket, any officer that says a DUI is a glorified ticket without knowing any details is either not a very good officer or not an officer. Ask an officer that sees the havoc that a DUI induced wreck can cause on a family, a business, on lots of lives. I am not saying that that many of us have not driven when we should not have, too many of us have. But witness one wreak where the parents of a youngster are killed by a drunk and you would never say its a glorified ticket. Good luck with your fishing adventure and I again applaud your efforts to keep your son on the right path. Never easy to be a parent as it means trying to teach good lessons every day, which is very, very hard....IA Walleye"
1163177,Larry Mac,2010-01-25 16:06:00,530,"Hi Go Dart, I agree with the previous responses that if there is a way to correct the challenge with the proper paperwork by all means attempt that first and foremost. Wherever you and you son end up have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1163179,go dart,2010-01-25 16:14:00,77,I agree this shouldn't haunt him forever and this happened when he was 18. Yea the lodges being all booked up is a huge concern which is why I've got to have at least a few to call. (STRESS) What ya gonna do huh? I ain't gonna kick him in the snutz. He's grown alot since then. We'll have a heck of a week somewhere.
1163181,go dart,2010-01-25 16:19:00,77,If only we had to pay for and get the temp rehabiliated card. Requires 5 yrs after drivers liscence reinstatment and cost $240.00. Less than 5 yrs and it cost $750.00 and takes 8 months to a year. Well ole dad ain't having that kinda year and we don't have that kinda time and there are no guarntees. Honestly every man here would enjoy fishing with him. He's great and the student has passed the master.
1163191,go dart,2010-01-25 16:33:00,77,"As to glorified ticket, any officer that says a DUI is a glorified ticket without knowing any details is either not a very good officer or not an officer.

But witness one wreak where the parents of a youngster are killed by a drunk and you would never say its a glorified ticket. Not gonna argue with this kind of logic because he's really right but the real world part of it is he's already been punished, fined, drug/alcohol tested for a yr ($25.00 ea), wasn't hired at Cabela's, payments to a atty, brutal insurance rates, and pretty much made to feel like he's a bad person. Thats not good for anyones mental health. You sound like you've even driven impaired before, just didn't get caught. Drunk driving is wrong, we can all agree. Cell phones probably cause more accidents. The kid is not a criminal."
1163256,prov1900,2010-01-25 18:43:00,544,"Thanks Go Dart. I didn't mean to offend anyone by referring to the DUI as a glorified ticket, but what else can you call it? It is a traffic offense. Certainly it is a ""big one"", but there are alot of other crimes that people commit on a daily basis that go above and beyond a ""traffic"" ticket. As far as being referred to as a ""not a very good cop"" or not at all, I guess I can leave that up to you, however I will say that you probably don't know who I am or what I've done in my career, for the betterment of the community, county, state, and country. I too have seen the ""havoc"" on the highways and am in no way downgrading the charge. I have arrested many, many drunk drivers that didn't kill anyone and they all had that moment during the arrest that they thought it was the end of the world. It really isn't, believe it or not. I know cops that are probably some of the best cops on the planet, as far as I'm concerned, that got DUI's when they were young, prior to their career. Clearly they have learned their ""lesson"" and got past the TRAFFIC TICKET."
1163261,Guest,2010-01-25 18:53:00,0,"Yes, I agree sometimes it seems as if the punishment does not fit the crime. But if what he has had to deal with for the last couple of years is the worse that he must go through for the rest of his life, then the lesson has been taught and his life after this will be great. A kid in our town got pinched for DUI when he was 18. Lesson not learned, arrested for DUI at the age of 19, after he killed two of his best friends after crashing the car while drunk. Now he gets to spend nearly the next decade of his life in jail for manslaughter and he has to live with what he did to two families forever. In a small town like ours, his whole family has to deal with the looks and stares from everybody for quite some time. The latter is not fair, but it is reality. Dart, good luck with all your doing. My comments were not really directed at you, but rather to somebody who basically said policer officers consider DUI's glorified tickets. I will bet lots of money that the vast majority of them consider them very seriously as the DUI's they issue are most often one of two types (a) first time offenders who because of the cost/rehab never get another ticket; or (b) hibitual offenders who are are going to cause an accident before their driving days are over. In the first case the ticket is worth the writing because it saves lots of problems and in the second case, if they get enough you can get them off the road (or at worse in prison when they continue).. To all have a great fishing season and remember, the extra beer or ****tail is great, but only after we are off the water and home for the night. The world can change in a New York minute and there are no do-overs.....Cheers...IA Walleye"
1165513,your bobbers under,2010-02-02 17:59:00,1,Deer Horn Resort on Kabetogama. Ask for Frank House as a guide for a day or 2. Great guy and Fishernan.
1163650,Stu,2010-01-26 23:20:00,472,"We had a similar problem. 2 of our guys had old DUI's and our group dwindled from 18 to 6. Our core group still goes to Ontario, but the rest of the guys went to the Northwest Angle. It is actually in Canada on LOW, but there is a boat shuttle that will take you to the cabin so from what I understand, you don't have to cross the border. Contact the Island Passenger Service (218) 223-5015, they can provide you detailed info. Here are a couple links:http://www.northwestangleresort.com/index.html This is the resort they chose - pretty cheap, $625 for a cabin, boat, gas and bait. This link will get you to all of the resorts:http://www.lakeofthewoodsresorts.com/resorts.html They actually fish Canadian waters so you have to buy a Canadian fishing license, but it seems like a good compromise. Good luck - Stu"
1163691,Larry Mac,2010-01-27 07:02:00,530,"Hi Go Dart, I was also going to suggest The Northwest Angle as Stu did. I was not sure if you have to cross the border to get to it. Arnesens is another resort up there and LOW is a remarkable fishery. Have a great trip wherever you end up.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1163730,JDP,2010-01-27 08:29:00,1457,To get to The NW Angle by driving you do go through Canada/Manitoba then back into the U.S./NW Angle.
1163800,Guest,2010-01-27 12:05:00,0,"Actually, you can get to the angle by boat also and never enter Canada."
1163861,JDP,2010-01-27 15:16:00,1457,"Yes you can certainly get there by boat and never enter Canada, it may also be possible to fly there I seem to remember an area in the Angle that looked like a small air strip!"
1163867,go dart,2010-01-27 15:44:00,77,"hey Stu good to meet another Kansan on this board. Checked out those lodges and they look great. Nice find, thanks"
1164065,alanexpup,2010-01-28 10:13:00,278,"well you could go to the american part of lake in the woods, not sure if you have to go through canada to get there though."
1164119,Guest,2010-01-28 12:09:00,0,I have a couple guys in my group that may not get in if checked. The Angle looks good & I've fished out othe resorts there but always on the Canadian side. Is there good fishing on the US side near the angle?
1164271,go dart,2010-01-28 22:02:00,77,hey just in case. Lets cross one behind the other. You first!
1165283,Stu,2010-02-02 02:14:00,472,"Hey Go Dart, good to meet you too. Get hold of Mike Sirmanski (AKA Mike Kansas). He has formed a Walleye Club. They meet in Olathe. I drank a couple beers w/ them but unfortunately I work nights so I don't get to see them anymore. Let me know how you guys do this year. Regards - Stu"
1163274,Guest,2010-01-25 19:13:00,0,"One quick note, because Dart made a statement about cell phones vs drunk driving. According to data found from 2008 (last year there was good data reported), drunk driving cause 13,486 fatalities, where as fatalities attributed to poor driving due to the use of cell phones caused approximately 2,700 fatalities. The good and bad news is as follows, due to the strict enforcement of DUI laws and increased penalities, the number of fatatilies cause by drunk drivers is down from 26,173 in 1982. The bad news is fatalities due to cell phone usage is up from virtual 0 in 1982 to the number we now have. Sorry, to belabor the point, but the facts do not support the contention that cell phones are just as dangerous as drunken drivers. Dangerous yes, as dangerous, no. IA Walleye"
1163277,prov1900,2010-01-25 19:20:00,544,"What would be, and will be interesting, is to see where the stats will go with the advent of texting. Nothing more disturbing that watching someone text while they drive. I've even watched someone do it on a motorcycle one night, going down the 4 lane...texting!!!"
1163283,Guest,2010-01-25 19:30:00,0,"Prov1900 Thanks for your responses, I enjoy a good discussion as it forces me to think, review, and consider. You made a comment that I want to clarrify. The link below is the National Highway Transportation own data on accidents. In 2008, in the US there were 37,261 fatalities in the US of anybody using the highways and roads (including bicyclists). Of that number, the number killed either by drunk drivers or were the drunk driver was 23,317. The numbers are bit off from the first because of reporting issues. However, it is safe to say that 2/3's of all US traffic fatalities were caused by alcohol. The difference from running a red light is simple, the latter is an accident, while drunk drivers know they are drinking and everybody knows you cannot operate a vehicle under the influence as well as you can having not had a drink. The only people that argue that point is the drunk trying to find his keys. Below is the link that you can use to review the data. I did this research rather fast in the couple of minutes so I might be wrong. As my first boss told, never argue with passion alone, argue with passion supported by the cool might of data, peel the onion my boy to find the truth...Nuff said on this subject, now I have to go back to counting the days until I am on Lac Suel...

1163284,bob oh,2010-01-25 19:32:00,3936,"I think drunk driving is BAD but I also think preaching about it and the high and mighty attitude doesn't help solve the problem. I think if dart would just shoot his kid for making a mistake the rest of the ""never made a mistake"" crowd would be satisfied. The last thing I would worry about is what the Ontario gov't thinks about it. I would support the kid. help him recover from his mistake and take him fishing in the U.S."
1163288,Guest,2010-01-25 19:34:00,0,"Prov1900 My mistake, I looked to fast, the deaths due to alchol was 13,800, so only 1/3 of the deaths are due to alcohol. MY MISTAKE MEA CULPA. However, given that 1/3 are related to drinking when you compare that the number of miles driven every day and the number of chances we all have to make a mistake (missing a stop sign, losing control due to a deer, etc), the number remains very high. I am sure you are a great officer. I to know officer who consider the DUI a very important part of their day because while the armed robbery is rare (at least in my part of Iowa) the drunken neighbor who plows into their garage or worse, is not. Good fishing"
1163291,prov1900,2010-01-25 19:41:00,544,"Thanks for clarifying that...obviously as I sit here 6 feet from my Lund, in a seemingly hurricane force snowy wind outside, I need to go fishing as well. I did look at the stats about ten seconds after I posted my (praying to God my memory served me correctly stats) , I saw that as well and went ""Whew"". Bottom line, we are both right.

1163353,Gill,2010-01-26 06:55:00,129,"Ran into that situation a few years back and ended up at Nelsons Resort on Crane Lake Mn. Really nice folks and you have access to Namakan and Kabetogama as well. You might want to get a few resort phone #'s on a list you can then call if you get denied entry. Paid off for me. Try looking at resorts on Kabetogama. Finding a cabin might be difficult depending on when you are arriving. Ash Trail Lodge on the Ash River is a good launching pad to get to Kabetogama, Namakan, and a short mechanical portage to Rainy. Been staying there and fishing these waters for a few years now. Lots of islands and undevelped shore line. Good luck, Gill"

Depending on the date he may have one open for you.You have the Canadian feel while still in the states. Also VNP is right there also. International Falls is only 40 minutes away.Ash River leads to Kabatogama and Namakin both. At the narrows turn left for Kabatogama and right for Namakin. He rents boats also. You may want to ask what he has, he has several different sizes to choose from. Nice thing is no matter which direction or how strong the wind blows you can always fish somewhere.He also has a couple tent sites if all else fails. Showers and bathroom are available so tents wouldn't be the absolute end of the world.PM me if you need anything else. I have a seasonal there and may be around when you come there."

1163273,prov1900,2010-01-25 19:11:00,544,"IA Walleye..I don't mean to keep beating the dead horse, but I think I made myself clear in both of my posts. I hope you can re-read them and try to understand what I am saying. Drunk drivers have killed lots of people, speeders, stop sign violators, and other ""traffic"" offenders have killed their share too. Should we give the other traffic violators who have killed people a free pass because they weren't drunk at the time? We have all sped, driven drunk, and ran stop signs, hopefully without killing someone, or for that matter been caught by the law and ticketed. Cops go out on the streets with a fervor and do not ignore people driving drunk. It is a ""glorified"" ticket because everyone pats you on the back when you get a drunk driver off the street. No one gives a carp if you write a speeding ticket. I can't quote statistics, but I would be willing to bet that if one could actually locate ""accurate"" stats, many, many more people have been killed by other traffic offenders, i.e. speed, stop signs/traffic signals/etc than drunk drivers. I know this because I learned it many years ago at the academy. Things haven't changed. You are right, there are tons of people out there that are repeat offenders. Eventually it will catch up to you. Just like the rest of us, if you speed, run traffic control devices, and drive drunk enough, you will get caught and/or hurt someone. I am sorry for the families that lose loved ones because of moments of poor judgement. I have on many occasions been the ""bearer of very bad news"" to those families."
1162956,go dart,2010-01-24 21:57:00,77,Ugg we got a DUI problem with our group heading to Canada this year. Guess we'll try rolling the dice but has anyone have a recremendation for lodges on the US side if we have to shift gears last minute? Thinking Rainey or Lake of the Woods. Appreaciate any heads up as we would still need to rent boats along with a cabin. Thanks

1163025,counterguy,2010-01-25 07:55:00,84,"Definately Kabetogema. The lake reminds me of the lake I go to in Canada, Lac Seul. Lots of Islands and undeveloped shoreline. Oh, the fishing is awesome too. Wallys, Smallys, and Pike."
1163034,JayM5209,2010-01-25 08:17:00,1050,"Just my opinion, and I appreciate the group's commitment to change plans, if necessary, to keep everyone together, but I wouldn't abandon plans for a Canada trip and stay in the U.S. because one member got a DUI. Travel with an extra vehicle. If the person with the DUI is turned back at the border, he has a car to go fish from a bridge somewhere. The rest of the group goes to Canada for a week as planned. No reason the group has to pay for one person's dumb move.Oh, too.....knowing the rules about past violations of the law and entry into another country, why would anyone opt to ""roll the dice"" at the border crossing???"
1163040,camp chef,2010-01-25 08:42:00,915,I would try Rainey....Island view lodge and cabins is where we stay on the way up.We have not fished there before but have seriously considered it. Check out their website. I applaud your decision not to break up your group.Somethings are more important than WHERE you end up fishing.
1163041,JDP,2010-01-25 08:47:00,1457,My choices would be: 1) Rainy Lake 2) Lake of the Woods (smaller rental boats can be a huge challenge given the open expanse on the MN side of LOW - Charter boats are available though) 3) Red Lake 4) Leech Lake 5) Mille Lacs - charter boats/launches are available
1163067,go dart,2010-01-25 09:54:00,77,"Actually its a little more complicated than that. The DUI is my 21 yr old son. I've insisted the rest of the group (6) continue to the Canadian lodge, I'll hang back with my son if necessary. Won't bore you with details but it was a difficult time for him, we've healed and I'm in his corner. Fishing is the one thing that has helped hold us together. His maturity the last 15 months has made him a new man. Why not roll the dice, we wont lie if asked and this seems fairly common. We would appreaciate a few US lodges to research. thanks for the replys"
