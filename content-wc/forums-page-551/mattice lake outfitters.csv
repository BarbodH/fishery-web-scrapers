1128296,Jig Man,2009-08-12 11:56:00,95,"My vote would be 1 Whitewater (Lodge) 2 Kag (Outpost) 3 Ogaki Reservoir (Lodge) I would stay away fron the small outpost lakes if you are looking for trophy pike, you may get one but not as likely."
1128300,jigman 2003,2009-08-12 12:13:00,981,"I've only fished Vick, Pringle (3 years) and Ogoki (2 years) so I can't speak for the others. Of those three Pringle produced the most large pike for us. Vick had by far the most numbers of pike in the 30-37"" range. We caught very few pike of any size on Ogoki (okay by us) but given the size of the water and the forage base, there has to be some pigs in there. If you choose Ogoki bring LOTS of jigs. Loads of nice walleyes and WOOD."
1128302,deputy dog,2009-08-12 12:16:00,305,def want outpost ie. only camp on lake
1128304,jigman 2003,2009-08-12 12:39:00,981,"Then that would rule out Whitewater, Ogoki, Kag (MLO only has one cabin here but there are other outfitters on the lake), and Short (Short is on Ogoki but is pretty far removed from the other camps). I can't help you with anything other than Pringle and Vick. There used to be a guy on here who used the handle Ogoki. I believe he's fished a fair number of MLO's single cabin lakes but haven't seen him on here for awhile. I can tell you that of the two single cabin lakes I've been on, I'd pick Pringle. I think if I was planning a trip based on catching decent pike and good walleye fishing(and wanted a single cabin lake with no other outfitters) I'd go with MLO's new camp. Can't remember lake name right now. Big water where the camp is and sounds like pike/lakers is the main target on the lake, but there is a very easy portage to a smaller lake near the camp which is supposed to have great walleye action."
