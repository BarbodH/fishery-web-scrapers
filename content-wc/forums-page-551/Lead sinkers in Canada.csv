1167778,SalSinkers,2010-02-10 10:44:00,9,Is it true that lead sinkers must be over 1/2 ounces to be legal through out the country or does this only apply for national parks?
1167796,LeeMB,2010-02-10 11:28:00,83,I can only speak for Manitoba and lead sinkers are legal here for now.........
1167829,Outfitter17,2010-02-10 12:49:00,127,Haven't heard that for ontario either? Where did you get your info from?
1167935,tackleman,2010-02-10 18:25:00,444,From the 2010 Ontario regulations:Lead Sinkers and Jigs: It's illegal to use or possess lead fishing sinkers or jigs in Canada's national parks and wildlife areas. Further information is available athttp://www.cws-acf.ec.gc.ca/flf-psp/index_e.cfmhope this can help but it appears to me that lead is allowed anywhere EXCEPT national parks.
1168128,Bluff,2010-02-11 11:28:00,152,It looks like both National Parks and Wildlife Areas ban lead sinkers and jigs. But it does not include Provincial Parks unless I am reading the regulation incorrectly.
