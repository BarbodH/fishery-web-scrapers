If so, what band would the resorts routinely monitor or does each resort monitor a different band.Also, I carry flares in my boat plus a flo orange flag. But, wonder if it is legal to use signal flares on Woods? ThanksBob"
1164874,rg,2010-01-31 13:54:00,9,Reel-em Inn lodge is out there on Alexandria Island on the south side of little traverse and on the northeast side is Spruce Island Camp on McPherson Island. Not sure if those resorts monitor marine band but use channel 16 for emergency use and hopefully someone will be listening. If your in distress don't hesitate to use your flares.
1164888,Ia Walihntr,2010-01-31 15:11:00,320,"Not sure about Reel-Em-Inn, but Spruce Island Camp monitors channel 68."
1165601,bob888,2010-02-03 05:20:00,244,"Thanks for the info.Mylie's, if I recall correctly also monitors channel 68. Perhaps that is universal in the area.I wonder if Grassy Narrows in Miles Bay and Obabikon Bay resort also monitor channel 68"
1165656,Obabikon,2010-02-03 07:58:00,2370,"That's the channel I use, but I don't monitor it very well. Especially now that cell phones work perfectly. All that said, if you get in trouble out there, have Mylies Place call me and I'll be happy to help."
1165962,bob888,2010-02-04 05:24:00,244,Thanks Obabikon. Over the past couple of years I have appreciated your fishing updates and other posts as I'm frequently in your area.You mentioned cell phone coverage. I'm with Verizon. A Verizon rep stated to me recently that their coverage in the Morson area was spotty. Based on their coverage locator I would tend to agree.Do you or others have an experience with Verizon cell service in the areas west of Sunset Channel? Or what cell service is providing the best coverage in that general area. Thanks.
1165981,Obabikon,2010-02-04 06:45:00,2370,"I have Verizon. You get excellent service from the tower in Morson (which was converted to digital in January of 2009). I get service from Thompson's Creek to Carribou lake. But, if you don't pay for the North America Plan, it's like .70 cents a minute. You can add the plan for a month, and it's $10. No brainer for me, but if you monitor channel 68, you'll be fine."
1166202,aggie kolisnik,2010-02-04 17:43:00,39,We are located at the mouth of saboshkoshing bay. Our place is called Bell Island Outpost. We are just across the bay from the old mcpherson fish camp(formerly owned by flag island) We welcome any fishermen and have had canoe paddlers stranded when the weather has picked up on the traverse as well. stop by and visit even if the weather is clear/calm. We are usually around before/after each group of guests come and go. We hope to see some new faces this summer. Aggie/Randy
1166261,Glenman12,2010-02-04 20:50:00,762,"Not to thread jack but just a FYI for everyone...our group is all from the Chicago area..some Sox fans and some Cubs fans...turns out that when we were up last year in the Perrault Falls area the Cubs were playing the Sox in interleague play..one guy had a Blackberry with Verizon service...he would often give us updates on scores, stats etc for those 3 days of that series...a few weeks after he got home he got a bill for $252.00 from Verizon and that was just for his use of the internet on his Blackberry.. those of us who used Verizon just for phone calls saw minimal spikes in our bills...so beware"
