553342,Trailerguy,2005-12-16 15:48:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Destroyer, You'd have had have been there, it's easy to poo-paw in ignorance. Ok, a large system with a large forage base? How are they really differant? What part of the system feeds the fish? Hatchlings move to shallows with weeds to begin there growth,feeding on other aquatic creatures. As they progress to fingerlings they still need weed beds and the like for protection. We've all seen the schools of ""baitfish"", they relate to structure which also attracts large fish for feeding binges. In the early years there is safetey in numbers. I might add that ""baitfish"" include perch,walleyes,whitefish,lake trout, and many other species. At some point in their life the walleye school begins to become the eating machine instead of the forage that is eaten, only then do walleyes progress to spending more and more time in deeper water, returning to shallower water to feed on the next generations of baitfish. Now I ask you this? Which part of the ""system"" is more important, deep open expanses of water, or structures that often lies in close proximity to shorelines? (I incude islands and the like as having shorelines.) Getting back to the ""BIG PICTURE"", do you think there is less shoreline in, for example the Cedar River sytem, than in Lac Suels system? Or are we really talking about the same things? Wouldn't it be true that ""big fish"" on Lac Suel are most frequently caught in certian areas that have more favorable conditions and sturcture? Why then isn't a small lake in a river system, just as likely to produce ""big fish"", for the same reasons, with the added benifit of little fishing pressure? IMHO most folks just don't recognize the potentials. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
553343,Guest,2005-12-16 16:23:00,0,"TrailerGuy, That is a wonderful summary of the walleye prey-to-predator life . . . a couple points I might pick away at if I were reviewing your comments for submission to a weekly township newsletter. Of course, the comments are far too generalized and lacking scientific integrity to ever be considered for much more. That is why I used the term ""research"" in my statement. Let me caution you that while many people on this board are weekend fisherman, with their one or two big trips a year up to Canadian water, there are also some (a couple of whom are following this thread) that are staring at the computer which sits on a desk surrounded by fisheries biology journal volumes. Now, like I said, there are plenty of small, isolated lakes which support 'some' big fish (and I'm not talking about a small interconnected lake attached to a large system, which essentially shares the characteristics of the system as a whole anyway). But most research demonstrates that a healthy, large population of big walleye, with an associated healthy population pyramid, is most often associated with a large water system and a large forage base! You catching a bunch of big fish on a small water body is not evidence to reject these findings, not at all. But I am keeping things simple by summarizing well-documented, biological findings. What would be the point to start discussing details of experimental design, statistical computation, etc.? If you're not convinced and you need references I'll hook you up and you can venture off to your local university library and pull out the results yourself. I'm not going to comment on the 45 minute fish tally thing . . . Destroyer's comments, while blunt, I think have it covered. NWO Fishing Bum"
553344,Trailerguy,2005-12-16 20:26:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]When you start talking statistics, the MNR has only begun to collect creel surveys in the last ten years on the smaller more remote lakes in the Cedar River system. In fact last summer I was told by one of their own that samples collected 7 years ago from a particular lake still lie in a freezer,in Winnepeg, awaiting anlisyis. Until that work is done there are no statistics that apply. If you pull a good set of maps: >a small interconnected lake attached to a large system, >which essentially shares the characteristics of the system as >a whole anyway). This is exactly what I'm talking about, these lakes are connected by significant moving water during the higher water times of the year, and over a period of time the genetics are shared through movement of generations of fish through the entire system. These watersheds developed after the last glacier. The time passed since the dam at Ear Falls impounded Lac Suel is hardly a heartbeat in that evolution. IMHO When the day comes that Lac Suel enjoys the same type of popularity and hard fishing that LOTW is now begining to see, these lakes will be the frontier, for big fish. Don't get me wrong here, I love what the popularity of this area has done for my property values. ;) Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

The problem most of the time on this board is if it didn't come from Lac Seul it probably isn't true. I don't see anybody bashing the guy that caught the 11 big fish there. The group I fish with catch plenty of 25-29"" on a small lake system with a river system attached. Also, last year we caught a 31.5"" although rare but our tape did work. I'm curious if some of the Lac Seul people are guides and resort owners to get more business. The question was What is considered a big walleye in Canada. My answer anything over 30""."

I read some where that a fish over 30"" in the north is like 14 years old. Here is a chart that I found it says a 11 yr old fish will be 23"" in the north.

1163804,kgeary,2010-01-27 12:13:00,88,"Great conversation.Good food for thought.Here is a bit more.I think a “big” walleye is relevant. It is in the eye (no pun) of the beholder.For some people and for some lakes a 25 -26 inch walleye is huge.From my experience I’ve found that most people say they’ve caught a big walleye when they catch anything over 28 inches. That seems to hold for 90% of the anglers whether they’ve fished for many years or just started. Also seems to hold true whether they’ve fished Canada or the U.S. A trophy walleye ( fish of a lifetime for most) is over 30 I don’t really want to get into a debate on whether any of you did or didn’t catch x # of 30 inch walleye.I can say that it definitely can be done, I’ve seen it.However if you want to question my measurements that is fine.I recall a day in July 2008 when we caught 9 from 26- 29 inches before lunch. I’ve fished structures coming out of the main lake basin where big walleye have huge schools of ciscoes hemmed in and spend hours feeding on them. I’ve watched them on the graph enough to know which ones are big ( 25-30 inches and beyond). They will make diagonal marks both angling up and down. When I’ve seen this I’ve typically caught several walleye from 25-28. I’m not sure I’d recommend fishing small lakes. I’d consider any lake less than a mile by a mile a small lake. I’ve fished hundreds of the them and seldom caught much over 26 inches. Most of the big walleye I’ve caught have been in lakes over 2x5 miles in size. Not that all large lakes can produce big fish. In general dark water lakes produce more numbers of big walleye. Although I had a spot on one clear water lake that would produce several 28-30’s almost every day ( and a bunch of 25-28)Can a small lake produce a 30 inch walleye? I’m sure it can.One of the biggest Pike I’ve caught was in a very small lake. In fact I was getting convinced there was no pike at all when I caught her. She was over 54 inches. I’ve caught literally thousands of pike over 40 INCHES but only about 10 over 50 inches. All but that one was out a big lake.I think it depends totally on the lakes you are fishing.I believe an anglers knowledge and inclination have a lot to do with it.Rule #1 go where the big fish are. Then if you have the knowledge and are actually in pursuit of big fish you will eventually catch big fish.I have seen experienced talented guys pull into the middle of a crowd of boats and pull 3 or 4 huge walleye out within a few minutes. Did it make them popular, NO. However I for one was impressed with their abilitiesOn another note.I’m not convinced you can analyze a photo and determine exactly how long a fish is.Unless you know the focal length of the lens, what size sensor ( if digital) etc. Too many variables. One thing to look out for is the straight arm.Look to see if the elvow is bent. More likely that the fish actually is big. I grew up fishing a lake where 3 people in a boat quite often could literally catch 300- 400 walleye in a day.The thing is they were all 14-16 inches. Don’t get me wrong this is also fun. I’ve been fishing Nungesser since 2005, The first week we caught a 32 incher. Each year since we’ve caught at least one over 30 inches. In 2008 Dennis Kellner caught a 32 incher. I watched him measure it. My daughter Seanna caught a 32 incher this past July. It was nice and fat , even the fins were thick. One of the things I’ve noticed most often is that all of the walleye over 30 (even most over 29) had zero blemishes, no broken fins, no hook marks. In other words they had never been caught before. Take a look at our photo albums and you’ll see lots of big walleye. We catch several hundred over 27 inches each season. Have had kids catch 29 inch walleye off the dock.o the short answer? I guess 28 inches is big 30 inches if a trophy. Does everyone catch one? No. Then again not everyone is fishing for a big Walleye.Bottom line they are all fun.Thankskg"
1163935,Angler Donny,2010-01-27 19:49:00,11,A trophy Walleye in my opinion is anything over 28 inches. The best place to find them in abundance is on Nungesser lake 30 miles NW of Red Lake Ontario. Nungesser has a tremendous fatty forage base that enables the Walleye and Pike to be in the TROPHY size and in great numbers. I have been fishing Nungesser for over 5 years and we always get a number of 28+ inch Walleye and 40+ inch Northern Pike. Even though it is close to Red Lake... It's like a fly in because of the rapids/waterfalls that prevent anyone comming in without the Lodges consent. It is a drive and boat in only with the Lodge. There are 2 main Lodges on the 27 mile lake and are owned by great families that will treat you right. I hope this helps you.

1164202,LeeMB,2010-01-28 17:38:00,83,"The Red River and Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba produce hundreds of walleyes over 28"" every fall and winter. We catch a lot of walleye's over 30"" here. Because of their fast growth rate and eggs, in Feb or March you can catch a 30"" that will weigh 12lb's.-14lb's. There are many guys who catch over 25 ""trophy walleyes"" (over 28"") here in the ice fishing season.The odd thing is very few people fish them in the summer. Lake Winnipeg is south basin is hard to fish and a lot of the fish head to the north end for the summer."

The largest walleye caught in our groups over the years have been (3) 28"" fish caught on different trips by different anglers. IMHO a 30"" walleye is a fish of a lifetime and also a true Canadian Trophy. The Master Angler Mark is set at 28"". I consider any Canadian Walleye 24"" or larger a big walleye.

553351,Guest,2005-12-17 18:40:00,0,"????OK . . . does that mean we agree? I know you said above that you have to disagree with the statement that big walleye can more often be attained from big water. My point has simply been that the majority of published research on that issue does in fact substantiate that claim. That's it! I never suggested you can't catch a big fish on Wabby, or in the Cedar River System, not at all. Furthermore, as you pointed out, that system is in fact a large system, linked to a huge system (Winnipeg River System), so your supporting what I said anyway. There will always be huge walleye caught in water people never thought would produce such a fish; there are anomolies to almost any relationship, but again, the majority of published research on large populations of big walleyes, with an associated healthy population pyramid, has been positively correlated with an increasing size of the lake or river system and an increasing volume of forage!! It's a proven, general trend. It's the ""theory"" if you will. I'm an academic, and thus I pay particular attention to theory. In practice, sure you are going to find examples which are not representative of the population as a whole. It's no different than saying the best walleye fishing is associated with a walleye chop (good wind) and low light conditions. I'm sure both you and I have had awesome days however, in mid-July, with a still calm, without a cloud in the sky, which in no way whatsoever fits that general trend. There will always be exceptions to the accepted theory. That's why it's called ""theory."" Open up an In-Fisherman, and what are they presenting? THEORY! Listen to the intro of a fishing show, and what are they talking about? THEORY! Theory is derived from research, be it formal, scientific research, or informal research where you are out fishing in a variety of different conditions and derive your own theory. And if your theory is that the best shot at catching big walleye is by fishing, small, secluded, unconnected water bodies, then great. All I'm saying is the majority of published research does not support that theory!! As a long-time user of this forum, I have witnessed you contribute plenty of good ideas, techniques, etc., Trailerguy, and I certainly respect that! I guess we just disagree on this one.

I can agree somewhat, but most people can't see the forest becuase of the trees. >if your theory is that the best shot at catching big walleye is >by fishing, small, secluded, unconnected water bodies, then great. The point you seem to miss is that many of these small, secluded, unconnected water bodies is that they really are connected to the larger system. While they likely aren't significantly connected year round, the key is that they are connected during high water periods. The parallel is that a small lake can be the spot on the spot in a large system, that the higher % of large fish are present in. And as far as Wabaskang goes, it does give up some large fish, but IMHO it is a better lake for numbers than size. I'm sure there are areas in Lac Suel to look for numbers, and others for large fish as well."

In Fisherman taught everyone to hold the fish out away from you towards the camera and hide your fingers and suddenly the six pounder is an eight. A good (human!) eye can tell by looking at the size of the scales and tail fin whether your leg is being pulled and about how much it is being pulled. Good discussion 'Bum and 'Guy. Oh yeah. Just to lighten up a little. I spoke with one of our guys and his father in law caught a 29"" walleye on a bank line while fishing for big cats in a small river (or big creek)just north of us.

In my experience it takes a permnant blockage of about 3' to stop a walleye from going upstream. However during the summer they leave shallow lakes, or shallow areas in lakes as the water becomes too warm and move up or downstream freely to cooler water.

553337,phishfearme,2005-12-16 11:34:00,1242,"tg - not sure i'd refer to seul as a single impoundment. lac seul certainly has numerous feeder streams and associated lakes, but since it's a reservoir, the level will fluctuate more than a natural system - but in general - other than the level fluctuation - it responds similar to a natural system in terms of spawning. i'm not sure about your point of fish going into flowage areas to cool off. the water comes off the surface of the upstream lake which is the warmest water. fish are around rapids and flow for the forage and oxygenization not so much due to temperature. i don't know about you but i've caught thousands of nice walleye around flowage areas but not many trophy size fish except where the flowage empties into a large deep lake. there's other key issues besides genetics such as lake depth, amount of lake depth (and thus temperature controlability) and forage base among others. larger lakes or systems typically provide easier temperature control for fish via depth changes and a much larger forage base - both amount and variety. my money is still on a large lake (system) for trophy fish. phish"
553339,Guest,2005-12-16 12:33:00,0,"Trailerguy, You're right in saying there are plenty of small lakes with huge walleye. I've caught many big eyes out of small, cut-off lakes myself, some coming from water where only a few year classes have survived and all the walleye are big. However, the research shows, that overall, in general (or as you say 'In the big picture') a healthy, large population of big walleyes can best be attained in a large system, where forage is plentiful.

553341,Guest,2005-12-16 13:11:00,0,"Trailor Guy....you are out-of-your-mind pal!! You generally have informative information to give on this board and i respect that so why would you exaggerate your fish so badly? There is a very little chance you actually caught 9 fish between 28""-32"" in 45 minutes. You need to either check your ruler, your eyes or fess up to the truth. Take a lesson from phishfearme and tell it like it is. I really respect him for telling us how many lakes he has fished and how many years he has tried without a 30""er. Catching one is a great privledge and it doesn't come easy. I guided a guy who lived on a lake in Minnesota and fished for walleye everyday for 45 years and his biggest ever was 25"". I was very pleased to raise that number to 28"" when he was finished. I have personally witnessed too many people who catch a fish, measure it (rather poorly), call it a 7 pounder and then proceed to catch 4 more that are bigger that they call 2 8lbs's a 9lb and a 10.5lb. When really the first one was 4 and the others were 5's a 6 and a 7.5. They are all nice fish but don't try to call them what they are not. I read an email statement from a person who had fished Lac Seul in the spring and claimed to have caught a 32"" 32.5"" 33"" and 34"" in a couple hours one morning. They were alledgedly caught from a spot where myself and the other guides had fished regularly for many years and we have pulled no such fish out. The odd 29 and some 28's but nothing of that magnitude. It was hard for me to believe one person would have such a fortuitous morning. There is no doubt Lac Seul could produce those 4 fish but the likelihood of it happening the way he said it did is not good. This does not apply to everyone, just those select few who unknowingly aim to ruin the credibility of fisherman. D"
553304,Trailerguy,2005-12-14 16:53:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I have to disagree with your anoligy that large fish come from large lakes. Large fish are older fish, as they age they tend to spend more time in dark water. That means deeper and more nocternal most of the time. Most people just don't know where to look. A small lake that has seen little fishing pressure raises large walleyes just as easily, as long as the genetics are present. One of the best experiences I've had was on a small lake that you could see the shoreline all around. It was spitting snow an hour before dusk, the two of us jigged up nine walleyes that ran from 28""-32"" in a 45 minute period. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
553306,phishfearme,2005-12-14 20:25:00,1242,"trailorguy - i admit that it's a generalization that big walleye come from big water but i think it's a pretty good one. you mention genetics and it's certainly a key item - bigger water simply has a bigger gene pool. your example of 9, 28/32"" walleye in 45 minutes is in my opinion an incredible feat worthy of the world record book - in ANY lake - and is the exception not the rule. i've been doing canada trips for over 25 years, have hit probably 100 virgin lakes, caught thousands of eyes (night and day) and have yet to catch a TRUE 30 incher. i do know if it were my goal to tie into a 30 incher, a small lake isn't where i'd go. do you mind ""spilling the beans"" as to what lake produced 9 trophys in 45 minutes? i wouldn't blame you if you told me it's proprietary - i would probably do the same thing!! congrats on a truly remarkable feat. phish"

553310,orchard frank,2005-12-14 23:10:00,1900,"I fished Lac Seul for over 10 years, often for 2 weeks at a time. I'm kind of a nut case when it comes to measuring fish, not to prove anything, just a habit. I NEVER caught a fish over 30"". Lots of 29""+, never broke through. Had a morning where we caught 11 fish between 27-29 1/2, but no 30's. Over the years, I'm sure we caught hundreds over 25, but 30's are tough. They are there, I've seen them, wife had one right to the boat that came undone (ever heard that one before?) By comparison, we had 8 fish over 30"" in the boat this year fishing the Bays de Noc area. Lac Seul is a GREAT fishery, as are many Canadian destinations, careful measuring will cut down on the 30's there or any place else. Not catching a 30 never hurt our trips one bit, some of the greatest times we have had has been on the Seul. Good Luck"

553260,Pooch,2005-12-11 19:19:00,4619,"Over the years we have made close to thirty trips to Canada. Fishing about a dozen different lakes from the Drydon area to the Nakina area to the Savant area to the Red Lake area. Most of these I consider the ""mid north"" area of Ontario. Seldom fish far enough south to get into small mouth areas. Each year the group picks up a couple walleye in the 28"" range. Only a couple that would ever be legitimate 30 inchers. Most in the 28"" range run about seven pounds on a Berkley digital scale. Not real plump because of the forage base I suppose. We catch lots and lots of four to five pounders but the elusive over 28-30 inchers is a challenge. We are thinking about moving a little further south into the more congested areas for a few trips just to hunt larger walleye. (Not quite as far south as Greer's Ferry though!) We like the seclusion of the more northern lakes but think a change of location might be interesting for a few trips. What do you folks think are considered big walleye for the different regions? The Rainy Lake area seems to produce some good fish as does Lac Seul along with numreous other smaller lakes in that latitude. Many people fish these lakes so odds are there will be more large fish caught and reported. Any thoughts? Pooch"
553261,phishfearme,2005-12-11 19:59:00,1242,"pooch - a very interesting question. point 1: large fish? large lakes! point 2: large lakes? many more cabins/lodges and less isolation. our group prefers isolation so we end up at smaller lakes all to ourselves so our opinion of ""large"" is no doubt different than a lac seul opinion. a TRUE 2-footer (ie; a football!) to us would be a large fish. a trophy walleye in our opinion would be a TRUE 27/28 incher. since the vast majority of trophys are released as rapidly as possible (at least i hope so), i would bet that there's an inch or two or three ""bias"" towards the longer side during the quick measurement. (how many of us carry a measuring ""bump box"" to get an accurate measurement?) and then the length may grow another inch or two as the week progresses. but i guess that's part of the fun. just remember: all fishermen are liars, except for you and me, and i'm not so sure about you!! phish"
553263,grt1,2005-12-12 07:26:00,259,"In the Red Lake system, generally anything over 27"" is considered to be ""big""."
553266,Bill Krejca,2005-12-12 09:25:00,6107,"For the last 3 years, we have driven to Wekusko Falls Lodge near Snow Lake, Manitoba, and fished Tramping Lake. Every year, we caught a number of fish 28"" or better, to receive a Master Anglers award. Last year, of 6 people, 4 of us got a fish 28"" or more. My best was a 30"", a fat, true 10+ pounder. The rules for the lake are set that any walleye over 22"" must be released. This type of limit, plus the absence of commercial fishing is generally what provides for larger fish,in my opinion. Waters that do not regularly produce the big girls seem to have less strict regulations, i.e., for years its been OK to keep the big fish, or some type of size selective commercial netting is going on, maybe in the winter. It has been my observation that on the lakes with which I am familiar within maybe 800 miles of the border, the shorter warm season does not appreciably act as a deterrent to growing the biggies, at least up to 10 pounds. The other above factors definitely do."
553267,Guest,2005-12-12 09:35:00,0,"If you are fortunate enough to catch a Walleye over 30"" you have a Trophy. It would be interesting to know how many fisherman have caught Walleye over 30"" compared to under 30"". The 30"" rule applys to 99% of the Canadian water. During the fall of the year there are several places that a 30"" Walleye is a dandy but over 30"" is a trophy. Red River/Pine Falls would be one of these exceptions and Im sure there are others that Im not familiar with. I have fished Canada for over 40 years and gone on at least two trips a year and I have only seen a dozen or so 30"" plus Walleye, not counting the Red River/Pine falls area. I figure with all the guys on our trips that represents over 32,000 man hours of fishing or 2,560 man hours of fishing per 30"" plus fish. That's a Trophy in my book. We do catch our fair share of 26""/27"" Walleye but they are much more common than the 30"" Hogs."
553268,Guest,2005-12-12 10:55:00,0,30 inchers or 10 plus lbs. are my cut line. anything close is awesome but i get real happy with the 10 plus lbers. They are hard to find though unless you fish lakes and rivers where there will be lots more people.
