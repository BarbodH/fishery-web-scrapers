1162165,Northern Manitoban,2010-01-21 20:23:00,195,"I would like to Fish Kasba lake for lakers, been some huge fish coming from that lake, back to Snowbird my friend guided Gapen did not enjoy guiding him, he mentions lakers grouping together on the surface what a site he said, I have seen that once many years ago it was amazing happend in the evening as the sun was setting, My friend said it was the Natives netting and that the lodge let all there guest take all the big fish they wanted back then. and he also mentions the guides were not very good, except himself lol, I talked with one of the owner or lodge managers at Snowbird back in the late 90's he said the same thing lodhe was only open so long but he told me they only book so many anglers a year and that is it, as he wants the lake to stay good for fishing, I figure if you have proper regulations there you should be able to handle alot of anglers considering the size of Snowbird. And when I asked about that world record laker he said they were going to post the entire photo and not half of it, that i see never happend, i think this place is run not very well from what i see and hear, its to bad especially for the prices they have."
1166938,MidWestFishman,2010-02-07 13:44:00,44,"I visited the snowbird outpost about 7 years ago and was very disappointed. The fishing was above average in numbers but no real size. Lake trout were 3-8 pounds. The food from the mini lodge was excellent. The facilities were terrible. The cabin leaked profusely when it rained. They constantly ran out of water in the holding tank for flushing toilets and sink water. The floor was sloped noticeably. In the bathroom when you sat down on the stool the urinal was only about 18 inches from your head on the opposite wall. We did have a blast reading all the messages written on the wall of the cabin about the poor conditions. The guides in camp kept refering to the owner as Chief Walking Eagle. Finally after a few days we asked why he was clled that. Their response: ""Because he is so full of s**t that he can't fly"" That about sums it up I think. Surfing the web I also found out that the lodge is up for sale. I hope the new owner takes better care of it. Oh.. the guides were great folks. If you are going that far North try Tukto Lodge- I had fantasic fishing there and the facilities are much nicer."
1159575,sptrix,2010-01-11 20:47:00,175,I'm wondering if anyone here has fished North of Sixty Camps?SPTRIX
1159675,Guest,2010-01-12 09:21:00,0,"We have not fished with them yet,but hope to do so in the near future.I have spoken with them over the phone and Snowbird Lake will probably be our destination.Trophy trout and monster pike,sounds great."
1159835,Guest,2010-01-12 21:00:00,0,"I stayed there about 10 years ago, the service was bad and very unorganized. The fishing on the other hand was great! Very good lake trout and northern fishing. We fished on Snowbird lake. I would still go back, the fishing was so good. Stay on the very North end of Snowbird, there was 2 camps on the lake when we were there, we had to boat a long way to fish the north end of the lake. At the time the North camp was not open or we could not get in. Almost constant doubles on lake trout, and many dandy northerns."

1160075,Guest,2010-01-13 21:57:00,0,"My largest northern was 45"" and largest trout was 25#. Our Guide had only been on the lake 5 days longer than us. Many of the best places we fished, he had never fished before. There were a couple groups of fisherman that had very good guides and they were able to get pike up to 48"", and had quite a few trout over 30#. We had many doubles for lakers, and quite a few triples. Most of the pike were in very shallow water on the very north end of the lake. Cast your lure out, as soon as it hit the water you would see a big wake as the fish would charge at your lure. Great Fishing!"
1160141,sptrix,2010-01-14 08:40:00,175,Thanks for the report. I really appreciate it.Steve
1161711,Northern Manitoban,2010-01-20 09:25:00,195,"I have a freind that guided at Snowbird back in the 80's tells me stories of some huge Lakers, he also fished the Kazan river caught his biggest Greyling there, he mentions that back then many anglers came in and took lots of fish out and that there was netting also, we thought a few times on going there as my friend knows the lake half decent, I have heard many reports on bad service there over the years, I asked the lodge about there supposedly world record laker that was caught there and never got a report as the picture was half picture, and I notice never any updated pictures from last I seen on there site, you would figure a lodge that supposedly has a world record fish would brag about it, with pictures?"
1161850,Guest,2010-01-20 17:16:00,0,"What really got me interested in Snowbird Lake was an article I read in midwest outdoors magazine (august 2001 edition) written by Dan Gapen.In the article he states that him and his fishing companions caught lakers nearly at will around a place called ""The Rock Pile"".A large rocky outcropping streching some 3-4 miles into the lake about half way up the western shore.Some 30 trout were C+R in a short time frame,running from 16#-32#.The article also talks about an array of shallow weedy bays on the eastern shores containing ""log like"" northerns that stack up in the afternoon hammering anything that moves.Anyway,It's a cool article and really caught my attention."
1161947,sptrix,2010-01-21 04:11:00,175,"I spoke to the owner a week ago. He said that until about 5 years ago, he wasn't involved in running the business and that he had a number of issues so he decided to get involved.He mentioned that they are only open for 4 - 5 weeks each summer. When I questioned why, his response was that it was to preserve the fishery because he didn't think it was healthy to be bringing in trout from deep water. Made some sense on an environmental level, but it seemed not to make sense on a business level.He claimed there has never been any commercial fishing there.He did mention that they have had some issues with natives over the winter related to them killing animals and leaving them on their runway.Has anyone else fished there?"
1162149,sptrix,2010-01-21 19:20:00,175,I'd be interested in hearing some suggestions about where to go for comparable money . . . Thanks!
