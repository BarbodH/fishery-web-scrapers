1159305,scar,2010-01-10 19:05:00,196,I have only been able to find info on what types of identification can be used for a U.S. citizen to re-enter the U.S. from Canada. My question is can I use an enhanced drivers license to enter Canada instead of a passport.
1159311,northern walleye,2010-01-10 19:20:00,152,I know you can enter the US with an enhanced Ontario Drivers licence instead of a Passprt. One would presume you could enter Canada with a enhanced US drivers licence but I would first check before attemtping to cross the border. For some unknown reason they seem a little picky these days about border crossings i wonder why?. Call Canadian Customs to find out before you come across would be my advice.
1159469,Seanik,2010-01-11 14:46:00,218,"Only 4 states issue enhanced drivers license's, New York, Vermont, Michigan and Washington State. If your from another state you will need a pasport or the card to re-enter the US."
