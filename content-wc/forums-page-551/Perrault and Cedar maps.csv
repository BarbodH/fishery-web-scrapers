1165475,DaveZ,2010-02-02 15:52:00,5,Are there any decent maps available for Perrault or Cedar? Looks like I'll be making a trip to the area this summer for the first time in maybe 10 years and I was hoping there would be some better maps available. So far I haven't been able to find anything but the same stuff that was around 10 years ago.

I have several maps from them and they are really fun to own. Their selection has some limitations, but my guess is that the lakes you seek will be available. Good fishin' Doc Lee"

1165713,Glenman12,2010-02-03 12:10:00,762,"We've been up the Ord many times..a few of our ""explorers"" a few years back too it south out of St Clair..after a little way theres a dammed up part that is impassable...our whole group went there two years ago and fished the falls area created by the dam and it was great..not in size but in numbers..I know that on Google Earth it looks like you can keep going to the other lakes but, unless something has changed or we missed something, you cant"
