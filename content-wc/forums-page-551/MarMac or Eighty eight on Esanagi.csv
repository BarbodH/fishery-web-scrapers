My first year which was 2008, I stayed at lodge 88. We opted to fly in rather than trian in and the flight was 5 hours late due to them being disorganized on the various fly out times. The guide was horrid. He was a young kid about 20 and did not have a fish finder and could not put us on the fish. He said this was his second year guiding which I found out was a lie. One day we started out and he forgot the extra gas so we had to turn back and wasted 45 minutes of fish time due to his negligence. Another day he forgot the stringer. After 4 days of catching only 6-10 fish a day between my daughter and I, he was demoted to a dock hand. The owners were always at the dock at the end of every day to ask how the day went. They could tell that we were not happy so for the last 3 days of our trip were were given a guide named Bob. Bob was great! we were catching fish and my daughter got a 8 lb walleye. Bob knew the lake like the back of his hand. At the end of the week we were refunded the guide fees for the first 4 days and the fly-in charges! That was more than fair. I went back in 2009 with my 80 year old uncle and this time we stayed at MarMac which I felt gave us less boat time each day to get to the fishing. The facilities at both lodges are the best I have ever stayed at and that includes Neultin, Kasba and Tukto Lodge. Cabins look brand new inside and are immaculate. They had ceiling fans which I thought were nice for wamer evenings. There is pleanty of room in the cabins and the bathrooms in the cabins are very clean and well maintained. THe second year we were again guided by Bob (when I go to Canada I don't want to mess with the motor, the shore lunch and trying to find fish so always use a guide). Bob once again put us on fish every day and we had a 10 experience with Bob as a guide. The owners were always on site and seemed to really care about your experience with them. I was not surprised at the end of the week with surprise charges either. By the way- the young man who guided us the prior year had been released from the lodge and Bob told us he was guilty of incompetence so was not invited back. I am going to North Seal lodge this year but that is because I want the chance for Lake trout and arctic greyling. I do not hesitate to recommend MarMAc lodge and may very well go back. It is one of only 2 lodges I have returned to more than once. There is a real chance of 100 fish days there. The boats are the cedar boats but I found them to be comfortable but slow. I dont know but it may be ther eis a regulation on motor size ont his lake. The lake is not huge- it is about 23 miles long but is rather narrow. Hope this helps if anyone is considering fishing the lake."

Big fish are always appreciated, but especially with the wife along, lots of mediums would be even better - she needs to learn how to feel a tap on a jig/lindy. Any preferences in resorts (owned by the same people)? How are the guides? Any equipment that you wouldn't leave home without? Is the food at least decent? Nice that they have a 100lb weight limit...."
572443,Guest,2008-03-26 19:43:00,0,"I have been to MarMac twice about 3 & 4 years ago. Food and service rates a 10. Cabins were very nice and clean . Walleye fishing was excellent for medium size fish. ( 15-20"" ) Large walleyes very hard to come by, but a few there. First year largest was 28.5. 2nd. year a 30"". Released both. I think the pike fishing here is over looked. Only casted for pike about 2 hours each trip and caught 4 over 40"". Both times there I never saw anyone else fish for pike. If there is a down side, I think it's those old heavy cedar boats. Very slow on the water and somewhat uncomfortable. Maybe they have upgraded their motors since I have been there. Also suction cup transducer mounts do not stick on that cedar. The transom thickness on those cedar boats are 3"" thick so I had to custom make a mounting bracket. Never been to 88 so I can't comment on them. Never seen many boats from their camp when fishing. Only my opinion. Best Fishes ! ggg2"

572502,Guest,2008-03-28 12:25:00,0,"My friends and I went there about 6 years ago (Marmac). Eighty eight was being built at the time. Fairly nice accomodations, friendly people and good food. Overpriced in my opnion, but a nice place. Instead of flying in, we took the train. That way we could bring as much gear(beer)as we wanted. They picked us up in a boat and off we went. The only downside was that when you were leaving and the train was late and it was raining, you were screwed. They dropped you off at the tracks and you were on your own until the train shows up, which from what we heard, could be up to 6 hrs late. The walleye fishing was very good, nothing big, but plenty of numbers. We took a guide the first day, he put us on fish and made a great shore lunch. We had a hard time finding the big pike. Caught plenty of smaller ones but we were really targeting the 35 in plus. I think we only caught 3-4 big guys. We went in late August and the fish were on the deeper weed edges. Large white spinner baits were the key to getting some of the larger fish. Gold spoons caught plenty of the smaller ones. There are some really big pike in the lake (others were catching), but being there for the first time and spending only 4 days there, we really didn't figure it out until the last day. The wood boats are very stable , but not at all comfortable. We brought a portable fish finder (a must!!!) and luckily they had an extra bracket to attach our tansducer to the stern of the boat. The boats do not have trolling motors so if your cruising the banks for pike, it made it kinda tough on a windy day pulling the motor all day. I think they had Merc 25 hp's on the heavy wood boats, so they were kind sluggish. The lake is very long, so it will take a while to get from one end to the other, especially if you stay at Eighty eight. We probably will not go back, there are nicer operations out there."

572532,pike50plus,2008-03-30 08:34:00,584,"Gbs, may I ask what area, # of people and price range you are looking for? May have suggestions if they fit your criteria."
572560,Guest,2008-04-01 10:06:00,0,"My group likes to fish for the big pike. We have been going to a place NE of Dryden. We go every other year and we have been very happy about the quality of the fish (we had a couple of 44+ last year), the camp and the price. There are a couple of nearby lakes to fish for walleye. We have not been to any of those lakes. There are some big lakers also."
572572,GBS,2008-04-01 21:18:00,2271,"My wife and I would be going - we have the third week of July free, so a 5 or 6 night location. One longer day drive from Mpls/St. Paul, so probably NW Ontario - but Esanagi is Easterly, and just at the edge of our preferred driving range. She wants American plan. Remote is stongly preferred - fly/train/boat in. Walleye and northern, of course. Never fished for lakers, but if available wouldn't mind trying. Smallmouth, for variety, but I normally don't pursue. I used to fish trout a lot, so if there were brookies also available, that would be a bonus. Someplace where we can have very good numbers - she likes to fish, but is a beginner, so needs lots of bites to learn how to feel a pickup on a jig, etc. Bigger fish are neat, but trophy's aren't required. But, no hordes of small ones, either. Something say in the 16-24 range for walleye. A little bigger for pike. With shots at some bigger... A smaller private lake, rather than big public water. Budget up to $1800 per person - less is definately better! No $3K places, although they look really, really cool and are what we really want! At least partial week guiding included in total cost would be appreciated, but don't need a constant companion for the week, unless the location warrents. Lots of wildlife to sight (moose, deer, bear, caribou(?)), would be a plus. Boats with real seats mandatory - no more benches!"
572610,PIKEMAN1,2008-04-03 10:30:00,14,Take a look at www.onamanriverresort.com Very low cost. great cabins . good honest owner and lots of fish.The back lakes are great. We caught lots of very nice walleye and pike last Aug. We are going back in May this year. Good fishing.
