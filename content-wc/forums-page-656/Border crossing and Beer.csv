565098,Guest,2007-05-09 09:28:00,0,"If you buy at the duty free site as you cross into Ontario say at Fort Frances, how many duty free cases can you bring over? Is it still just the one case/person?"
565063,jigman 2003,2007-05-09 09:56:00,981,"Nope, take as many as you want. You just have to stop and pay the duty. That's what we did last year. That way we got some real beer (i.e. Canadian) for a good price. Weight on our fly-ins was never an issue so we loaded up on beer. Our outfitter brought any overages in later for free. I believe a case of Kokanee was around $27.00 with duty and a case of Molson Canadian was around $29.00 with duty. Compare that to $37 a case from our outfitter, it was a pretty good deal."

565066,Guest,2007-05-09 11:09:00,0,Last I understood you could take a max. of 5 cases per person....is that still the same.....???

565105,SSH,2007-05-09 12:45:00,526,"You are allowed 1 carton of cigarettes and in terms of alcohol, either 1 case of beer, or a 40 oz. bottle of hard liquor or wine per person of legal age."
565109,jigman 2003,2007-05-09 13:58:00,981,"I'm not aware of a maximum, but there probably is one. After a certain point they would figure that the beer isn't for your personal use."
565126,Guest,2007-05-10 06:19:00,0,Thanks Jigman for the reply.
565188,freespoolin,2007-05-11 14:33:00,472,Whether you buy at a duty free or bottle shop makes no never mind. You're allowed one 24 bottle case or 1 liter of spirits. Anything over this limit has duty/tax.
565191,Guest,2007-05-11 17:30:00,0,Your prices are inflated. You can get budget beer which is what you guys seem to want for $25Can per 24. You can get your US beer at the liquor store in cans for $29Can per 24. You might want to factor in the loss of fuel mileage carrying your beer and the loss of your time at the border. Every penny counts.
565079,Guest,2007-05-08 18:50:00,0,Several posts are correct: 1 case or 1 liter per person. However I travel to NW Ontario every year and claim 3 cases of beer crossing the border. My uncle and brother do the same. It costs about $7 per case extra. It is well worth the money!! Our beer tastes better and the cost of Canadian beer now is ridiculous.
565057,Guest,2007-05-09 07:36:00,0,what is the average price of a case of beer in Ontario in US dollars say for Molsen or labatts?

565058,Guest,2007-05-09 08:13:00,0,We always buy our beer at the border for $13-$15 a case duty free. Thats for Moosehead or Labatts! Can't buy any better for those brands anywhere!

565060,Guest,2007-05-09 08:34:00,0,"Beer in Canada is about $36-37 canadian, including taxes. That is about $33 US depending what type of beer you get. This is based on todays rates at the Beer Store and todays exchange rate so this is not a guess, but accurate. I like good old Bud Light at $12 a case and $7 duty myself. I know everyone says how great Canada Beer is, but I have not seen any huge difference in the beer, and like to save the $14 per case."

564540,jigman 2003,2007-04-16 07:00:00,981,"Last year we ended up paying around $27.00 per case for the beer over our limit (that's total, the cost of the beer and the duty). That was a saving of around $9.00 per case. Of course, if you're flying in, you may end up paying for the overweight."

Don't forget guys-Buying it up here has several advantages: You are getting it in Canadian dollars=15% off You are getting ""Real Beer""@ 5% alcohol= more for your buck Fuel savings not hauling extra weight When we go to the US we never bring our stuff- it's nice to get something different.

564559,Guest,2007-04-16 21:23:00,0,never understood the point of bringing a lot of beer since it's illeagal in boats anyway.Seems odd that Canada plays up their beer but can't have one while fishing.

564480,reconssd,2007-04-13 15:19:00,147,"My fishing group has never brought beer into Canada. This year we are considering it. I need clarification from those of you who bring beer into Canada. I have read conflicting reports regarding bringing beer into Canada. I read that 15% duty is required on all beer and alcohol. But, I have also been told there is a one case of beer per person policy which is duty free. What has your experience been regarding this topic? Thank you in advance for your responses. Have a great 07 fishing season."
564481,Guest,2007-04-13 15:36:00,0,"You are allowed either 1 case of beer or 1 liter of wine/booze per person duty free. You must pay duty on anything beyond that, I'm not sure exactly what the amount is but is based on what you paid for it. We take what we want, declare it when crossing the border and pay whatever the duty comes to. You're on vacation, why not enjoy it and have available your favorite adult beverage?"
564482,gsmitty,2007-04-13 16:20:00,10,"We take in one case per man every year, declare it at the border no duty - no problems."

564499,woods,2007-04-14 10:25:00,646,"We paid the duty for about 15 years, and could never figure out what the heck it was. Seemed to be different every year, for the same amount of booze. Now we just bring in the duty free amount, and buy the rest in Canada. Then we set around drinking it, and not spoiling the moment by trying to figure out what the h--- the duty is!"
564502,Guest,2007-04-14 15:36:00,0,Last year we paid $9 per case over your limit of 1
564504,Guest,2007-04-14 18:11:00,0,Don't let the canadians know that us fisherman will pay any price to get beer into Canada or buy it when were there. No beer on my fishing trip makes me sad.

You must pay duty on >anything beyond that, I'm not sure exactly what the amount is >but is based on what you paid for it. How do they know how much you paid for a case of beer, unless you have a receipt? There has to be a set amount. I usually buy a case of beer when I get close to the lodge, but this year my nephew is coming up for the first time, and he drives a Anheiser Busch truck. He gets all kinds of free beer, and wants to know how much he can bring. So there is no duty on free beer? I don't think so."
564517,Guest,2007-04-15 11:43:00,0,"There is a formula for how much you pay. If you paid 13.00 per case, you usually pay around $7 per case. Hard liquor is a higher amount, so a bottle (1/5 th) might run you $12 duty. If you have one case and one bottle, claim the bottle as your free one and pay the duty on the beer. If you have free beer then I am sure you have outsmarted them and will not have to pay a dime for duty."
