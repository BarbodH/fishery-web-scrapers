First opener in 5 years, hope to see some of you clowns from Golden Eagle and Evergreen soon. If you get there before me, be sure and mark all those rocks just below the surface so it doesn't ruin my summer! Good fishin to all!"

Did you check out the weather forcast? Rain through the first part of next week. Let's hope it amounts to something, sounds like we need it."

Travel safe and looking forward to seeing you soon, good soaking rain last night that should lower the fire hazard and help with lake levels."
