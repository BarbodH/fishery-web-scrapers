565204,Guest,2007-05-12 14:40:00,0,yesterday the MNR issued an Emergency Order that deals with the fire near Savant Lake. This order allows the MNR to close all roads in the area and restrict the travel on those roads. In order to get past the road blocks a letter of authorization must be issued to you by the MNR office in Sioux Lookout. If your travel plans put you in this area you would be wise to check with your outfitter to see if you can get to your spot.
