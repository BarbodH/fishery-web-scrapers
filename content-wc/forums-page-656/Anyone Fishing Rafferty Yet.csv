Kept on and found some new spots and ended up catching 10 walleyes keeping our limit(6) of 18 to 20 inch fish. Slow again but still better than a good day at work. We used jigs/crawlers, jigs/frozen minnows, and jigs/gulp and the crawlers did the best. Not much help but have fun anyways. It will only get better as the year goes on!!"
565233,skeeter 1880,2007-05-14 05:54:00,157,A couple friends went up there on Sunday and did better than we did on Saturday. They caught 30 walleyes. Had better fish than we did on Sat. Jigs and piece of crawler is what they were using. Have to wait for the weekend again before we try it again.
