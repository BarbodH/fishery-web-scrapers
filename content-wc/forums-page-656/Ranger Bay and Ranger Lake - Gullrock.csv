Bill there may be a new boat in the near future but can't give you a make yet. So many boats and so little time."
565334,2746,2007-05-16 14:24:00,3206,"Well Bud, we both can remember what it was like when your interest turns from Math to Girls......It will be good to see him!"
564992,Tonyo,2007-05-06 20:48:00,212,"Ok, I know there has been talk in the past couple of months of lengthing the time Ranger Bay and Ranger Lake will be closed. The last I was told is the MNR had not made up there mind for the '07 season. It is not the end all if it is closed but we will be making our annual trip, in oh say 25 days, and I was wodering and it helps pass the time as I stare at the calender waiting."
564993,Guest,2007-05-06 21:31:00,0,I spoke to the head game warden last week about this. As far as the mnr in concerned the sanctuary is in place until June 1 then ranger and ranger bay are open for fishing.
564994,Guest,2007-05-06 22:16:00,0,"I also talked to MNR rep. this spring and was told that Ranger and Ranger Bay will be closed to the 15th of June in 2008. As warm as been up here the last couple of weeks eyes will be spawning soon, and the amount of boats in Ranger& bay will not be a factor."
564996,Tonyo,2007-05-07 05:07:00,212,"Thanks for the info. I know there are lots of other spots to fish but it is always a good time for the younger crowd, of the party, to fish in the bay. It has been a few years since you guys have had ice as late as this year. Has this made a difference in how soon the eyes will be spawning? I'm guessing your water temps are the rise quickly at this time. An anxious Missourian."

565014,2746,2007-05-07 16:44:00,3206,Probably getting on Melinda's nerves!
565054,Guest,2007-05-08 22:55:00,0,"Well, everyone thought we were going to pack are bags and move back to the states, like the Weavers. Not a chance, we have found a home up here in Red Lake the town and the people are awesome. And the fishing is pretty #### good too! I would put Red Lake up against any lake I fished up here. I guess if I was to say what I was doing with my spare time, I'm getting my boat ready for May 19th it's the first time I'll get to fish the opener in 13 years. Hey Larrym, Malinda said you got that right!"
