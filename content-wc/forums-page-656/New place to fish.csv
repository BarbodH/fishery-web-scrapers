565201,Dacotah Eye,2007-05-12 09:27:00,2722,I live in South Dakota and have been going to The Pas area in Manitoba in September for years. I am looking for some suggestions for lakes to fish in Southerm Manitoba or Saskatchewan. I haven't been able to get to Canada for about six years and have always wanted to take my son there on a fishing trip. The price of gas is getting to the point that it is the most expensive part of the trip. Any suggestions will be appreciated. :cheers:
