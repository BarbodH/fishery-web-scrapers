565141,Guest,2007-05-10 10:58:00,0,"where you staying?? have fished out of pine point, and maki bay resort, but not for a few years..has the slot limit helped?? the little bay at the back of maki bay has a real good evening bite for eyes,as well as the shoreline and point coming out of the big part of the bay..good fishing to you. will be on snake bay lotw same week..bender out.. 22days, yeesss!!!"
565144,Guest,2007-05-10 11:24:00,0,"My sketchy understanding is that ice out was later than last year by at least three weeks. Guys were still ice fishing on 28 April this year. Last year I think Ice was off the first week of April. Don't know how that compares to average. Last year we fished last week of June, first of July, and it was like fishing August up there. Good smallie bite, though."
565145,Guest,2007-05-10 11:50:00,0,"where are you guys getting smallies?? never caught one in 20 yrs of fishing, but havent fished ldml for about 6 yrs. are they becoming abundant?? bender"
565152,Guest,2007-05-10 15:31:00,0,"All the bass we got were in the Baril Bay area. I think people get them all over on the west side of the lake. Don't know about elsewhere. I think there's a group of guys in Thunder Bay talking about setting up a smallmouth tourney there this year. I've only been fishing the lake for three years, so I don't know about recently relative to the past. When we first went up, we assumed there were no smallmouth in the lake, because every source I found said or implied that. But they're in there. Most of the ones we caught were while fishing for walleyes, and the bulk were 16""-18"", and most came out of weedy areas. I wouldn't call it a destination smallmouth lake by any stretch, but it's fun to pick up a half dozen throughout the day. Was reading in In-fisherman that the warmest years on record are dominated by the 1980's, 1990's and 2000's, and the effects are measurable on northern lakes in terms of water temperature increases. Maybe that has to do with the smallmouth upswing. Sadly, if it continues, it will be bad for the trout in the region."
565162,Guest,2007-05-10 19:23:00,0,we stay at pine point. we've caught a couple smallies right near pine point trying for northerns. the slot has definitely helped from 10 years ago...still an abundance of smaller fish but we do seem to get more 17-18 inchers than in years past.
565237,Guest,2007-05-14 09:33:00,0,how good has the northern fishing been ??
565239,Guest,2007-05-14 10:52:00,0,"we haven't targeted northern much but we pick up a half dozen keepers or so each year. lots of attacks on walleyes being reeled in, thats always fun!"
