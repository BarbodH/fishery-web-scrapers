565229,pintaildux,2007-05-13 21:04:00,12,I am heading to lake Wabaksang June 8th. Has anybody heard what the water level is doing and if the weather has been warmer than normal up there so far this year.Thanks
565235,Guest,2007-05-14 07:31:00,0,"The word I've heard from Jim is that it is very low. Not as low as it was a few years ago, I think in 2002, but very low none the less. Usually May/June has some pretty good rainfall so maybe we'll luck out and get it to start coming up again. I'll also be up the same time as you...good luck."

565257,Guest,2007-05-14 17:59:00,0,Can rain really raise the level? I always thought that it was the snow. Just wondering. Thanks.
565259,waleht,2007-05-14 18:58:00,132,yeah where does all the snow go? :fishhit:
565267,Guest,2007-05-15 08:09:00,0,"I'll keep my eyes out for the Bass Tracker. The 40"" northern should be easy to accomplish...the 30"" walleye is a whole different set of standards to hit! Early June can be a prime time to get big walleyes though as they are still shallow and fairly active. If you cast big lures for northern I wouldn't be surprised if you catch your biggest walleye on those lures this time of year with them being in the shallows. Last year in June our best walleyes were caught casting 5 and 6"" plastics into new, green cabbage. We got bit off alot by northerns but the walleyes we caught were BIG! Good luck"

Read an article in Field and Stream once that it was the snow in Canada or lack of that dictated the levels of the Great Lakes."
