564433,Guest,2007-04-11 14:21:00,0,noone knows about any of these bays or regina bay lotw early june?? just wondering if we should travel east or north of sioux narrows out of snake bay..looks like you could spend a alot of timein these three bays
564452,River_eye,2007-04-12 13:17:00,1486,"You could spend a lot of time in those three bays, but most people don't. I've also been curious as to what replies you would get because when I guided out of Sioux Narrows, I was taught to leave the SN area entirely and head out to the more remote parts of the lake to catch fish."
564453,Guest,2007-04-12 14:06:00,0,"eric, i was hoping we could jump in these bays and spend a day,we will be fishing out of snake bay area and didnt want to travel to yellow girl, adams river area every day to catch fish. why wouldn't you fish these areas??there has to be some fish there. just curious. if youv'e done well anywhere else closer to snake, let me know. we fish for pike and bass as well as walleye, so if your reply was strictly concerning walleye, maybe you have a differing opinion on these bays?? 50 days and counting, the hitch..."
564549,River_eye,2007-04-16 11:09:00,1486,"Most people want walleyes so that's why they go way out past Yellow Girl, If you're after Bass and Pike you're in the right area. email me at [email protected] and I might be able to give you a few more tips."

564726,wiggle,2007-04-25 04:14:00,400,"hitch....email me. I will help out as much as I can. I have a cabin on Lobstick bay and do quite well walleye, northern, and bass fishing in that area. My email address is.... [email protected] Thanks, Brad"
