565132,clemento,2007-05-10 08:04:00,48,Had to pay $55 a case last year. Can buy it cheaper on my own but then it gets weighed. What did anyone else pay for a case from an outfitter
565136,Guest,2007-05-10 09:08:00,0,"In the past usually $45 to $55 which was acceptable. This year they want $75 per case since we are are doing a double flight out of Red Lake and using a comercial airline for the first 150+ miles. So it looks like we are going to invite a few old friends to join us, Jack Daniels and Jim Beam."

565234,jigman 2003,2007-05-14 06:30:00,981,"$75 a case? Sheesh, I'd change outfitters. Last year we paid $37 and this year $40. Still half of what you'd pay in a tavern to drink."
