564251,Guest,2007-04-03 11:40:00,0,"I happened to see something in a lodge brochure about all power boat operators in Canada need to have a license by 2009. When I consulted the great and powerful GOOGLE I came across the following site, http://www.boaterexam.com/canada/faq_rules-en.aspx Is this true? Or is it just some company trying to scare us into spending some money? If it is true, I just thought you ought to know this was coming. Personal watercraft operators, persons born after April 1, 1983, and operators of power watercraft under 4m (13.1ft) are already required, according to this website."
564254,uzzi,2007-04-03 11:45:00,349,"Nope, all true, but I'm not sure how the rules apply to Americans visiting Canada? Maybe somebody else can chime in on that one...."
564255,SSH,2007-04-03 11:56:00,526,"If you read the entire article: Q. What if I don't live in Canada, but boat there? Non-residents only need to obtain a Pleasure Craft Operator Card to operate a powered watercraft if they are in Canada for more than 45 consecutive days."
564256,Guest,2007-04-03 12:21:00,0,"I found some more info at: http://www.tc.gc.ca/BoatingSafety/oc-faq.htm ""What is acceptable proof of competency for non-residents? For non-residents, proof of competency can take one of three forms: 1. A Pleasure Craft Operator Card; 2. A completed boat rental safety checklist (for power-driven rental boats); or, 3. An operator card or equivalent which meets the requirements of their state or country. Do the Competency of Operators of Pleasure Craft Regulations apply to non-residents? ^ The Regulations apply to non-residents if: * They operate their pleasure craft in Canadian waters for more than 45 consecutive days or, * They operate a pleasure craft that is licensed or registered in Canada (including rented or chartered boats). The Regulations do not apply to non-residents who operate their pleasure craft (licensed in a country other than Canada) in Canadian waters for less than 45 consecutive days. Please note that a proof of residence will be required on board at all times. If you require more information on how Canadian requirements apply to non-residents visit the Requirements for Foreign Recreational Boaters In Canadian Waters."""
564393,wacky tambaqui,2007-04-09 18:14:00,10,"Up until this time, we have had our own set of boating safety regs in place -and all based on common sense at that. That I am now in my 40's with decades of boating under my belt and now required to get this license to run even just a trolling motor on a canoe -well that's funny ****, man! I seriously fail to comprehend the fetish that our elected leaders have in gaining complete and total control of every aspect of our lives, all just to wring out a few more pennies from Canadians' ""bottomless"" pockets. All that to help pay for the champagne and caviar for those fat cats up in Ottawa. Now that Orwellianism in Canada is a fait accompli, what is the next regulation they are going to impose on us? A license to fart? And then what will be next after that? The Human Sexuality Tax? OMFG... I don't think pre-Glasnost Russia was as bad. How are they going to enforce all that? Is there going to be a force of Boating Kommissars afloat everywhere we go, intercepting us without provocation and without doing anything wrong, and asking in a voice ringing with that Aryan twang: ""Your Boating Safety Card, please""? Meanwhile back in town, somebody will be getting assaulted, raped or murdered or worse, all with impunity on the part of the perpetrators. How else are they going to watch us all? Through Telescreens (as they are called in Orwell's 1984)? Oh... and don't forget the Thought Police! They will be the ones hovering overhead in 'copters. My 12' dinghy with a 9.9 Evinrude will get tossed like a leaf under those blades. Make sure that St-Croix rod is bolted down solid! Demockracy, eh! Polyticks! I'll be the first to challenge that edict in court when they stop me doing nothing more that having a few hours of peace on the water with rod and reel in hand. The True North Strong and Free, eh! What an oxymoron."
564397,Guest,2007-04-09 18:55:00,0,I hear you wacky as a fellow canuk the B S just keeps getting deeper. They ain't gonna mess with tourism bucks when they can safely screw us right here at home. It will be more of a hassle than a big cost ($50) bucks is cheap compared to what C68 cost us all. If you look at your insurance papers their is already a spot to say if you have the card at least there was on mine. Once it's law you can be sure that a good excuse for not honoring an insurance claim will be not having a valid operator card . They won they always win it does no good to fight but I would rather see the money spent on some enforcement on our waters in Sask. I spent 100 days a year on the water and have never been stopped or checked for anything related to boating. If there was a police presents on the water it might stop some of the drunks and those retards in ski boats that just have to drive by you at 40 yards for two hours cause you are the only other person on the lake.
564398,Guest,2007-04-09 19:02:00,0,"its all in the name of safety. under that heading everything is within their reach. since they cant catch the rapist and burglar they are going after someone they can handle, the fisherman and boater. its the idiots in the world that are causing the normal people to be subjected to these rules. its the idiots that buy a boat and dont know that maybe they should have some training in its operation. its the idiot fisherman taking a leak over the side of the boat and slips on the fish slime and falls overboard and then drowns causing the rules. I read that half the drowning people in canada are found with their zippers open. If somehow we could eliminate the idiots we would not have half the stupid rules we do now."
564401,wacky tambaqui,2007-04-10 01:58:00,10,"Ok... So we have to deal with those hare brains that shouldn't be on the water. Those, as fas as I know, have always been acted on by police on the water whenever/wherever they happened to be present. I've seen drunken sailors and other disorderly individuals get stopped on the water and when seeing that, I felt reassured to know the police are doing their job in the best interests of those who enjoy the sport safely. OTOH if you're not doing anything wrong and are staying within the posted rules, you don't have any need to worry about the police -or it should continue to be that way. I've always observed these rules myself and so far have only been met with conservation officers who made sure I had my fishing license on me. As for urinating over the side of a boat, it's best done in a bailing bucket and then emptied and rinced off but again there are those who don't seem to see that way. Wear your life jacket and make sure there is an emergency kit in the boat before you launch. It's just common sense. Now that bit about the insurance thingy: a-ha! I can understand that in a way but the first thing I read in that is another clever way to answer to their greed. When I come around to buy a new boat and motor in the not-so-distant future, well alright then, get the card. As it stands, my 12' aluminum and the old Evinrude 9.9 that powers it are decades old and would be unlikely to fetch much even in a garage sale. Down to the brass tacks of it all, I see nothing more than another example of the very idealism our grandfathers fought Hitler for in W.W.II"

564508,bigfish1965,2007-04-15 08:00:00,3210,"Think about it..any moron with a bucket full of money can buy a 400HP boat capable of doing 100 MPH on our increasingly crowded lakes without ever having to know anything about boating rules. Making sure that people have at least a cursory understanding of the water regulations is hardly invasive or communist. It is common sense. I would hope that eventually they will make insurance mandatory to scare away most of these bloody jet-skiers. Our lakes were too populated and too many deaths were occuring for them to not do anything. Forcing everyone to take a class or write a test is hardly a great inconvenience. I suppose if a few fishing boats had been capsized and people drowned by stupid boaters, everyone would be screaming for the to 'do something'."
564521,v-bay gord,2007-04-15 15:48:00,3168,Good point Bigfish.......Wacky: put your effort in the couple hours to get the card and save your energy for a cause that matters.

565240,Guest,2007-05-14 11:02:00,0,"I just got mine in NJ. I had to take boaters safety classes and then a test. I got a temporary boating safety certificate and will be getting my card to keep in my boat from the coast guard shortly. All power boat operators (anything over 12ft with a gas engine) in this state will need them by the end of 2008 also. I think it's a good idea. Lots of info all boaters should know. The certificate is good forever and it will also save you money on your boat insurance every year after you get it. The classes were given by the state police and coast guard auxiliary here. 50 bucks was a small price to pay. The information on lights, buoys, and right of way was a good lesson. I'm 57 and have had a lot of time on the water, I thought I knew it all. I was wrong. Just my 2 cents"
565244,Guest,2007-05-14 12:05:00,0,Just because you can pass a test doesn't mean your going to be a good or responsible boater. Just look how people drive a car and they had to passed a test for a driver license. It's just another way of the gov. to get money and say it's for safety and the kids. No one wants to stand up against either safety or kids so it a sure thing for making money.
564409,wacky tambaqui,2007-04-10 13:03:00,10,">They ain't gonna mess with tourism bucks when they can safely screw us right here at home.> Oh... Here's another trend that all of we Canadians ought to be disturbed about, and I'm talking to you ordinary working folk like myself and many of you who post here. This is where we are beginning to echo all those Third World countries in the Carribbean. The locals there can't enjoy their own beaches. Only the paying tourists and that rich minority from their own populations can get in there. I see a new trend taking place in that the same rule will apply to all of our waterways. Give it a few more years and only the rich foreigners and the rich minority of Canadians will be able to enjoy all water sports, including boating and angling. Give it some time and they will become the Sports of Kings. Go figure! It is Canada that has more waterways than any other country in the world but little by little, more and more are getting closed off to the public and more and more public water accesses are falling to the control of private hands. I know many places where years ago the public had free access to the waterways but today, residential subdivisions or other private property developments stand there instead. Taking a long backroads drive to that far away lake has become a risk in itself these last few years. We've aleady had to change our plans unexpectedly due to being met by a newly installed locked gate on the way in. What a rude awakening. They don't announce anything when they all of a sudden decide to cut off the public from the use of Crown Land, and they don't post any warnings at the point of entry off the highway either. Do you see the conspiracy now? Pay for your Boating Card, pay to register your boat, and don't forget to register the canoe and paddle either. Pay to get into the camping ground if you don't have your own cottage or waterfront property, and pay the gate-keepers of the waterways while a central data bank records your transaction and knows your whereabouts. Big Brother is watching you and his Boating Kommissars will always be close by. btw- How old is your boat? If it's any older than X-number of years, you'll be ordered to throw it in the trash masher, pay out of your pocket for its disposal, and go buy a new one, like it or not."
