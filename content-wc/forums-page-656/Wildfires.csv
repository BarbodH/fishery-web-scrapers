The neighbors watched three waterbombers make a loop, picking up water out of Perrault Lake, circling NW over the cottages on Wabaskang, dumping the water on the fire, then circling back to Perrault for another load. Each plane made the loop every ten minutes, it was quite entertaining I guess, and lasted most of the afternoon. They also had 40 men on the ground to put out hotspots. I guess a tree fell across the Hydro line leading to Jim and Julies Camp started it. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
