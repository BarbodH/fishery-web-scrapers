565163,rpieske,2007-05-10 19:31:00,1276,In 2003 you could barly get in there and the >water is lower now than it was then. It is at a 25 year low. >Thatcher Thatcher: I've been looking at the LWCB info on water levels this year and comparing it to 2003 levels. It appears the levels are almost identical right now. Do you think it might be wrong? I hope it's not lower than 2003. That was the lowest I had seen in 50 years. Although 1980-81 years were really low too.

A lot of money but aleast it has a good buisness. Bob, Just from what all the camp owners are saying, it is definatly lower, it might not be alot, but I think it is down still from 03."
565193,Guest,2007-05-11 20:12:00,0,"I have stayed at the Obabikon Bay camp just south of the entrance to the obabikon. I have been there early spring, summer and late fall and ya, the obabikon holds a lot of northerns, but I only reamember catching a few really large northerns. Seems like #5 Mepps spinners in red/white were always good and every trip, we would get a muskie or two. Spinner baits also were effective. Do be careful in that narrow entrance. A few summers ago, I took out the lower unit on a rental boat and that made the trip a bit more expensive."
565231,Guest,2007-05-13 22:01:00,0,"The lake level is at the lowest I or any of the resort owners in the Morson area have ever seen. There are rocks that we always watch to gauge how low it is. This year I am seeing rocks just out of the water that I have never seen before. As for Obabikon Narrows, I was just there today...it is as shallow as I have ever seen. Best idea is to get out of the boat and pull it through...although using the reverse, tilted motor technique works too. Northerns are biting already, as are the bass. Lake temperature at the narrows is 61.8F and the main lake around Rabbit Point is 57.2F. Hope some of this current info helps."
565242,1shooter,2007-05-14 11:45:00,1493,Can you get a 19' boat into Obabikon?
565262,Guest,2007-05-14 20:05:00,0,It would just depend on how strong the current is...right now the level is so low...I would say you wouldn't...I have a 18' lund and it won't make it.
564962,Guest,2007-05-05 14:46:00,0,First time up for the walleye opener. We also want to chase big pike. Any advice on presentation and locations would be appreciated. What can we expect for size and action on Pike? Thanks.
564969,rockpt,2007-05-05 22:26:00,589,I understand the channel into Obabikon is good for spring pike. Where you staying?
564971,Guest,2007-05-06 07:59:00,0,We are staying in Miles Bay at Rex Tolten's. Stayed there last year in July...great owners.
565104,Thatcher_424,2007-05-09 11:40:00,11,Try small mepps spinners like #4 or #5. Spoons. they seem to work good this time of year. Also getting into obobikan lake will be impossible this year if we don't get any rain.
565117,Guest,2007-05-09 19:23:00,0,Do you really think the water will be too low to get into Obabikon? I'm really hoping to check it out for pike on the opener. Anyone on here fished it before for early pike?
565118,rockpt,2007-05-09 19:47:00,589,"You're running a camp boat with tiller, right? Pull the motor up to shallow water position and back in at idle speed. If there's a strong current going in you can lift the motor and use the paddles to push off the rocks as the current pulls you thru. It'll be just like Pirates of the Caribbean But if there's a current in either direction you'll need the motor when going against the current cause you can't paddle a boat thru the narrows when the water is low and there's a current. If you're running a console, trim the main motor all the way up and use the bow mount to pull you thru. No problem. The water level now is about the same as it was back in summer 2003. Boats got into Obabikon then as long as they knew what they were doing."
565119,Guest,2007-05-09 20:01:00,0,Thanks rockpt. I'll have my boat with a console but was hoping I could pull through the narrows with my trolling motor. Any experience fishing Obabikon for pike in the spring? How about in grassy narrows? Thanks for your help.
565122,rockpt,2007-05-09 20:29:00,589,"I have no experience with spring pike but Rick Gates from Buena Vista posts on his blog every spring about a group that comes in every May and does well on pike in Obabikon. Here's Rick's post from May 5, 2006 (""Beaton was the 1st fisherman to hit camp - he usually is - his crew caught a bunch of Northerns in Obabikon""). I expect you'll do well. Make sure your trolling batteries are well charged before going into Obabikon or you risk getting stuck in there if there's a strong wind from the south blowing the water into Obabikon. I put my foot pedal up on the bow, get on my knees so I can see the rocks and use my hands to control the foot pedal when using the bow mount going in or out of Obabikon. I have a Crestliner 192 TS. With the water this low, there will be a pucker factor, but that's the fun of it, no?;-)"
565147,Thatcher_424,2007-05-10 13:17:00,11,"I have fished obabiken for years now and if you have anything bigger than a 12 foot boat I don't think your gonna be able to get in there. In 2003 you could barly get in there and the water is lower now than it was then. It is at a 25 year low. If you can get in there it should be good fishing, and you will probably be all by your selves. Check it out when you get up here but use your best discretion before you go though the narrows so you don't get hung up and wreck something. Thatcher"
565149,Ia Walihntr,2007-05-10 13:56:00,320,"Is this the Thatcher from Nestor Falls that I and my wife fished with last September? If so, good to see you on the board. Say Hi to Rob, Dan and the rest. I see Century 21 has the resort up for sale. Marv"
