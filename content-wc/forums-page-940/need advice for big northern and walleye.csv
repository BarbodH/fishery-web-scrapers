522133,bassinboy,2002-07-04 12:34:00,18,"SOMEWHERE A LITTLE NORTH OF UPSALA. We mostly fish some near some rapids, around an island, and at a dropoff. We mostly jig for walleye and troll for northern, but we can catch some of each both ways. Anything will help. Bait, depth, etc...thanks:)"
522134,porcupine,2002-07-04 19:10:00,9,"North of Upsala, fished the area only once but did very, very well. I would definitely take the walleye standards, 1/8, 1/4, 3/8 oz. jigs (pink, yellow, maybe green) with Berkeley 3"" neonz powergrubs in white, yellow and sherbet colours. Always buy jigs with eyes painted on. Also throw a few packs of Go-getters in the bag. These things go by a thousand different names but are just a length of mono-filament with a few pretty beads, a hammered brass or silver colorado blade and a hook. Pack of three costs about a buck. Troll these very slowly right at the bottom, near weed edges. If you have used floating jigs before, you might try a few Northland floaters along current edges with a bell type sinker. Take plenty of bait, always buy your minnows locally if you can. Worms and leeches would also be handy. Every large walleye I have ever taken or seen taken has been caught on one of these three baits. For northerns, get a pack of Little Cleos, remove the standard treble hooks and replace them with dressed trebles. A little yellow and orange feather on the treble works wonders. Be on the water early for the big fellas. Don't forget some top water baits for great pike action. Hope this helps, good luck."
522135,bassinboy,2002-07-05 09:12:00,18,What do little cleos look like? I've never used those
522136,porcupine,2002-07-05 17:04:00,9,"Little Cleos are spoons manufactured by Acme Tackle Company. I buy them in a four pack; the finish is excellent and holds up much better than painted spoons with northerns. They cast extremely well so you can fan cast and cover a lot of water. Even without the dressed trebles, these guys work really well."
522137,bassinboy,2002-07-05 18:44:00,18,"Thanks, I'll report back when we return."
522138,Guest,2002-07-07 07:53:00,0,"A couple of big pike tips: Husky Jerks retrieved in an uneven (stop/go) manner. Also try 1/2 oz and/or 3/4 oz Johnson Silver Minnow spoons dressed with an Uncle Josh Bass Strip pork trailer. Pitch it into the wood and weeds (and I do mean ""into""), use an erratic retrieve. Adjust the weed guard constantly. When trolling stick baits try moving a little deeper and farther away from the breaks and crank up the throttle to 4.5mph to 5mph. You'll think you're moving too fast but after you catch your first Northern using this technique, you'll discover that you simply cannot troll faster than a Pike can swim. Good luck. Have fun."
