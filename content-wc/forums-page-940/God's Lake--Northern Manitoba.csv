One member of our group got a trophy 29"" walleye on jig and twister. The rest of us just caught many nice 18-24"" walleyes and northerns up to 38"". I had the most fun throwing a chartruse, very large zara spook type lure and watching the pike wack it like a beach ball. I had incredible luck with that lure. Overall the lodge was very good and the food was outstanding. The service was tough to beat. They have good guides but if you want a true trophy, you probably need to hook up with the owner's son, Greg. I would recommend this lake and lodge."
