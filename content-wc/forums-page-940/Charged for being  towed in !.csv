522078,Guest,2002-07-02 20:08:00,0,"I have towed a couple of boats in over the years - all I expect to get is a thank you. It is nice if somebody offers more, but not a neccesity. (I think all but one time I refused the offer) I assume people were not planning on needing a tow and probably do not have extra cash on them (I don't). Also, most of the boats I towed looked like economy specials anyway and I assume the owners could not afford much more.As far as the law, I believe you have to render aid, but that does not include having to tow them in. While towing can put extra wear on a motor, if it is done slowly, I can't believe it will be noticable."
522079,rainy,2002-07-02 23:07:00,21,"hi bud, been on both ends of the rope.never asked for anything, but offered when i was towed.even hot wired a truck that lost its keys with wire from my trailer. there is a law but, any person with morels or common sences will help a person in distress.i call that person a hero. the people that want somthing in return is somthing my wife calls me when i dont listen.hope you meet the ahole in the same situation, what goes around comes around. GIVE IT TO THEM,please."
522080,Guest,2002-07-03 05:03:00,0,Thanks guys for the replys. I was sure I wasn't the only one who thouht these guys were wrong for charging. Yes Larry I own Five Lakes lodge have a safe trip up and we'll make sure these guys leave some fish in the lake for your group.
522074,Guest,2002-07-04 04:24:00,0,I agree. You should not have to be a tow service for a disabled boat unless you can easilly handle it with your equipment. Get the guys to shore and beach the boat if its safe to do so. I have found that in my travels its the same guys who break down all the time and the same guys who do all the towing. I did $600 damage to my equipment a few years back towing and had to foot the whole bill myself.
522081,Rick,2002-07-04 13:23:00,226,"They can ask for whatever they want but I don't believe anyone's obligated to pay outrageous fees like that. I would have offered $20 and/or gas and told them to take it or leave it if they insisted on more. The guys being towed never should have paid it, if they did. Now if they asked for this in advance and there was an agreement by both parties, that's someting else.I can't believe there is any obligation, legally or morally, to allow your self to be taken advantage of in this situation. If there is, they should be glad the crooks/rescuers didn't ask for $500."
522082,SWeed,2002-07-06 22:50:00,66,I would think that if you offer to tow someone the fee would be discussed before towing... No discussion/ No fee. If you are offered something after towing that is a bonus. Otherwise it is highway (waterway) robberey.... Was the boat doing the towing a camp boat or private boat. If the guys were from outta the country they broke the law because they don't have permission to work in Canada. Now I'm ramblin'...did that include gst and prov. tax? Those were some inconsiderate fishermen and they will reap theirs someday.
522083,SD Fisher,2002-07-07 21:01:00,90,"About 5 years ago, we were on Lake o' Woods when I stripped the gears on my lower unit. We were about 4-5 miles from our camp and went for almost an hour (using the electric) before we even saw another boat. Luckily they responded to our waves and agreed to tow us back in (they were staying at the same resort; again, lucky for us). There was no discussion of payment, they just said they'd do it. It was our last day of fishing and all I had in my billfold was a $20 and a $50. I really wanted to give them the $50 but was afraid I wouldn't have enough to get home. I offered the $20 and thanked them profusely, also gave them all of our leftover bait. They seemed happy with that, although I don't think they were really expecting much, I think they were just doing it to help out a fellow fisherman. To make a short story long, I will always remember that and plan to help out any boat that I come accross that seems to be in trouble, without expecting any payment."
522067,Guest,2002-07-01 14:55:00,0,I own a camp on Gullrock and this week some my guys had to be towed in (their own boat) they told the guys thanks and asked me to fill their boat with gas the guy that did the towing said they didn't want gas but that they wanted $120.oo and a case of beer for thier service. they towed them about 5mi. Just wanted to see what other fishermen thought about being charged for getting towed in.
522068,Guest,2002-07-01 15:02:00,0,I don't see the love thy neighbor in that one--or do unto others etc.
522069,roscoe,2002-07-01 17:12:00,38,"Some years ago we were fishing out of Moroson on the Lake of the Woods and we saw what appeared to be a boat in the distance with someone waving. Went over to the boat and they had engine trouble and had been drifting for some time. They were thankful to see us and we towed them into one of the resorts. They asked us what they could do for us and we told them to remember that they may have the same opportunity sometime and that we didn't want anything and we went on our way. When we went to check out, we found out that they had paid for some of our gas bill for the week. We didn't expect it and never asked for anything. We did not tow them 5 miles but it was about 3 or so. $120 seems way out of line. A case of beer should have been enough. John"
522070,Eric,2002-07-01 17:43:00,114,I agree that there should be no charge. We all need a little help now and again. Offer them something and they should turn it down except to say that they should return the favor some day to another stranded boat. Eric
522071,Guest,2002-07-02 04:34:00,0,"Hey BudSee you in a week, I agree with the others you reap what you sow. Someday these fisherman might have a problem and there will be knowone to help. I would help someone expecting nothing in return.Jeff"
522072,utts,2002-07-02 06:12:00,0,I just towed a boat 10 miles with 2 guys. It took me 1 hour 15 min.It cost me 15 dollars worth of Canada gas and alot of wear on my 60hp.I got a maybe we can help you someday from a guy I will never see again. Gas money and a cold Blue is not too much to ask. Nexttime the guys are free but the boat will cost.
522073,bigfish1965,2002-07-02 08:31:00,3210,"If I'm not mistaken, it is a marine law that you MUST render assistance to a disabled/distressed boat. I have done so a few times in the past and have never asked for more than a thanks."
522075,2746,2002-07-02 09:14:00,3206,"Wouldn't think of asking for anything and we've towed people several times. The offer of gas was appropriate and should have been plenty. Thier request would be unusual for the fishermen I've met.By the way we're headed up to Gullrock for the first time in late Aug. with a group of 6. Staying at Five Lakes Lodge. I did not make arrangments but thought ""Bud"" sounded familar. Dosn't happen to be you does it?"
522076,Guest,2002-07-02 12:12:00,0,I believe that maritime law states that you are OBLIGATED to help another mariner in distress.
522077,Rat,2002-07-02 13:40:00,102,"I have towed people in several times and would never think of asking for money. The offer should be made to compensate for gas and common hospitality would indicate an invitation to a cold beer. However, neither should be expected or asked for. What happened to the brotherhood of fisherman. Next time might be the other way around."
