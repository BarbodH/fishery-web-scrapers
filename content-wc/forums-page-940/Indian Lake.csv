522186,Dean,2002-07-05 13:10:00,60,This will be my second year to indian lake. Looking for hot spots for walleye and tips for catching them. Last year did all right but spent most of the time searching. Mostly jiged and casted plastic. Had trouble catching walley during the day. Wondering if the lake being so clear has something to do with it. Also any help with barrel lake and want to try lake trout fishing. Thanks.

522188,Dean,2002-07-08 08:22:00,60,Leaving 1st week of August
522190,Dean,2002-07-08 08:23:00,60,That's the lake.
522191,BD,2002-07-08 17:17:00,739,"The eyes will be deep. Try jigging the deeper structure. A good depth finder to spot the fish and a trolling motor to hold you over them is the ticket. You may also find some nice fish in shallower structure, where you can find rocks or a reef edge. Trolling over the shallow rocks etc. will get you into a few real nice eyes and smallies. The snot rockets will probably be suspended and very active. The lake is part of the English River system, and like Press Lake etc. in that same area, the fish tend to follow the same pattern."
