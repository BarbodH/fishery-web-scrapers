521994,Guest,2002-06-29 13:26:00,0,"Just returned from a great trip to Minnitaki Lake near Sioux Lookout. Grandson had a push-button counter and 3 of us got up to 321 fish, mostly W.E., maybe 15-20 Northern. Largest W.E. 25.5"" another 25"" both released. Quite a few in or over the slot (18-22"")Largest Northern 10.5#. Only 2 Smallmouths.Fished Rice and English rivers for quantity but largest fish caught between islands and off points. The English is fantastic this time of year, almost every cast at times, however smaller 13-15"" fish but great fun for the wife and grandson. Fish were still in 8-10' of water and any live bait on a jig worked great.Stayed at Northern Sunrise island camp, which is out near the fishing. Probably nicer places along the road #72 but this is a lot quicker to fishing. He has hot and cold running water inc shower, solar charged elec lights, outdoor bif, grills etc . Most everything fishermen need. On the way down 502 only about 3-4 crews working and one lane while working. Many repaired and replaced culverts and sholder repairs.I pulled a boat and would definately take it vrs 17 and 71 around LOW.I made the same trip June 1 before the heavy rains and 502 was really nice then, mostly new sections. (Fishing was great then also only shallower and Rice and English closed until 6-15.)"
521995,Guest,2002-06-30 04:58:00,0,Thanks for the info. Leaving July 4th for a 2 week stay at Pickerel Arm Camp on Minnitaki. It doesn't get any better than that.
521996,Chad,2002-07-08 08:11:00,3523,Just got back for the same area. The fishing was great and I would agree about the English River-- fish hook so often is was sick-- mostly small-- I did see one guy catch a 10 pounder on a 8 inch crank bait of some sort. Where did you fish in the Rice River for Walleyes? We caught some nice pike in the weeds at the back end of the lake. We did pretty good on smallies biggest being 17.5. As for our outpost cabin-- it sucked- No running water and the frig which was suppose to work never did. Wasted two mornings running into town for ice and living out of coolers.
