Prior to that we had done fly-ins. With new boat and camper, I could not justify doing fly-ins and leaving the boat and camper at home.Last year, water level had just gotten back to normal in late August, it had been up about 7 feet all summer.I know there is a website that gives the flows on the rivers and lakes but I did not bookmark it.Rich is going up before you do, maybe he will give you a report when he gets back.Give Barb a fishing report to pass on to me as I will not arrive until Sunday afternoon and you will already be gone.ThanksDave"

522045,Guest,2002-07-08 20:29:00,0,"We went to Separation Lake last year, end of June. Stayed at the Camp Ground. Barb was very pleasant and helpful. We found that fishing the river was much more productive than the lake. (lake is large and we didn't know where all the humps are.) Try above and below the Little Falls and any place where the main river channel eddies around a point. We did well on crank baits, but caught them on jigs tipped with minnows or crawlers also. Didn't have much luck finding small mouths. We did catch quite a few eyes while fishing for pike in the edges of the standing weeds. Reeds standing in six foot of water produced an afternoon full of walleyes and pike. Largest walleye was 27"" and the biggest pike 40"". Lots of eyes in the 22"" to 24"" zone. My brother just got back last week, and reports the river is several feet higher than last year. Made the run up and down the rapids rather exciting. You must be careful and run the right line through the rapids. The hot spots from last year, didn't produce. Perhaps the fish will settle into a more predictable pattern when your there. Good luck."
522032,TomPGrouse,2002-06-30 11:57:00,124,I would appreciate any opinions about the fishing and general experiences you have had on this lake.Thanks
522033,Guest,2002-06-30 15:09:00,0,"Hi,We fished Separation Lake last year at this time and we really did great. We camped at the campground and Barb was wonderful explaining the river system. We caught alot of 31 inch plus walleyes on a plain hook with a leech, split shot 18 inches above the hook. We had hoped to go back this year but can't make it, our friends have to work. We found the walleyes in the swirling water, we went down the river on the left side of the island by the rapids and fished below the small rapids, we had to go back up the big rapids to get to camp, but it wasn't bad. John the guide there helped us alot told us of some other places to go but we did so well there, we stayed there. Are you staying at the campground or the resort?Let us know how many fish you caught when you get back.[email protected]<:)))))><"
522034,DaveIN,2002-07-01 11:15:00,191,"I have always suspected that there is a lack of replies about Separation Lake as those that go there don't want it to get crowded.I have been there in late August and am going again this year at the same time.What Pikelady mentioned in her post is right on the money and she seems to be fishing the same spot that I fish.You did not mention if you were going to the Lodge or the Campground.I can't speak for the lodge but Barb and John at the Campground are just great. They will do about anything to make your stay a good one.Strongly suggest hiring John to guide you for a day, his rates are very reasonable, to get on the fish quickly.Feel free to e-mail me if you have other questions.Dave"
522035,TomPGrouse,2002-07-01 15:27:00,124,Pike lady did you mean 21 inchers?
522036,Guest,2002-07-01 16:04:00,0,"Hello,I am not exagerating at all when I said 31 inchers, they were big and strong, as they have to be in the current, my hubbie caught 5 consecutive walleyes over 31 inches. It was really fun, and yes you should hire John, he really knows the river system and is very cheap. If you need any more help let us know. (Really love that lake.)[email protected]<:))))><"

522040,Eyesore,2002-07-02 15:01:00,455,"How would one find out the water levels- high or low, for this river sys. Am considering going the end of aug. By the way, Barb is a peach, was there 3 years ago."
522041,DaveIN,2002-07-03 10:53:00,191,"EyesoreIf you do go the last of August, stop by and say hello, I will be in a truck camper on Lot #1 and fishing out of a Crestliner. We plan on arriving August 25 and leaving on Sept 5Dave"
522042,Eyesore,2002-07-03 18:37:00,455,"10-4 Davein, if I do go it would be the week prior to yours but at least I'd be able to give you a fishin' report on your arival sat. Were you there in june of 1999 with your kids? If so, I think we've met. Anyway, how would one find out the water levels for this river sys? Historicaly, what have they been in late aug?"
