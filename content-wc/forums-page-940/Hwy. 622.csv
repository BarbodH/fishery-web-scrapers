522237,Guest,2002-07-07 21:38:00,0,"I am not sure where Savant lake is, but 622 was as normal as USA 2 lane road. We took 622 from Ignace south to Intl Falls 1 1/2 weeks ago. Where is Savant lake? The road is curvey, but the drive is pretty. Watch out for the bears. Are you heading towards Dryden or Ignace? Kevin Lowerre"
522238,Guest,2002-07-08 05:06:00,0,"Appreciate the response. We will head toward Ignace on 17 and then take 599 N\NE out of Ignace. We then go about 50 miles N of the town of Savant Lake. Only 8 days of anticipation left. Would like to see a bear again. Haven't seen one in years, since popping popcorn on a camp stove when a midsize bear came galloping in the camp ground toward the smell of popcorn."

When you head up north of Ignace on 599, WATCH OUT for MOOSE! We have had several close calls from dusk through dawn. It's best to drive that stretch in daylight."
522240,Kurt,2002-07-08 20:33:00,47,Highway 599 north of Silver Dollar has lots of short construction zones. Some have some pretty good bumps. I broke a transom saver on one a couple of weeks ago. I agree with the comment on the moose. We saw lots of them.
