There were 2 guys up there the same time we were. They fished mostly dead baits for the week and they really caught the big pike. They told me that has always been their best bait at that time. They caught about 10 pike over 40"". Here is my question:What is the best dead bait to use for pike? Some use suckers, some use shiners, and others use ciscos. The guys who caught the pike were using ciscos. Next question:Where do you get the bait? I know I can get suckers and shiners here in Green Bay, but I don't know about ciscos. Could I get them once I cross the border? How much do they cost and does anyone know a good place to get them as we go thru Fort Francis, up thru Dryden to Red Lake?Thanks in advance."

Once the ice breaks up, it releases the carrion and it usually sinks to the bottom until it is eaten or until the water warms a bit. Guys in the know will fish dead baits in the shallow bays right after ice out.Answer number 2: Call your resort operator and inquire about bait shops carrying suckers. It is easy enough to kill them on your own and shove them in the freezer over night. A resort operator with high customer service skills would undoubtedly do this for you before you arrive."
