About 1 hr. later they came over to my camp and gave the my guys 100 dollars back only because they were pressured by other guys in there party.before leaving my they said I offended they (too Bad)I gave them one of my cards and told not to call.

Apathy, greed, discourtesy, etc. If it clouds our ability to act in a civil manner in the future, then the bad guys have won."

I'll bet between you and thier fishing companions they learned somthing, even though they said they were offended. (don't understand what thunderstick said but in this case the good guys made a point)"
522279,Guest,2002-07-08 13:25:00,0,"Bud, Sometimes it helps to go that extra step as you did! I wouldn't have even thought of doing it. Probably would have still been in jail after the fight from the first encounter. If you don't mind would you email me privately if you don't want to post here what camp you run on Gullrock. I fished Red Lake last year out of SunSet Lodge and had a good time but couldn't get our dates together early enough to get in this year. Thanks, Jay[email protected]"
522280,Guest,2002-07-08 13:36:00,0,Good job Bud...Those boys should have been insulted....a lot of guys would have not lectured them and instead scuffed them up a little. Everybody who has ever done much fishing in a boat has needed help of some sort at some time. The water is not a place to be in trouble and anybody who wouldnt help unless they were paid big bucks should stay home.....at least off of the Lakes I fish.......
