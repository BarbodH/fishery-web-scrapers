521914,Guest,2002-07-07 08:10:00,0,Try http://www.justfishontario.com/reports.htm and check out Silver Water Wheel Lodge They fish Vaughn and do a fishing report every week. Great detailed reports. Known for big fish lodge.
521915,Jigger1,2002-07-07 09:11:00,234,Actually Silver Water Wheel Lodge has an outpost on Vaughn Lake but they don't fish the lake from the main lodge. They have a tremendous fishery within minutes of the lodge so there is little if any need to travel 60+ minutes to Vaughn. We just returned from there and caught tons of HUGE walleye.
