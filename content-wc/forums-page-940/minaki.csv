522262,Guest,2002-07-08 10:42:00,0,"Just got back July 7th, the water is nearly 4feet high, however the fishing is starting to pick up. Our largest walleye was 25"" we used nitecrawlers during the day. After supper we pulled crankbaits through the narrows, this is where we caught most all our walleyes over three pounds. The northerns seem to be more active this year than in previous years. We released several that fell into the protected slot. The only bad news is the mayflies were starting to show up. Hope all goes well!! Hugh"
