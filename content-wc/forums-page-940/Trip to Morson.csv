522218,Guest,2002-07-06 20:45:00,0,I'm leaving next week for Morson.I'll cross the border @ baudette/rainy river.My question is can I pick-up leeches along the way to Morson?According to the map Rainy River looks like the big town.Any suggestions?
522219,Guest,2002-07-07 15:01:00,0,Just got back from morson today and I think that rainey river is your best bet. You may be able to buy them at one of the resorts in morson but you will pay through the nose. for a report see the other morson post that I answered earlier today.

The leeches were adequate to small. Frankly, my son and I did better with small tips of crawlers on jigs for walleyes. We never did catch any large walleyes, just a ton of little pecker walleyes but good action. Have fun and be safe!"
