522204,bluelund,2002-07-07 00:05:00,161,"Badger,Fished the south shore of LOTW this past week, tried downrigging one day and it was pretty slow. Got a couple of nice ones but nothing to brag about. The folks that were angling on the reefs did much better. Lot's of nice fish. I believe crawlers were the bait of choice. I didn't head all the way up to the Angle but heard reports that the fishing has been good between Stoney Point and Garden Island. Take care and good fishing,Bob M"
