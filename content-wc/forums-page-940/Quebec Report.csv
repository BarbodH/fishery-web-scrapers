522221,Guest,2002-07-07 04:49:00,0,"Just got back from a week at O'Sullivan. The weather was HOT. The walleye fishing was HOT. The bite was definitely on. Any time of day, even at midday with the sun beating down and no wind to push the boat, the walleye, once located, were extremely cooperative. Trolling stick baits located the active fish. Jigs and 'crawlers finished the job. (Slip bobber/leech anglers seemed to have some pretty good luck as well but this was not a week where finesse fishing was neccessary.) No wall-hangers this time. It was a numbers game with quantity over quality although once a school of bigger 19""-23"" fish were located, you could count on all catches running about the same size. Besides walleye, the flies and mosquitoes were biting, as well. I brought home many ""souvenirs"" on my legs and behind the ears. I wear them with pride. We did spend many hours during the week in search of big pike but they were laying low, perhaps gorging on the active walleye. Once the weather changed, we half expected the action to slow down. It didn't and for six solid days we kept fishing and they kept biting. Definitely one of the most consistent weeks of walleye fishing I've spent at O'Sullivan. I'm already counting the days until the trip. By the way, Clova Road was in great shape. Also, we did experience some of the smoky haze from the fires that are burning further north.Back to reality. Ugly reality...."
522222,Guest,2002-07-07 05:53:00,0,"good report and glad you had a great trip at o-sully, been there several times-heading up to fly from clova in a week- you say the road is in ""great "" shape""- what was your drive time on the road to the osully entrance?- i heard about the fires - how far north are they- we are flying 120 mi north of clova- they must be big because we got the haze here in pa. what was the colors that seemed to work best trooling and jigging- i talked to several friends in clova and they said it was the hottest ever several days near 100- - thanks for info and ill report when i return-"
522223,Guest,2002-07-07 07:31:00,0,"The heat was absolutely stifling. Temps in the 90's. One morning while trolling near shore, the haze was apparent even at such close proximity. It was surreal. We were unaware of the fires until the day we left (Saturday). Judging by a map of the affected area it looks like the fires are located closer to Matagami. As far as driving on the Clova Road, we left O'Sullivan at 7:45am and reached the highway at 10:05am. (For the first time in memory we were not passed even once by a local with their boat & trailer in tow.) It was dusty but washouts were rare. As far as color...orange predominated and any of the flashy (firetiger) and gold combinations rated highly. Blue, which has been a producer for us over the years laid an egg. Good luck. I wish I was going with you."
522224,Guest,2002-07-07 17:18:00,0,"Hello Thunderstick,I read that you gave good directions through Ottawa.Help please.Been up that way twice and had trouble both times.Coming up from 1000 islands bridge to 401 to 16.How do I get to 105 or what way do you have that is nice.Thanks"
522225,Guest,2002-07-08 03:13:00,0,"Ottawa has become quite easy to negotiate in the past few years. From the T.I. Bridge head east on 401 to Prescott, then north on 416 to Ottawa where you'll pick up 417 East. Stay on 417 East to the Nicholas/Lee's Ave. exit. Keep right to Lee's Ave. Turn left at stop. Continue on King Edward north to Hull and stay on Rt 5 until it runs into 105 which will take you to Maniwaki (and beyond). Unlike some other Ottawa ""short cuts"", you will be able to follow this same route in reverse upon your return. Also, if it's not inconvenient, if you cross into Canada at Ogdnsburg (especially during high traffic hours) you'll experience much less congestion. Good luck. Have fun."
522226,Guest,2002-07-08 05:13:00,0,thunderstic- i have no trouble with ottawa- but i notice you cross at the prescott bridge- i know less traffic but how is the drive up that way- i dont see a direct route from pa? thanks
522227,Guest,2002-07-08 08:53:00,0,"Walleye General, off 81 north, i think it's the last watertown exit and take rt. 37 north to Ogdensburg."
522228,Guest,2002-07-08 10:50:00,0,"WG: Bruce from PA is correct regarding 37. However, we enjoy the ""scenic route"". We take 81 to just before the TI Bridge and take Rt 12 North (east) through Alexandria Bay to Ogdesburg. It's mostly a two laner but our journey is usually at night and the traffic thins out. We really prefer driving along The River. (Proximity to fresh water is always preferred.) Also, by going almost to the TI Bridge if you turn left on 12 and go west about a mile, you'll find the Thousand Islands Bait Store which will gladly sell you worms and all those last minute lures you most likely cannot live without! Back a few years ago they were open 24/7 and it was not unusual to walk in there at 3am and have to stand in line at the cash out. Good luck. Have fun."
