522232,Jigger1,2002-07-07 09:16:00,234,Just traveled 502 on 7/3. They are installing several culverts along the northern half of 502 with a 2-3 flag stops. It appears they are making an attempt to allow the water to flow through in case of a repeat of the heavy rains they experienced in June. There were limited delays and we made good time. Did take a blast to the windshield from a rock and will be replacing this week. Only downfall to what was a tremendous trip.
