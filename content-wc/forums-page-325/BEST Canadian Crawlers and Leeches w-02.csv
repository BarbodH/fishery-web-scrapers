2871921,KM1,2014-06-05 22:03:00,374,"Ok...crossing the border in a couple of weeks at Ft Francis. Used to buy crawlers and Leeches w/02 in International Falls and bring them across the border. Thinking it might be best to simply find a good quality bait shop over the border and buy what I need. Looking for the best, fattest Canadian Crawlers and Jumbo Leeches I can get. Will likely buy 2 Flats of crawlers and 5 to 6lbs of Jumbo Leeches with oxygen. Any thoughts???"

2875329,KM1,2014-06-07 15:26:00,374,Are there any other quality bait shops west of Fort Francis on Highway 11 before one gets to Highway 71 and heads North?Hate to go East that far and have to head west after picking up bait.
2875361,Carnhzkr,2014-06-07 15:49:00,964,"You said you wanted the best leeches and crawlers. Rainy Lake Sports is the place. It's only about a mile east, maybe mile and a half. I think there's a place that sells bait in Devlin, but I've never been inside and don't know the name. It would be taking a chance to count on that. You say you used to buy leeches in IF and bring them in to Canada? That's really taking a chance since the only live bait you can bring across the border is crawlers in bedding."
2875457,KM1,2014-06-07 16:29:00,374,We used to...its has been a good 14 years since then. Rules...I am sure...have changed. We always told them at the border what we were bringing...and the bait shop in IF packaged their bait so that it could be taken across the border.Oh...if that bait shop is only 1 to 1.5 miles east...heck...that's nothing...great bait is certainly worth that drive...SOLD!!!Thanks Carnhzkr.Oh...is it best to order in advance as there website suggests...especially on the amount of bait we are going to be buying?

2878777,Aspencreek,2014-06-08 20:56:00,2911,"Rainy lake Sports is only a mile east of the border crossing, and also you will pass the best grocery store on the way, and YES call ahead and place your order, you can not only get your bait, license and whatever else you may need."
