We were planning on staying three days at another resort if we could find one to break up the long ride home. We have stayed at Endys Bush Lake Resort in the past doing this & it was a good time. I'm not sure if they are still in business, my brother has tried contacting them but, hasn't heard back from them. Anyone recommend a resort that would allow a short stay in the Geraldton area? Thank you!"
