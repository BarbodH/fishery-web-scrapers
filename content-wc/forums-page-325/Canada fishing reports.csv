Hopefully that is a good sign for those going up in the next couple of wks. including me since I am trying new water this year.

Just about all came on jigs. For the first time, every jig color with big eyeballs outfished the small eyed jigs 4 to 1. My wife was kickin my butt till I caught on! Slushfish"
2874833,Nimitz,2014-06-07 10:26:00,20,Just returned from Trout River Lodge. We had excellent fishing. Bruce Lake was very productive all week in 5 to 7 feet of water. Caught a lot of walleyes where the Trout River flows into Pakwash Lake again in 5 to 7 feet of water. We used jigs and lindy rigs tipped with leaches or worms. Members of our group also caught a large number of slot and above slot Northerns in Pakwash.

We had an excellent trip with four pike over 40 inches, 4 trophy brook trout between 19 - 21 inches, and some big walleyes, a couple over 25 inches and the largest being 28 inches, many, many 21-23 inchers. Numbers were incredible with us catching more fish than we have ever caught for a week trip even after losing one evening and the next whole day due to gale force winds and having 2 newbies along with us this year. Will try to get out a full report sometime after I unpack and get over the depression of having to leave Canada and the awesome fishing."
