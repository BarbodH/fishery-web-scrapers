2877393,RickOnt,2014-06-08 14:18:00,217,"As soon as my 2013 trip was over I was searching for a place to go in 2014.I have 2 bucket lists #1 is the ""dreamers"" list and has spots like Plummers and the Tree#2 is more realistic, and after reading James Smedley's article in Ontario Out of Doors Apisabigo was added to this list.So when the opportunity came up to Fish a Spot from the ""List"" I quickly said ""Book me In""You know its gonna be a good week when the third cast produces a nice 16 incherhttp://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e3...0/IMG_1488.jpgThe cabin was great very well equipped, Propane lights that worked perfect, 2 Fridges, Indoor shower, 4 sets of single bunks, A gas and motor shed, 5 boats and 5 motors.The water system is gravity fed and there is a pump you just start up once or twice a week No priming just give it a pull.http://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e3...0/IMG_1536.jpgWe caught fish all over and you did not need to go far This one was right from the dockhttp://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e3...0/IMG_1530.jpgPike were plentifulhttp://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e3...0/IMG_1531.jpghttp://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e3...0/IMG_1514.jpgSome very nice Walleye alsohttp://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e3...0/IMG_1520.jpghttp://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e3...0/IMG_1505.jpghttp://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e3...0/IMG_1527.jpghttp://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e3...0/IMG_1533.jpghttp://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e3...0/IMG_1490.jpghttp://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e3...0/IMG_1524.jpghttp://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e3...0/IMG_1493.jpgWe had some rain but then we had a rainbowhttp://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e3...0/IMG_1519.jpghttp://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e3...0/IMG_1518.jpgWe ate wellhttp://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e3...0/IMG_1510.jpghttp://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e3...G_1509.jpg</a>Walleye were mostly caught on Jigs with a piece of worm. Best color tails were chartreuse, orange, pink and purple.Mepps #3 and #4 Black flurry also produced well.Shad Raps in bright colors cast or trolled caught there share. The big Pike were caught on Mepps #5 bucktailThe Walleye, I believe were post spawn, the males were not milking but had the remains of a dried milk sack.We never caught a fish deeper than 16'I tried Worm Harness and bottom bouncer but to my surprise they did not produce Even the bugs were minimal I bought a fancy new bug coat and never had it on once, You could even walk up the trail to the little house and sit and not get ate up!!!Once again Martin from Outpost Camps Inc was the best!!as promised the Sat phone and Generator were at the air base on our arrival..Thanks MartinMuch AppreciatedCheersRick"
2877409,Smallmouth Hunter,2014-06-08 14:41:00,84,Sounds and looks like a great trip. Glad you had such fun and good luck. 3 days 21 hours and 19 minutes
2878889,adempsey,2014-06-08 21:21:00,963,Nice! Those are some really healthy looking fish. Cabin looked to be in top shape too. Definitely a place I'd like to spend a week.
2879585,Pymbet,2014-06-09 06:39:00,42,"Your trip sounded great. I'll echo the quality of service from Air-Dale. I have been to Apisabigo four times. With the super accomodations and the cabin setting, it has been a great place to go fly-in fishing with my wife. I am curious if you tried the portage lakes and if so if the fishing was good on those?"
2880081,515,2014-06-09 08:34:00,254,Thanks for posting the report and the camps up there are top notch for sure. we had a great time on Apisabigo lake a few years back and definitely on my hit list again for the future. Mike
2880321,RickOnt,2014-06-09 09:44:00,217,"Pym We did not go into Regis or Malmo. We were getting enough action on Apisabigo! and lots of shoreline , bays and islands to explore, We did not cover it all in a week. The water was flowing out of Malmo down the hill and we had good luck in that bay. Smokey You are very welcome and thanks once again for your info prior to our trip."
