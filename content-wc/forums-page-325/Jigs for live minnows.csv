2883361,muskyroller,2014-06-10 07:26:00,56,"I do it similarly...Hook point through the mouth and out the gills. Thread the hook through the gill, while pushing the mouth of minnow to the base of the ""jighead"". Take the hook point through the meaty side of the minnow, put it through and out the other side of the meaty side of the minnow. Make sense? No? Sorry. It does work, though. I get at least two walleyes per minnow, sometimes three, and if I'm really lucky and they're really biting 4...but then the minnow is pretty mangled."
2883633,Bill Krejca,2014-06-10 09:06:00,6107,"Using a paper punch, create a bunch of discs from the plastic lids which cover various small cup food items - margarine, sour cream, etc, etc. The colors can be varied depending on the lid chosen. After a pile of discs is created, on a flat surface tap with a small punch, or a knife point and put a very small hole/cut in each disc, this is a ""starter hole"" for the hook point, make it only large enough to allow easy insertion of the hook point. The disc will keep the bait from coming off. Good luck! Bill"
2883753,rockape,2014-06-10 09:26:00,215,Done it this way for years. They do stay on much better than any other way that I have seen.
2884633,Hewhocookstomuch,2014-06-10 13:26:00,66,"Thanks biggamefisher, there is a Bass Pro about two miles from me. I went by and purchased the Bait Button system should do the trick. Also a big thank you to all y'all who gave me some excellent advice and ideas. Walleyes are the BEST!"
2885377,yoopertrout,2014-06-10 16:06:00,1172,"Pooch, thanks again. This sounds like the best idea since sliced bread!"
2887137,biggamefisher,2014-06-11 07:44:00,540,No....the Bait Buttons are!!!!!
2881657,Hewhocookstomuch,2014-06-09 16:13:00,66,"I am sure this has been discussed, but would like some help. We will be bringing live minnows this year. We have tried frozen salted minnows, but they turn to mush within a hour in the boat even being kept in a cooler. Dried minnows, zero. My question which size jig, color for the best presentation(results)? Since we will be on Lake Saint Joseph the hooks have to be barbless, what is the best way to kept the minnow on the hook? The best way to attach the minnow to said hook? Thru the tail or body. Any advice will be appreciated, and thanks. Twelve days till wet lines."
2881681,Pooch,2014-06-09 16:24:00,4619,I fish barbless most of the time. Take a plastic worm and slice it cross sectional into 1/16 (or so) lengths. Put the minnow on then slip the cross section plastic behind the minnow. Works well for me. If the minnows are really lively you might need a little larger piece of plastic to keep them on.I watch what color of plastic worms I use as it can also act as an attractor. But don't tell my boat partners that.Pooch
2882353,yoopertrout,2014-06-09 20:02:00,1172,"Pooch, that sounds like a great idea. I'm not sure if I'm visualizing it right though. Do you cut the worm into a bunch of little discs?"
2882417,Pooch,2014-06-09 20:14:00,4619,"Yes, cut the worm into little disks. Make them as thick or thin as you need them to keep the bait on. I started doing this twenty years ago with leeches and it works for about everything including night crawlers.Glad I could help.Pooch"
2882617,1jigfish2,2014-06-09 21:14:00,110,"In the past, I have used a hole punch (for paper) to punch holes out of an old bicycle inner tube. That little disk slipped on your hook, will not let anything slip off. Another way to hook the minnow is: go down through the mouth, and out underneath the jaw, (behind the gills), roll the minnow, put hook in stomach and out center of back, behind head. You can jig a lot without losing your minnow. It sounds confusing, but try it, it works well."
2882649,Riceburner,2014-06-09 21:27:00,436,We have had great luck on St Joe with just a jig and twister tail---try white or yellow to start....a chunk of crawler also works for some scent...much cheaper and just as good as minnows.
2882769,Knoxabilly,2014-06-09 22:29:00,225,"The method you explained works amazing! A guy in MN showed me last summer, seems to help get you a few more fish out of one minnow, I'm a believer."
2882905,Hewhocookstomuch,2014-06-10 04:16:00,66,"Thank y'all for the information. Pooch, I really like your ""In my circle of friends"" saying.This boy from the South enjoys Canadian hospitality."
2882921,Joek3,2014-06-10 04:57:00,244,What a great use for old torn night crawlers! Can't wait to try.
2883161,biggamefisher,2014-06-10 06:39:00,540,"Used to pinch off bits of old twister tails to use.....but several years ago I stumbled upon a product called Bait Buttons, used it ever since and never looked back. It comes with a dispenser for single use but I can get many uses out of one button by simply replacing it on the hook again and again with my fingers . Believe Bass Pro carries it down there for you folks.https://baitbuttons.com/"
