It's only the water. You can see land near the lake just fine. Anyone else notice this about their favorite lake and if so anyone no why? 4 days 2 hours 25 minutes Thanks, Brett"

2880257,camp chef,2014-06-09 09:25:00,915,Photos are updated every few years or so. some photos better than others. Photos of the East end of Rainy lake updated last May are so clear you can see the boats at the dock and many small features. half way down the lake the resolution is not as good . Pics are older and have not been updated.
