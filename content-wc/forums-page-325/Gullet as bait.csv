It was explained that to get policy info, it may take up to 15 days, and they understand our need/desire for a statute citation. They assured me I'll get a response, and I will post it here when I do get it. BTW, the gentlemen I talked to said we COULD use the discarded parts of game fish so long as the fish were caught and consumed or processed for consumption and not caught to be cut up for bait, but he does understand our desire for the statue number.

Bait includes live or dead animals, plants or parts. See Bait (page 10), or exceptions to the Zone regulations for the Zone where you are fishing.Baitfish  Some species of fish may be used as bait in some areas (see Bait, page 10).Prohibition:  Use live fish other than those listed as baitfish (page 10) for bait. I think they are clear as to say that the fish you use as bait have to be on the list. But then they say ""live fish"" later to confuse the matter. As if dead fish or parts of dead fish would be OK even if they aren't on the list. In our camp we are overly conservative, and avoid even the possibility of being interpreted as wrong. Consequently, we don't mind at all when game wardens enter the camp. We even keep our receipts from the boarder crossing to we have proof we paid duty on our beer and liquor."

I just don't know why it should be so hard to provide the statute citation that allows or prevents certain actions..... Hello Jim, Thank you again for your inquiry. As we discussed earlier on the telephone: Under Ontario's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act section 36(5); Abandonment or spoilage of fish (5) A person who takes a fish whose flesh is suitable for human consumption shall not, (a) abandon the fish if its flesh may become unsuitable for human consumption; or (b) permit the flesh to become unsuitable for human consumption. 1997, c. 41, s. 36 (5). An individual who has caught and retained a fish that is suitable for human consumption, cannot allow the flesh of that fish to spoil. This includes all edible parts of the fish. Parts of that fish that would not be edible could legally be used as bait in areas where organic bait is permitted. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any additional questions.

2834777,Draco1206,2014-05-26 18:41:00,175,"I just received basically the same email from Matthew Garvin with the addition of one sentence specifically for Zone 2 that I fish that said ""Specific to Zone 2 where you fish. rainbow smelt (and parts there of) cannot be used as bait or possessed as use for bait"". I sent an email back to Mr. Garvin thanking him for his response but also telling him that I was not happy with his response and that I could see why there is so much confusion on this issue. I told him that I had asked specific questions regarding using parts of legally caught fish such as eyes, gullet, and belly fat and what I received was an incomprehensible bunch of legalese that leaves all kinds of wiggle room for different interpretations from different conservation officers. I also told him that I was not a lawyer and that I was just an everyday, working, Joe Lunchbucket fisherman.I asked Mr Garvin what he and the MNR consider ""parts of fish that would not be edible""? Do you mean fins, bones, and teeth or do you mean the parts I mentioned in my email, such as eyes, gullet, and belly fat? I told him I could see where some officers would say that eyes, gullet and belly fat are ""edible parts of fish"" and I could also see how other officers could interpret it to mean ""parts of fish not normally considered edible by humans"" and could therefore legally be used as bait.I told Mr. Garvinn that I was leaving this Friday May 30th to fish in Zone 2 and had hoped for a more definitive response from the MNR before I left (but that doesn't look like that will happen)."
2834801,Draco1206,2014-05-26 18:45:00,175,At least Bigwalleye1 and I received basically the same response from the MNR. They are at least trying to be consistent in their incoherence.
2885553,bigwalleye1,2014-06-10 17:02:00,2632,"I finally made another attempt to get the definitive word, looking for the statute that allows gullet as bait, although I had my suspicions, and those suspicions are now borne out in the email I sent and received today, which is posted below. From my read, there are things you cannot do, and unless it says you can't, then you CAN. Makes some sense, then, similar to laws in the state, i.e., you can't troll in these waters. But it doesn't say you can cast, jig, rig, bobber fish, drift, etc. Hopefully with this, it's the info we need, for it doesn't sound like there's any more info to be had. If all else fails, don't use gullet, and when you see the MNR, ask about it. Like law enforcement at home, some can be downright pleasant, esp. if you ask them to speak from their store of knowledge or opinion. That's the guy that's likely to be the one stopping you anyway. Best of luck to us all. Email string below. Hi Jim, Not a pest at all! My apologies for not responding to your previous question. I had flagged our conversation as having been resolved but had not responded to your last question. An individual with a recreational fishing licence as defined by the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act (O. Reg 664/98) is allowed to fish in the Province of Ontario. Individuals fishing in the province are subject to the regulations identified in the Ontario Fishery Regulations (OFR's). The OFR's identify things that anglers cannot do and restrictions upon their activities. Among other things the OFR's identify where and when anglers can harvest and use bait and types of bait and gear that are prohibited. It does not specifically list everything that can possibly be used as bait. The wastage of fish and wildlife is broader than fisheries alone which is why that regulation applies more broadly than the Ontario Fishery Regulations and is instead covered by the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act. That is the most pertinent piece that relates to the use of fish parts as bait (Unless the area is subject to no Organic bait regulations). In short, legislation does not say specifically all the things that you can use as bait, it just describes the prohibited types of bait and areas where certain types of bait are prohibited. Other than in areas where organic bait is prohibited, there is no restriction on the use of fish parts as bait, so long as the parts that are being used were not suitable for human consumption. Please give me a call if you require any additional clarification, I'll be pleased to discuss. Otherwise please enjoy your trip to Ontario.

Thanks guys.Sharon"
2775865,JayM5209,2014-05-09 08:17:00,1050,"Sharon, I'm sure it's state by state, and all states have their fishing regulations on line where the question can be researched. In Texas, where I've done a fair bit of winter fishing on the south Texas Gulf coast, the use of ""cut bait"" is very, very common. Cut bait is simply a chunk of fish. When surf fishing I frequently cut a small whiting into pieces to use as cut bait for reds, black drum, or other surf dwellers. While it is legal to do so, it would be good to check the Texas regs to see if they say anything about using parts of fish that are classified as game fish.You can find the Texas fishing regs at the Tx Dept. of Parks and Wildlife website- http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/regulations/outdoor-annual/Aaaah . . . . . . .

This supervisor said that this is problem as some of the people in the MNR donot have a complete knowledge of the regulations and give wrong advice which can cause problems for fishermen"
2768633,bigwalleye1,2014-05-07 14:32:00,2632,"Here we go again. Here's the MNR response to my email as a cut and paste: Hello, Thank you for your inquiry. The use of dead fish or fish parts as bait for angling is allowed as long as:  they have been obtained in a legal manner (e.g. are not from a specially protected species, meet requirements regarding size or quota, etc.);  there is no specific water body prohibition against their use (e.g. in some lakes/rivers the use of fish or fish parts as bait is banned); and  fish flesh is not wasted (allowed to become unsuitable for human consumption, or abandoned) for the express purpose of obtaining the fish or fish parts to be used as bait (note that bellies, fins and eyes are not usually consumed by humans). We hope you find this information helpful. If you require further assistance please contact the Natural Resources Information Centre at 1-800-667-1940. For what it's worth, folks. We now have back to back posts from the same governing body with diametrically opposed positions."
2768697,stjoeguy,2014-05-07 14:39:00,979,"Sorry for the confusion this caused. My source was a copy of an email found on the internet. Who knew that emails or the internet would lie? Does this mean I shouldn't believe all the political emails I get from my friends? Or I'm not going to become a millionaire by helping out an African prince that needs money transferred?I've never used gullet and it looks like I won't get to try it this year either. Still, I'd really like to see a written regulation somewhere. As judged by the conflicting emails, calls, etc Ontario has really done a poor job of publishing this regulation. I've looked and looked for it. The following are examples of regulations I've found. Some prohibit it and some allow it, but at least they publish the regulation and make it easy to find.Minnesota: page 28 of the Minnesota regulations. Using whole or parts of game fish, goldfish, or carp for bait is unlawful.Quebec: Live bait is prohibited with exceptions. In waters where baitfish is permitted, it is prohibited to use, whether live or dead, whole or cut-up…….walleyeManitoba: Offal (fish cleaning remains) may be used as bait.Saskatchewan: No live bait. Non-edible parts of fish taken by angling, such as eye, belly skin or internal organs can be used as bait.Thanks for everyone's efforts."
2768705,stjoeguy,2014-05-07 14:40:00,979,And now it looks like I can use gullet again. I give up.
2768721,bigwalleye1,2014-05-07 14:43:00,2632,"Would you please post a link to your read in your post below, and identify your lake? I quote the 2014 Ontario Fishing Regulations (this is part of an ""exception"" listed for one of the lakes in Zone 4 for example): ""...Fish or fish parts may not be used as bait from Jan. 1 - Fri. before 3rd Sat. in May."" That would imply that you CAN use fish parts as long as there is no specific exception listed for the lake/river you will be fishing. You need to look in the regulations under the Zone you'll be fishing, then continue to read the list of exceptions and look for any that apply to the specific lake you'll be on. Note that I saw the exception quoted above in a number of places in this year's regulations. I tried a look on my own and couldn't find what you're referencing. ONE MORE TIME. I called the MNR number in the email response I posted and asked 3 very specific questions, and I hope when they return my call we'll get everything we need. I asked: 1. Is the use for game fish parts (eyes, gullet, belly strip, or discarded parts from the fish cleaning operation) legal for use as bait in Ontario? 2. Since I fish Lac Seul, is it legal or illegal for use on Lac Seul and the English River System? 3. Finally, please provide me a the citation from the laws that either allows or disallows the use so that I may read, review, print and carry it with me. ...and don't any of youse guys say anything about salted minnows, cause I ain't going there!!!"

2764769,tooski,2014-05-06 16:45:00,393,"Thanks Prov, appreciate the post. I will say years back (more than 10?) I had outfitters tell me it was illegal. Personally can't see the harm in it if you are eating the rest, but certainly not my call."
2765041,Guest,2014-05-06 17:55:00,0,"We have been using gullet and belly meat for years from walleye that we keep for eating. In fact Leuenberger's used to print it out as a tip from Dan Gapen on their lake maps they handed out some 25 years ago. After reading some posts years ago about it being illegal, I too contacted the MNR by e-mail and received basically the same reply as stjoeguy. ""Any part of a legally caught fish that would normally be considered non edible or fit for human consumption may be used for bait."" The MNR officer also stressed that ""any part that is used for bait is also counted against your daily limit."" So for instance if you had a conservation license that allows you to keep 2 walleyes you could not possess 8 eyes or 5 gullets. you would be over your limit. Also if you had two walleyes on your stringer you could not use or have in your possession any walleye fish parts at all. We simply cut off a large chunk of the white belly fat and toss it in some salted water and while we're fishing we cut 3 inch strips off of the larger piece and add it to our jig and twister tail. It lasts a long time and it works as good as minnows as far as our group is concerned. Not to mention a whole lot cheaper too. Just remember to count any fish part/parts against your daily limit. I always keep the MNR e-mail response with me on our fly-ins just to be safe."
2765193,phishfearme,2014-05-06 18:36:00,1242,"I finally was able to dig out my letter from the MNR concerning the use of belly meat. the letter is from David Ballak, Biologist from the Chapleau District and is dated 2/11/1997 - I would post the entire letter but my scanner is on the blink. he states: ""The question of using belly meat to dress a lure. This practice is illegal in Ontario. No part of a game fish can be used as bait."" I recall other discussions with an Officer Maw concerning this when he ""visited"" our cabin and he confirmed this is not legal. that was at least 10 years ago. I asked him if it's ok to use the belly from filleted fish and he said ""how am I supposed to know that?"" I guess it makes sense. so, did the laws change? maybe - I'm not much of a historian but I can see arguments for and against either way. phish"
2765889,btmbncr,2014-05-06 22:29:00,492,"I used a Lindy Fuzzy Grub,Chartruese, in color,I think a 1/4 oz if my feeble mind remembers correctly with a strip of gullet to catch saugers(big ones) and walleyes below the Ft Peck Dam in Montana in the spring, about maybe about 26 years ago.There is a lip/lift(for you river rats) close to a point below the dam plus a nice hole by a Russian Olive tree.In the evening if there was sufficient water running through the dam,it was a hot bite.Not big fish but solid 2 to 3 lbers.A Montana Fish and Game employee that will forever remain nameless showed me this bite/bait.I did give him an AKC female Golden Retriever puppy,that they named Sadie, in appreciation for this tip.He later,years later, said it was the best family/bird hunting dog he ever had.It slept with his youngest daugther if I remember correctly. Gullet strips rock!! Bill"
2766417,Guest,2014-05-07 07:01:00,0,"NO WAY ITS LEGAL. Unless you can prove you ate that fish and you can prove what length that fish was, which is pretty much impossible. I will agree, it depends on the officer, but why chance it."
2766473,bigwalleye1,2014-05-07 07:04:00,2632,"Or at least we'll see what TODAY's answer is. I just emailed the MNR re: use of belly/gullet in Ontario waters in general, and also in Lac Seul in particular. I'll post the response when I receive it."
2766841,phishfearme,2014-05-07 08:07:00,1242,"the laws may have indeed changed - however, I will bet if you continue to ask this question of various MNR personnel you will continue to get different answers. look at the salted minnow thread - different answers as to weather you can bring them up from the US or not. we used belly meat for years - it's deadly - I think more for pike than walleye but deadly none the less. while at ray's lake in the 80's I was asked by the owner to help out a group who had been there for 3 days and only had caught a handful of fish. I spent a day with them casting belly meat and did quite well. I saw them the next day hacking on a small pike they had just caught to get the belly meat then thru the pike into the bush. that's when I started asking about the legality of using belly meat. so, if you kill and fillet a walleye for dinner then use the belly meat from the fish for bait, that's legal? to quote CO Donnie Maw ""how is he supposed to know (that you didn't just kill a fish for the belly meat)? phish"

The regulations I saw all deal with live bait. While searching, however, I ran across this post regarding using perch eyes as bait:I decided to send an email to the MNR to confirm whether or not it is legal to use perch eyes. The official MNR response says that any part of any type of fish that is not normally used as human consumption can be used as bait. Here is a copy of the email:Hello, Thank you for your enquiry. You may use the non-edible parts of game fish as bait such as the eyes, entrails, fins and the head. You may not use these parts if you don't intend to keep the fish you are removing the parts from. To use any part of the flesh of game fish is wasting/abandoning flesh suitable for human consumption. This is illegal under the Ontario Fishery Regulations. You may only use the species of baitfish listed on page 10 of the 2012 Ontario Fishing Regulations Summary as live bait in Ontario. To view the 2012 Ontario Fishing Regulations Summary online, please visit http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_163615.html If you require further assistance please contact the Natural Resources Information Centre at the toll free number below. Regards, NRIC web reader - CG Sounds logical to me. I also ran across several fishing camp sites that mentioned using the gullet as bait. I'm always interested in trying new bait. What do you think? Try gullet this year?"

I'd only use gullets from fish I just cleaned for shore lunch as it would not be ""right"" to kill a fish just for bait. Once I pulled the gullets out of the shorelunch fish, I'd just toss those pieces in the minnow bucke t to keep them from drying out."

2764185,dkrusin,2014-05-06 13:53:00,97,"Only one problem. If you are fishing a lake with slot limits and you have parts of a game fish in your boat while fishing how are you going to prove it was a legal fish. Was on Lake St Joe a few years back. Was stopped while fishing. Had a walleye fillet (skin on) in the cooler, $150.00 fine because they couldn't measure it. They didn't say a word about the beer in the cooler. The fish that you catch and keep may be cleaned. However, please remember that fish taken from waterbodies where size limits are in effect must be readily measurable at all times, unless the fish are:Being prepared for immediate consumptionPrepared at an overnight accommodation for storageBeing transported on the water from a temporary overnight accommodation to your residence and you are not engaged in sport fishingBeing transported overland."
2764209,bones82,2014-05-06 13:53:00,121,Have used this before. Works well and stays on the hook until you have to cut it off.
2764329,deadhead1,2014-05-06 15:03:00,193,If the walleye are hitting hard it works well. I find if it a slow bite I have better luck with live bait or frozen minnows.
2764353,bones82,2014-05-06 15:05:00,121,I outfished live bait with this when the bite was slow.
2764417,phishfearme,2014-05-06 15:19:00,1242,"""You may use the non-edible parts of game fish as bait such as the eyes, entrails, fins and the head. You may not use these parts if you don't intend to keep the fish you are removing the parts from."" this is TOTALLY different than responses of previous MNR personnel. I would have to dig out my older snail mail letter but it was made VERY CLEAR to me that ""NO part of a game fish may be used as bait in Ontario"". only bait fish may be used. again, we get different answers from different Ministry people. phish"
