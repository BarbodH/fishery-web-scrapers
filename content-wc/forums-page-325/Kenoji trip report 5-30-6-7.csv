We caught well over 1200 fish this past week with 6 first timers in the crew. We caught more 20+ in walleye in one day than we did at Coles in a week(and that was a good week too). There are several good places to fish, and it is a very easy lake to navigate. We did well with jig and minnow (once we got the new folks up to speed on how to feel the bite we started cutting them in pieces and putting them on a jig with or without a twister tail. Leeches and crawlers were decent too. The artificials alone worked throughout the week with the best being a jig with a creme minnow. The water was really high while we were there so the northerns were way back in the weeds. Due to that, Johnson silver minnows in gold or silver were easier to fish with. We didn't catch too many big northerns though we did see some huge ones in the bays when the sun was out. I wish we could have fished a bit more for them but all I had were daredevil spoons and they would hang up on the weeds. For this lake a fish finder is definitely worth the weight to bring with you. We had one boat catch 105 walleye one morning before lunch! All in all another great trip, weather was great for us with only one rain day though the water was really high. We didn't fish much down the lake on the south end as the water temp was only in the 40's and the flow was really strong coming out of wabikimi, up the lake it was as high as 65 degrees. If you like to explore this a good lake for it, you can ride literally hours in the slim river and palisade lake. Great fishing, great guys, great outfitter...makes me ready to start planning the next trip! For those going on trips later this summer I hope you have as good a time as we did and enjoy every minute of it, the time flies!"

2883193,tooski,2014-06-10 06:43:00,393,Thanks for the report. I have gone with PFO in the past and he is top notch. Maybe just a bit pricey but much closer which saves hours of drive time....
