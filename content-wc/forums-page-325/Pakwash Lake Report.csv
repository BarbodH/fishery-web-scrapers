Other groups have also had success. The weather is very hot so the bite isn't constant, but has been decent. Will post later this week with another update"

I picked up a 31"" (my personal best) and another of our group - my cousin's wife - scored a 30"" on her first trip north. Both released. I also picked up a couple of 27"" fish and plenty of over 18's. We don't count fish but many, many Walleyes caught. It was one of those years when we didn't take one for home that was shorter than 17"". Big Northern was 40"" but we had a couple of 38's as well. We lost track of how many slot Northerns we caught. Throw in the occasional Smallmouth (my big was 19"") and some jumbo Perch and this was our best week any could remember! All fish were shallow and very hungry. We had minnows but I didn't use a single one all week. For me, all just from jigging artificials. Many thanks to Rob and Nancy at Snake Falls Camp!"
