But soon enough.. there will be lots of"

It can be difficult to fish sometimes because of the amount of water. It's a river system also depending on the water level which might be high in June. I would take a fish finder for sure. Also go to Hawk Air's website and print off lake maps and keep them in the boats. Make sure you check out the water falls (on the map). Also pictographs. The trip to elbow lake can be fun but some years a challenge to get to (Water level). Not sure if there are motors at trump lake. In 2013 there where not. Ask the pilot. If you do go over to trump lake it's amazing deep water over 100 ft deep can reward some nice lake trout. The cabin is very nice has 2 refrigerators, gas stove, 2 out houses, 2 boat docks, generator, solar water pump, shower room built on front of cabin and well sealed to keep the bugs out. I did catch a 30 inch walleye back in 2003. Fun trip, enjoy."

I'll make sure to print up the maps for each boat. I'm hoping to spend at least one day fishing Elbow Lake (heard theirs good Pike fishing in their) and Lake Trout in Trump. I'll be there from June 22-29 and will let you know when I get back how we did!
