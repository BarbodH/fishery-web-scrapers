2884313,CMesserschmidt,2014-06-10 11:59:00,1006,Friends dad said he saw 5 moose on the way home last thursday from Sioux Lookout. I learned my lesson of speeding when I had a close call with a monster bull moose and my new truck at 1:30am headed to Lac Suel..
2885481,Smallmouth Hunter,2014-06-10 16:39:00,84,The van directly in front of us hit 2 deer and just missed a 3rd a few years ago near Sioux Narrows. It wasn't a pretty site. Both of the deer hit were mortally injured and the van was a mess. 3 seconds difference and it would have been us. The worst for us seems to be the stretch fron Eau Claire to Duluth. We travel that around 3am to 6 am and always see deer. One year we counted 53 in that 3 hour stretch. I was a nervous wreck and had no problem staying awake. Be careful. 1 day 18 hours 21 minutes

2885625,55walleyes,2014-06-10 17:21:00,131,I will second that the stretch from Duluth to Eau Claire beeing dangerous at night. Hit a large doe doing about 55 on way home at 3 AM one year. I was riding shotgun and remember the collision quite vividly.
2886081,Yaba,2014-06-10 20:01:00,88,Drove to Thunder Bay Sunday afternoon. Saw 4 cows and a Bull between Dinorwic and Ignace. Saw 1 more cow between Ignace and Tbay. Couple deer as well. I think the bugs are driving them into the open!
