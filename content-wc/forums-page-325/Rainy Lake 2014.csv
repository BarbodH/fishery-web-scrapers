We portage in from Minnesota and had a great trip.There was ice on Lake Superior as we headed into Minnesota.That was a first. Water temps warmed continuously through the week All fish were in post spawn and it took a few days to find the big Girls. They were in 30 to 40 feet of water and super hungry.One of our new guys is a fly rod guy and 2 days in a row caught Smallies , Northerns and Walleye on the same homemade fly. Cool stuff if you are a fly fisherman. The weather got hot mid week. 85 degrees two days in a row but it didn't stop the Walleyes. Good luck to all going up soon."

Could you tell me about what we can expect as far as the cabins, essentials we should definitely bring and a few pointers to get us started on finding fish. We're looking for anything that will bite. Have to keep the boys & wife busy."
