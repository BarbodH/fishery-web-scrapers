We will be south of Ear Falls in a few weeks and since my wife and I are alone, knowing what channel we might get help on if needed would be of value. Is there a common emergency hailing channel?I see very few boats with a VHF radio on Lac Seul. We have had a VHF radio system on our farm for nearly forty years and it is invaluable. We use marine band radios on one other fall trip to Lac Seul with our group that also have radios in their boats. I'd hate to not have it with me. Saved one of our boats several years ago when they had boat trouble and if not for the radio we would have been hard pressed to figure out where they were when they didn't return that evening.Pooch"

I think these channels (except for 16) can be used by recreational traffic in Canada as well as the US, and I know 16 is used for hailing and/or emergency in both countries."
