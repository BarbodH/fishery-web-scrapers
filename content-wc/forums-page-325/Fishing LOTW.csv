2882545,Redline,2014-06-09 20:52:00,73,I'm also thinking of going way back into Yellow Girl if the fish are shallow.
2884097,Ver88,2014-06-10 10:42:00,114,"Do you catch many perch while walleye fishing? We used to catch a lot of nice perch,but they have been hard to find in recent years. Would love to get back into some jumbo perch."
2860873,Redline,2014-06-03 08:03:00,73,"We always jig. I usually use a 3/8 jig with Gulp/Leech/Frozen Minnow. Of course we snag a bit, especially the younger ones, but that's how we catch the most fish."
2864833,chevysgeterdun,2014-06-04 06:19:00,501,Any reports from last weekend?
2869033,deadhead1,2014-06-05 07:45:00,193,Still slow at north end of lake. Been talking to locals and a few guys have found them but most say it is still slow.
2869049,Redline,2014-06-05 07:48:00,73,"I'm assuming this is just the post spawn recovery which would happen typically around this time or a week or two earlier. I think when I was in Sioux Narrows last year during Mid June, we hit this period on the dot due to the terrible spring.I'm hoping by next weekend they've moved to their deeper spots and picked up the post spawn bite."
2869385,chevysgeterdun,2014-06-05 09:03:00,501,Talked to buddies who went 4 miles on Canada side from youngs bay last night....burnt up 2 dozen minnows . Not sure of the size....didn't get all the details yet. We are on the road now.
2877321,Redline,2014-06-08 14:02:00,73,Anyone have any updates from this weekend? I head up Wednesday to Sioux Narrows.
2878177,Ver88,2014-06-08 18:20:00,114,I am also heading up to sioux narrows on Wednesday and would appreciate any recent reports.
2879833,Redline,2014-06-09 07:40:00,73,Ver88 where are you staying?
2881889,Ver88,2014-06-09 18:14:00,114,I am staying in snake bay at white pine lodge. I usually fish around sunset channel area for walleyes some around whitefish bay for everything else. I hope the walleyes are shallow when we get there.
2882537,Redline,2014-06-09 20:51:00,73,"Nice, We fish just North of Cliff Island, so very close to the same area. I've got a shallow place right off the bat to start with on Thursday."
2845121,Redline,2014-05-29 11:02:00,73,"I'll be fishing exactly 2 weeks from today. I just wonder how much movement they'll have in those 2 weeks. We've found them all over the board the last 20 years. Shallow...Deep...in bays, on humps...everything."
2848489,deadhead1,2014-05-30 09:40:00,193,Redline--hard to say how much they will move in two weeks but I have to expect that by then spawn will be over. I am starting to get some small walleye off rocky points.
2850577,fishanytime,2014-05-30 21:10:00,63,Trout are being caught in 30-40 feet using cow bells and cisco's. Run the bait at 15 to 20 feet.
2853705,chevysgeterdun,2014-06-01 07:27:00,501,Out group is going up to Youngs Bay first week of june. Whats the water temps like? Warming up fast?
2853865,Redline,2014-06-01 08:13:00,73,I read a report from the 27th that temps in Whitefish Bay were 50 in open water to 68 in the bays. Rising fast too.
2856969,deadhead1,2014-06-02 08:33:00,193,My wife and I were over to Sioux Narrows for lunch on weekend and I overheard one of the guides saying they had gotten into one of the best bites he has ever seen for large numbers of fish. I didn't ask where they were fishing but he did say he had asked other guides and knew where the fish weren't. That makes a lot of sense if you think about it.
2857225,LOW1,2014-06-02 09:45:00,2828,"We had success last week using frozen ciscos rigged with slip sinkers in the area known as ""The Narrows"" south and west of Sioux Narrows. It was warm last week so I suspect that the water temps will be quickly rising-perhaps deeper areas would now be better?"
2858209,chevysgeterdun,2014-06-02 13:09:00,501,So they are on the move...?
2858305,Redline,2014-06-02 13:38:00,73,"I'm thinking they're moving out of the shallows to summer humps?These temps have been pretty darn warm. I'm wondering if the fish are moving along now. I've got my spots to try....I've got a tough crowd, my 8 and 10 year old nephews who expect fish!"
2860817,chevysgeterdun,2014-06-03 07:49:00,501,We mostly just verticle jig or pull bottom bouncers and minnows/gulp...what do you guys normally do? Rocks can be killer ont he bottom bouncer population lol
2833993,Lazy Fisherman,2014-05-26 11:45:00,276,We are first timers heading to Lake of the Woods near Sioux Narrows next week. Anybody have any tips to help us get started catching? We would like to primarily target walleyes. Thanks.
2836241,USNwalleye,2014-05-27 08:41:00,1,"I've been fishing Nestor Falls/Sioux Narrows since 1987 or so. Unfortunately, we aren't getting up there this year. I would get in touch with Big John at the Mineshaft. He is an excellent guide and can help get you pointed in the right direction."
2836585,patricktjms,2014-05-27 09:57:00,67,"I havent spent a ton of time around that area as i was usually north of there but concentrate on points, drop offs, and some structure around islands. I used to have good luck trolling and jigging in between islands and main land when they were close to each other. (less than 100 feet apart)"
2836657,deadhead1,2014-05-27 10:12:00,193,I am further north near Kenora but so far walleye have been hard to find. They are still in shallow and starting to disperse to the deeper lake areas. I would concentrate on shallow points near shallow bays and if you do try deeper humps concentrate on those closest to shallow bays. I'm sure if you ask around at the bait shops and at the tourist center they will head you in the right direction.
2837353,mrpike24,2014-05-27 12:33:00,54,"I'll be up in about 2.5 weeks so don't have any current information and am on the Northern side of the lake, so don't know your area in particular. It was an extremely late ice out this year, and would guess walleye's are just wrapping up the spawn if they haven't already....I would imagine bigger fish are tough to come by now, and during the next week or so, but things should start picking up, especially with the warm weather they have been having. I would look shallow in the afternoon, when water is at it's warmest. Look for southern facing bays, or windblown points/bays, water will be warmer there. They should take off into a feeding frenzy once they've recovered from the spawn. Otherwise, just try and get a lay of the land and trust your electronics, cover as much water as possible....look for fish and bait, cover ground by trolling/casting cranks or pulling bottom bouncers quickly until you start marking fish. Then you can slow down and finesse them if necessary. Any rocky shorelines with good sized boulders will hold a little bit of everything this time of year, bass and walleye in particular, if you can get a good wind blowing into that shoreline, even better. Don't overlook shallow humps or points either. Good luck...."
2839889,fishanytime,2014-05-28 05:14:00,63,"Mr. Pike gives good advice, I have been fishing the Sioux Narrows area since the opener. Small walleyes (10-14 inches) are in 36-50 feet off inland points. The humps are not producing that well yet and the big walleyes are moving to spawn or spawning now. Some are being caught casting to shore. Perch have not spawned yet and pike are in shallow weed areas. Water temps range from 50 to 69 in the bays. Ice out in the big water was May 20 so it has been another different start to the fishing season. It should be getting better every day now, we caught lots of small walleyes and a few big perch yesterday"
2839897,Lazy Fisherman,2014-05-28 05:20:00,276,Thanks for all the great info. Looking forward to exploring and fishing the lake.
2839961,Lazy Fisherman,2014-05-28 06:00:00,276,"Fishanytime, do you know if there is a good lake trout bite happening now?"
2844961,Redline,2014-05-29 10:45:00,73,"I've been fishing out of Sioux Narrows every Fathers Day weekend for over 20 years. I'd love to hear where people are finding the fish regarding depths. I have about 20 spots I hit, but it's always a challenge to find the depths. Last year was rough with the terrible spring. I'm hoping this string of 80s will help out even with the late ice out. If people could just share how they have done, that'd be awesome. I'm more than willing to share my spots as well."
2845097,deadhead1,2014-05-29 10:59:00,193,"It seems to me that walleye are starting to bite now. Still good size fish in shallow, casting to shoreline in 3 to 12 feet of water. Fish are still not biting agressivly so you have to be slow and easy in presentation. Some smaller ones showing up on shallow humps."
