2875577,Further North,2014-06-07 17:53:00,2008,"Saturdays on HWY 53 between where I live and Eau Claire are kinda interesting...16.9 miles showed us 54 boats this afternoon. That's 3.195266272189349 boats per mile, but who's counting?"
2876153,btmbncr,2014-06-08 00:23:00,492,Friday's aren't depressing to me.I'm retired and try to stay off the water Saturday and Sunday.I fish Monday through Friday and only fish the weekends if my kids come home to fish.I see enough boats headed to Oahe on Highway 12 towards the weekends to keep me off the water and home.Bill
2878433,Fishin Fun,2014-06-08 19:17:00,218,What the heck you doing at 1:23am posting here? Only time I'm up that early (or late) is to go to the bathroom. Ha!!
2880425,labsrus,2014-06-09 10:28:00,557,Last Friday we drove east of Rochester just past Syracuse to vistin a college that my sone is transerring to in the fall. When we go to Canada we head up Rt 81 and go over the 1000 Island bridge. This past Friday there were lots of boats heading somewhere. Always try to check out others guys rigs and wonder where they are going Way too much time before we head to Canada
2872449,Fishin Fun,2014-06-06 07:56:00,218,I travel I-35 every day for work. I usually spend about 25 minutes on it traveling south to work. Well every Friday after opener all I do while driving to work is count the number of boats heading north. Today it was 22. Last Friday it was 21. Oh how I wish I was one of them. Only 56 more days.
2872521,walleye IA,2014-06-06 08:15:00,129,"Funny, I was just talking to some coworker yesterday about the same thing."
2872529,Lovetofish,2014-06-06 08:22:00,458,"4 weeks from today it will be me driving up 35W, about 7AM through your town. How is the road construction this year?"
2872569,Gregking,2014-06-06 08:34:00,2658,I too am excited to get up there
2872689,Fishin Fun,2014-06-06 09:39:00,218,I depends on what time you're coming through. They are down to 1 lane northbound and southbound due to the replacement of a bridge. It's going to be a 2 year project I guess. I come home around 6pm on Fridays and there is a backup going north and south. So weekends get kind of bad. The earlier you go through the better it is. So 7am should be a breeze.
2872841,CMesserschmidt,2014-06-06 10:37:00,1006,26 more days for me... I drive either 35E or 35W coming from the north metro everyday. All I can say is I am jealous of all the guys heading north with boats!Even worse yesterday talking to my buddies dad who goes to his lake house on Lac Seul almost every other weekend. Said fishing was decent this past weekend. I just keep telling myself 26 more days and I'll see you up there!
2872993,Pooch,2014-06-06 11:31:00,4619,"Not really on subject, but... kind of related.Every trip as we travel to and from Canada I think to myself that ""all the optimist's are headed north and all the pessimist's are headed south"".Just a recurring thought each trip.Pooch"
2873009,Hot Runr Guy,2014-06-06 11:34:00,16061,"you could always mess with 'em, and hang a sign from your front bumper saying;DON'T BOTHER, NO FISH! HRG"
2873033,Smallmouth Hunter,2014-06-06 11:40:00,84,This Friday is the last Friday before we leave. So this Friday isn't too depressing but I agree on the rest. 6 days and 20 minutes.
2873113,itsme,2014-06-06 12:22:00,31,Itsme again Are you making spinning lures this year??? Your mfg facilities are the greatest. My daughter used to be your Postmaster... Now do you know who Itsme is???
