For Walleyes: Crawler harnesses'(orange, chartruese, gold and silver blades), various weights of Lindy type sinkers and jigs of various weights and colors. You will go through tremendous amounts of live bait and lures."
533180,eyewitness,2003-07-02 19:51:00,680,"The very large silver and hammered gold blades are the ticket to BIG fish. Been doing the LS trip for 8 years running and have learneds this to be an edge on getting the piggies. Also, try some Berkley Power Crawlers instead of real nitecrawlers. They work excellent. The natural colored ones with the chartruese or orange tails are the ticket. Personally I prefer jigging with minnows up there. Especially if you want #'s of nice fish 18-25"". Gold Prism Eye Northland Jigs are tops and tip them with white 3-4"" Berkley Power grubs if you're on fish and they're snapping. It will save you time and you'll catch more fish when you're not rebaiting every minute or so. Again, I'd go to spinners with BIG blades for the 28"" plus eyes. Hasn't failed me yet. If you choose to chase the big snot rockets I would bring some larger 3-4"" Johnson Silver Minnows and cast them in the back bay areas with any cabbage or trees in the water. We get big pike as shallow as 3-4' of water as long as there's some cover for them. The silver minnows seem to be the best thing to work through all the cover without getting hung up. Silver and Firetiger seem to be the best colors. Silver if it's sunny, firetiger if it's cloudy. Wish i was going there myself. Just got back from Edmonton yesterday and my arms are plum wore out from catching walleye. Don't think I'd survive Lac Suel right now.....:) Have a great trip!"
533210,Vitreum,2003-07-03 17:03:00,221,thanks guys. i think i already have enough crawler harness components to make a thousand. every color and size. same goes for jigs and plastics. i was thinking more about cranks or hard baits.
