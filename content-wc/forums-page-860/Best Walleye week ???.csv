533099,Guest,2003-07-01 08:38:00,0,"We just got back from Moose Lake, Manitoba. Four of us caught around 600 Walleye with the biggest being 29"" and another 450 Pike with several fish over 40"". It was our first trip to Moose Lake and we are going back, it was awesome."

533031,Guest,2003-06-30 06:43:00,0,"Would like to hear about how your week of fishing was...how many Walleye....biggest......Eight of us caught over 700 Walleye on Lac Seul with the biggest being 28""."
533034,Guest,2003-06-30 08:01:00,0,"We just got back from Allanwater. The fishing was half as good as last year. We still caught 1-2 dozen per guy per day. My biggest fish was a 37"" pike and had 3 20 something Walleye. My keeper for the week was 19.5"". All told our group only caught about 10 over 20"" with the biggest at 24-25"". The water was really down and the weather was warm the first three days. The fishing picked up when the weather turned south (got nasty). The big pike was fun. It was heavy but don't know how much. I've got video of it before I recesitated it. On the other hand, Mosquitos and black flies barely made an appearance this year. That was a plus."
533038,jzstiff,2003-06-30 08:15:00,188,"Went the second week of the season to Lake Kabinakigami. I personally caught 301 fish that week. Only kept 2 per day to eat. Caught a 10 pounder and released it back to the water. Also caught a 36 1/2"" northern that got released as well. Had more fun than a person has a right to and am looking forward to next year already. Only 327 days til I go back."
533039,Guest,2003-06-30 08:29:00,0,"I fished for a week on Lac Seul and caught three Walleye. The biggest was 14""."
533048,Guest,2003-06-30 11:35:00,0,"Euker, you caught three, and the best was 14""?! You're talking Lac Suel, CANANDA, right? Good one!! ;^)"
533049,Guest,2003-06-30 11:54:00,0,"Euker, you stink! Or you were fishing in January. Last year at this time, from June 26th to July 2 (approximately) I had eight master angler (29+) qualifying fish and 84 that were 25+ in the boat on Lac Seul (we keep detailed records). That is 12 25+/day for that week."
533061,Guest,2003-06-30 14:13:00,0,"Euker, something is wrong here. We fish Lac Suel in late July and generally catch about 100 Walleye per day (3 people). Although I haven't done a fly in I fish about 100 days per year (retired) and have never found a better Walleye Lake then Lac Suel. As an aside we also caught several Northern over 10 lbs., many on top water lures."
533062,IA  DAN,2003-06-30 14:28:00,53,Euker You must of been to busy netting Mikes fish.We have a guy like that up at Blackbay also.Only 25 more days and we'll be there. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH.
533065,Guest,2003-06-30 14:56:00,0,You got it IA DAN. Poor old Euker was just to busy netting over 400 Walleye that I caught this year. Euker runs a mean net ....but his rod and reel just take up space in the boat.
533070,rebelrn2001,2003-06-30 17:09:00,1563,"Got back from LS 11 days ago. We had 6 guys (but averaged 5.1/day fishing as 2 got there Sunday evening and my partner and I left Friday morning. We caught 1183 walleye (and at least 150 pike) and several perch. One guy had 2 muskie's hit his walleye as he realed them in. The biggest was 27.5"". Probably at least 50 were 25-26"". At one point my partner and I caught 4 26""er's in a row."
