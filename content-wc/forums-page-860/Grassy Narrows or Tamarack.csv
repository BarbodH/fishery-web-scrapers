ANyway, I am interested in a smallmouth/walleye trip, housekeeping for 4 guys and would like the pluses and minus of each of these camps. I see that Tamarack is slightly cheaper but that is not a major consideration. The trip would be mid-July.We would bring our own boats. Most of us would fish smallies first and then walleyes second. Or is there some other location that you would reco for great smallie fishing in July. thanks."
533137,Guest,2003-07-02 07:14:00,0,"Noel, All the resorts in the Morson area are top notch. Smallies should be on the reefs by mid to late July so no matter where you go you are near great fishing spots. I'm not real familiar with the services Grassy and Tamarac provide but haven't heard any bad reports from either of them. The only thing I would say is that Tamarac is in a better location for chasing eyes and smallies (just my opinion). Good luck and hope to hear good reports."
533139,Noel,2003-07-02 07:41:00,115,"MTJ, thanks for your opinion. That's what I am looking for. I have been to Canada several times but never on LOTW in the Morson area, so I need some friendly opinions on the smallie fishing there. I had considered Rainy Lake but got many opinons that it is much more crowded then the Morson area."
533143,Guest,2003-07-02 10:07:00,0,I have stayed at both camps and will be at Grassy in a few weeks. Email me at [email protected] with your contact info and we can talk.
533144,Guest,2003-07-02 10:18:00,0,We stayed at Tamarack about 4 years ago and it was a real mess. I know they were working on it and it may be OK now but the cabins were very rough. We did stop by Grassy Narrows and to rate the two Grassy would be something like 8 and Tamarack a 1 on a scale of 1-10. Paul
