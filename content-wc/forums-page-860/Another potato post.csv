However, since I have talked with folks at an Import Service Centre, the Canadian concern is more about seed potatoes than potatoes destined for immediate consumption. However, there's no way anyone can have any assurance that potatoes (destined for eating) left over from a trip won't be discarded. The logic then follows that it's within the realm of possibility that such discarded potatoes could conceivably start to grow. Then any fungus, blight or bacterium (within the potatoes) has been transported to Canada. Therein lies the concern. That may seem far fetched to some but the law is the law. The fact that the law isn't applied equally by different border authorities shouldn't surprise anyone. There's a plethora of rules and regulations to know and apply. As well, please understand that these folks don't want to make anyone's entry into Canada an unpleasant hassle. They have jobs to perform - similar to the jobs performed by border authorities at the US side of the border."
532916,balsl6,2003-06-26 12:02:00,426,Does this law affect all of Canada or just certain Provinces? I have been through into manitoba but not Ontario? It seems odd that some get checked and others do not?
533014,Guest,2003-06-29 13:42:00,0,"After crossing from US into Manitoba (were not asked re: potatoes), we stopped in Winnipeg for some final groceries. Bought 30 lb of spuds. Guess what the sign on the counter said? ""Grown in U.S.A!"" Go figure!"
533016,retire55,2003-06-29 15:09:00,1029,"Bill: Not really all that surprising. US pototoes are imported into Canada on a regular basis . However, those potatoes imported into Canada must be accompanied by a certificate of origin as well as a USDA certificate of inspection. I'm told by the Canadian Import Service Centres that getting those certificates isn't worth the effort or cost for a visitor coming to Canada. So what's a fisherman to do - well buy your spuds in Canada. By the way, Canadians can not take spuds with them into the US either. If you would prefer to read the official policy directive, it's available at:http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/...6-05e.shtml#A6"
533018,Guest,2003-06-29 15:45:00,0,"Just returned. they didn't ask at the border, but my camp owner said it is true"
533104,Guest,2003-07-01 10:28:00,0,"Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap FRIGGIN PEOPLE. Why don't you cheapskates just buy your friggin potatos in Canada!!! And pleeeeeeeaaase...don't tell me you're not being cheap and that it's more convenient this way...cause if you do you will not only be cheap but a liar too."
533106,jzstiff,2003-07-01 11:07:00,188,"My guess would be that you are a Canadian potato farmer. It's not a matter of being cheap. For me, it's a matter of having everything bought and packed BEFORE I start my trip to Canada. And please don't tell me I'm cheap. Heck, I tipped the girls at my lodge $30 (American)everytime they did a load of wash for me. I'm quite an extravagant spender actually. But since I live in the land of freedom, I will choose when and where I do my buying. I will also abide by the rules of the land that I am visiting. With that being said, instead of being an anonymous (i.e. no guts to stand behind your comments) poster, have the conviction to register when you make your complaints."
533107,Guest,2003-07-01 11:47:00,0,"Please recommend a good potato store between Ashern and Ponton stocked with fresh, reasonably priced potatos. Then make sure you never ask anyone to bring you a carton of cheap Marlboros from across the boarder."
533116,ackermannsacre,2003-07-01 15:26:00,196,"Glad I'm going American Plan this trip so I don't get caught up in the Potato Conspiracy...Speaking of which, why is it only in Canda that I see reference to an American Plan, have never seen it in the US?"
532824,Guest,2003-06-24 21:56:00,0,Crossing at Fort Francis in 9 days. Is this ban on potatoes real or just another testosterone thing to rile people up. Has anyone crossed there recently and can you post your experience. Thanks Eric MacD
532825,Jesse-WI,2003-06-24 23:04:00,534,I am heading up their this Friday and my resort owner tells me it is real.
532829,wiggle,2003-06-25 04:54:00,400,I went across the border about 2 weeks ago. They didn't ask me if I had any potatos and I didn't tell them. There were a couple vehicles in our group and nobody was asked.
532855,balsl6,2003-06-25 13:15:00,426,"We went through customs @ Roseau last weekend and they never asked, I also did not see any potatoes around?? I have been throough customs twice and my parents have been through 4 times since the so called ban and have never been asked? Just keep them on top or seperate that way if they ask you have them ready they are inexpensive if you have to leave them. It is just a pain trying to find some more if you would have to. Hope this helps."
532859,Guest,2003-06-25 14:04:00,0,"Went up 2 weeks ago and yes, the potato ""scare"" is real... No potato's although I beleive you are allowed to bring processed potato's. Things like frozen hashbrowns, etc..."
532874,retire55,2003-06-25 17:51:00,1029,Eric: You can telephone toll-free (see below for the number) to verify that you can not (legally) bring potatoes into Canada. Central Import Service Centre (Ontario) 7:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m.(local time) Telephone and EDI: 1-800-835-4486 (inside Canada or U.S.) The web site that provides some information about what can be brought into Canada is:http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/.../importe.shtml
532883,Guest,2003-06-25 19:11:00,0,Got back Sat 6/21. Was stopped @ border>asked what the potatoes were for. told them for eating and that was ok. Stated that if I was intending to plant them that they would have to left @ the border. Got a chuckle... yea we all take baking potatoes to Canada to plant them for next years crop! Go figure.
532887,ackermannsacre,2003-06-25 21:52:00,196,"retire55, Again some great links. Nice to have ""official information"" rather than heresay from someone on the net that may or maynot have ever been to Canada. I for one appreciate your taking the time to research and track down the straight skinny for us."
532901,Jig A Lowe,2003-06-26 07:43:00,87,"I have taken the time to read some of that info. My read is that taking potatoes into Canada should be OK so long as they are USDA inspected and the quantity is reasonable, i.e. <250 kg. If my read is correct, that flies in the face of those who have had potatoes confiscated unless they did not meet the criteria above. It sounds like at some border crossings, they are simply forbidding potatoes regardless. Makes one wonder if that is really legal? After all, who in their right mind would make a ""federal"" case out of losing a bag of potatoes. Of course, the potato ban may be new and the web site just hasn't been updated."
532903,bigfish1965,2003-06-26 08:05:00,3210,"I've seen people go through things with US Customs that would scare you. When we were younger we had them dismantle the interior of our car. They left all the parts (seats, bolts etc) in the parking lot and told us we could go. When we asked for assistance to re-assemble the car, they said no and told us to leave before they changed their mind and kept us for another 2 hours. Our border guys are mild next to some of the US guys I've run in to."
