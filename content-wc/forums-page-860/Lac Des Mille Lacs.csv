533133,pfg1,2003-07-01 22:51:00,52,"####o, I am fishing out of The Thunderbird Resort on LDML from July 11-18, 2003. I fish the SW corner of LDML. Can someone please provide a fishing report? Bugs? Lake level still down 3FT from 2002? Thanks, David[email protected]"
533146,Guest,2003-07-02 10:32:00,0,"Lake is back up, we've had a lot of rain. Fishing has been good. Don't be afraid to move. Little guys can always be caught. Bugs are way down this year because of a dry spring. Good luck"
531264,Big D,2003-05-19 15:25:00,61,"Anybody have any advice as to fishing, crossing the border or buying leeches. We are heading up later this week. Do you know what the water levels are this year, are they low?Thanks for the help!"
531265,Wenty,2003-05-20 07:21:00,15,"Big D,Fished LDML last weekend. I'll be there this weekend as well. I assume you're crossing at Pigeon River. You shouldn't have any long delays there. As for leeches, I might suggest one of the bait shops in Kakebekka Falls. I like Larry's which is on your left, but others are probably fine too.LDML is low. I would estimate about 2.5 feet lower than last year. I saw rocks that I've never seen before.Fishing was okay this past weekend, but not great. I'm no expert, but I feel that large populations of walleye were in post-spon status. It will only get better."
531266,Guest,2003-05-20 10:43:00,0,"I will also be up this coming weekend, where do you guys usually fish out of? I will be at Lac De Mille Lac Lodge. Very nice resort!! Hope the fishing is good."
531267,TEK,2003-05-20 15:24:00,23,Mike let me know how the fishing was. I'm going up on the 14 of June staying at the same place.Say Hi to Steve for me Tom Kenefick
531268,Guest,2003-05-21 10:30:00,0,"Ok Tom, you bet I will. I will be back up there the week of June 20th till the 29th also, Can't wait."
531269,Big D,2003-05-21 11:25:00,61,We're staying at Thunderbird Lodge. Thanks for the info. I'll post a fishing report next week.
531270,Guest,2003-05-27 12:50:00,0,"Tom, fishing was good!! Had best luck at the end of the lake, and in the enterance to the seine river, as your coming from the lodge, just before the enterance of the seine, there is one small island and a large rock, on your right hand side going in, did good there also, we also tried down by owl island but pretty slow there still, majority of fish still at south end.Mike"
531271,Big D,2003-05-27 13:14:00,61,"We had some limited success last weekend. Be careful, the lake is very low. The weather was great and we had a good time. We got checked at the border for fish and were within our limits.Most fish we caught were on leeches and minnows or minnow baits. Try the Storm minnow baits in white or perch colored, these worked well for northerns."
532175,Guest,2003-06-11 10:01:00,0,"Anybody been up here lately? How's the water levels and are the BUGS out? How's the fishing been? Will be up June 20th till the 30th. Thanks, Mike ""keep it tight, fish on"""
532207,Guest,2003-06-11 20:18:00,0,Bugs are in full bloom. Mosquitos are as big as sparrows. Put rocks in your kids pockets so they don't get carried off.
