533123,Bob G2,2003-07-01 17:54:00,172,"Please let me know how you like LaBelles, and the fishing on Rainy Lake when you get back."
532844,blackjack,2003-06-25 10:01:00,72,Suggestions for hotels/restaurants to stop at along the way would be appreciated. I am planning on taking 2 days to travel this route. Any traffic delays and/or construction detours would be nice to know.
532850,whitetip1,2003-06-25 11:53:00,53,"BlackJack, What route you taking? There is construction on 35N just past Hinckley. It is only a mile or 2 and should not be a factor unless you come up on Friday evening. I've heard there is const. around Duluth also, not sure. Dave"
532857,downriverbob,2003-06-25 13:39:00,880,"I go to Lake of the Woods/Whitefish Bay every year from south of Detroit. Which way were planning on going I hope through the UP ? To navigate through Chicago, Milwaukee, and the Wisconsin Dells during the peak summer travel period is a nightmare. I leave early in the morning driving through the UP, Wisconsin, Minnesota a total 900 miles to International Falls and stay at the Holiday Inn, then cross the border the next morning. I usually go in July or August but I'm going up the first two weeks in September this year so hopefully the travel will be a little lighter this year. There is construction in Duluth on 35 but there were post earlier this year that stated that the traffic(detour) was not that bad. I usually take something to eat/drink for day one so I can eat when I want to, and stop when I want to. Last year we even went through the Soo and followed the north shore of Lake Superior and stayed in Thunder Bay and drove the rest of the way the next day. It was a beautiful drive but so much slower and 200 + miles longer."
532952,Bob G2,2003-06-27 07:22:00,172,"If you come across under Lake Michigan, the Borman Expressway (I80-94) is a traditional nightmare. If you can, hit it early morning on a weekend (to avoid rush hour weekday traffic) or later at night during a weekday. Also, maybe mid-day on a weekday, but that is no guarantee. I also would recommend staying on I-294 to skirt around the city instead of taking I-94 through it. I have also heard that there is a bad slowdown around the Wisconsin Dells area on I90-94. If that is the case, then avoid the Friday/Saturday afternoon rush. I would suggest checking the Illinois and Wisconsin Dept of Transportation websites for an update on construction zones. If you are looking for a good place to stay for a reasonable cost, I would highly recommend The White House Best Western in EauClaire. Spacious confortable rooms with queen sized beds and mini-fridges, indoor pool and hot tub to relax, and right there along US53. There used to be an awesome steak house next door, but it was closed up last year, too bad. Have a good trip."
532984,blackjack,2003-06-28 12:29:00,72,Thanks for the suggestions. I am planning on I 75 to S.S. Marie and then accross the U.P. of Michigan and eventually entering Canada around Fort Frances. Any suggestions on areas to avoid are greatly appreciated. I will check the websites but sometimes their information isn't very timely ( or practical ). Thanks
532990,Guest,2003-06-28 18:43:00,0,"Sounds like you are choosing the less stressful & scenic route. A good choice! I don't have that choice from northern IL. And I don't worry about towing a boat. Not that you do. Out of curiosity I looked at my Rand McNally map to see what the difference is between the two routes. Detroit to International Falls via Chicago was listed at 915 miles and 16:15 hours. Detroit to Int'l Falls via Soo was listed as 887 miles and 16:36 hours. If you wanted to make the trip in one long push I would probably recommend via Chicago. More stresssful yes and less scenic definitely. But you can make much better time ONLY IF you plan your trip to avoid Chicago rush that seems to start earlier and last longer every year. It is expressway driving all the way from Detroit to Duluth. Only stops are for tolls in IL (and IN if you take the toll road) and stops in Eau Claire. Don't worry about Milwaukee as you never go near it. I'm not the slowest guy on the road, but not the fastest either and I can make Int'l Falls from Janesville in a comfortable 8:45 hours. Detroit to Janesville 6 hours? Total drive time 14:45. The tough spot is getting around Chicago. On the occasional summer Monday morning when I commute from western Michigan I go through the city (Chicago) toward Milwaukee. To avoid slow downs - I go through downtown before 5:15AM. Traffic at that time but we are moving. Of course one accident and all bets are off. Have a great trip!"
532997,blackjack,2003-06-29 04:26:00,72,Thanks for your help guys. I'll be leaving Thursday around midnight which I hope will help me miss some of the worst weekend traffic. I am new to Walleye Central but it is nice to have so many new friends.
533001,Guest,2003-06-29 07:35:00,0,"Leaving Detroit at midnight, then no problem going via Chicago. You should sail right through on the 4 hour drive. Will take you through Chicago at 3AM. Can't think of a better time to pass through. I guess it boils down to your driving style. I'm sure either way will work great for you! ...Par"
533030,downriverbob,2003-06-30 06:14:00,880,"Blackjack, If you still plan on going through the UP, don't take I-75 to the Soo, as soon as you cross the Big Mac Bridge, take US-2 west then go US 77 north this will take you to US 28/41 west. Stay off US 2, it may look shorter but the traffic is alot heavier. US 28/41 will meet up with US 2 outside of Wakefield, Michigan. You will stay on US 2 through Wisconsin to Duluth, Minnesota. You will then want to go north on US 53 north. This is where there will be some construction. There were several posted message earlier this year that stated the detour on US 53 not being bad except on Friday afternoons. Every year I have gone up through northern Minnesota there has been some construction on US-53, so don't be surprised !!! US-53 will take you the rest of the way to International Falls. Enjoy your vacation."
533041,blackjack,2003-06-30 09:02:00,72,Thanks for the tip Down River Bob I'll give it a try.
