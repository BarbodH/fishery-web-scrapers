533203,Guest,2003-07-03 11:31:00,0,"My party fished out of the Fisheries the week of June 21 - 27. Water levels 4-5 foot low. Cool (52), windy and rain toward the end of the week. Caught many Northerns, but small hammer handles. Did get one 34"" and one 42"", both nice, but the exception. Did not get as many big eyes as last year. Largest was 22"". Smallies were scattered, but did finally find some up in Porters Inlett, 17 - 18"". The Pike are in the grass beds near camp, north of rail road bridge. Caught eyes also in grass. Smallies mainly on the points. Pattern totally different from last years floods. Good luck! Pathfinder"
