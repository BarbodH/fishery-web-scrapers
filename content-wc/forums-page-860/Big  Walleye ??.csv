533160,Guest,2003-07-02 13:46:00,0,"34""---10lb 10oz..????? must have been a skinny girl. Still a nice fish."
533183,Rich B,2003-07-02 20:46:00,1081,"My son caught the large walleye for our group - a 28 1/2"" golden beauty......I did catch the first one, though it was a 14"" (ha) ! I told my son at least he kept the ""big walleye"" for the week at the camp (www.campkuha.com) in the family ! Had a great week (our group booked 3 out of the 4 cabins) and after fish frys, steak frys and a few cold ones, I didn't want to go back to work ! The good vacations go by too fast, and work goes by tooooo slow !"
533189,Guest,2003-07-03 06:24:00,0,"Mine was a 29.5"", 11 pounder. Soaked her in milk and fried her up. Best darn walleye I ever tasted!"
533190,Guest,2003-07-03 07:51:00,0,"Dick is full of it, i was with his group and he never caught one over 15 inches. He was too busy drinking beer and wiping chew spit off his chin."
533192,Guest,2003-07-03 08:17:00,0,"Actually Dick did get a 29.5 inch 11 pounder, but as crosseyed and hammered as he was he did not realize it was a Carp and not a Walleye. This and the fact that he has caught very few Walleyes in his day, any fish he catches if it has any goldish hue at all he calls it a Walleye. He said it was the best fish he'd ever eaten."
533193,Mahumba,2003-07-03 08:18:00,345,I submitted one to the 10 pound club this year. I didn't take any measurements before I let her go so I couldn't tell ya what it weighed. Here's the picture.https://www.walleyecentral.com/fish_mahumba.shtml Roger Mayer.
533195,bigfish1965,2003-07-03 09:45:00,3210,"Dick did catch it...I saw him. What he doesn't say is that he caught it two years ago as a 21 incher and kept it penned feeding it steroids and little bits of musky meat to fatten it up. Then he tied up a perch as bait and re-caught the baby. He served it up with some Bald Eagle wings ( cooked Buffalo-style, of course). Yuuuummmmyyyy."
