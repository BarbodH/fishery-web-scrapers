Trolling with shad raps in 14-20 feet produced some nice fish (walleye, northern, musky) with blue and green being the hot colors. The weather started hot and calm but a cold front came in late in the week with gusty winds and rain. Walleyes were located off mid-lake reefs and along shoreline drops relating to structure but not very concentrated. Our group did limit out but it was a tough week, although any week fishing (especially in Canada) is great fun."

Our group had two less than great trips during that week in the past, one because of a major cold front and one due to mayflies. Were the mayflies a problem for you guys? We ultimately started going later in the year - 2nd week of July- to get past those two problems. Thanks for the report- what part of the lake were you on?"

Mayflies were not a problem but they were present in small quantities. Glad to hear from you. I am going to mount a serious comback in September though! Later - Devil55"
