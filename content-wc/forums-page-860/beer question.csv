When you declare 3 cases for 2 guys, (If he is satisfied with everything else) he then writes a ticket for the 1 case overage, and then you take that inside and pay for it. Once we were about 3 cars back and I jumped out of the car with the intention of going inside and paying for the overage ahead of time. A Customs man saw me and asked me what I was doing. I told him. He then told me to get back in the car and he would deal with us when our turn came. That's what I have done ever since, wait your turn. Scott"
533026,Guest,2003-06-30 00:25:00,0,"beer in wisconsin is $7-12 a case. your beerstore didn't post prices...just info. at least i didn't see prices. as for declaring prior to crossing. at international falls...there is a small place just before the border to do this. and, you don't have to be in line to do it. just go in...then get in car to cross. when you get to the border.....show the guard the tax you paid on overage...and no problems what so ever. i think on the last trip we took 5 or 6 cases extra and paid the tax...showed the guard the tax receipt.......and that was it. for the life of me i can't remember the amount of the tax BUT........the tax plus cost of beer bought in US was still cheaper than buying the beer in canada."
533032,retire55,2003-06-30 07:34:00,1029,"jka333: The Beer Store web site does show prices for all beers sold in Canada. They just don't make it easy to get at the price information. To get the information, one has to click on Stores and Products, then on Brands at the Beer Store, then on the submit button (without filling in the form) at the bottom of the page, then on the brand you want information for, and then finally on click here to see a price list for this product. The price information for Bud Light sold at The Beer Store is at:http://www.thebeerstore.ca/storesand...name=BUD+LIGHT 24 cans (355 ml) of Bud Light at The Beer Store cost $37.95 Cdn. 24 bottles (341 ml) cost $33.95. Your last post stated that beer in Wisconsin was $7-12 per case. Is the Wisconsin price for 24 cans or 24 bottles?"
533037,Guest,2003-06-30 08:13:00,0,"Gentlemen, Being a Chicagoan, I look forward to trekking to Canada if for no other reason but to consume a few cold Blue's. You see, the stuff that they import to the states is of inconsistant quality (One case will taste just like it does up there, one case will taste like crap). So, my question is does the Blue in International Falls typically have the same quality as the Blue in Ontario? Thanks everyone. -Crip"
533066,Guest,2003-06-30 15:16:00,0,"retire, thats the price for 12 bottles. thanks for the info. j"
533067,Guest,2003-06-30 15:24:00,0,I had already packed and was getting ready to move to Wis. When he said $7 a case.
533182,Guest,2003-07-02 20:32:00,0,"Stillwater is correct. Last week 2 of us imported (from duty free store) 3 cases of beer intp Canada, we paid duty on one case."
533187,Guest,2003-07-03 00:10:00,0,"You can cross into Canada with one case of beer OR one liter of alcohol. Always knew about the one case, however this year decided to take some Vodka along. Four guys 2 cases beer and two Jugs of Vodka, of course they were the ""texas Fifths"" and they are like 1.4 liters. So it cost an extra $20 for the duty. Should of just waited and bought the Banf Vodka which is great stuff.... SWeed"

532814,Guest,2003-06-24 17:53:00,0,Quebec is not like going to Canada. Bring as much booze as you want and then give the customs guy his choice of one of the bottles or beer. Thats the amount of duty.
532823,Guest,2003-06-24 21:41:00,0,"Just got back last weekend from Nungesser lake. One car had 5 cases per person. They got 1 duty free, paid duty on 4. The guards said that was the maximum they could pay duty on per person. By the way, they could care less about the potatoes."
532826,Guest,2003-06-24 23:17:00,0,we entered at international falls and declared excess booze just prior to going over. we paid minimal tax on the overage...and it wound up being less than the price of a case of beer bought in canada. always cheaper to declare extra than buy in canada. crossed over and bought a bottle or two more just so we wouldn't run dry...and felt the need to drop a few coin for the canucks.
532834,Guest,2003-06-25 06:44:00,0,What is the procedure for declaring excess booze and where do you pay? How much extra time does this take?

532842,Guest,2003-06-25 09:15:00,0,in international falls...thee was a store prior to the border where you go in and declare stuff. it took five minutes to tell them what we had....and paying the tax/duty or whatever they call it was a heck of a lot cheaper than not taking over a case of usa beer and buying a case of canadian beer.
532869,Guest,2003-06-25 16:40:00,0,"Checked several sites but found no specifics as to duty or taxes when taking extra refreshments across border. We will be crossing into Canada at the Peace Bridge from Buffalo, NY. Need specifics on where to declare any extras. There is a Duty Free store just before the border - is this where we declare or is it somewhere else? Do we tell the Customs agent at the border or what? Hoping to get some free info before I am forced to call some Canadian consulate about this question."

What does a typical case of beer cost in the US or can you provide a reference where one can find these prices? For instance, in Canada, there is The Beer Store at http://www.thebeerstore.ca/"

532735,Guest,2003-06-23 19:41:00,0,heading up next week to Quebec for fishing and I was wondering how much beer per person/vehical is allowed.
532736,jzstiff,2003-06-23 20:36:00,188,"I believe it's one case/person and one fifth of alcohol. After you get across the border, it's all you want."
532741,Guest,2003-06-23 21:20:00,0,One 24 can case of beer per person. For wine or booze it is 1.1 liters (37.2 oz.)per person. Duty free shops on the U.S. side do have 1.1 liter bottles for sale.
532749,McQ,2003-06-24 05:31:00,615,"Buffalo, once you get into Quebec you can pick up beer at most corner stores (depanneurs) - try the micro brewery stuff - Maudit & Hek are really good - where are you headed?"
