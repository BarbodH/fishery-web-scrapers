Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."
533181,retire55,2003-07-02 20:02:00,1029,"IA Dan: Go to http://www.thebeerstore.ca/storesandproducts/index.html Click on store locator, then type in Dryden and click on submit. There is only one Beer Store in Dryden at 79 Queen Street. Click on the address and you'll get hours of operation and a telephone number. You can even check to see if they have the brands you want. Go to http://www.city.dryden.on.ca/mapframe.html Click on Downtown Dryden for a map of the downtown area. Queen street is just under the brown line across the map (the train tracks). Alternatively, go to the web site for the LCBO (the liquor store) http://www.lcbo.com/stores_products/...rch/index.html Type in Dryden and click on find stores. There's an LCBO at 99 King Street North, DRYDEN"

Its a pain in the butt to try to plan a trip around the Beer Store hours. For the small difference, I'd much rather buy it up there, but until they get civilized and sell beer when people need it, we'll keep taking it with us. For the hours they're open, you'd think they were the post office."
533197,MTJ,2003-07-03 10:10:00,106,"How about this. If you want to buy beer in the states, buy beer in the states. If you want to buy beer in Canada, buy beer in Canada. Does it really matter? I do agree that as Americans we do tend to purchase most of our provisions prior to leaving for Canada. Maybe it's because we are just trying to be prepared for our trip, maybe it's because we are cheap. I don't think complaining about the Americans not spending enough money in Canada will do much good. On the other hand I don't think that as visitors to Canada's wonderful lakes and resorts we (Americans) have the right to complain about the prices they set. Sure it's nice to get a DEAL once in a while, but everyone must make a living."
533206,Guest,2003-07-03 13:13:00,0,"Well...LOL...if you are a cheap skate, I guess this all matters. When I want a beer, I buy a beer, and one for my buddies."
533208,Guest,2003-07-03 13:36:00,0,"Sorry BeerMAN you are just WRONG! The swill goes for much less than that or often comes in 30packs . Speaking of Swill,the worst beer I have tasted (other than Hamms) is CANADIAN made Budwieser! Whats the point?! What a mistake. Even made by Labatt ,so quite surprising.But I love Labatt Blue!! and would be willing to pay the extra cost over the border for it,because for some reason the Blue I buy at home, though excellent,just doesnt quite have that sweet taste the Blue has over the border. Probably the stuff I buy here just not quite as fresh."
533224,Guest,2003-07-04 14:07:00,0,"Also about your concern about the hours fo operation of some of the CDN beer stores , please keep in mind their employees need time off and like to get out and fish too :) And volume of customers is ussually such that they can't be open 24 hrs a day and besides if they ain't fishing on a sunday they may be at church praying for better fishing days :)"
533230,Guest,2003-07-04 23:23:00,0,That's the Ontario beer store that close down early. In Quebec you can by beer at the corner store. In Manitoba the beer (coolers too) vendor in found in all bars. Not sure about the other provinces.
533154,retire55,2003-07-02 12:50:00,1029,"First point - it doesn't matter to me where anyone buys their beer. Second point - several posters have stated that it is cheaper to buy all their beer in the US and pay Cdn duties/taxes on any cases of 24 over the one case of 24 per person legally permitted duty free. I telephoned a Canada Customs office today to verify the validity of that conclusion. Canada Customs provided the following information: Consider a case of 24 beer with say a US dollar value of $20 (jka333 posted $7-12 for 12 bottles). The Canadian duty/taxes on 24 bottles amounts to $14.42 Cdn or $10.30 US (using an exchange rate of 1.4). Consequently, any extra cases (any over 1 case per person) of 24 beer will in reality cost $20 + $10.30 = $30.30 US. As posted in an earlier thread, a case of 24 bottles of Blue Light cost $33.95 Cdn at The Beer Store. That converts to $24.25 US dollars at the exchange rate of 1.4. Conclusion: Bringing extra cases of beer into Canada costs $6 US more per case than if purchased in Canada. Reason for my post: Fact rather than supposition."
533156,Guest,2003-07-02 13:00:00,0,"Yah, and besides you can get some better beer in Canada than what you hauled up from the states. IMHO Many great Cdn beers to learn, eh? Fun to learn them, too!"
533158,Guest,2003-07-02 13:26:00,0,"I always figured beer was off budget anyway. Get the kind you like and pay whatever it costs. Anybody ever been to Kesagami Wilderness lodge. 50# weight limit and all beer is $3 U.S. per can, no matter how many you buy at once. The fishing is so good though. I have gone back 3 times. I just take a lot of money with me. Heck, a coke is $1.50."
533162,Guest,2003-07-02 14:08:00,0,"Hey Retire 55,,Your ""facts"" are flawed. Generally no one pays $20 dollars a case in the US. There are exceptions such as in Tennesee where the liqure taxes are very high. A typical case of domestic beer in Illinois Wisconsin,or Mn is $11.00-14.00. + sales tax. I usually pay with tax way less than 15.00 a case.But Lets call it on the highside at 15. add your $10.30 US for duty = 25.30 per case over whats allowed. The other problem with your info,is that When I was in Canada just last month,I did not see Labatt,or any brand that I was buying either at the beer store or the LCBO for 33.95 CA . We paid $39.00 CA anywhere we went for cases of Labatt and Budwieser.(made by Labatt there,which by the way didnt taste like either Labatt or Bud ). That converts to about 27.00 US . No doubt however the Canadian Labatt tastes GREAT!! Tastes better than the Labatt I buy in U.S. But just having been to Canada, our conclusion was ,if price is the issue,next time I would buy everything I needed in the U.S and pay the duty. DEFINITLY cheaper !! Cheaper yet,if can get the cases on sale at home."
533167,Guest,2003-07-02 15:07:00,0,"Hi Mark, The only beer that costs 11-14 dollars per case is the stuff we Canadians like to call swill. You know those great American brands like Hamm's, Milwaukee's Best, Schlitz, Old Mildew, Iroquois etc... You go ahead and enjoy your swill...I'll stick to the good stuff...even it is a couple of bucks more than your cheaper brands that would give ""raw sewage"" a run for the money."
533169,IaCraig,2003-07-02 15:25:00,434,"I ditto Sam's opinion, when on vacation, I buy my beer where it is convenient and I pay whatever it takes to get what I want. (besides 1 case a week is enough for me unless we get lots of rainy days) I have a theory that vacations are for enjoying myself, and my personal wealth is not going to grow substantially by pinching pennies to save maybe $50 each of those 2 weeks a year that I am on vacation. So, if you enjoy your vacation more by taking the time to shop around for the best deal on everything, go for it! Personally, I'll live on a tight budget the 50 weeks a year I am at home, but the 2 weeks a year I am on vacation I'll loosen the purse strings a bit in the name of convenience or more time on the water. IaCraig"
533170,snaggletooth,2003-07-02 15:31:00,135,"I agree with Sam & Beerman about beer being off the budget. We buy our beer at the border at the duty-free store. They sell the Canadian ""black-label"" beers there. (forgot the exact names, but they're made by LaBatt & Molson) They're a little more expensive, but yowsa, they're worth it !! One of those after a day fishing & before dinner at the lodge & I'm a-reelin !! (without any gear!!) We've looked all around for the black-label beers here in the USA & can't find 'em anywhere. Always load-up with 2 cases of black-label before we come home, too. Just another perk of visiting our fine neighbors to da nort, eh ?"
533173,Guest,2003-07-02 16:14:00,0,Lots of beers on sale now. Black Label is about $25 Can per case of 24. There are others as well. American beer is OK after all the other beer is gone and its three in the morning and you're not ready to turn in or if its free.
533174,Guest,2003-07-02 16:16:00,0,"In Red Lake, Labatt's Blue Light was $33.50C for 28 botles! We should know, we drank just a few!!"
533176,Vitreum,2003-07-02 17:36:00,221,"retire, never paid $20 for a case of beer in my life. usually $12-15 is the going rate in the usa. premiums are always on sale for that price range. suppose some states are higher though."
