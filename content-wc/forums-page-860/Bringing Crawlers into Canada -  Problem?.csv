532587,retire55,2003-06-20 06:23:00,1029,"phishfearme: No, unfortunately, I have no information on how accurate or how current the data is. Baitshops probably pay a fee to be listed and not all baitshops would opt to do that. I did notice that the site has a feedback page to ask questions."

532621,Newby,2003-06-20 16:46:00,148,"I buy worms in the states because I like my local bait shop, and I try to give them as much of my biz as possible. 1000 worms is alot to a small bait shop."
532623,Guest,2003-06-20 20:17:00,0,"You're right about buying in Canada. That's exactly what I do. But, I sometimes stay at Kettle Falls Hotel (water access only) along the Minnesota/Canadian border and fish in Canada. There is no Canadian establishment within many, many miles to buy bait from. You must bring your own bait."
532625,Guest,2003-06-20 20:33:00,0,"One more point. We have made an attempt to buy our bait in Canada. The year before we drove to Fort Francis, Ontario (100 miles out of our way), bought bait in Canada, got a receipt, and then went to our destination at Kettle Falls Hotel (which is in MN). The next day we fished in Canada and were told by an officer of the Canadian DNR that we were guilty of importing bait into Canada. We could travel by boat and get bait, but it's over 50 miles by water. And we'd have to do that every day, because we were lodging in MN. We asked if we could leave the bait in Canada for the night so we wouldn't be importing, but were told we'd then be fined for littering. I should add here that Kettle Falls is accessable only by boat. A 20-mile boat ride. And the hotel is only several hundred yards from the Canadian border. It's very remote. So, what are we suppose to do?"
532635,retire55,2003-06-21 08:27:00,1029,"Henry: My original comment was simply an observation from perusing this board for over 3 years. There was never any intent to throw dung at anyone. Of course there are legitimate reasons that can drive where one purchases bait or other supplies (e.g. who could blame Sam for saving $90 because his lodge owner wanted to gouge him on crawlers). As well, if quality of supply was at issue, I would bring my own too. Travel times can also drive such decisions."
533083,Guest,2003-06-30 20:35:00,0,"We had to walk our's back across the border and dump them. We had them in paper bedding, but there were specks of dirt on top that had come off the crawlers when they burrowed into the bedding. The customs guys said that they're trying to prevent viruses. We also had to dump our potatoes. Unbelievable!"

533140,Guest,2003-07-02 07:50:00,0,"Actually they are trying to prevent you NOT spending your money in Canada just like on Lake Erie where you cannot take lake shiners into Canada, but they can swim there and be sold by a Canadian bait store :-) I buy Canadian flats and they are packed in dirt and sent to the U.S. Guess their viruses are OK ..."
532511,Guest,2003-06-18 14:42:00,0,"$90 U.S. is a decent amount to save on worms. I still pay my $1200 plus whatever in beer to the lodge,$70 to the hotel, and however much to the gas stations, restruants, bars, etc on the way up. But for some reason $125 for worms just gets to me."
532513,Guest,2003-06-18 15:28:00,0,"To each his own is right, and for you to bash someone for 'saving money', makes you a complete jackass. Keep it to yourself next time.

Is this an item that is readily available or do I need to try and find the phone number of the bait shop and order them ahead of time. If I order them for a certain day, will they be there when I arrive to pick them up?"
532548,Guest,2003-06-19 06:27:00,0,"I am not sure where you are coming from, but we are coming from Wisconsin, and there is a bait shop that will sell a flat for $40.00 and leave them at a gas station for you if it is after hours. It is in Minong, WI.....just south of Deluth. Hope that helps. PS, you may want to call your local Gander Mountain or sports shop and see if they can recommend something for you....that is how I found my spot. >OK, now after all that, can someone recommend a bait shop >between Fort Francis and Red Lake that sells crawlers by the >flat or the 1/2 flat, or are they only sold by the dozen size >tubs?

Heading for Trout Lake near Red Lake for my first time and usually fish with plastics and cranks but Scar, a generous board member is sending me a marked map and gave me some tips on how he has rigged with crawlers up there for 12 years and just gotta try it out."
532452,retire55,2003-06-17 14:35:00,1029,"What: Firstly, my intent is not to ""stir the pot"". What I hoped for was a clarification from Trailerguy. I chose my words carefully. I did say ""seems to indicate"". Although Trailerguy did not explicitly say he was contravening Canadian laws, his words ""Most USA citzens are concerned about spending their time on the water not chasing around after beer, potatoes, leechs, ect."" inferred that USA citizens would bring such commodities with them. At least, that's how I interpreted his statement. The examples Trailerguy used (potatoes and leeches) cannot legally be brought into Canada by recreational fishermen. If I misinterpreted his statement, then all he has to do is clarify. No harm, no foul."
532485,Thumper,2003-06-18 07:55:00,133,"Careful when washing them in water. I had about 100 local worms I harvested to supplement the flat of worms I was buying. I did just what IAmWalleye1 said, using _tap_water_. My tap water containes fluoride (sp?) and chlorine (and who knows what else). Anyways, after washing my little pets about 20 of them wormies died. I'm assuming it was from the chemicals in the water. I later heard that you're supposed to use distilled or well water for worms. Live and learn. - Rick"
532486,Guest,2003-06-18 07:59:00,0,Where can you get this bedding from? I have seen people store their worms in shreaded newspaper. Will this suffice?
532489,Trailerguy,2003-06-18 08:32:00,1407,"[font face=""Arial"" color=green size=3][b]Retire 55, Yes, I do choose my timetable, as you obviously choose yours. Why would I (2 drivers)stop 3 hrs. from my destination for the night after traveling only 8 hrs. at that point? I'm guilty of CHOOSING to travel when traffic is light. Your response indicates your rationalization that you have all the time in the world. My experience tells me that a simple thing like stopping at the bank in Canada takes 45 minutes vs 5 minutes at a drive thru at home. Most Canadian businesses put no value on a person's time whatsoever. As far as Canada's import laws go, I personally choose to plan alternate methods, (I don't use leeches, as an example). I've never had a problem coming across the border, because I've always been open and honest, that's what gets you back on the road!"
532492,Guest,2003-06-18 09:10:00,0,"Worm bedding is readily available at stores that sell fishing equipment. I know Walmart carries it. It comes in a dry form and requires you to add nonchorinated water (I stop by a crick or river for it.) You add the amount called for and let it set for at least 24 hours. I put mine in a gallon ziplock bag with the water and put it into the refrigerator. I'll rotate the bag. I know the small two sided styrofoam worm box held together by elastic bands often come with a package of worm bedding. Once the bedding is prepared the box will hold 3 or 4 dozen worms for a short time. Be sure to keep the works cool. There are a number of different sized containers and bedding is also available by itself. As with many things the more preparation you do, the better the result."
532493,Guest,2003-06-18 09:35:00,0,I order it from Bass Pro Shops when I order the worms.
532501,Guest,2003-06-18 11:26:00,0,"Stopped at Cabelas for our flat of crawlers, other then waitng for an hour for them to get in we had no problems. Funny thing is that Cabales gets their crawlers from Canada, but still has too pack them in bedding. Caught a ton of fish on Lac Seul last week. Crawlers worked just as good or even better on somedays then minnows or leeches. Although all work very good on spinner behind bottom bouncer."
532506,Guest,2003-06-18 13:29:00,0,"Lets face it guys...the only reason for bringing in nightcrawlers is because some of you Yanks are way too friggin cheap for your own good.

532422,Guest,2003-06-17 08:24:00,0,"I know that crawlers must be in artifical bedding when transporting them into Canada, BUT---- a friend of mine just talked to someone that just got back from Canada via going up thru Duluth and he said that they went thru their entire crawler supply and would not let them take the crawlers in because they found a blade of grass and a twig in the bedding. I know the bedding must be clean but I can't believe that they are being that rigid. Anyone had any problems????????? Regards!"
532426,retire55,2003-06-17 09:28:00,1029,"I don't understand the apparent preoccupation with bringing everything from home (e.g. outboard motor gas, beer, crawlers, leeches (although illegal)). There are internet resources available to identify bait shops and their locations and hours of operation, beer stores and their hours of operation and gas prices by city/town. Another alternative for crawlers is to have your outfitter provide a flat of crawlers (500) on your arrival."
532427,iamwalleye1,2003-06-17 09:29:00,1589,Wash your Crawlers in water. Use Fat and sassy. If you give them any trouble they will find problems!
532429,Guest,2003-06-17 10:01:00,0,I do buy almost everything there. But the lodge I go to charges $3 a dozen. Cabelas and Bass Pro charge $35 for 500. I'm not a cheap skate. But saving around $90 is not bad.

532440,Guest,2003-06-17 12:49:00,0,It's legal to bring the nightcrawlers. We just put them in the non organic bedding instead of the dirt.
