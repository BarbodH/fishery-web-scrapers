533060,Guest,2003-06-30 14:12:00,0,Here is a map of the lake. If you click on each dot you will get that section. http://www.pineportage.com/fif/kb-maps.html I have been there twice. Both times the middle to end of July. I've had my best luck fishing rocks with deep water close or weed edges. I haven't tried Whitefish bay. But I definatly will this year.
533080,jzstiff,2003-06-30 19:59:00,188,"You're probably aware of the Oba River, although I've never fished it later in the year. It's always packed to the gills during the week that I'm there, so I only go there once during the trip. You might want to try trolling around the Agamik Islands during that time as the water gets deeper and lots of rocks around there. Picked up a 25"" there this year. Boot Bay is always a good producer of large Northern. Saw 3 40"" get pulled from there by the same group. The gold mine has been pretty productive for northerns as well. Good luck, and let me know how ya did."
533111,Guest,2003-07-01 13:19:00,0,"jzstiff I do have a map of the lake. Found Whitefish Bay. We mostly fished north of that, generally in the north east arm of the lake. Any other decent spots you could give me would be appreciated. I know about the oba river but we never fished there. Do you go into the river or just near the mouth? Also know about Boot Bay but didn't get that far west. Where is Eversons located. Is the fishing better in that direction? Thanks for any info. Ross"
533113,Guest,2003-07-01 13:59:00,0,"I've done real well in Davey's Bay, around Elmers Island and Blueberry Island. I will be up there from the 20th of July thru the 27th. When are you going?"
533119,Guest,2003-07-01 16:33:00,0,Sam We will be there August 4 thru 8. Usually eat shore lunch on Elmer's at least twice. Found Davey's Bay on the map. Will give it a try. Do you usually jig and minnow or something else. Will take any tips as this is just our 2nd time there. Really had a great time there last year. We jigged pretty much all the time. Chartreuse with minnow was the best. Thanks
533129,jzstiff,2003-07-01 19:29:00,188,"When we fish there, the Oba River itself is a fish sanctuary, which is why there are always 15 boats parked just at the mouth of the river. SOme just sit there all day. I've never understood going up to Canada for a week and only fishing one spot when you have a lake that has more shoreline than Lake ST. Clair, but to each his own. Everson's lodge is just south of Windy point, which is southwest of Whitefish Bay. Usually when I go, I spend most of my days trolling the shoreline in 8-12' of water until I hit a hot spot and I'll stop and jig it for awhile. I usually troll with a crawler harness with two hooks and use a minnow as bait. Fish around 1-2 mph and utilize my depthfinder quite a bit to keep me in the target depth. I also use a GPS to map any hotspots so I can go back. There is a point not sure of the name of it) that is just north of Kaby Lodge (big rock, can't miss it) that always produces. About 12-15' of water and lots of rocks. Took 2 guys with me there this year for 3 hrs one night and we caught over 100 jigging from the rock. Also had a buddy catch an 18# northern there on 4lb test, ultralight rod and no leader. That was an adventure. Schist Bay and Alligator Alley are supposed to be pretty productive as well, but I've not fished them yet. Will definitely hit there next year. Let me know where you have good luck so I can add it to my list of places to go. Have you ever thought about Everson's? I know the lodges you go to are nice, but $670 for a week is a pretty good price if you don't mind cooking for yourself. When we go, we have fish just about every night with the exception of steak night and pasta night (the last night). We don't just do fried fish either. We have a fish boil, Walleye Cheesy Bake, and other delicacies. That extra money we save sure does buy a lot of extra liquor which always goes down smooth at the end of a day."
533141,Guest,2003-07-02 08:25:00,0,We mostly fish jigs tipped with half a crawler. We always take a guide one day while there. Each time they bring minnows. But I don't see where they do any better than the crawlers and are more trouble. In Davys bay we fish the weed edges or the rock pile at the mouth of the bay. Around Blueberry Island there are weeds and a shoal just south east of the Island that has always had fish. When I want to find new spots I usually troll Hot-N-Tots along the shore line and around Islands until I find them and then drift or back troll with the Jig heads tipped with the worm.
532966,Guest,2003-06-27 12:50:00,0,Does anyone know if the fire ban in western Ontario goes that far east. I am going up in three weeks and am taking 4 new to Fly-in's. I would hate for them to miss out on the shore lunch.
533010,jzstiff,2003-06-29 13:21:00,188,"Sam, I am familiar with the lake, but do not know the answer to your question. I'm bumping this to the top so that someone may be able to help you. Maybe you should give the camp a call. Which cabins are you staying in? If going to Everson's, I can get you his number."
533035,Guest,2003-06-30 08:03:00,0,We stay at Pine Portage. When I called to pay the final bill a couple weeks ago there was no ban. But the lady said they were worried it was about to happen. I'll give her a call. I just thought maybe someone here knew the answer.
533036,jzstiff,2003-06-30 08:11:00,188,"Good luck to you Sam. I really love that lake and hope you have a great time. I released a 10 pounder when I was there in the second week of the season. Sure put up a good fight, perhaps you'll get a shot at her."
533045,Guest,2003-06-30 10:40:00,0,"I've been there twice before. We haven't caught one that big. The biggest was 27"". I'm not sure what that would weigh. We have caught 3 pike over 40""."
533046,jzstiff,2003-06-30 11:06:00,188,"One that big (without knowing the girth) could have gone somewhere around 6 lbs. I saw a 48"" northern caught there this year that was also released. Haven't caught one over 40"" yet although I never target them. WOuld be nice to get into one that big tho. Where do you do most of your fishing while there? Do you ever go down by Everson's? There's some pretty decent fishing down that way."
533050,Guest,2003-06-30 12:07:00,0,I usually fish the west islands and bays in the middle portion of the lake. I have been south past Eversons lodge once or twice. It's a long ride from the north end of the lake though.
533053,Guest,2003-06-30 12:49:00,0,"How far from Pine Portage is Eversons. Going there in August for the second time but never got as far as Eversons. One of the guides told me he thought the fishing was better ( and larger fish ) down that way and down by Kaby lodge. Have you guys been going there long? Any tips would be appreciated. Last year we caught lots of walleye, but not much size. 24"" was the biggest. Fished mostly within 30 minutes of Pine Portage. Thanks"
533057,jzstiff,2003-06-30 13:53:00,188,"Do you have a map of the lake? If not, let me know and I'll e-mail you one. Would be more than happy to tell ya all I know. I've been going for thre years now and one of the guys I go with has been going for over 30 years, so I know quite a bit and would be more than happy to tell ya anything ya need to know."
533058,jzstiff,2003-06-30 13:54:00,188,I've always done well and have usually caught at least one 5 pounder every year around Whitefish Bay.
