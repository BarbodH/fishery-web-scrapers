533090,Guest,2003-07-01 05:19:00,0,"Canada Wins... I just got back from a fantastic week of fishing. We have been to canada fishing before and have had to learn the hard way. Drive in lodges are not the way to go if you are looking to catch lots of fish. When I say lots... I mean more than 100 fish per day, and that is not an exageration. We did a remote fly-In with C.W.O.(you figure it out). Great prices, great cabin, boats were awesome, and the meals were plentifull. I have already booked for 2005, and can't wait to go again. This was going to be our last trip, or our best trip to canada. These guys really know how to run a business. They were even kind enough to pick up our beer and have it at the cabin so that we would not have a weight problem. We are a small group of middle age guys who all need the fishing drug. We currently have two open spots to fill our party of eight. If you happen to read this and you are interested in fishing with us, please respond...sorry no women, wives wont let that happen. Only reply if you know how to pitch in and help, drink lots of booze and know how to have a good time. Thanks Canada....High Rock all the way!"
533117,ackermannsacre,2003-07-01 16:03:00,196,"Ok Preppier, How about another clue. I just spent an hour Googling and can't find redwomanriver.com, C.W.O. or Doug Gawley. Already have a flyin lined up for next week to Trout Lake, but always looking for possible new water for next year???"
533120,Guest,2003-07-01 17:39:00,0,"Found your answer at ontariosunsetcountry.com,try northwinds canadian outfitters.HAPPY HUNTING !!!"
533121,ackermannsacre,2003-07-01 17:46:00,196,"Thanks eman, But I don't think that is the one preppier was referring to, on another thread he stated that he flew out of Ft Francis?"
533122,Guest,2003-07-01 17:49:00,0,"sorry,try gawley's little beaver lodge and outposts,run by doug gawley."
533124,Guest,2003-07-01 17:57:00,0,"Bill just looked at web site they have outpost at woman river, this should be the correct site."
533132,ackermannsacre,2003-07-01 20:32:00,196,"E-man, Could be, but he did say they flew out of Ft Francis. I think those ones fly out of Vermillion Bay. He also said something about the exception meals, making me think he was at a American Plan flyin lodge and not an outpost. We will just have to see how long he can keep this a secret...LOL"
533135,IaDave,2003-07-02 06:36:00,476,There is a Canadian Wilderness Outfitters in Fort Frances. I couldn't find a web site but I did get a phone #. Check Yahoo yellow pages for Fort Frances.
533159,Guest,2003-07-02 13:28:00,0,I was wrong. It is womanriver.com
533161,Guest,2003-07-02 13:46:00,0,"Ok you guys.... I just got back from the outpost trip. Private cabin on a private lake with an outfitter out of Ft. Frances. He is at the airport...(last clue). We had all of our food provided by the outfitter but we had to cook it. We had steaks, pork chops, hamburgers, European sausage, and Chicken. We ate fish for lunch everyday. He provides all the dry goods,(not snacks) all the canned veggies and beans. Pleanty of potatos and onions for the feast as well. We have a group of eight hungry guys, and without a doubt they overstock by about 20%. This was not an american plan. We had all the boat gas provided with unlimited resources on the island. The cabin had millitary style bunk beds, 2 in each room. Hot and cold running water (out of the lake) but safe enough that I did drink it, and never got the ####s. He is about 100% booked and you can only book one year in advance. Like I said once you get in you can always come back. We are booked to return in 2005 with this outfitter again. Now about Doug Gawley... He was the outfitter that did the day trip out of Ear Falls when we stayed at Manotok Lodge on Perault lake, which is near Lac Suel. I beleive he was redwomanriver.com and is at womanriver.com, but that sight doesnt give much info. I read another posting that said you can find him at little beaver lodge? Enough Said Preppier"
