533209,im_mike,2003-07-03 14:47:00,1,Barney's..I like it so well i'm going to eat two breakfasts in August
533092,Guest,2003-07-01 06:28:00,0,"OK, I'm leaving Thursday will be arriving in International Falls early Friday morning. I need the name and directions of the best breakfast place in town. Sorry for the short notice. Hope you can help me out."
533093,troutaholic,2003-07-01 07:13:00,827,"I do believe it is called the Chocolate Moose. It is on the right-hand side of the highway as you come into town. It appears to be a converted Country Kitchen, but the food was good last year!!!"
533094,Guest,2003-07-01 07:21:00,0,"Yep, I second the ""Moose!"""
533098,Reels,2003-07-01 08:31:00,2876,Sally's! Small little dive run by mom and daughter. Great food!! Main drag on the west side of the street. <{{}}><
533105,Guest,2003-07-01 10:42:00,0,I've been there at least 10 times and the best breakfast i've found is Barney's anyone can tell you how to get there just a couple of minutes west of the border crossing
533109,Guest,2003-07-01 12:45:00,0,"We always eat at the Shorelunch Cafe. About the middle of town on the highway next to the Tee Pee motel. Good food, friendly service."
533118,iamwalleye1,2003-07-01 16:25:00,1589,Reels Please don't spread the word about Sandy's. You can never get in. Try the pancakes if you go. Great people and very good food! Also if you have a boat put it in the VFW lot and work next door. Big lot with plenty of parking.
533130,BD,2003-07-01 19:29:00,739,Barney's is the best! The Moose has changed hands many times. I don't know if it's any good now but it was bad in the past. Allways seemed like each new set of owners started up decent but then let the quality slide. Sally's is very good but can't handle a large group. If you go west from the Fort the resturant at the Emo Inn is a great place to eat. You can cross the border early and catch breakfast a short time later.
533131,Reels,2003-07-01 19:38:00,2876,IAWALLEYE1- thats why I said sally's... create a diversion... <{{}}><
533164,cough6609,2003-07-02 14:24:00,48,"CHOCOLATE MOOSE! We came back from the DRYDEN area and stopped there. Lot's of seating, great service from nice looking young ladies and a lot of food for the money. Enjoy...wish I was going back up! CoughIowa"
