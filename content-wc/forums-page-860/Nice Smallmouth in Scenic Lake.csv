533201,FishTwentyFourSeven,2003-07-03 11:23:00,38,I know this is a far shot but has anyone fished Scenic Lake north of Kenora? I think it is fly-in only. The lodge owner tells us that the Smallmouth fishing is outstanding but wanted to get some unbiased opinions. Any info. will be greatly appreciated. Just a clue on size and numbers. Thank you in advance and good luck on the water this summer. Jerry
