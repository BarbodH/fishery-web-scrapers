516981,Indiana Lou,2002-02-05 19:56:00,194,I haven't been to Lake Moira for fifteen years. I was wondering how the fishing has been and is there still a health advisory posted for the walleye and bass. The problem was arsenic coming from gold mines along the Moira River. Any info would be appreciated. ThanksIf there is a problem any suggestions for lakes similar to Moira would be good.

Yes I think the advisory on fish consumption is still in effect ."
516983,Indiana Lou,2002-02-13 17:56:00,194,Thanks for the reply. We were very successful back in the 80's for walleye and smallmouth bass. We fished out of Jim Pitt's camp ground.We usually fished in mid-June to early July. Never any monsters but enough to keep us fed all week.Once again thanks for the reply
