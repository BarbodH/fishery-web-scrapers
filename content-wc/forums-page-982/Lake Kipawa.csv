517052,retire55,2002-02-10 09:49:00,1029,"ESR57:Our group of fishing enthusiasts fished Lake Kipawa the first week of Jul last summer. We stayed at 3 Season's Camp. The fellows that run 3 Season's Camp and Taggart Bay Lodge are brothers. Taggart Bay Lodge is at Deep Bay and that is where we are picked up and then ferried to our camp.If you do a search for Lake Kipawa here on walleyecentral.com, you'll get a number of hits. Some of those discuss staying at Taggart Bay Lodge (e.g. Kip).Lake Kipawa is scenic and affords opportunities to fish in almost all weather conditions. The average walleye caught will weigh between 1.5 and 2 pounds. However, almost every group catches walleyes bigger than that. You can try your fishing prowess for Lake Trout too.Probably the most reassuring thing I can say about Lake Kipawa and the fishing there, our group is returning this summer 6-13 Jul 02. Jay"
