I really like to fish walleye and currently do it with a friend that has property on the Mississaugi river @ Rydall Bank. Also, what would be the best time for fishing there. Our fishing trips now are @ the end of May and in Aug. By the way, I have no idea where Lac Suel is Thanks a bunch, Steve"
517183,Jigger1,2002-02-13 16:39:00,234,"Steve,Lac Seul is located approximately 150 miles N-NE of International Falls. Depending on what part your fishing, it could be more or less. It's the second largest body of water in Ontario with nearly 3,000 miles of shoreline and a surface area over 500 square miles. It's a walleye producing machine and is known as a trophy lake. We fish out of Silver Water Wheel Lodge which is located in the central part of the lake. I don't know if there is a bad time to fish Lac Seul it's just a matter of where to fish at a particular time. We fish late June/early July and typically spend the majority of time in 8 to 20 feet of water. This might not be a ton to some, but in the last two years (8.5 days of fishing) I've personally caught 23 walleyes over 24"" with the largest topping out at 29"". I'm hooked and plan on going back for years!"

Fishing is great throughout the season, just put the big ones back so it will stay that way!!"
517185,Guest,2002-02-14 09:44:00,0,You might take a look at Ojibway Outfitters. If you call 1-800-567-4775 they will mail you a brochure. We fish there the first part of June and August. Early fishing gets you huge numbers 50-100 a boat a day and August fishing seems to get you bigger fish. Either way it is a great place to go. It is about a 40 mile boat trip back into the resort. They will guide you in and haul your gear. Once your there they have all the amenities. Good Luck
517186,Guest,2002-02-14 11:05:00,0,I have to agree with 2DOGS. Been going to this lake for 30 years. Since they have put the slot into effect the fishing is terrific. I've gone to Goldpines.
517187,Guest,2002-02-15 11:39:00,0,"If you have never been to Lac Suel, Ojibway Outfitters out of Souix Lookout would be a good choice. You have to boat in to the cabins and they are literally right next to the fish. We've done well right off the dock. Their staff will give you all the info you need to get started. I've been there 4 times during August and have had excellent fishing and fairly nice weather. On the Ear Falls side of the lake there is a lot of big water. In May you will find the fish near the spawning areas and there will be other boats in the area. Sometimes there can be a crowd. Fishing is always good, but the weather can be a challenge. Look for cold, rain, sleet, wind, more wind, etc. The weather gennerally clears up for an afternoon at least once during the week. Actually the weather might not be that bad, but it sure seems like it. In August the Ear Falls area is less crowded because the fish are not concentrated. But, you will find plenty of walleyes and northerns to keep you busy. I've stayed at Goose Bay, Golden Fawn, Fishermans' Cove and Evergreen. Any of these resorts are good choices. Fisherman's Cove is down the lake appoximately 15 miles. Give Lac Suel a try. TGG"
