517105,Guest,2002-02-12 08:05:00,0,"I have a Cabin in Nestor Falls and have been to both resorts, if you want to stay at a place that is back in a bay off the main channel, full of weeds, they have trout, northern but have to travel for walleye stay at Whitefish Bay,Duck Bay, is on an island, Dave and Sherri are the best guest you could ask for, more variety close to the island you never really have to travel far by boat. Your boat is meet whe you come into the dock, your fish are cleaned for you and put in the freezer for you and everything else you could think of is done before you even ask."

517108,Guest,2002-02-14 06:42:00,0,I've gone on record on another thread about LOTW before. Sabaskong Bay and Duck Bay are a good option for anyone wanting fishing for a number of species in close proximity to the lodge. The facilities and equipment are great and the owners make it real easy to have a good trip.
517106,fishinnut,2002-02-15 10:08:00,642,I've never been to Duck Bay but I did stay at Whitefish Bay. How anyone can say it's in a bay full of weeds is wrong. It's on an island in one of the deepest parts of LOTW. Caught some nice walleyes nearby and saw a 10 lb brought in. Lake trout were deep and will be when you go but they can be caught. Pick up some snap weights and 6-8 oz. weights. Troll with blu/silver rapalas and bounce bottom in about 80 fft of water. Bob will point you in the right direction.
