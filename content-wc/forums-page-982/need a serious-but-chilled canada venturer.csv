517156,Guest,2002-02-11 22:54:00,0,"I'm sorry walleyechieftain but I think I finally snapped. Afterresponding to your post I had to go back and re-read the whole DUIpost and I see most everything I read that you posted I agreee with.I think the biggest problem with the border crossing is due to the fact that up north they have a communist government making the decisions up there, and until they get it straightened out theyjust may lose out on quite a bit of buisnesss. I love Canadabut I disagree with their Governments point of view on most things."
517157,Guest,2002-02-11 23:29:00,0,"Walleyechieftain You won't belive this but I just read the whole DUIpost again and I ask, please accept my sincere apology. I said Communist but to be fair Socialist may be more accurate. The viewpoints of Canadian Guy just shows me they have support for theirideals and they are doomed to just rot up there without our dollars.If you decide a Canada trip is not in our best interest please letme know, we have a lot of options here in the good old U.S.A[email protected]"

I would also suggest that we will not rot up here either !!because everything stays fresh with our cold climate !!!! jake"
