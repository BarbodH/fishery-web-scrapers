Canadians are great people and I count among them some of my best friends, both in fishing and in healthcare.Both populations are exasperated with the culture of the other country at times, no doubt, but we all get along individually as we should. I'm fortunate in that I average two trips a year to Canada, my favorite trips anywhere. I've caught sturgeon, walleye (pickerel), northern pike, been amused at the piles of roadside rocks, disturbed by the graffiti on natural rock formations, been ""stuck"" in a bog, and dined in your most beautiful restaraunts in Vancouver. What a country!I would point out though that travel is not a one-way street. It is virtually impossible to go to Florida, Vegas, Palm Springs, San Francisco, Minneapolis, Buffalo, Seattle, border towns, etc without running into Canadians. In my line of business (healthcare) we also see a fair amount of Canadians accessing our healthcare in an extreme time of need.Welcome to our country, we appreciate you. For that .0000001% of Canada residents who resent us camoflage wearing ""you alls"", nothing will ever change your mind, but you're welcome too and I hope you accrue a lot of US travel points with your retail purchases.Now if I could just get a good bottle of table vinegar and local pearl shad rap outlet...Todd_NE"

Must be something here they like?The good folks in Canada come down here for goods and we head the other way, appears to be a good working arrangement to me.Todd I will be sure to get some vinegar for you just in case you pop in on your voyage this season. The pearl Shad Raps, well I horde them too. Backwater Eddy ~ ~ ~><sUMo> ~ ><>http://msnhomepages.talkcity.com/Res...wtr1/home.html"

516987,River_eye,2002-02-06 19:25:00,1486,"There are various reasons.The main one used to be shopping. You guys have some stuff that we don't have here. But not so much anymore because our dollar doesn't go very far down there anymore.The other main one is that Canadians love to travel, take in sights, culture, and you guys are so close, why not start there.You will also find lots of canadians all over the world, europe, austrailia and asia mostly and to a lesser extent latin america and africa. We are truly a multicultural country, where people and customs from all over the world are embraced and explored. Talk to any any young person here, chances are they've been overseas or at least planning to in the future"
516988,Dave S,2002-02-06 23:30:00,314,"Todd, Some of my best friends are from Canada. I see hundreds of camper trailers going south every Fall / early winter heading for southern destinations in the United States to soak up the sun while the snow piles up back home. Canada is wonderful place to visit in the summer with many Canadians enjoying the best of both worlds by ""Migrating North and South Following the Geese""."
516989,stewart,2002-02-07 08:43:00,100,"I'm in southern Quebec, and to get to the good fishing requires a considerable ride north.So for me it's actually much closer to do some fishing in Vermont when I have time for a trip. Nice little trout streams and ponds. Most times I'll end up with more fish than buddies who pay to fish at small outfitters in Quebec."
516990,chrism,2002-02-07 10:58:00,429,All of the above (never tried pearl Shad Raps though) and Seafoam!
516991,River_eye,2002-02-07 13:05:00,1486,"Chris, what about that shadrap that we found floating at pine falls this fall. That kinda looked like a pearl colour didn't it?"
516992,Guest,2002-02-11 00:14:00,0,"So we can load up on camo gear, drink cheap adult beverages, listen to how y'all talk funny & tell stories about how big our fish are / and how great Teasers can be in the fall............ ;-}"
