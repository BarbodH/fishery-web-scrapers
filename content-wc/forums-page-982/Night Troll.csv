For the last few years however, my partner and I have had some pretty good success trolling shad raps over deep water (50-60') in our favorite walleye lake in Ontario...but this technique only seems to produce for a 1 hour period of time, just before and just after it gets dark. We have tried sticking it out till later in the night ( a couple of hours after dark) over the same deeper water,and also have tried doing the same troll over structure and over shallow water with virtually no sucess during that same 1 hour window of opportunity. I've read some reports here in the past that seem to say that there are some guys out there who troll all night for 'eyes with good sucess. My question: Is there usually more than one ""bite"" during the course of the night? When does that tend to be? Of course, we're at it with the harnesses at daybreak...any suggestions as another time frame to night troll would be greatly appreciated!"
517180,BD,2002-02-13 11:40:00,739,There is more than the dusk and dawn bite. I've found the Solunar tables to be a good guide to the best fishing times. I like trolling the shallows / reefs during the full moon best. Maybe because I caught my biggest eye (13 3/4) at 11:00 pm under a full moon on Bago.
517181,Guest,2002-02-13 19:56:00,0,"Have had similar experience. The water we fish (Ontario) is classic combination walleye and lake trout. Lot of deep water, very clear and a cisco forage base. As I understand it, just before dark the plankton in the lake rise from deep water to the surface drawing with it the cisco which are followed by the walleye, actively feeding. Shortly after dark the plankton drop back down along with the everything else, thus the short window of activity. I could be wrong but I don't think it reoccurs during the night. For that magic hour or so the chance for a trophy at the top is great. I believe these are walleye that spend most of their time in deep water. We have been doing this for the last 3-4 years trying to figure it out. We don't catch many, just enough to keep us at it most evenings (hard to pull out of a great shallow water jig bite to experiment.) Have caught walleye up to 8lb and last year even caught a 10# northern over 90' water down maybe 10'. Have not tried boards yet, might help given water clarity. We will keep working it for the trophy potential. Any help on your presentation strategy would be appreciated. We just troll long line with shad raps, rapala, etc."
