517080,Mich_Fisherman,2002-02-10 17:20:00,292,I was told that it is a law in Ontario that PFD's must be worn while on the water. Is this true? Thanks

517082,Guest,2002-02-11 15:19:00,0,yeah i heard that too.. a couple of years back. i bought a belly pack for about $70. worth it. regardless of the regs. it's a cartridge thing. never wear it but it stays in the boat. funny thing is is that the mountie wont see you wearing a vest and investigate why you dont have one.... and bother you anyway....still....as a one time buy...buy it
517084,Guest,2002-02-11 18:22:00,0,Good idea to wear all the time but not true unless you are on a PWC. You just need to have them in the boat.
517083,Guest,2002-02-13 16:29:00,0,The cartridge type PFD must be on the person it can not be laying in the boat unless you have enough of the vest type PFD's fpr everyone.
