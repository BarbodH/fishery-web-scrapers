Unhappily, there are two problems for me-1.He has a minimum of six people. I do not have that many guys going. In fact, now it is my son and myself. 2. He offers five day trips and we want to go for a whole week. This may be the only time we do this and want as much time as possible on the water. After I talked to him there was no reason for me to follow up any further. I appreciate your recommendation. We are probably going to go with Ogoki Frontiers since they do allow two guys to go."

517163,Guest,2002-02-12 21:59:00,0,"Sorry Tom,didn't mean to jump down the old throat ! but reading what I wrote, I guess I did. sorry.There have been a couple times where I haven't been able to put together a group of 6 to go myself - it's tough (very tough). Jack does have some camps that 4 can go to and I have been to at least one of them and did fantastic. I am going for 6 days this year and have done 5's and 7's also just have to work it out.Last year was a bad year for my group (could only round up 4) and I considered two other options -Costa Rica in the winter and Waynorth lodge in the spring/summer.I don't know where you are coming from but if you are considering Armstrong, I will guess you are coming from Michigan. To get to Waynorth you would have a long ways to drive, beyond Armstrong, but there is another lodge up in the Nakina area called Liddle's that is darn good from what I hear - top notch service and good fishing.If you can swing the drive, or fly to Red Lake, Waynorth has two lakes that are VERY VERY good and worth the travel and Bob is VERY flexible on flight plans, days, meals (or not) etc.good luck,steve"
