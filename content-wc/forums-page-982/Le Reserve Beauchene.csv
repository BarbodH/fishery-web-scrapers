I would like to take the family to Beauchene. I have read alot about it, but haven't talked to anyone who actually has been there. I was thinking about mid-July to early August. I know that the smallies are probably out of the shallows by then, but are the legendary bruisers still available? How are their walleyes, as they don't seem to get alot of press? Pike? Also, is there good beaches there for kids? Thanks."

516816,Wallhanger,2002-02-13 06:57:00,17,"We went there three years ago. Camped at their beach facility rather than staying at their lodge. The lodge was a little on the expensive side, but you still pay for the fishing the lakes even when you camp. Went the 3rd week in June. The walleye fishing was ok. Took some nice size fish up to 6#, but no real quantity or consistency. Caught smallmouth up to 4#, but again it was pretty slow. Caught a fair number of lake trout up to 7#. Tried for brook trout with zero success.Friends of mine had been there on a couple of trips about 5 years before we went (they went in August). They had an excellent time with smallmouth and lakers, but limited success with walleyes. I was a little disappointed with the quality of fishing based upon my expectations. It might have just been a slow week.Keep in mind there a lot of additional lakes to fish, but you have to pay extra for fishing them. Also these lakes seem to book up early (limited number of people allowed to fish them per day). In fact one or two lakes had already been reserved before we got there. If you're not staying at the lodge the amount of fishing information you can glean from others is limited. If I remember correctly they had a nice beach at the camp, but the water was cold. Definitely worth at least one trip to check it out for yourself.Jim"
516817,Homer,2002-02-13 09:51:00,1127,"Similar story. I've been to the beach facility twice, once in spring and once in summer. Both times, though, we've targeted smallmouths and caught a lot of incidental lakers and the occasional northern. Weather permitting, the smallie fishing can be phemomenal, but cold fronts can sure slow the fishing down. I've had friends that have gone out there specifically for walleyes and they've done OK, but not spectacular.It's been several years since my last trip, but heed this piece of advice if you stay at the campground: Control your adrenaline and drive slow on the way in! I beat the heck out of my trailer my first trip going too fast on very rough roads with visions of huge smallies going through my mind."
516818,Guest,2002-02-13 21:51:00,0,"Homer and Wallhanger, thanks alot. Your opinions will definitely weigh in on my choice. If you will, one other question I would have is regarding towing a boat up there. As you know, the lodge boats do not seem like anything special. I would be coming from Chicago, thru Detroit and Toronto, then up to North Bay. I was wondering what the roads were like, if they were very hilly, or beat up along the way. I would prefer taking my regular lake boat up there (19 ft glass walleye boat), but I also have a 16 ft jon/25 hp that I use on rivers. The lodge manager seemed to feel the 16 jon would be OK. Any advice would be appreciated. Again, much thanks for the replies."
516819,Homer,2002-02-14 06:52:00,1127,"The roads are fine all the way from Detroit to Temiscaming, mostly highway, all good pavement, and few big hills. From Temiscaming, you'll have several miles of moderate quality dirt roads to get to the lodge, and several more miles of poorer quality dirt road if you're staying at the campground. I took my 14 footer up both trips, and didn't feel the need for anything bigger."
516820,Wallhanger,2002-02-14 07:30:00,17,"The roads are fine until you are within a few miles of the camp. Once you get on the dirt road leading to the camp you might be able to travel 15-25mph. Typical of Canadian roads leading into any camp, but in better shape than some I have been on.We took our 18ft Lund. If I'm fishing hard for a week I want to be as comfortable as possible and I want the ability to fish anywhere on the lake. I wouldn't take a jon boat. Take along rubber bumpers for docking and you will be fine. Watch out for rocks."
516821,Guest,2002-02-14 17:36:00,0,"Thanks again, guys. Did you guys find the smallies were bigger than average, as advertised, or was that overblown. Also, did they let you use live bait at all. Nothing like meat when the going gets tough. I am thinking of going there in Mid-July to Mid-August timeframe."
516822,Homer,2002-02-14 18:22:00,1127,"There are some huge smallmouths in there. Not all of them, but enough. We took a large number of leeches in both trips. My buddy who stays at the lodge says that they frown upon bringing leeches in, but he brings them in anyways (but keeps them hidden). He said there were numerous days where other anglers were grumbling about slow fishing where he had to fight to keep a big grin off of his face, because he was pounding them on live bait."
