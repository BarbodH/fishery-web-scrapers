517172,Guest,2002-02-12 17:30:00,0,Been reading alot about rods here. Going on first fly-in this summer. Do most of you guys use one piece rods or two. I know the one piece is generally better but what about packing on the fly - in?Any help please. Thanks
517173,Guest,2002-02-12 17:42:00,0,"personally a fishing rod is a fishing rod. that means 1 piece. otherwise you got two rods stuck together. 1 piece is marginally better but how good a fisherman are you? it might be handy to have that 2 piece if you're doing flyins tho. id buy a nice quality rod 1 or 2 piece and learn all the other stuff before worrying about how sensitive it is by being one or two pieces. one day you'll balance the rod on your wrist between the thumb and second finger and know what using a one piece means (boy are those picky eyes!),......but a lot of us have a lot of walleyes to catch before that time! lol!"

After all a 2 piece rod that is supposed to be 2 piece is much better than a 2 piece rod that used to be in one piece. Now when it comes to women's swim wear, I prefer the 2 piece, especially if she is wearing only one of them."

You wouldn't beleive the idiots that don't pack their rods though, reels attached, all lined up and in a bundle like they where 'gonna hand them to someone in a boat. What a fricking mess. Take any rods you want, properly cased."

We ended up having to take the 8 or 9 poles out of the rod caddy, no broken poles on the flight. I wouldn't trade my one piece ST. Croix walleye rods for a two piece anything...however I do have a couple two piece heavier Lake trout rods mainly for trolling.I always take the reels off all my rods when going on a trip. Keeps reels from getting banged up and leaves more room in rod caddy, never leave lures attached... One time had an idiot along that did that and sure enough while packing it ended up in some ones hand. Last time that happened. Have fun and enjoy the great north country. SWeed"
