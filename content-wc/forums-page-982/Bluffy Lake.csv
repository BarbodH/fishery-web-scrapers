517109,Dave,2002-02-11 11:01:00,258,Considering a trip this year to Bluffy Lake. Anyone had any experiences good or bad. I understand it used to be a fly-in lake and now you drive to it on a looging road. Only lodge with access to 3 lakes.

A number of other private cabins. An outpost on the smaller of the 3 lakes, plus easy road access to the third lake. Nice guy who runs the place, very personable and accomodating."

Terrific guy, easy going, wide variety of fishing with several lakes and rivers. He has newer boats and 15hp motors. Get the cabins with the toilet, some still are no so equipped. fishing consistent every time I've been there. Took two new guys there last year, one guy ""counted"" every fish that the two caught, I think they boated some 400 plus in one week in August. We had one or two really big ones, rest were smaller ones. Good value for your money. email me if you want more info"
