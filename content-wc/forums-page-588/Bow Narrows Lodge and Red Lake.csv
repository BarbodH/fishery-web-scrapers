In case there is, I'd like to know a little more about Bow Narrows Camp on Red Lake. I've searched the archives but find nothing about it and very little on Red Lake. Has anyone been there? How's fishing in July and August for Walleye and Northern for an occassional fisherman withoiut a GPS? The website doesn't mention numbers per day but implys 22 to 24 inch walleye on Red Lake. True?The lodge has both housekeeping and American Plan. How's the service and meals? Thanks in advance.Gary from Iowa"

Even though they live and fish red lake all season, they love going there. They rave about the food and service and look forward to the trip each yearAs far as fishing goes, the red lake fall classic is a catch and release walleye tournament that takes place labour day weekend on red lake, last year of the 140 teams that participate in the tournament, well over 2/3 of them fished the area around bow narrows camp, they are bringing in to the weigh in walleyes that are 24 to 31 inches. many of the teams that have won the tournament fish that area exclusively and have 10 fish weights of 30+ pounds. you are allowed to weigh in 2 fish over the size limit of 18"" and 3 under the 18"" each day, considering a fish that is under would probably weigh a pound and a half that would be 4 1/2 pounds per day of under sized fish or 9 pounds for the tournament leaving the other 21+ pounds to be weighed by the 4 over slot fish caught.There are large northerns (over 40+ inches) and HUGE lake trout in the same area. Lake trout are all catch and release in Red Lake.Hope this helps some, you won't be disappointed with fishing red lake."

Not to many walleye but really nice sized walleye several over 25"". The camp is nice and food is good and price unbeatable. One of the guys in our group is going the last week in July this year, and from what Dan Baughman says fishing is excellent that time of year. We fished post spawn fish and most were in under 12 foot of water. By the time you want to go they should be on full feed, and the numbers caught per day should be good. Dan will put you on the fish. We also caught some really nice Pike and Charlie caught a couple decent Lakers also. We will definetely go back someday. Dan runs a nice laid back camp. And Brenda is a Good cook and the staff is very good also."
