1072797,Bigfishhunter,2009-01-09 21:17:00,803,Why does it have to be Eastern Ontariio/Western Quebec? Must be travel distance. Northern Manitoba has some drive to fishing that kicks the pants off of some fly in places that I have been to.

1073192,sptrix,2009-01-12 05:24:00,175,"I think Paradise Lodge on Lake Athapapuskow is a great place. The owners, Ken and Carol MacClellan, are fantastic folks and treat you right. Rates are reasonable. Cabins/units are clean and functional. We've been there at least a half-dozen times.Athapap may be the best drive-to lake trout fishery in North America. I understand that a 53"" was caught (and released) a couple of weeks ago. We've caught fish up into the low 40"" class and dozens in the mid 30"" class. Hundreds around 30"" as well.It's also a great pike lake (many fish over 40"") and there are big walleyes there (I've personally seen a 35"" caught), but they have been a challenge for me to figure out on a consistent basis. For those looking for the remote Canadian experience, this is not your lake. It's near Flin Flon, which is a town of about 8,000 I'd guess, and that means that there is some recreation on the lake (I've seen waterskiiers and jet skis, but only once). There are literally dozens of other lakes in the immediate area, or within a reasonable drive, that offer fantastic fishing for walleye, pike, browns and brooke trout. It's definitely an area you could spend a lifetime exploring and never run out of ideas or options. We've fished at least a half-dozen lakes (some great, so not as great) and keep finding other lakes we want to try.Paradise Lodge does not have a website, so if you'd like their number PM me and I'll get it to you. Anyone wanting more info can also PM me.Thanks,Steve"
1073329,Bigfishhunter,2009-01-12 18:32:00,803,"Another great Lodge in the same general area (Cranberry Portage) just south of Flin Flon has an excellent drive to Lodge - Caribou Lodge Outfitters, they have a website www.huntnfish.ca They are located on a fantastic chain of Lakes. I fish these areas quite a bit every year. I can do great from june until september, with little to no slow times - except cold front induced of course. There are also no shortage of drive to lakes as well withing an hour of the place. Athapap (spoken about by sptrix) is literally right across the road. The Cranberries are on one side of the town and Athapap is on the other. (Hence the name Cranberry Portage)So much water so little time around here."

1081743,Mr Ranger,2009-02-17 10:40:00,272,"This one is in the middle of Ontario but one I have been to five times. O'Sullivan's Rainbow West of Nakina had been a great resort. Very good Walley fishery and good Lake Trout as well. Bob and Shelly Richard own the camp but live here in WI. They have tried to hold pricing despite all the economic challenges. Great camp, great people. Check them out.http://www.osullivansrainbow.com/"
1069412,moose1878,2008-12-20 10:08:00,9,Our favorite fishing camp has closed and we need a new one. I am looking for suggestions on a camp in eastern ontario or western quebec. Mainly fishing for walleye and pike but lake trout would be an added bonus. Drive to camp. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks

1070422,Obabikon,2008-12-28 09:24:00,2370,"Not sure Lake of the Woods can be considered Eastern Ontario... however, if it's an option... there's lots of wonderful camps on Lake of the Woods, and many of the Lakes in the area."
1070708,doubleheader,2008-12-30 08:59:00,2652,"You may want to look at the west arm of Nipissing. Trophy musky, nice bass, and a better walleye fishery than its reputation, however, no lake trout. There are a number of lodges on the west arm, we stay at lakair Lodge."
1070996,pike50plus,2009-01-01 08:33:00,584,www.bushlandadventures.com Kamwack and Clarkie have all 3 and some brookies too. Evans has huge pike and very nice walleye. Also got some new places not on the web site yet too. I am going back to Evans this July.
1071567,gary2242,2009-01-04 16:58:00,49,"HiI have the ultimate trophy Walleye lodge for you. Check out www.garden-island.com Garden Island Lodge is on an island in Lady Evelyn Lake. Lady Evelyn is one of the top Trophy Walleye lakes in Ontario. It's located 2 hours north of North Bay right close to the Ontario / Quebec border and there is no road access to it, which is why it's still an awesome walleye lake. A new experinced owner runs the lodge now. The old owner, who had a bad reputation, is long gone. I don't want to say any names.You will not be able to sit there all day catching 1.5 pound walleyes every cast like the far-north fly-outs. You will catch tons of walleyes but the average size will be 3 times what you get in the far north lakes. Lady Evely Lake is the top producer of 30+ inch Walleyes in the world. I can not think of any other lake where you have a better chance at catching multiple trophy walleyes in the same day. As far as numbers, you should still be able to catch over 50 walleyes per day but as I said before, the average size will be much larger and with all those monster walleyes in the lake, you will spend less time catching small walleyes in the shallows and find yourself hitting those 15-foot deep reefs for trophies. They also have Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Lake Trout and brook Trout fishing.gary"
1072466,pike50plus,2009-01-08 14:54:00,584,"With all due respect on lake Erie last year we caught 7 fish just on our boat alone between 30-33"" In our marina there were at least 35 fish over 30, east of Cleveland, OH. Erie is the best walleye fishing other than a few large producers in Sask and MB, but for total numbers Erie is by far the best, imho!"
