1081323,NickIL,2009-02-15 18:22:00,6,"Hello, Recently found this group - was expecting a narrow focus on walleye fishing, but glad to see it is much more which fits my interests more. I live in WC Illinois on a small lake with decent bass & muskie fishing and world class whitetail deer hunting. For extended opportunities I usually head south to Lake of the Ozarks and Bull Shoals or Ontario fly-ins (out of Sudbury). While the kids were growing up we did annual trips to Quetico where the sm bass fishing was out of this world. Kids are grown, I will be retiring next October (just in time for the rut), and will be picking up a lab puppy (my outdoor partner for the wxt 15 years) next Saturday. So here is my question - I plan to spend considerably more time in Canada (summers & early fall) with much of it trailering my small 16' 10hp boat and canoe. My wife will occasionally be with - in which case we will do the housekeeping cabin stays by ourselves or with friends/family. Everything I hear (some on this site) it seems like the Nestor Falls area would be a great place to focus my fishing interests. Does that segment of LOTW lend itself to small boat fishing? Canoe fishing? Also, how are some of the surrounding lakes such as Big Pine and Caliper (Provincial Campground)? I enjoy walleye fishing but also love to fish for smallies, pike, and crappies. I don't consider myself a muskie hunter but that could change. Any advice is appreciated. Nick"
1081329,Guest,2009-02-15 18:52:00,0,"I don't want to burst your bubble, but you'll find yourself stuck in the cabin often with a 16ft, 10 HP and canoe as your fishing options. Anything less than a wide 16 FT, deep V style Hull and 30 HP motor will make Lake of the Woods only a fair weather and light wind kind of lake for you. Even then, you'll probably not be wanting to head out into anything more than a 10 knot wind. Yes, there are plenty of islands to hide behind, but you'll still find yourself having to cross areas that will be more than a little dangerous with the set up you speak of. It's a great lake to fish and you'll have no problem finding fish, but I wouldn't suggest counting on a small boat and motor for a lake that size. They don't call it Lake of the Wind because it never gets any. :-) Good luck."
1081361,NickIL,2009-02-15 21:18:00,6,"Thanks for the quick response eyeguy. My 16'vee is a Polarkraft, but I use a 9.9 Yamaha because many of the lakes I fish here in Illinois have a 10hp limit. I got the impression that the ne area of LOTW was easier to manage in a smaller boat. So, I didn't think it would be diferent from the 16' 9.9 hp outfits we use at our flyin camps. Again - appreciate your experienced opinion. What about some of the smaller area lakes? Nick"
1081369,GNO,2009-02-15 22:09:00,153,"We are very close to the Nestor Falls area, just off the beaten path. There are many lakes around us and Nestor that would fit your needs and what you are looking for. If you want some ideas, shoot me an email and I would happy to give you some ideas.

1081416,walleycrazed,2009-02-16 07:45:00,13,NickWe use to go out of Sudbury Aviation years back. If you like that area there is a small place that is off the beaten path that you can trailer your boat to. Try and Google mckee's camp The rates he charges are very reasonable and your boat would work on any of the lakes.
1081458,NickIL,2009-02-16 09:34:00,6,"Walleycrazed, The drive to Sudbury, for us, was a little further east than we would have preferred but Mar's operation at Sudbury Aviation was very affordable and the walleye & sm bass fishing was very good. We used them again last August (MacSmith Lake) and were not disappointed. As I near retirement I want to spend more time in Ontario (preferably NW) but keep cost down by trailering my own boat and mixing in some camping with some stays at ""drive to"" HK cabin operations. Over a few years should settle in to the places I enjoy the most. Will be doing the same for a few swings south during the winter (after hunting season). Do you recall the lakes you fished thru Sudbury Aviation? Preferred alternatives? Nick"
1081695,rpieske,2009-02-17 07:11:00,1276,"I live in Nestor Falls from May to mid-Sept. and have fished this area for 56 years. Kakabikitchiwan (the lake that feeds the falls in Nestor Falls) is an excellent fishing lake for your boat and motor size. In the past few years it has really taken off for walleyes, bass, northern and crappies. It will provide you with all the action you want. On calm days, you can put in at the Government Boat Dock on LOTW and fish the areas close to Nestor FAlls. Stay inside Cyclone Point. It can get rough out there. I, too, would recommend a larger motor than 9.9 hp to fish LOTW to any extent. Caliper has some decent fishing. Big Pine is part of a chain that includes Kakabikitchiwan (sometimes called Little Pine). If you are fit, you can portage into Marl, Wigwam and Kishketena Lakes for additional fine fishing. There are other lakes in the Nestor Falls immediate area such as South Narrow and Crow (Kakagi). If you need recommendations on resorts or additional information about fishing this area, send me a person message or email and I'll be happy to fill you in. Nestor Falls is a nice small community and I love it there."
