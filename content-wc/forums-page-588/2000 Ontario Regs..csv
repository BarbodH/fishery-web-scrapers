Are the changes also effective on inland waters? Do these changes effect Lac Seul? I do hope that what ever steps needed are taken to protect the fishery , because living here in the Brainerd, Minnesota lakes area we see firsthand what overfishing and poor management has done! We fish for the experience and to us we are not to concerned about keeping any more than a couple to eat. That is just how we see it, maybe not everyone sees it that way but very very few of us have to keep fish to survive."
