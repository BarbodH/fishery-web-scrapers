1082496,lassh,2009-02-20 17:40:00,553,"We used to bring leeches in during early June and they worked quite well. However the cost of leeches in Canada is over $40/lb. and you can't bring them over the border any more. IMHO they are not worth that much. I have never tried them in May. In June they are a good bait. They keep well as long as you keep them cool and change the water every couple days. They stay on hook better than minnows. Sometimes fish prefer them, sometimes its crawlers or minnows and other times a twister tail is the ticket. Its just not worth $40 /pound because even though you can catch several fish on the same leech and jig or rig, you catch so many walleyes that you go through a pound quickly. Usually a piece of crawler is just as good."
1082535,guidedfishing,2009-02-20 21:51:00,531,"Really depends on the water temp, typically prior to Memorial day (US) minnows and crawlers as the water temp can still be to cold for leeches, usually by the 1st to 2nd week in June leechs can be a good bet. Leeches and minnows can be fairly expensive. Crawlers can be brought across the border as long as they are in newspaper bedding and do not have dirt or excessive worm caseing from long storage. We also bring in commercially preserved minnows, and use alot of plastic more so then gulp. We still buy live bait but not nearly as much as we used to. Like I said it all depends on water temp. If the water is to cold the leechs just ball up and are use less, soft plastic, crawlers and minnows are the tip then. At over $40.00 a lb, and for a true dozen minnows at 4.50 a dozen you get creative in a hurry. good luck GF"
1082599,prov1900,2009-02-21 09:59:00,544,"guidedfishing, Do you do your own preserved minnows, or do you purchase them from somewhere? We used them on the Red in the fall and had great luck, but never get around to making my own, or purchasing my own. I would like to have them as a back up this year. Minnow are spendy, but I just have so much confidence in them they are hard to put down."
1082709,guidedfishing,2009-02-21 18:24:00,531,"ProV, I usually buy preserve minnows at the local Fleet Farm. I can get a large package of vacuum sealed shinners in several different sizes. There must be 6 - 7 dozen minnows for about $8.00 bucks. I've had good success with them. I think they come out of Amherst Junction WI. Magic Bait company. I looked at their website but did not see any of the industrial strength packages that they sell at the local farm and barn. Maybe its in their catalogue. I've also bought some big preserve shad from them (same large size must of been a couple of dozen in there) that worked well on Lake Trout as well. they also have them dyed red and yellow, but I still like the plane jane silver sided shinners Most of the time I use purple ring worms with pearl / white tails, I usually cut the 4 in's down to 2 1/2 to 3 inchs and fish behind the jig, I have better success with plastic instead of gulp and its a lot cheaper. hope that helps good luck GF"
1082723,prov1900,2009-02-21 19:05:00,544,"Guided, are these the ones you use? I see these at Walmart, but have never used them. http://www.magicproducts.com/preservedbaits.htm"
1082774,guidedfishing,2009-02-22 07:53:00,531,"ProV, Same company, but that is not the industrial strength package that I am getting at the local farm and barn. The packages I am getting are 16 oz packages, with just a yellow label/sticker on them no fancy marketing. They are Emerald shiners and have a product code number on the label ""#5294 Large"" These shiner are approx 2 to 3 inchs long. Looking at a package right now easily over 6-7 dozen shiners in there. Manufactured by: Magic Products, Inc. Amherst Jct, WI 54407 GF"
1082775,guidedfishing,2009-02-22 08:00:00,531,"ProV, I just scrolled all the way to the bottom of the link you provided, and those are the packages at the very bottom. Yup, those are the ones, 16 oz's, you can't make them and package yourself for what can buy them for. I've also use the large shad for pike fishing as well. good luck GF"
1082778,prov1900,2009-02-22 08:25:00,544,Awesome. I figured if anything they would make a great backup to the spendy live minnows. Thanks for the help.
1083133,Rlcrouse,2009-02-23 16:28:00,286,"We salted our own minnows last year for a back-up and ended up using them all week. We got the ""recipe"" here, 1 cup of minnows, 1 cup of salt and some sugar, 1/3 cup maybe?? We seperated them into about a dozen baggies so the different boats could take a bag or two in case. I thing I paid about $50 for a gallon of minnows, which was a bunch."
