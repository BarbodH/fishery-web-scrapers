1079691,Jahloaf,2009-02-09 14:22:00,74,"I have recently taken up the hobby of tying my own maribou jigs and was wondering if anybody has used them fishing for walleye. If so do you have a color preference that works best? So far I am working with chartuse and orange. What about smallies, any luck with them? Thanks"
1079710,joeman79,2009-02-09 15:17:00,417,That's what we have used since I started walleye fishing. I use some plastics to like a half a twister and crawler. My favorite jig colors are are (orange and white)-(red black and yellow) and (chartreuse) and (Pink). I like the erie head (swimming Head) over round head because jig is level in water and has more action than a round head.

1079822,lobo1,2009-02-10 00:01:00,734,pretty much all we used on our trip last year was the white maribou and the green chartreuse maribou - I carry black too but I never got that deep in my box probly took 150 fish or so on these two jig patterns over a couple days on Lake St Joseph - NW Ontario. Here at home the same exact jigs HAMMER the smallies in the late spring. When the feedbag is on - you dont waste time with twisters or bait. I like power baits and gulp a lot but never mess with it when the bite is fast. FYI - i use the plain lead color head - unpainted good luck lobo1
1079888,Jahloaf,2009-02-10 08:32:00,74,"I've tried painting them but it's a pain, if you dip them they get this big drip on them and by hand with a brush takes 4 coats including primer.I might go to unpainted for the next 100 batch. Do you use any additional attractant like that Flashabou?"
1080095,Riceburner,2009-02-10 22:12:00,436,"Powder painting can be easier, and the finished lead heads will keep alot better. For small numbers , all you need is to heat up the jigs, and swirl them in a jar of powder paint briefly. As you do more, the quality will improve if you regulate the pre-heat and (after painting) cure the paint in an oven, and a fluidizer bed will puff up the powder paint for more economy and quality look. An unpainted lead head will oxidize with time, and the extra effort you put in tying tails will be affected. Lots of help avail here on WC--keep searching/reading."
