1056753,BrianS,2008-09-22 19:08:00,30,"Hello,I was researching some Canadian lakes that are fairly close to the border and was looking for ones that would provide an good walleye fishing experience. My dad turns 60 next summer and I want get him up to Canada again. A friend just got back from Rainy Lake and had a great time but is more of a bass and northern fisherman so wasn't targeting walleyes. I was wondering if Rainy Lake is a good bet for some good walleye action or are there better lakes in that area? Thanks, Brian"

Falls). . You won't be dissappointed!!! I have lived on and fished Rainy Lake and you can't compare it to Lac Seul for walleyes. You will catch quality and quanity of walleyes (averaging 20-26""). I have gone to Lac Seul now for 6 years and have NEVER been dissappointed! I fish the West side of the lake (south of Ear Falls, ON). Good resorts to try are: Fisherman's Cove or Onaway Lodge which are on a good location on the lake! Good luck and happy fishin! rather-be-fishin (10 months to go and counting down!)"
1056812,rudy,2008-09-23 06:35:00,36,"i have fished rainy many times and it is a GREAT walleye lake!if you have a navionics chip it's a cake walk.i prefer to go to the fisheries resort[www.thefisheries.com] in late june,all of july or august and fish seine,swell and redgut bay areas.the fish are on the reefs so it's just a matter of scouting the rocks until you find fish and then put a crawler,leech or minnow in front of them.it's that easy.no need to drive any farther than that for some fantastic fishing.even if the wind blows you can navigate from the bear pass narrows to some place to fish.i've caught them under the r.r bridge not 500 yards from the fisheries!expect to catch some nice pike and smallies on the same structures along with the walleyes."
1056814,Guest,2008-09-23 07:25:00,0,"I second Lac Seul. My wife and I have fished it for the last 12 years and have reservations again for next summer. It is a walleye factory. Also, we have never been disappointed. There are a lot of good resorts in the Ear Falls area - we stay at Whitewing. We not only enjoy the tremendous walleye fishing but the entire wilderness experience - beautiful scenery, lots of wildlife and plenty of great fishing spots without any other boats in the area.

1056833,JDP,2008-09-23 09:01:00,1457,"Brian, I sent you an e-mail message. I have fished Lac Seul for over 20 years, Rainy Lake just the last 3 years. IMHO Lac Seul beats Rainy for quantity, BUT Rainy Lake is NOT TOO SHABBY for quantity and the quality is OUTSTANDING.! Due to fishing pressure, I prefer the central and eastern portions of Lac Seul versus the west (Fisherman's Cove and Onaway are western locations but are very well run resorts). I have only fished Rainy Lake out of the Northwest Bay. Many areas yet to explore. Both lakes are awesome fisheries! JDP"
1080902,Guest,2009-02-13 20:22:00,0,"Hi, I'd put my money on Rainy Lake for a number of reasons: -location -walleye is hot with big fish -location again cause its so close to the border Here some proof http://www.gettinghooked.net/Episode_03_2009.html"
1080954,JDP,2009-02-14 07:01:00,1457,"Harvey, I stay at Vince's. I would like to meet you sometime. I do agree Rainy Lake is great. Last year on my week stay in July I caught 4 walleye between 28"" and 29 1/2"". JDP"
1081025,danceswithwaves,2009-02-14 11:04:00,17,I fish them both every year and Rainy passed Lac Seul last year for average size.
1081260,Guest,2009-02-15 12:13:00,0,"Hi JDP, Here's my contact info if you wanna talk sometime. It was July when we shot the shows, unfortunately the jig and bottom bouncer show didn't air. The walleyes being caught on X-Raps was shown, its pretty exciting when your fishing 12ft of water and the X-Rap only going down maybe 2 ft and the walleye were coming up and slamming the bait. Its kinds nice fishing NWB cause there's no free public boat launch, sure there is boat launch but you have to pay. If you wanna have shore-lunch NWB is not the place to fish, fish are to big, Red Gut bay has lots of eaters. My phone number is 807-482-9966 and my email is [email protected]"
1081296,JDP,2009-02-15 16:15:00,1457,"Harvey, I will give you a call sometime... JDP"
