What are some of the criteria for you fishing LOTW vs. another lake, (excluding fly-ins, which is another subject). Thanks!"
1079183,freespoolin,2009-02-07 09:02:00,472,LOTW has been very good for walleye fishing over the past 5-6 years. But I do prefer the Red Lake area because there is much less boat traffic on RL. LOTW has thousands of cottages. 80% of the boats are not fishing but there is a lot of boat traffic everywhere on the lake. My $.02.
1079207,rockpt,2009-02-07 11:05:00,589,"LOTW is an outstanding fishery for a border lake. If you get away from the major towns like Kenora and Sioux Narrows, it's mostly wilderness with very few cottages or lodges. With over 14,000 islands and more shoreline than California, you could spend a lifetime exploring it."
1079294,Obabikon,2009-02-07 18:17:00,2370,"Rockpt has hit the nail on the head. Lake of the Woods is a neat lake, because it is big enough to cater to all types of trip goers. If you're looking for seclusion, go to Morson. If you're looking for lots of lake options and able to go out to eat, go to Nestor Falls. If you're looking for a bigger city type trip where women can do (some) shopping, go to Kenora. None of these places are close to eachother. All have fantastic fishing. In my area (Morson) if you go to the right spots, you might not see more than a couple boats the entire day."
1079295,Obabikon,2009-02-07 18:20:00,2370,"To get more to your point. Average size has increased in LOTW's dramaticaly of late. It's very difficult to compare lakes. But, I'd put LOTW's up there with some of the best fishing lakes in NWO. The best thing about it is the excellent fishing of each species. You don't really give up one fish for another... Walleye, Musky, Northern, Small Mouth, Perch, and Crappie... all are among the best fishing (for that species) in NWO."
1079355,Bill Krejca,2009-02-08 08:20:00,6107,"The thing about the lake that seems to stand out for most new folks I take up is that you never know what you are going to catch. The variety of species is just phenomenal in most places. Due to many years of familiarity with it, it is my favorite body of water. Billl Krejca"
1082867,way2goofy,2009-02-22 13:54:00,22,"Being a returning 30 year + LOTW fisherman, I still enjoy every year. There is alot of boat traffic in Sioux Narrows but as soon as you get away from town you might only see a few boats all day. The best thing I can tell a newbie is to spend money on charts and study them. You go the wrong side of a marker bouy and you are going to at the least loose a prop. I learned the hard way the first several years. Make sure you have plenty of gas and bait for the day. Before I went to one 27 gal. tank I would take 3- 6 gal. tanks. One for the trip out and one for the trip back and a emergency tank. We fish walleye one day, crappie another and throw for pike in the evenings. Going up in August now I haven't tried for Lake Trout in years. They are deep and I never spent the $$ on downriggers. We use to fist Trout from shore in early June using smelt and bank fishing. I know smelt are illegal to use for bait now."
