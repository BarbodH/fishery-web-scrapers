1080898,otis,2009-02-13 20:16:00,20,Any new reports? Thinking about heading up there in a couple weeks.
1080937,Backwater Eddy,2009-02-14 00:56:00,3871,"Very good, in numbers as well as big sumo class walleye. I know of at least 4 15# class Greenbacks of the lake already. February is rock'n already, March should be even better if one can imagine that."
1081008,otis,2009-02-14 09:55:00,20,"Thanks for the report Eddy, I hear the ice is a little rough going. How far out on the lake are guys going to get on the fish."
1081059,LeeMB,2009-02-14 13:34:00,83,Guys are catching 4 to 8 miles from leaving shore. Depends on where you access. Haven't been my-se;f but heard that guys are going on at end of main and driving the 8 miles to the mouth of the lake.You can also drive around and go that way as well. There are some places where you can walk out and have good fishing near shore.
1081173,Backwater Eddy,2009-02-15 04:34:00,3871,Been very good!
1081885,Backwater Eddy,2009-02-18 05:49:00,3871,"The melt down and subsequent re-freezing has improved the lakes condition to access and fish. Heaves are an issue so there are still and will continue to be points of concern were one will need to use caution.I spoke with some guys in the know who have been on it steady and there words..""The bite is just stupid!"" The quantity and size of these fish is beyond most anglers comprehensions, and by all accounts historically March is far better for ""Big Walleye""...as if multiple #13 to #14 fish on a trip is not big enough now...and I know of 5 over #15 and a #16 recently....so just consider March then...if one can imagine that potential.Uf-Da!"
1082134,Chad711,2009-02-19 08:16:00,11,"Hi Ed, I was one of the lucky ones to break the 15 mark, I had a 15.11oz feb 8th. I am pretty sure I have drove by you at some point as i have spent 20 full days on the Red/Winnipeg in the last 2 ice seasons. What type of truck and house do you have?"
1082462,ferriswheel,2009-02-20 14:30:00,29,"Guys are driving out on the Red this year to get to the mouth of the Lake but be aware that the ice breaker will be moving in around March 1 and breaking up the ice to minimize Spring flooding. Once it starts, travel is not recommended or advised on the river. Guys will have to access the old fashioned way."
1082502,Backwater Eddy,2009-02-20 18:55:00,3871,"Nice fish!I fish out of Frabill's and likely a new Commando. What I'm in depends a lot on the conditions. We Frabill guys often travel in ""Packs""....look for the Black & Gold herd and I'm likely to be near.I'll be back up between the 5th and the 13th of March, should be staying at ""Cats on the Red"" and running with my HOMEIES either on sleds or on tracks...or on wheels...Eh."
