When I fished press, I spent most of my time in the english river and where it dumped into press. It was never an issue catching mess of eater walleye's but we never really tied into anything substantial very frequently other than a rogue pike in the river now and then. You will be satisfied for quantity but maybe a little disappointed in size 15 to 17 was pretty common, but not much above at least consistently. Like I said its been a while, and I never have fished press in the fall. I do fish area lakes in the fall and my experience has been that the catch rate is almost as good as in the spring, but we always do better on size. Depending on when you go in Sep, it could still be similiar to a late summer bite fishing the deeper edges and humps. And like most canadian lakes press has its fair share of water hazards so beware, one minute in 60 feet of water then a rock the size of a house just under the surface and 60 feet again. I fish other lakes in the area that have lake trout, as I do love chasing them, and also seem to have some larger walleyes. either way I don't think you can go wrong. I've never talked to anyone who has been disappointed in fishing press. good luck GF"
