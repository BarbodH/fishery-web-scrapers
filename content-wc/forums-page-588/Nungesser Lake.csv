1079330,steve03,2009-02-07 21:19:00,22,Thanks everyone for the information. What tactics would you use for pike on this lake? any specifics?
1079338,lobo1,2009-02-08 01:10:00,734,From the best pike guy I know of up there - who also hapeens to own a lodge on the lake - Kevin Geary - he says that on this lake the best way is with bait and a bobber. After watching countless hours of this guy catching pike via other means (on his TV show and the old advertisement for Waynorth Lodge) I would have never believed it unless it came out of his mouth while I was standing there....but it did. Suicks work for him too and he stresses long pauses built into the retrieve - if the fish aren't aggressively feeding. We choose to not use bait when we go north ........or bobbers for that matter - just our choice. We used typical spoons and cranks and did fine on pike but no bruisers either - I cant recall but I think our biggest was 36 or so. go back in my posts on this lake and maybe I mention size but nothing to brag about....with all the bait in this lake I know there are some hogs but we only had 5 days to look. There were spots on this lake where there were great baitfish pods down deep 30 feet or so. I bet if you ran some deep divers or something with heavy snap weights - there could be some bruisers down there. good luck!
1081165,steve03,2009-02-14 23:40:00,22,Thank you for the information. I wondered what depths big pike could be found at in the mid-summer?
1082386,Guest,2009-02-20 08:46:00,0,"I have been to Nungesser Lake several time and heading their again this year. We have always been at the end of July or first of August. We go every other year, but have landed a Pike over 40"" each of the last 3 trips. In 2007 landed 39, 40, and 42. Depths varried, and sometimes 5 feet of water to 25 feet of water. It depends on the weather and cover. Walleye fishing has always been good and numbers have never been a problem. As said before the lake is not crowded, but you will see others in areas you might want to fish, but there is always an open place with fish."
1078697,steve03,2009-02-04 23:52:00,22,I was wondering if anyone knows how Nungesser compares to a fly-in lake for walleye and pike?
1078709,Larry Mac,2009-02-05 06:11:00,530,"Hi Steve03,I have never fished Nungesser Lake personally but I have friends who went there this August. They have taken fly-in trips before. Talking with them they were very pleased with their results. They caught a lot of walleye and pike. The walleye were larger than your typical fly in lake. They went to Anglers Kingdom which is run by Kevin Geary (Outdoors Encounters TV Program) they were happy with the trip. They actually posted some of their son's walleye pictures on his website pretty impressive. Have a great trip this year.www.anglerskingdom.com Thank you,Larry Mac"
1078711,bartfire,2009-02-05 06:18:00,9,"We have been going to Nungesser Lake Lodge for the last 10 years, and have stopped looking at other places. After about 20 years of trying different camps of all types. The lake is tremendous, and the hospitality at the lodge is second to none. You won't be disappointed with either."
1078749,Pooch,2009-02-05 09:51:00,4619,Search Nungesser on this website. Over the years there has been alot of chit chat about the lake. Several camps on the lake plus at least one outpost I believe.Pooch
1078847,tweath,2009-02-05 16:15:00,6,"Was there last June. ur group did very well on walleye. We caught them all over the lake including a 26"" and 28"". Did not fare as well on northern. May have just been a bad week for pike."
1078900,steve03,2009-02-05 20:04:00,22,"We are heading up the 25th of June, just wondered if there were any good walleye and pike spots?"
1078972,5richards,2009-02-06 07:43:00,131,"My group fished at Kevin Geary's camp three years ago and had a great time. If you stay with Kevin, he will put you on fish ---- we found pike in of all places -- Pike Bay -----and a narrow passage in the northern portion of the lake --- can't remember the name of the area and will try to pull out the map and check. Walleye are easier to find -- mostly everywhere. Read Kevin's articles about fishing for pike -- the recommendations for line and lures were helpful. Email me for more info if you want -- [email protected]"

1079133,lobo1,2009-02-06 23:05:00,734,Our experience was a good one at Nungesser but have had better fishing elsewhere for numbers. Also - when I think of a fly-in I think of remoteness and having the place to yourself. This place isn't Lake Erie on a Saturday in June but you will see other boats no matter where you go on this lake.
1079186,tparker,2009-02-07 09:08:00,100,"Visited Nungesser for the first time last June. Stayed at Birch Point Camp. Great trip. Camp was great, and camp owner Roy Green was top notch. Took us out the first day to show us around the lake and to help us find fish. We caught plenty of walleye every day, with a few pike thrown in even though we didn't fish for them. Walleye up to 25.5"", although there were a few 28's caught in camp that week. I'm going back in July this year, and hopefully many more times in the years to come. We did see other boats, but certainly not a ""crowded"" lake. Plenty of water to fish. We caught tons of fish, including our biggest off a point about 200 yards from camp. I've stopped looking for camps to go to. I've already found the one that fits the bill for me."
