1082126,Babamel2,2009-02-19 07:31:00,414,"I may be one of the last ones. as of Friday Feb 22, I have to wait a half a year. We are leaving on Aug 21. Bummer. However, I may go twice as I am thinking about doing a trip in early July."
1082595,prov1900,2009-02-21 09:42:00,544,"Babamel, I wouldn't call that a bummer at all. We always take our trips early in the year, then when it is over, it is over. I envy those that are in that preparation stage of the trip. The trip itself always goes so fast, I take the time to enjoy getting ready for it. Menus, equipment, maintenance, spending $$ on new stuff...it doesn't get any better."
1082603,Guest,2009-02-21 10:20:00,0,"90 days to our spring trip.....Minaki....I agree that the preparation is a huge part of the enjoyment.I have a room at home just for my Canadian trips.There is always a half dozen tupperware containers is different stages of being unpacked and repacked as well as rods reels and assorted equipment.Kitchen box,boat boat etc. Depending on the next destination and type of trip (i.e. fly-in,Drive-in,two man,eight man etc.)"
1082718,guidedfishing,2009-02-21 18:54:00,531,"Used to always go up for the opener, now I wait until a few days before memorial day. ( between shoveling snow out of the boat and breaking ice at the landing waiting a another week has worked well.) It does jam me up a little as I usually head back up for another week the 2nd week of June. When it works out a July trip, but always get one last week in Sept. That is actually the trip I really look forward to is the fall trip. No other boats, usually just as fast action but the fish run bigger. I am fortuante enough that I have enough time, and close enough to run up for a long weekend. Usually the spring and summer trips I camp, but the fall trip is in a cabin, and its nice to have a warm bunk and shower with sauna after a day in the rain or sleet. One of my first trips up many many years ago was with a old timer that had waited most of his live before going up. I made a promise to myself to go as often as I could afford to go. I will not be wishing I had went more when the time comes I can not make the trip which I hope is many many years away. good luck GF"

1082817,way2goofy,2009-02-22 10:21:00,22,"I make a LOTW's trip every year but the past 10 years have had to go in August due to work related schedules for some of the guys on the trip. We have 174 days before our trip. I went up for the first time in 1970 just after getting out of the Navy. I have missed 2 years in all those years. The year I moved with my job and the year my mom passed away. It is a tradition and I would hate to miss a trip. I'm going to go until my old body tells me I can't go anymore which I hope is many years off. Over the years I've camped on islands out of Soiux Narrows. I've stayed at high end resorts and also the basic housekeeping setup. I still remember when Yellow Girl Lodge was open and remember the Yellow Girl Ferryboat hauling guests out to the camp. I've stayed at Motlong's Rod & Reel, Hidden Valley Resort (closed), Totem, Wiley Point Lodge and Crawford's Camp. We always seem to migrate back to Crawfords."

1081816,danceswithwaves,2009-02-17 18:02:00,17,I probably have a thousand dollars in the tackle box so I go out and spend another 20$ on tackle today.
