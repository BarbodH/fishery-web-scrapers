1081219,retire55,2009-02-15 09:24:00,1029,Chris: Here's a web reference to the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources that provides info about non-resident outdoors cards and non-resident fishing licences - see http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_165323.html
1081701,gary2242,2009-02-17 07:38:00,49,"HiNext time you buy a fishing license in Ontario, you will be required to pay an extra $9 for the outdoor card, which will last 3 years. All residence here in Ontario have one and now it's being extended to non-residence. The MNR needs the money from licenses for stocking and conservation programs. There are so many people selling counterfeit licenses that they had to go to the card. There are other resons as well. You can read more herehttp://www.garden-island.com/ontario...tdoor-card.htmgary"
1082220,cspierings,2009-02-19 15:04:00,230,Thanks to the input you folks provided I think we are going to try to take the whole brood to Canada for some fishing this coming summer. Probably in late July or early August to get a bit better rates and warmer weather since the whole clan isn't up to 10 hours in a boat all day for a week. CHris
1080470,cspierings,2009-02-12 12:19:00,230,"Can any of the folks on this board who actually run camps in Canada shed some light and confirm or refute the rumors I'm hearing about additional licensing and certification being necessary to fish in Ontario this year? Rumor 1: Non-Residents will be required to purchase some sort of recreation license (~$10) in additon to an non-resident fishing license to fish in Ontario this year. Rumor 2: To operate a power boat in Canada you will be required to show that you have some sort of state approved boater safety certification. Are these rumors even close to reality? Thanks, Chris"
1080472,Glenman12,2009-02-12 12:24:00,762,"I have heard something about the boating certificate but I dont know when thats going to happen..Im sure the locals do As for the fishing license, yes, you have to purchase an Outdoor Card for $9 first before you can get a license"
1080476,Golden Eagle,2009-02-12 12:46:00,2642,"I'd be happy to pay for a handgun permit to carry through the provinces of Illinois, Wisconsin and Ontario. Yes, I'm being a smartbutt, but I'd like for it to happen. Adding Illinois and Wisconsin would be a big plus. Paying $9 for an outdoors card is not a problem. Will be purchasing my 46th annual Ontario fishing license this May and my problem is adding to that total."
1080483,Mohleye,2009-02-12 13:17:00,368,"The Outdoor card is good for 3 years, so it's not an extra $9.00 every year. I believe the purpose is to set up an electronic system for licensing. The boating certifcate does not apply to non residents, unless you stay in Canada for an extended period. I can't remember the exact terms but it's been discussed on here repeatedly, and this is not something that will affect the typical vacationer."
1080493,cspierings,2009-02-12 13:51:00,230,"Thanks for the updates guys. I'm not trying to stir up a big deal over the fees I just want to know what I would be getting into and at a recent fishing show I got a bunch of info from people who didn't run lodges in Canada talking about all the extra costs this year. I think most places are feeling the pinch and try to make others look more attractive by pointing out fees etc.. We are thinking real seriously about taking our whole family to Canada this year for a fishing trip before the kids get too old. 6 people... I'm looking at a pretty good chunk of change to just get into Canada, get them all licensed and get them all home - Passports really hurt and that isn't something that resulted from Canada that is the US side. I have taken my son to Canada twice but that was pre-Passport requirement and at that time I was told he had to have a non-resident angling license so I'm figuring something like $77 a head to get everybody licensed unless I go conservation licenses. I'm in for about $850 and $1000 in Passports and licenses by the time we are all done. I was told the boating thing might not go into effect for all until 9/15/2009 as well and since that is likely after our trip that may not be a factor. Thanks for the help. Chris"
1080495,v-bay gord,2009-02-12 14:18:00,3168,"Chris......an 8 day fishing licence is $43.50........the 8 day conservation is $25.25. ...that is in Cdn $. Kids under 18 do not need a licence to fish but their fish, if kept, goes on your licence. The boating regulation comes into effect in September and will require that non resident boaters who are renting a camp boat sign a safety check list.....or have a state boater safety card. The check list will not cost you anything and should be available at most camps. By the way all Canadian residents will require a boater safety card by mid September too....so it is not just nonresidents. If you are bringing your own boat up to Canada to fish there is no restrictions unless you are here more than 30 (?) days. That's my understanding so whoever is trying to scare you with all the upcoming costs has likely other motives."
1080727,Flip Silverlake,2009-02-13 10:28:00,645,"The nonresident requirement is 45 days or more in the country (without leaving) you need to have this card. Not hard to get just check with your local DNR for the classes they hold. The card does not have to be issued in Canada. A card issued by any DNR type from any state will do just fine. The Outdoors card I guess is to help keep the issuance of licenses' eisier. It's susposed to make it eiser to get a license on line, and at a sport shop quicker. I think it's like the system thats inplace in Wisconsin where you give them your SS number and the computer pukes it out for you."
1080759,Nimstug,2009-02-13 12:11:00,2605,"Did you look into passport cards? They are wallet size and cost less than regular passposts. The are only good for travel by car returning from Canada or Mexico.If you don't see a need for your family members returning by air from out of the country for the next few years, that could help.Hope things work out for you and your family. You'll have a great time.NimstugThe most important work you ever wil do will be within the walls of your own home. -H.B. Lee"
1081188,Dan G,2009-02-15 06:37:00,31,"Chris,Don't listen to rumours....because....as you have said above, they rarely resemble reality. You are always best going to the source for proper answsers. MNR has a web site that will clarify your questions....maybe. Like most governmental sites, they are difficult to wade through...but you can glean your information there. That being said...V-Bay Gord's post above is spot on.Good Fishin'Dan"
1081215,cspierings,2009-02-15 09:09:00,230,"Guys, Thanks for the information. I'll have to see what I can figure out about trying to bring the licenses and passport fees down a bit. I realize I have a bit larger family than most, I was surprised when the twins were on the way too Chris"
