I realize one needs documentation from parents which ideally should contain a phone and also be notarized. Have you had many problems with taking them to Canada or back to USA?"
1081783,Obabikon,2009-02-17 15:11:00,2370,"I have lots of grandson/grandpa trips to the camp. No major issues ever. You don't have to have the note notorized, however, it's a good idea. In the note, have the dates of your trip, location, and contact information for the parents. They also require a birth certificate or passport for the child."
