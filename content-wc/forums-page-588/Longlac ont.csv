1082558,Big Tex,2009-02-21 06:04:00,27,His rates are too high
1082572,Guest,2009-02-21 07:15:00,0,"I must have missed something...I went to the website for Lukinto lake lodge and i thought the facilities looked great for the money. I know nothing about the fishing though. I haven't been on Mckay since the mid 80's and even then we were primarily bear hunting. The cabins at Lukinto look quaint , clean,and inexpensive. Maybe I am too easy to please."

The camp is located on a beautiful lake but you wont spend a lot of time fishing there. You can either take your own boat or use one of the camp boats which is kept at several of the local lakes."

The camp has changed hands since I went there but from the website it looks like it's actually been improved, and I thought it was great back then. The rates are very reasonable (they're quoted in Canadian $$) and the fishing is excellent. Fernow and Chipman were always my favorite lakes, but I have fished almost all of the ones that are listed on their website."
1083287,Big Tex,2009-02-24 09:27:00,27,"$764 for 2 in a cabin with washroom,I can stay at to other camps for $215 person for same type camp in the same area"
1083351,Fishoil,2009-02-24 13:42:00,1277,What are the other camps and do they have boats on Fernow or Chipman? For that price I might have to think about an extra trip this year. PM me if you don't want to post the names on here.
