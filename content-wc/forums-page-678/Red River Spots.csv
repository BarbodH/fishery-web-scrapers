I am seeing if people could refresh my memory on where locations are on the River. I remember names like Miracle mile, Sugar Island, and Float plane base. I just can not remember where specifically they are all located at on the river. I know a lot of these main spots will have plenty of boats on them, but it would still be nice to put a name on the spot I was fishing. Seeing if there was a map available with this information on it, or if people could direct me from the park launch and tell me generally where things are. For example I know if you get off the boat ramp in the park, you head down river about a mile and you will find Sugar Island. Just seeing if people could give me distances to spots from the landing, or land marks to look for when I am there. Like stated earlier, I am not specifically looking for any honey holes, just basic spots to try. Thanks"
