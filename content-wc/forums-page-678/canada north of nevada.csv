560128,Guest,2006-08-09 01:31:00,0,maybe some one can help with this question I cant.
560152,Guest,2006-08-09 12:12:00,0,Just fly to Winnipeg or International Falls and come back to LAke of the Woods. Flying from Vegas would be faster than driving from Chicago...........
560208,Guest,2006-08-10 14:21:00,0,yes you have a point there. I might have to rethink this a little.. I was sort of hopeing that a could find fishing like that out here close by.
560265,Guest,2006-08-11 22:12:00,0,"I've caught a lot of trout in Utah - Browns, Rainbows, Lakers, Cutthroat but no walleyes."
560403,Guest,2006-08-17 01:22:00,0,"OK thanks. I ran accross a dnr web page of nevada that told what lakes had what kind of fish in it and like most things , i cant find it now. i know they mentioned walleyes out here and northern are concidered a trash fish out here. i dont know why i like them myself. ok well thanks i will keep on looking. alan"

560637,Guest,2006-08-25 11:18:00,0,Ryepatch Reservoir (closer to Reno) used to have walleyes in it?
558745,Guest,2006-06-22 21:23:00,0,Hi. we usually went to lake of the woods from chicago but just retired and moved to vegas area. will miss our yearly trip to canada. any one know anything about canada that is out west for fishing???. maybe due north of nevada area? thanks. I know everyone here is from the midwest but you folks are generally in the know about things like this. thanks a lot. alan
558765,Guest,2006-06-23 12:51:00,0,There are good fishing opportunities in the west too especially trout in the B.C.interior. Sturgeon are huge in the Fraser River as are the salmon runs along the coast.
558843,Guest,2006-06-26 09:31:00,0,"Come to Saskatchewan. 100,000 lakes. If you are interested let me know( price range, species etc ). I can point you in right direction."
558853,Larry L,2006-06-26 13:33:00,335,Pretty hard to top Saskatchewan. It has about anything you want from do it yourself drive ins to far north fly ins. I have fished it from just barely out of Regina to outposts on fly ins out of Wolloston Lake. I have never been disappointed.
558936,Larry S,2006-06-28 08:23:00,666,"Alan,Moved to Nevada from Schaumburg in 1998, have lived in Henderson for 8 yrs ,just returned from a fly-in to Ontario. Give me an e-mail at [email protected] and we can exchange phone numbers and talk about fishing Larry S"

558954,Guest,2006-06-28 22:25:00,0,OK i did larry. thanks.
559028,Larry S,2006-07-03 08:01:00,666,"Alan, Haven't gotten your e-mail,please re-send Larry S"
559084,Guest,2006-07-05 11:31:00,0,"Depends on what you want to catch. Coastal BC for Halibut, Salmon, etc. Interior BC- Rivers (steelhead + salmon runs) or lakes w/ Rainbows, Lake Trout, Dolly Varden, and Kokanee. Further east you have Alberta with walleye, northern, Grayling, lake trout. Most directly straight north of Vegas Then on east to Sask where the freshwater fishing is legendary. 100,000 choices in Sask, alone. I forgot Yukon. Well, they have great sheep, goat and moose hunting :)"
559281,Guest,2006-07-11 22:58:00,0,"Hi. we always fished for walleyes , northerns. basically what ever grabbed our line. I dont think we are too fussy what we catch. around lake of the woods we would spend about a grand for a week of housekeeping cabin. we had our own boat too then up there. dont mind spending a little more if its that great though. point me please. thanks a lot. alan"
