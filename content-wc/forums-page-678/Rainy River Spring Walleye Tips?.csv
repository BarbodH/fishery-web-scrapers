Plenty of tips and what not for fishing Walleyes and Sturgeons on the river and lake too. Sturgeon fishing is down right easy and lots of fun thats for sure.

561250,Guest,2006-09-18 22:19:00,0,why?
561252,River_eye,2006-09-19 11:47:00,1486,What?
561255,Mohleye,2006-09-19 13:41:00,368,"When, where?"
561324,Guest,2006-09-22 08:44:00,0,"It all depends on where i'm fishing. If i'm fishing west of Long Sault I'm usually looking for breaks along shore or trolling flats. Most of time I'm pulling no.5 or no.7 shad raps, also try pulling reef runers. Now when I'm pulling up by Manitou, lots of shallow water up there I pull Lil Rippers or shallow diving cranks."
561362,Guest,2006-09-23 21:53:00,0,Awesome. Sounds great Harv.. Walleye21

560661,prov1900,2006-08-26 10:54:00,544,"We fished it in late May for the first time. I would definately go back, but we got handicapped because I didnt have the right anchor. I have since solved that problem. In other words, anchoring was the ticket at that time. From I Falls west, there are only a handful of spots that you have to concentrate on. Follow the boats, get your up to date info from the bait shops. The one in I Falls behind the Holiday Gas Station, cant remember the name, is real helpful. Heck of a fishery. I guess the fishing is good all year long."
560678,Guest,2006-08-27 14:27:00,0,"I was born and raised on the river and have been fishing it since I was a kid {way back...lol} But seriously having owned a business on the river and outlining areas, Rainy River is still the best chance at big fish and consistent numbers in spring, but don't miss fall bite also. Some of the places I check in spring is shallow stretches of the river, also try eddies mainly at Long Sault and Manitou Rapids. Bring jigs, usually 3/8 should suffice. Try trolling crank in deeper water in the outlining of deep water. Just call me or email me for more info [email protected] or 807-482-1060"
560681,Guest,2006-08-27 20:38:00,0,hey thanks for the tips Prov1900 and Harv...What kind of live bait do you think works best harv? Walleye21
560689,Guest,2006-08-28 11:56:00,0,"Best live bait....hmmmmm, minnows work most of time but sometimes can't beat shiners. Crawlers in summer, sometimes in fall. Most of time fish are going so good that you don't have time to mess around with live bait and plastics work better, time wise anyway."
560709,Guest,2006-08-28 22:19:00,0,"use fire line so if you get a sturgeon instead of a walleye, you can boat it"
560711,Guest,2006-08-28 22:59:00,0,thanks for the tips guys....would u guys know how big them sturneons get in the rainy river...i hear they get huge..but i dont know if i am just hearing fish stories...
560723,Guest,2006-08-29 11:01:00,0,"Sturgeon are huge and can be caught up to 100lbs. My biggest is 73lbs., took me 45 minutes to get in. Got all the pics you need to see for proof of all past guests."
