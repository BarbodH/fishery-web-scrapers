561260,Guest,2006-09-20 08:35:00,0,I am considering trying this and did not know if anyone had tried this for smallmouth. We fish LOTW and I have never tried this technique???
561295,Guest,2006-09-21 15:35:00,0,"I use it a lot on the Winnepeg River at Minaki. It works good, just not as explosive as topwater, beating the bank with tubes or spinnerbaits, etc. Schooled smallies in the fall is when it seems to work best -- before the baitfish finally migrate to the shallows. I like small minnow immitating baits (livin' eyes, gulp minnows) and smaller worms (4"" berkley, 4"" zoom) the most. I use the cylindrical weights--they don't seem to hang up as bad. Pull up to a reef and see if you mark fish about 2-3' above the bottom. Drop the rig down and work it for a few minutes... If you don't get a smallie or two within 5 minutes, go to the next reef or vertical ledge. In the fall, it's not difficult to nail 5-10 smallies from a school before the rest finally spook. In the summer, you probably won't get more than 2 or 3... Chuck"
561354,bronzeback77,2006-09-23 11:39:00,97,I was up on LOTWs labor day week and fished with a dropshot a large percentage of the time. We fished the edges of reefs as well as long deep points and saddles. Caught a lot of nice fish several close to 20 inches. The fish were holding pretty deep 20-30 ft and the dropshot out produced everything else. We fished Yamamoto Kuhuna Cut Tail Worms in Watermelon Black/red and Black/Red. We Caught some nice fish in the same areas on Deep Shap Raps and 1/4 football jighead and a pumpkin chomper grub.
