560800,Mike M (Sask),2006-09-01 14:48:00,374,Price per litre is just going down. Here in Moose Jaw it's around $1.05 and I think it's similar price in Regina. Hopefully it keeps goinf down... But I doubt it! Here is a link on gas prices. You can pull up prices all over the place.http://www.saskgasprices.com/
561262,Guest,2006-09-20 10:18:00,0,"$0.939 per litre, southern Saskatchewan"
561278,Reels,2006-09-20 21:53:00,2876,"Hey, 89.9. What a deal compared to June! <{{}}><"
561288,uzzi,2006-09-21 10:56:00,349,down to 90.9 centes in Melfort! But diesel is sitting at 92.9.....not sure how oil companies can have the price of regular above the price of diesel.....isnt diesel a byproduct of refining to make regular?
561328,Guest,2006-09-22 09:54:00,0,No diesel fuel is NOT a byproduct of refining....diesel fuel is drawn off at a slightly lower level of the cracking tower. At 90 cents per liter equates to well over 3.00 per gallon. YOU are getting ripped off in Canada by ALL the addition socialist taxes added on by Ottawa. WAKE -UP!!!! In Michigan I just filled-up yesterday for 2.039 for reg and I filled up my diesel compact utility tractor for 2.49.

561340,2 DOGS,2006-09-22 15:49:00,361,"I guess I must still be in Canada, not Colorado. The diesel here is $2.89 and reg. unleaded is $2.70 this was at a Total station 2 miles off the interstate. Go figure."
561345,Rich J,2006-09-22 21:57:00,65,2 Dogs I just filled up today $1.98 gal super unleaded. Rich J DM Iowa
