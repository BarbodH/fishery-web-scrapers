560669,Guest,2006-08-26 17:14:00,0,"This is one of those questions that could be answered in several ways. You need to look around. How high is the chop on the water? Are you fishing a point or shoreline where the wind is blowing into? We fished when it was dead calm and caught fish in 18 fow. If the wind blows softly, we caught fish in 12 fow. If it really started to blow the fish were in 9 fow. If it was one of those hang onto your hat days, the fish were in 5 fow. There are so many variables that you can't just say ""I'm going out to 25 fow and we'll nail 'em"""
561190,Guest,2006-09-14 00:17:00,0,"Exactly Stringbean.......that is why we call it ""fishing"" and not ""catching"". The fishing Gods want us to do a little work out there and use a little good sense, keen awareness, and sometimes we even have to think. (Heaven forbid) My experience this year on LS was below average to average at best. I actually had to think about what I was doing to put fish on the end of my line. But after it was all said and done our party decided that we had done a much better job of ""Fishing"" this year. Put all the variables into the equation and you will do what you go there for. Ignor the variables, and enjoy a nice boat ride. Good luck, and don't forget to toast to the fishing Gods."

We did well for our 1st time there, but they said the fishing is slower this year due to a very slow water release from the dam. No jigging was required, just tight line and drag or still fish along the bottom, they wouldnt take a vertically moving bait very often. a pole left alone often caught more fish than one in your hands."
561206,Guest,2006-09-14 20:55:00,0,"Steve, Am going up next week to Lac Seul . Sounds like you had a tough time. Did you try any spots that i marked on your map? Will let you know how we did when I get back."

Our group had the same obsevation in June, sometime you would have feel your jig head swim away B4 setting the hook Strange year."
561230,Guest,2006-09-15 21:26:00,0,"I agree that our best bite was using 2 splitshots about 1' above a plain hook or jig w/ 1/2 a crawler and just dropping it over the side of the boat. We anchored on points/reefs letting out enough slack rope to ""swing"" some but if you weren't tight on bottom the bite was tough. Probably 1/3 of our fish were caught while dropping the bait/splitshots to the bottom & the ""eyes"" would hit as you tried to reel up a crank or 2 to get the bait off the bottom. 1st time on Lac Seul also. Good luck !!"
561242,Guest,2006-09-18 00:32:00,0,"LSfisherman.....good to hear from you again. We were at Onaway again the end of June. We averaged about 40-50 fish per day but it seemed as soon as we got on to something they would hit, they decided to change. We caught much more fish on a nightcrawler this year than we ever did in the past. Water was almost 10 degrees warmer than last year and air temp was warmer too. Sunny all week in the 70-80's. No rain all week, great for June summer. I hit just about all my usual haunts, the Honey Hole was by far the most productive, and in the main Lake north of South Inlet. With some of my other spots were like the dead sea. It always depended on wind, water temp, and depth. Found a couple of new spots too, just by reading the wind and finding likely structure. I fished all week with a newbie in the front of my boat, who was used to catching 4-5 a day. He was like a kid everytime we landed a fish. The disk he gave me had over 700 pictures on it."
