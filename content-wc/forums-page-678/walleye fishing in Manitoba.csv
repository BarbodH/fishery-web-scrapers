561224,canuk1100,2006-09-15 17:16:00,43,All it takes is once and the river is unfishable (LOL) I wish that more people would come up here to see for themselves and fish. There are about 20 miles of river that is not crowded just cruise on by the 5 miles that are I have a few spots that I have to keep to myself so that they aren't crowded. This way if my guide service does go through I'll have someplace to fish.
561227,River_eye,2006-09-15 17:59:00,1486,"You are right, the sewage spills are quickly diluted. Really, the main impact on the sewage spills is on Lake Winnipeg's Eutrophication problem, and doesn't affect the walleye fishing."

Believe that happened back in >August. > >Roger That happened 2 times this year. The water north of the locks in Lockport is WAY different than the brown gravy to the south. It gets much better due to the water from Lake Winnipeg. If you were to start from the city and motor north towards the locks you can tell the difference in quality. It's all the same system but i would NEVER eata fish that came city centre, but DO eat fish from the north side. However, catch and release on the south side is fun. Note: wash the boat and flush the engine when done! lol The action for Sauger right now is excellent on the north side. Barbless tip: after pinching the barb, give the hook slight twist the side. Barbless is much more challenging and fun for that matter, better for the fish, and environment. Keep the line tight and you're good (yeah right! lol). Shoot with barbs, you can set the hook then go for a sh!t and a beer. Cheers!"
561233,Northern Manitoban,2006-09-16 13:47:00,195,"There are many great area's to fish in Manitoba for walleye, my favourite spots are the Snow lake Flin Flon area's, as for Paint lake its not worth the long 7 hour drive to fish it. If you want numbers and feeders and a decent camp spot then its okay but not for trophy hunting it gets pounded all year and very few big fish are being caught.This might change once it goes high management but that would be a few years to come. I fish it maybe 1 or 2 times a year and I live 20 minutes away. I fish other locations that offer me trophy fish. NM"

560975,Guest,2006-09-09 10:05:00,0,"Well I think it may just be the Emerald Shiner run and not Smelt as you say that control the Greenie run. It is Shiners down on the southern end of the lake that run up the rivers in the fall. I've known quite a few folks over the years who have been ripped off or vandalized at Selkirk. Bold criminals because on a weekend there are usually 200 or more rigs parked there. Fishing can be good, or be P poor, but fishing the suburbs of Winnepeg, with dozens of boats on each and every well known spot is to me far from a ""Canadian expierience"". Garbage everywhere, dead fish rotting everywhere, boats everywhere, shorefishers elbow to elbow, sewage spills out of the city, Ag runoff from thousands of acres of farmland. A true cesspool."
560977,Guest,2006-09-09 11:01:00,0,"Your bound to have some undesirables around any major center,doesnt matter what side of the border you fish North of the 49th doesnt mean your automatically in the back woods. True manitobans flock to the red in the fall its a tradition, as far as the pollution, I have to agree, just to many uneducated people reeking havoc on our shorelines and not enought people willing to just cleen a little extra. My daughter and I take an extra garbage bag with us everytime we shore fish but thats only a straw blade in a bail of straw. Don't describe an area as a cesspool that's just hurtfull to the people who try to make a difference."
560996,Guest,2006-09-10 18:54:00,0,"I agree dan61 we have a great fishery here and the actions of a few inconsiderate anglers will ruin it for others. In regards to the over crowding in the ""good spots"" I know a few that are not crowded at all and maybe you know a few too. I am in the process of starting a guide service and hope to change some of the misconceptions that the Red is dirty and over crowded. We as Manitobans have to do our part to promote our Province and show everyone that Ont. is not the only quality fishery in Canada(although it is a really nice place to go)."

561042,Guest,2006-09-12 11:03:00,0,Hard to disprove that misconception when it is basically a pure fact. How many sewage spills came out of the city this summer? Just the 1 or were there more?

560532,Guest,2006-08-22 03:39:00,0,Hi. we recently moves to nevada from chicago. it was 2 days drive and for housekepping in ontario it was about one thousand dollors for 7 days. checking out here for sachchsa wan or manitoba it was like 3000 dollors for 2 people for 3 or 4 days. rediculous. I am looking for something similar to ontario and their prices. thank you. just out here somewhere.

560553,canuk1100,2006-08-22 15:54:00,43,Hi there I have been thinking of the guide service for a while now and what my plan is to offer to take people fishing on a per day basis and help with arranging hotel or cabin rental to keep the cost in line also helping with other activities in and around the area such as a waterpark(waterslides) beaches shopping ect. (I am a fisherman first and formost but sometimes people want to do other things) I know my wife sure enjoys fishing but also enjoys seeing the sites and touring around when we go someplace new. the best part is that 20 mins. from Winnipeg is the BEST!!! Cat and Walleye river and only 1 hour NE is Pine Falls.
560674,Dacotah Eye,2006-08-26 21:02:00,2722,"There are lots of places in Manitoba that are way under $1,ooo per week for housekeeping. How far up do you want to go? Do a search of Flin Flon or Cranberry Portage for a lodge. New Vickery Lodge on Clearwater Lake has nice housekeeping cabins that are reasonable compared to the rates you are talking about. These places are about 400 miles north of the border though. There are plenty of lodges farther south also. Where I stay it is $350.00 per week for a two bedroom housekeeping cabin, but if I post it on here I'll never see a vacancy there again.:cheers:"
560729,Guest,2006-08-29 16:01:00,0,"No doubt about it, most of Manitoba offers the same great fishing as NW Ontario. Same beautiful Canadian Shield landscape and lakes. I have fished both for 25 years. Here's my 2 cent business analysis (for what its worth). Who are your customers (demographics) and why would they choose you (psychographics)? I'm guessing the largest group of customers will be a handful of guys from the north central portion of the US (Nebraska, Dakaotas, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin & Minnesota). They come primarily for the fantastic fishing, but also for the outdoor experience. Some like a fly-in for the seclusion and adventure. Others like the comforts and socialization of a lodge on the water. It's part of the ""Canadian experience. Yet a smaller group will be happy in a hotel/motel and restaurant food. (No evening call of the loon). I suspect this group may be budget concise or require services not available on the bush. Maybe they just want a quick & convienent trip. This might be your target market. Winnipeg International airport offer a great advantage to those who don't want to drive. Commercial flights to NW Ontario are not practical. Those who fly obviously don't bring their own boats. But would they spend the extra bucks to fly to Manitoba only to stay at motel? Good luck."
560948,Guest,2006-09-08 01:51:00,0,Hi. dakota eye. here is my email address so we can talk about the reasonabley priced resorts. yes the prices are all for corporate retreats. I need something priced like ontario has. thanks [email protected]
560954,Guest,2006-09-08 13:12:00,0,HI again. any body know any reasonably priced resorts in alberta? contact me at my email address above. thanks
560958,Guest,2006-09-08 16:34:00,0,"""The Canadian expierience"", most people I know would'nt think much of the scenery around Lockport and Selkirk. The crowds of fisherman sure would'nt do much for the expierience either. Crime and garbage everywhere. Fishing can be good some years but this won't be one of them as the water levels are terrible low this fall."

560970,Danny61,2006-09-09 01:10:00,42,"I cant comment about crime in Selkirk because for the most part its non existant, as far as the water level your right on. Many local anglers are concerned about the lack of flow right now. We need rain and we need it yesterday.But its the rainbow smelts that control the greenback run and hopefully they are a commen!!"
560347,phishfearme,2006-08-15 16:09:00,1242,"so how do you ""unpinch"" hooks in order to use the lures that you used in manitoba back in your home state or province? the only way we've done it is to physically replace the hooks - whatta pain. why bother, i'll go to ontario - that's the feedback i was trying to give canuck. we've pretty much replaced all our multiple-treblehook lures with a single rear treble and we'll use them either at home or canada. what are the ""two or three types of hooks"" that you only need to use in Manitoba? have you ever tried to buy barbless hooks at your tackle shop or cabelas or bass pro shop or any major lure manufacturer? you really can't. there must not be many ""skilled anglers"" out there demanding them. phish"
560348,Guest,2006-08-15 16:18:00,0,Barbless is good to fish with. Saves fish and if you keep pressure on the fish you dont lose anymore than barbed. Manitoba is truly a gem of a fishing area. Been there for 6 trips all of which were great. Spend most of my trips in Ontario....heck I just love em all.
560349,River_eye,2006-08-15 16:22:00,1486,"I've never felt handicapped with barbed hooks, or felt the need to rebarb them for fishing outside of Manitoba before. ""Gee...... it seems as though I'm not doing enough damage to this fish when I take the hook out of it...... better get some barbs back on there....."" (Sarcasm) The only thing barbs are good for as I see it is to keep leaches on hooks. There are really no barbless lures sold they wouldn't make money. It's easier to pinch your barbs than it is to ""demand"" barbless hooks. You can pretty much catch anything on a spoon, jig or crankbait."
560351,Mohleye,2006-08-15 16:24:00,368,"Maybe I need a clarification on this barbless thing. Is it required that every hook in your possession be barbless, or just what you have on your line? If only what's on your line, why can't you pinch them as you go? Even if not, what's so hard about using them up in Ontario or the states? The only issue I see when I've tried barbless is leeches and minnow wriggle off, which is kind of a pain. can't see it would make much difference on artificials."
560352,River_eye,2006-08-15 16:29:00,1486,only hooks attached to lines. Pinch as you go!
560354,canuk1100,2006-08-15 16:34:00,43,Barbless only applies to hook on your line here is another Manitoba tip I keep giving away for free (gosh maybe I should get this guide thing going). Here is the recap 1) don't hammer the hook when setting just sweep left or right 2) hold the line in your finger of your reel hand 3) use a med/light rod with an x-fast tip for almost everything but planner and trolling 4)use a small piece of rubber band to hold your leech or live minnow on your barbless hook you use when you come to fish with me in Manitoba FISH HARD AND KEEP SMILING THE KIDS ARE WATCHING!!!!!!
560450,canuk1100,2006-08-18 21:00:00,43,"Well I made up my mind and I am buying the 2007 2010 Lund Pro Guide with the power tiller steering and a 175 opti. and will most likely give the guiding a shot (cats,walleye,pike and maybe lake trout) depends on what the client wants. If it works out great if not oh well I may have to go work at a lodge on LOTW."
560477,Dacotah Eye,2006-08-19 21:49:00,2722,My favorite place to fish is North of The Pas in Manitoba. I hope I will be able to take my son there for the first time next Sept. I have wanted to do this since he was small. Now he is 23 and I might finally get him up there.:cheers:
560491,canuk1100,2006-08-20 11:26:00,43,"Paint lake is a great place also on the hwy. to Thompson(hwy.6) you can fly into Winnipeg and then to Thompson. I have thought about that lake in particular because I can drive there(it is only 6hrs. north of Winnipeg) and then pick-up people in Thompson and take them fishing. In the Pas area there are so many great lakes to fish also the Flin Flon area is good to. I have tried to key in on the area around the Interlake and eastern part of Manitoba. In this area we have Smallmouth,Lake Trout,Pike,Sturgeon and yes even 1 or 2(million)walleye. If you are interested in some fishing info for the Pas area let me know I will help if I can."
560494,Dacotah Eye,2006-08-20 12:56:00,2722,"I usually stay on Rocky Lake at Wanless and fish Rocky, Clearwater, Chocolate and Cormorant lakes. I came close to buying a lot on Cormorant some years ago but didn't. Now that I'm retired, I wish I would have as I could spend the whole summer up there. I'll have to see how things work out next fall. Thanks."
560303,canuk1100,2006-08-14 15:37:00,43,I have just started reading this fourum and am very disapointed to see the popularity of my home province is so overshadowed by all the hype over LOTW. In Manitoba we have some of the best Walleye fishing in the country maybe we as Manitobans should stop keeping the secret to ourselves (everyone knows about the Red River greenbacks and the Winnipeg river in the fall and winter) but I go out and catch big walleyes all year not just in the fall. I have thought about starting a guide service here in Manitoba that you could drive to in the summer and catch fish just like LOTW at a very reasonable price no fancy lodge but an acceptable motel that is clean and serves good food. Fish all day in a nice boat with 2 friends and a knowedgable guide and be treated to a great meal after the day is over. This sounds like an ad but I am interested in some feedback from others I may start this business if there is any interest thanks for reading this.
560305,Guest,2006-08-14 19:44:00,0,I am a big fan of manitoba walleye fishing. I have vacationed at God's lake several times and the walleye fishing is second to none. I think you would have a very successful business and you limits for taking back to the states are very generous. Give it more thought!
560307,Guest,2006-08-14 21:35:00,0,The fishing at God's is great we have so many other lakes that produce 8 plus pound fish in numbers all year. My main gripe is that I am one of those who has a problem justifing a $2500 or more 4 day trip mind you the lodges are really nice though. I just can't afford to pay that so I have always wanted to start a service to cater to the budget minded fisherpeople (men and women)outthere who wants to fish and enjoy good company in a fishing buddy atmosphere. I am buying my new boat next season (lund 18ft pro angler or a 2007 new model the 2015ft pro guide) I like tillers and the pro guide is rated to ...........175hp....hold on to your hats ladies and gentlemen. Well we will see I have a full-time job in the winter and this maybe my way of paying the fishing gods back for the many years of enjoyment I have had. Would anyone be interested in a lower cost alternative to the big name lodges?
560308,Mike Kansas,2006-08-14 21:42:00,1463,Would love to hear more about what you are thinking of doing. Let me know if you decide to give being a Guide a shot....I might be your first customer.Email me.
560311,River_eye,2006-08-14 22:30:00,1486,"I'm a proud Manitoban living in NW Ontario now. I have guided both places, both places receive good business from Americans. One thing I realized about NW Ontario is, there are about 10 lodges for every 1 in Manitoba, so naturally, this board is almost always about NW Ontario. Good luck on the guiding business, it's a labour of love, and not necessarily anything you're going to get rich quick on."
560313,Guest,2006-08-14 22:51:00,0,I also live and fish in Manitoba along with NW Ontario. There are wonderful fishing and guiding opportunities so good luck to you.
560315,phishfearme,2006-08-15 06:49:00,1242,"canuk - it seems that lac seul gets as much or more hits on this board than LOTW but you are correct - NW ontario does dominate. in searching for a place to go, i've looked at some outfitters in manitoba but ultimately went to ontario for three reasons 1 - it's just closer (less travel time and cost - lets face it, there's many more people the further east you go), 2 - for some reason manitoba outfitters are more expensive than ontario - maybe this is due to more competition in ontario and 3 - we'd have to get rid of most all of our lures/hooks to meet the ""no barbed hooks"" requirement. hope this helps, phish"
560321,River_eye,2006-08-15 09:30:00,1486,"you don't have to get rid of your lures, you only have to pinch the barbs on hooks that are attached to a line, that's it, and seeing as you only need 2 or three different types of hooks to catch fish in Manitoba, it usually isn't an issue. BTW, skilled anglers tend to prefer barbless hooks anyways."
560322,canuk1100,2006-08-15 09:43:00,43,Wow thanks for the feedback I do understand that NW Ontario is a great place to fish I go there usually around Rainy River and Suoix Lookout. I also take three to five trips a year to Devils Lake in ND. I do plan a trip to Mn. next year for a tournament. This is the reason I am looking into the guide service because of the cost to the angler I want people to come fish and enjoy themselves. The lodges and outfitters in Ont. have marketed NW Ont. for years as the place to fish but we have so much here in Manitoba. Winnipeg is only one hour west of LOTW and three hours north of Grand Forks. You can fly by major airline right into Winnipeg and arrange your trip to leave from there. I love fishing and want to share this with lots of people. I have never had a noticable difference in going barbless with boating fish the only thing I notice is the hookset you have to be more aware of the bite and less aggresive on setting the hook(sweep the tip don't hammer it).My choice is to use medium light with a x-fast tip 7ft. rod for jigging and 10lb powerpro line with a flourocarbon leader tied directly to the jig (standard stuff) just hold the line with your finger to feel the bite and sweep the rod left or right when you feel anything. Trolling and casting are a short book for what works but ussually nothing changes from your usual presentations. FISH HARD AND SMILE THE KIDS ARE WATCHING!!!!
560334,Guest,2006-08-15 12:27:00,0,"I love to fish Manitoba & Saskatchewan but take a look at map. NW Ontario is only one day's drive from huge population centers such as Chicago, Toledo, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Milwakee, Rockford, Madison, Gary and Detroit. It is amazes me that that one extra day of driving will shut down such great fishing experiences that the western provinces have to offer."
