561200,Renn,2006-09-14 14:05:00,87,"It's my understanding that the policy is that if a fisherperson does catch a ""trophy"" they can keep it. But it needs to be kept for taxidermy purposes only. Which in theory opens up the debate of what a ""trophy"" is. I am with Larry, I would much rather let that monster fish go and put a replica on my wall. Then I have the feelings of being able to release that fish AND the replica to brag about!! :-) Maybe, Bill can chime in if I am wrong about the intrepretation of the policy. Renn"
561208,Minnow Man,2006-09-14 21:12:00,85,"Hello Renn Ok I'll take the bait. A little history lesson first. In the early 90's the fish population on Gullrock Lake was in serious trouble, too many breeding stock fish being removed from the lake, no real rules then.The Minstry Of Natural Resorces got the resort owners together and told us to do something about the over harvest of the fish population. Either we come up with a plan or they would. The talk at that time was fish tags to each fisherman with just your limit handed out, reduce the number of beds per camp, lower limits & sizes even further. We come up with the plan of asking all fisherman to release all breeding stock fish back into the lake & letting only trophy fish to be taken to be mounted. That's when the trouble started, we had folks taking 20"" fish to 40"" fish home. The big northerns were used for fertilizer in a guests flower garden. I don't think anyone was mounting the 20"" walleye, then we had discrimination allegations. What is the differance if they take one home for mounting or if we eat one here. It's not fair, this guide line was not working, too many arguments. So we just changed it to no over size fish to be kept, no trophy fish kept. Today we are seeing the benificate of this program & our guests have the photos to prove it. Remember this policy was put into place to give our guests the best possible fishing. I am glad I am not a fish, because my reproduction days are long over, I hope nobody decides to kill me for that reason. My wife still says I am a good catch. Bill Golden Hook Camp"
561216,Renn,2006-09-15 09:19:00,87,"Bill, Thanks for the clarification on the policy. My intent was not to open a debate about the policy rather than to raise awareness to it. Thanks again for all of your work over the years to ensure Gullrock stays a quality walleye and northern fishery!!! Renn"
561217,Mohleye,2006-09-15 09:20:00,368,"I could see this being a real issue for debate if it weren't for replicas. When you can have the best of both worlds, how can you justify killing a trophy fish? How the heck are any of us guys who fish in Canada a week or two a year qualified to say that a fish is past it's reproductive prime, about ready to die, etc?"
561219,Guest,2006-09-15 10:32:00,0,"I for one love releasing the big boys. I hope future anglers have fun catching the same fish that gave me so much joy. Gullrock is a great fishery and their slot size is ideal in my opinion. I release any fish over 16, just because the smaller ones taste great and it takes a lot longer for these fish to grow than it would in a warmer climate. Take a picture and let em go."
561225,grt1,2006-09-15 17:45:00,259,"just returned home from a week away and find it interesting with this discussion, I did talk to Mark vermette about the fellow at Golden Hook and his concern over who checks the limits on guest anglers and the local angler. As someone who is always on the lake, I see and talk to many people over the course of the season. Certainly I take home some fish, once in a while. whenever momma says she wants fish for dinner, and of course we all know the struggle we fellows have to endure to put a fresh feed of Walleye on the table. But, for me, that feed is 3 fish. and I repeat we have fish once in a while. I take my buddies out when they come for a visit, but they are here for 1 feed of fish and that usually means a limit of 6 in the live well.(usually 3 people fishing). The locals that live on the lake, appreciate and work with the Gullrock camp owners to keep the population of walleye growing and producing and we are always watching for ""camp"" rules being violated. If we all work together, the fishing will be fantastic for years to come."
561356,grt1,2006-09-23 14:41:00,259,"Today was the first time on the lake for a week, it is really rolling out there. I went to Fishermens point and joined a group of 4 boats working that area. I brought home my 3 fish and by the time I left there were 8 boats there trying to stay out of the wind. The fish were in 19 to 25 feet and the water temp at the surface was 55. I saw one group throw back a 26 and a couple others throw back some over 20 inches."
561370,the_bronco,2006-09-24 20:50:00,86,"A month ago I turned fifty one, I have been fishing walleyes for over thirty years. My biggest fish in the states, to date, is 24"". In my fifteen years of fishing Gullrock Lake-one week per year, I have caught numerous fish 24 to 26 inches, one 28, one 28.5, and one just over 30"".I think of these fish every week of the year. I can tell you the time of day I caught these fish, what the weather was, what I was using to catch them, which one of my thirty rods I was using and many other details. What I feel most proud of is the fact that I released all of these fish. I still feel the water of the 30"" as she showered me with her tail (it must have been a gallon of water!)- and I laughed, I still grin every time I think of her- that was two years ago!.There is no doubt in my mind that without someone looking over this fishery that I would not have these lifetime memories, nor would I be fishing here still. Some day I want to take my little boy with me and I hope and pray that the big ones are still here and not on some wall some where, or used as shore lunch. Thank you grt1,your neighbors,Bill,Lee, and everyone else who are working hard to maintain this fishery that will be a part of my life, and hopefully my sons, for the rest of our days. Jim"
561376,Guest,2006-09-25 11:22:00,0,Was there last week and the fishing was great. caught more 20 inchers than could count. Burnt island was especially kind to us. used a slip sinker jig method and had a blast. the weather was a little rough at the beginning of the week but the fishing was on so who cares.
561139,Guest,2006-09-12 13:38:00,0,"Renn, I know Bill at Golden Hook very well and he would not be impressed with someone taking a fish over 18"". Bill has absolutely no tolerance for this and would definitely have words with the individual. As I recall, Bill may have had a run-in with this guy that resulted in the individual leaving camp. I will ensure that Bill is made aware of this situation. The camp owners on Gullrock are doing their best to ensure the quality of fishing remains for many years to come. I admire their commitment to this effort."
561052,Renn,2006-09-12 16:00:00,87,"Schooner, Thanks. I was going to stop at Golden Hook and mention it to Bill but I understand Bill is retiring so I wasn't sure if he would want to bother with this? I did mention this to our camp owners so maybe they mentioned it to Bill. I agree the Camp Owners have worked too hard to get the lake to this point. I am really looking forward to the next couple of years. Renn"

561156,Minnow Man,2006-09-12 21:09:00,85,"Hello Renn Every week as our guests arrive in camp they go through a short orientation. The fish policy is explained to each & every guest. No over slot fish to be kept, no trophy fish kept. We have the fish policy in place to give our guests the best possible fishing. Many guests have told us they have caught their biggest fish ever on Gullrock Lake. This only happens because the folks that have come before them have released these huge fish back into the water. On Sept 6 I learned the fellow from Nebraska had over size fish,we entered into a verbal disagreement on our fish policy & he was told to leave camp immediately. Which he did. The new owner Mark Vermette was present when this happened & he said he would have done the same. If you see someone not following the fish policy, get a good discription of the boat, number of people & let your resort owner know. The camp owners on Gullrock Lake all get along well & will deal with anyone not following the fish policy. As a resort owner that is one of the most unpleasant tasks I have had to do. Sad to say I have done it many times. What a way to end the season. Still have guests in camp, everyone is telling stories of big fish being caught & released. Lots of nice size eaters being caught as well. The fall bite is on. The lake looks great, leaves are turning colour, weather is still warm, perfect fall fishing weather. See you on the lake.

561164,Renn,2006-09-13 10:36:00,87,"Bill, Thanks for the response and the overall concern for the future of the fishing at Gullrock. You and all the camp owners should be commended for your stand on taking the Ontario regulations one step farther. Because of your policy, my 9 year old son and 7 year old daughter not only exprienced catching 26 1/2"" walleyes this summer, but the joy of watching those fish swim back to the depths and the growing anticipation that ""those fish will be bigger next summer!"" :-) Thank you and enjoy your retirement! Renn"
561183,walleyeduran,2006-09-13 21:36:00,286,"Bill, glad to know that the situation was handled in the manor that hopefully all resort owners on Gull Rock would have done. Too many people in this world still think the rules don't apply to them. I have been fishing Gull Rock for the last 7 years, sometimes a coulple of times a year, and have never had a problem catching eater size fish (14-17 inches). 10 days to go for another great fishing trip. Thanks again Bill for enforcing the GULL ROCK RULES!!!!!!!!!! walleyeduran"
561186,Guest,2006-09-13 21:48:00,0,Do not want to keep the big fish anyway-throw em back. the 15's are the best eaters baby.
561189,Guest,2006-09-13 23:16:00,0,"Have been going to Gull Rock since the length slot was 21.75 inches. Had no problem then releasing those fish and have no problem releasing the 18 inchers now. I would have a problem having someone tell me that I couldnt keep a true TROPHY, I mean one that is over 30 inches long. Most people will never catch one that big in a lifetime. The way I understand that a fish like that is beyond best reproduction years and in Gull Rock probably is in its last year or two of life"
561199,2746,2006-09-14 12:29:00,3206,"I guess we would just have to agree to disagree. Have been fishing Gullrock 2-3 times per year for 5 years now. Very clear that the lodge association rules have made it an outstanding fishery. I have yet to catch a 30 incher and, at 65, I may never do it. But, if it happens, the only bigger thrill than catching it will be watching it swim away. The rules are very clear and we all have the choice of going somewhere else if we have the burning desire to keep a trophy and, I would guess, many do. By the way, my two grandsons from Texas and California caught their first walley at Gullrock and both caught 25+"" fish on our trip last spring. Great to see the pride on their faces and the high fives as they watched those fish swim away."
560879,Guest,2006-09-05 17:36:00,0,I'm on Gullrock Lake the week of 9/10/06. Does anyone have a recent fishing report for the Gullrock/Red Lake area? Anyone having success casting for Northerns?
560880,Guest,2006-09-05 17:51:00,0,"The Red Lake Walleye classic was just on the weekend and looking at the results the fishing was pretty good espically with this warm front holding,it should stay consistant. Everybody was using big minnows, I know this because the pros cleaned out all the bait stores so phone ahead for bait"
560892,Guest,2006-09-06 07:33:00,0,"I was out yesterday on Gullrock, the water was like glass for the first 3 hours. the bite was on if you were working the 20 to 30 foot range. Then the wind came up and the fish seemed to go shallower (at least on the sunken island). Water temp was 64 degrees ."
560904,Guest,2006-09-06 11:31:00,0,Thanks good info. I'm thinking about trying some GULP minnows this year in addition to the live bait. Any thoughts?
560971,grt1,2006-09-09 09:10:00,259,Save the gulp until you run out of live bait. gulp works up here but not as well as live minnows
561031,sifty,2006-09-12 08:42:00,46,Tried the gulp crawlers they would tap it once but never come back to it. Also tried salte4d minnows without much luck. Little joe's and a crawler seemded to work best for me. Make sure you try the shallow bite this year we got on them good at 9-10 ft in the weeds.

Sifty, the 9 - 10 foot flats were pretty busy most nights while we were pounding the northen. The walleyes must have been going pretty good. I think I counted 19 boats one evening out there!!! Don't be afraid to try the 26 - 30 foot range either. We found some nice sized fish there also. GRT1, how are the fires in the area? I know the smoke was pretty heavy a couple of days. There was a small grass fire along the power lines along the Bug River Friday morning. Made for an exciting ride back to camp!!! :-) Also, witnessed a group of three guys from Nebraska, staying at Golden Hook, driving a white and blue Crestliner with a walk through widshield slap a 21 inch walleye on the stringer and then head out for shore lunch!!! The ""captian"" of the boat said he had been coming to Gullrock for 45 years. Obviously, he is trying his best to make sure the bigger walleyes aren't around for his grandkids to enjoy. Sure is frustrating for those of us who follow the Camp Owners policy about putting those nice fish back for others to enjoy!! Renn"
