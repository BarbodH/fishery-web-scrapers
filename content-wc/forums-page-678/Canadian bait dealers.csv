561301,Guest,2006-09-21 16:39:00,0,"You can get bait at Melfort...but there will be bait in Nipawin, several places."

We stopped at more bait shops than I can remember from Fort Frances all along the way to Ear Falls and NOBODY had leeches according to the clerks. Even people that pre-ordered their leeches were on a waiting list that was 2 pages long at the 4 Seasons bait shop in Ear Falls."

Leeches work very well in the river but if you don't have them now, I'm guessing you are SOL. Frozen minnows don't typically produce well since it is a rig bite so look for the biggest fattest crawlers you can find. If all else fails, you can always get them trolling cranks. Find a spot where it goes from shallow to deep and run over those spots more than once, with and against the current. If old marble eyes is home, he'll bite."
561334,Guest,2006-09-22 12:26:00,0,Most adult leeches die off in early July when the water temps get warm. After that it is very difficult to trap enough.
561343,Guest,2006-09-22 20:42:00,0,"Was the weather abnormally hot earlier this year? I've been able to purchase leeches as late as October in years past. I was shocked that NOBODY had leeches the last week of July, even if reserving them in advance."
561353,Guest,2006-09-23 10:45:00,0,I know at an outpost leeches this summer sold for $100.00 a pound. Crawlers and plastic worked great for us.
