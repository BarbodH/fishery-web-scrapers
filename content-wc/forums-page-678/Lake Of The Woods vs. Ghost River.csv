I am looking at Ghost River camp and lodges on Lake of the Woods in the Sabaskong Bay area. Our group is primarily northern pike and musky fishermen, but also fish walleye. I am looking for any suggestions pro's/con's on the topics of fishing, fishing pressure accommodations, boats, and any other experiences people may have. Thanks, Justin"

561049,Guest,2006-09-12 13:58:00,0,I can't make any comments on Ghost because I have never fished there. LOTW I have fished many years. Great body of water with multiple species. Fishing pressure seems to be getting lighter. Big fish are plentiful. I have stayed at numerous resorts and have not run into a bad one. Leave a post next year letting us know where you went and about the fishing.

Fishing pressure is getting lighter and muskie fishing in general has never been better. The Nestor Falls area also provides the opportunity to fish for Lake Trout on Crow Lake or on Whitefish Bay of Lake of the Woods. If you are looking for camps, please tell me what you are looking for; i.e. family camp, remote camp, American Plan, housekeeping, etc. and I will try to help you. I am familiar with most of the camps in the area. Drop me an email and I'll get back to you."

They have good Northern Pike fishing also and many lakes to choose from. Sad to say, no Muskie can be found up there but the Hosts and the Staff are the best. I've been there 3 times. LOTW offers lots of species and is getting better. My cousin goes up there once or twice a year just for Muskie fishing. Then again, he knows Muskie! I've been to Canada about 15 times over the past 25 years and someone else at the camp, in the same week, always lands the 40"" + Pike I want! Doesn't matter what resort I go to. LOL Big Cannon Lodge (Vermilion Bay) offers great fishing but their costs have went through the roof about 5 years ago and haven't come down compared to the fishing action you receive. They're a great camp just a little pricy. They have a catch and release lake that you can get the big Muskie and Smallmouth with a very short portage (from the lodge dock, ride-portage and fish) in less than 30 minutes. From the research that I've done there are lots of affordable camps on LOTW but we've either flown in or drove further North for one reason or another. When in doubt, pay the extra bucks on a guide and learn how to fish the area (new large lake) in the first day or two. Hope this helps."

The pike are there in numbers, but very few fish over 40"" come out of this camp. We always go mid-summer though, so pike action is slow for us anyway."

We have stayed the past 3yrs in Sabaskong bay(Nestor Falls) and like the area. We fish for about everything from panfish to northern/muskie and we too are not walleye fishermen but do eat them so we catch enough to bring home and that's it for walleyes. I do not know what time of year you go(we go in early/mid June) but I would think you would do OK for northerns(we caught lots up to 5-6lb) and the neat thing is we caught 8 muskies(up to 49"") and we did not even fish for them, we caught them fishing for bass/northern with spinnerbaits or rattletraps. The past year we only caught 2 muskies as we were a week early but saw 10 big follows(no fish stories). so to sum up I think you will catch plenty of northern but most will be 20-30"" and you will see and likely catch some muskies if you target them. There was a guy from Oklahoma last year that targeted muskies and he had(by himself) 7 fish over 40"" in the week he was there."
