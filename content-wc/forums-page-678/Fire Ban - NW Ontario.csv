Effective at midnight Wednesday, September 6, until further notice all open burning, including campfires, is banned. These restrictions apply to the Ministry of Natural Resources districts of Dryden, Fort Frances, Kenora, Nipigon, Red Lake, Sioux Lookout and Thunder Bay. Please contact your local ministry office to see if your area is affected bit of a long link, but has map etc. includes everything around LOW, Lac Suel, etc. Probably can get to this by shortening the link Vhttp://affm.mnr.gov.on.ca/spectrasit...21C4FD0353783E"
