I know that Crow Lake is a major muskie fishery but it is also incredibly tough to fish since the water is so clear. Eagle Lake has some great muskies in it but LOTW's seems to be making an incredible comeback. So to get maximum return on your fishing dollar, which lake would you fish?"

You can fish LOTW and then fish Crow all in the same day if you want. You can put in at Vic & Dot's for fishing on Whitefish Bay. I guess the nice part about LOTW and Nestor Falls is that you have choices. That can be nice when weather is hot, the lake is covered in bloom, low water, etc. You can always fish Crow...no bloom, constant water level and the water is always cool. Plus you can catch big fish in all of the above. Sounds like paradise to me (and has for 53 years)."

There are also different kinds of water color, from clear on the northwest end to tea stained on the southern part of the lake. Either lake has the potential to produce nice fish as well as the next record. One just has to be in the right place at the right time. And as they say put in your time. The fish of 10,000 casts."
