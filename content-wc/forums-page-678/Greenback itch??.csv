561272,canuk1100,2006-09-20 15:14:00,43,Yep caught a few but I haven't been out since the temp drop I will be out after 1 p.m. on Thurs. with my Dad. He hasn't been on the river this year for Walleye so I'll be heading out to get him some fish (I hope).
561289,Stu McKay,2006-09-21 11:27:00,18,"As the water temps continue to drop, the action will only continue to increase. The river is in great shape and we should see a super fall-run! Last fall and winter the action was incredible. In fact the Hard Water season was nothing short of incredible and this winter should be just as productive!"
561090,Reno,2006-09-11 08:27:00,330,"Canuk, Burr and I will be up on the 6th...still debating on the tournament..staying at Papertown...look us up! Steve"

561264,Hawgeye,2006-09-20 11:43:00,1355,Anyone been out yet??
560871,Guest,2006-09-05 15:30:00,0,From what I have heard from others that smaller greenbacks have started running with the odd big one. Could be a good year. But again I haven't seen it for myself yet
560881,freespoolin,2006-09-05 17:54:00,472,"On the plus side, the Lake Winnipeg commercial fishermen have done very well this year. The walleye and forage levels are high. On the downside, there's no flow in the Winnipeg River system. Over the past 20 years, I've had better success when there's more flow in the river."
560885,Guest,2006-09-05 19:04:00,0,"For those of you who fish the Red there is pressure by local anglers and residents on the Selkirk town council members and its Chamber of Commerce to make improvements to the launch and docks at Selkirk Park.Improvements have been long overdue,boats and trailers have been damaged and tourism dollars are being lost.I hope our neighbors to the south who come up for cats or greenbacks contact the Selkirk council either through emails or letters to urge them to make improvements.Letters and emails coming from the tourists and anglers who use these facilities may expedite this.The contact info is at the website www.cityofselkirk.com .Thank you and keep your lines tight."
560968,Guest,2006-09-08 23:55:00,0,bump.. I'm headed up the 1st week of October. The warm weather has me concerned. Has there been any fish moving into the Red yet?? I'd love to see some reports or thoughts. Thanks.
560969,Danny61,2006-09-09 01:04:00,42,Yes a few green's have been reported in the Red already but few and far between. Water level is down so not much current.Last 2 days the overnight temp has droppped way down so the water hopefully is cooling. Commercial fisherman have had a great year so hopefully the quotas are full and no reason to work to hard in the fall.
560979,walley250,2006-09-09 11:28:00,161,Is the red low enough that we should consider pine falls instead?

560983,Guest,2006-09-10 09:56:00,0,"I was out last night and caught a few, the water level is a little low but nothing to be concerned about the level of flow is down but you still need to double anchor to hold yourself on the fish jigging has been productive. No big ones yet though I will be fishing in the Red River Challenge on the first also with my wife. Hope to see anyothers out there too good fishing everybody."

560840,Guest,2006-09-04 14:46:00,0,"Okay, I know it is a little early but now that it is September, my buddies up in Pine Falls will be preparing for another ""greenback"" run. Those of us that will make the annual trip from the States will be on our way very soon. I will be making my first trip this year during that last weekend of September with my Son (13), my Father (76),my brother (51) and a friend of the family. This will be the first time my son has ever made this fishing trip. I am concerned that we will be too early as it seems as it has been cooler in the past. Just curious if any local fisherman from the area have ventured out to test the river or bay? I would appreciate any updates as things get closer to the first fall trip of the year. Thanks Hawgeye"
560844,manitobawalleye,2006-09-04 15:47:00,885,"will keep you posted heading up in 3 weeks the weather has been weird all summer here they caught greenbacks into june and some in the red for the last 3 weeks the voyaguer tourney is on the 7th 8th the canadian championship on the 21st 22nd if you push your trip back i would go between those 2 weekends manitoba .... a 100,000 lakes how many walleyes ???? i will never have enough time...."
560845,walley250,2006-09-04 16:58:00,161,I dont think your post is too early. I begin the countdowrn usually around 60 days. I live for this trip. The people up their are awsome and obviously the fishing is somthing you cant find around here. 43 days and counting
560853,Guest,2006-09-04 22:29:00,0,I am also heading up there on the weekend of the last tourney as that is when I have the best success. I CAN'T WAIT!
560856,lund115,2006-09-05 09:11:00,698,"We will also be up there the week of the last tourney. We have always had great luck right in that time frame. I feel kind of bad right now. We have always fished Pine Falls, but this year we made reservations to stay in Selkirk, and fish the Red River. I feel bad we won't be on the bay. I think we will have to spend one day on the bay, just for old times. I like being able to fish the bay, and not have 20 other boats with in 75 yards of me. I guess it all depends on how the fishing is on the Red. If the Red is bad, we can always pack it up, and stay at Pine Falls. Where does everyone else like to fish, the Red River or Pine Falls???? There is something about that bay that draws me to it. The nights are getting colder and it is 43 days away!!!!!!!"
560859,Reno,2006-09-05 10:24:00,330,Lund 115 Burr and I will be going up to Pine Falls Oct 6 thru 15th. Plan on fishing the bay and river mostly. But if bad weather will be heading to the Red River. It's going to be a Great Time! Steve
560860,Danny61,2006-09-05 10:36:00,42,"I'll be fishing the Red Oct 1 in the Red River Walleye Challenge then its off to the bay for the walleye classic Oct 6&7, for the first time always just fish the Red cause its familar never fished Pine Falls before looking forward to the challenge."
560863,Hump,2006-09-05 13:03:00,578,I am totally unfamiliar with this area. Is Pine Falls a town? If so Where? Are there multiple lakes there? Fishing camps? Any info is appreciated.
560864,Reno,2006-09-05 13:33:00,330,"Yes, Pine Falls is a town...approx 70 miles NE of Winnipeg. (am probably wrong about the mileage)..The Winnipeg River runs right by and feeds into Lake Winnipeg (Traverse Bay)..This will be my 3rd year, and am always amazed at the size of walleyes. Cranking, jigging and bottom bouncing are our methods. The lake is HUGE and when the wind blows from the N..FORGET IT..the river can also be very good. Steve"
560867,lund115,2006-09-05 14:11:00,698,"Rule of thumb for us is, if the forecast is for 15 mph or more for the wind, go to the Red, if lower go to Traverse Bay. Traverse is our favorite pick. It seems like we can always catch more fish in the bay, compared to the Red. I also do not care for all the fishing pressure on the Red. Like stated before, you can be fishing within 50 boats, all within 300 yards on the Red. At Pine Falls this is not usually the case. We have had great luck at both places either way. If you do not have a 17 ft+ boat, I would be real careful on the Bay. The waves can get big real fast, and it is an 8 mile drive back to the boat launch. There have been 6 foot waves at Pine falls. We went to the Red, and we were fishing in one foot waves. Best trip of the year and can't wait for that week to come. It would be great if you guys could post which was better, either the Red or Pine Falls. Don't need any details, just which area was going better. Can't wait to hear how you guys did, and I hope your arms are tired from pulling up 10 lbers. Good luck guys!!!!!"
